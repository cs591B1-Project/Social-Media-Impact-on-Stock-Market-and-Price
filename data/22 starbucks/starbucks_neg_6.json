If so, here's a special breakout of Jim Cramer's CEO interview segment.\nStarbucks ( SBUX ) : In a special Veterans Day episode of Mad Money on Thursday, Cramer spoke with Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, highlighting the company's partnership to help veterans. Before a studio audience of West Point cadets, veterans, military personnel and their families, Cramer noted that Starbucks plans to hire at least 10,000 veterans and military spouses by the end of 2018.\nSchultz said the integrity, work ethic and leadership skills of our veterans are beyond reproach and we should be acknowledging them every day and not just on Veterans Day. He said among the things veterans need most are transitional tools to help them re-enter the workforce.\nSchultz has been a long-time proponent of the notion that business, as he said, \"is not evil\" and that CEOs have an opportunity to benefit society. Hiring veterans, he said, is one of those ways, which is why Starbucks has thousands of job openings for veterans, in stores, supply chain and management.",

Last year, Starbucks had plain red holiday cups, with some customers using their cups as canvasses for creative art designs.\"The artists behind the work hail from all over the world - a college student studying in Germany, a hairstylist near Philadelphia, an aspiring artist in New York,\" Starbucks said on Wednesday. \"Their inspiration came from nature and seasonal traditions. Some are bold and graphic while others evoke the feeling of an old-fashioned storybook. Together the collection expresses the shared spirit of the season.\"The coffee chain faced controversy last year year for their plain red cups, with some social media users criticizing Starbucks for removing their holiday-themed designs. Last week, the chain also released a green cup ahead of Election Day, calling it a \"symbol of unity.\" The Associated Press contributed to this report. Related Topics: ",

      "text": "November 10, 2016 Coffee & Beverages Starbucks Debuts Nitro Cold Brew in China Share Downloads China is the first international market, outside of the U.S. and Canada, to launch Nitro Cold Brew Starbucks aims to rollout the new handcrafted cold coffee innovation across more locations in China, further deepening its coffee leadership position in the market \nSHANGHAI; November 10, 2016 – Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX) announced today that the China World Trade Centre Starbucks store in Beijing is the first location in China, and outside the U.S. and Canada, to introduce Nitro Cold Brew on tap alongside its classic Cold Brew and more locations are to come over the next few months. The introduction of Nitro Cold Brew in China comes after a highly successful nationwide launch of Starbucks Cold Brew . Starbucks will once again bring a brand new delightful handcrafted cold coffee experience to its Chinese customers. \n“We have been relentless in our pursuit to perfect our coffee expertise and Nitro Cold Brew is a firm demonstration of our significant investments in coffee-forward product innovations to deepen our coffee leadership position,” said Belinda Wong, ceo, Starbucks China. “Something magical happens whenever we combine our innovation with the unbelievable passion of our skilled Starbucks barista. The handcrafted Nitro Cold Brew will surprise and exceed the expectations of customers who are seeking a different kind of coffee artistry experience in China.” \nNitro Cold Brew – Starbucks newest take on its signature Nariño 70 Cold Brew . Cold Brew – is infused with nitrogen that unlocks the super-smooth, natural sweetness of Cold Brew coffee, which then cascades from the tap with a velvety and creamy texture that customers can see and taste. It is deliciously cold and is served unsweetened, and without ice, to highlight the flavor the cold brewing process brings out in the coffee. Since its launch in May 2016, Nitro Cold Brew is one of the most popular beverages at the Starbucks Reserve® Roastery and Tasting Room in Seattle . \n“Our customers embraced the smooth, full-bodied flavor of Starbucks Cold Brew when it was first introduced in China last summer. There’s a lot of time and passion that goes into brewing each batch of Cold Brew, so it’s been especially rewarding to see customers enjoying it,” said Xi Wen, coffee master and store manager, China World Trade Centre Starbucks Reserve™ store. “I am proud that my store has been selected as the first store in China to introduce the Nitro Cold Brew, and I am looking forward to introducing this new handcrafted cold coffee experience to my customers and partners.” \nRecipes for cold coffee beverages are developed by Starbucks® coffee and research teams, who taste hundreds of cups of coffee to ensure the right blend, roast and brewing method is used to create the perfect flavor profile. Starbucks Cold Brew features a blend of high-quality varietals from Latin America and Africa, which delivers a sweet, dense and smooth coffee punctuated with a chocolatey and citrusy flavor profile. \n  Related News",

      "text": "Starbucks brings back seasonal drinks to sweeten up your festive season By Raymond Tan | Published 11 Nov 2016 09:00 AM, Updated 3 hours ago Exclusive Free Item Free Pot of Mussels at Brussels Sprouts Robertson Quay Enjoy a Free Pot of A La Carte Starter-Sized Mussels (worth $22++) with minimum spending of $50 in a single receipt. Book now! \nTimes are changing, but certain festive rituals never grow old. Giving gifts to loved ones, catching up with friends and family, putting up decorations, and of course that most time-honoured of traditions: sipping on Starbucks' festive drinks.Surely there's no better way to show how cool you are than by ordering a super zhng-ed festive drink, like a venti no-whip (low-fat) Toffee Nut Frappucino Lite with add-on chocolate chips and extra pump of caramel syrup, all while judging the poor sods ordering boring, standard lattes. Plebs, all of them! So it's great that Starbucks is bringing back three festive drinks, all favourites from previous years: the Toffee Nut Latte, Peppermint Mocha and Gingerbread Latte, as well as their cold frappuccino versions. We went for a taste test for the frappuccino versions. Here's what we thought: Toffee Nut Frappuccino | Image: Raymond Tan Toffee Nut Frappucino Toffee Nut Frappucino is, like most Starbucks frappuccinos, very sweet. But if you're patronising Starbucks regularly, chances are you are used to the sugary levels, and the sweetness doesn't bother you. It tasted fine, and the toffee flavour was clear, but instead of the frap we recommend you go for the latte version, whose warmth goes much better with the rich, buttery notes of the toffee. We like the toasted toffee nuts which are sprinkled over the whipped cream. Gingerbread Frappuccino | Image: Raymond Tan Gingerbread Frappuccino This one certainly tasted kind of weird. You'd think its flavour would be more robust, seeing as how it's supposed to taste like gingerbread. But even with spice-infused whipped cream and a drizzle of brown sugar, it was anaemic on spiciness — there's still some gingerbread flavour in there, but it is masked by the sweetness of the drink. Peppermint Mocha | Image: Raymond Tan Peppermint Mocha Frappuccino This one feels like the most festive of the lot. Espresso and milk are mixed with chocolate and peppermint syrup, and topped with whipped cream, mocha drizzle and candy cane pieces. Sweet (again, this is a Starbucks drink) but not overly so, with a fresh minty flavour, the Peppermint Mocha Frappucino certainly feels like the perfect drink to usher in the yuletide spirit. It looks pretty colourful from the top, too! Starbucks festive drinks | Image: Raymond Tan Speaking of colourful, Starbucks will be rolling out their red holiday cups once again. Taking a cue from customers who had been using their red holiday cups as a canvas, the coffee chain invited customers to share their designs on Instagram last December. The 13 hand-picked designs for the red cups used this year are all created by Starbucks customers from all over the world. The cup design was kept as close to the original artwork to honour the artists and the integrity of their artwork.Way to put us in the festive mood! We'll just let you gawk at the designs now. \nStarbucks red cups | Image: Starbucks Advertisement cafe Drinks Drink What to Drink New and Updates Raymond Tan In a distant past, Raymond wrote about films, video games and entertainment technology.

PepsiCo chief executive Indra Nooyi, who backed Democrat Hillary Clinton, said she hoped President-elect Donald Trump's controversial statements on immigrants and minorities during the election battle were \"just campaign rhetoric\". \"Our employees, especially our employees who are non-white or who are LGBT, are asking, 'Are we safe?'\" said Nooyi, who was born in India. \"The first thing we have to do is assure everyone in the US that everyone is safe.\" Starbucks chief executive Howard Schultz, who also backed Clinton, bemoaned the \"vitriolic\" nature of the campaign and said he was disturbed by some of the after-effects. \"One has to be concerned with what's happened over the last few months and even over the last 24 hours,\" he said. \"We've seen things that are very disturbing. I saw a picture today of a swastika. It's difficult to understand.\" The remarks came at the New York Times Dealbook conference on Thursday, held less than 48 hours after Trump's shock win in the battle for the White House. Election returns showed Trump won large majorities with white voters, but badly lagged Clinton with minority groups. Social media on Wednesday and Thursday recounted cases of immigrants and minorities facing bigotry in schools and stores. Thousands of anti-Trump protesters took to about 10 cities, some carrying signs declaiming \"Not our President\" and \"Love trumps hate.\" Nooyi congratulated Trump, but suggested he needs to set a much more inclusive tone. She also expressed disgust with Trump's excuses following a leaked 2005 video in which the president-elect spoke lewdly about women. In the clip, Trump described groping and forcing himself on women in vulgar, predatory language. \"How dare we talk about women that way?\" Nooyi said. \"I don't think there's a place for that kind of talk, not in a locker room, not anywhere,\" she said. \"If we don't nip this in the bud, it's going to take over our society.\" Schultz said he was shocked by the election result and that it reflects \"years and years of a great many people in America feeling they've been left behind\". Starbucks briefly got into a tiff with Trump in late 2015 after the Republican mogul suggested the coffee chain should be boycotted over bright red holiday cups that contained no explicit Christmas imagery. Some evangelicals viewed the cups as anti-Christian. Schultz said he was baffled by the flap. \"Every now and then you wake up and you say, 'What?'\" Schultz said. \"The irony is we had our best Christmas ever and our business went up, so I thank him.\" The Starbucks chief did not rule out a run for public office, but said he has no interest in serving in the Trump administration. \"I don't think that's for me,\" he said.

      "text": "Starbucks Holiday Cups Are Different This Year (SBUX) By Dan Moskowitz | November 10, 2016 — 9:08 PM EST \nStarbucks Corporation ( SBUX ) has been selling its red holiday cups since 1997, but this year will be very different than past years. While the cups remain red, they were not created by Starbucks designers. Instead, they were created by customers. \nIn the past, customers could create their own designs on white-canvas holiday cups, but last December, Starbucks asked its customers to use red cups as a canvas and then submit their designs on Instagram. Starbucks was surprised by the response, which was more than 1,200 red holiday cup designs. Those submissions also came from 13 different countries. \nDena Blevins, creative director of Starbucks Global Creative Studio, said, “We were surprised and inspired by the amount of incredible art submitted by our customers. The designs were beautiful, expressive and engaging. We quickly realized there was potential to use the customer-created art for our holiday cups.” \nStarbucks contacted a small group of customers who designed some of those red holiday cups and asked them to mail in their cups for product potential evaluation. This led to 13 customer-created red holiday cup designs being created, which are now sold at 25,000 Starbucks stores across 75 countries. \nBlevins said, “We loved how the red cups with white designs naturally created a collection. They hang together as one idea, but each expression is unique.” \nIf you look a little deeper, you will notice that Starbucks might have found something with customer collaboration. A customer of a popular retailer will be more than happy to have his or her work displayed to the masses (even though, in this case, no names are used on the cups). This leads to a sense of accomplishment for the customer, and they will surely share their success with their social media networks, and potentially their local media. This might even become national news for the customer-designers that live in other countries. \nFor Starbucks, there is no cost in having customers create holiday cups. If Starbucks—as well as other retailers—caught on to the fact that company-customer collaboration has potential to lead to increased exposure for specific products, it could become a trend. If that were to happen, then Starbucks was ahead of the curve. It wouldn’t be the first time, or the last. \nSBUX has depreciated 12.22% over the past 12 months and currently offers a dividend yield of 1.83%.",

      "text": "Search Jim Cramer's \"Mad Money\" trading recommendations using our exclusive \"Mad Money\" Stock Screener . \nDid you miss last night's \"Mad Money\" on CNBC ? If so, here's a special breakout of Jim Cramer's CEO interview segment.\n\nStarbucks ( SBUX ) : In a special Veterans Day episode of Mad Money on Thursday, Cramer spoke with Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, highlighting the company's partnership to help veterans. Before a studio audience of West Point cadets, veterans, military personnel and their families, Cramer noted that Starbucks plans to hire at least 10,000 veterans and military spouses by the end of 2018.\nSchultz said the integrity, work ethic and leadership skills of our veterans are beyond reproach and we should be acknowledging them every day and not just on Veterans  Day. He said among the things veterans need most are transitional tools to help them re-enter the workforce.\nSchultz has been a long-time proponent of the notion that business, as he said, \"is not evil\" and that CEOs have an opportunity to benefit society. Hiring veterans, he said, is one of those ways, which is why Starbucks has thousands of job openings for veterans, in stores, supply chain and management.",

      "text": "Starbucks debuted its annual holiday cup on Thursday.\nBut instead of offering customers one festive cup, the coffee company released 13 cups with different designs. All the cups are red with white designs and the company's green and white logo. Some designs feature hand-drawn snowflakes, reindeer, Christmas lights, candy canes, ornaments and Santa Claus riding his sleigh.\nAccording to Starbucks, the cup designs were created by customers from around the world. The designs were submitted to the company via its #RedCupContest last year.\n\"We crafted coffee. You made it art,\" Starbucks wrote in a promotional video with the hashtag #RedCups.\nCustomers complained last year that Starbucks' plain red cups were not festive enough and criticized the company for attempting to be politically correct by taking the Christmas theme off the cups.\nThe coffee giant's vice president of design and content, Jeffrey Fields, told Us Weekly that the plain cups were meant to embrace \"the simplicity and the quietness\" of the holiday season.\n>> Read more trending stories\nMore recently, Starbucks debuted a green cup that features a mosaic of dozens of people drawn in one continuous stroke. The cup, meant to encourage unity and symbolize \"shared values and the need to be good to each other,\" was criticized when customers believed that the cup was replacing the company's usual red cups.\n\" All these faces on my green cup and not a one of them looks like Santa or Jesus. Why do you still hate Christmas?\" one Twitter user asked the company. Another said the design was \"political brainwashing,\" saying: \"I want snowflakes.\"",

      "text": "Next Image: red_holiday_cups_2016_woodland_deer   \nStarbucks has officially released its 2016 holiday cup line — and it is a line, rather than a single cup design. The company used designs that customers actually came up with last year, using the ever-controversial red cups as canvases. There are 13 cups in all; an unlucky number, maybe, but Starbucks doesn’t seem concerned. \n“We hope that this year’s red holiday cup designs express the shared spirit of the holidays as told by our customers,” said Sharon Rothstein, Starbucks global chief marketing officer, in a statement. \nAccording to the statement, Starbucks received over 1,200 art submissions for their 2016 cup collection. \n“We were surprised and inspired by the amount of incredible art submitted by our customers. The designs were beautiful, expressive and engaging,” said Dena Blevins, creative director of Starbucks Global Creative Studio, said in the statement . “We quickly realized there was potential to use the customer-created art for our holiday cups.”\nCustomers are already reveling in the holiday cup glow:\nI'm not okay today. Currently crying over the fact that the new red cups were designed by customers. I love you, @Starbucks \n— M ͛ (@cohabgrad) November 10, 2016 \n\n#RedCups back at @Starbucks is the best day of the year ❤️ ☕️ pic.twitter.com/zh3m2mf5y1 \n— Colleen O'Connor (@ColleenO_PR) November 10, 2016 \n\n@Starbucks this is the greatest @Snapchat filter, I've ever been #blessed with.

      "text": "Read Now What Big U.S. Companies Like Starbucks and Facebook Are Saying About a Trump Presidency A number of firms issued congratulatory statements to President-elect Donald Trump, while others called for unity in the wake of the election. Rachel Aldrich Nov10,201611:43AMEST \nIn the wake of Donald Trump's election as the 45th president of the United States, major companies have weighed in on the prospect of working alongside the new commander-in-chief, as well as about how the election could impact their bottom lines. \nSeveral major industry leaders congratulated the president-elect and remained optimistic about the future of the global economy -- a favorable outlook that came as stocks trader higher on Thursday, positioning the market for a fourth straight day of gains. \nOthers, such as Starbucks ( SBUX ) CEO Howard Schultz, said Wednesday he was \"stunned\" by the election upset and called upon his staff to \"find the best version\" of themselves to move the country forward. \n\"Whether you are pleased or disappointed by the outcome, we each still have a choice,\" Schultz said in a memo. Just prior to the election, Schultz, who had endorsed Hillary Clinton, wrote to employees that he was anxious about the election and how divided the country had become. \nFacebook ( FB ) CEO Mark Zuckerberg late Wednesday night voiced his thoughts on the election on the social media site, tagging his post as \"feeling hopeful.\" Zuckerberg implored Americans to view the election as a call to create the \"world we want for our children.\" \n\"This work is bigger than any presidency and progress does not move in a straight line,\" Zuckerberg said. \"We are all blessed to have the ability to make the world better, and we have the responsibility to do it. Let's go work even harder.\" Prev 0 of 5 Next If you liked this article you might like ",

      "text": "× Starbucks rolls out its red holiday cups: see all 13 designs here \nStarbucks is giving a sneak preview of the 13 new designs set to adorn their red holiday cups, starting Thursday. \nThe designs include Christmas lights, candy canes, snowflakes and a reindeer, to name a few. Starbucks chose the winning designs from an Instagram contest that included submissions from more than a dozen countries. \n“We hope that this year’s red holiday cup designs express the shared spirit of the holidays as told by our customers,” said Sharon Rothstein, Starbucks global chief marketing officer. \nIt’s been a year since Starbucks rolled out solid red holiday cups with a minimalist logo, unwittingly sparking a backlash on Twitter as people accusing the Seattle company of waging a “war on Christmas.” Led by “American evangelist” Joshua Feuerstein, some customers told baristas their names were “Merry Christmas” so they could tweet photos of the cups with the holiday message written on them. \nStarbucks is sweetening the rollout of the new holiday cups in 2016 by offering a free drink of equal or lesser value between November 10-14, from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. See the full rules here . \nCheck out the 13 new designs Starbucks is rolling out on Thursday: (Starbucks) ",

Welcome to MY PAGE! My own little chunk of the World Wide Web. It's very exciting. My career started while in college at a little Top 40 station in Clare, Michigan (the Gateway to the North). Not only was I a weekend DJ, but I was also the station janitor. No kidding! I did what was needed to break into the biz, even if it included scrubbing toilets. After Clare, it was on to Saginaw, Michigan, a decade in Kalamazoo (yes, there really is...), north to Grand Rapids, and then here! I have a lovely wife, Kelcey, 3 kids, and a dog. I'm living the dream and so happy that you decided to visit my page. Please check in often! Social ",

      "text": "By: AFP | New York | Published:November 11, 2016 9:37 am PepsiCo chief executive Indra Nooyi congratulated Trump, but suggested he needs to set a much more inclusive tone. (Source: Reuters) \nChief executives from PepsiCo and Starbucks called for a renewed commitment to inclusion following a presidential campaign that exposed racial and ethnic fault lines in the US. PepsiCo chief executive Indra Nooyi, who backed Democrat Hillary Clinton, said she hoped President-elect Donald Trump’s controversial statements on immigrants and minorities during the election battle were “just campaign rhetoric.” \n“Our employees, especially our employees who are non-white or who are LGBT, are asking, ‘Are we safe?'” said Nooyi, who was born in India. “The first thing we have to do is assure everyone in the US that everyone is safe.” \nStarbucks chief executive Howard Schultz, who also backed Clinton, bemoaned the “vitriolic” nature of the campaign and said he was disturbed by some of the after-effects. “One has to be concerned with what’s happened over the last few months and even over the last 24 hours,” he said. \n“We’ve seen things that are very disturbing. I saw a picture today of a swastika. It’s difficult to understand.” The remarks came at the New York Times Dealbook conference on Thursday, held less than 48 hours after Trump’s shock win in the battle for the White House. Election returns showed Trump won large majorities with white voters, but badly lagged Clinton with minority groups. \nSocial media on Wednesday and Thursday recounted cases of immigrants and minorities facing bigotry in schools and stores. Thousands of anti-Trump protesters took to about 10 cities, some carrying signs declaiming “Not our President” and “Love trumps hate.” Nooyi congratulated Trump, but suggested he needs to set a much more inclusive tone. She also expressed disgust with Trump’s excuses following a leaked 2005 video in which the president-elect spoke lewdly about women. \nIn the clip, Trump described groping and forcing himself on women in vulgar, predatory language. “How dare we talk about women that way?” Nooyi said. “I don’t think there’s a place for that kind of talk, not in a locker room, not anywhere,” she said. “If we don’t nip this in the bud, it’s going to take over our society.” \nSchultz said he was shocked by the election result and that it reflects “years and years of a great many people in America feeling they’ve been left behind.” Starbucks briefly got into a tiff with Trump in late 2015 after the Republican mogul suggested the coffee chain should be boycotted over bright red holiday cups that contained no explicit Christmas imagery. Some evangelicals viewed the cups as anti-Christian. \nSchultz said he was baffled by the flap. “Every now and then you wake up and you say, ‘What?'” Schultz said. “The irony is we had our best Christmas ever and our business went up, so I thank him.” The Starbucks chief did not rule out a run for public office, but said he has no interest in serving in the Trump administration. “I don’t think that’s for me,” he said.

      "text": "Investors could have earned more than 7% on my previous recommendation. \nStarbucks’s revenue growth is lower-than-expected. \nThe net profit margin is also unsatisfactory. \nMy updated financial analysis shows that the stock’s fair value is even less than I expected. \nI recommend investors to SELL this stock again. The target price range is $40 - $49 per share. Ten months ago, I wrote my last report on Starbucks Corp. (NASDAQ: SBUX ). Since then, the stock price has plunged below $54 per share. With dividends of $0.60 per share, short-sellers earned more than 7%, if they had acted on my report . You can read the previous article here . Today, I would like to make a revise of my initial opinion. Diagram 1 ( Source : FinViz.com) Company profile I said in my last article that Starbucks's revenue is closely related to coffee prices. As you can see from Diagram 2, the price of coffee has increased by more than 36% year-over-year. According to my model, Starbucks's revenue should have increased by ~6.4% LTM. However, the result has been much better - over 7% over the period. Nevertheless, it is much less than what I expected in my last model. The short stock thesis implied a 20% sales growth in FY2016, while the actual forecast, based on LTM data, does not exceed 9%. Consequently, I want to lower my future projections: I expect revenue CAGR for FY2016-2022 to be around 4.5%, while my previous forecast was a little less than 17%. It is a big cut, in fact. However, it seems plausible, according to the recent trends. By the way, the China expansion is already priced into this growth. Diagram 2 ( Source : tradingeconomics.com ) Now let us turn to the margins. I see both positive and negative trends there (hereafter, look at Diagram 3). The positive trend is that margins in Q3 2016 have significantly improved. First, the gross profit margin continues to grow. Compared to FY2012 figure of 56.3%, the Q3 2016 value is 60.7%. The operating efficiency has caused the net profit margin to increase to 14.4%. It is at its highest value now since FY2012. However, the last-twelve-months' figures show that this quarter is more of a lucky one for Starbucks. The LTM net profit margin of 13% is much less than what I expected for FY2016 (my previous forecast was 14.2%). You can clearly see that the margins in the previous quarters were not great, either. According to these developments, I have lowered my margins forecast . In my last report, I expected the net profit margin to decrease from 14.2% in FY2016 to 13.2% in FY2022. Now, I expect it to decrease from 13.3% in FY2016 to 11.7% later on. Diagram 3 Click to enlarge ( Source : Morningstar.com) In view of the issues above, I think that Starbucks was deservedly considered a SELL. Let us see whether the status has changed given the selloff and new information. DCF Analysis My DCF model is presented in Diagram 4. In Diagram 5, you can see how different metrics of the Company are expected to change during this period. I have made and revised several assumptions, which can be seen in the \"Assumptions\" tab of my Excel file. My model shows that, after subtracting the market value of debt, minority interest, adding back cash and investments, and other issues the market value of equity is around $66.4B in the Base scenario. Consequently, the stock's fair value is around $44.44 per share. It is 20% lower than current share price ($53.600 per share). Diagram 4 ( Source : data - Morningstar.com, DCF model by author) Diagram 5 ( Source : data - Morningstar.com, model by author) Sensitivity Analysis My DCF analysis is based on a number of assumptions, which create a certain expectation of the share price. However, we need to see the entire picture and derive a range of possible prices. A few assumptions about WACC and the Terminal EV/EBITDA multiple give a plausible price range of $40 - $49 per share. It means that the stock has a downside risk of 9%-25%. Diagram 6 ( Source : data - Morningstar.com, model by author) Comparative Analysis My comparative analysis is based on four key ratios: P/E, P/S, P/BV, and EV/EBITDA (see Diagram 7). Most ratios indicate that the stock is overvalued by more than 10%, even if we use the top-25% of multiples. The company's current EV/EBITDA is 16.5x, which is higher than industry's average of 12.7x (according to Damodaran ). Hence, the stock looks overvalued. Diagram 7 ( Source : data - Morningstar.com, infographics by author) Zero-growth Analysis The zero-growth analysis has been described in one of my latest articles. You can read more about it here . According to this analysis, the current stock price does not show a margin of safety. The valuation gives a fair market value of equity of $57.98B, which translates into a fair price per share of $38.8. This price level is ~28% lower than the current level. If we only use net income in the numerator, the result will be ~$28 per share, which is 48% lower than the current price. Recommendation Starbucks Corp. has shown promising Q3 results. However, the revenue growth has slowed down significantly. Moreover, the net profit margin is lower than what I expected ten months before. My financial analysis, which is based on a number of reasonable assumptions, shows that the stock is overvalued. Hence, I reiterate my SELL recommendation and downgrade the stock even further. The new target price range is $40 - $ 49 per share. Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

      "text": "Instagram Downloads \nIn Kentucky, Starbucks district manager Shelley Henderson accumulates boxes of VIA® Instant Coffee and pounds of whole bean coffee for members of the 101st Airborne Division prior to their deployment from Fort Campbell to Afghanistan as the holidays approach. \nIn Texas, Starbucks partners (employees) assemble care packages for the members of the U.S. Air Force 59th Medical Wing stationed in Afghanistan and serve complementary coffee and pastries to the U.S. Army 32nd Medical Brigade at its monthly mentor motorcycle rides. \nIn Seattle, partners working at the Starbucks Support Center (headquarters) box up coffee, snacks and toiletries for members of the 502nd Military Intelligence Battalion deploying to Afghanistan from nearby Joint Base Lewis–McChord. \nThese partners represent 15 Starbucks regional districts around the United States that are participating in Adopt a Unit – an emerging Starbucks program designed to build a bond between partners and the military communities they serve. \n“The Adopt a Unit program solidifies to me that Starbucks genuinely supports and understands my way of life,” said Shannon Feltz, a military spouse who manages a Starbucks near Fort Campbell. “The trust and rapport we have built between our unit and our partners is priceless.” \nAdopt a Unit was inspired by feedback from veteran and military spouse partners, according to Matt Kress, manager of Veterans and Military Affairs for Starbucks. The program is an extension of an ongoing effort that, in the past year, delivered 40 pallets of whole bean coffee and 150,000 sticks of VIA to Armed Forces members. \n“Districts and groups within Starbucks are adopting military units that are deployed so they can help meet some of the needs of service members who are overseas, as well as help meet the needs of families that are back in the States,” said Kress. \nAmy Pappas, a Starbucks district manager in Virginia and wife of a Marine Corps veteran, said the program serves to “bring part of home to our troops.” \n“Everyone knows Starbucks and, for almost every customer, Starbucks is the third place,” Pappas said. “If we can help bring the third place to our members, we can bring a feeling of support and encouragement to them as well.” \nAdopt a Unit’s mission extends from partnering with veteran service organizations to hosting spouse support groups like Military Mondays , which provides veterans with pro bono legal assistance related to housing, education, employment, disability claims and healthcare issues. \nAnd, don’t underestimate the value of just getting a good cup of coffee to a soldier in the field, however, emphasized Kress, who served for 22 years in the Marine Corps. \n“You can’t imagine how excited they are to get coffee,” Kress said. “It makes a world of difference just to have a cup of Starbucks and a little taste of home when they’re far away.” On Veterans Day \nActive duty service members, reservists, veterans and military spouses are invited to enjoy a free Tall Brewed Coffee as a gesture of the company's appreciation for the military community's sacrifices and contributions. \nNow through November 11, for every Veterans Day Starbucks Card or eGift purchased , Starbucks will contribute $5 to help support programs that direct veterans to use their skills, experience and commitment to help create positive change in their communities: Team Rubicon, Team Red, White & Blue, and The Mission Continues. \nLearn more about how Starbucks is Paying Tribute and Creating Opportunities for service members, veterans and military spouses. \nThe following ad appears in several major newspapers. \nFor more information on this news release, contact Related News",

      "text": "Shutterstock GokGak \nIn Shakespeare's Macbeth, three witches stand on a high road, looking into the future to divulge to the approaching, ambitious warrior his fate. They present three opportunities for him to make history — but when their advice is not heeded, these risks lead to his downfall. \nOrganizations are now under intense scrutiny due to the environmental pressures of resource scarcity and the transition to a low-carbon economy. Stemming from this, three corporate risk profiles present opportunities to create wealth from within, but they also present untold pitfalls to companies who look out for their short-term benefit rather than adapting to serve society at large. \nAccording to the conversation from a GreenBiz webinar this week, the new risk profiles include stronger regulatory requirements for disclosure on sustainable practices; customer preferences cascading through supply chains (nearly instantly); and the growth of responsible investing. \nClearly, corporations must raise the profile of sustainability to guard customer reputation, engage employees, drive growth, manage risks, and keep up with financial markets. Yet they are struggling to plug quickly-changing sustainability measures into established financial modeling or enterprise risk management processes. \nIn order to do so, sustainability executives must build a business case for company-wide initiatives, frame sustainability opportunities and risk in the language of corporate business, and create allies with finance and risk leaders inside the company. A common language \n“The common framework for evaluating longer-term risks exists in the corporate language,” said Alex Wittenberg, executive director of Marsh & McLennan Companies’ Global Risk Center, during the webinar panel. “Sustainability professionals should provide that context and make sure it’s not separate. They need to translate the firm’s language into the sustainability world, not the other way around.” \nThe company’s commitment to sustainability started at the top, with the CEO’s concern about the responsibility of a for-profit company. \nA poll by risk and insurance consulting firm Marsh & McLennan shows a divide between financial and risk strategy agendas: 57 percent of finance and risk executives believe their organization has effectively integrated sustainability risk into risk management and reporting, while 72 percent of sustainability executives disagree. Meanwhile, 59 percent of finance and risk executives believe their organization’s finance and risk management teams effectively work with sustainability programs, while only 20 percent of sustainability executives agree. \nWhen a sustainability professional links resilience issues to an organization’s KPIs and metrics, Wittenberg said “the issues you’re championing will go much farther.” Embedding sustainability into existing operational and strategic breaks down silos of information and perspective within companies, helps long-term strategic scenario planning and helps price externalities into the budget — like planning for an internal carbon price. \nOne of the challenges here is that sustainability risk horizons span three to five years, as opposed to most corporate risk assessments of six to 18 months. One of the simplest ways to educate the organization about sustainability risks and opportunities, said Wittenberg, is to “talk to the people and the heads of the ERM committee about what their top risks are.” Invest in environmental and social factors \nStarbucks Treasurer Drew Wolff said that his role is to be both the “bank account and the wallet” of the global company with more than 300,000 employees and billions of dollars in market cap. He borrows and invests money, protects cash, takes care of short-term liquidity and long-term financial needs, and hedges foreign risks and commodities. \nThe company’s investments consider environmental, social, and corporate governance factors, and include a robust portfolio of green and sustainability bonds. \nAkamai’s guiding principles for renewable energy procurement are they are impactful, aligned with customers’ expectations and cost effective, said David Neshat, its treasurer. \n“The conventional wisdom is that excluding anything hurts returns, but you can craft sustainable portfolios with similar risks and returns to passive benchmarks,” he said. “The growing area of green and sustainable bonds are like any other. It amounts to some additional reporting, issuing debt securities to investors with an explicit use of proceeds for green or social purposes, and is governed by the ‘green bond principles’” demanded by investors and stakeholders. \nThe use of proceeds outside renewable energy (such as agricultural, social and educational purposes) is a broader sustainability category, but Starbucks also has broader sustainability strategies of supporting sustainable coffee economy, “green retail” in LEED-certified stores, and educational pathways for its employees. \nThe company’s commitment to sustainability started at the top, with the CEO’s concern about the responsibility of a for-profit company. It’s trickled down to being a key part of Starbucks’ investing portfolio. \n“We talked to investors we hadn’t talked to before,” said Wolff. “We had 40 new investors involved in this $500 million, 10-year bond.” Bond proceeds expand the program. The company has received numerous internal and external benefits, showed how finance and public policy can commit to working together, fostered new internal dialogue and ideas. Explore new financing models \nThe Treasurer of Akamai, one high-growth technology company with more than $2.2 billion in revenue, discussed its plans to cover 50% of electricity consumption using renewable energy by 2020 and reduce absolute Scope 2 and 3 emissions below 2015 levels. \nAkamai’s guiding principles for renewable energy procurement are they are impactful, aligned with customers’ expectations and cost effective, said David Neshat, its treasurer. \nOnce the risk gap was bridged in favor of investing in clean energy, “it was a no-brainer.” \nTheir executive process to transition to clean energy is to: Estimate renewable energy procurement requirements based on regional network energy and grid renewables growth Identify and build financial models for candidate projects in key U.S. power markets where Akamai has concentrated energy usage Implement multi-year phased procurement of renewable energy in these markets Present and seek approval from its board of directors Monitor opportunities for non-U.S. renewable energy procurement \nAkamai also turned to a “contract for differences” (CFD), 15 to 20-year agreements to purchase electricity and renewable energy certificates at a fixed price for a particular renewable energy project such as a solar farm. Generated electricity is sold into the market, and Akamai pays or receives the difference between the average monthly market price and fixed price. The company then retains the certificate. \nMonthly gains or losses are accounted for, presenting as a “hedge” against rising fossil fuel electricity prices that are factored into ongoing colocation data center expenses. \n“The financial impact is that there are no up-front cash flows,” said Neshat, who spoke about Akamai’s CFD program for the first time at the GreenBiz webcast. “It’s a great solution for the company; we can be impactful while managing financials as we would for our shareholders.” \n“At first, as a high-tech, high-growth company, you want to be mindful of capital,” he continued. But once the risk gap was bridged in favor of investing in clean energy, “it was a no-brainer.” \nThe transition to clean energy is an inevitable road driven by market forces and consumer demand. Companies are making this transition in many ways, and as the bridge between sustainability and financial risk is closed, the risks themselves turn into opportunities rich with environmental and social benefits.

In this Tuesday, Nov. 8, 2016, photo, Starbucks holiday cups appear on display at a store in New York. (AP Photo/Joseph Pisani). In this Tuesday, Nov. 8, 2016, photo, Starbucks holiday cups appear on display at a store in New York. \nBy JOSEPH PISANIAP Business Writer \nNEW YORK (AP) - Instead of looking to its creative team, Starbucks turned to its latte-sipping customers to design its latest holiday red cups. \nThe company asked people to post their designs on Instagram last December, and 1,200 ideas came in from customers who've made it clear on social media they care about the holiday cups Starbucks has brought out each year for nearly two decades. \nOver the next several months, company executives narrowed down the options to their favorites, Starbucks said Wednesday. They settled on 13 overall, which focus on traditional holiday themes like snowflakes, Santa Claus and reindeer. \nThe cups will hit stores around the world Thursday, with eleven of them available in U.S. locations. All the cups for hot drinks are red and have white designs featuring candy canes, ornaments or other holiday symbols. The one cup for iced drinks has a wreath wrapped around the Starbucks mermaid logo. The company declined to say if the customers were compensated for the designs. \nStarbucks' return to more overt holiday imagery comes after a tempest last year when a more subdued cup - bright red on top, shading to a darker cranberry below - drew criticism from some who said the chain was part of a so-called war on Christmas. \nThousands of people sounded off on Twitter and other social networks. Donald Trump, now president-elect, even suggested perhaps people should boycott the chain. \nThat controversy came as a surprise to the company, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz said at an event in New York on Wednesday where the new designs were displayed. \n\"It's just a cup,\" he joked. \nStarbucks Corp. has released holiday cups every year since 1997. Last week, the Seattle-based company also unveiled a green cup ahead of Election Day that it said was \"a symbol of unity.\" It features a mosaic of more than 100 people, including a coffee farmer and barista. \nOnce again, though, people took to social media to make it known - they wanted red cups. \nContact Joseph Pisani at http://twitter.com/josephpisani .

      "text": "November 11,   \nAfter complaints from Christians who couldn’t handle a red cup last year, and those who couldn’t deal with ( obviously anti-God) green cups this year, Starbucks has announced it will launch a series of ten holiday-themed cups, one of which includes a Nativity scene: \nAre you happy Joshua Feuerstein ? Or are the other nine cups an assault on your faith? There’s no word on his site as of this writing. He’s too busy celebrating the anointing of Jesus Trump. \nBut if there’s one thing conservative Christians hate more than being ignored, it’s being treated as equals with people who think differently, so expect those complaints soon.",

      "text": "Buzz Here's why Starbucks' Christmas cups are even more special this year The company ditched its 'one cup for the festive season' policy to go with the designs made by 13 women from six countries. A + A - Starbucks launched 13 red cups for the festive season this year. Picture courtesy: Twitter/starbucksnews \nIf you're a Starbucks fan, you must have heard of the uproar over the minimalist red cup the coffee chain launched for its holiday season last year. The usual pretty green cup turned plain red to mark the coming of Christmas, but not many enjoyed it. \nIn case you didn't know, Starbucks first launched the holiday cup in 1997. Since then, the red cup has become symbolic of Christmas season in the US of A. So wen the crowds saw the bare red cup hat was released last year, they lost their cool. \nThis year, the red cup has returned. And before you jump to any conclusions, it's not bare like last year. The new cups were launched on 10 November. Picture courtesy: Twitter/starbucksnews \nIn fact, a number of customers reacted to the bare red cup by drawing Christmas-themed sketches on them. What Starbucks as done this year is to select the 13 best cups drawn out by customers, mass produced them, and launched them as this year's holiday cups! \nAlso read: Attention tea lovers! Your humble cuppa has just got a five-star makeover \nThe selected 13 cups were designed by these women from six different countries: Birds & Flowers, by Florencia from Bandung, Indonesia; Holiday Lights, by Maria Lauren from New York City, United States; Birch Forest, by Chloe from Plainfield, Illinois, United States; Candy Canes,Jennifer from Seattle, United States; Ornaments, by Anz Soza from Dubai, United Arab Emirates; Woodland Deer, by Samantha from Broomall, Pennsylvania, United States; Love and Joy, by Anna from Toronto, Canada; Poinsettia, by Christina from Bakersfield, California, United States; Graphic Swirls, by Erica from Markham, Ontario, Canada; Snowflake Sweater, by Alisa from St. Petersburg, Russia; Evergreen Forest, by Bronwyn from Moscow, Idaho, United States; Sleigh Ride, by Eun Joo from Daejeon, South Korea; and Wooden Wreath, by Tracy from Los Angeles, United States. The new holiday cups were designed by 13 women from six countries. Picture courtesy: Instagram/amillee_secondhand \nThat's the story behind these 13 beautiful holiday cups, which have already hit the stores in America on 10 November(the very day Donald Trump emerged as the President-elect). \nIn case you're wondering why the cups were released on this particular day, you should know this--according to a report by Business Insider , the Starbucks CEO, Howard Schultz, endorsed Hillary Clinton's candidacy back in September. On 10 November, he was reported to be left aghast by the election results, and encouraged his employees to move 'onward together'. \nPerhaps, the cups are meant to bring in some joy into the world at a time when we need it the most? \nWhatever the reason, these 13 red holiday cups are here to stay, and we hope to see them in India soon.

      "text": "Email \nSEATTLE — Starbucks is giving a sneak preview of the 13 new designs set to adorn their red holiday cups, starting Thursday. \nThe designs include Christmas lights, candy canes, snowflakes and a reindeer, to name a few. Starbucks chose the winning designs from an Instagram contest that included submissions from more than a dozen countries. \n“We hope that this year’s red holiday cup designs express the shared spirit of the holidays as told by our customers,” said Sharon Rothstein, Starbucks global chief marketing officer. \nIt has been a year since Starbucks rolled out solid red holiday cups with a minimalist logo, unwittingly sparking a backlash on Twitter as people accusing the Seattle company of waging a “war on Christmas.” It's September, when does the War on Christmas start? Get ready @Starbucks pic.twitter.com/8Id9YW5kAl \n— (((tramosUSA))) (@voteblue16) September 7, 2016 \nLed by “American evangelist” Joshua Feuerstein, some customers told baristas their names were “Merry Christmas” so they could tweet photos of the cups with the holiday message written on them. \nStarbucks is sweetening the rollout of the new holiday cups in 2016 by offering a free drink of equal or lesser value between Nov. 10-14, from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. \nCheck out the 13 new designs Starbucks is rolling out on Thursday.

We crafted coffee. You made it art. Cups warm a hand, beauty warms the heart. #RedCups pic.twitter.com/3QmdvoNM0S \n— Starbucks Coffee (@Starbucks) November 10, 2016 \nSince 1997, Starbucks has celebrated the holiday season with their special red cups. \nThis year, for the first time ever, Starbucks red cups featured 13 new designs created by loyal customers. \n“We hope that this year’s red holiday cup designs express the shared spirit of the holidays as told by our customers,” said Sharon Rothstein, Starbucks global chief marketing officer. \nIt’s been a year since Starbucks rolled out solid red holiday cups with a minimalist logo, unwittingly sparking a backlash on Twitter as people accusing the Seattle company of waging a “war on Christmas.” It's September, when does the War on Christmas start? Get ready @Starbucks pic.twitter.com/8Id9YW5kAl \n— (((tramosUSA))) (@voteblue16) September 7, 2016 \nLed by “American evangelist” Joshua Feuerstein, some customers told baristas their names were “Merry Christmas” so they could tweet photos of the cups with the holiday message written on them. \nStarbucks is sweetening the rollout of the new holiday cups in 2016 by offering a free drink of equal or lesser value between November 10-14, from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. See the full rules here . \nCheck out the 13 new designs Starbucks is rolling out on Thursday: (Starbucks) ",

      "text": "By JOSEPH PISANI\nAP Business Writer NEW YORK (AP) - Snowflakes, Santa Claus and reindeer are returning to Starbucks' holiday cups this year, after last year's more subdued red cups caused an uproar from critics who said the chain was part of a so-called war on Christmas.\nIn all, 13 different cups will hit stores around the world Thursday. Eleven of them will be available in U.S. shops. The cups were designed by customers who uploaded pictures of their designs on Instagram last year, the company said Wednesday.\nStarbucks Corp. has released holiday cups every year since 1997. The outcry over 2015's plainer red cup grew after now President-elect Donald Trump suggested boycotting the chain.\nThe company was surprised by last year's controversy, CEO Howard Schultz said at an event in New York on Wednesday where the designs were displayed.\n\"It's just a cup,\" he joked.\nFor the holiday cups, the company said it received 1,200 designs from customers online and narrowed them down. All the cups for hot drinks are red and have white designs featuring candy canes, ornaments or other holiday symbols. The one cup for iced drinks has a wreath wrapped around the Starbucks mermaid logo. The company declined to say if the customers were compensated for the designs.\nLast week, the Seattle-based company also unveiled a green cup ahead of Election Day that it said was \"a symbol of unity.\"",

Cups for hot beverages are all red and white and feature such holiday staples as candy canes and ornaments, with the one cold cup featuring Starbucks’ usual logo surrounded by a wreath. \nAs for CEO Howard Schultz he still doesn’t understand what the big deal was last year or this year. He notes, “ it’s just a cup .” \n",

      "text": "PepsiCo, Starbucks CEOs call for inclusion after Trump win   12:24pm PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi has expressed her disapproval of Donald Trump's predatory comments about women. Photo: FABRICE COFFRINI / AFP \nNEW YORK - Chief executives from PepsiCo and Starbucks called on Thursday for a renewed commitment to inclusion following a presidential campaign that exposed racial and ethnic fault lines in the US. \nPepsiCo chief executive Indra Nooyi, who backed Democrat Hillary Clinton, said she hoped President-elect Donald Trump's controversial statements on immigrants and minorities during the election battle were \"just campaign rhetoric\". \n\"Our employees, especially our employees who are non-white or who are LGBT, are asking, 'Are we safe?'\" said Nooyi, who was born in India. \n\"The first thing we have to do is assure everyone in the US that everyone is safe.\" \nStarbucks chief executive Howard Schultz, who also backed Clinton, bemoaned the \"vitriolic\" nature of the campaign and said he was disturbed by some of the after-effects. \n\"One has to be concerned with what's happened over the last few months and even over the last 24 hours,\" he said. \n\"We've seen things that are very disturbing. I saw a picture today of a swastika. It's difficult to understand.\" \nThe remarks came at the New York Times Dealbook conference, held less than 48 hours after Trump's shock win in the battle for the White House. Election returns showed Trump won large majorities with white voters, but badly lagged Clinton with minority groups. \nSocial media on Wednesday and Thursday recounted cases of immigrants and minorities facing bigotry in schools and stores. Thousands of anti-Trump protesters took to about 10 cities, some carrying signs declaiming \"Not our President\" and \"Love trumps hate.\" \nNooyi congratulated Trump, but suggested he needs to set a much more inclusive tone. She also expressed disgust with Trump's excuses following a leaked 2005 video in which the president-elect spoke lewdly about women. \nIn the clip, Trump described groping and forcing himself on women in vulgar, predatory language. \n\"How dare we talk about women that way?\" Nooyi said. \"I don't think there's a place for that kind of talk, not in a locker room, not anywhere,\" she said. \n\"If we don't nip this in the bud, it's going to take over our society.\" \nSchultz said he was shocked by the election result and that it reflected \"years and years of a great many people in America feeling they've been left behind\". \nStarbucks briefly got into a tiff with Trump in late 2015 after the Republican mogul suggested the coffee chain should be boycotted over bright red holiday cups that contained no explicit Christmas imagery. \nSome evangelicals viewed the cups as anti-Christian. Schultz said he was baffled by the flap. \n\"Every now and then you wake up and you say, 'What?'\" Schultz said. \n\"The irony is we had our best Christmas ever and our business went up, so I thank him.\" \nThe Starbucks chief did not rule out a run for public office, but said he has no interest in serving in the Trump administration. \n\"I don't think that's for me,\" he said. iNet Bridge",

      "title": "Starbucks: How One Man Manufactured Moral Outrage Over Holiday Cups",
      "text": "EMAIL Shutterstock \nYesterday, Starbucks revealed a product which they hope will foster community in an increasingly fractured world. No, it’s not liquid MDMA, flavored with gingerbread and topped whipped cream ( although come to think of it… ). The product is a cup. 13 cups, to be more precise. These cups had been hotly rumored ever since the chain’s green cup was released a week ago. Some people loved the green , others hated it, but one thing became epically clear: As a nation, we really give a f*ck about the kinds of cups our corporate coffee overlords use to signify Christmastime. \nBoth the crowdsourced red cups and the artist-drawn green cup were direct responses to the media-driven cup firestorm of 2015. Remember it ? There was faux panic, a lot of pageantry, and at least a few real live people who thought that their religion was being attacked . All because Starbucks — a multinational, multi-billion dollar corporation whose sole intent is to make money off drinks which are more sugar than bean water — didn’t slap Jesus Christ on their beverage receptacles. (Or, you know, at least Santa). \nBut how did the whole “red cup” debacle actually happen? How does a story like that take hold of the national consciousness? And was anyone really outraged in the first place? \nThe whole saga seems to have been driven by two major forces: \nI. As Vox points out , for some people the holiday cup from Starbucks doesn’t just represent another empty piece of merchandising, it represents the fact that Christian values are being upheld during one of the most treasured of all holidays. When you take that away, even if what’s being taken away is a snowflake or a reindeer (clearly important biblical figures), it implies that a group’s fundamental beliefs are somehow being desecrated. And that’s been known to get people scared. \nThese people see a lack of prominent Christian symbology on a paper cup as an attack on the Christian values that built our nation. So for a certain breed of evangelicals, it was a Big Deal (and played into a long-simmering martyr syndrome). \nII. Like any movement, this java-based rebellion needed a charismatic leader to speak to the people about the slings and arrows they were suffering. In this case, the mantle was taken up by Joshua Feuerstein — a former pastor and internet celebrity (?) with a checkered past. It’s endless fun to unpack Feuerstein’s career , but the quick highlights include harassing a bakery that wouldn’t fill a troll request for an anti-gay cake, taking money from his followers without accounting for it, and suggesting we solve all the things we don’t like with guns. According to The Daily Kos — and an entire website created just to expose the pastor’s scheming ways — Feuerstein is a rich guy with a persecution complex, who gets off on crying discrimination (anti-religious, anti-heterosexual, anti-white, etc.) when he doesn’t get his way. \nBased on the man’s YouTube page, he is discriminated against pretty often. But no braying was louder than the ugly-crying he did in 2015, when he made his most popular video to date. On November 5th, 2015, Feuerstein went viral after he could not bear the injustice of both an ombre red cup and not being wished a “Merry Christmas” as he completed his purchase at Starbucks. Feuerstein took this to mean that chain’s employees could not even mention the name of the holiday (not true, Starbucks even sells a Christmas blend right in their stores ) and had no choice but to don a backwards baseball cap and make a video claiming that he’d “tricked” the store by telling them that his name was “Merry Christmas” and forcing them into showing fealty to him and his lord. \nMeanwhile in reality: Some bored barista just thought “Ugh, this dude” and called him “Merry Christmas” to get the transaction over with. Because when a loud dude in a Jesus shirt walks in and demands you wish them the holliest jolliest Christmas while also packing a weapon (yep, he proudly brought his gun into Starbucks!) you kind of just do what he says and hope for the best.

Snowflakes, reindeer and candy canes are back on Starbucks holiday coffee cups, after last year’s plain red cups caused uproar from critics who said the chain was part of a so-called war on Christmas. (AP Photo/Joseph Pisani) \nSEATTLE (MEDIA GENERAL) — Remember last year’s red cup controversy? Starbucks has made sure it won’t happen again, debuting 13 winter- and holiday-themed red cups Thursday. We crafted coffee. You made it art. Cups warm a hand, beauty warms the heart. #RedCups pic.twitter.com/3QmdvoNM0S \n— Starbucks Coffee (@Starbucks) November 10, 2016 \nThe 13 designs were created by customers from across the world and include images of holiday lights, snowflakes and snow-covered trees, as well as Christmas scenes featuring reindeer and sleighs. Red paper cups, for hot drinks, are stacked next to plastic cups at a Starbucks coffee shop in the Pike Place Market, Tuesday, Nov. 10, 2015, in Seattle. (AP Photo/Elaine Thompson) \nLast year, Starbucks’ two-tone ombre red cups caused quite a stir on social media because they weren’t decorated for the holiday as they had been in previous years. \nSome critics called the cups another example of the ongoing “war on Christmas.” \nJoshua Feuerstein, an American evangelist and former pastor, claimed Starbucks “removed Christmas” from their cups. His video rant was viewed more than 17 million times on Facebook. \n“We hope that this year’s red holiday cup designs express the shared spirit of the holidays as told by our customers,” said Sharon Rothstein, Starbucks global chief marketing officer, said in a release . \nThe 13 distinct cups are now in more than 25,000 Starbucks stores in 75 countries for the 2016 holiday season. 2016 Starbucks red cups ",

      "text": "Starbucks turns to customers for annual holiday cup designs JOSEPH PISANI, AP Business Writer Published: November 10, 2016, 11:36 am Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) In this Tuesday, Nov. 8, 2016, photo, Starbucks holiday cups appear on display at a store in New York. Snowflakes, reindeer and candy canes are back on Starbucks holiday coffee cups, after last year’s plain red cups caused uproar from critics who said the chain was part of a so-called war on Christmas. (AP Photo/Joseph Pisani) \nNEW YORK (AP) — Instead of looking to its creative team, Starbucks turned to its latte-sipping customers to design its latest holiday red cups. \nThe company asked people to post their designs on Instagram last December, and 1,200 ideas came in from customers who’ve made it clear on social media they care about the holiday cups Starbucks has brought out each year for nearly two decades. \nOver the next several months, company executives narrowed down the options to their favorites, Starbucks said Wednesday. They settled on 13 overall, which focus on traditional holiday themes like snowflakes, Santa Claus and reindeer. \nThe cups will hit stores around the world Thursday, with eleven of them available in U.S. locations. All the cups for hot drinks are red and have white designs featuring candy canes, ornaments or other holiday symbols. The one cup for iced drinks has a wreath wrapped around the Starbucks mermaid logo. The company declined to say if the customers were compensated for the designs. \nStarbucks’ return to more overt holiday imagery comes after a tempest last year when a more subdued cup — bright red on top, shading to a darker cranberry below — drew criticism from some who said the chain was part of a so-called war on Christmas. \nThousands of people sounded off on Twitter and other social networks. Donald Trump, now president-elect, even suggested perhaps people should boycott the chain. \nThat controversy came as a surprise to the company, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz said at an event in New York on Wednesday where the new designs were displayed. \n“It’s just a cup,” he joked. \nStarbucks Corp. has released holiday cups every year since 1997. Last week, the Seattle-based company also unveiled a green cup ahead of Election Day that it said was “a symbol of unity.” It features a mosaic of more than 100 people, including a coffee farmer and barista. \nOnce again, though, people took to social media to make it known — they wanted red cups.

      "text": "SEATTLE (MEDIA GENERAL) — Remember last year’s red cup controversy? Starbucks has made sure it won’t happen again, debuting 13 winter- and holiday-themed red cups Thursday.\nWe crafted coffee. You made it art. Cups warm a hand, beauty warms the heart. #RedCups pic.twitter.com/3QmdvoNM0S \n— Starbucks Coffee (@Starbucks) November 10, 2016 \n\nThe 13 designs were created by customers from across the world and include images of holiday lights, snowflakes and snow-covered trees, as well as Christmas scenes featuring reindeer and sleighs.\nRed paper cups, for hot drinks, are stacked next to plastic cups at a Starbucks coffee shop in the Pike Place Market, Tuesday, Nov. 10, 2015, in Seattle. (AP Photo/Elaine Thompson) Last year, Starbucks’ two-tone ombre red cups caused quite a stir on social media because they weren’t decorated for the holiday as they had been in previous years.\nSome critics called the cups another example of the ongoing “war on Christmas.”\nJoshua Feuerstein, an American evangelist and former pastor, claimed Starbucks “removed Christmas” from their cups. His video rant was viewed more than 17 million times on Facebook.\n“We hope that this year’s red holiday cup designs express the shared spirit of the holidays as told by our customers,” said Sharon Rothstein, Starbucks global chief marketing officer, said in a release .\nThe 13 distinct cups are now in more than 25,000 Starbucks stores in 75 countries for the 2016 holiday season.",

Get our free coverage by signing up to: \nhttp://www.activewallst.com/registration-3/?symbol=SHAK \nEarnings Reviewed \nFor the three months ended on October 02nd, 2016, Starbucks' consolidated net revenues were $5.7 billion, an increase of 16% over Q4 FY15, topping the $5.68 billion revenue forecasted by analysts. The increase was primarily driven by the impact of the 53rd week in Q4 FY16, incremental revenues from the opening of 2,042 net new stores over the past 12 months, and a 4% increase in global comparable store sales. \nThe company's consolidated operating income grew 27% to $1.23 billion in Q4 FY16, up from $969.4 million in Q4 FY15. Consolidated operating margin expanded 180 basis points to 21.5% primarily due to sales leverage, the impact of the 53rd week in Q4 FY16, and lower commodity costs, primarily coffee. For Q4 FY16, Starbucks' net income surged 23% to $801 million, or $0.54 per share. On an adjusted basis, the company reported earnings of $0.56 per share, which was above its projected range and also ahead of analysts' estimates of $0.55 per share. Revenue rose 16% to $5.71 billion. \nRegion Results \nDuring Q4 FY16, net revenues for Starbucks' Americas segment surged 17% on a y-o-y basis to $4.0 billion in Q4 FY16. The increase was driven by the impact of the 53rd week in Q4 FY16, a 5% increase in comparable store sales, and incremental revenues from 804 net new store openings over the past 12 months. The increase in U.S. comparable store sales was comprised of 6% increase in average ticket and 1% decrease in traffic. Mobile Order and Pay represented 6% of U.S. transactions in the reported quarter. The region's operating income of $1.10 billion in Q4 FY16 advanced 30% versus $840.6 million in Q4 FY15. Operating margin of 27.6% expanded 280 basis points primarily due to sales leverage and the impact of the 53rd week in Q4 FY16. \nStarbucks' net revenues from the China/Asia/Pacific segment soared 29% over the prior year's period to $839.2 million in Q4 FY16. The increase was primarily driven by incremental revenues from 981 net new store openings over the past 12 months, the impact of the 53rd week in Q4 FY16, and favorable foreign currency translation. The regions operating income grew 48% over Q4 FY15 to $192.4 million in the reported quarter. Operating margin expanded 300 basis points to 22.9%. Net revenues from Starbucks' EMEA segment fell 12% to $270.2 million in Q4 FY16. Operating income decreased 14% to $45.8 million in Q4 FY16, down from $53.1 million in the year earlier quarter. Operating margin declined 20 basis points to 17.0%, primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency exchange and sales deleverage in certain company-operated stores. \nStarbuck's net revenues from the Channel Development segment grew 14% over the prior year's period to $518.5 million in Q4 FY16. Operating income of $244.3 million in Q4 FY16 increased 24% compared to Q4 FY15. Operating margin increased 390 basis points to 47.1%, primarily driven by lower coffee costs and higher income from the North American Coffee Partnership. \nThe company opened 690 net new stores in Q4 FY16, bringing total stores to 25,085 in 75 countries worldwide. The company opened 2,042 net new stores globally in FY16, including the first Starbucks stores in Cambodia, Kazakhstan, Luxembourg, Andorra, South Africa, Slovakia, and Trinidad and Tobago. \nOutlook \nFor FY17, Starbucks is forecasting earnings of $2.12 per share to $2.14 per share, below the $2.16 per share predicted by analysts. The company also expects revenues to grow in the double digits with mid-single digit comparable store sales growth globally. \nStock Performance \nAt the closing bell, on Thursday, November 08, 2016, Starbucks' stock slipped 1.85%, ending the trading session at $53.57.

But what if you want to try something a little different, or you want to get away from the SMU crowd? Well, we’ve got you covered. We’ve listed our top five favorite coffee shops in the area, that don’t come with a mermaid logo and a misspelled name. Mudsmith: located on lower Greenville, this place is great because you can grab a sandwich here, or walk right over to HG Supply Co. or Snuffer’s for lunch. They have great coffee, and make cute designs that are totally Insta worthy. Royal Blue Grocery: a cute, eclectic grocery store with good wifi and the best green tea. What could be better? The awesome availability of snacks. This chain is originally from Austin, but each store is catered to its own neighborhood. Ascension: also serves the best avocado toast for brunch. It can get crowded here, but they have a fun selection of drinks, like coffee with sparkling water, so just try to not go at peak times. Union Coffee : the other old, traditional favorite. Parking can be scarce, but it’s also walkable. They have couches, the best dirty chai tea, and a great atmosphere to hang out or study. Drip Coffee Company: located on Lover’s, this place is close too. They brag on their high-quality coffee from small, family-owned states from all over the world. What I like is the bright, simple atmosphere that makes it hard to get distracted. \nGetting away from the same five places everyone frequents can be really great. Hopefully, this list will help you find a place that you love, and maybe even broaden your coffee horizons. The best coffee shop certainly comes with a friendly face, a cool environment, and a unique drink. \nSave Save",

      "text": "print \nNEW YORK (AP) — Instead of looking to its creative team, Starbucks turned to its latte-sipping customers to design its latest holiday red cups. \nThe company asked people to post their designs on Instagram last December, and 1,200 ideas came in from customers who've made it clear on social media they care about the holiday cups Starbucks has brought out each year for nearly two decades. \nOver the next several months, company executives narrowed down the options to their favorites, Starbucks said Wednesday. They settled on 13 overall, which focus on traditional holiday themes like snowflakes, Santa Claus and reindeer. \nThe cups will hit stores around the world Thursday, with eleven of them available in U.S. locations. All the cups for hot drinks are red and have white designs featuring candy canes, ornaments or other holiday symbols. The one cup for iced drinks has a wreath wrapped around the Starbucks mermaid logo. The company declined to say if the customers were compensated for the designs. \nStarbucks' return to more overt holiday imagery comes after a tempest last year when a more subdued cup — bright red on top, shading to a darker cranberry below — drew criticism from some who said the chain was part of a so-called war on Christmas. \nThousands of people sounded off on Twitter and other social networks. Donald Trump, now president-elect, even suggested perhaps people should boycott the chain. \nThat controversy came as a surprise to the company, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz said at an event in New York on Wednesday where the new designs were displayed. \n\"It's just a cup,\" he joked. \nStarbucks Corp. has released holiday cups every year since 1997. Last week, the Seattle-based company also unveiled a green cup ahead of Election Day that it said was \"a symbol of unity.\" It features a mosaic of more than 100 people, including a coffee farmer and barista. \nOnce again, though, people took to social media to make it known — they wanted red cups. \n\nContact Joseph Pisani at http://twitter.com/josephpisani .

(Joshua Trujillo, Starbucks) × Starbucks unveils 2016 red cups: Signs of the holidays unmistakable Starbucks red holiday cups photographed on November 9, 2016. (Joshua Trujillo, Starbucks) \nSEATTLE — Red cups are back at Starbucks — and they’re looking a lot more like Christmas this year. \nThe coffee company introduced its new holiday cups in stores Thursday morning. They feature 13 seasonal illustrations created by customers from six countries. \nAmong them are classic holiday images like reindeer, ornaments and snow-covered landscapes, marking a return to a more traditional and overtly Christmas-inspired promotion. Last year’s red cups drew controversy for abandoning seasonal designs in favor of a simple, two-toned red cup. \nStarbucks said at the time that it wanted a “purity of design that welcomes all of our stories.” Critics called it a declaration of war on Christmas. \nThe new designs were culled from more than 1,000 submissions Starbucks received last December when it asked customers to share designs on Instagram. \nStarbucks says it asked a small group of customers to mail in their cup so they could be reviewed for potential production. \nThe return of the red cup has been rumored for more than a week, after fans began noticing boxes at Starbucks stores labeled “no peeking” until Thursday. \nStarbucks didn’t comment on its red cup plans at the time, and instead unveiled a pre-election, limited edition green “unity” cup that CEO Howard Schultz called “a reminder of our shared values” during a “divisive time in our country.” \nCheck out all 13 new designs below: (Starbucks) ",

Starbucks chose the winning designs from an Instagram contest that included submissions from more than a dozen countries. \n“We hope that this year’s red holiday cup designs express the shared spirit of the holidays as told by our customers,” said Sharon Rothstein, Starbucks global chief marketing officer. \nIt’s been a year since Starbucks rolled out solid red holiday cups with a minimalist logo, unwittingly sparking a backlash on Twitter as people accusing the Seattle company of waging a “war on Christmas.” It's September, when does the War on Christmas start? Get ready @Starbucks pic.twitter.com/8Id9YW5kAl \n— (((tramosUSA))) (@voteblue16) September 7, 2016 \nLed by “American evangelist” Joshua Feuerstein, some customers told baristas their names were “Merry Christmas” so they could tweet photos of the cups with the holiday message written on them. \nStarbucks is sweetening the roll out of the new holiday cups in 2016 by offering a free drink of equal or lesser value between November 10-14, from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. See the full rules here . \nCheck out the 13 new designs Starbucks is rolling out on Thursday: (Starbucks) ",

      "text": "× Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz urges ‘dignity’ during ‘epic, unseemly election’ \nSEATTLE — Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz is urging his employees to embrace “respect and dignity” in the face of an “epic, unseemly election.” \nSchultz has publicly endorsed Democrat Hillary Clinton for president. But the letter, obtained by CNNMoney on Sunday, does not suggest that Starbucks employees vote for a particular candidate on election day. \nInstead, Schultz wrote that he feels “a bit anxious” about the pending election, and asked his employees to share “kindness, compassion, empathy” and love. \n“Let’s each embrace the universal virtues of respect and dignity, refusing to allow the hatred on cable news, the ugliness of our politics, and the lack of political role models for our kids to define us and to dictate how we treat each other,” Schultz wrote. \nSchultz, who calls himself a “life-long Democrat,” endorsed Clinton during an interview with CNN’s Poppy Harlow in September. The executive had previously endorsed Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012. \nOnline records show he has only donated to Democrats, except for a donation to Republican Senator John McCain in the late 1990s. \nSchultz also did not discount the possibility of his own presidential run. He told CNN in September that he would “never say never, but this is not the right time.” \nStarbucks recently launched a new initiative countering the “divisiveness and cynicism currently fueling our national discourse.” \nThe company released a series of videos and stories this year called “Upstanders” that focuses on moments of humanity in the country. \nAnd last week, Starbucks rolled out a limited edition green “unity” cup to its stores. \n“Like the drawing of so many faces with a single, unbroken line on this season’s green unity cup,” Schultz wrote in his Sunday letter, “we are all connected.” 47.606209 -122.332071 ",

Operating income of $244.3 million in Q4 FY16 increased 24% compared to Q4 FY15.

      "text": "12:24am Share this article \nAs I entered Starbucks, a place where I have been plenty of times before, I grew anxious. I looked around me. Nearly all the seats were taken, so I couldn’t experience my new drink order here. \nThankfully, the line was long enough for me to regain my composure. Pumpkin Spice Latte, Pumpkin Spice Latte, Pumpkin Spice Latte. PSL, PSL, PSL. I thought I might forget the name if I don’t repeat it like a mantra over 10 times. As the people in front of me quickly continued forward, I looked around to see if I would run into anyone I know. I didn’t want anybody to know I was going to get a PSL. I didn’t want anybody to think I was “basic.” \nConfession time: I “basic” shame. Whenever I see girls get Pumpkin Spice Lattes, buy Starbucks a bit too often, wear leggings as pants, or do any other stereotypically “basic” things I roll my eyes. I don’t even know why. There is no rational reason behind this type of shaming, other than maybe my staunch belief in individualism and weirdness - and being “basic” is neither. \nBut because the PSL has been idolized since forever, and I am a fan of warm drinks in cool weather, I decided to go for it. At least once in my lifetime. Maybe all this time I had missed out on my warm drink soul mate. Maybe my life was incomplete because I’d never had a PSL. \nStill, as I told the cashier “small Pumpkin Spice Latte, please” I felt tinges of guilt and disgust and shame. I felt as if me getting a PSL would snowball into something bigger. I would be the butt of all jokes among my friends, who are even bigger shamers of basicness. \nIt cost five dollars. It cost five dollars for a small sized drink. I had never felt so ripped off in my life. “This had better taste like angels playing harp on my tongue,” I thought. After about 10 minutes, I had the drink in my hand, with my name misspelled (great start), and walked out of Starbucks toward my destination. \nFirst sip. My heart sank immediately. It didn’t taste like angels playing harp on my tongue. It didn’t taste anything like angels doing anything near my tongue. Now, I must confess that I don’t like pumpkin flavoured things in general, so it could just be me, not the drink. But as a drink that has so many people willing to pay more than five dollars for, it was utterly disappointing. \nHowever, while my heart sank, I was also elated. At least now, having tasted it, I can say that it’s overrated. And I love hating on anything overtly popular (cue the hipster haters). My disappointment meant that I wasn’t a closet basic female, and I still had my twisted sense of individuality. \nI do applaud anyone who gets PSL often though, as you have to be a dedicated person to spend that much money on a non-alcoholic drink. Good on you. I don’t think I’d pay that much money for even my favourite drink in the world. \nBut honestly, the hot chocolate is so much better. And cheaper. College is hard. We make it easier!

Started in 1997, the initiative over the years has seen designs ranging from the modern, using whimsical brushstrokes in bold colors, to the nostalgic, featuring mistletoe and ornaments. \nFor this Christmas, Starbucks has further introduced new designs. Last year, Starbucks invited customers from around the world to use the red cups as a canvas and share their designs on Instagram. From the entries received, Starbucks picked 13 customers from Illinois to Indonesia, Pennsylvania to Korea, Dubai to Ontario, who created unique pieces of art that reflect what the holiday season means to them. From traditional Christmas lights and ornaments, to snowflakes and winter landscapes, the red cups are inspired by the holiday stories of customers from around the world. A total of 12 designs will appear on hot cups, and there is one design on cold cups. \nStarbucks holiday cups will be served in the more than 25,000 Starbucks stores in 75 countries around the world. \n“Christmas is a very special time for us at Starbucks and we are delighted to welcome the holiday spirit into our stores. We look forward to expressing the shared spirit of the holidays through our much-awaited Christmas beverages now available in the new red holiday cups,” said Manmeet Vohra, director – marketing and category, TATA Starbucks. \nSome of the designs for this year’s collection includes Birds & Flowers by Florencia, Bandung, Indonesia; Holiday Lights by Maria Lauren, New York City; Candy Canes by Jennifer, Seattle, USA; Birch Forest by Chloe, Plainfield, Illinois, USA; Ornaments by Anz Soza, Dubai; Poinsettia by Christina, Bakersfield, California; Graphic Swirls by Erica: Markham, Ontario, Canada; Snowflake Sweater by Alisa, St Petersburg, Russia; Evergreen Forest by Bronwyn, Moscow, Idaho, USA; and Sleigh Ride by Eun Joo, Daejeon, South Korea.

      "text": "PepsiCo, Starbucks CEOs call for inclusion after Donald Trump win PepsiCo, Starbucks CEOs call for inclusion after Donald Trump win Chief executives from PepsiCo and Starbucks called for a renewed commitment to inclusion following a presidential campaign that exposed racial and ethnic fault lines in the US. By: AFP | Published: November 11, 2016 4:48 AM Chief executives from PepsiCo and Starbucks called for a renewed commitment to inclusion following a presidential campaign that exposed racial and ethnic fault lines in the US. \nChief executives from PepsiCo and Starbucks called for a renewed commitment to inclusion following a presidential campaign that exposed racial and ethnic fault lines in the US. PepsiCo chief executive Indra Nooyi, who backed Democrat Hillary Clinton, said she hoped President-elect Donald Trump’s controversial statements on immigrants and minorities during the election battle were “just campaign rhetoric.” \n“Our employees, especially our employees who are non-white or who are LGBT, are asking, ‘Are we safe?'” said Nooyi, who was born in India. \n“The first thing we have to do is assure everyone in the US that everyone is safe.” \nStarbucks chief executive Howard Schultz, who also backed Clinton, bemoaned the “vitriolic” nature of the campaign and said he was disturbed by some of the after-effects. \n“One has to be concerned with what’s happened over the last few months and even over the last 24 hours,” he said. \n“We’ve seen things that are very disturbing. I saw a picture today of a swastika. It’s difficult to understand.” \nThe remarks came at the New York Times Dealbook conference yesterday, held less than 48 hours after Trump’s shock win in the battle for the White House. Election returns showed Trump won large majorities with white voters, but badly lagged Clinton with minority groups. \nSocial media on Wednesday and yesterday recounted cases of immigrants and minorities facing bigotry in schools and stores. Thousands of anti-Trump protesters took to about 10 cities, some carrying signs declaiming “Not our President” and “Love trumps hate.” \nNooyi congratulated Trump, but suggested he needs to set a much more inclusive tone. She also expressed disgust with Trump’s excuses following a leaked 2005 video in which the president-elect spoke lewdly about women. \nIn the clip, Trump described groping and forcing himself on women in vulgar, predatory language. \n“How dare we talk about women that way?” Nooyi said. \n“I don’t think there’s a place for that kind of talk, not in a locker room, not anywhere,” she said. “If we don’t nip this in the bud, it’s going to take over our society.” \nSchultz said he was shocked by the election result and that it reflects “years and years of a great many people in America feeling they’ve been left behind.” \nStarbucks briefly got into a tiff with Trump in late 2015 after the Republican mogul suggested the coffee chain should be boycotted over bright red holiday cups that contained no explicit Christmas imagery. Some evangelicals viewed the cups as anti-Christian. \nSchultz said he was baffled by the flap. \n“Every now and then you wake up and you say, ‘What?'” Schultz said. “The irony is we had our best Christmas ever and our business went up, so I thank him.” \nThe Starbucks chief did not rule out a run for public office, but said he has no interest in serving in the Trump administration. \n“I don’t think that’s for me,” he said.

Starbucks chose the winning designs from an Instagram contest that included submissions from more than a dozen countries. \n“We hope that this year’s red holiday cup designs express the shared spirit of the holidays as told by our customers,” said Sharon Rothstein, Starbucks global chief marketing officer. \nIt’s been a year since Starbucks rolled out solid red holiday cups with a minimalist logo, unwittingly sparking a backlash on Twitter as people accusing the Seattle company of waging a “war on Christmas.” It's September, when does the War on Christmas start? Get ready @Starbucks pic.twitter.com/8Id9YW5kAl \n— (((tramosUSA))) (@voteblue16) September 7, 2016 \nLed by “American evangelist” Joshua Feuerstein, some customers told baristas their names were “Merry Christmas” so they could tweet photos of the cups with the holiday message written on them. \nStarbucks is sweetening the rollout of the new holiday cups in 2016 by offering a free drink of equal or lesser value between November 10-14, from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. See the full rules here . \nCheck out the 13 new designs Starbucks is rolling out on Thursday: (Starbucks) ",

      "text": "12/11/2016 - 13:09:54 Back to Ireland Home \nBy Niall Murray \nA Starbucks coffee shop has been given two months to remove signs from the 300-year-old building where it opened without planning permission in Cork city centre. \nThe requirement is a condition attached to planning approval given this week, from Cork City Council, to the outlet on Emmet Place. \nAn Bord Pleanála said last March the use of this and two other city properties as Starbucks outlets required planning permission. \nThe multi-national chain had claimed the proportion of takeaway sales brought the outlets within the definition of a shop, so they did not need change-of-use planning for the premises as they were previously in retail usage. \nA subsequent planning application for one of the outlets, on Cork’s Princes St, was successful in September. The council included conditions that required a lit mounted wall sign to be removed before the end of the year. \nThe application for the Emmet Place building, built around 1720 and previously used as offices and a clothing shop, was submitted in April. \nIt sought permission to retain its use as a coffee shop, as well as the retention of signs above the door on Emmet Place and on Opera Lane, the shopping street which the side of the building fronts. \nWhile the council has permitted the change of use, meaning it can continue in use as a coffee shop, it has required the applicant firm, Nomtin Ltd, to remove a number of signs. \nOne is a backlit box sign on the glazed elevation fronting Opera Lane which the council says may be replaced by a similar sign behind the glazing if it fits the width of the door frame. \nAnother black vinyl sign must be removed from the upper panels of the glazing, the council has said. \nThis article first appeared in the Irish Examiner .

I have to start getting stickers for my planner, anyway,” she said. \nSo I asked if she wanted one of mine, from the Starbucks Christmas fair held recently at Shangri-La Mall. “You can have my planner, unless you like the challenge,” I said. \nThis merited a good few seconds of “...is typing…” on our chat screen. I could tell she was thinking about it. “I don’t like the challenge. I want the planner. Is it the mermaid one?” she finally replied. \nLater on I would find out that a lot of people actually like the challenge of collecting stickers (maybe equivalent to consuming a Frappuccino every other day, if you want to be first) for the Starbucks planner. My friend? She’s just coasting because she has me. \nA “Starbucks Christmas,” however un-Pinoy that sounds, has become a part of our December traditions. Every year, we await the time when we can finally grab a sticker card and start collecting. It’s a game, it’s a challenge, it’s a source of equal parts stress and glee. Christmas is just not the same without it (those who are on a diet experience it by association — there is always that one friend who’ll gladly ride a jeepney instead of Uber so she can get a Peppermint Mocha Frappuccino (I’m looking at you). \nThis year, Starbucks rolls out new holiday flavors and merchandise. Starbucks Handcrafted Beverages include the Santa Hat Dark Mocha, and returning favorites Peppermint Mocha and Toffee Nut Latte. This year’s Starbucks Christmas Blend, the Espresso Roast, can be enjoyed in two formats: the whole-bean variety Starbucks Christmas Blend Origami and the instant kind, the Starbucks Via Ready Brew Christmas Blend. Lifestyle Feature ( Article MRec ), pagematch: 1, sectionmatch: \nStarbucks Philippines head of marketing Keith Cole says, “I think our Christmas items are really for gift-giving. We usually see a peak right before Christmas, when people are doing their last-minute shopping. I love the excitement during Christmas; everyone is in a celebratory mood, and we’re happy that Starbucks has become a great part of that.” \n“Cinnamon, spice, and of course, toffee nut, are really North American flavors associated with Christmas, and I love how Filipinos have really embraced them,” he adds. \nDespite our adaptive nature, Starbucks continues to evolve and cater to our Pinoy needs — like our need to nest and make ourselves really, really comfortable. “We’re trying to add softer seating — more seating. In our market, customers tend to stay longer, versus in North America where it’s really a grab-and-go business,” Cole says. \nI can imagine how this would come in handy this holiday season, with all of us just needing a place to chill and breathe, listen to some Jose Mari Chan, and enjoy a Cranberry Bliss Bar (it will really bring out the Christmas spirit in you), in between some manic shopping.",

(AP Photo/Joseph Pisani) \nSEATTLE (MEDIA GENERAL) — Remember last year’s red cup controversy? Starbucks has made sure it won’t happen again, debuting 13 winter- and holiday-themed red cups Thursday. We crafted coffee. You made it art. Cups warm a hand, beauty warms the heart. #RedCups pic.twitter.com/3QmdvoNM0S \n— Starbucks Coffee (@Starbucks) November 10, 2016 \nThe 13 designs were created by customers from across the world and include images of holiday lights, snowflakes and snow-covered trees, as well as Christmas scenes featuring reindeer and sleighs. Red paper cups, for hot drinks, are stacked next to plastic cups at a Starbucks coffee shop in the Pike Place Market, Tuesday, Nov. 10, 2015, in Seattle. (AP Photo/Elaine Thompson) \nLast year, Starbucks’ two-tone ombre red cups caused quite a stir on social media because they weren’t decorated for the holiday as they had been in previous years. \nSome critics called the cups another example of the ongoing “war on Christmas.” \nJoshua Feuerstein, an American evangelist and former pastor, claimed Starbucks “removed Christmas” from their cups. His video rant was viewed more than 17 million times on Facebook. \n“We hope that this year’s red holiday cup designs express the shared spirit of the holidays as told by our customers,” said Sharon Rothstein, Starbucks global chief marketing officer, said in a release . \nThe 13 distinct cups are now in more than 25,000 Starbucks stores in 75 countries for the 2016 holiday season. 2016 Starbucks red cups ",

      "text": "Share this article \nSTARBUCKS IS BACK AT IT AGAIN WITH THE RED CUPS! \nTo all the Starbucks lovers in the world, it is that time again. Starbucks released their holiday cups recently, November 11th, 2016. \nAnd you HAVE to see the designs! \nIf you all remember, last year there was a huge controversy with the Starbucks red cups. When they were released, they were just plain.. red.. cups. People all over the world were questioning, \"Where were the Christmas designs?\" or \"Where is the reindeers and snowflakes?\". The plain red cup design apparently offended many people. \n\"STARBUCKS HATES CHRISTMAS!\" \nAccording to CNN Money, Joshua Feuerstein, a former pastor, posted a video on Facebook criticizing Starbucks. He accused Starbucks for removing \"Christmas from their cups because they hate Jesus.\" (CNN Money) \nFeuerstein's video received more than 10 million views, encouraging customers to say \"Merry Christmas\" as their names to trick baristas into writing the phrase on the cups. \nNow this year, the Starbucks red cups appear more \"Christmas-y\" than ever. Starbucks published a promotional video stating, \"Last year, we made the cups. You made them the holidays.\" The video showed many designs being created on those plain red cups, by many people all over the world. (Starbucks video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXJ21HtXr1U ) \nLast year, Starbucks encouraged people to share their designs on Instagram. According to Starbucks Newsroom, they received more than 1,200 individual submissions from 13 countries. Then Starbucks chose 13 designs from six different countries to be featured in this year's holiday cups. \nHere are 10 of the 13 designs: \nFrom Indonesia, United Arab Emirates, Russia, and South Korea, to states here like, Idaho, California, Pennslyvania, and New York, the chosen designs were inspired from the artist's holiday scenery or their seasonal traditions. \nStarbucks may have stirred a controversy last year with the plain red cups, but it became a blank canvas to people all over the world. And the designs that were chosen to be in the Starbucks Holiday Red Cups of 2016, shows how Starbucks was able to bring people together through art and their love for Starbucks. \nCredit for Photos and Information:",

      "text": "Starbucks turns to customers for annual holiday cup designs Posted: Updated: Starbucks holiday cup/Courtesy: MGN Online \nNEW YORK (AP) - Instead of looking to its creative team, Starbucks turned to its latte-sipping customers to design its latest holiday red cups. The company asked people to post their designs on Instagram last December, and 1,200 ideas came in from customers who've made it clear on social media they care about the holiday cups Starbucks has brought out each year for nearly two decades. Over the next several months, company executives narrowed down the options to their favorites, Starbucks said Wednesday. They settled on 13 overall, which focus on traditional holiday themes like snowflakes, Santa Claus and reindeer. The cups hit stores around the world on Thursday, with eleven of them available in U.S. locations. All the cups for hot drinks are red and have white designs featuring candy canes, ornaments or other holiday symbols. The one cup for iced drinks has a wreath wrapped around the Starbucks mermaid logo. The company declined to say if the customers were compensated for the designs. Starbucks' return to more overt holiday imagery comes after a tempest last year when a more subdued cup - bright red on top, shading to a darker cranberry below - drew criticism from some who said the chain was part of a so-called war on Christmas. Thousands of people sounded off on Twitter and other social networks. Donald Trump, now president-elect, even suggested perhaps people should boycott the chain. That controversy came as a surprise to the company, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz said at an event in New York on Wednesday where the new designs were displayed. \"It's just a cup,\" he joked. Starbucks Corp. has released holiday cups every year since 1997. Last week, the Seattle-based company also unveiled a green cup ahead of Election Day that it said was \"a symbol of unity.\" It features a mosaic of more than 100 people, including a coffee farmer and barista. Once again, though, people took to social media to make it known - they wanted red cups. ",

      "title": "Starbucks Christmas Cups Have Returned",
      "text": "winter Share this article \nNow that election results have taken over the news, everyone seems to have moved on from their outrage about the green cups Starbucks had released in the beginning of November. Because November is usually the time of year when Starbucks starts serving their hot beverages in their well-known red cups, this change from the norm really threw some people off. \nFriends, baristas, and customers drawn in one continuous line—reminding us we're all connected. pic.twitter.com/qspqJc8KWB \n— Starbucks Coffee (@Starbucks) November 1, 2016 \n\nWhat many didn't realize, however, was that the green cups covered in drawings of people were meant to bring people together. Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz explained, \"During a divisive time in our country, Starbucks wanted to create a symbol of unity as a reminder of our shared values, and the need to be good to each other.\" Well, rather than bringing people together, the cups only turned people against one another. The internet exploded with people blaming Starbucks for trying to be too politically correct by removing all traces of Christmas, a religious holiday, from their cups. Others were congratulating Starbucks for the same reason. \nStarbucks didn't make much further comment on the issue, other than stressing that there were more holiday plans to come. \n@ttwaswift Our holiday plans are still under wraps. Stay tuned! \n— Starbucks Coffee (@Starbucks) November 1, 2016 \n\nIt seemed that many people chose to ignore the lack of confirmation from the coffee company about the cups truly being the holiday cups for the year. But this week, Starbucks has released the true holiday cups, pictured above, showing that they did listen to customers who wanted more of a winter theme on the classic red cups after last years were just plain red. There are a variety of drawings on this year's cups, so you can get something different every time you study. Hopefully, the fun designs will make caffeine runs during finals a little more fun!

      "text": "NEW YORK (AP) – Starbucks will be unveiling its holiday coffee cups for this year with what look to be snowflakes and reindeer, after last year’s more subdued red cups caused an uproar from critics who said the chain was part of a so-called war on Christmas.\nThe coffee chain was set to roll out the red cups to stores Thursday. But a New York store had a display Tuesday showing 10 different cups it said were designed by customers around the world, some featuring ornaments, Santa Claus and other holiday symbols.\nStarbucks Corp. says its plans are still under wraps and declined to say more about the cups. It has released holiday cups every year since 1997. The outcry over 2015’s plainer red cup grew after now President-elect Donald Trump suggested boycotting the chain.",
