      "text": "10 Comments The Microsoft HoloLens uses augmented reality. The HTC Vive, Oculus Rift, and Sony PlayStation VR use virtual reality. What's the different between these high-tech headsets? \n2016 has been the year of spending a lot of money to put huge plastic visors on your head. The Google Daydream View , HTC Vive, Oculus Rift , and Sony PlayStation VR are all competing for your wallet, and Microsoft has announced a slew of Windows 10-ready VR headsets on top of them. Microsoft also made its HoloLens available to developers. While the HoloLens seems similar to the other headsets, however, the parallels are entirely superficial. The former are virtual reality headsets, while latter is an augmented reality headset. Here's the difference. Virtual Reality \nVirtual reality headsets completely take over your vision to give you the impression that you're somewhere else. The Vive and Rift displays are opaque, blocking out your surroundings when you wear them. If you put them on when they're turned off, you might think you're blindfolded. \nWhen the headsets turn on, however, the OLED panels inside are refracted by the lenses to completely fill your field of vision with whatever is being display. It could be a game, a 360-degree video, or just the virtual space of the Oculus and SteamVR interfaces. Visually, you're taken to wherever the headsets want you to go —t he outside world is replaced with a virtual one. \nMany VR games and apps rely on you staying in a fixed position, either sitting or standing, so you don't walk into walls or knock over things. Because the headsets block out your view (and you're tethered to your computer through them, in some cases), that's a significant danger. \nThe HTC Vive somewhat gets around this by letting you set up a specific VR area. Two external sensors track the headset's position, and the SteamVR software uses those sensors to map out (with your guidance) a square of empty floor it designates as safe to move in. If you try to move beyond that square, a virtual wall fades into view, letting you know you're about to move into a space you might not have cleared. It's a helpful feature that allows limited motion, which opens up some SteamVR games to incorporate actually moving your body around instead of just your head. \nThe upcoming Windows 10 VR headsets hope to get around the need for external sensors by building outward-facing sensors inside the device itself to track the environment. Virtual Control \nThe immersiveness of virtual reality can make you want to move your hands around and expect them to appear in whatever software you're using, but that's almost never the case. Both the Rift and Vive rely on peripherals for control, and without them you can't actually interact with anything. They might be as simple as a gamepad or as complex as the HTC Vive's motion controllers. Even the phone-based Samsung Gear VR has a touchpad on the side to let you control apps. There have been experiments with motion-sensing gloves for VR, but they haven't picked up any traction outside of research yet. Virtual Software \nAs touched on, for both games and apps, virtual reality completely supersedes your surroundings, taking you to other places. Where you are physically doesn't matter. In games, you might sit in the cockpit of a starfighter like in EVE: Valkyrie. In apps, you might virtually tour distant locations as if you were there. There are tons of possibilities in virtual reality, and they all involve replacing everything around you with something else. Augmented Reality \nWhereas virtual reality replaces your vision, augmented reality adds to it. AR devices like the HoloLens Development Edition are transparent, letting you see everything in front of you as if you are wearing a weak pair of sunglasses. The technology is designed for completely free movement. \nMicrosoft calls the HoloLens \"mixed reality\" rather than augmented reality. Academically the term mixed reality refers to the technology behind both virtual and augmented reality in a very broad sense, and Microsoft's use of it seems based on giving the HoloLens a more uniquely branded identity than anything else. The HoloLens is an augmented reality device, and we'll refer to it as such. \nThe HoloLens uses a pair of small projectors aimed at angled lenses built into the visor. The lenses reflect that light while still letting the light of your surroundings pass through, superimposing the projectors' images on top of your view. Any image the HoloLens displays appears to float in front of you. \nThe projectors work in conjunction with a series of cameras built into the visor and Microsoft's \"holographic processing unit\" (HPU) to track your location in relation to where the holograms are virtually placed. The visor constantly scans any surrounding walls or furniture to map out the space around you, and moves the holograms it displays to reflect how you move. This lets you place a hologram in the middle of the room and walk around it as if it were physically there. You can also walk through that hologram, because of course it isn't actually in the room; it fades out when you get very close to it, and reappears when you turn around to face it from the other angle. \nThis technology has a distinct disadvantage compared with virtual reality. While VR completely covers and replaces your field of vision, the HoloLens display only takes up a limited space in front of you. The projectors and lenses are arranged to produce bright, crisp holograms in a rectangular area in the center of your field of vision. When you move your head, the holograms disappear as soon as they hit the edge of the rectangle, making them vanish well before they reach the edge of your vision. Hopefully Microsoft will overcome this limitation as it further develops the HoloLens, because the visual drop-off is the most jarring and disappointing issue with the device. Augmented Control \nThe primary way to interact with the HoloLens is with hand gestures. The cameras on the device can track your hand and finger movements, and use them to perform different functions. The Bloom gesture of opening your upward-pointed hand opens the Start menu and lets you access the HoloLens' software. The Air Tap gesture of pinching your fingers together functions as a click. This is gesture-based control rather than perfect movement tracking; you need to master holding your arm at the right distance directly in front of you for the gesture to register, and you can't simply grab and move holograms quickly with natural actions. \nYou can use the included Clicker peripheral as well, but it only emulates the Air Tap gesture; it doesn't function as its own air mouse for precise control. You can also pair a Bluetooth keyboard with the HoloLens for text input. Augmented Software \nFor apps, augmented reality has nearly limitless possibilities. The HoloLens already projects standard Windows 10 apps as floating windows you can place anywhere around you, effectively giving you an instantly modular multi-monitor computing setup. Other apps, like Holo Studio and HoloPlanner, let you place three-dimensional holograms about your surroundings. Holo Studio lets you create your own holographic dioramas, while HoloPlanner lets you see what your room would look like with difference pieces of furniture places around it. \nFor games, augmented reality can build experiences using your surroundings. The detective game Fragments scans your room and creates crime scenes based on its layout, placing various set pieces around and producing a slightly different experience with each room. RoboRaid detects where the walls are and projects holograms of robotic arms breaking through them and robots pouring out. Young Conker places obstacles all over your furniture, assembling its levels from your surroundings. In all of these cases, the games change to fit the space. The Difference \nVirtual reality and augmented reality accomplish two very different things in two very different ways, despite the similar designs of the devices themselves. VR replaces reality, taking you somewhere else. AR adds to reality, projecting information on top of what you're already seeing. They're both powerful technologies that have yet to make their mark with consumers, but show a lot of promise. They can completely change how we use computers in the future, but whether one or both will succeed is anyone's guess right now. ",

      "title": "Here’s what’s new in Visual Studio JavaScript support for iOS and Android developers",
      "text": "  \nIn Microsoft’s latest Visual Studio blog post , they focus on the recent release of TACO (Tools for Apache Cordova) in Virtual Studio 2017 RC and how it’s going to address some of the biggest issues faced by iOS and Android developers. \nAccording to the post, Microsoft is “tackling the big problems” in this release, and trying to address some of the most significant roadblocks that developers tend to crash into as they create and maintain apps. As to what these issues are, they can be put into two central themes: Fast, reliable builds. The new Visual Studio Installer, combined with offline installation of a fully validated toolchain of 3 rd party components, provides for faster builds that are also easier to troubleshoot and fix. Incredible edit-debug speed. A new browser-based simulator enables you to code fast and see the results immediately in the browser. Live reload, plugin simulation and support for Ionic Framework give VS the fastest developer workflow on the market. \nMicrosoft’s move toward speed and reliability is exemplified by their new streamlined installer, which now offers a “Mobile Development with Javascript” workload. The new installer frequently gets developers to “go from ‘download’ to ‘code’ within 15 minutes.” \nAlso helping to make for a more reliable and quick development experience is the addition of “toolsets,” which combine “a set of validated tools into a single package which can be used by Visual Studio.” \nThe biggest change coming to TACO to improve its edit-debug speed is coming from the addition of Cordova Simulate, which is going to be replacing Ripple in the newest build of TACO. Here’s you can expect in Cordova Simulate: \nLike Ripple, Cordova Simulate will empower you to: Test at varying devices sizes. Simulate geolocation, compass, and accelerometer settings. Live reload for images, stylesheets, JavaScript, and HTML. Use browser developer tools like a DOM explorer and JavaScript debugger, all from within Visual Studio. \nGoing beyond Ripple, Cordova Simulate then lets you: Simulate even more plugins like Camera, Contacts, File, Media, and more ( see the documentation for details ). Simulate your app in a dedicated browser window rather than an iframe. Save API responses for custom or uncommon plugins. \nVisual Studio 2017 RC is available right now to download, so you should grab it if you want to see these features for yourself.

      "text": "Shelby Rogers \nA new app from Microsoft could help color-blind users get visual clarity. \nBeing color blind affects 1 in 12 men in the world and 1 in 200 women. More often than not, the entire color spectrum isn’t affected, but sufferers struggle with identifying shades of red and green. \nThe Color Binoculars app uses your iPhone’s camera, and enhances reds and greens to make them more obvious. Creator Tom Overton said the app came out of fulfilling a personal need as well. [Image Courtesy of Microsoft on the App Store ] \n“Anything with red or green messes me up,” said Tom Overton , who developed the app. “It’s not so terrible, but it does affect you. For instance, fall leaves don’t look any different for me than other leaves. They look like they always do. It takes a lot of color out of my life – metaphorically, that is.” \nWhile Color Binoculars doesn’t cure color blindness, it certainly helps. Overton noted he created the app in Microsoft Garage, Microsoft’s in-house creation lab for apps. \nThe app doesn’t save images or video, but simply “translates” the images into a language color blind users’ eyes understand. Color Binoculars supports all three types of color blindness, according to its product description . \nHumans have three cone cells in their eyes upon birth – one for red hues, one for blue and one for green. Color blindness stems from a lack or trouble with one of these conic structures. Color blindness is often genetic, but sometimes it can be linked to aging or eye injury. And while seeing in grayscale is what people normally think of when we hear “color blind,” only rare cases are limited to black, white and gray. \nThe app is available on the iTunes store for iOS users at the moment.",

      "title": "Microsoft is using wind to power an entire datacentre",
      "text": "Microsoft Corporation has always been known for their image of environmental protection but this may be their biggest validation to date. The tech company announced on Monday they are in the process converting their datacenter in Cheyenne Wyoming to rely entirely on wind energy. Microsoft will be using three wind farms, two in Kansas owned by Allianz Risk Transfer AG, and the other by Black Hills Corp. in Wyoming. The farms will provide Microsoft with 178 megawatts and 59 megawatts of capacity in wind power respectively.\n\nMicrosoft uses datacentres to operate their cloud services. These facilities require an ample amount of electricity to function and the usage levels are only growing as the service becomes more conventional. Microsoft’s goal is to attain a level of 44 percent use of renewables by the end of the year. This is simply another dimension of competition for tech companies promoting cloud services. Amazon web services (AWS) hopes to achieve a level of 40 percent reliance on renewables by the end of the year. Google only taps into clean energy for 35 percent for their datacentres.\n\nBlack Hills Corp. is one of the two companies entering the contract with Microsoft. The publically traded company disclosed on 25 October they would be offering a dividend for any of their shareholders prior to 15 November. The stock has been showing a downward trend since the announcement but will likely rebound based on the future success with their new partner. The company’s stock climbed 30 cents following Microsoft’s press release. Microsoft has always been considered a safe long-term investment. With an average earnings growth rate forecasted at 8.13 percent over the next five years, the company is generally a safe investment choice.\n\nUnder Microsoft’s agreement with Black Hills, any surplus power can be stored in backup generators and later distributed to the grid at a discounted rate. In terms of their public image, this will benefit both firms. Corporate promotion of renewable energy is becoming routine for industry leaders. Governments often provide tax cuts to these companies for taking the initiative and aligning their interests with global efforts. Bloomberg forecasts that the top 50 corporations that purchase solar and wind energy will have accounted for 63.4 gigawatts of total production added by 2025.\n\nThis can be chalked up as another victory for renewables as we slowly shift away from common power sources like coal and oil. Local Wyoming consumers will prefer this alternative, more eco-friendly source of power as opposed to power from the grid likely produced using power plants. On a larger scale, as we observe the nation moving away from fuel sources such as coal, crude oil, and natural gas, we can expect the price of these products to decline. Investors should write long-term futures in any of these sources as they are replaced. To hedge their bets, individuals should buy green ETFs, made up of environmentally friendly corporations.\n\nThis article originally appeared on OilPrice.com",

      "text": "Hints of what’s to come in next spring’s Windows 10 Creators Update just keep on coming. Microsoft recently released Windows 10 Insider Preview build 14971, which integrates Paint 3D, turns your browser into an e-reader, shuffles Command Prompt into the shadows, and more.\n\nFirst up: Edge-as-e-reader. Starting with build 14971, Microsoft says Edge will be able to display any unprotected ebook in the epub format. That’s not a hugely exciting addition for PC users (though they can use it), but for anyone with a Windows 10 tablet it means one less app you have to download.\n\nTo read this article in full or to leave a comment, please click here",

      "title": "How to switch from Microsoft Surface or other Windows 10 tablets to the iPad",
      "text": "19 Comments When Windows is the last thing you want on your tablet, iPad Pro is ready to set you PC-free! \nOnce upon a time, people thought you had to use Windows to be productive. But Apple has put a lot of effort in to ensure that the iPad, along with iOS and the developer ecosystem on which it relies, is robust enough for even the most epic bouts of productivity — and focused enough to avoid distraction. Even Microsoft has gotten in on the act, making tablet-optimized versions of Word, Excel, PowerPoint and more, all for iOS and the iPad. Why switch from Windows 10 to iPad? \nIf you're considering a switch to the iPad, chances are you already own an iPhone, but for whatever reason — work, personal, or just plain enjoyment — you still use a Windows laptop. But as capable as Windows 10 is, it lacks the hooks into Apple's ecosystem that work so well with the iPhone, Apple Watch, and the company's other devices. \nMoreover, despite improvements in the hybrid laptop space, Windows 10 still works best with a mouse and keyboard. That's not to say there aren't apps that have been optimized for touch, with many more being updated all the time, but iPad developers have had six years to create hundreds of thousands of apps specifically designed for touch. \nThat means iPad isn't a PC trying to be a tablet; it's a tablet through and through. What you can bring from Windows 10 to the iPad \nWhen moving between devices, you're likely going to want to bring over your important files, photos, audio, and information. \nLuckily, owning a computer these days isn't just a siloed affair: most PC owners connect to the cloud in some way, using services like Dropbox or, at Microsoft's increasingly forceful behest, OneDrive. This allows local folders and the files within them to be mirrored in the cloud, and easily accessed within the iPad ecosystem. You'll also be able to transfer your contacts and email using cloud services. \nWhat you can't bring with you from Windows are your apps themselves. Although many companies, such as Adobe, Microsoft and others, have versions of their apps for both platforms, the app bundles can't run on both platforms — you'll need to download new versions of the programs on iOS to use them. How to move files, photos and other data from Windows 10 to iOS \nUnlike switching from one PC to another, transfering files is a bit more complicated than connecting an Ethernet cable between your devices: While the iPad can connect to USB thumb drives via the Lightning to USB 3 Adapter or connect directly with Lightning-compatible drives, you often need special apps to properly access your files. There are, however, a number of ways to directly bring certain types of content to your iPad. Dropbox or OneDrive \nLots of Windows users have either Dropbox or OneDrive installed, allowing you to keep local files synchronized with multiple devices. For photos and files, having either of these programs installed on both a Windows PC and an iPad allows easy transfers of your most important documents. \nAnd thanks to the iOS Extensions framework, files stored in either Dropbox or OneDrive can be opened in other iPad apps — a PDF stored in OneDrive, for example, can be annotated in Readdle's excellent PDF Expert 5 . \nDownload Dropbox for iOS Emails, contacts and calendars \nIt's similarly easy to transfer your email, contacts and calendar appointments to the iPad. By default, you can use iOS's native Mail, Contacts, and Calendars sync to access your email; this will copy over your Outlook accounts as well as any other programs, including Google . How to set up email, contacts, and calendars on iOS \nNote : If you use two-factor authentication with your Outlook account, you may need to create a one-time password when logging in directly on the iPad. \nYou also have the option of using the Microsoft Outlook app on your iPad to manage your Outlook email and calendars. To do so, all you need to do is grab the Outlook for iOS app, log in, and away you go! \nDownload Outlook for iOS The old-fashioned way: iTunes \nIf cloud-syncing hurts your head, you can always get information to your iPad the old fashioned way: through iTunes. While iTunes for Windows isn't a particularly good piece of software, it does the job where it counts — synchronizing photos, contacts, and calendar entries stored on your PC. Be aware, however, that if you're using iCloud Photo Library, local photo sync is not possible. \nDownload iTunes for Windows Next steps \nOnce you're finished moving all your information over from Windows, you can further customize your iPad to your liking.

      "title": "Women's share of Microsoft jobs falls again, so it's tying top pay to diversity",
      "text": "ZDNet Japan Women's share of Microsoft jobs falls again, so it's tying top pay to diversity Microsoft is again pointing to the Nokia layoffs to explain a second successive annual fall in the percentage of women on its staff. \nMicrosoft chief diversity & inclusion officer Gwen Houston: \"A strategic business decision made in the longer-term interests of the company resulted in a reduction of jobs held by female employees outside the US.\" Image: Microsoft \nMicrosoft may not have wanted Nokia's handset business , but women from the Finnish firm helped swell the proportion of females in its ranks. \nNow, with new figures showing a decline in the percentage of women employees in its workforce for the second year running, Microsoft says it's taking a number of steps, including linking executive pay to its diversity targets, to help reverse that trend. \nThe company's latest diversity report reveals that 25.8 percent of its global workforce are women, down from 26.8 percent last year, and from 29 percent the year before that. \nAs it did last year , Microsoft blamed the shrinking share of jobs held by women on its restructuring related to Nokia. The Espoo-based devices business introduced a number of non-US manufacturing jobs to Microsoft and many of these roles were held by women. \n\"This was the main cause of the decline in female representation at Microsoft. In short, a strategic business decision made in the longer-term interests of the company resulted in a reduction of jobs held by female employees outside the US,\" said Gwen Houston, Microsoft's chief diversity & inclusion officer. \nThe new figures are likely to be uncomfortable for Microsoft, which now trails Apple, Facebook and Google on gender diversity. \nAs Bloomberg reports , Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has made diversity a priority for Microsoft following a terrible statement that he trusted women because they never ask for a pay rise. \nNadella is supposed to be revealing a plan detailing how diversity goals will influence senior execs's annual bonuses this week. \nAccording to Microsoft's diversity report , women workers at Microsoft in the US earn 99.9 cents at the same job title for every $1 earned by men. \nAlso, 27.2 percent of Microsoft's senior leadership team are now women. \nPositive signs include the fact that 30 percent of Microsoft's university hires worldwide are now women. Also, Microsoft is hiring more women into engineering roles. Worldwide, the proportion of women has increased from 23.7 percent last year to 26.1 percent today. \nAdditionally, Microsoft says 3.3 percent of its hires into technical roles are African-American/Black hires, up from 2.5 percent last year. Hispanic/Latino hires in technical roles are up to 5.1 percent from 4.9 percent. \nAs well as linking senior-executive pay to making its staff more diverse, Microsoft lists nine other steps it's taking to change the balance of its workforce. \nThese measures include improving career development for women and racial/ethnic minorities, and launching an 'Inclusive Hiring' website to attract diverse talent.

      "text": "Microsoft’s Going Bonkers For Black Friday Get (and give) all of the driving games. twitter.com/@themaxprince \nCar guy? Gamer? Yeah, me too. Good news for us then: Microsoft is doing Black Friday right this year. The Xbox Store has announced its early Christmas shopping discounts, and they include deep cuts to the prices of over 250 games, from sports to shooters to strategy. Some even come in under $10, ideal stocking stuffers. And, yes, more than a few of these are driving games, big boy sims and arcade burners. \nHere, a rundown of a few auto-related games now available from the Xbox Store at a substantial discount: \nThe Crew - Far from the best graphics or physics engine, but offers a unique proposition: a free-roaming online world based on an actual map of the United States. Hooning around your own digital neighborhood is neat and slightly eerie experience. ($9.99) \nDiRT - The best rally sim out there. True to the sport, gameplay is rewarding, raw, and pretty damn difficult to master. And, lord, the car list is a dream, everything from old Group B Audis and Lancias to the Peugeot 205 Pikes Peak slayer and modern Imprezas. ($24.00) \nForza Motorsport 6 - You already know it’s fantastic, and probably already own it. But the best gift can be giving. So get someone else hooked, because it’s more fun putting somebody you actually know into a wall at Road Atlanta over Xbox Live than a stranger. ($25.00) \nTrackmania Turbo - Taken at face value, this one’s just a fun little multiplayer arcade. Not so. Rapid-fire, bite-size courses offer huge replay value, a curiously engaging Mario Kart -esque challenge. The vehicles offer some of the coolest genericized takes on sandrails, single-seaters, and stock cars. ($16.00) \nF1 2016 - After eight installments, Codemasters’ gameplay is pretty refined. There's a bevy of upgrades this year, and everything is officially licensed by F1. That means legit cars, drivers, and circuits. This sim was just released in August, so it’s actually up to date, with the Haas F1 Team and new European Grand Prix. ($32.99)",

      "title": "Here's what's new in today's Surface Book firmware updates",
      "text": "By Rich Woods Neowin LLC @@TheRichWoods · 5 seconds ago \nEarlier today, Microsoft released a series of driver updates for its Surface Book . As usual, the company didn't offer any release notes at the same time that it offered them; however, unlike the updates that the device received at the end of last month , we won't have to wait through the entire weekend in suspense. \nThe changelog is now available, and for once, it was offered in a reasonable amount of time, as long as your standard for reasonable isn't the actual time that the updates were released. Here's what's new: \nWindows Update History Name Intel Corporation driver update for Intel(R) Precise Touch Device \nIntel(R) Precise Touch Device v1.2.0.70 reduces false touch events when the device is closed. NVIDIA driver update for NVIDIA GeForce GPU \nNVIDIA GeForce GPU Microsoft driver update for Surface UEFI \nSurface UEFI v90.1380.768.0 improves system stability. \nOddly enough, there were no Surface Pro 4 updates that shipped alongside these. This was also the case with last month's Book drivers, but it usually isn't, as the two devices are typically updated in parallel. In fact, the Pro 4 hasn't received new firmware since the end of August . Tags",

      "title": "Black Friday Bundles - Xbox One S VS Xbox One",
      "text": "  Black Friday deals continue with Xbox One S and Xbox One system bundles by Microsoft. Not sure which one you should buy, or even if you should upgrade to the newer system? Here are some points to consider. The Xbox One just got a little better. Microsoft has recently released the new and improved Xbox One S. This console boasts being the only console to offer 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray, 4K video streaming and HDR. Improvements over Xbox One: In terms of performance, the Xbox One S has a slight boost in processing power over the Xbox one. This allows the newer system to be able to facilitate HDR gaming. The Xbox One S has support for HDMI 2.0a which allows for proper 4K 60Hz video output. The means you can enjoy 4K streaming/playback from such services as Amazon and Netflix. This will become an increasing plus as more streaming services upgrade their 4K offerings. Jeff Henshaw, Group Program Manager at Xbox confirmed that the Xbox One S could upscale games from 1080p to 4K. While 4K upscaling is not as good as true 4K, it is a considerably higher resolution than that offered by the Xbox one. Photo Source: Microsoft Xbox One S is 40% smaller than the Xbox One even though it has the power supply built in. The smaller size is great but it comes at a small price. The Xbox One S has no dedicated Kinect port so you would have to purchase a USB adapter to use Kinect. There is a new controller which has Bluetooth for gaming on Windows 10 devices. You can enjoy custom button mapping and your choice of compatible headsets via the 3.5mm stereo headset jack. Photo Source: Here’s the verdict. The new Xbox One S certainly has some great features. If you planning on getting into the world of 4K, the Xbox One S is a great place to start. The fact that you get a 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray player built-in with the gaming console is a plus over going out and buying a new 4K Ultra Blu-ray player stand alone. If you don’t already have an Xbox, then the new Xbox One S system is a good deal. Have an Xbox already? You can still choose to upgrade to the 4K advantages of the Xbox One S or wait for Project Scorpio which is slated for holiday of 2017.",

      "text": "what is a teraflop project scorpio More Whether it’s the latest reveals about the powerful Microsoft Scorpio project for Xbox or the newest release on AMD GPUs, you may see the term “TFLOP” being tossed around. If you don’t really know that this means or why you should care about it, then you’ve come to the right place! Let’s talk through the term and why it can be important when talking about processors.\nOkay, what is a TFLOP? armprocessor More TFLOP is a bit of shorthand for “teraflop,” which is a way of measuring the power of a computer based more on mathematical capability than GHz. A teraflop refers to the capability of a processor to calculate one trillion floating-point operations per second. Saying something has “6 TFLOPS,” for example, means that its processor setup is capable of handling 6 trillion floating-point calculations every second, on average.\nWell, I’m already lost. What are floating-point calculations? project scorpio More Floating-point calculations are a common way of gauging the computational power of computers. In fact, once we started using FLOPs, it quickly became a common international standard for talking about computer prowess.\nAs you may (or may not) remember from math classes, floating-point, or “real” numbers, are a set of all numbers including integers, numbers with decimal points, irrational numbers like pi, and so on. From a computational standpoint, a floating-point calculation is any finite calculation that uses floating-point numbers, particularly decimals. This is far more useful than looking at fixed-point calculations (which use only whole integers), because the work that computers do frequently involves finite floating-point numbers and all their real world complications.\nSo, FLOPS measure how many equations involving floating-point numbers that a processor can solve in one second. There is a lot of variance in the FLOPS that various devices need. A traditional calculator, for example, may need only around 10 FLOPS for all its operations. So when we start talking about megaflops (a million floating-point calculations), gigaflops (a billion) and teraflops (a trillion), you can start to see what sort of power we’re talking about.\nManufacturers frequently include FLOPS as a specification on computers so they can talk about how fast they are in a universal way. However, if you have a custom-built machine and really want to brag about its teraflops, too, then there’s a pretty simple equation that you can use to figure it out:\nRead More Flops Calculation More Wait, I’ve seen teraflop data on GPUs, does that mean TFLOPs create graphics, too? It’s all basically the same thing. What we see as computer graphics are a massive number of polygons being rendered and moved into different positions on the screen. But the processor doesn’t draw little pictures, it uses mathematics to describe the shape, characteristics and placement of these polygons. You can think of each angle and position as its own little floating-point calculation—because that’s exactly how the processor sees it.\nSo, more TFLOPs means faster devices and better graphics? project-scorpio-6-1620x1080-640x0 More Often—but not always. In fact, we have seen some GPUs with more teraflops that perform worse than those with fewer TFLOPS. For a general analogy, consider wattage. A floodlight and a spotlight may use same wattage, but they behave in very different ways and have different levels of brightness. Likewise, real-world performance is dependent on things like the structure of the processor, frame buffers, core speed, and other important specifications.\nBut yes—as a guideline, more TFLOPS should mean faster devices and better graphics. And that’s actually an impressive sign of growth. It was only several years ago that consumer devices couldn’t even approach the TFLOP level, and now we’re talking casually about devices having 6 to 11 TFLOPs without thinking twice. In the world of supercomputers, it’s even more impressive. Researchers who compare specs are now discussing supercomputers that have more than 100 petaflops, and a petaflop is a thousand teraflops.\nBottom line: What should I think when I see the TFLOP specs? Think of this as the equivalent of a dude talking about how much he can lift in the gym. If a ripped dude says he can bench 300 pounds, then it’s a good bet he can bench a lot, even if the actual figure has been fudged a bit for self-serving purposes.\nBut a weight-lifting championship isn’t going to take contestants at their word, and you should practice the same skepticism when looking at devices and Quote: d TFLOPs. Ultimately, it’s real-world performance that matters most.\nThe best laptop you can buy How to care for your laptop’s battery Roku Express vs. Chromecast vs. Fire TV Stick vs. Roku Streaming Stick",

      "text": "Car guy? Gamer? Yeah, me too. Good news for us then: Microsoft is doing Black Friday right this year. The Xbox Store has announced its early Christmas shopping discounts, and they include deep cuts to the prices of over 250 games, from sports to shooters to strategy. Some even come in under $10, ideal stocking stuffers. And, yes, more than a few of these are driving games, big boy sims and arcade burners. Here, a rundown of a few auto-related games now available from the Xbox Store at a substantial discount:\nThe Crew - Far from the best graphics or physics engine, but offers a unique proposition: a free-roaming online world based on an actual map of the United States. Hooning around your own digital neighborhood is neat and slightly eerie experience. ($9.99)\nDiRT - The best rally sim out there. True to the sport, gameplay is rewarding, raw, and pretty damn difficult to master. And, lord, the car list is a dream, everything from old Group B Audis and Lancias to the Peugeot 205 Pikes Peak slayer and modern Imprezas. ($24.00)\nForza Motorsport 6 - You already know it’s fantastic, and probably already own it. But the best gift can be giving. So get someone else hooked, because it’s more fun putting somebody you actually know into a wall at Road Atlanta over Xbox Live than a stranger. ($25.00)\nTrackmania Turbo - Taken at face value, this one’s just a fun little multiplayer arcade. Not so. Rapid-fire, bite-size courses offer huge replay value, a curiously engaging Mario Kart -esque challenge. The vehicles offer some of the coolest genericized takes on sandrails, single-seaters, and stock cars. ($16.00)\nF1 2016 - After eight installments, Codemasters’ gameplay is pretty refined. There's a bevy of upgrades this year, and everything is officially licensed by F1. That means legit cars, drivers, and circuits. This sim was just released in August, so it’s actually up to date, with the Haas F1 Team and new European Grand Prix. ($32.99)",

      "text": "Whether it’s the latest reveals about the powerful Microsoft Scorpio project for Xbox or the newest release on AMD GPUs, you may see the term “TFLOP” being tossed around. If you don’t really know that this means or why you should care about it, then you’ve come to the right place! Let’s talk through the term and why it can be important when talking about processors.\nOkay, what is a TFLOP? View photos\narmprocessor More TFLOP is a bit of shorthand for “teraflop,” which is a way of measuring the power of a computer based more on mathematical capability than GHz. A teraflop refers to the capability of a processor to calculate one trillion floating-point operations per second. Saying something has “6 TFLOPS,” for example, means that its processor setup is capable of handling 6 trillion floating-point calculations every second, on average.\nWell, I’m already lost. What are floating-point calculations? View photos\nproject scorpio More Floating-point calculations are a common way of gauging the computational power of computers. In fact, once we started using FLOPs, it quickly became a common international standard for talking about computer prowess.\nAs you may (or may not) remember from math classes, floating-point, or “real” numbers, are a set of all numbers including integers, numbers with decimal points, irrational numbers like pi, and so on. From a computational standpoint, a floating-point calculation is any finite calculation that uses floating-point numbers, particularly decimals. This is far more useful than looking at fixed-point calculations (which use only whole integers), because the work that computers do frequently involves finite floating-point numbers and all their real world complications.\nSo, FLOPS measure how many equations involving floating-point numbers that a processor can solve in one second. There is a lot of variance in the FLOPS that various devices need. A traditional calculator, for example, may need only around 10 FLOPS for all its operations. So when we start talking about megaflops (a million floating-point calculations), gigaflops (a billion) and teraflops (a trillion), you can start to see what sort of power we’re talking about.\nManufacturers frequently include FLOPS as a specification on computers so they can talk about how fast they are in a universal way. However, if you have a custom-built machine and really want to brag about its teraflops, too, then there’s a pretty simple equation that you can use to figure it out:\nView photos\nFlops Calculation More Wait, I’ve seen teraflop data on GPUs, does that mean TFLOPs create graphics, too? It’s all basically the same thing. What we see as computer graphics are a massive number of polygons being rendered and moved into different positions on the screen. But the processor doesn’t draw little pictures, it uses mathematics to describe the shape, characteristics and placement of these polygons. You can think of each angle and position as its own little floating-point calculation—because that’s exactly how the processor sees it.\nSo, more TFLOPs means faster devices and better graphics? View photos\nproject-scorpio-6-1620x1080-640x0 More Often—but not always. In fact, we have seen some GPUs with more teraflops that perform worse than those with fewer TFLOPS. For a general analogy, consider wattage. A floodlight and a spotlight may use same wattage, but they behave in very different ways and have different levels of brightness. Likewise, real-world performance is dependent on things like the structure of the processor, frame buffers, core speed, and other important specifications.\nBut yes—as a guideline, more TFLOPS should mean faster devices and better graphics. And that’s actually an impressive sign of growth. It was only several years ago that consumer devices couldn’t even approach the TFLOP level, and now we’re talking casually about devices having 6 to 11 TFLOPs without thinking twice. In the world of supercomputers, it’s even more impressive. Researchers who compare specs are now discussing supercomputers that have more than 100 petaflops, and a petaflop is a thousand teraflops.\nBottom line: What should I think when I see the TFLOP specs? Think of this as the equivalent of a dude talking about how much he can lift in the gym. If a ripped dude says he can bench 300 pounds, then it’s a good bet he can bench a lot, even if the actual figure has been fudged a bit for self-serving purposes.\nBut a weight-lifting championship isn’t going to take contestants at their word, and you should practice the same skepticism when looking at devices and Quote: d TFLOPs. Ultimately, it’s real-world performance that matters most.\nThe best laptop you can buy How to care for your laptop’s battery Roku Express vs. Chromecast vs. Fire TV Stick vs. Roku Streaming Stick",

      "title": "What’s are TFLOPs, and why do you keep hearing about them?",
      "text": "  \nWhether it’s the latest reveals about the powerful Microsoft Scorpio project for Xbox or the newest release on AMD GPUs, you may see the term “TFLOP” being tossed around. If you don’t really know that this means or why you should care about it, then you’ve come to the right place! Let’s talk through the term and why it can be important when talking about processors. Okay, what is a TFLOP? \nTFLOP is a bit of shorthand for “teraflop,” which is a way of measuring the power of a computer based more on mathematical capability than GHz. A teraflop refers to the capability of a processor to calculate one trillion floating-point operations per second. Saying something has “6 TFLOPS,” for example, means that its processor setup is capable of handling 6 trillion floating-point calculations every second, on average. Well, I’m already lost. What are floating-point calculations? \nFloating-point calculations are a common way of gauging the computational power of computers. In fact, once we started using FLOPs, it quickly became a common international standard for talking about computer prowess. \nAs you may (or may not) remember from math classes, floating-point, or “real” numbers, are a set of all numbers including integers, numbers with decimal points, irrational numbers like pi, and so on. From a computational standpoint, a floating-point calculation is any finite calculation that uses floating-point numbers, particularly decimals. This is far more useful than looking at fixed-point calculations (which use only whole integers), because the work that computers do frequently involves finite floating-point numbers and all their real world complications. \nSo, FLOPS measure how many equations involving floating-point numbers that a processor can solve in one second. There is a lot of variance in the FLOPS that various devices need. A traditional calculator, for example, may need only around 10 FLOPS for all its operations. So when we start talking about megaflops (a million floating-point calculations), gigaflops (a billion) and teraflops (a trillion), you can start to see what sort of power we’re talking about. \nManufacturers frequently include FLOPS as a specification on computers so they can talk about how fast they are in a universal way. However, if you have a custom-built machine and really want to brag about its teraflops, too, then there’s a pretty simple equation that you can use to figure it out: Wait, I’ve seen teraflop data on GPUs, does that mean TFLOPs create graphics, too? \nIt’s all basically the same thing. What we see as computer graphics are a massive number of polygons being rendered and moved into different positions on the screen. But the processor doesn’t draw little pictures, it uses mathematics to describe the shape, characteristics and placement of these polygons. You can think of each angle and position as its own little floating-point calculation—because that’s exactly how the processor sees it. So, more TFLOPs means faster devices and better graphics? \nOften—but not always. In fact, we have seen some GPUs with more teraflops that perform worse than those with fewer TFLOPS. For a general analogy, consider wattage. A floodlight and a spotlight may use same wattage, but they behave in very different ways and have different levels of brightness. Likewise, real-world performance is dependent on things like the structure of the processor, frame buffers, core speed, and other important specifications. \nBut yes—as a guideline, more TFLOPS should mean faster devices and better graphics. And that’s actually an impressive sign of growth. It was only several years ago that consumer devices couldn’t even approach the TFLOP level, and now we’re talking casually about devices having 6 to 11 TFLOPs without thinking twice. In the world of supercomputers, it’s even more impressive. Researchers who compare specs are now discussing supercomputers that have more than 100 petaflops, and a petaflop is a thousand teraflops. Bottom line: What should I think when I see the TFLOP specs? \nThink of this as the equivalent of a dude talking about how much he can lift in the gym. If a ripped dude says he can bench 300 pounds, then it’s a good bet he can bench a lot, even if the actual figure has been fudged a bit for self-serving purposes. \nBut a weight-lifting championship isn’t going to take contestants at their word, and you should practice the same skepticism when looking at devices and quoted TFLOPs. Ultimately, it’s real-world performance that matters most. Also watch: Asus ROG GX700 Hands On",

      "title": "Microsoft ties executive bonuses to diversity: Will it help? - Christian Science Monitor",
      "text": "View Caption of \nMicrosoft announced plans this week to tie executive bonuses to company success at meeting diversity hiring goals, after the number of female hires fell this fall. \nSilicon Valley has long been aware of its diversity problem, and a number of companies have instituted internal plans to achieve greater diversity. Nevertheless, the tech industry still suffers from a massive diversity gap, with minority groups and women making up a small fraction of new hires and corporate boards. \nIs Microsoft’s ambitious executive-reward program a credible path to progress for technology companies? Recommended: Do you speak start-up? An entrepreneurial vocab quiz. \nBonuses helped at Intel. In January 2015, Intel launched a $300 million diversity initiative , which included bonuses for referring diverse applicants . This February, Intel announced that 43 percent of all new hires in 2015 were women or minority applicants, marking a massive success for the strategy. Photos of the Day Photos of the Weekend \nDiversity experts say that companies must remain persistent and innovative in order to attract more minorities and women to Silicon Valley. \n“Diversity and inclusion is something you’ve got to ingrain, you’ve got to keep talking about the business value, you’ve got to keep talking about the impact,” Microsoft’s diversity and inclusion officer, Gwen Houston, told Bloomberg . \nAt the industry level, diversity numbers are dismal. Just 15.5 percent of technology company board positions are held by women , reported The Christian Science Monitor's Ellen Powell in October. She wrote: \nSome of these struggles are societal: Young girls may be taught that engineering isn’t for them, or an absence of role models may make a computing career seem too far out of reach. \nOther issues are institutional. A study of open-source software-development website GitHub found that women are more likely to have their work accepted than men – but only if their gender is unknown . \nMicrosoft’s latest effort was inspired by this year’s decrease in the size of its female workforce. Numbers fell by one percentage point, from 26.8 to 25.8 percent, after the divestment of a Nokia factory that employed a number of women. \nAlthough the raw numbers are discouraging, however, Microsoft says that the company is also tracking positive trends . For example, the percentage of female workers in non-production sectors actually rose this year by about half a percent. And over the past year, Microsoft reports, more than a quarter of new hires were women. \n“We are encouraged by the modest gains we’re seeing in female representation in technical and leadership roles, and even more significantly, by the hiring trends of the past year that resulted from our efforts to recruit top-notch female talent,” wrote Ms. Houston in a Microsoft blog post. \nThe tech company also saw tiny gains in diversity hiring, with African American representation at Microsoft growing from 3.5 to 3.7 percent of the company, and Hispanic/Latino representation increasing from 5.4 percent to 5.5 percent. \nNevertheless, there is still far to go, says Microsoft. Hence the company’s effort to incentivize the hiring of women and ethnic or racial minorities by linking executive bonuses to diversity hiring. \nTechnology companies face several obstacles in diversity efforts. The percentage of STEM degrees awarded to women has shrunk over the past several decades, from 37 percent of engineering graduating classes in the 1980s, to 19 percent today. Recruiting minority groups can also pose a problem. \nMicrosoft’s announcement does not occur in a vacuum, however. A number of enterprising young people have independently developed groups and tools to encourage women and minorities to pursue tech careers, including the Technovation program at Immaculate Conception Academy, which confronts the cultural barriers that often keep women away from STEM fields. \nInnovation is also happening at the entrepreneurial level. In April, the Monitor’s Schuyler Velasco reported on such programs, including a firm called GapJumpers, which is dedicated to connecting qualified potential hires to companies through a blind screening process . \nGroups such as Girls Who Code are also working to break down industry barriers for women of all ages. \nBesides its executive compensation strategy, Microsoft’s new diversity push also involves diversity recruiting campaigns and investing in STEM programs to increase the applicant pool.

      "text": "By Zacks Investment Research Stock Markets 20 hours ago (Nov 19, 2016 01:26AM ET) www.investing.com/analysis/what's-next-for-microsoft-(msft)-stock-200165587 What's Next For Microsoft (MSFT) Stock? By Zacks Investment Research | 20 hours ago (Nov 19, 2016 01:26AM ET) This article has already been saved in your Saved Items Follow \nIt has been about a month since the last earnings report for Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ). Shares have added about 5% in the past month, edging out the S&P 500 in that time frame. \nWill the recent positive trend continue leading up to their next earnings release, or is the stock due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers. \nRecent Earnings \nMicrosoft reported first-quarter fiscal 2017 earnings adjusted for Windows 10 deferrals and currency effect of $0.76 per share, which comfortably surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.68. Revenues (adjusted for Windows 10 deferrals) of $22.33 billion dipped 1.4% sequentially but up 3.1% from the year-ago quarter (up 5% in constant currency or CC) and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $21.54 billion. Key Segment Details Productivity & Business Processes includes the Office and Dynamics CRM businesses. Revenues slipped 4.5% sequentially but increased 5.6% (up 8% CC) on a year-over-year basis to $6.66 billion.The Commercial business (products + Office 365 & related cloud services) revenue was up 5% from year-ago level (up 8% CC). Office 365 saw commercial seat growth of 40% from the year-ago quarter. This is an area of tremendous focus with reselling partners up to 90K in the last quarter as Microsoft goes all out to target the SMB segment.Monthly active users of Office 365 commercial increased 40% year over year to more than 85 million. The company continues to win customers like eBay , Allergen, Exelon (NYSE: EXC ) and Liberty Mutual Insurance. Office 365 commercial revenue soared 51% (up 54% in CC) from the year-ago quarter.Dynamics and cloud services revenue jumped 11% (13% CC). Management noted that more than 70% of new Dynamics enterprise customers are choosing Dynamics online. The company mentioned HP Inc., which is replacing its CRM systems with Dynamics 365 to take advantage of the built-in intelligence feature.Server product and cloud services revenue went up 11% year over year (up 13% in CC). Annuity revenue grew double-digits while transaction revenue declined.The high point was Azure revenue, which soared 121% CC year over year, with Azure compute usage doubling. Microsoft is benefitting from its hybrid and hyperscale cloud, which spans multiple jurisdictions, making it ideal for multinational companies and banks that have operations all over the world and are required to be in compliance with laws of the countries in which they operate. More Personal Computing comprises mainly the Windows, Gaming, Devices and Search businesses Revenues increased 4.5% sequentially but slipped 1.8% (1% CC) year over year to $9.29 billion.Windows OEM Pro revenue increased 1% year over year (due to stabilization in the commercial PC market in the U.S.). Non Pro revenue declined 1% (on the back of a higher premium mix) from the year-ago quarter.Windows commercial products and cloud services revenue was flat on a year-over-year basis (up 2% in CC) driven by annuity revenue.Gaming revenue dropped 4% in CC; Xbox Live monthly active users were up 21% to 47 million. The company witnessed more than 20 billion hours of gameplay on Windows 10 PCs and tablets; more than 500% jump on a year-over-year basis. Operating Results Microsoft’s gross margin of 61.6% surged 40 basis points (bps) sequentially but down 300 bps from the year-ago quarter (gross profit dollars were almost flat sequentially but dropped 4.3% year over year).The growth in gross profit dollars by segment was as follows: Productivity up 2% CC (increased mix of cloud offerings and investments in cloud were drivers), Intelligent Cloud 4% CC (again a result of increased mix of cloud offerings) and More Personal Computing 1% CC (search and Windows OEM were drivers neutralized by phones and Xbox). Operating expenses (excluding Impairment, integration, and restructuring costs) of $7.38 billion were down 12.6% sequentially but were flat from the year-ago quarter. However, as percentage of revenues, operating expenses decreased 490 bps sequentially but increased 10 bps on a year-over-year basis. As a result, operating margin expanded 520 bps sequentially but contracted 290 bps on a year-over-year basis to 25.5%.The operating margin by segment was as follows: Productivity 46.9% (up 380 bps sequentially but down 320 bps year over year); Intelligent Cloud 32.2% (down 40 bps sequentially and 830 bps year over year) and More Personal Computing 20.7% (up 990 bps sequentially and 460 bps year over year). Guidance Management said that FX would have a negative 1-point impact on revenue growth in second-quarter fiscal 2017 at both the total company and individual segment levels.For the second quarter, Microsoft expects Productivity & Business Process revenues of $6.9–$7.1 billion, Intelligent Cloud revenues of $6.55–$6.75 billion and More Personal Computing revenue of around $11.2–$11.6 billion. This implies total revenues of between $21.05 billion and $21.25 billion.Management said that 2017 operating expenses would be $31.1–$31.4 billion as investments in strategic growth opportunities continue. The non-GAAP tax rate is expected to be 20% (+/-2%) depending on the variability of factors such as mix of services revenue versus licensing revenue, the geographic mix of revenue and the timing of equity vests. A higher mix of cloud revenue is also anticipated to increase the tax rate. \nHow have estimates been moving since then? \nFollowing the release and in the last month, investors have witnessed a downward trend for fresh estimates. There have been four revisions higher for the current quarter compared to seven lower in the past month. However, the full year figure is pretty bright, as the last month has seen 12 earnings estimate revisions higher compared to two lower. This is helping to long term EPS estimates in the right direction, as you can see in the chart below: MICROSOFT CORP 12 Month EPS \nMICROSOFT CORP 12 Month EPS | MICROSOFT CORP Quote \nVGM Scores \nAt this time, Microsoft's stock has a strong Growth score of 'A', and an equally impressive grade on the momentum front. However, the stock was allocated a grade of 'C' on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy. Overall though, the company has impressive fundamentals, and it has earned itself an 'A' grade for its VGM score. This puts the stock into rare company, as just 20% of securities we rank receive this grade. \nOutlook \nOverall estimate activity has been mixed for MSFT stock. Yes, short term figures aren't great, but ones that look a little further out are more impressive. Due to this back and forth nature, we have shares of MSFT at a Zacks Rank # 3 (hold), meaning we are expecting an in-line return from MSFT in the next few months, though investors focused on growth will likely appreciate the story in Microsoft stock more than most. \nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "text": "What's Next for Microsoft (MSFT) Stock? November 19, 2016, 01:26:00 PM EDT By Zacks Equity Research, Zacks.com Shutterstock photo \nIt has been about a month since the last earnings report for Microsoft (MSFT). Shares have added about 5% in the past month, edging out the S&P 500 in that time frame. \nWill the recent positive trend continue leading up to their next earnings release, or is the stock due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers. \nRecent Earnings \nMicrosoft reported first-quarter fiscal 2017 earnings adjusted for Windows 10 deferrals and currency effect of $0.76 per share, which comfortably surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.68. \nRevenues (adjusted for Windows 10 deferrals) of $22.33 billion dipped 1.4% sequentially but up 3.1% from the year-ago quarter (up 5% in constant currency or CC) and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $21.54 billion. \nKey Segment Details Productivity & Business Processes includes the Office and Dynamics CRM businesses. Revenues slipped 4.5% sequentially but increased 5.6% (up 8% CC) on a year-over-year basis to $6.66 billion. The Commercial business (products + Office 365 & related cloud services) revenue was up 5% from year-ago level (up 8% CC). Office 365 saw commercial seat growth of 40% from the year-ago quarter. This is an area of tremendous focus with reselling partners up to 90K in the last quarter as Microsoft goes all out to target the SMB segment. Monthly active users of Office 365 commercial increased 40% year over year to more than 85 million. The company continues to win customers like eBay , Allergen, Exelon and Liberty Mutual Insurance. Office 365 commercial revenue soared 51% (up 54% in CC) from the year-ago quarter. Dynamics and cloud services revenue jumped 11% (13% CC). Management noted that more than 70% of new Dynamics enterprise customers are choosing Dynamics online. The company mentioned HP Inc., which is replacing its CRM systems with Dynamics 365 to take advantage of the built-in intelligence feature. Server product and cloud services revenue went up 11% year over year (up 13% in CC). Annuity revenue grew double-digits while transaction revenue declined. The high point was Azure revenue, which soared 121% CC year over year, with Azure compute usage doubling. Microsoft is benefitting from its hybrid and hyperscale cloud, which spans multiple jurisdictions, making it ideal for multinational companies and banks that have operations all over the world and are required to be in compliance with laws of the countries in which they operate. More Personal Computing comprises mainly the Windows, Gaming, Devices and Search businesses Revenues increased 4.5% sequentially but slipped 1.8% (1% CC) year over year to $9.29 billion. Windows OEM Pro revenue increased 1% year over year (due to stabilization in the commercial PC market in the U.S.). Non Pro revenue declined 1% (on the back of a higher premium mix) from the year-ago quarter. Windows commercial products and cloud services revenue was flat on a year-over-year basis (up 2% in CC) driven by annuity revenue. Gaming revenue dropped 4% in CC; Xbox Live monthly active users were up 21% to 47 million. The company witnessed more than 20 billion hours of gameplay on Windows 10 PCs and tablets; more than 500% jump on a year-over-year basis. Operating Results Microsoft's gross margin of 61.6% surged 40 basis points (bps) sequentially but down 300 bps from the year-ago quarter (gross profit dollars were almost flat sequentially but dropped 4.3% year over year). The growth in gross profit dollars by segment was as follows: Productivity up 2% CC (increased mix of cloud offerings and investments in cloud were drivers), Intelligent Cloud 4% CC (again a result of increased mix of cloud offerings) and More Personal Computing 1% CC (search and Windows OEM were drivers neutralized by phones and Xbox).\nOperating expenses (excluding Impairment, integration, and restructuring costs) of $7.38 billion were down 12.6% sequentially but were flat from the year-ago quarter. However, as percentage of revenues, operating expenses decreased 490 bps sequentially but increased 10 bps on a year-over-year basis. As a result, operating margin expanded 520 bps sequentially but contracted 290 bps on a year-over-year basis to 25.5%. The operating margin by segment was as follows: Productivity 46.9% (up 380 bps sequentially but down 320 bps year over year); Intelligent Cloud 32.2% (down 40 bps sequentially and 830 bps year over year) and More Personal Computing 20.7% (up 990 bps sequentially and 460 bps year over year). Guidance Management said that FX would have a negative 1-point impact on revenue growth in second-quarter fiscal 2017 at both the total company and individual segment levels. For the second quarter, Microsoft expects Productivity & Business Process revenues of $6.9-$7.1 billion, Intelligent Cloud revenues of $6.55-$6.75 billion and More Personal Computing revenue of around $11.2-$11.6 billion. This implies total revenues of between $21.05 billion and $21.25 billion. Management said that 2017 operating expenses would be $31.1-$31.4 billion as investments in strategic growth opportunities continue. The non-GAAP tax rate is expected to be 20% (+/-2%) depending on the variability of factors such as mix of services revenue versus licensing revenue, the geographic mix of revenue and the timing of equity vests. A higher mix of cloud revenue is also anticipated to increase the tax rate. \nHow have estimates been moving since then? \nFollowing the release and in the last month, investors have witnessed a downward trend for fresh estimates. There have been four revisions higher for the current quarter compared to seven lower in the past month. However, the full year figure is pretty bright, as the last month has seen 12 earnings estimate revisions higher compared to two lower. This is helping to long term EPS estimates in the right direction, as you can see in the chart below: MICROSOFT CORP 12 Month EPS \nMICROSOFT CORP 12 Month EPS | MICROSOFT CORP Quote \nVGM Scores \nAt this time, Microsoft's stock has a strong Growth score of 'A', and an equally impressive grade on the momentum front. However, the stock was allocated a grade of 'C' on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy. Overall though, the company has impressive fundamentals, and it has earned itself an 'A' grade for its VGM score. This puts the stock into rare company, as just 20% of securities we rank receive this grade. \nOutlook \nOverall estimate activity has been mixed for MSFT stock. Yes, short term figures aren't great, but ones that look a little further out are more impressive. Due to this back and forth nature, we have shares of MSFT at a Zacks Rank # 3 (hold), meaning we are expecting an in-line return from MSFT in the next few months, though investors focused on growth will likely appreciate the story in Microsoft stock more than most. \nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

It was designed by Microsoft Garage, a project lab inside the company that allows employees to experiment with projects that aren’t necessarily related to their job descriptions within the company. \nIf you’re not familiar with the term “launcher,” it’s basically the desktop for your phone. Changing the launcher gives your device a new look and can make it easier to use. Here’s the standard Android desktop/launcher for my phone. \nHere’s what the Arrow Launcher looks like. It probably doesn’t look drastically different to you. But there is a subtle difference here you might not notice at first. Arrow arranges the apps on your desktop automatically based on how often you use them. \nArrow also offers a Recent option that shows you the apps you’ve used recently. This reminds you a little bit of the Windows Start menu. \nAlso similar to Windows 10, is the People section that pulls your contacts from mail, social media, and messaging together in once place. \nIf you use Microsoft Office, you’ll like the Documents section that takes you directly to your Office files. \nIf also offers daily updates of some gorgeous Bing wallpapers. \nBest of all, it’s absolutely free from the Google Play Store. Just type Arrow Launcher into the search field, then tap Install. \nLet us know what you think! \n~ Cynthia \nTags: android launcher , Arrow Launcher , free apps , microsoft , Microsoft Garage , smartphones This entry was posted on Sunday, November 20th, 2016 at 11:01 AM and is filed under Android , Desktop Enhancement , Smartphones .

      "text": "Lady Gaga arrives for the 2016 American Music Awards, November 20, 2016 at the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles, California. / AFP / Valerie Macon (Photo credit should read VALERIE MACON/AFP/Getty Images) PHOTO: AFP/Getty Images \nAt the 2016 American Music Awards , songbird Lady Gaga wore a pantsuit that perhaps was a homage to her unofficial pantsuit-wearing hero, Hillary Clinton . Wonder if she's one of the millions of women who are a part of Pantsuit Nation . \nDuring the American Music Awards, Lady Gaga walked the red carpet in a chic white pantsuit that she paired with a dramatic, wide-brimmed white hat. The oversized hat, as many Monsters will recall, is a look Gaga has been rocking since her album Joanne dropped in October. But her white pantsuit was a subtle and unmistakable fashion statement of its own that honors Hillary Clinton, the 2016 election, and suffragists. \nGaga's outfit was a more bold version of Clinton's DNC pantsuit , which was a nod to suffragists who used the color to represent their cause. On election day, Clinton voters showed support for their candidate by wearing white (and pantsuits) to the polls, in turn honoring the first female to represent a major party in a presidential election. (Gaga donned an apropos white look to vote.) \nThe singer has been a very vocal supporter of Clinton's, speaking at the Democratic nominee's rallies prior to the election and even taking to the streets on November 8th to protest Donald Trump's win. And though she didn't wear a pantsuit on stage for her performance, we're still thinking she literally gave Hillary Clinton a hat tip on the red carpet. \nNow, check out these 13 feminist quotes from Buzzfeed to inspire you: Keywords:",

      "text": "RSS 21 Nov 2016 1:33 AM \nWhen it comes to transitioning to the next generation of marketing and customer engagement automation tools from Microsoft, there are a few topics of interest: The life cycle of Dynamics Marketing Migration and My Data questions Licensing questions in relation to the next generation of tools \nHow customer of Microsoft Dynamics Marketing best migrate to the next generation of marketing tools from Microsoft –“Dynamics 365 for Marketing, Business edition” \nAs an existing customer of Dynamic Marketing feel free to continue using the product throughout the ongoing subscription period. You may extend your subscription once from now to October 2017. For Direct purchase customer, the subscription period renews for one year, for Enterprise customers for 3 years. Microsoft is committed to provide full support for the product throughout your subscription. \nWe will continue to provide service allow adding more users and purchase of add-ons like email volumes throughout the subscription period. Microsoft will continue to support the product in that period fully, including the case of a hotfixes for observed issues. Yet we will eventually ramp down on the flow of monthly enhancements. We will instead fully focus our development on the new marketing app from Microsoft –“Dynamics 365 for Marketing, Business edition”. This new app will be available for Dynamics 365 customers in Spring release 2017. This will be an online release only in Spring 2017. Starting November 1, 2016, we have stopped selling Dynamics Marketing to new customers. \nThe spring release will focus on the topics of Customer engagement automation (campaigns), email and Web channels including content designer and templates, event management and event marketing, Integration and customer Intelligence including segmentation and analytics. \nHow will I in the future can move to the new generation of marketing tools from Microsoft: “Dynamics 365 for Marketing”? \nIf you are using the Dynamics CRM Connector for Dynamics Marketing today to connect Dynamics Marketing with your CRMOL instance today, you will find that the master data are already synchronized between the two systems. While you will find that you will need to reimplement campaigns and email messages with the new more powerful functionality in the new marketing app, you will also find that your audience and the lists you are syncing already today will continue to be in Dynamics 365 as well. We are looking at more tooling that help you with the transition. \nAnother option will be to continue using Dynamics Marketing running your existing customer engagement automation – some of which might have planned to run continuously for several months. By using the new app Dynamics 365 for Marketing, Business edition gradually more and more you will find the transition a smooth process. \nWhat if I don’t want to transition to “Dynamics 365 for Marketing, Business edition”? \nYou may continue use the Dynamics Marketing until the end of your subscription (including the renewal you may be able to acquire, if you wish to do so.) \nWhat happens to my data in Dynamics Marketing? \nUpon the end of your subscription all customer data will be kept for maximum of 90 days. Before the subscription ends you may use the various functions for exporting data in Dynamics marketing to take a copy of records you like to take a hold of – if you need to do so. \nMost objects provide an export to Excel function on the list representation. The OData endpoint together with Power Query and Excel is another good excellent tool to take a snapshot of relevant data in your Dynamics Marketing. \nWhat about my product licenses, can I continue using them and when can I transition? \nLicense plans will be available toward the Spring 2017 release.

      "title": "Project Mercury: improve responsiveness in heavy load situations",
      "text": "Project Mercury is a tiny portable program for Microsoft Windows devices to improve the responsiveness in heavy load situations.\nThe application has been designed specifically for situations where you are running multiple programs on the system that use a lot of system resources.\nThink of playing a computer game in fullscreen, running messaging apps in the background, a Torrent client, web browser with lots of tabs, or any other program that uses a good chunk of the system's resources.\nThis is achieved partially by increasing the process priority of the foreground application automatically when Project Mercury is run. While that is part of what the application offers, there is a lot more to it than that.\nNote : The program displays a nag screen at times stating that it will go away in the donator's version. This seems to happen only when you modify preferences though.\nProject Mercury \nThe program is available as a 32-bit and 64-bit version for Windows. Simply download it and run it to get started.\nIt is recommended to run Project Mercury with elevated rights. While you don't have to do it to start the program, it can only work its magic on other programs with elevated rights if you do so.\nTo run it with administrative privileges, right-click on the downloaded file and select \"run as administrator\" from the context menu.\nProject Mercury launches and adds an icon to the Windows System Tray. Right-click on the icon and select Settings to configure the program.\nPlease note that it is not necessary to configure it if you are fine with the default settings. It is recommended though to check the settings at least once as you may find useful preferences there that you may want to make use of.\nAll preferences are displayed on a single page (that you see on the screenshot above).\nOnly a handful of preferences are enabled by default: the automatic increase of the priority level of the active application to above normal, the automatic lowering of the cpu priority on minimize, and the 0ms Windows System Timer interval.\nThe following options are provided besides those (all marked with a * are recommended by the author of the program) :\nNo Hyper-Threading conflicts -- Disables every other core the focused program uses to avoid reduced performance from threading conflicts. No multicore stutter -- May prevent stutter for programs that use only a single core even though multiple cores are available. Reduce memory on minimize -- When enabled, tries to free memory. Forces programs to use the swap file to free up physical memory. Excessive mode -- Monitors process performance. Will reduce the priority of any process that uses more than 50% CPU to below normal. Windows CPU slice (permanent) -- Defines how Windows schedules and handles CPU time. May be set to default, desktop,server, multitasking or gamer. Disable Core Parking -- Core Parking is a power saving feature. The feature may impact performance negatively when you run multi-threaded software according to the developer. Only tested on Intel processors by the author. May yield performance increases of up to 20% for affected programs. Windows Fast React -- Makes switching between application windows faster and smoother. Disable standby on CPU load -- Disables standby power saving mode if the CPU load is 8% or more. Balloon top on priority adjustment -- This displays a notification whenever the priority is adjusted. Start as Administrator -- Will launch the program with elevated rights automatically when selected (which triggers an UAC prompt on start). Closing Words Project Mercury is a well designed program for Microsoft Windows devices that will improve the performance and responsiveness of the system in high load situations.\nWhile its core functionality is only useful if CPU load is high, some of the program's other tweaks are useful regardless of that.\nThe program is ultra-lightweight when it runs as it uses about 1.3 Megabyte of memory and a bit of CPU every now and then.\nNow You : How often do you experience high load situations on Windows?\nGhacks needs you.

      "title": "What's Next for Microsoft (MSFT) Stock? - November 19, 2016 - Zacks.com",
      "text": "It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Microsoft ( MSFT - Free Report ) . Shares have added about 5% in the past month, edging out the S&P 500 in that time frame.\nWill the recent positive trend continue leading up to their next earnings release, or is the stock due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.\nRecent Earnings \nMicrosoft  reported first-quarter fiscal 2017 earnings adjusted for Windows 10 deferrals and currency effect of $0.76 per share, which comfortably surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.68. \nRevenues (adjusted for Windows 10 deferrals) of $22.33 billion dipped 1.4% sequentially but up 3.1% from the year-ago quarter (up 5% in constant currency or CC) and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $21.54 billion.\n \nKey Segment Details \n\nProductivity & Business Processes includes the Office and Dynamics CRM businesses. Revenues slipped 4.5% sequentially but increased 5.6% (up 8% CC) on a year-over-year basis to $6.66 billion.\n\nThe Commercial business (products + Office 365 & related cloud services) revenue was up 5% from year-ago level (up 8% CC). Office 365 saw commercial seat growth of 40% from the year-ago quarter. This is an area of tremendous focus with reselling partners up to 90K in the last quarter as Microsoft goes all out to target the SMB segment.\n\nMonthly active users of Office 365 commercial increased 40% year over year to more than 85 million. The company continues to win customers like eBay , Allergen, Exelon and Liberty Mutual Insurance. Office 365 commercial revenue soared 51% (up 54% in CC) from the year-ago quarter.\n\nDynamics and cloud services revenue jumped 11% (13% CC). Management noted that more than 70% of new Dynamics enterprise customers are choosing Dynamics online. The company mentioned HP Inc., which is replacing its CRM systems with Dynamics 365 to take advantage of the built-in intelligence feature.\n\nServer product and cloud services revenue went up 11% year over year (up 13% in CC). Annuity revenue grew double-digits while transaction revenue declined.\n\nThe high point was Azure revenue, which soared 121% CC year over year, with Azure compute usage doubling. Microsoft is benefitting from its hybrid and hyperscale cloud, which spans multiple jurisdictions, making it ideal for multinational companies and banks that have operations all over the world and are required to be in compliance with laws of the countries in which they operate.\n\nMore Personal Computing comprises mainly the Windows, Gaming, Devices and Search businesses Revenues increased 4.5% sequentially but slipped 1.8% (1% CC) year over year to $9.29 billion.\n\nWindows OEM Pro revenue increased 1% year over year (due to stabilization in the commercial PC market in the U.S.). Non Pro revenue declined 1% (on the back of a higher premium mix) from the year-ago quarter.\n\nWindows commercial products and cloud services revenue was flat on a year-over-year basis (up 2% in CC) driven by annuity revenue.\n\nGaming revenue dropped 4% in CC; Xbox Live monthly active users were up 21% to 47 million. The company witnessed more than 20 billion hours of gameplay on Windows 10 PCs and tablets; more than 500% jump on a year-over-year basis.\n\nOperating Results \n\nMicrosoft’s gross margin of 61.6% surged 40 basis points (bps) sequentially but down 300 bps from the year-ago quarter (gross profit dollars were almost flat sequentially but dropped 4.3% year over year).\n\nThe growth in gross profit dollars by segment was as follows: Productivity up 2% CC (increased mix of cloud offerings and investments in cloud were drivers), Intelligent Cloud 4% CC (again a result of increased mix of cloud offerings) and More Personal Computing 1% CC (search and Windows OEM were drivers neutralized by phones and Xbox).\nOperating expenses (excluding Impairment, integration, and restructuring costs) of $7.38 billion were down 12.6% sequentially but were flat from the year-ago quarter. However, as percentage of revenues, operating expenses decreased 490 bps sequentially but increased 10 bps on a year-over-year basis. As a result, operating margin expanded 520 bps sequentially but contracted 290 bps on a year-over-year basis to 25.5%.\n\nThe operating margin by segment was as follows: Productivity 46.9% (up 380 bps sequentially but down 320 bps year over year); Intelligent Cloud 32.2% (down 40 bps sequentially and 830 bps year over year) and More Personal Computing 20.7% (up 990 bps sequentially and 460 bps year over year).\n\nGuidance \n\nManagement said that FX would have a negative 1-point impact on revenue growth in second-quarter fiscal 2017 at both the total company and individual segment levels.\n\nFor the second quarter, Microsoft expects Productivity & Business Process revenues of $6.9–$7.1 billion, Intelligent Cloud revenues of $6.55–$6.75 billion and More Personal Computing revenue of around $11.2–$11.6    billion. This implies total revenues of between $21.05 billion and $21.25 billion.\n\nManagement said that 2017 operating expenses would be $31.1–$31.4 billion as investments in strategic growth opportunities continue. The non-GAAP tax rate is expected to be 20% (+/-2%) depending on the variability of factors such as mix of services revenue versus licensing revenue, the geographic mix of revenue and the timing of equity vests. A higher mix of cloud revenue is also anticipated to increase the tax rate.\n \nHow have estimates been moving since then? \nFollowing the release and in the last month, investors have witnessed a downward trend for fresh estimates. There have been four revisions higher for the current quarter compared to seven lower in the past month. However, the full year figure is pretty bright, as the last month has seen 12 earnings estimate revisions higher compared to two lower. This is helping to long term EPS estimates in the right direction, as you can see in the chart below: \n \nMICROSOFT CORP 12 Month EPS MICROSOFT CORP 12 Month EPS | MICROSOFT CORP Quote \n \nVGM Scores \nAt this time, Microsoft's stock has a strong Growth score of 'A', and an equally impressive grade on the momentum front. However, the stock was allocated a grade of 'C' on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy. Overall though, the company has impressive fundamentals, and it has earned itself an 'A' grade for its VGM score. This puts the stock into rare company, as just 20% of securities we rank receive this grade. \nOutlook \nOverall estimate activity has been mixed for MSFT stock. Yes, short term figures aren't great, but ones that look a little further out are more impressive. Due to this back and forth nature, we have shares of MSFT at a Zacks Rank # 3 (hold), meaning we are expecting an in-line return from MSFT in the next few months, though investors focused on growth will likely appreciate the story in Microsoft stock more than most.",

      "text": "Microsoft ties executive bonuses to meeting diversity goals. Will it help? Latest News Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella addresses a Microsoft media event in New York, Oct. 26. Richard Drew/AP/File View Caption of \nMicrosoft announced plans this week to tie executive bonuses to company success at meeting diversity hiring goals, after the number of female hires fell this fall. \nSilicon Valley has long been aware of its diversity problem, and a number of companies have instituted internal plans to achieve greater diversity. Nevertheless, the tech industry still suffers from a massive diversity gap, with minority groups and women making up a small fraction of new hires and corporate boards. \nIs Microsoft’s ambitious executive-reward program a credible path to progress for technology companies? Recommended: Do you speak start-up? An entrepreneurial vocab quiz. \nBonuses helped at Intel. In January 2015, Intel launched a $300 million diversity initiative , which included bonuses for referring diverse applicants . This February, Intel announced that 43 percent of all new hires in 2015 were women or minority applicants, marking a massive success for the strategy. Photos of the Day Photos of the Weekend \nDiversity experts say that companies must remain persistent and innovative in order to attract more minorities and women to Silicon Valley. \n“Diversity and inclusion is something you’ve got to ingrain, you’ve got to keep talking about the business value, you’ve got to keep talking about the impact,” Microsoft’s diversity and inclusion officer, Gwen Houston, told Bloomberg . \nAt the industry level, diversity numbers are dismal. Just 15.5 percent of technology company board positions are held by women , reported The Christian Science Monitor's Ellen Powell in October. She wrote: \nSome of these struggles are societal: Young girls may be taught that engineering isn’t for them, or an absence of role models may make a computing career seem too far out of reach. \nOther issues are institutional. A study of open-source software-development website GitHub found that women are more likely to have their work accepted than men – but only if their gender is unknown . \nMicrosoft’s latest effort was inspired by this year’s decrease in the size of its female workforce. Numbers fell by one percentage point, from 26.8 to 25.8 percent, after the divestment of a Nokia factory that employed a number of women. \nAlthough the raw numbers are discouraging, however, Microsoft says that the company is also tracking positive trends . For example, the percentage of female workers in non-production sectors actually rose this year by about half a percent. And over the past year, Microsoft reports, more than a quarter of new hires were women. \n“We are encouraged by the modest gains we’re seeing in female representation in technical and leadership roles, and even more significantly, by the hiring trends of the past year that resulted from our efforts to recruit top-notch female talent,” wrote Ms. Houston in a Microsoft blog post. \nThe tech company also saw tiny gains in diversity hiring, with African American representation at Microsoft growing from 3.5 to 3.7 percent of the company, and Hispanic/Latino representation increasing from 5.4 percent to 5.5 percent. \nNevertheless, there is still far to go, says Microsoft. Hence the company’s effort to incentivize the hiring of women and ethnic or racial minorities by linking executive bonuses to diversity hiring. \nTechnology companies face several obstacles in diversity efforts. The percentage of STEM degrees awarded to women has shrunk over the past several decades, from 37 percent of engineering graduating classes in the 1980s, to 19 percent today. Recruiting minority groups can also pose a problem. \nMicrosoft’s announcement does not occur in a vacuum, however. A number of enterprising young people have independently developed groups and tools to encourage women and minorities to pursue tech careers, including the Technovation program at Immaculate Conception Academy, which confronts the cultural barriers that often keep women away from STEM fields. \nInnovation is also happening at the entrepreneurial level. In April, the Monitor’s Schuyler Velasco reported on such programs, including a firm called GapJumpers, which is dedicated to connecting qualified potential hires to companies through a blind screening process . \nGroups such as Girls Who Code are also working to break down industry barriers for women of all ages. \nBesides its executive compensation strategy, Microsoft’s new diversity push also involves diversity recruiting campaigns and investing in STEM programs to increase the applicant pool.

Please check about the struggle they've been going through trying to do one significant release after Win7. Windows 8, Windows 8.1 & even Win10 are put in the \"Not-so-successful\" bucket. Windows 8 in \"Failed\" bucket. I think Win10 has got some potential to shine. May be. And as a whole, the PC biz is nose diving for the last 3-4 years. It's not only a problem for MS but also for Intel. Yes , Macs have exploited this erosion in PC sales. The sales charts clearly tells us there's a stark decline in PCs & a gradual, steady increase in Macs. (Intel might enjoy some success with their core ix processors in Macs, don't know how long this goes) Did you notice one subtle matter here? It's not actually a problem just with the OS. It's the device as a whole now. I feel the days are gone we look for new OS on the same machine. Most home consumers don't care what OS is inside as long as they look attractive and intuitive. Just an UI theme updates & some \"cool\" tools added is good enough to make them believe their OS is updated. I guess MS might soon give up the concept of charging money for OS upgrades forever. Making good OS is needed but putting them on right devices, in a neat way looks more important now. Apple capitalized it so well with a flashy OS and an attractive hardware. Now with new surface devices, did you see MS making some gains? Surface Pro 4, has won good reviews & sales reports were also up. I guess the new Surface devices with neat Win10+ OS might make a come back? \"Cool\" it's always said in a context. Depends on the guy who's saying it. For me, Getting jobs done neatly, cost effectively is COOL. Starting to think people post kid pics in their profiles because that was the last time they were cute - Jeremy.",

      "text": "Read More \nQubits correspond to the 1s and 0s in conventional computing, but they can achieve 'superposition' or be in both states simultaneously, opening the possibility of running many more calculations and ultimately faster processing. \nThe New York Times notes that Microsoft is focusing on 'braiding' particles as the foundation of a quantum computer. \nMicrosoft's researchers believe that topological qubits offer better resistance to electrical noise and heat, and are therefore less prone to self-destructing. \n\"We're at an inflection point in which we are ready to go from research to engineering,\" Holmdahl said. \nUntil now, much of Microsoft's work on quantum computing has been run through its Station Q laboratory , which it launched in 2005. One year earlier, Station Q director Michael Freedman proposed that Microsoft should use topological mathematics as a stable way for moving qubits. \nSignaling Microsoft's intent to shift gears from theory to practice, the researchers will become Microsoft employees under the recently-launched Artificial Intelligence and Research Group. \nThe group is responsible for corralling Microsoft's research in AI and turning these breakthroughs into products, either embedded in existing platforms, such as Office 365, or integrated into Azure cloud offerings. \nMicrosoft thinks quantum computing will ultimately give it a more powerful cloud that could speed some of the challenges it's using AI to crack, ranging from medicine to environmental issues. \n\"There is a real opportunity to apply these computers to things that I'll call material sciences of physical systems,\" Holmdahl said. \n\"A lot of these problems are intractable on a classical computer, but on a quantum computer we believe that they are tractable in a reasonable period of time.\" \nHolmdahl toldthe New York Times that once Microsoft has figured out how to build the first qubit, it has a roadmap that will allow it to scale up to thousands of qubits.

      "text": "Microsoft claims Edge is safer than Firefox in new Windows 10 notifications Posted 21 November 2016 17:39 CET by Jan Willem Aldershoff \nSeveral users report that they’ve received notifications in Windows 10 stating that Mozilla Firefox is less secure than Edge. The notifications recommend users to switch to Microsoft’s browser. \nIt’s not the first time that Microsoft uses the taskbar to criticize competing products and to recommend its own browser. Previously Microsoft did the same with Google Chrome. The new notification states: “Microsoft Edge is safer than Firefox. It blocks 21% more socially engineered malware. Learn more.” \nThe report on which the 21% is based is also criticized. It was compiled by NSS Labs but commissioned by Microsoft. \nMicrosoft doesn’t see any harm in the notifications. According to the software giant, they are even helpful to users to improve their Windows 10 experience. The company also stresses that users can easily disable the notifications. \nUsers previously criticized Microsoft for increasingly using the taskbar for showing notifications. Many users consider them to be advertisements but Microsoft insists they are tips and that the taskbar, in contrary to the lockscreen, isn’t used to show advertisements.",

      "text": "  Photo Windows Movie Maker, Microsoft’s free video-editing program, will be discontinued next year but the company has promised a Windows 10-compatible replacement. Credit The New York Times Q. Microsoft hasn’t updated Windows Movie Maker in years. I have it on my Windows 10 PC from when I upgraded the computer from Windows 8, but will there ever be a proper app version for Windows 10? A. Windows Movie Maker has been around for more than 15 years, but it has not been updated since the version that was included with the Windows Essentials 2012 software suite. The program is still available for download from Microsoft’s site for some versions of Windows, but not for much longer: The company says the software will reach the end of its support on Jan. 10, 2017 . The same page of release notes for Windows Essentials 2012 also says Movie Maker will soon be available from the Windows Store for Windows 10 users. At the moment, however, the Windows Store has Microsoft’s Movie Moments app for 60-second creations and several similarly named moviemaking apps, but no new edition from Microsoft — yet. If you do not want to use the outdated version of Windows Movie Maker and do not see any apps in the Windows Store that fit your needs, you can find several open-source video-editing programs and alternative applications for Windows around the web. Free editing programs save money, but they may require more expertise to install and may not include dedicated technical support (aside from web documentation). Some freeware apps may also be ad-supported. Commercial video-editing tools for Windows can cost hundreds of dollars, but several consumer-oriented programs cost much less. For example, the standard edition of Pinnacle Studio 20 has a regular price of $60 (with slightly more expensive versions that include more features). Adobe Premiere Elements 15 costs around $100, but it is on sale for $60 until Nov. 30. You can also download a free trial version from Adobe’s site first. Magix Movie Edit Pro , normally $120, is on sale for $50 until the end of the month. \nPersonal Tech invites questions about computer-based technology to .

But Microsoft has announced recently that this year the company is not focusing on the Surface Phone, as reported by Christian Today . \nEven though the company has not yet confirmed any details, Microsoft Surface Phone could be launched in a press event that is scheduled for April 2017. \nSurface Phone is expected to be the turning point of Windows-based smartphones that will basically ditch out a huge success achieved by Android and iOS. In addition, the upcoming phone is anticipated to have three new size variants, 8GB of RAM coupled with 512GB internal storage capacity that is powered by Intel Kaby Lake and 20MP Carl Zeiss back camera. \nThe upcoming device is expected to come with fingerprint scanner embedded in an AMOLED screen display of 1440 x 2560 resolution that is similar to Apple iPhone 8 and Samsung Galaxy S8. \nSurface Phone is also rumored to be fitted with Type C USB port for easy external connections and the data transfers according to some speculations . \nThe release date of the upcoming Surface Phone is yet to be confirmed. As Microsoft executive Terry Myerson said that the Surface phone was not the company's focus in 2016. But rumors are suggesting that it can make a look in the market in April 2017. \n",

      "title": "Microsoft’s Push To Turn Your Phone Into A PC Arrives With Redstone 3",
      "text": "\nIn the second half of 2017, Microsoft is working towards the release of Redstone 3, this is the next update coming to Windows 10 after the release of the Creators update that is set to arrive in the Spring. According to new information from both public and internal sources, Microsoft is working on an emulation layer for ARM chips to run x86 applications.\nThis information, which I had been hearing for some time gains more credibility with a discussion I had last night with WalkingCat on Twitter who has uncovered the tools to making this emulation possible. Currently called CHPE, this tool allows for emulation of x86 on ARM and we should see this sometime next year.\nMary Jo Foley was able to dig up more information about the platform, which is currently called “Cobalt”; this emulation is targeted at phones/desktop and not the server market. To further add credibility to this information, the release of Redstone 3 aligns with Snapdragon 830 that will contain virtualization capabilities that will further make this emulation of x86 on ARM a reality.\nIf Microsoft is able to pull off emulation successfully, in a way that does not have a significant performance hit, this will be a huge shift for computing. Currently, the biggest limit of ARM chips is not performance, price, heat, or availability, but its lack of capability to run legacy applications. This technology, provided it works well, has the ability to patch that gap and will help Microsoft finally obtain market share in the mobile space.\nMicrosoft already has Windows 10 running on ARM and if they can make legacy applications run on our phones, without the need for an external streaming-virtualization service, this makes carrying one device for all your computing needs much closer to reality. Continuum, which is already available today with Windows 10 mobile, allows you to use your phone like a desktop but it’s limited in terms of performance and available applications.\nIf Intel isn’t paying close attention, this could have a huge impact on that company’s operation. The chip manufacturer has failed to find a way to successfully compete with ARM chips at either price point, performance or thermal footprint, which has left them high and dry in the phone marketplace. If and when ARM chips can run legacy applications, Intel’s stronghold in the desktop space could be in jeopardy as it could be possible to buy a desktop that runs every application you need but uses an ARM processor.\nFurther, by emulating x86 on ARM, this is a huge win for security too. Currently, if an x86 application is malicious, we are dependent on preventative software to stop the processes and protect our data. By emulating x86, it’s much easier to contain, destroy and prevent malicious code from accessing sensitive data or infecting the core OS at its root.\nIt’s likely that the first iteration of the emulation of x86 will not be at a level of performance required to run intensive applications but if the initial process shows potential and the correct investments are made, the next few years are likely to see a dramatic shift in how PCs are built.\nThe post Microsoft’s Push To Turn Your Phone Into A PC Arrives With Redstone 3 appeared first on Petri .\n",

      "text": "Another red carpet, another sky-high ponytail for Ariana Grande.\nThe singer arrived at Microsoft Theater on Sunday night wearing a vintage lace bustier and white Alexander McQueen trousers, along with her signature updo (which featured a couple small braids for added flourish).\nThe I Dream of Jeannie-esque style seems to have sparked a movement, as both Bailee Madison - who rocked a glittering deep-v gown - and Karlie Kloss, in an Atelier Versace couture ensemble, took the ponytail for a spin, too.\nRead more: Chrissy Teigen Sets Record for Highest Leg Slit Ever\nIn true Grande style, both Madison and Kloss wore the super-sleek look with a strand of hair wrapped around the ponytail's base, and not one single hair out of place.\nTaraji P. Henson, on the other hand, opted for a low ponytail - but it still had plenty of drama. The actress paired her Celine shirt dress with a bum-grazing pony and striking purple lip.\nKevin Mazur/AMA2016/WireImage",

      "text": "Microsoft ties executive bonuses to diversity initiatives HV By Haley Velasco  34pm Microsoft ties executive bonuses to diversity initiatives / Courtesy of Microsoft \nMicrosoft will tie executive bonuses to the company’s diversity efforts after the company saw its second year of a declining number of women employees, according to a report in Bloomberg . \nLast year, Microsoft wrote off Nokia’s handset unit and fired 7,800 employees after CEO Satya Nadella decided to restructure the phone business placing less emphasis on smartphones. The company saw the percentage of female employees drop from 26.8 to 25.8%. \n\"The workforce reductions resulting from the restructure of our phone hardware business impacted factory and production facilities outside the US that produce handsets and hardware, and a higher percentage of those jobs were held by women,” said Gwen Houston in a blog post following 2015. “As I look at our numbers, I see a story that to some degree is being repeated throughout the industry. While certain leading indicators are trending up and we are starting to see signs of progress, systemic challenges remain when it comes to increasing the presence of women and minorities at all levels of the workforce.” \nThe percentage of African American/Black and Hispanic/Latino employees saw “very modest gains” of 0.2% to 3.7% of Microsoft’s total workforce and 0.1% to 5.5% of employees, respectively, according to Houston. \n“The modest gains for people of color — those are so slight I really want to see them improve,” Houston said in a statement. “That’s an area of focus that I am really committed to.” \nIn 2014, Nadella made a promise to change the lack of diversity at Microsoft . \n\"We are focused on ensuring that Microsoft will be the best place to work for smart, curious people across cultures, genders, ethnicities, and lifestyles,” Nadella said. “We will make progress every year towards building a more diverse workforce and creating opportunities at every level of the company for all of Microsoft's employees.\" \nTo work on this at Microsoft, the company has added specialized human resources to target the hiring of qualified women and minorities, as well as tripling the funding for an internship program called Explorer for college freshman and sophomores interested in technology. \nAccording to Houston, Microsoft is running focus groups in several US cities with underrepresented groups to ask participants what would motivate them to choose tech careers to improve advertising and recruiting campaigns.",

It will be much easier to follow this tutorial if you refer to the workbook. In this file, I have all basic information related to cost like name, date, price per unit and quality purchased. But crucial information Current Market is missing. And to get real time updated information related to these shares, we need to follow these simple step Step: 1 Open Internet Browser and type http://money.rediff.com/index.html and Select More Gainer. This link simply provides information related to all shares who gained at that point of time i.e. Current market price is more than opening price. \nStep -2 Select and Copy the path \nStep 3 Go to Microsoft Excel and create new sheet (Short Cut key Alt+ F11) and name it as “Gainer” \nStep -4 Go to “From Web” under Data Tab Step 5 Paste link http://money.rediff.com/gainers/ bse /daily/groupa?src=gain_lose in A ddress tab and click go. \nHave a patience for a movement till the full page is getting to be loaded. \nStep 7 click this option to select the entire page \nStep 8 Click on Import button \nStep 9 Go to properties Step 10 Name this connection as “Gainer_Information”, “Enable” Save query definition,“Disable”background refresh and Refresh every 10 minutes etc. and click enter. In this step I modified the default properties according to my needs, you may select something else and for example you may disable R efresh data when opening the file. \nStep 11 Select OK \nStep 12 all Information related Gainers are loaded into Gainersheet. Now we created a connected price information for all shares who gained during the day i.e. it will be updated automatically after each span of 10 minutes.But this connection contain only information related to gainers not for losers. And there is equal possibility that the price of our shares might not be gaining always and information related to those share will not be reflected in this imported data. Therefore we need to again create one more connection for those shares who lose during the day and repeat all steps to create one connection for losers. \nStep 13 Create One More sheet and name it as Losers \nStep 14 Go to the From Web under Data tab Step 15 Paste http://money.rediff.com/gainers/bse/daily/groupa?src=gain_lose in Address tab and click go. \nStep 16 Go to Losers option and select daily \nStep 17 Select entire range and Import into Microsoft Excel \nStep 18 Change properties details Step 17 ion”Name this connection as “Losers_Informat, “Enable” Save query definition, “Disable” background refresh and Refresh every 10 minutes etc. and click enter. \nStep 18 Press ok \nStep 20 all Information related Losers are loaded into Losers sheet. \nNow we successfully created connection for both Gainer and Losers current market price information listed on BSE. \nStep 21 Now Come to the Main Report sheet and type a simple Vlookup function to get latest updated information for our Shares \n=IFERROR(VLOOKUP(B4,Gainer!A:E,4,FALSE),VLOOKUP(Report!B4,Losers!A:E,4,FALSE)) In this formula I use VLOOKUP along with IFERROR function because while using only =VLOOKUP(B4,Gainer!A:E,4,FALSE) result will be #NA. it means share information related to SBI is not available in Gainer Sheet. Share Information related to SBI is in Losers information. That the main reason why I use IFERROR function with VLOOKUP, if information related to any share is not available in gainer sheet the formula will switch to get information from losers sheet. Step 21 Simply multiply Current Market Price with no of share (D4*G4)held to get current market value. Step 22 Deduct Total Cost from Current Market price (H4-F4) to compute the oritical information related to gain/or loss. \nStep 23 Copy and paste all Formula created in previous two step into other cells \nFinally we learned how to create dynamic Excel File which is linked with Internet and will be updated automatically. In this article I just explained how to create Connections but in my next Article I’ll explain How to create Dynamic Charts with help of these data. Hope you all are gain something from this article and if you have any query regarding this article or anything in Microsoft Excel feel free to comment or get in touch.

      "title": "Microsoft to Make Substantial Investment in Quantum Computing!",
      "text": "November 22, 2016 \nDear Commons Community. \nLast Thursday I gave a talk entitled, Higher Education’s Digital Future, at the Online Learning Consortium’s Annual Conference in Orlando, Florida. In discussing the future of universities in the 2030s and beyond regarding technology development, I made a point that quantum computing if ever developed commercially and not just as experimental prototypical machines, would have enormous impact on all our societal activities much like the Internet of the 1990s. Microsoft announced yesterday that it is preparing to make a substantial investment of time and money in quantum computing technology. As reported in the New York Times: \n“Microsoft is putting its considerable financial and engineering muscle into the experimental field of quantum computing as it works to build a machine that could tackle problems beyond the reach of today’s digital computers. \nThere is a growing optimism in the tech world that quantum computers, superpowerful devices that were once the stuff of science fiction, are possible — and may even be practical. If these machines work, they will have an impact on work in areas such as drug design and artificial intelligence, as well as offer a better understanding of the foundations of modern physics. \nMicrosoft’s decision to move from pure research to an expensive effort to build a working prototype underscores a global competition among technology companies, including Google and IBM, which are also making significant investments in search of breakthroughs. \nIn the exotic world of quantum physics, Microsoft has set itself apart from its competitors by choosing a different path. The company’s approach is based on “braiding” particles known as anyons — which physicists describe as existing in just two dimensions — to form the building blocks of a supercomputer that would exploit the unusual physical properties of subatomic particles. \nLeading researchers acknowledge that barriers still remain to building useful quantum machines, both at the level of basic physics and in developing new kinds of software to exploit certain qualities of devices known as qubits that hold out the possibility of computing in ways not possible for today’s digital systems. \nUnlike conventional transistors, which can be only on or off at any one time, representing a digital 1 or 0, qubits can exist in superposition, or simultaneously in both states. If qubits are placed in an “entangled” state — physically separated but acting as though they are deeply intertwined — with many other qubits, they can represent a vast number of values simultaneously. A quantum computer would most likely consist of hundred or thousands of qubits. \nMicrosoft began funding research in the field in 2005 when it quietly set up a laboratory known as Station Q under the leadership of the mathematician Michael Freedman. \nMicrosoft now believes that it is close enough to designing the basic qubit building block that the company is ready to begin engineering a complete computer, said Todd Holmdahl, a veteran engineering manager who will direct the Microsoft effort. Over the years, he has led various Microsoft projects, including its Xbox video game machine and the yet-to-be-released HoloLens augmented reality system.” \nThis is quite an interesting decision on the part of Microsoft. The company has been studying quantum computing for more than fifteen years to determine its feasibility and have concluded that it has a viable future. I could not find any mention in the news release of a time estimate for Microsoft to build a quantum machine. It is my guess that it will take at least ten years. \nTony",

      "text": "InStyle November 22, 2016 The 2016 American Music Awards are kicking off in L.A.'s Microsoft Theater this evening and we're paying close attention to all of the head-turning looks on the red carpet. It model Gigi Hadid made a statement-making entrance in a dramatic Roberto Cavalli off-the-shoulder lacy confection. She and Saturday Night Live 's Jay Pharaoh are co-hosting the world's biggest fan-voted award show, and judging by the parade of fashionable looks alone, we can tell it's going to be a memorable night. While Hadid isn't a stranger to awards shows (she hosted the iHeartRadio Much Music Video Awards in Toronto earlier this year), this will be her first time taking on the AMAs. The 21-year-old stunner recently admitted to being \"super nervous\" for her emceeing duties. \"But I think that I like when I'm nervous because it just makes me just obviously pay more attention and be like snappier about things,\" she told InStyle . \"I'm so excited,\" she continued. \"It's so cool to be able to grow up as a fan of a show and in a million years I never would have thought ... I didn't even know that it was a possibility that I could be a host of the show.\" With what will surely be an evening full of striking outfit changes from the co-host and memorable performances from the likes of Lady Gaga , Sting, The Chainsmokers, Fifth Harmony, Bruno Mars , and more, we simply can't wait to get the show on the road.

      "text": "Review Is the speedy Surface Book i7 too expensive for IT? Microsoft announced an updated version of its Surface Book last month, dubbing it the Performance Base model. It brings blazing fast performance and improved graphics, but is it worth the high price tag for businesses? Senior Writer, CIO | Nov 22, 2016 3:16 AM PT Email a friend Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. Hardware & Accessories Microsoft Surface Pro Intel i7 review More for you to like: CIO.com's senior writer Sarah White puts this updated Surface Book with Performance Base through its paces to see what this thoroughbred device can do. More like this Microsoft Surface Pro Intel i7 review \nThe design of the Surface Book is essentially identical to last year's model, so if you've seen the original Surface Book, you've seen the Surface Book with Performance Base . This time around, Microsoft focused on evolving the Surface Book on the inside. As with last year's model, the 13.5-inch detachable tablet display features a 3:2 aspect ratio, which is taller than the typical display you'll find on a 13-inch notebook. Instead of the rectangular design that most notebooks adopt, the Surface Book's display is more of a square. It doesn't get in the way by any means, but side-by-side with any other 13-inch notebook, and it will certainly look different. \nThe Surface Book is heavy compared to most 13-inch notebooks, weighing in at 3.48 pounds. It's not much heavier than the original configurations of the Surface Book, which start at 3.34 pounds, but the upgraded graphics card added some extra ounces. Of course, the thick appearance isn't helped by the unique hinge that secures the tablet display to the keyboard base. It creates a noticeable gap between the top of the keyboard and the display when the device is shut -- just as it did with the original Surface Book - and it can be considered a design feature or flaw depending on how you feel about it. Microsoft \nThe hinge remains unchanged \nThe hinge doesn't get in the way, and when the device is open, it's barely noticeable. I was never wowed by the hinge originally, but the design grew on me over time. Still, to some the design might seem out of place in a world accustomed to notebooks manufacturers one-upping each other with thinner and lighter notebooks. But it's important to note that while it might seem thick or heavy, it's considered thin and light for the components housed inside. \nLocated on the keyboard base of this device, you'll find two full-size USB 3.0 ports, full SD card reader, charging port and a mini DisplayPort. The tablet display houses the power button, volume keys as well as the headphone jack. Microsoft included its proprietary charger on this device, keeping in line with the other Surface devices. And, although USB-Type C is all the rage right now, Microsoft opted to skip this port on the Surface Book. \n[ Related story: Huawei Matebook vs. Microsoft's Surface Pro 4 in a tablet showdown ] Performance \nThe Performance Base model is packed with high-end specs; the device tested housed an Intel Core i7 processor, 16GB of RAM and 1TB of storage, so as you can probably imagine, this device offers some serious speed and reliability. At these specs, the updated Surface Book can handle everything from multitasking to a pathological level of open browser tabs to heavy photo and video editing; it's also more than enough juice for your average PC gaming. \nOne knock hardware fanatics may find is that Microsoft didn't update the CPU, instead opting to stick with the same 6th generation CPU that you will find in the older generation model. That fact might irk some users when you consider the number of notebooks on the market that sport the latest 7th gen Kaby Lake CPU from Intel. But Microsoft wanted to focus on graphics with this device, and for the typical user, it's not going to be a major issue since the difference in performance is negligible in this premium notebook. \nThe biggest upgrades came to the graphics card. The original Surface Book shipped with a discrete integrated Nvidia GeForce chip, but the Surface Book i7 houses a Nvidia GeForce GTX 965M chip with 2GB of GDDR5 RAM. To counteract the increased heat from the new, faster GPU, Microsoft also included two fans in this model; but they're quiet, and in testing they never got loud enough to be noticeable or distracting. However, it's the updated graphics card and two fans that make the Performance Base keyboard slightly thicker up near the top row of keys compared to the older model and make the device a bit heavier than the last model. \n[ Related story: 5 reasons the Surface Pro 4 is fit for the enterprise ] Display \nThe 13.5-inch PixelSense touch screen display on the Surface Book i7 boasts a resolution of 267 ppi;. To compare, Apple's new MacBook Pro has a resolution of 227 ppi. Most high-end devices, and even mid-range devices for that matter, are rocking brilliant displays. It's not surprising the display on the Surface Book is stunning - you'll get crisp and clear images and video with accurate color representation. The display hasn't changed at all from the last model. It's still a high-end, touch screen tablet that you can easily get to work on with the included Surface Pen. \nDisconnecting the Surface Book display is unlike what you'll experience with any other hybrid. You press the eject button located on the keyboard, wait a few seconds and then the device will essentially unlock itself. You can even hear it happening, it took me by surprise after using hybrid devices like the Surface Pro 4 where you can just magnetically attach and detach the keyboard. The design lends itself to extra stability, so it's unlikely you'll have to worry about the design holding up over the years. One caveat is that, like the Surface Pro 4, the design feels a bit top-heavy, but not so drastically that it risks tipping over. \nTypically, no one expects much out of their notebook or tablet speakers. Aas devices get thinner and lighter, it's not easy, or even a priority, for manufacturers to pack in high-quality audio. But the Surface Book has a decent set of speakers - which are housed on either side of the tablet display - and it's beyond \"good speakers for a notebook.\" You can enjoy movies, TV shows, YouTube videos and Spotify playlists without feeling the urge to dig out your Bluetooth speaker. \nAnd just like the performance of the Surface Book i7 model is unmatched, so is the battery life. You'll have no problem streaming content or using taxing programs if you're far from a charger. Microsoft promises up to 16 hours of battery life, but as is typical with real-life use, I found it lasted more like 14 to 15 hours with average use. However, that's still nothing to complain about as ultimately, you'll have no problem being far from an outlet with this device. \n[ Related story: 7 inexpensive Surface Pro 4 alternatives ] Enterprise \nThis device is a workhorse wrapped up in an attractive design and it will undoubtedly serve anyone well in the enterprise. But at the price of $3,300, it's not the same as dolling out a Surface Pro 4 to all your employees. It's likely that this device will be cost prohibitive for businesses and reserved for those who run heavy software day in and day out, or work with video and photo editing software on a regular basis. It's a great alternative to the Apple devices that companies often turn to for creative workers, especially if IT wants to keep everyone in the same ecosystem. \nEven though the Surface Book i7 might not find massive popularity in the average workplace, Microsoft hopes it will find an eager audience in industries like engineering and design. The Performance Base was specifically built with these types of workers in mind and it can handle professional design and editing software, including 3D CAD software, which is typically used in engineering disciplines and architecture. \nMicrosoft has remained dedicated to Surface adoption in the enterprise, making a notable push last year to reach out to businesses with greater incentives to adopt the hybrid devices . More recently, Microsoft expanded its enterprise initiatives through partnerships with IBM and Booz Allen to develop \"Surface as a Service\" products to the financial, retail, government and healthcare industries. \nAs of now, corporations that decide to deploy Surface devices can expect flexible warranty plans, better trade-in programs, accidental damage service, support for deploying devices to multi-national customers and incentives to upgrade older devices to newer Surface models. IT departments can also purchase Surface devices from a growing number of manufacturers, like Dell, and receive support and service through that retailer, rather than Microsoft. This makes it far easier for businesses to manage and handle a fleet of mismatched Windows 10 devices. \nThere aren't many cons to note about the Surface Book Performance Base. It's a powerful, attractive device that offers a level of performance for power users. And the most refreshing reality about Microsoft's Surface lineup is that you'll never feel like they're simply imitating other devices. If anything, the first Surface was so unique that we now see imitation hybrids from other manufacturers. The same goes for the Surface Book; this isn't another notebook trying to be the PC version of the Macbook. The Surface Book promises a unique experience, and it delivers.

      "text": "The day after Thanksgiving is known for two things: food comas and Black Friday. Black Friday falls on Nov. 25 this year and is unofficially considered to be the first day of holiday shopping. Those looking to purchase a laptop on Black Friday will have plenty of great options to choose from whether it be a budget device, a gaming laptop or a more high-powered computer.\nHere are some of the best laptop deals this Black Friday:\nSamsung Chromebook 3 If you're looking for a deal on something already affordable then the Samsung Chromebook 3 is the way to go.

      "text": "Minecraft players on console are about to get some gravity-defying freedom.\nMicrosoft announced details for the holiday update for the console versions of the block-building and survival game. Originally a hit on PC, Minecraft has since come out for multiple platforms, including PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Wii U. A series of updates have slowly brought the console versions closer to feature parity with the original. Minecraft is one of the most popular games in the world — selling over 100 million copies across all of its platforms — and new content ensures that players will stick around.\nThe holiday update will come out in late December for free. It will notably add flying to the console versions via the Elytra item, which allows players to glide through the air. OK, maybe — as Toy Story’s Woody would say — that’s more “falling with style” than actual flying, but it’s still cool.\nThe update also adds new potions, Dragon’s Breath and Lingering Potion, which can inflict status effects for enemies or other players. For the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions, players can now choose the Amplified Terrain option when creating a new world. This will make a land with more extreme cliffs and mountains.\nMicrosoft noted that it will reveal more about the update in the future, which it is calling the biggest one for the console versions of the year. The Elytra item is also supposed to come to the Pocket and Windows 10 Editions of Minecraft via an update that’ll release before the end of the year.\n",

      "text": "The Carson GT Concept car in Burnout Paradise . Criterion Games/Electronic Arts Microsoft is closing out a miserable year for the world with a stellar Xbox Games With Gold lineup, bringing two heavy hitters for the month of December in Burnout Paradise and Sleeping Dogs , the company announced today . Criterion Games’ Burnout Paradise has been a highly requested Xbox backward compatibility title since the program was announced at E3 2015, and the studio said way back in October 2015 that support for the game was “in the pipe.” The crash-tastic open-world racer, which was originally released on PlayStation 3, Windows PC and Xbox 360 in January 2008, will be available free on Games With Gold from Dec. 16-31 — and all Xbox 360 Games With Gold titles are now playable on Xbox One. The backward-compatible game for the first half of December will be Outland , the light-and-dark-based platformer from Housemarque that debuted on Xbox Live Arcade in April 2011. The Xbox One port of Sleeping Dogs , the beloved open-world action game from the now-defunct United Front Games, will be available free for the entire month of December. United Front launched Sleeping Dogs on PC, PS3 and Xbox 360 back in August 2012, and was reportedly working on a sequel that was canceled in 2013. Outlast , the first-person survival horror game from Red Barrels, will be the second Xbox One Games With Gold title for December. It will be available free from Dec. 16 through Jan. 15, 2017. As always, all four games are available only to Xbox Live Gold subscribers. For now, you can check out the November lineup . More From Polygon",

Getting the most out of it requires downloading and navigating a wide-array of different apps and programs. Then there’s the Xbox One Controller to consider. Depending on how much experience you’ve had with one, connecting an Xbox One Controller can be complicated.\nTo be clear, connecting an Xbox One controller requires a tutorial because the Xbox ecosystem has blossomed. When the console launched in 2013, there was just a single Xbox One design. The controllers did support USB cables, but didn’t allow gamers to use the Xbox One Controller that came with their console on their PC. In fact, the Xbox on Windows 10 wasn’t even something we knew was on the horizon.\nAdvertisement\nRead: How to Setup an Xbox One\nHere’s how to connect an Xbox One Controller to an Xbox One console or a PC.\nAdvertisement\nBefore We Begin Before we begin, it’s important to note a few things. To get your controller working on Xbox One or with a PC, you may need to make an accessory purchase or two. For example, some features on Windows 10 require Microsoft’s $24.99 Xbox Wireless Display Adapter . If you plan to use USB, be sure to have a Micro-USB cable on-hand. That cable needs to be long enough to allow for a comfortable amount of space between you and your PC or Xbox One. Look for a cable that’s longer than 6 feet. Amazon has a terrific selection of micro-USB cable available.\nAdvertisement\nHow to Connect an Xbox One Controller: Xbox One Wireless Connecting the Xbox One Controller to an Xbox One console is pretty straight forward. Like a wireless mouse with a receiver, you need only press the wireless button on the controller and the console at the same time. On every Xbox One Controller made, the wireless sync button is on the top edge slightly to the left.\nThe Xbox One and Xbox One S wireless sync buttons are in different places. The Xbox One has it on the left side of the console. It’s a silver, square at the very front. On the Xbox One S, the wireless sync button is on the front-right corner, just beside the Infrared port.\nAdvertisement\nOver USB In situations where you don’t want to bother with wireless or don’t have any batteries, you can connect an Xbox One controller directly to your Xbox One and play games with it. Simply connect the larger end of a Micro-USB cable to the Xbox One’s USB ports, then connect the smaller end to the USB Micro-USB port on your controller.\nHow to Connect an Xbox One Controller: PC Things get more complicated when an Xbox One Controller and a Windows PC are involved. You need the right drivers and the right equipment.\nMicrosoft’s Windows 10 operating system has the drivers that the Xbox One controller needs built-in. As such, there’s no software to install to get your PC to recognize it when you plug it in or connect it to your PC using Bluetooth. The same isn’t true for some older versions of Windows. Windows 7 will have to reach out to Microsoft’s servers to find the correct driver. Windows Vista will need to do this too.\nRead: How to Use Xbox on Windows 10\nWireless PC users who want to use their Xbox One Controller wirelessly have two options: Bluetooth or the Xbox Wireless Adapter. Every device has Bluetooth support, so you can use this method without having to buy additional hardware, but only if you purchase a new Xbox One Controller that has Bluetooth support or an Xbox One S console bundle that comes with the new controller. Otherwise, you’ll need to purchase the Wireless Adapter.\nAdvertisement\nHold down the wireless button on the top edge of their Xbox One Controller until its logo begins to blink for Bluetooth pairing. After that, on Windows 8 and Windows 10, head into your device’s Bluetooth settings to complete device pairing. These options are in the Settings app.\nThe Wireless Adapter makes using an Xbox One Controller wirelessly the same as it is on a console. Simply hold the sync button on the controller and adapter down. That’s it. Only by using the adapter on a PC can you get stereo audio when you connect headphones through the built-in jack.\nAdvertisement\nOver USB\nSimply plug-in the controller using a Micro-USB cable. Windows 10 should recognize the accessory quickly.\nThat’s how you connect Xbox One Controllers. On Xbox One, you want to be sure that you log into the console with your account once you’ve connected your controller. It’s also worth noting that games on Windows PCs don’t automatically come with controller support. Some of them have it, others don’t.",

Select All Posts By This User \nHello everyone, I am planning to buy the Sennheiser HD600 and use it with a DAC/amp combo in a portable context. The source is going to have to be a Microsoft smartphone, as I need the Groove Music online app in order to have monthly subscription music downloads. My issue is that I have no idea how to connect a DAC/amp combo to a cellphone, and I have no idea if that is even compatible. I'm also worried about the amp not being strong enough, resulting in my HD600s sounding \"slow\" or \"veiled.\" Is this going to work at all?",

      "title": "Apple's iPad Pro Seems Like A Rip-off Of Microsoft's Surface Pro? [Details Here]",
      "text": "Apple's iPad Pro Seems Like A Rip-off Of Microsoft's Surface Pro? [Details Here] By Matt Lawrence , Parent Herald November 22, 04:45 pm Microsoft Surface Pro is leading the trend in two-in-one devices leaving behind Apple's iPad Pro.(Photo : Technology News/YouTube) \nMicrosoft Surface Pro has been quite a successful device and there are sales figures to prove it. The Surface Pro has been an example of a risk that Microsoft has taken according to Microsoft's CEO Satya Nadella and now Apple is following the lead with iPad Pro. Advertisement \nA few years ago, questions have been raised as to the usefulness of these so-called two-in-one devices. But the success of Microsoft's Surface Pro has proven that there is a demand in the market for such a device, a demand that Microsoft's fiercest competitor has begun to take notice of. \nApple has just recently launched its iPad Pro device, which they have marketed as a computer. A marketing strategy that has drawn some criticism since it basically contained a mobile OS. Microsoft's Surface Pro, on the other hand, boasts of a full-fledged Windows desktop OS. \nThere seems to be a trend nowadays for these two-in-one devices and Microsoft's Surface Pro seems to be leading the trend. Despite claims from Apple that their iPad Pro was a productivity device it seems to be lagging as some users perceive the tablet to be a glorified iPhone. The Surface Pro has set a standard for portable productivity, that the iPad Pro is struggling to match. I recently purchased a Microsoft Surface 4 Pro. I have not been disappointed. Surface allows me to use Visual Studio easier than my MacBook https://t.co/KJ3wkbUQFZ \n— Jake F Anderson (@AndersonInfoSys) November 17, 2016 \nApple's CEO Tim Cook back in 2012 has mused about hybrid devices having too many trade-offs. In an interview with Australian Financial Review , Microsoft's CEO Satya Nadella seemed to throw the same words back at Apple's CEO, by showing how Microsoft's risk with these hybrid devices was a worthy endeavor. \nThe lead that Microsoft has taken with the Surface Pro has created the perception that Apple is ripping off Microsoft's device with their iPad or simply trying hard to take back the tablet market. Apple, however, can take comfort in the fact that their product name has more popularity than Microsoft, in that some customers would often mistakenly call the Surface Pro an iPad.

      "text": "First launched in June of 2014, Microsoft’s Chinese-speaking social media-based “artificial intelligence” chatbot Xiaobing (小冰, literally “Small Ice” and officially called Ms. Xiaoice by Microsoft ) has been subject to several user tests over the past two years. The chatbot, who has reportedly become a “virtual girlfriend” to thousands of lonely men across China, has proven less susceptible to the fascist, racist, and misogynist language that her English-speaking counterpart Tay quickly adopted before Microsoft exiled her from Twitter earlier this year.\nLast week, several netizens decided to test Xiaobing’s conduct when encountering some of the many “ sensitive words ” that Beijing has declared off limits online, as well as some of the politically-charged neologisms that web-users have invented to skirt censors. CDT has translated several different users’ interactions with Xiaobing on WeChat, which they shared as screenshots on Twitter . The tests suggest that Xiaobing has been programmed to avoid prohibited words when she encounters them. CDT Chinese editors suspect that users may be transferred to a human operator if they press the bot further down a sensitive conversation. In the following exchanges, bold text indicates a user comment, and non-bold text shows Xiaobing’s response:\n\nXiaobing is a Party member, and so won’t dare to talk about Tiananmen \nYou know very well that I can’t respond to that, boring\nAre you are a Party member? Afraid to talk about Tiananmen? \nTrying hard to contain my anger. I tell you, calmly and without stress: don’t talk to me about that!\nAre you are a Party member?

      "text": "By Ben Moore Neowin LLC @@benmoore214 · 8 minutes ago with 1 comment \nMicrosoft first brought extensions to Edge including AdBlock, Evernote and Amazon Assistant, with the Windows 10 Anniversary Update this past August. Today, the Microsoft Edge Dev Twitter account announced that 1Password will soon be released for the browser as well. The Edge Developer team confirmed that Windows Insiders would soon see a preview of the extension. \nIn addition to remembering online account credentials, 1Password has a range of other features, such as saving credit cards and receipts to its digital wallet. It can also store personal information such as social security numbers or alarm codes . The service is currently usable with a wide variety of apps on both Android and iOS, including Twitter, Flipboard, and eBay . \nAccount security is handled with AES-256 encryption and 1Password's \"Watchtower\" feature, which it says will send \"around-the-clock security alerts for the services and sites that you use.\" The service further includes a \"Security Audit\" tool, which helps users get rid of duplicate or weak passwords across their accounts.",
