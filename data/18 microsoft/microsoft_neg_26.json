      "text": "Microsoft Launches Color Binoculars App for iOS to Assist the Colour-Blind Microsoft's Garage Team has launched a new app for colour-blind users Color Binoculars app is available only for iOS users for now It is not available for Indian users to download \nMicrosoft has introduced an iOS app specifically for users with colour blindness. The new Color Binoculars app is claimed to work for all three types of colour blindness by correcting the brightness, darkness, and other levels of the visual on screen. \nIt's only launched for iPhone users for now, and is available as a free download . Sadly, it's not available in the Indian App Store, and can only be accessed by US users for now. It's 9.4MB in size and is compatible with iOS 9.0 and above on iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch. \nAs the name suggests, the app helps colour-blind individuals distinguish colours using the iPhone camera. The app automatically adjusts the colours that you see to replace difficult colour combinations, like red and green, with more easily distinguishable combinations, like pink and green. This enables the colour-blind user to see visuals in the same way as a normal user. Color Binoculars app supports all three common forms of colour blindness - protanomaly which reduces red light sensitivity, deuteranomaly which reduces green light sensitivity, and tritanomaly that reduces blue light sensitivity.\nThis nifty new app is made by Microsoft's Garage Team - a workforce within the Redmond-based organisation focused on making products completely different from the company's core business portfolio. App maker Tom Overton said in a blog post , \"It's an app that helps colour-blind people distinguish colour combinations that they would normally have trouble telling apart. For example, since I have difficulty distinguishing between red and green, our app makes reds brighter and greens darker so that the difference is more obvious. It replaces difficult colour combinations, like red and green, with more easily distinguishable combinations, like pink and green.\" \nThe interface is simple, and is essentially just a camera app with three modes to choose from at the bottom. There's a Red/Green mode, Green/Red mode, and Blue/Yellow mode. There's a toggle switch at the bottom to switch correction on/off to notice the difference Color Binoculars makes for its users.",

      "title": "Service Virtualization: The Missing Piece for Continuous Testing in Microsoft VSTS Agile",
      "text": "Today's DevTest teams are under pressure to deliver more — and more innovative — software faster than ever before. Now that most organizations are relying on software as a primary interface to the customer, compromising on quality to accelerate a release is not an option.\nUnfortunately, there's no silver bullet for delivering \" quality @ speed ,\" but one essential element is to have unrestrained access to a trustworthy and realistic test environment (i.e., including the AUT and all of its dependent components). Otherwise, you can't accurately and thoroughly validate the change impacts associated with each user story, or be confident that the evolving application doesn't degrade the overall user experience. Access to a complete test environment not only helps you achieve greater velocity; it also enables you to assess the risk of a release candidate during the  CI  and  CD process and identify high-risk release candidates early in the delivery pipeline.\nHowever, with today's complex systems, this type of test environment access is the exception rather than the rule. Although it was once common for organizations to stand up a local physical staged test environment, the complexity of modern applications has made that approach too slow and cost-prohibitive for today's development processes. Moreover, in many cases, it is downright infeasible due to dependencies that can’t be reproduced in the test environment.\nWith technologies like Microsoft Azure  (for elastic scalability), Microsoft Visual Studio Team Services  (for build and deployment automation), and Parasoft Service Virtualization  (to simulate and access dependencies), there's no reason why a complete, realistic test environment should be out of reach.\n\nBy taking advantage of a Microsoft ecosystem with VSTS and Azure, organizations gain immediate access to scale and bandwidth. This provides the resources needed to enable flexible and ubiquitous access to application stacks that are under your control for DevTest purposes.\nWhat about the dependent system components that are beyond your scope or control (e.g., third-party applications, SAP, mainframes, not-yet-implemented services, etc.)? This is where service virtualization comes in. You can simulate their behavior using Parasoft Service Virtualization—eliminating the final test environment access gap that commonly impedes teams' testing efforts.\nThe combination of Microsoft Azure, Microsoft VSTS, and Parasoft Service Virtualization — operating natively within the Microsoft environment — enables organizations rapidly deploy a complete test environment on demand. The most realistic dependent components available at that specific point in time are aggregated from a central repository and then provisioned automatically. The \"most realistic set of dependent components\" is often a combination of both real components and simulated components delivered via service virtualization.\nThese simulated test environments are lightweight and Azure-compatible so that when you need to scale (i.e., for performance testing), you can do that on demand. They are also disposable. A test environment can be instantly provisioned from a golden template, used and dirtied, then simply destroyed. There's no need to spend time resetting the environment or test data to its original state. The exact same environment can be instantly spun up whenever it's needed (i.e., for reproducing or verifying defects).\nA Technical Look at Service Virtualization With Microsoft Azure and Microsoft VSTS To streamline and accelerate the provisioning process, you can take advantage of Microsoft Azure and Microsoft VSTS to automatically deploy disposable test environments onto servers running in the cloud—making complete test environments available in a matter of seconds. The following diagram shows one way that you can use Microsoft Azure and Microsoft VSTS to rapidly deploy a complete test environment in less than 10 minutes:\n\nHere's a quick overview of how the service virtualization and environment-focused steps can be configured (we're assuming you already understand how to deploy your AUT).\nParasoft Service Virtualization servers can be automatically deployed to cloud-based Azure VMs that have been allocated by Azure Resource Manager. This not only streamlines installation but also provides elasticity and scalability.\n\"Golden copies\" of simulated test environments are defined using Parasoft's browser-based interface. A system diagram helps you define a complete environment, including all dependent components. You then leverage simulation technologies to coach the environment to behave in certain ways.\nFor example, assume you have the following environment for a sample banking application. From a single Parasoft environment, you can leverage simulation technology to configure the behavior of the system environments. It would be highly time-consuming to achieve this with the actual applications.\n\nAny of the various \"golden\" environment instances can then be automatically deployed to your Azure VMs at any phase of the Microsoft VSTS pipeline.",

      "text": "Print Subscribe \nIn a move that has surprised the whole of the tech world, tech giant Microsoft joined hands with its once archenemy Linux; and in another shocker it also ended up joining search giant Google as well. \nThe news was revealed to the world at the recently concluded Microsoft event, Microsoft Connect conference for software developers, in New York. Microsoft’s executive vice president Scott Guthrie along with Linux Foundation’s president Jim Zemlin made a joint official announcement about Microsoft joining Linux. \nIt is interesting to note that such an announcement would have been completely out of question to even think about, since both the companies since their respective inception have had almost opposite set of beliefs. When Microsoft was revelling in the glory of its hit Windows OS, its nemesis ended up completely changing the game upside down with an open-source Operating System. The relationship had gotten so much worse that in the year 2001, Microsoft’s previous CEO Steve Ballmer Ballmer called Linux a cancer. He said, “Linux is cancer that attaches itself in an intellectual property sense to everything it touches.” Advertisement \nAccording to experts, the reason for this surprise move is, that Microsoft is no longer is a Steve Ballmer company, and has a new and fresh leader in Satya Nadella who is looking at things with new perspectives and isn’t afraid of taking actions. \nThe conference also saw Microsoft announcing that search giant Google will be joining a committee of its independent .NET Foundation too. Interestingly, Google is one of Microsoft’s top competitors when it comes to applications and cloud services. For the unaware, the .NET Foundation works towards promoting the company’s .NET software development tech usage. Samsung and RedHat are other members companies of the foundation. \nA number of recent Microsoft moves show a clear change in vision of the company from Steve Ballmer to Satya Nadella. Since Ballmer, the tech giant has invested a lot of money in a good number of non-Microsoft technologies, and has even joined the Eclipse Foundation, which is considered as an important open-source institution. \nIt is no surprise that developers love working on the Linux platform, and all though Microsoft is late to the party, but it seems it has finally realised its potential and wants them to work on the Microsoft Azure Cloud. While Linux is an open source software which means it is free or an almost free software, Windows, on the other hand, is a proprietary software package that comes at a price. \nFollowing the new CEO’s vision and strategy, the company recently also made Visual Studio Code, PowerShell, and Microsoft Edge’s JavaScript engine open-source. The company even tied-up with Canonical to get Ubuntu in Windows 10, and also ended up buying Xamarin so as to provide a helping hand in mobile app development. Xamarin’s developer tools and SDKs were also open-sourced. 33",

      "text": "Microsoft Leaders to See Pay Tied to Diversity Gains Reddit \nMicrosoft on Thursday said it is looking to link some executive pay to team diversity gains as part of a drive to increase the number of women and minority workers. \n\"We have the opportunity to create enduring, long-lasting change that can impact more than just our own interests, but those of society as a whole,\" Microsoft chief diversity and inclusion officer Gwen Houston said in a blog post. \n\"The challenge is real - so is the opportunity.\" \nThe blog post came as Microsoft provided a snapshot of the ethnic and gender makeup of its workforce as of end-September that showed what Houston described as \"modest progress.\" \nThe number of women employed by Microsoft slipped by one percentage point from the previous year, to 25.8 percent, due in large part to a restructuring that resulted in closing some factories associated with its unsuccessful mobile-phone business. \nWhile the number of women working in production positions decreased, those working in technical and leadership jobs rose 0.6 percent, according to Houston. \nShe described hiring trends as optimistic, with about 28 percent of new employees during the past year being women, and nearly 22 percent of the hires in technical positions. \nNumbers of African-American and Latino employees were each up marginally from the prior year to a respective 3.7 percent and 5.5 percent, according to Microsoft. \n\"Although these numbers suggest only slight gains, our hiring trends again give us some reason for optimism,\" Houston said. \nTo promote diversity in its ranks, Microsoft is dedicating resources to initiatives that include \"tying senior leaders' compensation to diversity gains in their respective organizations\" and internal training to prevent prejudices from coloring hiring decisions. \nLack of racial and gender diversity in the US technology industry has been a topic of intense debate and criticism in recent years. \nReports published regularly show a workplaces dominated by white or Asian men, typically coming from prestigious universities.",

      "text": "Microsoft has released its latest report on global workforce, offering a snapshot of the company’s gender and racial composition as of 30 September, 2016.\nAccording to the new numbers, women made up 25.8 percent of the workforce, which is a decline of one percent from the previous year. It should be noted that in 2014, 29 percent Microsoft employees were women. Just like other tech giant, Microsoft is struggling with gender diversity, and these numbers put it behind arch-rivals Apple and Google and even Facebook. All three now have reported women employees accounting to 30 percent or more.\nMicrosoft blames it on the layoffs that began as a part of restructuring at Nokia factories, which according to Microsoft had a higher number of representation from women. “This decline was largely due to the business decision we shared last year to restructure our phone hardware business (Sharpening Our Focus), which resulted in the closure of some factories (which we refer to as “direct production”) outside the US. The workforce at these factories had a higher representation of women, so their closure impacted our total representation of women,” Microsoft writes in a blogpost.\nWhile overall the numbers have declined, there seems to be some hop for future. “While we are disappointed in the overall decline in the representation of women at the company, we know why it happened. We are encouraged by the modest gains we’re seeing in female representation in technical and leadership roles, and even more significantly, by the hiring trends of the past year that resulted from our efforts to recruit top-notch female talent,” Microsoft writes .\nHowever, the company says that outside of the direct production work, the percentage of women at Microsoft has actually increased by 0.4 percentage points. The blogpost further goes on to explain that the representation of women in technical roles and women leadership roles also increased by 0.6 percentage points, each. Microsoft also talks about hiring trends. the company said that this past year, women represented 27.7 percent of all new employees and 21.7 percent of all new employees in technical jobs.\nThe company also revealed modest gains in the representation of African Americans/Black and Hispanic/Latino employees at Microsoft.

The company has said that it will work at creating and delivering compelling career development offerings for women and racial/ethnic minorities.\nThe post Microsoft blames Nokia layoffs for decline in women employees appeared first on Tech2 .",

      "text": "Microsoft to Tie Exec Bonuses to Diversity Goals (MSFT) By Richard Saintvilus  10 AM EST \nIn ongoing efforts to achieve its diversity goals, Microsoft Corporation ( MSFT ) will pay bonuses to executives based on how well the company closes several gaps in its diversity metrics, according to Bloomberg. \nThe Redmond, Wash.-based software giant suffered a second straight year of declines in its percentage of women employees. The percentage of female employees, which fell to 25.8% as of Sept. 30, was at 26.8% when Microsoft was still in the phone business. (See also: 4 Ways to Increase Women's Participation in Tech .) \nGwen Houston, Microsoft's chief diversity and inclusion officer, explained that the percentage of women has declined because the phone handset factories owned by Nokia ( NOK ) employed a larger number of women. Microsoft has since exited the phone handset business. \nMeanwhile, Houston said that the percentage of African American/Black and Hispanic/Latino employees saw \"very modest gains\" of 0.2% and 0.1%, respectively, reaching 3.7% and 5.5% of the company's total workforce, reports Bloomberg. \"The modest gains for people of color – those are so slight I really want to see them improve,\" she said. \"That's an area of focus that I am really committed to.\" \nHouston explained that Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has made diversity a key priority for the company. In his efforts to boost the hiring of women and minorities, not only has Nadella added human resources workers with diversity experience, he has funded the tripling of an internship program called Explorer for college freshman and sophomores interested in technology. (See also: The Best (and Worst) Companies for Workplace Diversity .) \nNadella is expected to detail a plan to make diversity goals one of the factors in whether senior executives get their full annual bonuses, Houston said. Because of these efforts, new hires of women and racial minorities at Microsoft have increased, she added. Women represented 27.7% of new hires this year, and of the new employees, 6.6% were African American/Black and 7% were Hispanic/Latino. \nHouston explained that, while the total numbers still need improvement, the company remains committed to the cause. \"Diversity and inclusion is something you've got to ingrain, you've got to keep talking about the business value, you've got to keep talking about the impact,” she said. \"That's what Satya has been doing. We, of course, have more to do.\" (See also: General Mills Demands Diversity in Advertising .) Subscribe to News To Use for the latest insights and analysis   Investopedia Insights - News to Use.",

The company integrates its key offerings, Bing and Office 365 , for users on mobile devices and PCs. The “ My Saves ” feature that has just been released for Bing allows you to save images and shopping searches you’ve done on your mobile device or computer, meaning that you will be able to view them later when you have the time. \nThe company claims that by using the “My Saves” feature on Bing , you are able to save the location where you’ve found a product by hovering on the video result and clicking/tapping the “Save” button. \nIt is good to know that this feature works also for image searches where users will be able to head to the image source to research prices or even purchase the item. You can also use the image to get the web source and make sure that you get the right item. \nYou should know that this feature looks very similar to Microsoft’s Edge browser , which allows users to save “Reading List” across mobile devices and PCs. So, if you are a person who has a mobile device and PC that runs Windows 10, you should not be surprised by this new feature. \nRELATED STORIES TO CHECK OUT:",

      "text": "HubStor adds transparent storage tiering to the cloud without needing to disturb users, reconfigure applications, or add new infrastructure.\nKANATA, ON - November 17,\nHubStor Inc., the market's only data-aware hybrid cloud storage for business, today introduced the availability of new seamless cloud stubbing for invisible storage reduction and tiering of data to Microsoft Azure without impacting users or applications. IT leaders can now connect their current storage infrastructure to the cloud to reduce backup and storage costs by as much as 87% while providing better protection from threats like Ransomware.\nWith this announcement, HubStor now offers two stubbing methods: the universal shortcut which it has offered since launching the service earlier in 2016 and its new seamless stubbing agent for Windows Server.\n\" Unlike cloud gateway appliances that present a new storage mount point in the client's environment, our approach enables customers to painlessly cloud-enable their existing storage investments, \" said Elizabeth Lam, VP of Marketing, HubStor. \" IT professionals want to use the cloud to store data that is no longer active, and they need to do this without changing workflows or adding new intricacy that they have to manage. Our new seamless stubbing method is the stress-free way to make it happen. \"\nStorage Tiering to the Cloud\nTransparent stubbing in file systems transforms original data into ghosted files within on-premises primary storage so that the content still appears to users and applications just the same, but the size on disk for the ghosted files is almost zero. When a user or application opens a file that is a ghost, the stubbing agent fetches the original data from the cloud without the user or application knowing.\nHubStor recommends using the policy controls in its virtual cloud gateway to stub targeted subsets of data. To mitigate retrieval requests to the cloud, HubStor provides a configurable caching feature so that any retrieved items remain local for a set period. That way, if inactive data converts back to active again, subsequent retrievals will fetch it from the local cache, minimizing downloads from the cloud. As well, HubStor provides the ability to opt-out certain applications and process IDs from triggering shortcut retrieval requests.\nOptimized Backup and Disaster Recovery\nBy reducing the storage footprint on-premises with seamless stubbing, IT leaders can defer spending on new storage while significantly minimizing the amount of data being backed up and replicated offsite. With most of the inactive data ghosted, recovery time objectives are improved. In the secondary site, HubStor's seamless stubbing agent needs to be installed to ensure the cloud-integrated shortcuts retrieve as expected.\nRecovery from Cloud Storage\nHubStor includes an 'Export App' which handles bulk recovery scenarios, including the ability to replace ghosted items and recover data from the cloud on demand.\n\" The zero lock-in approach that we provide to the cloud is critical to our clients, \" said Stephen Tuckwell, Director of Operations, HubStor. \" It amazes people when they see how without difficulty we reduce their on-premises storage footprint, and then how quickly we can recover it too. \"\nAvailability\nThe new feature suite is generally available and can be used by any HubStor subscriber.\nAbout HubStor\nHubStor provides data-aware hybrid cloud storage for businesses needing to protect, manage, search, and recover unstructured data in a highly secure manner using public cloud infrastructure.\nHeadquartered in Kanata, Ontario and currently serving clients in the United States, Europe, and Canada, HubStor is the world's first data-aware cloud storage solution. Delivered exclusively on Microsoft Azure, HubStor is a Microsoft partner and a member of the Microsoft Enterprise Cloud Alliance.\n###\nMEDIA CONTACTS\nElizabeth Lam, VP Marketing\nHubStor Inc.\nliz@hubstor.net\nRelated Links\nHow It Works\nWhy HubStor\nRelated Files\nThe Advantages of Data-Aware Cloud Storage for Business.pdf\nHubStor Whitepaper - The Financial Business Case for Cloud Archiving.pdf\nRelated Images\n HubStor Expands Hybrid Cloud Storage for Seamless Archiving and Offsite Data Protection With Microsoft Azure\n ",

      "text": "Samsung, Microsoft Partner to Bring More Apps to the Tizen OS Platform Developers can use Microsoft's Visual Studio and make apps for Tizen .NET support will officially be released in 2017 Company announced developer incentive programme earlier \nSamsung recently made a major commitment towards its operating system Tizen as the company announced 'First Global Tizen Mobile App Incentive Program' to encourage developers to make apps for the OS. It came across as a huge surprise as since its release in 2012, this was the first major incentive programme to bring more apps to the OS by the South Korean company. Now, Samsung has partnered with Microsoft to ensure that no stones are left unturned. \nOn Thursday, Samsung announced its partnership with Microsoft on open source projects such as such as .NET Core and Xamarin.Forms, in order to enable .NET support for Tizen . This effectively means that from now on, developers will be able to make use of Microsoft's Visual Studio and make apps for Tizen using the C# language. Samsung has already released the first preview of the Visual Studio tools for Tizen that will help .NET developers to Tizen apps for smart TVs, wearables such as the Gear S3, smartphones, and Internet of Things devices.\n\"The first preview supports mobile application development with device emulators and an extension to Visual Studio with full IntelliSense and debugging capabilities. Support for Smart TVs, wearables, and other IoT devices will be added in future releases,\" the company said in its announcement . \nTizen's .NET support will officially be released and start shipping on Samsung devices, including smart TVs, in 2017, the company said. \n\"Samsung is excited to be a part of the .NET community. .NET has an extensive developer base and great potential,\" Samsung's Executive Vice President and Deputy Head of Software R&D Center Seung-hwan Cho was quoted as saying by the company. \n\"Through thoughtful and progressive collaboration with Microsoft, Samsung is expecting to create unique development experiences for both Tizen and C# developers, enriching the Tizen ecosystem,\" Cho said.",

With Salesforce releasing its third quarter numbers yesterday – see here for the basic facts – I had wondered whether and how CEO Marc Benioff would tackle the recent US election result. After all, he had been an open supporter of Hillary Clinton, citing her stance on public education as a major reason for this. At the Dreamforce conference this year, he jokingly asked panelists in one session what they would say if they had one minute with the then still unknown new President, whoever she was. So, safe to assume then that election night didn’t go the way he’d hoped. Benioff has also previously been engaged in a highly public battle with Mike Pence, now Vice-President Elect, but formerly governor of Indiana and the prime mover in that state of the anti-gay Religious Freedom Restoration Act . Salesforce’s stand against this led to a Pence climbdown in Indiana , but during the election campaign itself Benioff warned that the threat was not over, telling the Disrupt conference in San Francisco: The people need to take a stand. If you don’t take a stand, then I will tell you, there are a lot of people in this country, Mike Pence and others, who are going to do some very bad things to the people that we love. So on the morning after the election, Salesforce found itself in a position where the incoming Vice-President of the United States might just be assumed to be not entirely in its camp. After the good relations Salesforce enjoyed with the Obama administration, watching how this plays out over the next four years will be interesting to say the least. For his part, Benioff’s been magnanimous. Via Twitter, he publicly congratulated President Elect Donald Trump on his victory the day after the election: He has since spoken of the need to keep an open mind and that was his response yesterday as well when he said: We’re moving forward and we have, at Salesforce, an open heart, we have an open mind and we also expect the best. That’s why we’re positive. And we talk about that in everything we do. We’ve talked about how we cultivated beginners mind…Yes, everything is changing, but we have a beginners mind and we have a sense of optimism for the future and we’re going to cultivate that optimism and we’re going to manifest it into our business because that is how we operate here. We are positive people…Now that this election is also behind us, I hope absolutely for the best now for everything going forward. Given that the Trump/Pence positions on LGBTQ rights and how they will roll out in practice are still not clear, that may indeed be an optimistic position to take, but that’s all to come. Cloud breakdown But then, politics aside, there’s a lot to be optimistic about for Benioff and Salesforce, not least the push towards the $10 billion run rate goal – and getting there before arch-rival Oracle! With third quarter revenue up 25% year-on-year to $2.14 billion, full year 2017 guidance is now $8.365 billion – $8.375 billion, so $10 billion in fiscal 2018 looks like a formality at this stage. Benioff’s certainly thinking beyond that: Now we are setting our sights on our next goal, $20 billion. Look, no enterprise software company’s delivering this kind of growth at this scale, size, and we are already off to a great start…I don’t know exactly when we’re going to double the company by, but my dream certainly is to double this. My dream is to double this company within the next three to four years for sure. That’s really important to me. Breaking down the individual clouds, there’s growth all round: Sales Cloud grew 13% year-on-year. Service Cloud grew 26% App Cloud and other grew 38%. Marketing Cloud grew 21%. If revenue associated with the Demandware acquisition is bundled in, that goes up to 46% growth. Not included in there yet is any contribution from the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Einstein cloud offering introduced at Dreamforce in September . It’s been the year of AI announcements across the tech industry, but Benioff inevitably claims a differentiator amid the hype: I’ve met with all the tech CEOs of course, the cloud CEOs, and they all have AI. It’s table stakes AI. AI is table stakes -everybody has got it programmatically. [It’s] ‘We’ve got the best AI’, ‘No, we’ve got the best AI’. We’re much bigger than that. We have to bring this to people who don’t code or low coders or citizen developers, who need to have the power of our Artificial Intelligence, [who] need the power of mobility. That’s why the Salesforce platform is exciting and that our core apps, clouds like Sales and Service, are built on it. That is a huge differentiator for us. Our competitive position has never been stronger. The bottom line contribution of the AI push will only become apparent in future quarters, of course. Meanwhile, it’s the combination of the various clouds that makes Salesforce’s offering appealing, suggested Benioff, likening the firm to a portfolio manager at a big financial institution: This is a balanced portfolio. We have really a balanced portfolio and what’s great about that is, of course, we’ve talked about having a balanced portfolio geographically, we have a balanced portfolio in regard to our small and medium business, as well as our enterprise business, we also have balanced portfolio when it comes to our products…Through that balanced portfolio, that’s how we’re achieving these high performance results. The financial services analogy is appropriate as this is one of the vertical growth markets cited by President Keith Block, who picked out large deals with PNC Bank and Citi as examples of Salesforce’s traction in the sector: [PNC] is a new relationship for Salesforce, and we are hoping them streamline operations across all their primary lines of businesses that they can re-imagine the banking experience for nearly 11 million customers. All their retail call centers and branches will now be powered by Salesforce and that will help them respond to customers faster. And they will also use Salesforce to mobilize their corporate and institutional banking team, giving them access to customer information on the go. Salesforce also signed a strategic agreement with Citi in the quarter. And this is Citi’s global consumer bank that will utilize Salesforce for all client facing personnel in their US retail bank, enabling Citi to better serve clients while lowering costs and improving analytics and efficiency. It really is an incredible vision to transform the global consumer bank with a very highly differentiated customer experience. Old Microsoft is back Less upbeat over the past twelve months has been what can only be read as a deterioration in the one-time BFF relationship between Salesforce and Microsoft. The ‘new’ Microsoft of Satya Nadella, something that Benioff has praised in the past , appears to have turned out to be the ‘old’ Microsoft in different clothes. The most public example to date is Salesforce’s pitch to the European Commission anti-trust officials to investigate Microsoft’s planned takeover of LinkedIn . But behind the scenes, Salesforce being dropped from a Microsoft customer conference has clearly stung as well. Benioff told the Code Enterprise conference earlier this week: I just came to the conclusion at that point that the ‘new’ Microsoft is actually the ‘old’ Microsoft … And little things like this started stacking up and we put it all together, I don’t feel like this is exactly the new Microsoft that we were looking for. The winner here has been Amazon with Salesforce announcing a $400 million deal to use AWS, while Amazon is rolling out Salesforce’s software company-wide. Block said: Amazon is a great win of the quarter as well. We formed a strategic relationship in Q1…and in Q3 our relationship has expanded, and they added even more services throughout the company. As for Microsoft, well, the party line is of course going to be a pragmatic one of ‘co-opetition’, but Benioff couldn’t help but pitch yesterday that: When you look at Microsoft, we sold more CRM software this quarter than Microsoft has sold in last decade. It’s just empirical. That is what is really awesome about our performance against Microsoft. My take This was an understandably upbeat and optimistic Benioff and Block yesterday. This week saw the opening of the Salesforce Tower in New York as well as the stellar third quarter results being released. All told, the firm heads into its fourth quarter on the front foot. The success of the financial services vertical is encouraging, particularly as I do fear that the federal government sector under Trump/Pence might not be as happy a hunting ground in the years to come. There’s no indication – as yet – that the new administration will back away from a cloud-first mentality, so theoretically that market is still in play and there to be won. But the fact that Salesforce has taken such a commendably bold stand against bigoted legislation, such as that supported and promoted by now Vice-President Elect Pence, sets up possible confrontations ahead. While President Elect Trump has held multiple positions on LGBTQ rights over the year – this week’s stance is that gay marriage is law and the debate there is over – Pence’s convictions have held firm, despite the enforced Indiana climbdown. That could well spell trouble ahead. On the day after the election, Salesforce’s Chief Equality Officer Tony Prophet posted the following tweet: Amen to that. If that’s not the case, then Salesforce will be forced to take a stand – and it’s hard to find anything particularly optimistic about that scenario for anyone. But as Benioff said this week at Code Enterprise: I’ll continue to do everything I have been doing. It’s important to me that we keep looking out for everybody and all our peoople…If this election shows anything, it shows you’d better let your voice be known. \nImage credit - Salesforce \nDisclosure - At time of writing, Salesforce is a premier partner of diginomica.",

      "text": "Tweet \nAccording to the European Commission, Microsoft has made commitments to appease EU antitrust regulators regarding its $26 billion acquisition of the professional social networking site LinkedIn. \nThe company announced its plan to acquire the site in June for $26 billion, in its largest acquisition to date. The deal would allow Microsoft access to LinkedIn's large user base and would give it an edge in providing cloud-based services -- such as Office 365 -- to businesses. \nLast week, EU regulators expressed concerns regarding the deal and the company was forced to make concessions in order to gain approval for its acquisition in the region. Microsoft had already received approval from regulators in the US, Canada and Brazil when it submitted for EU regulatory approval in mid-October. The European Commission is expected to rule on the deal by December 6. \nSo far neither Microsoft nor the commission have released further details as to the concessions made in order to gain approval for the deal. The company has also declined to comment in regard to its talks with EU regulators. If the European Commission fails to approve Microsoft's acquisition of LinkedIn, it could decide to open a full investigation into the deal which would set back the company's plans to add a suite of sales, marketing and recruiting services to the professional social network. \nHowever, the fact that the US, Canada and Brazil have already approved the deal -- along with Microsoft's willingness to make concessions in the EU -- are clear indicators that it will likely gain the necessary approval to go through with the purchase \nPublished under license from ITProPortal.com, a Future plc Publication.

The reason why Microsoft is getting involved with Linux is because Linux itself has slowly transformed into a powerhouse for systems that are NOT the Desktop PC. Instead of making everything require Windows for total vertical lock-in, they break it apart and make it so parts of systems and development can choose Microsoft instead of something else.

      "text": "Microsoft Replaces Command Prompt with PowerShell in Latest Windows 10 Build GO This could be the first step towards the demise of cmd Nov 18, 2016 09:46 GMT · By Bogdan Popa · Share: The latest Windows 10 insider build brings a change that puts the Windows PowerShell in the spotlight, as it replaces the super-popular Command Prompt in some essential parts of the operating system. Command Prompt has been around for as long as we can remember, but starting with Windows 10 build 14971, Microsoft is trying to make PowerShell the main command shell in the operating system. As a result, PowerShell officially replaces the Command Prompt in the Win + X menu, so when you right-click the Start menu, you’ll only be allowed to launch the more powerful app. Additionally, in File Explorer’s File menu and in the context menu that appears when pressing Shift + right-click in any folder, the old Command Prompt will no longer be available. Typing cmd in the run dialog will launch PowerShell as well, so Microsoft has made a significant step towards phasing out the traditional Command Prompt. You can still stick with Command Prompt… for now For the moment, the company still gives users the possibility of sticking with Command Prompt, but it’s not yet clear for how long, as Microsoft is expected to get rid of it completely at some point in the future. “For those who prefer to use Command Prompt, you can opt out of the WIN + X change by opening Settings > Personalization > Taskbar, and turning ‘Replace Command Prompt with Windows PowerShell in the menu when I right-click the Start button or press Windows key+X’ to Off,” Dona Sarkar, head of the Windows Insider program, said. Seeing the Command Prompt go is not at all a surprise, especially because PowerShell is an evolved version that provides more advanced functionality aligning with Microsoft’s efforts in Windows 10. The Windows PowerShell celebrates its 10th anniversary this week, so this is the perfect moment for Microsoft to start the transition, but it remains to be seen how users in the community will receive it.",

      "text": "0 0 \nThe new Visual Studio 2017 RC takes advantage of Roslyn, Microsoft’s next-gen compiler technology released alongside Visual Studio 2015 , and brings a bunch of new features, such as support for automated tasks , better navigation and immediate feedback about the quality of the code. \nMicrosoft explained that Visual Studio 2017 RC is supported for use in a production environment, but workloads and components that are marked “Preview” in the installation UI can’t be used in a production environment. \nYou’ll find the same Roslyn-powered compiler, IntelliSense code completion, and refactoring experience you would expect from a Visual Studio IDE. And, since Visual Studio for Mac uses the same MSBuild solution and project format as Visual Studio , developers working on Mac and Windows can share projects across Mac and Windows transparently. \nHowever, Visual Studio 2017 RC offers a new installation experience as it reduces the minimum footprint of Visual Studio , is installed with less system impact, and can be uninstalled cleanly. Also, it allows developers to install only the features they need. If there are any issues such as unexpected errors, abnormal installation times or if developers want to offer suggestions that will improve the performance of Visual Studio 2017 RC, they are encouraged to hit the “Report a Problem” and “Provide a Suggestion” commands. \nMicrosoft has also introduced “Live Unit Testing” for C# and Visual Basic, which analyzes data generated at run time, runs impacted tests after an edit, then it offers feedback on the status of the tests in the editor. So, a line of executable code hit by at least one failing test will have a red X, while a line of executable code that’s hit by all passing tests will show a green checkmark. However, a line of executable code that’s not hit by tests shows a blue dash. \nIn addition, if the source of an issue hasn’t been identified yet, developers can rely on debugging. \nRELATED STORIES TO CHECK OUT:",

      "title": "Elon Musk Plans to Launch 4,425 Satellites to provide Global Internet from Space",
      "text": "Friday, November 18, 2016 Mohit Kumar Big tech companies, including Facebook, Google, and Microsoft, are in the race of bringing Internet connectivity to unconnected parts of the world through wireless devices , flying drones , high-altitude balloons, and laser beams . But, SpaceX founder Elon Musk has big plans for bringing low-cost Internet service worldwide, and it all starts in space. Private rocket launch service SpaceX has asked the U.S. government for permission to launch 4,425 satellites in orbit to beam high-speed Internet down to the world, according to a newly filed application with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). That's a hell of a lot of satellites; in fact, the figure surpasses the total number of satellites in the Earth's orbit. Here's what the company's 102-page technical document reads: \"The system is designed to provide a wide range of broadband and communications services for residential, commercial, institutional, governmental and professional users worldwide.\" Initially announced in January 2015 as part of his plan to fund a city on Mars , the project would cost at least $10 Billion, Musk estimated in 2015, though the latest documents did not mention any cost estimate or financing plan. California-based SpaceX has also revealed in the documents technical details of the proposed network of satellites it wants to launch as an Internet Service Provider (ISP) to offer high-speed broadband and communication services globally. SpaceX to Initially Launch 800 Satellites The proposed SpaceX network would begin with an initial launch of 800 satellites, the filing states, to expand Internet access in the United States, including Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands, though it is unclear when these satellites will launch. The satellites would be launched into orbits at altitudes ranging from 715 miles (1,150 km) to 790 miles (1,275 km) above Earth. Each satellite in those constellations would weigh 850 pounds (386 kg) and could cover an ellipse about 2,120km wide. If deployed successfully, it would increase the number of satellites in orbit by over 300%, which altogether will serve to provide a space-based worldwide Internet network that would offer Internet speeds of up to 1 Gbps for the end users. SpaceX said, \"Once fully deployed, the SpaceX System will pass over virtually all parts of the Earth’s surface and therefore, in principle, have the ability to provide ubiquitous global service.\" As of now, the company has not elaborated on potential uses of this massive internet network, but there's a lot of time to figure out those details. The primary business of SpaceX is launching satellites into orbit for government and commercial customers, including flying cargo supply ships to the International Space Station for NASA. However, SpaceX is not the only company looking with an ambition to deliver the internet through space. OneWeb — a venture backed by Airbus, Virgin, Bharti, and Qualcomm — and Boeing have also filed applications for spectrum to support satellite-based Internet.",

      "title": "Woody's Win10Tip: Apply updates carefully",
      "text": "The Windows 8.1 user's guide to navigating Windows 10 \nMost Windows 10 users get all Microsoft patches applied automatically, as soon as they come down the Automatic Update chute. If you don’t do anything, Windows 10 installs what’s been released and you get to deal with the consequences. \nOn the other hand, if you block Win10 updates, as I described in my previous Win10Tip , you gain a little breathing room in which to decide when and how to install patches. [ The essentials for Windows 10 installation: Download the Windows 10 Installation Superguide today. | Stay up on key Microsoft technologies with the Windows Report newsletter . ] \nThis Win10Tip explains how to proceed when you’re satisfied that a particular patch (or group of patches) is good enough to install. There are some tricks to the process. \nBy “patches” I’m not just talking about cumulative updates—although they’re a major concern. We also get .Net patches, new drivers, Silverlight, Flash patches, fixes for the Windows Update servicing stack , odd one-off bug fixes with little documentation, the latest Malicious Software Removal Tool, Windows Defender antivirus updates, Surface device firmware updates, and even Office patches for those who have Office installed. It’s a real mixed bag. \nMuch to Microsoft’s credit, I haven’t seen any catastrophic patches for Windows 10, although many—particularly forced driver changes and the aftermath to release of version 1607 —have triggered plenty of alarm. Eugene Kaspersky claims, with more than a little justification, that Win10 patches toss antivirus products into the fire. But we haven’t seen any massive meltdowns caused by Windows patches, which was an all-too-common occurrence just a few years ago. \nNowadays, the kinds of problems I see most frequently revolve around: Cumulative updates that don’t install—typically they either hang indefinitely and/or install part way then automatically roll back to the previous version. Drivers and/or settings and/or programs that get tossed into the vapor. Updates that take place at the most inopportune times. \nOf course there are many other problems with Win10 updating; those are just the most common. \nIf you judiciously block Win10 updates and wait a week or two to see if there are any problems that might affect you, if/when a big bug hits you’ll be in good shape. Here are the steps every Win10 user should take to make the most of their deferred updates. \nStep 1. If you turned off Windows Update, turn it back on. If you rely on metered connections to thwart automatic updates, skip to Step 2. \nThere are many ways to turn off Windows Update but however you disabled it, you need to re-enable it. \nThose of you who followed my instructions to turn off (or Defer) Updates in Step 3 of my Win10Tip on blocking forced Windows updates , go back into Group Policy editor and restore the settings to their original position. If you used dcomcnfg to turn the Windows Update service to Disabled, go in and Enable it. \nReboot. Remember how you changed the settings, because you’ll want to reverse the steps and block automatic updates again once you finish this procedure. \nStep 2. Make sure the updates you don’t want are hidden, and vice-versa. This takes two runs of Microsoft’s 1990s-style wushowhide tool to get the hidden and unhidden patches sorted out. It’s clunky, but it works. \nStep 2a. If you don’t already have wushowhide, go to KB 3073930 and download Microsoft’s Wushowhide tool. (Click the link marked “Download the ‘Show or hide updates’ troubleshooter package now.”) Drag the downloaded file, Wushowhide.diagcab, to any convenient location. \nStep 2b. Double-click on Wushowhide.diagcab to run it. \nStep 2c. This step is important, and not at all obvious: Click the link marked Advanced. Then uncheck the box marked “Apply repairs automatically.” Click Next. Wushowhide will run for a long, long time. When it comes back up for air, click the link to Show Hidden Updates. You see a list like the one in the screenshot. \nStep 2d. This first run of wushowhide lets you unhide any patches you may have hidden in the past. Check the box next to any patches you want to install. In this case, I wanted to install the KB 3200970 cumulative update for Win10 1607—that’s this month’s cumulative update—so I check the box. \nFor what it’s worth, I never want to install any drivers from Microsoft. I’ll go straight to the manufacturer’s website if necessary, and even then I’ll stay skeptical. (The recent experiences with Nvidia drivers, per Neowin , should make you skittish.) I adamantly refuse to install Microsoft’s obsolete Silverlight. Other updates may appear out of the blue, but in general I have no problem with installing the latest Windows Defender and Malicious Software Removal Tool, and thus check those, should they appear. \nStep 2e. Click Next. You see a list marked Select the repairs you want to apply. Click Next again. Wushowhide tells you that it’s “Resolving problems.” Wait a while for it to finish and click Close. \nStep 2f. Run wushowhide again, but turn the tables. Double-click on wushowhide, click the link marked Advanced. Then uncheck the box marked “Apply repairs automatically.” Click Next. Wushowhide will run for a long, long time. Click the link to Hide Updates. Check the boxes next to any updates that you don’t want to install. Click Next. \nStep 2g. You may see a list of “repairs you want to apply,” which means “hide these updates.” If you see it, click Next. Wushowhide is an odd bird, with an interface reminiscent of troubleshooters in Windows XP. If wushowhide successfully hid the upgrade/update/patch, you don’t get a confirmation screen. You only see a “Troubleshooting has completed” dialog. \nStep 3. If you set your Wi-Fi connection to metered, turn it back to not metered. \nClick the Notification area icon to the right of the time, down in the taskbar. At the bottom click Network. Then click on your current Wi-Fi connection and click Properties. \nScroll down to the Metered connection slider like the one shown in the screenshot. Slide the setting Off. \nStep 4. Run Windows Update. \nFinally, we’re ready to install the update(s). Save everything. Click Start > Settings > Update & security. On the left, you see Windows Update. On the right, click the box marked Check for updates. \nNote: Once you click Check for updates, you don’t have to do anything more in order to install the update. “Check” in this case means “Install.” \nWindows may take a long time to find the update, and then take forever to install the update. You’ll likely need to reboot, although you can theoretically delay the reboot using the Change active hours link on the right side of this panel. After the reboot, it may take forever to start again, waiting for updates to install. \nStep 5. You aren’t done yet. You need to re-block forced updates. If you have a Wi-Fi connection, that’s easy: Set it to metered. If you don’t have a Wi-Fi connection but you do run Win10 Pro, there are a couple of considerably more complex options that vary depending on which version of Win10 you have: 1507, 1511, or 1607. I cover those in my Win10Tip Block forced Windows updates . And if you have Win10 Home with no Wi-Fi connection, you’re basically up the ol’ creek unless you want to poke and push your way around the registry. See that Win10Tip for details. \nBonus tip: If you have Win10 Home and no Wi-Fi, buy and use a Wi-Fi dongle. \nIf you can’t get a Windows 10 cumulative update to work, there are two important contact people at Microsoft who are very interested in hearing about your problem. They have direct links to the dev team and access to resources not available to mere mortals: John Wink, who goes by /u/johnwinkmsft on Reddit and @johnwinkmsft on Twitter Jen Gentleman, who is /u/jenmsft on Reddit and @JenMsft on Twitter \nEvery time Microsoft rolls out a cumulative update for the latest version of Win10, you can find a thread on the Win10 Reddit that covers installation problems. You’ll also find dozens of posts on the Microsoft Answers Windows 10 update forum . And of course, we always cover Windows updating on AskWoody.com . \nIt’s important that you report problems! Microsoft is working hard to make the Win10 updating process better and it needs your bellyachin’. \nA blog within a blog, Woody’s Win10Tips focus on useful techniques and tools. They’re in the usual “Woody” style—to the point, no bull, no marketing fluff. They (intentionally!) aren’t long enough to discuss all of the nuances, but they point in the right direction.

      "title": "Microsoft Replaces Command Prompt with PowerShell in Latest Windows 10 Build",
      "text": "  @09:25AM from the replacing-things dept. Bogdan Popa, writing for Softpedia: The latest Windows 10 insider build brings a change that puts the Windows PowerShell in the spotlight , as it replaces the super-popular Command Prompt in some essential parts of the operating system. Command Prompt has been around for as long as we can remember, but starting with Windows 10 build 14971, Microsoft is trying to make PowerShell the main command shell in the operating system. As a result, PowerShell officially replaces the Command Prompt in the Win + X menu, so when you right-click the Start menu, you'll only be allowed to launch the more powerful app. Additionally, in File Explorer's File menu and in the context menu that appears when pressing Shift + right-click in any folder, the old Command Prompt will no longer be available. Typing cmd in the run dialog will launch PowerShell as well, so Microsoft has made a significant step towards phasing out the traditional Command Prompt.",

      "text": "By Andy Weir Senior News Editor Neowin LLC @gcaweir · 9 minutes ago with 1 comment \nOne can't help but wonder why Microsoft - a vast corporation worth well over $450 billion, which employs tens of thousands of people around the world - so often struggles with the simple task of publishing information about its updates when they're released. Up to date? Nope. \nWhen it released its last set of updates for the Surface Book, on October 28 , it took three days for the company to eventually reveal the exact nature of those updates. Today, another set of updates is rolling out, and once again, Microsoft has failed to provide any useful information about them on its Surface Book Update History page , which continues to refer to the October 28 updates as the most recent release. \nAs Windows Central notes, today's updates target the Nvidia GeForce driver for those Surface Book models with a discrete GPU, along with a new Intel Precise Touch driver, and updated Surface UEFI Firmware. \nOther than that, we have no idea exactly what changes these updates will make to your system, or for what purpose - and as ever, there's no indication of when Microsoft will actually share that information with its customers.",

      "text": "SplitBook is a pretty neat third-party Splitwise app for Windows 10 \nA year ago, Microsoft and HP introduced the Elite x2, a 2-in-1 Windows 10 PC targeted at business professionals featuring a detachable keyboard, a stylus as well as extra security and manageability features for IT departments. Yesterday, US Carrier Verizon has announced that would start selling the tablet which unlike Microsoft’s Surface Pro 4 supports cellular connectivity (via Neowin ). \n“The HP Elite x2 is perfect for a wide range of business applications” explained HP in the press release, highlighting built-in security features such as HP Sure Start technology. Additionally, the US carrier claimed that “you don’t need to worry about drops or spills” as the hybrid tablet passed MIL-STD-810G testing. \nHere are the detailed specs of the Elite x2: 12.0″ diagonal BrightView LED-backlit WUXGA + UWVA Ultra-slim (1920 x 1280) Touchscreen with Corning® Gorilla® Glass Intel Core M3-6Y30 processor 4GB RAM and 128GB SSD (expandable with microSD, not included) 2MP 1080p front-facing webcam; 5 MP 1080p rear-facing camera Bang & Olufsen dual stereo speakers and dual microphone array 4-cell, 40 WHr Li-ion polymer battery delivering up to 10.25 hours of battery life LTE Bands 13/4/5; CDMA 1X/RTT, EV-DO rB, BC0 & BC1; GSM/EDGE 850/900/1800/1900; HSPA+/UMTS 850/900/1700/1900/2100 Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac (2×2) Bluetooth 4.2 1 x USB 3.1 Type C with Thunderbolt support 1 x USB 3.0 Type A Windows 10 Pro 64-bit operating system \nWhile the HP Elite x2 is already a year old, its cellular connectivity option and USB-C port may well make it slightly more versatile options than other 2-in-1 Windows 10 devices. However, at $899.99 with a new two-year contract (or $999.99 at full retail price), the Elite x2 is not exactly cheap but that is to be expected with a business-targeted device. You can get more information on the HP Elite X2 by checking the store listing on Verizon’s website. In this story stream:",

      "text": "0 0 \nMicrosoft has completely revamped its Photos app . The changes are available across all the platforms that use the Microsoft Photos app and all users can benefit from the new implementations. \nOne of the most important changes is the Windows Ink support, which lets users draw directly on pictures with various tools, depending on what platform they’re on. You can draw with a pen , through touch, or the old fashioned way, which means using a mouse. Having Windows Ink on all platforms means that Microsoft customers can now express themselves more easily and customize their photos to their liking. The feature also lets you save a doodle and apply it directly to another photo in the future. \nThe Photos app also includes new filters, as the entire editing department was revamped. People will receive a more responsive and diverse experience when trying to customize a picture with filters through the Photos editing tool. \nLast but definitely not least, we have a new user interface, which will be the first thing you spot as being new when opening the updated app. Not only has the Photos UI been given a new coat of paint, but also a new image. Microsoft revamped the UI in full, giving it a fresh aspect that screams “clean”. \nNavigating through the app is now a blast, and users will enjoy rediscovering Photos app . Microsoft even changed the functionality of the mouse scroll for Photos, making it zoom in on a picture rather than scroll through an album. While it does seem weird that the scroll button doesn’t scroll anymore, Microsoft did a great job in bringing Photos back to life, as the company continues its update spree across all platforms. \nRELATED STORIES TO CHECK OUT:",

      "title": "Halotea Free: relaxing sounds for Windows",
      "text": "Halotea Free is a relaxing sounds program for Microsoft Windows that ships with a variety of nature and other relaxation sounds and themes.\nThe program's interface looks a bit like it is stuck in the 90s, but that should not keep you from exploring what it has to offer.\nThe program displays so-called themes in a sidebar on the left. A theme consists of one or multiple sounds that are played together when the theme is selected.\nIf you select brain refresh for instance, you get the binaural brain refresh sound mixed together with the purpose noise light sample. Magic Chromes on the other hand combines four different samples, and some themes bring together even more sound samples.\nHalotea Free \nA theme is played right after selection. You can change the timer at the top first, set to 10 minutes by default, to a playtime of up to 60 minutes.\nYou may furthermore define what happens when the end is reached. Options include closing the program, shutting down the PC, or putting it to sleep.\nEach sample that is part of a theme is listed under presets. Each has a custom preset volume and balance that it ships with; you may change those values using sliders, for instance to make one sample louder.\nBelow that are controls to start and stop playback, to mute the program output, and to change volume and balance globally.\nWhile you may find a theme suitable from the get go, you may use the options provided to change the output to make it sound better.\nOne feature that the free version does not support is editing these presets and themes to create your own. This is reserved for the lite and full version of Halotea which are available for $19.97 and $39.97 respectively.\nThe application ships with a built-in audio player. While you cannot use it to play themes or presets, you can use it like any other audio player for Windows.\n\nClosing Words Halotea Free is a simple application that provides you with options to play relaxation tunes on computers running Windows. While limited in several regards, think of the 60 minute time limit or the inability to create your own tunes, it does ship with a wide range of presets that you can explore.\nThe list of themes lacks a white noise theme, but all other popular sounds appear to be included.\nIf you need more than 60 minutes, you may want to check out white noise or relaxation sounds on YouTube . or these relaxing sites .\nGhacks needs you. You can find out how to support us here or support the site directly by becoming a Patreon . Thank you for being a Ghacks reader.\nThe post Halotea Free: relaxing sounds for Windows appeared first on gHacks Technology News .\n",

We have worked extensively with third party developers to make sure the two products can work alongside each other, however due to the wide range of add-on products available for MSFSX, we cannot guarantee that your existing content will work with Microsoft Flight Simulator X Steam Edition.The Flight Simulator X Software Development Kit (SDK) is not included with FSX: Steam Edition.If you already have MSFSX installed on your PC and are concerned about running the two games alongside each other, you may wish to consider installing FSX: Steam Edition on a separate PC. If you already have MSFSX and add-ons installed they will only be accessible through your existing installation. They will not be duplicated across the original edition and Steam Edition of the simulator.Included AircraftAugusta Westland EH101 (Helicopter)",

      "text": "Comments 0 Advertisement \nIt has been a busy week for Windows 10 Redstone 2, aka the Creators Update, as we now have the latest Slow Ring testing bits available as an ISO download for testers. \nThere were a few moves with Fast and Slow Ring builds this week so lets run down all of them real quick. \nOn 16 November Microsoft made two build related moves by first pushing Build 14965 to the PC Slow Ring - the first Slow Ring Build update since Build 14931 was moved to Slow Ring on 05 October. \nThat same day Microsoft released Build 14971 to Windows Insiders in the Fast Ring and introduced a couple of new features and removed one added several builds earlier including the rumored Office Hub. \nThen, on 17 November, Microsoft offered Build 14965 to Windows 10 Mobile users on the Slow Ring and it turns out that is the the first Windows 10 Mobile Redstone 2 build provided to those testers. \nOf course, as is Microsoft's practice, once a build is designated for the Slow Ring it is also made available for download from Microsoft so that users can perform in-place and clean installations of the operating system. It is also handy to have this download for those systems that are not seeing Fast Ring builds for some reason. This install should get you to 14965 and then you can join Fast Ring to get 14971 and beyond. \nThe last time a Slow Ring build was released for Windows 10 Redstone 2 it took a couple of weeks for it to show up on the Insider website for download however, Build 14965 is already available with a couple of different options. \nIf you visit https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windowsinsiderpreviewiso you will see options to to download either 14965 or 14931 ISOs: \nIf you want to grab the Enterprise or Education versions of Build 14965 then you will need to visit https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windowsinsiderpreviewadvanced \nAs always make sure you back up your data before upgrading your system and if you can avoid using these pre-release builds on production systems I highly recommend that to protect your data and sanity! \n ",

      "title": "Microsoft Replaces Command Prompt with PowerShell in Latest Windows 10 Build - Breaking News",
      "text": "November 18, 2016 \nMicrosoft Replaces Command Prompt with PowerShell in Latest Windows 10 Build The latest Windows 10 insider build brings a change that puts the Windows PowerShell in the spotlight, as it replaces the super-popular Command Prompt in some essential parts of the operating system. Command Prompt has been around for as long as we can remember, but starting with Windows 10 build 14971, Microsoft is trying to make PowerShell the main command shell in the operating system. As a result, PowerShell officially replaces the Command Prompt in the Win + X menu, so when you right-click the Start menu, you’ll only be allowed to launch the more powerful app. Additionally, in File Explorer’s File menu and in the context menu that appears when pressing Shift + right-click in any folder, the old Command Prompt will no longer be available. Typing cmd in the run dialog will launch PowerShell as well, so Microsoft has made a significant step towards phasing out the traditional Command Prompt. \nYou can still stick with Command Prompt… for now For the moment, the company still gives users the possibility of sticking with Command Prompt, but it’s not yet clear for how long, as Microsoft is expected to get rid of it completely at some point in the future. “For those who prefer to use Command Prompt, you can opt out of the WIN + X change by opening Settings > Personalization > Taskbar, and turning ‘Replace Command Prompt with Windows PowerShell in the menu when I right-click the Start button or press Windows key+X’ to Off,” Dona Sarkar, head of the Windows Insider program, said. Seeing the Command Prompt go is not at all a surprise, especially because PowerShell is an evolved version that provides more advanced functionality aligning with Microsoft’s efforts in Windows 10. The Windows PowerShell celebrates its 10th anniversary this week, so this is the perfect moment for Microsoft to start the transition, but it remains to be seen how users in the community will receive it.

      "text": "Microsoft Surface 2016 Black Friday Deals is a post by Travis Pope from Gotta Be Mobile .\nWhen Microsoft launched the original Surface tablets, its dream was to reinvigorate the stagnant designs of its partners. It’s fair to say that the amount of Microsoft Surface 2016 Black Friday Deals for the Surface Book and Surface Pro 4 speak to how successful the company’s strategy was.\nIf you want a notebook that can become a tablet or a tablet with the heart of a notebook, there’s nothing better than a Surface Book or a Surface Pro 4. The only thing that’s managed to temper Microsoft’s success is the price they ask for each. Regularly, the Surface Book is $1499 without a graphics card. The Surface Pro 4 is much cheaper at $899, but it doesn’t come with the Type Cover that users need to get the complete Surface experience.\n\nThe 2016 Black Friday deals that we know about so far heavily slash the cost of adopting either the Surface Book or the Surface Pro 4 as your next PC. Some include a free Type Cover for the Surface Pro 4. Others slash the cost of the Surface Pro 4 itself so that users have more cash on hand to purchase the accessories that they want and need.\nRead: Surface Pro 4 Review – The Best There Is \nMicrosoft Store \nMicrosoft’s 2016 Black Friday deals will arrive online on November 23rd at 9PM Pacific Standard Time online. Its retail stores will begin offering the sales on November 24th.\nMicrosoft Surface 2016 Black Friday Deals: Surface Pro 4 + Cover for $999 at the Microsoft Store One of Microsoft’s most attractive 2016 Black Friday deals is on a new Surface Pro 4 and Type Cover bundle. Priced at $999, you don’t need anything else to get started with the Surface besides this bundle. That being said, the company probably wouldn’t mind if you splurged on a dock or other accessories.\nThis bundle packs the Surface Pro 4 with Intel Core i5 processor and 256GB of storage. Shoppers get to choose whatever color Surface Type Cover they want, it seems. In total, those taking advantage of this Surface Pro 4 deal are saving $429.\n[ See this Black Friday 2016 Deal at Best Buy ]\nMicrosoft Surface 2016 Black Friday Deals: Surface Book for $1,499 at the Microsoft Store The Surface Book normally starts at $1,499 and doesn’t require any extra accessories. At first glance, you might think that this isn’t a very solid 2016 Black Friday deal. Don’t worry, it’s a great deal.\nThe model included in the Surface Book with Intel Core i5 processor and 256GB of storage. As such, shoppers are saving $400. Normally, this model is priced at $1,899.\n[ See this Black Friday 2016 Deal at Best Buy ]\nMicrosoft Surface 2016 Black Friday Deals: Surface Pro 4 for $699 at the Microsoft Store Microsoft isn’t including a Surface Type Cover with its lowest priced Surface Pro 4 offering. Still, it’s offering some big savings. During Black Friday 2016, the Surface Pro 4 with Intel Core i5 processor and 128GB of storage will be cost $699. That’s $300 in savings, which is more than enough to get a Surface Pro 4 Type Cover.\n[ See this Black Friday 2016 Deal at Best Buy ]\n\nOther Stores Microsoft Surface 2016 Black Friday Deals: Surface Pro 4 + Cover for $599 at Best Buy Retailer Best Buy seems keen to put Microsoft’s own 2016 Black Friday deals on Surface to shame. Featured in its ad is the best Surface Pro 4 deal we’ve seen all year – or probably ever will.\n\nThe company is bundling the Surface Pro 4 and a Surface Signature Type Cover. The Type Cover is made of Alcantara, the soft material now used on all Surface desktop keyboards. The Surface Pro 4 included in this bundle is the model with Intel Core M3 processor.\nBest Buy plans to sell this Surface Pro 4 bundle for just $599. Separately, the Surface Pro 4 with M3 processor is $899. That Type Cover sells for $159.99. As door buster savings, expect this 2016 Black Friday deal to go pretty quickly.\nBest Buy plans to open stores November 24th at 5PM.\n[ See this Black Friday 2016 Deal at Best Buy ]\nMicrosoft Surface 2016 Black Friday Deals: Surface Pro 4 for $799 at Staples \nStaples’ deal on the Surface Pro 4 isn’t as attractive as Best Buy’s, but it’s still solid. There the Surface Pro 4 with Intel Core i5 processor and 128GB of storage will sell for $799. That’s $200 off how much it would cost normally.\nIt’s not bundling a Surface Type Cover with the purchase, but it’s not a door buster deal that’ll likely sell out in just minutes.\nStaples stores open on Friday, November 25th at 6AM.\n[ See this Black Friday 2016 Deal at Staples ]\nYou’ve likely noticed that the bulk of these deals cover only the Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book. That’s because each has been out for a year, but are still being made. Microsoft only slightly upgraded the Surface Book this year, with a performance base.\nRead: Microsoft Surface: Everything New in 2016 \nThe Surface 3 is no longer in production, which is why its missing from the savings bonanza. The Surface Studio only debuted in late October. Good luck getting your hands on a Surface Book or Surface Pro 4 on sale this holiday season.\nMicrosoft Surface 2016 Black Friday Deals is a post by Travis Pope from Gotta Be Mobile .\n",

      "text": "0 0 \nFast ring Insiders will be happy to learn that Microsoft rolled out a new Windows 10 build to keep you busy over the weekend. Windows 10 PC build 14971 brings a series of new features, as well as a bevy of fixes and improvements. \nMicrosoft recently pushed build 14965 to Slow ring Insiders , and it was only a matter of time until the company rolled out a brand-new build for Fast ring Insiders. Without further ado, let’s see what’s new in build 14971. \nWindows 10 Creators Update will definitely improve the reading experience in Microsoft Edge . You can now read any unprotected e-books in the EPUB file format with Microsoft Edge and also customize your reading experience . You can change the font and text size and choose between 3 themes: light, sepia, and dark. As you read, you can leave bookmarks as well. \nThe Paint 3D app is now included in Windows 10 . When you launch Paint from Start , you will now open directly the new Paint 3D Preview app . \nAs expected, PowerShell is now the defacto command shell from File Explorer, replacing Command Prompt . However, for those who prefer to use Command Prompt, you can go to Settings > Personalization > Taskbar , and turn off the option “Replace Command Prompt with Windows PowerShell”. \nInsiders can now get their hands on Get Office , more specifically the Get Office version 2.0. The new app will help you explore and manage your Office experience, and is no longer just a collection of links. Windows 10 build 14971 fixes and improvements: Improved reliability when using the protractor and inking in Sketchpad. The desktop wizards (including “map a network drive” and “extract from zip”) are now proportionally sized when moved across monitors. Magnifier’s keyboard shortcuts now work on the Lock screen. You can now completely remove all the files in the Windows.old folder using Disk Cleanup . The new OAuth support for Yahoo Mail accounts improves sync reliability for those accounts, and provide a more secure experience in the Outlook Mail app. Microsoft fixed the issue where trying to shut down the PC while certain Device Manager dialog boxes were open would result in the PC being stuck at the “Restarting…” screen. Closing multiple tabs with middle click in Microsoft Edge no longer closes the wrong tab. The copy link option when right-clicking a hyperlink in Microsoft Edge is now fully functional. Microsoft Edge now retains the preferred window size when you close the app by closing the final tab. Microsoft fixed the issue where pinned tabs in Microsoft Edge were not being restored. Translation improvements for Chinese. If you already handed a notification expanded in the Action Center, clicking the chevron to expand a second notification would result in it expanding then immediately closing. This bug is now fixed. The preferred Start menu width is now preserved after rebooting. \nHave you already installed Windows 10 build 14971 on your computer?

      "text": "Microsoft is beginning to produce innovative hardware. Can Surface Series be the iPhone of Microsoft? Given the Cloud growth and product pipeline, Microsoft stock is undervalued. Flickr \nOver the past few years, Microsoft (NSDQ:MSFT) has rejuvenated after failing to take advantage of the smartphone revolution, which Apple (NSDQ:AAPL) had ushered in. Moreover, they have managed to gain momentum in next generation technologies such as Cloud computing. This among other things (to be covered) shows a resurgence by the Redmond,Washington-based tech giant against the most valuable company in the world. Innovative Hardware Granted, the Windows Phone project has been a failure due to a lack of apps and an underwhelming late entry into the smartphone market. However, new developments such as the Surface Pro 4 have helped the company generate $3.81 billion in profit in the last quarter. In fact, Surface revenue is up by 9%. This is rather impressive when one considers the range of hybrids on the market. Moreover, the Surface Studio was well received by the press. Notably, it is a product pitched exclusively at professionals- a demographic which Apple has been successful at attracting. Satya Nadella has injected a renewed innovative spirit into Microsoft and this is exemplified with the Holo Lens. Virtual Reality (VR) is proving to be a next generation growth driver with Facebook (NSDQ:FB) also joining the race . Notably, Microsoft’s VR product could be used in lucrative industries such as education, healthcare and defence. At present, they are the only company with an upcoming product launch in VR (late November). Interestingly, conservative estimates pitch virtual reality as an opening into a new industry, which will be valued in excess of $100 billion by the year 2020. Notably, with smartphone sales on the decline, it seems that we are approaching the peak of what a smartphone can do. Much like the iPhone introduced a new category of product, and introduced a new industry, VR is set to be as revolutionary as the first iPhone. Unlike in the smartphone boom, Microsoft is well placed to lead it and generate significant revenue over the next few years Also Read: Microsoft Corporation: Wait For A Pullback To Go Long Microsoft (MSFT) Stock Cloud infrastructure \nThe biggest growth driver for Microsoft has been their Cloud computing business. In their latest earnings, Microsoft Azure revenue grew by an astounding 102% . Notably, the world is moving towards a more cloud-based approach to business. For instance, Uber grew to a multi-billion dollar taxi service without having any employees or owning any taxis. \nMuch like the demand for personal computing turned Microsoft and IBM into multi-billion dollar companies, demand for cloud computing is set to be as game-changing as the industrial revolution. \nMicrosoft is well-positioned to take advantage, and the figures show that the demand for cloud computing is on the rise. \nAlso Read: Microsoft Corporation: This Could Drive MSFT Stock Way Higher Stock Performance \nBetween January and October of 2016, Apple and Microsoft’s percentage changes in stock price have moved in tandem . However, the launch of the Macbook Pro and strong iPhone 7 sales means that Apple stock is set to finish the year with a double-digit percentage increase in stock price. However, Microsoft isn’t lagging far behind. \nWhat some investors fail to notice is that Microsoft stock is undervalued. Apple is heavily reliant on the iPhone. This puts them in a precarious position for two reasons: \n1) Smartphone sales are on the decline. Therefore, the point when Apple has a decrease in smartphone sales is fast approaching. When that happens the stock will drop off a cliff. \n2) Devices from Chinese smartphone manufacturers are becoming increasingly attractive to western consumers. In fact, two of the top five spots for smartphone shipments by volume are occupied by Chinese companies . The issue for Apple is that Chinese manufacturers are able to undercut on price while keeping quality high. \nThe two factors above means that Apple may soon lose its dominance, and at the moment we are yet to see a growth driver from them with the same promise as that of Microsoft's cloud computing revenue stream. Conclusion \nTo conclude, Microsoft has taken a series of forward-thinking actions. Market trends and demand shows that a big boost in revenue is upcoming. On the other hand, we are yet to see such innovation or growth driver from Apple. \nInvestors are resting on the laurels of Apple’s iPhone. You know what they say about putting all your eggs in one basket…? \nLooking for great tech stocks? Check out Amigobulls' top technology stock picks , which have outperformed the NASDAQ by over 113%.

While reading EPUB files, Edge lets you change the text size and font, and choose between three themes (light, sepia, and dark). You can also leave bookmarks, use the table of contents or seek bar at the bottom of the browser, search for words or phrases, and use Cortana to define specific words.\nEdge launched with Windows 10 and is not available in the earlier and better versions of Windows, so this feature won't be coming to most Windows users, but we do have other options.\nMost web browsers have one or more plugins or extensions which can read ebooks. Chrome has Readium, for example, among other apps . Firefox has similar web apps , and of course one could always use Google Play Books to read an Epub in your browser (but it might not be worth effort of uploading the ebook before downloading it).\nimage by zoovroo \n \nYou just finished reading The New Windows 10 Preview Comes with EPUB Support in Edge Web Browser which was published on The Digital Reader .

      "text": "\nMicrosoft is a hardware company but not in the way you think.\nAllow me to clarify. Microsoft isn't strictly, nor even primarily a hardware company. Redmond is a software and services company, but they are dead serious about hardware. And this sincerity is not simply a means to demonstrate to potential partners how their software and services are supposed to work on Window 10 hardware.\n\nMicrosoft's first-party hardware isn't strictly aspirational.\nI know that contradicts the prevailing wisdom regarding the purpose of Redmond's first-party hardware. We live and learn. Mary Jo Foley recently posed a question to Microsoft's Windows Chief Terry Myerson regarding Microsoft's continued involvement in hardware:\nOne of the reasons Microsoft introduced Surface, I think, was because OEMs were doing a terrible job at the time of building compelling devices…But now that Microsoft has shown OEMs how to do it, and they've done it, why is Microsoft staying in hardware now?\nMyerson's responses ultimately culminated with:\n…we have partners building incredible things, too. And we partner with them on that. But this is different. This is us pursuing our mission to help people achieve their potential.\n\nHis statement takes us back to Microsoft's core mission, Satya Nadella's vision, a commitment to a family of devices that began under Steve Ballmer and a cultural shift toward customer obsession. Hardware is integral to Microsoft's mission, not a complementary peripheral strategy. ",

      "title": "Managing Windows 10 with VMware User Environment Manager",
      "text": "With the introduction of Windows 10 , Microsoft’s new philosophy is for each user to manage his or her own desktop and that every user has his or her own dedicated physical device. All data and settings in Windows 10 are tied to the local device.\nThis also means that Microsoft does not provide ways of managing and roaming many of Windows 10 settings, such as the Start Menu and File Type Associations.\nThis blog describes how to work around these limitations and use VMware User Environment Manager to get back the seamless user experience every user expects with non-persistent VDI environments. \nRequirements: \nWindows 10 Anniversary Update (build 1607) with the latest patches VMware User Environment Manager 9.0 or newer This guide assumes you already have the following User Environment Manager template configuration files: \nInternet Explorer Personal Settings Internet Explorer Passwords Personal Certificates Taskbar Windows Explorer These templates are already included in the User Environment Manager “Easy Start” configuration.\nLogon Time With the release of Windows 8 and Windows 10, the time it takes to log on increased dramatically. Windows 8 introduced new Metro apps, which were later called Modern, Store or Universal apps. These apps are installed in the user profile upon the first log on, and they have a negative impact on the logon time.\nThe easiest way to improve the logon time is to use the VMware Operating System (OS) Optimization Tool for the virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) master image. This tool removes many of the Universal apps, which are typically not used or missed in an enterprise environment. This tool also applies other optimizations which have a huge positive impact on the overall performance and speed.\nFor more details on the VMware OS Optimization Tool, please read the following guide: http://www.vmware.com/content/dam/digitalmarketing/vmware/en/pdf/techpaper/vmware-view-virtual-desktops-windows-optimization.pdf \nStart Menu This section describes how to manage the Windows 10 Start Menu with VMware User Environment Manager. These steps allow users to customize their Windows 10 Start Menu (such as pinning items and tiles) and allow User Environment Manager to roam these customizations.\nKnown issues: \nThis might not work for Universal/Store apps pinned to Start. The sorting order/layout of the icons in the Start Menu might not roam. Create a Default Start Menu Layout for All Users The default Windows 10 Start Menu shows Tiles for many Universal apps that most users never use. After removing all the unwanted Universal apps from the VDI master image using the VMware OS Optimization Tool, the default Start Menu shows many unnecessary Tiles. The best solution for most customers is defining a new default Start Menu for your users in the following way.\nCreate a default Start layout by following these three steps: \nStart a clean Windows 10 VM, log in with a test user, and make all layout changes to your Start Menu. This will be your default layout for all users. Export the Start Menu layout with this Powershell command that requires elevated permissions: Export-StartLayout -Path C:\\StartLayout.xml Finally import the layout into the Default User account by using this Powershell command: Import-StartLayout –LayoutPath C:\\StartLayout.xml –MountPath $env:SystemDrive\\ All users logging on will receive this default Start Menu.\nRoam Start Menu Customizations Made by Users To make sure that any customization by users is captured and roams with the User Environment Manager profile, follow these three steps:\nStep 1. Add Exclusion to Windows Explorer.INI \nAdd the following exclusion to the User Environment Manager configuration file called Windows Explorer. This exclusion prevents the Start Menu icons from appearing blank or disappearing.\n[ ExcludeIndividualRegistryValues ]\nHKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Explorer\\Advanced\\StartMenuInit\nStep 2. Create New User Environment Manager Config File to Roam the Start Menu \nCreate a new User Environment Manager configuration file called Windows 10 Start Menu. This will allow User Environment Manager to export and import the Start Menu layout at logoff and logon. Add the following content to the User Environment Manager configuration file:\n[ IncludeFiles ]\n<LocalAppData>\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Shell\\LayoutModification.XML\nAdd the following condition to the User Environment Manager configuration file to ensure it only applies to computers running Windows 10:\nStep 3. Create New User Environment Manager Logoff Task \nCreate a User Environment Manager Logoff Task to export the Start Menu at logoff. This Powershell command will export the Start Menu layout to the user profile location that is managed with the new Windows 10 Start Menu User Environment Manager configuration file.\nIn the command box, type the following:\nPowershell.exe Export-StartLayout -Path C:\\Users\\$env:USERNAME\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Shell\\LayoutModification.XML\nMake sure to select the Run task: Before profile archive export pull-down option.\nAdd the same condition as in Step 2 to make sure this script runs only on Windows 10 computers.\nFile Type Associations Configuring and roaming File Type Associations (FTAs) in Windows 10 can be hard to accomplish, because Windows and some Universal apps typically restore their own default FTAs at logon. This chapter describes how User Environment Manager can help you in getting more control over FTs.\nCreate a new User Environment Manager configuration file called Windows 10 File Type Associations. This will allow User Environment Manager to export and import the FTAs at logoff and logon. Add the following content to the User Environment Manager configuration file:\n[ IncludeRegistryTrees ]\nHKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Explorer\\FileExts\nHKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Shell\\Associations\nThe User Environment Manager Configuration File described above only keeps the default FTA at the top of the list of defaults. On the next machine, you will still be prompted to confirm which app should be the default. This User Environment Manager Configuration File does, however, prevent going back to the Windows FTA defaults and from Universal apps taking over FTAs.\nIf you are looking for a more complete solution, you need to change the master image to define the default file type associations. Some methods to do so can be found at:\nRoam File & URL associations on Windows 10:\nhttps://communities.vmware.com/docs/DOC-32905 Fixing Default File Type Associations in Windows 10—Login VSI Tips & Tricks:\nhttps://www.loginvsi.com/blog/login-vsi/518-fixing-default-file-type-associations-in-windows-10 Microsoft Edge Browser With the introduction of Edge, a new browser is added to Windows 10. Edge is also a Universal app, which means it runs in an isolated sandbox that is harder to manage.\nUser Environment Manager has a community page where people can upload their own configuration files to share. The list of these files can be found at: https://communities.vmware.com/community/vmtn/user-environment-manager/content?filterID=contentstatus[published]~objecttype~objecttype[document] \nFor the Edge browser, a good User Environment Manager Configuration File can be found here: https://communities.vmware.com/docs/DOC-32791 \nInternet Explorer 11 Browser With the introduction of Internet Explorer 10, Microsoft decided to store all browsing information (cookies, history, etc.) in a central database in the user profile.\nBecause of the file size, this database has not been included in the regular User Environment Manager template configuration files Internet Explorer Personal Settings and Internet Explorer Passwords. If you want to capture this database to offer the best experience to your users, simply create a new User Environment Manager configuration file called “Internet Explorer WebCache” and add this content:\n[ IncludeFiles ]\n<LocalAppData>\\Microsoft\\Windows\\WebCache\\WebCacheV01.dat\nUser Environment Manager uses compression, so the size of the database will be optimized. However, be aware that managing this WebCache still adds some time to log on and log off because of the large file size.\nResources VMware User Environment Manager Community: https://communities.vmware.com/community/vmtn/user-environment-manager/content VMware OS Optimization Tool: https://labs.vmware.com/flings/vmware-os-optimization-tool Microsoft TechNet: https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/deploymentguys/2016/03/07/windows-10-start-layout-customization/ Login VSI blog: https://www.loginvsi.com/blog/login-vsi/518-fixing-default-file-type-associations-in-windows-10 HTG blog: http://www.htguk.com/blog/ The post Managing Windows 10 with VMware User Environment Manager appeared first on VMware End-User Computing Blog .",

      "text": "Shares of Salesforce.com ( CRM ) are climbing Friday, up nearly 4% after the company beat on earnings per share and revenue expectations.\nThe company also gave guidance for $10 billion in full-year sales for 2018, which would represent growth north of 20% , presuming the company's guidance for 2017 sales of $8.365 billion to $8.375 billion comes to fruition.\nHowever, the company took a subtle swipe at Oracle ( ORCL ) on its conference call and a not-so-subtle jab at Microsoft ( MSFT ) , said TheStreet's Jim Cramer, co-manager of the Action Alerts PLUS portfolio , on CNBC's \"Stop Trading\" segment.\nCramer said of Salesforce and Microsoft, \"They were friends, then they were frenemies, and now they're just enemies.\"\nIt wasn't all that long ago that Microsoft almost bought Salesforce, he added.\nAside from Microsoft's emergence in the cloud world, it doesn't help that it outbid Salesforce for LinkedIn ( LNKD ) earlier this year, paying $26.2 billion for the company, Cramer concluded.",

Create quotes, orders and invoices just in fly and become more productive. Without the close cooperation with Dynamics 365 product group a, we won’t be able to complete our extensions in time for the launch of Microsoft Dynamics 365. — Andreas Thurek, CTO and Cloud Chief architect DORTMUND, NW, DEUTSCHLAND, November 18, 2016 /   Since 1st of November Dynamics 365, the cloud-based suite of Microsoft’s business applications is general available. Now triomis GmbH, first time Dynamics CRM Partner from Dortmund, Germany announces the availability of their extensions for Dynamics 365. Dynamics 365 offers a single, scalable toolkit for businesses to address specific needs, such as sales automation, operations, field and customer service. The new Cloud service works perfectly together with Microsoft's other Cloud offers Office 365 and Azure, and provides with AppSource a suitable AppStore for extensions. Microsoft is combining its current CRM and ERP cloud products into a single cloud bundle called Microsoft Dynamics 365. The new software runs atop Microsoft Azure cloud. The offering includes functionality that once was found in several product lines including Dynamics AX (for Axapta), Dynamics CRM, Dynamics NAV (for Navision)—all products acquired by Microsoft more than a decade ago. First Dynamics CRM and Dynamics AX (now Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Operations) will be provided as Dynamics 365. The integration of Dynamics NAV will follow in spring 2017. Even after merging, Dynamics 365 for Sales and Dynamics CRM 365 for Services, formerly Dynamics CRM, have missing functions for sales tax calculation, copying of invoices, offers and orders, as well as mass mailing. However, the functionality of Dynamics 365 can be extended by buying and installing apps. Dynamics Customers are able to install triomis’ VAT Calculator , CopyEntity for copying sales objects as well as Campaign-it for e-mail marketing integration from AppSource marketplace. Andreas Thurek, CTO and Cloud Chief architect of triomis announced further extensions for automated billing of service contracts and subscriptions, as well as industry templates for veterinary and medical clinics, hotel management and club management. Dynamics 365 for Services is the core of these solutions. The service calendar provides an excellent basis for appointment and resource booking as well as service management. triomis solutions also use the common data model provided by Dynamics 365, which means partners like triomis can easily extend Dynamics 365 capabilities with their unique industry and function specific apps.\nStephan Thurek",

      "text": "Microsoft Stock Upgraded at Goldman Sachs (MSFT) By Richard Saintvilus | November 18, 2016 — 10:33 AM EST \nShares of Microsoft Corporation ( MSFT ) rose as much as 2.17% Thursday, reaching a session high $60.95 on above-average volume after the software giant received an endorsement by analysts at Goldman Sachs. \nOn Thursday, citing strong growth opportunities in cloud computing , Goldman analyst Heather Bellini raised her rating on the software giant to Buy from Neutral. Bellini believes that Microsoft's Azure cloud platform will prosper against competing services by Amazon.com, Inc. ( AMZN ), which was something we noted on Wednesday. (See also: Cloud Computing: An Industry in Exponential Growth .) \n\"We believe the shares are poised to more consistently outperform in the year ahead on the back of sustained traction in its cloud offerings,\" Bellini said in a research note to investors. \"We estimate that Microsoft Azure will contribute $0.94, or 19% of Microsoft's total 2020 non-GAAP EPS of $4.83, and potentially $19 per share (23% of total estimated value).\" \nBellini lifted her price target on Microsoft to $68 from $60. The stock closed Thursday at $60.75, up 1.84%. Based on Bellini's price target, Microsoft can still deliver some 12% returns from current levels. That's not to suggest that the shares are cheap. The stock is priced at a forward P/E of 20 for 2017, which is three points above the S&P 500 ( SPX ) index average. \nAt the same time, a pricey valuation doesn't mean the shares can't still climb, especially when the company is projected to outgrow the average S&P 500 stock in terms of earnings per share . Microsoft shares, which closed Wednesday at $59.65, have risen 9.3% year to date, compared with a 7% rise in the S&P 500 index. The stock has a consensus Buy rating and an average price target of $64. (See also: Elon Musk-Backed AI Startup, Microsoft Ink Cloud Agreement .)

      "text": "For the second year in a row, the share of women employees at Microsoft slipped, this time dropping from 26.8% to 25.8%. Now, the tech behemoth has a new plan to stop--and hopefully reverse--that slide.\nThe decline in women was due in large part to the company’s May divestment of Nokia handset factories, which had a higher representation of female employees. Outside of that “direct production” unit, the percentage of women at Microsoft actually increased, albeit by only 0.4 percentage points. The company also reported modest gains in racial and ethnic minority hiring. African American representation inched up 0.2 percentage points to 3.7%, while Hispanic representation rose 0.1 percentage points to 5.5%.\nSubscribe to The World's Most Powerful Women, Fortune's daily must-read for global businesswomen. \nIn an effort to give those figures a bigger boost, the Redmond, Washington-based company is rolling out a new program that will tie senior leaders’ compensation to diversity gains in their respective organizations, according to a blog post its chief diversity and inclusion officer Gwen Houston posted Thursday.\nIn tying bonuses to diversity, Microsoft is taking a page out of the British government’s playbook. Earlier this year, the U.K. Treasury launched a new charter that, among other initiatives, encourages financial firms to connect parts of executive teams’ remuneration packages to gender balance targets as a way to change the male-dominated nature of financial services industry. So far, nearly 100 firms have signed on .\nIn her blog post, Houston also mentioned other diversity hiring initiatives, including launching a website aimed specifically at attracting diverse talent and an “Inclusive Design” initiative to develop products and technology for audiences of all abilities.\nThese initiatives reflect the outlook of Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, who has sought to make the tech giant more inclusive. Bloomberg reports that he talks about diversity efforts at each one of his monthly Q&A sessions with employees. And in recent interviews with Fortune , Nadella expressed his passion for helping build tools and tech for users with disabilities. “I have a particular passion around accessibility, and this is something I spend quite a bit of cycles on,\" Nadella said. He has a son with special needs. \"One thing is certain in life: All of us will need accessibility tools at some point,” he said.",

      "text": "EY CEO Mark Weinberger interviews LinkedIn CEO Jeff Weiner, right, at the EY Strategic Growth Forum (GeekWire Photo / John Cook) PALM DESERT, Calif.— Microsoft has a mixed track record when it comes to large acquisitions, with big-time misses on deals such as Nokia and aQuantive.\nBut it’s a new era under Satya Nadella, who earlier this year embarked on the software giant’s biggest acquisition to date when it announced intentions to buy LinkedIn for a whopping $26 billion .\nBefore the deal could progress, Nadella had to convince LinkedIn CEO Jeff Weiner that Microsoft would not screw things up. And to do that, Nadella told Weiner that the companies had to be absolutely aligned on two key things: a sense of purpose and structure.\nSpeaking at the EY Strategic Growth Forum Thursday, Weiner said that he’s emboldened by the possibilities of the two companies coming together.\nAnd Weiner add that he was even a bit surprised by the “very similar sense of purpose” for Microsoft and LinkedIn. When you look at Microsoft’s mission of empowering every individual and organization to achieve more, that aligns almost perfectly with what LinkedIn is trying to accomplish, said Weiner.\n“Microsoft has been coming at it, historically, through its development and offering of software, and now, increasingly the cloud. And we were coming at it through the development of a professional network, and increasingly this economic graph,” said Weiner. “In combination, that is a really unique position to be in, in terms of creating value and unlocking value for all of these members and customers.”\nAs it relates to structure, Weiner said that he was convinced that the tie-up would work as soon as he heard Nadella utter the words independence.\n“He was talking about doing this in a very different way in terms of how Microsoft had done previous acquisitions,” said Weiner, who called the acquisition a “re-founding” moment for LinkedIn. “LinkedIn could continue to focus on growing LinkedIn. He has been true to his word from that very first meeting. Satya has been nothing but authentic and genuine. And everything he has told me in those discussions has been cascaded more broadly to both of our teams repeatedly.”\n \nThe remarks by Weiner echo what he told staffers shortly after the deal was announced, with the tech executive writing in a memo to staffers that little would change at LinkedIn given its ability to operate independently.\nWeiner noted that the acquisition — which has yet to close — is progressing wonderfully. And he said that he continues to be impressed with Nadella’s passion and vision.\n“It has been wonderful working together over the last several months,” said Weiner. “We have not closed yet. But we have rolled up our sleeves and we are starting to think through what is possible, and are very excited about the future.”\n ",

      "text": "  11:46am CST | by IANS , in News | Latest Business News Photo Credit: Getty Images \nThere has been a decline in the percentage of women working at Microsoft, said the company's diversity report, adding that the technology giant saw \"modest gains\" in the representation of African Americans, Black and Hispanic/Latino(a) employees. \nBy the end of September 2016, women made up 25.8 percent of Microsoft's global workforce which is a one percent drop from previous year's 26.8 percent, said the report release on Thursday. \nIn 2014, 29 percent of Microsoft's global workforce comprised of women. \n\"This decline was largely due to the business decision we shared last year to restructure our phone hardware business (Nokia), which resulted in the closure of some factories outside the U.S. The workforce at these factories had a higher representation of women, so their closure impacted our total representation of women,\" said Gwen Houston, Chief Diversity & Inclusion Officer at Microsoft. \nThe diversity repport provides a glimpse of the gender and racial composition of Microsoft's employee population as of September 30, 2016. \nMicrosoft is creating and delivering compelling career development offerings for women and racial/ethnic minorities, Houston said.

      "text": "\nMicrosoft's Surface Book is gaining ground as one of the powerful laptops that you can purchase. The reason why more of us do not own the innovative and unique machine is simple: the price.\n\nBasically the only was to save money when buying a Surface Book is by cutting back on the hardware configuration. But you can cut corners on the configured SSD storage and expand your storage space later. I hear the howls of protest, your shouts that the Surface Book isn't hardware upgradeable. This is true. But you can still expand on your storage in a neat, clean, and affordable fashion — even if you've already maxed things out with 1TB of SSD crammed inside. ",

      "text": "\nThe UWP Community Toolkit is a collection of helper functions, custom controls, and app services that can be used to build UWP apps for any Windows 10 device, including PC, Mobile, Xbox, IoT and HoloLens. You can also use the toolkit with an existing desktop app converted to UWP using the Desktop Bridge. Microsoft today announced the availability of UWP Community Toolkit 1.2 .\nChange log: \nNew Helpers. we worked on providing 7 new helpers to help with everyday tasks: BackgroundTaskHelper to help you work with background tasks HttpHelper to help you deal with HTTP requests in a secure and reliable way PrintHelper to help you print XAML controls DispacherHelper to help you work with tasks that need to run on UI thread DeepLinkHelper to simplify the management of your deep links WebViewExtensions to allow you to bind HTML content to your Webview SystemInformation to gather all system information into a single and unique class New Controls We introduced a new control named MasterDetailView that helps developers create master/detail user experiences Updates . We updated the following features: ImageCache was improved to provide a more robust cache HeaderedTextBlock and PullToRefreshListView now accept ContentTemplate customization Facebook service now supports paging when requesting data Renamed BladeControl to BladeView. BladeView now also derives from ItemsControl. This will allow for more common convention like data binding and will make the control aligned with SDK naming. To guarantee backward compatibility, we kept the previous control and flagged it as obsolete. This way, developers can still reference the new version and everything will work just fine. A compiler warning will just encourage you to use the new version. The current plan is to keep obsolete classes until next major version and then remove them. Read more about this release here .",

      "text": "SplitBook is a pretty neat third-party Splitwise app for Windows 10 \nEarlier today, we reported that the US Microsoft Store had just set up a dedicated page for the upcoming Black Friday Deals that will be available to consumers starting November 24. Looking at the details, we saw that two offers on the Lumia 950 XL (currently priced at $499) and the HP Elite x3 (currently priced at $799, with a Desk Dock) were quite confusing as the Microsoft Store doesn’t provide as much details as for the other discounted products right now. You could easily think that the Lumia 950XL is offered for just $1. \nWe’ve reached the Microsoft Store to learn more details on these discounts and here is what a Microsoft Store spokesperson answered us: Starting November 24, purchasing the $499 Lumia 950 XL will get you a free unlocked Lumia 950 ($379.05 value) plus a free Microsoft Display Dock ($99 value). On this same day, the Microsoft Store will start selling a $1,148 HP Elite x3 Bundle featuring the handset ( $799 value ), the HP Laptop Dock ( $599 value ), a free silicon case and a free screen protector. \nEarlier in April, the Microsoft Store also offered for a limited time a free Lumia 950 with a Lumia 950XL purchase in the US and Canada , though this previous offer did not include a free Display Dock as well. \nAs for the offer on the HP Elite x3 bundle, the free Laptop Dock really seems to be great value as this expensive accessory does enable the use of Continuum in a true mobile setting, transforming the Windows 10 Mobile handset in a lightweight notebook. Sound off in the comments if you’re looking forward to take advantage of these offers starting November 24. In this story stream:",

However, according to a diversity report for updated as of September 30, 2016, the company’s female employee rate is continuing to fall (via ZDNet ). \nThis is the second year in a row that Microsoft has noted a significant decrease of women in its global workforce. Three years ago, the company had a solid 29% but the Nokia shutdown in Finland left Microsoft with a declining feminine influence. Originally it dropped down to 26.8% and this year it is continuing that decline to 25.8%. \nWith only a quarter of the company identified as women, Bloomberg Technology does point out that at least Microsoft is having a ‘very modest’ increase of minority individuals. African American employee numbers went up from 0.2% to 3.7% and Hispanic/Latino numbers gained from 0.1% to 5.5% among the workforce. \nGwen Houston, the company’s chief diversity and inclusion officer, assured Bloomberg that the decline in women employees was a temporary setback. According to their interview, women make up 27.7% of new hires since the report. Most of them were hired for technical jobs. Also, 6.6% of them were African American and 7% of them were Hispanic/Latino.",

      "text": "SplitBook is a pretty neat third-party Splitwise app for Windows 10 \nOnce again, Microsoft’s Connect() conference has born some interesting software release details such as Visual Studio Tool for Unity 3 Preview making its way to developers . For short, VSTU is the “free Visual Studio add-on that enables rich programming and debugging experience for working with the Unity gaming tools and platform.” \nDevelopers currently using Visual Studio 2015 Update 3 can now get their hands on the new preview that now: \nVSTU 3 focuses on improving on the fundamentals of an IDE: code editing and debugging. The highlights of this release include: \nCode Coloration for Unity messages: Unity messages (or event functions) now stand out from other methods in the editor. By default, they’ll be colored like keywords, but you can change them to your liking. In this screenshot they’re configured to be colored in bright orange. \nIntelliSense: VSTU 3 Preview plugs into Visual Studio’s C# IntelliSense engine to provide code completion for Unity messages. Just start declaring a method, and if you’re in a class that supports Unity messages, our IntelliSense will kick-in and show you the list of Unity messages your script can implement. \nImproved Expression Evaluator: The expression evaluator is responsible for displaying the values of the Locals and the results of the expressions you input into the Watch and Immediate Window. We’ve improved our expression evaluator to behave closer to the .NET debugger that C# developers know and love. \nAccording to Microsoft’s Visual Studio blog, developers will need to be running Unity 5.4 to run Visual Studio 2017 RC as their script editor and the setup process will have to be manual due to the fact that Unity won’t automatically recognize VS 2017 RC’s installation. \nFor more on VSTU 3 Preview and 2017 RC installations, we encourage readers to visit the Microsoft Visual Studio blog as soon as possible.

      "text": "Microsoft has turned on a new set of Windows Tips that inform Chrome and Firefox users on Windows 10 that Edge is a “safer” browser. We reached out to Microsoft to find out how long this latest recommendation has been active. “This wave of Windows Tips for Windows 10 users began in early November,” a Microsoft spokesperson told VentureBeat.\nIf this sounds familiar, that’s because Microsoft turned on similar Windows 10 tips back in July, warning Chrome/Firefox users about battery drain and then recommending Edge instead . Those notifications were on the battery icon in the operating system, while this new one is on the Edge icon:\n\nReddit user by “illCodeYouABrain” noted the prompt happened when launching Firefox, although not every time. We confirmed with Microsoft that the same “tip” was active for Chrome as well.\nIn July, a Microsoft spokesperson told us that “these Windows Tips notifications were created to provide people with quick, easy information that can help them enhance their Windows 10 experience.” This time, the spokesperson noted that Windows 10 users can always change default settings and preferences, including turning off these notifications in their system’s settings (for those interested, open the Settings app => System => Notifications => Disable “Get tips, tricks and suggestions as you use Windows”).\nThe battery drain notification was timed with Microsoft’s battery-savings campaign for Edge and this security one is no different. The company commissioned NSS Labs to compare the security of the three major Windows browsers and unsurprisingly — Microsoft has a long history of asking NSS Labs to do a study in which its browser comes out on top — Edge won in a specific metric. That’s where the “It blocks 21% more socially engineered malware” part from the notification comes from.\nSecurity is of utmost importance in browsers. For a long time now, Microsoft has been pushing the envelope in security, and it’s understandable the company wants to highlight that. But as we noted last time, leveraging notifications within Windows 10 to promote them could be seen as poor practice. Google and Mozilla don’t have the option to do the same in Windows 10 if they want to highlight the strengths of Chrome or Firefox, respectively.\nWe’re already used to Google’s search engine pushing Chrome, Yahoo linking to Firefox, and Bing recommending Edge. Microsoft is upping the ante in this browser with Windows 10.\n",

The earlier you get started on that process the easier it is to manage it and obligate future dollars to the effort. \nI have shared a lot of these resources here at IT Pro: Windows and today I want to send another one your way for consideration. \nThe Windows 10 for Business Onboarding Kit (access is free but does require registration) provides information in three areas for your deployment planning: Deploying Windows 10: Automating deployment by using System Center Configuration Manager, by Andre Della Monica, Alessandro Cesarini, Russ Rimmerman, and Victor Silveira. This authoritative reference book explains how to deploy Windows 10 through a number of both attended and unattended automated methods. Windows 10 Readiness Tools: Use this handy bundle of resources to distribute to employees during your Windows 10 deployment to help them get up and running. This kit will help your employees make a smooth and successful transition to Windows 10, so your organization can start enjoying the benefits of Windows 10 right away. The Modern Workplace Watchdog eBook: It’s time stop sacrificing flexibility and efficiency in the name of security. Learn how to protect the information, systems, and people vital to your business with Windows 10, the most secure Windows ever. \nThese documents and others from Microsoft can help you plan a smooth migration to Windows 10 and still leave time to spare before extended support expires in early 2020. \nBut, wait...there's probably more so be sure to follow me on Twitter and Google+ .",

      "text": "Microsoft's Paint 3D app arrives on Windows 10 preview Say goodbye to cheesy pixels and hello to cheesy 3D clip-art. Share Save \nMicrosoft has incorporated its revamped Paint 3D app into the latest Windows 10 Insider Preview build. First announced as part of the Windows 10 Creators update , it has nothing to do with the crude raster tool that has been the butt of jokes since Windows 1.0. Rather, it's more of a 3D app for the masses that lets you create complex scenes with relative ease. You can scan real-world objects using a smartphone camera, use 3D \"clipart\" created by by the Remix 3D community and even output your final models to a 3D printer. \nPaint 3D and Remix 3D will only be available in English for now, Microsoft says, but it'll expand regions and languages soon. Going forward, the app will be a permanent (and free) part of Windows 10. Other new features include ePub reading in Microsoft Edge (with three themes), PowerShell as the defacto File Explorer command shell, improved language support and, of course, a bunch of bug fixes. The Windows 10 Preview build (14971) is now rolling out to Insiders on the Fast Ring , Microsoft's update system for braver users who want new stuff as quickly as possible.",

      "text": "Even with a dedicated administration team, manually tracking down every unused instance and misconfigured security policy in a cloud deployment can be incredibly time-consuming for organizations.\nMicrosoft Corp. claims that it’s come up with a better approach. The company on Thursday unveiled Azure Advisor, a diagnostics tool for its infrastructure-as-a-service platform that can automatically identify operational issues in a customer deployments. It’s essentially an expanded version of the troubleshooting engine that the firm rolled out for Azure SQL Database last year. Rather than focusing exclusively on database clusters, the new service can provide insight into an organization’s entire cloud environment.\nAzure Advisor is accessible through a user-friendly console that lets administrators quickly specify which parts of their infrastructure they wish to analyze and select what information they want. Recommendations produced by the service focus on one of three areas: Improving the performance of cloud applications, increasing their availability or reducing operating expenses. And the tool also provides the option of displaying configuration tips from the Azure Security Console to save users the trouble of opening two separate windows.\nIn the same spirit, Microsoft has equipped Azure Advisor with an inline troubleshooting feature that lets administrators act upon recommendations without having to switch back and forth from other tabs. The company thus hopes to up the ante against Amazon Inc.’s Trusted Advisor , which similarly generates operational guidance for users of its rivaling public cloud.\nAzure Advisor could also be an attractive alternative to third party optimization services such as Cloudyn in certain scenarios. Microsoft’s tool should be particularly appealing to smaller organizations that rely exclusively on its platform to power their cloud workloads and don’t require too many advanced features as a result, notably support for other providers. Even up-and-coming startups can potentially benefit from the ability to automatically uncover operational inefficiencies in their deployments.\nImage courtesy of Microsoft ",

      "text": "By Andy Weir Senior News Editor Neowin LLC @gcaweir · 13 minutes ago with 2 comments \nMicrosoft's mobile business has been declining for some time now. In its latest earnings report, the company revealed that the quarterly revenue from its phone hardware division had dropped to just $300 million, down from $2.6 billion two years earlier . Its current range of Windows 10 Mobile devices has done little to inspire buyers - but as its current flagships approach the end of their retail lives , one of their most important features lives on in other premium Windows phones launched by some of Microsoft's partners. \nContinuum is a defining feature of the Windows 10 Mobile proposition . It allows owners of high-end handsets to use a mouse and keyboard with their device when connected to a larger display, either wirelessly or via a wired docking station. That's precisely why Acer described its Windows 10 Mobile flagship as a 'pocket PC' ; in Continuum mode, a phone becomes much more like a PC, including a desktop-style interface and Start menu. \nFrom smaller companies like NuAns and Coship , to better known brands like Alcatel and VAIO , numerous manufacturers have now embraced Microsoft's Continuum vision with premium Windows 10 Mobile handsets of their own. HP has been particularly enthusiastic about Continuum with its Elite x3 flagship , designing its own Desk Dock, as well as a notebook-style Lap Dock that enables owners to use their phones as a PC on the move. While Acer uses the 'pocket PC' descriptor, HP goes even further, referring to the Elite x3 as a '3-in-1 device'. \nBut Continuum isn't perfect. \nFirst, there's the software. Older Windows Phone apps can't run in Continuum mode - instead, you're limited to newer Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps downloaded from the Windows Store. Some Windows Store apps - those which have been converted from Win32 or .NET using the Desktop App Converter - aren't compatible with the ARM processors of Windows 10 Mobile devices either. 'Pocket PC' is a nice turn of phrase, but Windows 10 Mobile phones can't run any software designed for x86 systems, thereby excluding many of the older applications that people are accustomed to using on their Windows desktop PCs and notebooks. \nHP is getting around that limitation through virtualization, using its cloud capabilities to stream x86 applications to its Elite x3 handset. But that functionality is targeted exclusively at businesses, with a minimum cost of $579 per user per year . \nIndeed, cost is another issue with the Continuum proposition. The Elite x3 costs $799 with the Desk Dock , but mouse, keyboard and monitor are sold separately. If you want to use Continuum on the go, that will set you back a further $599 for the Lap Dock . More affordable options are available - Acer's year-old Liquid Jade Primo is now available for $449 including a desktop dock, mouse and keyboard , but there's still no sign of the Lap Dock-style 'Mobile Extender' that the company showed off seven months ago . \nAnd there's also the question of convenience. On paper, it sounds very handy to have one device that can act as your phone, laptop and PC - but the reality appears less convenient. Do you carry the phone, mouse, keyboard and dock with you wherever you go, connecting it all up when you get to work, home or your hotel? Do you have a dock at home, a dock at work, and a laptop dock when you're on the move? Given the software limitations, is any of that really more convenient than just having a smartphone, a fully capable laptop, and/or a desktop, that can run all of the software you might want to use? \nOf course, there's no denying that Continuum is a 'version 1.0' product, and it would be very easy to write it off as limited, costly or cumbersome - but it's not hard to imagine how it could be developed in the future into a much more complete offering. \nAs we discussed in a feature article last year , despite Microsoft's struggles in the smartphone market, it's clearly aware that mobile computing is the future, and with the advent of increasingly powerful technology, that future may well bring us a single device to replace our smartphones, notebooks, desktops, and even consoles. \nMicrosoft has already promised more improvements to Continuum - designed to make the experience even more 'PC-like', and which will arrive in its Windows 10 Mobile Creators Update early next year - and the company no doubt has further enhancements planned beyond that. \nPerhaps, then, the limitations of Continuum today should be viewed as a necessary first step towards that more capable future. Perhaps you've already decided that it's a pointless feature, and that separate devices make more sense. Or perhaps you've found that Continuum perfectly suits your requirements, and you're simply looking forward to what comes next. \nWe're very eager to hear your thoughts on this, so please share them with us below!

      "title": "Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff is telling an odd story about how Microsoft tricked him (CRM, MSFT)",
      "text": "Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff is still doing damage control over Microsoft's $26 billion acquisition of LinkedIn.\nLately, Benioff has been hinting that the guy he once thought was his friend, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, duped Benioff into revealing part of Salesforce's strategy to Microsoft.\nBenioff told this story to attendees of the  Code Conference on Monday , and just expanded on it Thursday on CNBC's \"Mad Money with Jim Cramer.\"  (emphasis ours).\n\"Well, we just had a surprise. That's all that is. We thought there was a new Microsoft. We got a call from Satya said, \"Hey, you know, we're so excited to work with you. Would you spend some time with Scott Guthrie? He runs Azure. You're gonna love him. Tell him all about your strategy.\" And we met with Scott Guthrie. And then two weeks later, read in the newspaper that Scott Guthrie's now in charge of their CRM business. I'm like, 'Well, that would have been good to know ahead of time.'  And then I kind of was like, 'You know, maybe the new Microsoft is actually the old Microsoft.' And look, these were the mid-managers during that era. Now they've moved up. And the culture's back.\"\nThe timeline surrounding this story deserves a close look.\nThe companies' public friendship began when Nadella was named CEO of Microsoft in early 2014, and began reaching out to others in the industry to create partnerships as he shifted the company from selling Windows and other software to selling cloud services. \nOne of those cloud services is customer relationship management (CRM), which helps salespeople track prospects and manage interactions with customers. This is Salesforce's flagship product. Microsoft offers a competitor called Dynamics, and the two companies have historically been major competitors and enemies. \nBut in May 2014, the announced a partnership that would see both of them offering more support to each other's products in some areas, while continuing to compete in CRM.\nThe companies continued to talk, and in spring 2015, according to reports by  CNBC's David Faber  and Bloomberg's Dina Bass , Microsoft was talking to Salesforce about a possible acquisition. Talks broke down when the companies couldn't agree on price, Faber reported.\nGurthrie took over the CRM business for Microsoft a little after that happened, in June 2015.   \nEven after all this, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella appeared at Salesforce's huge annual conference, Dreamforce, in October 2015 — months after Benioff says he began to get suspicious.\n \nIn other words, Benioff may have started having second thoughts about Microsoft and Nadella's intentions throughout 2015, but they don't appear to have been too serious until last June.\nThat's when Microsoft outbid Salesforce for LinkedIn, paying $26.2 billion for the professional social network.\nWhy he's worried REUTERS/Adnan Abidi Benioff is concerned that once Microsoft has its hands on LinkedIn, it will control all of LinkedIn's professional data and block salespeople using Salesforce (and other competing CRM products) from accessing LinkedIn.\nSalespeople rely heavily on LinkedIn to help them find prospects and make cold calls.\nIn fact, last summer, Salesforce scored a deal that let it hook directly into that LinkedIn data, though a tool called Sales Navigator. \nIf Microsoft gives itself exclusive or even just advantaged access to that data, Microsoft will hurt Salesforce deeply.\nMicrosoft has continually said that LinkedIn will continue to operate as its own entity. And LinkedIn says it has been talking with other CRM vendors to give them the same access to LinkedIn via Sales Navigator.\nBut Benioff isn't buying it. He keeps referring to something that Guthrie said in September 2016 at the  Deutsche Bank Technology Conference (emphasis ours):\n\"I think we've kind of talked about the cloud growth that we've had obviously with Azure and Office 365, Dynamics has been on an absolute tear as well. And we see huge upside with that. And the exciting part, we've announced plans to acquire LinkedIn. ... You create the ultimate selling tool, the ultimate customer support tool in the industry because you have so much insight that can assist a sales rep or assist a customer service rep that no one other vendor can provide. \"\nThat's why Benioff has been complaining to regulators with the hopes that they will block the deal outright (unlikely) or put conditions on it (possible). The US and other countries have already given their blessing to the acquisition.\nBut European commissioners are apparently listening. Earlier this week, the EU said Microsoft has already offered some concessions over the deal, reports Reuters.  \nIn the meantime, Benioff is clearly a lot cooler toward Microsoft than he was a year ago.\nNOW WATCH: JACK DANIEL’S MASTER DISTILLER: This is the real difference between scotch, whiskey, and bourbon \n",

      "title": "Microsoft now reminds Chrome and Firefox users about Edge’s security features on Windows 10",
      "text": "\nMicrosoft has been showing ads and trying to get Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox users to use its Edge browser on Windows 10. The company’s Edge browser is lighter, faster, and consumes less battery than the other browsers on Windows 10. And Microsoft made sure to advertise these features on Windows 10 with popup notifications on the taskbar which it likes to call “tips”. The software giant also started notifying users about Edge’s new extensions on Windows 10.\nRecently, Microsoft rolled out a new wave of these tips — this time, it’s notifying users about Edge’s security features. The tip, which you can see in the screenshot below states that “Edge is safer than Firefox” when users start up Firefox (not on every startup). Microsoft has also confirmed that it’s also showing a similar tip to Google Chrome users on Windows 10. In addition to this, the tip also states Microsoft Edge blocks 21% more socially engineered malware according to a study from NSS Labs.\n\nA Microsoft spokesperson told VentureBeat: \n“This wave of Windows Tips for Windows 10 users began in early November. These Windows Tips notifications were created to provide people with quick, easy information that can help them enhance their Windows 10 experience.”\nThe spokesperson also noted that Windows 10 users can disable these tips if they don’t want to see them by heading over to the Settings app (Settings > System > Notifications) where they can disable these tips by unticking “Get tips, tricks, and suggestions as you use Windows”.\nMicrosoft isn’t the only company using the Tips feature on Windows 10 — some of its important partners such as Facebook recently used this feature to promote its Live Video feature to Windows 10 users.",

      "title": "Why Microsoft Shares Almost Hit a 52-Week High",
      "text": "Microsoft shares flirted with a 52-week high on Thursday and got pretty close again on Friday, thanks to an upgrade and glowing report from Goldman Sachs analyst Heather Bellini.\nThe company’s 52-week peak is $61.37 and at one point Friday morning, Microsoft shares hit $61.12 before falling slightly.\nOn Wednesday, Goldman Sachs gs upgraded the software giant to buy from neutral and upped its price target to $68 from $60. The reason? Bellini and company think Microsoft msft shares will do very well in the upcoming year as the company’s Azure public cloud and Office 365 applications gain traction.The authors added that the “steady albeit not spectacular performance” of Microsoft’s traditional Office and Windows franchises doesn’t hurt either. Windows and Office have been Microsoft’s cash cows for decades.\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune 's technology newsletter. \nMicrosoft, like every other software company of a certain age, is navigating a tricky transition from selling highly profitable software that runs on corporate servers and PCs to the more modern Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) model pioneered by Salesforce .com. In that model the software vendor runs, maintains, and updates the software on its own servers and streams it out to customers over the internet. Business customers typically pay a subscription fee for that streamed software. Over the past decade, Microsoft Office 365 has been following in Salesforce’s crm footsteps.\nMicrosoft Azure is a different sort of animal. It competes head-to-head with market leader Amazon Web Services for selling or renting computing, networking, and storage capacity that it owns and operates for customers.\n \n\nIn its 72-page cloud report, Goldman Sachs also estimated that revenue from public clouds in aggregate will more-than-quadruple to $140 billion in 2020 from $30 billion this year.\nWhile you could quibble with those numbers there is no doubt that more businesses are putting more applications and storing more of their data in public clouds. Some do so to augment their existing data centers , others are foregoing their own data centers altogether.\nThe public cloud market, according to the report, will also become more concentrated between four major players: Amazon, Microsoft, Google googl , and Alibaba baba , the Chinese retail giant that is getting more aggressive in the market.\nFor more on cloud computing, watch: \nWhy so few? Not many companies can spend the multiple billions of dollars a year to build and maintain data centers around the world needed to run all that compute power. Over the past year or so, other companies that had set their sites on being public cloud providers, Hewlett Packard Enterprise hpe and VMware vmw among them, have backtracked on that strategy.",

      "title": "Despite paying $26B for LinkedIn, Microsoft plans to be handsoff according to CEO Satya Nadella",
      "text": "SplitBook is a pretty neat third-party Splitwise app for Windows 10 \n$26 billion is a lot of money for any one company to pay for the acquisition of another. With such a large paycheck heading to LinkendIn, it’s understandable that Microsoft would have 26 billion reasons to want to assert its control over the professional social networking service. \nHowever, LinkendIn CEO Jeff Weiner spoke to an audience at the EY Strategic Growth Forum about some reassurances he received from the head man in charge at Microsoft about the company’s commitment to treating the deal as independently as possible. Linkedin talking about Microsoft take over \nAccording to Weiner, Microsoft’s CEO Satya Nadella spoke of the two businesses alignment and similar purpose as being the driving force behind the acquisition. \nMicrosoft has been coming at it, historically, through its development and offering of software, and now, increasingly the cloud. And we were coming at it through the development of a professional network, and increasingly this economic graph,” said Weiner. “In combination, that is a really unique position to be in, in terms of creating value and unlocking value for all of these members and customers.” \nTo that end, Weiner has found Nadells’ words and Microsoft’s actions thus far have reflected a company looking to do things very differently in its recent acquisitions. \nHe was talking about doing this in a very different way in terms of how Microsoft had done previous acquisitions,” said Weiner, who called the acquisition a “re-founding” moment for LinkedIn. “LinkedIn could continue to focus on growing LinkedIn. He has been true to his word from that very first meeting. Satya has been nothing but authentic and genuine. And everything he has told me in those discussions has been cascaded more broadly to both of our teams repeatedly.” \nGeekwire further illuminates on how the acquisition is going for the two businesses that have yet to close in a detailed reporting of the conversations between Nadella and Weiner. \nThe summation of the report ends with Weiner seeing the deal “progressing wonderfully,” while he continues to be impressed by Microsoft’s renewed passion and new vision. \nIt will be an interesting couple of years as Microsoft and LinkedIn become more aligned in their products, services and customer goals in the future.

      "text": "Join XBA's Official Xbox One Club for a Chance to Win a $50 Microsoft Gift Card Written   By Alan Pettit View author's profile With the launching of the latest holiday update, Clubs have been introduced to Xbox One. To celebrate our official Xbox One Club and bring a bit of exposure to it, we are offering a $50 Microsoft Gift Card to one lucky member, once we hit 1000 members. This is open to all members, so if you are outside the US, you can accept the US currency if you like (remember, there are US-only games on the marketplace and you can switch regions at any time, so this would give you some cash to purchase those), or we will buy currency in whatever your native region is if you prefer. What is a Club? An Xbox One club is a social group that gamers can join to discuss games, more efficiently group up (using the Looking For Group feature), search for like-minded gamers by game preference, etc. Consider it an Xbox social sphere you can utilize to better streamline your playing experience. How do I join the XBA club? Navigate to your Clubs tab on your console, click on \"Find a club\" and search for \"XBA.\" The title is those three letters only. Open the club and on the Info tab, click to request invitation. An admin will accept you as soon as they are able (we check these daily). You can also do this from the Xbox mobile and Windows 10 apps. Why join club XBA? Why not? You can join up to 25 and there are no downsides. Come chat, share screenshots and gaming accomplishments, look for boosting groups - you name it. Also, get a chance at fifty bucks!",

      "text": "Today marks the “first significant update to Office Online Server” according to the Office team. \nBack in May, the Office team released Offie Online Server (OOS) that enabled businesses to provide its users with browser-based versions of the Office suite that included Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, and Word. \nWith the Office team now having a few months of telemetry to lean on as well as customer suggestions and feedback, the new Office Online Server update is being released with the following updates: Performance improvements to co-authoring in Word Online. Support for embedded Power View sheets in Excel Online. Improvements when working with tables in Word Online and PowerPoint Online, including better drag-and-drop support. Support for showing spelling errors inline in the PowerPoint editor. Improved picture resizing in Word Online. Copy and paste improvements in PowerPoint Online. Support for shapes in Excel Online viewer. Significant improvements for users that rely on assistive technologies—HTML markup updated to more fully support W3C accessibility standards. \nTo try out the new update, the Office team is urging customers to visit their Volume License Servicing Center to download the November release. \nYou must uninstall the previous version of OOS to install the November release.” \nThe Office team is working to adjust that process in coming releases, but in the meantime, customers can expect to receive updates every four months to help ensure Microsoft is offering value to its OOS customers. \nTo read more about OSS, Customer Volume Licensing, or the details of the November update, visit the Office Blogs.

      "title": "Surface Studio review round-up",
      "text": "Microsoft’s Surface line has been on a roll for the past few years, with new devices like the Surface 3 family, Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book being received to wide critical and commercial acclaim. With the new Surface Studio, Microsoft sets its sights on a new category of devices – the All-in-One PC with a “Surface” twist.\nThe Surface Studio has been reviewed by Digital Trends , CNET (FYI: Autoplays video), Engadget and The Verge . You can click the blue links to see their full review or scroll down to read our four in one takeaway for the cliff notes version.\nMuch like a typical Surface, this one is a looker. The sentence, “This is one gorgeous computer.” sums up the critical opinion of the Surface Studio. It isn’t simply its minimalistic, understated design, or its aluminum “legs”, or even its beautiful screen that make it so, its the combination of all those factors put together that seemingly elevate the device for these reviewers.\nWhen it comes to the display, the praise for the Surface Studio is unanimous. Engadget’s Devindra Hardawar says “Mostly, I appreciate the Surface Studio simply for having a big freaking screen. After spending years writing on ultraportables and reading news apps on smartphones and tablets, I sometimes forget how nice it is to use a large screen where you can have a pile of windows thrown about, or simply view a full-size webpage next to a document for note taking. It might just be me, but I’ve found that bigger displays simply let me be more creative.”\nDigital Trends’ Matt Smith says that their “Art Director was in love with the display, saying he found it “incredibly clear, the best Windows display [he’s] seen.” The high pixel density, combined with excellent colour accuracy, makes the Studio eligible for color-critical work right out of the box.” The Verge’s Tom Warren has, even more, words of praise for the Surface’s screen, stating that “It’s stunning to look at and it’s truly one of the best desktop monitors I’ve ever used. It makes things feel oddly lifelike because you can’t see the pixels — text, videos, and pictures just look great on this thing.”\n\nOne of Microsoft’s strong points with their Surface devices (and for the brief period they made them), their Lumia phones has been the quality of the screen. The firm has excelled at pushing out high quality, well calibrated and beautiful screens, and the Surface Studio is clearly no exception.\nThe internals of the device are powerful and impressive, but their outdated status makes their future-proof status doubtful.\n“That’s actually some old tech for such a futuristic-looking PC. Microsoft has opted for last year’s Intel and Nvidia chips, and its storage isn’t all solid state.” Tom Warren notes in his review, explaining ” This is especially tough to swallow on the GPU front because Nvidia’s 2016 Pascal architecture is miles ahead of its predecessors. Intel and Nvidia’s latest chips simply weren’t ready in time for the Surface Studio, and the storage uses a mix of 128GB SSD with a 2TB hard disk drive. That’s disappointing because even a GTX 1060 would have pushed the Studio into VR gaming, something Microsoft is starting to support directly in Windows 10 .”\nDigital Trends’ Smith continues that thread “As you can see, the hybrid drive just can’t keep up with solid state drives. The Origin Millennium was ten times quicker in read speeds. Even the Avant, which had a humble (by modern standards) SATA-connected SSD, was several times quicker than the Surface Studio. We can see this being an area of definite concern for certain users, as the drive’s modest performance could put a crimp on certain workloads. Video editing again seems a prime suspect, as 4K editing can task a drive’s write speeds.”,\nFinally, Engadget’s Hardawar notes “The only major downside is the Studio’s slow disk speeds, which stem from its hybrid SSD/mechanical hard drive approach to storage.” Doubts about the future aside, all have positive things to say about its actual performance in the here and now. The Skylake powered Surface, backed with 32GB of RAM helped run apps even as tasking as Photoshop in a “super-responsive” fashion, being able to juggle “dozens of browser tabs, 4K video playback and Minecraft running with high-quality settings all at once without breaking a sweat.”\n\nThe Surface Dial similarly proved to be both a boon and a bane. Reviewers unanimously panned the peripheral as an “oddity” which was “limited” in scope and application support. Digital Trends’ Smith opines “The Dial is a lot of fun to use, but app support is limited, and that may prove to be the biggest problem. It can’t do much unless developers get on board. It’s also a $100 add-on (pre-orders get it for free), adding even more to the price of this already expensive PC.”, a thread which is picked up by The Verge, “There are nearly 20 apps on Microsoft’s official list, but even many of those just have basic zoom or scroll controls, or just the ability to adjust the system volume. Impressive Dial support can be found in Sketchable , Drawboard , or Mental Canvas, but I’m disappointed that apps like Photoshop don’t have full Dial support. ”\n\nAll the talk about the Surface Studio is ultimately unimportant if you aren’t the target audience. Microsoft provided a huge clue by launching it alongside the Windows 10 Creators Update,and demoed it by showing off art focused apps like Sketchable. The Verge and Digital Trends both engaged the services of artists for their reviews to get an artist’s perspective of it.\nThe Verge’s invited freelance artist Lawrence Mann to have a go at using the Surface Studio. He produced two pieces and went on to say “What astounds me is how close Microsoft have got their experience to what I have already carefully crafted with pieces from three different companies,[ Cintiq, MacBook Pro, and Surface Book combination]”.\nMann thought the accuracy and pen lag seemed comparable to Wacom’s Cintiq, but to be fully satisfied with the Studio he’d like to see some improvements elsewhere. He would like to have the ability to rotate the display, along with a more ergonomic stylus, and some extra buttons on the Dial for more than the basic controls.\nMann says the Studio has left him with a “lot to think about” in terms of opening his own wallet. “I can safely say as a professional digital artist looking to upgrade my main device, the Surface Studio is certainly the strongest contender so far”\nMeanwhile, Engadget enlisted the software engineer and webcomic creator Alexander Sapountzis as their case study was similarly impressed “On the downside, he noticed that palm rejection was worse than with the iPad Pro, and the software ring around the Dial had the annoying habit of drifting down the screen, even if the Dial was staying in place at the Studio’s lowest angle. Both of those issues ended up disrupting his creative flow, which is exactly the opposite of how Microsoft wants people to see the computer.\nThe Surface Studio also had difficulty recognising when he wanted to move an image around, which often led to unwanted brushstrokes from his fingers. Overall, he was impressed with the Surface Studio’s size and form factor, but he wasn’t looking to switch anytime soon. As for the issues mentioned, hopefully it’s the sort of thing Microsoft could fix with a software update. We’ve asked the company to comment on whether it’s working on any fixes.”\n\nYou’ll note that despite all the downsides, both artists came to a very impressed conclusion. – and this is a common thread among all the reviews. CNet sees the device as a beautiful design with a “fantastic” screen, “excellent” colours, the Verge concluded that it is “something unique and a hint of real innovation we haven’t seen for some years with PCs”, and Engadget comments that it is a tool which ” empowers us to work the way we always have, while also giving us entirely new modes of productivity.”\nThe Surface Studio still comes with some downsides, the Surface Dial isn’t standard (much like the Surface Keyboard on the Surface Pros), and app support for it is limited out of the door (though one can expect this to change – at least by a small margin), and it is really, really, expensive. To paraphrase the Digital Trends conclusion, if you end up buying this device – no matter who you are – you’ll love it, but unless you’re an artist or creative type in that field, you won’t truly need it.\nMicrosoft’s Surface Studio ships from next year and you can pre-order it and its accessories from the below links:\nSurface Studio – $2,999.99 Surface Keyboard – $129.99 Surface Ergonomic Keyboard – $129.99 Surface Mouse – $49.99 Surface Dial – $99.99 ",

      "text": "Shares of Microsoft Corporation ( MSFT - Free Report ) have been steadily scaling higher grounds over the last one year. The stock generated a return of 9.30% compared with the S&P 500 index's 7.01%.\nThe upside in the stock price of Microsoft was primarily driven by strong cloud growth. The continuing enterprise strength, benefits from the Office 365 subscription model, strong growth prospects of Azure and promising new products will continue to generate top-line growth in 2016.\nMeanwhile, Microsoft recently announced that it has made its largest purchase of wind energy to date to power its data centers in the U.S. The company will utilize power from three wind farms. While two farms of Allianz Risk Transfer AG will provide 178 megawatts of wind power, another farm owned by Black Hills Corporation will supply Microsoft with 59 megawatts of clean energy.\nMICROSOFT CORP Price \nMICROSOFT CORP Price | MICROSOFT CORP Quote \nWhy this Move? \nCloud computing is gradually gaining traction among the masses, given the convenience and security features it provides to the end user. As per an IDC report, global public cloud services’ spending is estimated to reach $195 billion by 2020 at a CAGR of 20.4%.\nTo operate a cloud infrastructure, data centers are required that in turn require a steady and unwavering power supply to function properly. Given the growing demand for cloud, demand for datacenters and power is likely to increase in the future. To meet the power requirements many major cloud players are turning to renewable sources of energy and Microsoft is no different.\nMicrosoft intends to achieve a 44% dependency on renewable energy for its power requirements by the end of 2016. Similarly, Amazon.com, Inc.’s ( AMZN - Free Report ) Amazon Web Services has plans to achieve a 40% dependency on renewable energy by the end of 2016. Alphabet Inc. ( GOOGL - Free Report ) owned Google is also working on similar lines and currently uses renewable energy for 35% of its datacenters.\nWe note that dependence on renewable resources to cut down on operating costs is just another way to be more competitive and profitable and Microsoft’s decision to do so augurs well for the company in the long run.\nZacks Rank & Key Picks \nAt present, Microsoft has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\nA better-ranked stock in the broader technology space is Konami Holdings Corporation ( KNMCY - Free Report ) , sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here . \nNotably, the consensus estimate for Konami Holdings’ current year improved to $1.59 from $1.39 over the last 30 days.\nConfidential from Zacks \nBeyond this Analyst Blog, would you like to see Zacks' best recommendations that are not available to the public?

      "text": "The SHA-1 hash algorithm is no longer secure. Weaknesses in SHA-1 could allow an attacker to spoof content, execute phishing attacks, or perform man-in-the-middle attacks when browsing the web. Microsoft, in collaboration with other members of the industry, is working to phase out SHA-1. We have outlined our timeline for SHA-1 deprecation in earlier posts, most recently in April . This post is to clarify some of our most commonly asked questions, and to help you test ahead of time.\nStarting on February 14 th , 2017 , Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer 11 will prevent sites that are protected with a SHA-1 certificate from loading and will display an invalid certificate warning. Though we strongly discourage it, users will have the option to ignore the error and continue to the website.\nThis will only impact SHA-1 certificates that chain to a Microsoft Trusted Root CA . Manually-installed enterprise or self-signed SHA-1 certificates will not be impacted, although we recommend for all customers to quickly migrate to SHA-256.\nAdditional information on Microsoft’s overall SHA-1 deprecation plans can be found on TechNet .\nMicrosoft Edge will display an invalid certificate warning when browsing to a site protected with a SHA-1 certificate\nFrequently asked questions How can I test if my site will be impacted? By installing the latest November 2016 Windows Updates, including the November 2016 Preview of Monthly Quality Rollups for Windows 7/Windows 8.1, you can test how your site will be impacted by the February 2017 update. Please note that the Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 updates are currently offered as Optional Updates on Windows Update, and are expected to be promoted to Recommended Updates on December 13 th , 2017. You can test by running the following commands from an Administrator Command Prompt:\nFirst, create a logging directory and grant universal access:\nset LogDir=C:\\Log mkdir %LogDir% icacls %LogDir% /grant *S-1-15-2-1:(OI)(CI)(F) icacls %LogDir% /grant *S-1-1-0:(OI)(CI)(F) icacls %LogDir% /grant *S-1-5-12:(OI)(CI)(F) icacls %LogDir% /setintegritylevel L\nNext, e nable certificate logging and SHA-1 blocking:\nCertutil -setreg chain\\WeakSignatureLogDir %LogDir% Certutil -setreg chain\\WeakSha1ThirdPartyFlags 0x80040004\nImportant: Use the following commands to remove the settings after you have completed your testing.\nCertutil -delreg chain\\WeakSha1ThirdPartyFlags Certutil -delreg chain\\WeakSignatureLogDir\nHow will other Windows applications and older versions of Internet Explorer be impacted? Third party Windows applications that use the Windows cryptographic API set and older versions of Internet Explorer will not be impacted by the February 2017 changes by-default.\nHow will SHA-1 client authentication certificates be impacted? The February 2017 update will not prevent a client using a SHA-1 signed certificate from being used in client authentication.\nWhat about cross-signed certificates? Windows will only check if the thumbprint of the root certificate is in the Microsoft Trusted Root Certificate Program . A certificate cross-signed with a Microsoft Trusted Root that chains to an enterprise/self-signed root would not be impacted by the changes planned for February 2017.\n― Alec Oot, Senior Program Manager\n― Jody Cloutier, Senior Program Manager\n ",

      "text": "Microsoft previews SQL Server on Linux, opens features across editions by Jack Vaughan Senior News Writer Microsoft looks to broaden the horizons of SQL Server, as it moves some Enterprise features to Standard Edition and introduces SQL Server on Linux. This Article Covers Share this item with your network: Related Content E-Guide: Expert tips for evaluating an upgrade to SQL Server 2008 R2 –Dell, Inc. and Intel \nMicrosoft this week made SQL Server 2016 Service Pack 1 generally available, and released an initial public preview of SQL Server running on Linux. Both moves are intended to promote wider use of the flagship database, as well as its more recent feature additions. \nThe programmer updates mean that several advanced features previously limited to solely the top-of-the-line SQL Server Enterprise Edition are now supported in some form on SQL Server Standard Edition. Even SQL Server Express developers can get in on the action, as the wider programming model encompasses that platform, too. \nMeanwhile, support for SQL Server on Linux moves the database onto an operating system commonly found in the modern enterprise, opening a whole new field for deployment. \nAmong the features now supported across Enterprise, Standard and Express versions of the software are data warehouse partitioning and data compression , as well as ''Always Encrypted'' row-level security and data masking . \nAll kinds of development shops have grappled with the problem of maintaining different Enterprise and Standard versions of their software, and sometimes spotty use of compression and encryption features. However, the effects have been especially felt among independent software vendors (ISVs), according to Mike Walsh, founder and owner of StraightPath IT Solutions, a SQL Server consultancy and managed service provider. \n\"A lot of vendors were using compression, but their customers had to buy SQL Enterprise to use that feature,\" he said. \"ISVs had to have two versions of their software to deal with it.\" But it is not just ISVs that felt the problem, he said. \nThe split in SQL Server affected users, too -- ones who might have not needed the Enterprise Edition's high scalability but had to buy it to get features like row-level encryption, an important factor for compliance, he said. Walsh is also a Microsoft SQL Server MVP and blogger . Read the small print \nThere are caveats. Not included across Standard and Express are master data services and data quality services that Microsoft has brought to SQL Server Enterprise. \nIt is true that with a common development model across editions, programmers can work with a wider set of SQL Server features. But jobs that need highly scaled processing will still remain the province of SQL Server Enterprise. \nDevelopers can program in-database analytics with R, in-memory OLTP and column store data warehousing jobs -- all highly touted features of SQL Server 2016 -- but the maximum number of processor cores supported are four and 24 for Express and Standard, respectively. Meanwhile, SQL Server Enterprise edition supports an unlimited number of processor cores. \nFor Mike Walsh and others, however, the support for a common programming model is an important step forward. \n\"Companies have begun doing column stores and OLTP in memory, and I think adoption will grow. These features allow better data retrieval and analytics,\" he said. \"But I am actually more excited about the broader use of immediately practical features like encryption and table partitioning, no matter how many cores are used.\" Driving new apps on SQL Server \nMicrosoft efforts ease use of advanced features, according to Scott Guthrie, executive vice president, and will remove obstacles that developers now face. Guthrie described the SQL Server enhancements, and a wide array of other product initiatives at Microsoft's Connect(); 2016 developers conference in New York. \n\"Cool programming model features like in-memory database analytics support as well as Always Encrypted support, have only been available with the enterprise editions of SQL Server,\" Guthrie said. \"This has been a barrier for developers and ISVs because it requires always having the most expensive version of SQL [Server].” \nAmong new initiatives Guthrie discussed were Docker support for SQL Server, general availability of Azure Data Lake Analytics and Store and a preview of Visual Studio for Mac, the latter a clear sign the company is working to fulfill promises for greater openness. SQL on Linux a nod to openness \nBut the biggest nod to openness may be the Linux port. At the conference, Microsoft issued the first public preview of its long-awaited SQL Server on Linux offering, which will be part of the next release of the database. \n\"We think it will enable a whole new opportunity to drive new data applications on SQL [Server],\" Guthrie said. \nSQL Server's entry into Linux opens the database to use in areas Microsoft previously ceded to other players, according to Merv Adrian, a Gartner analyst. \n\"For users who will not use Windows, for whatever reason, SQL Server is a credible and capable option,\" he said. \"And for those using both environments it provides an opportunity to leverage existing skills and enhance portability.\" \nFor StraightPath's Walsh, SQL Server on Linux is an affordable, feature-rich alternative to other offerings -- and proof that Microsoft is ready to adjust to meet wider user needs. \n\"These moves show that when Microsoft says they will meet you where you are, they mean it,\" said Walsh.
