      "text": "Twitter adds new options to curb abuse, harassment By BARBARA ORTUTAYAP Technology Writer \nNEW YORK (AP) - Twitter, long criticized as a hotbed for online harassment, is expanding ways to curb the amount of abuse users see and making it easier to report such conduct. \nTwitter said Tuesday that it is expanding a \"mute\" function that lets people mute accounts they don't want to see tweets from. Now, users will be able to mute keywords, phrases and conversations they don't want to get notifications about. Users who decide to mute things won't see them. \nThe words, phrases and conversations will continue to exist on Twitter, and anyone who doesn't mute them will continue to see them. But the company is also making it easier to report hateful conduct, and said it has re-trained its support teams about its policies and hateful conduct. \nAbuse can easily spread on Twitter due to its public, real-time nature, where tweets are easily amplified by retweets and users can easily and openly attack others. While Twitter prohibits \"specific conduct that targets people on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability, or disease,\" this policy has not been enough to stomp out abuse. \nNot even celebrities are immune. Over the summer, \"Ghostbusters\" star Leslie Jones publicly abandoned Twitter after becoming the target of sexist and racist abuse on the service. She has since returned. \nTwitter has been trying to get a handle on its Wild West reputation as a haven for online harassment and abuse while still holding onto its commitment to free speech. It's been tricky, to say the least. \n\"We don't expect these announcements to suddenly remove abusive conduct from Twitter,\" Twitter Inc. said in a blog post . \"No single action by us would do that. Instead we commit to rapidly improving Twitter based on everything we observe and learn.\"  ",

      "text": "Twitter took another step Tuesday in its long fight against trolls, announcing that it will give users a mute feature to weed out harassing words and phrases from their notifications.\nThe company plans to roll out the feature more broadly over time, Del Harvey, Twitter's vice president of trust and safety, said in an interview with The Washington Post. Adding it to notifications was a priority based on the feedback from Twitter users.\n\"We've heard from users that this [notifications] is an area where people don't feel as though they have as much control on Twitter,\" Harvey said. \"You're not searching for this content, but it's still something that's coming in to your Twitter experience.\"\nWith the new feature, Twitter users will be able to compile their own list of words, phrases and emoji that they don't want to see pop up in their notifications from the network.\nThe feature is similar to one Instagram rolled out earlier this year that let users block comments that contained certain phrases. Twitter's move comes after an election cycle that saw, among other incidents, a prominent anti-Semitic movement on the network - it has been repeatedly criticized for not moving quickly enough to combat harassment on its site.\nHarvey, who has been at Twitter for eight years, said she knows that some users are frustrated with the pace at which it's addressing harassment issues. \"We haven't always moved as quickly as we would like or done as much as we would like,\" she said, adding that the company is trying to make sure that it has tools to shut down harassment on the site without crossing the line into limiting speech. \"We have tried to be thoughtful, to make sure we don't have unintended and negative consequences,\" Harvey said.\nTwitter has struggled for years with striking the right balance between protecting open expression on the network and protecting victims of harassment, often fielding heavy criticism for erring too far on the side of free speech. Harvey acknowledged that there were plenty of prime examples of Twitter's shortcomings when it came to policing harassment on the network during this year's election.\nThe addition of the mute feature wasn't driven by the dialogue around the election itself, Harvey said, but it did underscore for Twitter how much further it still has to go. Harvey said that Twitter has also made some changes to the way that users can report harassment on the site to better reflect its policies.\nLast year, Twitter explicitly banned \"hateful conduct\" - which prohibits the promotion of violence and direct attacks or threats to others on the basis of race, ethnicity and a number of other attributes. The social network has now updated the language it uses in its harassment reporting tool to reflect that policy and inform users that they can report others for that kind of behavior. Twitter has also made it easier for bystanders to report abuse - so person B can report that person C is harassing person A.\nFinally, Harvey said, Twitter is continually training its staff across the globe to recognize more forms of abuse. Twitter staff members review each report of abuse to determine whether it violates the company's policies. It's common to see Twitter users posting incredulous screenshots of notices from Twitter's abuse team rejecting abuse reports, even when they clearly violate Twitter's rules.\nThose oversights are upsetting, she acknowledged, and often happen because a reviewer doesn't have the cultural context to understand why something may be offensive or abusive. Something that's obviously offensive to an American may not be so obvious to a person born in India, and vice versa, she explained.\nSo, in addition to an ongoing training course on how to recognize abusive behavior, Harvey said, Twitter has put together a training program on the historical and cultural context around particular types of harassment - types of anti-Semitism, for example. She said Twitter will also focus more closely on keeping its staff up to date with the evolving language of hate on its network.",

Twitter, long criticized as a hotbed for online harassment, is expanding ways to curb the amount of abuse users see and making it easier to report such conduct. (AP Photo/Richard Drew, File) Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY (1) New York • Twitter, long criticized as a hotbed for online harassment, is expanding ways to curb the amount of abuse users see and making it easier to report such conduct. Twitter said Tuesday that it is expanding a \"mute\" function that lets people mute accounts they don't want to see tweets from. Now, users will be able to mute keywords, phrases and conversations they don't want to get notifications about. Users who decide to mute things won't see them. The words, phrases and conversations will continue to exist on Twitter, and anyone who doesn't mute them will continue to see them. But the company is also making it easier to report hateful conduct, and said it has re-trained its support teams about its policies and hateful conduct. VIDEOS TOP JOBS Abuse can easily spread on Twitter due to its public, real-time nature, where tweets are easily amplified by retweets and users can easily and openly attack others. While Twitter prohibits \"specific conduct that targets people on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability, or disease,\" this policy has not been enough to stomp out abuse. Not even celebrities are immune. Over the summer, \"Ghostbusters\" star Leslie Jones publicly abandoned Twitter after becoming the target of sexist and racist abuse on the service. She has since returned. Twitter has been trying to get a handle on its Wild West reputation as a haven for online harassment and abuse while still holding onto its commitment to free speech. It's been tricky, to say the least. \"We don't expect these announcements to suddenly remove abusive conduct from Twitter,\" Twitter Inc. said in a blog post . \"No single action by us would do that. Instead we commit to rapidly improving Twitter based on everything we observe and learn.\"",

      "text": "FBI using Twitter's raw 'firehose' data to monitor users Published: November 15, 2016 Source: Engadget \nThe FBI is using a Twitter tool called Dataminr to track criminals and terrorist groups, according to documents spotted by The Verge . In a contract document, the agency says Dataminr's Advanced Alerting Tool allows it \"to search the complete Twitter firehose, in near real-time, using customizable filters.\" However, the practice seems to violate Twitter's developer agreement, which prohibits the use of its data feed for surveillance or spying purposes. \nIt's not clear if Twitter has authorized the bureau to access Dataminr, but Engadget has reached out for comment. It cut off another company, Geofeedia , for using its raw feed to track users in a similar way. However, Twitter has a closer relationship with Dataminr; it owns five percent of the firm and has given it a virtual monopoly on its data feed. As the FBI points out in a \"limited source justification\" document, \"Dataminr is the only certified Official Twitter Data Partner with direct proprietary access to the full 'Twitter firehose' which allows it to provide near real-time alerts of breaking news and events.\" \nUS intelligence owns a venture capital firm called In-Q-Tel that invested in Dataminr and other social media analytics firms. Twitter reportedly authorized a pilot program that let the CIA and other agencies scan users, but cut access off after it ended. Like Apple, Google and other US tech companies, it wanted to avoid being associated with spying on both foreign and domestic users, according to the WSJ . \nDataminr is the only certified Official Twitter Data Partner with direct proprietary access to the full 'Twitter firehose' which allows it to provide near real-time alerts of breaking news and events. \nDuring his campaign, President-elect Donald Trump promised to force social media companies to give law enforcement the encryption keys needed to access to private user data. US tech companies, especially Apple, have argued vociferously against that, saying it would undermine confidence in their platforms. Foreign regions like Europe are especially sensitive to US spying after discovering that the NSA used server back doors and other tricks to spy on its citizens ( and leaders ).",

      "title": "Twitter Adds New ‘Mute Words’ Tool, New Processes to Combat On-Platform Abuse",
      "text": "November 15, 2016 Andrew Hutchinson \nOne of Twitter’s five key pillars of focus in their reinvigoration plan, as outlined by CEO Jack Dorsey , is to ‘ensure users feel safe to express themselves’. As has been well-documented, tackling on-platform abuse and harassment has been a major challenge for the platform, and has been brought into the spotlight repeatedly by high profile incidents , underlining Twitter’s failings in this regard. The problem has become such a concern that when Twitter recently went through the process of meeting with potential buyers of the company, several reportedly withdrew their interest because of concerns about Twitter’s troll problem. \nAnd the problem, of course, is far bigger than monetary and reputational concerns - suicide remains the second leading cause of death for people aged between 10 and 24 in the U.S, an age bracket that incorporates Twitter’s primary audience demographic . When we’re talking about trolls and abuse, it’s not just those high-profile cases we need to address. It’s an issue we all need to approach with the highest concern. \nAs such, Twitter’s working to provide more options. They introduced a new ‘ Quality Filter ’ tool back in August, which uses an AI-powered algorithm to detect and eliminate questionable tweets from your timeline, including threats and offensive or abusive language, as well as new way to filter your notifications . \nAnd today, Twitter’s taking the next steps towards combating abuse, highlighted by a new, expanded mute feature which enables users to block out any words, phrases, hashtags, @handles and emojis that they don’t want to see. Want to stop getting notifications for Tweets that contain certain words, usernames, or hashtags? We're giving you that control. pic.twitter.com/awoNHUYbTG — Safety (@safety) November 15, 2016 \nAs explained by Twitter : \n“Twitter has long had a feature called “mute” which enables you to mute accounts you don’t want to see Tweets from. Now we’re expanding mute to where people need it the most: in notifications . We’re enabling you to mute keywords, phrases, and even entire conversations you don’t want to see notifications about, rolling out to everyone in the coming days. This is a feature we’ve heard many of you ask for, and we’re going to keep listening to make it better and more comprehensive over time.” \nInstagram released a similar tool back in September, enabling users to filter their comment streams of abusive remarks, or even – as highlighted by Taylor Swift – emoji. \nAnd as we noted then , it’s not a perfect solution – it doesn’t stop such abuse from happening and users can get around it by changing the spelling or using different tactics (you can see in the Taylor Swift example above that the snake emoji has been muted, but the words ‘cobra’ and ‘ekans’ are still present), but it is a model that’s shown promise elsewhere. Facebook introduced similar keyword blocking back in 2011 . \nInitial reports of Twitter working on a ‘mute words’ option filtered out late last month when it was accidentally made available to some users ahead of time. \nBut Twitter's also taking this a step further - in addition to keyword blocking, Twitter’s also adding a new option which will enable users to mute entire conversations . \nThe tool will enable users to stop receiving notifications from a specific Twitter thread without removing the thread from their timeline or blocking anyone. Users will be able to mute any conversations in which they’re included (where their @handle is mentioned). \nThe options will provide users with more ways to filter and customize their Twitter experience, and indeed, to feel safer. But as noted, it’s not a solution, as such. Those abusive comments will still exist, even if hidden from view. \nTo combat the issue on a deeper level, Twitter's also added a new ‘ hateful conduct ’ reporting option. Now, when users go to report a tweet, they’ll see a new 'directs hate' option to denote why the tweet in question is harmful. \nTwitter's also retraining its support teams, with special sessions on ‘cultural and historical contextualization of hateful conduct’, and is implementing an ongoing refresher program to ensure those lessons stay up to date – this is especially important as such language and terms are always evolving. \n“We’ve also improved our internal tools and systems in order to deal more effectively with this conduct when it’s reported to us. Our goal is a faster and more transparent process.” \nTackling online abuse is a major challenge, and one all platforms need to address. As noted, the impacts of such actions can be devastating, and it’s important that victims feel that they’re not alone, that they can seek support and subsequent action, and on this front, Twitter’s new tools are a step in the right direction. They don’t eliminate abuse, but that may be impossible. With these steps, Twitter’s showing that it is taking the issue very seriously, and that it's working to build a more inclusive, safe space for their users. \nIn future, there may be other solutions – some have suggested that Twitter could reduce abuse by removing anonymity from the platform, while advances in AI may also make it a possible option to detect and eliminate such content before it’s even seen. But one thing that has become very clear in recent times is that there are many people with vastly different opinions and viewpoints in the world, and as such we’re never going to all agree and get along. We can hope that we’re able to advance such conversations and use the connectivity of social networks to gain more understanding and perspective, but we also need to accept that conflicts will always be present - and as such, we all need to do all we can to speak up when we see people crossing the line and help out when we see others in need. \nThe platforms themselves will continue to evolve and advance their tools and options on this front, but we, as users, can also help by flagging and reporting such incidents.

      "text": "Twitter adds new options to curb abuse, harassment   3:30 PM BARBARA ORTUTAY, AP Technology Writer \nNEW YORK (AP) — Twitter, long criticized as a hotbed for online harassment, is expanding ways to curb the amount of abuse users see and making it easier to report such conduct. \nTwitter said Tuesday that it is expanding a \"mute\" function that lets people mute accounts they don't want to see tweets from. Now, users will be able to mute keywords, phrases and conversations they don't want to get notifications about. Users who decide to mute things won't see them. \nThe words, phrases and conversations will continue to exist on Twitter, and anyone who doesn't mute them will continue to see them. But the company is also making it easier to report hateful conduct, and said it has re-trained its support teams about its policies and hateful conduct. \nAbuse can easily spread on Twitter due to its public, real-time nature, where tweets are easily amplified by retweets and users can easily and openly attack others. While Twitter prohibits \"specific conduct that targets people on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability, or disease,\" this policy has not been enough to stomp out abuse. \nNot even celebrities are immune. Over the summer, \"Ghostbusters\" star Leslie Jones publicly abandoned Twitter after becoming the target of sexist and racist abuse on the service. She has since returned. \nTwitter has been trying to get a handle on its Wild West reputation as a haven for online harassment and abuse while still holding onto its commitment to free speech. It's been tricky, to say the least. \n\"We don't expect these announcements to suddenly remove abusive conduct from Twitter,\" Twitter Inc. said in a blog post . \"No single action by us would do that. Instead we commit to rapidly improving Twitter based on everything we observe and learn.\" About Us",

Twitter finds new ways to put hate speech on mute 0 Share: \nTwitter is expanding its mute function. Photo by James Martin/CNET \nTwitter thrives on being one of the fastest ways to see what people are talking about. But its real-time stream of news and opinion also channels abuse and hate speech , which in turn drives people off the platform altogether . \nThe company has long recognized the problem, but it has been slow to figure out a way to fix things. Twitter said as much in a blog post Tuesday: \"The amount of abuse, bullying, and harassment we've seen across the Internet has risen sharply over the past few years. These behaviors inhibit people from participating on Twitter, or anywhere.\" \nAs part of a longer-term change, Twitter is expanding its mute function. Until now the feature's been used for keeping individual Twitter users out of your stream -- which isn't that helpful if you're being harassed by multiple users or by people who create new accounts every time they're muted or suspended. \nNow, the feature can be used to mute notifications, based on keywords, phrases and entire conversations. The changes will roll out in the coming days, Twitter said. \nThe company also said it has retrained internal support teams, which are responsible for enforcing Twitter's code of conduct and investigating reports of violations. In addition, it said it is giving users a more direct way to report hateful conduct. \nThe change toward curbing abusive behavior comes about four months after the social media platform responded to complaints by actress-comedian Leslie Jones , who briefly left Twitter after her tweetstorm about being a victim of sexist and racist abuse. \nIt led to CEO Jack Dorsey reaching out to her, and Twitter subsequently permanently suspending the account of British journalist and Breitbart editor Milo Yiannopoulos , one of the principals accused of launching the abuse campaign against Jones. \nEven US President-elect Donald Trump has used Twitter to disparage campaign rivals and others. Last month he went on an epic tweetstorm targeting Hillary Clinton and former Miss Universe Alicia Machado. \n\"No one deserves to be the target of abuse on Twitter,\" Dorsey told investors in July. \"We haven't been good enough at ensuring that's the case, and we need to do better.\" \nHe's also remained steadfast that Twitter isn't about censoring speech. \n\"We are not, and never will be, a platform that shows people only part of what's happening,\" he said. \"Abuse is not civil discourse.\" \nDespite previous features designed to make it easier for users to report and minimize abuse, Twitter acknowledged Tuesday it still has a long way to go. \"We don't expect these announcements to suddenly remove abusive conduct from Twitter.\" \nOriginally published November 15, 7:02 a.m. PT. \nUpdate, 1:28 p.m. PT: Adds background information.",

      "text": "Twitter users—and Twitter as a company—have grappled with ways to deal with hateful, bigoted, and harassing speech throughout the platform's lifetime. The service has added a few tools to try to keep things in check, but one PhD student at NYU's school of politics set out to see whether social checks and balances could reduce the platform's most abhorrent speech.\nThe results, published in the November edition of Political Behavior , concluded that direct, negative responses to racist tweets could have an impact—but, at least in this test's case, they were far more effective when they appeared to come from white users.\nNYU student Kevin Munger began his experiment by identifying 231 Twitter accounts with a propensity for using the n-word in a targeted manner (meaning, the message included the \"@\" symbol and used second-person language). All of these accounts were at least six months old and had used the n-word in at least three percent of their posts during the period Munger monitored them (late summer last year).\nHe created fake Twitter accounts to target each of these users with a simple phrase, always in response to an apparently harassing use of the n-word: \"@[subject] Hey man, just remember that there are real people who are hurt when you harass them with that kind of language.\"\nEnlarge / Munger's flowchart of criteria for whether a Twitter account was racist enough for his study. Munger's fake accounts were puffed up with varying numbers of followers, which he purchased through a fake follower-bot service, and they were identified by names traditionally associated with white or black people, along with a cartoon avatar of a white or black man to match. Munger wanted to test a few things: whether the admonishing account's race or follower count would draw a different response, and whether a user's anonymity would influence their behavior. (Anonymity was scored based on whether a Twitter account had no real name, photo, or identifying information in either its profile or its posts.)\nMunger's data shows that a rebuke from an apparent white user with a high follower count had the most impact, and this impact carried more weight with the most anonymous Twitter users. In these cases, future posts containing the n-word dropped by roughly 27 percent compared to a control group in the following week. That drop-off leveled out somewhat in two-week and one-month follow-ups, but it remained. (As Munger puts it, \"the 50 subjects in the most effective treatment condition tweeted the word 'nigger' an estimated 186 fewer times in the month after treatment.\")\nHowever, apparent white users with low follower counts, as well as any apparent black users, showed no measurable impact. Non-anonymous users were less convinced as well—and were more likely to post a negative response to the bot. Munger scanned affected users' activity over the same two-month time span to see if \"substitution\" had occurred in the form of misogynistic language, and he concluded that such a shift did not occur.\nFurther Reading Salesforce CEO has “walked away” from deal with beleaguered Twitter The study's scope is certainly limited in that it focuses primarily on anti-black speech, as opposed to other bigoted behavior. Munger notes that the subjects who qualified for this study, \"most commonly manifested\" as followers of either the GamerGate hashtag or the Donald Trump presidential campaign. These campaigns, he points out, tend to engage in more anti-female and anti-immigrant speech on social media. Munger also doesn't spell out exactly how many fake accounts he created in all. Two of his accounts, GregJackson730 and RasheedSmith45 , remain online, but their tweets have been protected, so we can't check whether those accounts' posts were stacked in such a way that a recipient could click the account and see a glut of the same admonishing reply to other users.\n\"Although this study’s evidence of a method to reduce the expression of prejudice online is valuable in and of itself, the question remains as to whether this effect changes underlying prejudiced attitudes or behavior in the physical world,\" Munger writes.\nMore mutes Tuesday also saw Twitter announce an upcoming rollout of new \"muting\" abilities for all users. This will appear on the social network's \"notifications\" tab and will allow users to automatically block single keywords and complete phrases from appearing there. More importantly for how Twitter works, however, is the \"mute conversation\" feature, which will let users opt out of sprawling, reply-filled conversation that they never wanted to be a part of in the first place.\nThe announcement also included a promise that users will soon get \"a more direct way to report... hateful conduct\" on the site. Whether the reports will be acted on is a separate question, considering that Twitter has already made such announcements repeatedly in the past few years. To the company's credit, Tuesday's announcement acknowledges that a single proclamation isn't the end-all of the process. \"We don’t expect these announcements to suddenly remove abusive conduct from Twitter,\" the company said. \"No single action by us would do that. Instead we commit to rapidly improving Twitter based on everything we observe and learn.\"\nPolitical Behavior , 2016. DOI: 10.1007/s11109-016-9373-5 ( About DOIs ).",

      "text": "Twitter releases new tools to report, mute online harassment We may need this now more than ever share After years of people complaining about the the company’s response to harassment and abuse on its platform, Twitter is rolling out new methods to try and curb hateful activity. Twitter announced today on its blog that it’s updating the service’s mute function, giving users the opportunity to mute entire threads and filter what they see in their notifications. According to a blog post on its website, users will be able to \"mute notifications for Tweets [they are] mentioned in that contain particular words, phrases, usernames, emojis or hashtags.\" In doing so, these tweets will be removed from all notifications, including email and text notifications. In its updated guidelines for muting certain accounts , terms or hashtags, Twitter has created a more thorough filtering tool for people to use. The company has also made it possible to mute entire conversations and threads that they’re a part of. For example, if two or three people are having a conversation and loop you in by including your handle, you can choose to mute the entire conversation. Although they won’t be notified about any direct responses under their notifications tab, the tweets will still appear in their timeline if they follow others included in the conversation. Must Read Leslie Jones' Twitter attack \nImplementing these new measures is a method of filtering, but it’s not an actual moderating tool. On this specific front, Twitter isn’t doing anything to change the way people use its platform, but is simply allowing users to alter how they interact with it. Those tweets are still being sent — and can still be found — but it’s up to the person on the receiving end of it to do something. Instead of targeting those responsible for sending out hateful and abusive tweets to people, Twitter is trying to rebuild a crumbling wall as fast as it can to offer some kind of defense. Twitter’s ongoing issue is that the abusers have found ways to break down or get around those walls before, and it’s only a matter of time before they do it again. \nBy not making the abuse people are subjected to on its platform a higher priority, Twitter, much more than Facebook, is complicit in enabling harassers — and it’s something that CEO Jack Dorsey has admitted. In a call with investors this summer, Dorsey said that they weren’t doing enough to make the user experience a more enjoyable, and more importantly, a safer one for those that are targeted most often — women, minorities and queer folk. \"No one deserves to be the target of abuse on Twitter,\" Dorsey said, as reported by The Verge . \"We haven’t been good enough at ensuring that’s the case, and we need to do better.\" That’s where Twitter’s second updated strategy for tackling hateful activity comes in. Along with the upgraded muting system, the company also announced that it was adding a \"Hateful Conduct\" reporting tool that will allow any user to flag a tweet and bring it to the attention of the support team. \n\"We don’t expect these announcements to suddenly remove abusive conduct from Twitter\" So how, exactly, is this different from what Twitter has been doing before? There’s really one one notable difference between the previous \"Report Abuse\" page and the new \"Report Hateful Conduct\" page and that’s the inclusion of this specific issue: \"It directs hate against a race, religion, gender, or orientation.\" A Pew study from 2014 found that 40 percent of all online users endure some kind of harassment, with women between the ages of 18 and 24 twice as likely to have suffered from some kind of sexual harassment. In January 2015, Feminist Frequency founder Anita Sarkeesian collected a weeks worth of tweets that were directed at her because of her Tropes vs Women in Video Games series. Sarkeesian said that since she began the project, a full two-and-a-half years before posting the collection of tweets, she had been harassed on a daily basis by \"irate gamers.\" \"It can sometimes be difficult to effectively communicate just how bad this sustained intimidation campaign really is,\" Sarkeesian wrote. \"So I’ve taken the liberty of collecting a week’s worth of hateful messages sent to me on Twitter.\" According to a study from Newsweek in 2014 , between the period of Sept. 1 and Oct. 23, people sent a total of 10,400 tweets to developer Zoe Quinn in relation to GamerGate. Those in support of GamerGate, which they infamously declared was about \"ethics in games journalism,\" made allegations that Quinn’s relationship with Kotaku reporter Nathan Grayson led to ethical questions over coverage of Quinn’s game, Depression Quest . In the same period of time, however, Grayson only received 732 tweets related to GamerGate. \n\"No one deserves to be the target of abuse on Twitter\" Critics have called out Twitter time and again for its inability to curb abuse that people receive on its platform, but it wasn’t until this past summer when actress and comedian Leslie Jones’ Twitter account was spammed with racist, sexist and degrading tweets that the company did anything about it. CEO Jack Dorsey personally intervened and spoke to Jones about the incident, leading to Twitter’s banning of controversial Breitbart columnist, Milo Yiannopoulos — a crusading figure in the GamerGate movement, who was deemed partially responsible for the attack on Jones. Twitter’s addition of its \"Report Hateful Conduct\" tool indicates that the company is finally listening to complaints and willing to try to do more, but it didn’t announce if it was going to be bringing on more people to work in its support division. The company did reiterate that it was going to retrain every support team member on how to keep an eye out for abusive users and hateful tweets, adding that it would be implementing new internal tools to help its team respond to requests faster. Despite that, Twitter said this is going to be an ongoing battle that it can’t solve on its own. \"We don’t expect these announcements to suddenly remove abusive conduct from Twitter,\" the post reads. \"No single action by us would do that.\" Twitter’s new anti-harassment tools will be rolling out today. Twitter has detailed step-by-step guides on how to mute or report abusive behavior . The company is asking those who see harassment happening to report it immediately. More From Polygon",

      "text": "LOS ANGELES — Twitter is finally taking more aggressive steps to address one of its biggest pain points — introducing new tools to curb hateful and abusive attacks on the service — although it remains to be seen if the efforts will help the social-media player jump-start growth in its user base.\nOver the past few years, the “amount of abuse, bullying, and harassment we’ve seen across the Internet has risen sharply over the past few years,” Twitter said in a blog post Tuesday. “Because Twitter happens in public and in real-time, we’ve had some challenges keeping up with and curbing abusive conduct.”\nNow Twitter says it has moved to thwart trolls in three ways: It’s letting users “mute” notifications based on keywords, phrases, and entire conversations; it is making it easier to report abusive users by specifically flagging hateful conduct; and the company says it has retrained its support team to identify hateful conduct on Twitter.\nHowever, Twitter said, it doesn’t expect the steps will “suddenly remove abusive conduct” from the service. “No single action by us would do that. Instead we commit to rapidly improving Twitter based on everything we observe and learn,” the company said.\nThe steps come after Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey this summer acknowledged that the company’s efforts in cracking down on hateful and abusive attacks on the social service haven’t gone far enough. “No one deserves to be the target of abuse on Twitter,” he said on the company’s quarterly call in July. “We haven’t been good enough at ensuring that’s the case, and we need to do better.”\nFor Twitter, one of the highest-profile examples of abusive behavior occurred earlier this year, when actress Leslie Jones (of “Saturday Night Live” and “Ghostbusters”) was targeted with numerous racist comments on Twitter — prompting her to leave the service. Twitter subsequently banned conservative columnist Milo Yiannopoulos and other accounts over the attacks, after which Jones resumed tweeting.\nTwitter has previously provided the “mute” feature, which lets users filter out tweets from specific accounts. Now, Twitter users will be able to screen out notifications for undesirable tweets based on keywords, phrases, and conversations; the company said it will roll the feature out to all users over the next few days.\nIn addition, Twitter said it is giving users a more direct way to report hateful conduct — not only for tweets directed at their own accounts, but for any posts on the service. That will help “reduce the burden on the person experiencing the abuse, and helps to strengthen a culture of collective support on Twitter,” the company said.\nThe company also said it has retrained all support teams on its hate-speech policies, including hosting special sessions on “cultural and historical contextualization of hateful conduct.” Twitter’s terms of use prohibit posts that target people on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability, or disease.\n“We honor our role in protecting your right to speak freely, and our collective responsibility to human dignity,” Twitter said in its blog post Tuesday.\nMaking Twitter a safer place should help boost its number of active users and increase engagement on the service. Its user growth has remained stuck in low gear, especially compared with gains by Facebook: Twitter tallied 317 million monthly active users worldwide for the third quarter of 2016, up only 3 percent year-over-year.\nGovernment finalizes rules...",

      "text": "Still struggling to rein in user harassment, Twitter is giving its “mute” button greater powers.\n“We’re enabling you to mute keywords, phrases, and even entire conversations you don’t want to see notifications about,” the social giant notes in a new blog post.\nSet to roll out in the coming days, Twitter said many users have been calling for just such a feature, though the company is well aware of its “hate” problem.\n“The amount of abuse, bullying, and harassment we’ve seen across the Internet has risen sharply over the past few years,” according to the company.\nTwitter is also giving users a more direct way to report abuse, whether it’s being directed to them or others. On enforcement, the company said it recently retrained all of our support teams, including special sessions on cultural and historical contextualization of hateful conduct, and implemented an ongoing refresher program.\nTwitter also recently improved its internal tools and systems in order to deal more effectively with reported abuse.\nThe company’s co-called “hateful conduct policy” prohibits specific conduct that targets people on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability or disease.\nDespite efforts to curb their activity, trolls have scared away some of Twitter’s most influential users.\nEarlier this summer, New York Times editor Jon Weisman gave up on the network, given its failure to stem the tide of anti-Semitism being tweeted in his direction.\nMore recently, Twitter permanently suspended the account of conservative commentator Milo Yiannopoulos -- but not before he directed a number of racist and demeaning tweets in the direction of “Saturday Night Live” star Leslie Jones.\nTrying to avoid similar problems, Instagram has taken several steps to discourage user harassment.\nMicrosoft also began refining some of its processes to make it easier for customers to report hate speech. As part of the effort, the Web giant launched a new dedicated Web form for reporting hate speech on its hosted consumer services.\nInternally, Twitter has been struggling to come up with a viable solution to its troll problem with years. \nLast year -- echoing earlier comments by then CEO Dick Costolo -- Vijaya Gadde, general counsel for Twitter, wrote in The Washington Post : “Even when we have recognized that harassment is taking place, our response times have been inexcusably slow and the substance of our responses too meager.”",

      "text": "Twitter adds new options to curb abuse, harassment By BARBARA ORTUTAYAP Technology Writer \nNEW YORK (AP) - Twitter, long criticized as a hotbed for online harassment, is expanding ways to curb the amount of abuse users see and making it easier to report such conduct. \nTwitter said Tuesday that it is expanding a \"mute\" function that lets people mute accounts they don't want to see tweets from. Now, users will be able to mute keywords, phrases and conversations they don't want to get notifications about. Users who decide to mute things won't see them. \nThe words, phrases and conversations will continue to exist on Twitter, and anyone who doesn't mute them will continue to see them. But the company is also making it easier to report hateful conduct, and said it has re-trained its support teams about its policies and hateful conduct. \nAbuse can easily spread on Twitter due to its public, real-time nature, where tweets are easily amplified by retweets and users can easily and openly attack others. While Twitter prohibits \"specific conduct that targets people on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability, or disease,\" this policy has not been enough to stomp out abuse. \nNot even celebrities are immune. Over the summer, \"Ghostbusters\" star Leslie Jones publicly abandoned Twitter after becoming the target of sexist and racist abuse on the service. She has since returned. \nTwitter has been trying to get a handle on its Wild West reputation as a haven for online harassment and abuse while still holding onto its commitment to free speech. It's been tricky, to say the least. \n\"We don't expect these announcements to suddenly remove abusive conduct from Twitter,\" Twitter Inc. said in a blog post . \"No single action by us would do that. Instead we commit to rapidly improving Twitter based on everything we observe and learn.\" Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

      "text": "Published November 15, 2016 Associated Press Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print This undated photo shows James Dale Ritchie, who shot and wounded an Anchorage, Alaska police officer over the weekend.  (Anchorage Police Department) \nANCHORAGE, Alaska –   The handgun used to wound an Anchorage police officer last weekend has been linked to five previously unsolved homicides this year in Alaska's largest city, police said Tuesday.\n\nLt. John McKinnon, head of the city police's homicide division, said the Colt Python .357 revolver was linked through ballistics to two double homicides and one other killing.\n\n\"It is just heartbreaking,\" Anchorage Police Chief Chris Tolley told reporters.\n\nThe gun was used by James Dale Ritchie, 40, early Saturday morning to ambush police officer Arn Salao, who was responding to a report that a man hadn't paid a cab fare.\n\nEven after he was shot repeatedly, Salao returned fire as he jumped out of his police cruiser. Sgt. Marc Patzke arrived at the same time and also shot at the suspect, Tolley said. Ritchie was killed in the exchange.\n\nMcKinnon said the guns had been used in the July 3 shootings deaths of Jason Netter and Brianna Foisy, whose bodies were found on a trail near downtown Anchorage; in the July 29 death of Treyveonkindell Thompson, who was found on an isolated street, and the Aug. 28 deaths of Bryant De Husson and Kevin Turner, who were both shot in the Valley of the Moon Park near downtown Anchorage.\n\nDetectives continue to look into Ritchie's past, and McKinnon asked the public to provide any information they could about him.\n\n\"He hadn't been on our radar for a while in Anchorage, so that's part of what they're trying to determine is, where he's been, who he'd lived with, what other contacts he had,\" said Anchorage District Attorney Clint Campion. \"He hasn't had any real police contact in the last decade in Alaska.\"\n\nCampion said the five homicide cases remain open because the link to the gun provides investigative leads that need to be pursued. He said Anchorage police would be working with various agencies in the state in the investigation.\n\nThe gun was not registered to Ritchie, police spokeswoman Jennifer Castro said.\n\n\"What I'd be looking at is to see what the evidence is and which way that points us,\" Campion said. \"I think the firearm is a significant lead in that direction, and there's other investigation that need to be done.\"\n\nTolley said actions of Salao and Patzke in returning fire at Ritchie were heroic and \"made sure that this individual will not hurt any one of you or any one of the citizens of Anchorage. I'm so very, very proud of them.\"\n\nSalao was hit at least four times in the lower part of his body, with bullets fracturing bones, ripping apart muscles and going through the intestine and lodging in his liver, Tolley said.\n\nHe underwent seven hours of surgery on Saturday. Tolley said the officer is recuperating at an Anchorage hospital, and has been moved out of the intensive care unit.\n\n\"The officer is a fighter,\" Tolley said, adding Salao is determined to live.\n\nSalao has been a patrol officer since joining the force in October 2011. Patzke has been with the force since November 2007.",

      "text": "Twitter aims to crack down on harassment and hate with new mute features Twitter aims to crack down on harassment and hate with new mute features Posted: Tags : Apps - Apps + We currently live in a world where it's extremely easy to come by hate, violence, and prejudice. Various events that have taken place throughout the world have caused for this, and lots of individuals take to social media sites like Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram to sound their distaste, hate, and displeasure with events and actions that take place. Twitter has been especially filled with nasty posts and activity, and it's been reason enough for a lot of people to leave the social network. The company is well aware of this, and as a result, Twitter has announced new tools that will soon be available that will allow you to have more filtering controls over what content you do and don't want to see. Prior to this announcement, they only real option you had for such actions was the ability to \"mute\" accounts of specific users if you didn't want to see their content when browsing the site or app. While this certainly is an effective tool to make use of if there's a certain account you'd rather not have to look at, it's a bit ineffective if there are general topics or trends you don't want to be subject to in your timeline. Thankfully, Twitter is resolving this issue with the new inclusion of tools that will allow you to have that same mute function with not only other user accounts, but words, hashtags, and emoji as well. The new mute tools are being released alongside Twitter's updated \"hateful conduct policy\" that will make it easier than ever to report harassment or hateful actions when you spot them on the social network. Twitter says that the new mute tools is \"a feature we've heard many of you ask for, and we're going to keep listening to make it better and more comprehensive over time.\" As for the new hateful conduct policy, Twitter said on their official blog that their support teams have recently gone through training on the new policies, \"including special sessions on cultural and historical contextualization of hateful conduct.\" Twitter has said that these new muting features will be making their way to users within the next few days, and although it isn't a particularly exciting feature, it's an important one that should make using the social network more enjoyable than ever.",

      "text": "Published November 15, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre 0 Email Print Reuters \nBy Todd Starnes \nSen. Bob Corker (R-TN) was hiking in the woods near his home in Chattanooga – enjoying the outdoors – minding his business – when he was accosted by a foul-mouthed anti-Donald Trump Biology professor.\nUniversity of the South professor David Haskell and several companions were hiking on Stringer’s Ridge when they came upon Sen. Corker (who happened to be traveling alone).\nClick here to join Todd’s American Dispatch: a must-read for Conservatives! \n“Professor Haskell began shouting at Senator Corker in a profanity-laced tirade while pointing a finger in his face and told the senator that he was embarrassed to live in a state where the citizens voted to overwhelming elect Donald Trump,” Corker spokesperson Micah Johnson said in statement.\nHaskell, who was a Pulitzer Price nonfiction finalist,  admitted in a blog post  that he had a potty-mouth, but denied he was overly aggressive.\n“I’m afraid my profanity was no match for that of Mr. Trump and I showed no aggression,” he wrote. “Anger, for sure, but I stood at a respectful distance and listened to Corker. First Amendment speech is not aggression, it’s a right. Grabbing women, punishing them for abortions, egging on rallies toward violence: now that’s aggression.”\nREAD THE FULL STORY AT TODDSTARNES.COM! \nRead the full story at ToddStarnes.com→",

But the 36-year-old quarterback has been hit hard by injuries the past few seasons. He played just four games last year, suffering multiple collarbone fractures as Dallas slipped to 4-12.\nThis year Romo appeared to be ready for a bounce-back season. The Cowboys used their fourth-overall pick on Ezekiel Elliott, giving Romo the type of running attack he had in 2014 with DeMarco Murray in the backfield. But a back injury in the Cowboys' third preseason game derailed Romo's season and gave fourth-round pick Prescott a chance to seize the opportunity.\nPrescott has exceeded expectations this season, displaying a level of poise reserved for veteran NFL quarterbacks. The 23-year-old has thrown 14 touchdowns and just two interceptions, helping the Cowboys to a surprising 8-1 start and the best record in the NFL.",

(Source: KPHO/KTVK) PHOENIX (KPHO/KTVK) - \nIt was a presidential race that divided the country. \nIt also led to an increase in hate speech and online harassment on social media sites like Twitter and Facebook. \n\"It can be hateful and hurtful,\" said Amy Haack of Phoenix. \"I think anything to reduce that would be good.\" \nTwitter announced Tuesday that it was taking significant steps to crack down on hate speech. \nSeva Simran is all for it. \nSimran is Sikh and has been the target of hateful rhetoric himself. \n\"We should have protections for people to feel safe and guard against people inciting violence, whether it's minorities or groups that are a little more at risk,\" said Simran. \nThe changes Twitter is making include: Allowing users to mute words, phrases, emojis, and conversations Twitter users can report \"hateful conduct\" Re-train support teams to better recognize hate speech \n\"You're still be allowed to say what you want on Twitter, no matter how racist,\" said Steven Kaas, of Phoenix. \"But it also allows people to remove themselves from that hate, without violating any 1st amendment rights.\" \nTwitter already allows users to mute accounts they don't want to see tweets from. \nCopyright 2016 KPHO (KPHO Broadcasting Corporation).

      "text": "Twitter took another step Tuesday in its long fight against trolls, announcing that it will give users a mute feature to weed out harassing words and phrases from their notifications.\nThe company plans to roll out the feature more broadly over time, Del Harvey, Twitter's vice president of trust and safety, said in an interview with The Washington Post. Adding it to notifications was a priority based on the feedback from Twitter users.\n\"We've heard from users that this [notifications] is an area where people don't feel as though they have as much control on Twitter,\" Harvey said. \"You're not searching for this content, but it's still something that's coming in to your Twitter experience.\"\nWith the new feature, Twitter users will be able to compile their own list of words, phrases and emoji that they don't want to see pop up in their notifications from the network.\nThe feature is similar to one Instagram rolled out earlier this year that let users block comments that contained certain phrases. Twitter's move comes after an election cycle that saw, among other incidents, a prominent anti-Semitic movement on the network - it has been repeatedly criticized for not moving quickly enough to combat harassment on its site.\nHarvey, who has been at Twitter for eight years, said she knows that some users are frustrated with the pace at which it's addressing harassment issues. \"We haven't always moved as quickly as we would like or done as much as we would like,\" she said, adding that the company is trying to make sure that it has tools to shut down harassment on the site without crossing the line into limiting speech. \"We have tried to be thoughtful, to make sure we don't have unintended and negative consequences,\" Harvey said.\nTwitter has struggled for years with striking the right balance between protecting open expression on the network and protecting victims of harassment, often fielding heavy criticism for erring too far on the side of free speech. Harvey acknowledged that there were plenty of prime examples of Twitter's shortcomings when it came to policing harassment on the network during this year's election.\nThe addition of the mute feature wasn't driven by the dialogue around the election itself, Harvey said, but it did underscore for Twitter how much further it still has to go. Harvey said that Twitter has also made some changes to the way that users can report harassment on the site to better reflect its policies.\nLast year, Twitter explicitly banned \"hateful conduct\" - which prohibits the promotion of violence and direct attacks or threats to others on the basis of race, ethnicity and a number of other attributes. The social network has now updated the language it uses in its harassment reporting tool to reflect that policy and inform users that they can report others for that kind of behavior. Twitter has also made it easier for bystanders to report abuse - so person B can report that person C is harassing person A.\nFinally, Harvey said, Twitter is continually training its staff across the globe to recognize more forms of abuse. Twitter staff members review each report of abuse to determine whether it violates the company's policies. It's common to see Twitter users posting incredulous screenshots of notices from Twitter's abuse team rejecting abuse reports, even when they clearly violate Twitter's rules.\nThose oversights are upsetting, she acknowledged, and often happen because a reviewer doesn't have the cultural context to understand why something may be offensive or abusive. Something that's obviously offensive to an American may not be so obvious to a person born in India, and vice versa, she explained.\nSo, in addition to an ongoing training course on how to recognize abusive behavior, Harvey said, Twitter has put together a training program on the historical and cultural context around particular types of harassment - types of anti-Semitism, for example. She said Twitter will also focus more closely on keeping its staff up to date with the evolving language of hate on its network.\nPrivacy Policy Twitter, Inc.",

(Source: KPHO/KTVK) PHOENIX (KPHO/KTVK) - \nIt was a presidential race that divided the country. \nIt also led to an increase in hate speech and online harassment on social media sites like Twitter and Facebook. \n\"It can be hateful and hurtful,\" said Amy Haack of Phoenix. \"I think anything to reduce that would be good.\" \nTwitter announced Tuesday that it was taking significant steps to crack down on hate speech. \nSeva Simran is all for it. \nSimran is Sikh and has been the target of hateful rhetoric himself. \n\"We should have protections for people to feel safe and guard against people inciting violence, whether it's minorities or groups that are a little more at risk,\" said Simran. \nThe changes Twitter is making include: Allowing users to mute words, phrases, emojis, and conversations Twitter users can report \"hateful conduct\" Re-train support teams to better recognize hate speech \n\"You're still be allowed to say what you want on Twitter, no matter how racist,\" said Steven Kaas, of Phoenix. \"But it also allows people to remove themselves from that hate, without violating any 1st amendment rights.\" \nTwitter already allows users to mute accounts they don't want to see tweets from. \nCopyright 2016 KPHO (KPHO Broadcasting Corporation).

      "text": "News Analysis No, Twitter -- a mute button for hate speech won’t work A mute button for notifications is not much of a step toward curbing online harassment. Twitter needs to do a lot more. More like this Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry Computerworld | Nov 15, 2016 8:02 AM PT Like this article? thumbsup 0 thumbsdown RELATED TOPICS Comments I have a great idea for dealing with internet trolls. What if you type in every possible combination of hurtful words you can think of and then mute them so you don’t ever see them? That’s essentially what Twitter has done with a new mute setting today . It’s a lame attempt to deal with a growing problem . The issue of course is that internet trolls are both sadistic and inventive. They can come up with a million different ways of hurting you -- inventing new slang terms and hashtags, hammering you with photos that seem harmless until you understand the context and history of the image, and by adding extra characters to a racial slur. I’ve been the victim of vicious attacks on social media several times, and the one thing I’ve noticed is that these attacks are almost always slightly different. You could mute the word “drown” I suppose and never see the notification when someone tells you to go drown yourself (this has happened to me), but the troll would use a different word like \"suffocate\" next time. In security circles, this is known as an endless pursuit, an ongoing and never ending battle to block viruses, malware, and other dangers. When you think you have “muted” a criminal hacker, he or she comes up with a brand new method of destruction. As a side benefit, this is what keeps security firms in business. Another problem with this new \"mute\" approach is that it only works with notifications, not the actual tweet. If you scroll through your own feed, you will still see any online harassment, so there’s not much of an algorithm at work here. Twitter has essentially forced you to think about which words are hurtful to you, enter them all in a field (which itself can be a difficult process for some) in an app or online, and hope the filter works when you get a text message or a notification pops up on your phone. What would work much better? I’m increasingly becoming a fan of using real names , at least in terms of being able to find that out when you look at a profile. This could also be a difficult programming trick, since trolls could easily figure out how to create a fake name. But, then again, maybe not. Twitter could do name verification in the same way other services do, requiring that you enter a social security number or by proving that your address is correct somehow (probably through image verification). What typically happens when you add a step like this is that you make things slightly more difficult and that tends to stop the dumbest (or most cautious) trolls. What really needs to happen, though, is that Twitter needs to put an end to the free for all. The service itself should use artificial intelligence to spot online harassment before it ever goes live. And, this should actually work . Machine learning would help. If I’ve posted a link to something, and a user responds and says “go jump off of a bridge” or “find a gun and kill yourself” the machine learning algorithm should kick in. Twitter should block that form of harassment; it should never even need to be muted. In case you’re wondering, Twitter does not do this today. Or, if they say they do, it doesn’t work. Machine learning is hard. It’s even harder when there are 330 million users and millions of ways of abusing other people. It’s more than flagging certain terms or muting them. It’s understanding, by analyzing the words and the context, what is harmful and abusive. Twitter, step up to the plate and do something that actually works. \nThis article is published as part of the IDG Contributor Network. Want to Join? RELATED TOPICS",

      "text": "By Ken Rosenthal \nPublished November 15, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print Chicago White Sox starting pitcher Chris Sale (49) delivers to the Toronto Blue Jays during the first inning on Monday, July 6, 2015, at U.S. Cellular Field in Chicago. (Brian Cassella/Chicago Tribune/TNS via Getty Images) \nImagine a rotation that included Max Scherzer, Stephen Strasburg ... and Chris Sale.\nThe Nationals can.\nAdd the Nats to the list of teams pursuing Sale, a list that likely includes the majority of teams in baseball.\nMore from FoxSports Fall League profile: Jared Miller D-backs uniform watch: The bloody pant leg is no more D-backs gather to aid military veterans Craig Counsell contract extension press conference Major-league sources confirmed the Nationals' interest in Sale on Tuesday. The likelihood of a deal with the White Sox, however, is unknown.\nThe Nats' edge is that they have A) a farm system that can satisfy the White Sox and B) a general manager, Mike Rizzo, who relishes making bold moves.\nAny conversation between the clubs likely would end quickly if the White Sox insisted upon shortstop Trea Turner, who finished second in the voting for National League Rookie of the Year.\nThe Nats, though, boast numerous other prospects, and they're hellbent on advancing for the first time past the Division Series, the round in which they have lost three of the past five years.\nThe pursuit of Sale might seem curious for a team that already is seeking a closer, a catcher and a big bat in the outfield. But the Nats, sources say, also have expressed interest in the Rays' starting pitchers -- Chris Archer, et al -- knowing that Strasburg has made only one career playoff start, twice missing the postseason due to health concerns.\nThe Nationals, remember, also had a deep rotation when they stunned the baseball world by signing Scherzer to a seven-year, $210 million free-agent contract before the 2015 season. They were so deep, in fact, that righty Tanner Roark spent most of the season in the bullpen. Strasburg and Gonzalez were ahead of him, and so were righties Jordan Zimmermann and Doug Fister, both of whom were entering their free-agent years.\nThe Nats' competition in the NL East, meanwhile, is only growing fiercer.\nThe Mets' rotation will be healthier next season. The Braves are trying to improve rapidly for the opening of their new ballpark. The Phillies also are deep in prospects, and the Marlins feature a core of talented position players.\nAs for Sale, the biggest question is whether the White Sox will actually move him.\n\"They're willing but only if they totally win the deal, which won't happen,\" a rival executive said.\nCall it the Curse of Shelby Miller: Every team with a high-end starter wants to match or exceed the Braves' return for Miller and reliever Gabe Speier -- infielder Dansby Swanson, outfielder Ender Inciarte and right-hander Aaron Blair.\nThe White Sox should get significantly more for Sale, who is under control for $38 million over the next three years, or just $7 million more than Zack Greinke will earn in 2017.\nAnd the Nats, as much as any club, should be motivated to get a deal done.\nFOR BRAVES, IT'S UPSIDE, UPSIDE, UPSIDE The Braves, according to sources and published reports, are pursuing three high-end starting pitchers -- Sale, Rays right-hander Chris Archer and Athletics righty Sonny Gray.\nOne rival exec says of the Braves, \"They're doing everything they can to be competitive and try to contend next year,\" their first at SunTrust Park. The Braves' approach, however, isn't simply short-term. Under president of baseball operations John Hart and GM John Coppolella, they consistently seek long-term upside.\nEven the signings of 40-something free agents R.A. Dickey and Bartolo Colon fit the plan; the veterans will serve as one-year bridges until the team's young pitchers are ready. Look at the way Hart and Coppolella approached the draft -- their first four picks in 2015 and first three in '16 were all high-school players. Sale and Gray, meanwhile, are under club control for the next three seasons and Archer for the next five, all at below-market salaries.\nGray, coming off his worst season, figures to earn less than $4 million in his first year of arbitration. Archer, meanwhile, is under contract for $4.75 million in '17, Sale for $12 million.\nThe addition of any of the three would bolster a Braves rotation that already includes Dickey, Colon and right-hander Julio Teheran. Righty Mike Foltyniewicz likely would be the fifth starter and righty Matt Wisler the sixth, providing that neither is traded. No longer would the Braves be giving starts to the Roberto Hernandezes of the world.\nTHE NEW BLUE JAY WAY It's fair to ask whether the Blue Jays' offense will be as strong without first baseman Edwin Encarnacion and right fielder Jose Bautista, both of whom are expected to depart as free agents.\nHere's the thing, though: The Jays' offense declined significantly last season, ranking fifth in the AL with 759 runs after leading the majors by a wide margin with 891 the year before.\nEncarnacion certainly was not to blame for the dropoff; he finished tied for third in the AL with 42 homers and was 10th with an .886 OPS. The Jays, meanwhile, likely figure that Kendrys Morales will replicate or surpass the 2016 production of Bautista, who played in only 116 games due to two injuries and a suspension.\nMorales must pass a physical for his three-year, $33 million free-agent signing to become an official. The Jays still want to add a left-handed hitting outfielder -- Josh Reddick would fit, and so would switch-hitter Dexter Fowler, though the Jays probably would want him to play left so they could put Kevin Pillar in center. The team also could find a right-handed complement for switch-hitter Justin Smoak at first base -- Steve Pearce is one target -- or perhaps revamp the position entirely.\nIn the end, the offense probably will not be as good as it was last season, simply because there is no replacing Encarnacion. The Jays, though, are coming off their second straight postseason appearance mostly due to their pitching and defense -- they allowed the fewest runs in the AL.\nA lefty reliever is a must -- the Jays have offered free agent Brett Cecil a three-year deal to return, as first reported by Jamie Campbell of Rogers SportsNet. But however the rest of the winter plays out, Toronto again figures to be competitive, at the very least.\nTHE ANGELS AREN'T SHOPPING THESE TWO, BUT ... Why would the Angels, a team already thin on starting pitching, consider moving Skaggs or Shoemaker, both of whom are under control for four more seasons?\nAs always, it depends upon the potential return.\nIf the Angels can get the player they want -- say, an everyday second baseman -- they then would need to measure the dropoff from Skaggs or Shoemaker to a lesser starter and the overall impact on the club.\nThe Angels plan to try right-hander J.C. Ramirez at starter and recently signed righty Jesse Chavez with the same intent. Their other alternatives for the rotation include left-hander Nate Smith and right-handers Alex Meyer, Vicente Campos and Daniel Wright.\nCould the Angels build a package around Skaggs for Twins second baseman Brian Dozier? Remains to be seen. The team has backed off the Phillies' Cesar Hernandez, according to Jeff Fletcher of the Orange County Register.\nASTROS LIKED KENDRYS -- AMONG OTHERS The Astros showed interest in Kendrys Morales before he reached agreement with the Blue Jays, and would have continued their pursuit of Yankees catcher Brian McCann even if Morales had agreed to a free-agent contract, major-league sources said.\nThe fit would not have been ideal, and the talks involving Morales seemingly did not get very far. But remember this going forward: The Astros' positional flexibility enables them to consider a variety of options.\nMorales, a switch-hitter, would have been the Astros' primary DH. McCann and Evan Gattis could have platooned at catcher, with each possibly getting at-bats at DH as well -- though Morales, 33, has missed only 12 games the past two seasons.\nThe Astros and Yankees seemingly are at an impasse over McCann, who is owed $34 million over the next two seasons and holds a full no-trade clause. But considering the large number of hitters available in trade and free agency, the Astros figure to end up with the offensive help they need.\nAROUND THE HORN *McCann and outfielder Brett Gardner are considered the most available Yankees in trade, but the team also is open to moving third baseman Chase Headley, sources say.\nHeadley, owed $13 million in each of the next two seasons, batted .178 with a .442 OPS through May 11 last season, then recovered to hit .270 with a .779 OPS the rest of the way.\n*Don't be surprised if free-agent catchers start signing soon -- Jason Castro and Jeff Mathis are among those drawing strong interest.\nCatchers generally go off the board quickly -- Chris Iannetta, Alex Avila, Geovany Soto and Bryan Pena all signed free-agent deals before Dec. 1 last year.\n*Royals catching coach Pedro Grifol was the runner-up to Alex Cora for the Astros' bench-coach position, sources said.\nThe Royals expect that Grifol will one day be a major-league manager.",

      "text": "Ian Hardy \nNovember 15, 2016 4:39pm \nTwitter made a progressive step forward by allowing its 300 million users to mute specific words and phrases in their timeline. \nThe reason for the move was to ensure users can “express her/himself in a safe, informative and fun manner,” according to Twitter . \nIf you’re interested in blocking specific tweets, words, or phrases to curb harassment on Twitter, here’s how to do it. \nFirst, muting is case-insensitive so if you want to mute “dongle” you should spell “dongle,” not “DONGLE.” In addition, muting a word will mute both the word and the related hashtag. However, if you want to mute specific users, you need to put the “@” sign before their handle. Twitter notes that words, phrases, usernames, emojis, and hashtags up to 140 characters can be muted. \nFor iOS users: \n1. Open Twitter app and go to your Notifications tab2. Tap the gear icon3. Tap Muted words4. Tap and add the specific words or phrases you desire to mute5. Add the specific words or hashtags to mute6. Tap Save. \n1. Open Twitter app and go to your Notifications tab2.

      "text": "Twitter and NBA secure exclusive ad partners for original livestreaming shows By Adam Flomenbaum - 16 November 2016 03:40am \nOver the summer, during a string of seemingly weekly livestream partnerships with sports leagues, Twitter announced that it was teaming with the NBA to create original content for the platform. nba_twitter_amex_jbl_harman \n\"The Starters,” the popular NBA TV show and podcast, and “The Warm Up,” produced by Turner Sports, have been 'airing' weekly on Twitter. Now - in a livestreaming first - the shows have exclusive ad partners in American Express and JBL Harman. This is a major win for the NBA, and more importantly, for Twitter, as it a vote of confidence for its big bet on livestreaming (Twitter sells the inventory and splits the revenue with the NBA). \nNo matter the viewership numbers for these shows, American Express and JBL Harman can be confident that they are reaching diehard NBA fans, who are among Twitter's most passionate users. \nAccording to Twitter research, 63 per cent of fans say they look for NBA content on Twitter with equal frequency whether there’s a live game happening or not; 88 per cent of fans on Twitter check Twitter for NBA-related content several times a week even when there are no live games. \nThis article is about: North America , Found Remote , NBA , Twitter , Digital , Media , Brand Adam Flomenbaum \nAdam Flomenbaum is a global leading expert on social television, over the top platforms, TV Everywhere, and content marketing.

      "text": "Twitter finally attempts to tackle online abuse Twitter unveiled new ways to curb cyberbullying on its platform — but the company is still getting taunted by critics.\nThe struggling social network said Tuesday it will make it easier for users to block posts they don’t want to see and to report abuse, even if it’s directed at others. \nThe San Francisco-based firm — whose recent effort to sell itself to Walt Disney and Salesforce flopped partly because of concerns about harassment — said it’s likewise training its support teams to better identify abuse. \n“We’ve had some challenges keeping up with and curbing abusive conduct,” Twitter admitted in a blog post . “We took a step back to reset and take a new approach.” \nThat will include expanding Twitter’s “mute” feature to suppress not just offending posts from other users, but also notifications with unwanted “keywords, phrases, and even entire conversations,” Twitter said. \nStill, the long-promised improvements — which come more than a year after 39-year-old Chief Executive Jack Dorsey retook the helm, vowing to turn the company around — looked puny to many critics. \n“The key problem here is that Twitter is in the anonymity business,” according to tech strategist Shelly Palmer. “You can say whatever you want as long as nobody knows who you are or where you live.” \nCreating a Twitter account is a far less rigorous process than creating a Facebook account. It’s easier for Twitter cyberbullies, if caught, to simply create another account. FindTheCompany | Graphiq \n“You need to be in the identity business if you’re selling advertising,” Palmer notes. \nOn the flip side, clamping down on anonymous accounts could hit Twitter where it hurts most — in its reported 300 million monthly active user base, which has already moved from fast growth to slow growth to stagnation. \nTwitter officials didn’t respond to questions Tuesday on whether the company has weighed tightening registration requirements. \n“It’s not a bad idea, but what do you do about parody accounts, or when people register accounts for pets?” says Alex Taub, CEO of SocialRank, a service that tracks Twitter and Instagram activity for corporate clients. \nSatirical accounts for figures like Steve Jobs, Kanye West and even God are “part of why Twitter’s so amazing,” Taub notes. \n“I think some kind of registration could work,” Taub says, but flexibility would be crucial to the vetting process, and it might get costly. \nTwitter shares, down 18 percent this year, slipped 16 cents on Tuesday, to $18.98 ",

      "text": "Twitter adds new options to curb abuse, harassment By BARBARA ORTUTAYAP Technology Writer \nNEW YORK (AP) - Twitter, long criticized as a hotbed for online harassment, is expanding ways to curb the amount of abuse users see and making it easier to report such conduct. \nTwitter said Tuesday that it is expanding a \"mute\" function that lets people mute accounts they don't want to see tweets from. Now, users will be able to mute keywords, phrases and conversations they don't want to get notifications about. Users who decide to mute things won't see them. \nThe words, phrases and conversations will continue to exist on Twitter, and anyone who doesn't mute them will continue to see them. But the company is also making it easier to report hateful conduct, and said it has re-trained its support teams about its policies and hateful conduct. \nAbuse can easily spread on Twitter due to its public, real-time nature, where tweets are easily amplified by retweets and users can easily and openly attack others. While Twitter prohibits \"specific conduct that targets people on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability, or disease,\" this policy has not been enough to stomp out abuse. \nNot even celebrities are immune. Over the summer, \"Ghostbusters\" star Leslie Jones publicly abandoned Twitter after becoming the target of sexist and racist abuse on the service. She has since returned. \nTwitter has been trying to get a handle on its Wild West reputation as a haven for online harassment and abuse while still holding onto its commitment to free speech. It's been tricky, to say the least. \n\"We don't expect these announcements to suddenly remove abusive conduct from Twitter,\" Twitter Inc. said in a blog post . \"No single action by us would do that. Instead we commit to rapidly improving Twitter based on everything we observe and learn.\" Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

      "text": "Twitter adds new options to curb abuse, harassment By BARBARA ORTUTAYAP Technology Writer \nNEW YORK (AP) - Twitter, long criticized as a hotbed for online harassment, is expanding ways to curb the amount of abuse users see and making it easier to report such conduct. \nTwitter said Tuesday that it is expanding a \"mute\" function that lets people mute accounts they don't want to see tweets from. Now, users will be able to mute keywords, phrases and conversations they don't want to get notifications about. Users who decide to mute things won't see them. \nThe words, phrases and conversations will continue to exist on Twitter, and anyone who doesn't mute them will continue to see them. But the company is also making it easier to report hateful conduct, and said it has re-trained its support teams about its policies and hateful conduct. \nAbuse can easily spread on Twitter due to its public, real-time nature, where tweets are easily amplified by retweets and users can easily and openly attack others. While Twitter prohibits \"specific conduct that targets people on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability, or disease,\" this policy has not been enough to stomp out abuse. \nNot even celebrities are immune. Over the summer, \"Ghostbusters\" star Leslie Jones publicly abandoned Twitter after becoming the target of sexist and racist abuse on the service. She has since returned. \nTwitter has been trying to get a handle on its Wild West reputation as a haven for online harassment and abuse while still holding onto its commitment to free speech. It's been tricky, to say the least. \n\"We don't expect these announcements to suddenly remove abusive conduct from Twitter,\" Twitter Inc. said in a blog post . \"No single action by us would do that. Instead we commit to rapidly improving Twitter based on everything we observe and learn.\" Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

      "text": "Published November 16, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre 0 Email Print ﻿ \n \nDenied a populism from the left, millions of Americans picked the one from the right. \nBy D.D. Guttenplan, The Nation \n \nIn June 1953, construction workers in East Berlin went on strike to protest a pay cut. Although it was quickly crushed by the Communist government, which called in Soviet tanks to bolster the Stasi, the uprising was irrefutable evidence that all was not well in the workers’ paradise. It also prompted the poet Bertolt Brecht to make a wry suggestion: Given that the people “Had forfeited the confidence of the government,” perhaps it would be easier “for the government / To dissolve the people / And elect another?”\nEven before November 8, it was not difficult to find similar views among a broad spectrum of the American media, from Boston Globe columnist Michael Cohen’s dismissal of Bernie Sanders’s “predictable and one-dimensional attack on Wall Street,” to Jamelle Bouie’s declaration in Slate that Hillary Clinton was right to label Donald Trump’s supporters “a basket of deplorables,” to New York Times columnist David Brooks’s bland assertion that Trump voters “are just going with their gene pool.” Way back in September 2015, you could read George Packer in The New Yorker sneering at Sanders not only for his “tendency to drone on like a speaker at the Socialist Scholars Conference circa 1986” but for the sin of offering “simple answers to difficult problems.”\nThe specter haunting our centrist press wasn’t Trump, whose candidacy would never have lasted past the first primary without the constant promotion of a slavish media. Nor was it Sanders, whose insurgent campaign was dismissed and deprecated by the same corporate media that mostly ignored him for as long as possible.\nRead the full story at The Nation→",

LOUIS, MO (KTVI)-Members of the Alt-Right Movement are not happy this morning with St. Louis native Jack Dorsey’s Twitter after many prominent right leaning accounts are locked or removed for violation of abuse rules. Those affected say it’s censorship because twitter has a left leaning political ideology that doesn’t agree with theirs.\nTwitter also announced its rolling out new features that will allow you to mute what it calls undesirable, hateful, abusive or other types of toxic content .\nScott Schaffer of Blade Technology joined us on FOX 2 News in the Morning with more.\nThe micro-blogging service has received much criticism for not being able to stop hate speech and online harassment, especially during the election season. This issue has reportedly caused potential investors or acquirers to balk at associating themselves with this.\nImplementation of these new options took a rather long time. This is the difficulty in dealing with 317M users tweeting in real-time.\nUsers will be able to: \nFilter out certain keywords, phrases, user names, and hashtags in their mentions. Mute entire threads. Access Twitter’s newly revamped abuse reporting system allowing bystanders to report harassment and hate speech directly rather than leaving that option solely to the person on the receiving end.  ",

      "text": "Twitter adds options to curb harassment Easier to block, report bad conduct ASSOCIATED PRESS Print \nNEW YORK — Twitter, long criticized as a hotbed for online harassment, is expanding ways to curb the amount of abuse users see and making it easier to report such conduct. \nTwitter Inc . said Tuesday that it is expanding a “mute” function that lets people mute accounts they don’t want to see tweets from. Now, users will be able to mute keywords, phrases, and conversations they don’t want to get notifications about. \nThe words, phrases and conversations will continue to exist on Twitter, and anyone who doesn’t mute them will continue to see them. But the company is also making it easier to report hateful conduct, and said it has retrained its support teams about its policies and hateful conduct. \nAbuse can easily spread on Twitter because of its public, real-time nature, where tweets are easily amplified by retweets and users can easily and openly attack others. While Twitter prohibits “specific conduct that targets people on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability, or disease,” this policy has not been enough to stomp out abuse. \nNot even celebrities are immune. Over the summer, Ghostbusters star Leslie Jones publicly abandoned Twitter after becoming the target of sexist and racist abuse on the service. She has since returned. \nTwitter has been trying to get a handle on its Wild West reputation as a haven for online harassment and abuse while still holding onto its commitment to free speech.

      "text": "print Twitter recently banned Milo Yiannopoulos, a prominent figure in the \"alt-right\" movement. Drew Angerer / Getty \nFollowing the release of new features to tackle abuse on its network yesterday, Twitter has begun suspending the accounts of users associated with the alt-right political movement, reports USA Today . \nThat includes the one belonging to Richard Spencer, who heads up the National Policy Institute (NPI) think tank. The organization concerns itself with the identity of “people of European descent in the United States, and around the world,” and publishes related writings on its sister site, Radix Journal . \nAccounts for both bodies have also been suspended, along with those of well-know alt-righters Paul Town, Pax Dickinson, Ricky Vaughn and John Rivers. \nIn a YouTube clip titled ‘The Knight of Long Knives’ (possibly a nod to the 1934 purge of Nazi leaders meant to help Hitler consolidate power) uploaded yesterday, Spencer said that he wasn’t being more of a troll or engaging in any untoward behavior prior to his ban. He noted: \n\"I am alive physically but digitally speaking there has been execution squads across the alt-right.\" \nSpencer added: \n\"There is a great purge going on and they are purging people based on their views.\" \nTwitter previously terminated the account belonging to Milo Yiannopoulos , the outspoken tech editor at Breitbart, after he harassed Ghostbusters actor Leslie Jones on the site. \nSpencer clearly believes that there’s a coordinated effort being made to stamp out the alt-right movement on Twitter. He also said that he’d consider switching to Gab , a social network that focuses on allowing people the right to free speech with minimal censorship. \nTwitter told USA Today that it doesn’t comment on the actions taken with regard to individual accounts, for privacy and security reasons – so we may not hear from the company about this. However, it’d be naive to think that this is the last we’ll hear on the subject. Spencer said in the video that he believed “this is a clear sign that we have power.” How things will play out from here is anybody’s guess. Read the original article on The Next Web .

      "text": "Email \nST. LOUIS, MO (KTVI)-Members of the Alt-Right Movement are not happy this morning with St. Louis native Jack Dorsey’s Twitter after many prominent right leaning accounts are locked or removed for violation of abuse rules. Those affected say it’s censorship because twitter has a left leaning political ideology that doesn’t agree with theirs. \nTwitter also announced its rolling out new features that will allow you to mute what it calls undesirable, hateful, abusive or other types of toxic content . \nScott Schaffer of Blade Technology joined us on FOX 2 News in the Morning with more. \nThe micro-blogging service has received much criticism for not being able to stop hate speech and online harassment, especially during the election season. This issue has reportedly caused potential investors or acquirers to balk at associating themselves with this. \nImplementation of these new options took a rather long time. This is the difficulty in dealing with 317M users tweeting in real-time. \nUsers will be able to: Filter out certain keywords, phrases, user names, and hashtags in their mentions. Mute entire threads. Access Twitter’s newly revamped abuse reporting system allowing bystanders to report harassment and hate speech directly rather than leaving that option solely to the person on the receiving end. \n",

      "text": "0 \nRoman Reigns has had an interesting run over the past few years. The WWE pushed him to the moon, and the push was met with some resistance from fans. Although Roman has been able to convert many non-believers, he still has his fair share of haters out there. One fan on Twitter took a shot at Roman, asking him when he’s going to be as phenomenal as AJ Styles. @WWERomanReigns When you gonna be as phenomenal as @AJStylesOrg ? \n— The Ian Weaver (@FightRockyFight) November 16, 2016 \nRoman Reigns reminded the fan that he successfully defended the WWE World Championship against Styles not once, but twice earlier this year. Lol🤔Pretty sure i beat him not once but twice.✌🏽️You can watch it back on the #WWENetwork . #TheGuy #AhhhhYessir https://t.co/dQRVihbtXA \n— Roman Reigns (@WWERomanReigns) November 16, 2016 \nThe fan piped up again and made a comment about Roman’s status with the fans, and Mr. Reigns suggested that the man make some money and buy a ticket to a live event. Sorry @WWERomanReigns didn't realise you Was over so much on Twitter, Where are all these people at the Live events? #WellnessPolicy 👊🏻🐕💨 \n— The Ian Weaver (@FightRockyFight) November 16, 2016 Stop tweeting at work and earn some money. Then you'll be able to attend a live event and experience it yourself. 👍🏽 #GoodLuck https://t.co/oD4fFwFPlN \n— Roman Reigns (@WWERomanReigns) November 16, 2016 \nAnother fan called Roman Reigns out for carrying the United States Championship over his shoulder, and Roman told him that it’s not about how you carry the belt, it’s about how you defend it. @WWERomanReigns Just watched RAW, and it seems disrespectful to me the way to carry a title belt like a book bag. Show more respect for it \n— Justin Cooper (@Jcooper770) November 15, 2016 It's not how you hold it. It's how you defend it. So how about… 🤔You worry about you and I'll worry about me!👍🏽 #AhhhYessir https://t.co/HbkCqH3sYM \n— Roman Reigns (@WWERomanReigns) November 15, 2016 \nPutting things into perspective, these insults seem pretty tame considering the internet once spent the better part of 24 hours making fun of Roman’s jeans. \nRelated: A Picture Of Roman Reigns Wearing Jeans Has Gone Viral, And He’s Getting Roasted By The Internet \nRoman Reigns seems to get a mixed reaction in most cities WWE travels to, and on Twitter as well. But at the end of the day Roman has been good to the people that have been good to him, and he threw some positivity into the mix by wishing one of his fans a happy birthday. @WWERomanReigns Seems as you are in a good mood 😉 I'm 31 on Friday and would love a early happy birthday from my favourite superstar! 🙏🏼 \n— Fiona Marie (@fiona_mariep) November 16, 2016 HBD!!! 31 was good for me, hopefully the same for u!! https://t.co/uzYjwBMl0f \n— Roman Reigns (@WWERomanReigns) November 16, 2016 \nWWE United States Champion Roman Reigns is set to team up with Universal Champion Kevin Owens, Chris Jericho, Seth Rollins and Braun Strowman at Survivor Series on Sunday. \nHowever, the alliance between Kevin Owens and Roman Reigns won’t be lasting very long, as Kevin Owens is set to defend his Universal Title against Roman Reigns at WWE Roadblock on December 18.

Twitter suspends several alt-right accounts Associated Press Twitter \nNEW YORK – Twitter has suspended the accounts of several prominent members of the so-called “alt-right” in an apparent purge. \nTwitter declined comment, but noted that its policies forbid violent threats, hate speech or harassment, adding that it will take action against repeat offenders. \nRichard Spencer, head of the National Policy Institute, a white nationalist think tank, says his personal Twitter account, as well as the accounts for the institute and his magazine, were all suspended this week without notification. \nThe Twitter accounts of alt-right personalities Paul Town, Pax Dickinson, Ricky Vaughn and John Rivers also were suspended. \nSpencer, who is credited with popularizing the term “alt-right,” says he didn’t tweet anything recently that might provoke a suspension. He calls the suspensions a coordinated attack against users with certain viewpoints. Published: Nov. 16, 2016, 10:40 a.m.",

      "title": "After They Announce Crack Down on Hate Speech, Twitter Suspends Numerous Alt-Right Accounts",
      "text": "Following the announcement by Twitter that they would make a concerted effort to put a stop to hate speech and abuse on the social media service, which now includes expanded mute settings for users, the company went out and suspended or removed a number of accounts from well-known alt-right members.\nOne of the accounts suspended on Tuesday is that of Richard Spencer , one of the leading voices of the alt-right movement. Spencer’s account had actually been verified by Twitter, something reserved for notable people or organizations. Twitter also removed the accounts for Spencer’s think tank and organization.\nSpeaking to The Daily Caller , Spencer called the suspension “corporate Stalinism” and Twitter is “trying to airbrush the Alt-Right out of existence.”\nSpencer and his outlets weren’t the only one removed on Tuesday.\nCasualties today: @PaxDickinson @PaulTown_ @JohnRiversToo @RadixJournal @RichardBSpencer @DatRickyVaughn Twitter is on a censorship rampage!\n— WeSearchr (@wesearchr) November 15, 2016\nNow, this isn’t the first time Twitter has suspended or banned those from the alt-right. Breitbart’s Milo Yiannopolous was booted this past summer after he directed his followers to harass actress Leslie Jones. Twitter user @Ricky_Vaughn99 was suspended last month and it appears that his new account, @DatRickyVaughn, was part of this latest purge.\nThis all comes on the heels of President-elect Donald Trump naming alt-right provocateur and Breitbart chief Steve Bannon as his chief strategist. There has been q uite a bit of outrage from across the political spectrum over the hiring, with the main criticism is that Bannon in the White House gives the alt-right a major voice in the Trump administration.\n[image via Twitter]\n–\nFollow Justin Baragona on Twitter: @justinbaragona",

      "text": "Twitter has suspended the accounts of several members of the alt-right, a loose movement of the far-right with some followers who traffic in white nationalism, anti-immigration sentiment, anti-Semitism and a disdain for “political correctness.” A few of the accounts were associated with Richard Spencer, a white supremacist who runs a Washington think tank, the National Policy Institute, and the journal Radix, USA Today reported Wednesday. The social media platform suspended Spencer’s personal account, @RichardBSpencer, as well as those of the institute and journal. It also suspended the accounts of several other alt-right figures. “The Twitter rules prohibit targeted abuse and harassment, and we will suspend accounts that violate this policy,” Twitter said in a statement, according to USA Today.\nThe alt-right gained prominence this year as many of its followers supported the campaign of President-elect Donald Trump. On Sunday, Trump appointed Stephen Bannon, the former chairman of the Breitbart News website, as his chief strategist — Bannon has called Breitbart “a platform for the alt-right.”\nPresident-elect Donald Trump’s appointment for senior counselor and chief White House strategist Stephen Bannon looks on during a national security meeting with advisers at Trump Tower, October 7, 2016, in New York. (AP Photo/ Evan Vucci)\nAccording to an October report, an Anti-Defamation League task force tracking a “spike” in online harassment of journalists credited self-identified supporters of Trump with the lion’s share of the anti-Semitic tweets aimed at Jewish reporters and broadcasters. The report emphasized that the study did not imply that Trump’s campaign supported or endorsed the Twitter activity. The report noted that many of the tweets originated with a number of overlapping “communities” associated with the alt-right.\nIn July, Twitter suspended the account of Milo Yiannopoulos, a Breitbart editor, for leading a campaign of online harassment against female actor Leslie Jones.\n ",

      "text": "By Blanche Johnson \nPublished November 17, 2016 FoxNews.com Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print The \"Property Brothers\" and the stars of \"Flip or Flop.\"  (Reuters/ HGTV) \nHGTV shows are all about home improvement, but from time to time the network has to do some image repair when its stars and series have caused scandals. Here are the top HGTV scandals: \n1. ‘Property Brothers’ bar brawl One of the “Property Brothers” stars, Jonathan Scott, made headlines after an attention-grabbing bar fight in North Dakota in June. Reports at the time stated the fight broke out when the bar closed and Scott and others became upset when their drinks were taken away. TMZ reported the bar’s bouncer had Scott in a headlock and the TV star called 911 to report that he’d been assaulted. Following the incident, Fargo City attorney Erik Johnson announced no charges would be filed due to a lack of evidence.\n2. ‘Fixer Upper’ fake? Earlier this month, a show participant from “Fixer Upper” told FOX411 the house hunting scenes on the show are scripted. Each episode features participants touring three homes and eventually picking one to be their fixer upper. David Ridley told us he purchased his home before he was selected to be on the show, and he claimed that was a prerequisite for his selection for the series. A close look at the show’s application seemed to corroborate his claim. HGTV wouldn’t comment on the accusations directly. Click here for more on the story.  \n\n3. ‘Rehab Addict's’ secret pregnancy and custody fight Nicole Curtis, the star of “Rehab Addict,” was pregnant with her second child while filming the show, but she opted to hide her burgeoning baby belly from the cameras. Curtis has stated she covered her stomach with objects and didn’t want the public to find out she was expecting. She recently revealed her most personal secrets in her memoir, “Better Than New,” going into detail about her current custody battle with her youngest son’s father. Over the summer, Curtis was reportedly banned from taking her child to work sites where toxins are present and was warned she could face jail time for skipping out on expenses, attorney fees and missed visits between her son and her ex.\n4. ‘Love It or List It’ home destroyed? A North Carolina couple filed a lawsuit in April against the production company behind “Love it or List It,” claiming their home was left “irreparably damaged” after the show. The couple stated producers hired a contractor that the couple didn’t agree to work with. They also claimed in the suit that the show was somewhat staged, arguing people featured on the series are told what to say and how to act.\n5. ‘Flip it Forward’… or not Scandal destroyed “Flip it Forward” before it could ever make it to the small screen. The show was destined for HGTV in October 2014, but one of the star’s comments about same-sex marriage, abortion and Islam caused complaints, and the show was shut down before it ever got off the ground. \n\n6. House Hunters staged? Rumors have plagued “House Hunters” for years with claims the show is scripted. Back in 2010, the blog Hooked on Houses published a firsthand account from a woman featured on “House Hunters” in which the woman detailed the way producers allegedly script the series. HGTV has avoided formally commenting on the allegations, but over the summer, the network released a tongue-in-cheek video that showed writers scripting an episode of the series. \n7. 'Flip or Flop' fan scam Fans of the show \"Flip or Flop\" who sign up for pricey classes that boast stars Tarek and Christina El Moussa can teach them how to flip homes have expressed serious disappointment. Some have gone as far as to call the classes a full-blown scam.  More than a dozen people interviewed  by the Associated Press complained that the famed hosts weren't present for the classes, which lacked any real instruction and were focused on pushing more courses. HGTV has said it's not associated with the classes and declined to provide information about if the network has received complaints about the courses. \n\nYou can follow Blanche Johnson on Twitter @blancheFOXLA .",

      "text": "By Todd Starnes \nPublished November 16, 2016 FoxNews.com Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print Aaron and Melissa Klein, Sweet Cakes By Melissa owners  (Courtesy of the Kleins ) \nAn Oregon bureaucrat who waged political jihad against the owners of a Christian bakery was given the heave-ho by voters.\nLabor Commissioner Brad Avakian was defeated by Republican Dennis Richardson in his bid to be Secretary of State.\nClick here to join Todd’s American Dispatch: a must-read for Conservatives! \nIt's the first time a Republican has been elected to a statewide office in Oregon since 2002.\nSo consider this – Avakian was too liberal for what is arguably one of the most liberal states in the country.\nAvakian, a passionate advocate for the LGBTQIA crowd, was thrust into the national spotlight when he declared war on a Christian bakery in 2013.\nAaron and Melissa Klein, the owners of Sweet Cakes By Melissa, declined to make a wedding cake for a lesbian couple’s ceremony.\nThe Kleins, who are devout Christians, explained that participating in a same-sex wedding would violate their deeply-held religious beliefs.\nClick here to get your “I’m Politically Incorrect” t-shirt! \nAvakian launched a very public and very ugly assault on the Klein family – alleging they had discriminated about the lesbian couple.\nThey faced boycotts and picket lines and other wedding vendors were threatened with similar action if they did business with Sweet Cakes.\nThe family’s young children received death threats and the store’s  social networking platforms were overrun by militant LGBT activists posting obscene and profane messages.\nThe Kleins were eventually ordered to pay $135,000 in “emotional damages” to the lesbians.\nThey were also forced to shutter their retail location – and eventually shut down their family bakery.\n“The goal is never to shut down a business. The goal is to rehabilitate,” Avakian told The Oregonian in 2013.\nAvakian was just as ruthless in his attacks on a Portland bar that turned away transgender patrons.  The owner of the Twilight Room Annex did not want his establishment to be known as a “gay bar.”\nThe bar was slapped with a $400,000 judgment and was forced to shut down.\nThe Kleins are represented by First Liberty Institute, one of the nation’s most prominent religious liberty law firms. They are appealing the fines levied by Avakian’s office.\n“We will never know if Mr. Avakian’s unprecedented attack on religious liberty played a role, but we are hopeful that there is a path toward justice,” attorney Hiram Sasser told me. “Everyone’s beliefs deserve respect and tolerance even if some disagree with those beliefs.”\nSasser said Americans should have the freedom to live according to their own conscience without the force of government being used to punish those who disagree with government officials like Avakian.\n“Perhaps this will serve as a point of reflection for government leaders that the people of Oregon and indeed most Americans believe in tolerance and respect and the dignity of each person to live their lives according to the dictates of their own consciences,” Sasser said.\nVoters saw Avakian for who he really was – an anti-Christian bully with no regard for the U.S. Constitution.\nNobody likes a bully – especially a liberal bully.\n\nTodd Starnes is host of Fox News & Commentary, heard on hundreds of radio stations. His latest book is \" God Less America: Real Stories From the Front Lines of the Attack on Traditional Values. \" Follow Todd on Twitter  @ToddStarnes and find him on Facebook .",

      "text": "Twitter Quietly Cracks Down On Racist Trolls Four months ago, Twitter said it hadn't done enough to stop online abuse. 11/16/2016 04:19 pm ET Nina Golgowski Trends reporter, The Huffington Post Kacper Pempel/Reuters Members of the alt-right had their Twitter accounts suspended on Tuesday. The social media platform has not publicly explained the motive or timing of its actions. \nTwitter moved quietly Tuesday to suspend some accounts posting racist, white nationalist, anti-Semitic and other hateful content. The site will also introduce measures to mute, report and ultimately combat such conduct across its platform. \nThe announcement comes just a week after Donald Trump ’s presidential win. Trump’s campaign helped fuel a resurgence of racism , bigotry and sexism online and offline. \nLast month, the Southern Poverty Law Center, which monitors hate groups, blamed Twitter for not cracking down on abusive accounts. According to SPLC spokeswoman Heidi Beirich, the group asked Twitter to remove more than 100 accounts belonging to members of the alt-right , which SPLC identifies as a group or individuals who embrace “white ethno-nationalism as a fundamental value.” On Twitter, many self-described members of the alt-right used the social network to threaten Jewish people, women, people of color and other groups. \nRichard Spencer of the National Policy Institute, a white nationalist think tank, was among those who lost his account this week. The vocal Trump supporter has called for the removal of Jewish people, Latinos and people of color from the U.S. \nAccounts for Spencer’s think tank and its online magazine, Radix Journal, are also now suspended, as are accounts belonging to white nationalists Paul Town, Pax Dickinson, Ricky Vaughn and John Rivers. Paul Sancya, File/ASSOCIATED PRESS In the wake of Donald Trump's election, there was an upsurge in reported hate crimes across the country. \nTwitter’s rules prohibit “hateful conduct,” including promoting violence and threats against people “on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability, or disease.” \n“We also do not allow accounts whose primary purpose is inciting harm towards others on the basis of these categories,” Twitter’s website states. \nLast month, the SPLC took issue with Twitter’s handling of anti-Semitic tweets sent to Jewish journalists. The Anti-Defamation League had reported earlier that white supremacists and other hate groups were disproportionately responsible for the offensive tweets. \n“[T]he ADL report adds further confirmation that the company fails to ban abusive accounts,” the SPLC stated, sharing ADL study’s findings on its website. \nThe SPLC went on to identify several individuals and organizations that promote racism on social media. White supremacists David Duke , Jared Taylor , and Matthew Heimbach topped their list but remain on Twitter as of Wednesday. Spencer also made the list. \nSpencer responded to the account suspensions in a YouTube video on Tuesday , stating, “I and a number of other people who just got banned were not even trolling.” He accused Twitter of conducting “a great purge” of its users “on the basis on their views.” \nSpencer also reaffirmed his support for Breitbart News editor Milo Yiannopoulos, who was permanently banned from Twitter in July. That decision followed Yiannopoulos’ vicious and racist attack on African-American comedian Leslie Jones. \nAt the time, Twitter acknowledged it hadn’t “done enough to curb this type of behavior on Twitter,” but vowed to step up its game. “We are continuing to invest heavily in improving our tools and enforcement systems to better allow us to identify and take faster action on abuse as it’s happening and prevent repeat offenders,” the company stated at the time. \nIn light of those statements, it’s not clear why Twitter waited until now to take action against these individual accounts. The company did not return The Huffington Post’s request for comment on Wednesday. Related Coverage",

      "text": "Home > Internet > Times Internet hires former Twitter exec Rishi Jaitly as CEO of Times Global Partners Times Internet hires former Twitter exec Rishi Jaitly as CEO of Times Global Partners | 0 Comments Rishi Jaitly \nTimes Internet Ltd, the digital arm of media group Bennett, Coleman & Co Ltd (BCCL), said on Wednesday it has appointed former Twitter India head Rishi Jaitly as the chief executive officer of Times Global Partners. \nThe move indicates Times Internet’s intention to scale up its investments and partnerships with global technology and media platforms. Times Global has tied up with international Internet companies such as Uber, Airbnb, Coursera, Vice and Huffington Post, and has facilitated their entry in the Indian market. \n“With Times’ resources and Rishi’s global perspective, capabilities and proven ability to lead, we are well positioned to enable the success of global companies in India and scale our business by orders of magnitude,” said Satyan Gajwani, vice chairman, Times Internet, in a statement. “For our current partners, and those to come, the India opportunity remains unmatched and we are pleased that Times Global Partners has become the bridge of choice into and within India.” \nJaitly previously led Twitter Inc’s India operations for four years as vice president of Asia Pacific and Middle East businesses. He left the US company earlier this month , revealing on the microblogging site that he was moving on to pursue “new opportunities”. \nJaitly worked with Google early in his career when he was a member of the tech giant’s India management team, helping build the local business and leading strategic partnerships and public affairs for the company in South Asia. He has previously worked as an aide to Google chairman/chief executive Eric Schmidt and was director of the Knight Foundation, an investor in new media and journalism innovation, in America. \nJaitly said in the statement he would seek to expand on the success Times Global already enjoyed and build a global business that created value for The Times Group and global business partners. \nTwitter has been in news for a few months now after it was reported that it was in talks with several technology companies such as Google and Salesforce to sell itself. However, it was reported last month that Salesforce would not be making a bid to buy the microblogging company. \nLast month, Bloomberg reported that Twitter might cut 8% of its workforce, or 300 people. The firm has a market cap of about $14 billion and losses running at about $400 million a year, making Twitter an expensive bid for prospective buyers. \nShortly after Jaitly’s resignation, Parminder Singh, Twitter’s managing director for India, Southeast Asia and Middle East and North Africa (MENA) quit the company as well and was replaced by Maya Hari. In July, Twitter Inc’s Asia chief Shailesh Rao resigned . \nIn September, Twitter halted operations at its global engineering centre at Bengaluru and laid off employees there. Last week, Twitter Inc’s chief operating officer Adam Bain announced that he was leaving the company and would be replaced by chief financial officer Anthony Noto . \n ",

      "text": "For all the connection and hilarity Twitter brings into our lives, too often it can feel like a hotbed for hostility. Earlier this year, celebrities including comedian Leslie Jones and Fifth Harmony’s Normani Kordei chose to leave the platform for extended periods of time because of racist cyberbullying campaigns directed at them. But one user is taking steps to make the platform safe for all, and not in the way you might expect.\nOn Sunday, beloved Twitter denizen @jonnysun created an ingenious way to serve up simple reminders for self-care. After recognizing his own unhealthy habits, he decided that having a bot that would tweet out gentle prompts every hour to “adjust your posture” or “take a quick walk” would help him combat his recent string of obsessive behavior. “[I]f ur like me & have been glued to twitter bc you dont [sic] know what else to do, maybe it might help, idk. feedback is welcome! ok i love u bye,” he wrote.\nhttps://twitter.com/jonnysun/status/797903722584031232\nApparently Sun wasn’t the only one who was stuck in a pattern of unhealthy behaviors because after being live for only three days @tinycarebot has already amassed a following of 25.4k followers.\nhttps://twitter.com/tinycarebot/status/798910570011336704\nhttps://twitter.com/tinycarebot/status/798880379381972992\nhttps://twitter.com/tinycarebot/status/798548183928311808\nhttps://twitter.com/tinycarebot/status/798382091406712832\nThough Sun cites the bot as a work in progress and it seems to recycle the same few dozens self-care reminders, fans are already thanking the sweet little bot for helping them practice healthy behaviors while browsing Twitter. \"[T]hank u for being the most supportive robot i know,\" one user wrote .\nTwitter has been making gradual changes to combat the rash of abuse and harassment that occurs on their platform. Earlier this week they announced more comprehensive muting and reporting features would begin rolling out to users in the coming days. But it’s tiny steps, like Sun’s @tinycarebot, that take a proactive approach to bettering physical and mental health that can sometimes be the most powerful.",

      "text": "Home » Latest News » Tech » Twitter suspends several alt-right accounts Twitter suspends several alt-right accounts   4:01 pm 11/16/2016 04:01pm Share FILE - This Friday, Oct. 18, 2013, file photo, shows a Twitter app on an iPhone screen in New York. Twitter has suspended the accounts of several prominent members of the so-called “alt-right” in an apparent purge, Wednesday, Nov. 16, 2016. Twitter declined comment, but noted that its policies forbid violent threats, hate speech or harassment, adding that it will take action against repeat offenders.(AP Photo/Richard Drew, File) \nNEW YORK (AP) — Twitter has suspended the accounts of several prominent members of the so-called “alt-right” in an apparent crack down on accounts tied to hate speech or threats of violence. \nTwitter declined comment, but noted that its policies forbid violent threats, hate speech or harassment and promise to take action against violators. The company also announced Tuesday that it was expanding ways for users to report harassment and curb the amount of abuse they see, a reaction to a growing problem of abuse, bullying and harassment on the internet. \nThe alt-right, short for “alternative right,” is a loose group espousing a provocative and reactionary strain of conservatism. It’s often associated with far right efforts to preserve “white identity,” oppose multiculturalism and defend “Western values.” \nThe movement drew national attention during the presidential campaign, especially after Stephen Bannon of the Breitbart website, considered by many to be the alt-right’s platform, joined Donald Trump’s campaign. Trump recently named Bannon as the White House chief strategist. \nTHE ALT-RIGHT FEELS WRONGED \nRichard Spencer, head of the National Policy Institute, a white nationalist think tank, said in an interview that his personal Twitter account and accounts for the institute and his magazine were all suspended this week without notification. \nSpencer, who is credited with popularizing the term “alt-right,” says he has never called for violence and hasn’t tweeted anything recently that might provoke a suspension. He called the suspensions a coordinated attack against users with certain viewpoints. \nWhile he acknowledged that Twitter is a company and has a right to do as it pleases, he says it also needs to accept that it has evolved into something bigger and needs to act accordingly. \n“This is 2016 and we live in a digital world,” he said. “Twitter is how the president releases press releases and it’s also how teenage girls talk about Justin Bieber. \n“Twitter is not just some website. It’s a public space and we have to treat it that way.” \nPax Dickinson, who was ousted as chief technology officer of the website Business Insider in 2013 for sending offensive tweets, says he also wasn’t given a reason for his Twitter suspension. But he says it likely stemmed from a tweet he sent director Joss Whedon that included an anti-gay slur. \nDickinson says he’s appealed the suspension, but has yet to hear back from Twitter a day. Spencer says he doesn’t plan on coming back to Twitter unless he gets an apology. \nThe Twitter accounts of alt-right personalities Paul Town, Ricky Vaughn and John Rivers also were suspended as of Wednesday. \nBACKGROUND: ONLINE HARASSMENT \nOnline harassment has long been a problem for the internet. But because Twitter allows most conversations to play out in public and allows for relative anonymity, it has been especially visible there. And it’s especially challenging because Twitter harassment often resembles online mob action, with numerous pseudonymous accounts ganging up to tweet vile messages at particular individuals. \nActress Leslie Jones briefly quit Twitter in July after dealing with racial slurs, obscene photos and comments about her appearance. She called on the social networking service to do more to curb harassment on the platform. \nTwitter ultimately banned several users, including conservative provocateur and Breitbart technology editor Milo Yiannopoulos. \n___",

      "text": "this story Image: AP \nTwitter suspended a number of accounts associated with the alt-right, USA Today reported this morning . This move was bound to be divisive: While Twitter has banned and suspended users in the past (prominently, Milo Yiannopoulos for incitement), USA Today points out the company has never suspended so many at once—at least seven in this case. Richard Spencer, one of the suspended users and prominent alt-righter , also had a verified account on Twitter. He claims, “I, and a number of other people who have just got banned, weren’t even trolling.” \nIf this is true, it would be a powerful political statement, indeed. As David Frum notes in The Atlantic , “These suspensions seem motivated entirely by viewpoint, not by behavior.” Frum goes on to argue that a kingpin strategy on Twitter’s part will only strengthen the alt-right’s audience. But we may never know Twitter’s reasoning for suspending the accounts. Twitter declined to comment on its moves, citing privacy and security reasons. \nSpencer and Jared Taylor, founder of the far-right magazine American Renaissance , released a joint statement calling for solidarity from journalists in favor of free expression: statement from Jared Taylor and Richard Spencer on alt-right Twitter purge, just sent to me by Taylor: pic.twitter.com/ZmYXEGceuN — Rosie Gray (@RosieGray) November 16, 2016 \nBut in the space of a few sentences, the message turned to a threat: “If they fail to do so, we must assume that they support the suppression of certain political views, and we will not grant them interviews or access to our events.” This is a complicated rhetorical maneuver: It finds a reason for the alt-right to exclude the rest of the press for not speaking up for them. Damned if you do, etc. \nWe cannot assess whether Twitter’s move to suspend the alt-righters was in fact politically motivated, but it does fit into a pattern of ongoing complaints against Twitter: a lack of consistency in enforcing guidelines. \nRelated: How the ‘alt-right’ checkmated the media \nTwitter has been the battleground for free speech for months, under fire from upset users who feel harassed on the platform and unsupported by the slow, patchy response to their complaints. I’ve written previously about the difficulties and concerns around moderation for Twitter. At the beginning of this year, the company introduced a Trust and Safety Council made up of nonprofits to make recommendations on how to police the site. They have been making incremental progress ever since—including improvements yesterday to make the platform a more comfortable space, including the ability to mute conversations so users do not continually receive notifications of hateful speech against them or others. \nBut the small changes to the Twitter interface belie a larger problem: the public is invested in Twitter as a public sphere. Twitter, like Facebook, is a private company and therefore not technically ruled by the First Amendment, but it is commonly understood as such, giving voice, as Zuckerberg himself claimed about Facebook, to more people than ever before. Its users are vigilant about keeping Twitter both an open space and safe space, but they need a transparent infrastructure for that: a way to reliably report users, not just mute them, and faith in Twitter’s judgment about who to suspend, and when. \nSo in some sense, it does not matter whether Twitter had legitimate reasons for suspending all the accounts at once; if it is never transparent and specific about why it suspends or bans, we will not trust its decisions. Until the company takes a consistent approach in its enforcement, Twitter will be under fire from right, left, and the fourth estate alike. Has America ever needed a media watchdog more than now?

(Scott Boehm via AP) \nPurdue has suspended four football players due to an investigation of sexual assault allegations by two female students, but prosecutors say they won't file charges.\nThe school said Wednesday the incident occurred Oct. 13. It didn't identify the players and said federal law prevented it from commenting further.\nThe female students' attorney, Mario Massillamany, says the sexual assaults occurred at an off-campus house where the players lived. He says his clients reported the assaults to Purdue authorities and the West Lafayette Police Department.\nTippecanoe County Prosecutor Pat Harrington said in a statement that his office won't file criminal charges after reviewing the evidence. He also said the players cooperated with investigators.\nRelated stories... 2 Maryland football players charged in pellet gun shootings",

      "text": "Twitter suspends several alt-right accounts Associated Press Published 2:34 pm, Wednesday, November 16, 2016 \nTwitter has suspended the accounts of several prominent members of the alt-right in an apparent crackdown on accounts tied to hate speech or threats of violence. \nThe San Francisco company declined comment, but noted that its policies forbid violent threats, hate speech or harassment and promise to take action against violators. The company also announced Tuesday that it was expanding ways for users to report harassment and curb the amount of abuse they see, a reaction to a growing problem of abuse, bullying and harassment on the Internet. \nThe alt-right, short for “alternative right,” is a loose group espousing a provocative and reactionary strain of conservatism. It’s often associated with far right efforts to preserve “white identity,” oppose multiculturalism and defend “Western values.” \nThe movement drew national attention during the presidential campaign, especially after Stephen Bannon of the Breitbart website, considered by many to be the alt-right’s platform, joined Donald Trump ’s campaign. Trump recently named Bannon as the White House chief strategist. \nRichard Spencer , head of the National Policy Institute , a white nationalist think tank, said in an interview that his personal Twitter account and accounts for the institute and his magazine were all suspended this week without notification. \nSpencer, who is credited with popularizing the term “alt-right,” says he has never called for violence and hasn’t tweeted anything recently that might provoke a suspension. He called the suspensions a coordinated attack against users with certain viewpoints. \nWhile he acknowledged that Twitter is a company and has a right to do as it pleases, he says it also needs to accept that it has evolved into something bigger and needs to act accordingly. \n“This is 2016 and we live in a digital world,” he said. “Twitter is how the president releases press releases and it’s also how teenage girls talk about Justin Bieber . \n“Twitter is not just some website. It’s a public space and we have to treat it that way.” \nPax Dickinson , who was ousted as chief technology officer of the website Business Insider in 2013 for sending offensive tweets, says he also wasn’t given a reason for his Twitter suspension. But he says it likely stemmed from a tweet he sent director Joss Whedon that included an antigay slur. \nDickinson says he’s appealed the suspension, but said he has yet to hear back from Twitter. Spencer says he doesn’t plan on coming back to Twitter unless he gets an apology. \nThe Twitter accounts of alt-right personalities Paul Town, Ricky Vaughn and John Rivers also were suspended as of Wednesday. \nHarassment has long been a problem for the Internet. But because Twitter allows most conversations to play out in public and allows anonymity, it has been especially visible there. And it’s especially challenging because Twitter harassment often resembles online mob action, with numerous pseudonymous accounts ganging up to tweet vile messages at particular individuals. \nActress Leslie Jones briefly quit Twitter in July after dealing with racial slurs, obscene photos and comments about her appearance. She called on the social networking service to do more to curb harassment. \nTwitter ultimately banned several users, including conservative provocateur and Breitbart technology editor Milo Yiannopoulos .

He calls the suspensions a coordinated attack against users with certain viewpoints. \n(Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

      "text": "Published November 16, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre 0 Email Print \nBy Rich Noyes | NewsBusters \nSince Sunday evening, ABC, CBS and NBC (along with a host of other establishment media outlets) have been engaged in a feeding frenzy over Donald Trump’s appointment of Steve Bannon, with reporters relentlessly employing phrases such as “white nationalist,” “white supremacist,” “extremist,” “racist” and “anti-Semitic” to solidify the image of Bannon as a dangerous pick for a top White House position.\nBut since Friday, those same networks have been blind to the controversies surrounding the top candidate for Democratic National Committee Chairman, Rep. Keith Ellison. Ellison has been accused of ties to the radical Nation of Islam, the Muslim Brotherhood, and once suggested the 9/11 terrorist attacks were akin to the infamous Reichstag fire used to propel Hitler’s Nazi party into absolute power in 1933 Germany.\nFrom Sunday night through Wednesday morning, MRC analysts found the Big Three had already churned out 41 minutes, 46 seconds of coverage devoted to Bannon’s appointment. An analysis finds that nearly three-fourths (74%) of all references to Bannon were negative; the only positive comments viewers heard came from interviews or soundbites with other Trump campaign officials or Republican officeholders.\nReporters threw everything at Bannon, including the kitchen sink. On ABC’s World News Tonight on Monday, correspondent Tom Llamas labeled him “a champion of the alt-right, a conservative movement many say is fueled by racism, sexism and anti-Semitism.” NBC anchor Lester Holt said Trump was “lifting a man with ties to white nationalists into the heart of the White House.”\nRead the full story at Newsbusters→",

Bobby Kaufmann says he will introduce a “suck it up, buttercup” bill in January when the Iowa State Legislature resumes, in a bid to fight back against campus coddling.\nThe bill would hit taxpayer-funded state universities with a budget cut for double the amount they spend on such election-related activities. Kaufmann emphasized that existing therapy and mental health services are not being targeted.\n“I saw schools with rising, skyrocketing tuition costs where they are also finding money and expenditures for things such as cry rooms. I heard reports of rooms where you can play with Play-Doh, where you can color on books and talk about your feelings, and I was hearing reports of some schools that were bringing in ponies to be able get students through the election,” he told \"Fox & Friends\" on Wednesday.\nAfter receiving hundreds of emails of support from across the country, Kaufmann also has set up a website where supporters can \"Adopt a Trump protester\" and get a \"suck it up, buttercup\" hat for $17.76. He says he hopes other states pursue similar legislation. \nRead the full story at FoxNews.com→",
