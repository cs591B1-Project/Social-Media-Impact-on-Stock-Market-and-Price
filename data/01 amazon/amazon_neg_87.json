      "text": "December 5, 2016 Photo by dennizn / Shutterstock.com \nImagine walking into a small grocery store and quickly grabbing a bite to eat, a loaf of bread and a carton of milk — all without paying for it in a checkout line. \nWith Amazon Go , that dream has become a reality. The online retailer has opened a new brick-and-mortar store in Seattle that allows you to purchase groceries without waiting in a checkout line, swiping your debit card or paying a cashier. \nUsing what Amazon has referred to as “the world’s most advanced shopping technology” — it’s actually the same tech that’s used in self-driving cars — consumers can walk into the store with no more than a smartphone and the Amazon Go app. \nAfter scanning your phone to enter the store, you select the items you want to buy and then leave the store with your purchases in hand without ever having to get your wallet out or wait in line. Amazon says: \nOur Just Walk Out technology automatically detects when products are taken from or returned to the shelves and keeps track of them in a virtual cart. When you’re done shopping, you can just leave the store. Shortly after, we’ll charge your Amazon account and send you a receipt. \nAmazon is testing out a 1,800-square-foot Amazon Go store in Seattle. Although it’s only open to Amazon workers now, the e-commerce giant says the store will be open to the public in early 2017. \nAmazon explains the Amazon Go concept in this video . \nAlthough an Amazon Go store is smaller than the average supermarket, the mammoth retailer says it will have the basics, including bread and milk, plus locally made chocolates, artisan cheeses and meal kits, among other items. \nHow do you feel about cashier-free shopping?

      "text": "Tech Amazon moves to cut checkout line, promoting a grab-and-go experience An Amazon employee at work in the Amazon Go grocery store in Seattle, on Dec 5, 2016. Photo: The New York Times - Published: 12:25 PM, December 6, 2016 \nSEATTLE —There is almost no aspect of retail that Amazon has not upended with online shopping. Now, the company is trying to computerise the experience of buying sandwiches and soda from the corner convenience store. \nIn the latest in its expanding set of experiments involving brick-and-mortar retail stores, Amazon has created a small grocery store in Seattle that will allow customers to pluck drinks, prepared meals and other items off shelves and walk out without having to wait in a checkout line, the company said. \nAmazon said on its website that a smartphone app and various other types of technology in the store had eliminated the usual bottleneck of cashiers and registers that typically stand between shoppers and the store exit. \nFor now, only Amazon employees can shop in the 1,800-square-foot store, which is on the ground floor of one of the company’s new office towers in downtown Seattle. The company said that it planned to open the store to the public early next year and that it would offer chef-made meal kits with ingredients for quickly preparing dinners at home. \n“Four years ago, we started to wonder: What would shopping look like if you could walk into a store, grab what you want and just go?” a narrator says in a video about the store concept, called Amazon Go, which the company posted online on Monday. \nAmazon did not say what its expansion plans were for Amazon Go. If they are anything like the what the company has done with its other brick-and-mortar stores, new locations will open elsewhere slowly over time as Amazon learns how customers use the first one. \nAmazon opened its first physical book store just over a year ago in a Seattle shopping mall. It has added others in the San Diego and Portland, Oregon, areas and has said it will open new book stores in Chicago and Boston. \nIt is also working on an another grocery store concept that would allow customers to order food items online and then pick them up quickly by pulling into parking stalls. Two such stores are under construction in Seattle, according to documents filed with the city’s planning department and people with knowledge of the effort who asked for anonymity because the plans were confidential. \nMs Pia Arthur, an Amazon spokeswoman, declined to comment on the grocery pickup locations. \nIn the grand scheme of Amazon’s business, analysts consider the retail stores to be an infinitesimal portion of the more than US$135 billion (S$191.7 billion) in sales expected from the company this year. \nBut the plans reflect a growing recognition by the company that certain categories of shopping are unlikely to move completely online. In some cases, it is simply more convenient to buy items in a store or more attractive to browse for them on physical shelves. \n“The way we think about it is the size of online retail is going to continue to grow dramatically but there will always be an offline option,” said Mr Gene Munster, an analyst at Piper Jaffray. “They’re trying to streamline and capture a portion of that offline experience.” \nAmazon still views technology as being useful in overhauling shopping in traditional retail shops. While the company has not said exactly how the Amazon Go stores will work, visitors will gain entry to them through a smartphone app. The company said the stores relied on a variety of technologies similar to those in self-driving cars, including those defined by buzzwords such as “computer vision, sensor fusion and deep learning.” \nUnanswered for now are questions about how the stores would handle shoplifting and whether there would be employees on hand to check identification cards for alcohol purchases.

      "text": "Amazon.com Inc said on Monday it has opened a brick-and-mortar grocery store in Seattle without lines or checkout counters, kicking off new competition with supermarket chains.\nAmazon Go, the online shopping giant’s new 1,800-square-foot (167-square-meter) store, uses sensors to detect what shoppers have picked off the shelf and bills it to their Amazon account if they do not put it back.\nThe store marks Amazon’s latest push into groceries, one of the biggest retail categories it has yet to master. The company currently delivers produce and groceries to homes through its AmazonFresh service.\n“It’s a great recognition that their e-commerce model doesn’t work for every product,” said analyst Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research, noting that physical stores would complement AmazonFresh.\n“If there were hundreds of these stores around the country, it would be a huge threat” to supermarket chains, he said.\nThe S&P 1500 food retail index, which includes Kroger Co, Whole Foods Market Inc and other companies, was down nearly 1 percent in mid-day trading. Shares of Amazon were up about 2 percent.\nAmazon Go is available now for employees of the company and is expected to be open to the public early next year, Amazon said. \nWhat do you think of Amazon Go's \"just walk out technology\"? It was not immediately clear if and when Amazon Go would expand outside Seattle.\n“The checkout lines are always the most inefficient parts of the store experience,” said Neil Saunders, managing director of retail research firm Conlumino. “Not only would you save a lot on labor costs, you actually would make the process much quicker for consumers and much more satisfying.”\nStill, the grab-and-go experience would take getting used to, he said.\nSome people may “feel like they stole” an item, Saunders said. “There is a bit of education needed for consumers.”\nApart from groceries such as bread and milk, the store also offers ready-to-eat breakfasts, lunches and dinners made fresh by on-site chefs and local kitchens and bakeries, Amazon said.\nThat would make Amazon Go a potential competitor to fast-casual dining chains like Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc as well.\nAmazon Go is not the first physical store for the e-commerce giant to open.\nIt has a book store in Seattle, as well as pop-ups at malls where it displays Amazon devices such as the Kindle.\nMGM poised to premiere...

      "text": "By Therese Poletti, MarketWatch\nOpinion: Online retail giant aims to disrupt $795 billion U.S. grocery business with stores that don't include checkout lines and other concepts\nAmazon.com Inc.'s plans for its most ambitious brick-and-mortar effort yet aim to disrupt an arena seen as an Achilles' heel for Silicon Valley: The $795 billion grocery industry.\nAmazon released a video Monday about a convenience-store effort called Amazon Go, one of three grocery concepts the online-retail giant is planning, according to a Monday report from The Wall Street Journal (http://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-grocery-store-concept-to-open-in-seattle-in-early-2017-1480959119) and earlier reporting from Business Insider (http://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-2000-grocery-stores-10-years-2016-10). According to Amazon's website (https://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&node=16008589011#), Amazon Go has been in the works for four years and weaves together a combination of machine learning, computer vision, artificial intelligence, sensors and RFID technology in what it calls \"Just Walk Out Technology,\" which rids the store of one of the biggest hassles of shopping, the checkout lines.\n(https://www.youtube.com/embed/NrmMk1Myrxc)\n\"No lines, no checkouts, no registers, no, seriously,\" a video on its website says in a demo showing 20-something shoppers entering the store, scanning an app at the turnstile and simply walking out with their wares.\nThe ability to build its biggest push into physical retail from scratch with this type of automatic technology could be the ticket to further disruption of traditional brick-and-mortar retailers like Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) and Target Corp. (TGT). Grocery shopping for fresh food has long been a difficult but enticing arena for tech startups, which have put forth efforts like Webvan during the dot-com boom and now Instacart and its rivals, which offer grocery shopping as a service. Stores have even developed their own online options, such as Safeway.com, but Amazon has a good chance to crack into traditional grocery shopping with this hybrid effort, which addresses many of the issues consumers have with online grocery shopping.\nJohn Blackledge, a Cowen & Co. analyst with an outperform rating on Amazon, wrote in a note to clients Monday that he believes the grocery business is Amazon's \"biggest potential source of revenue upside over time, with Go being another layer of Amazon's multiplatform grocery strategy,\" which also includes its Amazon Fresh and Prime Now two-hour delivery.\n\"We are encouraged by Amazon's growing footprint in this category, which we see as ripe for potential disruption given younger demos increasingly purchasing food and beverage grocery items via digital channels,\" Blackledge wrote.\nAccording to a recent survey by Cowen & Co., 65% of consumers surveyed preferred to buy their groceries in a store, with 51% of them stating that they liked to inspect or select the food. Cowen estimates that the online portion of the U.S. food and beverage grocery market was only about 4% retail penetration in 2016, or about $33 billion.\nAmazon (AMZN) is testing the Amazon Go technology in an 1,800-square-foot convenience store in Seattle accessible only by Amazon employees, though the company plans to open it to the public early next year. The retail space automatically detects when products are taken from or returned to the shelves and keeps track of them in a virtual shopping cart. When you're done shopping, you can just leave the store, and items will be charged to your Amazon account.\n\"The items are identified and automatically associated with the user at or near the time of the item pick,\" according to the abstract of one Amazon patent for the technology (http://pdfaiw.uspto.gov/.aiw?Docid=20150012396&homeurl=http%3A%2F%2Fappft.uspto.gov%2Fnetacgi%2Fnph-Parser%3FSect1%3DPTO2%2526Sect2%3DHITOFF%2526u%3D%25252Fnetahtml%25252FPTO%25252Fsearch-adv.html%2526r%3D1%2526p%3D1%2526f%3DG%2526l%3D50%2526d%3DPG01%2526S1%3D(Steven.IN.%252BAND%252BKessel.IN.)%2526OS%3DIN%2FSteven%252Band%252BIN%2FKessel%2526RS%3D(IN%2FSteven%252BAND%252BIN%2FKessel)&PageNum=&Rtype=&SectionNum=&idkey=247A761FA385), published last year.\nThe company likens the technology at the Amazon Go store to that used in self-driving cars, saying it uses computer vision and AI to associate items with past purchases made by the consumer. This use of AI and machine learning will make its algorithms smarter for future purchases, and is an early consumer-oriented effort, built using AI tools in the design of the product from the get go, versus enhancing an already existing product.\nDespite the work already put into the effort, this could be a costly experiment for Amazon, with the different range of store formats planned, physical retail locations to acquire or rent, technology systems to install and maintain, more employees to hire and, of course, keeping inventory stocked. The cost of Amazon's vast physical warehouse infrastructure build-out over the past few years has only been eclipsed in cost by the money its spends on shipping products to customers of its Amazon Prime service, which includes free shipping.\nBuilding more physical stores--the WSJ and BI reports say Amazon will build up to 2,000 brick-and-mortar locations--will certainly add to Amazon's already hefty spending. But if any dot-com can handle the financial outlay necessary to finally break into the grocery business and make it work, it will likely be the company that already did the same to bookstores.\nWall Street seems bullish on the efforts, with Amazon's shares gaining nearly 3% on Monday (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/amazon-shares-on-track-to-snap-losing-streak-after-amazon-go-launch-announced-2016-12-05). The online-retail giant's stock has increased 12.4% so far this year, handily outpacing the S&P 500 index, at 7.9%, and Dow Jones Industrial Average , which has gained 10.3%.\n-Therese Poletti; 1823ET\n ",

      "title": "Google Unveils New App to Find Friends in an Emergency; Amazon's New Grocery Store -- Tech Roundup",
      "text": "In recent years, many technology companies have spent an increasing amount of time on developing products and services to boost personal safety.\nAlphabet ( GOOGL ) Trusted Friends is the latest entry into this area. The app allows users to notify friends and family during emergencies that they are safe. Google launched the app on Monday. It is available on Android and will be accessible on iOS systems. Alphabet is the parent company of Google.\nShares of Alphabet rose nearly 2% in Monday trading.\nThe launch of this product follows by just two days a tragic fire in an Oakland warehouse that at last report had left 36 people dead. Fire and safety officials expect the death toll to climb as they continue to remove debris, and many families are still waiting for word on loved ones.\nThe warehouse, which reportedly violated building code regulations, served as a recreational and living space.\nDuring the fire, Facebook ( FB ) activated its Safety Check feature , which allows a user to let others know they're okay during a disaster and receive status notifications on friends and family.\nTrusted Friends is similar to Apple's ( AAPL ) Find My Friends app, which also allows users to reveal their locations to trusted contacts. That app has been popular with parents of school-age children.\nALPHABET, FACEBOOK and APPLE are holdings in Jim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS Charitable Trust Portfolio. See how Cramer rates the stock here . Want to be alerted before Cramer buys or sells GOOGL , FB or AAPL ? Learn more now.\nWith Trusted Friends, users select trusted contacts from their address books to notify in emergencies or even when they feel unsafe. These are typically friends and family whom they trust with information about what they are doing and where. When these trusted contacts open the app, they can see where someone was active in roughly the previous hour.\nThe trusted contacts may ask about a user's whereabouts, and users themselves can proactively broadcast where they are and provide a brief status report if they feel unsafe. Users may subsequently shut off the app when they arrive at their destination.\n\"This new personal safety app lets you share your location with loved ones in everyday situations and when emergencies arise - even if your phone is offline or you can't get to it,\" Minh T. Nguyen, a Google software engineer, wrote in a blog post announcing the Trusted Contacts' release Monday.",

According to Amazon's website (https://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&node=16008589011#), Amazon Go has been in the works for four years and weaves together a combination of machine learning, computer vision, artificial intelligence, sensors and RFID technology in what it calls \"Just Walk Out Technology,\" which rids the store of one of the biggest hassles of shopping, the checkout lines.\n\"No lines, no checkouts, no registers, no, seriously,\" a video on its website says in a demo showing 20-something shoppers entering the store, scanning an app at the turnstile and simply walking out with their wares.\nThe ability to build its biggest push into physical retail from scratch with this type of automatic technology could be the ticket to further disruption of traditional brick-and-mortar retailers like Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) and Target Corp. (TGT). Grocery shopping for fresh food has long been a difficult but enticing arena for tech startups, which have put forth efforts like Webvan during the dot-com boom and now Instacart and its rivals, which offer grocery shopping as a service. Stores have even developed their own online options, such as Safeway.com, but Amazon has a good chance to crack into traditional grocery shopping with this hybrid effort, which addresses many of the issues consumers have with online grocery shopping.\nJohn Blackledge, a Cowen & Co. analyst with an outperform rating on Amazon, wrote in a note to clients Monday that he believes the grocery business is Amazon's \"biggest potential source of revenue upside over time, with Go being another layer of Amazon's multiplatform grocery strategy,\" which also includes its Amazon Fresh and Prime Now two-hour delivery.\n\"We are encouraged by Amazon's growing footprint in this category, which we see as ripe for potential disruption given younger demos increasingly purchasing food and beverage grocery items via digital channels,\" Blackledge wrote.\nAccording to a recent survey by Cowen & Co., 65% of consumers surveyed preferred to buy their groceries in a store, with 51% of them stating that they liked to inspect or select the food. Cowen estimates that the online portion of the U.S. food and beverage grocery market was only about 4% retail penetration in 2016, or about $33 billion.\nAmazon (AMZN) is testing the Amazon Go technology in an 1,800-square-foot convenience store in Seattle accessible only by Amazon employees, though the company plans to open it to the public early next year. The retail space automatically detects when products are taken from or returned to the shelves and keeps track of them in a virtual shopping cart. When you're done shopping, you can just leave the store, and items will be charged to your Amazon account.\n\"The items are identified and automatically associated with the user at or near the time of the item pick,\" according to the abstract of one Amazon patent for the technology (http://pdfaiw.uspto.gov/.aiw?Docid=20150012396&homeurl=http%3A%2F%2Fappft.uspto.gov%2Fnetacgi%2Fnph-Parser%3FSect1%3DPTO2%2526Sect2%3DHITOFF%2526u%3D%25252Fnetahtml%25252FPTO%25252Fsearch-adv.html%2526r%3D1%2526p%3D1%2526f%3DG%2526l%3D50%2526d%3DPG01%2526S1%3D(Steven.IN.%252BAND%252BKessel.IN.)%2526OS%3DIN%2FSteven%252Band%252BIN%2FKessel%2526RS%3D(IN%2FSteven%252BAND%252BIN%2FKessel)&PageNum=&Rtype=&SectionNum=&idkey=247A761FA385), published last year.\nThe company likens the technology at the Amazon Go store to that used in self-driving cars, saying it uses computer vision and AI to associate items with past purchases made by the consumer. This use of AI and machine learning will make its algorithms smarter for future purchases, and is an early consumer-oriented effort, built using AI tools in the design of the product from the get go, versus enhancing an already existing product.\nDespite the work already put into the effort, this could be a costly experiment for Amazon, with the different range of store formats planned, physical retail locations to acquire or rent, technology systems to install and maintain, more employees to hire and, of course, keeping inventory stocked. The cost of Amazon's vast physical warehouse infrastructure build-out over the past few years has only been eclipsed in cost by the money its spends on shipping products to customers of its Amazon Prime service, which includes free shipping.\nBuilding more physical stores--the WSJ and BI reports say Amazon will build up to 2,000 brick-and-mortar locations--will certainly add to Amazon's already hefty spending. But if any dot-com can handle the financial outlay necessary to finally break into the grocery business and make it work, it will likely be the company that already did the same to bookstores.\nWall Street seems bullish on the efforts, with Amazon's shares gaining nearly 3% on Monday (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/amazon-shares-on-track-to-snap-losing-streak-after-amazon-go-launch-announced-2016-12-05). The online-retail giant's stock has increased 12.4% so far this year, handily outpacing the S&P 500 index, at 7.9%, and Dow Jones Industrial Average , which has gained 10.3%.\n-Therese Poletti; 2225ET\n ",

      "text": "This column has been updated to make note of a new Wall Street Journal report about Amazon's grocery store ambitions.\nAbout 20 years ago, Amazon ( AMZN ) led the way in providing consumers the convenience of buying goods without leaving their homes or changing out of their pajamas. It's perhaps fitting, then, that the company might soon lead the way in making traditional retail shopping much more convenient.\nAnd the effort would fit well with what has been reported about Amazon's efforts to add a bricks-and-mortar footprint to its retail empire.\nAmazon Go , a store concept that will first be tested at an 1,800-square foot Seattle location, lets shoppers buy items without ever having to stand in a checkout line. A dedicated app is used to gain access to an Amazon Go store, apparently via barcode-scanning. Afterwards, cameras and sensors backed by AI algorithms detect whenever a shopper picks up an item from a shelf, as well as when an item is picked up and then placed back on a shelf.\nUpon leaving a store, shoppers are automatically charged for any taken items through their Amazon accounts, with receipts sent to their Amazon Go apps. \"No lines. No checkout,\" proclaims the narrator of an Amazon promo video. That sound you hear is thousands of retail cashiers groaning in unison.\nAmazon shares are up 2.6% today. Verifone ( PAY ) , a major provider of point-of-sale hardware and software to retailers, is up 5.8%. The Nasdaq is up 0.9%.",

The company currently delivers produce and groceries to homes through its AmazonFresh service. \n\"It’s a great recognition that their e-commerce model doesn’t work for every product,\" said analyst Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research, noting that physical stores would complement AmazonFresh. \n\"If there were hundreds of these stores around the country, it would be a huge threat\" to supermarket chains, he said. \nThe S&P 1500 food retail index, which includes Kroger Co, Whole Foods Market Inc and other companies, was down 0.5 percent at the close. Shares of Amazon closed up about 2.6 percent. \nAmazon Go is available now for employees of the company and is expected to be open to the public early next year, Amazon said. \nIf tests are successful, Amazon plans to open more than 2,000 grocery stores, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday, citing sources. The company is considering other store formats, including one that would let drivers pick up goods at the curbside, the report said. \nAmazon declined to comment on the report. \n\"The checkout lines are always the most inefficient parts of the store experience,\" said Neil Saunders, managing director of retail research firm Conlumino. \"Not only would you save a lot on labour costs, you actually would make the process much quicker for consumers and much more satisfying.\" \nStill, the grab-and-go experience would take getting used to, he said. \nSome people may \"feel like they stole\" an item, Saunders said. \nApart from groceries such as bread and milk, the store also offers ready-to-eat meals made fresh by on-site chefs and local kitchens and bakeries, Amazon said. \nThat would make Amazon Go a potential competitor to fast-casual dining chains like Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc as well. \nAmazon Go is not the first physical store for the e-commerce company to open. \nIt has a book store in Seattle, as well as pop-ups at malls where it displays Amazon devices such as the Kindle.",

      "text": "Amazon is already your go-to in the world of online shopping—seriously, can you even remember a world without Prime? So it should be no surprise that the site&apos;s first big venture into brick-and-mortar retail is totally revolutionary: Amazon has introduced a brand new kind of grocery store that has no lines. In fact, it has no cash registers at all. In Amazon&apos;s new grocery store concept, called Amazon Go , you can literally grab your food and walk out, no checkout required..\nBut how, you ask, can this possibly work? Upon entry to the location, shoppers will scan their Amazon Go app. Then, the app will use the same technology as self-driving cars—computer vision, sensor fusion, and deep learning—to keep track of what you&apos;re picking up as you make your way through the store, and automatically place the item in your virtual shopping cart in the app. (If you change your mind about something you grabbed, the app will pick up on that too and automatically delete from your cart.) When you&apos;re done, you just leave; Amazon just charges your card and emails you a receipt. It&apos;s that easy.\nTo shop at the stores, which will all be a compact 1,800 square feet, you just need an Amazon account, the Amazon Go app, and a smartphone. According to their website, Amazon Go stores will sell everything from classic grocery staples to ready-made options, and they&apos;ll feature both well-known and newer brands.\nAnd especially eager shoppers could get their hands on a line-free grocery experience soon. The first location in Seattle is currently in Beta and open only to Amazon employees, but doors are expected to open to the public in early 2017. And Business Insider reports that this is just the beginning: Amazon plans to build as many as 2,000 grocery stores nationwide within the next decade.\nCheck out the video below for Amazon&apos;s full breakdown of their new store concept.\nAt this rate, it&apos;s only a matter of time before Amazon takes over the world.\nRELATED:\n5 Things You Should Never Buy At The Grocery Store Before You Head to the Grocery Store, Read This If Top Designers Took Over Your Grocery Store, It Might Look Like This",

Paris Bureau Chief, IDG News Service | Dec 5, 2016 1:09 PM PT Email a friend Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. \nA QR code on a smartphone is used to identify shoppers at Amazon Go stores. Credit: Amazon After warehouse staff, Amazon to... Show More \nAmazon.com is still figuring out how to use robots to fill store shelves, but it's about done with clerks. Next year, the company will open a convenience store in Seattle where shoppers can walk in, take what they want -- and leave. \nThe Amazon Go store is on the corner of 7th Avenue and Blanchard Street in Seattle, in the heart of Amazon's new campus development and a few blocks from the company's headquarters. \nAmazon wants people to walk in to the store and then just walk out with what they want. \nIt's not giving the goods away, though. \nTo figure out who to charge, and how much, Amazon will identify shoppers by scanning QR codes on their phones as they walk in, and use sensors and computer vision technology to determine which items they take. \nThat might seem creepy, but it's not much more intrusive than the closed-circuit TV monitoring many stores already have in place to deter shoplifters, or the Bluetooth beacons others use to pitch up-to-the-minute offers to visitors. Whether Amazon's system is sharp-eyed enough to distinguish between a jar of strawberry jelly and a jar of raspberry in the same way that a clerk with a regular barcode reader can distinguish between codes 051500001639 and 051500022030 remains to be seen. \nFor now, only Amazon staff can shop at the 180-square-meter Go store, but early next year it will be ready to sell ready-made snacks and staples such as bread and milk to anyone -- anyone with the Amazon Go app running on a compatible smartphone, that is. NEWSLETTERS: Get the latest tech news sent directly to your in-box \nPayment is automatically deducted from the associated credit card when a shopper leaves the store, and the receipt is sent to the app. \nWith robots already able to mop the floor, and the shelf-stacking problem almost solved by entrants to the Amazon Picking Challenge , the employee-free grocery store may not be far away.

India, for which the company announced a $3 billion investment earlier this year, is the fastest growing geography for Amazon globally. “From impact perspective, we had to switch off cash on delivery or CoD for 48 hours when old notes were being transitioned out, and we had a short term impact during that time. Since then, we have seen tremendous adoption by customers for electronic payment method at the doorstep…that has gone up 10 times,” Amit Agarwal, VP",

      "text": "Turn on tldr \nAmazon is reportedly launching a cloud-based header-bidding solution , aimed at competing with Google. Details of the product are sparse, but the theory is that it would be Amazon’s first wrapper tag, which can be embedded on publishers pages. \nNewspaper publishers including MailOnline and Trinity Mirror have been using Amazon’s header-bidding technology for the last two years. Nat Poulter, programmatic director at MailOnline, said an Amazon cloud-based wrapper tag would provide more opportunity for publishers to access “unique and differentiated” demand, compared to other exchanges, in what’s become a highly commoditized SSP landscape. \n“Amazon has never been keen to work through a third-party wrapper because potentially there is a risk that its unique understanding of user value can be reverse-engineered and captured by competitors,” he said. “It makes sense that it build its own wrapper. It makes sense for publishers to work closely with Amazon as a buyer. We’ve been using A9’s header bidder for years with success.” Advertisement \nThat said, there would be certain conditions for this to work. For starters, Amazon would need to aggregate all demand from across the entire digital ad ecosystem and run it server side for it to be truly valuable, according to Poulter. \n“They are going to come across the same issues Google and OpenX are having,” he said. “There is very little collaboration or cooperation in ad tech right now, and, as such, everything is grinding to a halt.” \nHeader bidding, which allows buyers to bid on online ads simultaneously , is popular among publishers. MailOnline has claimed programmatic revenues have risen 48 percent as a direct result of using header bidding, and CNN International has also seen rises, as has Trinity Mirror. \n“We have seen double-digit uplifts in eCPMs, so the concept works for us, but we still have some way to go to be truly holistic across every ad sell,” said Rob Bradley, CNN International’s vp of digital commercial strategy and revenue. He added that CNN International would be open to anything that can further prove programmatic yields, including Amazon’s solution, as long as it doesn’t overcrowd its existing ad stack. \nAnd yet, other publishers like the Financial Times have held back due to the page-latency issues header bidding causes. Anthony Hitchings, the FT’s digital advertising operations director, is skeptical about the tech’s promise. \n“Header bidding is a fix to a symptom rather than the root cause, which is the second-price auction,” he said. \nMeanwhile, Amir Malik, Trinity Mirror’s programmatic chief, is wary that Amazon’s move could just cede more control to a third ad tech giant outside Google and Facebook, which already dominate digital ad spend. \n“It could be the staging ground for Amazon’s launch as a major digital supply channel to the agencies. We want to tackle the duopoly, but is it wise to create a ‘triopoly’ with another walled garden?” he said. \nAnd there are also potential conflicts of interest. Amazon buys a lot of advertising itself. “What happens if Facebook, which is supposedly building something too, decides to build its own wrapper and become a mediation for these auctions on the server side?” said one ad tech exec who preferred to stay anonymous. “Do you really want Google, Facebook and Amazon executing your header auctions as they have their own media businesses and, so, effectively compete with publishers?” \nIt’s not all rosy when it comes to header bidding. As more demand sources crowd into a header-bidding tags and wrappers, the higher the risk of latencies, both in the bidding windows and in page loads. “A single DSP can see a single impression from a publisher using header bidding 87 times within 300 milliseconds,” said Dan Wilson, vp of monetization at mobile ad tech firm Blis. \nThat volume of impressions also leads to higher ad-server infrastructure costs. But Amazon’s cloud computing services could drastically offset the creeping issue of page latency and bid latencies that header bidding causes when numerous demand sources are all bidding simultaneously, according to ad tech execs. \n“I have to welcome the increased competition from Amazon and the shift to server side which will reduce the latency,” said Hitchings. \nIn theory, Amazon’s e-commerce data, which includes everything from delivery to credit card and online behavioral data, would make for very rich bids if it was able to match them with publisher audiences, according to Blis’ Wilson. \n“If I was an SSP, I would be very afraid if Amazon have cracked header bidding with first-party data merged with shopping intent data. Given they own AWS, their own infrastructure costs are a fraction of anyone else’s, so they will be able to handle the volume with ease,” he said. Related",

      "text": "Amazon Go Store Is Checkout Free Posted: NEW YORK - \nAmazon is testing a grocery store model in Seattle that works without checkout lines. \nCalled Amazon Go, shoppers scan their Amazon app when they enter the store, and then sensors register items that shoppers pick up and automatically charge them to the Amazon app. \nIf a shopper puts the item back they aren't charged. \nThe store offers ready-to-eat meals, staples like bread and milk and meal-making kits. \nThe store is in testing and is open to Amazon employees on a trial run. It is expected to open to the public in early 2017. \nThe e-commerce powerhouse has also been dipping its toe into the physical realm. It has opened three bookstores in California, Oregon and Washington with traditional check outs. Two more are in the works in Illinois and Massachusetts. \nCowen & Co. analyst John Blackledge says the new grocery store is just one way that Amazon has been setting its sights on the food and beverage category, a lucrative $795 billion market. It also offers grocery delivery in some markets and Prime Now for last-minute items delivered in one or two hours. \n\"We are encouraged by Amazon's growing footprint in this category, which we see as ripe for potential disruption given younger demos increasingly purchasing food and beverage grocery items via digital channels,\" Blackledge said. \nAmazon.com Inc. shares rose $18.69, or 2.5 percent, to $759.03 in afternoon trading Monday. Its shares are up almost 13 percent since a year ago. \nCopyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.",

      "text": "Youtube Amazon Go is a grocery store that requires no checkout \nAmazon has taken wraps off Amazon Go, a new kind of grocery store that eliminates the checkout process. The US based retail giant has opened its first Amazon Go store in Seattle that allows customers to just shop for the item they want and leave without waiting in a checkout line. It will open to the public in early 2017. \nThe Amazon Go store, uses sensors to detect what items shoppers have picked off the shelves and sends a bill to their Amazon accounts if they do not replace them. The store uses same tech that is used in self-driving cars such as computer vision, sensor fusion, and deep learning. Dubbed as “Just Walk Out”, the technology automatically detects when products are taken from or returned to the shelves and keeps track of them in a virtual cart. After you are done shopping, you can just leave the store and Amazon will charge your account and send you a receipt. \nIn order to use this service, users will need an Amazon account, a supported smartphone, and the free Amazon Go app. Author: Sneha Bokil Sneha Bokil is a tech enthusiast and is currently using Nexus 5X but she still treasures her Nokia N70 (M).

Posted Dec. 5, 2016 Video by Tim Shortt, FLORIDA TODAY Palm Bay Police rescued a 3-year-old from a canal. The boy was stuck in the muck of the canal after disappearing from his home. (Photo: Palm Bay Police Department & Jessica's Microsoft Paint Skillz) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE Palm Bay Police save the day \nCue the heart attack. A 3-year-old boy went missing in Palm Bay. It's every mother's worst nightmare. You look away for 10 seconds and your threenager has pulled a Sabrina the Teenage Witch and poofed out of sight. \nSo the mom calls the police immediately. Gold star for that, mom. Gold star. \nThe police arrive in a matter of minutes and start scouring the surrounding area looking for the boy. They first check for any body of water. Pools, retention ponds, a canal? Bingo. Found him. \nThe boy is standing waste deep in a nearby canal. Cue heart attack No. 2. Every mother's next worst nightmare: Losing your kid and finding them in a canal. Hello alligators. Hello death trap. Hello epic threat of drowning. \nBut worry no more, Palm Bay mama. Within 10 minutes of the initial call, police carefully snatched up the boy out of the mucky water and handed him back to his mom, who by this point probably needed oxygen. The boy was unharmed, but in desperate need of a bath because we all know the word \"water\" should be used loosely in regard to what's in those canals. \nAnd as for the PBPD, Bette Midlers for all of you: Share Do you agree with the College Football Playoff Committee's Top 4 teams? Time_Sports \nLet me preface this with one major factoid: I am an Ohio State fan through and through. I was born on campus of the university. My mom worked there. My dad taught there. My sister went to school there. I'm originally from Columbus. Other than tattooing it across my forehead, it's safe to say I've grown up bleeding scarlet and gray. \nProof: \nJust rolling around in The Shoe. NBD. (Photo: Jessica's mom) \nBut this college football playoff system makes absolutely no sense and can someone please pull out the soapbox for a minute because I have words. \nThe College Football Playoff committee selected the four top teams that will face off for the national title . They are as follows: No.1 Alabama, No. 2 Clemson, No. 3 Ohio State and No. 4 Washington. No. 1 Alabama will play No. 4 Washington in the Peach Bowl. No. 2 Clemson and No. 3 Ohio State will face off in the Fiesta Bowl.(Side note: anyone remember when UCF played in the Fiesta Bowl and BEAT BAYLOR. Sorry, still living in our 15 seconds of fame.) The winners from both of those bowls will play each other for the title. OK, so that's all well and great. You have four extremely talented teams in the running for the big win, but one of those teams did not win their conference. Here's looking at you, Buckeyes. Penn State was ousted from the playoffs, even though they not only beat Ohio State but won the Big 12 Conference. Wait, what? How are these teams selected for the playoffs again? I looked it up. It's determined by four main things: Championships won, strength of schedule, head-to-head competition (if it occurred) and comparative outcomes of common opponents. \nIn other words, it looks a little something like this: Wordpress \nWhile I'm stoked that my Buckeyes are in the running yet again, what the heck is up with these rules? Will an underdog ever make it to the top? What about smaller, not-so-good teams with high hopes? (cough, cough UCF) I'm not so sure. It seems the big boys will forever run the system, which makes the entire league a little underwhelming. Why isn't the league set up like college basketball? So it seems winning a conference should mean something, anything. And in the case of the football playoffs, it just doesn't? \nI digress",

      "text": "By Reuters / Reuters | December 6, 2016 : 12:43 PM MYT (Dec 5): Amazon.com Inc said on Monday it has opened a brick-and-mortar grocery store in Seattle without lines or checkout counters, kicking off new competition with supermarket chains.\nAmazon Go, the online shopping company's new 1,800-square-foot (167-square-meter) store, uses sensors to detect what items shoppers have picked off the shelves and sends a bill to their Amazon accounts if they do not replace them.\nThe store marks Amazon's latest push into groceries, one of the biggest retail categories it has yet to master. The company currently delivers produce and groceries to homes through its AmazonFresh service.\n\"It's a great recognition that their e-commerce model doesn't work for every product,\" said analyst Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research, noting that physical stores would complement AmazonFresh.\n\"If there were hundreds of these stores around the country, it would be a huge threat\" to supermarket chains, he said.\nThe S&P 1500 food retail index, which includes Kroger Co, Whole Foods Market Inc and other companies, was down 0.5% at the close. Shares of Amazon closed up about 2.6%.\nAmazon Go is available now for employees of the company and is expected to be open to the public early next year, Amazon said.\nIf tests are successful, Amazon plans to open more than 2,000 grocery stores, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday, citing sources. The company is considering other store formats, including one that would let drivers pick up goods at the curbside, the report said.\nAmazon declined to comment on the report.\n\"The checkout lines are always the most inefficient parts of the store experience,\" said Neil Saunders, managing director of retail research firm Conlumino. \"Not only would you save a lot on labor costs, you actually would make the process much quicker for consumers and much more satisfying.\"\nStill, the grab-and-go experience would take getting used to, he said.\nSome people may \"feel like they stole\" an item, Saunders said.\nApart from groceries such as bread and milk, the store also offers ready-to-eat meals made fresh by on-site chefs and local kitchens and bakeries, Amazon said.\nThat would make Amazon Go a potential competitor to fast-casual dining chains like Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc as well.\nAmazon Go is not the first physical store for the e-commerce company to open.\nIt has a book store in Seattle, as well as pop-ups at malls where it displays Amazon devices such as the Kindle.\nhttp://www.theedgemarkets.com/en/article/amazon-opens-line-free-grocery-store-challenge-supermarkets\n Good Articles to Share >>\nApple Watch sales to consumers set record in holiday week, says Apple's Cook - Dec 06, 2016 Mavcom to introduce framework linking aeronautical revenues to customer satisfaction - Dec 06, 2016 Competition to intensify for telcos in 2017, says U Mobile - Dec 06, 2016 China-led Asia trade talks should wrap up with speed, ADB says - Dec 06, 2016 Four trends that will affect global banks in 2017 - Dec 06, 2016 MIDF Research downgrades glove sector to 'neutral' - Dec 06, 2016",

Customers won't have to stand in line, and critically, they won't have to interact with a cashier.\nThat's great news for Amazon customers who detest human interaction or waiting , but it's bad news for cashiers, a critical part of the US workforce, and it highlights the challenge Donald Trump will face as he bids to boost the US labor market.\nDuring his campaign, Trump pledged to \" bring back the jobs \" by cutting taxes and regulation and pulling out of trade deals . Free trade agreements such as the North American Free Trade Agreement or Trans Pacific Partnership allowed companies to shift jobs overseas to places like Mexico and China and decimate the middle class, he said.\nThe argument struck a chord, particularly with white working class voters , propelling Trump to the White House.\n© Provided by Business Insider trump carrier More recently, he has threatened to clamp down on companies moving jobs overseas .\nDespite the convincing nature of Trump's anti-offshoring argument, Amazon Go proves the biggest danger isn't jobs going overseas, but rather the march of technological progress.\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics , 856,850 Americans were employed as grocery store cashiers in May 2015, the most recent data available. Theoretically, Amazon Go's model grocery store puts a chunk of these jobs at risk. Include all cashiers (there doesn't seem to be a reason the Amazon Go model couldn't work for say, clothes or books) and that's roughly 3.5 million people in roles that are at risk of being automated away.\n© Provided by Business Insider walmart checkout cashier shopping To put that into perspective, t he World Trade Organization estimated that between 2001 and 2013 the US had lost 3.2 million jobs due to outsourcing to China. This isn't an apples to apples comparison, but the numbers are striking.\nThat's not to say that every cashier job is going to disappear overnight. Amazon is only opening a pilot Go store in Seattle next year. And cashier jobs have held remarkably steady of the last decade, even as online shopping became the dominant trend in retail.\nThe change, however, highlights the ever-shifting landscape of the American workforce.\nThis point isn't a new one. Everyone from liberal, Nobel-winning economist Paul Krugman to Republican Senator Ben Sasse have noted that technological developments are a bigger threat to American workers than trade. The World Economic Forum estimated 5 million jobs in 15 developed economies are at risk of automation by 2020 and Citi projected that 57% of jobs in OECD nations are at risk of automation.\nIn heavy manufacturing, jobs once done by multiple humans are being replaced by robots. Panera Bread is trying out machines that take and deliver your order, all without a human server. Even in journalism there are programs that are starting to automate simple article writing.\n© Provided by Business Insider howard marks Howard Marks, the founder of investment firm Oaktree Capital, riffed on this topic earlier this year, pointing out that US manufacturing output is near an all-time high, even though US manufacturing employment is down 37% since the peak in 1979.\n\"Perhaps if the government wants to preserve jobs it should just outlaw productivity gains,\" he said .\nThat, of course, isn't feasible. There is likely a long-run benefit to making processes more affordable and quicker.\nRather, the point is that refocusing the labor market on the jobs and skills that will be needed in the future is a productive way to allow innovation and keep American employed.\nThat kind of policy was barely mentioned in Trump's campaign. In fact, the president-elect hardly mentioned the issue of technological advances destroying jobs at all, so it appears to be a huge blind spot in his proposed economic plan.\nTrump is focused on the wrong problem when it comes to the labor market. Instead of getting old manufacturing jobs back from overseas, the government should be focused on retraining workers for the new labor market.\nNOW WATCH: Here's how much you need to make to be in the top 1% of every state\nGo to MSN Home",

      "text": "StormProof Launches “Unbreakable” Travel Umbrella on Amazon Posted on by admin Compact and windproof, StormProof’s new travel umbrella is claimed to be indestructible, even in strong wind. This windproof umbrella is now for sale on Amazon at https://goo.gl/YhI3Gr . But for the holidays is now offer a coupon so that you can get the umbrella at 54% off ! Enter promo code : AJ82C38A at checkout. StormProof Umbrellas has recently announced the launch of their new travel umbrella on Amazon.com . The latest launch by the company is a windproof portable umbrella that is deemed to be unbreakable even in the strongest wind. The umbrella has a one-hand operation, thanks to its automatic open and close function, and is made from the highly durable 190T Pongee fabric. Even though this portable umbrella by StormProof is small enough to fit in a purse, tote, pocket or glove compartment of a car when telescoped, it opens to an expansive diameter of 38 inches, which is wide enough to keep a person and whatever he or she is carrying completely dry. “If you’ve ever had to throw an umbrella in the trash because it blew inside out on a windy day and broke, then we know you’ll appreciate the ‘Unbreakable’ construction of our StormProof umbrella, because it means that you will stay dry and safe,” states Chris Johnston, founder of StormProof Umbrellas. “Our umbrella opens and closes automatically at the touch of a button, because we know you don’t want to be struggling when it suddenly pours down and you’re busy carrying your shopping.” The Indestructible Umbrella According to quality tests done by TUV Rheinland, a global certification provider, the StormProof “unbreakable” umbrella can withstand winds up to 90mph. Due to the umbrella’s unique construction, it is highly robust and guarantees complete protection to its owner. Made with black-coated metal shaft and frame, the umbrella has 8 fiberglass ribs that provide it with exceptional flexibility to return to its original position without breaking. StormProof umbrella’s canopy opens to a generous 38-inch diameter of the heavy-duty and endurable cover of 190T Pongee fabric, which is a soft-woven cloth made especially for high performance umbrellas and other waterproof equipment. Despite its expansive covering, the umbrella weighs only 13 ounces and measures 11.4 x 2.4 x 1.1 inches when folded, making it perfect for being carried around even in small purses and bags. The umbrella’s automatic open and close at the touch of a button provides a one-hand function that is not only convenient but also eliminates the need for fumbling with the umbrella in the case of a sudden downpour. About the Company StormProof Umbrellas was established in 2016 in New Orleans, USA. The concept and design of an unbreakable umbrella that would serve hundreds of thousands of people all around the globe was conceived by Christopher Johnston, who is the founder of the company. The team at StormProof Umbrellas believes in the manufacturing of high quality gear and the extension of exceptional customer service to all its clients. StormProof’s “unbreakable” umbrella can be found on Amazon at https://goo.gl/YhI3Gr for a limited period introductory price of $19.99. But for the holidays is now offer a coupon so that you can get the umbrella at 54% off ! Enter promo code : AJ82C38A at checkout. \nMedia Contact",

      "title": "Amazon Go's cool, but we'd like 5 other physical stores",
      "text": "Amazon Go imagines the future of grocery stores Amazon is expanding its grocery services into the real world with a grab-and-go store that will make cash registers obsolete.\nby Vanessa Hand Orellana 1:04 Close Drag After months of speculation that Amazon would launch some sort of new real-world stores , the company announced Amazon Go on Monday.\nThe brick-and-mortar stores will require no human interaction. Instead, an Amazon Go app will let you into the small convenience store, keep track of what you take off the shelves and then charge it all to your Amazon account. No check-out, no lines, no jobs for cashiers.\nThe concept is cool and all, but we came up with a few other currently online-only companies we'd really like to see take the brick-and-mortar plunge:\nInstagram: Just admit it, when you pick the perfect filter for that shot of wildflowers in bloom on your latest hike or yet another colorful sunset, you fantasize about your smartphone creation being ogled in a prestigious gallery. There are already plenty of ways to get physical prints of your best 'grams, but you know that if each town had a real-world gallery showing the best shots from its user base we'd all become even more obsessed with picking just the right filter.\nBest beach ever.\nA photo posted by Eric Mack (@ericcmack) on Dec 31, 2013 at 10:15pm PST\nEtsy: Look out, local craft fairs. If we really wanted to bring back local economies across the country, an Etsy storefront in each community could really put every town's untapped talent on display. Distribution would obviously need to be worked out to get all those nifty handmade goods onto shelves, but even a few regional real-world warehouse stores could go a long way to finding plenty of hip holiday gifts in one stop.\nPinterest: I know some of you have dreams about this. How great would it be to just reach into your phone's screen and grab all those perfect meals and home improvement projects from your Pinterest board and bring them into your life? A physical Pinterest superstore along the same lines as Ikea could put the Swedish home furnishing giant to shame. If you could get an amazing fat-burning chicken salad while picking up everything you need for your dream DIY bathroom makeover , why would you shop anywhere else? It's like Martha Stewart was crowdsourced.\nYouTube: Don't worry. I'm not talking about bringing back Blockbuster. But isn't it a little annoying when you have to crowd around your friend's five-inch smartphone screen to analyze the latest viral Bigfoot video ? Hey Google, how about installing \"YouTube Cinema\" booths across the US? Kind of like the private rooms popular in Japanese karaoke bars, these could be meeting places equipped with everything you need to experience what's trending. But you'd see it in widescreen, quantum dot HD with surround sound or even 3D (all connected to a Chromecast , no doubt) in the case of nifty videos like this one NASA shot on the International Space Station .\nGoogle: While you're at it, Google, why not set up a real-world version of your central offering? Walk into a store, type in what you're looking for and it magically appears, right alongside tons of other offerings that are not at all what you were looking for.\nSo maybe this one isn't the best idea, but it's still preferable to any real-world experience I could come up with for Facebook or Twitter, which would certainly just turn into stores full of customers shouting at each other.\n ",

      "text": "Home > Internet > Amazon rolls out Launchpad to support startups in India Amazon rolls out Launchpad to support startups in India | 0 Comments \nUS-based Amazon Inc’s India subsidiary on Monday announced that it will be launching its global programme for startups Amazon Launchpad here. \nUnder this programme, Indian startups can market their products to Amazon customers across the country and the world through an e-store, the company said in a statement. \nFor this, Amazon has tied up with the Indian government’s Startup India initiative, software and startup lobby NASSCOM’s 10,000 Startups programme and Indian Angel Network to identify and enroll emerging firms on the e-commerce site. \nBesides these, Amazon Launchpad works with more than 100 venture capital firms, crowd-funding services, accelerators and incubators globally. In India, it has partnered with NITI Aayog, the governments of Maharashtra and Telangana and entrepreneur community The Indus Entrepreneurs (TiE). \nThe Amazon Launchpad store, which features over 400 products ranging from wearable technology to educational toys, has seen 25 Indian startups joining the programme even before the launch, the company claimed. \nThese startups include Internet-of-Things (IoT) firm Witworks, wearable safety-tech startup Leaf Wearables, airline catering software firm Seventhsense Technologies and interactive footwear startup Ducere Technologies. \nStartups from across India can join Amazon Launchpad, and to get listed the firms must have products that are compliant with Amazon’s policies. \n“The biggest roadblock for a hardware startup is not product development but finding early adopters for its product. Amazon Launchpad is just the right platform to find them. We can expect this to be a game changer for India and the hardware startup ecosystem,” said Paras Batra, director of sales and marketing at Leaf Wearables, in a statement. \nAmazon is engaged in a fierce battle with local rivals Flipkart and Snapdeal to gain dominance in India’s e-commerce market. The firm has launched a number of initiatives to strengthen its India play. Last week, in a move to grow its presence in the fashion segment, Amazon India introduced its second in-house private fashion label, Myx, an ethnic wear label for women . \nIn October, the firm launched its ‘Global Store’ to give Indian customers direct access to products on its US website. \nDuring the Diwali festive sales, though Flipkart came ahead by selling 15.5 million units, Amazon India was not far behind, having sold 15 million units . \nAhead of Diwali, Amazon India introduced its flagship Prime membership service for the Indian market, promising to deliver products within a day or two . \n ",

      "text": "AFP |   \nIn the concept store in Amazon’s hometown of Seattle, Washington, customers can fill their shopping carts and walk out — with the costs tallied up and billed on their accounts with the US online giant. (AFP) \nSAN FRANCISCO: Amazon on Monday unveiled a new kind of retail store, with no cashiers.In the concept store in Amazon’s hometown of Seattle, Washington, customers can fill their shopping carts and walk out — with the costs tallied up and billed on their accounts with the US online giant.Amazon Go, which is being tested in a single store with Amazon employees and will open to the public next year, is a “checkout-free shopping experience made possible by the same types of technologies used in self-driving cars: computer vision, sensor fusion, and deep learning,” its web page says.“Our Just Walk Out technology automatically detects when products are taken from or returned to the shelves and keeps track of them in a virtual cart. When you’re done shopping, you can just leave the store. Shortly after, we’ll charge your Amazon account and send you a receipt.”The store in Seattle of some 170 square meters (1,800 square feet) is selling a variety of food products including breads, cheeses and ready-to-eat meals, as well as Amazon Meal Kits, which has the ingredients for home-cooked dishes.It was not immediately clear whether Amazon will expand this model with more physical stores or offer the technology to other retailers.The online giant has been rumored to be looking at creating brick-and-mortar outlets but so far has only announced a handful of bookselling outlets.

Customers won't have to stand in line, and critically, they won't have to interact with a cashier.\nThat's great news for Amazon customers who detest human interaction or waiting , but it's bad news for cashiers, a critical part of the US workforce, and it highlights the challenge Donald Trump will face as he bids to boost the US labor market.\nDuring his campaign, Trump pledged to \" bring back the jobs \" by cutting taxes and regulation and pulling out of trade deals . Free trade agreements such as the North American Free Trade Agreement or Trans Pacific Partnership allowed companies to shift jobs overseas to places like Mexico and China and decimate the middle class, he said.\nThe argument struck a chord, particularly with white working class voters , propelling Trump to the White House.\n© Provided by Business Insider trump carrier More recently, he has threatened to clamp down on companies moving jobs overseas .\nDespite the convincing nature of Trump's anti-offshoring argument, Amazon Go proves the biggest danger isn't jobs going overseas, but rather the march of technological progress.\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics , 856,850 Americans were employed as grocery store cashiers in May 2015, the most recent data available. Theoretically, Amazon Go's model grocery store puts a chunk of these jobs at risk. Include all cashiers (there doesn't seem to be a reason the Amazon Go model couldn't work for say, clothes or books) and that's roughly 3.5 million people in roles that are at risk of being automated away.\n© Provided by Business Insider walmart checkout cashier shopping To put that into perspective, t he World Trade Organization estimated that between 2001 and 2013 the US had lost 3.2 million jobs due to outsourcing to China. This isn't an apples to apples comparison, but the numbers are striking.\nThat's not to say that every cashier job is going to disappear overnight. Amazon is only opening a pilot Go store in Seattle next year. And cashier jobs have held remarkably steady of the last decade, even as online shopping became the dominant trend in retail.\nThe change, however, highlights the ever-shifting landscape of the American workforce.\nThis point isn't a new one. Everyone from liberal, Nobel-winning economist Paul Krugman to Republican Senator Ben Sasse have noted that technological developments are a bigger threat to American workers than trade. The World Economic Forum estimated 5 million jobs in 15 developed economies are at risk of automation by 2020 and Citi projected that 57% of jobs in OECD nations are at risk of automation.\nIn heavy manufacturing, jobs once done by multiple humans are being replaced by robots. Panera Bread is trying out machines that take and deliver your order, all without a human server. Even in journalism there are programs that are starting to automate simple article writing.\n© Provided by Business Insider howard marks Howard Marks, the founder of investment firm Oaktree Capital, riffed on this topic earlier this year, pointing out that US manufacturing output is near an all-time high, even though US manufacturing employment is down 37% since the peak in 1979.\n\"Perhaps if the government wants to preserve jobs it should just outlaw productivity gains,\" he said .\nThat, of course, isn't feasible. There is likely a long-run benefit to making processes more affordable and quicker.\nRather, the point is that refocusing the labor market on the jobs and skills that will be needed in the future is a productive way to allow innovation and keep American employed.\nThat kind of policy was barely mentioned in Trump's campaign. In fact, the president-elect hardly mentioned the issue of technological advances destroying jobs at all, so it appears to be a huge blind spot in his proposed economic plan.\nTrump is focused on the wrong problem when it comes to the labor market. Instead of getting old manufacturing jobs back from overseas, the government should be focused on retraining workers for the new labor market.\nNOW WATCH: Here's how much you need to make to be in the top 1% of every state\nGo to MSN Home",

      "text": "By Jing Cao Bloomberg News This article was published today at 1:57 a.m. a A Font Size \nAmazon.com on Monday unveiled technology that will let shoppers grab groceries without having to scan and pay for them -- eliminating the checkout line. \nThe company is testing the new system at what it's calling an Amazon Go store in Seattle, which will open to the public early next year. Customers will be able to scan their phones at the entrance using a new Amazon Go mobile app. Then the technology will track what items they pick up or even return to the shelves and add them to a virtual shopping cart in real time, according a video Amazon posted on YouTube. Once the customers exit the store, they'll be charged on their Amazon account automatically. \nAmazon has been experimenting with the grocery business since 2007 when it started AmazonFresh in the Seattle area, where the company is based. The service offers doorstep delivery of a limited selection of groceries in 16 U.S. markets, including Los Angeles, New York and Boston as well as London. \nAmazon is also building facilities that let shoppers pull in and pick up groceries ordered online. Now the company, which already operates a few book and college-campus stores, is testing a kind of convenience store. \n\"This is part of its efforts to do everything possible to make the Amazon name synonymous with retail, whether it's online or offline,\" said James Cakmak, an analyst at Monness Crespi Hardt & Co. \"This is another test in figuring out what works and what doesn't in the retail environment.\" \nAmazon employees are testing out the 1,800-square-foot Seattle store, where they can buy ready-to-eat breakfast, lunch, dinner and snack options as well as grocery essentials from bread and milk to artisanal cheeses and locally made chocolate. Also available: Amazon Meal Kits, containing all the ingredients needed to make a meal for two in 30 minutes. \nTrying to eliminate checkout lines isn't a novel concept, though most systems so far still involve an extra step for customers at the end: actually checking out in some way. \nRetailers for years have tried various technologies to make the shopping process smoother and easier. Stop and Shop customers in some stores can use bar code-scanning guns that calculate the total cart cost as they add items. But people still have to go to a checkout station at the end to upload their bill and pay, or hand the scanner over to a cashier, which could still entail waiting in line. \nOther retailers have installed self-checkout computer systems that are known to be slow and buggy. Apple in 2011 rolled out a feature on its Apple Store app, which lets people pay for items at company stores without a register or a clerk -- though this still requires manually scanning the goods. \nAmazon says its \"Just Walk Out\" technology will use a combination of artificial intelligence software -- including computer vision algorithms that enable machines to identify images -- and sensors. The company said it started the project four years ago. \nBusiness on 12/06/2016 Print Headline: Amazon supermarket experiment eliminates checkout line ADVERTISEMENT",

      "text": "No lines. No checkouts. … No cashier jobs? On Monday morning, Amazon unveiled its new vision for the future of brick-and-mortar grocery stores: Amazon Go.\nThe new service offered by the online-shopping colossus allows customers to walk into the store, grab what they want and simply leave the building — without interacting with another human being or waiting in line.\nAmazon says the company brought together the most advanced machine learning and artificial intelligence to eliminate cash registers in a new 1,800-square-foot store in Seattle.\nAmazon Go is already open to Amazon employees through its beta program and is scheduled to open to the public in early 2017.\nAs seen in a video released by the company, shoppers scan a code from the Amazon Go app on their smartphones at a kiosk and then proceed to fill up their carts. The video’s narrator says that a virtual cart automatically registers every time a customer picks up or puts down an item and that Amazon accounts are only charged once someone leaves the store.\n“We used computer vision, deep-learning algorithms and sensor fusion much like you’d find in self-driving cars. We call it “Just Walk Out Technology,’” he says.\nAccording to Amazon, the store will offer ready-to-eat breakfast, lunch, dinner and snack options, as well as grocery essentials like bread and milk. It is located at 2131 Seventh Avenue in Seattle.\nReaction to the e-commerce giant’s new technology is unsurprisingly split between people who are impressed with the convenience and those alarmed by what this means for cashiers, one of the most common occupations in the United States. If this innovation is broadly adopted, it would drastically change the landscape of the retail industry.\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that there are 3,478,420 cashiers in the U.S. earning a mean hourly wage of $10.09 per hour.\nAn Amazon spokesperson referred Yahoo News to the company’s announcement about the new store.\n“Four years ago, we asked ourselves: What if we could create a shopping experience with no lines and no checkout?” the website reads in part. “Could we push the boundaries of computer vision and machine learning to create a store where customers could simply take what they want and go? Our answer to those questions is Amazon Go and Just Walk Out Shopping.”",

      "text": "Amazon Go Is A New Way To Shop For Groceries (Video) 8:15 am By Roland Hutchinson \nGrocery shopping can be a job which takes a while, especially if there are long queues and Amazon is looking to launch a new grocery store which would get rid of the queues and the checkouts called Amazon Go. \nThe company has released a video which show how Amazon Go works, you walk into the store place the items in your bag and walk out, they are then charged to your Amazon account. \nAmazon Go is a new kind of store with no checkout required. We created the world’s most advanced shopping technology so you never have to wait in line. With our Just Walk Out Shopping experience, simply use the Amazon Go app to enter the store, take the products you want, and go! No lines, no checkout. (No, seriously.) \nAs we can see from the video this seems a lot easier than the current system where you have to go through a checkout with either a cashier or one of the self checkouts. \nAmazon is expected to launch its Go stores next year, it looks like they will be available in the US at first, if they become popular, Amazon could expand to more countries.",

      "text": "Jason Fox's 'Ricky Nelson: How I Learned The Truth About His Last Days' Hits #1 On Amazon   \n\"Ricky Nelson: How I Learned the Truth About His Final Days,\" is a revelatory true account about industry-outsider Jason Fox's disastrous attempt to create the book and screenplay of Ricky Nelson's musical comeback with Ricky's best friend, Jamie Fresh. \nAs Rick's confidante, Fresh alone knew the shocking truth about why Rick died in a 1985 plane crash. Together, he and Fox were going to set the record straight. Instead, the emotionally unstable Fresh sabotaged the celebrity-endorsed, multi-million-dollar project, cheating all the investors out of their money. \nNobody suffered more than Fox who lost hundreds of thousands of dollars and his girlfriend; now more than a decade later, Fox has come forward to expose the inside story of what really happened to Ricky and how it all went wrong. \nAbout Author Jason Fox: Jason Fox was born in Dublin, Ireland and immigrated with his parents to the United States as a young child. He is a Senior Mortgage Loan Consultant with a Private Bank and has served as an expert witness in his field multiple times. He currently lives in Orange County with his wife, 2 children and 4 cats - yes 4. This book was on hold for over a decade and lived only in the author's memory until now. The culmination of writing this book has finally brought him closure to a volatile time that has dominated almost half of his lifetime.",

New Delhi: E-commerce giant Amazon today rolled out its global programme 'Launchpad' in India to provide startups in the country a platform to market, sell and deliver products across the globe.\nIndia is the seventh country where Amazon Launchpad has been made available, and the platform, \"tailormade\" for startups, is available for a fee of Rs 5,000 a month.

      "text": "Google \nSEATTLE -- Amazon has gone after book stores, retail chains and electronics shops. Now it's taking on grocery stores, with a twist. \nAmazon unveiled in a video a new physical store on Monday that sells a mix of \"grocery essentials\" and ready-made meals. But the key selling point is what it doesn't have: checkout lines. \nThe video shows how customers check in at the entrance of the store with a new app called Amazon Go, then grab whatever items are needed. Amazon claims it can track the items automatically through a combination of computer vision and deep learning technologies. When you're done shopping, you just walk out. \nThe first store is located in Seattle, where Amazon is headquartered. \nFor years, there have been rumors the e-commerce company would expand its dominance from digital to physical shopping. Amazon began experimenting with physical bookstores a year ago, but Amazon Go may mark its boldest bet on bricks-and-mortar yet. \nBy eliminating much of the staff needed to operate a store, Amazon keeps costs lower than traditional competitors. It's also in a strong position to bring together data on its customers shopping habits online and offline to make better suggestions in all situations. \nHowever, Amazon's move deeper into physical retail shops comes in a sensitive political climate. The company could be perceived as being a threat to some of the 3.4 million Americans who work as cashiers, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. \nOn the campaign trail, Donald Trump repeatedly criticized Amazon and its founder Jeff Bezos for \"getting away with murder tax-wise\" and having \"a huge antitrust problem.\" Will the President-elect add \"job killer\" to the list of criticisms? \nAmazon's effort to launch a new kind of retail store predates the rise of Donald Trump. \n\"Four years ago we asked ourselves: what if we could create a shopping experience with no lines and no checkout? Could we push the boundaries of computer vision and machine learning to create a store where customers could simply take what they want and go?\" the company says on an informational page about Amazon Go. \nFor now, Amazon is starting slow. The first store is only open to Amazon employees and will not be an option for the general public until early next year. 47.606209 -122.332071 ",

      "text": "Amazon testing cashier-free retail store - Yahoo New Zealand San Francisco (AFP) - Amazon has unveiled a new kind of retail store, with no cashiers. \nCustomers at the concept store in Amazon's hometown of Seattle, Washington, can fill their shopping carts and walk out -- with the costs automatically tallied up and billed to their accounts with the US online giant. \nAmazon Go, which is being tested with Amazon employees and will open to the public next year, is a \"checkout-free shopping experience made possible by the same types of technologies used in self-driving cars: computer vision, sensor fusion and deep learning,\" its webpage said. \n\"Our Just Walk Out technology automatically detects when products are taken from or returned to the shelves and keeps track of them in a virtual cart. When you're done shopping, you can just leave the store. Shortly after, we'll charge your Amazon account and send you a receipt.\" \nThe 1,800-square-foot (170-square-meter) store is selling a variety of food products, including bread, cheeses and ready-to-eat meals, as well as Amazon Meal Kits, which contain ingredients for home-cooked dishes. \nIt was not immediately clear whether Amazon will expand this model with more physical stores or offer the technology to other retailers. \nThe online giant has been rumored to be looking at creating brick-and-mortar stores but so far has only announced a handful of outlets selling books. \nThe Wall Street Journal cited people close to the matter as saying that Amazon Go was one of several store formats the retail giant is considering. \nTwo prototype drive-through locations in Seattle without in-store shopping options are set to open in the coming weeks, the Journal reported. \nDepending on the success of the test locations, Amazon could reportedly open more than 2,000 brick-and-mortar grocery stores under its brand. \nIf it does push forward with selling fresh food in stores, Amazon could put a lot of pressure on traditional grocers and superstores like Wal-Mart.",

Photo: Reuters Tuesday, Dec 6, 2016 \nSAN FRANCISCO- Amazon on Monday unveiled a new kind of retail store, with no cashiers. \nCustomers at the concept store in Amazon's hometown of Seattle, Washington, can fill their shopping carts and walk out - with the costs automatically tallied up and billed to their accounts with the US online giant. \nAmazon Go, which is being tested with Amazon employees and will open to the public next year, is a \"checkout-free shopping experience made possible by the same types of technologies used in self-driving cars: computer vision, sensor fusion and deep learning,\" its webpage said. \n\"Our Just Walk Out technology automatically detects when products are taken from or returned to the shelves and keeps track of them in a virtual cart. When you're done shopping, you can just leave the store. Shortly after, we'll charge your Amazon account and send you a receipt.\" \nThe 1,800-square-foot (170-square-meter) store is selling a variety of food products, including bread, cheeses and ready-to-eat meals, as well as Amazon Meal Kits, which contain ingredients for home-cooked dishes. 354851 ",

      "text": "Email \nAmazon has gone after book stores, retail chains and electronics shops. Now it’s taking on grocery stores, with a twist. Amazon has unveiled a new physical store on Dec. 5, 2016, that sells a mix of “grocery essentials” and ready-made meals. (Credit: From Amazon) \nAmazon unveiled in a video a new physical store on Monday that sells a mix of “grocery essentials” and ready-made meals. But the key selling point is what it doesn’t have: checkout lines. \nThe video shows how customers check in at the entrance of the store with a new app called Amazon Go, then grab whatever items are needed. Amazon claims it can track the items automatically through a combination of computer vision and deep learning technologies. When you’re done shopping, you just walk out. \nThe first store is located in Seattle, where Amazon is headquartered. \nFor years, there have been rumors the e-commerce company would expand its dominance from digital to physical shopping. Amazon began experimenting with physical bookstores a year ago, but Amazon Go may mark its boldest bet on bricks-and-mortar yet. \nBy eliminating much of the staff needed to operate a store, Amazon keeps costs lower than traditional competitors. It’s also in a strong position to bring together data on its customers shopping habits online and offline to make better suggestions in all situations. \nHowever, Amazon’s move deeper into physical retail shops comes in a sensitive political climate. The company could be perceived as being a threat to some of the 3.4 million Americans who work as cashiers, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. \nOn the campaign trail, Donald Trump repeatedly criticized Amazon and its founder Jeff Bezos for “getting away with murder tax-wise” and having “a huge antitrust problem.” Will the President-elect add “job killer” to the list of criticisms? \nAmazon’s effort to launch a new kind of retail store predates the rise of Donald Trump. \n“Four years ago we asked ourselves: what if we could create a shopping experience with no lines and no checkout? Could we push the boundaries of computer vision and machine learning to create a store where customers could simply take what they want and go?” the company says on an informational page about Amazon Go. \nFor now, Amazon is starting slow. The first store is only open to Amazon employees and will not be an option for the general public until early next year. 47.606209 -122.332071 ",

      "text": "Reply robertraekeenan This is a great camera. Not good in low light as it just hunts for focus. But I use this with an adapter and put some of my Canon L lenses on it and the quality of the image is brilliant. If you are familiar with Canon DSLRs you will feel right at home with this camera. This is not a 'great' camera, it's an average performing camera, but it's a very good buy for someone like yourself that has many Canon lens to utilise with the adapter. Compared to the competition it has slow focus, no 4k video or viewfinder, so-so kit lens and very limited native lens range saving grace is that it is quite cheap but down the line that could be a false economy.",

      "text": "Comment Amazon dominated the Cyber Weekend with a 30.9 percent share of online sales compared to other retail stores. Best Buy came in second with 7.4 percent from last year's 6.1 percent. Claudio Toledo via Flickr \nAmazon still reigned supreme over the Cyber Weekend among other retailers. Based on a data collected by research firm Slice Intelligence, the online shopping giant captured 31 percent of online spending. More people chose to shop in Amazon from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday than in Best Buy, Target, Wal-Mart and Apple. \nSlice Intelligence revealed that online sales over the Cyber Weekend grew from last year. Among more than 1 million online receipts that the firm scanned, Amazon dominated with 30.9 percent of sales. It was followed by Best Buy with only 7.4 percent, an increase from last year's 6.1 percent. Target came in at third with 4.4 percent, a mere 0.1 percent rise from 2015. Meanwhile, Wal-Mart suffered one percent decline with only 4.1 percent. \nAccording to CNBC , Macy's share was also down at 3.2 percent amid a massive site outage on Black Friday. Kohl's and Nordstrom are almost tied with 2.7 percent and 2.5 percent, respectively. Apple is a big winner during the Cyber Weekend as its online revenue rose from 0.9 to 1.5 percent. Unlike last year, J.Crew and Home Depot lagged behind the tech giant. \nDespite some retailers experiencing a dip in their Cyber Weekend sales, this year has set a new record online sales. Slice Intelligence shared that Black Friday sales were up 20 percent and Cyber Monday sales also grew by 10 percent. The latter one is now the biggest online shopping day in the US' history, according to Reuters . CNBC further reported that ComScore's data show that the most visited retail websites on desktop PCs and portable devices on Cyber Monday were Amazon, eBay, Wal-Mart, Kohl's and Target. Though most retailers had a big Cyber Weekend, Amazon actually had a bigger Prime Day. \nNovember has seen a 14.8 percent growth compared to last year. Adobe Digital Insights puts the number of online sales from Nov. 1 to Nov. 28 at $39.97 billion. It is a 7.6 percent surge from 2015. The data covered 80 percent of all transactions from top 100 US retailers. Likewise, Adobe estimates an 11 percent increase in online revenue for 2016. It could amount to $91.6 billion. Amazon will definitely have the biggest share again, beating out the bricks-and-mortar retail stores. \nThe success of e-commerce reflects the shift of consumers to online shopping. With the Christmas season on its way, cyber shoppers will hit the internet and look for great deals on gifts.",

Enter promo code : AJ82C38A at checkout. \nStormProof Umbrellas has recently announced the launch of their new travel umbrella on Amazon.com . The latest launch by the company is a windproof portable umbrella that is deemed to be unbreakable even in the strongest wind. The umbrella has a one-hand operation, thanks to its automatic open and close function, and is made from the highly durable 190T Pongee fabric. Even though this portable umbrella by StormProof is small enough to fit in a purse, tote, pocket or glove compartment of a car when telescoped, it opens to an expansive diameter of 38 inches, which is wide enough to keep a person and whatever he or she is carrying completely dry. \n“If you’ve ever had to throw an umbrella in the trash because it blew inside out on a windy day and broke, then we know you’ll appreciate the ‘Unbreakable’ construction of our StormProof umbrella, because it means that you will stay dry and safe,” states Chris Johnston, founder of StormProof Umbrellas. “Our umbrella opens and closes automatically at the touch of a button, because we know you don’t want to be struggling when it suddenly pours down and you’re busy carrying your shopping.” \nThe Indestructible Umbrella \nAccording to quality tests done by TUV Rheinland, a global certification provider, the StormProof “unbreakable” umbrella can withstand winds up to 90mph. Due to the umbrella’s unique construction, it is highly robust and guarantees complete protection to its owner. Made with black-coated metal shaft and frame, the umbrella has 8 fiberglass ribs that provide it with exceptional flexibility to return to its original position without breaking. \nStormProof umbrella’s canopy opens to a generous 38-inch diameter of the heavy-duty and endurable cover of 190T Pongee fabric, which is a soft-woven cloth made especially for high performance umbrellas and other waterproof equipment. Despite its expansive covering, the umbrella weighs only 13 ounces and measures 11.4 x 2.4 x 1.1 inches when folded, making it perfect for being carried around even in small purses and bags. The umbrella’s automatic open and close at the touch of a button provides a one-hand function that is not only convenient but also eliminates the need for fumbling with the umbrella in the case of a sudden downpour. \nAbout the Company \nStormProof Umbrellas was established in 2016 in New Orleans, USA. The concept and design of an unbreakable umbrella that would serve hundreds of thousands of people all around the globe was conceived by Christopher Johnston, who is the founder of the company. The team at StormProof Umbrellas believes in the manufacturing of high quality gear and the extension of exceptional customer service to all its clients. \nStormProof’s “unbreakable” umbrella can be found on Amazon at https://goo.gl/YhI3Gr for a limited period introductory price of $19.99.

      "text": "Skip in Skip x Embed\nx Share\nShoppers can literally grab and go without paying for their goods at a cash register at Amazon's new smart grocery store in Seattle. USA TODAY\nAmazon announced its Amazon Go \"just walk out\" store on Dec. 5, 2016. These stores allow customers to enter, grab items and then leave without ever having to go through a checkout lane. An Amazon Go app and sensors track everything the customer has taken, charging their Amazon account as they leave. (Photo: Amazon)\nSAN FRANCISCO — Amazon is testing a grocery store in downtown Seattle that lets customers walk in, grab food from the shelves and walk out again, without ever having to stand in a checkout line.\nCustomers tap their cellphones on a turnstile as they walk into the store, which logs them into the store's network and connects to their Amazon Prime account through an app.\nThe service is called Amazon Go. It uses machine learning, sensors and artificial intelligence to track items customers pick up. These are then added to the virtual cart on their app. If they pick up an item they later decide they don't want, putting it back on the shelf removes it from their cart.\nThe Seattle-based company calls it, \"Just walk out technology.\"\nWhen the customer leaves, the app adds up everything the customer has taken and charges their Amazon account.\nAmazon said it began to work on the project in 2012. It is currently being tested by Amazon employees at the location at 2131 7th Ave., near Amazon's offices, but will open to the public in early 2017, the company said.\nThe technology \"is amazing,\" said Phil Lempert, a food marketing expert based in Los Angeles.\nHe's even more intrigued by the multiple images of \"meal kits\" show in Amazon's video. These \"everything you need to cook a quick, high-quality dinner\" kits have become popular, but the economics of delivering them has meant they're difficult to make economically viable. Stores such as Amazon Go may provide a sweet spot for them.\n\"When you look at the store itself in the video (and presumably it is the actual store), they have done a great job of merchandising, and having \"meal kits\" available is simply brilliant. As the meal-kit industry struggles due to the shipping/logistics aspect,\" Amazon Go could be a venue where they could succeed, said Lempert.\n15910 CONNECT TWEET 1226 LINKEDIN 131 COMMENT EMAIL MORE //usat.ly/2gHRupA",

      "text": "Sunil, a Chartered Accountant, who was with Amazon until two months ago, quit his job for the expedition. While many of us dream of travelling to the regular tourist destinations, 25-year-old Sunil Kumar Chirlamcherla travelled to Antarctica in 2015. Now, the Hyderabadi is one of the 10 people from across the world, who have been selected for an expedition to the South Pole, one of the coldest and harshest places on Earth. Robert Charles Swan, the first person to walk to both, the North and South Poles, selected Sunil for the expedition that will begin next year. It aims to create awareness about global warming and the usage of alternative energy. There are no plants or animals on the South Pole. The team of 10 plan to stay for 10 days sustaining on renewable energy — the first time in the world. The team has one question: If they can live on renewable energy in the South Pole, how hard is it for us to implement the same at our homes?\nSunil, a Chartered Accountant, who was with Amazon until two months ago, quit his job for the expedition. “I’ve been working on my fitness. Skiing is new to me; I’m learning it because to reach the South Pole, one needs to Ski with 80 kgs of weight on the back. I have to carry frozen food, tents and other necessities. It is important to stay mentally and physically fit. The aim, however, is to create awareness about the cause,” he says.\nSunil, who will be the youngest from India to go to the South Pole, urges people to make small changes in their daily life and requests celebrities to take up the cause. “If your office is close by, walk or cycle or at least use a share cab. The government must also create separate ways for cyclists,” says Sunil, who has convinced Hi-tech Residential High School in the city to use only renewable energy.\nSurprisingly, Sunil was never adventurous. “But, I cannot live a routine life; I like to think out of the box. I met a friend who had been to Antarctica, and that’s when I knew I wanted to do this too. My wife has been very supportive,” he smiles.\nSunil is now in the process of gathering funds. “I need `85-90 lakh for the journey. If people even donate one rupee and tell 10 people about it, I’d be happy,” he says.",

      "text": "David Bowie died, then Brexit, then Trump - now Amazon has launched a shop where you can just take stuff off the shelves and walk off.\n\nWhen will the madness of 2016 end?\n\nIf it's all getting a bit much, chill out and read our handy guide to the new Amazon Go shop.\n\n*I've seen the video. Are people stealing from Amazon?*\n\nNo, don't worry. It's just the format of the shop. People will be able pick up items and these will be billed to their Amazon Prime account automatically.\n\n*Read more*: These Amazon Black Friday deals aren't all they seem\n\nIf you haven't seen the video, here it is:\n\n*Is it simple, like the ad says?*\n\nNo. Forget baskets, and baskets on wheels (trolleys, invented 1937. Still useful). There's machine learning and AI involved in this, which are \"weaved into the fabric of the store\". We don't know what that means, but hopefully it doesn't mean the walls will talk to you. Anyway, it's complicated, and we should like that.\n\nKey complicated things involved include:\n\n· Computer vision\n· Deep learning algorithms (no shallow computers here, people)\n· Sensor fusion\n\nBut because Amazon are a no-nonsense tech company, they've called all of it \"just walk out technology\".\n\n*Where is the shop?*\n\nIt's in Seattle so you probably can't go right now.\n\n*When does it open?*\n\nIt will be open early next year, so even if you are free, you will have to wait.\n\n*Does Amazon have expansion plans?*\n\nNo. Amazon does not.\n\n*Read more*: Eight very cool ways Amazon Echo can make your life easier\n\nJust kidding, it's Amazon, it wants to take over the world. And this shop is no exception. There are some leaked documents suggesting Amazon wants to open 2,000 of the stores in the US (none for you, sorry).\n\n*Is Amazon saying boastful things about its new initiative, like all the US tech companies do?*\n\nYes, yes it is. The tech giant said the service was \"the world's most advanced shopping technology\".\n\n*How big is it and what can I buy there?*\n\nThere's 1,800 square feet in Amazon's new see-it-take-it shop and it will sell most food items apparently. But you can't buy those things, because it's in Seattle (see above).\n\n*Why is it in Seattle?*\n\nProbably because Amazon is based in Seattle. I know, selfish, right?",

      "text": "Loading the player... Online retail king Amazon.com ( AMZN ) is taking dead aim at the physical-store world Monday, introducing Amazon Go, a retail convenience store format it is developing that will use computer vision and deep-learning algorithms to let shoppers just pick up what they want and exit the store without any checkout procedure. And Amazon reportedly has more such store concepts in the works.\nShoppers will merely need to tap the Amazon Go app on their smartphones, and their virtual shopping carts will automatically tabulate what they owe, and deduct that amount from their Amazon accounts, sending you a receipt. It's what the company has deemed \"just walk out technology,\" which it said is based on the same technology used in self-driving cars. It's certain to up the ante in the company's competition with Wal-Mart ( WMT ), Target ( TGT ) and the other retail leaders.\nIBD'S TAKE: Amazon isn't the only retailer to test skipping the checkout line. Wal-Mart warehouse chain Sam's Club is rolling out self-scan and pay. That's part of Wal-Mart's big push to improve efficiency, transforming whole industries once again: \"How Wal-Mart May Revive U.S. Productivity — And Its Own Fortunes.\"\nThe company said its first Amazon Go store -- an 1,800-square-foot convenience store -- is in its home base of Seattle, but for now is just open to Amazon employees on a beta test basis. It says the store will open for everyone in early 2017.\nAmazon explained Amazon Go in a press release and short video.\nThe company said the store will feature groceries, including ready-to-eat breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snack options made daily. It will also stock \"well-known brands\" and \"special finds.\"\n\"We view grocery as AMZN's biggest potential source of revenue upside over time, with Go being another layer of AMZN's multi-platform grocery strategy,\" Cowen & Co. analyst John Blackledge wrote in a bullish research report Monday.\nAmazon, though, is exploring at least three formats of brick-and-mortar food stores , the Wall Street Journal reported Monday, citing people familiar with the matter. The other two formats are for facilities larger the Go convenience stores, the WSJ said, and will include curbside pickup.\nAmazon stock closed up 2.6% at 759.36 on the stock market today , but still below its 50-day line after falling after Donald Trump was elected president. Trump has said Amazon benefited from unfair tax breaks, and he has feuded with the Washington Post, which is owned individually by Amazon CEO and founder Jeff Bezos.",

But the key selling point is what it doesn't have: checkout lines. \nNEW YORK (CNNMoney) — Amazon has gone after book stores, retail chains and electronics shops. Now it’s taking on grocery stores, with a twist. \nAmazon unveiled in a video a new physical store on Monday that sells a mix of “grocery essentials” and ready-made meals. But the key selling point is what it doesn’t have: checkout lines. \nThe video shows how customers check in at the entrance of the store with a new app called Amazon Go, then grab whatever items are needed. Amazon claims it can track the items automatically through a combination of computer vision and deep learning technologies. When you’re done shopping, you just walk out. \nThe first store is located in Seattle, where Amazon is headquartered. \nFor years, there have been rumors the e-commerce company would expand its dominance from digital to physical shopping. Amazon began experimenting with physical bookstores a year ago, but Amazon Go may mark its boldest bet on bricks-and-mortar yet. \nBy eliminating much of the staff needed to operate a store, Amazon keeps costs lower than traditional competitors. It’s also in a strong position to bring together data on its customers shopping habits online and offline to make better suggestions in all situations. \nHowever, Amazon’s move deeper into physical retail shops comes in a sensitive political climate. The company could be perceived as being a threat to some of the 3.4 million Americans who work as cashiers, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. \nOn the campaign trail, Donald Trump repeatedly criticized Amazon and its founder Jeff Bezos for “getting away with murder tax-wise” and having “a huge antitrust problem.” Will the President-elect add “job killer” to the list of criticisms? \nAmazon’s effort to launch a new kind of retail store predates the rise of Donald Trump. \n“Four years ago we asked ourselves: what if we could create a shopping experience with no lines and no checkout? Could we push the boundaries of computer vision and machine learning to create a store where customers could simply take what they want and go?” the company says on an informational page about Amazon Go. \nFor now, Amazon is starting slow. The first store is only open to Amazon employees and will not be an option for the general public until early next year. 40.712784 -74.005941 ",

Your smart phone and the Amazon Go app will sense what is in your hand, bag, cart, etc. AMAZING.\nNo need to wait to check out. No lines.\nFor those of you who are concerned about loss of jobs, Amazon isn't eliminating jobs that were never there. Shopping for Amazon is done online, they aren't a grocery store chain. Also, there will still be people in the store stocking items and helping costumers.\nWhat a time to be alive.\nTweets by @AlexontheMic What's up? I'm Alex! So I guess I'll tell you a little bit about myself. I grew up in South Jersey (10 minutes from Philly) and went to school a few minutes from Lexington, Kentucky. Growing up I always wanted to be on the air. What's better than talking about and listening to music for a living? Sounds like a pretty good job to me. I'm here to to provide some good music for your ears and keep you informed on all the latest things happening around here. Sound good?\nFollow me on Twitter/Instagram: @alexonthemic",

      "text": "The future of shopping is here.\nOnline shopping giant Amazon rolled out Amazon Go on Monday, enabling customers to walk into its Seattle-based grocery store, grab whatever they want and leave.\nThe store uses deep learning technology , sensors and computer vision to keep track of what you take off and place back on the shelves. It’s similar to the kind of technology used in self-driving cars.\nTo start shopping, you use a free app to scan yourself in when you enter the store.\nAmazon The app keeps a running tab of what you pull off the shelves. Shortly after you leave, Amazon will charge your account for the items and send you a receipt.\nAmazon At the moment, Amazon Go seems more like a corner store or convenience store than a full-fledged grocery store. It offers an array of ready-to-eat, grab-and-go meals prepared by Amazon Go’s staff, plus items such as bread, cheese, milk and chocolate. It also sells Amazon Meal Kits, which include ingredients to cook a meal for two at home in under 30 minutes.\nThe store is currently in its beta phase, and only Amazon employees can shop there for the time being. It will open to the public in early 2017.\nAmazon Go seems to be the next step in Amazon’s quest to expand its influence in the grocery business, as well as its brick and mortar presence. In 2007, the company rolled out the grocery delivery service Amazon Fresh , and in 2015, it opened a physical bookstore .\nAlso on HuffPost 21 Super Practical Things You Can Buy In Bulk On Amazon 21 Super Practical Things You Can Buy In Bulk On Amazon 1 of 21 Toilet Paper Angel Soft Bath Tissue, 12-Pack, $38.99 Share this slide:\nAmazon More: Amazon Seattle Amazon Go Suggest a correction THE MORNING EMAIL 802 K 480 K 459 ",

      "text": "Amazon experiments with ‘grab and go’ shopping INQUIRER.net / 06:35   \nSometimes one of the most time-consuming shopping experiences is not the selection of products and items to buy but the checkout part. People often have to wait around 30 minutes or more queuing to pay for the goods. Amazon aims to solve this with a new experimental shop that promotes the “grab and go” concept, which revolves around the Amazon Go app and the user’s Amazon account. \nEquipped with the app, shoppers can walk into the store, pick out their choice of products, and just head out the door. No cues, no angry people in a hurry, no underpaid slow-moving cashier to get mad at. Amazon just sends the bill and receipt afterwards. ADVERTISEMENT \nAmazon’s system makes use of technology that can also be found in self-driving cars. Cameras, as well as various sensors around the store, keep track of customers and products. At the same time, computer vision and machine learning help determine what products are being bought and note them down in a virtual shopping cart. \nApart from the staple grocery items, the Amazon Go store also offers freshly made meals prepared by on-site chefs–from sandwiches to Amazon Meal Kits for quick home-cooked dinners. \nThe experimental store, which is found in Seattle, Washington, is currently only open to Amazon employees as part of the Beta program. Amazon Go is scheduled for the public in early 2017. Alfred Bayle \nWatch the video below to see the system in action:",

(Source: Amazon/CNN) \n(CNN) - A grocery store with no checkout lines sounds like a dream, but Amazon is making it a reality. \nThe online giant unveiled a new brick and mortar store where it sells grocery essentials and pre-made meals. \nCustomers check in at the entrance of the store using the Amazon Go app. \nShoppers can then grab whatever they want and just exit the store when they're done. \nAmazon said it tracks purchases using computer vision and advanced sensor technology. \nThe first store is in Seattle, where Amazon is headquartered. \nRight now, the store is only open to Amazon employees. \nThe public can start shopping at Amazon Go stores early next year. \nCopyright 2016 CNN.

      "text": "Amazon testing cashier-free retail store San Francisco, Dec 6, 2016 (AFP) Amazon has unveiled a new kind of retail store, with no cashiers.\nCustomers at the concept store in Amazon's hometown of Seattle, Washington, can fill their shopping carts and walk out - with the costs automatically tallied up and billed to their accounts with the US online giant.\nAmazon Go, which is being tested with Amazon employees and will open to the public next year, is a \"checkout-free shopping experience made possible by the same types of technologies used in self-driving cars: computer vision, sensor fusion and deep learning,\" its webpage said.\n\"Our Just Walk Out technology automatically detects when products are taken from or returned to the shelves and keeps track of them in a virtual cart. When you're done shopping, you can just leave the store. Shortly after, we'll charge your Amazon account and send you a receipt.\"\nThe 1,800-square-foot (170-square-meter) store is selling a variety of food products, including bread, cheeses and ready-to-eat meals, as well as Amazon Meal Kits, which contain ingredients for home-cooked dishes.\nIt was not immediately clear whether Amazon will expand this model with more physical stores or offer the technology to other retailers.\nThe online giant has been rumored to be looking at creating brick-and-mortar stores but so far has only announced a handful of outlets selling books.\nThe Wall Street Journal cited people close to the matter as saying that Amazon Go was one of several store formats the retail giant is considering.\nTwo prototype drive-through locations in Seattle without in-store shopping options are set to open in the coming weeks, the Journal reported.\nDepending on the success of the test locations, Amazon could reportedly open more than 2,000 brick-and-mortar grocery stores under its brand.\nIf it does push forward with selling fresh food in stores, Amazon could put a lot of pressure on traditional grocers and superstores like Wal-Mart.",

      "text": "Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends \nSkip the checkout line, forever \nAmazon is giving us what may be a peek at the future of retail. And no, we don’t mean barking at your Amazon Echo to re-order those carmel-apple oreos that you just ran out of. We mean the future of physically going shopping , where you go to a store to an actual store and actually buy things in real life. \nWell that’s the idea behind the Go retail concept by Amazon, which looks to be a regular grocery store with a very high tech twist . There are no cashiers, and no checkout lines. When you go into the Go store, you activate the Amazon Go shopping app, pick out your stuff, and then head for the exit. Amazon says they are using a combination of sensors, A.I. deep learning and even some tech lifted from autonomous cars to keep track of what you buy while in the store. \nDone shopping? Amazon will total up your purchases, charge your account and email your receipt for easy tracking, all before you even get to your self-driving car. Amazon says the first Go store opens in Seattle next year, and if things go well, expect at least 2,000 more Go stores to pop up in the very near future. \nMakes Whack-A-Mole look easy \nFollowing an enormously contentious election cycle in the United States and a refugee crisis in Europe, the influence of social media on popular opinion is becoming an ever-more powerful influence, and the EU is saying social media providers are failing to curb hate speech on their platforms. In response, some EU officials say they are eying legislation that would force companies to monitor and remove posts that violate hate speech protocols. \nFacebook, Twitter, Google and Microsoft all signed onto a voluntary “Code of conduct” to stamp out hate speech earlier this year, but the EU is saying that, basically, it’s not working . The biggest complaint is the amount of time it takes to review complaints and remove posts, with YouTube garnering praise for their speed, but… that’s about it. \nEU ministers will meet this Thursday to review progress – or the lack thereof – and ponder the next steps to stopping online hate-mongering. One spokesman said that if the major players can’t show a lot more progress in the coming months, new rules could be introduced that will force quicker action. \nMaybe the Egyptians had it right all along \nWhen you see emojis and know exactly what they say, then congratulations, you’re fluent in a new kind of language. You may think of emojis as just something fun to tack onto your text messages, but in reality, they’re a language all their own, and they’re part of the way we are changing the way we read, write and communicate. \nTechnology has enabled us to communicate with just about anyone, anywhere in seconds, and emojis, emoticons, phrase bits, chat, hashtags, texting, leet, netspeak, acronyms, and, heck, even the caps lock key are all changing – and speeding up – how we talk to each other. \nDigital Trends editor Jeff Van Camp has put together a comprehensive look at the rapidly shifting topic of language and communication , in a piece that’s part of our DT-10 series on the recent past – and quickly approaching future of communication and technology. Many people say the art of correspondence is gone, but is it really? Or has it just changed with the times, as communication systems have always done? \nGet the rest of the today’s tech news at Digital Trends,com and check out our Facebook page and YouTube channel for the rest of our daily communications.

      "text": "Amazon Introduces Line Free Shopping Experience With Amazon Go (WATCH) posted by Alex Gervasi - share Amazon just announced the first grab and go shopping experience with Amazon Go.\nThis is a store where you walk in, grab what you want, and walk out. Your smart phone and the Amazon Go app will sense what is in your hand, bag, cart, etc. AMAZING. \nNo need to wait to check out. No lines. \nFor those of you who are concerned about loss of jobs, Amazon isn't eliminating jobs that were never there. Shopping for Amazon is done online, they aren't a grocery store chain. Also, there will still be people in the store stocking items and helping costumers. \nWhat a time to be alive. Tweets by @AlexontheMic What's up? I'm Alex! So I guess I'll tell you a little bit about myself. I grew up in South Jersey (10 minutes from Philly) and went to school a few minutes from Lexington, Kentucky. Growing up I always wanted to be on the air. What's better than talking about and listening to music for a living? Sounds like a pretty good job to me. I'm here to to provide some good music for your ears and keep you informed on all the latest things happening around here. Sound good? Follow me on Twitter/Instagram: @alexonthemic Contact ",

      "text": "Source: Thinkstock Among Amazon.com Inc.’s (NASDAQ: AMZN) seemingly endless arsenal of advantages over every other retailer is the 182 million visitors to its websites. No other retailer comes close.\nBased on comScore data, Amazon’s 182.2 million unique visitors from mobile and computers placed fifth among all companies in October, just behind Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ: MSFT) at 193.8 million. The comScore top 50 multi-platform properties list has only two other retailers, which are big-box leaders Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (NYSE: WMT) at 93.9 million unique visitors and Target Corp. (NYSE: TGT) at 62.1 million.\nIt is impossible to tell which came first to create and sustain Amazon’s traffic. Was it the traditional superstore factory, which allows Amazon to offer large selections of products across nearly countless categories, or the products and services like Prime, Alexa, Kindle and Echo? Amazon had $18.9 billion in North American sales in its third quarter, up 26% over the same quarter a year ago. Net income for this segment of Amazon’s business was $694 million, up 32% on the same basis. It is safe to say the top line will balloon in the fourth quarter, the holiday rush months.\nAmazon does have a set of weapons that other retailers cannot rival at all. Prime has morphed free shipping into a suite of services that include its streaming video business, which is built partly on original programming; a music streaming business with a selection that puts it on equal footing with Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Pandora Media Inc. (NYSE: P); and photo storage capacity. According to recent research, a third of Prime members buy something from Amazon once a week. Prime members also get early access to special sales, another way to tether them to Amazon.\nAmazon’s selection of consumer electronics is nearly as broad as Apple’s, and in some cases competes with the giant consumer electronics company. Amazon TV certainly competes with Apple TV, the Fire tablets with the iPad, and Echo with certain features of Siri.\nNo matter what the reason, for competitors, Amazon’s 182 million visitors can’t be approached.\nI'm interested in the Newsletter Get Newsletter \nterms and conditions   ",
