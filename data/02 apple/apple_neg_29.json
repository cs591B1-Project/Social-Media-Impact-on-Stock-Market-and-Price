      "title": "Apple reportedly limits Verizon iPhone 7 modem speed to match AT&T model",
      "text": "Apple has been limiting the modem speeds of the iPhone 7 built for Verizon Wireless's network in order to match the slower speeds of the AT&T iPhone, according to reports Friday by Bloomberg and Recode .\nThe Verizon iPhone 7 uses a Qualcomm Snapdragon X12 modem that is capable of LTE download speeds of up to 600Mbps, while the AT&T model uses an Intel XMM 7360 that goes up to 450Mbps. But Apple limits the Verizon model so that it performs similarly to the AT&T one; to achieve this, Apple may disable certain features of the network chip, Bloomberg reported. Bloomberg's report is based on data from testing firms including Cellular Insights, which wrote about its findings on its blog .\n\"Out of all supported features by Qualcomm’s solution, Apple has chosen to implement 3-Way Carrier Aggregation on the downlink and 2-Way Carrier Aggregation on the uplink for contiguous Band 7 or Band 41,\" Cellular Insights analyst Milan Milanovic wrote. \"Higher Order Modulation (DL-256QAM, UL-64QAM), and Higher Order MIMO (4×4 MIMO) have not been implemented. Therefore, the peak theoretical downlink speeds are limited to 450Mbps when aggregating three 20MHz wide LTE component carriers.\"\nThe Verizon iPhone was still slightly faster than the AT&T one despite not reaching its full capabilities, according to field tests by Twin Prime , Bloomberg wrote. The iPhone was significantly slower on Verizon than the Samsung Galaxy S7, which uses the same Qualcomm chip.\nThe Verizon model is also used for the Sprint network, while the AT&T model is also used on the T-Mobile USA network. The AT&T/T-Mobile variant does not support the CDMA voice and data networks used by Verizon and Sprint.\nAn iPhone user isn't going to hit 450Mbps under typical network conditions, so it's unlikely anyone would notice the speed limitation without doing some extensive testing. But the enforcement of consistent speeds despite the use of different chips demonstrates how Apple and carriers view the importance of similar performance across networks, even when that requires limiting one phone's capabilities.\nApple historically used Qualcomm modems for the iPhone but this year decided to use both Qualcomm and Intel ones . \"By pitting Intel against Qualcomm, the company may be trying to improve its negotiating position on price,\" Bloomberg noted.\nApple also uses components from multiple suppliers to make sure it can produce enough iPhones to meet consumer demand . For example, Apple used both Samsung and TSMC to make the A9 chip for the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus.\nSince carriers had no control over the modem decision, \"it would be a little unfair if Apple allowed, say, Verizon and Sprint to say that their iPhone performs better than AT&T and T-Mobile’s,\" Jackdaw Research analyst Jan Dawson said, according to Recode.\nDawson also noted that it isn't uncommon for phone makers to leave some features disabled to save on battery life, \"so you rarely see a phone that’s maxed out on all possible performance parameters.\"\nApple provided a statement to Bloomberg and Recode confirming that iPhones across different networks perform similarly, but the statement did not address how Apple limited the speeds of the Qualcomm modem. “In all of our rigorous lab tests based on wireless industry standards, in thousands of hours of real-world field testing, and in extensive carrier partner testing, the data shows there is no discernible difference in the wireless performance of any of the models,\" Apple said.\nWe contacted Apple today, but the company declined to provide any further information.",

      "text": "Shutterstock November 21, 2016 | 09:35AM PT \nApple is getting out of the router business: The company has disbanded its wireless router team and assigned its members to other areas, according to a Bloomberg report . Apple declined to comment on the report. \nApple hasn’t updated its routers since 2013. The company is currently selling two router models for $99 and $199 respectively, as well as a line of network-attached storage drives with integrated router starting at $299. Discontinuing the devices is unlikely to make a big dent in Apple’s bottom line \nInterestingly, Apple is leaving the router business just as one of its biggest competitors is getting into selling Wifi routers: Google started to ship its own router, simply called Google Wifi, this week. Google Wifi is supposed to make it easier to cover bigger houses or houses with older walls with blanket coverage by combining multiple routers. \nAs others have noted , Apple’s departure from making routers also comes at the time of a technology shift from local networking to the cloud. New routers like Google Wifi often feature some sort of cloud tie-in, and many of the things that Apple’s router used to try to solve locally are now being provided through cloud services. \nThis includes one feature baked into Apple’s entry-level Airport Express router, which doubles as a wireless music player. Users can plug their Airport Express into their stereo systems and then listen to music via AirPlay . \nThat was a big deal when most people still had all of their music on their phones or computers. But these days, wireless speakers or cheap adapters like Google’s Chromecast Audio offer a much better experience when used in conjunction with cloud-based music services like Spotify or Pandora.

      "text": "Apple kills Wi-Fi router division, moves engineers to other projects No plans to update AirPort Extreme, Time Capsule and AirPort Express on Nov 21, 2016, 11:15 AM TechSpot \nApple is reportedly getting out of the wireless router business in a move to focus more on consumer products that generate the bulk of its revenue. According to Bloomberg , the company has disbanded the team that was working on wireless routers and moved engineers to other projects. \nPeople familiar with the matter told Bloomberg that Apple began shutting down the wireless router team over the past year, dispersing engineers to other product development groups, including the one handling the Apple TV. Although the decision hasn’t been publicly announced, the internal changes suggest Apple has no plans to update the AirPort Extreme, Time Capsule, and AirPort Express products. \nApple hasn’t refreshed its routers since 2013 when it renamed the Time Capsule as AirPort Time Capsule and added support for the 802.11ac standard. Their portable AirPort Express on the other hand remains available to this day with last-generation 802.11n performance. \nWhile the routers likely never sold in huge numbers they helped Apple deliver things like AirTunes (the tiny AirPort Express plugged directly into an outlet and had a headphone jack to plug to your speakers to sent music to another room over wireless) as well as seamless Time Machine backups (putting a hard drive into your its Wi-Fi router with the Time Capsule ) before there was AirPlay and iCloud. \nToday, companies like Eero, Luma and Google are trying to innovate in the wireless routers scene with modular designs that work as part of a mesh network to cover larger homes, as well as more consumer friendly management through smartphone apps. It looks like Apple won’t be joining them in the fun. Related Reads",

      "text": "Apple will replace faulty iPhone 6s batteries that keep shutting down the handset Apple says the problem affects a \"very small\" number of devices on Nov 21, 2016, 10:30 AM TechSpot \nApple launched its Multi-Touch Repair Service last week to address the problem of Touch Disease in iPhone 6 Plus handsets. Now, the company has announced another repair program; this one for a different problem found in another device. \nApple has confirmed that a “very small number” of iPhone 6s handsets have battery issues that are causing them to shut down without warning for no apparent reason. \nIf you own an iPhone 6s manufactured between September 2015 and October 2015 then you’re eligible for a replacement battery. Just head down to an Apple Retail Store or an Apple Authorized Service Provider, where they’ll check the handset’s serial number and, once it’s confirmed to be one of the affected devices, will replace the battery for free. \nBe warned, though, if there are any other problems with the smartphone, such as a cracked screen, users will need to have them fixed at their expense before Apple replaces the battery. \nApple stresses that the problem isn’t a safety issue. The company doesn’t want people to think this is anyway similar to Samsung’s Galaxy Note 7 battery fiasco; those were overheating and exploding, whereas Apple’s batteries are just randomly failing. \nIf you’ve already paid to have your problem iPhone 6s battery replaced, Apple will refund the cost as long as the device falls in the affected serial number range. \nWhile Apple finally admitted last week that Touch Disease was real, the company said it is caused by owners dropping their devices multiple times on hard services. As such, the firm will only fix affected iPhone 6 Plus models for a $149 fee. Related Reads",

      "text": "Apple is one of the most important client for Asian components suppliers, which is why there's a fierce competition to win exclusivity over some of the hardware inside the iPhone. For example, TSMC manage to win that exclusivity for the production of A10, the chipset inside the iPhone 7. The Taiwanese company achieved that due to its InFO packaging technique that allows the A10 to remain very thin, while at the same time delivering improved performance and efficiency. However, the chipset is made on TSMC's 16nm FinFET+ process, which is inferior to Samsung's newly announced 10nm FinFET process. The latter will be used in the upcoming Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor that should make its debut next year. It's clear that TSMC needs to refine its own process in order to win exclusivity over the production of the chipset that will be included in the next iPhones. It's unclear what company will score a contract with Apple next year, but TSMC has already confirmed tha...",

      "text": "Apple said to abandon development of wireless routers By Mark Gurman, Bloomberg   11:33   11:38 AM CDT 0 shares facebook twitter email comments × \nApple has disbanded its division that develops wireless routers, another move to try to sharpen the company's focus on consumer products that generate the bulk of its revenue, according to people familiar with the matter. \nApple began shutting down the wireless router team over the past year, dispersing engineers to other product development groups, including the one handling the Apple TV, said the people, who asked not to be named because the decision hasn't been publicly announced. \nApple hasn't refreshed its routers since 2013 following years of frequent updates to match new standards from the wireless industry. The decision to disband the team indicates the company isn't currently pushing forward with new versions of its routers. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment on the company's plans. \nRouters are access points that connect laptops, iPhones and other devices to the web without a cable. Apple currently sells three wireless routers, the AirPort Express, AirPort Extreme, and AirPort Time capsule. The Time capsule doubles as a backup storage hard drive for Mac computers. \nThe products, which cost $99, $199, and $299, respectively, make up a small slice of Apple's revenue and are part of Apple's \"other products\" category on its financial statements. The category, which includes the Apple Watch and Apple TV, generated $11.1 billion in fiscal 2016, or about 5 percent of total sales. \nExiting the router business could make Apple's product ecosystem less sticky. Some features of the AirPort routers, including wireless music playback, require an Apple device like an iPhone or Mac computer. If the company no longer sells wireless routers, some may have a reason to use other phones and PCs. \nThe core of the technology in routers comes from chipmakers such as Broadcom Ltd. that advance Wi-Fi technology through developing the fundamental components. While router makers can differentiate the design of their products, the number of antennas and the software that controls them, they reliant on advances first made by chipmakers to be able to offer new, higher-performing models. \nApple's AirPorts have historically lagged behind those of companies such as D-Link Corp., Netgear Inc. and Belkin International Inc., which have rushed to adopt new standards. Apple, which has charged more for its routers, has focused more on integrating control of its devices into its computer operating system and industrial design. The company's decision to leave the business may be a boon for other wireless router makers. \nEarlier this year, Apple stopped making its own external monitors and in October introduced a new strategy by selling new high-resolution screens for professional users with LG Electronics Inc. \n(c) 2016, Bloomberg Subscribe to NewsOK's Business Headlines Stay up to date with business news in Oklahoma and around the country.

      "text": "When Sir Jony Ive isn’t busy narrating Apple’s latest product design theories from inside of a white box, he spends his free time designing one-off products like a desk or a Leica camera . So when tasked with designing a Christmas tree for UK-based hotel Claridge’s holiday get-up, it’s no surprise that the Apple design chief took the minimalist route.\nBehold, the most unlit Christmas tree of trees.\nClaridge’s No ornaments, no strings. Not even a star or a single box of present underneath.\nIt’s pretty fitting though: 2016 has been a rather underwhelming year so why not have a tree that’s blah as hell? But before you get mad, Ive and his design partner Marc Newson did go the extra mile by creating an entire lobby set to accompany the tree. In it, you’ll find smaller, similarly unlit trees, surrounded by lightbox walls of snow-covered trees topped by a cloud of green pine.\n“Our aim was to create an all-enveloping magical experience.” The lighting also changes throughout the day to evoke different holiday moods, from wintry nights to sunrise. It’s clear they want you to experience the walk up to the main attraction rather than throwing a gaudy decorative tree and calling it a day.\nClaridge’s “There are few things more pure and beautiful than nature, so that was our starting point, layering various iterations of organic forms with technology. Our aim was to create an all-enveloping magical experience that celebrates our enormous respect for tradition while recognising our excitement about the future and things to come,\" the pair said in a statement .\nSure, the language describing the tree is as self-indulgent as the $300 Apple coffee table book , but I’d rather than have this peaceful-looking tree over Claridge’s previous collaboration with Lanvin in 2011 featuring some super creepy dolls . \n\nThe setup is available for public viewing now at Claridge’s in London.",

      "text": "Tweet \nApple's AirPort wireless routers are iconic -- well designed aesthetically, while being rock solid from a performance standpoint. The company even took an odd approach to management -- an app that was only available for macOS, iOS, and Windows. In other words, it did not use a browser-based web interface like routers from other companies. \nThe routers' lack of a web UI meant that it could not be managed from Linux-based operating systems. If you owned an Android device, Chromebook, or PC running Ubuntu, you could not change the AirPort settings. Some would argue that a lack of web interface made it more secure, but ultimately, it was a bit of an inconvenience. Linux users no longer have to worry about this snag, however, as -- according to Bloomberg -- Apple is reportedly stopping development of new AirPort routers. \nBloomberg says the following. \nApple Inc. has disbanded its division that develops wireless routers, another move to try to sharpen the company's focus on consumer products that generate the bulk of its revenue, according to people familiar with the matter. \nApple began shutting down the wireless router team over the past year, dispersing engineers to other product development groups, including the one handling the Apple TV, said the people, who asked not to be named because the decision hasn’t been publicly announced. \nTrue, Apple hadn't refreshed its line of AirPort devices in years, but some folks -- including yours truly -- were hoping to see a new model in 2016. When the MacBook Pro event came and went without mention, all hope went out the window. It was a very sad moment for fans of the router line. \nEven as a Linux user, I enjoyed owning an 802.11ac AirPort Extreme. Even though I couldn't manage it from my Ubuntu machine, my iPad could handle it brilliantly. Not to mention, how often do you really need to access those settings? More importantly, the beautiful appearance allowed me to display it in my living room -- it looked like art, not an ugly tech device like other routers. \nALSO READ: NETGEAR Nighthawk X10 AD7200 802.11ad Smart WiFi router (R9000) supports Plex and Amazon Drive \nSome will argue that Apple's AirPort routers were too basic from a feature perspective, and yeah, it was lacking in that regard comparatively. With that said, I would argue that many modern third-party offerings have too many features for the average home user, lending to a confusing experience. AirPort made things easy. \nMaybe all hope is not lost, however, as famed blogger John Gruber says the following. \nThe question is, are they really out of the router game (and will start selling Berlin or Eero routers in their stores), or are they working on something new, a HomeKit hub, that will include the functionality of a router? \nInteresting thought by Gruber. It is certainly a possibility, as Bloomberg says some of the AirPort engineers have been assigned to Apple TV. A single device that handles the duties of a router while also serving as a media and home hub could be wonderful. \nWill you mourn the death of AirPort, or do you not care? Tell me in the comments.",

      "title": "Study: Apple Pay branding on vending machines increases mobile payment usage 135%, overall sales by 36%",
      "text": "Reddit The results of a new six month study by a company offering Apple Pay on vending machines shows that “Apple Pay” branding on the machines helped increase mobile transactions and overall sales. The study shows that Apple Pay messaging specifically helped increase mobile transactions by as much as 135%, while transactions in general were up 44.6% and overall sales up 36.5%. The vending machines with increased transactions used language specific to Apple’s payment service, prompting users to “Pay with your favorite card using Apple Pay.” Another 130 machines in a control group used more generic text that simply read: “Ready – Swipe or Tap Now.” 36.5% increase in overall sales 44.6% increase in total transactions 6% increase in total contactless average ticket; 18% at week 20* 55.5% increase in revenue through contactless purchases, including Apple Pay; 121% at week 20* 135.2% increase in overall mobile payment usage The results were published by USAT after the company tracked sales on 35 of its vending machines using Apple Pay through its point-of-sale platform in the US. “Based on our study, we believe that when businesses and operators present consumers with the option to pay for items with Apple Pay, the number of mobile payments made and the amount spent, increases,” said Maeve McKenna Duska, senior vice president of marketing and sales, USA Technologies…the numbers provide evidence that negative seasonality trends may be tempered, and even reversed, by telling consumers they have an option to pay with Apple Pay.” Earlier this month a separate study showed how Apple’s recently launched Apple Pay on the web feature, allowing the payments service to be used through website checkouts in its Safari web browser, is quickly gaining share among other popular online payment platforms. Usage of that feature could soon see an increase as Apple’s new MacBook Pro that officially launched last week is the company’s first Mac with a built-in Touch ID sensor to authenticate payments.

      "text": "Twelve South Debuts HiRise Duet Charging Stand for iPhone and Apple Watch Posted by Evan Selleck on Nov 21, 2016 | No Comments tweet \nCharging both your Apple Watch and iPhone can mean taking up a bit more space than some might like in a single area. \nSo the popular Apple accessory maker, Twelve South, has come up with a way to avoid taking up more space, with the HiRise Duet. It’s a standing charger that’s equipped to juice up both the iPhone (equipped with a Lightning port), and the Apple Watch at the same time. It can also charge an iPad, just for good measure. The charging stand also supports Apple Watch Night Stand Mode, which means the wearable will display an alarm clock while positioned on the stand, and the Digital Crown works as a snooze button when you want to get a few more winks. \nThe bottom of the stand is lined with leather, which aims to prevent scuffs on the Apple Watch as it gets set down and picked up from the stand on a regular basis. \n“HiRise Duet is a luxe charging stand that powers your iPhone and Apple Watch at the same time, in the same place. Made from sleek metal and accented with napa leather, HiRise Duet includes an integrated Lightning Connector and Watch Charging Disk so you never have to search for cables again. Have a case on your iPhone? No problem, HiRise Duet adjusts to work with most cases and sleeves, including our very own BookBook. With everything you need in one space, HiRise Duet is the ultimate charging companion.” \nThe new HiRise Duet costs $119.99, and it’s available now with free shipping available in the United States. It’s available in black.",

      "text": "\n© 2016 Time Inc. All rights reserved. Here’s How Apple’s Jony Ive Redesigned the Christmas Tree \nApple design chief Jony Ive has redesigned the Christmas tree. \nThe luxury London hotel Claridge’s over the weekend unveiled its 2016 Christmas tree, designed by Ive and his good friend and Apple’s AAPL special projects designer Marc Newson. According to the hotel, Ive and Newson were inspired by “nature and technology, tradition and the future,” and created a “magical forest” to represent the Christmas tree. The display, which sits in the Claridge’s lobby, includes light boxes with black-and-white images of snow-covered silver birch trees, cast models of Scots pine, fir trees, and a “canopy of natural green pine.” It also features a three-foot-tall tree inside the forest to symbolize the future. \n“There are few things more pure and beautiful than nature, so that was our starting point, layering various iterations of organic forms with technology,” Ive and Newson said in a joint statement. “Our aim was to create an all-enveloping magical experience that celebrates our enormous respect for tradition while recognizing our excitement about the future and things to come.” Get Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter \nThe display is a major departure from Christmas trees designed for Claridge’s in years past. While all of the designers Claridge’s has enlisted over the years have employed their own interpretation of the tree, they’ve largely just created a tree. Last year, for instance, luxury fashion designer Christopher Bailey designed a tree decorated with more than 100 gold umbrellas. \nIve and Newson created a forest of trees. \nClaridge’s earlier this month announced plans to enlist the help of Ive and Newson for its annual Christmas tree . They said at the time that the duo would “reinterpret the tree in their own distinctive style.” Neither Ive nor Newson would say what they had planned. \nThe reimagined Christmas tree comes on the heels of Ive last week celebrating the release of a new design book from Apple. The book, titled Designed by Apple in California , is essentially a picture book, detailing the company’s design concepts between 1998 and 2015. Ive called the book a design “archive,” and said Apple had a “responsibility” to designers around the world to publish the book. For more about Apple’s iPhone 7, watch: \nIve and Newson’s Claridge’s Christmas tree is on display now in the hotel’s lobby. It’s the seventh time the Christmas tree has been redesigned at Claridge’s. ",

      "text": "  Photo Employees eating lunch at Apple’s campus in Austin, Tex. Credit Tamir Kalifa for The New York Times President-elect Donald J. Trump said during the campaign that he would push companies to bring manufacturing jobs back to the United States. He named one tech company in particular — Apple — which is the world’s largest public company and makes many of its gadgets overseas. Apple does make one product domestically: The Mac Pro desktop computer is assembled in Austin, Tex., through the contract manufacturer Flex. So Vindu Goel, a New York Times tech reporter, recently visited Austin to see what having tech manufacturing domestically has wrought for Apple and the area. Photo What he found was a more nuanced picture showing that manufacturing is far from the only way for a tech company to provide good jobs and career paths for Americans. It turns out Apple has a campus in Austin where the number of jobs has grown rapidly, reaching about 6,000 jobs now, up from around 2,100 seven years ago. The roles that Apple has created there are varied, including fielding tech-support calls, overseeing logistics with suppliers and updating Apple’s Maps software. The average salary of Apple’s Austin employees, including management, is $77,000 a year. The manufacturing jobs at Flex’s Austin location, located about a mile from the Apple campus, are also important, of course. Flex added about 2,000 jobs for the Mac Pro desktop. But clearly, they are not the only kinds of jobs a tech company can now create.",

      "text": "Taylor Swift’s response to Drake’s Apple ad pretty much sums up our feelings too We can always rely on Drake to surprise us (in the best way possible). And he did just that with his hilarious Apple commercial — which premiered last night during the American Music Awards. In case you missed it, Drake lip syncs to Taylor Swift’s “Bad Blood” while pumping iron in front of a mirror, only to collapse under a weight.\nAnd in case you’re curious about what Taylor thought about the ad, wonder no more: Swift promptly reacted to Drake’s ad via Insta — as you do. And Apple aficionados will probably remember this seriously parallels her own Apple ad, where in which she she clumsily fell off a treadmill while listening to Drake and Future’s “Jumpman”. So things have come full circle, and you can’t help but dig her short and sweet response.\nYES @champagnepapi ✨ #drakevsbenchpress \nA video posted by Taylor Swift (@taylorswift) on Nov 20, 2016 at 6:34pm PST \n“YES.” Our thoughts exactly . So much yes to Swift’s “distractingly good” music and Drake’s ability to totally laugh at himself! Because self-deprecating humor is officially the best way to our hearts.\nSeriously, we just dig how Drake’s sense of humor is on full display here, not gonna lie…we could watch him dance and lip sync to slick Swift tracks all day long (hint hint).\nOn a serious note, we’ve heard the dating rumors about these two, and while there’s nothing official about it, we’re kind of seriously #SHIPPING them right now…so maybe some day…(le sigh). Either way, their playfulness is absolutely adorable, and we require more. In the form of dangerously good workout music.\nH/T: Perez Hilton \nThe post Taylor Swift’s response to Drake’s Apple ad pretty much sums up our feelings too appeared first on HelloGiggles .",

      "title": "With Apple abandoning AirPort, here are the best alternative Wi-Fi routers for Mac users",
      "text": "With Apple abandoning AirPort, here are the best alternative Wi-Fi routers for Mac users By Monday, November 21, 2016, 09:51 am PT (12:51 pm ET) Some fear has erupted at the news that Apple may be shutting down development of its own AirPort wireless routers. However, picking a router isn't as complicated as it used to be, and AppleInsider has some suggestions that work well with other Apple hardware. D-Link Ultra AC5300 For the highest-bandwidth needs allowing for one device to serve data at the best possible speeds, the D-Link Ultra AC5300 has tri-band connectivity, with 1000 megabits per second at 2.4GHz, and two bands of 2167 megabits per second at 5GHz. > The Ultra AC5300 has 8 detachable antennae, and features the company's \"SmartConnect\" band allocation, as well as SmartBeam \"beam-forming\" to direct a signal specifically at a device. Wired network needs are provided by 4 Gigabit Ethernet ports, a WAN port, a USB 3.0 port, and a USB 2.0 port. Configuration is handled by the mydlink SharePort app, allowing for management both inside and outside the local area network. For the advanced user, the router supports DD-WRT OpenSource firmware, allowing for further customization options not available to the \"regular\" user. The D-Link Ultra AC5300 isn't cheap at $330 for a single device , but you get what you pay for. Netgear Nighthawk R6700 AC1750 If your Internet modem is in a relatively central location to the house, a single, powerful, router may be sufficient. The Netgear Nighthawk R6700 AC1750 provides up to 1750 megabits per second of wireless bandwidth, and has three antennae to beam-form the 802.11ac signal to users. Netgear has implemented a quality of service prioritization feature, allowing for administrators of the router to allow clients to minimize gaming lag, or to prevent streaming interruptions. Connectivity is provided with 4 down-stream Gigabit Ethernet ports, 1 WAN port, 1 USB 3.0 port to attach a hard drive, and one USB 2.0 port for printers or other shared devices. Netgear claims that any connected printer will be made AirPrint compatible. Setup is performed with the Netgear Genie app for iOS, or through a browser-based interface. While the app is sufficient for basic users to get the networking peripheral up and running, AppleInsider suggests superior browser-based interface for the router for medium- to advanced-networking users. The Netgear Nighthawk R6700 AC1750 retails for $150. TP-Link If you've got relatively modest needs, the TP-Link Archer C7 is a good starting point for 802.11ac. The $85 router offers up to 1750 megabits per second, and has three internal and three external antennas. Like the more expensive Nighthawk R6700, the router has 4 Gigabit Ethernet ports and 1 WAN port. Connectivity to devices is provided by a pair of USB 2.0 ports, allowing for media sharing with external devices, and printer sharing. Upgrading to the $125 TP-Link Archer C9 brings beam-forming, and upgrades one of the USB ports to 3.0. Regardless of model, the TP-Link Tether app allows for network management on iOS or Android. As with the Netgear, we recommend the browser-based setup for advanced users. Eero For the most Airport-like experience, Eero has a solution. The company, with the eponymously named Eero router uses a mesh networking model, allowing for the three-pack of Eero routers for $500 to cover most homes. Eero features ease of setup, as well as the company's TrueMesh technology, that adapts to network conditions, and switches routing methods to prevent interference from other devices, or network congestion. Like the Airport, Eero allows for a single SSID, and is configurable entirely with an iOS app. Eero recommends one basestation per 1000 square feet of needed coverage. The recommended configuration for most installations is $499 for three Eero basestations . A $349 Starter system contains two Eero basestations, with a single Eero retailing for $199 . The Eero would be best for users needing an extremely low maintenance configuration —think a family member who seems to always need technical support around the holidays. For now, the AirPort Extreme Apple has been in the router business since the last century. The software is mature, and compatibility is guaranteed with Apple products for a while, at least. Time Machine backups can be made to a AirPort Time Capsule, or to a hard drive connected to the USB port on an AirPort Extreme. Setup of a network is easy with the Airport Configuration app on macOS or iOS. Got old 802.11n AirPort basestations laying around from before the 2013 shift to 802.11ac? Apple has made it easy to extend a network either with Ethernet or with a wireless handoff. The AirPort Express can not only extend a network (with 802.11n speeds), but can also turn any speaker set into an AirPlay receiver with the headphone jack. Apple's Time Capsule retails for $299 for a 2TB model , and $399 for a 3TB configuration . An Airport Extreme without a hard drive sells for $199 . The Airport Express retails for $99 . ...but don't get the Google OnHub In 2015, Google promised a great deal with the OnHub router . While the router is extremely easy to set up with the app, there is little outstanding about the router itself. Additionally, if the router loses its internet connection, it no longer has most all of the features it touts, and most of the router's advanced settings including device information are no longer accessible to the user. The Google WiFi, unveiled in early October , is not yet shipping and promises a system very similar to the Eero. A three-pack of Google WiFi base stations will retail for $300 but if it has the same limitations as the OnHub is not yet known. Speaking of you get what you pay for... Apple's routers have been not necessarily the fastest, but they have been best-in-class, and reliable —so if Apple has in fact abandoned its base station efforts , it is the end of an era. In the last decade, manufacturers all over the globe have gotten onboard with wireless networking, with as-expected varying quality. There are a large number of sub-$75 802.11ac routers available from vendors, and we have a hard time recommending any of them. While for the most part routers aren't considered a disposable commodity any longer, the cheap routers from no-name manufacturers aren't generally reliable, and may not get any kind of security update for exploits from the seller or builder.

      "text": "Last week, Apple launched a repair program after acknowledging the iPhone 6 Plus had a touchscreen issue widely dubbed as \"Touch Disease.\" The program was not received well as Apple blames users for the problem rather than concluding there is a design fault on the phone. Because of that, the repair will cost iPhone 6 Plus owners $149. And now we have a second repair program underway , only this one is for the iPhone 6s .\nA small batch of iPhone 6s handsets manufactured between September and October 2015 have a battery issue. There's no threat of injury or phone damage, but your 6s may unexpectedly shut down. The battery is at fault and Apple will happily replace it for you for free.",

      "text": "Apple will replace these faulty iPhone batteries By Ariyanna Norman, Komando.com HD Blog \nYou're texting your brother about what to get your niece for Christmas and then all of the sudden ... a black screen. Your iPhone has inexplicably shut down for the umpteenth time. You're beyond exasperated and it's time to find a fix. \nThe good news is, you're not alone. Apple is aware of the issue and recently announced a replacement program. If you think your phone is affected, here's what you need to know. \nCertain iPhone 6s batteries are defective so Apple is replacing the battery for free. The defect is what is causing them to sporadically shut down. Don't worry, they're not exploding (Apple said there's no safety issue associated with the bad batteries). \nThey've been pretty hush-hush about the scope of the issue. Apple said that the defect applies to phones manufactured between September 2015 and October 2015. But they have yet to announce how many phones are affected and have not released a list of serial numbers. \nIf you have an iPhone 6s that keeps shutting down, you need to contact Apple to see if your phone is eligible for a battery replacement . Before they look at it, Apple said you should back up all the content you want to save on iCloud, disable the \"Find My iPhone\" app, and erase all the data and settings on your phone. \nAlthough it's a free replacement, the service may end up costing you money if there are other problems with your phone. Damages, like a cracked screen, need to be fixed before the battery can be replaced. \nIn the event that you've already replaced your phone because of this issue, you may be eligible for a refund.

      "text": "Apple admits problems with iPhone 6 Plus; launches repair progra - WMC Action News 5 - Memphis, Tennessee Member Center: Apple admits problems with iPhone 6 Plus; launches repair program Apple admits problems with iPhone 6 Plus; launches repair program 2016-11-21T18:09:31Z MEMPHIS, TN (WMC) - \nApple will fix it, but you'll pay for it. \nThe company has admitted to issues with the iPhone 6 Plus first exposed in this WMC Action News 5 investigation and has launched a repair program to fix affected models at the customers' expense. \nAccording to its repair program protocol , Apple will repair any iPhone 6 Plus exhibiting the symptoms at a cost of $149. For consumers who have already had their iPhone 6 Plus devices repaired for more than $149, the company will reimburse the difference. \nApple has essentially blamed its customers for the device's flickering and unresponsive screens, coined as the \"touch disease\" by computer repair trade blog Motherboard. \"Apple has determined that some iPhone 6 Plus devices may exhibit display flickering or Multi-Touch issues after being dropped multiple times on a hard surface and then incurring further stress on the device,\" the company said in a statement on its website. \nBut in our investigation, a former Apple Genius technician who asked not to be identified explained the flickering and unresponsiveness are due to an inherent defect in the iPhone 6 Plus. \"It is not the display that's causing it,\" the technician said. \"It's the actual main logic board that the display attaches to. Somewhere in there is actually causing that display to flicker. It is an inherent defect.This has been happening since at least last summer.\" \nThomas Bledsoe, owner and chief technician of iRepear in Bartlett, Tennessee, and Motherboard said the device's defect is centered at the \"touch IC\" chips inside the phone. They are the chips which convert finger touches and swipes into machine-readable phone functions. Both Motherboard and Bledsoe said the chips are losing their solder, causing them to detach and lose their ability to detect touches on the display screens. \n\"It is a manufacturing defect,\" Bledsoe said. \"It has been an issue for a lot of customers. I think the iPhone 6 Plus should be recalled under a certain criteria if it's functioning like that, not having the touch functionality.\" \nApple, whose media staff did not respond to three emails and a voice mail, has not indicated any plan to recall the iPhone 6 Plus. \nCopyright 2016 WMC Action News 5.

      "text": "Developer brings classic FPS Doom to Touch Bar on Apple's MacBook Pro  47 am PT (01:47 pm ET) In an unusual proof of its versatility, one developer has managed to get id Software's original Doom running on the new MacBook Pro's Touch Bar. The port —by Adam Bell —isn't available publicly, presumably in part because it's impractical to play. The Touch Bar uses a 2170-by-60 display, which squashes the game's vertical resolution so much that levels and enemies become indistinguishable. It is technically playable however, complete with music and sound effects pumped through the Pro's speakers. The Touch Bar is meant to be a function key replacement, displaying context-sensitive controls that go beyond regular buttons, thanks to a multitouch display. Because it has its own dedicated processor —the Apple T1 —it appears to be capable of running self-contained apps, though this falls outside of official guidelines. Running id games like Doom , Quake , and Wolfenstein 3D is often one way developers will test the capabilities of new hardware, despite some of the titles being decades old. The first Doom dates back to 1993, and even Quake was released in 1996. The 2016 Doom reboot is sometimes considered a good way of testing high-end gaming PCs. Topics:",

      "text": "Saying goodbye to AirPort as Apple closes its wireless router division Saying goodbye to AirPort as Apple closes its wireless router division Posted: Tags : Accessories - Accessories + Apple - Apple + When you think of Apple, what products come to mind first? The iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, iMac, and MacBook are probably the most common, but those items are far from the only gadgets that Apple creates. Since 1999, Apple has been creating AirPort routers. The company's very first base station launched that same year, and Apple has continuously released new products and updates to that hardware line. However, according to a new report, it looks like Apple is finally calling it quits with the wireless router game - and, consequently, the AirPort line as we know it. This report comes by way of Bloomberg who has an anonymous source within Apple that claims engineers who were working on the AirPort line has been officially moved to work on the Apple TV and other products. As disappointing as this may come to some of you who have been fans of the AirPort line, it doesn't come as too much of a surprise when looking at how Apple has been handling AirPort over the past few years. The current line of AirPort products includes the AirPort Extreme, AirPort Express, and Time Capsule. The AirPort Express has yet to be updated from last-gen 802.11n Wi-Fi technology, and while the Time Capsule and AirPort Extreme were updated to 802.11ac, that's the last refresh the products have seen since they got the upgrade back in 2013. Top all of this off with the fact that Apple stopped selling both the AirPort Extreme and Time Capsule from their US stores back in May, and it becomes quite clear to see that the AirPort legacy is officially on its way out the door for good. Apple has now left both the monitor and router market. Routers aren't the only venture that Apple's looking to get out of though. Just a few weeks ago, the company announced that they would officially be leaving the monitor business and wouldn't be updating either the Thunderbolt or Cinema Display products that currently exist either. It's disappointing news for the select fans still enjoy these gadgets, but it's a telling sign of Apple's plans for the future. iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, Macs, and Apple TV look to be the way of the future for the company. Older gadgets may be getting the ax, but all that does is allow Apple to focus more of the gadgets that it feels will be the most beneficial to them in the long haul.",

      "text": "McLaren Says It Isn't Looking to Sell, Apple Didn't Offer a Bid The British supercar maker is clearing the air over rumors of a potential sale. twitter.com/aaronmaxb instagram.com/aaronmaxb \nPrevious reports have claimed that shareholders of British supercar-maker and Formula One team McLaren have been working to sell off majority shares of the company, but the company's CEO has confirmed that is not the case. \nLast Tuesday, McLaren saw the departure of its CEO of 36 years, Ron Dennis . Sky News reported his leave came after backlash from other shareholders who opposed a Chinese takeover offer that Dennis supported. \nWhen questioned by Reuters , McLaren's acting chief executive, Mike Flewitt, said the company has seen interest from outside parties, but its shareholders are hard-set on keeping their stakes. \n\"There have been a number of bids,\" Flewitt said to Reuters . \"I am comfortable with where our current shareholders are that they want to retain ownership of the company...They want to develop both companies. I genuinely believe they are very committed to them.\" \nIn September, The Drive reported that McLaren was in talks with Apple in regards to a potential buy-out. Following that story, a spokesperson from the automaker commented, \"We can confirm that McLaren is not in discussion with Apple in respect of any potential investment.” In the Reuters story, Flewitt confirmed once again Apple did not propose an offer. \n\"There wasn't a bid from Apple,\" said Flewitt. \"They visited. We talked. We talked about what they did. We talked about what we did. They toured. It never matured to a definitive proposition.\" \nAs Reuters notes, Dennis, Bahrain-based investment group Mumtalakat, and a holding company owned by the former owner of TAG Heuer watches are the three top shareholders of McLaren. They are also the owners of McLaren Technology Group, which manages the automaker's F1 team and technology research operations.",

Twelve South’s HiRise Duet Does Double Duty to Charge an iPhone and Apple Watch The stand works with most cases and sleeves by Brent Dirks November 21, 2016 \nJust in time for the holiday shopping season, Twelve South is back with a new accessory that would be perfect for any Apple fan with both an iPhone and Apple Watch. The HiRise Duet can charge both devices simultaneously. Featuring Nightstand Mode Featuring Nightstand Mode \nAlong with your iPhone, the stand is also compatible with an iPad mini or the smaller iPad Pro. \nThe best feature of the stand is its built-in Lightning and Apple Watch chargers. That means you won’t need to provide your own cables as the device is powered by a single AC cord \nYou’ll place the iPhone on top of the stand while the watch is placed on the base protected with a layer of soft leather. The HiRise Duet is also the first dual charging stand that can place an Apple Watch into Nightstand Mode. \nWhen placed on its side to charge, the special display will illuminate when you press the Digital Crown, side button, or the screen. It will show the current time, date, and any alarms that you’ve set. When the alarm sounds, press the side button to turn it off or the Digital Crown to snooze. \nAs a nice touch, the stand can accommodate most iPhones protected with a case or sleeve. It can even be used to charge an iPad mini or smaller iPad Pro. \nThe all-metal HiRise Duet weighs a little less than a pound and shouldn’t slide around your desk or nightstand. Purchase now \nThe charging stand retails for $119.99 and is viable to purchase now directly from Twelve South. \nAnd definitely make sure to keep an eye out as we’ll have a complete review of the HiRise Duet before the end of the week.

      "text": "There’s cheap, plasticky gloss and then there’s what’s supposedly “premium” gloss — take Apple’s Jet Black finish on the iPhone 7 . Then there’s demiglace, something you should try with your next turkey.\nSpeaking of turkeys, Samsung continues to keep its rotors going as it leaves behind a turkey of a recalled phone in the Galaxy Note 7 . What took its place? A new color of Galaxy S7 edge: Blue Coral . But shouldn’t the Galaxy S7 get some painted love, too?\nAccording to sources to The Investor in Korea, we may see a revitalized black color for the regular ‘ol phone come “early next month.” There’s already a matte Black Onyx finish up for the S7 and S7 edge (you see it above with the Galaxy Note 7), so if Samsung wants to pull off an Apple move, now’s the time — iPhone 7 demand is suspected to be declining .\nThe post Glossy black Galaxy S7 could soon fight against Jet Black iPhone 7 appeared first on Pocketnow .\n",

      "text": "Apple offers free battery replacement for iPhone 6S shutdown problem Posted: Updated: Apple on Wednesday, September 9, 2015, announced the iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus. The new phone features a Multi-Touch interface, 3D Touch, and a new case with 7000 series aluminum. The European Union is looking to impose new quota on services like Netflix, iTunes and Amazon, forcing them to dedicate at least 20% of their catalogs to European content. By Sherisse Pham \nHONG KONG (CNNMoney) -- Apple has admitted that some iPhone 6S devices can suddenly shut down for no apparent reason. \nThe tech giant is offering owners of the problematic smartphones free replacement batteries. \n\"A very small number\" of iPhone 6S devices manufactured between September and October 2015 are affected, Apple said in a statement Monday. It didn't provide details on the battery fault that is causing the phones to unexpectedly go dark. \nApple's announcement comes less than a week after a consumer watch group in China launched an investigation into the problem. \n\"A considerable number\" of Chinese users reported their iPhone 6 and 6S devices would suddenly turn off despite showing plenty of battery life, the China Consumers Association said in a statement. The phones would not turn back on even when plugged into chargers, according to the consumer group. \nApple said the battery problem is \"not a safety issue.\" Its big rival Samsung pulled its flagship Galaxy Note 7 smartphone after repeated reports of the devices bursting into flames. Samsung initially said batteries in some Note 7 phones were to blame but is yet to fully explain the cause. \nApple's battery replacement offer for the iPhone 6S applies worldwide. Owners of eligible phones with cracked screens will have to repair them before getting the new battery, Apple said. \nConsumers were plagued by a similar iPhone problem earlier this year. A software glitch with the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus caused the battery icon to display more battery life than was actually left, leaving many people frustrated when their phones appeared to suddenly shut down. The company fixed the problem with an operating system update. \nAnd just last week, Apple acknowledged iPhone 6 Plus devices suffer from \"Touch Disease\" -- when the phone's touchscreen stops working after it has been bent or repeatedly dropped on the floor. \nThe tech company rolled out a repair program, charging customers $149 to cure the disease. \nTM &© 2016 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

      "text": "Frankenstein Opens His Heart in Apple's Sweet Holiday Tale Brand Delivers Message of Open Arms By Ann-Christine Diaz. Published on Nov 21, 2016 Editor's Pick \nHalloween's over, but Frankenstein has come out of hiding for Christmas in a sweet holiday film from Apple. \nThe spot opens on the famous monster, alone in his home recording a music box rendition of \"(There's No Place Like) Home for the Holidays\" onto his iPhone. He then dusts off his hat, picks up a package and heads into town, drawing gasps from the folks around the village Christmas tree. He opens his package, which, it turns out, contains a pair of colored lightbulbs, which he then plugs into the bolts on each side of his neck. As they light up red and green, he begins to sing along to the tune on his phone. But there's a hiccup when the green bulb short circuits and goes out and Frankenstein goes mute. \nAs the townsfolk look on with befuddlement, a young girl walks up to \"Frankie,\" re-lights the bulb with a quick twist and continues the song with him. After a bit of hesitation, the rest join in, bringing joy to Frankie's nervous mug. \nThe endline reads, \"Open your heart to everyone.\" -- a message that resonates powerfully given the various events that have divided the U.S. -- and the rest of the world, in the past year. \nActor/comedian Brad Garrett, perhaps best known for his role as Robert Barone on \"Everybody Loves Raymond,\" plays the part of Frankie. Park Pictures' Lance Acord, who directed previous Apple holiday spots such as \"The Song\" and the Emmy-awarded \"Misunderstood,\" returned to the camera for this ad. Rate  ",

      "text": "Apple replacing faulty iPhone 6S batteries Apple iPhone 6S Not long after taking care of the \"touch disease\" problem that affected particular iPhone 6 Plus handsets, Apple has to face another issue with the iPhone 6 lineup. The Cupertino-based company begins a battery replacement program for iPhone 6S owners affected by unexpected shutdowns. by Codrut Nistor, 2016/11/21 Apple iPhone Accessory Working For Notebookcheck Are you a loyal reader of notebookcheck? Are you a techie who knows how to write? Then join our Team! Especially wanted: German-English-Translator - Details here Batteries seem to be a source of problems for many big companies, including laptop makers and handset makers. Samsung had to kill the Galaxy Note 7 due to such issues, and now the time has come for Apple. Fortunately, they are not dropping any product yet, only replacing the faulty batteries for now. According to an official Apple Support page, the company \"has determined that a very small number of iPhone 6s devices may unexpectedly shut down. This is not a safety issue and only affects devices within a limited serial number range that were manufactured between September and October 2015.\" Those who experienced unexpected shutdown issue should visit an Apple Retail Store or an Apple Authorized Service Provider to confirm eligibility for a free of charge battery replacement. Sadly, this program does not extend the standard warranty coverage and only covers affected batteries for three years after the first retail sale of the unit. See our Top 10 Notebooks:",

      "text": "Reddit \nGoogle’s new home networking system, Google WiFi, may not be actually out juggling internet packets in users homes yet, but that hasn’t stopped the company from declaring a premature mesh victory. Announced in early October, the cylindrical router doesn’t just aim to replicate what the existing OnHub does, but goes beyond it by allowing multiple units to work together. It’s called mesh networking and, while Google isn’t the first company to attempt it in the home, the search giant is claiming to be best at it. \nAs a single unit, Google WiFi works much as a regular router does: sharing out a single internet connection with multiple wirelessly-connected devices, whether they be your smartphone, laptop, smart TV, games console, or something else. The mesh aspect comes in when two or more Google WiFi boxes are combined. Then, they identify as a single network, with clients wirelessly connecting to whichever is closest. \nThe upshot is that those with large properties – or places that are less conducive to wireless networks in general, through having concrete walls or being spread over several levels, for instance – can extend coverage without having to run physical ethernet cables. There’s no worry about roaming between hotspots with different SSID names or having to manually choose the router with the strongest signal. If you have three or more Google WiFi units, network traffic automatically takes the most efficient path between routers. \nIt’s clever, but it’s not Google’s idea. Indeed, several other firms offer home mesh networking. Eero and Luma are probably the best known, and though Google WiFi still isn’t the wild yet – individual units are up for preorder at $129 each or $299 for three – that hasn’t stopped the company from going on the offensive early. \nIt sent out a set of units to testing firm Allion USA, which installed them – along with Eero and Luma – in a 3,000 square foot home spread over two floors, then tested throughput speeds with a MacBook Air. As Google probably hoped, performance of Google WiFi turned out to be best, though it’s worth noting that it’s not by a consistent degree. In short, the nature of your building, the position of your router(s), and the place you’re using a device could have a more significant impact than the specific router hardware you’re using. \nLuma and Eero are yet to comment specifically on the results of the testing, but they’re unlikely to take Google’s challenge lying down. In fact, Eero pre-empted Google WiFi’s arrival with a firmware update last week promising boosted speeds, among other things. Dubbed TrueMesh, it could as much as double throughput, Eero suggests. It’s unclear whether Allion’s testing was done with this latest Eero firmware or an older version. \nMeanwhile, according to the latest leaks from inside Cupertino, Apple is headed in the opposite direction . It’s looking increasingly likely that the current AirPort Extreme, AirPort Express, and AirPort Time Capsule range of routers and network-attached storage won’t ever see a refresh. Untouched since 2013, the wireless line-up had begun to look sluggish compared to the latest 802.11ac hardware from more traditional networking companies like Belkin, D-Link, and Netgear. \nNetworking has undoubtedly been a minor point in Apple’s portfolio for some time now. The company doesn’t break out individual router sales, instead lumping them into the nebulous “Other” category that includes Apple Watch, Apple TV, Beats products, iPod, and Apple-branded and third-party accessories for its financial reporting. What we do know is that “Other” products only contributed 5-percent to Apple’s revenues in the most recent period. \nAlthough Apple is yet to comment on the rumors, it’s not hard to see that ditching networking hardware would make a lot of sense for the firm. Investing into routers and other such products made sense back when the segment as a whole was less mature. After all, it allowed Apple to refine the user-experience of getting several of its devices online, not to mention push its vision of high-speed wireless as it moved away from physical connections and cables. \nSince then, though, wireless has been embraced more thoroughly and consistently. 802.11ac routers are commonplace, even from cable internet providers, and the UX of getting online is far more broadly understood. Apple, which made almost three times as much from services – which includes iCloud and Apple Music streaming – as it did from the “Other” category in the last quarter, can instead focus on what those high-speed connections are used for. \nNOW READ: What you need to know about Google WiFi \nGoogle, though it has hardware like Pixel smartphones and Chromebook notebooks, has a vested interest in increasing the speed at which online services are experienced around the home. After all, its business is based on search and other cloud-based products. If they can be consumed more readily, that raises overall user-experience. \nWe’ll need to try out Google WiFi ourselves to see if this third-party testing holds true in other environments, but there’s no denying that we’ve moved beyond prioritizing just speed and into more consistent service wherever we end up with our wireless devices. Google WiFi is set to ship on December 5, according to the company.",

      "title": "Apple Lacks Courage, Says Oppenheimer; A Decade-Long Malaise?",
      "text": "By Tiernan Ray Oppenheimer & Co .’s Andrew Uerkwitz today reiterates a “Perform” rating on shares of Apple ( AAPL ), writing that the company “lacks the courage to lead the next generation of innovation (AI, cloud-based services, messaging),” and as a result, “Over the next decade we believe the stock will generally underperform the market.”\n“We believe Apple is about to embark on a decade-long malaise ,” concludes Uerkwitz.\nWe believe Apple is about to embark on a decade-long malaise. The risks to the company have never been greater. However, we believe its strong profitability, a cash hoard for protection, and one last “growth” hurrah from the tenth anniversary phone will keep investors interested in the company. Our Perform rating is unchanged for now. \n(Contrast this report with the bullish note today from Canaccord Genuity ’s Mike Walkley .)\nApple shares are up $1.66, or 1.5%, at $111.72.\nBy June 29th of next year, writes Uerkwitz, the iPhone will be ten years old, Apple will have sold 1.2 billion units, and sales will probably “peak” at 245 million, he thinks, which he refers to as the first “ crack ” in its empire. Prices may even peak, with the next model, he thinks, as “fewer hardware breakthroughs are available today that can trigger favorable mix shift.”\nNor is he impressed with Apple’s software and its services offerings. Even though they are “the most effective defense from competition,” he thinks there’s “plenty of competitors that can seriously harm Apple’s ecosystem with software and services.”\n“We believe the cracks are showing in the Apple wall of invulnerability,” he writes.\nDespite Apple’s great effort at plugging holes with thumbs (inducing favorable mix shift and higher ASP), we see iPhone unit growth dropping to low single-digits in the next four years (FY16- FY20) at a CAGR of 2%. We believe that fewer new user additions and a more diversified installed base will significantly impact the sustainability and consistency of iPhone shipment growth in the next five years. We present our estimated installed base growth trajectory from 2016 to 2020 as follows. \nThat model shows the installed base rising from 677 million as of the fiscal year that ended in September, to 943 million by the end of 2020.\nTo Uerkwitz, the 8% decline in shipments this past fiscal year, despite a rise in installed base, was “the dual impact of lower new user additions and an elongated replacement cycle ─the two headwinds often go together as the result of a weaker product cycle.”\nAs subsidies dry up , and as features become not as impressive at the high end of the smartphone market, growth is slowing overall for the most expensive devices, including the iPhone, and “the high-end smartphone segment is slowing down faster than other segments, due to the closing performance gap between lower end phones and higher end phones.”\nAnd India , he believes, can’t pick up the slack, as “emerging regions such as India and Southeast Asia still have the market potential given their low 4G penetration and large population, but iPhones’ premium pricing may prohibit much near-term revenue upside from those emerging areas.”\nAnd new categories seem to have dried up for Apple, he believes: “We believe in the near term it is very difficult to find anything bigger than the iPhone or iPad. Moreover, it is increasingly difficult to build on the proven success of current devices by filling the gaps with different sized displays and add-on functionalities.”\nIn Steve Jobs’ words, a computer is “a bicycle for our minds”; desktop PCs, laptops, tablets, smartphones are simply different forms of that bicycle. We are confident in saying that the need for such a bicycle is here to stay, but the question is: what form will it take after the smartphone? It could be an earpiece, it could a pair of glasses, it could be a watch, and it could be some electronics to be embedded in our bodies. We believe the third option is the most likely in the near term, for its market potential, feasibility, and strategic fit with Apple’s identity. A head-mounted computing device can introduce a new paradigm for human computing interface, something Apple is the most adept at. Bottom Line We believe there are only a few product categories for Apple to enter in order to resume growth when the iPhone slows down. Head-mounted displays, or AR/VR headsets, have the most potential, but near-term technical hurdles are also substantial for these devices to become a mass-market success. \nAs for software, he argues apps may fade, as more and more popular services can be used in a number of ways, such as by messaging. “One will no longer just be able to order an Uber via a smartphone app, but be able to do it through messaging or voice activated speaker or any device that is connected to the cloud – and all without “downloading” a native app.”\nAnd Apple is losing the battle for A.I., he believes, which is becoming “the new operating system, the new interface”:\nApple (Siri), Facebook (bots), Google (Google Assistant), Amazon (Alexa), and Microsoft (Cortana) have showed us a glimpse of the future. In this AI-dominated future, apps, apps- turned-platforms, and mobile operating systems may all disappear into the background, “hide” inside the microphone arrays, or show up as a contact on your messenger app. It could be everywhere─Siri is still working when users are silently swiping their phones, giving restaurant recommendations and triggering review apps when it notices users are planning a dinner date in chat. Facebook apps and the Google Assistant app could do the same, on both iOS and Android platforms, removing the operating system’s role as the glue of all apps, services, and people on one’s social network. Apple originally had a two- to three-year head start on AI with the acquisition of Siri. But Siri’s development since Apple took over in late 2011 is best characterized as sluggish. It took Apple almost five years to open up Siri to third-party developers (a critical move to make it more usable by more people). Amazon and Google released products recently that are highly competitive, if not superior to Siri, and with broader support to third-party services and devices. The same disappointment can be found in many other native apps: iOS-Music, Camera/Photos, and iMessage all had years of head start, but only received key improvements as a reaction to superior third-party apps and services. Apple never seems to maintain its dominating lead in hardware in its software and services. But software and services will play a heavier role in the future of mobile user experience […] With the trends above, Apple may lose its edge as a leading innovator for interface.",

      "text": "Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends \nThe MacBook Pro with Touch Bar has finally landed, and some users are turning a critical eye toward Apple’s design decisions — and now Apple’s own Phil Schiller has personally addressed some of those concerns. Specifically, Schiller responded to an email from software developer Ben Slaney, who asked the Apple marketing chief why the new slate of MacBook Pros topped out at 16GB of RAM. \n“The MacBook Pro uses 16GB of very fast LPDDR memory, up to 2133MHz. To support 32GB of memory would require using DDR memory that is not low power and also require a different design of the logic board which might reduce space for batteries. Both factors would reduce battery life,” Schiller said in an email to developer Ben Slaney. \nAccording to MacRumors , it’s not the first time Phil Schiller has answered this question, in fact it seems like he’s been defending the decision to cap the premium MacBook Pro at 16GB of RAM since the announcement of the new laptop’s specs on October 27. \nMore: The Touch Bar adds unique functionality to the MacBook Pro, including the ability to play Doom on a tiny screen. \n“To put more than 16GB of fast RAM into a notebook design at this time would require a memory system that consumes much more power and wouldn’t be efficient enough for a notebook. I hope you check out this new generation MacBook Pro, it really is an incredible system,” Schiller wrote to another concerned potential customer in October. \nSo it appears the decision to cap RAM at 16GB was made based on fears over energy efficiency, and on the decision to use LPDDR3 RAM, which is unavailable in sizes larger than 16GB. In order to expand the RAM available without losing out too much on battery life, Apple would have had to use a different CPU, since Intel’s sixth-generation Skylake chips don’t support LPDDR4 RAM, which is faster and more energy efficient than the LPDDR3 standard.

      "text": "Learn More \nApple has launched its second iPhone repair in less than a week, this time to deal with a battery issue on some iPhone 6S handsets that causes them to suddenly shut down without warning even when there’s plenty of juice remaining. \nIn a message on its website posted on Sunday , the tech titan said the problem affects only “a very small number” of iPhone 6S devices and is “not a safety issue.” \nAccording to Apple, the flaw affects devices that were manufactured between September and October 2015, which is when the phone launched. Anyone with an iPhone 6S that’s been experiencing the issue is told to visit an Apple Store or one of its authorized outlets to get their phone’s serial number checked to confirm eligibility for a free battery replacement. \nIf you’ve already replaced your iPhone 6S battery because of this specific issue, Apple asks that you get in touch to discuss the possibility of obtaining a refund. \nFinally, if you believe your 6S is suffering sudden shutdowns and you intend to take it in for repair, the Cupertino company insists that you first sort out any other issues with the phone, such as a cracked display. \nThe repair program, which doesn’t appear to be country-specific, comes just a few days after the China Consumers Association asked Apple to look into what appears to be the same issue, although the organization suggested it affects not only the iPhone 6S but the iPhone 6, too. To be clear, the repair program that Apple launched on Sunday covers defective iPhone 6S units only. \nMore: DT’s hands-on review of the iPhone 6S \nThis latest repair program follows another one launched by Apple last week in response to the so-called “Touch Disease” issue affecting some iPhone 6 Plus units. The problem causes a flickering gray bar to appear at the top of the display, and can culminate in the touchscreen becoming totally unresponsive. \nApple ran into some criticism for charging $149 for the repair, with the company claiming the problem occurs as a result of the phone being “dropped multiple times on a hard surface and then incurring further stress on the device” rather than any issue with its manufacturing process.

      "title": "Apple MacBook Pro 2016 review, from a video editor",
      "text": "The new MacBook Pro Touch Bar. Hollis Johnson/Business Insider\nApple's redesigned MacBook Pro has been surrounded by controversy since it was first announced a few weeks ago.\nEven though Apple says the new MacBook Pro is its best-selling version of the computer to date, it has received loads of blowback from the professional community. Those are the power users that need high-end computers for video editing, coding apps, or photo editing.\nThe most common complaints are the lack of ports and power compared to rival computers. For example, you can only get up to 16GB of RAM, while many are asking for 32GB of RAM. The MacBook Pro also only has one type of port called Thunderbolt 3, which makes it tough for those who need SD card slots or HDMI ports to connect their external monitors.\nSo while I already tested the MacBook Pro from a generalist's perspective , I thought it'd be worth it to have one of our own in-house professionals give the computer a spin. Justin Gmoser, one of our video producers here at Business Insider, has been testing the 15-inch model of the MacBook Pro for a little over a week. I had him detail some of his thoughts from a video editor's perspective.\nHere's what he told me.\nThunderbolt/USB-C There are four Thunderbolt 3 ports on the 15-inch MacBook Pro. These are used to charge the computer and connect accessories using the new USB-C standard that will eventually replace the \"regular\" USB you're used to.\nJustin said Thunderbolt 3 was a big issue for him, since he often uses a USB thumbdrive to transfer video to his Mac. But with Thunderbolt, he has to use an adapter. This was a major problem for Justin.\n\"In the video production industry, we are still plugging in USB hard drives and swapping sticks of footage all the time,\" he told me. He was also dismayed at the lack of SD card reader, which is essential for a lot of video and photo professionals when they want to transfer their shots to a MacBook.\nHollis Johnson/Business Insider\nAfter hearing a lot of negative feedback, Apple decided to slash the prices of USB-C accessories through the end of 2016 to help ease the transition. It's a nice move, but a lot of professionals would rather have a computer that just works with the accessories they already have.\nPerformance Justin said importing video and overall performance was fast and fluid, which is essential for his work. No problems there. He also enjoyed the updated speakers.\n\"The sound is richer than the older MacBooks, with deeper lows and less of that tinny sound that's typical with older laptops,\" he told me. \"This is good for those times you want to edit without headphones or show coworkers or clients some playback.\"\nJustin also enjoyed using the Touch Bar for volume adjustments, which he said gave him better overall control because you now have the option to use a slider instead of tapping a button.\nEditing video with Final Cut Pro Out of the dozens of video producers we have at Business Insider, Justin is one of two that use Final Cut Pro instead of Adobe Premiere. So, luckily for him, Final Cut has been updated to work with the MacBook Pro's new Touch Bar.\nYour browser does not support the video tag. Justin Gmoser/Business Insider\nOverall, Justin liked how the Touch Bar keys changed as he moused over certain options in Final Cut Pro. For example, it made it easier to adjust and format text he adds to his videos. But since he's developed a lot of muscle memory over the years for shortcuts, he wishes the app let him customize which keys would show up in the Touch Bar.\nYour browser does not support the video tag. Justin Gmoser/Business Insider Thunderbolt 3 ports on the MacBook Pro.\nFinal Cut also lets you scrub through a video timeline on the Touch Bar, which Justin thought was a cool feature. But he said it's not faster than using the traditional trackpad or keyboard. He said it'd be better if the Touch Bar just showed you an overview of where things are in your timeline, making it easier to jump around.\nConclusion Overall, the MacBook Pro was plenty fast and powerful for Justin's work. But when it comes to the Touch Bar, he doesn't think it's totally necessary for most people.\n\"I don't think it will be a determining factor for people to buy it,\" he told me. \"It can be helpful at times, but I think a keyboard and mouse will always be faster.\"\nStill, he sees potential with the Touch Bar for video editors, especially if Apple allows them to customize the buttons in Final Cut Pro. In fact, he'd like to see the Touch Bar incorporated into desktop keyboards for Mac as the it gains more capabilities.\nSEE ALSO: The MacBook Pro review More: MacBook Pro Apple Final Cut Pro usb-c Thunderbolt 3 Touch Bar Video editing Editing microSD",

      "text": "Apple's Jony Ive helped design a Christmas tree with no lights It's interesting, just... not what you expect for the holidays. Share Save \nJony Ive and Marc Newson have designed a range of products that have little to do with their work at Apple, but their latest is something special. They've worked with set designer Michael Howells on the Claridge's Christmas tree for 2016, and it largely lives up to your \"if Jony Ive designed this, it would...\" stereotypes. There are no conventional tree lights in this hotel display -- there are 13-foot light boxes beaming images of snow-covered birches, but the actual tree arrangement is bare. These, the \"pure white floor\" and photographed backdrops are meant to create an \"all-enveloping magical experience\" that reminds you of a forest in the winter... in a very minimalist way. \nThe collaboration isn't coming out of the blue: Ive and Newson are \"long-time friends\" of Claridge's. And while it's definitely non-traditional, it's also something you'll likely remember if you're a guest during the holidays. However, it's not about to reassure critics concerned that Ive and Newson aren't devoting as much time as they could to Apple products.",

      "text": "Whatever your opinions about the usefulness of the controversial Touch Bar on the new MacBook Pro , know this: it can run the classic PC game Doom.\nRunning Doom is somewhat of a right of passage for tech gadgets, and many programmers and enthusiasts devote time and energy to porting the 1990s-era first-person shooter to all manners of operating systems.\nOne of those enthusiasts, iOS developer Adam Bell, posted a YouTube video of Doom awkwardly running on the narrow MacBook Pro Touch Bar , The Verge reported on Monday. Although the game's graphics are barely recognizable, the soundtrack is loud and clear, so veteran Doom players might be able to navigate it via sounds alone.\n\nThe fact that Bell was able to get Doom up and running on the Touch Bar's 2,170-by-60 display isn't terribly surprising: the Touch Bar is powered by an Apple T1 processor and a modified version of the watchOS operating system, which has been known to run Doom since at least last year.",

      "title": "Apple Stock Rises As Analysts Anticipate Strong iPhone 7 Plus Sales On Black Friday",
      "text": "Apple stock rose steadily on Monday as analysts focused on the mixed bag associated with the iPhone 7 Plus. On one hand, the phone is extremely popular, especially because of Samsung’s recall of the Galaxy Note 7 , but on the other, supply is very constrained. Apple stands well-positioned to capture strong sales this holiday season as the Consumer Technology Association’s recent survey indicated that about 116 million shoppers plan to buy tech or tech accessories sometime during Black Friday week.\nImage source: Apple Apple to benefit from a record week for tech The CTA expects total retail sales to rise by 3.8% this year, which is a slight deceleration from last year’s 3.9% gain. However, spending on tech is expected to grow much more this year than it did last year, Drexel Hamilton analyst Brian White noted in his Nov. 21 that the CTA projects a 3.1% increase in consumer tech spending, compared to last year’s 1.4% increase. The organization also found that 75% of consumers intend to purchase tech as gifts this year, which is a slight increase from last year’s 74%.\nThe survey indicates that most consumers who plan to buy tech during Thanksgiving and Black Friday week intend to purchase TVs. Interestingly, laptops are in second place, demonstrating that the computer market is indeed starting to stabilize.\nHowever, Apple’s new MacBooks could be a factor in that decision. Smartphones are in third place, which places the iPhone maker in a strong position to benefit from the holiday shopping season. Notebook computers are at the top of the tech wish list for 11% of adults, while 8% of adults hope to get a smartphone.\nApple stock rides on return to growth Debate about whether the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus will help Apple return to smartphone unit growth continues, and Canaccord Genuity analyst Michael Walkley is firmly in the growth camp on this one. He said demand for the iPhone 7 is strong and expects steady sales of the phone to enable Apple to return to growth in the December quarter.\nApple stock has been hanging on the iPhone for many years now, and Walkley said in his Nov. 20 report that the company garnered 106% of the premium smartphone market’s profits during the third quarter, compared to 75% in the previous quarter. He believes that Samsung’s recall of the Note 7 has given Apple a boost, and he pegs Note 7 sales at about 20 million units per year, amounting to $5 billion to $6 billion in revenue.\nAnother factor in how well Apple will do this year is the iPhone 7 Plus, which he notes is doing better than the smaller iPhone 7. The problem is that the Plus models are supply constrained, thus keeping a ceiling on the company’s share gains within the premium tier of the smartphone market. Despite this limitation, he expects Apple to end the year with an installed base of more than 570 million iPhones.\nApple stock will underperform: Oppenheimer On the flip side, Oppenheimer analyst Andrew Uerkwitz is predicting that Apple stock will underperform the market for the next 10 years because he expects the company to enter a “decade-long malaise.” He noted that the iPhone turns 10 years old next year, and he expects the tenth anniversary iPhone to be “one last ‘growth’ hurrah” for Apple. He also predicts that the tenth anniversary iPhone will keep investors interested in Apple stock for now, as will the company’s strong profitability and cash war chest.\nIn general though, he thinks the company lacks the guts to lead the way in upcoming areas of innovation, including artificial intelligence, the cloud, and messaging. This is an interesting view, as Apple recently touted its removal of the headphone jack on the iPhone 7 lineup as an act of courage which essentially makes it a trailblazer. It remains to be seen whether this will actually be the case, especially since the company has thus far failed to bring its AirPods to market .\nShares of Apple stock rose by more than 1% to as high as $111.94 during regular trading hours on Monday.\nThe post Apple Stock Rises As Analysts Anticipate Strong iPhone 7 Plus Sales On Black Friday appeared first on ValueWalk .\n",

Will anyone warm to him? Apple preaches inclusiveness with Frankenstein's monster 0 Photo by Apple/YouTube screenshot by Chris Matyszczyk/CNET \nOh, you rebellious tech companies. \nWe're supposed to be happily divisive right now, but you have to carry on with your kumbaya, embrace-all-the-people-of-the-world messages. \nFirst it was Amazon offering a message for the holidays that confronted Islamophobia . Now along comes Apple with its own holiday ad , which suggests that even monsters are alright. Specifically, Frankenstein's monster. \nHe's been alone in the mountains for a while, and he's tired of being a monster. Yes, even monsters get fed up with who they are and how they behave. More Technically Incorrect Kanye West storms out of concert, Twitter loses mind \nSo he makes a long trek through the snow to find human succor. But first he records a festive ditty on his iPhone . Who wouldn't imagine that monsters have iPhones? \nHe arrives in a little town, and he's not immediately welcome. Well, he's a shabby, frightening sort. Worse, he inserts little Christmas lights into his neck and lights them up. Who does that? \nThen he tries to serenade the locals. They're not moved. Well, other than being freaked. \nBut this is Hollywood-esque. So you know that a child will come in, save the day and teach those silly adults how to be human. \nThe message at the end: \"Open your heart to everyone.\" \nI wonder how much heart-opening there will be in the coming year. And how much heart-stopping. Share your voice",

      "text": "Linked By John Voorhees \nMany of Apple’s hardware products are built overseas, but that’s only part of the story. The New York Times takes a look at Apple’s impact on jobs in the United States , focusing special attention on Austin, Texas where Apple fills a seven-building complex of tech support specialists, microchip engineers, supply chain managers, and people who work in Apple Music, the App Store, and Maps: \nApple’s overall contribution to the American economy is significant. Beyond the 80,000 people it directly employs in the United States, it says 69 supplier facilities in 33 states manufacture parts that go into its products. Hundreds of thousands of software developers also write apps for iPhones and iPads. \nTechnical support call center employees earn around $30,000 per year, but the average in Austin is around $77,000. Asked by The New York Times whether it planned to expand operations in Austin, Apple said: \n“Apple has created over two million jobs in the United States since the introduction of the iPhone nine years ago, including explosive growth in iOS developers, thousands of new supplier and manufacturing partners, and a 400 percent increase in our employee teams,” the company said in a statement. “We made the unique decision to keep and expand our contact centers for customers in the Americas in the United States, and Austin is home to many of those employees. We plan to continue to invest and grow across the U.S.” \nApple’s Austin offices have grown a lot over time, but don’t get much attention despite their size. The New York Times’ article is an interesting overview of the breadth of Apple’s impact on the US economy and peek inside Apple’s Texas offices.",

      "text": "See full gallery on TechnoBuffalo Apple’s new MacBook Pro is still experiencing a lot of criticism of over the omission of important pro tools. One of those omissions was the lack of RAM options beyond 16GB. Apple isn’t sitting still and is responding to the controversy, trying to clarify why it didn’t include a 32GB option.\n“The MacBook Pro uses 16GB of very fast LPDDR memory, up to 2133MHZ,” Apple’s Phil Schiller explained to MacDaddy , responding to the question about the RAM issue. “To support 32GB of memory would require using DDR memory that is now low power and also require a different design of the logic board which might reduce space for batteries. Both factors would reduce battery life.”\nThis answer falls in line with Apple’s previous answers to the question. It’s also not surprising to see Apple to take such a stand. LPDDR3 RAM, which is more efficient than other options, caps out at 16GB. Anything higher than that and Apple would have to use a different CPU given the current MacBook Pro chip (Intel Skylake) doesn’t support LPDDR4 RAM. This would have made the shift a fragmented mess.\nApple made the tough but correct decision with new MacBook Pro’s RAM This is no doubt frustrating for some users, but it seems to be the only way Apple was willing to deal with the situation. With reviews already coming out, battery life is turning out to be not as good as with previous MacBook Pros. We recently got the new MacBook Pros into the office and can confirm the battery life on the Touch Bar MacBooks isn’t anything to brag about, but we’ll leave the rest of our conclusions until the final review. We can only imagine just how terrible battery life would have been with 32GB of RAM, if Apple’s claims that it would cut battery life are indeed true.\n\n\nSource : MacDaddy ",

(Source: EEIM/Wikicommons) \n(KGO/CNN) - Apple is offering batteries to some iPhone 6 users whose phones abruptly shut down. \nApple said in a statement on Monday that a \"very small number\" of devices made between September and October 2015 are affected. The tech giant's announcement comes less than a week after a consumer watch group in China launched an investigation into the problem. \nThe China Consumers Association said in a statement that \"a considerable number of Chinese iPhone 6 and 6s users reported the problem.\" \nApple says the problem is not a safety issue. \nThe battery replacement offer for the iPhone 6 is being issued worldwide. \nCopyright 2016 KGO via CNN.

      "text": "Apple's Touch Bar can technically play 'Doom' but there is no reason to do so on Nov 21, 2016, 3:46 PM TechSpot \nFew games have been as groundbreaking for their time as id Software’s smash hit Doom . Rapidly approaching its 25 th anniversary, the iconic first-person shooter has refused to go quietly into the night with installments now available across a number of different platforms. \nI’m not referring to the franchise in general but rather, the 1993 original. \nNostalgia-chasers and retro gamers alike have dedicated a significant amount of time and effort over the years to bring Doom to all sorts of wacky platforms. Printer ? Check. Calculator ? Yep. iPod ? No problem. NES Classic ? You bet. \nHeck, you can even play other games inside of Doom… like No Man’s Sky and yes, Doom itself . \nThe latest unlikely platform to gain support for Doom is Apple’s new MacBook Pro … not the OS, mind you, but the Touch Bar that replaces the function keys across the top of the keyboard. With its ultra-wide resolution, the Touch Bar is without a doubt one of the least practical platforms for playing Doom but again, the fact that Facebook engineer Adam Bell was able to do it is what's important here. \nAs for the Touch Bar itself, the jury is still out on whether or not it’ll fall into the category of useful feature or gimmick addition. I personally think it’s the latter but I digress. \nP.S. - If you're interested in tinkering around with the Touch Bar but don't have a new MacBook Pro, you can use this handy app to simulate the OLED strip on your screen.

      "title": "Report: Apple Ditches Another Product Line With End Of Wireless Router Development",
      "text": "Printer-friendly version Email this CRN article \nThe shift in priorities at Apple is continuing as the company reportedly has pulled the plug on development of its AirPort wireless routers. \nBloomberg reported that Apple has moved engineers that were part of the router development team onto other products, such as Apple TV. \nThe move follows Apple's discontinuation of its Thunderbolt external monitor in June. Bloomberg quoted unnamed sources saying the Cupertino, Calif.-based company is looking to increase its focus on consumer products. \n[Related: Apple Reports Plunging Mac Sales Amid First Drop In Annual Revenue In 15 Years ] \nJeff Keenan, president and CEO of East Hampton, Conn.-based wireless solution provider Keenan Systems, said Apple AirPort routers really have only been appropriate for the consumer market. \n\"It's a consumer device that may work OK in part of your house, but it's not meant for any type of business use,\" Keenan said of the AirPort routers. \"Some businesses try to deploy it that way. But when I start talking to them, we switch them to something like EnGenius or Ruckus.\" \nKeenan said he's worked with some schools, for instance, that used Apple computers and thus believed that using Apple AirPort would be ideal for providing Wi-Fi access to those computers. \nBut most education settings need an access point that \"can handle super-high density,\" he said. \"There are not many access points out there that can handle the hundreds of connections at a time that you might see in the classroom.\" \nAccess points from Brocade-owned Ruckus Wireless—which feature Ruckus' BeamFlex Adaptive Antenna Technology—are among those that are a match for that sort of density, Keenan said. \nUltimately, in terms of Apple's reported abandonment of development on routers, \"It doesn't surprise me that they're getting out of it,\" he said. \nAccording to the Bloomberg report, the disbanding of Apple's wireless routing development team has been in progress for the past year, and the AirPort products haven't gotten a major refresh since 2013. \nApple has been selling three routers--AirPort Extreme, which Apple says is appropriate for business use, as well as the less-powerful AirPort Express and the AirPort Time capsule, which includes data backup capabilities.

      "text": "By Tiernan Ray Oppenheimer & Co .’s Andrew Uerkwitz today reiterates a “Perform” rating on shares of Apple ( AAPL ), writing that the company “lacks the courage to lead the next generation of innovation (AI, cloud-based services, messaging),” and as a result, “Over the next decade we believe the stock will generally underperform the market.”\n“We believe Apple is about to embark on a decade-long malaise ,” concludes Uerkwitz.\nWe believe Apple is about to embark on a decade-long malaise. The risks to the company have never been greater. However, we believe its strong profitability, a cash hoard for protection, and one last “growth” hurrah from the tenth anniversary phone will keep investors interested in the company. Our Perform rating is unchanged for now.\n(Contrast this report with the bullish note today from Canaccord Genuity ’s Mike Walkley .)\nApple shares are up $1.66, or 1.5%, at $111.72.\nBy June 29th of next year, writes Uerkwitz, the iPhone will be ten years old, Apple will have sold 1.2 billion units, and sales will probably “peak” at 245 million, he thinks, which he refers to as the first “ crack ” in its empire. Prices may even peak, with the next model, he thinks, as “fewer hardware breakthroughs are available today that can trigger favorable mix shift.”\nNor is he impressed with Apple’s software and its services offerings. Even though they are “the most effective defense from competition,” he thinks there’s “plenty of competitors that can seriously harm Apple’s ecosystem with software and services.”\n“We believe the cracks are showing in the Apple wall of invulnerability,” he writes.\nDespite Apple’s great effort at plugging holes with thumbs (inducing favorable mix shift and higher ASP), we see iPhone unit growth dropping to low single-digits in the next four years (FY16- FY20) at a CAGR of 2%. We believe that fewer new user additions and a more diversified installed base will significantly impact the sustainability and consistency of iPhone shipment growth in the next five years. We present our estimated installed base growth trajectory from 2016 to 2020 as follows.\nThat model shows the installed base rising from 677 million as of the fiscal year that ended in September, to 943 million by the end of 2020.\nTo Uerkwitz, the 8% decline in shipments this past fiscal year, despite a rise in installed base, was “the dual impact of lower new user additions and an elongated replacement cycle ─the two headwinds often go together as the result of a weaker product cycle.”\nAs subsidies dry up , and as features become not as impressive at the high end of the smartphone market, growth is slowing overall for the most expensive devices, including the iPhone, and “the high-end smartphone segment is slowing down faster than other segments, due to the closing performance gap between lower end phones and higher end phones.”\nAnd India , he believes, can’t pick up the slack, as “emerging regions such as India and Southeast Asia still have the market potential given their low 4G penetration and large population, but iPhones’ premium pricing may prohibit much near-term revenue upside from those emerging areas.”\nAnd new categories seem to have dried up for Apple, he believes: “We believe in the near term it is very difficult to find anything bigger than the iPhone or iPad. Moreover, it is increasingly difficult to build on the proven success of current devices by filling the gaps with different sized displays and add-on functionalities.”\nIn Steve Jobs’ words, a computer is “a bicycle for our minds”; desktop PCs, laptops, tablets, smartphones are simply different forms of that bicycle. We are confident in saying that the need for such a bicycle is here to stay, but the question is: what form will it take after the smartphone? It could be an earpiece, it could a pair of glasses, it could be a watch, and it could be some electronics to be embedded in our bodies. We believe the third option is the most likely in the near term, for its market potential, feasibility, and strategic fit with Apple’s identity. A head-mounted computing device can introduce a new paradigm for human computing interface, something Apple is the most adept at. Bottom Line We believe there are only a few product categories for Apple to enter in order to resume growth when the iPhone slows down. Head-mounted displays, or AR/VR headsets, have the most potential, but near-term technical hurdles are also substantial for these devices to become a mass-market success.\nAs for software, he argues apps may fade, as more and more popular services can be used in a number of ways, such as by messaging. “One will no longer just be able to order an Uber via a smartphone app, but be able to do it through messaging or voice activated speaker or any device that is connected to the cloud – and all without “downloading” a native app.”\nAnd Apple is losing the battle for A.I., he believes, which is becoming “the new operating system, the new interface”:\nApple (Siri), Facebook (bots), Google (Google Assistant), Amazon (Alexa), and Microsoft (Cortana) have showed us a glimpse of the future. In this AI-dominated future, apps, apps- turned-platforms, and mobile operating systems may all disappear into the background, “hide” inside the microphone arrays, or show up as a contact on your messenger app. It could be everywhere─Siri is still working when users are silently swiping their phones, giving restaurant recommendations and triggering review apps when it notices users are planning a dinner date in chat. Facebook apps and the Google Assistant app could do the same, on both iOS and Android platforms, removing the operating system’s role as the glue of all apps, services, and people on one’s social network. Apple originally had a two- to three-year head start on AI with the acquisition of Siri. But Siri’s development since Apple took over in late 2011 is best characterized as sluggish. It took Apple almost five years to open up Siri to third-party developers (a critical move to make it more usable by more people). Amazon and Google released products recently that are highly competitive, if not superior to Siri, and with broader support to third-party services and devices. The same disappointment can be found in many other native apps: iOS-Music, Camera/Photos, and iMessage all had years of head start, but only received key improvements as a reaction to superior third-party apps and services. Apple never seems to maintain its dominating lead in hardware in its software and services. But software and services will play a heavier role in the future of mobile user experience […] With the trends above, Apple may lose its edge as a leading innovator for interface.",

      "text": "Joby Sessions | MacFormat Magazine | Getty Images An Apple AirPort Express. Apple has moved engineers off the development of wireless routers, sources told Bloomberg , just weeks after Google debuted a new wi-fi device. \nApple has slowly shut down the team behind its three AirPort routers over the past year, Bloomberg reported on Monday, whittling down the company's focus to products like Apple TV. Some features of the devices were only compatible with Apple products, which may have kept users from switching to Android or PCs, Bloomberg's Mark Gurman reported. \nRouters were a very small portion of Apple's sales, Bloomberg reported, as lower-priced competitors like Netgear focused more heavily on keeping up with changing wireless standards.\n\nIn October, Google unveiled Google Wifi , which promises faster wireless service and parental controls, and is slated to ship in December. \nFor the full story, see the article at Bloomberg.com",

      "text": "by Karl Bode Monday Nov 21 2016 16:10 EST Apple is getting out of the wireless router hardware business, according to a new report over at Bloomberg . Anonymous sources tell the news outlet that Apple has been shutting down its wireless router team over the past year, shifting company engineers to other product development groups including the team working on Apple TV. The closure of the unit is part of a larger overall shift by Apple to refocus on consumer products that generate the bulk of its revenue. The report notes that Apple hasn't refreshed its router lineup since 2013, and the product line had consistently fallen behind other products in the same price point.",

      "text": "11/21/16 AT 3:43 PM Close \nIt has been a while since the new iPhone 7 came out, but there might not be a better time to buy the phone than Friday. That's because it's the day after Thanksgiving, the shopping holiday otherwise known as \"Black Friday,\" which means your favorite Apple product just might be a bit less expensive. \nAnd while iPhone 7s are certainly still likely to be expensive, there are deals to be found at certain retailers. At Wal-Mart for instance, any customer who signs up for a contract with Verizon or AT&T is awarded with a $250 gift card to the store. It's helpful to remember, however, that those plans will prove to be pretty costly. \nAn offer from Target seems to be pretty similar to Wal-Mart's deal. Target is offering an iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus for $0 down for any customer with a qualified AT&T, Sprint or Verizon plan. The retailer is also throwing in a $250 Target Gift Card. Sam's Club is also running pretty much the same deal. Related Stories Sneakers In Demand On Black Friday \nA helpful list at tech website BGR detailed some of the other ways to land a cheap iPhone. The site noted that the \"real Black Friday deals on Apple hardware come from Apple’s retail partners, including electronics retailers and wireless carriers looking to capture your attention.\" Even online hub eBay has decent deals on unlocked iPhones. A savvy customer might be able to save $30-$50, according to BGR. \nFor those less interested in iPhone 7 there's plenty of deals on other products. You can find lower-end laptops for just a few hundred bucks or new Adidas sneakers for half the normal price . WalletHub looked into the best stores for Black Friday shopping and found certain retailers really slash prices, especially department stores that mostly focus on clothes. Macy's prices are expected to be 63.4 percent down on average, JC Penney 62.8 percent and Kohl's 58.1 percent.

      "title": "How To Sideload iOS 10 Recorder Vidyo [Without A Jailbreak]",
      "text": "Apple’s App Store rules are clear for everyone to see; however, now and again an app slips through the net. One such application was the recorder app Vidyo, which remained on the App Store for 24 hours before being pulled. It was pulled because it violated Apple’s Terms of Service by using private APIs. Fortunately, there is a way you can use it on iOS 10 without having to jailbreak your iPhone.\n\nVidyo on iOS 10, no jailbreak required As apps go, Vidyo offered a lot for $4.99, appealing to many because it did what it was supposed too. On a very basic level, it offered a spotless and efficient screen recording solution. However, Apple doesn’t like violations of its Terms and Conditions, so here’s how you can sideload it onto your iPhone running on iOS 10.\nBefore we start, you must have a Windows PC or a Mac for this tutorial. Also make sure you have the latest version of iTunes installed; if not, update it before moving forward.\n\nHow To sideload Vidyo Start by downloading the Vidyo app IPA file. Next, you need the latest version of Cydia Impactor for Mac or Windows . When you have it, extract the files and keep them in an easily accessible place on your computer. Now connect your iOS 10 device to your Mac or Windows computer. ONLY DO THIS IF YOU HAVE UPDATED iTUNES . Find Cydia Impactor, which you downloaded in step two, on your computer and Launch the exe file . Cydia should now recognize your device; select it in the dropdown. Find the Vidyo API file you downloaded in step one and drag it into the Cydia window. You will now be asked to enter an Apple ID for a developer account. You now have a choice. If you enter a valid ID for a paid developer account, the app’s certificate will last for 12 months. However, if you choose to enter a free account ID, the certificate will last only 7 days and you will have to repeat this process again. For a free Apple ID, go here and look for APP-SPECIFIC PASSWORDS , and then click Generate Password .\nOnce you have entered your Apple ID, Cydia will begin to sideload Vidyo onto your iOS 10 device. It is advised that you be patient while this process continues; do not touch your iPhone. Now that the app has been sideloaded, you should be able to see the Vidyo icon on your HomeScreen. DO NOT TAP IT . Instead, go to Settings –> General –> Profiles. There you will find the Vidyo app profile. Tap it and trust the certificate. While sideloading an app using Cydia Impactor is an easy process, the reason this app and many others have been removed from the App Store is security. Apple takes the safety of its devices and their users seriously. So you should think twice before sideloading applications onto your iOS 10 device.\nOn the other hand, you can now go and find out if the app is of any use to you… Enjoy!

      "text": "Review: Earin M-1 Wireless Earbuds Offer a Compelling Alternative to Apple AirPods By Todd Bernhard on Mon, 11/21/2016 \nApple has laid down itscards, and it's clear that the future of listening to your iPhone will be wireless. But Apple's AirPods have some serious drawbacks. First, you look like Lieutenant Uhura, with two microphones extending towards your mouth. They have a special wireless chip that makes them work well with Apple gear, but what if you want to use them with an Android device? And if they don't fit well, too bad. Instead, you might want to consider the Earin M-1 Wireless Earbuds ($199). \nThese have been around a while, after a successful crowdfunding campaign. While the list price was $249, the Apple announcement had an impact and the vendor lowered the price to $199, slightly more than Apple's AirPods. The Earin earbuds sound great, and the fact that they are so small, with no wires, makes it seem like you are imagining the music... it's all in your head, literally! \nThe Earin earbuds could be used in mono mode, one at a time, which would add to battery life, as you can charge one earbud while using the other. Otherwise, they offer two hours and fifty minutes of battery life, in stereo mode. Keep in mind that the Earins do not offer a microphone, but you can still use your iPhone's microphone and listen with the earbuds. \nThe clever charging cradle looks like a cigar case and is easy to travel with. Earin includes several adapters for a comfortable fit in your ear. The item, charger, and even the case it ships in is well designed and packaged. I also appreciate that it works with Apple, Android, and Windows Phone devices, so it has more universal appeal. There is even a free setup app for those platforms. Pros Clever charging cradle, easy to travel with Several adapters for a comfortable fit Well designed and packaged Works with Apple, Android, and Windows phones Cons More expensive than Apple and others Just under three hours of battery life No microphone Final Verdict \nIf you are looking for a wireless set of earbuds for your iPhone 7, or any device, the Earins offer some distinct advantages.

      "text": "iPhones allegedly sending call history to Apple without user knowledge KO By Kyle O'Brien - 21 November 2016 21:05pm iPhones allegedly sending call history to Apple without user knowledge \nApple has made it known publicly that they are a company that greatly desires privacy for its users. It steadfastly defended itself in the wake of the San Bernardino shooter case , where it would not unlock the shooter’s encrypted cell phone, which was hailed by fans of privacy in technology. \nBehind closed doors, however, Apple appears to not have a solid lock on user information. According to a story on The Intercept, experts at Russian digital forensics firm Elcomsoft have found that Apple mobile devices are automatically sending users’ call history to company servers if iCloud is enabled. User data is apparently being uploaded often without user knowledge or any notification, and it includes calls and FaceTime audio and video. \nThe story states that call logs uploaded to Apple include calls made and received on iOS devices, with phone numbers, dates, times and duration of calls. The data is retained by Apple for up to four months. This means that law enforcement may be able to get access to data, even if the user’s device is encrypted with an unbreakable passcode. \nThe logged calls appear to go back to iOS 8.2, but iOS 10 users are also having third party app activity logged, including Skype, WhatsApp and Viber . \nUS law enforcement agencies may be able to use a court order to get direct access to the logs, since Apple owns the keys to unlock iCloud accounts, though a tool would still be needed to extract and parse the information. \nSome iPhone users have figured out that this was happening, especially those who share an iCloud account on different phones, like families. There have been complaints that call histories appear on multiple devices, which makes privacy difficult. \nThose who have figured out the problem say there is no button or setting to stop the logs from sending. The only way to stop it is to stop sharing the same iCloud account or not to use one. \nMaking things even more unsettling is the fact that photos, contacts, notes, calendars and browsing history are also stored on a user’s iCloud account, which could make themselves open to hackers and putting privacy is doubt. \nElcomsoft is releasing an update to its Phone Breaker software tool to allow call histories to be extracted from iCloud accounts, with the accountholder’s credentials. The company’s forensic tools are used by law enforcement, corporate security and consumers to extract information. Hackers could essentially get access to the user’s information to steal photos and information. \nApple has said that the syncing of call logs is intentional. \n“We offer call history syncing as a convenience to our customers so that they can return calls from any of their devices,” said an Apple spokesperson in an email as part of The Intercept story. “Device data is encrypted with a user’s passcode, and access to iCloud data including backups requires the user’s Apple ID and password. Apple recommends all customers select strong passwords and use two-factor authentication.” \nChris Soghoian, chief technologist for the ACLU, did not seem surprised that Apple is collecting the information. \n“It’s arguably not even the worst thing about iCloud,” he told The Intercept. “The fact that iCloud backs up what would otherwise be end-to-end encrypted iMessages (which happened a few months back) is far worse in my mind. There are other ways the government can obtain [call logs]. But without the backup of iMessages, there may be no other way for them to get those messages.” \nWhile the practice by Apple may not be unlawful, experts say that the company should be very clear with users that their data is being collected and stored in the cloud, and that they should have an opt-out.",

      "text": "Stocks Close At Record Highs; Oil Jumps 4%, Apple Leads Dow (Investor's Business Daily) \nOn CNBC's Fast Money Halftime Report , Jon Najarian spoke about unusually high options activity in Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB ). \nLast week he noticed some put selling in the name and after the stock moved higher on Monday, he noticed that traders are buying call options. The November 120 calls were particularly interesting for him as their price more than doubled on Monday. Najarian decided to follow the trade and he is planning to hold the position for a couple of days, because these options expire on Friday. \nFacebook spiked 4.06 percent Monday on the news of a $6 billion buyback . © 2016 Benzinga.com.

      "text": "\nApple has revealed plans for a battery replacement program to address recent concerns with the dysfunctional batteries that plague a small percentage of iPhone 6s smartphones. While nowhere near the level of Samsung's recent issues with the Note 7, the faulty batteries found in 6S units produced from September to October 2015 can cause some phones to abruptly shut down. As the Wall Street Journal notes, reports of serious battery issues with some iPhone 6s smartphones have been circulating online for about a year now. In a statement, Apple acknowledges the iPhone 6s battery problem as such:\nApple has determined that a very small number of iPhone 6s devices may unexpectedly shut down. This is not a safety issue and only affects devices within a limited serial number range that were manufactured between September and October 2015\nAn official word concerning the root cause of the phone-closing batteries has not been released, but customers experiencing issues can head over to Apple's website to learn about the different approaches to take in order to receive a replacement battery.\nClick here to view full gallery at Hypebeast.com \n\n",

      "text": "Jessica Lee Star/Digital Trends\nApple has launched its second iPhone repair in less than a week, this time to deal with a battery issue on some iPhone 6S handsets that causes them to suddenly shut down without warning even when there’s plenty of juice remaining.\nIn a message on its website posted on Sunday , the tech titan said the problem affects only “a very small number” of iPhone 6S devices and is “not a safety issue.”\nAccording to Apple, the flaw affects devices that were manufactured between September and October 2015, which is when the phone launched. Anyone with an iPhone 6S that’s been experiencing the issue is told to visit an Apple Store or one of its authorized outlets to get their phone’s serial number checked to confirm eligibility for a free battery replacement.\nIf you’ve already replaced your iPhone 6S battery because of this specific issue, Apple asks that you get in touch to discuss the possibility of obtaining a refund.\nFinally, if you believe your 6S is suffering sudden shutdowns and you intend to take it in for repair, the Cupertino company insists that you first sort out any other issues with the phone, such as a cracked display.\nThe repair program, which doesn’t appear to be country-specific, comes just a few days after the China Consumers Association asked Apple to look into what appears to be the same issue, although the organization suggested it affects not only the iPhone 6S but the iPhone 6, too. To be clear, the repair program that Apple launched on Sunday covers defective iPhone 6S units only.\nMore: DT’s hands-on review of the iPhone 6S\nThis latest repair program follows another one launched by Apple last week in response to the so-called “Touch Disease” issue affecting some iPhone 6 Plus units. The problem causes a flickering gray bar to appear at the top of the display, and can culminate in the touchscreen becoming totally unresponsive.\nApple ran into some criticism for charging $149 for the repair, with the company claiming the problem occurs as a result of the phone being “dropped multiple times on a hard surface and then incurring further stress on the device” rather than any issue with its manufacturing process.\nApple’s ‘touch disease’ repair program for the iPhone 6 Plus is not free Apple slapped with class action lawsuit over iPhone ‘Touch Disease’ defect",

      "text": "iOS 10 won’t be coming to the iPhone 4s which means iOS 9.3.5 will be the last update for Apple’s aging former flagship. With that in mind, we want to take a look at the most important things to know about the iPhone 4s iOS 9.3.5 update.\nIn March, Apple rolled out its highly anticipated iOS 9.3 update. It went through an extensive beta but the update immediately caused problems for iPhone and iPad users. To address these bugs and other lingering issues, Apple pushed out several new versions of iOS 9.3.\nAdvertisement\niOS 9.3.1 arrived with some important bug fixes and patches . After that, Apple pushed out an iOS 9.3.2 update to the iPhone 4s and other iOS 9-powered devices. A few days after that, it released iOS 9.3.3 update. Soon after that, the company pushed out iOS 9.3.4 update.\nShortly after the release of iOS 9.3.4, Apple released an iPhone 4s iOS 9.3.5 update. It will be the last update the iPhone 4s receives from Apple.\nThe iPhone 4s will never get iOS 10.\nIf you’re coming from the iOS 9.3.4 update, iOS 9.3.5 features three three patches and nothing else. If you’re coming from something older than iOS 9.3.4, your iPhone 4s iOS 9.3.5 update is going to be a much larger update. Apple’s previous iOS updates are baked in.\nAdvertisement\nWith that in mind we want to take a look at the most important things iPhone 4s users need to know about the iOS 9.3.5 update’s performance, its problems, the iOS downgrade process, and more.\niPhone 4s iOS 9.3.5 Reviews 1 / 7 We've been able to spend some quality hands-on time with many of Apple's other iOS updates but we haven't spent enough time to provide quality feedback about the iPhone 4s iOS 9.3.5 update. So, we must turn to the opinions of others.\nAs we push further and further away from Apple's iOS 9.3.5 release date we've seen iPhone 4s users from all over the world relay feedback about the update's performance. If you haven't installed yet you should make it a point to dig into these mini reviews.\nAdvertisement\niPhone 4s iOS 9.3.5 update reviews are still mixed months after the update's release. While some users are seeing solid performance in key areas like battery life and connectivity, others are complaining about lag, freezes, and occasional stuttering.\nSome users have said that they are sticking with the iOS 8 update, others are saying that the iOS 9.3.4 and iOS 9.3.5 updates solved some of the lag issues they had with earlier versions of iOS 9.\nAs of right now there is no clear cut answer which means those of you with an iPhone 4s need to be extremely careful with this upgrade.\nDig into this feedback and decide if it's worth it to you and your device. For most of you, it will be thanks to the nature of the security patches on board.\n1 / 7",

      "title": "iPhone 6 iOS 10.1.1 Update: 9 Things to Know After Three Weeks",
      "text": "Its been three weeks since Apple replaced iOS 10.1 with iOS 10.1.1. With that in mind, we want to take a look at the most important things you need to know about the iPhone 6 iOS 10.1.1 update as we push toward the next big iOS 10 release.\nIn September, Apple confirmed an iOS 10 release date for the iPhone 6 and its other iOS 9 powered devices and on September 13th the company pushed the iOS 10 update to iPhone 6 models around the globe.\nAdvertisement\niOS 10 delivered new features and enhancements but it also brought problems to the iPhone 6 and Apple’s other mobile devices.\nIn an effort to clean up iOS 10, the company’s released several bug fix updates for the iPhone 6 and its other iOS 10-powered devices. The latest is iOS 10.1.1, a small update that brings a key fix to the former flagship smartphone.\nThe iPhone 6 iOS 10.1.1 update is a tiny update if you’re coming directly from iOS 10.1. If you’re coming to iOS 10.1.1 from iOS 9 or iOS 8, it’ll be much larger due to iOS 10.1 and iOS 10. The features from Apple’s previous iOS 10 updates are baked into iOS 10.1.1.\nAdvertisement\nWith the smoke from the iOS 10.1.1 release settled we want to take a look at the most important things iPhone 6 owners need to know about the iOS 10.1.1 update at the three week mark.\nThis roundup offers a quick iPhone 6 iOS 10.1.1 review, details about the iOS 10 downgrade, a look at some of the problems plaguing the iPhone 6 after iOS 10.1.1, and a whole lot more.\nCheck back for regular updates as we make our way into December.\niPhone 6 iOS 10.1.1 Update Review: Three Weeks Later 1 / 9 Again, Apple's iPhone 6 iOS 10.1.1 update is small if you're coming to it from iOS 10.1. It took us about seven minutes to download and install.\nAdvertisement\nIf you're coming from something older than iOS 10.1 you'll want to give yourself a little more time to get the installation done. Your update will, again, be much larger.\nWe've been using the iPhone 6 iOS 10.1.1 update for three weeks and we've been keeping a close eye on key areas like battery life, connectivity, and UI speed. Here's what we've found during our time with the current version of iOS 10.\nWe haven't noticed any major problems with iPhone 6 battery life with the iOS 10.1.1 update on board. The device continues to hold an excellent charge at the three week mark.\nIf you're seeing battery drain issues and you recently installed iOS 10.1.1, give it a couple of days to settle. If it fails to settle after a couple of days with iOS 10.1.1 installed, you'll want to try some manual fixes for battery life problems.\nWe've tested the phone and its update with several ISPs, routers, and Bluetooth devices and we've come away impressed. We haven't noticed any major problems or dropped connections. AT&T LTE/4G continues to perform at a high level as well.\nThe iPhone 6 is still extremely fast with iOS 10.1.1 on board. The operating system still feels much faster than iOS 9. Animations and transitions are incredibly fluid and we haven't experienced any lag in problem areas like Control Center and the Notifications tray.\nThe iOS 10.1.1 update is treating our iPhone 6 well at the three week milestone. We recommend it for most iOS 10 users.\nThat said, you'll want to seek out a second or third opinion before you make your move. This is especially important if you're coming from iOS 9.3.5 or below. You can't go back to iOS 9 once you make the move to iOS 10.\n1 / 9",

(Apple) \nLike the ruthless character of Negan on \"The Walking Dead,\" Apple has seized everything worthwhile from rivals in the smartphone industry. \nCanaccord Genuity analyst Michael Walkley on Monday estimated that Apple took 106% of smartphone industry profits in the third quarter. Its share is more than 100% because other vendors lost money in the business, resulting in Apple having more smartphone profit than the industry netted overall. \nApple's smartphone operating profit totaled $10.84 billion in Q3, vs. the industry total of $10.28 billion, Walkley said. Smartphone vendors that lost money in Q3 included Microsoft (MSFT), BlackBerry (BBRY), Lenovo, LG and HTC, he said. His report excludes a large portion of Chinese smartphone makers that do not provide profit information. \nEarlier this month, BMO Capital Markets estimated that Apple grabbed 104% of smartphone industry profits in Q3.

      "text": "Back in September, we reported that Apple was in talks to buy McLaren , as per a report in the Financial Times . A McLaren spokesperson flatly denied the rumor at the time, but it turns out that perhaps the truth of the matter is a little more complex than that denial encompassed. In an interview with Reuters , McLaren's acting CEO Mike Flewitt confirmed that there were talks with Apple, but that they never reached the stage where Apple made a bid.\n\n\"There wasn't a bid from Apple,\" Flewitt told Reuters . \"They visited. We talked. We talked about what they did. We talked about what we did. They toured. It never matured to a definitive proposition.\"\n\nEven if Apple had made a bid, it seems like the people who run McLaren might not have been in the mood to take it. As you might remember, long-time CEO Ron Dennis was ousted recently from his position after a 35-year run. A BBC report made it sound like the dismissal had to do with management style, but Sky News reports that it was Dennis's backing of a Chinese takeover bid that precipitated his departure. Apparently the stockholders weren't keen on selling, whether to a Chinese consortium or anybody else, and so Dennis got the boot. \n\nIt's not as if Dennis will be completely uninvolved from this point forward. The man still has a 25 percent stake in the company, and will remain on the board of directors of both the McLaren Technology Group as well as McLaren automotive itself.\n\nIn other news, Zak Brown, a former racing driver and sports marketing executive, has decided to take Dennis's vacated position, reports Sky News .",

      "title": "Apple Pay Should Pair With iBeacon 11/21/2016",
      "text": "Over the last few years, Apple has invested in the retail industry, primarily through the launch of Apple Pay and iBeacon.\nIn October 2014, Apple launched Apple Pay but has yet to see massive adoption. A year earlier, it was iBeacon, which is growing rapidly and our research shows that more than 8 million beacons are deployed globally. The forecast in 2021 is a massive 500 million beacons.\nWhat is Apple´s big play here? Are those two revolutionizing technologies really meant to live in solos or has Apple planned how they’ll work together to accelerate the growth and adoption of both? I believe the latter and here is why: \nApple Pay and iBeacon are the perfect tag team. iBeacon can be used as a trigger to get people into the store and enrich the shopping experience and Apple Pay as the final close of the visit through an easy and convenient check out technology. The missed opportunity is to tie the two technologies together and create a holistic customer experience. If Apple and retailers want a higher adoption of Apple Pay, they should include iBeacon technology. In store, I want my payment apps to send me beacon triggered notifications with relevant offers. I’m now in a true mobile experience and don't want to pull out my payment card. Apple Pay and iBeacon has to be a de facto tag team. Apple Pay has a data challenge iBeacon will solve. Apple is not in the business of collecting or monetizing data, but the real reason Apple doesn't do more with Apple Pay data is that it can´t. The limitation lies in the technology as Apple Pay and NFC- based systems lack access to the product level. It’s privacy friendly, but is an issue for the development of Apple Pay. Without data from transactions and store visits, Apple Pay loses its potential value to retailers and consumers. Retailers rely on customers and purchase data and customers expect retailers to know them and provide better experiences. This is where iBeacon can complement Apple Pay. iBeacon can be enabled to collect data about customer interactions with beacons. The data collection is always opt-in and tied to the advertising identifier (IDFA), a privacy friendly identifier Apple introduced when iBeacon launched. Through beacon deployments, retailers and brands can collect data to understand what people do in-store. iBeacon complements Apple Pay, allowing retailers to build and improve their business. In return, customers get a contextual experience enhancing the physical world they live in.  One more thing. Earlier this year a new Apple device passed through the FCC and the device comes with both Bluetooth and NFC. We've earlier speculated if this is a new ‘iBeacon 2.0,’ a new point of sales system or both. Apple’s secret are more safely guarded than Fort Knox. We’ll just have to wait for the next Developer Conference or Keynote. There should be no doubt that iBeacon and Apple Pay will play an important role in accelerating each other's growth.",

      "text": "Apple's Jony Ive on design Jony Ive's much-hyped Christmas tree is underwhelming. Apple's ( AAPL , Tech30 ) chief design officer -- the creative genius behind some of the company's most successful products, including the iPod and iPhone -- was tasked with designing a Christmas tree for the prestigious Claridge's hotel lobby in London. \nKnown for simplicity, Ive took a similar approach with the tree. In fact, it doesn't have any decorations. It's just... a tree. \nWhile the tree is traditionally the hotel's main attraction -- after all, last year's creation by Christopher Bailey for Burberry included over 100 umbrellas and thousands of lights -- this year's inspiration comes from the environment around it. \n\nLight boxes project large black and white photos of snowy birch trees in the lobby. Other smaller unlit trees accompany the immersive installation that's meant to make visitors feel like they're walking through a forest. It's all displayed on \"a pure white floor.\" \nBut overall, the presentation isn't nearly as visual or high-tech as last year's display. \nIve teamed up with industrial designer Marc Newson for the project. The pair previously worked together in 2013 to create a customized grand piano and Leica digital camera in support of the HIV/AIDS charity (RED). \n\n\"There are few things more pure and beautiful than nature, so that was our starting point, layering various iterations of organic forms with technology,\" the duo said in a joint statement . \n\"Our aim was to create an all-enveloping magical experience that celebrates our enormous respect for tradition while recognizing our excitement about the future and things to come.\" \nBecause nothing says excitement about the future like a dark, unlit Christmas tree. \nCNNMoney (San Francisco) First published November 21, 2016: 5:05 PM ET",

      "text": "Reddit \nAs Black Friday approaches, the 9to5Toys team has been working diligently to find the best deals leading up to the biggest deal day of the year. While the Toys team covers all of the big deals and new gear from the retailers you trust, we’re paying particular attention to Apple Deals here. \nFirst, you’ll want to be sure that you’re following 9to5Toys on Twitter , RSS and Facebook for all of the latest deals as they pop up. This is important because retailers have gotten tricky with their Black Friday deals and the best deals often only last minutes at a time. Second, you don’t want to leave your computer on Black Friday. The best deals are online. Waiting in lines and wrestling HDTVs from Black Friday Deal shoppers is for suckers. \nAs you likely know, Apple no longer does deals at its stores and outsources its Black Friday deals to its retail partners . At best, you can expect a gift card with your purchase. However, third-party retailers like Amazon , Best Buy , B&H , Ebay , Walmart, Target and others are offering aggressive discounts. Head below for a look at our top picks for the season so far… iPad",
