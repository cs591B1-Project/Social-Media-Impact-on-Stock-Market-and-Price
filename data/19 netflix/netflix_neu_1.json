The film, based on Ubisoft's video game series, is set to hit theaters on December 21.\nThe Reuters report also noted that Vivendi, a 20 percent shareholder in Ubisoft, has been silent after making acquisition waves before and during the Ubisoft shareholders meeting in September.\nNetflix and Ubisoft did not immediately return requests for comment.",

      "text": "Enlarge this image A screen shows a Netflix series, The Killing. Stephane de Sakutin/AFP/Getty Images   Stephane de Sakutin/AFP/Getty Images A screen shows a Netflix series, The Killing. \nStephane de Sakutin/AFP/Getty Images For decades, one company has pretty much had the monopoly on TV ratings: Nielsen. But, the way people watch TV is changing. A lot of fans are streaming shows from the Internet — not watching on cable TV.\nOld-fashioned Nielsen ratings wouldn't show the habits of a family like Kevin Seal's.\n\"We do not follow the appointment viewing, wait-for-the-show-to-come-on-at-a-given-time schedule,\" says Seal, who lives in San Francisco with his wife and six-year-old son. \"We watch a lot of Netflix programming — recently Black Mirror was the one that we devoured in its entirety.\"\nThe failure of Nielsen to reveal data about the habits of family's like the Seals has opened the way for a startup called Symphony , which is tracking TV watching in all its forms.\nIt is actually easier to track what people stream over the Internet. But Amazon and Netflix don't release those numbers. Those companies say the numbers aren't important because they don't sell ads — they sell subscriptions. As long as people can find shows they want to watch they will keep subscribing.\nArticle continues after sponsorship Television New Streaming Services Are Changing TV — And Viewers, Too But media researcher Bill Harvey says for the people who actually produce the programming the number of viewers remains very important. The producers of a show like Black Mirror are at a disadvantage in price negotiations with Amazon or Netflix. \"The price paid by a distributor to a program source is less, based on the assumption that the audience is smaller,\" Harvey says.\nAnd he says the companies that make the programming for TV also don't look as good in the eyes of Wall Street. Harvey says that, according to Nielsen's measurement system, overall TV viewership is down. But if you were really to measure how much TV is being watch on streaming, that may turn out to be false.\n\"Younger people are doing less and less of the old-fashioned TV viewing and much more of the newfangled TV viewing that Nielsen isn't measuring,\" Harvey says.\nMonkey See With 25 Ways To Watch TV, Does The House Always Win? Symphony has developed a tracking system that uses a smartphone app, which so far is on the phones of more than 15,000 people. It works a little like Shazam, the app that can detect which song is playing. Symphony runs in the background all the time and participants promise to have their phone on and with them when they view. Charles Buchwalter, CEO of Symphony, says each TV program has a code that the app can identify from the audio.\nI'm a fan of the sci-fi show Humans , which I watch on Amazon. If I had the app on my phone, Symphony would know I was a viewer, Buchwalter says. \"The app knows that this is the audio code that Laura's listening to,\" he says, \"and then we are matching that to a reference database of all programs out there and it says Laura is watching Humans .\"\nI usually watch Humans on my iPad, and Symphony knows that too. That's very important information to NBC Universal, which uses Symphony, says Alan Wurtzel, NBC's senior vice president of research.\n\"Folks have migrated to watching a great deal of video content on non-Nielsen-measured devices, like smartphones, like tablets,\" he says. \"And when you reaggregate all those numbers they basically come right back to where they've always been.\"\nWurtzel says people are watching as much TV as ever, though he doesn't have enough data to prove it.\nNPR's TV critic Eric Deggans says there's some evidence that Nielsen may be setting itself up to publicly track non-traditional TV viewing. He notes that earlier this year Nielsen revealed that it has been collecting some data on streaming-only shows from Netflix including Orange is the New Black .\nMedia Companies Struggle To Gauge TV Ratings In Age Of Netflix Media Companies Struggle To Gauge TV Ratings In Age Of Netflix Listen · 3:09 3:09 Toggle more options Download Embed Embed < iframe src=\"https://www.npr.org/player/embed/501053201/501053202\" width=\"100%\" height=\"290\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" title=\"NPR embedded audio player\">",

      "text": "By Ellen Gray, Philadelphia Daily News Published 6:06 pm, Monday, November 7, 2016 \nA complicated inheritance. A scandal-prone sister. A prominent family ruled as much by those who serve them as by traditions that put them out of step with the march of history. \nAnd footmen everywhere. \nFans of \"Downton Abbey\" are probably tired of hearing that Such-and-Such is \"the next Downton,\" but Netflix's \"The Crown\" deserves the title heir apparent more than most. \nTen episodes of you-can't-make-this-stuff-up drama from Peter Morgan , who scripted Helen Mirren 's Queen Elizabeth II for film in \"The Queen\" and for stage in \"The Audience,\" \"The Crown\" premiered Friday, starring Claire Foy (\"Wolf Hall\") as the young Elizabeth and Matt Smith (\"Doctor Who\") as her husband, Prince Philip . \nIt's a treatment so intimate that it begins with the future queen's father, King George VI ( Jared Harris , \"Mad Men\"), coughing up blood on the day before her wedding and sweeping enough to place the private lives of the royal family against the backdrop of a postwar Britain where Winston Churchill ( John Lithgow ) is in his final years as prime minister. \nIt's that scope that makes the $100 million Netflix reportedly paid for this first season seem almost reasonable. \nAmerican viewers may be more familiar with the travails of Princess Diana than those of the queen's late sister, Princess Margaret ( Vanessa Kirby ), whose love affair with the divorced Peter Townsend ( Ben Miles ) becomes a royal headache in the first season. The media firestorm it ignites is a hint of royal scandals that still lie far ahead.",

      "text": "Share Save \nNetflix was founded in 1997, and since then it has changed the way we think and watched TV shows and movies. After a huge success of Netflix, big media, and production houses launched their Subscription based Website and Apps providing online streaming of Videos, movies, and TV shows. One of them is Hulu which is a joint venture of Walt Disney Company, 21st Century Fox, Comcast and Time Warner. Hulu is giving tough competition to Netflix , and we thought about comparing these two videos on Demand Service provider to find out which one is best. 10 Point Comparison Between NetFlix and Hulu 1. Price \nBoth Hulu and Netflix provide subscription service for US$ 7.99 per month. Hulu has the option of Ad Free subscription of US$11.99 per month as well. Netflix doesn't show ads at all. 2. Free Trial Period \nNetflix provides one month free trial period while Hulu provides 7 Days of a Free trial period. Netflix, in this case, gives enough time to new users to like their service. 3. Services \nNetflix's services include Online Video Streaming including Movies and mostly completed seasons of ongoing shows, DVD Rentals, and On Demand Video. Hulu's service includes On Demand Video and TV Shows including current seasons. 4. Subscribers \nAs of May 2016, Hulu has more than 12 Million subscribers. On the other hand, Netflix has more than 80 Million subscribers, easily ahead of all its competitors. 5. Original contents \nHulu and Netflix both produce their own original contents. One of the most popular shows on Hulu includes ongoing Comedy show Casual. Whereas Multiple Emmy Winner House Of Card, NetFlix's original content is one of the most popular current show on Internet and TV. Orange is The New Black is another of the top show created for Netflix. 6. Commercials \nNetflix is ad free. After paying the subscription fee, you don't need to see any commercials in between shows and during Video Streaming . Meanwhile, Hulu shows commercials between shows and movies. To remove those ads, you have to subscribe its US$12 per month package. 7. Quality \nBoth Netflix and Hulu provide HD videos. The quality of Hulu Videos ranges from 288p to 720p HD. The quality of NetFlix Ranges from DVD Quality to 1080p HD. 8. Movies and TV Shows \nHulu is more focused towards TV Shows than films. It Shows many Past and Current series from respective networks and content partners. On Hulu you can watch latest episodes of ongoing TV Series within 24 hours after it airs on TV. Netflix has more than 100,000 Movies in their library, and they show TV shows only when a season ends. We can say that Hulu is a better option for TV shows but when it comes to movies, Netflix rules. 9. Availability \nNetflix has expanded globally and now available in various Asian countries as well, including India. Hulu, on the other hand, is more focused in USA and Japan 10. Revenue \nHulu's revenue recently touched US$1 Billion. On the other hand, Netflix which is still growing at a fast pace is about to touch revenue of US$8 Billion. \nBottom Line \nNetflix is king and way ahead than its competitors. Even though Hulu is backed up by biggest production houses, Netflix's ease of use, availability and large movie library makes it superior to others. 0 Shares ",

      "text": "Tweet \nIt’s been quite some time since we first covered whether or not any of the six seasons of Suits are on Netflix and with many more regions getting the show, we thought we’d update our guide as to whether Suits is streaming on Netflix. \nThe comedy drama set in one of New Yorks best lawyer firms sees our dropout join the organization after accidentally going to an interview he wasn’t invited to. He has an insane ability to grasp the law, and we get to see the best and worse sides of being a lawyer. \nThe series is among the most popular on the USANetwork lineup second to the insanely popular Mr. Robot series which will be going into its third season next year. Season 7 of Suits has been confirmed for 2017 so let’s have a look as to whether you can catch up on Netflix. \nLet’s start with the US. As you may have figured out by now Suits isn’t available on Netflix to stream. In fact, the same can be said for most USA Network content. We also recently saw one of the few USANetwork titles on Netflix, Psych was removed entirely from the service. Long-time Netflixers will know that it did once carry Suits, but an exclusive deal was struck between Amazon Prime and USA Network and that’s where the series has stayed ever since. You can also watch some episodes if you connect a cable subscription to Hulu also. \nThe United Kingdom Netflix does have Suits, but they’re quite often behind. As of the time of writing, five seasons of Suits are available on Netflix UK with new seasons arriving each April. That means if you’re in the UK, you can expect season 6 of Suits on Netflix in April 2017. \nOther regions carrying Suits include Canada, most of Africa, Europe, and South America. \nIs Suits on Netflix in your region?

      "text": "‘Young Justice’ Season 3 Air Date, Cast, Update: New Season Confirmed With Fan Favorite Superheroes; Will The Show Still Air On Netflix? By Keira Waldorf  31 pm “Young Justice” Season 3 has been confirmed to start production which was announced by Warner Bros. Animation.(Photo : NeedleMouse Productions/ YouTube) \"Young Justice\" Season 3 has been confirmed for production recently. The news was announced through an official tweet from DC. Additionally, Greg Weisman, the producer of the show, also tweeted that \"Young Justice\" Season 3 has been confirmed. Advertisement \n— DC Animated (@DC_Animated) November 7, 2016 \"Young Justice\" Season 3, a highly anticipated animated series, is set to be back with \"new twists, turns and dangerous new threats for the team\" according to Warner Bros. Animation. The statement continued to state that the show will give \"the opportunity for fans to finally continue the adventures of some of their favorite superheroes,\" ComicBook reported. This apparently excites more fans as they have long been clamoring for the comeback of \"Young Justice\" since its second season wrapped up. \"Young Justice\" Season 3 characters, however, was not confirmed by Warner Bros. Animation yet. No information about its release date has also been announced. in addition, it is not clear yet if \"Young Justice\" Season 3 will be back on Netflix or will it be partnered with a different TV network this time. Moreover, the show producer himself tweeted that \"Young Justice\" Season 3 is now a go on his official Twitter account. Weisman has been active in supporting fans in the past through answering tweets regarding the development of the show. He was also the one who advised viewers and fans of \"Young Justice\" to rewatch the first two seasons of the show on Netflix to help convince Warner Bros. and the network for a third season. it can be recalled that just weeks ago, reports emerged online that Netflix will renew \"Young Justice\" for a third season if its viewership number on the network will reach 300,000. this is because the said network is apparently not satisfied with the previous viewership numbers that the show has been getting, Parent Herald reported. It seems that everything worked out well as \"Young Justice\" Season 3 has now been officially confirmed. \"Young Justice\" Season 3 is now its way to production and it may take more time for fans to get details on the plot of the show. In the meantime, check out a \"Young Justice\" Season 2 clip below. You can also let us know who you want to see on \"Young Justice\" Season 3 by dropping your thoughts in our comment section.  ",

      "title": "Netflix Kills the YouTube Star in Haters Back Off!, a Comedy About the Joys of Hatin'",
      "text": "Netflix Kills the YouTube Star in Haters Back Off! , a Comedy About the Joys of Hatin' Monday, November 7, 2016 at 11 p.m. - - Haters Back Off! , a new eight-episode comedy streaming on Netflix, is about putting yourself out there, ignoring the haters, following your dreams no matter who or what stands in your way and utterly humiliating yourself on YouTube. Also at church socials, gay bars, funerals, rest homes — really anywhere Miranda Sings opens her mouth — with the viewer rooting for more and greater humiliations because this fame-obsessed teen is so narcissistic, cruel, controlling, delusional, sullen, phlegmatic and homeschooled that you can barely stand to be on the same Internet as her. \nIn that regard it's a mean-spirited show, bringing out our worst impulses — that desire to see a delusional teen with no talent destroyed — but that's OK. It's a dark comedy. You're supposed to feel this way. And it feels very good watching so unsympathetic a character (the sort who berates her mom for failing to give her an A-plus on her homeschool quiz) get her comeuppances — until, of course, it suddenly doesn't, which happens with great force in the season ender, when we're forced to reckon with just what we have wished for. But that happens later; there's a whole season of hatin' to get through first! \nThe Netflix show is the origin story of lipstick-smeared Miranda Sings, a real-life YouTube character created by comedian and (actually very good!) singer Colleen Ballinger. She's been posting videos of Miranda wretchedly singing pop songs in her bedroom since 2008, satirizing the many fame-hungry yet vocally challenged singers belting out covers on YouTube. She's done her job well — Miranda sounds like Ariana Grande after stepping on a flash grenade — and her YouTube channel has more than one billion views, putting her in the top echelon of YouTube stars, with comedy tours and a best-selling book, Selp-Helf . \nIn the Netflix show, Ballinger fleshes out the home life of Miranda, making her the despot of a dysfunctional ranch-house kingdom in Tacoma, Washington. It looks like a dinner-table primetime family comedy, but strewn with microwaved Lunchables, existing on the same weird block as Napoleon Dynamite or Malcolm in the Middle 's more cough-syrupy episodes. (One delightfully strange recurring joke is Miranda devouring ice cream in front of her house; you can almost imagine Napoleon peeking at her through the curtains next door.) Her fantastically enabling mom, Bethany ( The Office 's Angela Kinsey), is quietly horrified by Miranda's attempts to become famous, but she has her own issues, like grappling with \"undiagnosed fibromyalgia,\" which doesn't exist, and wooing a suitor who has an illness fetish. Also on her list is homeschooling Miranda by giving her As with an ever-expanding series of pluses to keep her quiet. \nIn this ramshackle house — it’s so cluttered with the detritus of Middle American life that it could be an art installation about the decline of the suburbs — Miranda and Uncle Jim, played at full tilt by Steve Little ( Eastbound & Down ), plot their absurd schemes to make Miranda famous. Uncle Jim is Miranda's manager-slash-biggest fan, who propels the show along with his childlike \"five-phase plan for fame\" (working as a magician is No. 5) when he's not having \"innocent\" conversations with Miranda full of creepy subtext. (\"Oh, some cream shot out of my package!\" he says when opening his Lunchables and some frosting squirts on Miranda. \"Oh, that's all right, it landed on my buns!\" she replies. \"I like them extra sticky.\") The designated normal, Miranda's sister Emily (Francesca Reale), spends her time painting, reading philosophy and plotting her escape. EXPAND Courtesy of Netflix \nAfter Miranda posts a video (titled \"My Fist Video,\" delightfully) in the first episode of her singing “Defying Gravity,” the views pile up, the haters crawl into the comments and Haters Back Off! seems hellbent on sending Miranda into viral infamy, à la Rebecca Black. Instead, it feints. How you wish it didn't. How you wish this self-involved character got shamed nationwide from the get-go, but that would be unwrapping the show's promised gift too soon, and well before it stirs some sympathy. Instead, Miranda spends the rest of the season engaged in more terrestrial quests for fame, each more disastrous than the last. \nShe sings at a rest home (if you're nice to the elderly you'll get their stuff), she sings for a movie producer (he dies during the song), then she sings at his funeral (she was supposed to deliver a eulogy). Most of these plot lines are enjoyable but forgettable, save for the hilarious and highly inappropriate staging of Annie in her backyard, which Uncle Jim rewrites as a love story between Annie and Daddy Warbucks, giving Jim and Miranda's creepy-uncle subtext all the room it needs to really gross you out. Also nice is her unhinged \"All That Jazz\" performance in a karaoke gay bar (she thinks it's Seattle's finest theater). \nHaters Back Off! is peppered with funny dialogue (when she's asked by a choir member if she's alto or soprano, Miranda says, “I’m an American”), but it's ultimately all about Ballinger showing off her Miranda. She's had years to hone her star's mannerisms and tics, and they’re a joy to watch, from the frown of her resting face to her awkward dancing to the way she stomps out of rooms, which the camera never fails to catch. \nThe cartoon quality of the show keeps the darker questions at bay, but there are legions: Why is Miranda so cruel? Why can't she see herself as she is? Has she ever been diagnosed? Is her mother to blame? In a scene where Bethany and Jim have to share a bed for the night, the show makes a mockery of real familial affection. The two bond over bread. Jim compliments Bethany's choice of bread — \"even if it's from the day-old shelf\" — and they share a fond memory of discovering that bread works just fine as a hot dog bun, for those times when you don't have a hot dog bun. Before they drift off to sleep, Jim loudly hocks up something disgusting, breaking the sweet mood caused by ... bread. \nIn some ways, the series end can't come fast enough. What starts as an exploration of going viral online turns into a bumbling trip down the entertainment back alleys of church choirs, CD-release parties and magic shows. The promise of the first episode — that Miranda would go truly viral, breaking her world apart — is teased at the very end, but not before she suffers through her greatest humiliation yet. But after hearing her devastating words shouted at a mocking audience — \"Why are you laughing? Why is it funny that someone would love me?\" — suddenly we're not in the mood to see her get hurt anymore.",

The series has not been renewed yet, but we have a pretty good idea that the series is coming back for another season. \nLet me guess: You watched the first season of The Crown on Netflix and now you want to find out when The Crown Season 2 will be released on Netflix? \nWell, you came to the right place! \nAt this point, we have no doubt The Crown will be renewed for a second season on Netflix. We haven’t heard the official word from Netflix about a second season yet, but according to a report from The Daily Mail , production has already started on the second season. That means The Crown is definitely coming back for a second season! But, when? \nIf everything goes according to plan, The Crown Season 2 should be released on Netflix some time in the late fall or early winter of 2017. Likely, Netflix will see how the show fared in early November and possibly move it back around Thanksgiving or the holidays to drum up more support or buzz for the series. Netflix typically releases a huge show at the very end of November or around Thanksgiving. Perhaps, next year will be the year for The Crown. Related Story: What's Coming Soon to Netflix \nObviously, Netflix has a bigger plan in mind with this series, and they likely already have a tentative release date for the series.

      "text": "JG Business Bloomberg Time Warner Inc., housed at the Time Warner Center in New York, is currently seeking government approval for a merger with AT&T.  01 AM Netflix may have say in AT&T deal To get support, rivals often seek concessions Gerry Smith and Lucas Shaw | Bloomberg \nAs AT&T Inc. and Time Warner Inc. seek government approval for their $85 billion megadeal, some of their most important negotiations may take place in private conversations with rival executives instead of in the nation’s capitol. \nThe merger offers competitors and partners a rare opportunity to cut more favorable deals with both companies in exchange for their public endorsement, which can be valuable in getting regulators to sign off. Meanwhile, other pay-TV providers and programmers will lobby to block the deal or place limits on an empire that would own many of the movies and shows it delivers to wireless, internet and video subscribers. \n“The part you never see is what the various players demand behind the scenes in order to support the deal in Washington,” said Craig Moffett, an analyst at MoffettNathanson. “You’ll have all kinds of programmers essentially demanding a pound of flesh. It’s a gravy train for everybody.” \nA hint of that back-channel dealing popped up two years ago. Discovery Communications Inc. argued against Comcast Corp.’s purchase of Time Warner Cable. In response, Comcast claimed that Discovery had demanded “unwarranted business concessions,” like higher carriage fees and greater distribution of its channels, in exchange for not opposing the merger. \nThe biggest question is whether Netflix backs the deal, Moffett said. The streaming-video giant opposed Comcast’s bid to buy Time Warner Cable, and the deal was blocked. Time Warner Cable was later purchased by Charter Communications Inc., with Netflix’s blessing. \nRegulators have made protecting the online video market one of their top priorities. They’ve used their oversight over big mergers to win commitments from large internet providers to treat content equally on their networks – including competing video services. \n“Netflix, for better or worse, will end up speaking on behalf of an entire class of would-be competitors,” Moffett said. \nSo far, Netflix has been conditionally in favor of AT&T’s bid for Time Warner.",

      "title": "Black Mirror Therapy Session: PCMag Talks Season 3, Episode 3 | News & Opinion",
      "text": "Black Mirror has found its spiritual home. The move from England's channel 4 to Netflix seems as inevitable as the choose-your-own-dystopias the show lays out for us. Netflix, after all, is a service that has made bingeing acceptable, so where better to house Black Mirror , an addictive show that tackles the fears we have about society. \nThe newest season of Black Mirror is so bleak that we formed a PCMag support group on Slack , where each week we'll chat about an episode from Black Mirror 's third season; here's our chat about episode one and episode two . This week, Rob Marvin, Victoria Song, Matthew Buzzi, Jordan Minor, Pete Haas, and Sascha Segan discuss the Charlie Brooker-written episode \"Shut Up and Dance.\" \n\n\nSascha Segan [2:15 PM]\nI did not watch this episode. I do not need additional medical bills for mental health treatment.\nI do not need a TV program telling me people are awful a day before Trump voters are prepared to overturn election results using guns.\nRob Marvin [2:16 PM]\nThat was a good call, as this was a 100 percent bleak and feel-bad episode. Zero redeeming qualities\nJordan Minor [2:16 PM]\nalso, like, not even sci-fi\nMarvin [2:17 PM]\nNot even a little.\nMatthew Buzzi [2:17 PM]\nBarely even tech\nMarvin [2:17 PM]\nFor the loyal readers of our chats , this week our support group is tackling episode 3, \"Shut Up and Dance\"\nwhich was basically an episode of Luther without Idris Elba\nMinor [2:17 PM]\nI remember reading stories about British teenagers killing themselves because they got caught in Skype scams like this\nMarvin [2:18 PM]\nEverything about this episode was pretty much plausible.\nExcept maybe the bank robbery\nBuzzi [2:18 PM]\nMust have been the inspiration. But it was just a short thriller film.\nSegan [2:19 PM]\nBTW psst https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compliance_(film) \nBuzzi [2:19 PM]\nIt was like, okay on its own with a pretty crazy twist? It wasn't 'bad'. But as a Black Mirror episode, I was mostly just wondering why it was a Black Mirror episode. (edited)\nPete Haas [2:19 PM]\nIt didn't feel like Black Mirror at all\nVictoria Song [2:19 PM]\n^ agreed\nIt felt like one of those indie horror films\nHaas [2:20 PM]\nI was expecting a very different twist, though\nmy guess throughout was that Bronn was actually an accomplice to the whole blackmail\nMarvin [2:20 PM]\nI watched with buzzi and the whole time we kept asking \"all the kid did was jerk off to some porn...don't rob a bank!\" So I suppose in that way the twist made sense.\nSong [2:21 PM]\nI thought it was telegraphed way too early\nChekhov's gun and all.\nBuzzi [2:21 PM]\nYeah I was thinking, I get it, as a kid that seems all-important and everything, but at a certain point you just HAVE to draw a line\nSong [2:21 PM]\nSo I wasn't surprised by his uh, proclivities\nBuzzi [2:21 PM]\nI was wondering if Bronn (yes we're going with that) was in deep on it too @pete_haas\nespecially when he wasn't there right away after robbing the bank\nwell, aren't you just so smart @v.song\nHaas [2:22 PM]\nright, and the fact that he actually has to talk the kid into robbing the bank\nSong [2:22 PM]\nI am SUPER SMART\nBuzzi [2:22 PM]\nwhen did you start thinking that?\nSong [2:22 PM]\nI had my doubts at first, but about the time when he met the courier on top of that parking lot\nSegan [2:23 PM]\nPretty sure she's been thinking that most of her life, that's kind of how you end up working here\nMarvin [2:23 PM]\nThank goodness for the Bronntent in this episode. Otherwise, there would've been literally nothing positive to take away from it\nSong [2:23 PM]\nAnd the guy says \"Just do what they say and it'll all go away.\"\nI mean, this is Black Mirror \nBuzzi [2:23 PM]\nHaha not that, Sascha, but well played\nHaas [2:23 PM]\nas my brother-in-law pointed out, it's funny that Bronn is into whoring no matter what universe he's in\nMarvin [2:23 PM]\n\nBuzzi [2:23 PM]\nYea, he was basically just playing Bronn\nSong [2:24 PM]\nWell nah .\nI think Bronn would've been like\nOk. So I whore.\nAnd?\nBuzzi [2:24 PM]\nI could see the suspicion early, but I was willing to believe that alone would motivate a kid enough\nSong [2:24 PM]\nWell the humiliation I get, but after a bit?\nHaas [2:25 PM]\nyeah, I was thinking more along the lines of Compliance where the power they had over him was illusory\nSong [2:25 PM]\nWould you really be willing to murder and kill someone or rob a bank\nBuzzi [2:25 PM]\nWell when he was finally faltering Bronn rubbed in just how bad it would be and stay with him forever to push him over the edge\nHaas [2:25 PM]\nor again, that Bronn was the accomplice. because having someone there to coax the target along is more powerful than just sending text messages\nSong [2:26 PM]\nRight. Bronn's egging was realistic, but at the same time, there was just something about that kid's acting (which was great btw)\nin that scene with the little girl.\nMarvin [2:26 PM]\nwhoever it was behind the trollface , they knew how to play human nature against itself. I'll give 'em that. And Bronn's egging was ok\nHaas [2:26 PM]\nI'd love to know how the script for this episode changed from draft to draft. was that always the ending they planned?\nSong [2:27 PM]\nI have a feeling yes, because the idea that if they just do what they're told, it'll all go away\nis repeated over and over again throughout the episode.\nand because Black Mirror never lets you off the easy way, you have to think they're setting you up for that ending.\nBuzzi [2:27 PM]\nWhat did the twsit even tell us, we supposed to be happy that it's bad people?\nAlso how did he kill that dude\nMinor [2:28 PM]\nThat cruelly punishing bad people is still cruel?\nSong [2:28 PM]\nYanno, this episode felt like a less gory version of Saw.\nWhere there's some sort of mastermind making \"bad\" people jump through hoops\nBuzzi [2:28 PM]\nDid it even make us think it was cruel? it framed it like, gotcha! see! they deserved it!\nHaas [2:28 PM]\nyeah, what jordan said. unfortunately, this is at least the second time that Black Mirror has toyed with that concept and this time they did a worse job of it\nMarvin [2:29 PM]\nThere wasn't a whole lot to take away. This was ultimately maybe the most forgettable episode of the show I've seen to date\nSong [2:29 PM]\nI mean...I had some complicated feelings. Yes the kid had an extremely taboo proclivity, but as far as the audience knows, he never acted on it in the sense he abducted a little kid. These are people with a serious mental illness...and...what is the show trying to say about that?\nMinor [2:29 PM]\nI think the idea of putting not-an-adult in a situation where they are peeing themselves robbing a bank is supposed to be seen as cruel\nregardless of larger context\nSong [2:30 PM]\nBtw, I'm not like...condoning what the character did do.\nBuzzi [2:30 PM]\nIt is, but the ending doesn't really drive that idea home. If you knew they were bad from the start, and then made you feel sympathy even for bad people, that would do what you're saying (edited)\nSong [2:30 PM]\nBut i felt the whole \"twist\" and the \"punch\" was a bit....it fell short somewhere in what it wanted to say about \"bad people.\"\nOr maybe that was the only way they felt they could leave it off--by being vague.\nMarvin [2:31 PM]\n\"People are bad. The people who did it to them are worse. Cover your webcam.\" *fin*\nHaas [2:32 PM]\n\"everyone is terrible and so is this episode\"\nSong [2:32 PM]\nNew Etsy stores selling webcam covers.\nMinor [2:32 PM]\nGreat title tho\nMarvin [2:32 PM]\n^\nSong [2:32 PM]\nAlso good acting.\nHaas [2:33 PM]\nyeah, the main duo in this episode is really strong\nMarvin [2:33 PM]\nThe main kid's acting was superb. And Bronn provided great Bronntent .\nBuzzi [2:33 PM]\nAny particular moments stand out? Was just sort of watching horrified the entire time, really\nHaas [2:33 PM]\nI would probably have liked this episode more if it was a film rather than a Black Mirror episode. because the fact that it feels shoehorned into the show bugged me\nSong [2:33 PM]\nTbh, their chemistry is probably the only thing that makes this episode work at any level. In my binged all-knowingness, however, I gotta say I think this the weakest episode of the season.\nMinor [2:33 PM]\nThat bit where they drive with the guy's sister or something?\nSong [2:34 PM]\nThat was good!\nBuzzi [2:34 PM]\nOh that was pretty good. The tension of trying to act normal as she chatted\nSong [2:34 PM]\nThe \"soccer mom\" who didn't know when she'd overstayed her welcome\nMarvin [2:34 PM]\nThat was as lighthearted as it got\nHaas [2:34 PM]\nor when the boy is explaining that they filmed him masturbating and bronn's like \"...well everyone does that.\"\nwhich was funny before you know the truth. it was a very bronn reaction\nMarvin [2:35 PM]\nI also liked the shot of the kid walking up the hill in the dark to the final battle in the forest, for some reason. Just a well-framed shot.\nSong [2:35 PM]\n@pete_haas another clue!\nMinor [2:35 PM]\nWhat if it was Chris Hansen on the phone?\nSong [2:36 PM]\nThe collective exhaustion after having watched this episode is apparent.\nHaas [2:36 PM]\nand they ruined a perfectly good cake\nBuzzi [2:36 PM]\nIt just didnt fit at all\nMarvin [2:36 PM]\nThis was the Barb of Black Mirror episodes. Let's just leave it in the upside down and stop looking for it\nBuzzi [2:37 PM]\nYes\nSong [2:37 PM]\nOMG. LEAVE BARB ALONE.\nBuzzi [2:37 PM]\nExactly\nMarvin [2:37 PM]\n\nHaas [2:37 PM]\nI agree. leave barb alone in the upside down\nBuzzi [2:37 PM]\nAlone in the upside down\nPete gets it\nSong [2:37 PM]\nANYWAY\nMinor [2:37 PM]\nI do think the fact that this is literally a thing happening right now is interesting, if sad\nMarvin [2:38 PM]\nThe webcam thing, for suuuure . So many horror stories about that nowadays\nMinor [2:38 PM]\nbut like specifically the webcam sex blackmail stuff\nHaas [2:38 PM]\nBlack Mirror is usually good about taking some piece of current-day tech and then stretching it to horrible proportions. I was hoping they'd do the same with ransomware/blackmail here\nMarvin [2:39 PM]\nI suppose it was horrible enough as it is. They didn't need to embellish much\nHaas [2:39 PM]\nit feels like they threw in the drone at the end because they got a producer's note that there's not enough tech in the episode\nBuzzi [2:39 PM]\nS1E1 did the blackmailing better, I guess\nSong [2:39 PM]\n\nMarvin [2:40 PM]\n^which we just watched! Slowly catching Buzzi up on the old eps\nSong [2:40 PM]\nI think S1E1 made the ethical \"What would you do?\" Point a lot better\nit was arguably more unrealistic (until David Cameron proved us all wrong), but it was a better thought exercise for sure\nHaas [2:40 PM]\nI guess we're also getting to the point in Black Mirror 's lifespan where it's going to repeat itself a bit. this episode just pales in comparison to older episodes with similar notes\nBuzzi [2:41 PM]\nLuckily, next time we can talk about episode 4!\nSong [2:41 PM]\nFINALLY\nMarvin [2:41 PM]\nYep, I think that's about all I have to say about that.\nHaas [2:41 PM]\nEpisode 4: \"What If Something Good Happened?\"\nBuzzi [2:41 PM]\nwow~\nMinor [2:41 PM]\nEp 4 (futuristic, hopeful, good) is the complete opposite of this\nSong [2:41 PM]\nEpisode 4: Like Star Wars , you're done with the prequels. Here's the stronger three episodes.\nThough to be fair, I did enjoy Nosedive quite a bit.\nBuzzi [2:42 PM]\nI liked the first yeah\nThis was so strange though\nAt any rate, let's close this depressing book\nMarvin [2:43 PM]\nWhat did you think about Shut Up and Dance, Bronn?",

      "text": "What's hot on Netflix? A startup aims to track ratings in the streaming age Laura Sydell | NPR \nA screen shows a Netflix series, <em>The Killing.</em> Stephane de Sakutin/AFP/Getty Images \nFor decades, one company has pretty much had the monopoly on TV ratings: Nielsen. But, the way people watch TV is changing. A lot of fans are streaming shows from the Internet — not watching on cable TV. \nOld-fashioned Nielsen ratings wouldn't show the habits of a family like Kevin Seal's. \n\"We do not follow the appointment viewing, wait-for-the-show-to-come-on-at-a-given-time schedule,\" says Seal, who lives in San Francisco with his wife and six-year-old son. \"We watch a lot of Netflix programming — recently 'Black Mirror' was the one that we devoured in its entirety.\" \nThe failure of Nielsen to reveal data about the habits of family's like the Seals has opened the way for a startup called Symphony , which is tracking TV watching in all its forms. \nIt is actually easier to track what people stream over the Internet. But Amazon and Netflix don't release those numbers. Those companies say the numbers aren't important because they don't sell ads — they sell subscriptions. As long as people can find shows they want to watch they will keep subscribing. \nBut media researcher Bill Harvey says for the people who actually produce the programming the number of viewers remains very important. The producers of a show like Black Mirror are at a disadvantage in price negotiations with Amazon or Netflix. \"The price paid by a distributor to a program source is less, based on the assumption that the audience is smaller,\" Harvey says. \nAnd he says the companies that make the programming for TV also don't look as good in the eyes of Wall Street. Harvey says that, according to Nielsen's measurement system, overall TV viewership is down. But if you were really to measure how much TV is being watch on streaming, that may turn out to be false. \n\"Younger people are doing less and less of the old-fashioned TV viewing and much more of the newfangled TV viewing that Nielsen isn't measuring,\" Harvey says. \nSymphony has developed a tracking system that uses a smartphone app, which so far is on the phones of more than 15,000 people. It works a little like Shazam, the app that can detect which song is playing. Symphony runs in the background all the time and participants promise to have their phone on and with them when they view. Charles Buchwalter, CEO of Symphony, says each TV program has a code that the app can identify from the audio. \nI'm a fan of the sci-fi show \"Humans,\" which I watch on Amazon. If I had the app on my phone, Symphony would know I was a viewer, Buchwalter says. \"The app knows that this is the audio code that Laura's listening to,\" he says, \"and then we are matching that to a reference database of all programs out there and it says Laura is watching 'Humans.'\" \nI usually watch \"Humans\" on my iPad, and Symphony knows that too. That's very important information to NBC Universal, which uses Symphony, says Alan Wurtzel, NBC's senior vice president of research. \n\"Folks have migrated to watching a great deal of video content on non-Nielsen-measured devices, like smartphones, like tablets,\" he says. \"And when you reaggregate all those numbers they basically come right back to where they've always been.\" \nWurtzel says people are watching as much TV as ever, though he doesn't have enough data to prove it. \nNPR's TV critic Eric Deggans says there's some evidence that Nielsen may be setting itself up to publicly track non-traditional TV viewing. He notes that earlier this year Nielsen revealed that it has been collecting some data on streaming-only shows from Netflix including \"Orange is the New Black.\" \n\"But they're only sharing that information with select clients,\" he says. \"So it's hard for journalists and critics and the public to know exactly who's watching what.\" \nAnd while this information is important to the producers of TV, Deggans says viewers like to know about it too. \"If a bunch of other people are watching a show you might want to check it out,\" he says. \nUltimately, Deggans says, TV producers have a stake in seeing a company like Symphony succeed. Nielsen has been a monopoly in the world of TV ratings. \"If Nielsen is the only place that gives you the ratings ... then they can charge you as much as they can charge you,\" Deggans adds. \nBut Symphony might give producers a little negotiating power. And if Symphony's technology turns out to be accurate, it may also put pressure on Nielsen to do a better job tracking how Americans are engaging in their decades-old pastime of watching TV.

      "text": "November 8, 2016 Diane Guerrero On the hit Netflix show, “Orange is the New Black,” Diane Guerrero plays Maritza Ramos, a tough inmate who is quick with an insult. In reality, though, Guerrero is an outspoken citizen who cares deeply about immigration reform. It’s this combination of fame and civic engagement that made the 30-year-old actress a perfect choice to headline “An Evening With” Nov. 14 at the UIC Forum. “There’s the educational factor to it, but, then, she’s also a celebrity,” said event lead Rajas Gupta. “It’s not often that you get to be in the same room as a celebrity.” The annual event is sponsored by the Student Activities Board and free for UIC students, faculty and staff. Doors open at 6 p.m., with Guerrero scheduled to take the stage at 7 p.m. “The important thing is that students feel like this is our campus,” Gupta said. “She’s coming for us.” Guerrero, who also stars as Lina on the CW’s “Jane the Virgin,” will speak about comprehensive immigration reform. In recent years, she has advocated for the Immigrant Legal Resource Center and Mi Familia Vota, a nonpartisan organization that promotes Latino/ citizenship and voter registration. “She’s talking about important issues,” said student Cassandra Doman, who will introduce Guerrero at the event. “With all the tension that’s going on, especially in this country, I think that it’s important for people to learn commonsense immigration.” Guerrero will also touch on her life story, which is both inspiring and heartbreaking. When she was 14 years old, her parents were deported back to Colombia because they were undocumented. She was able to stay in the U.S. because of birthright citizenship, but had to live at friends’ houses throughout high school. “Sometimes people don’t take celebrities seriously,” Doman said. “For her, she has real-life experience that make her more than just a celebrity. She’s a real person.” Guerrero overcame these challenges to become a success story. She illuminates her full, complicated life in her memoir, In the Country We Love: My Family Divided , which was released earlier this year. The Student Activities Board will give 25 students the chance to meet Guerrero. More information will be posted on their Facebook and Twitter pages. Topics",

It's particularly a lot if you haven't watched but you want to catch up before the Netflix revival Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life hits the streaming service.\nWhat is a would-be Gilmore Girls fan to do if they want to relive the magic but can't commit the next two weeks of their lives to doing it? We've got a solution for you to catch up with mom Lorelai Gilmore, daughter Rory and their band of pals in the Connecticut town of Stars Hollow.\nWe've reduced the 153-episode series to just 44 episodes — basically two seasons of TV. That's nothing! That's one weekend of binging, plus a few weeknights. It's easily doable before Nov. 25.\nHere's our breakdown of which episodes to watch and why.\nSeason one",

      "text": "Stream The Crown \n\n+ More Options Powered by ***SPOILERS FOR THE CROWN , EPISODES 1-4 AHEAD*** The Crown is a luxe period drama cast with some of the most iconic characters in British history. We watch Winston Churchill, Queen Elizabeth II, and Prince Philip hobnob with one another and argue over power. However the first four episodes of The Crown also introduces us to a young woman of rather common birth. Venetia Scott ( Kate Phillips ) is a bright young blonde thing who finds herself working in 10 Downing Street just as the great Winston Churchill returns to his post as Prime Minister. The Crown depicts them as having an important relationship, but did it really happen? Who was Venetia? And was The Great Smog really that big of a deal?\nHere’s your quick handy explainer…\nWho’s Venetia Scott again? Are you caught up on the first four episodes of The Crown ?\nYes. Okay, she’s the plucky young blonde secretary in Winston Churchill’s office. She’s rather taken with the fact that she gets to work with the famed statesman and is practically swooning over him at every turn.\nIn Episode Four, “Act of God,” she impresses him by quoting his early memoirs. Later, she sees her roommate suffering in the hospital for lack of funds diverted to the hospital and gets a bee in her bonnet: She will tell her new friend Winnie the Pooh all about this and he’ll fix things! It seems an unlikely plan, but then she gets mowed down by a double decker.\n\nCue Winston visiting her corpse in the hospital where he gets the idea to spin the tragedy into a power move. Romantic, right?\nI’m not going to comment on that, but I do want to know if she was real? No. As Radio Times confirms , Venetia Scott’s life and death were manufactured to give writer Peter Morgan a way into The Great Smog, or the Great Smoke, or the Great Pea Soup…whatever you want to call it.\nSo was The Great Smog of 1952 really that big of a deal? Sort of. I mean an estimated 6,000 people died and something like 25,000 people reported health problems. Not to mention the fact that the awfulness of the ordeal spurred Parliament to enact the Clean Air Acts of 1956 and 1968.\nHowever, for all that it affected life for those five days in 1952, it wasn’t that big of a deal. I mean I know that death by climate change is one of the biggest threats we’re facing, but most Brits didn’t even remember it happened until they saw The Crown .\nIn fact, Peter Morgan himself told The Hollywood Reporter that he had never heard of it. He was so transfixed by the event that he wrote a whole episode about it. Now, why should that strike you? Because Peter Morgan is something of a British history nerd amongst screenwriters. If he hadn’t heard of it before that should give you a sense of its soft impact on British culture.\n\nWho played Venetia? Where have I seen her before/where can I see her again? British actress Kate Phillips played the doomed secretary and she’s been on a bit of a roll when it comes to British dramas. Netflix nerds might have noticed her in Season Three of Peaky Blinders , where she played Linda Shelby. She also appeared in the BBC’s lavish adaptation of War & Peace .\nHowever — and this is fun — she once wrestled the crown of England away from The Crown star Claire Foy. Phillips’s first role was playing Jane Seymour in Wolf Hall ; Foy played Anne Boleyn. If you remember your British history, you’ll know that Jane was the woman Henry VIII beheaded Anne for so he could move on and get married.\n[ Watch The Crown on Netflix ]\nWatch Kate Phillips on Streaming \n[ Watch Wolf Hall on Prime Video ]\n[ Watch Peaky Blinders on Netflix ]\n[ Watch War & Peace on Hulu ]\n[Photo: Netflix]\nShare this: Share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) WhatsApp Click to email (Opens in new window) More On: The Crown Will 'The Crown' Finally Get Matt Smith Out Of The Shadow of 'Doctor Who'?

      "text": "Netflix Kills the YouTube Star in Haters Back Off! , a Comedy About the Joys of Hatin' Tuesday, November 8, 2016 at 10:45 a.m. - - Haters Back Off! , a new eight-episode comedy streaming on Netflix, is about putting yourself out there, ignoring the haters, following your dreams no matter who or what stands in your way and utterly humiliating yourself on YouTube. Also at church socials, gay bars, funerals, rest homes — really anywhere Miranda Sings opens her mouth — with the viewer rooting for more and greater humiliations because this fame-obsessed teen is so narcissistic, cruel, controlling, delusional, sullen, phlegmatic and homeschooled that you can barely stand to be on the same internet as her. \nIn that regard it's a mean-spirited show, bringing out our worst impulses — that desire to see a delusional teen with no talent destroyed — but that's OK. It's a dark comedy. You're supposed to feel this way. And it feels very good watching so unsympathetic a character (the sort who berates her mom for failing to give her an A-plus on her homeschool quiz) get her comeuppances — until, of course, it suddenly doesn't, which happens with great force in the season ender, when we're forced to reckon with just what we have wished for. But that happens later; there's a whole season of hatin' to get through first! \nThe Netflix show is the origin story of lipstick-smeared Miranda Sings, a real-life YouTube character created by comedian and (actually very good!) singer Colleen Ballinger. She's been posting videos of Miranda wretchedly singing pop songs in her bedroom since 2008, satirizing the many fame-hungry yet vocally challenged singers belting out covers on YouTube. She's done her job well — Miranda sounds like Ariana Grande after stepping on a flash grenade — and her YouTube channel has more than one billion views, putting her in the top echelon of YouTube stars, with comedy tours and a best-selling book, Selp-Helf . \nIn the Netflix show, Ballinger fleshes out the home life of Miranda, making her the despot of a dysfunctional ranch-house kingdom in Tacoma, Washington. It looks like a dinner-table primetime family comedy, but strewn with microwaved Lunchables, existing on the same weird block as Napoleon Dynamite or Malcolm in the Middle 's more cough-syrupy episodes. (One delightfully strange recurring joke is Miranda devouring ice cream in front of her house; you can almost imagine Napoleon peeking at her through the curtains next door.) Her fantastically enabling mom, Bethany ( The Office 's Angela Kinsey), is quietly horrified by Miranda's attempts to become famous, but she has her own issues, like grappling with \"undiagnosed fibromyalgia,\" which doesn't exist, and wooing a suitor who has an illness fetish. Also on her list is homeschooling Miranda by giving her As with an ever-expanding series of pluses to keep her quiet. \nIn this ramshackle house — it’s so cluttered with the detritus of Middle American life that it could be an art installation about the decline of the suburbs — Miranda and Uncle Jim, played at full tilt by Steve Little ( Eastbound & Down ), plot their absurd schemes to make Miranda famous. Uncle Jim is Miranda's manager-slash-biggest fan, who propels the show along with his childlike \"five-phase plan for fame\" (working as a magician is #5) when he's not having \"innocent\" conversations with Miranda full of creepy subtext. (\"Oh, some cream shot out of my package!\" he says when opening his Lunchables and some frosting squirts on Miranda. \"Oh, that's all right, it landed on my buns!\" she replies. \"I like them extra sticky.\") The designated normal, Miranda's sister Emily (Francesca Reale), spends her time painting, reading philosophy and plotting her escape. EXPAND Courtesy of Netflix \nAfter Miranda posts a video (titled \"My Fist Video,\" delightfully) in the first episode of her singing “Defying Gravity,” the views pile up, the haters crawl into the comments and Haters Back Off! seems hellbent on sending Miranda into viral infamy, à la Rebecca Black. Instead, it feints. How you wish it didn't. How you wish this self-involved character got shamed nationwide from the get-go, but that would be unwrapping the show's promised gift too soon, and well before it stirs some sympathy. Instead, Miranda spends the rest of the season engaged in more terrestrial quests for fame, each more disastrous than the last. \nShe sings at a rest home (if you're nice to the elderly you'll get their stuff), she sings for a movie producer (he dies during the song), then she sings at his funeral (she was supposed to deliver a eulogy). Most of these plot lines are enjoyable but forgettable, save for the hilarious and highly inappropriate staging of Annie in her backyard, which Uncle Jim rewrites as a love story between Annie and Daddy Warbucks, giving Jim and Miranda's creepy-uncle subtext all the room it needs to really gross you out. Also nice is her unhinged \"All That Jazz\" performance in a karaoke gay bar (she thinks it's Seattle's finest theater). \nHaters Back Off! is peppered with funny dialogue (when she's asked by a choir member if she's alto or soprano, Miranda says, “I’m an American”), but it's ultimately all about Ballinger showing off her Miranda. She's had years to hone her star's mannerisms and tics, and they’re a joy to watch, from the frown of her resting face to her awkward dancing to the way she stomps out of rooms, which the camera never fails to catch. \nThe cartoon quality of the show keeps the darker questions at bay, but there are legions: Why is Miranda so cruel? Why can't she see herself as she is? Has she ever been diagnosed? Is her mother to blame? In a scene where Bethany and Jim have to share a bed for the night, the show makes a mockery of real familial affection. The two bond over bread. Jim compliments Bethany's choice of bread — \"even if it's from the day-old shelf\" — and they share a fond memory of discovering that bread works just fine as a hot dog bun, for those times when you don't have a hot dog bun. Before they drift off to sleep, Jim loudly hocks up something disgusting, breaking the sweet mood caused by ... bread. \nIn some ways, the series end can't come fast enough. What starts as an exploration of going viral online turns into a bumbling trip down the entertainment back alleys of church choirs, CD-release parties and magic shows. The promise of the first episode — that Miranda would go truly viral, breaking her world apart — is teased at the very end, but not before she suffers through her greatest humiliation yet. But after hearing her devastating words shouted at a mocking audience — \"Why are you laughing? Why is it funny that someone would love me?\" — suddenly we're not in the mood to see her get hurt anymore.",

      "text": "Peter Lynch Chart of NFLX Comcast announced this week that it will launch Netflix on X1 to millions of customers nationwide. The integration will allow X1 customers who have Netflix subscriptions to be able to access Netflix's online library alongside the live, on demand, DVR and web programming included with their Xfinity TV subscription. This makes Netflix an add-on to Comcast's offerings, similar to how we add channels to our TV subscriptions. \"The Netflix integration into the X1 platform means our mutual customers will no longer need to change inputs or juggle remotes,\" said Reed Hastings, Netflix co-founder and chief executive officer. \"Now they can seamlessly move between the Netflix app and their cable service, enjoying all the TV shows and movies they love without hassle.\" There are two underlying factors that have driven these \"natural-born competitors\" to work together instead of against each other. Netflix is already near the 50 million subscriber mark in the U.S., where the total number of people with broadband access is just a tad above 90 million, a penetration of more than 50%. When you factor in families who won't require multiple subscriptions, the penetration level is bound to be much higher than 50% of the potential market size. In the last four quarters Netflix's total membership in the U.S. has moved from 43.18 million to 47.50 million, a growth of 10%. With every additional customer added to the pool there is one customer less in the potential market, making the odds of growth slower as Netflix keeps expanding within the country. As a hypergrowth story with a bulk of its revenues coming from the U.S., single-digit growth rate is not something that will be palatable for the company. Unfortunately, Netflix has no choice but to accept reality as competition in the video streaming market is slowly heating up. The best bet for Netflix would be international market growth, but it needs to build local content and establish itself in certain key markets. These things will take time, and until that happens the company needs to hold its ground in the home market and, if possible, give as little space as possible for its competitors to grow. By aligning with Comcast, Netflix is expanding its reach to cable customers who are not yet ready to cut the cord and go with a video streaming service alone. In a sense, they are just making it easier for a bigger pool of people to access Netflix in the hope that they won't go to a smaller competitor while they maintain their cable connections. So the twofold need of Netflix to keep growth stable in the home market and get access to a new pool of potential users has led to this decision to sleep with the enemy. But on Comcast's part it's a brilliant stroke because Netflix is no longer an enemy but an ally. The more content Netflix gets, the more Comcast gets and the latter's customers are happy because Netflix is now integrated with their main connection. And Comcast now has a pool of exclusive content to serve the massive group of overlapping users who subscribe to both services. It's unclear at this point whether this was a good move for Netflix, but at least it will help keep its user growth intact for a little while, giving it the time it needs to beef up local content for international markets.

      "text": "  Ubisoft is in talks for a Netflix series based on one of its games Ubisoft's CEO claims the publisher is working with Netflix on a potential show.   05:00 PM PT News \nUbisoft could be expanding the reach of its properties into television. The publisher has announced that it’s currently in talks with the streaming service Netflix to produce a series. \nA Reuters article recently reported that Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot stated the publisher was “in talks with Netflix over a series.” There is no information on what the project could be or when we will see it, but knowing Ubisoft, it seems fans can expect one of their favorite Ubisoft gaming properties to show up as a Netflix series sometime in the near future. \nAccording to the report, the comment about Netflix was made during discussions about Vivendi “gradually increasing its stake” in Ubisoft despite the publisher’s desire to stay independent . \nWhile Ubisoft has too many games under its purview to speculate which one is being considered for adaptation, any project will likely fall into one of two categories. The first, and perhaps more likely option, would be a kid-centric, animated series based on one of Ubisoft’s family-friendly properties, like Rayman or the inexplicably popular Rabbids. The second, more intriguing option, would be a live action series aimed at a more mature audience—though many of those games are already being developed as films, too. \nSpeaking of which, the Assassin’s Creed film hits theaters on December 21st. It should offer an early test of whether Ubisoft can adapt one its properties successfully.",

      "text": "Everything we know about Netflix's 'Gilmore Girls' revival \nThe votes are in for a Gilmore Girls -inspired ice cream flavor. \nBrooklyn-based Ample Hills Creamery held a contest to determine a new flavor celebrating the upcoming Netflix revival of the popular series, and announced the winner on Monday. \nThe flavor is named “They Scoop Gilmores, Don’t They?” — a reference to the pivotal season 3 episode, “They Shoot Gilmores, Don’t They?” which in itself is a reference to Horace McCoy’s novel about a dance marathon, They Shoot Horses, Don’t They? . \nAppropriately, the ice cream combines coffee (of course), chocolate pudding ( because Emily really tried ), and snickerdoodles (as in, “ Oy with the snickerdoodles already! ”), topped, of course, with pink Pop-Tart sprinkles. \nDon’t live in New York? Don’t worry; the flavor is available now for nationwide shipping. \nGilmore Girls: A Year in the Life arrives on Netflix on Nov. 25.

      "text": "Tweet \nFor a while now, we get keep getting asked as to whether or not any of ABC’s The Middle is streaming on Netflix. Today, we’re going to give you an idea as to whether any of the seven available seasons are on Netflix and if not, what the chances are of ever getting the series on Netflix. \nThe show which airs on Tuesdays on ABC is considered to be one of the best sitcoms that ABC currently has on the air with its eight season on television right now. It still doesn’t get even close to the quality of ABC’s Modern Family but still, it’s a great sitcom that shows no sign of slowing down. \nIt follows a dysfunctional family where the kids are growing up and parents are fighting to keep their relationship relatively normal. Let’s take a look as to whether or not you can stream The Middle on Netflix. \nAs of right now, it seems that ABC’s only streaming plans for the show exist on its own platforms including that of Hulu. On Hulu, you’re only able to currently view the past few episodes of the most recent series. The complete collection has been on their at some point but is no longer. The ABC website also carries some of the most recent episodes but not the full catalog. \nIt turns out that The Middle isn’t available on any Netflix regions across the world whereas other ABC shows are such as Modern Family and Once Upon A Time. \nIf you’re looking to stream all of the series though, you’ll be struggling to do so with a packaged streaming account and therefore you’ll have to look towards video-on-demand services to get your Middle fix.

By Michael Passalacqua \nUbisoft is in talks to make a new series with Netflix, CEO Yves Guillemot announced on Monday. \nAlthough nothing else in known about what the show could be, the series is in an effort to keep Ubisoft independent in the midst of pressure from shareholder Vivendi, according to a Reuters report. \nVivendi began purchasing shares in Ubisoft late last year and continued to do so after acquiring Gameloft in June . The French mass media company ruled out making a Ubisoft hostile takeover bid in October, but currently holds more than 20 percent of shares, according to Reuters. Guillemot has called the potential of a Vivendi takeover a \"disaster\". \nThe publisher already has a film and television division of its own titled Ubisoft Motion Pictures, which is producing the upcoming Assassin's Creed movie , as well as projects based on The Division (starring Jake Gyllenhaal and Jessica Chastain) and Splinter Cell, with Tom Hardy . The company has also previously released an interactive Rabbids TV show . \nUbisoft isn't the only game company to have interest in a Netflix series - Activision's film and television division just released a Skylanders animated series on the streaming service . \nMichael Passalacqua is a freelance writer for IGN.

      "text": "Ubisoft In Talks to Make a Netflix Series, According to CEO Nothing about the series is known at this time. By Michael Passalacqua \nUbisoft is in talks to make a new series with Netflix, CEO Yves Guillemot announced on Monday. \nAlthough nothing else in known about what the show could be, the series is in an effort to keep Ubisoft independent in the midst of pressure from shareholder Vivendi, according to a Reuters report. \nVivendi began purchasing shares in Ubisoft late last year and continued to do so after acquiring Gameloft in June . The French mass media company ruled out making a Ubisoft hostile takeover bid in October, but currently holds more than 20 percent of shares, according to Reuters. Guillemot has called the potential of a Vivendi takeover a \"disaster\". \nThe publisher already has a film and television division of its own titled Ubisoft Motion Pictures, which is producing the upcoming Assassin's Creed movie , as well as projects based on The Division (starring Jake Gyllenhaal and Jessica Chastain) and Splinter Cell, with Tom Hardy . The company has also previously released an interactive Rabbids TV show . \nUbisoft isn't the only game company to have interest in a Netflix series - Activision's film and television division just released a Skylanders animated series on the streaming service . \nMichael Passalacqua is a freelance writer for IGN. Chat with him on Twitter about the New York Giants’ unsurprising mediocrity.",

      "text": "What Women Eat In UK Prisons Lucy Vincent Photo: Courtesy of Netflix. More Sophie is so passionate about eating well that listening to her talk about her diet isn’t dissimilar to hearing a food blogger sing the praises of going gluten-free or cutting down on dairy. “I really watch what I eat,” says the 30-year-old, “No processed food or additives, no sugar – nothing like that” she says proudly. However, Sophie didn’t choose to eat this way because of what she read in the latest bestselling recipe book. Her diet is a direct reaction to the three years she spent in prison. “The food was so shit inside that it just completely turned me off anything processed or poor quality”, she explains. Since the mid '90s, the female prison population has almost doubled – jumping from 1,979 in 1995 to 3,935 in 2015. With more women in jail and less government money in the pot for prison spending, things are tough. While MP Chris Grayling held the post of Justice Secretary, between 2012 and 2015, there was a 38% rise in deaths in UK prisons, according to The Guardian . But among the news stories about overcrowding, prison violence and suicide, rarely do you hear what prisoners in British jails eat. A recent report by HM Inspectorate of Prisons has shed new light on the subject, however. We may have come a long way since prisoners were served stale bread and watery porridge but the report, entitled Life in Prison: Food , suggests there’s still a long way to go. The report inspected both men’s and women’s jails, as well as young offenders’ institutions in England and Wales. It found dissatisfaction across the board – only 29% of prisoner survey respondents described the food they received as “good” or “very good”. Food being served below temperature, lack of communal dining due to staff shortages and low nutritional quality feature prominently in the findings. It was even suggested that frustration with their diets had caused prisoners to behave violently and disruptively; last year, one inmate at HMP Northumberland staged a protest on a high railing after being served a cold meal. Women are fed up. Only 2% of females in HM Prison Holloway labelled the food as “very good”, with a 34% majority calling it “very bad”. “Meals did not have sufficient portions of fruit or vegetables” reported one inspector at HMP Low Newton – a problem that seemed to crop up continuously. So what exactly are our prisoners eating to cause such low approval ratings? Sophie was in prison for three years and, in her faintly sarcastic words, “Had the pleasure of experiencing three different menus” after getting kicked out of two prisons for “naughty behaviour”. A few times we had dish cloths served up in the food from where something had spilt in the kitchen and they’d just been told to scoop it up and chuck it back in the tray. She explains that breakfast always came courtesy of a pack that was handed out at dinner the night before. A carton of UHT milk, tea bags, sugar, coffee whitener and cornflakes (“Occasionally you’d be lucky and get Coco Pops”) were the usual suspects. Chips, pasta, soup or a sandwich made up lunch and something along the lines of a stew or curry with some form of carb was served for dinner. So far, not bad. Sunday was a roast: “I don’t know how they cooked their potatoes though,” says Sophie, “When you tried to cut into them, your plastic knife would break or bend.” Rock-solid spuds aside, prison food sounds akin to school dinners before Jamie Oliver brought about change in the form of cabbage slaws and courgette focaccia. However, over the course of hours of unoccupied time inside a cell, the need for nutrition and lack of fresh, fruit-and-veg-filled food takes on huge significance. “You know when you have a weekend off and eat pizzas, beers and stuff and you feel crap,” says Sophie, “Imagine feeling that way for three years – and it being completely out of your control. I put on about five stone when I was in prison. During my last year when I was on home leave, I remember leaving prison and the first thing I did was pop into Morrisons and buy a shitload of salad and chicken breast. I made up a little salad on the train back and ate it straight away. Even now I absolutely love salad because I just didn’t have it in prison.” Sophie’s sudden weight gain and craving for salads or lighter meals isn’t an isolated case. For women, controlling their weight while inside can feel like an impossible task. Perri Northage is an advisor for the charity Women in Prison . She spends her time working with women in prisons across the country and cites nutrition as a regular topic of frustration she hears time and time again. Read More “If they’re unable to get regular exercise and they’re eating a lot of carbohydrates, saturated food and snacks, then controlling their weight can become an issue,” Perri explains, “It then feeds into their self-esteem. Either their clothes don’t fit them or it’s just another layer of ‘I don’t feel good about myself’.” Photo: Courtesy of Netflix. More Low self-esteem can be crippling at the best of times – when you add mental health issues, a history of domestic violence or substance abuse into the mix, the result can be devastating. According to Women in Prison , women in custody are five times more likely to have a mental health condition than a woman on the outside, and 46% of women in prison have previously suffered from domestic violence. 52% of women surveyed by the charity said they'd used heroin, crack or cocaine in the four weeks prior to custody. When you are dealing with the welfare of some of society’s most vulnerable, providing them with food of high nutritional value arguably becomes a matter of great urgency. Even the report highlights the need, stating: “Studies have also found that nutritional supplements reduce disciplinary incidents, aggression and violent behaviour. In other words, prisoners eating well is not just a matter of prisoner wellbeing but is also of practical and financial concern to the prison service.\" Financially, like the majority of the UK’s institutions, food spending is tight. Spend per day, per prisoner on food is around £2, compared to £10 in hospitals. Perri suggests that more money may be needed to improve food. “I imagine quality food comes at a price” she says – but Sophie disagrees. “I don’t think it’s funding” she says, “They need to teach the women cooking to actually take pride in the food they’re serving. A few times we had dish cloths served up in the food from where something had spilt in the kitchen and they’d just been told to scoop it up and chuck it back in the tray.” Talk to anyone about the issue of prison food and the same question crops up: Why should we feed our prisoners well when they’re supposed to be getting punished? Unlike children or patients, these are individuals who have committed crimes or disrupted society, often at the expense of others. But with prison suicides and assaults at a 10 year high, something is obviously going wrong with our prison system. And it would be ignorant to rule out prisoners' diets as a contributing factor. If simple, cheap, nutritional food, packed with fresh fruit and vegetables has transformed our country’s classrooms in the last 10 years, surely there’s an argument for doing the same in the UK’s prisons. Until that happens, however, prisoners are finding clever ways of feeding themselves the good stuff. Sophie remembers “Keeping the seeds from the tomatoes of the very occasional salad we had and planting them, in the hope I’d get tomatoes.” Talk to anyone about the issue of prison food and the same question crops up: Why should we feed our prisoners well when they’re supposed to be getting punished? A few of her friends took things a step further, drawing inspiration from Orange Is The New Black and converting to a new religion in the search for better food. “They decided to become Muslim because the food they got during Ramadan was amazing, or Judaism, because the Kosher food was fantastic.” These radical attempts by female prisoners to get their hands on a decent meal suggest an existing interest in quality food and cooking. One organisation has seized that interest as an opportunity. The Clink Charity aims to reduce reoffending simply by teaching prisoners how to cook. It runs four restaurants within the walls of four different prisons; the most recent opening, at women’s prison HMP Styal, has increased the number of prisoners the charity trains to 160 per day. With an 87.5% success rate in reducing reoffending, the prisoners prep, cook and serve restaurant-standard meals to the paying public. A far cry from cornflakes and pasta bakes, Styal’s menu features everything from mushroom dust to plum gel and a chicken wing lollypop. The Clink has even had food critic Giles Coren’s stamp of approval, with restaurants now booked up notoriously far in advance. Christopher Moore, Chief Executive of The Clink believes the kind of skills these prisoners learn is invaluable, particularly for women. “Providing the women prisoners with the skills to cook both benefits their career and personal life,” he says, “It allows them to go back home and bond over a family meal while also learning a trade that is highly sought-after, especially as the hospitality industry is experiencing a major skills shortage.” It’s without doubt that initiatives such as The Clink are generating positive change. But this year’s food in prisons report highlights that the daily reality is far removed from the free-range beef and handmade ravioli of HMP Styal. Improving prison food, it indicates, has the potential to transform the way prisons function in the UK, not to mention the wellbeing of the women who spend time in those prisons. For now, the future of prison food is as unclear as the future of our prisons, with Theresa May's new Justice Secretary Liz Truss seemingly backtracking on plans that were made under David Cameron's leadership to undo Grayling's damaging work and attempt some sort of reform. Yet while the system remains in a state of flux, Sophie and Perri believe there’s no better time to look to our prison kitchens for a solution. “If [women prisoners] are eating food with no nutritional value whatsoever then of course that replicates what they feel about themselves,” says Perri. “Whereas, if you give the women something that has been carefully planned, carefully created and looks appealing... it can have a dramatically different effect.\" Like what you see? How about some more R29 goodness, right here?",

      "text": "Will Nancy Stay With Steve? Netflix \nWhen Nancy (Natalie Dyer) chose Steve (Joe Keery) over Jonathan (Charlie Heaton) at the end of Season 1, her decision was an unpopular one. Yes, Steve sorta redeemed himself — but slut-shaming her all over town was not at all cool. From the cast snap, we can clearly see that all three are returning, so it's possible that Jonathan and Nancy may still have some unfinished romanic business. It's also High School, and anything can change in a year. Barb is Definitely Not Coming Back Netflix \nObviously, the absences are as telling as the attendees. While Hopper (David Harbour) and Joyce Byers (Winona Ryder) are confirmed but not pictured, the absence of our beloved Barb (Shannon Purser) means that she is not likely to return in any dimension. Her ruthless killing-off in Episode 3 caused some outrage for its complete lack of compassion. Poor Barb might be gone, but fans have made sure she will not be forgotten, and hopefully Season 2 can right its wrongs regarding her character... looks like they already have : \nAs the image only shows the kids of Season 2, the jury is still out on the return of Dr. Brenner/\"Papa\" (Matthew Modine), but seeing as he was mauled by the Demogorgon, he's probably gone the same way as Barb. New Cast Members YOU GUYS. I am so happy and thrilled to join the cast of @Stranger_Things for season 2!! Thanks for all of the love and support! — Sadie Sink (@SadieSink) October 14, 2016 \nTwo brand new cast members have been announced for Season 2, both of which appear in the image suggesting that they will both play a big role in the upcoming season. Sadie Silk (far right) will play Max, a tomboy with a difficult history and a suspicious streak — it is strongly speculated that she will be the 'MadMax' the sneak peek hints at . Dacre Montgomery is also visible to the far left, and will play Billy, Max's charismatic, violent, Camaro-driving older step-brother. \nNow that Stranger Things Season 2 is fully in production, we can expect plenty more cast photos and juicy theories coming our way in the next few months. Season 1 aired July 15 2016, so we can probably expect a similar summer release date for 2017. In the mean time, stock up on those Eggos, kick back with The Clash and try to figure out that those mysterious episode titles could mean. Poll Are you pumped for 'Stranger Things' Season 2? Yes! It's the best show Netflix have put out I enjoyed Season 1, but it should have ended there I'll watch it, but only for Winona <3 Without Barb, what's the point? The show sucks, I never got the hype Trending from our Creators ",

      "text": "No one ever thought they’d see the day when Netflix and Comcast joined forces.\nWell, believe it or not, that day is here.\nBeginning next week, Comcast X1 cable boxes will host Netflix.\nNetflix CEO Reed Hastings says the addition of Netflix to a cable giant like Comcast will be a “big boost in the number of households that can get Netflix on their TV.” Both Netflix and the pay-TV industry have seen a decline in subscribers, so this collaboration will hopefully give them both a boost in sales.\n ",

      "text": "Apple TV? Amazon Prime? Roku? What’s the easiest... | 17 minutes ago | Vote 0 0 Apple TV? Amazon Prime? Roku? What’s the easiest way to get Netflix on your TV Netflix A reader sent a message this week asking about my preferred method for watching Netflix on a TV. Such a simple question. So many different answers. Since they asked, I'm guessing they don't have a smart TV, one with a built-in Netflix app. So we are talking about adding a streaming box to their current TV. For this, you should have an open HDMI port on the TV. Almost all the choices we'll talk about here need to connect to your TV via HDMI. Now we need to ask a few questions that might lead us to a specific box. Do you have any brand allegiances? For instance, do you have Macs (or iPads or iPhones) at home that would make you predisposed to picking Apple TV ($149.99)? Are you a subscriber to Amazon's Prime service? Amazon has a video streaming service that's included in the Prime subscription. The easiest and cheapest way to take advantage of Prime video is through an Amazon Fire TV Stick ($39.99). Roku also makes a full line of streaming devices that can be added to any TV. The easiest and most inexpensive is its Streaming Stick, which is on sale for $39.99 at Roku.com. The Roku has the most video sources, both free and paid, including Netflix. Apple TV is nice. It has a bunch of apps to stream different video services, and it has games, but at such a price premium, I can't recommend it for people who want simple streaming. I should also mention Google's Chromecast ($35), which is a streaming dongle you attach to your TV's HDMI port. It enables you to \"cast\" video playing from your phone or tablet or computer to your TV screen. This means that the device you already have (Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, Chromebook) is the source and Chromecast is the receiver. Casting a show or movie isn't difficult, but it's not the easiest choice. So if all you want is Netflix, the cheapest and simplest way is either Amazon's or Roku's streaming sticks. Of those two, I'd say Roku has a bit cleaner interface. | Join The Conversation Sign Up Login Most Read",

      "title": "Orange Is The New Black Season 5: What We Know So Far",
      "text": "By Corey Chichizola \nSince its first season on Netflix, black comedy Orange is the New Black has continued to reinvent itself. What started as the story of Piper's introduction to prison has since become an ensemble piece that fleshes out the backstories of both the inmates and correctional officers. Each season has its own overarching plot, and Season 4 was all about Litchfield Correctional Facility going through major changes and becoming a much darker place than we saw years ago. \nSeason 4 really flipped the script on what to expect from Orange is the New Black . Due to the disarray of the prison, inmates were seen standing up to authority, and the ensemble all fractured into their own stories. Now we can look forward to Season 5, and what to expect from the season. Will more characters die? Will we see a return of long lost inmates? What's going on with that gun? Here's what we know about OITNB Season 5. When Will Season 5 Be Released? \nThe release date for Orange is the New Black has not been set yet by Netflix , but the series has set a certain precedent for itself. Season 1-4 have consistently been released toward the middle of June, and we can probably expect the same for Season 5. Filming had already begun a few months ago, so there's no reason why OITNB wouldn't keep it consistent. Summer TV shows have the added advantage of less competition, and it's become a ritual for TV fans to expect shows like Orange and Game of Thrones once the weather gets warmer. Which Actors Will Return? \nAt this point in Orange is the New Black 's tenure, they've amassed quite the extended cast of inmates and CO's. We can obviously expect to see series regulars like Piper ( Taylor Schilling ), Alex ( Laura Prepon ), Gloria Mendoza (Selenis Levya, who will make her MCU debut in Spider-Man: Homecoming ), and Red ( Kate Mulgrew ). But there are quite a few casting questions that are up in the air. Despicable Correctional Officer Humphrey's (Michael Torpey) fate is certainly in the air, as we last saw him at the scary end of a gun. Considering how furious the inmates are, it's not out of the question that he might end up dead in the opening moments of the Season 5 premiere. There is also a question mark around Lori Petty 's Lolly, who was a breakout character last season. While Petty seemed to not know if Lolly was appearing in Season 5, she seemed fairly confident she'd have some sort of role, as the character is currently in psych. \nThen there's Laverne Cox , who was largely absent during Season 4. Now that Sophia is out of the SHU, hopefully Cox will finally get the promotion to series regular that she's been owed. Sophia was one of the first characters to get a backstory episode, and it was a groundbreaking moment in Hollywood. It's strange that Sophia has been kept mostly as a tertiary character, especially considering how much fans love her. Most of the cast has gotten raises since Season 1, so it's time for Laverne Cox and Sophia to get what they deserve. Which Characters Are Currently In The SHU? \nWith all of the Litchfield ladies spread across different facilities, it can be a bit confusing to remember where everyone is. Sophia spent most of Season 4 in The SHU because of sheer negligence, as well as her own fighting spirit. Because there was no one to help her, Sister Ingalls (Beth Fowler) purposefully got herself sent to solitary in an attempt to find and help Sofia. This eventually worked, but Sister Ingalls is still stuck in the box for the foreseeable future. \nOf course, its possible that The SHU will become very crowded after the events of the Season 4 finale. Inmates are usually sent to solitary for bad or aggressive behavior, and the finale ended with a riot starting within the prison. Basically anyone who was present in the final scene has the potential to be shipped off to The SHU or Max, so Sister Ingalls may be released to make room for more deviant inmates. Lucky her.",

      "text": "Warning: This post contains spoilers for The Crown \nThe Crown , Netflix’s new series about the life of Britain’s Queen Elizabeth II, begins on a gruesome note: King George VI (played by Jared Harris) coughing up blood.\nJust a few episodes into the big-budget series, which launched on the streaming service last Friday, the King of England is pronounced dead — and his daughter, Elizabeth (Claire Foy), takes the crown. Here’s what you need to know about the real death of His Majesty King George VI:\nWho was King George VI? \nAlbert Frederick Arthur George ruled England for almost 16 years after his brother, Edward VIII, abdicated the throne in 1936 in order to marry Wallis Simpson, a divorced American socialite. (Marriage to a divorcée was forbidden for a king.) He had married Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon in 1923, and the pair had two daughters by the time he took the thrown: Elizabeth and Margaret.\nThe conscientious, dedicated and highly religious King had a stammer, which he never fully overcame—and which was the central topic of the 2010 blockbuster The King’s Speech , which won four Oscars. King George, who called himself a “very ordinary person,” was also the first British monarch to attend a state visit in the United States, which he did in 1939.\nWhat was his health like? \nThe world first heard of the King’s artery trouble in 1948, when he gave up public appearances because of pain in his right leg and foot. His doctors decided that their patient was a victim of thromboangiitis obliterans, also called Buerger’s disease. They found, too, that all his arteries were hardened beyond his years.\nThe Second World War took a toll on the King’s health, and it didn’t help that he was a heavy smoker. He developed lung cancer and underwent a serious leg operation for a circulatory ailment, which threatened the loss of his limb. In 1951, he had a lung operation to remove an obstruction in the left bronchus, which he never fully recovered from. “In deciding to risk the operation, the King was guided by advisers of his own choosing,” TIME reported , following the surgery. “In all but their most private affairs, Britain’s constitutional monarchs do what they are told, but the government has no say in their choice of doctors.”\n“In his own room, the King was injected with an anesthetic (probably sodium pentothal) by Anesthetist Robert Machray. He was wheeled to the operating room and… his left side propped up slightly with pillows,” the article continued. “After that, Patient George was put on a soft diet, from soft-boiled eggs to such delicacies as steamed fish. Because of his old trouble with poor circulation, it was essential for the King to have a few minutes out of bed each day, as soon as his strength permitted.”\nGet your history fix in one place: sign up for the weekly TIME History newsletter \nWhat did that mean for Elizabeth?\n\nKing George’s failing health and lung surgery meant delegating more of his royal duties to his daughter Elizabeth, the heir presumptive. On Jan. 31, 1952, he went to London Airport to see her off on a diplomatic visit to Australia and New Zealand, via Kenya, despite medical advice from those close to him.\nElizabeth and her husband Philip spent a night away from the lodge at the Treetops Hotel in Kenya’s Aberdare National Park, where, after seeing the elephants, she was too excited to sleep, as TIME reported , and “kept leaving her cot to watch other nocturnal visitors at the waterhole.” In the morning, “she breakfasted on bacon and eggs, and tossed bananas to baboons below.” It wasn’t until early afternoon that a reporter from a local newspaper called and told Philip that the King had died.\nHow did he die? \nThe King was found dead in bed at Sandringham House in Norfolk, on the morning of Feb. 6. He had died from a coronary thrombosis — a blocking of blood flow to the heart as a result of a blood clot in an artery — in his sleep. He was only 56 years old.\n“Footman Daniel Long, who took a cup of cocoa to the King at 11 p.m. and found him in bed reading a sportsman’s magazine, was the last person to see the King alive,” TIME’s obituary of the King read. “Early next day, a servant brought the King ‘s morning cup of tea. The tea was never drunk: a blood clot had stilled George VI ‘s valiant heart as he slept.”\nWhat happened next? \nBack in London, “church bells tolled, Union Jacks flew at half-staff, shops and factories closed for the day, and the BBC stopped broadcasting after airing an announcement of the King’s death,” TIME reported . “Crowds of people stood in the cold rain for hours outside Buckingham Palace.”\nThe King’s coffin rested in St. Mary Magdalene Church in Sandringham, before lying in state at Westminster Hall. His funeral took place at St. George’s Chapel, Windsor Castle, on the 15th. Fifty years later, in 2002, the remains of his wife, Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother, and the ashes of his daughter Margaret were interred in the chapel alongside him.",

      "text": "It's been just under four months since Stranger Things dropped on Netflix and took televisions and the internet by storm. The horror/sci-fi series wowed audiences with its mysterious story, compelling characters and 1980's horror aesthetic. With only an eight-episode first season, it didn't take long for many to binge that first batch of episodes with a resounding demand for season 2, which was officially announced in August.\nIn an interview with Collider , director Shawn Levy confirmed that production on the second season commenced two days ago, revealing that the show will be filming in Atlanta once more, along with how Netflix originally planned to announce the return of Millie Bobby Brown as Eleven . “We are filming in Atlanta again. I feel like that’s how the Millie Brown [return] leaked because someone saw her trick or treating in Atlanta. I was so bummed about that because Netflix had this really clever idea of taking a picture at our table read last week and posting it upside down, which is what we did. But then like two days before our clever idea got to debut, a bunch of places were reporting that Millie was gonna be a part of Season 2.”\nLevy also teased the plot of the second season, saying it will still revolve around the core group of characters (along with some compelling new additions) trying to find a sense of normalcy in their lives after rhe harrowing events of the first season. “I’m not gonna say how much time has gone by. It is not the next day, I’ll say that. And there are several new characters who I think several of them are going to be new fan-favorites because they’re great, great new characters. But we are definitely sticking primarily with our core group, and what is different, how are they changed from the experience of last season… maybe ‘normal’ is never possible again. Will Byers was in that Upside Down for a while. So Season 2 is about this determined desire to return to normalcy in Hawkins, in the Byers family, in that group of friends, and it’s the struggle to reclaim normalcy and maybe the impossibility of it.”\nLevy, who directed the third and fourth episodes of the first season, revealed that he will do the same for season 2 out of \"superstition\", and teased the possibility of a planned third season of the show as well. “We are not gonna be caught off guard and we don’t wanna be making stuff up like the day before we have to write it and make it, so we are definitely optimistic and we have started thinking ahead.”",

      "text": "How Did King George VI Die? How Realistic Is King George VI's Death in Netflix's The Crown? November 9, 2016 \nImage Source: Getty / Handout \nIf you've found yourself obsessed with Netflix's latest hit series, The Crown , you're not alone. The $130 million drama follows the sweeping, tumultuous romance between a young Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip and how the premature death of her father shaped not only the rest of their lives but history itself. In addition to nailing the look of the real-life royals , writer Peter Morgan also makes sure each episode chronicling their story is as accurate as possible. One such example is the realistic portrayal of King George VI's last days before he dies of lung cancer in the second episode, spurring on Elizabeth's career as the queen of the UK. \nIn 1937, George VI — born Albert Frederick Arthur George Saxe-Coburg-Gotha — was crowned king after his brother Prince Edward abdicated so that he could marry American socialite Wallis Simpson. George VI navigated the ups and downs of World War II (including overcoming his debilitating stutter with the help of wife Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon) and became an important symbolic leader for the British people. Unfortunately, the stress of years at war took a toll on King George VI, and his health began to seriously decline. It's during this time that the then-Princess Elizabeth, his presumptive heir, was tasked with taking over his royal duties. \nImage Source: Netflix \nAs seen in the first episode of the show, a tour of New Zealand and Australia had to be postponed due to the king's health. He suffered an arterial blockage in 1949, and by 1951 his years of nonstop smoking led to a lung cancer and arteriosclerosis diagnosis. By September of that same year, his left lung was removed. Unfortunately, the 56-year-old king could not rebound from his devastating health issues, and on the morning of Feb. 6, 1952, George VI was discovered dead in his bed chambers. He officially died of a coronary thrombosis (or in layman's terms, a blood clot in the heart). From then on, Princess Elizabeth became known as Queen Elizabeth II.",

      "text": "Did you hear about Netflix? Darren Handschuh  00 am | Story: 180410 Photo: Contributed \nI came home from work the other day and Junior informed me he had signed us up for Netflix. \n“That was very kind of you son. And, why do I want Netflix?” \n“Because they have tons of cool shows.” \n“OK, and I assume I will be the one paying for all these cool shows.” \n“Um, er, well...lemme show you what all they have.” \nSo now, I have Netflix (which actually is pretty cool.) \nThey do have a lot of good stuff – and a lot of stuff I could care less about – but it has more that interests me than what is on TV, so I figure I will give it a try. \nThe problem is, our television set is so old, Fred Flintstone used to watch it. \nIt is an old bubble TV that we got for free when our other ancient TV packed it in a couple of years ago. But despite its age, it does everything I require of a TV – it lets me watch TV. \nThe challenge now was, how do I get Netflix from our wi-fi router to our ancient boob tube? \nThere had to be a way, so the Missus and I headed to the local electronics store to see what kind of gizmo we would need to make the magic happen. \nThe first store we stopped at we were assisted by a lad so young his voice had barely finished changing. \nWe explained our situation while he looked at us with a blank stare. \nHe then called his manager over – who was just slightly older - and she too gave us a blank stare and said they could not help us. \nHmm, perhaps this will be a little more difficult than I thought. \nBut we carried on with our quest and explained the situation to the kid at the next store. \nThis guy seemed a little older as was evident by the three whiskers he had growing out of his chin. I had a pair of shoes older than he was, but at least he was not giving us the blank stare. \nBut as we told Scooter about the situation, he did look at us like we were hill folk in town for our annual pilgrimage. \nObviously, he could not believe someone – anyone – in this day and age would still have a bubble TV. \nOn the outside, he listened patiently, but I am sure on the inside he was thinking: “These old people need to get with the times. I hope they don't break a hip in the store. I wonder where they parked their walkers? \n\"A bubble TV ... I can't wait to tell everyone on lunch break.” \nI am not at the top of the tech game, but I am hardly a dinosaur – even if my TV was around the same time T-Rex was. \nI may have recently slid past the 50 mark, but I am hardly ready for a home – although some days, it does sound appealing. \nUnlike Skippy at the first store, this guy actually had an idea of what we needed, and after he explained the situation to a much older co-worker – this guy was at least 25 – they found what we were looking for. \nIt is some sort of adapter that receives the wi-fi signal and will hook up to our Jurassic TV set. \nI must admit, deep down I was scanning new TVs and secretly hoping we could replace the bubble with a new, high-tech contraption, but Scooter came through and the gizmo thingy works just fine. \nThat's OK, the gizmo cost a lot less than a new TV and the bubble TV works just fine – and now it works with Netflix.",

      "text": "Chelsea Handler wants to move to Spain now that Donald Trump is president. (Photo: Netflix screengrab) \nThe comedian broke down in tears while discussing Hillary Clinton’s loss to the Republican nominee during an interview with Senator Barbara Boxer for her Netflix series. \n“Obviously the result is not what I was hoping for,” Handler said. “Like a lot of people in this country I’m sad, I’m disappointed and I’m confused, but if Hillary can make it through a concession speech then I can make it through a stupid television show.” (RELATED: Chelsea Handler Mocks Melania Trump After She Threatens To Sue News Outlets) \n“As a woman, it feels so sexist,” Handler said as she began crying. “I guess the message that I want to spread out to other women is exactly what you’re saying, is not to give up. Sorry, I hate fucking crying on camera.” \nWATCH: \n“It’s so easy to say throw in the towel and that we’re going to leave or I’m going to move to Spain, because I want to move to Spain,” she said. \n“I really, really want to move to Spain right now. Everyone in my office is like ‘You have a responsibility, you have a voice and you need to use it, and you have to be here.'” \n“When you say, ‘I want to leave, I want to go,’ of course — it’s the flight syndrome,” Boxer then told Handler. (RELATED: Chelsea Handler Was Asked About Angelina Jolie’s Divorce — She Didn’t Hold Back) \n“That’s just what the people who gave this hateful message want us to do and we’re not going to do it.” (Photo: Netflix screengrab) \nIn May, Handler said she wasn’t one of those people who would threaten to leave and then not follow through. \n“I did buy a house in another country just in case, so all of these people that threaten to leave the country and then don’t, I will leave the country,” Handler said during an interview with “Michael and Kelly.” (RELATED: Celebrities Who Threatened To Leave The Country If Trump Won — And Now Changed Their Minds)",

      "text": "What Netflix's The Crown gets right — and where they went rogue Just now The historical facts presented in Netflix's new drama The Crown   \nNetflix's newest series The Crown is a lush inside look at the lives of Queen Elizabeth and those closest to her, but how true are the scenes we're watching? Here are a few details that caught our eye, and a breakdown of how accurate they really are. Churchill's baths — The Crown (@TheCrownNetflix) November 4, 2016 \nIn one funny scene that would cause a massive sexual harassment lawsuit if it happened today, Prime Minister Winston Churchill demands his secretary read his mail to him while he is in the bath. This was not artistic license for effect: Writers for the show say they discovered the exact anecdote in a documentary about the famed leader. \nMore: Queen Elizabeth and her corgies outdid Kate Middleton's Vogue cover King George VI's operation \nIn a scene that made many a modern viewer shudder with thoughts of super germs, King George undergoes an operation to remove a lung not at a hospital, but in a state room at Buckingham Palace — complete with giant crystal chandeliers. This was not dramatic license. The king really did have this major surgery at the palace (although if they truly wrapped the offending organ in newspaper like a smoked fish is another story). The only part of the scene that did not quite happen is the family gathered together at the palace awaiting news. In reality, Elizabeth and Philip remained at Clarence House, Queen Mary at Marlborough House and Charles and Anne at Balmoral. The name game — The Crown (@TheCrownNetflix) October 26, 2016 \nWas the family's royal house name really such a big deal? In the series, Philip is depicted as angry and emasculated because Elizabeth was talked into retaining the House of Windsor instead of his family name, Mountbatten (which was actually a brand-new name upon being granted British citizenship, replacing his much more German one). In real life people close to the couple, including the Prime Minister, have said it was a source of major martial discord. \"I am the only man in the country not allowed to give his name to his children. I'm nothing but a bloody amoeba,\" Philip is said to have complained to friends. In fact, it bothered him so much that a full eight years later, when she was pregnant with Prince Andrew, Elizabeth again raised the issue with her advisors. Eventually it was decided that the royals would retain the name Windsor, but any descendants not carrying the title \"royal highness\" would carry the surname Mountbatten-Windsor.",

Will Handler leave the country and move to Spain like she had planned? Or will she stay and use her platform as a voice for women?\nNo excuses #GoVote #Vote #LetsDoThis \nA photo posted by Chelsea Handler (@chelseahandler) on Nov 8, 2016 at 10:48am PST \n\nChelsea Handler hosted an episode of Chelsea without her usual spunk.\nObviously the result is not what I was hoping for.\nLike a lot of people in this country, I’m sad, I’m disappointed and I’m confused. But if Hillary [Clinton] can make it through a concession speech, then I can make it through a stupid television show.”\nChelsea’s guest was Senator Barbara Boxer, who also got choked up over the Trump win.\nChelsea Handler had been advocating for Hillary Clinton this election season and was extremely disappointed with the results according to The Hollywood Reporter. \n“I guess the message that I want to spread out to other women is exactly what you’re saying, is not to give up. Sorry, I hate f**king crying on camera.\nIt’s so easy to say throw in the towel and that we’re going to leave or I’m going to move to Spain, because I want to move to Spain. I really, really want to move to Spain right now.”\nBefore Trump had won the election, Chelsea Handler had repeatedly talked about moving to her house in Spain if he became president. Will she actually go through with it now that Donald Trump is the President of the United States?\nMe and my yaya @marycmccormack spending the day helping get our girl elected. It feels good. \nA photo posted by Chelsea Handler (@chelseahandler) on Nov 5, 2016 at 2:47pm PDT \n\n“I did buy a house in another country just in case, so all of these people that threaten to leave the country and then don’t — I will leave the country,”\nHowever her coworkers at Chelsea don’t want to see her go.\n“Everyone in my office is like, ‘You have a responsibility, you have a voice and you need to use it, and you have to be here.'”\nBoxer shared Handler’s disappointment and admitted that her “heart is on the floor.”\n“It’s not where you are when you’re high and doing great; it’s when you fall down.\nA lot of us are on the ground right now.”\nBoxer also pointed out that Hillary Clinton won the popular vote nationally, but lost the Electoral College vote. She also goes into the complexity of the Electoral College and how difficult it would be to change the Constitution.\nRELATED POSTS BY THE INQUISITR \n‘What Is The Electoral College?’ Google Search Spikes: Is Donald Trump Presidency Causing Americans To Get More Informed? \nDonald Trump’s Son Eric Tweets, Then Deletes Illegal Photograph Of Voting Ballot \nVoting Is A ‘Flawed Process’ Open To Fraud: Officials Worried About 2016 Presidential Election \nPeople Are Googling ‘What Does Trump Pence Mean’: Why Are There So Many Uninformed Voters? \nWill Chelsea Handler go through with her plans to move to Spain after Donald Trump was elected as the President of the United States? Or will she stay and continue to speak out against Trump.\n“When you say, ‘I want to leave. I want to go,’ of course — it’s the flight syndrome.”\n“That’s just what the people who gave this hateful message want us to do, and we’re not going to do it.”\nChelsea Handler also took to Instagram to share a personal message and a further explanation.\nA video posted by Chelsea Handler (@chelseahandler) on Nov 10, 2016 at 7:35am PST \n\nShe also posted a quote from Hillary Clinton’s concession speech on Wednesday.\n“Please never stop believing that fighting for what’s right is worth it. It is, it is worth it.\nAnd so we need – we need you to keep up these fights now and for the rest of your lives.”\nIt looks like Handler will continue fighting in honor of Hillary Clinton.\n[Featured Image by Frederick M.

      "text": "The Netflix movie “True Memoirs of an International Assassin,” starring Kevin James, would have probably been in and out of theaters fairly quickly, but it might do as something light to stream on Friday night if you are not too demanding.\nThe premise revolves a wanna-be writer and full-time accountant Sam Larson (James), who is mostly tied to his cubicle. The rest of the time he sits at home, dreaming up spy novels, but only has a drawer filled with rejections slips for his efforts.\nHis research consists mostly of hanging out at a pool hall with a former Mossad agent (Ron Rifkin), who claims he was only an analyst.\nOne day he tells him about a legendary operative known as the Ghost. Sam puts it in a book called “Memoirs of an International Assassin” and quickly draws interest from an online publisher (Kelen Coleman). She tells him she won’t change a word, but adds one at the beginning — “True.”\nThe book unexpectedly sells, and Sam is interviewed by Katie Couric, who believes he is the real Ghost. The events in the book are so real that others believe it, too. Sam is then kidnapped, and the next thing he knows is caught up in a power struggle in Latin America.\nSuddenly, he has to figure out how to turn his imagination into something than can save his life. Turns out some his other research comes in handy.\n“True Memoirs” has something of a “Romancing the Stone” element — with the fanciful Sam being helped by a tough rogue DEA operative (Zulay Henao) in a gender reversal — but none of the charm.\nJames is fine as the Everyman who must rise to the occasion. Otherwise, the film from director and co-writer Jeff Wadlow (“Kick-Ass 2”) has an all-too-familiar ring to it, jumping between being silly and occasionally taking itself too seriously, which drags it down.",

That's right - you get a pair of wireless headphones and an overhead iPad, and they play whatever you want! Or if you just want to listen to music, they'll do that for you too. Aside from the awesomeness that I described above, Dr. Nguyen and her staff are the friendliest dentist office I've ever been to. They'll go to the extra mile to make sure all your questions are answered whether your asking about your teeth or insurance. I literally asked like 10 questions during my visit, and they answered each one without making me feel rushed. As long as I live in New York, I'm never switching dentists again. June 23, 2016",

Make sure to set aside time for a good ol’ Netflix binge and plenty of junk food. \n2. Treat yo’ self to Dairy Store ice cream. \nDairy store ice cream makes everything better, especially during finals week. \n3. Christmas decorations! \nIt’s not hard to get into the Christmas spirit, so get a tree with your roomie, hang up some colorful string lights and allow yourself to be soothed by the comfort of your room. \n4. Get a good work-out in. \nExercise releases endorphins, which will put you in a better mood. So if you’re feeling stressed out, make sure to go for a jog to work off all of the stress. \n5. Sleep, sleep and more sleep. \nLike you really need an excuse to sleep? Seriously though, sleep is good for you. Please make sure you rest up for your exams. \n6. Find your perfect study spot. \nNothing beats that place where you feel perfectly relaxed and focused at the same time. \n7.

      "text": "Black Mirror was released on Netflix a couple weeks ago and like many people my girlfriend and I promptly binged it.\nI had been recommended the series within days of it being released. With little details other than 'This series Black Mirror is really good' I went to town. And with almost zero expectations going I came out a much worse person. Not because of the dark, twisted worlds I had been exposed to, or the dark themes the series deals with but more because after the first two episodes I spent the rest trying to figure out the twist.\nThat's what's wrong. The series quickly defines itself on the cautionary perspectives of its narrative devices. The title even makes reference to it; Black Mirror being a dark reflection of the world. And it is this conceit that plays both for and against Black Mirror, because when there is a twist I am always left with an idea that has crawled inside my brain and when there isn't a twist I am left unfulfilled as if I hadn't quite seen what the world presented had to offer.\nNow, I watched the Twilight Zone a few years ago but as a show that became so ingrained in pop culture because of its twist like Black Mirror, yet it never had the \"narrative expectation\" destruction on my brain that Black Mirror did.\nAnd, that could be because of its size. The Twilight Zone mostly ran around 25 minutes whereas Black Mirror runs between 49 to 89 minutes. Black Mirror episodes are long, sometimes justifiably, like 'Shut up and Dance' which puts you on the edge of your seat and keeps you there for the entire length of the episode. Sometimes the episodes can drag on to never get anywhere, such as 'The National Anthem', it feels like I am trapped (not in the thrilling way) in the world. As a viewer you're forced to stew in these worlds, and in some cases it just isn't necessary. So when I feel captive in a world that fails to have an accessible conceit I spend the entire time trying to figure out the twist as if it will deliver some kind of payoff that'll redeem that last hour of story.\nIt's a trap I have fallen into but I admire that Charlie Brooker, as creator of the show has not fallen into the same trap I have. It shows as the creative force behind Black Mirror, that he cares about the people and characters (even though the dialogue can fall a little flat at times) more than impressing his audience with cheap thrills - something other creatives such as M. Knight Shyamalan failed to do.\nCharlie Brooker envisions a world and plays with its concepts without compromising his story and I definitely admire that even if I can find some episodes a bit hit and miss.\nI hope that it can continue to become stronger because it is a great show even if my mind is bent on ruining it for me, I mean, I could always not binge it instead.\nNah.",

      "text": "MORE >> \nWith exactly two weeks until Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life is released on Netflix, everyone’s patience is wearing a little thin. \nBut if you can’t wait another 14 days for your GG fix, fear not, because Alexis Bledel aka Rory, just revealed a major spoiler that should hold you until you can spend all of November 25th binge watching. Bledel opened up to Us Weekly about working with her various costars, including those who’ve played her love interests over the years. 10 Photos » \nWhen asked what it was like to work with Jared Padalecki , who played Rory’s first boyfriend Dean she said, “It was great working with him again. He’s always so affable and friendly, and he’s got this great energy.” \nBledel then casually dropped a major spoiler about their relationship, “Our scene was so fun to film. It was great to work with him again.” The actress quickly recognized she’d accidently revealed Rory and Dean only have one scene together, effectively squashing any hope for the Rory and Dean shippers. “I guess I just said that,” she continued, “So oops!”",

Tweet Supernatural Season 12 on Netflix - Copyright The CW \nLooking for season 12 of Supernatural on Netflix? Then look no further as we’ve got all the release information for when season 12 of The CW’s Supernatural will be coming to Netflix, and it’s much sooner than previous years. \nThe CW catalog on Netflix is quite impressive, stretching back many years and Supernatural has been on Netflix as far as my memory stretches back and has been extremely popular alongside the other CW shows similar to it including The Vampire Diaries and The Originals. The show has been airing on The CW since 2005. \nNever seen Supernatural before? Then you’re in for a treat. The Supernatural show by name and by nature pits two brothers picking up the work that their father started by hunting down all things paranormal. Whether it’s vampires, werewolves, ghouls or anything else these brothers are coming for you. \nSeason 12 of the show has a lot of fans questioning how much longer the series has left with it soon surpassing 250 episodes. It’s story however, are still as captivating as ever with our heroes getting into deeper and more complex storylines. \nLet’s get onto whether or not it’ll be on Netflix and depending on that answer; we’ll then determine when Supernatural season 12 will be on Netflix. \nThe status of most CW shows was up in the air over the summer as rumors of The CW removing all of its content was on the table. It turns out though that Netflix renewed the contract but not only that, it actually improved the terms. \nUsually, we’d expect new seasons of Supernatural to land on Netflix each October as it’s down for the past three years in a row but the new deal we just mentioned will be bringing the series to Netflix much faster this period with it arriving as soon as eight days as the series wraps up on The CW. This means, given how the show is on the same air schedule as last year, that we’ll probably see season 12 of Supernatural be on Netflix in May/June 2017 . \nAre you excited for Supernatural coming to Netflix earlier than normal? Let us know in the comments.  ",

      "text": "Like Us On Facebook Like Us On Facebook \nA double murder, a bath together, sex, Netflix and chill — all of that was one night’s work for two recently convicted teens. \nNow, those same teens will do the time for their crime after a British court sentenced the pair of 15 year olds to a minimum of 20 years in detention, The Guardian reports . \nTheir names have not been disclosed (for legal reasons, reportedly), but the story of their crime appears well-known across the pond. Two 15-year-olds given life sentences with minimum terms of 20 years for murders of Elizabeth and Katie Edwards in Spalding in Lincolnshire \n— Sky News Newsdesk (@SkyNewsBreak) November 10, 2016 \nThe details go a little something like this. \nOn April 13, a boy and girl (then 14 years old) killed 49-year-old Elizabeth Edwards and her 13-year-old daughter Katie while they slept at their own home in the English town of Spalding. \nThe murderers’ method? Stabbing and suffocating the two women to death. \nAfter committing their double murder, the two teens engaged in a strange series of follow up events, according to The Guardian. \nFirst, they shared a bath. Then, they had sex with each other. After that, they watched multiple “Twilight” movies. Sky News \nIf that sounds like a heartless pair of teens, well, there’s someone who agrees: the presiding judge in this case. \nHe said, \nBoth of you are perfectly intelligent and knew exactly what you were doing – either of you could have backed out at any time but you were selfishly determined to do it together. \nThe Guardian reports the jury heard that the two teens discussed their murder plot over burgers at McDonald’s. \nThe motive? The young girl had beef with Elizabeth Edwards, who worked as a lunch lady at their school. \nThe couple had also reportedly planned to make their killings a murder-suicide but, according to the judge, the girl changed her mind and they decided to watch a movie instead. \nThe story is simply mind-blowing, as Martin Holvey of the East Midlands told The Guardian. He said, \nThis has been a rare and unprecedented case and everybody who has listened to the details as they have emerged throughout the trial will, I am sure, have felt the same sense of shock and disbelief. \nYup, shock and disbelief just about sums it up. \nSubscribe to Elite Daily's official newsletter, The Edge , for more stories you don't want to miss.",

      "text": "Will there be a second season of The Crown on Netflix? Will Claire Foy and Matt Smith's royal Netflix drama be back?   Sarah Doran Friday 11 November 2016 at 3:40PM \nNetflix drama The Crown only covers the first few years of Queen Elizabeth II's (Claire Foy) reign so surely there's room for a second series? \nThe good news is, YES, there is indeed. A second series is already on order at Netflix, and is already in pre-production. Will Claire Foy and Matt Smith be back for a second series of The Crown? \nThey've confirmed that they won't play The Queen and Prince Philip forever, but Foy and Smith can confirm they'll be back for series 2. \nIn fact, they're already in rehearsals for another 8 month shoot - at least that's what they told RadioTimes.com at a recent Netflix event in New York. How many episodes will there be in The Crown series 2? \nProducer Andrew Eaton says we can probably look forward to another 10 episodes of royal drama from Peter Morgan's pen. When will The Crown be back for series 2? \nA launch date on Netflix has yet to be confirmed but watch this space - we'll keep you posted. \nThe Crown is available to stream on Netflix now",

      "text": "Want to watch Netflix offline on an iphone? Now you can - for $1 per episode or movie By Reuters Media Today at 2:45 p.m. The Netflix sign on is shown on an iPad in Encinitas, California, April 19, 2013. REUTERS/Mike Blake/File Photo \nLOS ANGELES - Netflix customers have been asking for a way to watch the streamer's content in offline mode for years. \nNow a third-party service, PlayOn Cloud, is letting subscribers of Netflix—as well as HBO Now, Hulu and others—download TV shows and movies to watch them offline on an iPhone, iPad, PC or Mac. \nThe catch: Users of PlayOn Cloud must pay 99 cents for each episode or movie title they want to watch offline. In other words, downloading, say, the eight episodes of \"Stranger Things\" season 1 for offline viewing via PlayOn Cloud will cost nearly as much as the standard monthly price of Netflix's streaming service. Moreover, the recordings are available for only 30 days. In short: not really a great deal. \nNetflix execs have floated the idea of providing built-in offline viewing. But at first, the company is targeting the feature for countries with poor broadband connectivity, chief content officer Ted Sarandos said last week in a CNBC interview. (Netflix didn't respond to a request for comment on the PlayOn Cloud launch.) \nIt's worth noting that Amazon Prime Video has offered offline viewing to members, on both iOS and Android apps, for more than a year. YouTube Red subscribers also have access to videos in offline mode. \nThe PlayOn Cloud iOS app, launched this week, initially will be able to record content from 12 services: Netflix, Amazon Video, Hulu, Yahoo View, HBO Now, YouTube, NBC, ABC, CBS, Fox, PBS and the CW. Users must enter their login credentials for each service in the app. \nWhen a user sets a show to record, the PlayOn service creates a copy and keeps it on its servers for 30 days; customers can download the recording to their mobile device or computer to watch later when they are disconnected from the internet. The app also includes ad-skipping feature to automatically bypass commercials. \nAs a sign-up promo, PlayOn is offering five free recording credits to users who download the app and create a valid account by Sunday, Nov. 13, at 10:59 p.m. \nNew York-based MediaMall Technologies, the company that operates PlayOn Cloud, also offers a service called PlayOn Plus, which uses a Windows PC to store local copies of online video from about 100 services like Netflix, HBO Now and Hulu, and play them back on a range of connected devices. PlayOn Plus is available for $30 per year or a one-time fee of $69.99.",

      "text": "Want to watch Netflix offline on an iphone? Now you can - for $1 per episode or movie By Reuters Media Today at 2:45 p.m. The Netflix sign on is shown on an iPad in Encinitas, California, April 19, 2013. REUTERS/Mike Blake/File Photo \nLOS ANGELES - Netflix customers have been asking for a way to watch the streamer's content in offline mode for years. \nNow a third-party service, PlayOn Cloud, is letting subscribers of Netflix—as well as HBO Now, Hulu and others—download TV shows and movies to watch them offline on an iPhone, iPad, PC or Mac. \nThe catch: Users of PlayOn Cloud must pay 99 cents for each episode or movie title they want to watch offline. In other words, downloading, say, the eight episodes of \"Stranger Things\" season 1 for offline viewing via PlayOn Cloud will cost nearly as much as the standard monthly price of Netflix's streaming service. Moreover, the recordings are available for only 30 days. In short: not really a great deal. \nNetflix execs have floated the idea of providing built-in offline viewing. But at first, the company is targeting the feature for countries with poor broadband connectivity, chief content officer Ted Sarandos said last week in a CNBC interview. (Netflix didn't respond to a request for comment on the PlayOn Cloud launch.) \nIt's worth noting that Amazon Prime Video has offered offline viewing to members, on both iOS and Android apps, for more than a year. YouTube Red subscribers also have access to videos in offline mode. \nThe PlayOn Cloud iOS app, launched this week, initially will be able to record content from 12 services: Netflix, Amazon Video, Hulu, Yahoo View, HBO Now, YouTube, NBC, ABC, CBS, Fox, PBS and the CW. Users must enter their login credentials for each service in the app. \nWhen a user sets a show to record, the PlayOn service creates a copy and keeps it on its servers for 30 days; customers can download the recording to their mobile device or computer to watch later when they are disconnected from the internet. The app also includes ad-skipping feature to automatically bypass commercials. \nAs a sign-up promo, PlayOn is offering five free recording credits to users who download the app and create a valid account by Sunday, Nov. 13, at 10:59 p.m. \nNew York-based MediaMall Technologies, the company that operates PlayOn Cloud, also offers a service called PlayOn Plus, which uses a Windows PC to store local copies of online video from about 100 services like Netflix, HBO Now and Hulu, and play them back on a range of connected devices. PlayOn Plus is available for $30 per year or a one-time fee of $69.99.",

      "text": "Marvel’s Daredevil was the first original series to come to Netflix after the streaming platform and the comic book company came to a huge distribution deal back in 2013. Since its massive success, a second season was spawned alongside Jessica Jones and Luke Cage ; with the fourth Marvel/Netflix series, Iron Fist coming to Netflix in March 2017.\nHaving acquired a sizable fanbase over the past three years, these shows have continued to shock and surprise with their developments, twists and turns. Now actor Charlie Cox, who plays Matt Murdock a.k.a. the lead in Daredevil , has talked a little bit about how no character is safe in the world of Marvel TV.\nSpeaking to fans at this weekend’s Wizard World in Pittsburgh (via Screen Geek ), Cox explained that nobody in the Marvel Cinematic Universe is guaranteed a lengthy future, no matter their path in the comic books:\n“I know that as a show, they don’t try to take storylines that are already written. We want to be our own thing. One of the reasons they killed Ben Urich, which was such a great shock for me, but the reason I think they do it because the people who love the show are great fans and have read the comics and we need them to know this is not a safe place and the drama is going to affect you as well. You don’t know what’s going to happen. If we kill Ben Ulrich, what does that mean? We could do anything potentially.”\nCharacters from all four Marvel/Netflix series will be coming together next year in the crossover miniseries, The Defenders . Based on Cox’s warning, there’s a real risk that certain supporting players will be meeting their end in The Defenders . Of course, both Daredevil season 3 and Jessica Jones season 2 have been confirmed, so it’s safe to say that Cox’s character and Krysten Ritter’s Jessica Jones (along with the other leads) will be making it out alive.\nMoving away from source material is always a risk. Comic book purists exist in their droves and may not be happy with the way in which creators take the series. Having built such a steady and loyal fan base, it would be sad to see many slip away because of unexpected developments.\nFor many though it will be nice to see something new. Knowing exactly what’s around every corner could mean the show turns into a slog with zero surprises and no pulling power to entice viewers in-the-know to keep coming back. Other shows have maintained success by doing this sort of thing, including AMC’s The Walking Dead and HBO fantasy series Game of Thrones .\nDaredevil seasons 1 and 2, Jessica Jones season 1, and Luke Cage season 1 are now available on Netflix. Iron Fist will premiere on March 17, 2017. The Defenders and The Punisher will arrive in 2017. Premiere dates for the newest seasons of Jessica Jones and Daredevil have not yet been announced.\nSource: Screen Geek",

      "text": "LONDON — Move aside Lady Mary, the leading lady on everyone's lips right now is Queen Elizabeth II.\nThe nation watched Her Majesty celebrate her 90th birthday this year, but now the world is getting a glimpse into the early days of HRH's reign with the release of Netflix's transfixing new show The Crown .\nSEE ALSO: 'The Crown' could well cure your 'Downton Abbey' nostalgia\nThe famously private royal family has always endeavoured, successfully or not, to keep its family squabbles and intrigues out of the spotlight. But with a family as well known as the royals and a public thirsty for gossip, rumours abound about what really went on behind closed doors at the palace.\nRight now, The Crown is giving us the through-the-keyhole view of the royals we've been yearning for. And naturally the question on everyone's lips is: Did all of that really happen?\nDid King George IV really tell dirty limericks? In the preimere episode of The Crown we see King George VI being dressed in his royal garb before his daughter's wedding. As his valet struggles to adjust the king's collar, His Majesty appears irked shortly before losing his temper entirely, shouting \"Oh for Christ's sake, James!\"\nAs if that wasn't startling enough, King George then proceeds to recount a vulgar limerick. \"There was an old countess of Bray, and you may think it odd when I say that despite her high station, rank and education she always spelled cunt with a k.\"\nAnd, there we all were naively thinking that the royals were frightfully polite and not at all vulgar.\nAccording to royal historian Carolyn Harris, George VI occasionally used coarse language and did lose his temper.\n\"In private, George VI sometimes swore and could be short-tempered, traits that also appeared in the depiction of the king in the 2010 film The King's Speech,\" Harris told Mashable .\nThe limerick told by George VI in episode one is not necessarily one he might have told, however. According to The Guardian , this particular limerick was put forth in emails exchanged between director Stephen Daldry and the production team.\nWas Elizabeth and Philip's relationship really under strain?\nAccording to Harris, The Crown accurately portrays the impact Elizabeth II's accession has on the Duke of Edinburgh's family life and career.\n\"He gave up a promising naval career to support the Queen in her role and the family moved into Buckingham Palace,\" says Harris.\nMay 15, 1954: Prince Charles and Princess Anne with their parents, Queen Elizabeth II and Duke of Edinburgh, on the balcony of Buckingham Palace following their return from the Commonwealth tour.\nImage: PA, File via AP\nThe royal house remained the House of Windsor, meaning the children of Queen Elizabeth and the Duke of Edinburgh all took their mother's family name rather than Philip's family name, Mountbatten.\nAccording to royal biographer Gyles Brandreth, Prince Philip privately complained: \"I am nothing but a bloody amoeba. I am the only man in the country not allowed to give his name to his own children.\"\nDid an Australian film crew really witness them arguing?\nIn episode eight of The Crown, we witness The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh embark on a royal expedition. Tensions run high between the royal couple during an eight-week royal tour of Australia.\nOne scene depicts The Queen and Prince Philip embroiled in a rather ferocious fracas in which she chases him out of the chalet where they've been staying and hurls a tennis racquet at him.\nOh, and all this just so happened to be captured by an Australian TV crew.\nAccording to the royal biography Our Queen , the event depicted in The Crown wasn't far from reality.\nThe Queen and Prince Philip were spending the weekend at the O'Shannassy reservoir in the Yarra Ranges of Victoria. An exasperated film crew was waiting on the grounds.\n\"The second cameraman, Frank Bagnall, instinctively turned on his camera when he saw the front door open and so captured the memorable marital moment,\" according to the Sydney Morning Herald .\nThe Queen reappeared soon after to apologise for the \"little interlude\", explaining that \"it happens in every marriage\", and the film crew destroyed the footage so as not to breach the strict rules enforced by the royal press secretary.\nWas the Great Smog of 1952 really that bad?\nIn episode four, an almighty fog descends on London. In the show, the fog is portrayed as an immediate emergency and constitutional crisis.\nPeople did die as a result of the fog, but the sense of urgency depicted on screen doesn't quite match up to reality.\n\"There was no sense of drama or emergency,\" Dr. David V. Bates, who was working at a London hospital at the time, told the New York Times .\n\"It was only when the registrar general published the mortality figures three weeks later that everybody realised that there had, in fact, been a major disaster,\" Bates continued.\nDid Winston Churchill's secretary die?\nEpisode four also features a dramatic death. Winston Churchill's secretary Venetia Scott gets fatally hit by a bus after stepping out in the fog.\nImage: netflix\nPoor Venetia never existed in real life. Indeed, both her life and death are a work of fiction, and her character is actually based on a number of different members of the prime minister's staff.\nDid the Queen really take advice from King Edward VIII?\nAccording to Harris, the series accurately demonstrates \"the strain of the position and dramatic change in King George VI's life created by the Abdication Crisis of 1936\". King George VI was thrust into a role he never wanted following his brother King Edward VIII's decision to abdicate in order to marry the twice-divorced American socialite Wallis Simpson .\nThe Crown shows Queen Elizabeth turning to her uncle for advice on aspects of her reign after George VI's death.\n\"It's unlikely that the Queen would have turned to the former King Edward VIII for counsel on her role as monarch,\" says Harris.\nDid Princess Margaret have a relationship with Peter Townsend?\nIn a word, yes.\nBy 1953 Group Captain Peter Townsend had divorced his first wife and proposed to Princess Margaret, who, at 22, was 16 years his junior.\nMargaret accepted his proposal but required the permission of her sister due to the Royal Marriages Act 1772 .\nPeter Townsend pictured with Princess Margaret.\nImage: DALMAS/SIPA\nThis placed the Queen in something of a predicament. King Edward VIII's desire to marry a divorcée was opposed by the government . As a British monarch, Edward was the nominal head of the Church of England, which at the time did not permit divorced people to remarry in church if their ex-spouses were still living.\nAfter seeking advice, the Queen asked her sister to wait until she was 25 when she would no longer required the monarch's permission. Winston Churchill arranged for Townsend to be posted to Brussels. Eventually, Margaret chose not to marry Townsend and released a public statement stating her duty to the Commonwealth and the Church's teachings about marriage as reasons for her decision.\nAnd, the rest, as they say, is history.",

      "text": "Tweet Orphan Black - Copyright BBC America \nThe popular BBC America series Orphan Black is heading into its final season in 2017 and will end after the fifth season. In many Netflix regions, you’re able to watch the show exclusively with weekly drops. As for everyone else, let’s see whether or not Orphan Black is streaming in your region. \nThe series which sees Tatiana Maslany portraying multiple very different roles all of which who are clones is truly groundbreaking, and that makes it one of the best sci-fi shows airing right now. It tells the story of a company that made clones several decades ago and their mission to monitor the clones. The main character in the series is Sarah Manning who found herself mixed up in the world of clones after assuming the identity of Beth Childs – another clone. \nIt’s a personal favorite of mine and each episode ends up leaving you with more questions than answers but that’s just part of the shows nature and I’ll be sad to see it finish next year. \nThe series is created in partnership with the Canadian channel Space and US network called BBC America. This pretty much is the reason why those in the US and Canada aren’t able to stream on Netflix. Elsewhere, though, Netflix has managed to secure the rights to the show and market them as Netflix Originals. \nFor places like the UK, we’ve seen weekly episodes come to Netflix just after they’ve aired in their country of origin. We saw this first with season 3 and will likely carry onto the final episode of season 5. \nThe show after it’s finished then has an opportunity to come to Netflix although it’s not one we think they’ll take. BBC America has actually pulled more shows recently than added to Netflix including the likes of Doctor Who which made the jump to Amazon Prime. \nDon’t despair completely, though, Netflix’s talk show Chelsea had Tatiana in for an entire episode back in July .

      "text": "Marvel Has a Plan in the Works For New Ghost Rider Franchise Could it be a movie? Could it be Netflix? by Carly Lane | 8:00 pm, November 12th, 2016 \nOne of the highlights for many fans of Agents of SHIELD has unquestionably been Gabriel Luna as Robbie Reyes, a.k.a. Ghost Rider . After a not-so-great first outing in a film adaptation and its sequel (where the Johnny Blaze incarnation of the character was played by Nicolas Cage), the popularity of the character on Agents of SHIELD has led many fans to begin clamoring for Ghost Rider to take on another adaptation. \nAlthough some are saying it’s time for a new movie, others are suggesting the possibility of Marvel adding another show to the growing number it already has on Netflix. In addition to the four main Defenders who will be teaming up for their overall series, the franchise has already stretched past its original intention by adding a spinoff show for The Punisher after the character proved to be a major draw in season two of Daredevil . \nTaking all that into consideration, could a Netflix show be the next logical step for Ghost Rider? In an interview with ComicBook.com , Luna shared the news that something already appears to be brewing: \nIt’s been talked about, there’s definitely deals in place for that potential. But I just take it one day at a time. I have so much fun now I just want to make sure I get these episodes right. If they throw more episodes on my plate, I will do my best to do well with those stories as well. \nSounds like Luna is happy to play the character as long as he’s permitted to, but he’s definitely not objecting to taking on more. How about you? Would you be open to seeing Netflix’s Ghost Rider ? \nFollow The Mary Sue on Twitter , Facebook , Tumblr , Pinterest , & Google+ . Follow The Mary Sue",

      "text": "• With a revival hitting Netflix soon, here's a trip down Gilmore Girls memory lane. • Here are the best Gilmore Girls episodes from every season of the show. \n\n\\In its original run on the WB (and the CW for its last season), Gilmore Girls ran for seven seasons, each including 20-plus episodes. That is a lot of Gilmore Girls ! It's particularly a lot if you haven't watched but you want to catch up before the Netflix revival Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life hits the streaming service. \nWhat is a would-be Gilmore Girls fan to do if they want to relive the magic but can't commit the next two weeks of their lives to doing it? We've got a solution for you to catch up with mom Lorelai Gilmore, daughter Rory and their band of pals in the Connecticut town of Stars Hollow. \nWe've reduced the 153-episode series to just 44 episodes — basically two seasons of TV. That's nothing! That's one weekend of binging, plus a few weeknights. It's easily doable before Nov. 25. \nHere's our breakdown of which episodes to watch and why. Season one Warner Bros \nStart with the pilot , because it sets up the series' core relationships well: Lorelai and Rory, their friends Sookie, Luke, Lane and Michel, etc. Then skip to \"Rory's Dance\" and \"Forgiveness and Stuff,\" which work as a two-parter. Those nicely set up Dean as Rory's new boyfriend, as well as further establish the dynamic between Lorelai and her parents, Emily and Richard. \nThen skip to \"Christopher Returns,\" which introduces Rory's father, Christopher. You can actually skip the rest of this season and the beginning of the next — it's mostly about Lorelai's relationship with Max Medina, a character who isn't returning for the revival. Plus, Rory and Dean break up, but they quickly get back together. Season two Warner Bros \nAfter skipping the first few episodes of the new season, pick up with \"Nick & Nora/Sid & Nancy,\" which introduces vital new character Jess. Then jump to \"The Ins and Outs of Inns,\" which introduces a major story that picks up in season four. \"Richard in Stars Hollow\" isn't a deeply necessary episode, but considering Richard's memory is going to play into a lot of A Year in the Life after actor Edward Herrmann's death, it's good to get to know him more. \n\"It Should've Been Lorelai\" comes next, giving more context to Christopher and Lorelai's relationship. Follow up with a triple play: \"Teach Me Tonight,\" \"Help Wanted\" and \"I Can't Get Started.\" It's a tall order to watch three in a row, but there's a continuous story that involves Rory, Jess, Luke and Lorelai that threads these episodes together. (Skip \"Lorelai's Graduation Day,\" which is a sweet but ultimately frustrating installment.) Season three Warner Bros \nWatching the premiere, \"Those Lazy-Hazy-Crazy Days,\" is necessary, as it sets the table for the rest of the season. Then skip to \"They Shoot Gilmores, Don't They?\" — which changes the landscape of the series pretty dramatically — followed by flashback episode \"Dear Emily and Richard.\" That one is particularly important: It serves as Lorelai Gilmore's origin story. \n\"The Big One\" and \"Keg! Max!\" aren't a two-parter, but they do work well together. Unfortunately, they both involve Max Medina, but Rory's stories are vital. Wrap it up with the finale, \"Those Are Strings, Pinocchio,\" in which Rory graduates and the two Gilmore girls decide their future. Season four Warner Bros \nThe premiere is a fun but kind of pointless installment, so skip to \"The Lorelais' First Day at Yale\" instead. (The title is both a spoiler and very indicative of the episode itself.) We skipped a couple of important Dean episodes in season three, so watch \"Chicken or Beef?\" to get caught up on what's happening with him. \nNow, the rest of the season is pretty vital, so bear with us. Start with \"A Family Matter\" and \"Nag Hammadi Is Where They Found the Gnostic Gospels,\" which bring back Jess for a two-episode arc. Then jump to \"Luke Can See Her Face\" and \"Last Week Fights, This Week Tights\" — again, Jess episodes, but they also have major Lorelai developments. \nThe season four finale, \"Raincoats and Recipes,\" is indeed required viewing, but we'd recommend watching it at the same time as the season five premiere. Season five Warner Bros \nPair the season four finale with \"Say Goodbye to Daisy Miller\" and \"A Messenger, Nothing More.\" Those three episodes feature perhaps the most significant change to Lorelai and Rory's relationship, one the show never really reverts. They also include Lorelai opening a new business and starting a new potential relationship, a change in Richard and Emily's dynamic and more. \n\"You Jump, I Jump, Jack\" and \"The Party's Over\" serve as a two-part exit for Rory's love interest and an introduction to Logan, Rory's third and final boyfriend. \"Come Home\" and \"Wedding Bell Blues\" make for a good Emily- and Richard-heavy night of Gilmore . \"So... Good Talk\" resolves the Lorelai story that starts in \"Wedding Bell Blues,\" so watch that quickly too. \n\"But I'm a Gilmore!\" is a good standalone to check in on Rory's progress as a character. It's needed for our final two episodes of the season, \"Blame Booze and Melville\" and \"A House Is Not a Home.\" Season six Warner Bros \nThe first half of season six is deeply unpleasant to watch. It's still Gilmore Girls , so it's still good, but the Lorelai-Rory dynamic is never worse than in these installments. Watch \"New and Improved Lorelai,\" then \"We've Got Magic To Do.\" Then jump to a double feature of \"Let Me Hear Your Balalaikas Ringing Out\" and \"The Prodigal Daughter Returns\" to put the difficult plot to bed. \nTo avoid spoiling you, we'll just say of the rest of the season that \"Friday Night's Alright for Fighting\" is one of the best episodes of the series, and a crucial one. \"You've Been Gilmored\" is a good episode to pair it with, if you're in the mood for two. Jump then to \"Driving Miss Gilmore,\" following it up with the season finale, \"Partings.\" Season seven The CW \nSeason seven was not written or produced by series creator Amy Sherman-Palladino, so take it with a grain of salt. She's returning for A Year in the Life and has never watched this season in full . It's likely to impact the new season very little. \nJump ahead to \"To Whom It May Concern.\" You'll be very confused by some stuff happening, but look up recaps online instead. We're down to the last few episodes here, and we need to make up time. \"I'd Rather Be in Philadelphia\" is the last plot-vital episode of the series, featuring one relationship dissolving and another major development for Richard. \nWrap it up with the series finale, \"Bon Voyage\" — and then bask in the glory of your triumph. Now, all there is to do is wait for A Year in the Life . Read the original article on Mic . Copyright 2016. Follow Mic on Twitter . More from Mic: ",

      "text": "Will there be a second season of The Crown on Netflix? Will Claire Foy and Matt Smith's royal Netflix drama be back? ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW \nBy Sarah Doran Sunday 13 November 2016 at 8:14AM \nNetflix drama The Crown only covers the first few years of Queen Elizabeth II's (Claire Foy) reign so surely there's room for a second series? \nThe good news is, YES, there is indeed. A second series is already on order at Netflix, and is already in pre-production. Will Claire Foy and Matt Smith be back for a second series of The Crown? \nThey've confirmed that they won't play The Queen and Prince Philip forever, but Foy and Smith can confirm they'll be back for series 2. \nIn fact, they're already in rehearsals for another 8 month shoot - at least that's what they told RadioTimes.com at a recent Netflix event in New York. How many episodes will there be in The Crown series 2? \nProducer Andrew Eaton says we can probably look forward to another 10 episodes of royal drama from Peter Morgan's pen. When will The Crown be back for series 2? \nA launch date on Netflix has yet to be confirmed but watch this space - we'll keep you posted. \nThe Crown is available to stream on Netflix now",

      "text": "What's on Netflix > News > Is Bones Leaving Netflix in December 2016? Is Bones Leaving Netflix in December 2016? Tweet \nBones according to some Netflix users looks like it may be departing Netflix in December 2016 but only some seasons are and on different dates. Below, we’ll take a look as to what’s going on, whether it will expire and will keep it updated as we learn more. \nWhat’s going on then? As of right now, a select few are having notifications pushed through to them if they have Bones in their queue list. It notes that different seasons of Bones are scheduled to leave Netflix in December 2016. \nBones is a crime drama produced by Fox and is about to go into its twelve season in January meaning the series is one of the longest running shows currently (excluding its animated selection) on Fox. \nHere’s what seasons are set to expire in addition to their dates: December 3rd – Bones – Season 5 (2009) December 7th – Bones – Season 7 (2011) December 9th – Bones – Season 6 (2010) What’s going on and will it expire? \nAt the moment it’s hard to know exactly what’s going on. In most cases, when shows leave Netflix they do so in their entirety on a select date. For some animated sitcoms, old seasons are taken off in place for a brand new season. Those that come to our website regularly will know that season 11 was only just recently added in September. \nAt this point, only some devices are reporting the show expiring with the main desktop website not showing an expiration date on the details page like it normally would. Therefore we’re going to call this a glitch for now but keep a close eye on it as we suspect more expiration dates may be added for the other seasons soon. \nFor the moment, keep an eye on this page as well as our official leaving soon list for December 2016 where we’ll update you with the latest as soon as we know it. \nAre you seeing Bones expiring on your Netflix?

      "text": "Chelsea Handler fought back tears several times during her Netflix talk show while discussing the outcome of Tuesday’s presidential election.\nThe host was emotional right from the top of her show.\n“Like a lot of people in this country, I’m sad. I’m disappointed, and I’m confused. But if Hillary [Clinton] can make it through a concession speech , then I can make it through a stupid television show,” Handler said.\nShe was later joined by Senator Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) who also expressed her disappointment over Donald Trump’s victory . “My heart’s on the floor,” Boxer said. “I have learned how painful politics can be. But that doesn’t mean you run away. It means you pick yourself up, as the president said, and you fight even harder for your country, because it’s ours. It’s ours.”\nWhen asked if she had spoken to Clinton since the results, Boxer said she hadn’t. “No, I did not want to speak to her at this point,” Boxer said. “I like to write,” she explained emotionally. “I have too much to say. I want to think about it.”\n“I know as a woman, it feels so sexist,” Handler responded, beginning to cry. “I guess the message that I want to spread out to other women is to not give up — sorry, I hate f–king crying on camera — because this is so important. It’s easy to throw in the towel and say that we’re gonna leave, or I’m gonna move to Spain. Because I want to move to Spain, I really, really want to move to Spain right now. And everyone in my office is like ‘you have a responsibility. You have a voice and you have to use it and you have to be here.'”\nHandler continued, “If you’re caught lying on camera three times in a row, if you’re referring to a woman’s genitalia. Those are non-presidential things …unpresidential things.”\nThe segment ended on a hopeful note, with Boxer praising the women who won Senate seats, including Kamala Harris, who is replacing her.\nHandler later reiterated her stance, posting another video on Instagram Thursday morning.\nInstagram Photo More\n“I’m not leaving the country, Handler said defiantly. “This is my announcement. I’m going to keep fighting. For Hillary Clinton. In honor of Hillary Clinton.”\nRelated stories\nShares of Tech Giants Fall on Renewed Fears of Trump Administration Policies\nLos Cabos: Rafael Ley Teams With Natalia Beristain, Matias Meyer, Manolo Caro, Others (EXCLUSIVE)\nNetflix Losing Food Network, HGTV, Travel Channel Shows at End of 2016\nGet more from Variety and Variety411 : Follow us on Twitter , Facebook , Newsletter",

      "text": "+ More Options Powered by \nIn the first episode following 9/11, Saturday Night Live didn’t bother trying to be funny right out of the gate, but instead asked Paul Simon to sing “The Boxer” as a tribute to New York’s first responders. \nUnderstanding the challenge of ushering in laughs related to this week’s election, the show took a similar approach, finding the perfect note for addressing the week while saluting a fallen icon in the process. \nThe cold open instead featured Kate McKinnon as Hillary Clinton, sitting at a piano, playing and singing “Hallelujah,” which was written by Leonard Cohen, who died this week at age 82 . RELATED: ALEC BALDWIN IS A NO SHOW AT ‘SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE’, BACKS DOWN FROM DONALD TRUMP \nGiven McKinnon’s deep well of talent, it’s little surprise she can sing and play piano as well. Hearing her, as Hillary, sing lines like, “I did my best, it wasn’t much,” and, “I’ve told the truth, I didn’t come to fool you,” resonated eerily with the circumstances. The song ends, “And even though it all went wrong/I’ll stand before the Lord of Song/With nothing on my tongue but Hallelujah.” McKinnon/Clinton turned to camera at song’s end and said, “I’m not giving up, and neither should you.” All in all, a fitting tribute to Cohen and Clinton, and a perfect elegy for what feels like the end of an era. \nBut the show wasn’t done wowing us with its reaction to the election. By perfect coincidence, Dave Chappelle was this week’s host, and given the election’s surprising results and an aftermath that has seen a rise in harassment and violent racially- and sexually-motivated attacks, the never-mincing-words Chappelle couldn’t have been a better choice. The end result was one of the best cold open/monologue combinations in the show’s history. \nIn his monologue, Chappelle talked about his lack of surprise at Trump’s victory, since, he says, “I know the whites,” and said that, “We elected an internet troll as our president.” He talked about the rash of shootings of black people in recent years and about Black Lives Matter, admitting it wasn’t the best slogan but saying that “You deserve a break today” was already taken. \nTalking about this week’s meeting at the White House between Trump and President Obama, he imagined Trump mentioning how hard the job looked, and Obama replying, “At least you get to be white while you’re doing it.” \nAfter praising Obama (possibly to repute reports from this week that had him insulting Obama and praising Trump), he took a semi-serious turn, mention that he’d been at a party at the White House just a few weeks ago. The party was sponsored by BET, so everyone there was black, “except for Bradley Cooper, for some reason.” He talked about the history of black people being allowed into the White House (hint: historically, it’s brief), and talked of how the event made him feel hopeful and proud to be an American. He ended by saying, “In that spirit, I’m wishing Donald Trump luck, and I’m gonna give him a chance, and we the historically disenfranchised demand that he give us one too.” \nThe first sketch depicted a group of friends, all white expect for Chappelle, watching Tuesday night’s election results come in. The sketch was another chance for Chappelle to express a stark lack of surprise at the depth of the country’s racism, in contrast to his white friends, who are stunned that the country would elect Trump in light of his comments on minorities. The sketch was a shot at short-sighted liberal platitudes, as when Beck Bennett, reacting to news that Trump won Kentucky, says, “Well of course he won Kentucky. I mean, that’s where all the racists are.” Chappelle’s eye roll quickly told us, no. They’re everywhere. \nChris Rock joined the sketch in the middle, and while the pace slackened – the hug he and Chappelle shared when he walked on stage seemed like a breaking of character, and the timing from here on felt like the pair just dropped into the Comedy Cellar for a loose set – the pair, as new state results came in, regarded their panicked white friends with almost joking disdain, mocking the naiveté of believing American citizens were too decent to elect Trump. As the realization kicks in, Cecily Strong says, “Oh my god. I think America is racist.” Chappelle answers, “Oh my god. You know, my great-grandfather told me something like that. But he was, like, a slave, so, I don’t know.” \nThe show took a break from politics for an all-Chappelle extravaganza, as he parodied the controversial season opener of The Walking Dead by playing Negan, the show’s vicious new villain, and replacing the show’s cast, as Negan’s victims, with characters from his late lamented Chappelle’s Show , including Lil Jon, crack addict Tyrone Biggums, his pimp from the “Playa Haters Ball,” and Clayton Bigsby, the black white-supremacist, now a Trump voter in a “Make America Great Again” cap. \nOn “Weekend Update,” co-hosts Colin Jost and Michael Che did what they’ve come to do, with each going into a series of short, loose, alternating monologues to start, commenting on the week’s events. While there were a few funny lines within – Che lead off by noting that Trump was elected President of the United States, then scoffed at the word “United”– the format fails to accomplish what it seems to be shooting for, which is adding an authoritative tone to the proceedings. \nStill, Jost had several solid lines, such as, over a photo of Obama and Trump shaking hands at the White House, “On Thursday, Trump went to the White House, and showed us how brave he is, by meeting face to face with the man who founded ISIS,” a reference to Trump’s accusation during the campaign that Obama founded ISIS. \nThe segment then found McKinnon returning as Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, lamenting how she can’t retire now that Trump’s been elected, and consuming Emergen-C by the bag load as she dispenses her trademark Ginsburns. “The [Supreme Court] bench is now my porch. I’m gonna sit on it all day and scream, ‘No. Get out of my yard!'” \nMcKinnon, who is gay, took special delight in razzing Vice President-elect Mike Pence, who believes in conversion therapy for homosexuals. Noting his resemblance to “the neighbor who kisses Kevin Spacey in American Beauty ,” she said, “Hey Mike Pence, sorry you looked at Magnum P.I. once and got a quarter chub and you’ve been haunted by it ever since. And that’s a gay Ginsburn.” She ended by noting that her burden could be lifted if Obama appointed Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court by recess appointment. \nThe next sketch was a fourth-wall breaker. At first, the sketch, about restaurant employees using too much hair spray, seemed like a disaster, with Leslie Jones failing miserably to find her cue cards in time. But the incompetence, it turned out, was intended, as the sketch broke in the middle for an “Inside SNL” segment, and the cast moved next door to a press conference where reporters quizzed them on why the sketch failed so terribly. It was a funny premise, with Jones saying, “Look, SNL knew what they was getting when they hired me,” and Chappelle commenting he hoped the wig he wore would make him the next David S. Pumpkins. Not a home run, but a funny diversion before sinking back into the election. \nThe next sketch showed Vanessa Bayer talking to children about politics (in a set-up resembling those of Beck Bennett’s pre- SNL AT&T commercials), asking what they knew about Donald Trump. The kids say things like “he’s funny,” and “he’s a bully,” until the scene cuts to a African-American girl who says, “He unleashed racism and xenophobia. We now return to dark ages of white presidents. Also, my dad said that Donald Trump will stop and frisk my cat. We have a black cat. His name’s Pussy.” It’s little surprise when we see that her father is Chappelle, who picks her up saying, “Sounds like someones dropping some truth.” The sketch fades out, leaving the phrase, “Our children are watching” against a black screen. \nThe last few sketches include the return of McKinnon’s “Last Call” sketch, with Chappelle as her barfly companion, including the requisite sloppy make-out as bartender Kenan Thompson washes his eyes out with bleach. Next comes a short film mockumentary about Leslie Jones having a backstage relationship with Kyle Mooney , who is a virgin here, with the entire cast and crew somehow involved. Even Lorne Michaels makes an appearance, saying, “I don’t usually get involved in cast relationships, but I think it’s important for Kyle to lose his virginity.” The night’s final sketch finds Chappelle hosting a guy’s football hang at his mother’s house, where it turns out he lives, and having his mother (Jones) breastfeed him . \nAll in all, at a bizarre and trying time, SNL came through. \nThe show returns next week with host Kristen Wiig, and musical guest The xx.

      "text": "print \n\"Making a Murderer\" subject Steven Avery. Netflix \n\"Making a Murderer\" subject Steven Avery's attorney Kathleen Zellner announced that they have just cleared a major legal hurdle in potentially proving his innocence. \nBack in August, Zellner filed a motion to carry out tests on the case evidence in Wisconsin. Now nearly three months later, the tests can finally move forward. \n\" Agreed Testing Order entered on Monday for Steven Avery,\" tweeted Zellner, who hopes that this closer look at the evidence will prove that at least some of it was planted . \nAgreed Testing Order entered on Monday for Steven Avery. #MakingAMurderer — Kathleen Zellner (@ZellnerLaw) November 12, 2016 \nAccording to Uproxx , that means the scope of Zellner's proposed testing has been decided. That requires an agreement between Avery's legal team and the prosecutors in Manitowoc, Wisconsin, where in 2007 Steven Avery was convicted of the murder of Teresa Halbach — a trial covered by Netflix's hit \"Making a Murderer.\" \nSpecifics on the tests will be revealed after Zellner files the order on Monday and it becomes available to the public. \nWhat we do know is that Zellner's original motion included requests to test the keys to victim Teresa Halbach's Toyota Rav4; various parts of the Rav4, including the hood latch where police found Avery's DNA; purple underwear discovered in the Avery scrap yard; and all previously collected swabs from the trial, including blood that Avery's lawyers have argued came from a vial of Avery's blood that was held by the police. \nAvery and his nephew, Brendan Dassey, were both found guilty of the 2005 murder of Halbach. A judge overturned Dassey's conviction in August , but Wisconsin prosecutors are fighting the decision .",

      "title": "How Lorelai And Emily's Relationship Will Change During The New Gilmore Girls Episodes",
      "text": "By jessica rawden 26 minutes ago \nGilmore Girls is coming to Netflix in just a couple of weeks, and if you'd like to go into the series with a fresh perspective, now is a great time to hop to another article! \nThroughout the history of Gilmore Girls , we've seen Lorelei and Emily Gilmore make some breakthroughs as they have both struggled to try and understand the lifestyles they've each chosen and the choices and sacrifices they've each made. However, by the end of the original WB/CW series, Emily and Lorelei were still not 100% on the same page and still dealt with problems in their relationship. However, it looks like Emily and Lorelei's relationship will be changing when Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life hits the schedule. Here's what lead actress Lauren Graham had to say about the revival series : \nThe healing that happens between Lorelai and Emily is such a long time coming. And because Richard's absence is such a big part of our story, it really meant a lot to me to grow their relationship a little bit. \nIf you've been keeping tabs on the Gilmore Girls revival, you may already know that Gilmore Girls has plans to address Edward Herrmann's death. The actor passed away back in 2014, and as such, will not be a part of the revival. Since Rory's Grandpa and Lorelei's father was such an important part of the series, it makes sense that the show would at least touch on the character's death, and we've already heard a little bit about how Gilmore Girls plans to bring up that particular plotline. We also know the death in the family will bring up thoughts regarding the main characters' own feelings of mortality. \nNow, however, it looks as if Richard's death is going to have a profound affect on the series in other ways. Lauren Graham told TV Line that her relationship with her mother would also be affected by the death of her dad, and it seems like that should mostly be a good thing. Although we should note that Graham clarified things will only change \"a little bit,\" so I think we should also expect some passionate arguments and even a few barbs will be exchanged through the four-episode series. Hopefully, all in all, the two women will end up closer to being on the same page than ever before. \nGilmore Girls: A Year in the Life will hit the schedule at 12:01 a.m. PT on Netflix.

      "text": "\nWhen Netflix confirmed early this year that the much-loved TV show \"Gilmore Girls\" would be the latest in the streaming service's revivals, fans were thrilled. The timing seemed particularly tasty. \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,\" brings four 90-minute movies to Netflix, each one representing a different season of the year. The first chapter is \"Winter,\" and all four will be available to stream on Netflix beginning Friday, Nov. 25. Netflix was clearly thinking a post-Thanksgiving binge weekend was perfect for \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,\" which picks up the story of single mother Lorelai Gilmore ( Lauren Graham ), and her daughter, Rory ( Alexis Bledel ), 10 years after we saw them last, when the series ended its seven-season run in 2007. Now, in the wake of one of the most stressful presidential elections in memory, \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life\" promises to offer comfort food in a way even Netflix didn't anticipate. For legions of \"Gilmore Girl\" devotees, the show brought a vision of domestic life that was both a snug fantasy and a breath-of-fresh-air reality. On the one hand, Lorelai and Rory Gilmore lived in the cozy imaginary town of Stars Hollow, Connecticut, where the buildings were quaint, and the locals endearingly quirky. Mother and daughter were best friends, who traded fast-talking, pop culture-laced banter but were there for each other in times of sorrow and heartbreak. It's true that Stars Hollow wasn't the most diverse place on earth, but in many other ways, it represented an escapist ideal, where everyone could stop in at Luke's Diner and enjoy a cup of coffee and a burger. Created by Amy Sherman-Palladino, \"Gilmore Girls\" was ahead of its time in its sympathetic portrayal of Lorelai, who got pregnant with Rory at age 16, and went out on her own, rebelling against her controlling, wealthy parents, Richard and Emily (played, respectively, by the late Edward Herrmann and Kelly Bishop ), declining to marry Rory's father, and living her own life in Stars Hollow. \nOver time, Lorelai builds a comfortable home for her and Rory, with Lorelai becoming an innkeeper, and Rory building her braniac skills, first at a ritzy prep school (tuition provided by Lorelai's parents), and later at Yale. Thanks to DVD sets, reruns and Netflix, the original \"Gilmore Girls\" has become a cross-generational favorite, a show mothers watch with daughters, and that families can enjoy without worrying about too many adults-only plot twists. \nIt's that ongoing fandom that has made \"Gilmore Girls\" A Year in the Life\" one of the most eagerly anticipated TV events of the year. \nAll the single mothers who identified with Lorelai, the teenage girls who looked to Rory as a role model, and 'shippers obsessed with Lorelai and Rory's romantic lives are planning to devour the new episodes just as Lorelai and Rory scarfed down junk food on Gilmore movie nights. At a discussion of \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in Life\" during the summer Television Critics Association press tour, Sherman-Palladino acknowledged the show's lasting appeal. \"I hear a lot of, like, 'My daughter wanted to go to Yale because of Rory,\" Sherman-Palladino said. \"And she read books because of Rory.'\" \n\"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life\" will reflect some offscreen reality, with the death of actor Edward Herrmann. In the new episodes, Emily Gilmore, as well as her daughter and granddaughter, react to the loss of Richard Gilmore. But many other cast favorites will return, including Scott Patterson as Luke, diner-owner and – maybe? – the love of Lorelai's life; Melissa McCarthy, who played Lorelai's best friend, Sookie; David Sutcliffe as Rory's father, Christopher; Liza Weil as Rory's old classmate, Paris; and Rory's beaus, Jared Padalecki (Dean), Milo Ventimiglia (Jess) and Matt Czuchry (Logan.) And, now that Sherman-Palladino is back in control, she'll be able to write the famous final four words that she always knew would end the show. Fans are speculating wildly about what those words might be. Since Graham has said the words are spoken by Lorelai and Rory, a popular guess is something along the lines of, \"I'm pregnant,\" and \"Me, too.\" Once the episodes are streaming on Netflix, of course, social media will spoil the surprise, something Sherman-Palladino regrets. At the TCA press tour, Sherman-Palladino said that, contrary to her request, Netflix will stream all four \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life\" episodes on Nov. 25, instead of spacing them out. \"It was my hope to put them our separately,\" Sherman-Palladino said, because \"I am a thousand,\" and still likes having some time elapse between watching episodes, instead of the full-steam-ahead binge model. \n\"And also because it's such a journey and it's such a build to the last four words,\" Sherman-Palladino said. \"And because we live in an age where I knew people were going to go right to the last four words and then put it on the Internet, and possibly spoil it for people who are going to take the journey.\" \nHowever \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life\" ends, it's likely to again provide a respite from arguments about politics and protests, or any of the other issues that make the world beyond Stars Hollow feel like a tough place to be right now. \nMonths ago, during the TCA summer press tour, Graham touched on just that warm-and-fuzzy aspect of the \"Gilmore Girls\" world as a reason for its enduring popularity. \n\"It's extremely comforting,\" Graham said, \"in a world that is lacking comfort.\" \n— Kristi Turnquist ",

      "text": "\nBrendan Dassey Released If you’ve watched Netflix’s “Making A Murderer” then you’re well aware of Brendan Dassey, the nephew of Steven Avery who was “recklessly coerced” into a confession.\nWell now at 27, Brendan has been released in the rape and murder case of Teresa Halbach.\nThe Daily Mail reports: \nA federal judge has ordered that Brendan Dassey – whose case was featured in the Netflix documentary Making a Murderer – be released from prison immediately.\nA federal magistrate judge ruled in August that investigators tricked Dassey into confessing he helped his uncle, Avery, rape, kill and mutilate Halbach, a photographer, in 2005.\nDassey, who turned 27 Wednesday, was 16 at the time. The magistrate ordered that Dassey be freed unless prosecutors appealed or decided to retry him.\nDassey was sentenced to life in prison in 2007.\nHis uncle Steven Avery is still incarcerated for Halbach’s death.\n\nA lawyer for Avery recently shared however that they’re hoping to get some evidence tested in hopes of showing that it was planted.\nAgreed Testing Order entered on Monday for Steven Avery. #MakingAMurderer \n— Kathleen Zellner (@ZellnerLaw) November 12, 2016 \n\nWhat do YOU think about the latest “Making A Murderer” update???\n",
