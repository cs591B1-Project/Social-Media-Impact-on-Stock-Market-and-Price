      "text": "workout clothes \nYou probably have high expectations of your workout gear. Not only do your sneakers, leggings, and sports bras have to help you perform at your peak, you also want them to make you look damn good doing it. Luckily, in the ever-expanding landscape of athleisure and on-point designer collections, this is one goal that's pretty easy goal to crush (unlike those sumo deadlifts and dumbbell snatches)—especially when big-name brands like Nike drop new lines that are basically studio and street style goals from the heavens. (Discover these collaborations we love: J.Crew x New Balance athleisure and Toy Story x Vans sneakers .) \nThis week, Nike Women drop a limited edition rose gold collection, which is available exclusively at chic athleisure retailer Bandier. That's right—rose gold for your gym game. The full line of glammed up kicks, metallic leggings, sports bras, is available at Bandier's flagship store in New York City's Flatiron district, and Nike says the capsule collection was created with this badass manifesto in mind: \"Made of the strongest gold, designed for the strongest you.\" Forget diamonds, rose gold is a fit girl's best friend. (You'll also wanna check out these looks for everyday sporty fashion outside the gym .) \nBut if you aren't sweating it out in Manhattan, never fear, you can still up your shoe style game with a little (or big) flash rose gold on Nike.com. The full line of rose gold embellished sneakers is available online featuring new editions that range from subtle to statement pieces. There's the Free Transform Flyknit with an understated rose gold swipe, the Free TR 6 and the Flex Supreme TR each with chic rose gold elements, and the Air Max Thea , which goes full-on rose gold-plated—the perfect shoe to take from the studio to a night out with the squad. The best part? The new line of sneakers starts at $80. Consider your fall style game nailed. Search Shape Shop",

      "text": "11/19/16 AT 3:23 AM Close \nWhen The Game — real name Jayceon Terrell Taylor — is not busy performing for the crowd or making music, he is preoccupied with daddy duties. This is evident in the 36-year-old hip hop artist’s Instagram posts, the latest of which speaks of how proud the “Dreams” hitmaker is of his 9-year-old son, King Justice Taylor, for nailing his modeling gig for Nike. \nOn Friday, The Game took to Instagram to share a snap of his youngest son hitting the runway for Nike’s Air Jordan brand. In the photo, King could be seen sporting an all-red ensemble and a red backpack to match. To express his pride and joy over his son’s modeling stint, The Game implied that King brought his A-game as expected. \nA week prior, The Game also shared a photo of King alongside modeling and fashion industry newbie Balthazar Saint Tillman — the son of former American football safety Travares Arastius Tillman. The caption for the snap also alludes to how the rapper is encouraging his son to do what he likes aside from school. \nWhile The Game seems to be at a happy place with his kids, it appears that this happiness could soon be interrupted. It was revealed this Saturday that the jury on The Game’s case with “She’s Got Game” reality show contestant Priscilla Rainey finally reached a verdict, and it is one that’s against the \"Hate It or Love It\" rapper. \nThe Jasmine Brand exclusively reported that the jury found The Game liable for damages to Rainey, who originally filed for a sexual assault case against the former back in August 2015. The jury reportedly reached a verdict four days after the courtroom started hearing testimonies on Nov. 14. Related Stories",

The Victoria’s Secret model was slammed for being ‘abnormally thin’ in her new athletic campaign with Nike, after fans noticed her smaller-than-usual waistline! Check out these vicious, body shaming tweets! \nWe’ve all heard of girls obtaining the perfect revenge body when they suddenly become single, but is Bella Hadid , 19, taking it too far? Fans online seem to think the supermodel is looking a little too skinny these days, as showcased in her latest campaign with Nike . The biggest problem people seem to have with Bella’s ad is that she doesn’t look like an athlete because of her frail frame and the fact that you can see her ribcage . Nike as a brand is also being slammed for “endorsing eating disorders” and “promoting anorexia.” What ever happened to putting athletes as the face of athletic brands? Nike might have lost a customer by putting Bella Hadid as their face. \n— Javoni Faucette (@jfaucette7) November 18, 2016 . @Nike bella hadid? since when did nike sellout and start sponsoring models? the nike I grew up w/ empowered the world's most elite athletes ",

      "title": "The Apple Watch Nike+ will make you miss running with your phone",
      "text": "The Nike+ version of the Apple Watch is a weird one. Setting aside the obvious marketing and business partnership between Nike and Apple, it's unclear why it exists.\nSure, there are the exclusive Nike watch bands, the watch faces with Nike fonts and the pre-installed Nike+ Running app. But really, this is just an Apple Watch Series 2 with a few bits added. There aren't any hardware differences (apart from the band), and any ol' Apple Watch — Nike branding or not — will run the Nike+ app.\nSEE ALSO: The Apple Watch just got a selfie camera\nStill, from using the watch for the past couple of weeks, I see two audiences for the Apple Watch Nike+: First, Nike fans — that is, those who are already part of the Nike+ Running community (about 30 million, according to the NikeFuel website ) sharing their runs, competing with friends and generally identifying with the Nike brand.\nOne of the louder watch faces for the Apple Watch Nike+.\nImage: LilI Sams/Mashable\nThe other audience, and the one that Nike and Apple are probably more interested in, is the casual runner. The people who may or may not have used Nike+, but it's more likely they use a variety of running apps, such as RunKeeper, Runtastic or Strava. They get their miles in, but they're not religious about it — to them, running is more about clearing the mind and getting some cardio in than scoring a PR.\nI'd put myself more in that category than the former. So what does the Apple Watch Nike+ offer a runner like me? There are a couple of ways to answer that question.\nThe Nike+ app lets you set a preferred run time.\nImage: Lili Sams/Mashable\nFirst, you have to consider what kind of gear and apps you use for runs now. Most of the running world (including me) transitioned from running with iPods to running with iPhones a few years back. Indeed, Nike did, too — it used to offer a kit for connecting your iPod nano to a sensor in your shoe. I used that system a lot when I trained for the NYC Marathon in 2008.\nWhen I first saw the Apple Watch Nike+'s band, I thought it looked uncomfortable AF. I was dead wrong.\nToday, we all run with smartphones strapped to our arms or belts. That's certainly a little inconvenient, but the general thinning and lightening of phones has made that less of a compromise. Still, no matter how light phones actually get, trying to operate your phone while running is horrifically awkward at best.\nSmartwatches began to change that equation a couple of years back, granting users playback controls and some display information in much a more logical spot than your tricep. But they're an expensive convenience — especially if you're not one to wear a watch in the first place. Many haven't decided that it's worth buying just for a mini touchscreen to use while running.\nWell, the Nike+ Apple Watch is here to persuade them. However, the case it makes isn't that convincing.\nNike returns to your wrist Full disclosure: I'd never used an Apple Watch before checking out the Nike+ version. Yes, I'd seen them, touched them, even worn them for a few minutes here and there, but I haven't used an Apple Watch day-to-day until now. I do typically wear an Android Wear device, the LG G Watch R , which can connect with the iPhone (and disconnect, several times a day, but that's another story).\nThe packaging is very similar to the Apple Watch Series 2, except the Nike+ box is black (the regular one is white) and it brandishes the iconic Nike swoosh and \"+\" sign, which is kinda cool if you like Nike.\nWhen I first saw the Apple Watch Nike+'s swiss-cheese band, I thought it looked silly and uncomfortable AF. I was dead wrong. It's only silly-looking out of context as an athletic watch (and you can swap the band out super-easily), and the perforations do double duty as holes for the plastic clasp. And the fluoroelastomer (synthetic rubber) material is, in fact, crazy comfortable — most of the time you forget you're wearing a smartwatch.\nNeon yellow is just one of three styles of the Apple Watch Nike+ band, and they're all super-comfortable\nImage: Lili Sams/Mashable\nThe Apple Watch user interface is kind of annoyingly complicated, but at least the current system software, watchOS 3 , makes it similar to the iPhone (notifications up top and control center on the bottom). The digital crown is a little weird and unnecessary (I'd usually just scroll by touching) but can be handy for some apps. I just wish the UI were better at signaling me when I can scroll.\nTo me, the Nike font feels more like a throwback to the '80s.\nThe Apple Watch setup doesn't take too long, but on the Nike+ watch you have the added bonus (I guess) of being able to pick one of the exclusive Nike-themed watch faces. Again, this is something Nike fans will enjoy while others will respond with a \"meh.\" To me, the Nike font feels more like a throwback to the '80s — perhaps the peak period for Nike's marketing engine, when the celebrity power of mega-athletes Michael Jordan and Bo Jackson gave it an aura of cool.\nStill, I wanted the full Nike+ experience, so I went with one of the more conservative watch faces, with Nike-style numbers on the rim, a swoosh in the middle, and a \"complication\" that showed my last Nike-powered run on the bottom.\nThe Nike+ watch face I chose.\nImage: Lili Sams/Mashable\nMy Apple Watch was super flaky the first time I took it out for a run, and it wouldn't run the Nike+ Running app. Instead, I used the Apple-default Workout app to record my run, which was good to do, since it showed me just what you can do without any of the Nike bells or whistles.\nThe Workout app is fairly bare-bones: You can set a goal for distance, time or calories burned, and there's also the option for an open run. While running, the watch gives you feedback with subtle vibrations when you hit milestones along with some basic onscreen stats, but not much else. I missed the spoken feedback I get with the Nike+ iPhone app.\nA couple of watch reboots later and the Nike+ app was good to go. When you launch the app, a big yellow Start button greets you. Assuming you have friends who run with Nike+, you'll see a prompt to \"catch up\" to the one you're closest to (in terms of miles clocked this week). If you go for that, it'll start a distance run with the goal being the difference in mileage. You can always run further than that, of course.\nStart screen for Outdoor Run on the default Workout app.\nImage: Lili Sams/Mashable\nStart screen for Nike+ app.\nImage: Lili Sams/Mashable\nBefore you run, you can select between Basic or Advanced mode, the only difference being you'll see more stats on the screen when you raise the watch mid-run: In addition to your distance, you'll also see your pace and elapsed time.\nThe start screen has prompt to \"catch up\" to your Nike+ friends.\nImage:\nWhat you see when you scroll down.\nImage:\nThe fact that the Basic mode, which is the default, shows just one stat speaks volumes about who the Apple Watch Nike+ is for. This isn't an advanced training platform for serious athletes — it's for the more casual runner, who cares more about the self-improvement and social aspects of running than meticulously keeping track of your progress.\nHow it works with music The Apple Watch Nike+ enabled me to do something I haven't done before: Run with my iTunes running playlist, but without an iPhone strapped to my arm. Obviously, you need wireless earphones to play music via the Apple Watch, but I made the switch years ago, so that wasn't a problem.\nThe Apple Watch has roughly 3GB of storage available for music, which should be plenty for most running playlists. Unlike the Nike+ iPhone, music playback is handled separately, via the Music app, which actually ends up being a big weakness of the experience.\nYou see, one of the features I love most about the Nike+ app on the iPhone is the Powersongs. There you are, closing in on the home stretch of your run. Maybe you want to shave a second or two off your pace, or maybe you spot a fellow runner a couple hundred feet in front of you. Hit Powersong, and a pre-selected running anthem comes on, pushing you to kick it up a notch (or five).\nPlayback controls in the Nike+ app only appear for controlling music playing from your phone.\nImage:\nDefault playback controls for the Apple Watch, used when running without your phone.\nImage:\nSadly, Powersongs aren't available if you're running with just the Apple Watch. You can call up a Powersong via the watch if you also have your iPhone, but the Watch on its own can't do it. I don't know if this is a Nike issue or an Apple Watch issue, and it really doesn't matter — it's a major disappointment either way.\nPowersongs aren't available if you're running with just the Apple Watch.\nThe other major limitation to the music experience is you're limited to Apple Music. I long ago graduated from listening to the same 100-or-so songs over and over again, and I more often run with Amazon Music or Spotify Running as my soundtrack. And so far, despite giving iPhone users the option to download playlists to their phones, those third-party apps can't move those playlists to the Apple Watch. Again, whether that's Apple's or Spotify's fault doesn't matter — it's a poor experience either way.\nNot being an Apple Music subscriber meant I was limited to my fairly outdated personal library. But hey — it got me listening to Blink-182 again!\nEven if alternative music apps worked on the Apple Watch, they still wouldn't be able to actually stream music, since once the watch gets out of range of my iPhone or a Wi-Fi network, it becomes disconnected. Not entirely — the GPS can still track me, which ensures I have accurate maps of my runs — but anything that needs a data connection is out.\nNike+ app, mid-run.\nNike+ app, post-run. Final run data is available when you scroll.\nAnd there's the rub, the reason the Apple Watch Nike+ isn't worth the experience it's seemingly promising: Without a data connection, it's a step backward. Running with my iPhone, I can stream music, get notifications and even take calls while I run. With the Apple Watch, I can do none of those things.\nI can't even use one of the signature features of the Nike+ Running app. Years ago, the app added the ability to get cheers from your social networks mid-run, pushing audible applause through your headphones whenever a friend Liked the device-generated post that announced you had begun a run. Using the feature is a bit of a #humblebrag, to be sure, but it was a nice way for your support network to give you an ego boost, and perhaps some extra motivation.\nOn the Apple Watch, those motivators are limited to the \"catch up\" feature I mentioned earlier and occasional alert from the watch: \"Are we running today?\" (Those didn't appear that often, and and when they did it was seemingly random.)\nThe app prompts you to alert your Nike+ friends about your run.\nOne of the motivational messages the Nike+ app gives you. They're not intrusive.\nObviously what I'm getting at is the lack of a 4G LTE connection on the watch. That might seem like an unfair strike against this product — as I said at the outset, it's just a slightly modified Apple Watch Series 2, and Apple hasn't debuted a cellular-connected watch yet. But it comes down to the experience it offers. As a runner, I've gone beyond listening to static playlists and simply syncing runs after the fact; I want connectivity throughout my run.\nSure the watch does offer a nice convenient window and remote control for your running experience, and if you run with your phone (that is, streaming music from your phone), it'll even give you a Powersong button. But those gains are fairly incremental, and don't justify the $369 cost, at least not from where I'm standing.\nThe Apple Watch Nike+ is really only worth the price if you're up for going all-in on the Apple Watch experience and plan on wearing this thing even when not running. In that case, you should invest in another band (starting at $49) that's a little more appropriate for day-to-day.\nIf not, you won't be missing out on that much. One of the promises of the smartwatch was it would free us from being tethered to phones, especially for athletics. Two years later, with very few cellular-connected watches on the market, that remains largely a promise. In the meantime, you can enjoy what amounts to a Nike-branded toy — just don't expect it to change your life.\nApple Watch Nike+ The Good It's an Apple Watch • Clever\nThe Bad No cellular (3G/4G) connectivity • Doesn't support Powersongs or cheers • Nike branding a little over the top\nThe Bottom Line The Apple Watch Nike+ is a fun gadget for Nike fans and casual runners, but without cellular connectivity it's a shallow experience.",

      "text": "Yolanda Hadid is standing by her daughter Bella Hadid. \nThe 20-year-old supermodel recently found herself in hot water after her new deal with Nike became the subject of online criticism from those who questioned whether she was a right fit for the athletic brand. \nAfter sharing the news of the campaign on Instagram, Bella’s page became filled with comments that she’s “way too skinny to represent a sports brand,” and “doesn’t even have an athletic body.” \nBut Bella’s mother Yolanda doesn’t agree with the critics. The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills alum defended her daughter to TMZ — explaining that Bella competed in equestrian riding every weekend from age 3 until 15. A photo posted by YOLANDA (@yolanda.hadid) on Nov 17, 2016 at 12:54pm PST \nShe had to stop riding when she was diagnosed with Lyme disease — an illness she shares with her mother and that can fog the brain. \n“[Bella] had to give up her lifelong dream of having a professional riding career and a shot at the Olympics due to her severe symptoms and inability to ride,” Yolanda wrote on her BravoTV blog in January . “[She] struggles with symptoms of chronic Lyme every day.” \n“Always remember who you were before the world told you who you should be,” Yolanda captioned an Instagram shot posted Friday of young Bella riding. \nRELATED VIDEO: Bella Hadid Shares Her Passion for Horseback Riding \nEven if Bella didn’t have her athletic background, Yolanda said her Nike deal would still be warranted. \n“You obviously don’t have to be an athlete to wear or enjoy Nike wear,” she told TMZ. A photo posted by Bella Hadid (@bellahadid) on Nov 14, 2016 at 10:15am PST \nAfter Bella’s deal was announced, Olympic skater Meryl Davis tweeted her disapproval over using yet another model to promote workout gear. \nThe 29-year-old, who won Dancing with the Stars in 2014 , posted side-by-side photos of Hadid in Nike gear, Kylie Jenner in a Puma outfit, and one of Olympic gymnast Aly Raisman in Reebok — writing “I’ll take the one promoted by the athlete please.” I'll take the one promoted by the athlete please 💪🏼 pic.twitter.com/MRe1baOBtX \n— Meryl Davis (@Meryl_Davis) November 15, 2016 \nHadid recently admitted that she “accidentally” lost more weight than she intended, telling PEOPLE that she “really didn’t mean to.” \n“I want boobs. I want my ass back,” she said. “But it’s not my fault. My weight fluctuates and so does everybody’s and I think that if people are gonna judge, that’s the worst you can possibly do because everybody is different.” \n“I worked out so hard and everybody is like, ‘Oh, she looks so skinny blah, blah, blah,’ ” Hadid said. “But I think that if you just stick to something you can really achieve so much. I’ve been eating hard protein every day, and working out for three hours every day. It’s crazy but I think that you know if you set your mind to something I think you can succeed.” Show Full Article",

      "text": "Yolanda Foster defends daughter Bella Hadid's Nike ads UPI News Service, 11/19/2016 \nYolanda Foster defended her daughter Bella Hadid this week after the 20-year-old was announced as Nike's newest spokesmodel. \nADVERTISEMENT The 52-year-old \"The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills\" alum responded in an interview with TMZ to Olympic figure skater and former \"Dancing with the Stars\" champion Meryl Davis criticizing Bella's campaign for the athletic wear company. \n\"You obviously don't have to be an athlete to wear or enjoy Nike wear,\" she said after stressing that Bella was an accomplished equestrienne before she was forced to quit competitive riding due to chronic Lyme disease. \nDavis had posted a side-by-side photo of Bella in Nike, \"Keeping Up with the Kardashians\" star Kylie Jenner in Puma and Olympic gymnast Aly Raisman in Reebok, writing, \"I'll take the one promoted by the athlete please.\" \nIn addition, many social media users suggested on Instagram that Bella is too thin to represent Nike. \n\"Nike? She's not an athlete but more importantly it's giving young girls unrealistic expectations yet again,\" one person wrote. \n\"Yeh this is why young girls get eating disorders, when being abnormally thin is glorified. Well done @nike,\" another added. \nFoster herself was diagnosed with chronic Lyme disease in 2012, and revealed in October 2015 that Bella and her son Anwar Hadid also have the condition. \nBella, who shared a photo of her treatment in August, previously confirmed her illness ended her competitive riding career. \n\"It affected my memory so I suddenly wouldn't remember how to drive to Santa Monica from Malibu where I lived,\" the model told ES magazine. \"I couldn't ride. I was just too sick. And I had to sell my horse because I couldn't take care of it.\" \n\"If I'd had the chance to succeed in riding, I might not have modeled,\" she admitted. \"I didn't know that I was going to get sick.\" \nBella, the younger sister of model Gigi Hadid , is known for her modeling work with Balmain and Chanel. \nShe will walk in the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show for the first time in December.

Bella Hadid Can Rock The Hell Outta Nike 1 11/19/2016 1:02 PM PST BY TMZ STAFF \nBella Hadid has a big time model backing up her latest deal with Nike ... and her supporter definitely knows a thing or two about sports. \nHannah Davis Jeter was at LAX Saturday and was quizzed on whether or not she thinks only athletes should be able to model athletic gear. You'll remember, Hadid's gotten a lot of flack -- including some from Olympic skater Meryl Davis -- for signing a huge deal with Nike and not being a pro athlete. \nCheck out the clip -- Jeter's totally got Bella's back -- and pay extra attention to how she's now signing autographs.",

      "text": "A week ago we gave you a first look at the next installment from the Nike SB Dunk Shoebox series with this SB Dunk Low Pink Box. Now we bring you official images that show the sneakers in all of their glory.\nThe Nike SB Dunk Low Pink box draws inspiration from the classic pink Nike SB box that was used back in the mid 2000s . The shoe comes equipped with a reflective prism-pink upper with White accents on the laces, inner liner, and midsole. The Swoosh logos and outsole have then been done in Black to complete the look. The debossed shoe box logo has been added by the ankle along with the special insoles to denote this shoe as part of the collection.\nYou’ll be able to get your hands on the Nike SB Dunk Low Pink Box at select Nike SB accounts beginning on November 26, 2016 for $120.\nvia: Nike \nAuthor’s Take Lots of great SB Dunks released when this pink box was around so I expect hardcore SB fans to pick up this pair. I’m not a huge fan of pink sneakers so I’ll pass on these and wait to see what the next pair looks like.\n\nThe post Official Images Of The Nike SB Dunk Low Pink Box appeared first on KicksOnFire.com .",

By Brandon Richard \nAs of late, the Nike KD 9 has been plagued by weak colorway options, but Baylor Basketball is all about standing out on the court. \nFor tonight's game against Florida Gulf Coast, the team laced up an eye-catching Team Exclusive KD 9 in black and volt. The Oregon-like scheme matched the Bears' latest Nike uniform combination. \nIn tough outing, Baylor rallied late to beat FGCU 81-72 to move to 3-0 on the season.

      "text": "Yolanda (left) and her daughter Bella Hadid. REX Shutterstock. \nBella Hadid ’s mother has come to her defense after the supermodel’s recent Nike campaign sparked a torrent of comment from Internet trolls and Olympians Meryl Davis and Ashley Wagner. \n“You obviously don’t have to be an athlete to wear or enjoy Nike wear,” Yolanda said Friday during an interview with TMZ , adding that Bella was once an equestrian sports competitor from 3 years old until 15, when she began suffering from Lyme disease. Kylie Jenner Strips Down to Pink Pumps - and Not Much Else for Tyga's 27th Birthday \nOn Monday, Bella unveiled her “New York Made” billboard in the Big Apple, but some of the detractors among the nearly 2,700 comments cried that she was “too skinny” to represent a sportswear brand. Davis, an ice skater, chimed in — tweeting that she thought a professional athlete would’ve been a better choice: “I’ll take the one promoted by the athlete please ,” she tweeted one day later along with a photo composite of Bella wearing Nike, Kylie Jenner in Puma and Team USA gymnast Aly Raisman wearing Reebok . A photo posted by YOLANDA (@yolanda.hadid) on Nov 17, 2016 at 12:54pm PST A photo posted by Bella Hadid (@bellahadid) on Nov 14, 2016 at 10:15am PST \nFellow Olympian Ashley Wagner joined the chorus, commenting on the tweet, “Strong is my kind of beautiful!!” Reebok Women responded on Twitter: “@AshWagner2010 @Meryl_Davis @Aly_Raisman Couldn’t agree more with you, ladies! #ToughIsBeautiful.” \nYolanda shared an image of daughter on Friday in action on a horse. “Always remember who you were before the world told you who you should be…. @bellahadid #athlete#horselover,” she captioned an Instagram photo .

      "text": "Yolanda Foster Defends Daughter Bella Hadid After Nike Campaign... Yolanda Foster Defends Daughter Bella Hadid After Nike Campaign Backlash Yolanda Foster \nThe model was announced as fronting Nike’s latest campaign last week, but received some backlash for not being an athlete. \nYolanda Foster has hit back at critics of daughter Bella Hadid, who was recently revealed as fronting a new advertising campaign for Nike. \nAmong the critics of Bella was Olympic gold medalist Meryl Davis, who tweeted a picture of the model’s advert alongside one of Kylie Jenner for Puma and Olympic gymnast Aly Raisman for Reebok and wrote: ”I'll take the one promoted by the athlete please.” A photo posted by Bella Hadid (@bellahadid) on Nov 14, 2016 at 10:15am PST \nBut speaking to TMZ , Yolanda said that Bella had dreams of competing in the Olympics as an equestrian athlete, but was forced to quit riding when she was diagnosed with Lyme disease at 15. \nYolanda added: \"You obviously don't have to be an athlete to wear or enjoy Nike wear.” \nThe ‘Real Housewives’ star also posted a photo of Bella riding on Instagram and captioned it: ‘Always remember who you were before the world told you who you should be.... @bellahadid’. \nBack in January Yolanda had written a blog post about Bella’s heartbreak when she had to give up horse riding. \n\"This was the biggest heartbreak of her life and an extremely sensitive subject for her,\" Yolanda wrote. \n\"She is resilient and focused on a new direction, she’s made a name for herself in the modelling industry while she struggles with symptoms of chronic Lyme every day.” \nMore: Gigi Hadid Won't Let Anyone Mess With Younger Sister Bella \nSpeaking to Entertainment Tonight , Meryl later clarified why she decided to post the tweet about Bella and Kylie Jenner. \n\"As someone who has experienced just how hurtful comments on the internet can be, my intention is to promote the use of a diversified ideal of beauty and support the role I believe female athletes can play in the pursuit of that,\" she sad. \n\"I feel very strongly that all women should be represented in the media for young girls to see and my intention is to encourage inclusiveness. I am about women supporting women and building one another up.” Nov 17, 2016 at 12:54pm PST Contactmusic",

Today we get a first look at some of the official images of the Nike KD 9 Obsidian. \nThe Nike KD 9 Obsidian is done in a Obsidian and Dark Purple Flyknit upper that result in a semi-tonal look. Hits of Dust and Black hues are placed throughtout to give the shoe some minimal contrast. Beow you will find a tonal sole unit equipped with an Zoom Air unit to help you do your thing on the court. Dropping on November 25th for $150, let us know what you think about this new colorway of the KD 9. \nvia: Nike Author’s Take \nI keep saying that I like the Nike KD 9 model, but I’ve yet to pick up a single pair. I don’t know why. I guess there hasn’t been a colorway that has completely blown me away, I guess. \nAvailable Now on Kixify Available Now on Kixify & eBay TAGS ",

The team recently wore the bold sneaker which consists of a Black base upper accented brightly by the Volt hits noted on the laces, branding, Nike Swoosh and sole unit. Put them next to the team’s uniform, and it’s a perfect match. Thoughts on this PE? Get a good look up top and let us know in the comments below.\n \nvia: BaylorMBB \nAuthor’s Take The silhouette is nice, but I’ve had enough of Volt on sneakers. I’ll hold of on anything with Volt for a good year or two.\n\nThe post Baylor University Get Their Own Nike KD 9 Team PE appeared first on KicksOnFire.com .",

      "text": "DETROIT (WWJ) — Following Nike’s opening of a store on Woodward Avenue earlier this year, apparel rival Under Armor will follow suit in early 2017.\nBillionaire and Detroit native Dan Gilbert says the 17,000 square foot store will be just a few doors down from Nike’s new location, according to Crain’s Detroit .\n“Dan Mullen, executive vice president of Bedrock, said Under Armour will take the basement, first and second floors of the 1201 Woodward building, which is also occupied by Fathead LLC, another Gilbert company. Mullen declined to disclose terms of the lease deal but did say it’s a “long-term” agreement. It’s not known how many people the new store will employ or if contractors have been selected.” \nThe store will be located at 1201 Woodward, on the northwest corner of State Street.\nUnder Armor has other outlet locations in Michigan in Howell and Birch Run. The downtown store, however, will be a “Brand House” location.\nWelcome @UnderArmour to downtown DET. 'Brand House' store will be great add to Woodward Ave retail corridor in 2017: https://t.co/Ms8gl8gyKm \n— Dan Gilbert (@cavsdan) November 20, 2016 \n\nLast year, Under Armor had sponsorship deals with current MVPs from the NBA (Stephen Curry), the NFL (Cam Newton) and the MLB (Bryce Harper).\nThe company was founded in 1996 in Washington D.C.\n",

      "title": "Long Nike, Short Under Armour: An Update On This Trade",
      "text": "The trade was suggested in August and is yielding a ~15% return. \nI'm recommending taking profits and closing this trade. \nStill prefer NKE over UA as a long-term, core holding. A little more than three months ago (108 days exactly) I suggested this pair trade: long Nike (NYSE: NKE ), short Under Armour (NYSE: UA ) - please see the article here . The investment rationale was a combination of a sky-rocket 67x P/E valuation for UA, while NKE was trading at a more reasonable (though still high) 32x, and some signs that the UA's stellar growth figures were not sustainable at those same levels. Now that UA is down by 22% and NKE is down by 7% as I write this article at this Friday night, I suggest taking profits and closing this trade. Trade Performance and a Quick Recap The 14.6% total return on this trade is close to my \"safe\" 15% objective, so as I'm not sure if I'll be able to write an article when the exact 15% is actually achieved, I'm already anticipating the closure of this trade (in fact, this trade yielded 15.6% as of October 28). I'm not going to repeat the specific reasons I saw to justify this trade as you can check the previous article. It is true that there were much greater growth expectations on UA, which helped explain its premium valuation. In fact this trade was quite controversial, as UA had many fans due to its strong branding and spectacular growth track record. But with some clear signs that its growth outlook was way riskier than Nike's (specially in terms of bottom line), and with signs of an imminent slowdown, it seemed to me that relative valuation was a clear distortion at that time. Figure 1: Long NKE, Short UA Trade Performance Source: YCharts and Author Since then, NKE's future orders disappointed, which made people use that as a selling point for the opposite trade (UA over NKE). However, we must bear in mind that NKE is a much larger and more diversified company than UA, which means that its sales figure should better reflect the overall market performance. So if there is an across-the-board slowdown in sporting goods sales, it would likely impact UA as well. In my opinion, this is what explains the slowdown in UA's top-line growth as reported in the last quarter, besides the hard-to-beat comps of the past quarters. Figure 1: NKE and UA Quarterly YoY Revenue Growth Click to enlarge Source: YCharts UA Has De-Rated And Drove the Trade's Performance, Although It Remains Expensive Now UA has de-rated a bit as seen in Figure 2 below. It remains expensive at ~50x forward earnings, while NKE also de-rated to ~20x. One may argue that NKE is now even more attractive on a relative basis. Well, that might be true. At 20x I wouldn't be too upset to buy NKE for a long-term portfolio, but at 50x I still don't think it's worth buying UA. The problem is that UA is seen as a potential acquisition target, which makes a lot of sense by the way, and I don't want to be carrying this risk in my hands right now. Moreover, UA could have a slowdown in its top-line growth followed by a substantial   (less pains of growth), which could boost profitability and change dramatically its multiples. Figure 2: NKE and UA Forward P/E Ratios Click to enlarge Source: YCharts I hope this little series of articles on NKE and UA has helped you make some money! Here are my concluding remarks for now: - If you are on the long NKE, short UA trade, I recommend taking profits for now. - I still prefer NKE over UA as a long-term investment as the former is much more diversified, has more firepower and already yields very good returns while UA still has a promising growth outlook, but involves much greater risks and is on a decelerating trend. Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.  ",

This Nike KD 9 features a mix of Game Royal Blue and Black Nike Flyknit upper with White Nike Swooshes on the sides. Completing the shoe is a Black \"KD\" logo on the back heel and matching Black rubber outsole. Joining the Black Friday celebration is the release of the brand new Nike KD 9 Dark Purple Dust colorway. Dressed in an Obsidian, Dark Purple Dust and Black color scheme. This Nike KD 9 features an Obsidian Flyknit upper with Dark Purple accents, Black detailing and Purple Dust outsole. Jordans 2017 , The Nike KD 9 Dark Obsidian takes an ominous approach to Kevin Durant's latest signature sneaker to match the Warriors' new \"Super Villain\" approach to things. The premium Flyknit construction adds ventilation and a malleable fit for extra flexibility while hooping, but this is definitely one of those KD 9 pairs that will fair well off-the-court too thanks to the tonal aesthetic. The Nike KD 9 Dark Obsidian also boasts some Dark Purple Dust on the lining and outsole while a vibrant touch of Hyper Turquoise streaks across the 3/4 length Zoom midsole for a nice change of pace. Obsidian and black share the upper on this pair, which is flanked by iridescent purple Swoosh branding. A lighter shade of blue lines the interior and fills the rear KD logo, while teal adds a little pop along the Zoom cushioning unit. The shoe rides atop a blue-tinted translucent outsole. Views: 1",

Finishing touches include white Swooshes adorning the side panels and a black “KD” logo prominent on the back heel.\nRetailing for $150, you can purchase this latest pair at select Nike retailers starting Wednesday, November 23.\nImages: VILLA \nAuthor’s Take The colorway looks solid and it’s a versatile option overall.

Dropping on Black Friday is this “Obsidian” colorway of the KD 9 that features a combination of Obsidian and Dark Purple Dust throughout the Flyknit upper with Black detailing completing the look.\nTake a look at the official images above and look for the Nike KD 9 Obsidian to arrive at retailers on November 25, 2016 for $150.\nvia: Nike \nAuthor’s Take I don’t like the colorway but I also don’t hate it. There’s so many other sneakers releasing on Black Friday that I’m sure these will get overlooked.\n\nThe post Official Images Of The Nike KD 9 Obsidian appeared first on KicksOnFire.com .",

      "text": "Workers in a Vietnam factory making Nike shoes in 2005. AP/RICHARD VOGEL\nIf President-elect Donald Trump has made anything clear about what he plans to do in his first 100 days in office, it's that he wants to make some changes to trade.\nMore specifically, he's in opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership : a trade agreement between Pacific Rim countries for the greater and cheaper movement of goods between them.\nThe TPP has been a hotly contested trade issue for years now, championed by Obama as an agreement to increase wealth in the US by opening up Asian markets to American goods. Critics say it endangers American workers by making it too tempting for companies to outsource their factories to Asia.\nA vote on the bill has still not be held in Congress, and its future is now largely in doubt in the wake of Trump's historic election. Trump transition team internal documents obtained by Politico say that pulling out of the deal will be at the top of his first 100 days' agenda.\nA large percentage of footwear is made in countries included in the TPP pact. Why does that matter for sneakers? Tariffs are high for footwear, ranging from 5% to 40% depending on the materials used, according to the Office of Textiles and Apparel .\nAround 97-99% of sports footwear sold in the US is made elsewhere, accounting for nearly $3 billion in tariffs paid, according to the pro-trade organization Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America . Nearly half a billion dollars of that comes from TPP countries, chiefly Vietnam and Malaysia.\nChina — which, with 66% of inventory, is the the largest exporter of shoes to the US — was not involved in TPP negotiations. The second-largest exporter, Vietnam, was. Should TPP have been agreed to, tariffs for shoes imported from Vietnam and other countries into the US would have been reduced or eliminated, reducing the built-in cost to outsource sneaker manufacturing overseas.\nThis would have meant potentially reducing the cost of sneakers in the US, according to NPD group analyst Matt Powell , and an increase in sports shoe sales overall.\nThe players Nike, the largest sportswear maker in the world, made no secret of the fact that it was in support of TPP. It has 26 footwear factories in Vietnam, the majority of which create shoes for the American market. The swoosh promised to bring up to 10,000 jobs to the US should the pact be approved and put into action. Nike said a reduction in tariffs could be used toward more advanced manufacturing.\nGerman sportswear giant Adidas also supported the deal for similar reasons.\nPresident Barack Obama speaks at Nike headquarters in Beaverton, Oregon, Friday, May 8, 2015. Don Ryan/AP\nNew Balance, which manufactures up to 25% of its shoes in the US, notably opposed the trade agreement. The company recently reiterated their stance on the agreement, which some mistook for support of Trump policies . Many began burning or throwing away their New Balance shoes in protest.\nThe game In all likelihood, from what Trump has said previously and the documents obtained recently, TPP won't be on the table in a meaningful way anytime soon.\nThat means that prices will most likely stay the same for footwear, and any hope for some relief from the problems pressuring giants like Nike will not abate soon. The possibility of greater sales while maintaining similar margins is out the window for sportswear companies who import the vast majority of its footwear.\nHowever, with TPP off the table, initiatives like Adidas' \"speedfactory\" in Atlanta seem more important than ever, as more advanced manufacturing methods means that high-tech factories in the US make more economical sense.\nThere's a potential for more \"made in the USA\" written under your shoe's tongue in the coming decades.\nSEE ALSO: Nike, Under Armour, and Adidas are selling 'dad shoes' — and it seems to be a brilliant move DON'T FORGET: Follow Business Insider's lifestyle page on Facebook!

      "text": "By the time you’re done with all your Thanksgiving leftovers, the Nike SD Dunk Low Pink Box should be yours for the taking. The latest SB Dunk model inspired by Nike SB boxes used in the past has the Dunk Low done in an all-Pink motif. Let’s take a closer look.\nInspired by the Pink Nike SB box that was used back in the mid 2000s, the SB Dunk Low come with a reflective prism-Pink upper with White accents on the laces, lining and midsole. The Nikek Swoosh logos and outsole come done in Black to complete the SB Box inspired look. Adding a bit of a custom feel to the release is the debossed shoe box logo placed by the ankle along as well as the special insoles that make it easy to see that this release is a part of the shoe box collection. You’ll be able to get your hands on the Nike SB Dunk Low Pink Box at select Nike SB accounts beginning on November 26 for $120.\nvia: Renarts \nAuthor’s Take Nice execution, but to tell you the truth, I really don’t tend to wear Pink sneakers very often. For that reason, this is a pass.\n\nAvailable Now on Kixify \nThe post The Nike SB Dunk Low Pink Box Drops Next Weekend appeared first on KicksOnFire.com .",

      "text": "print Workers in a Vietnam factory making Nike shoes in 2005. AP/RICHARD VOGEL \nIf President-elect Donald Trump has made anything clear about what he plans to do in his first 100 days in office, it's that he wants to make some changes to trade. \nMore specifically, he's in opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership : a trade agreement between Pacific Rim countries for the greater and cheaper movement of goods between them. \nThe TPP has been a hotly contested trade issue for years now, championed by Obama as an agreement to increase wealth in the US by opening up Asian markets to American goods. Critics say it endangers American workers by making it too tempting for companies to outsource their factories to Asia. \nA vote on the bill has still not be held in Congress, and its future is now largely in doubt in the wake of Trump's historic election. Trump transition team internal documents obtained by Politico say that pulling out of the deal will be at the top of his first 100 days' agenda. \nA large percentage of footwear is made in countries included in the TPP pact. Why does that matter for sneakers? Tariffs are high for footwear, ranging from 5% to 40% depending on the materials used, according to the Office of Textiles and Apparel . \nAround 97-99% of sports footwear sold in the US is made elsewhere, accounting for nearly $3 billion in tariffs paid, according to the pro-trade organization Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America . Nearly half a billion dollars of that comes from TPP countries, chiefly Vietnam and Malaysia. \nChina — which, with 66% of inventory, is the the largest exporter of shoes to the US — was not involved in TPP negotiations. The second-largest exporter, Vietnam, was. Should TPP have been agreed to, tariffs for shoes imported from Vietnam and other countries into the US would have been reduced or eliminated, reducing the built-in cost to outsource sneaker manufacturing overseas. \nThis would have meant potentially reducing the cost of sneakers in the US, according to NPD group analyst Matt Powell , and an increase in sports shoe sales overall. The players \nNike, the largest sportswear maker in the world, made no secret of the fact that it was in support of TPP. It has 26 footwear factories in Vietnam, the majority of which create shoes for the American market. The swoosh promised to bring up to 10,000 jobs to the US should the pact be approved and put into action. Nike said a reduction in tariffs could be used toward more advanced manufacturing. \nGerman sportswear giant Adidas also supported the deal for similar reasons. \nPresident Barack Obama speaks at Nike headquarters in Beaverton, Oregon, Friday, May 8, 2015. Don Ryan/AP \nNew Balance, which manufactures up to 25% of its shoes in the US, notably opposed the trade agreement. The company recently reiterated their stance on the agreement, which some mistook for support of Trump policies . Many began burning or throwing away their New Balance shoes in protest. The game \nIn all likelihood, from what Trump has said previously and the documents obtained recently, TPP won't be on the table in a meaningful way anytime soon. \nThat means that prices will most likely stay the same for footwear, and any hope for some relief from the problems pressuring giants like Nike will not abate soon. The possibility of greater sales while maintaining similar margins is out the window for sportswear companies who import the vast majority of its footwear. \nHowever, with TPP off the table, initiatives like Adidas' \"speedfactory\" in Atlanta seem more important than ever, as more advanced manufacturing methods means that high-tech factories in the US make more economical sense. \nThere's a potential for more \"made in the USA\" written under your shoe's tongue in the coming decades.",

Nike revealed the price of its first self-lacing athletic shoe, the HyperAdapt 1.0 -- a whopping $720. × Nike’s self-lacing HyperAdapt sneaker will cost you $720 Fans have been eagerly awaiting the debut of Nike's self-lacing sneakers. But they're not going to be cheap. Nike revealed the price of its first self-lacing athletic shoe, the HyperAdapt 1.0 -- a whopping $720. \nNEW YORK — Fans have been eagerly awaiting the debut of Nike’s self-lacing sneakers. But they’re not going to be cheap. \nNike revealed the price of its first self-lacing athletic shoe, the HyperAdapt 1.0 — a whopping $720. \nThe sneaker will be available in two NYC stores on Dec. 1: Nike’s Soho location and at the Nike+ ClubHouse. \nCustomers can book appointments there to try them on, or wait until later in December, when the sneakers are available at other stores and via the Nike+ app. \nSelect Nike+ app users will get early access to purchase the shoe on Nov. 28 for a limited time. \nThe black/white-blue lagoon color scheme will be available on Dec. 1 and a metallic silver/black-white sneaker will roll out later in the month. \nThe Nike HyperAdapt is the first self-lacing athletic shoe that Nike has released to the general public. \nIt’s different from the Nike Mag, which is a replica of the self-lacing shoes worn by Marty McFly in “Back to the Future.” Only 89 pairs of the Nike Mag were made available to fans via lottery. \nThe HyperAdapt sneakers will be lightweight and rechargeable. The self-lacing mechanism of the shoe works more like automatic buckling — the way snow boots or roller blades tighten. \n“When you step in, your heel will hit a sensor and the system will automatically tighten. Then there are two buttons on the side to tighten and loosen. You can adjust it until it’s perfect,” said Nike senior innovator Tiffany Beers. \nLED lights in the sole of the shoe display the shoe’s battery life, which lasts about two weeks. ",

      "text": "Shades of Green are great colors to wear during the Fall season, at least in my opinion. If you happen to think so as well, take a look at this Nike Internationalist Mid Utility rocking Olive Flak and Grove Green.\nThe version of the Internationalist comes in mid-top fashion while also being transformed into footwear that’s ready for the winter. The mid-top comes with an upper that has a weather-proof layer making it a great option for those rainy days. The blend of Olive Flak and Grove Green sitting on top of a White/Gum sole is a perfect look for the current season. Priced at $130, expect these to drops in the near future at a retailer near you.\n \nvia: Nike\nAuthor’s Take It’s hardly even cold and it hardly ever rains where I live. With that being said the shoe is nice enough for me to still want to wear a pair.\n\nAvailable Now on Kixify \nThe post The Nike Internationalist Mid Utility Perfect For the Fall appeared first on KicksOnFire.com .",

The idea comes from the French, who fondly named the ‘Hyper Blue’ TN from 1998 the ‘Le Requin’ (or ‘The Shark’) for its mean looking gradient. Now Nike are releasing two colourways, a light and a dark, as a nod to France’s sneaker culture. Both will be available from select Nike stockists on November 23.

      "text": "Nike (NKE) Unveils Price and Release Date For The Futuristic HyperAdapt 1.0 November 15, 2016, 03:52:00 PM EDT By Raymond Keane, Zacks.com Shutterstock photo \nOn Monday, Nike NKE unveiled the release date and price for their highly anticipated HyperAdapt 1.0 shoe. After months of speculation, it was reported that the revolutionary shoe will be released on December 1, at the steep price of $720. \nWhat makes this shoe so highly regarded is the new technology Nike has created that allows the shoe to self-lace itself. The idea is that the HyperAdapt 1.0 will be able to create a secure, unique feel for each individual. It will provide stability, support and style all while adjusting to the individual's foot. \nNike's CEO Mark Parker believes that this technology is going to change the sneaker world for the better. In an interview with CNBC , Parker stated, \"It's great to be able to put a product out there that is a step toward the future of adaptive performance. The performance that adapts to you real-time to suit your needs as an athlete is going to be a part of product more and more as we head into the future.\" \nA major issue for athletes, or anyone who loves sneakers, is the fact that not every shoe can fit each person's foot perfectly. Parker and his team of designers believe they have eliminated this issue. The goal, according to Nike designer Tinker Hatfield, is to develop a shoe that can sense when it needs to adjust itself. \"Wouldn't it be great if a shoe, in the future, could sense when you needed to have it tighter or looser? Could it take you even tighter than you'd normally go if it senses you really need extra snugness in a quick maneuver? That's where we're headed. In the future, product will come alive.\" This may be years down the line, but Nike is definitely heading in the right direction with the HyperAdapt 1.0 . \nThere are no reported sales projections for the HyperAdapt 1.0 , but the steep price for the product may turn some casual customers away. Considering this shoe is a first-of-its-kind product, it makes sense why it is retailing at $720. There will be plenty of sneaker heads ready to pay this steep price in order to get their hands on this remarkable pair of shoes. The shoes will be released in three sharp color ways , Metallic Silver/White-Black, Black/Blue Lagoon-Landscape-White, and White/White-White. \nCurrently, NKE is trading at an even $50.00 as of 12:45pm CT. Zacks Rank has Nike at a #3 (Hold) and a VGM grade of 'C'. Check back later in the week to see how Nike's Zack Rank may adjust. \nStocks that Aren't in the News…Yet \nYou are invited to download the full, up-to-the-minute list of 220 Zacks Rank #1 \"Strong Buys\" free of charge.

      "title": "Street Artist Redesigns New York Basketball Courts For Nike",
      "text": "Emma Hutchings 21 november 2016 \nNike has called on the Brooklyn-based, world-renowned street artist Kaws (whose real name is Brian Donnelly) to redesign basketball courts in New York. This project is part of the sportswear brand’s New York Made campaign, which will involve more community collaborations in the city. The campaign demonstrates Nike’s roots in NYC and its commitment to the city. New York Made: Stanton Street Courts by Kaws was made possible through a partnership with the New York City Parks and Recreation Department. \nTwo side-by-side full basketball courts (approximately 116 x 80 feet) and four hoops were painted in colorful murals. When Kaws moved to Manhattan in 1996 and lived on the corner of Clinton and Stanton Street, he often walked past the basketball courts, which are located at Sara D. Roosevelt Park in Manhattan’s Lower East Side. \nThe courts are said to embody Nike’s drive to elevate sport, culture and community through innovative collaborations. Kaws explained his idea for the design of the basketball courts in a news release : \n“My approach to the courts was very similar to how I would work on canvas. I wanted to create something that was true to my language, but also considerate of this being a court that people are playing on. I wanted to find the sweet spot where it works visually and functionally — how its broken up by the game’s lines and works with my images. It will have an intimate effect on the players that use the court.”",

      "text": "Twitter/_AndyHa \n\nIn an age when uniform and kit manufacturers such as Nike, Under Armour, and Adidas are constantly trying to outdo each other and win the affections of fans and players alike, the one thing we have learned is that anything goes.\nOne uniform color that has become far more common in recent years, starting with the popularity of the University of Oregon football team, is flourescent yellow. That has now spilled over into soccer, which led to one hilarious moment in England's League One.\nPeterborough United was playing Northampton this weekend and   Peterborough is one of the growing number of football teams with flourescent away kits. Unfortunately for Michael Bostwick, that is the same color worn by stewards at the game. \nRAW Embed \nThe irony here, of course, is that the stewards, who are on hand for safety reasons, wear flourescent so that they easily stand out. That no longer appears to be the case. \nLuckily for Bostwick, Peterborough went on to win 1-0. \nNOW WATCH: How Cubs president Theo Epstein ended two of baseball's longest World Series curses \n",

      "text": "A shoe that laces itself, and is more than just a novelty project. By Hayden Coplen \nThe roots of the HyperAdapt 1.0 can be traced all the way back to 1988, when Hollywood director Robert Zemeckis tapped two Nike designers for a brainstorming session on futuristic sneakers to include in the film. Now, the self-lacing props have an avatar in reality, with a shoe that improves athletic performance by providing the best fit for the task at hand. In the future, Nike hopes, the shoe will be able to sense when the wearer might need extra snugness and tighten at just the right time, or vice versa. \nFor now, a sensor automatically tightens the shoe when your heel steps in and small buttons on the side allow for adjustments — not a bad start as the future-is-now-the-present of footwear.",

      "text": "By Donwill November 21, 2016 2:14 PM Nike The Air Jordan 5 has had many mutations over the years, and while it wasn’t due for a makeover it’s definitely welcome. This premium version of the sneaker is dressed to the nines in some of the most supple suede imaginable. While the olive upper immediately brings to mind Jordan Brand’s UNDFTD collaborations this is a completely different beast. The pair loses the plastic mesh netting that graced the side and replaces it with wide-mouth perforations and lets the color extends to the midsole as well. A tanned leather tongue and deluxe triangular lace toggle finishes the look off in amazing fashion. These Air Jordan 5 Premiums are set to release sometime in 2017 and while we don’t know the price yet expect to pay a pretty penny to add these to your Nike collection. Nike",

      "text": "NEW YORK — Fans have been eagerly awaiting the debut of Nike’s self-lacing sneakers. But they’re not going to be cheap.\nNike revealed the price of its first self-lacing athletic shoe, the HyperAdapt 1.0 — a whopping $720.\nThe sneaker will be available in two NYC stores on Dec. 1: Nike’s Soho location and at the Nike+ ClubHouse.\nCustomers can book appointments there to try them on, or wait until later in December, when the sneakers are available at other stores and via the Nike+ app.\nSelect Nike+ app users will get early access to purchase the shoe on Nov. 28 for a limited time.\nThe black/white-blue lagoon color scheme will be available on Dec. 1 and a metallic silver/black-white sneaker will roll out later in the month.\nThe Nike HyperAdapt is the first self-lacing athletic shoe that Nike has released to the general public.\nIt’s different from the Nike Mag, which is a replica of the self-lacing shoes worn by Marty McFly in “Back to the Future.” Only 89 pairs of the Nike Mag were made available to fans via lottery.\nThe HyperAdapt sneakers will be lightweight and rechargeable. The self-lacing mechanism of the shoe works more like automatic buckling — the way snow boots or roller blades tighten.\n“When you step in, your heel will hit a sensor and the system will automatically tighten. Then there are two buttons on the side to tighten and loosen. You can adjust it until it’s perfect,” said Nike senior innovator Tiffany Beers.\nLED lights in the sole of the shoe display the shoe’s battery life, which lasts about two weeks\n40.712784 -74.005941 ",

      "text": "The Black colorway of the Nike LunarCharge just dropped, but Nike is wasting no time is unveiling a forthcoming colorway of one of their newest models. This time around the shoe is done in a Fall-appropriate Medium Olive colorway. Let’s get a first look at the shoe.\nThe Nike LunarCharge was created by blending a lot of traits of some of Nike most notable from silhouettes from their rich history. For example, the LunarCharge gets its overall structure from the Nike Air Flow. While the Nike Current, Air Max 90 and Presto were big inspirations in the overall look and feel of the shoe. A perfect blend of performance and lifestyle, the shoe also comes equipped with a one of a kind Lunarlon midsole for max comfort. Take a look at the shoe above and let us know if you plan on picking up a pair when Nike releases them on December 9th for $120. The shoe will release in both men’s and women’s sizes.\n \nAuthor’s Take I ned to try on a pair. I really like them, especially in this colorway. I think Nike’s got a winner with this one.\n\nAvailable Now on Kixify \nThe post The Nike LunarCharge Will Soon Release In This Medium Olive Colorway appeared first on KicksOnFire.com .",

      "text": "\nZella midi length leggings xxs, Nike free sneakers 5.5, old striped hoodie \nSan Francisco was a whirlwind this time around. Thank you guys again for all the recommendations, many of which we've added to our ever-growing list! If you're planning a visit soon and love to eat, definitely check out some of the helpful comments on this Instagram and see my past SF food diaries here and here . One of my favorite activities this time was actually morning runs around the city, through the Golden Gate Park and also to other mini landmarks. I'm  not a good runner and am huffing and puffing after half a mile, so it helped immensely to run with a friend who pushed aka tricked me into going further each time.\n\nTiled steps + Grand View Park (pictured above): For a free thigh workout, just run on a few upward sloping streets then finish by going up the tiled stairs to the overlook park. My legs were like jell-o the next day, but the stunning sunrise view over the city was completely worth it.\n\nStuart Weitzman boots sz 5 ( affordable dupe ), H&M dress xs (roomy fit)\nThierry Lasry \"lively\" sunglasses , Prada Saffiano Cuir bag \nHollow cafe : a cute, tiny little spot not far from the tiled steps with yummy coffee and supposedly good pastries (we were too full to try their signature Guinness cupcakes!). Sweater dress here is borrowed from my friend. It's apparently the same one as my cream dress worn in this post  but in a dark green, which I didn't see online!\n\n\nRooster & Rice : We mostly ate at quick spots this trip that didn't require reservations. The food here is super simple but is comfort food for many, esp. if you like Hainanese chicken. The boxes here consist of poached chicken (you can get this boneless skinless) over rice, a savory chili ginger and garlic sauce, hot broth on the side, and the option to add an egg. Be sure to try the hot sauce!\n\n\nBob's donuts : I realized I had posted this last weekend with zero explanation about the torso-sized donut! So I admit I went to Bob's mostly for the photo opp, expecting it to be a gimmicky place since donuts this large couldn't possibly be tasty. The hole-in-the-wall shop is open 24hrs but the biggies only come out of the fryer every few hours, and tend to go fast (you'll see a line forming outside). I called ahead to find out timing and you can also stop by and reserve one in advance. Maybe it was because it was warm and fresh out of the fryer, but the donut was surprisingly delicious and got devoured (the big ones are only $9 and will feed at least six lol). The apple fritters were also fresh at the time and oh-so-good ... even my typically anti-sweets friends kept sneaking bites and asking for more!\n\n\nAina : Heard the wait can get up to hours here on the weekends, so we popped by on a weekday right when they opened and were seated right away! The food is hawaiian fusion style, so they have twists on traditional dishes like spam musubi (pictured above in the lettus wrap) and loco moco (done with braised shortrib instead of hamburger). Our table loved the malasadas in the top right ... warm, portuguese-style donuts dusted with coconut sugar and filled with guava custard!\n\n\nMyMy : We were in the Nob hill area craving brunch, and this turned out to be a solid spot with lots of breakfast and especially benedict choices. The Baja benedict above with crab and grilled shrimp (and those crispy hash brown sheets...mmm) is a little splurge for breakfast at $20ish, but not a bite went to waste!\n\n\nExpress tunic xxs, Gucci soho disco bag , Topshop jeans 25x30 \nSometimes you just crave a good old-fashioned burger, especially after a fuzzy morning of wine tasting. Gott's Roadside  in both SF and Napa hit the spot. Their Caesar salad was a little over-cheesed for me (hard to see the greens under that snowbank of parmesan) but their burgers (both a regular and a kimcheese burger are pictured above) and garlic fries were just what we needed. The milkshakes are also deliciously thick and creamy but very indulgent, so share with a friend or two! ",

      "title": "Should Nike Endorse Models Along with Athletes? (NKE)",
      "text": "The Nike Ad Controversy (NKE) By Dan Moskowitz | November 21, 2016 — 3:33 PM EST \nIf you’re not familiar with Bella Hadid, she’s a 20-year-old supermodel that is now being endorsed by NIKE, Inc. ( NKE ). When she excitedly shared this news on Instagram, she was met with backlash surrounding the idea that she was too skinny and that Nike should instead be endorsing a athlete. \nAccording to Yolanda Hadid, Bella’s mother and formerly of the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills , Bella had competed in equestrian riding most of her life, but that dream was crushed when she was diagnosed with Lyme disease, which causes fatigue and has the potential to fog the brain. In most cases, you don’t want to mount a horse with a fogged brain. According to Bella herself, she works out three hours per day. If that’s true, then whether or not she can be classified as an athlete is subjective. (See also, Nike's Futuristic Shoes: All Hype? ) \nBella might be deemed too skinny to be a part of the Nike team, but there are tens of millions of Americans who are considered “too skinny.” Bella may not be the traditional athlete, but if only traditional athletes wore Nike, then it would severely limit the company’s reach. Nike is smarter than that. All shapes and sizes already wear Nike, and this helps reinforce the following message to consumers: you don’t need to be an athlete to wear Nike. \nIf you read between the lines—and look at the Bella Hadid Nike ads—you will realize that Nike is using Bella Hadid as a way to increase its athleisure presence, but it’s adding a twist by being a little risqué with those ads, which gives it some differentiation compared to other athleisure brands. Nike is a savvy company, and it’s always looking at the big picture and playing the long game. This has always been the case, and it will likely never change. \nNKE has depreciated 22.84% over the past 12 months and currently offers a dividend yield of 1.28%.",

      "title": "NIKE (NKE) Hikes Dividend, Bolsters Shareholders' Confidence",
      "text": "NIKE (NKE) Hikes Dividend, Bolsters Shareholders' Confidence November 21, 2016, 07:44:00 AM EDT By Zacks Equity Research, Zacks.com Shutterstock photo \nNIKE, Inc. NKE has time and again proved its commitment toward enhancing shareholder value, aided by its strong financial position. Apart from making regular dividend payments, the company has also made share repurchases to improve shareholder returns. Incidentally, over the last 14 years, the company has distributed and raised dividends regularly, alongside making share repurchases to improve shareholder returns. Recently, the swoosh brand announced a 13% hike in its quarterly cash dividend to 18 cents per share. The new dividend, applicable for Nike's Class A and B shares, will be paid on Jan 3, 2017, to shareholders on record as of Dec 5, 2016. Notably, this represents the company's fifteenth consecutive year of dividend hike, further underscoring its healthy cash flows and robust potential. Additionally, Nike repurchased 19 million shares for $1.1 billion in the last reported quarter, under its $12 billion share repurchase program approved in Nov 2015. With this, the company had repurchased about 39 million shares for roughly $2.2 billion under the program. Apart from Nike, many other companies like Sysco Corporation SYY , Tractor Supply Company TSCO and Avis Budget Group, Inc. CAR follow these practices to strengthen their commitment toward shareholders. As part of some recent developments, Sysco Corporation announced a 6% hike in its quarterly dividend to 33 cents per share, which marked this food company's 48th hike. Further, farm and ranch-store retailer, Tractor Supply raised its share buyback authorization by $1 billion, thereby bringing its current total authorization to $3 billion. Finally, car-rental company, Avis Budget announced an increase of $250 million to its buyback authorization, thus making shares worth nearly $400 million available for repurchase from Oct 1, 2016 onward. Dividend hike is a prudent strategy used by companies with a stable cash position and solid future prospects. This is because dividend increases not only enhance shareholder returns but also raise the market value of the stock. Hence, companies bank on this strategy to bolster investors' confidence in the stock, thereby persuading them to either buy or hold the scrip instead of selling it. Coming back to Nike, we believe that its solid initiatives will not only help augment shareholder returns, but also enhance the company's goodwill and enable it to tackle peer competition. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

      "text": "Nike’s self-lacing HyperAdapt sneaker will cost you $720 CNN Wire \nNEW YORK — Fans have been eagerly awaiting the debut of Nike’s self-lacing sneakers. But they’re not going to be cheap. \nNike revealed the price of its first self-lacing athletic shoe, the HyperAdapt 1.0 — a whopping $720. \nThe sneaker will be available in two NYC stores on Dec. 1: Nike’s Soho location and at the Nike+ ClubHouse. \nCustomers can book appointments there to try them on, or wait until later in December, when the sneakers are available at other stores and via the Nike+ app. \nSelect Nike+ app users will get early access to purchase the shoe on Nov. 28 for a limited time. \nThe black/white-blue lagoon color scheme will be available on Dec. 1 and a metallic silver/black-white sneaker will roll out later in the month. \nThe Nike HyperAdapt is the first self-lacing athletic shoe that Nike has released to the general public. \nIt’s different from the Nike Mag, which is a replica of the self-lacing shoes worn by Marty McFly in “Back to the Future.” Only 89 pairs of the Nike Mag were made available to fans via lottery. \nThe HyperAdapt sneakers will be lightweight and rechargeable. The self-lacing mechanism of the shoe works more like automatic buckling — the way snow boots or roller blades tighten. \n“When you step in, your heel will hit a sensor and the system will automatically tighten. Then there are two buttons on the side to tighten and loosen. You can adjust it until it’s perfect,” said Nike senior innovator Tiffany Beers. \nLED lights in the sole of the shoe display the shoe’s battery life, which lasts about two weeks 40.712784 -74.005941 ",

      "text": "Some of the shoes meant to be used in the Rio 2016 Olympics recovered from Olympics deputy chef de mission Ben Ekumbo's house at Duplex Apartment, along Prof Saitoti Avenue. By Angira Zadock and Ayumba Ayodi Officers from the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) on Monday recovered bales of Team Kenya uniforms supplied by Nike when they raided the residence of Ben Ekumbo, the deputy chief of mission of Team Kenya for the Rio Olympics. The officers recovered boxes containing shoes, tracksuits and bags from Ekumbo's house at Duplex Apartments on Professor Saitoti Avenue in Westlands, Nairobi. Police officers said the raid was part of their investigations into the Rio Olympic Games scandal that saw officials embezzle funds meant for Team Kenya use at the 2016 Olympics. Ekumbo, who is also the Kenya Swimming Federation chairman, was at his house when DCI officers raided it. Team Kenya's Chef of Mission to the Olympics Stephen Soi, overall team manager Pius Ochieng and National Olympic Committee of Kenya (NOC-K) Secretary-General Francis Paul as well as National Olympics Committee of Kenya Treasurer Fridah Shiroya have already been charged over the mismanagement of Team Kenya at the Rio Olympics. Cabinet Secretary for Sports Hassan Wario in September disbanded NOC-K before shifting its operations to Sports Kenya. Wario went ahead to form a Probe Committee to investigate the mismanagement surrounding Team Kenya at the Rio Summer Games. The committee, led by Paul Ochieng, handed in its report to Wario three weeks ago. Ochieng also handed over the report to President Uhuru Kenyatta, who is due to release it this week. Despite the mismanagement, Team Kenya still produced their best ever results at the Olympics, winning six gold medals, six silver and one bronze medal. Already, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) has ordered for fresh elections at NOC-K before December 31, 2017 under a new constitution. IOC came with the directive after a meeting involving its officials, Wario and NOC-K chairman Kipchoge Keino.
