      "text": "Apple's iPhone 7 and 7 Plus were the best-selling smartphones in Great Britain and the U.S. in September, according to market research firm Kantar. They bested Samsung's Galaxy Note 7, which the company has since recalled. More Apple’s most recent earnings report hinted at tough times ahead — the company reported iPhone shipments of 45 million and $28 billion in profit for the quarter, down about 5.3 percent and 12.6 percent, respectively, from the same quarter last year. But some territories, particularly the United States and Great Britain, bucked the downward trend. According to market research firm Kantar , the Cupertino, California-based company’s iPhone 7 and 7 Plus were the countries’ best-selling smartphones in September.\nLast quarter, Apple’s top-of-the-line iPhone models made up 17.1 percent of all handsets sold in Great Britain and 15.1 percent of those sold in the U.S., Kantar Consumer Insight Director Lauren Guenveur reported. “In the U.S., the new [iPhone] models made an impact,” she wrote. And they performed especially well in Britain. Strength across Apple’s iPhone portfolio drove sales of iOS devices to 40.6 percent — a 2.4 percent increase from the same period a year ago. Kantar reported that the iPhone SE performed especially well, representing 8.5 percent of sales in the country.\nMore: Apple’s iPhone nabbed 104 percent of the smartphone industry profits this past quarter\nBut it wasn’t just Apple’s new crop of devices that flew off the shelves. The iPhone 6s was the second best-selling device in the U.S. in September, contributing to an overall growth of iOS sales in the country to 34.2 percent.\nSales were boosted in part by the popularity of large-screen devices. Kantar said that 47 percent of smartphone owners cited the size of the screen as the main driver of their satisfaction. And the continued travails of one of Apple’s biggest competitors helped, too. According to Kantar, sales of the beleaguered Samsung Galaxy Note 7, which has since been recalled, posted a year-on-year decline from 36.9 percent to 33.8 percent of U.S. smartphone sales in the third quarter.\nThe firm projects a difficult quarter ahead for the Seoul, South Korea-based smartphone maker. “The holiday sales season may prove to be more challenging than normal for Samsung, who competes head to head with Apple during this crucial time of year,” Kantar reported. “Fallout from the Note 7 recall could have an unintended impact on continuing sales of other, similarly named Samsung devices (chiefly the Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge), as consumers may not always understand the difference between model names.”\nMore: Apple beats fourth-quarter revenue estimates, but sees iPhone sales fall\nWord of the iPhone 7’s growth may help allay fears among investors that shipments would suffer through the holiday season. Kantar noted that constrained supply, especially in China, played a major part in iPhone’s weaker-than-expected third quarter performance. “[With] supply constrained on the iPhone 7, and particularly the 7 Plus, this positive turn for Apple is a good sign, suggesting that as supply grows to meet demand, Apple will be able to turn the tide in urban China.”\nDuring its most recent earnings conference, Apple noted that iPhone sales were “up” year-on-year in “33 of [the] top 40” markets. “Our results for the September quarter were very strong,” CEO Tim Cook said. “We’re thrilled with the customer response to iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus: these are the best iPhones we’ve ever made.”\nThe best iPhone 7 deals for November The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus will be difficult to find in stores on Friday",

      "text": "The photo editor that won Apple's App of the Year is available for Windows users. Affinity Photo is free during public beta testing, including several new features not yet on the iOS version. More The advanced image editor that took Apple’s App of the Year in 2015 is now making its way onto PCs. On Wednesday, Serif announced the public beta testing of Affinity Photo for Windows.\nConsidered by many to be a worthwhile Photoshop competitor, the public beta version brings all of the non-destructive image edits to the Windows platform. Serif, a company based in the U.K., is offering a free download of the beta version during the software’s public testing.\nMore: Affinity Photo’s upcoming version 1.5 could give Photoshop a run for its money\nThe Windows version includes both the tried-and-true options on the iOS version but also adds several tools that won’t be available on iOS until the release of Affinity Photo 1.5. An editing mode allows for all the tools to be used on 360-degree images, going through the same steps to apply those changes but allowing users to scroll around the complete 360-degree perspective within the workspace.\nThe beta version also brings a new advanced HDR edit that churns out full 32-bit color images as well as a new merge option for using the focus stacking technique for a sharper image. The pre-release also adds batch processing to speed up edits on groups of photos, a feature not yet available in the iOS version.\nSerif says that, along with the new features that are also coming to the future Mac version, the Windows version matches the company’s iOS award winner.\nMore: Affinity teases its impressive Photoshop competitor running on a 12.9-inch iPad Pro\n“When we started developing our Affinity apps nearly seven years ago, one of the key aims was to be cross-platform, so this is a huge milestone for us,” said Ashley Hewson, Affinity’s managing director. “Because we did plan for this from the beginning, we made nearly all of our back-end code — the core engine of Affinity, if you like — completely operating system independent. That not only means that file compatibility between the two platforms is 100 percent perfect, but all the power, performance, tools and accuracy which have really set us apart on Mac are there for Windows users to enjoy now too.”\nDuring the beta period, users will be able to test the software for free and have the chance to offer their feedback. After the beta period, Serif says the Windows version will match the iOS version’s $50 one-time price.\nMiss paying for film?

      "text": "By Reuters / Reuters  33   \n(Nov 11): Bank stocks and ind us trials surged on Thursday while Apple and other technology shares sank as Wall Street rearranged its bets to benefit from Donald Trump's presidency. \nThe S&P 500 financial sector surged 4 percent to its highest level since the 2008 financial crisis, bringing its gain since Trump's surprise victory in Tuesday's election to 8.1 percent. That put it on track for its biggest two-day gain since 2011. \nWells Fargo & Co jumped 7.6 percent, JPMorgan Chase rallied 4.66 percent and Bank of America surged 5.34 percent, also helped by a rise bond yields that are the result of expectations of inflationary spending by Trump. \nTrump has also sided with leading conservatives in calling for the repeal of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Financial Reform Act largely opposed by banks. \n\"The Trump campaign did say it would repeal Dodd-Frank. Rates are higher and the yield curve is steeper. Those are all good things for the banks,\" said Warren West, principal at Greentree Brokerage Services in Philadelphia. \nApple dropped 2 percent while Amazon.com fell 3.65 percent and the S&P 500 technology index fell 1.1 percent. \nAt 2:28 pm ET, the Dow Jones ind us trial average was up 1.39 percent at 18,847.8 points and the S&P 500 had gained 0.49 percent to 2,173.84. \nThe Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.43 percent to 5,228.41. \nHigh-dividend sectors utilities, telecom services and consumer staples sold off as bond yields rose due to expectations of higher interest rates. \nThe market got a lift after St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said the Republican sweep of the White Ho us e and Congress could break the current gridlock over national policy in a potential boon to the U.S. economy. \nInd us trials trailed the financials with a 2.15 percent advance. \nMacy's rose 5.9 percent after the department store operator raised its full-year sales forecast and announced a partnership to monetize some of its real-estate assets. \nWalt Disney and Nordstrom were expected to report earnings after the market closes. \nDeclining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.02-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.67-to-1 ratio favored advancers. \nThe S&P 500 posted 82 new 52-week highs and 6 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 320 new highs and 40 new lows. - Reuters Related Articles",

      "text": "Tim Cook wrote a letter to Apple’s American employees following Trump’s presidential win \nRose Behar \nNovember 10, 2016 2:53pm \nFollowing the U.S’s divisive November 8th election — which saw Republican candidate Donald Trump defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton to become the President-elect — Apple CEO Tim Cook felt moved to address the situation in a letter to his American staff. \nThe letter, obtained by Buzzfeed News , encourages employees to “move forward together” regardless of their political affiliation, while also affirming Apple’s commitment to diversity. \nIn June 2016, Apple refused to fund the Republican Convention , a move that put them at odds with Facebook, Google and Microsoft, which all indicated they would provide some support. \nBelow is the full text of the letter. \nTeam, \nI’ve heard from many of you today about the presidential election. In a political contest where the candidates were so different and each received a similar number of popular votes, it’s inevitable that the aftermath leaves many of you with strong feelings. \nWe have a very diverse team of employees, including supporters of each of the candidates. Regardless of which candidate each of us supported as individuals, the only way to move forward is to move forward together. I recall something Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. said 50 years ago: “If you can’t fly, then run. If you can’t run, then walk. If you can’t walk, then crawl, but whatever you do you have to keep moving forward.” This advice is timeless, and a reminder that we only do great work and improve the world by moving forward. \nWhile there is discussion today about uncertainties ahead, you can be confident that Apple’s North Star hasn’t changed. Our products connect people everywhere, and they provide the tools for our customers to do great things to improve their lives and the world at large. Our company is open to all, and we celebrate the diversity of our team here in the United States and around the world — regardless of what they look like, where they come from, how they worship or who they love. \nI’ve always looked at Apple as one big family and I encourage you to reach out to your co-workers if they are feeling anxious. \nLet’s move forward — together! \nBest, Source Buzzfeed News John W \nAs much as i am not the largest Apple fan, I like this sentiment. I’m not so sure its news worthy, but it is good to see a company trying to take politics out of business to some degree. Andrew English \nTim Cook is trying to do that with the employees he know what Donald Trump is going to do delinquent companies like Apple who have moved all their manufacturing outside of the US. Not to mention Apple has never paid any taxes in the US and this is because of NAFTA which Trump wants to ratify or get rid of all together. \nUm, I’m not sure which letter you read but this one is about diversity and not manufacturing. beyond \nNo way, if you read the letter backwards it’s definitely a warning message. It also provides instructions on preparing for the zombie apocalypse.. The Iceman Cometh \nTrump hasn’t paid diddly in taxes either so it’s rather the pot calling the kettle. The man has no credibility on this issue whatsoever nor any moral authority It’s Me \nNot sure even a single line of that rant is factual.

      "text": "By Reuters / Reuters  34   \n(Nov 11): Bank stocks and ind us trials surged on Thursday while Apple and other technology shares sank as Wall Street rearranged its bets to benefit from Donald Trump's presidency. \nThe S&P 500 financial sector surged 4 percent to its highest level since the 2008 financial crisis, bringing its gain since Trump's surprise victory in Tuesday's election to 8.1 percent. That put it on track for its biggest two-day gain since 2011. \nWells Fargo & Co jumped 7.6 percent, JPMorgan Chase rallied 4.66 percent and Bank of America surged 5.34 percent, also helped by a rise bond yields that are the result of expectations of inflationary spending by Trump. \nTrump has also sided with leading conservatives in calling for the repeal of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Financial Reform Act largely opposed by banks. \n\"The Trump campaign did say it would repeal Dodd-Frank. Rates are higher and the yield curve is steeper. Those are all good things for the banks,\" said Warren West, principal at Greentree Brokerage Services in Philadelphia. \nApple dropped 2 percent while Amazon.com fell 3.65 percent and the S&P 500 technology index fell 1.1 percent. \nAt 2:28 pm ET, the Dow Jones ind us trial average was up 1.39 percent at 18,847.8 points and the S&P 500 had gained 0.49 percent to 2,173.84. \nThe Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.43 percent to 5,228.41. \nHigh-dividend sectors utilities, telecom services and consumer staples sold off as bond yields rose due to expectations of higher interest rates. \nThe market got a lift after St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said the Republican sweep of the White Ho us e and Congress could break the current gridlock over national policy in a potential boon to the U.S. economy. \nInd us trials trailed the financials with a 2.15 percent advance. \nMacy's rose 5.9 percent after the department store operator raised its full-year sales forecast and announced a partnership to monetize some of its real-estate assets. \nWalt Disney and Nordstrom were expected to report earnings after the market closes. \nDeclining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.02-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.67-to-1 ratio favored advancers. \nThe S&P 500 posted 82 new 52-week highs and 6 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 320 new highs and 40 new lows. - Reuters Related Articles",

      "text": "Read the email Apple's Tim Cook wrote to his employees about the election \nby: Debbie Lord, Cox Media Group National Content Desk Updated: Nov 10, 2016 - 10:58 AM The day after Donald Trump won the 2016 presidential election, Apple CEO Tim Cook sent an email to the 76,000 Apple employees in the United States, urging them to “move forward together” after an often contentious election. He, along with other American CEOs, made the move to talk to employees either before or after Tuesday’s election. Here’s Cook’s email, which was published by Buzzfeed : “Team, I’ve heard from many of you today about the presidential election. In a political contest where the candidates were so different and each received a similar number of popular votes, it’s inevitable that the aftermath leaves many of you with strong feelings. We have a very diverse team of employees, including supporters of each of the candidates. Regardless of which candidate each of us supported as individuals, the only way to move forward is to move forward together. I recall something Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. said 50 years ago: “If you can’t fly, then run. If you can’t run, then walk. If you can’t walk, then crawl, but whatever you do you have to keep moving forward.” This advice is timeless, and a reminder that we only do great work and improve the world by moving forward. While there is discussion today about uncertainties ahead, you can be confident that Apple’s North Star hasn’t changed. Our products connect people everywhere, and they provide the tools for our customers to do great things to improve their lives and the world at large. Our company is open to all, and we celebrate the diversity of our team here in the United States and around the world — regardless of what they look like, where they come from, how they worship or who they love. I’ve always looked at Apple as one big family and I encourage you to reach out to your co-workers if they are feeling anxious. Let’s move forward — together! Best, Tim” Jamie Dimon, the CEO of J.P. Morgan Chase, sent this email to his employees, according to Reuters : “Dear colleagues, We are going through a period of profound political and economic change around the world, and American citizens showed that deep desire for change in voting to elect Donald Trump as the 45th President of the United States. We have heard through democratic processes in both Europe and the United States the frustration that so many people have with the lack of economic opportunity and the challenges they face. We need to listen to those voices. We have just been through one of the most contentious elections in memory, which can make it even harder to put our differences aside. But that makes it more important than ever to bind the wounds of our nation and to bring together Americans from all walks of life. Recognizing that our diversity is a core strength of our nation, we must all come together as fellow patriots to solve our most serious challenges. Leaders from across the public, private and nonprofit sectors need to collaborate to find meaningful solutions that create economic growth and greater opportunity for all. America is best when we come together with clear leadership, expertise and the political will to take on difficult challenges and get things done. No one should ever doubt the strength and resilience of our country and our democracy. J.P. Morgan Chase has a proud history of supporting our communities and our countries. Through your outstanding efforts, we have built a great company that will continue to thrive – as we continue to focus on helping to serve our clients and communities. We will also continue to help address the important public policy issues of the day and the underlying economic challenges throughout the world. I’m optimistic about America’s future and the role our company will continue to play as we help the nation address our challenges and move forward together. Jamie” Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz sent his employees an email prior to the election. “Dear partners, It's a rainy Sunday morning in Seattle, we've turned the clocks back an hour, and I'm enjoying a French Press of my favorite coffee, Aged Sumatra. I woke up this morning feeling a bit anxious about Tuesday's election. Regardless of the outcome, our nation will feel divided. Many Americans have allowed the vitriolic nature of the presidential campaign to ignite our differences and strip away our civility and dignity. In the process, we've lost faith in what we all know has always been true, the promise of America. But you are the true promise of America. My faith in you has me more optimistic than ever. Today, I'm not talking about our business or the Starbucks brand. I'm talking about you as a person. As a mother, a father, a daughter, a son, a sister, a brother, a neighbor, a citizen. I also am talking about we as people. We as Americans. And, I am talking about the people who have come before us, those who sacrificed so much to give us a better life than the lives they had. Each of us has a great responsibility to those who preceded us, as well as to \"pay it forward\" for the next generation. So what can we do? What will we do? In the face of this epic, unseemly election and the concern we all share about the direction of our country and the lack of truth and void of leadership, we can still make a difference in the lives of the people we touch and influence every day. Kindness, compassion, empathy, and yes love is what we need. It is what we must display and share. We are all longing for a deeper sense of human connection and humanity because, when we are touched by it, it fills us up. Start today by recognizing the power we have to walk in someone else's shoes, to demonstrate understanding, and to strip away the differences that divide us. Let's each embrace the universal virtues of respect and dignity, refusing to allow the hatred on cable news, the ugliness of our politics, and the lack of political role models for our kids to define us and to dictate how we treat each other. Rise above this moment to be the person that makes a positive difference in your neighborhood and community. Be the person who makes your family proud. Be the person who embodies the promise of America so others may see and feel the possibilities that come with being an American—today, tomorrow, and long after this Tuesday. Like the drawing of so many faces with a single, unbroken line on this season's green unity cup, we are all connected. On this Sunday, wherever you are, whatever you are doing, know that I send you my love and respect. Proud, as always, to be your partner, ",

      "text": "Image via Apple.com\nAfter a 4-year hiatus, Apple just rolled out their new MacBook Pro notebook line to a decidedly mixed reception. Its new line consists of 13-inch and 15-inch versions in a slightly smaller and lighter forms, weighing 3 and 4 pounds respectively.\nTouch Bar, available as a $300 option on the 13-inch and standard on the 15-inch, is a narrow ribbon-like color touch display that replaces the function row keys. The Touch Bar display changes based on the application you’re running, assuming the application supports it. It's clever, but somewhat gimmicky, and requires taking your eyes off the screen. In one use, Apple showed how you could scroll through little thumbnails of your photos displayed across it, but they were each about the size of an aspirin. With other applications, virtual keys, sliders and other icons may appear.\nThe other major change to the new MacBook Pros is the elimination of the standard USB and video connectors, as well as the loss of the SD memory card slot and the MagSafe power connector. That’s the clever charging connector that breaks away from the computer if the power cord is yanked by mistake, preventing the computer from falling to the floor.\nIn their place are multiple USB-type C-connectors that support charging, video, USB and most other uses. But you will need a dongle to connect. Because of the loud outcries, Apple has reduced the initial pricing of these dongles, but they still cost from $10 to $80 each and need to be carried with you to connect to your other devices. Unlike the iPhones, the audio headphone jack is retained, but now there’s no way to plug your iPhone into a new Pro without buying a new dongle. If yo visit an Apple Store there's now a wall-full of assorted dongles.\nIf you’re set on buying a Mac, these are good, solid, well-built machines, but pricey. The 13-inch model without Touch Bar and with 256GB of storage costs $1500. The 15-inch version comes only with the Touch Bar and starts at a whopping $2400.\nBut if these steep prices turn you off, as they have with many, consider some of the latest computers running Windows 10 from Dell and HP. Each has a chassis design that is similar to Apple’s, with the entire unit constructed of aluminum. In fact, they all look so similar I had to do a double take when I first saw them.\nNext page: some good non-Mac options\nhttps://pjmedia.com/lifestyle/2016/11/10/whats-new-in-notebooks/\nprevious Page 1 of 2 next View as single page",

      "text": "Tweet Share Daniel S. Loeb, founder of Third Point LLC, participates in a panel discussion during the Skybridge Alternatives (SALT) Conference in Las Vegas, Nevada May 9, 2012. SALT brings together public policy officials, capital allocators, and hedge fund managers to discuss financial markets. REUTERS/Steve Marcus (UNITED STATES - Tags: BUSINESS) - RTR31UF4 More NEW YORK (Reuters) - Dan Loeb's Third Point hedge fund took a new share stake in Apple Inc, Visa Inc and Dell Inc during the third quarter, according to regulatory filings late on Thursday. Third Point, closely followed in the investment community because of its pattern of delivering strong returns, took a 2.5 million stake in Apple, a 2.1 million class A share-stake in Visa and a 2.3 million share-stake in Dell Technologies. In early November, Loeb told clients that Third Point's bets on corporate debt issued by Dell and Sprint Corp ranked among the year's top winners for the firm. Through the end of September, the Third Point Offshore fund gained 7.2 percent, beating the average fund's 4 percent return. Loeb's Third Point also increased its share stake in Facebook Inc by 45.3 percent to 5.5 million class A shares, according to regulatory filings. In addition, the fund increased its stake in Alphabet Inc by 37.5 percent to 550,000 class A capital stock shares, the filings said. Third Point also took a 2.6 million sponsored ADS stake in Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, according to the regulatory filings. (Reporting By Jennifer Ablan; Editing by Sandra Maler) Reblog",

The new emoji are based on requests from third-parties to the consortium over the past year and include emoji representing breastfeeding and a hijab emoji, as well as many others (via Emojipedia ). \nIn total, there are 36 new face emoji coming as part of Unicode 10. Included in those are emoji for a”grinning face with star eyes,”“smiling face with hand putting on makeup,”“grinning face with crazy eyes, ”“face with open mouth vomiting,” and “shocked face with exploding head.” Those are jut a few of the new face emoji, though the full list can be viewed here . \nOther additions include an emoji for breastfeeding, as well as emoji depicting palms raised up together. Furthermore, there are a variety of new food emoji, including ones for a bowl with soup, coconut, broccoli, pie, pretzel, sandwich, and canned food. \nIn terms of animals, there are now giraffe and zebra emoji, as well as a hedgehog, sauropod, t-rex, and cricket. As far as people go, there’s now a “bearded person,”“person with headscarf,”“person in steamy room,” person climbing,”“person in lotus position,” and “face with monocle.” \nLast but not least, there are a handful of other random new emoji, including: Fairy",

With mixer running on low, slowly incorporate wet ingredients. Mix until batter is just combined and no streaks remain. Using a large cookie scoop, divide batter between prepared muffin cavities. Bake for 15-18 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Immediately turn out onto a baking sheet. Melt butter in medium bowl. Combine remaining granulated sugar and cinnamon. Coat each muffin in melted butter and then roll in cinnamon sugar. Cool on wire rack. \nYield: 10 muffins ",

      "text": "Daniel Loeb's Third Point Invests Again in Apple, Drops Energy Names November 10, 2016, 06:10:  By Lauren Pollock \nDaniel Loeb's Third Point LLC invested again in Apple Inc. in the third quarter, while eliminating its position in a number of energy companies. \nThe New York hedge fund reported a stake worth $282.6 million in Apple as of Sept. 30. Apple shares have declined 7.7% over the past 12 months, leading some high-profile investors, such as Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc., to take advantage of the slide to buy up shares in recent months. \nIn other moves disclosed Thursday, Third Point eliminated its positions in exploration-and-production firm Marathon Oil Corp., energy producer Devon Energy Corp. and refiner Tesoro Corp., among other names in the energy sector. \nShares of Marathon and Devon have surged this year as oil prices have steadied and the energy sector stages a recovery. Tesoro, however, is down 20% year to date. \nThird Point's positions were disclosed in a 13F filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, a quarterly requirement for investors managing more than $100 million. The report indicates the number of shares held and the value of each stake at the end of the quarter. Monday is the filing deadline. \nWrite to Lauren Pollock at lauren.pollock@wsj.com (END) Dow Jones Newswires 11-10-161810ET Copyright (c) 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.",

In addition, the fund increased its stake in Alphabet Inc by 37.5 percent to 550,000 class A capital stock shares, the filings said. \nThird Point also took a 2.6 million sponsored ADS stake in Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, according to the regulatory filings. \n(Reporting By Jennifer Ablan; Editing by Sandra Maler) Next In Funds News",

In addition, the fund increased its stake in Alphabet Inc by 37.5 percent to 550,000 class A capital stock shares, the filings said. \nThird Point upped its stake in Monsanto Co by 85 percent to 3.7 million shares, while the hedge fund dissolved its share stake in Marathon Oil Corp during the third quarter, filings said. \nThird Point also took a 2.6 million sponsored ADS stake in Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, according to the regulatory filings. \nThe quarterly disclosures of manager stock holdings, in what are known as 13F filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, are always intriguing for investors trying to divine a pattern in what savvy traders are selling and buying. \nBut relying on the filings to develop an investment strategy comes with some peril because the disclosures are backward looking and come out 45 days after the end of each quarter. \nStill, the records offer a glimpse into what hedge fund managers saw as opportunities to make money on the long side. The filings do not disclose short positions, bets that a stock will fall in price. And there is also little disclosure on bonds and other securities that do not trade on exchanges. \n(Reporting By Jennifer Ablan; Editing by Sandra Maler and Andrew Hay) Related Links",

      "text": "\nAs America reels from the fallout of U.S. president-elect Donald Trump’s win last Tuesday, Apple CEO Tim Cook released a company-wide memo addressing the unrest and among the tech giant’s employees. The letter, released on Wednesday evening, reiterated Apple’s stance on possible issues that would emerge from a Trump presidency, most especially diversity in the workplace.\nThe brief memo , originally obtained by BuzzFeed News , directly addresses the possible feelings of unrest that several of the tech giant’s employees are currently feeling. Since Trump’s decisive win over Democratic bet Hillary Clinton in Tuesday’s elections, numerous groups in the United States, composed of immigrants, people of color and the LGBTQ community, have expressed their reservations about the coming years ahead.\nIn the memo, Cook urged the company’s employees to stand firm and be strong. Quoting one of the most influential men in U.S. history, Dr. Martin Luther King, the Apple CEO urged everyone working in Apple to “keep moving forward” despite whatever circumstances might happen in the future. The CEO also asserted that nothing will change in Apple’s stance regarding issues that might arise after president-elect Trump takes office early next year.\nFollowing is the full text of Cook’s company-wide memo to Apple employees.\nTeam,\nI’ve heard from many of you today about the presidential election. In a political contest where the candidates were so different and each received a similar number of popular votes, it’s inevitable that the aftermath leaves many of you with strong feelings.\nWe have a very diverse team of employees, including supporters of each of the candidates. Regardless of which candidate each of us supported as individuals, the only way to move forward is to move forward together. I recall something Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. said 50 years ago: “If you can’t fly, then run. If you can’t run, then walk. If you can’t walk, then crawl, but whatever you do you have to keep moving forward.” This advice is timeless, and a reminder that we only do great work and improve the world by moving forward.\nWhile there is discussion today about uncertainties ahead, you can be confident that Apple’s North Star hasn’t changed. Our products connect people everywhere, and they provide the tools for our customers to do great things to improve their lives and the world at large. Our company is open to all, and we celebrate the diversity of our team here in the United States and around the world — regardless of what they look like, where they come from, how they worship or who they love.\nI’ve always looked at Apple as one big family and I encourage you to reach out to your co-workers if they are feeling anxious.\nLet’s move forward — together!\nBest,\nTim\nApple has been a target of Donald Trump’s criticism for a while now, with the president-elect specifically pointing out the tech giant’s outsourcing of labor for its products as one of the biggest causes of problems in America’s labor sector. Over the course of his campaign, president-elect Donald Trump has been very firm on his stance of requiring American companies to manufacture their products on American soil. Apple, whose most popular products such as the iPhone are manufactured in China, became one of Trump’s biggest targets.\n[Image by Mark Wilson/Getty Images] This culminated in a fiery declaration back in January, when Trump boldly declared that once he becomes president, he would force Apple to start manufacturing its products in the United States.\n“We’re gonna get Apple to start building their damn computers and things in this country, instead of in other countries,” Trump said during a campaign speech last January.\nIn order to enforce this rule, Trump has declared during his campaign that he would force Apple and any other American company that opts to move their manufacturing departments to other countries, to pay a massive 35 percent tax. Just like most of his declarations during the campaign period, however, president-elect Donald Trump has not provided a clear outline as to how his administration would implement the sanctions.\n[Image by Andrew Burton/Getty Images] Apple and Trump’s row further escalated when the tech giant took a defiant stance against the Justice Department, which issued a request that the tech firm bypass an iPhone’s security systems. The phone in question, an iPhone 5C, was owned by the San Bernardino shooter, whose 2015 attack claimed the lives of 14 people and injured 22 more. When Apple refused to comply with the Justice Department’s request, Trump was quick to condemn the tech giant’s decision.\n“But to think that Apple won’t allow us to get into her cell phone. Who do they think they are? No, we have to open it up,” Trump said in a statement back in February.\nTrump’s fiery stance against the tech giant would escalate further, eventually culminating in the president-elect calling for a boycott of Apple products. His call for a boycott, which was broadcast through Twitter, was considered by many to be ironic, however, since the Tweet was written and uploaded using an iPhone.\nBoycott all Apple products until such time as Apple gives cellphone info to authorities regarding radical Islamic terrorist couple from Cal\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 19, 2016 \n\nWith Donald Trump now the president of the United States, only time will tell if he would really stand true to his word and take measures against the practices of firms like Apple. For its part, Apple seems set on continuing on its ways. While the letter that Apple CEO Tim Cook released was one of encouragement and hope, it was also a memo with an underlying feeling of defiance.\n[Featured Image by Stephen Lam/Getty Images]\nTim Cook Asserts Diversity Stance After Trump Win: ‘Apple’s North Star Hasn’t Changed’ is an article from: The Inquisitr News \n",

      "title": "Individual Macbook Pro chargers don't come with a USB-C cable",
      "text": "German-English-Translator - Details here Apple has been no stranger to controversy this year. From removing the headphone jack on the new iPhone 7 to equipping the new Macbook Pro with only USB Type-C ports , the Cupertino giant has constantly been in the news for months for its debatable hardware decisions. While many consumers are willing to overlook these seemingly consumer-hostile changes, they may be pushed over the edge with Apple’s decision to ship Macbook Pro power adapters without the cable needed to charge the notebook. Apple sells extra or replacement 87 and 61 Watt chargers for the Macbook Pro 15- and 13-inc h models, respectively, through its online store . Purchased for $69-79, the shipped box includes only the power adapter with a two-pronged attachment used to plug into an outlet. As noted by Ben Lovejoy at 9to5mac.com , a USB Type-C cable, which is necessary to plug the adapter into a Macbook Pro for power and charging, is glaringly absent. Also missing is an extension attachment for the power adapter. Some consumers are echoing Lovejoy’s disdain for these omissions, who decried the move as \"taking the penny-pinching a step too far.” Apple does include a power adapter and USB Type-C cable in the box with new Macbook Pro computers, but the extension cable is no longer shipped with the devices and must be bought separately. While Macbook Pro users can purchase a 2 meter USB Type-C cable and extension cable from Apple’s website for $19 each, they also have the option to use third-party cables and extensions. Buyers should exercise caution, though, as not all USB Type-C cables are created equal. Google has recently expressed concern about the charging capabilities of various USB Type-C cables, stating that manufacturers that make changes or additions to the charging protocol may produce charging cables that can damage mobile devices. It should also be noted that the extension cable sold through Apple's site may not be compatible with the new Macbook Pro's power adapter. The extension cable is listed as ready for use with \"MagSafe and MagSafe 2 power adapters and 10W, 12W, and 29W USB power adapters.\" The new Macbook Pro's power adapters are rated at 87 and 61 Watts, while the MagSafe and MagSafe 2 adapters are rated at 85 and 60 Watts. The exclusion of the USB Type-C cable may simply be a decision to unify Apple’s product line, as iPhone and iPad power adapters also exclude the lightning cables necessary to charge the devices. However, the decision may not bode well with consumers who already see the Macbook Pro’s sparse port selection as a move by Apple to increase revenue through the sale of adapters and dongles.

      "text": "Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends \nThe advanced image editor that took Apple’s App of the Year in 2015 is now making its way onto PCs. On Wednesday, Serif announced the public beta testing of Affinity Photo for Windows. \nConsidered by many to be a worthwhile Photoshop competitor, the public beta version brings all of the non-destructive image edits to the Windows platform. Serif, a company based in the U.K., is offering a free download of the beta version during the software’s public testing. \nMore: Affinity Photo’s upcoming version 1.5 could give Photoshop a run for its money \nThe Windows version includes both the tried-and-true options on the iOS version but also adds several tools that won’t be available on iOS until the release of Affinity Photo 1.5. An editing mode allows for all the tools to be used on 360-degree images, going through the same steps to apply those changes but allowing users to scroll around the complete 360-degree perspective within the workspace. \nThe beta version also brings a new advanced HDR edit that churns out full 32-bit color images as well as a new merge option for using the focus stacking technique for a sharper image. The pre-release also adds batch processing to speed up edits on groups of photos, a feature not yet available in the iOS version. \nSerif says that, along with the new features that are also coming to the future Mac version, the Windows version matches the company’s iOS award winner. \nMore: Affinity teases its impressive Photoshop competitor running on a 12.9-inch iPad Pro \n“When we started developing our Affinity apps nearly seven years ago, one of the key aims was to be cross-platform, so this is a huge milestone for us,” said Ashley Hewson, Affinity’s managing director. “Because we did plan for this from the beginning, we made nearly all of our back-end code — the core engine of Affinity, if you like — completely operating system independent. That not only means that file compatibility between the two platforms is 100 percent perfect, but all the power, performance, tools and accuracy which have really set us apart on Mac are there for Windows users to enjoy now too.” \nDuring the beta period, users will be able to test the software for free and have the chance to offer their feedback. After the beta period, Serif says the Windows version will match the iOS version’s $50 one-time price.",

      "text": "Funds News  31pm EST UPDATE 1-Loeb's Third Point takes share stakes in Apple, Visa and Dell \n(Adds Monsanto, Marathon Oil Corp) \nNEW YORK Nov 10 Dan Loeb's Third Point hedge fund took new share stakes in Apple Inc, Visa Inc and Dell Technologies Inc during the third quarter, according to regulatory filings late on Thursday. \nThird Point, closely followed in the investment community because of its pattern of delivering strong returns, took a 2.5 million stake in Apple, a 2.1 million class A share-stake in Visa and a 2.3 million share-stake in Dell Technologies. \nIn early November, Loeb told clients that Third Point's bets on corporate debt issued by Dell and Sprint Corp ranked among the year's top winners for the firm. \nThrough the end of September, the Third Point Offshore fund gained 7.2 percent, beating the average fund's 4 percent return. \nLoeb's Third Point also increased its share stake in Facebook Inc by 45.3 percent to 5.5 million class A shares, according to regulatory filings. In addition, the fund increased its stake in Alphabet Inc by 37.5 percent to 550,000 class A capital stock shares, the filings said. \nThird Point upped its stake in Monsanto Co by 85 percent to 3.7 million shares, while the hedge fund dissolved its share stake in Marathon Oil Corp during the third quarter, filings said. \nThird Point also took a 2.6 million sponsored ADS stake in Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, according to the regulatory filings. \nThe quarterly disclosures of manager stock holdings, in what are known as 13F filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, are always intriguing for investors trying to divine a pattern in what savvy traders are selling and buying. \nBut relying on the filings to develop an investment strategy comes with some peril because the disclosures are backward looking and come out 45 days after the end of each quarter. \nStill, the records offer a glimpse into what hedge fund managers saw as opportunities to make money on the long side. The filings do not disclose short positions, bets that a stock will fall in price. And there is also little disclosure on bonds and other securities that do not trade on exchanges.

      "text": "We have almost a year to go until Apple unveils the next iPhone, but it’s widely believed that at least one iPhone 8 version will feature an OLED display, marking a huge change for the company. Apple so far has relied on LCD screens for the iPhone, but uses OLED panels in other products including Apple Watch and, most recently, the 2016 MacBook Pro’s Touch Bar. Multiple reports claim that Apple is finally ready to make the jump to OLED screens in its iPhones, and there’s more proof coming in that direction, this time directly from Apple.\nDON’T MISS: What happens if today’s Presidential election ends in a tie? \nApple’s most recent Securities and Exchange Commission 10-K filing contains a detail that seems to back up existing iPhone rumors concerning OLED displays.\nApple Insider 's J.P. Morgan noticed that Apple placed a purchase order with more than a year duration for the first time. The total amount is quite substantial: $4 billion. Apparently, the order coincides with an “off-balance sheet obligation: for the same amount from the third quarter, believed to be a long-term OLED obligation to Samsung for the future iPhone.\nSamsung is seen as the primary beneficiary of the first iPhone models that will have an OLED display, but competing suppliers including LG, Foxconn’s Sharp, and Japan Display are also making large investments in OLED display factories.\nNot only is an Apple contract very lucrative for a supplier, but the OLED iPhone will convince other smartphone makers to adopt such screen technology for their iPhone killers.\nApple also made a change in its risk related to component acquisition statement. The company said that it might have trouble acquiring certain components “on commercially reasonable terms.”\nSeveral factors, including supply availability and cost, may have prevented Apple from equipping the iPhone with an OLED display in the past, but that may be changing.\nTrending right now: \n2016 election live stream: How to watch election coverage and results online Here is every single one of the 100 Pokemon Niantic just added to Pokemon Go Amazon’s 15 best deals: 128GB microSD, insanely thin iPhone 7/7 Plus cases, $25 Fire TV Stick, more See the original version of this article on BGR.com",

      "text": "0 All Share Services Topics: Apple , Hollywood , Juniper Foundation , Lawrence Levy , Movies , Pixar , Silicon Valley , Steve Jobs , Toy Story , Innovation News , Media News , Business News , Entertainment News (Credit: Disney/Pixar) In 1994 — in the days before we all carried iPhones — the phone on Lawrence Levy’s desk rang. Steve Jobs was calling the Silicon Valley executive, who he’d never met or spoke to, to discuss an ailing graphics company he owned known as Pixar. After a meeting, Levy joined the company as its chief financial officer and steered its business side through the release of “Toy Story,” “Finding Nemo,” and, at the end of his time there, “The Incredibles.” After stepping down, Levy followed an existing interest in Buddhism study Eastern philosophy more deeply and to co-found the Bay Area-based Juniper Foundation, which promotes meditation. Levy tells the whole story in a new book, “To Pixar and Beyond: My Unlikely Journey With Steve Jobs to Make Entertainment History.” Salon spoke to Levy from New York City, where he was promoting his book. The interview has been lightly edited for clarity. Pixar is so celebrated by now that a lot of us think of it as this pure, unceasing success story. But when you took over in 1994 it was kind of a mess, right? Yes — as I write in the book, people think of Pixar as this storytelling utopia, producing all of these amazing films. And in some ways it’s true. But to create that — there were many different forces and tensions, and this is that story. There were a lot of different challenges when I joined the company, a lot of things that had be to thought through and developed to create the company we know and love today. I think the company’s finances were in trouble when you took over. And “Toy Story,” which is now a kind of modern classic, was the subject of a lot of concern before it was launched. Right on both of those fronts. On the finance side, the company was almost on life support. Steve Jobs was paying the shortfall in payroll from his personal checkbook. He had invested close to $50 million into the company, with very little to show for it. So the finances were very dire. And of course they were making “Toy Story,” but there were so many unknowns. it was a completely new media for storytelling, and nobody knew what the public appetite would be for 90 minutes of this new thing called computer animation. You worked with Steve Jobs for a long time and considered him a friend as well. He has a complex reputation as a brilliant guy but also a difficult and controlling guy. How did he seem to you? Was he tough to get along with? In my experience of it, it was a very collaborative relationship from the very beginning. We hit it off. He welcomed the dialogue we had about what was the right path for Pixar, so it was an invigorating relationship. It was a collaborative relationship. It was one of my inspirations for writing the book — so much came out about Steve after he died, and it kind of missed this story. Did you feel the need, after the movies and books, to set the record straight, to give a fuller sense of what he was like? I didn’t feel the need to set the record straight, exactly, but I started feeling that [everyone thought it was] “He started Apple, he left Apple, and then he went back to Apple!” Wait a minute, there’s a story in between that was really important — both in terms of Pixar and in terms of Steve. And I kind of thought I was the only person who could really tell that story. Did you often experience him being domineering, the way he came across in the Danny Boyle film? No. That wasn’t my experience of it. He was passionate, and he was intense. He had well-formed views on things and he held to those. But he wasn’t closed off, at least not in my relationship with him. It was about a coming together and ironing out. Other people had other experiences. But that was my experience of it. Are there lessons for other companies — especially creative businesses — to take from your experience with Pixar? Yes. I think there are. Great work of any kind involves creative breakthroughs that are the product of tensions that work against each other — and that requires passion and the drive for creative excellence, the drive to do something great. And then there’s another part of that — you need to yield to collaborative voices. It’s very rare that one person can make something brilliant on their own. These two forces push against each other, because that passionate drive is often full of ego and hubris. Pixar really honed that tension, very [well.] I think other efforts could learn from them. You still, I think, pay some attention to movie-making in Hollywood, which these days is dominated by comic-book movies, sequels, and reboots. How healthy, creatively and financially, does it seem these days? One thing that’s changed since you were in the game is the huge growth of international markets, especially China. That’s true. These thing come in cycles, and we’re in a cycle just as you described that Hollywood is making a lot of money with comic-book franchises. But who knows how long that will last. There will be another cycle of innovation and imagination. I think there always be a place for a Pixar-type studio — it doesn’t have to be animation — that’s pushing forward and creating great original content. Near the end of your book you talk about your transition to Buddhism and to launching The Juniper Foundation. Tell us a little about your decision to walk away from the business world and a very lucrative company. Well, I had a good run, and loved the work I did at Pixar and my previous company, and I was a lawyer before that. But I felt and observed that there’s a certain one-dimensionality to corporate life. It’s focused on short-term success and acquisition at all costs. That focus, of course, produces great results, it produces great products, a lot of prosperity. It comes at a price. There are hidden costs to it that take a toll on our inner wellness. It produces a lot of stress, it can be hard to feel good about ourselves in that kind of environment, with that kind of intensity. So I wanted to explore what it would be like to round out that one dimension with another dimension of life, where we pay attention to other dimensions of life. I’d long been interested in meditation and Eastern philosophy, and wanted to go and explore that more deeply. I thought they had a lot to offer contemporary life. And I thought it was worth really committing myself to that. We can only speculate, but do you expect that if Steve Jobs had lived longer that he might have followed you or found his own way in? He might have! He was appreciative of and understanding those ideas, and he respected those ideas. He’d been influenced by those ideas over the course of his life. We never know what would have happened in the long run — who knows? Scott Timberg is a staff writer for Salon, focusing on culture. A longtime arts reporter in Los Angeles who has contributed to the New York Times, he runs the blog Culture Crash. He's the author of the new book, \"Culture Crash: The Killing of the Creative Class.\"",

      "text": "Apple Debuts New 'iBooks Storytime' tvOS App With Read-Aloud Books for Kids   4:30 PM PST by Juli Clover Apple has quietly introduced a new tvOS app for kids called \" iBooks Storytime,\" designed to allow children to read along with interactive books on their television sets. iBooks Storytime features a selection of children's books from the iBooks Store that feature Read-Along capabilities. Read-Along books are audio-enhanced with different character voices, vivid sound effects, and word-for-word narration that children can follow along with. Parents can purchase Read-Aloud books chosen by App Store editors directly from the Apple TV and control the voice narration with the Siri Remote or turn on an automatic reading feature. Some of the Read-Along titles include Lava , based on the Pixar short film, Green Eggs and Ham , Meet Tracker , The ABCs of Cookies , The Little Red Hen , and Goodnight Moon . Apple is offering Dora's Big Buddy Race Read-Along Storybook as a free title for testing the feature. Read-Along titles are also available on the iPhone and iPad, and previously-purchased selections will show up on the Apple TV.",

      "text": "Loeb's Third Point takes share stakes in Apple, Visa and Dell \nPublished November 10, 2016 \nNEW YORK – Dan Loeb's Third Point hedge fund took new share stakes in Apple Inc, Visa Inc and Dell Technologies Inc during the third quarter, according to regulatory filings late on Thursday. \nContinue Reading Below \nThird Point, closely followed in the investment community because of its pattern of delivering strong returns, took a 2.5 million stake in Apple, a 2.1 million class A share-stake in Visa and a 2.3 million share-stake in Dell Technologies. \nIn early November, Loeb told clients that Third Point's bets on corporate debt issued by Dell and Sprint Corp ranked among the year's top winners for the firm. \nThrough the end of September, the Third Point Offshore fund gained 7.2 percent, beating the average fund's 4 percent return. \nLoeb's Third Point also increased its share stake in Facebook Inc by 45.3 percent to 5.5 million class A shares, according to regulatory filings. In addition, the fund increased its stake in Alphabet Inc by 37.5 percent to 550,000 class A capital stock shares, the filings said. \nThird Point upped its stake in Monsanto Co by 85 percent to 3.7 million shares, while the hedge fund dissolved its share stake in Marathon Oil Corp during the third quarter, filings said. \nContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT \nThird Point also took a 2.6 million sponsored ADS stake in Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, according to the regulatory filings. \nThe quarterly disclosures of manager stock holdings, in what are known as 13F filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, are always intriguing for investors trying to divine a pattern in what savvy traders are selling and buying. \nBut relying on the filings to develop an investment strategy comes with some peril because the disclosures are backward looking and come out 45 days after the end of each quarter. \nStill, the records offer a glimpse into what hedge fund managers saw as opportunities to make money on the long side. The filings do not disclose short positions, bets that a stock will fall in price. And there is also little disclosure on bonds and other securities that do not trade on exchanges. \n(Reporting By Jennifer Ablan; Editing by Sandra Maler and Andrew Hay)",

      "text": "Walmart Black Friday ad features $199 Apple iPad mini 2, $119 Chromebook deals The retail giant also has several other tablets and laptops on sale for as little as $28. | Topic: Hardware \nWalmart's Black Friday ad includes an Apple iPad mini 2 sale and $119 Chromebook deal. \nThe Black Friday ad wars are finally starting to heat up, with Walmart's ad surfacing shortly after Target's . Like its rival, it has more tablet deals than ads leaked earlier in the cycle -- including Apple's iPad -- along with specials on several low-cost laptops. \nWhile Target has three different iPad models on sale, Walmart just has one -- not surprisingly, the Apple's cheapest model. The iPad mini 2 is discounted to $199, 79 cents less than what Target is going to be offering it for. Walmart makes up for it with a number of Android tablet specials, including a 7-inch RCA for just $28. It also has the Samsung Galaxy Tab E Lite 7-inch slate for $69 (99 cents lower than at Staples , with a $10 Google Play thrown in) and the Lenovo Tab 10 model for $99 ($50 off the regular price). Black Friday 2016 Dell's ad leaks with $100 laptop, desktop deals \nAlso listed are a trio of tablets with bundled wireless keyboards, including a RCA Cambio 10.1-inch device that runs Windows 10 for $99, though that's only about $10 less than the current price on the Walmart website. There are a pair of Android 2-in-1 deals in the form of a 10.1-inch SmarTab with Intel Atom processor for $72, and a 11.5-inch RCA Galileo Pro for $98. \nGiven their surging popularity, Chromebooks have been largely unseen in Black Friday ads thus far. Walmart has one, however, at a low price of $119. For that price ($60 less than Samsung is currently selling it for online), the Samsung Chromebook 3 gives you an Intel Celeron N3050 processor, 4GB of RAM, 16GB of built-in storage, and a 11.6-inch display. If you want a cheap Windows 10 laptop instead, you'll have to pay a bit more ($199) for the HP 15-ba018wm with AMD E2-7110 processor, 4 gigs of RAM, 500GB hard drive, and 15.6-inch display. \nWalmart has three additional budget notebook listed in Black Friday ad, each with a 15.6-inch displays. These include the HP 15-f222wm with an Intel Pentium N3540 CPU, 4GB of RAM, 500GB hard drive, and touchscreen for $249, and an Acer laptop with Intel Core i5 chip, 6GB of memory, and 1TB hard drive for $299. Finally, for a little more ($349), there's the HP 15-ba051wm with AMD A10-9600P processor, 8GB of RAM, terabyte hard drive, and choice of chassis color, along with a wireless mouse, 16GB flash drive, and a sleeve included in the price.

      "text": "Reddit \nAt some point today, Apple quietly introduced a new app on the tvOS App Store that brings iBooks to the platform, but in a form appropriate for children. Dubbed iBooks StoryTime, the app is designed to aid children in improving their reading skills through feature like interactive audio, a feature called Read-Aloud, and more. \nRead-Aloud is a feature that displays on-screen subtitles of sort synced to narration audio. The feature is similar to that of karaoke, teaching the children how to decipher the word and correctly read it. With this feature enabled, the pages of the book turn automatically as the narration moves forward, but with the feature turned off, users can use the Siri Remote to skim a book. \n“iBooks StoryTime gives your family a different way to experience classic kids’ books and discover new favorites. With Read-Aloud narration and beautiful illustrations, every handpicked title in the app transforms the Apple TV.” \nAt this point, iBooks StoryTime doesn’t support a huge selection of books, likely due to the optimization it takes to display a book on a large-screen platform. As of now, the iBooks StoryTime app is limited to a selection of children’s selections including: Green Eggs and Ham",

      "text": "0 November 10, 2016 iMac 2017 Release Date And Rumors: Apple’s Kaby Lake Machines To Be Introduced With iPad Pro 2? Simon Alvarez \nIt is no secret that Apple’s all-in-one desktop computer, the iMac, is long overdue. The latest iteration of the iMac that Apple currently sells was unveiled two years ago and simply refreshed last year, which corresponds to a very long time in the tech industry. Prior to the unveiling of the MacBook Pro 2016, numerous rumors emerged stating that Apple would be releasing the next-generation iMac in the event as well. Unfortunately, the iMac was not mentioned at all during the tech giant’s October 27 “Hello Again” event, fuelling speculations that the device would be unveiled early 2017 instead. \nConsidering the delay in the iMac’s release, rumors are high that the next-generation all-in-one desktop computer from Apple would feature the most advanced technologies currently available in the market today. Most of the rumors about the iMac 2017 are very encouraging, with speculations painting a picture of a powerhouse device that would be quite a match with its biggest and most formidable rival, Microsoft’s Surface Studio. \nOne of the biggest possible reasons behind the considerable delay of the iMac 2017’s release would be Intel’s Kaby Lake processors. While Apple settled on sixth-generation Skylake processors for the MacBook Pro 2016, there is a very slim chance that Apple would do the same strategy for the 2017 iMac. After all, between the two devices, the iMac has traditionally been more powerful than the MacBook Pro. The MacBook Pro 2016’s aging Skylake chips are already pretty much maximized by Apple’s latest power laptops. Thus, using Intel’s Skylake chips for the iMac 2017 would simply not work. [Image by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images] \nA recent Intel report unearthed by AnandTech found that the premiere chip-maker is preparing for the release of 11 quad-core Kaby Lake processors within the first three months of 2017. According to the report, included in Intel’s release would be seven Core i5, three Core i7, and one Xeon E3 v6 processor. These, of course, are the chips that have been rumored for the iMac 2017 for some time now. If the unearthed report proves true, each of the chips in the Kaby Lake family is significantly faster than their counterparts in the Skylake generation. Thus, these upcoming chips would be perfect for Apple’s upcoming flagship all-in-one. \nAs for the release date of the iMac 2017 , Apple would definitely need to step up its game, as the all-in-one market just got a lot more competitive with the arrival of the Microsoft Surface Studio. The Surface Studio is leagues above the current iMac right now and features support for the Surface Pen and a new innovative tool called the Surface Dial. The iMac has always prided itself as one of the best productivity and creativity devices in the market, but with the Surface Studio around, Apple’s all-in-one has been thrown far back in the race. \nWith this in mind, speculations are high that Apple would be releasing the iMac 2017 together with the iPad Pro 2. In a lot of ways, this does make sense, since the 9.7-inch iPad Pro and the 4-inch iPhone SE were unveiled last March. Considering the cycle of Apple products, a March 2017 reveal seems very likely. [Image by Brian Kersey/Getty Images] \nRevealing the iMac 2017 together with the iPad Pro 2 within the first three months of next year would be beneficial for Apple since both devices are in need of an upgrade. Apple’s iPads have seen a notable decline in sales recently, and the iPad Pro line has not been as successful as the tech giant might have wanted. Thus, March 2017 would be the perfect time to unveil both the iMac 2017 and the iPad Pro 2. \nThe iMac 2017 would be arriving at the all-in-one market in a position that is far different than before. While all-in-one machines have been around for some time, the iMac has always taken a very notable spot as one of the best productivity machines in the industry. This has caused the device to be embraced by many, despite its relatively high price. With the market more competitive than ever, and with a very formidable rival already being released, Apple’s iMac 2017 would need to surmount a mountain of challenges. \nThen again, Apple has always had a magic touch with its products. The entry-level iPhone 6S only had 2GB of RAM and 16GB of storage, but the tech giant’s loyal fans still supported it, allowing the rather underpowered device to outsell its more robust competitors. With the iMac 2017, however, the tech giant would not have the luxury to pull its punches. Apple would need to do everything it can to make sure that true to rumors about the device, the iMac 2017 would be its best all-in-one desktop computer yet. <noscript><iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/GcoG8hZjNtw?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></noscript> \n[Featured Image by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images]",

      "text": "Apple Starts Approving First Touch Bar App Updates on Mac App Store Thursday November 10, 2016 5:07 PM PST by Joe Rossignol Apple over the past two days has started approving Mac App Store apps that have been updated with Touch Bar support on the new MacBook Pro . One of the first Touch Bar apps is OmniGraffle 7 , a popular vector drawing tool for designing graphics and diagrams. After updating to version 7.2, users will have access to text controls when editing labels , for example, or manipulation controls when working with shapes. Without anything selected on the canvas on the main screen, the Touch Bar can be used to add shape, a stencil, or an image. OmniGraffle 7.2 for Mac's new Touch Bar controls Speed-Up , a utility for speeding up or slowing down audio playback directly in iTunes, also saw its Touch Bar update approved earlier today. Other apps that now support the Touch Bar include Gestimer , Opus One , Disk Aid , and Memory Clean 2 , and several more popular apps will be updated over the coming days and weeks. Those interested can track Mac app updates on our sister site AppShopper . The Touch Bar is a narrow strip of glass above the keyboard that provides both system and app-specific controls based on what you are doing. The touchscreen sits in place of the standard row of function keys on the new MacBook Pro and includes Touch ID for faster logins and Apple Pay .

      "text": "\nImage source: Apple.\nThe new TV app from Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is a great content aggregator. It collects all of the various video content consumers have access to through iTunes downloads, stand-alone streaming services, and on-demand streaming services that use pay-TV credentials. But there are a couple of major omissions: Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) .\nThose omissions have led many people to criticize the app, since at least 50 million Americans watch some of their television through Netflix or Amazon Prime Instant Video. That severely limits Apple's new app in its ability to find and recommend the best content for each user. What's more, it's unlikely Netflix will ever sign on.\nContinue reading ",

From iPods to iPhone cases, Apple has made it a regular habit of including a (Product) Red color option for most of its devices, and it is continuing the tradition with some of its Beats products.\nThe Beast Solo3 wireless headphones and Pill+ Bluetooth speaker will soon be available in what Apple is calling Citrus Red color option. It’s more of a bright red, similar to what is available for the iPhone silicone and leather cases. These colors are arriving just in time for Christmas.\nThese are the same Solo3 headphones that also come with the Apple’s new W1 chip, which will make connecting them to your iPhone that much easier.\nThe Solo3 headphones will retail for $299.95 while the Pill+ will cost $229.95. Apple didn’t relay a release date for the (Product) Red options, just stating they’ll be “coming soon.”\nApple also announced the Beats Solo3 and urBeats earphones in Ultra Violet. It’s softer and less vibrant than the (Product) Red and looks pretty nice.\nIf you are starting to plan out your Christmas shopping list, these new options might be good for people who prefer a bit of color.\n\n\nSource : Mac Rumors \nVia : Apple ",

      "title": "Apple's new Touch Bar MacBook Pros and the future of Macs",
      "text": "By Daniel Eran Dilger Thursday, November 10, 2016, 04:26 pm PT (07:26 pm ET) Whether you just skim headlines or deeply scour the Internet for every last word on the subject, Apple's latest MacBook Pro introduction appeared to be greeted with mountains of complaints from fans and haters alike, all united in their quivering fear of an existential threat to the Macintosh as a viable platform. Time to breathe! There's no need to exaggerate reality into Facebook-style, factually-loose imagery that's emotionally reinforced with rage-inducing, apocalyptic panic mongering. Let's take a more rational look at Apple's recently revamped, premium laptop line. Rather than dryly recant that Apple's latest MacBook Pros now incorporate thinner shells with more densely packed electronics that include an embedded iOS-based dynamic keyboard Touch Bar with Touch ID and the same USB-C ports as the retina MacBook (all of which was predictable or straight up leaked), much attention has been focused on things Apple didn't include: options for a desktop-class GPU, massive amounts of RAM expansion (beyond 16GB) or \"built in dongles\" for SD Cards, 1998's USB-A ports, HDMI or even VGA. Putting the Pro in protest Writing for The Verge , Vlad Savov proclaimed \"the MacBook Pro is a lie!\" because it doesn't support a higher end GPU or more than 16GB of RAM--and according to one developer cited in the piece, who runs multiple concurrent virtual machines to host web test environments for non-Mac browsers, that's a problem. It's useful to think about the actual number of MacBook Pro users with needs for more than 16GB. On one hand, even in the case of the above cited developer with a need for hosting multiple-VMs (running multiple instances of Windows or macOS ), 16GB was referred to as minimally sufficient. That's a significant distance away from simply \"not being a Pro machine,\" particularly given the portability the MacBook Pro is targeting. There was a time when Apple actually did sell multiple lines of Macs ranging up above $10,000, with a flurry of port types and replaceable graphics cards. Apple's first Macintosh Portable was effectively a desktop machine paired with an LCD screen. It weighed 16 pounds and cost $7,300 in 1989! Macintosh Portable, 1989. Today's Mac notebooks prioritize being thin and light However, the company's subsequent PowerBook notebooks in the early 1990s were designed first and foremost to be truly mobile. That turned out to be a hit, because mobility is a highly attractive feature for pros on the go. Particularly since 2000, Apple has worked to make its higher end notebooks as thin and as light as possible, a direction that was doubled down upon with the MacBook Air in 2008. Apple has really focused on the strategy of building what sells. And despite lots of expressions of blogger contempt for lighter, thinner designs, in speaking with professionals--and in my own experience--it's clear that people who work on notebooks strongly favor devices that are easy to carry over more powerful machines that are heavy and bulky enough to be a pain to lug to and from work sites. I was once certain that I needed DVD burner in every notebook I bought. It was only after thinking about how rarely I actually had ever used that feature--together with Apple's \"courageously\" bold and once-criticized decision to strip optical drives from its lineup--that it became obvious that spinning optical media was a vestige of the past. Similarly, despite long owing both a 17 inch MacBook Pro equipped with tons of ports and a MacBook Air with a much smaller screen, half the RAM, a slower processor and just two USB ports, I found myself using the Air more, almost exclusively so, just because it was so much easier to carry around when needed. While targeting light and thin mobility, Apple also axed its super small 11 inch MacBook Air Apple doesn't make 17 inch notebooks anymore, but notably also isn't making the 11 inch MacBook anymore either. Looking at its product lineup, it's clear that Apple has tons of data on what sells, and uses this to inform its design decisions! It's clear that Apple has tons of data on what sells, and uses this to inform its design decisions If only the people who \"professionally\" express opinions about Apple were aware of this data. It might help them write more accurately. Pressed to identify machines that Apple \"should have\" designed, critics are pointing to heavy, thick models aimed at Windows video gamers, which clearly sell in obscurely small volumes and do not appear to be very profitable at all. Building macOS race cars and trucks, not just mainstream cars At this point, it should not be surprising that the world's most successful mobile device maker--which builds and sells the most premium notebooks, the most tablets of any kind, and the most high end smartphones--is designing a limited number of machines to fit the needs of the broadest possible mainstream audience. At the same time, there's an argument that says Apple should be emulating car makers who build specialized custom vehicles for the racing circuit as a form of research and for bragging rights. However, these car makers don't sell their low volume race cars in small batches to the public. There are also \"truck\" tasks--including jobs such as professional-grade 5K video editing--that demand all the resources one can get. Apple does not make a luggable iMac-equivalent, and it hasn't even offered any insight into the future of its Mac Pro--which should be filling a role at the high end for users who need more power than a light, thin notebook can profile, but which hasn't been significantly updated over the last three years. That's created a degree of uncertainty among Mac users with advanced needs for professional-class machines. It's not obvious whether Apple truly recognizes the outer fringe of this minority of users--who are very small in number compared to the company's overall Mac business, but appear to be strategically important for Apple's iOS app development ecosystem (not to mention its relevance in fields such as professional video editing and music creation). It's important to note that most of those voicing hypothetical criticism of the new MacBook Pros haven't actually used them However, one Final Cut Pro editor , Thomas Grove Carter of Trim London, who has been using the new MacBook Pro called them \"really fast\" and \"buttery smooth\" and noted that they are \"powerful enough on the graphics front to power two 5K displays, which is an insane number of pixels.\" It's important to note that most of those voicing hypothetical criticism of the new MacBook Pros haven't actually used them, as review models are just becoming available now. MacBook Pro blazing fast storage Even though Apple doesn't have a public bragging presence equivalent to the auto racing circuit, it is pursing advanced research that dramatically enhances the design of its mainstream laptops. Most notable is the company's pioneering adoption of PCIe NVMe SSD storage, which is several times faster than the SATA-III SSDs typically used in PC laptops. The mainstream PC industry is trailing Apple by about a year in this aspect. Blazing fast SSD storage is radically faster than spinning hard drives, making a huge difference in how fast the system boots, apps launch and documents open. By offering higher end storage options on the MacBook Air for years, Apple has financed the work to bring SSD costs down, while driving progress on enhancing performance. Savov's \"Pro lie\" allegation targeting the new MacBook Pros only made one passing acknowledgment that the new models \"have faster storage, which is an indisputable benefit,\" without even articulating what that meant, before leaping to the idea that real professionals need more than 16GB of RAM. Yet, as his own linked blogger noted--and as John Gruber of the Daring Fireball referenced in a link, that's not really universally true by any means. Further, the \"limitation\" to 16GB of RAM is mitigated by the new MacBook Pro's ability to page virtual memory to its very fast SSD. And while lots of RAM is great, more physical RAM does means reduced overall battery life. This is a complex engineering decision, not simply a check box that went unheeded by Apple's hubris, as many bloggers are trying to suggest. Further, the issue is also largely related to the processors available from Intel and the type and amount of RAM they can support. And just to repeat the obvious: if Apple's strategy of building premium, light, thin and efficient machines were losing out to cheapskate, bulky, heavy machines with limited battery life, Apple wouldn't be earning most of the profits of the entire PC industry. And its rivals in the PC industry wouldn't be largely building machines that look virtually identical to MacBook Air and Pro models. USB-C jacks things up Faster SSD storage isn't the only pioneering pro technology Apple built into the new MacBook Pros. Thunderbolt 3 brings a super fast data bus and 5k-capable DisplayPort conduit, piggybacked onto the new machine's ultra-versatile USB-C connectors (pictured below next to Apple's Lighting and the full size USB-A connector). Some critics have even pounced on this as something to be upset about! Who could have predicted that Apple would move its MacBook Pros in the same USB-C direction as its retina MacBook, after having earlier introduced its ultralight, premium notebook as the future of mobile Macs? And how horrible that users might need a new cable, rather than multiple different cables as USB, Thunderbolt 2 and DisplayPort formerly involved. What did turn out to be new is that Apple actually included a reasonable number of new USB-C ports on its Pro models: two on the 13 inch model and an incredible four on the 15 inch MacBook Pro. That's the most general purpose USB ports Apple has ever built into a notebook. Even its former 17 inch aircraft carrier MacBook Pro maxed out at 3 standard USB ports. A decade ago Apple's 17 inch MacBook Pro also incorporated two FireWire jacks (operating at two different speeds, and each using a different physical connector), an Ethernet port for wired networking, an ExpressCard/34 card slot and a massive DVI connector paired with a VGA dongle. Today's MacBook Pros don't even include an SD Card slot anymore. Instead, they have multiple, uniform USB-C ports that also function as DisplayPort, USB 3.0, power input and a high performance 40Gb/sec data bus, all thanks to the new Thunderbolt 3 specification. Thunderbolt 3 is a really big deal, and the caustic response to it--including contemptuous criticism of the \"dongles\" required to plug in various devices--is particularly tone-deaf on a technical level considering the reality of the situation. Rather than assembling component blocks like a 1990s PC box using PCI card slots fitted with general purpose expansion cards, Apple released a light, thin mobile notebook with more powerful and adaptable expansion potential: Thunderbolt 3 is effectively a standard PCI Express slot exposed in the physical form of a USB-C connector. The \"dongles\" plugged into them serve as multipurpose expansion cards in the shape of a cable. Anyone with any technological insight should be applauding that Apple implemented Thunderbolt 3 so elegantly rather than outfitting its new notebooks the way Lenovo does: with only one port supporting power, some supporting higher or lower speed USB connectivity, and so on. Instead we have complaints that the new MacBook Pros don't incorporate \"at least one\" of the old-style USB-A ports that require you to plug the cable in one specific direction. A simple glance at the new machine next to the legacy MacBook Air shows what a massive difference the omni-directional USB-C affords in terms of thickness and internal volume. USB-C makes the MacBook Pro lighter than Air If you have lots of USB-A cables to plug into your 2016 MacBook Pro, there's a simple $9 adapter that converts them into a USB-C plug. Should Apple have included USB-A adapters in the box? Even if you only earn minimum wage, you shouldn't really spend more than an hour spinning your wheels on the subject because that would be a really ineffective use of your time and therefore resources. Anyone who thinks Apple should have built an old style USB-A plug into its new 2016 machines should consider how limiting and ridiculous that design decision would be over the lifespan of the machine, all to save $9, one time back in 2016. USB-C is clearly the future; Apple played a significant role in developing the new plug to be truly universal and more powerful than the USB protocol itself by making it powerful enough to also accommodate Thunderbolt 3 and DisplayPort signaling. There remains one conundrum: Apple has an installed base of nearly a billion IOS devices that shipped with USB-A cables and wall adapters. To plug one of these into the new 2016 MacBook models, you'll need a Lightning to USB-C cable, or one of those adapters. Also, iPhones and MacBooks ship with different power adapters (although that's always been the case). At some point, Apple could start shifting iPhones and iPads to use USB-C power adapters and bundle them with Lightning to USB-C cables. However, the majority of Mac and PC computers have USB-A ports, and virtually all general USB power ports, from wall plugs to airplanes, supply USB-A jacks. That effectively slows down how fast Apple can transition away from USB-A on its iOS power adapters. While the new USB-C port saves lots of space on notebooks, there's less benefit for desktop Macs or wall adapters (although the omni-directional design of the plug offers some convenience). That means new MacBook users will have to spring for a new Lightning cable. Outside of Apple, the rest of the mobile and PC world is also creeping toward USB-C, and users will similarly need to occasionally buy a new cable. If you compare how well Apple transitioned its mobile devices to Lightning while the world of Windows and Android hopped around between several (at least 5) different versions of mini and micro USB, it becomes hard to complain about the Apple ecosystem in comparison. The big new advantage to iOS users is that iPhone and iPads can use the same adapter to charge, via a USB-C to Lightning cable One last note about Apple's new MacBook Pro power adapter: unlike previous MagSafe versions, which built the cable into the adapter, the new machines ship with a power adapter using a USB-C connector, and the unit charges with a bundled cable using USB-C on both ends. The big new advantage to iOS users is that iPhone and iPads can use the same adapter to charge, via a USB-C to Lightning cable. For mobile users, that means they'll only need to carry one power block to charge all their devices. No more MagSafe, no bundled dongles Thunderbolt 3 layers PCIe and DisplayPort on top of USB, and flexible power management allows for charging input from any port on either side--even from another device, such as an attached display. All together, that's more valuable and practical than even Apple's own MagSafe plug, which only makes sense to build into one side of a laptop. The magnetic safety break of MagSafe--as well as its charging indicator light--are both features that third parties can incorporate in their charging cables. It's actually an improvement that Apple moved from its proprietary MagSafe to a standard USB-C port for power, and it's unfortunate that this change, too, has to be the subject of angst-ridden handwringing by anyone. Should Apple have thrown in a batch of cables, adapters and dongles into every MacBook Pro box? The downside to doing so is not just greater expense, but also involves an environmental issue. Apple will sell tens of millions of these new Macs every quarter; every unused cable and adapter it includes is that much more e-waste, particularly given that users will each have different needs depending on how they use their computers. A decade ago it made sense to include a VGA dongle with DVI-equipped PowerBooks. But today, when users might need Thunderbolt 3, or the former DisplayPort, or HDMI or even a VGA to plug in their monitor, it makes more sense to buy the one cable you need rather than filling the box with various dongles that are likely to mostly remain unused. Then too, a lot of notebook users will seldom or never connect an external display, particularly given the very high quality, brightness and contrast of the built-in screen and its support for rich DPI-P3 Wide Color. After all, if most of its laptop users were also buying external monitors, Apple would likely not have delegated its display business away to its partners including LG. Touch Bar promises a premium platform experience Another Pro feature Apple highlighted on its new laptops is the Touch Bar, which it presented as a productivity tool in direct contrast to Microsoft's years of efforts to overlay a touch screen on the display. Apple isn't confused about how to build a touch display. It sells more tablets than any other vendor. It specifically sold more iPads in its first year of trying than all of Microsoft's decade worth of Windows Tablet PCs, before going on to really sell iPads in large volumes. It has sold more iPads than Macs in most quarters. Apple can clearly demand a premium price for its MacBooks, so its also not just being cheap to avoid following Microsoft down the touchscreen display road. It's also worth noting that Microsoft's fixation on touch-enabled Windows has done nothing apparent to reverse its platform's slide or attract a new wave of software development for Windows 7, 8 or 10. By introducing Touch Bar on its higher end MacBook Pros, Apple is differentiating its product lineup while inducing third parties to create meaningful uses for the new interactive strip of controls. In typical Apple fashion, you can expect Touch Bar to trickle down across Apple's product lineup, eventually. Right now, it does seem to make the most sense on a notebook however, as notebook users have a keyboard where the Touch Bar is directly under the display, rather than in desktop setup where the keyboard might be tucked away in an under-desk drawer, or positioned in such a way where using a Touch Bar would require a bigger refocusing of attention away from the display. Similarly, iPad keyboards are unlikely to ever get a Touch Bar, as their hand held screen follows a very different interaction model compared to conventional notebooks or desktops. That suggests that Touch Bar might stay an exclusive feature of its notebooks. As the component cost of the dynamic keyboard input device falls, it's likely it will work its way into Retina MacBooks and the lower end MacBook Pros. Will desktop users pay a premium for an external keyboard with a Touch Bar? That's harder to say. One thing that is interesting about the Touch Bar is that it incorporates a new T1 chip, supporting Touch ID authentication for logins (both logging in initially and with Fast User Switching between accounts) and Apple Pay, iTunes and the App Store. This feature by itself, independent of the rest of the Touch Bar, is more likely to be introduced across Apple's entire Mac product lineup as a replacement for the basic power button. As the first Macs to feature Touch ID, Touch Bar-equipped MacBook Pros incorporate the sensor at the right edge of the Touch Bar screen (below, next to the Siri button). The Touch ID sensor also acts as a button and can be used to force shutdown the system if needed. It isn't needed to boot up the machine however, as the new laptops now automatically start up when opened. Crazy in love with the Macintosh For over three decades, Apple's Macintosh users have stood out as a passionately devoted crowd. While iPods, iPhones and iPads have earned extremely high \"user satisfaction\" rates, Macs have long attracted a different level of admiration. Apple's finite resources--and intentionally limited focus characterized in its ability to say no --haven't generated as much criticism on the iOS side as on the Mac, where users have long complained of missing links in the company's product lineup: no \"headless Mac,\" no PC box designs with lots of open expansion slots, no more rack mounted server models, and no more heavy duty, thick desktop replacement luggables. Apple's core competency in design and integration favors the devices it has focused its resources upon: three phone form factors (but no simple button flip-phone, and no mega fablet); three iPad form factors (but no 2in1 transformer laptop hybrids, and no tweener tablets); four primary notebook form factors and two iMacs. However, the very iOS-like features that have enhanced the design of MacBooks and iMacs have more limited application among computer form factors that make more sense for Linux or Windows users: servers, expandable PC boxes and some embedded computers. That's why Apple discontinued the Xserve and has left the Mac Pro and Mac mini minimally updated. They are low volume machines that are outliers in terms of the kinds of design and integrated features that Apple excels at. That same reality colors the kinds of MacBooks Apple will sell into the future. We'll be taking a closer look at Apple's latest MacBook Pro design decisions and how the company's engineering decisions might affect users with different types of needs. Give us your feedback in comments or on Twitter outlining the kinds of questions you'd like answered as we put Apple's latest high end notebook designs to the test this week. Topics:",

      "text": "Apple's 'iBooks StoryTime' tvOS app lets kids read along to their favorite books By Thursday, November 10, 2016, 03:53 pm PT (06:53 pm ET) Apple on Thursday released iBooks StoryTime, a new first-party tvOS app that brings handpicked children's books to the big screen with Read-Aloud narration, fun graphics and animations, and Siri Remote compatibility. Quietly introduced on the tvOS App Store, iBooks StoryTime acts as a hub for iBooks with Read-Aloud functionality, a feature designed to help children build reading comprehension skills through interactive audio and visual cues. Perhaps best described as karaoke for children's books, Read-Aloud titles play customized narration audio synced to a moving on-screen text prompter. Combined with fourth-generation Apple TV hardware, the app offers a unique interactive reading experience for parents and their kids, and presents a constructive alternative to gaming apps that dominate the platform. When Read-Aloud narration is turned on, book pages flip automatically as readers progress through a title. With the feature turned off, parents and kids can flip through the book at their own pace using Siri Remote. For now, iBooks StoryTime is limited to a batch of kid's titles curated by Apple's App Store editors, each of which can be purchased directly from the onscreen app interface. In addition to in-app content, users can buy additional Read-Aloud titles on iBooks from iPhone, iPad and Mac. If an Apple TV is connected to a family iCloud account, compatible content purchased by any member will automatically appear in the iBooks StoryTime library. iBooks StoryTime is available now as a free download from the tvOS App Store. Apple is giving away a free Read-Aloud title, \"Dora's Big Buddy Race Read-Along Storybook,\" to let users test out the new product. Topics:",

      "text": "By David Morgan | WASHINGTON \nDonald Trump’s White House victory moves Apple, Pfizer, Microsoft and other big U.S. corporations much closer than they have been in years to winning a big tax break on $2.6 trillion in foreign profits. \nTax reform is shaping up as among the most fruitful areas for cooperation between Trump and his fellow Republicans, who held control in Tuesday’s elections of both the House of Representatives and the Senate. \nTrump and congressional Republicans have separate, but similar, tax reform plans. Both would slash tax rates on businesses, simplify and cut individual taxes, and let companies bring overseas profits into the country at a low tax rate, raising prospects for a sweeping deal on taxes. \nBipartisan support for corporate tax reform has been growing as multinational companies have amassed tax-deferred profits abroad and brought continuous lobbying pressure over a decade for a tax break on them. \n“On tax policy, he’s basically adopted the House blueprint as his approach,” said Rohit Kumar, co-leader of the tax policy services practice at Big Four accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers [PWC.UL]. \n“There’s a better chance that something happens next year than there has been at any point in the last several years.” \nAt the heart of the issue is a law that lets U.S. companies hold foreign profits overseas without paying U.S. corporate tax on them, unless and until those profits are brought into the United States, which is known as repatriation. \nCorporations have $2.6 trillion stashed abroad under this law. That money could be repatriated any time, but businesses choose not to because it would incur the 35 percent statutory corporate income tax. \nTrump and House Republicans, including Speaker Paul Ryan, would still need to agree on how to pay for lower corporate tax rates and on whether U.S.-based multinationals should pay U.S. taxes on future foreign profits. \nTrump and congressional Republicans would also need support for tax reform from Democrats if they intend to present the package as a benefit for the country as a whole, analysts say. \nSuch proposals have stumbled before on Democrats’ objections that they are corporate give-away, and on Republicans’ insistence that they be paired with a cut in the corporate income tax rate. \nDemocrats could still block legislation they dislike from reaching the floor of the Senate, which requires a super majority of 60 votes to advance a measure, but there are procedural maneuvers Republicans could use to bypass them. \nThe one-time surge in revenue that would result from repatriation could help fund another cornerstone of Trump’s campaign platform — a pledge to boost the economy through big investments in U.S. highways, roads, bridges, airports and seaports. \nInfrastructure spending was not a campaign priority for congressional Republicans. But a new job-creating program could appeal to Democrats and be valuable to lawmakers in the 2018 mid-term elections. \nThe four companies with the largest profits held overseas are: Apple Inc ($200 billion), Pfizer Inc ($194 billion), Microsoft Corp ($108 billion) and General Electric Co ($104 billion), according to March estimates by Citizens for Tax Justice, a corporate income tax watchdog group in Washington. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2eBx2BO ). \nThe European Commission in August hit Apple with a 13 billion euro ($14.3 billion) bill for back taxes, fanning concerns among other U.S. multinationals and U.S. officials that their untaxed foreign revenues could be vulnerable to further European penalties. [nL8N1BB32W] \nApple CEO Tim Cook told an interviewer in September that he expects to repatriate billions of dollars in global profits to the United States in 2017 but did not say how. [nS8N1BD000] He said in another interview that the company would not bring money back unless there was “a fair rate” and said he was optimistic that tax reform would occur next year. \nBUSINESS SUPPORT \nThe House tax plan, which Ryan and other leading Republicans promoted throughout the campaign, would lower the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent, force multinationals to repatriate existing foreign earnings and adopt a “territorial” system that would largely end taxation of U.S. companies’ foreign income. \nTrump is calling for a steeper rate cut to 15 percent, and he has proposed a 10 percent tax rate for repatriated overseas profits held in cash, payable over a decade. \nSome are optimistic that those differences can be overcome. \n“In the end, there are no differences that can’t be solved on the tax issue,” said Republican Representative Tom Cole. \nThe House Republican plan has had significant support from business. \nKumar’s PwC advises the Alliance for Competitive Taxation, which lobbies on tax reform for over 40 companies ranging from Alcoa Inc and Cisco Systems Inc to Alphabet’s Google Inc, Procter & Gamble Co and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. \n“We know what we want,” said Dorothy Coleman, a tax policy expert at the National Association of Manufacturers, referring to a lower corporate tax rate, adopting a “modern, competitive” territorial system, and a permanent R&D credit among other wishes. \nThe House’s corporate tax plan would cut revenues by more than $890 billion over 10 years, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. The same research group says Trump’s corporate plan would reduce revenues by $2.6 trillion. \nTrump and Republicans in Congress view tax reform as a way to jump-start economic growth and job creation. \nBusiness lobbyists say that higher tax revenues from a growing economy would address much of the House plan’s shortfall. Trump advisers say revenue erosion posed by the president-elect’s plan would be overcome by growth and policy initiatives including a more aggressive approach to trade. \n(Additional reporting by Susan Cornwell; Editing by Kevin Drawbaugh and Stuart Grudgings) Share This:",

      "title": "Amazon, Alphabet, Facebook, Apple and Microsoft stocks drop following Trump victory",
      "text": "Shares of Amazon.com Inc, Alphabet Inc and other technology companies sank on Thursday as Wall Street sold them to pay for infrastructure names that could benefit from potential economic stimulus spending by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. Before his unexpected victory in Tuesday’s election, investors had worried about uncertainty that a Trump presidency might create, but traders in the past two days have been looking to business sectors that might stand to benefit.\nAmazon fell 4.7 percent to its lowest level since July, while Alphabet dropped 2.3 percent. Facebook Inc, Apple Inc and Microsoft Corp lost about 2.7 percent each. “I don’t think there’s anything in the new administration that’s going to be negative for tech stocks,” said Michael Yoshikami, head of Destination Wealth Management. “It’s just that other things are more in demand, and so there’s a rotation.”\nIn his acceptance speech, Trump reiterated his commitment to increased infrastructure spending, while striking a conciliatory note and avoiding references to controversial campaign promises.\nThe S&P 500 technology index .SPLRCT dropped 2 percent on Thursday and was on track for its steepest daily decline in two months, while the materials index .SPLRCM rose 1.27 percent. The industrial index .SPLRCI jumped 2.1 percent, helped by a 3.8 percent surge in Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N). Banks also rallied on expectations that Trump would roll back financial regulation.\nThe technology sector recently traded at about 16.2 times expected earnings, in line with the S&P 500 .SPX, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream. The materials sector traded near 15.9 times expected earnings. Thursday’s loss leaves Apple, which is struggling with lackluster iPhones sales, up 1.9 percent in 2016, lagging the S&P 500’s 6 percent rise.\nReuters \nThe post Amazon, Alphabet, Facebook, Apple and Microsoft stocks drop following Trump victory appeared first on Tech2 .",

Loeb is also active in ongoing U.S. investments, including auction house Sotheby’s and medical-device maker Baxter International Inc. \nMost of Third Point’s stakes aren’t tied to activism, where a hedge fund seeks to convince executives and directors to make changes it argues will reward shareholders.

      "text": "Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends \nThe iPhone SE was released back in March to a ton of fanfare — and for good reason. The phone offers relatively high-end internal specs while sporting the outer shell of an iPhone 5 or 5s. All that came at a pretty low cost. Unfortunately, however, it seems as though Apple may not be looking at taking the iPhone SE much further. \nKGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who is largely regarded as the best Apple analyst around, says that Apple isn’t planning on releasing a follow-up to the iPhone SE in 2017. \nMore: Apple’s iOS 10 is disconnecting iPhone SE, 6, 6 Plus users from T-Mobile’s network \nThe news is somewhat surprising — the iPhone SE was a hit when it was first released by Apple. According to Kuo, however, there are two reasons to not release another iPhone SE — to increase profit margins on the original iPhone SE as its parts get cheaper in price, and to reduce the risk that the new device cannibalizes sales of the iPhone 7. \nThose reasons do make sense. Apple has always been a little more interested in profit share than in market share, and while the decision to ditch the iPhone SE may end up impacting raw unit sales figures, Apple will ultimately make more money, Kuo says. In fact, he argues that iPhone shipments may fall a hefty 10 percent during the second quarter of 2017, from 40.4 million units during the second quarter of 2016 to 35 million units in the corresponding quarter in 2017. \nSome will be disappointed at Apple’s decision. The company could have easily upgraded the device to include 3D Touch, and could have even gotten rid of the headphone jack to make room for a haptic feedback motor. \nKuo is a very reliable Apple rumors source, but it’s possible that he’s wrong this time.

      "text": "Cook had hosted a fund-raiser for Clinton and Republican Speaker Paul Ryan but he had not hosted an event for Trump who was declared the next president Asking Apple's \"diverse\" workforce to stay united in the face of \"uncertainties\" following Donald Trump's surprise win in a bitterly fought US election, CEO Tim Cook today asked the tech-giant's employees to \"move forward together\" regardless of their individual political choices. Without naming either Trump or his rival Hillary Clinton, Cook in a memo to Apple employees, said it is inevitable that the election results have left many with strong feelings but urged them to move forward \"together\" regardless of their political affiliations.\n\"We have a very diverse team of employees, including supporters of each of the candidates. Regardless of which candidate each of us supported as individuals, the only way to move forward is to move forward together,\" he said. Cook said Martin Luther King's phrase \"to keep moving forward\" is timeless and a reminder that \"we only do great work and improve the world by moving forward\". He sought to reassure his company's employees amid \"uncertainties ahead\", saying \"Apple's North Star hasn't changed\".\n\"Our company is open to all, and we celebrate the diversity of our team here in the United States and around the world, regardless of what they look like, where they come from, how they worship or who they love. \"I've always looked at Apple as one big family and I encourage you to reach out to your co-workers if they are feeling anxious.\n\"Let's move forward together!\" he said.\nCook had hosted a fund-raiser for Clinton in August and one for Republican Speaker of the House Paul Ryan but he had not hosted an event for Trump who was declared the next president-elect of the US yesterday after he won with a comfortable margin securing 289 Electoral College votes against Clinton's 218.",

      "text": "If you were left deflated by the lack of innovation in Apple's iPhone 7, there's a solid chance you're holding out for all the rumoured changes dropping in 2017. While we've heard whispers of an OLED display, a bezel-less screen and an in-built home button, a recent report suggested the Cupertino giant will implement wireless charging if it can be mass-produced to a sufficient standard. That's now been bolstered by a fresh report, which indicates Apple could actually be looking to move past the standard wireless charging plates (as used in the Apple Watch shown below) and allow you to charge your phone from a distance. Wowza. This tech would allegedly allow you to be up to 15ft away from a transmitter plugged into the wall and still be able to add juice through an in-built receiver. Related: iPhone 8 release date, rumours, news, specs and price So, what's the actual link to suggest this is coming? Well, this innovative charging is currently being worked on at Energous, with signs pointing to a potential partnership with Apple. The company has previously said it's working with a \"tier 1\" smartphone manufacturer, meaning it's either collaborating with Samsung or Apple. The latter seems more likely due to a recent investment from Dialog Semiconductor, a company whose main business comes through, yep, the folks at Apple. It all seems pretty straightforward when outlined as above, but it's important to remember none of this dot-connecting is official. As a result, make sure to get out your tablespoon and apply an unhealthy dose of salt. Want up-to-the-minute entertainment and tech news?

      "text": "Apple, Chinese Smartphone Makers Help Toshiba Return to Profit in Q2 Reddit \nJapanese conglomerate Toshiba Corp swung to an operating profit in the July-September quarter, driven by strong demand for NAND flash memory chips from Chinese smartphone makers. \nThat boom in demand has been a blessing for Toshiba, which is seeking to recover from a $1.3 billion accounting scandal by turning itself into a company more focused on chips, nuclear energy and social infrastructure while getting rid of unprofitable businesses. \nToshiba posted an operating profit of JPY 76.7 billion ($721 million) for the second quarter, versus a loss of JPY 82.6 billion in the same period a year earlier. The result was roughly in line with a revised forecast announced in late October. \nToshiba revised up its annual outlook by 50 percent earlier this week and now expects JPY 180 billion in profit, a turnaround from a JPY 708.74 billion loss in the previous year. \nIn addition to robust orders from Chinese smartphone vendors eager to upgrade their devices with memory chips with larger storage capacity, Toshiba is receiving an additional boost from Apple Inc's iPhone 7. An advanced Toshiba flash memory chip with a three-dimensional stacked cell structure is being used in a high-end model of the latest iPhone, analysts have said.\nToshiba forecasts its chips and devices division will be its the largest profit contributor, generating an operating profit of JPY 130 billion this financial year. \nBut analysts have also said that Toshiba's depleted capital base in the wake of the scandal could limit its ability to make the necessary investments crucial to staying competitive in the global chip industry. \nToshiba had a NAND flash market share of 19.4 percent in 2015, ranking second after Samsung Electronics Co which has a 30.8 percent share, according to research firm His. \n© Thomson Reuters 2016",

      "title": "Just how well is Apple's new MacBook Pro selling?",
      "text": "The loyal fans of Apple waited a pretty long time for a fresh update to the MacBook Pro line, with the result being a fancy Touch Bar and improved internals. But would people be willing to fork over an increased amount of cash for these relatively minor innovations? Well, yes, it appears as if customers actually are more willing than ever to gain the coveted Apple glow, with figures suggesting the device outsold every competing laptop from this year… in two weeks. Yep, seriously. The data comes from Slice Intelligence (H/T MacRumors), who indicate the first five days of availability in the US resulted in almost twice the revenue of four competing devices combined since they launched. Those devices happen to be Microsoft's Surface Book, Lenovo's Yoga 900, the Dell Inspiron 2-in-1 and the ASUS Chromebook Flip. Related: MacBook Pro 2016 review - hands-on with Apple's latest high-end laptop The figures also show how Apple's new line produced seven times as much revenue as last year's 12-inch MacBook managed over its entire launch month. That tidbit isn't overly surprising considering that model wasn't aligned to the Pro range, but the fresh laptops have also already accounted for 78% of the revenue racked up by the Retina MacBook since its original launch. Now, of course, the increased price tag is somewhat aiding these loftier numbers, but this also shows us how little the price tag is deterring people from diving into their life savings for the new MacBook Pro. Was there some kind of worldwide lottery we missed out on?",

      "text": "Loading... \nApple has a new TV app for iPhones, iPads, and Apple TV streaming boxes coming in December, that the company says “provides one place to access TV shows and movies, as well as a place to discover new content to watch.” \nThe idea behind the app is that it can search all of the other video apps on your device at once to help you find programming from multiple streaming services. It’s like a TV Guide for your phone. Plus you’ll be able to access programs and movies from different apps right from the TV app. \nYou can’t quite get to everything yet. If you want to start playing a Netflix movie, you’ll have to exit the TV app and you won’t be able to search Amazon Prime content. Apple says the app is a work in progress, and they still haven’t gone into detail about how much access you’ll have to content that’s not part of your iTunes library, even though that seems to be the entire point of the new app. \nUsers will also be able to tune into selected live news and sporting events using the voice controls for Siri. You can simply tell Siri that you want to watch the Ohio State game or ask which games are on. \nDirectTV and DIS subscribers will be able to sign in once and have access to paid content in any apps that are connected to their pay-TV subscriptions. Apple says the app is a work in progress, so expect new features to be announced at a later date. \n~ Cynthia \nTags: apple , AppleTV , cutting the cord , iOS iPhone , ipad , smartphones , TV app , TV tech This entry was posted on Wednesday, November 9th, 2016 at 10:54 AM and is filed under iOS , Multimedia , Smartphones , TV Tech .

      "text": "4 hours 57 minutes ago 28 View Comments After Trump was named President-elect, the CEOs of Apple and Starbucks sent out letters to their employees, helping them to process the election Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg also posted a picture of him watching the election returns with his 11-month-old daughter Max In his post, Zuckerberg said he was feeling 'hopeful' \nBy Ashley Collman For Dailymail.com \nPublished: 13:36 EST, 10 November 2016 | Updated: 18:38 EST, 10 November 2016 \nFollowing Tuesday's surprising election results, CEOs at some of America's largest companies sent out letters to their employees, urging them to remain positive. \nApple CEO Tim Cook and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg crafted messages of unity after the contentious election, while Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz echoed many Americans' feelings in saying he was 'stunned' when Donald Trump was named President-elect. \nZuckerberg made his message public to the world, on his personal Facebook account - posting a photo of him watching the results come in on Election Day with his 11-month-old daughter Max. \nMark Zuckerberg posted this picture of himself watching the election returns on Tuesday with his 11-month-old daughter Max \nHe captioned the photo with a message of hope to his many followers \nThe 32-year-old said that spending time with his daughter on Election Day, he was reminding about 'all the work ahead of us to create the world we want for our children'. \n'This work is bigger than any presidency and progress does not move in a straight line. \n'The most important opportunities of Max's generation - like curing all disease, improving education, connecting everyone and promoting equal opportunity - will take long term focus and finding new ways for all of us to work together, sometimes over decades,' Zuckerberg wrote. \nApple CEO Tim Cook (left) and Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz (right) both wrote letters to their employees about the election results \nHe then entreated his followers to 'go work even harder' to make the world a better place. \nIn an email to Apple employees on Wednesday, Cook - who has been an outspoken critic of Mr Trump - didn't even mention the president-elect by name as he asked his team to 'move forward together'. We have a very diverse team of employees, including supporters of each of the candidates. Regardless of which candidate each of us supported as individuals, the only way to move forward is to move forward together. Apple CEO Tim Cook \n'I’ve heard from many of you today about the presidential election. In a political contest where the candidates were so different and each received a similar number of popular votes, it’s inevitable that the aftermath leaves many of you with strong feelings. \n'We have a very diverse team of employees, including supporters of each of the candidates. Regardless of which candidate each of us supported as individuals, the only way to move forward is to move forward together,' Cook wrote. \nHe added that Apple is 'one big family' and encouraged his employees to reach out to coworkers 'if they are feeling anxious'. \nStarbucks CEO Howard Schultz wrote a similar message to his employees. \nHe wrote that he was 'stunned' to see former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton lose the election. \nWhile he remains uncertain about 'the precise impact' Trump's election will have on our country, he says he hopes that 'we will overcome the vitriol and division of this unprecedented election season'. \n'We can choose to answer the challenges of the day with kindness and compassion. We can choose to listen, to understand and to act with respect. \n'We can choose to live by the values that reside in each of us, and honor our commitment to nurture the human spirit with love, and offer everyone in our stores and communities a place of inclusion and optimism,' he wrote. FULL LETTER FROM APPLE CEO TIM COOK \nTeam, \nI’ve heard from many of you today about the presidential election. In a political contest where the candidates were so different and each received a similar number of popular votes, it’s inevitable that the aftermath leaves many of you with strong feelings. \nWe have a very diverse team of employees, including supporters of each of the candidates. Regardless of which candidate each of us supported as individuals, the only way to move forward is to move forward together. I recall something Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. said 50 years ago: “If you can’t fly, then run. If you can’t run, then walk. If you can’t walk, then crawl, but whatever you do you have to keep moving forward.” This advice is timeless, and a reminder that we only do great work and improve the world by moving forward. \nWhile there is discussion today about uncertainties ahead, you can be confident that Apple’s North Star hasn’t changed. Our products connect people everywhere, and they provide the tools for our customers to do great things to improve their lives and the world at large. Our company is open to all, and we celebrate the diversity of our team here in the United States and around the world — regardless of what they look like, where they come from, how they worship or who they love. \nI’ve always looked at Apple as one big family and I encourage you to reach out to your co-workers if they are feeling anxious. \nLet’s move forward — together! \nBest, FULL LETTER FROM STARBUCKS CEO HOWARD SCHULTZ \nDear Partners, \nLast night, like so many of you, I watched the election returns with family and friends. And like so many of our fellow Americans – both Democrats and Republicans – I am stunned. \nWe cannot know what the precise impact will be on our country and the rest of the world. I am hopeful that we will overcome the vitriol and division of this unprecedented election season. \nAs Americans, we must honor the democratic process. We have a president-elect in Donald Trump, and it is our responsibility as citizens to give him the opportunity to govern well and bring our country together. \nWhether you are pleased or disappointed by the outcome, we each still have a choice. Today and every day, we have a choice in how we treat one another in our homes, in our neighborhoods, and of course in our stores. \nWe can choose to answer the challenges of the day with kindness and compassion. We can choose to listen, to understand and to act with respect. We can choose to live by the values that reside in each of us, and honor our commitment to nurture the human spirit with love, and offer everyone in our stores and communities a place of inclusion and optimism. \nToday, I trust you, and I trust all that is good in our country. Let’s take care of each other and the people in our lives. I believe we will each find the best version of ourselves to help our country move on in the direction we all deserve. Together is where our collective power lies, as partners, and as Americans. \nI am so very proud to be your partner. \nOnward,",

      "text": "According to well-known Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, Apple may not be releasing a follow-up to the highly popular iPhone SE, which was released earlier in 2016 and features relatively high-power specs at a low price. More The iPhone SE was released back in March to a ton of fanfare — and for good reason. The phone offers relatively high-end internal specs while sporting the outer shell of an iPhone 5 or 5s. All that came at a pretty low cost. Unfortunately, however, it seems as though Apple may not be looking at taking the iPhone SE much further.\nKGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who is largely regarded as the best Apple analyst around, says that Apple isn’t planning on releasing a follow-up to the iPhone SE in 2017.\nMore: Apple’s iOS 10 is disconnecting iPhone SE, 6, 6 Plus users from T-Mobile’s network\nThe news is somewhat surprising — the iPhone SE was a hit when it was first released by Apple. According to Kuo, however, there are two reasons to not release another iPhone SE — to increase profit margins on the original iPhone SE as its parts get cheaper in price, and to reduce the risk that the new device cannibalizes sales of the iPhone 7.\nThose reasons do make sense. Apple has always been a little more interested in profit share than in market share, and while the decision to ditch the iPhone SE may end up impacting raw unit sales figures, Apple will ultimately make more money, Kuo says. In fact, he argues that iPhone shipments may fall a hefty 10 percent during the second quarter of 2017, from 40.4 million units during the second quarter of 2016 to 35 million units in the corresponding quarter in 2017.\nSome will be disappointed at Apple’s decision. The company could have easily upgraded the device to include 3D Touch, and could have even gotten rid of the headphone jack to make room for a haptic feedback motor.\nKuo is a very reliable Apple rumors source, but it’s possible that he’s wrong this time.\niPhone 7S and iPhone 8 rumors Apple will sell fewer watch units in 2016 than 2015, according to analyst The iPhone 7 may have gotten people excited, but not as excited as the iPhone 6 Apple and Samsung positively dominate smartphone profits worldwide Report: 10.5-inch iPad Pro could precede 'radical' design changes in 2018",

      "text": "Featured News Tech \nDespite the layers of controversy surrounding the unveiling of Apple’s newest line of Macbook Pros , including the dongle fiasco and increased pricetag, it appears that the laptops’ sales have been remarkably high, outselling all of its Windows-run competitors. According to new information from Slice Intelligence, the new Macbook Pro sales have already surpassed those of Microsoft’s Surface Book, Dell XPS 13 and 15, Lenovo Yoga and Asus Chromebook Flip, each of which having been released to the public over a year ago. \nAccording to Apple’s Senior VP of Worldwide Marketing Phil Schiller, the number of orders for the new Macbook Pro is greater than that of any other pro notebook in the company’s history. \nThe data presented on Slice Intelligence’s graph was drawn from sales numbers and not units sold, leading to the belief that it might be skewed slightly more towards Apple’s favor because of the devices’ higher prices.",

      "text": "Apple CEO Tim Cook is trying to steady rattled employees.\nPhoto by James Martin/CNET Apple CEO Tim Cook is telling his company the only thing to do after Donald Trump's election is to keep pushing ahead \"together.\"\n\"In a political contest where the candidates were so different and each received a similar number of popular votes, it's inevitable that the aftermath leaves many of you with strong feelings,\" he said Wednesday in a companywide memo.\n\"Regardless of which candidate each of us supported as individuals, the only way to move forward is to move forward together.\"\nThe political divide is wide in the US: 49 percent of Republicans say the Democratic Party makes them \"afraid,\" and 55 percent of Democrats say the same about the Republican Party, according to Pew Research from June.\nCook's memo addressed this division.\n\"Our company is open to all, and we celebrate the diversity of our team here in the United States and around the world -- regardless of what they look like, where they come from, how they worship or who they love,\" he wrote.\nIt's unclear what impact a Trump presidency will have on the technology sector. The president-elect hasn't exactly been friendly to Apple and others in Silicon Valley. Trump has said several times that he would force Apple to build its devices in the US , something that would upend Apple's manufacturing process. He also called for people to boycott Apple's products until the company helped the FBI unlock a phone used by a shooter in the San Bernardino, California, terrorist attack. Apple had resisted the FBI's request , saying it wanted to protect the privacy of its users. The FBI ended up withdrawing its request for Apple's help in that case, but the issue is one that's sure to pop up again.\nWorry about what a Trump presidency would mean for Silicon Valley caused many in tech to endorse Hillary Clinton. Apple didn't make public comments about the presidential race or run a political action committee, but Cook reportedly held a campaign fund-raiser for Clinton this summer. He had also hosted a fund-raiser for Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan. Cook, as one of tech's only openly gay CEOs , has made a big push for social justice and diversity (though Apple still has a long way to go in terms of its own diversity numbers ).\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg had a similarly measured response while watching the election results.\n\"I thought about all the work ahead of us to create the world we want for our children. This work is bigger than any presidency and progress does not move in a straight line,\" he said in a Facebook post .\nOthers in Silicon Valley haven't reacted so calmly. Airbnb and Uber investor Shervin Pishevar said he wants California to withdraw from the United States and become its own nation.\nHere's the full text of Cook's memo.\nTeam,\nI've heard from many of you today about the presidential election. In a political contest where the candidates were so different and each received a similar number of popular votes, it's inevitable that the aftermath leaves many of you with strong feelings.\nWe have a very diverse team of employees, including supporters of each of the candidates. Regardless of which candidate each of us supported as individuals, the only way to move forward is to move forward together. I recall something Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., said 50 years ago: \"If you can't fly, then run. If you can't run, then walk. If you can't walk, then crawl, but whatever you do you have to keep moving forward.\" This advice is timeless, and a reminder that we only do great work and improve the world by moving forward.\nWhile there is discussion today about uncertainties ahead, you can be confident that Apple's North Star hasn't changed. Our products connect people everywhere, and they provide the tools for our customers to do great things to improve their lives and the world at large. Our company is open to all, and we celebrate the diversity of our team here in the United States and around the world -- regardless of what they look like, where they come from, how they worship or who they love.\nI've always looked at Apple as one big family and I encourage you to reach out to your co-workers if they are feeling anxious.\nLet's move forward -- together!\nBest,\nTim\nFirst published November 10, 7:11 a.m. PT.\nUpdate, 12:00 p.m.: Adds full memo and background information.",

      "text": "Over the years, I have become so fond of Apple products that my kitbag seems to recognize only iDevices like iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch. Whether I’m working on the computer or relaxing on the couch, I love using them. Thanks to a dock, the hands-free experience becomes more convenient.\nThe one thing that I don’t like much is buying a dock for each one of my iDevice. It is because organizing them tends to become a little complicated. That’s why the unified solution has always fulfilled my need with much better result. (You would like to have a look at the best iPhone 7 and 7 Plus Docking Stations .)\n\nWhile buying a charging dock, there are three biggest qualities that I don’t fail to check—Design, durability comfort. When I got “Colony Organizer” for a test drive last week, during my use it struck a positive chord. Within a few days, it replaced all other docks; due mainly to its handy functionality.\nQuell & Co Colony Organizer Dock for iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch Solid Construction and Neat Design \n\nThe dock has been readied with the high-quality walnut or maple wood. The solid construction is the hallmark of its durability.\nThe docking station sports a neat design. Being lightweight, you can comfortably carry it anywhere.\nIts long-lasting wooden structure has impressed me a lot. It can easily survive the wear and tear without any issue.\nMicro-suction Pads \n\nColony Organizer features micro-suction pads on the base, which provide more stability. As a result, it is perfectly placed on the surface.\nSimply place the dock on a table or desk or any surface, it will remain intact while holding your devices.\nExceptionally User-friendly \n\nThe dock is very easy to use. It securely holds up to four iDevices and two charging cables.\nSince the docking station requires less maintenance, you won’t have to worry much about it. Besides, the top grade material helps it remain at its very best for long. As a user, you would really appreciate this quality.\nPrimed to Work with Several Devices \n\nThe charging dock has been designed to work with some devices like Apple Watch, iPhone 5 and later, iPad Air/Mini/Pro and 12-inch MacBook. If you have more than one iDevices, this dock can be a perfect station for not just charging them comfortably but also keeping them organized.\nAs someone who has quite a few Apple devices, I find this dock exceptionally useful. It makes my task of powering them all a bit easier.\nThe Bottom Line \nColony Organizer charging dock is the perfect solution you would want to power up your iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch with more convenience. The ability to display and charge multiple devices at one go makes it worth the shot you would want.\nAs against various other docking stations, it is more competent, convenient and offers the desired solution to enhance the hands-free experience and charge multiple devices with utmost ease. Better still, its price doesn’t seem to be too high either.\nPrice: $60\nBuy it from QuellandCo.com \nConnect with us on Facebook , Twitter , and Google Plus .

      "text": "WASHINGTON Donald Trump's White House victory moves Apple ( AAPL.O ), Pfizer ( PFE.N ), Microsoft ( MSFT.O ) and other big U.S. corporations much closer than they have been in years to winning a big tax break on $2.6 trillion in foreign profits.\nTax reform is shaping up as among the most fruitful areas for cooperation between Trump and his fellow Republicans, who held control in Tuesday's elections of both the House of Representatives and the Senate.\nTrump and congressional Republicans have separate, but similar, tax reform plans. Both would slash tax rates on businesses, simplify and cut individual taxes, and let companies bring overseas profits into the country at a low tax rate, raising prospects for a sweeping deal on taxes.\nBipartisan support for corporate tax reform has been growing as multinational companies have amassed tax-deferred profits abroad and brought continuous lobbying pressure over a decade for a tax break on them.\n\"On tax policy, he's basically adopted the House blueprint as his approach,\" said Rohit Kumar, co-leader of the tax policy services practice at Big Four accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers [PWC.UL].\n\"There's a better chance that something happens next year than there has been at any point in the last several years.\"\nAt the heart of the issue is a law that lets U.S. companies hold foreign profits overseas without paying U.S. corporate tax on them, unless and until those profits are brought into the United States, which is known as repatriation.\nCorporations have $2.6 trillion stashed abroad under this law. That money could be repatriated any time, but businesses choose not to because it would incur the 35 percent statutory corporate income tax.\nTrump and House Republicans, including Speaker Paul Ryan, would still need to agree on how to pay for lower corporate tax rates and on whether U.S.-based multinationals should pay U.S. taxes on future foreign profits.\nTrump and congressional Republicans would also need support for tax reform from Democrats if they intend to present the package as a benefit for the country as a whole, analysts say.\nSuch proposals have stumbled before on Democrats' objections that they are corporate give-away, and on Republicans' insistence that they be paired with a cut in the corporate income tax rate. \nDemocrats could still block legislation they dislike from reaching the floor of the Senate, which requires a super majority of 60 votes to advance a measure, but there are procedural maneuvers Republicans could use to bypass them.\nThe one-time surge in revenue that would result from repatriation could help fund another cornerstone of Trump's campaign platform -- a pledge to boost the economy through big investments in U.S. highways, roads, bridges, airports and seaports.\nInfrastructure spending was not a campaign priority for congressional Republicans. But a new job-creating program could appeal to Democrats and be valuable to lawmakers in the 2018 mid-term elections.\nThe four companies with the largest profits held overseas are: Apple Inc ($200 billion), Pfizer Inc ($194 billion), Microsoft Corp ($108 billion) and General Electric Co ( GE.N ) ($104 billion), according to March estimates by Citizens for Tax Justice, a corporate income tax watchdog group in Washington. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2eBx2BO ). \nThe European Commission in August hit Apple with a 13 billion euro ($14.3 billion) bill for back taxes, fanning concerns among other U.S. multinationals and U.S. officials that their untaxed foreign revenues could be vulnerable to further European penalties.\nApple CEO Tim Cook told an interviewer in September that he expects to repatriate billions of dollars in global profits to the United States in 2017 but did not say how. He said in another interview that the company would not bring money back unless there was \"a fair rate\" and said he was optimistic that tax reform would occur next year.\n\nBUSINESS SUPPORT\nThe House tax plan, which Ryan and other leading Republicans promoted throughout the campaign, would lower the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent, force multinationals to repatriate existing foreign earnings and adopt a \"territorial\" system that would largely end taxation of U.S. companies' foreign income.\nTrump is calling for a steeper rate cut to 15 percent, and he has proposed a 10 percent tax rate for repatriated overseas profits held in cash, payable over a decade.\nSome are optimistic that those differences can be overcome. \n\"In the end, there are no differences that can't be solved on the tax issue,\" said Republican Representative Tom Cole. \nThe House Republican plan has had significant support from business. \nKumar's PwC advises the Alliance for Competitive Taxation, which lobbies on tax reform for over 40 companies ranging from Alcoa Inc ( AA.N ) and Cisco Systems Inc ( CSCO.O ) to Alphabet's Google Inc ( GOOGL.O ), Procter & Gamble Co ( PG.N ) and Wal-Mart Stores Inc ( WMT.N ).\n\"We know what we want,\" said Dorothy Coleman, a tax policy expert at the National Association of Manufacturers, referring to a lower corporate tax rate, adopting a \"modern, competitive\" territorial system, and a permanent R&D credit among other wishes.\nThe House's corporate tax plan would cut revenues by more than $890 billion over 10 years, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. The same research group says Trump's corporate plan would reduce revenues by $2.6 trillion.\nTrump and Republicans in Congress view tax reform as a way to jump-start economic growth and job creation. \nBusiness lobbyists say that higher tax revenues from a growing economy would address much of the House plan's shortfall. Trump advisers say revenue erosion posed by the president-elect's plan would be overcome by growth and policy initiatives including a more aggressive approach to trade.\n\n(Additional reporting by Susan Cornwell; Editing by Kevin Drawbaugh and Stuart Grudgings)",

      "text": "Big Apple heartbreak as Yellowcard say goodbye to New York City By: Amelia Harper Nov 11, 2016 2 hours ago 86 7 y2016m11d11 \nYellowcard \n\nWednesday night in New York City was definitely one for the books. Not only was it the day after the 2016 U.S. Presidential election, but Yellowcard held a very powerful and emotional performance at the PlayStation Theatre in Times Square in front of a sold out crowd as part of their Final World Tour. Yellowcard announced on June 24, 2016 that they will be breaking up after a final, self-titled album, which released on September 30, and a World Tour set for the fall continuing through the spring of 2017. Only 10 shows remain on the U.S. leg of the tour before the band lifts the sail and heads for Europe. Tagging along for the journey is Like Torches , a Swedish alternative rock band whose records have been produced by Yellowcard's own Ryan Key (lead vocals) and Ryan Mendez (lead guitar). Also opening the tour is Yellowcard's label mate on Hopeless Records, DryJacket . \nNew Jersey natives, DryJacket, started the night off right with a set jam-packed with hard-hitting rock and roll music and just enough energy to get the crowd pumped for the rest of the show. Watching them rage and take on the crowd like veterans, one would never guess that this group has only been playing music together for just a few short years. A couple of youngsters with plenty of talent who scored a record deal pretty early in the game. It's a story pretty reminiscent of Yellowcard's own journey that started in 1997. \nSwedish band, Like Torches, was the second opener before Yellowcard took the stage. It's pretty special for Yellowcard to bring them along on this final tour because of their connection. Both Ryan Key and Ryan Mendez produced Like Torches' first album and Key produced their second and most recent album just this year. While on stage, frontman Daniel Karn made sure to give a shoutout to the guys. The Like Torches setlist was comprised of songs off both of their albums which all got the crowd off their feet. \nThe Yellowcard set started off with a strong message appropriate for today's typical crowd: a recorded voice reminded the crowd that they were there for a rock show and they should put the technology away, watch through their own eyes, and take it all in. Seconds after, the band ran onto the stage, causing the crowd to roar as Sean Mackin immediately picked up the violin and started the set with \"Believe.\" The entire setlist was a true testimony to, and reflection of, the band's legacy from 1997 to today. \nThroughout the night, frontman Ryan Key took a few moments to talk about the past 20 years, what the fans' dedication has meant to them, and even took the time to reflect on the story behind certain songs. He talked about \"Sing For Me\" which was written about his Aunt Stephanie who lost her battle to brain cancer. The band also stunned the crowd by asking how their \"Spidey Sense\" was before playing \"Gifts and Curses\" from the Spider-Man 2 S oundtrack which was perfectly suitable for New York City when Key sang, \"Mary's alive in the bright New York sky. The city lights shine for her.\" They also surprised everyone by performing a song off their very first record, One For the Kids (1997), \"October Nights\" which they played acoustic, mirroring the way they originally wrote the song. \nThe performance was a massive 24-song set including a perfect mixture of songs from every Yellowcard album and was arranged in such a way that it put the fans on an emotional rollercoaster for two straight hours. One minute they played a slower, heart-wrenching song that brought tears to everyone's eyes and the next minute they were back to those face-melting riffs, getting the entire crowd off their feet to rock out as hard as they possibly could. In true Yellowcard fashion, their interaction with the crowd was like no other. For each and every song, they got the fans involved in some way whether it was waving their hands side to side, running a circle pit, jumping off their feet, or most importantly, screaming at the top of their lungs until their voices gave out. Key told the crowd, \"if you wake up tomorrow and tell your friends and family you had the best time tonight, you're lying because if you have a voice left, you didn't have the best time!\" \nIn true Yellowcard fashion, they ended the set with an immensely epic send-off by comprising the encore of their two biggest hits, \"Only One\" and the infamous \"Ocean Avenue.\" Yellowcard said their goodbyes with the two songs most near and dear to everyone's heart, the songs everyone has always and will always remember them by. It was truly a bittersweet moment when they took their final bows to close such a legendary performance. Ryan Key took to Instagram to note just how special the night was for him and the band: \"New York City. I have such a special place in my heart for you. From growing up a theatre kid and dreaming of your stages, to the band coming here for the first time on 9/11/2002 and seeing the Trade Center memorial lights beaming into the sky, to living on the corner of Broadway and Bleecker for a year in 2005, there are so many memories that came flooding back tonight. I took a minute to stand and enjoy the skyline tonight to end an unforgettable night. I think I speak for all of us by saying tonight's show was nothing short of epic. Thank you for all you've done for us. 'It's all for you'.\" \nHere's a snapshot of the entire setlist from beginning to end: \n1. Believe",

      "text": "By: Tech Desk | Updated: November 11, 2016 2:01 pm Donald Trump called for a boycott of Apple products back in February 2016 following the San Bernardino shooting (Image: File) \nAfter months of a deeply polarized election, Donald Trump emerged as the winner in the US Presidential race. For Silicon Valley, the news doesn’t come as a particularly good one, given the President-elect’s views on immigration, surveillanc, and other issues. While some like Microsoft ’s Satya Nadella, Facebook ’s Mark Zuckerberg have chosen to speak about the work ahead, Apple CEO Tim Cook has been publicily silent on the results. But he did send ‘all-hands’ memo to the company’s employees on Wednesday, reminding them that as a team they need to be united and how Apple has always cherised diversity. \nIn the memo, Tim Cook has asked the employees to understand that Apple has a rich diversity of employees, and even while many of them supported the other candidate – it was time to ‘move forward together’. He added that Apple products are developed to connect people everywhere, and that the company celebrates the ethnic diversity of its teams ‘regardless of what they look like’. \nHe wrote in the memo, “I’ve always looked at Apple as one big family and I encourage you to reach out to your co-workers if they are feeling anxious.” \nApple and Donald Trump do not have a smooth history, considering that the latter asked people to boycott Apple products (back in February 2016) until the Cupertino giant refused to help FBI break into the locked iPhone of the San Bernardino shooter. \nTim Cook had argued at the time that Apple is ‘a great American company’ and that doing so would help set a dangerous legal precedence for the country. Interestingly while Trump had been quick to call for a boycott of Apple products, he was found still tweeting from an iPhone. The President-elect has also said in his campaign, he will get Apple to manufacture in the United States, and not China. \nHere is the complete memo that Tim Cook had sent which was shared by Buzzfeed first. \nTeam, \nI’ve heard from many of you today about the presidential election. In a political contest where the candidates were so different and each received a similar number of popular votes, it’s inevitable that the aftermath leaves many of you with strong feelings. \nWe have a very diverse team of employees, including supporters of each of the candidates. Regardless of which candidate each of us supported as individuals, the only way to move forward is to move forward together. I recall something Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. said 50 years ago: “If you can’t fly, then run. If you can’t run, then walk. If you can’t walk, then crawl, but whatever you do you have to keep moving forward.” This advice is timeless, and a reminder that we only do great work and improve the world by moving forward. \nWhile there is discussion today about uncertainties ahead, you can be confident that Apple’s North Star hasn’t changed. Our products connect people everywhere, and they provide the tools for our customers to do great things to improve their lives and the world at large. Our company is open to all, and we celebrate the diversity of our team here in the United States and around the world — regardless of what they look like, where they come from, how they worship or who they love. \nI’ve always looked at Apple as one big family and I encourage you to reach out to your co-workers if they are feeling anxious. \nLet’s move forward — together!

      "text": "Image source: Apple.\nContinue Reading Below\nThe new TV app from Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is a great content aggregator. It collects all of the various video content consumers have access to through iTunes downloads, stand-alone streaming services, and on-demand streaming services that use pay-TV credentials. But there are a couple of major omissions: Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) .\nThose omissions have led many people to criticize the app, since at least 50 million Americans watch some of their television through Netflix or Amazon Prime Instant Video. That severely limits Apple's new app in its ability to find and recommend the best content for each user. What's more, it's unlikely Netflix will ever sign on.\nNetflix gets a lot of value out of controlling its user experience More From Fool.com Motley Fool Founders Issue New Stock Buy Alert Forget GE! Heres how to play the largest growth opportunity in history Forget Apple! Heres a Better Stock to Buy He Made 21,078% Buying Amazon. Heres His New Pick The big issue with Apple's TV app, from Netflix's standpoint, is that it cedes control of the user experience to Apple. That could be good for stand-alone networks and online pay-TV streaming portals, which generally have poor user interfaces and low adoption. But for Netflix, which has a quality user interface and strong adoption, it's unnecessary and even detrimental to its business.\nMost egregiously, Apple would take over the content recommendation from Netflix, something Netflix relies on to improve watch time and churn. Earlier this year, Netflix published a paper claiming its recommendation engine saves the company $1 billion per year . \"When produced and used correctly,\" the authors say, \"recommendations lead to meaningful increases in overall engagement with the product (e.g., streaming hours) and lower subscription cancellations rates.\"\nContinue Reading Below",

      "text": "Apple iPhone Cancelled, Reveals Leak; Disappointing New Year Ahead for iPhone Fans By Dipannita Nov 10, 2016 04:20 AM EST Apple iPhone Cancelled Advertisement \niPhone SE has been truly one of the bestseller smartphones for Apple but it looks like the tech giant is not looking to refresh its SE lineup. \nAt least this is what KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, the best Apple analyst, would like iPhone fans to believe. Advertisement \nIn his new research note, Kuo says that Apple has decided not to release an update for iPhone SE and there could be two reasons for this decision, reports Forbes . The company is doing this to increase margins on iPhone SE in the face of reducing prices of its older components. The second reason is that it will help to reduce the negative impact on the sales of iPhone 7 that is pretty expensive in comparison to the SE model. \nBoth these reasons are said to make financial sense for Apple as it has always shown more interest in profit share rather than market share. As for the apprehensions about the sales of iPhone 7, they are quite well-founded and it would really be embarrassing if sales reports force Apple to admit that iPhone SE outshone iPhone 7. \nHowever, it is not like the decision is all about benefits as there is also a flip side to it. It will cause a slump in the total sales figure. According to Kuo, the iPhone shipment is expected to go down by 10% in the second quarter of 2017 and sales would drop to 35 million units as compared to 40.4 million units that sold at the same time last year, claims 9to5Mac . Also, the 2016 figure was mostly due to the high demand for iPhone SE. \nComing back to stalling upgrade, Apple has taken the route in the past. It skipped MacBook Pro upgrades for many years and did the same with iPad generations too. iPhone has remained untouched but now it is also likely to witness the same action and going by the accuracy with which Kuo has made predictions about iPhones in the last 18 months, it seems users should be prepared to face the harsh reality. \nThe pocket-friendly and smart iPhone SE could really disappoint buyers this New Year. \n",

      "text": "0 An Apple employee stands behind boxes of iPad Air tablets at the Apple store in San Francisco, California November 1, 2013. Reuters/Stephen Lam \nSince the Apple iPad Air 2 was released on Oct. 22, 2014, there hasn’t been much refreshes on the product. iPad fans have been eagerly waiting for the Cupertino tech giant to reveal some details and specs about the successor, Apple iPad Air 3. Up to now, rumours about the iPad Air 3 have regularly surfaced online and fans have no other choice but to rely on these rumours. \nAccording to Tech Times , the Apple iPad Air 3 is expected to sport a 9.7-inch 4K display and will reportedly host the latest A10 processor from Apple. It will also be sleeker than its predecessor. \nThere is a possibility that the device will have a dual-camera setup. The primary camera could be of 8MP whereas the front-facing camera of 2.1MP. The primary camera may support LED flash. \nA bigger and better battery, a highly-improved display and a 4GB RAM are also expected in the device. A much sharper resolution than the iPad Air 2 is anticipated in Apple iPad Air 3. \nSome of the features that the device may come with include 3D Touch, fingerprint sensor, waterproof technology and four speakers. Apple will stick to its decision of not including the 3.5mm headphone jack in the device. \nWith the Apple iPad Air 3, Apple may introduce two new colour variants, namely, Rose Gold and Jet Black. There is no concrete information on the Apple iPad Air 3 release date. While some believe the device will be releases in March 2017, other say Apple may choose to end the Air line altogether, writes ValueWalk . \nIt is not known whether the iPad Air 3 will come with Apple Pencil support. Even if the device does support Apple Pencil, it won’t come free with the device. For now, users will have to wait till the first quarter of 2017 to fully understand if there will be an Apple iPad Air 3.",

      "text": "Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends \nApple’s refreshed MacBook Pro with its new Touch Bar , Touch ID support, and thinner chassis has been selling like hotcakes since its announcement on October 27. However, Apple hadn’t yet shipped the machines, leaving buyers with a bit of a lag between pushing the order button and getting satisfaction. \nThat appears to be changing, however, as Apple has begun transferring units from the factory to the shipping floor. Accordingly, excited MacBook Pro purchasers are started to receive notice that their machines are preparing for shipment, as 9to5Mac reports . \nMore: Despite the complaints, sales of the 2016 MacBook Pro have been incredibly brisk \nApparently, this is the step that directly precedes orders actually heading out the door and making their way to customers. If past history is any guide, it means that those lucky MacBook Pro buyers should be receiving their new MacOS machines in a matter of days. \nIn addition, some buyers with later shipping time frames have seen their orders update to an earlier date. This is a reversal of previous experiences where orders were shifting from “2-3 weeks” to “4-5 weeks” estimates. If you have an order that’s pending shipment, Apple won’t automatically notify you of these sorts of changes. And so, make sure you log into your account and check your order — you might find a pleasant surprise awaiting you. \nApple has run into something of a buzz saw given a perceived lack of innovation in the new MacBook Pros. In addition, the refreshed machines rely on USB Type-C ports exclusively and require a number of now-discounted Apple dongles to connect to legacy devices. To add insult to injury, the ports don’t appear to support legacy Thunderbolt 3 devices, leaving some customers even more upset. \nWith all of that controversy, we’re sure that Apple will be just as happy as its customers to start shipping the machines and getting them in the hands of users. Hopefully for Apple, those customers will start using their new MacBook Pros and posting nothing but positive reviews, and the sooner the company can ship the machines, the sooner the positivity can start flowing.
