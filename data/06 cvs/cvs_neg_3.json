      "text": "A major contract loss hurt CVS this week. EPS - Still expected to hit record levels in 2016 and 2017.\nSlower growth seems overly discounted.\nBad News = Good News for Investors\nBuying high quality shares right after they've sold off sharply on negative news is one of the surest ways to make nice returns.\nThe key to knowing when to be bold or when to stay away comes from examining a stock's own previous trading history when under similar circumstances. CVS Health (NYSE: CVS ) reported better than expected Q3 earnings of $1.64 per share on Tuesday. They simultaneously cut full year estimates slightly, to about $5.80 from $5.85 for 2016.\nThe big surprise came when CVS told analysts that 2017 appeared to be looking like only $5.88 against previous estimates of around $6.50. Boom! The shares plunged to under $70 early, down over 15% from Monday's closing quote and off by almost 39% from last summer's $113.60 peak.\nA quick review of CVS Health's fundamentals was just what the doctor ordered.\nCVS commanded an average multiple of 15.0x along with a 1.37% yield during the six post-recession years from 2010 through 2015. The four 'best buying opportunities' (green-starred below) came with P/Es ranging from 10x to 16x accompanied by 1.30% to 1.60% dividends.\nKnowing what CVS Health's 'normal' looked like makes understanding the drop from 2015's peak quite easy. The shares were quite pricey last summer at about 22x earnings (red-starred) while carrying a somewhat sub-par yield. 2016's pinnacle also suggested the stock was expensively valued.\n\nJust after the opening on Nov. 8, 2016, CVS was offered at $70.48. That represented only 12.1 times this year's already lowered estimate. The dividend sat at an attractive and well-covered 2.41%, the best in modern times for shareholders of this firm.\nThe past six years have been very solid. Tuesday's price showed that the stock price, after the election day fall, had stilled paralleled the rise in CVS's fundamentals (see table below).\nClick to enlarge \nNote that 2010 - 2011 also marked a slow-growth period for CVS. EPS grew just 2.3% and 4.1% year-over-year while the shares trended sideways. Once the profit pace picked back up, CVS ran from about $31 to $72 in under three years.\nCVS Health might tread water for a while but it's likely to have higher revenues, profits and dividends looking out over the next few years.\nWhat is CVS worth today? Applying a normalized 15x multiple to the company's, now flattish, 2016 estimate of $5.88 would justify a 12-month target price of $88. That leaves about 25% upside and appears entirely reasonable. Eighty-eight bucks falls about midway between today's quote and the stock's 52-week peak just north of $106.\nThat goal is far from an upper limit. CVS traded as high as $98.60 back in 2014 on EPS of $4.51. CVS's dividends is up 54.5% since then, providing additional support.\nOption sellers can take advantage of the pullback without trying to call an exact bottom. January 2019 puts at strikes of $70 to $80 were paying juicy premiums on Tuesday.\nI was able to snag $10.60 for the more conservative $70 strike dropping the potential 'if exercised' price to just $59.40. That would establish an implied P/E of just under 10.3x this year's estimate, right in line with the best entry points of 2010-2011.\nClick to enlarge \nFuture share price movement can never be guaranteed. WE do know for sure, though, that CVS hasn't changed hands for less than $60 since 2013. The break-even point on the 2019 LEAP put illustrated would have been profitable 100% of the time over the trailing three years.\nMaximum gains on this, or any other option sale, is keeping 100% of the premium received up front. Those desiring bigger upside might prefer writing the Jan. 2019, $80 put @ around $16 - $17 per share. The 'if put' price drops to $63 - $64 while expanding potential gain to at least $1,600 per contract sold.\nCVS remains a solid bet to be higher a couple of years down the road. Buy the shares, sells some puts or consider doing both.\nDisclosure: Long CVS shares, Short CVS 2018 & 2019 expiration date puts.\nDisclosure: I am/we are long CVS SHARES. \nI wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

      "text": "November 10, 2016 DAVID STESNER If you spend your free time browsing through Korean beauty websites in order to get your sheet-mask fix because your favorite skin shields aren't sold at your local drugstore, close your web browsers now because we've got some exciting news for you: Thanks to Beauty 360, a skin-care brand exclusively sold at CVS, you can now stock up on all of the sheet masks, face patches, and whatever you're dying to slather on your face—without having to pay for shipping. Starting tomorrow, Beauty 360 is launching its very own line of face, neck, and eye masks perfect for a night spent on the couch re-watching Gilmore Girls for the umpteenth time. (Like you, we've been marathoning the series before its Black Friday revival because yeah, we're that excited.) What's especially great about the line is that it features a wide variety of treatments targeted to your individual skin's needs, including an Extreme Pore Refining Mask to help diminish visible pores to a 24K Gold Hydrogel Intense Brightening Mask, which features niacinamide to illuminate dull, tired-looking skin. But wait, there's more: Every item in the mask collection retails for $5.99 to $7.99 each, which means adding a mask (or two!) to your virtual cart won't make too much of a dent in your holiday shopping fund. (Speaking of holiday shopping, have you checked out our holiday gift picks under $50 yet?) So no matter what you're batting—breakouts, fine lines, stressed-skin—there's at least one mask for you. Our favorite? The Charcoal Hydrogel Soothing Eye Masks, which target those pesky under-eye circles (and will fit perfectly in our carry-on come Thanksgiving). More exciting skin-care launches to freak out about:",

      "title": "CVS Health: Yield Boosting Decline",
      "text": "Summary \nCVS Health shocked the market with a substantial reduction in the expected EPS for next year. \nThe company approved a massive stock buyback program in comparison to the greatly reduced market cap. \nCVS Health is appealing on dips though the weak balance sheet limits the immediate ability to support the stock on this big dip. Carnage in another healthcare related stock probably shouldn't be a shock. The reason for the decline in CVS Health (NYSE: CVS ) could provide opportunity though the Trump victory has already reduced some of the upside potential. The market is highly focused on removing costs from any healthcare company whether drug or pharmacy related. The huge drop in the stock from the 2015 highs might provide an opportunity as the company ramps up capital returns, a typical sign that value exists. Click to enlarge Surprising Hit CVS stumped the market by reporting a big EPS beat for Q3 and guiding to a halt in profit growth in 2017. The stock though down from a high above $100 early this year still plunged nearly 12% to $73. The recent Trump rally already has the stock back above $77. The company recently saw some major shifts in the marketplace detailed in the below slide. Basically, an estimated 40 million retail prescriptions will shift out of their stores. Click to enlarge Source: CVS Health Q316 presentation The real question is where this leaves the stock going forward. The company still suggests the possibility for 10% EPS growth going forward. The number seems highly unlikely at this point. Yield Possibility One number that really stood out in the quarterly report is that CVS only spent $50 million during the quarter on stock buybacks despite a large approval remaining. Apparently, the company knew that guidance would hit the stock and held off on buybacks. The company though approved another $15.0 billion worth of stock buybacks. With the $3.7 billion remaining on the previous approval, CVS Health now has an incredible $18.7 billion of approved firepower. Considering the company reigned in stock buybacks, a return during Q4 would clearly be a bullish sign. With the market cap down to $82 billion, the company already has a solid net payout yield (net stock buybacks + dividend yield) at 8.5%. This yield could soar if CVS were to use a decent amount of the approved buyback. Over the last three years, the pharmacy benefits company hadn't spent more than $2 billion during any quarter so one maybe shouldn't expect a huge boost to the yield. From a strict net payout yield concept, the current yield is solid but the outsized potential only exists if CVS Health executes on the massive approval that could scoop up over 20% of the outstanding shares. The company has about $2.2 billion in cash with a large debt load of $26.0 billion so any aggressive move appears unlikely. The typical point missed in the focus on growing earnings is that CVS expects to generate large free cash flows that can be utilized for these buybacks whether growth exists or not. Takeaway The key investor takeaway is that profits may be under pressure at CVS Health, but the stock offers an attractive net payout yield down at the recent lows. The dividend yield is now solid at 2.2% so one should look at owning the stock on dips.

Among the largest underlying components of XLP, in trading today Philip Morris International Inc (Symbol: PM) is off about 3.4%, Altria Group Inc (Symbol: MO) is off about 4.3%, and CVS Health Corporation (Symbol: CVS) is up by about 0.4%. For a complete list of holdings, visit the XLP Holdings page » The chart below shows the one year price performance of XLP, versus its 200 day moving average: Looking at the chart above, XLP's low point in its 52 week range is $47.39 per share, with $56.02 as the 52 week high point - that compares with a last trade of $50.62. Comparing the most recent share price to the 200 day moving average can also be a useful technical analysis technique -- learn more about the 200 day moving average » . Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.",

      "text": "0   \nThis week I ran into CVS to get a great deal on Pampers Training Pants and a few other deals. I don’t need training pants yet, but I know that I will in about 6 months so grabbing them for $3.99 a pack (really less after rewards) is a deal to not miss! These are crazy expensive normally. \nI shared everything we got on a Facebook Live video earlier this week including how I broke down the transactions. You can watch it above. \nCVS Totals \nTotal Spent: $13.61 ECB Remaining: $6 \nI had $20 in Extra Care bucks that I used on the first purchase and then still left with some rewards to start with next week. Walking out the door with 4 packs of Easy Ups alone for $13.61 is pretty awesome, but then to realize that we also had 3 nail polish sets, two lip glosses, 5 boxes of Pop Tarts and 2 boxes of Ziplocs… that’s 16 items coming out to less than $1 per item!! \nHave I mentioned recently that I love CVS? \nIf you aren’t shopping the drugstores, I encourage you to get your feet wet there over the next few weeks to that you are ready for the great deals in the CVS Black Friday Ad . With over 18 freebies you are going to want to know how the drugstore game works that week!! \nHow was your savings this week? Leave a comment or a link to your savings post.",

      "text": "Leave a Comment The CVS corporate office has discovered that a forged prescription was filled at the CVS pharmacy located inside Target at Rolling Acres Plaza. On Nov. 2, the local pharmacy was alerted by the corporate office about the forged prescription for Phenergan/Codeine cough syrup, according to an incident from the Lady Lake Police Department. The forged prescription, which appeared to be written from a medical office on Old Camp Road and filled on Sept. 1, was made out for what appears to be a fictitious woman living on the Historic Side of The Villages. The driver’s license number provided for the woman was tracked to a man living in Pompano Beach. The Drug Enforcement Agency determined that the number listed on the prescription did not match any of the doctors whose names were listed on the form. The person who picked up the prescription paid in cash, according to the incident report.",

      "text": "We know that one of the biggest struggles of being obsessed with makeup is that visits to Ulta , CVS , Sephora , or your favorite department store (whether it&apos;s in person or online) become a must. These places are the source for the makeup brands you can&apos;t live without, and you spend way more money at them than you&apos;d like to talk about. Today, we&apos;re here to help you with your Ulta visits. Here are six ways to save money the next time you land on the website or pop into the store.\nJoin the Ulta Rewards Program .\nIf you haven&apos;t done this yet, get on it. By becoming a program member, you can earn points on purchases, and get exclusive deals and discounts on products. Membership is free, and all you have to do is present your membership card at checkout if you&apos;re in the store, or make sure your membership ID is included when you&apos;re shopping online. Every dollar you spend counts as one rewards point, which you can use toward purchases, or, if you&apos;ve saved up a bunch, you could get a product for free.\nDon&apos;t ignore or opt out of the emails once you become a member.\nBecause those Ulta emails might contain information about products that will earn you bonus points . Yup, bonus points means that the purchase of certain items earns you double the points, and sometimes you&apos;ll have the chance to double up on bonus point offers. We&apos;ll let this excerpt from its website explain: \"On really pretty days, Ultamate Rewards may also offer a chance to combine two or more bonus offers on a qualifying purchase. When this occurs, base points are earned only once. For example, if a member buys $25 worth of a skin care product when we offer 2X points for that product, and another offer for 3X points on your entire purchase, the total points earned would be 100 points. Let&apos;s do the beauty math: 25 base points + 25 bonus points from the 2X product specific bonus offer + 50 bonus points from the 3X on your entire purchase = 100 points.\"\nUse other manufacturers&apos; coupons at Ulta.\nYou&apos;re going to want to start clipping coupons again. According to this blog , you can use the coupons you get in those ad circulators with your Sunday paper at Ulta. The person who wrote the blog says she likes to use the coupons she finds for hard-to-find nail polishes, Revlon, and Neutrogena at Ulta (Don&apos;t forget, you&apos;ll still get points for these purchases). You can even pair these coupons with Ulta coupons for a bigger deal.\nRELATED: 9 Truly Easy Ways to Save Money on Beauty Products\nTry to spend at least $450 at Ulta within a year.\nThis shouldn&apos;t be hard for the true makeup lovers. Once you spend $450, you get to enter the special Platinum Status . No longer will you only get one point for every dollar you spend. Now you&apos;ll get 1.25 points for every dollar spent. Also, while regular members&apos; points expire at the end of the quarter one year after the date they were acquired, platinum points last forever. They&apos;ll also get you a special something for your birthday—you&apos;ll not only get your usual birthday gift that all members get, but an extra present, too.\nHoard your points for as long as you can.\nOne Reddit user pointed out that it&apos;s much smarter to hold on to your points for as long as you can instead of using them sparingly. She saved up 2,000 points and was able to snag the Urban Decay Vice Eyeshadow Palette , the Too Faced Chocolate Bar Eye Shadow Collection , and two Batiste dry shampoos for only $2.11. On a typical shopping trip, that would total up to $121! The user also makes a serious case for becoming a Platinum member and going to the Ulta salon. \"The really great part about this is that I did not spend $2,000 to get 2,000 points. I earned most of them during the 10x points week for Platinum Members,\" she writes. \"I got a haircut, highlights, I took my husband for a haircut, and I bought all my shampoo, body wash, and random necessities, like stocking up on makeup wipes. If I spent $100 on my hair, that&apos;s 1,000 points right there.\"\nCheck Ulta&apos;s \"Buy More, Save More\" page once a week.\nThis convenient page on the company&apos;s website lists all of the sales and bargains that are going on. For example, right now you can buy three Stila Lip Glazes for $15, while supplies last. And if you buy one Tony Moly mask, you can get one for 50 percent off. Even better, if you buy one Mizani product, you can get one free. The page is full of deals. Never shop online at Ulta without checking it first.\nMore Related Stories:\n- 7 Genius Ways to Hack Your Next Sephora Trip\n- The 11 Best-Selling Beauty Products at Sephora in September\n- It&apos;s Sephora VIB Sale Time",

      "text": "(CNN) - CVS shares plunged in trade Tuesday after the drugstore chain lowered its profit forecast for 2016 and warned of losing tens of millions of prescriptions next year.\nThe company also reported a sharp rise in third quarter profits and revenue, but investors apparently focused on the poorer outlook.\nCVS said it could lose 40 million prescriptions in 2017 as a result of new restricted networks.\nFor example, Walgreens has formed partnerships that block people from filling prescriptions at CVS drugstores.\nAlso, the U.S. Defense Department's health care program Tricare is leaving the CVS Network.\nCopyright 2016 CNN.

      "text": "Stocks mentioned in this story: WMT , TGT , CVS , BBY , HD , CSCO \nLo, Donald Trump was elected to the highest office in the land, and there was much weeping and gnashing of teeth . The heavens opened, blood rained from the sky, and … then the Dow Jones industrial average ran out to all-time highs. \nFor now, it appears like the market is back to business as usual despite Trump's election shocker, and that means earnings are once again back in the spotlight. The tech sector is mostly wrapping things up, and we're now transitioning to a healthy slate of retail reports. \nHere's a look at this week's featured companies: \nWal-Mart Stores ( WMT ). If Wal-Mart has a theme for 2016, it's \"the comeback.\" Wal-Mart entered the year trying to recover from 30 percent losses in 2015. And while WMT has more than doubled the market in 2016, it has done so despite a couple precipitous drops. \n[See: What 8 CEOs Are Saying About Donald Trump's Victory .] \nThe most recent setback was in early October, when Wal-Mart reiterated its expectations for the current fiscal year's earning. Wal-Mart said the 2018 fiscal year would be flat and guided 2019 at 5 percent profit growth – both projections lower what the company estimated at last year's investor day, a disaster that sent WMT stock to its worst-ever single-day loss. \nWal-Mart is playing the long game now, diverting more of its capital expenditures into store remodels, distribution centers and e-commerce improvements, and pulling back on store openings. Still, WMT is building a head of steam in its operations, putting together its biggest gain in same-store sales in four years back in the second quarter. \nWMT reports Thursday before the bell, and Wall Street is expecting a 3 percent decline in earnings to 96 cents per share on a 1 percent revenue bump to $118.6 billion. Barclays, which is projecting a cent more in earnings for the third quarter, sees new shoppers and better current-customer spend being a potential catalyst for the quarter, though food deflation and discount competitors could hold Wal-Mart back.",

      "text": "View More Jobs \nATLANTA , Nov. 14, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- The American Cancer Society and the CVS Health Foundation today awarded grants to 20 U.S. colleges and universities as part of their Tobacco-Free Generation Campus Initiative (TFGCI), a $3.6 million multi-year program intended to accelerate and expand the adoption and implementation of 100 percent smoke- and tobacco-free campus policies. The announcement coincides this week with the American Cancer Society Great American Smokeout. \nExperience the interactive Multimedia News Release here: http://www.multivu.com/players/English/7963951-cvs-health-tobacco-free-campus \nThe Tobacco-Free Generation Campus Initiative is part of Be The First , CVS Health's five-year, $50 million initiative that supports education, advocacy, tobacco control, and healthy behavior programming to help deliver the nation's first tobacco-free generation. CVS Health has set actionable and measurable goals for Be The First , including a doubling of the number of tobacco-free college and university campuses in the United States . \n\"With our partners at CVS Health, we are excited to support the efforts of many dedicated students, faculty and staff to make their campuses smoke- and tobacco-free using proven strategies that will also reduce tobacco use among students,\" said Gary M. Reedy , Chief Executive Officer for the American Cancer Society. \"To be successful in creating a tobacco-free generation, it is important that we prevent and eliminate lethal and addictive tobacco use among college students.\" \nThe American Cancer Society Great American Smokeout will take place on Thursday, November 17 . The annual intervention effort encourages smokers to quit for a day, quit for good, or make a plan to quit, and raises awareness around the many tools and resources they can use to help them quit. \nGrant Recipients from Coast to Coast \nOver the next three years, the Tobacco-Free Generation Campus Initiative will award grants to a total of 125 colleges and universities throughout the U.S. with the greatest need for stronger tobacco prevention and control. The grants will help schools successfully advocate for, adopt and implement 100 percent smoke- and tobacco-free campus policies. Campuses will also receive technical assistance and resources to support their efforts with education, communications, cessation, and evaluation. \nThe University of Pennsylvania is one of the first 20 grant recipients, and is working towards becoming the first Ivy League institution to adopt a 100 percent tobacco-free campus policy. \n\"We are grateful to be among the recipients of the American Cancer Society/CVS Health Foundation tobacco control grant as it recognizes and supports Penn's commitment to a tobacco-free campus,\" said Penn President Amy Gutmann . \"Under the leadership of Penn pulmonologist Frank Leone , we have developed an innovative, interdisciplinary approach to smoking cessation that has yielded unprecedented success in just two years. Frank Leone and his colleagues understand the complexity of the problem of tobacco dependence and the need to take a long-term view to change tobacco behaviors. This generous grant will greatly aid the University's ongoing efforts to effectively address this major public health epidemic.\" \nOther grant recipients include: Bowling Green State University ( Ohio ), California State University San Marcos , Davenport University (Mich.), East Carolina University (N.C.), El Paso Community College ( Texas ), Indiana University Bloomington , Lenoir-Rhyne University (N.C.), Merritt College (Calif.), Montclair State University (N.J.), Oakland University (Mich.), Penn State University (Pa.), Piedmont Community College (N.C.), Saint Mary's College of California , Springfield College (Mass.), St. Xavier University (Ill.), Texas Christian University , Texas A&M University - Corpus Christi , University of Cincinnati Blue Ash College ( Ohio ) and University of Michigan . \nPublic Support for Tobacco Control on Campus \nTFGCI grants are intended to address a critical, unmet need by supporting efforts to advocate for, establish and institute smoke- and tobacco-free campus policies. The U.S. Department of Education reports there are approximately 4,700 institutions of higher education in the United States . According to the Americans for Nonsmokers' Rights Foundation, only 1,427 campuses are 100-percent smoke- and tobacco-free. That reflects major progress over earlier years, but much remains to be done. \nAccording to a new national Morning Consult poll of 2,202 registered voters commissioned by CVS Health on October 12-18 2016 , there is strong public support for addressing the continued impact of tobacco use on college and university campuses. Among the key poll findings: Seventy-six-percent of Americans think youth smoking and/or tobacco use is a problem. Similarly, 69% of Americans think college student smoking and/or tobacco use is a problem. More than half of Americans (56%) think the number of tobacco-free campuses is too low. This is similar among U.S. college students where the combined percentage is 54 percent. Three-quarters (75%) of Americans support policies that prohibit smoking and other tobacco use on college campuses. Fifty-two percent of Americans think whether or not a campus is tobacco-free is an important consideration when applying to, and potentially attending, a college/university, ranking behind academic quality (86%) and quality of housing (79%), but ahead of how competitive athletic teams are (38%). \n\"We're at a critical moment in our nation's efforts to end the epidemic of smoking and tobacco use, and expanding the number of tobacco-free college and university campuses is an important step in our efforts,\" said Troyen A. Brennan, M.D., M.P.H., and Chief Medical Officer for CVS Health. \"We're confident our strategy will drive a significant decline in the number of new college-age smokers, and contribute to the progress being made where a tobacco-free generation in the U.S. seems possible.\" \nAccepting Applications for New Grants \nIn partnership with the CVS Health Foundation, the American Cancer Society will begin accepting online applications for the next round of Tobacco-Free Generation Initiative (TFGCI) grants. The fall grant cycle will run through February 28, 2017 with the names of grant recipients to be announced in May 2017 . \nIn addition to grants, colleges and universities will receive technical assistance throughout the tobacco-free policy planning and implementation process. Technical assistance will be provided through webinars, online resources and limited one-on-one consultations. \nTo learn more about the Tobacco-Free Generation Campus Initiative (TFGCI), U.S. colleges and universities are encouraged to visit www.CVSHealth.com/tobaccofreecampus .

      "text": "Tip : Use comma (,) to separate multiple quotes. Learn more... \nMon, Nov 14, 2016, 23:57 GMT - UK Markets closed Cramer uncovers what is really ailing CVS Health By Abigail Stevenson | CNBC – 19 minutes ago 81.76 +0.71 After years of outperformance, the stock of CVS Health suffered a 10-point straight decline last week, leading Jim Cramer to wonder if it is a broken company or merely a broken stock. \n\"CVS has gone from a market darling to a total dog, as its once-vaunted pharmacy benefit manager business has become an albatross around its neck and the company loses share to its rivals,\" the \" Mad Money \" host said. \nShares of CVS tripled from the summer of 2011 to the summer of 2015, but then fell into free-fall. They closed at $76 on Monday. The business includes both its 7,800 retail pharmacies, and its pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) segments. \nCramer boiled down CVS' issues for investors. For years, CVS was the PBM of choice for the California Public Employees Retirement System, but at the end of May it lost that business to OptumRx. Analysts at the time indicated there was increased competition in the PBM space. \nWhen CVS reported in early August, it had mixed numbers, but management raised full year guidance. It also said that its PBM business had a strong selling season despite the departure of some high-profile clients. \nHowever in August, Walgreens announced it would partner with Prime Therapeutics to better compete with companies like CVS. Just over a month ago, CVS was ousted from the pharmacy network that it runs for the Department of Defense, with Walgreens taking its place. \nThus, when CVS reported last Tuesday and slashed its guidance, leaving Cramer and many investors confused. \n\"I have to admit, it was pretty confusing given that management had just raised numbers three months ago — it made them seem clueless,\" Cramer said. \nWhile the company had a top-line miss and a bottom-line beat, it was the guidance that concerned him. CVS said it expects to lose 40 million prescriptions next year. The culprit was competition, particularly from Walgreens, Cramer said. \nWhile CVS outlined various initiatives to help offset the damage, Cramer said they don't fix the core issue of competition. \n\"Maybe they can turn things around, but for now, CVS remains in the penalty box until we see them take concrete steps to lessen their dependence on what was once the golden goose, now just a turkey headed for a carving,\" Cramer said. \nCVS did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment. \nQuestions for Cramer?

      "text": "  <p>Cramer uncovers what is really ailing CVS Health</p> <p>Jim Cramer got to the bottom of why CVS&rsquo;s stock has dropped so quickly, and why he&#039;s got it in the penalty box.</p> 44 Mins Ago | 11:23 \nAfter years of outperformance, the stock of CVS Health suffered a 10-point straight decline last week, leading Jim Cramer to wonder if it is a broken company or merely a broken stock. \n\"CVS has gone from a market darling to a total dog, as its once-vaunted pharmacy benefit manager business has become an albatross around its neck and the company loses share to its rivals,\" the \" Mad Money \" host said. \nShares of CVS tripled from the summer of 2011 to the summer of 2015, but then fell into free-fall. They closed at $76 on Monday. The business includes both its 7,800 retail pharmacies, and its pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) segments. \nCramer boiled down CVS' issues for investors. For years, CVS was the PBM of choice for the California Public Employees Retirement System, but at the end of May it lost that business to OptumRx. Analysts at the time indicated there was increased competition in the PBM space. John Tlumacki | The Boston Globe | Getty Images CVS Pharmacy medicine \"I have to admit, it was pretty confusing given that management had just raised numbers three months ago — it made them seem clueless.\" -Jim Cramer \nWhen CVS reported in early August, it had mixed numbers, but management raised full year guidance. It also said that its PBM business had a strong selling season despite the departure of some high-profile clients. \nHowever in August, Walgreens announced it would partner with Prime Therapeutics to better compete with companies like CVS. Just over a month ago, CVS was ousted from the pharmacy network that it runs for the Department of Defense, with Walgreens taking its place. \nThus, when CVS reported last Tuesday and slashed its guidance, leaving Cramer and many investors confused. \n\"I have to admit, it was pretty confusing given that management had just raised numbers three months ago — it made them seem clueless,\" Cramer said. \nWhile the company had a top-line miss and a bottom-line beat, it was the guidance that concerned him. CVS said it expects to lose 40 million prescriptions next year. The culprit was competition, particularly from Walgreens, Cramer said. \nWhile CVS outlined various initiatives to help offset the damage, Cramer said they don't fix the core issue of competition. \n\"Maybe they can turn things around, but for now, CVS remains in the penalty box until we see them take concrete steps to lessen their dependence on what was once the golden goose, now just a turkey headed for a carving,\" Cramer said. \nCVS did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment. \n ",

( more ) Used my drone to catch my wife meeting a guy at the local CVS. She had been getting called in early to work more often the past couple weeks, and then I got a call from someone telling me something was going on. I tried to follow her a couple times prior but both times she went to work, so I'm not sure if she was getting tipped off or I was just unlucky. So I took the drone up and that worked. Any questions you have ask in the comments. Thanks. Jukin Media Verified (Original) *For licensing/ permission to use: Contact: [email protected] Originally collected by reddit ( less ) Embed:",

      "title": "CVS Health Reports Third Quarter Results",
      "text": "WOONSOCKET, R.I. , Nov. 8, 2016 /PRNewswire/ --\nThird Quarter Year-over-year Highlights:\nNet revenues increased 15.5% to $44.6 billion GAAP operating profit increased 20.9% to $2.8 billion GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations of $1.43 Adjusted EPS increased 28.0% to $1.64 GAAP and Adjusted EPS both include a benefit of approximately 5 cents per share related to a lower income tax rate primarily due to the resolution of tax matters previously forecasted for the fourth quarter Continue Reading\nCVS Health logo Year-to-date Highlights:\nCash flow from operations of $7.9 billion Generated free cash flow of $6.6 billion 2016 Guidance:\nFull year GAAP diluted EPS lowered and narrowed to $4.84 to $4.90 from $4.92 to $5.00 , including third quarter acquisition-related integration costs Full year Adjusted EPS lowered and narrowed to $5.77 to $5.83 from $5.81 to $5.89 Provided fourth quarter GAAP diluted EPS of $1.52 to $1.58 , excluding acquisition-related integration costs Provided fourth quarter Adjusted EPS of $1.64 to $1.70 , up 7.00% to 10.75% Raised full year cash flow from operations to $9.3 to $9.5 billion ; free cash flow to $6.8 to $7.0 billion 2017 Preliminary Outlook:\nProvided full year GAAP diluted EPS of $5.16 to $5.33 Provided full year Adjusted EPS of $5.77 to $5.93 Both include the projected loss of more than 40 million retail prescriptions related to new restricted pharmacy networks GAAP diluted EPS includes impact of previously announced termination of pension plan CVS Health Corporation (NYSE: CVS ) today announced operating results for the three months ended September 30, 2016.\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer Larry Merlo stated, \"We posted a solid third quarter with the PBM exceeding our expectations and retail performing at the lower end of our expectations. However, very recent pharmacy network changes in the marketplace are expected to cause some retail prescriptions to begin migrating out of our pharmacies this quarter. In addition, we are currently experiencing slowing prescription growth in the overall market as well as a soft seasonal business. These factors combined are leading us to reduce the mid-point of our guidance for this year by five cents per share. The network changes have more significant implications for our 2017 outlook. While we expect a healthy increase in PBM operating profit growth in 2017, we expect a decrease in retail operating profit growth.\"\nMr. Merlo continued, \"We remain confident in our model and we are targeting 10% growth in Adjusted EPS for the longer term, as we continue to introduce new and innovative ways to drive value for patients, payors, and providers.\"\nRevenues\nNet revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased 15.5%, or $6.0 billion , to $44.6 billion , compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. Revenues in the Pharmacy Services Segment increased 19.2%, or $4.9 billion , to $30.4 billion in the three months ended September 30, 2016. The increase was primarily driven by increased pharmacy network claim volume and growth in specialty pharmacy. Pharmacy network claims processed during the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased 23.3% to 282.6 million, compared to 229.1 million in the prior year. The increase in pharmacy network claim volume was primarily due to the growth in net new business. Mail choice claims processed during the three months ended September 30, 2016, increased 2.5%, to 22.4 million, compared to 21.9 million in the prior year. The increase in mail choice claims was primarily driven by the continued adoption of our Maintenance Choice ® offerings.\nRevenues in the Retail/LTC Segment increased 12.5%, or $2.2 billion , to approximately $20.1 billion , in the three months ended September 30, 2016. The increase was primarily driven by the addition of the long-term care (\"LTC\") pharmacy operations acquired as part of the acquisition of Omnicare, Inc. (\"Omnicare\") in August 2015 , the addition of the pharmacies and clinics of Target Corporation (\"Target\") acquired in December 2015 and pharmacy same store sales growth. Same store sales increased 2.3% versus the third quarter of 2015. Pharmacy same store sales rose 3.4% and pharmacy same store prescription volumes rose 3.0% on a 30-day equivalent basis. Pharmacy same store sales were negatively affected by approximately 340 basis points from recent generic drug introductions. Front store same store sales decreased 1.0%, which were negatively affected by softer customer traffic partially offset by an increase in basket size.\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2016, the generic dispensing rate increased approximately 160 basis points to 85.4% in the Pharmacy Services Segment and increased approximately 100 basis points to 85.8% in the Retail/LTC Segment.\nOperating Profit\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2016, consolidated operating profit increased $486 million , or 20.9%. Excluding acquisition-related integration costs of $65 million in 2016 and acquisition-related transaction and integration costs of $127 million in 2015, consolidated operating profit increased $424 million , or 17.3%, from $2,458 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $2,882 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016. For the three months ended September 30, 2016 , operating profit increased $296 million , or 25.3%, to $1,458 million in the Pharmacy Services Segment and $130 million , or 7.9%, to $1,773 million in the Retail/LTC Segment. Excluding acquisition-related integration costs of $52 million and $12 million in the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, the Retail/LTC Segment operating profit grew $170 million , or 10.3%, to $1,825 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016. Both segments benefited from increased generic drugs dispensed. The Pharmacy Services Segment was also positively affected by growth in specialty pharmacy, growth in Medicare Part D lives and favorable purchasing economics. The Retail/LTC Segment was also positively affected by the acquisition of the pharmacies and clinics of Target and the acquisition of Omnicare's LTC business as well as an improved front store margin rate. These positive factors for both segments were partially offset by continued pricing in the Pharmacy Services Segment and reimbursement pressure in the Retail/LTC Segment.\nNet Income and Earnings Per Share\nNet income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $1.5 billion , an increase of $294 million or 23.6%. The increase in net income is primarily due to the $486 million increase in operating profit discussed above partially offset by a\n$101 million loss on early extinguishment of debt. Net income also benefited, by approximately $0.05 per share, from a lower income tax rate, which was primarily due to the resolution of income tax matters previously forecasted in the fourth quarter.\nGAAP earnings per diluted share from continuing operations (\"GAAP diluted EPS\") for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $1.43 , compared to $1.10 in the prior year. Adjusted earnings per share (\"Adjusted EPS\") for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, was $1.64 and $1.28 , respectively. Adjusted EPS excludes $197 million and $160 million of intangible asset amortization for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Adjusted EPS for the three months ended September 30, 2016 also excludes $65 million of acquisition-related integration costs and the loss on early extinguishment of debt of $101 million . Adjusted EPS for the three months ended September 30, 2015 also excludes $127 million of acquisition-related transaction and integration costs and $16 million of acquisition-related bridge financing costs. Further detail is shown in the Adjusted Earnings Per Share reconciliation later in this release.\nGuidance\nThe Company lowered and narrowed full year GAAP diluted EPS to $4.84 to $4.90 from $4.92 to $5.00 , including acquisition-related integration costs recorded in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 . The Company lowered and narrowed full year Adjusted EPS to $5.77 to $5.83 from $5.81 to $5.89 . Estimated acquisition-related integration costs for the fourth quarter of 2016 are excluded from the 2016 guidance. Further detail is shown in the 2016 Adjusted Earnings Per Share Guidance reconciliation attached to this release.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company expects to deliver GAAP diluted EPS of $1.52 to $1.58 . The Company expects to deliver Adjusted EPS of $1.64 to $1.70 . Further detail is shown in the 2016 Adjusted Earnings Per Share Guidance reconciliation attached to this release.\nThe Company raised cash flow guidance for 2016 and now expects to deliver cash flow from operations of $9.3 billion to $9.5 billion and 2016 free cash flow of $6.8 billion to $7.0 billion . Further detail is shown in the 2016 Free Cash Flow Guidance reconciliation attached to this release.\n2017 Preliminary Outlook\nThe Company provided a preliminary outlook for 2017. GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $5.16 to $5.33 and Adjusted EPS is expected to be in the range of $5.77 to $5.93 . Included in this outlook is the impact from the projected loss of more than 40 million retail prescriptions related to marketplace changes, including new retail pharmacy networks that are excluding CVS Pharmacy drugstores. The GAAP outlook includes the expected impact of the previously-announced termination of one of the Company's pension plans and excludes the impact of integration costs related to the acquisition of Omnicare, which will be updated as the year progresses. Further detail is shown in the 2017 Preliminary Outlook reconciliation later in this release.\nNew Share Repurchase Authorization\nThe share repurchase authorization approved in December 2014 is nearing completion with approximately $3.7 billion remaining. Reflecting the board's ongoing commitment to returning value to shareholders, the Company announced that, consistent with its practice, the board of directors approved a new share repurchase program for up to $15 billion of the Company's outstanding common stock. Combined with the approximately $3.7 billion that remains from the 2014 program, the Company has approximately $18.7 billion available for share repurchases. The share repurchase authorization, which is effective immediately and is expected to be completed over a multi-year period, permits the Company to effect the repurchases from time to time through a combination of open market repurchases, privately negotiated transactions, accelerated share repurchase transactions, and/or other derivative transactions.\nReal Estate Program\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company opened 48 new retail stores and closed 6 retail stores. In addition, the Company relocated 11 retail stores. As of September 30, 2016, the Company operated 9,694 retail stores, including pharmacies in Target stores, in 49 states, the District of Columbia , Puerto Rico and Brazil .\nTeleconference and Webcast\nThe Company will be holding a conference call today for the investment community at 8:30 am (ET) to discuss its quarterly results.

The Company uses the non-GAAP measures \"Adjusted EPS\" and \"Free Cash Flow\" to assess and analyze underlying business performance and trends. Management believes that providing these non-GAAP measures enhances investors' understanding of the Company's performance.\nThe Company defines Adjusted Earnings per Share, or Adjusted EPS, as net income excluding the impact of the amortization of intangible assets, acquisition-related transaction and integration costs, acquisition-related bridge financing costs, charge related to a disputed 1999 legal settlement and loss on early extinguishment of debt divided by the Company's weighted average diluted shares outstanding. The Company believes that this measure enhances investors' ability to compare the Company's past financial performance with its current performance.\nThe Company defines Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by operating activities less net additions to properties and equipment (i.e., additions to property and equipment plus proceeds from sale-leaseback transactions). Management uses this non-GAAP financial measure for internal comparisons and finds it useful in assessing year-over-year cash flow performance.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are provided as supplemental information to the financial measures presented in this press release that are calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EPS should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, income before income tax provision as a measure of our performance. Free Cash Flow should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. The Company's definitions of Adjusted EPS and Free Cash Flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measurements reported by other companies.\nThe Company has not provided a reconciliation of the long-term Adjusted EPS target announced today to GAAP EPS. The Company is unable to reasonably estimate the GAAP items excluded from the multi-year, long-term Adjusted EPS target.\nAdjusted Earnings Per Share\n(Unaudited)\nThe following is a reconciliation of income before income tax provision to Adjusted EPS:\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\nIn millions, except per share amounts\n2016\n2015\n2016\n2015\nIncome before income tax provision\n$\n2,463\n$\n2,070\n$\n5,884\n$\n6,163\nNon-GAAP adjustments:\nAmortization of intangible assets\n197\n160\n593\n419\nAcquisition-related transaction and integration costs (1)\n65\n127\n207\n147\nAcquisition-related bridge financing costs (1)\n—\n16\n—\n52\nCharge related to a disputed 1999 legal settlement\n—\n—\n3\n—\nLoss on early extinguishment of debt\n101\n—\n643\n—\nAdjusted income before income tax provision\n2,826\n2,373\n7,330\n6,781\nAdjusted income tax provision\n1,063\n933\n2,832\n2,658\nAdjusted income from continuing operations\n1,763\n1,440\n4,498\n4,123\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interest\n(1)\n(1)\n(2)\n(1)\nAdjusted income allocable to participating securities\n(8)\n(6)\n(23)\n(18)\nAdjusted income from continuing operations attributable to\n CVS Health\n$\n1,754\n$\n1,433\n$\n4,473\n$\n4,104\nWeighted average diluted shares outstanding\n1,073\n1,121\n1,082\n1,130\nAdjusted EPS\n$\n1.64\n$\n1.28\n$\n4.13\n$\n3.63\n(1) Costs associated with the acquisitions of Omnicare and the pharmacies and clinics of Target.\nFree Cash Flow\n(Unaudited)\nThe following is a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow:\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\nIn millions\n2016\n2015\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n7,948\n$\n4,841\nSubtract: Additions to property and equipment\n(1,607)\n(1,490)\nAdd: Proceeds from sale-leaseback transactions\n230\n34\nFree cash flow\n$\n6,571\n$\n3,385\nSupplemental Information\n(Unaudited)\nThe Company evaluates its Pharmacy Services Segment and Retail/LTC Segment performance based on net revenue, gross profit and operating profit before the effect of nonrecurring charges and gains and certain intersegment activities.

These occur in the following ways: when members of Pharmacy Services Segment clients (\"members\") fill prescriptions at our retail stores to purchase covered products, when members enrolled in programs such as Maintenance Choice ® elect to pick up maintenance prescriptions at one of our retail stores instead of receiving them through the mail, or when members have prescriptions filled at our long-term care pharmacies. When these occur, both the Pharmacy Services and Retail/LTC segments record the revenues, gross profit and operating profit on a standalone basis.\n(3) The Retail/LTC Segment gross profit for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 includes $5 million and $15 million, respectively, of acquisition-related integration costs. The integration costs are related to the acquisitions of Omnicare and the pharmacies and clinics of Target.\n(4) The Retail/LTC Segment operating profit for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 includes $52 million and $194 million, respectively, of acquisition-related integration costs. The Retail/LTC Segment operating profit for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 includes $12 million of acquisition-related integration costs. The integration costs are related to the acquisitions of Omnicare and the pharmacies and clinics of Target.\n(5) The Corporate Segment operating loss for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 includes $13 million of integration costs. The Corporate Segment operating loss for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 includes $115 million and $135 million, respectively, of acquisition-related transaction and integration costs.\nSupplemental Information\n(Unaudited)\nPharmacy Services Segment\nThe following table summarizes the Pharmacy Services Segment's performance for the respective periods:\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\nIn millions\n2016\n2015\n2016\n2015\nNet revenues\n$\n30,429\n$\n25,528\n$\n88,704\n$\n73,849\nGross profit\n1,797\n1,468\n4,266\n3,735\nGross profit % of net revenues\n5.9%\n5.8%\n4.8%\n5.1%\nOperating expenses\n339\n306\n988\n898\nOperating expense % of net revenues\n1.1%\n1.2%\n1.1%\n1.2%\nOperating profit\n1,458\n1,162\n3,278\n2,837\nOperating profit % of net revenues\n4.8%\n4.6%\n3.7%\n3.8%\nNet revenues:\nMail choice (1)\n$\n10,872\n$\n9,735\n$\n31,668\n$\n27,592\nPharmacy network (2)\n19,469\n15,716\n56,783\n46,043\nOther\n88\n77\n253\n214\nPharmacy claims processed:\nTotal\n305.0\n251.0\n912.5\n752.3\nMail choice (1)\n22.4\n21.9\n66.3\n63.5\nPharmacy network (2)\n282.6\n229.1\n846.2\n688.8\nGeneric dispensing rate:\nTotal\n85.4%\n83.8%\n85.4%\n83.7%\nMail choice (1)\n78.5%\n76.5%\n78.0%\n76.3%\nPharmacy network (2)\n86.0%\n84.5%\n85.9%\n84.4%\nMail choice penetration rate\n18.1%\n21.1%\n18.0%\n20.5%\n(1) Mail choice is defined as claims filled at a Pharmacy Services mail facility, which include specialty mail claims inclusive of Specialty Connect ® claims filled at our retail stores, as well as prescriptions filled at our retail stores under the Maintenance Choice ® program.\n(2) Pharmacy network net revenues, claims processed and generic dispensing rates do not include Maintenance Choice, which are included within the mail choice category.

      "text": "Guy Uses A Drone To Catch His Wife Cheating On Him In A CVS Parking Lot Well then, looks like this marriage is over. Nov 15th, 2016 \nHey, would you look at that, drones are actually useful sometimes. \nEven though chances are pretty high that you’re going to get caught cheating, people still go ahead and do it. That’s why this woman was caught cheating after making a critical mistake on Snapchat . And that’s why this dude had to come up with the most garbage excuse to explain a hickey on his neck. But the guy in this story actually caught his wife cheating in a wife we’ve never heard before: He used his drone to catch her with another dude. \nThe guy in the video noticed that his wife had been getting called in early to work more often the past couple weeks, so he decided to follow her. And when that didn’t work, he gave his drone a shot. Take a look at the video below to see what he captured. Guy Uses A Drone To Catch His Wife Cheating On Him In A CVS Parking Lo t \nNow of course some folks think this is fake, but this YouTube may shed some light on the realness of it. \nWell, if this is real then it just makes this situation that more depressing. The dude caught his lady cheating on him using a drone — at a CVS pharmacy. Although it could have been worse, it could have been an Applebee’s parking lot.",

The woman said she told the clerk, who called 911, then she followed him to the parking lot, taking pictures of him and his two-door blue Chevrolet Blazer with damage to the driver’s side. \nTRENDING STORIES: ",

      "text": "Billionaire John Paulson Trims JNJ, Teva, Adds CVS: 13F Filing (JNJ, CVS) By Richard Saintvilus | November 15, 2016 — 12:33 PM EST \nThere's perhaps no better time to learn how the so-called \"smart money\" feel about certain stocks than when they disclose their positions via 13F filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). \nIf would seem Billionaire John Paulson was hesitant to bet on healthcare stocks ahead of the election. According to the most recent 13-F filing with the SEC, Paulson's hedge fund Paulson & Co. reduced its holdings in large Pharma names such as Johnson & Johnson ( JNJ ), Shire Plc ADS ( SHPG ) and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited ( TEVA ). The hedge fund also exited its entire position in Cigna Corp. ( CI ). \nIt's not hard to see why Paulson was bearish health care. Given the public stance Hilary Clinton had taken amid the rampant price gouging from pharmaceutical companies, Paulson was likely bracing for stricter health care regulations under a democratic regime. By contrast, Donald Trump's pro-business policies are now seen as a catalyst to move health care stock higher . \nIn the regard, the fact Paulson added new stakes in CVS Health Corp ( CVS ) should help. Likewise, his new stakes in Humana Inc. ( HUM ) and HCA Holdings, Inc. ( HCA ) should help drive his portfolio as the President-elect's policies on healthcare begin to take shape. \nDuring the third quarter ending September 30, Paulson & Co. disclosed it had about $9.2 billion in managed 13F securities, making a 6% decline from the prior reporting period value of $9.8 billion. Companies in its top-ten holding had a concentration of almost 68.3% of the fund's total value. The fund's largest holding is Shire with shares held of 4.6 million shares, valued at $904 million. \nIn total, Paulson & Co. took twenty new positions during the quarter, while adding to sixteen existing positions. The fund sold out of twelve stocks, while reducing its stake in 41. It's important to note, that the form 13F is required to be filed within 45 days of the end of a calendar quarter, which means it is backwards looking. \nWhat's more, the 13F doesn't disclose any short positions the funds might have taken. In other words, for investors who want to mirror these type of trades, there are plenty of information that is omitted that could provide a better sense of how they feel about these companies.

      "text": "\nScan your CVS ExtraCare card at the Coupon Center, usually located at the front of the store, each week to get CVS store coupons that can be stacked with manufacturer coupons for CUCKOO deals! Be sure to scan multiple times to make sure you’re getting all the coupons you’re eligible for until the machine says “Hey Super Scanner! You’ve printed all your coupons”. Some coupons are randomly given, some are based on shopping habits and some coupons are given to everyone! CVS resets the personalized coupons on Monday mornings, so that is usually the best time to scan to get the widest variety of coupons. You can also access your coupons from your CVS account online and the CVS app!\nThe coupons can only be used once, whether printed from the Coupon Center or your online account or redeemed from the app–they are the same coupon. Read about how you can load them to your ExtraCare card or print them from your computer ! You can even extend the expiration date on them!\nEach week I will post a list of the coupons you may get as well some deal scenarios for using these great coupons!

( more ) Used my drone to catch my wife meeting a guy at the local CVS. She had been getting called in early to work more often the past couple weeks, and then I got a call from someone telling me something was going on. I tried to follow her a couple times prior but both times she went to work, so I'm not sure if she was getting tipped off or I was just unlucky. So I took the drone up and that worked.
