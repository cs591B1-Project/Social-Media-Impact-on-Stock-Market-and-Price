      "text": "Canada to order 18 Boeing Super Hornet fighter jets 22 Nov 2016 AFP/File / Adrian Dennis Canada says 18 Boeing F/A-18 Super Hornet fighter jets will be deployed from 2018 \nCanada plans to order 18 Boeing F/A-18 Super Hornet fighter jets while seeking offers to update the rest of its aging combat fleet, Defense Minister Harjit Sajjan announced Tuesday. \nSajjan said Canada will remain a partner in the development program of Lockheed Martin's F-35 stealth fighter jet, even as it looks for a replacement for its aging CF-18s. \nCanada had ordered 65 F-35 stealth fighters in 2010, but Prime Minister Justin Trudeau scrapped the deal because of sky-rocketing costs. \nThe 18 Super Hornet fighter jets will be deployed from 2018 as the government awaits offers on a longer-term fleet replacement, Sajjan said. \nCanada's current fleet of fighter jets is more than three decades old and is down from 138 aircraft to 77. \nThe Super Hornets will help fill a \"capability gap\" and allow Canada to meet its NATO and NORAD security obligations, said Sajjan. \n\"The number of mission-ready planes we can put in the air today is less than the NORAD and NATO obligations taken together,\" he said. \nAs well, he said, measures will be taken to extend the working life of the existing CF-18 fleet through to the late 2020s, when the new fleet should be \"fully operational.\" \nCanada's CF-18 fighter jets were built by McDonnell Douglas, which merged with Boeing in 1997. They were originally scheduled to be retired in 2020. \nCanada joined the United States and its allies in 1997 to develop the F-35 Lightning II stealth fighter. \nBut after coming under fire over its spiralling costs and an apparent lack of transparency in the procurement process, the previous Tory government widened the search for a new fighter jet in 2012. \nThe new five-year procurement process will begin early next year. \nThat will mark the second reboot in four years of the largest military procurement project in Canadian history. 22 Nov 2016",

Boeing announced Monday that Conner will step down and be replaced by General Electric senior executive Kevin McAllister. Jason Redmond Associated Press file, 2015 i Order Reprint of this Story \nBoeing announced Monday that Ray Conner, Boeing Commercial Airplanes chief executive, will step down from that position and be replaced by Kevin McAllister, General Electric senior executive. \nBoeing said Conner will continue in his role as Boeing vice chairman through 2017, reporting to company chairman Dennis Muilenburg. \nConner, 61, “will work in the months ahead on a purposeful hand-off … to ensure continuity of operations and customer support,” Boeing said. \nHe will “remain involved in ongoing product development strategy at Commercial Airplanes and will continue to be based at Longacres,” Boeing said. \nMuilenburg appointed Stan Deal, head of the Commercial Airplanes customer services business unit, as president and CEO of a new business unit named Boeing Global Services, which will combine the customer services groups within Boeing’s two main divisions: commercial airplanes and defense, space and security. \nMcAllister joins Boeing from GE Aviation, where he was president and chief executive officer of GE Aviation Services — an $8-billion business that supported operators of the more than 34,000 GE commercial jet engines. \nHe is a graduate of the University of Pittsburgh, with a bachelor’s degree in materials engineering. \n“With Ray Conner’s retirement timeline in sight and an expanding global services market to pursue, these moves will further strengthen and grow Boeing and better serve our customers, employees, shareholders and other partners in the years ahead,” said Muilenburg. “We are immensely grateful to Ray for his leadership and contributions to Boeing over nearly four decades, and we will continue to rely on his vast experience and keen insights in supporting the leadership and business transitions underway.” Related content",

      "text": "Canada Taps Boeing''s Super Hornets in Fleet Overhaul -- 2nd   06:15:  Canada Taps Boeing's Super Hornets in Fleet Overhaul -- 2nd Update By Paul Vieira and Doug Cameron \nOTTAWA -- Canada plans to launch talks with Boeing Co. to buy 18 F/A-18 Super Hornet aircraft as an interim measure in a planned overhaul of the country's legacy CF-18 fighter jet fleet, the minister in charge of defense said Tuesday. \nThe Liberal government also will launch a competitive process to replace the aging CF-18 program, Minister Harjit Sajjan said at a news conference. \nHe added that the Liberal government, which came to power just over a year ago, inherited a fighter-jet fleet that was unable to meet its commitments to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, or NATO, and North American defense. An interim fleet provides the most effective way to help Canada to meet its obligations, he said. \nCanada's former Conservative government dropped plans almost four years ago to buy 65 Lockheed Martin Corp. F-35 fighter jets after political controversy about a lack of transparency over acquisition costs. However, the F-35 will be allowed to compete in the contest for more planes, expected to be launched early next year. \nCanada's plan to start talks about an interim purchase of 18 F/A-18 Super Hornet jets is the second boost to extending the life of Boeing's combat-jet production lines after the U.S. State Department last week approved of sales to Kuwait and Qatar worth up to $31.2 billion combined. Canadian officials declined to provide an estimated cost for acquiring the Boeing aircraft. \nHoward Rubel, aerospace analyst at Jefferies & Co., said the sale to Canada could be worth $1.5 billion. \n\"Boeing is honored to provide the Royal Canadian Air Force with the only multi-role fighter aircraft that can fulfill its immediate needs for sovereign and North American defense,\" the plane maker said in a statement. \nBoeing faced having to shut down the St. Louis, Mo., production lines for both jets by the end of the decade unless it secured export deals. It also is trying to sell more F/A-18s to the U.S. Navy. \nKuwait wants 32 Boeing F/A-18 jets at a cost of $10.1 billion, including weapons and support systems, the Pentagon said. Kuwait signed a deal earlier this year with Leonardo SpA to buy 28 Eurofighter Typhoon jets. \nQatar wants to buy as many as 72 Boeing F-15 fighters that together with weapons and support could be worth $21.1 billion, the Pentagon said. However, Qatar still could split any purchase between Boeing and the Eurofighter Typhoon jet. \nChicago-based Boeing also is trying to sell the F/A-18 to India in a proposed deal that could require it to build the planes there. \nThe planned Boeing purchase is a blow to Lockheed Martin, which had originally planned to sell its F-35 jets to Canada. Lockheed said Tuesday that the plane was combat-ready and available today. \n\"Although disappointed with this decision, we remain confident the F-35 is the best solution to meet Canada's operational requirements at the most affordable price,\" a Lockheed Martin spokesman said in a statement. \nLiberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said during his election campaign that the Lockheed Martin F-35 was unnecessary for Canada's needs and too expensive. \nCanada's plan to hold a transparent bidding process for fighter jets is likely to include the F-35 as well as the Eurofighter Typhoon, the Dassault Aviation SA Rafale, and the Saab AB Gripen. The bidding process could take five years, Canadian officials said Tuesday. \nMr. Sajjan said a range of measures will be implemented to extend the service of the current CF-18 fleet, including recruitment and training to address understaffing issues and an enhanced maintenance program. \nWrite to Paul Vieira at paul.vieira@wsj.com and Doug Cameron at doug.cameron@wsj.com  161815ET  ",

      "text": "Boeing is turning to an outsider for the first time to head the commercial airplanes division, replacing Ray Conner with Kevin McAllister, a 27-year veteran of General Electric 's aviation business.\nMcAllister, 53, the former chief executive officer of GE Aviation Services, assumed the leadership of Boeing's largest business on Monday, according to a statement by the planemaker. Conner, 61, will stay on as vice chairman through 2017.\nThe company also promoted Stan Deal to the role of president and CEO of Boeing Global Services, creating a third division that combines customer-service groups within the commercial airplane and defense units. Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg sees the potential to build a $50 billion business by bolstering service offerings, from providing spare parts to conducting round-the-clock maintenance.\n\"We've always said that growing services was a key part of our strategy,\" Muilenburg told reporters during a conference call Monday. The latest leadership changes underscore that \"actions follow words,\" he said.\nA trip back in time, from the newest Boeing 747-8 Intercontinental to the original 747.\nMuilenburg, who took over last year, has made a series of management shifts that place the company's largest businesses under executives with backgrounds in services.\nThe latest move reshapes the manufacturer's largest business with new leadership amid a turbulent market for commercial aircraft. The Chicago-based company announced Oct. 14 that Ihssane Mounir would replace the retiring John Wojick, a key Conner deputy, early next year as chief airplane salesman.\nWith McAllister, Boeing gains an executive with deep ties to airlines worldwide, including some who are exclusively Airbus Group SE customers, and a reputation for using data to analyze airlines' wants and needs. He'd been viewed as a potential successor to David Joyce, who heads GE Aviation and is a vice chairman, said Rick Kennedy, a spokesman for GE.\nMcAllister has been GE's \"face\" to all of its airline customers for 15 years, first leading the sales team and more recently as the head of the unit selling long-term service contracts and spare parts. The business is a major source of profit for GE, accumulating a backlog of services worth more than $120 billion, Kennedy said.\nJoe Sutter, father of Boeing's 747 jumbo jet, dies at 95 Julie Johnsson Joe Sutter, the Boeing engineer who ushered in the modern era of long-range travel by spearheading the 747 jumbo jet in the 1960s, has died. He was 95.\n\"Joe lived an amazing life and was an inspiration - not just to those of us at Boeing, but to the entire aerospace industry,\" Ray Conner, chief...\nJoe Sutter, the Boeing engineer who ushered in the modern era of long-range travel by spearheading the 747 jumbo jet in the 1960s, has died. He was 95.\n\"Joe lived an amazing life and was an inspiration - not just to those of us at Boeing, but to the entire aerospace industry,\" Ray Conner, chief...\n(Julie Johnsson) McAllister is a \"very solid guy with a great background in aviation,\" said Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst at Teal Group in Fairfax, Virginia. \"He's a big customer and part of their biggest industrial partner company, too. That's a unique combination.\"\nA materials engineer by training and University of Pittsburgh graduate, McAllister will be the first outsider to lead Boeing Commercial Airplanes since the unit was formed in 1965. The company selected McAllister after considering a mix of external and internal candidates to succeed Conner.\nMcAllister has worked closely with Boeing over the years, Muilenburg said. \"I'm not sure I'd call him an outsider,\" the CEO said. \"He's been very, very close to us for a couple of decades.\"\nWhile McAllister masters the nuances of Boeing's culture and works to earn the respect of its factory workers and engineers, he also will face crucial product-strategy decisions. Perhaps the most critical is the call expected next year on Boeing's first all-new airplane since the 787 Dreamliner: a new plane family aimed at the market gap between Boeing's largest single-aisle and smallest twin-aisle jetliners.\nThrough his role at GE, McAllister \"saw both the challenges and failures of the 787,\" Howard Rubel, an aerospace analyst at Jefferies, said by phone. \"So, he knows how hard it is to run an airplane company. He saw how hard it was to launch a new engine.\"\nBoeing's 747 jumbo snags a $5.3 billion lifeline from UPS Julie Johnsson and Michael Sasso Boeing's 747 jumbo jet may have won a reprieve from an uncertain future as United Parcel Service agreed to buy at least 14 freighters -- the biggest order in almost nine years.\nThe deal for 747-8 aircraft, valued at $5.3 billion based on list prices and fueled by UPS's international expansion,...\nBoeing's 747 jumbo jet may have won a reprieve from an uncertain future as United Parcel Service agreed to buy at least 14 freighters -- the biggest order in almost nine years.\nThe deal for 747-8 aircraft, valued at $5.3 billion based on list prices and fueled by UPS's international expansion,...\n(Julie Johnsson and Michael Sasso) McAllister also will be under pressure to bolster margins as the planemaker slows production of the 777, its second-largest source of profit. He may also have to navigate potential fall-out from the economic penalties President-elect Donald Trump has threatened to impose on China, Boeing's largest overseas market.\nConner has served as corporate vice chairman since 2013, and president and CEO of commercial airplanes since 2012. A 39-year Boeing veteran, he led the division during an era of historic jetliner sales, then warned workers that tougher times and cost reductions lay ahead. During his watch, record output at Boeing's factories boosted the segment's revenue to $66 billion, up 34 percent from 2012.\nHe is a throwback, known for close ties forged with customers as the planemaker's former sales chief. A native of Burien, Washington, a working-class suburb south of Seattle, Conner joined his father and brother at Boeing in 1977, landing a job as a mechanic building 727 jetliners.\nConner will help smooth the transition to a new generation of leaders, Muilenburg said, while helping Deal knit together the government and commercial services businesses. Conner will also stay \"engaged in our product development activities, including the production transformation under way,\" Muilenburg said.\nDeal, 52, who was rumored to be an heir to Conner, had served as senior vice-president of Boeing's Commercial Aviation Services business since 2014. His new business will have about 20,000 employees and will maintain a headquarters staff of a \"couple dozen\" in Dallas.\nThe lines between Deal's new unit and Boeing airplane and defense divisions will be blurry in places, with some customer-facing groups staying in place inside the current business units.\nDeal's current operation has more than 12,000 employees and provides airlines and leasing companies with wide ranging support services, from maintenance training to digital crew scheduling. Another 13,000 employees support military and government customers worldwide.",

      "title": "Is Canada Getting Ready to Buy Boeing's F/A-18E/F Super Hornet?",
      "text": "Tweet Share Share \nCanada is considering the purchase of 18 Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet strike fighters as a stopgap measure while it begins the search for a new aircraft to replace its increasingly decrepit CF-18 fleet. \nAmerica’s northern neighbor and closest ally currently operates 77 Boeing CF-18s—down from 138 jets at its peak—which were originally slated to be replaced by the stealthy Lockheed Martin F-35 Joint Strike Fighter (JSF). However, Ottawa’s F-35 purchase—which was finalized under the previous Conservative government of Stephen Harper—because mired in controversy over cost and technical issues. The new Liberal government—led by Justin Trudeau—is hoping to avoid a similar debacle by kicking the can down the road with an interim partial CF-18 replacement while it holds a competition for a new jet. \n“Today, the Government of Canada has announced that it will launch, within its current mandate, an open and transparent competition to replace the legacy fleet of CF-18 fighter aircraft. This competition will ensure that the Government gets the right aircraft for our women and men in uniform – at the right price – while maximizing economic benefits to Canadians,” reads a Canadian government statement. “In addition, Canada will immediately explore the acquisition of 18 new Super Hornet aircraft to supplement the CF-18s until the permanent replacement arrives.” \nCanadian Defense Minister Harjit Sajjan said that Canada urgently needs new aircraft—hence the need for an interim fighter purchase. “Every government has to decide the level of risk they are willing to accept to Canada, and our women and men in uniform. Having to manage our commitments to NORAD, NATO, and our ability to respond to unforeseen events is not a risk this government is willing to accept,” Sajjan said. “The interim fleet provides the most effective way forward to help ensure Canada remains a credible and dependable ally.” \nThe Canadian government seems to be hoping for some sort of leasing agreement for its prospective interim Boeing F/A-18E/F fleet. “The Government will enter into discussions with the U.S. Government and Boeing regarding use of these jets for an interim period of time,” the Canadian government statement reads. “Before proceeding, the Government reserves the right to decide if they can provide the interim fleet at a cost, time, level of capability, and economic value that is acceptable to Canada.\" \nMeanwhile, Ottawa is continuing its search for a new jet. Over the past year, Canada has worked with the defense industry and allied governments—such as the United States—to obtain the most up-to-date information on timelines, current capabilities, costs and economic benefits associated with buying a new jet. Additionally, Canada will continue its participation in the F-35 program until it awards a contract award for a permanent new fleet of jets. “This will allow Canada to maximize benefits of the partnership and gives Canada the option to buy the aircraft through the program, should the F-35 be successful in the competitive process for the permanent fleet,” reads the Canadian government statement. \nWhile the Canadian announcement is a minor setback for Lockheed Martin, it will be a boon for Boeing and the U.S. Navy as they struggle to extend the Super Hornet production run. Meanwhile, the loss is not an insurmountable problem for Lockheed Martin or the JSF program. Indeed, there is every possibility—once the F-35 is genuinely operational and in fully rate production—that it could eventually win the contract to become the permanent replacement for the CF-18. \nUltimately, Canada will pick the best aircraft for its needs. “History and a future fraught with risk demands that the Canadian Armed Forces be ready and capable to respond to threats to Canada and North America, and support our allies and those in need,” said Gen. Jonathan Vance, Chief of the Defense Staff. “Our women and men in uniform are the guarantors of Canadian sovereignty, and protectors of Canadian values and interests abroad. I am delighted that our women and men in the RCAF are embarking on a journey that assures our defense for the long-term.” \nDave Majumdar is the defense editor for the National Interest .

      "text": "0 0 \nNEW YORK: Boeing Co on Monday named a senior General Electric Co executive to head its commercial airplanes division and announced a new services unit, in moves to capture more of the profitable market for parts and repairs after a jet is sold. \nThe changes are \"a big and important step\" toward Boeing´s goal of increasing annual services revenue to about $50 billion in 10 years from about $15 billion currently, Boeing Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg said on a call with journalists. \nThe changes do not alter plans for developing aircraft, but put a new \"emphasis on generating life-cycle value,\" Muilenburg said, referring to building an aircraft with an eye to gaining revenue from servicing the plane during its decades-long life. \n\"We´ve always said growing services is a core part of our strategy, and now you see us emphasizing and investing accordingly,\" Muilenburg said. \nBoeing tapped Kevin McAllister, 53, to lead its $66 billion commercial airplane business, succeeding Ray Conner, 61, effective immediately. \nConner, who started as a Boeing mechanic nearly 40 years ago, will serve as vice chairman through 2017 to help with the transition, the world´s biggest planemaker said. \nMcAllister has been with GE´s aviation unit for nearly 30 years and knows Boeing and its customers well, Muilenburg said. \nBoeing named Stanley Deal, 52, to head the new services unit, to be known as Global Services. \nDeal had been senior vice president of Boeing´s Commercial Aviation Services business. \nThe Global Services business is due to begin operating in the third quarter of 2017.McAllister has been chief executive of GE´s $8 billion aviation services business, a unit that earns much of its revenue from contracts servicing GE aircraft engines. \nAirlines generally pay a fee for every hour they run the engines, which covers service and maintenance. \n\"Muilenburg is shaking up BCA with a surprise outside appointment which is likely a healthy move given that fresh leadership eyes can create positive movement,\" said analyst Peter Arment from Baird Equity Research. \nLast year, Muilenburg named Leanne Caret head of the defense business. \n0 0 Boeing taps GE executive to head airplanes unit as part of services push   Print/166876-Boeing-taps-GE-executive-to-head-airplanes-unit-as-part-of-services-push/   \"Boeing taps GE executive to head airplanes unit as part of services push\" is https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/166876-Boeing-taps-GE-executive-to-head-airplanes-unit-as-part-of-services-push+TheNewsInternational- ",

      "text": "Chief of Boeing commercial airplanes retires, replaced with GE exec Glenn Farley, KING 3:13 PM. PST November 22, 2016 Boeing Commercial Airplanes chief executive Ray Conner. (KING) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST \nBoeing announced on Monday that Boeing Commercial Airplanes chief executive Ray Conner will retire by the end of 2017, replaced by General Electric senior executive Kevin McAllister. \nThe news comes as a break from what we've seen from Boeing's commercial airplane business - namely, bringing in an outsider as chief of Boeing's single biggest business: making jetliners. \nRay Conner is the ultimate insider and grew up inside the company. He got his start on the 727 assembly line in Renton and rose through the ranks. He's also been at the controls through some very tumultuous times, including 2013 and 2014, when the Machinists Union had to vote on whether to accept contract changes or risk the new Boeing 777X being built in another state. \nConner will remain as vice chairman of the company, overseeing the transition to Kevin McAllister. \nMcAllister does not come from inside Boeing, but rather from General Electric's sizeable aviation business, which among other things, builds jet engines. One one hand, he should know Boeing very well as planes from the 737 to the 747 use engines built whole or in part by G.E. KING asked Boeing Chairman Dennis Muilenburg if this outside appointment could bring anxiety to Puget Sound: \n\"You can see us making investments in the community here, to show you we're here for the long run...There is an advantage as we bring in external talent, new ideas, different perspectives, things that are complimentary to our team here. With Kevin (McAllister), we have the best of both worlds. We're bringing in somebody with fresh ideas and perspectives and somebody who also knows Boeing well and has a great deal of respect for our team here in Puget Sound.\" \nMuillenburg himself spent the first 15 years of his career in Puget Sound, having started off as an engineering intern. \nCopyright 2016 KING ",

      "text": "By Paul Vieira and Doug Cameron\nOTTAWA -- Canada plans to launch talks with Boeing Co. to buy 18 F/A-18 Super Hornet aircraft as an interim measure in a planned overhaul of the country's legacy CF-18 fighter jet fleet, the minister in charge of defense said Tuesday.\nThe Liberal government also will launch a competitive process to replace the aging CF-18 program, Minister Harjit Sajjan said at a news conference.\n\"We need to move on this as quickly as possible,\" said Mr. Sajjan, a retired lieutenant-colonel in the Canadian forces. \"A modern fighter fleet is an essential tool for defending Canada and exercising Canadian sovereignty -- especially in the northern skies.\"\nHe added that the Liberal government, which came to power just over a year ago, inherited a fighter-jet fleet that was unable to meet its commitments to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, or NATO, and North American defense. An interim fleet provides the most effective way to help Canada to meet its obligations, he said.\nCanada's former Conservative government dropped plans almost four years ago to buy 65 Lockheed Martin Corp. F-35 fighter jets after political controversy about a lack of transparency over acquisition costs. However, the F-35 will be allowed to compete in the contest for more planes, expected to be launched early next year.\nCanada's plan to start talks about an interim purchase of 18 F/A-18 Super Hornet jets is the second boost to extending the life of Boeing's combat-jet production lines after the U.S. State Department last week approved of sales to Kuwait and Qatar worth up to $31.2 billion combined. Canadian officials declined to provide an estimated cost for acquiring the Boeing aircraft.\nHoward Rubel, aerospace analyst at Jefferies & Co., said the sale to Canada could be worth $1.5 billion.\n\"Boeing is honored to provide the Royal Canadian Air Force with the only multi-role fighter aircraft that can fulfill its immediate needs for sovereign and North American defense,\" the plane maker said in a statement.\nBoeing faced having to shut down the St. Louis, Mo., production lines for both jets by the end of the decade unless it secured export deals. It also is trying to sell more F/A-18s to the U.S. Navy.\nKuwait wants 32 Boeing F/A-18 jets at a cost of $10.1 billion, including weapons and support systems, the Pentagon said. Kuwait signed a deal earlier this year with Leonardo SpA to buy 28 Eurofighter Typhoon jets.\nQatar wants to buy as many as 72 Boeing F-15 fighters that together with weapons and support could be worth $21.1 billion, the Pentagon said. However, Qatar still could split any purchase between Boeing and the Eurofighter Typhoon jet.\nChicago-based Boeing also is trying to sell the F/A-18 to India in a proposed deal that could require it to build the planes there.\nThe planned Boeing purchase is a blow to Lockheed Martin, which had originally planned to sell its F-35 jets to Canada. Lockheed said Tuesday that the plane was combat-ready and available today.\n\"Although disappointed with this decision, we remain confident the F-35 is the best solution to meet Canada's operational requirements at the most affordable price,\" a Lockheed Martin spokesman said in a statement.\nLiberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said during his election campaign that the Lockheed Martin F-35 was unnecessary for Canada's needs and too expensive.\nCanada's plan to hold a transparent bidding process for fighter jets is likely to include the F-35 as well as the Eurofighter Typhoon, the Dassault Aviation SA Rafale, and the Saab AB Gripen. The bidding process could take five years, Canadian officials said Tuesday.\nMr. Sajjan said a range of measures will be implemented to extend the service of the current CF-18 fleet, including recruitment and training to address understaffing issues and an enhanced maintenance program.\nWrite to Paul Vieira at paul.vieira@wsj.com and Doug Cameron at doug.cameron@wsj.com\n 18:15 ET (23:15 ",

      "text": "By Paul Vieira and Doug Cameron\nOTTAWA -- Canada plans to launch talks with Boeing Co. to buy 18 F/A-18 Super Hornet aircraft as an interim measure in a planned overhaul of the country's legacy CF-18 fighter jet fleet, the minister in charge of defense said Tuesday.\nThe Liberal government also will launch a competitive process to replace the aging CF-18 program, Minister Harjit Sajjan said at a news conference.\n\"We need to move on this as quickly as possible,\" said Mr. Sajjan, a retired lieutenant-colonel in the Canadian forces. \"A modern fighter fleet is an essential tool for defending Canada and exercising Canadian sovereignty -- especially in the northern skies.\"\nHe added that the Liberal government, which came to power just over a year ago, inherited a fighter-jet fleet that was unable to meet its commitments to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, or NATO, and North American defense. An interim fleet provides the most effective way to help Canada to meet its obligations, he said.\nCanada's former Conservative government dropped plans almost four years ago to buy 65 Lockheed Martin Corp. F-35 fighter jets after political controversy about a lack of transparency over acquisition costs. However, the F-35 will be allowed to compete in the contest for more planes, expected to be launched early next year.\nCanada's plan to start talks about an interim purchase of 18 F/A-18 Super Hornet jets is the second boost to extending the life of Boeing's combat-jet production lines after the U.S. State Department last week approved of sales to Kuwait and Qatar worth up to $31.2 billion combined. Canadian officials declined to provide an estimated cost for acquiring the Boeing aircraft.\n\"Boeing is honored to provide the Royal Canadian Air Force with the only multi-role fighter aircraft that can fulfill its immediate needs for sovereign and North American defense,\" the plane maker said in a statement.\nBoeing faced having to shut down the St. Louis, Mo., production lines for both jets by the end of the decade unless it secured export deals. It also is trying to sell more F/A-18s to the U.S. Navy.\nKuwait wants 32 Boeing F/A-18 jets at a cost of $10.1 billion, including weapons and support systems, the Pentagon said. Kuwait signed a deal earlier this year with Leonardo SpA to buy 28 Eurofighter Typhoon jets.\nQatar wants to buy as many as 72 Boeing F-15 fighters that together with weapons and support could be worth $21.1 billion, the Pentagon said. However, Qatar still could split any purchase between Boeing and the Eurofighter Typhoon jet.\nChicago-based Boeing also is trying to sell the F/A-18 to India in a proposed deal that could require it to build the planes there.\nThe planned Boeing purchase is a blow to Lockheed Martin, which had originally planned to sell its F-35 jets to Canada. Lockheed said Tuesday that the plane was combat-ready and available today.\n\"Although disappointed with this decision, we remain confident the F-35 is the best solution to meet Canada's operational requirements at the most affordable price,\" a Lockheed Martin spokesman said in a statement.\nLiberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said during his election campaign that the Lockheed Martin F-35 was unnecessary for Canada's needs and too expensive.\nCanada's plan to hold a transparent bidding process for fighter jets is likely to include the F-35 as well as the Eurofighter Typhoon, the Dassault Aviation SA Rafale, and the Saab AB Gripen. The bidding process could take five years, Canadian officials said Tuesday.\nMr. Sajjan said a range of measures will be implemented to extend the service of the current CF-18 fleet, including recruitment and training to address understaffing issues and an enhanced maintenance program.\nWrite to Paul Vieira at paul.vieira@wsj.com and Doug Cameron at doug.cameron@wsj.com\n 22, 2016 15:08 ET (20:08 ",

      "text": "This article first appeared in The Edge Financial Daily , on November 23, 2016. \n\nNEW YORK: Boeing Co on Monday named a senior General Electric Co executive to head its commercial airplanes division and announced a new services unit, to capture more of the profitable market for parts and repairs after a jet is sold. \nThe changes are “a big and important step” toward Boeing’s goal of increasing annual services revenue to about US$50 billion (RM220.25 billion) in 10 years from about US$15 billion currently, Boeing chief executive officer Dennis Muilenburg said on a call with journalists. \nThe changes do not alter plans for developing aircraft, but put a new “emphasis on generating life-cycle value”, Muilenburg said, referring to building an aircraft aimed at gaining revenue from servicing it during its decades-long lifespan. \nBoeing tapped Kevin McAllister, 53, to lead its US$66 billion commercial airplane business, succeeding Ray Conner, 61, effective immediately. — Reuters",

      "text": "Reuters   \nDUBAI: Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) is evaluating an order for wide-body Airbus and Boeing jets as it looks to upgrade its ageing fleet, an airline executive said.“Boeing 777X would be a good option,” the airline’s executive director of human resources and works, Raheel Ahmed, said on the sidelines of a conference in Dubai, adding that PIA is also looking at the Airbus A330 and A350 models.PIA would consider purchasing the aircraft directly from the manufacturer and financing the order through a sale and leaseback arrangement, when an airline sells a jet to a lessor who then leases it back. It would also consider a direct leasing agreement, known as a dry lease.Ahmed did not say when PIA would order the jets or how many it could buy. It has a fleet of 38 narrow-body and wide-body Airbus and Boeing jets, with three A310s to be retired on Dec. 31, he added.Ahmed also said PIA would cut its 18,000 workforce by between 3,000 and 3,500 employees by the end of 2017 as the Pakistan government looks to turn around the loss-making airline and sell-off a 49 percent stake.However, PIA later said Ahmed’s figures were incorrect, and no decision had as yet been taken on how many jobs would be cut or over what timeframe.A meeting between Pakistan’s Privatization Commission and PIA top management was also held on Tuesday, “to determine the best suitable restructuring model to make PIA into a viable entity,” said a senior government official who attended the meeting.The official said restructuring would be done in two phases, carving out non-essential units within three to six months “to attain a clean balance sheet,” followed by the gradual carving out of other business units.The airline would spin-off four “special business units” from January 2017, starting with its catering business and later its flight training, engineering and courier businesses.The units are planned to operate independently of PIA with their own general managers and marketing teams. PIA would later look to sell a stake in the units if they are profitable. Facebook",

      "text": "Andrew Harrer | Bloomberg | Getty Images Canada on Thursday unveiled plans to buy 18 Boeing Corp Super Hornets as a stop-gap measure while it prepared an open five-year competition to replace its aging fleet of fighter jets.\n\nProcurement Minister Judy Foote told a news conference the government would launch immediate talks with Boeing for the Super Hornets, in a victory for the U.S. plane maker if the order goes ahead.\nOne defense contractor said the choice could be interpreted as giving Boeing a long-term advantage but Foote, speaking in a phone interview, later said Ottawa would run \"a real, open, transparent competition\" where any firm could compete.\nThe decision on how to replace Canada's CF-18 jets - some of which have been flying for 35 years - is politically sensitive and has been repeatedly put off.\nDefence Minister Harjit Sajjan said the CF-18s could no longer meet Canada's international military commitments.\n\"Because they were not replaced, we now have a capability gap ... we need additional planes as soon as possible for an interim period,\" he told the news conference.\nThe former Conservative administration said in 2010 it would buy 65 Lockheed Martin Corp F-35 jets for C$9 billion ($6.7 billion). During last year's successful election campaign, the Liberals vowed not to buy the planes on the grounds they were too costly.\nSajjan said Canada would remain a member of the nine-nation consortium that helped fund development of the F-35. \nLockheed Martin said that while it was disappointed with the choice of an interim fighter it was \"confident the F-35 is the best solution\", according to a statement. \nOttawa insists the winner of the open competition must provide industrial benefits to Canadian firms. It also wants the companies to have a chance of getting work from the interim order with Boeing, Foote said. \nBoeing will try hard to give Canadian companies contracts that would equal the total amount Ottawa pays for the 18 Super Hornets, said Scott Day, spokesman at Boeing Defense. \nFoote said talks would start immediately with Boeing though a final decision would only be made once the discussions were over. Sajjan, though, said he was confident the Boeing plane met Canada's requirements. \nThe government declined to answer any questions on cost, in particular whether the money set aside for the interim order would come out of the initial budget for the planes. \nBoeing's stock rose after the announcement and closed up 1.7 percent at $149.52, while Lockheed Martin shares pared gains to end the day at $264.66, up 0.5 percent.",

      "text": "Boeing May Not See Much Turbulence In A Potential Trump Trade War Nov.23.16 Send Message Summary \nDespite Boeing's heavy reliance on global markets, China in particular, for its commercial airplanes, the company could well dodge the bullet in a potential Trump trade war. \nIt's not in the interest of China to block Boeing sales, and any increased tariffs on plane-making materials imported from China could be absorbed by Boeing. \nThe Boeing business can make do without the Ex-Im Bank, which could lose its charter under President Trump. \nBoeing Co. (NYSE: BA ), dependent largely on global markets for its commercial airplanes, has had some people worried about its becoming collateral damage in a potential Trump trade war. Only about 11% of Boeing's contractual backlog for commercial airplanes is with U.S. airlines, including cargo carriers. This makes Boeing, America's number one exporter, a visible target for potential retaliation by other countries if President Trump hikes tariffs on their imports to the U.S. \nThe concern is particularly in relation to China, which took 164 deliveries from Boeing in 2016, compared to the company's total plane deliveries of 762 the year earlier. According to a Chinese government newspaper, Global Times, \"China will take a tit-for-tat approach,\" and \"a batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus.\" \nConsisting of possibly over 20% of Boeing's annual deliveries, orders from China represent a vital part of the company's commercial airplanes business. Any remote prospect of losing that exporting market would be a major cause of concern for Boeing. \nHowever, trade barriers often are selectively targeted on foreign imports that are in direct competition with domestically produced goods. The U.S. could impose tariffs on, say, steel imported from China to help American steel companies better compete. Meanwhile, it would probably not set barriers on many of the imported consumer products that American companies are no longer making. \nOn the other hand, China might in response, for example, make it more costly for American farmers to export certain agricultural products that China could produce itself. It's highly unlikely that China would make it more expensive for Chinese airlines to buy airplanes from Boeing, letting alone stop ordering from Boeing altogether. One reason is that China doe not yet have a competitive commercial aircraft manufacturing industry to serve as a counterplay. \nAs to China's remark on replacing Boeing orders with those from Airbus, it would be difficult to actually carry out the action, at least not in the near term. Boeing covers about half of the aviation market in China, which is too big a market share for another one company to fill on a moment's notice. \nMoreover, China has built up an industry that supplies Boeing with certain plane-making parts and materials, from composite rudder to interior decorative components and even seats installed in China following a plane's delivery. Any blockage of Boeing sales to China by the Chinese government would hurt its own aviation companies that have supply agreements with Boeing. \nBoeing's outsourcing to China includes a joint venture for a parts-manufacturing factory that ships locally made parts for commercial aircraft back to a Boeing's facility in the U.S. for final assembly. This fits right into Trump's unfair-trade narrative and could lead to tariffs levied on Chinese-made materials coming to the U.S., increasing Boeing's production costs. \nHowever, the amount of Boeing's imported parts from Chinese suppliers may seem a lot but is relatively small. At about one billion dollars a year, it's only around one percent of Boeing's most recent annual sales . Thus, the resulting tariff impact could be somewhat limited. If Boeing is compelled to source parts from domestic suppliers, it may also see increased production costs, similar to the rising-tariff situation. By leveraging its larger scale of productions, the company could probably absorb the cost increase the same way. \nAside from potential trade tariffs imposed by both the U.S. and other countries, China in particular, the talk of doing away with the Export and Import Bank also concerns some as to what impact there could be on sales of Boeing airplanes to foreign buyers that use the Ex-Im Bank for financial guarantees when financing their purchases. \nIf the Ex-Im Bank loses its charter under President Trump, some Boeing customers would have to try to find other means of financing in the market, and Boeing would have no reason not to accept such customer financing arrangements, even without a government guarantee. \nFurthermore, Boeing Capital, with a total customer financing and investment portfolio of $3.459 billion as of Dec. 31, 2015, could step in to effectively reallocate some of the financial resources toward its manufacturing operations by extending credit to additional Boeing customers. The Ex-Im Bank can be useful but is not necessary for Boeing to secure international sales.

      "text": "800 out of 2050 aircraft are likely to re-enter the market. \nIn case of permanent low oil price this could increase to roughly 1,000. \nFor freighter airlines there is not a lot left in aircraft storages. In Part 1 of this series, I had a look at the costs related to having an aircraft re-enter service from long term storage. The main conclusions were that despite low acquisition costs the costs related to having an aircraft re-enter service are high and for passenger airlines it is less attractive to consider operating such aircraft. Additionally, reviving an older aircraft does not make sense under all circumstances. One of the circumstances where it is possible to have an aircraft re-enter service in a cost efficient way is when jet fuel prices are low. Click to enlarge One thing that is important to add to my previous article is something about the costs of passenger-to-freighter conversions. While I might have portrayed that conversion programs are rather cheap, this is not the case. Contract values of conversions have been dropping for the Boeing 747, but we have no recent data to back this up. The trend, however, suggests that current conversions costs are 60% of the costs of adding a new cabin. So also for freighter airlines conversion does not come cheap. The main reason why older aircraft are a solution for freighter airlines is the lower utilization rates. For freighter airlines with higher utilization rates dedicated freighters will be more cost efficient. In this article I do not want to focus on the cost aspect of having an aircraft re-enter service, but I want to focus on how many aircraft are actually in storage and suitable for re-entry. Storage and re-entry In a paper from Dick Forsberg, we can find some clues on how big the pool of aircraft in storage actually is. In total, there are 2,051 aircraft stored; Just 5% of demand for aircraft in the coming 20 years. So one thing that is very clear is that demand cannot be met by aircraft in storage, even if they would be more cost efficient than brand-new aircraft there would be need for new aircraft from Boeing (NYSE: BA ) and Airbus ( OTCPK:EADSF ). Almost 65% of the stored aircraft are narrow body aircraft. In total 800 aircraft are likely to re-enter service with a passenger airline. Over half of these aircraft are narrow body passenger jets, with a re-entry rate of over 35%. Also for wide body jets the re-entry rate is 35%. Click to enlarge Figure 1: Stored aircraft and re-entry by aircraft type (Source: AeroAnalysis) What can be observed here is that the pool of aircraft suitable for re-entry is just 40% of the total aircraft in storage. So out of the 2000 aircraft only 800 are likely to re-enter service. If we are going to make a split out between the most popular models (Airbus A320ceo, Boeing 737NG, Boeing 767, Airbus A340, Airbus A330 and Boeing 747-400), we see that the pool size reduces even further. What can be seen from Figure 1 is that out of the total of over 2000 aircraft in storage only 20% are aircraft that are currently popular and only 12% of the number of stored aircraft is likely to return to passenger service. So for passenger airlines there is not a lot of choice when it comes to popular aircraft, 1 out of every 10 aircraft in the desert might be suitable for re-entry. A question that one might be asking after seeing the number of aircraft that will re-enter with a passenger airline is: \nWhat is left for freighter airlines? The answer is quite simple: \nNot a lot. Currently there are conversion programs in place for the Boeing 767 and Boeing 747-400. The total number of stored aircraft for these 2 types is 124. Out of these 124 some will enter service with passenger airlines, leaving a pool of 80 aircraft. If we add the stored dedicated freighters (45 in total), we get to 125 aircraft. Out of these 125 aircraft, 29 aircraft are converted aircraft and 16 are dedicated freighters. Some of the aircraft that could serve with a freighter airline are in direct ownership by Boeing and the jet maker is likely more willing to have those aircraft sit in the desert and sell newer aircraft to freighter airlines. So we are left with 110 wide body aircraft that could potentially serve with freighter airlines. For dedicated freighters the re-entry rate varies between 20% and 80% depending on the age of the aircraft. If we take into account the rate of 10% for passenger-to-freighter conversion, we get to 8 P2F conversions. If we add dedicated and converted freighters, we get to approximately 35 aircraft that could serve with a freighter airline and that is a very positive approach. I would feel more comfortable saying that at least 16 aircraft (the dedicated freighters) are likely to re-enter service as market conditions on the cargo market improve. Conclusion While there are over 2,000 aircraft stored only 10% of the popular aircraft are likely to re-enter service with passenger jets. This shows how small the number of aircraft suitable for re-entry under current market conditions is. While the aircraft suitable for re-entry with passenger airlines is already small, I think that re-entry with freighter airlines might be even smaller. If we look at the wide body jets that currently serve as freighter aircraft or have some conversion program in place, I do think that only a small percentage will return into service as a freighter aircraft. As a percentage of total aircraft stored I do not expect this to be bigger than 0.5%-2%. So at first it does make sense to operate stored aircraft from a cost perspective, but if we are going to look at supply side we see that there are not that many aircraft available. For passenger airlines about 40% of the total aircraft in storage re-enter, with only 10% being the more popular Boeing and Airbus aircraft. For cargo airlines, even smaller percentages apply. Additionally, re-entry of freighter aircraft is more tied to market conditions than to fuel prices. In the end, it seems that both passenger airlines and freighter airlines will be better off buying aircraft directly from airlines as they plan to retire the aircraft rather than trying to find their luck in the desert.

      "title": "Boeing, GM, 2 Other High-Yield Stocks Want to Pay You More",
      "text": "Don't let the stock market's recent rally to new highs distract you from dividends this fall. Capital gains may finally be a decent source of total returns again in 2016, but odds are dividends make up a bigger chunk of your portfolio's upside than you realize right now.\nAs of this writing, dividends still account for almost a quarter of the S&P 500's performance so far this year. That's no small contribution - and it means investors should be feeling pretty thankful for those payouts this Thanksgiving.\nBut the significance of dividends on stock market performance becomes a much bigger deal over the long-run. In fact, just over the last ten years, dividends have accounted for almost half of the S&P 500's performance, handing investors the difference between 66.5% gains, and 106.2% gains when reinvested dividends are factored in.\nTo find the biggest benefit from dividends, it's not enough to simply buy names with big payouts today - you've got to think about which names are going to be paying more tomorrow too. So instead of chasing yield, we'll try to step in front of the next round of stock payout hikes...\nFor our purposes, that \"crystal ball\" is composed of a few factors: namely a solid balance sheet, low payout ratio, and a history of dividend hikes. While those items don't guarantee dividend announcements in the next month or three, they do dramatically increase the odds that management will hike their cash payouts to shareholders. And they've helped us grab onto dividend hikes with a high success rate in the past.\nWithout further ado, here's a look at four big stocks that could be about to increase their dividend payments in the coming months. Think of it as your dividend preview.\nBoeing\nAt a glance, 2016 hasn't brought much in the way of upside for shares of aerospace giant Boeing ( BA ) . Year to date, Boeing is only up 3.4%, trailing the rest of the S&P in a meaningful way.\nBut that headline stat misses the bigger trend that's been taking place in Boeing's shares - since finding a price floor back in early February, Boeing has actually rallied 25%. Add in dividends, and Boeing's total returns jump to more than 30% over that stretch. Clearly, buyers are in control of this stock right now.\nAnd Boeing could be about to pay investors even more before the end of 2016. The firm looks likely to hike its dividend payout after four straight quarters cutting a check to shareholders of $1.09 per share.\nBoeing is one of the biggest aviation companies on the planet, operating a duopoly with European rival Airbus to sell medium and large commercial jets to passenger and cargo airlines. That's good business if you can get it. Barriers to entry are exceptionally high, and both Boeing and Airbus have huge demand backlogs, with Boeing's backlog sitting at approximately 5,600 commercial aircraft. That backlog provides somewhat of a safety net for Boeing's sales. Customers are happy to take delivery of new aircraft as quickly as Boeing can fly them off the assembly line.\nIn the past, around half of Boeing's sales have come from its defense business, but the combination of rocketing demand for commercial jets and a desire to pare back exposure to governmental budgetary concerns has reduced the defense segment to just 30% of sales. That mix is likely to shift back toward defense under the new administration, giving Boeing the ability to meaningfully move the growth needle as the commercial aircraft unit continues to move significant numbers of aircraft.\nLong term, the macro factors bode well for Boeing, as record high airline profits and anxiety over potentially higher crude oil prices and interest rates are likely to encourage carriers to place orders for more modern, fuel efficient aircraft like the 737 MAX, 777X, and the 787 Dreamliner now. Currently, Boeing pays out a 2.9% dividend yield at current price levels, but if history is any indication, we're likely to see a dividend hike in December...",

      "title": "Canada to Buy F-18s From Boeing to Shore Up Its Fighter Fleet - The New York Times",
      "text": "Photo An F-18 at an airshow in Hampshire, England, in 2012. Credit Adrian Dennis/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images OTTAWA — In what may be another blow for Lockheed Martin ’s hopes of selling F-35 fighter jets to Canada , the government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Tuesday that it would buy 18 F-18s from Boeing as a stopgap while it spends up to five years considering a long-term replacement for its aging fighter fleet. The previous Conservative government announced in 2010 that it would buy 65 F-35s . But two years later it backtracked and began a review after an independent audit found that the Lockheed Martin fighters would cost far more than anticipated: $45.8 billion to buy and operate the planes over a 42-year life span. During last year’s election campaign, Mr. Trudeau pledged he would not buy the radar-evading F-35, which has become one of the Pentagon’s most expensive weapons programs in history. Instead, he promised to find a more economical alternative. On Tuesday, Mr. Trudeau’s government did not go that far, perhaps out of concern that excluding Lockheed Martin from bidding could lead to legal challenges. Harjit Sajjan, the defense minister, said Canada would continue to be a member of an international group of nations contributing to the development of the F-35. Judy Foote, the minister in charge of procurement, said Lockheed Martin could renew its sales pitches during the long-term review. If it takes a full five years, that review will not conclude until after the next federal election in Canada. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story The latest version of the F-18 has been widely seen as the F-35’s chief competitor in any sale to Canada. Mr. Sajjan said the 18 fighters would allow Canada to retire the oldest airplanes in its fleet, which is made up entirely of CF-18s, the Canadian variant of the F-18. With the infusion of new aircraft, Mr. Sajjan said, the CF-18 fleet should continue flying until the end of the next decade. “The interim fleet provides the most effective way forward to help ensure Canada remains a credible and dependable ally,” Mr. Sajjan said after repeatedly criticizing the Conservatives for delaying the acquisition of a long-term replacement for the nation’s fighter jets. The Liberals’ new review, though, will further extend that process. David Perry, a senior analyst at the Canadian Global Affairs Institute in Ottawa, said technology differences with the new F-18s meant that the government would also have to acquire additional service equipment and other infrastructure. Subscribe to the Times “There are just a whole lot of things that come with buying 18 aircraft,” Mr. Perry said. Once that investment is made, he said, buying F-18s as the long-term replacement “will definitely be more cost effective” than buying F-35s. Cost, however, is not the only factor in the government’s decision. Given the amount of time the previous government spent studying the F-35, Mr. Perry said he did not understand why the Liberals needed five years for their review. “This particular project has been studied to death,” he said. Canada began flying the CF-18 in the 1980s. It originally had 138 fighters, but now they number 77. Last year, the Conservative government announced an upgrade program costing 400 million Canadian dollars, about $300 million, that it said would extend the fleet’s operating life to 2025. Conspicuously absent from Tuesday’s announcement was the cost of the new F-18s. That will be a matter of negotiation with Boeing, Ms. Foote said, adding that the government would reconsider its options if it is unable to obtain an acceptable price. During last year’s campaign, the Liberals priced F-18s at 65 million Canadian dollars each. At that time, it estimated that each F-35 would cost 175 million Canadian dollars. Those estimates have been questioned, and Lockheed Martin has said that once the F-35s are in full production, the price will be more like 75 million Canadian dollars. Those prices excluded spare parts, training and a variety of other costs that are normally included. Canada is not the only country to use F-18s as a stopgap. Australia purchased 24 of them five years ago during the wait for its F-35s. A version of this article appears in print on November 23, 2016, on page B6 of the New York edition with the headline: Canada to Buy F-18s From Boeing to Shore Up Its Fleet.

      "title": "Airbus to fly biggest A350 in battle of big twinjets",
      "text": "* Maiden flight of 366-seat A350-1000 due on Thursday\n* Biggest A350 model competes with Boeing 777\n* Planemakers vie to develop largest twin-engined jet\n* Rise of 'big twin' puts pressure on slow-selling superjumbos\nBy Tim Hepher\nPARIS, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Airbus is preparing to stage the maiden flight of its largest twin-engined airplane, the A350-1000, stepping up a war for sales in a market segment dominated by U.S. rival Boeing.\nBarring bad weather that could lead to a postponement, Thursday's roughly three-hour debut will add a new 366-seat member to the lightweight carbon-fibre A350 family, which entered service with the smaller A350-900 early last year.\nIt is part of a game of leapfrog at the top of the market for twin-engined long-haul jets, as the dominant planemakers vie to outdo each other in size and efficiency in a category expected to generate $1 trillion in orders over the next 20 years.\nIt is also at the centre of a new subsidy row between Europe and the United States at a time of protectionist pressures on both sides of the Atlantic. The World Trade Organization is expected to rule in coming days that Boeing received at least one strand of banned support for its response to the A350-1000, known as the 777X.\nAirbus said the A350-1000, a stretched version of the model which entered service last year, was scheduled to take off from its Toulouse base at around 0930 GMT on Thursday, returning there later, in an outing that marks the start of roughly a year of flight testing.\nThe United States says the plane and its smaller A350 sister model could only get off the drawing board thanks to damaging European subsidies, in a dispute likely to rumble on long after the A350-1000 enters service in the second half of 2017.\nThe aircraft, which sells for $356 million at list prices, is designed to compete with Boeing's 777-300ER, the most successful version of the U.S. planemaker's popular 777 family.\nAirbus hopes it will help it reach 50 percent of wide-body aircraft deliveries, up from 35 percent in 2015. But critics say the aircraft failed to deliver the knockout blow to the older 777 it had hoped, despite an upgrade in engine design.\nAirbus has sold 195 new-generation A350-1000s out of 810 total A350 orders, compared with 809 sales of the 777-300ER.\nLEAPFROG\nUnwilling to cede a lucrative spot at the top of the market for twin-engined jets, Boeing responded by launching the \"777X\", including the 406-seat 777-9. That has in turn sent its European rival looking for new and bigger solutions.\nEven before taking flight, industry sources say the A350-1000 has been eclipsed by a potential 400-seat version called A350-2000 which is being offered to key airlines, though Airbus recently deferred a decision on whether to develop it.\nIn one final throw of the dice, Boeing is mulling plans for an even larger \"777-10X\" which could seat some 450 people.\nSingapore Airlines could make a decision on which of those two concept jets to order by year-end, CNN reported this month.\n\"The category killer has been the 777-300ER and the A350-1000 fits there. The question is where the market is?: The sweet spot may not be the largest aircraft, but manufacturers don't yet know,\" said Agency Partners analyst Nick Cunningham.\nThe growth of the big twinjet is driven by advances in the largest engines, sparking a parallel battle between Boeing ally General Electric and Airbus supplier Rolls-Royce.\nBut by conquering 400 seats, the rise of the \"big twin\" raise questions over demand for slightly larger four-engined jets like the A380 and Boeing 747-8, whose sales are weak.\nThe trend was highlighted as recently as June. While Airbus celebrated a much-needed order boost from Virgin Atlantic, people familiar with the matter said the airline had decided behind the scenes to cancel its remaining orders for A380s.\nAdding to pressure on both planemakers as they stretch their designs, Thursday's debut coincides with a dip in demand for wide-body jets due to a surge of aircraft scheduled to be delivered later this decade and concerns over the economy.\nBoeing said last month it saw \"hesitation\" from airlines over such planes, but insisted long-term demand was sound.

PHOTO: CHANGI AIRPORT Nov 23, 2016 1:50 PM \n[SUVA, Fiji] Fiji Airways announced on Wednesday it had ordered five new Boeing 737s - reportedly worth US$470 million - as part of a fleet upgrade programme at the Pacific nation's flag carrier. \nThe airline said it would take delivery of two Boeing 737 MAX 8 aircraft next year and three more in 2018 to replace five earlier-model 737s currently operating. \nIt did not reveal the cost of the deal but local media reports put the price at FJ$1.0 billion (S$670.2 million). \n\"This is a major capital decision that had to be done correctly, so we followed a rigorous, thorough and transparent process to find the right solution,\" chief executive Andre Viljoen said. \nFiji Airways has a fleet of 15 aircraft made by a range of manufacturers, including Airbus and Boeing, and began a replacement programme in 2013. \nThe Fiji government, which owns a majority stake in the airline, said the new planes would give it one of the youngest fleets in the Asia-Pacific region. \n\"(It) means not only lower operating costs and a smaller carbon footprint but a level of comfort and service for the travelling public,\" Civil Aviation Minister Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum said. \nHe said that under the deal, Boeing would help Fiji Airlines establish a flight simulator school, making the country an aviation training hub in the Pacific. \nAFP ",

Warren, AP US durable goods orders up 4.8 percent in   Orders for big-ticket manufactured goods increased in October by the largest amount in a year, reflecting a surge in demand for commercial airplanes. The category that tracks business investment spending showed a far more modest advance, indicating this key category remains under stress.\nOrders for durable goods rose 4.8 percent in October, the Commerce Department reported Wednesday. That is the best showing since a similar advance in October 2015. The gain primarily reflected a 94.1 percent jump in demand for commercial airplanes, an extremely volatile category.\nThe category that tracks business investment plans was up a slight 0.4 percent, erasing only a small part of a 1.4 percent plunge in September. Business investment spending has been a drag on the economy this year, reflecting in part big cutbacks in the energy sector.\nSo far this year, orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft — the category used to track business investment — are down 4 percent from the   This weakness in investment has held back overall growth this year.\nEconomists said that the small rise in the investment category should strengthen further as the energy sector stabilizes following a big plunge.\n\"Manufacturing is not booming, despite the headline today, but neither is it sliding into the recession some feared earlier this year,\" said Ian Shepherdson   Pantheon Macroeconomics. \"We expect a gradual pickup in activity.\"\nEconomists believe the gradual gains in manufacturing will support a rebound for the overall economy in the second half of this year.\nPart of the optimism stems from a view that the plunge in energy investment, fueled by the sharp fall in energy prices, is coming to an end. The count of oil drilling rigs is up 49 percent from the low hit in May. Manufacturing has also been hurt this year by a strong dollar, which makes U.S. goods less competitive in overseas markets.\nThe economy, as measured by the gross domestic product, grew at a 2.9 percent rate in the third quarter, a significant improvement after growth averaged just 1.1 percent in the first half of the year.\nIn October, orders for machinery edged up a slight 0.2 percent, while demand for primary metals such as steel fell 0.1 percent. Orders for computers rose 6.8 percent.",

      "text": "The House Rules Committee has voted 7-2 to stop the sale or leasing of a few score commercial Boeing planes to Iran. But President Obama has promised to veto the bill , saying it would “undermine the ability of the United States to meet our JCPOA commitments.”\nTexas Republican Jeb Hensarling disputed this:\n[Hensarling] reminded the committee that the Treasury Department sanctioned Iran Air in 2011 for using its planes to transport military-related equipment on behalf of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.\nThe Treasury Department removed the sanctions as part of the Iran nuclear deal, but Hensarling says Iran’s behavior “remains unchanged.” Iran Air has continued to use its aircraft to fly weapons and resupply routes to Syria, he said.\n“Also last month, Iran conducted military drills using Boeing planes that have been a part of its air force fleet for many years,” he said. “This is not surprising as Boeing itself has posted that its commercial jetliners ‘make an ideal platform for a variety of military derivative aircraft.’”\nDenny Heck (D-WA) claimed that the Treasury Department has “minimize[d] [the] risk” that Iran would use the new Boeings for military purposes, and said that if the U.S. doesn’t sell Iran the planes, “a non-U.S. company like Airbus” (a European consortium) may do so instead.\nBy Heck’s logic, the U.S. should always sell militarily usable items to America-hating, terror-supporting, expansionist regimes, since someone else will anyway.\nIran, of course, does not lack suitors when it comes to selling it military items. Russia’s RT News blares : “Russia, Iran plan $10 bn arms sale to Tehran”. And that deal would occur “following the successful delivery of Russia’s S-300 air defense missile systems to the country in October.”\nUnder strong pressure from Israel, Putin refrained for years from selling Iran the S-300s, which will be deployed to protect its nuclear sites. But in July 2015, just after the signing of the JCPOA agreement -- which, we were told, would usher in an era of peace -- Putin approved the sale.\nNow, a Russian official says “all the S-300s that had been shipped to Iran will be put into operation by year’s end.”\nAs for the new $10 billion sale, the same official says it will include “T-90 tanks, artillery systems, and various aircraft” for Tehran.\nBecause of UN Security Council restrictions, the sale might have to wait -- but only until October 2020, when those restrictions will be lifted.\nThe negative developments since the nuke deal was signed, among others, not only include Russia’s arms sales to Iran, but also the emergence of Russian-Iranian military cooperation in the region. Considering this reality, President Obama’s insistence on the Boeing sale, and on treating Iran as a responsible party in general, can at best be understood as a case of severe strategic irrationality.\n security/2016/11/23/obama-on-way-out-looks-to-further-strengthen-iran/\n ",

      "text": "Don't let the stock market's recent rally to new highs distract you from dividends this fall. Capital gains may finally be a decent source of total returns again in 2016, but odds are dividends make up a bigger chunk of your portfolio's upside than you realize right now.\nAs of this writing, dividends still account for almost a quarter of the S&P 500's performance so far this year. That's no small contribution - and it means investors should be feeling pretty thankful for those payouts this Thanksgiving.\nBut the significance of dividends on stock market performance becomes a much bigger deal over the long-run. In fact, just over the last ten years, dividends have accounted for almost half of the S&P 500's performance, handing investors the difference between 66.5% gains, and 106.2% gains when reinvested dividends are factored in.\nTo find the biggest benefit from dividends, it's not enough to simply buy names with big payouts today - you've got to think about which names are going to be paying more tomorrow too. So instead of chasing yield, we'll try to step in front of the next round of stock payout hikes...\nFor our purposes, that \"crystal ball\" is composed of a few factors: namely a solid balance sheet, low payout ratio, and a history of dividend hikes. While those items don't guarantee dividend announcements in the next month or three, they do dramatically increase the odds that management will hike their cash payouts to shareholders. And they've helped us grab onto dividend hikes with a high success rate in the past.\nWithout further ado, here's a look at four big stocks that could be about to increase their dividend payments in the coming months. Think of it as your dividend preview.\nBoeing  \n\nAt a glance, 2016 hasn't brought much in the way of upside for shares of aerospace giant Boeing ( BA ) . Year to date, Boeing is only up 3.4%, trailing the rest of the S&P in a meaningful way.\nBut that headline stat misses the bigger trend that's been taking place in Boeing's shares - since finding a price floor back in early February, Boeing has actually rallied 25%. Add in dividends, and Boeing's total returns jump to more than 30% over that stretch. Clearly, buyers are in control of this stock right now.\nAnd Boeing could be about to pay investors even more before the end of 2016. The firm looks likely to hike its dividend payout after four straight quarters cutting a check to shareholders of $1.09 per share.\nBoeing is one of the biggest aviation companies on the planet, operating a duopoly with European rival Airbus to sell medium and large commercial jets to passenger and cargo airlines. That's good business if you can get it. Barriers to entry are exceptionally high, and both Boeing and Airbus have huge demand backlogs, with Boeing's backlog sitting at approximately 5,600 commercial aircraft. That backlog provides somewhat of a safety net for Boeing's sales. Customers are happy to take delivery of new aircraft as quickly as Boeing can fly them off the assembly line.\nIn the past, around half of Boeing's sales have come from its defense business, but the combination of rocketing demand for commercial jets and a desire to pare back exposure to governmental budgetary concerns has reduced the defense segment to just 30% of sales. That mix is likely to shift back toward defense under the new administration, giving Boeing the ability to meaningfully move the growth needle as the commercial aircraft unit continues to move significant numbers of aircraft.\nLong term, the macro factors bode well for Boeing, as record high airline profits and anxiety over potentially higher crude oil prices and interest rates are likely to encourage carriers to place orders for more modern, fuel efficient aircraft like the 737 MAX, 777X, and the 787 Dreamliner now. Currently, Boeing pays out a 2.9% dividend yield at current price levels, but if history is any indication, we're likely to see a dividend hike in December...\nPrev 0 of 4 Next",

REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson/File Photo A \nMONTREAL: Aerospace companies in the Canadian province of Quebec will likely benefit from in-service support contracts linked to a federal government purchase of 18 Boeing Co Super Hornets, an industry group said on Wednesday. \nOn Tuesday, Canada's Liberal government said it would initiate talks with Boeing to soon acquire Super Hornets as a stop-gap measure while preparing an open, five-year competition to replace its aging fleet of fighter jets. \nWhile the terms of a Super Hornet deal are not yet clear, the purchase could generate new in-service support contracts for industry in Canada's aerospace hub of Quebec, where CF-18s are now maintained, said Suzanne Benoit, director general of Aero-Montreal. \n\"Quebec is well positioned for all aspects of services support and other specialized areas related to this type of aircraft,\" Benoit said in a statement. \nBoeing has said it is committed to giving Canadian companies contracts as a result of the deal. \nOne aerospace analyst suggested Montreal-headquartered CAE Inc would likely benefit as it could partner with Boeing to deliver training. \nSimulator-manufacturer CAE works with L-3 MAS, a Quebec-based division of L-3 Communications Holdings Inc , to provide in-service support for the aging CF-18s. \nCAE spokeswoman Pascale Alpha said in an email the company wants to provide support for both the existing CF-18 fleet, and future Super Hornets aircraft. \n\"We have the experience to do that,\" she wrote. \"We believe we are in the best position to (also) provide the training for the fleet of Super Hornets to Canada.\" \nCanada's Procurement Minister Judy Foote has said details about the in-service support component of a Super Hornets procurement would be known next year. \nCanada intends to buy the 18 Super Hornets outright, as opposed to leasing them or purchasing them with a buyback provision, a source familiar with the matter said. \nReplacing the CF-18 jets - some of which have been flying for 35 years - has been repeatedly put off. \nCanada's former Conservative government said in 2010 it would buy 65 F-35 jets from Boeing rival Lockheed Martin Corp for CUS$9 billion (US$6.7 billion). During last year's election campaign, the Liberals vowed not to buy the planes on the grounds they were too costly. \nLockheed has given Canadian firms about US$1 billion in development and production work on the F-35 fighter jet program. \n(Reporting By Allison Lampert; Editing by Alan Crosby) - Reuters",

Boeing said the award replaces compensation he forfeited when he left former employer General Electric. Share story Dominic Gates Seattle Times aerospace reporter \nBoeing has granted shares currently worth just short of $18 million to the new CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes as he joins the company. \nIn a financial filing, Boeing said the award to Kevin McAllister is “to replace certain compensation (he) forfeited when he left his former employer,” General Electric. \nThe shares will vest in stages over the next nine years, provided he stays at Boeing. \nMcAllister, 53, who was CEO of GE’s Aviation Services unit, was named Monday as the first outsider to lead Commercial Airplanes , which has 78,000 employees worldwide and brings in revenue of about $66 billion per year. Most Read Stories Unlimited Digital Access. $1 for 4 weeks. \nIn a company video of the new executive’s introduction to a small group of employees gathered at Boeing Field on Monday, McAllister in brief remarks spoke of his origins as “a kid who grew up in the small town of Bethlehem, Pennsylvania,” and made an initial impression as someone appealingly down-to-earth rather than a stiff corporate suit. \nWhile selling GE’s jet engines, McAllister said, he worked over the past 15 years with many people from Boeing “in the trenches of campaigns to go out and win.” \n“I’m not new to Boeing,” he said. \nIn a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission released Wednesday, Boeing revealed that it granted McAllister 120,000 company shares. \nThe first 20,000 shares, which at today’s stock price are worth $3 million, vest in two years. A further 25,000 shares vest in five years, another 50,000 in seven years and the final 25,000 in 2025. Dominic Gates: 206-464-2963 or Custom-curated news highlights, delivered weekday mornings.

      "text": "MONTREAL –   Aerospace companies in the Canadian province of Quebec will likely benefit from in-service support contracts linked to a federal government purchase of 18 Boeing Co Super Hornets, an industry group said on Wednesday. \n \nOn Tuesday, Canada's Liberal government said it would initiate talks with Boeing to soon acquire Super Hornets as a stop-gap measure while preparing an open, five-year competition to replace its aging fleet of fighter jets. \nWhile the terms of a Super Hornet deal are not yet clear, the purchase could generate new in-service support contracts for industry in Canada's aerospace hub of Quebec, where CF-18s are now maintained, said Suzanne Benoit, director general of Aero-Montreal. \n\"Quebec is well positioned for all aspects of services support and other specialized areas related to this type of aircraft,\" Benoit said in a statement. \nBoeing has said it is committed to giving Canadian companies contracts as a result of the deal. \nOne aerospace analyst suggested Montreal-headquartered CAE Inc would likely benefit as it could partner with Boeing to deliver training. \n ",

      "title": "A Look At Boeing's Commercial Orders And Deliveries In October 2016",
      "text": "A Look At Boeing's Commercial Orders And Deliveries In October 2016 Nov.23.16 Summary \nBoeing booked 85 orders. \nBA delivered 54 aircraft, five less than the monthly requirement to meet the annual delivery target. \nBook-to-bill ratio currently is .88. As part of the annual order and delivery battle between Boeing (NYSE: BA ) and Airbus ( OTCPK:EADSF ) ( OTCPK:EADSY ), I provide a monthly overview and analysis. The September report can be read here . In this article, I will have a look at the orders and deliveries in October. Click to enlarge Click to enlarge Figure 1: Boeing orders up until October 2016 (Source: AeroAnalysis) In September, Boeing booked 55 orders. October saw a significantly higher order inflow with a focus on wide-body sales. Boeing received 85 orders; 72 wide-body orders and 13 narrow-body orders. Almost half of the orders came from Qatar Airways, which ordered 30 Boeing 787-9 aircraft and 10 Boeing 777-300ERs. Swiss International Air Lines placed a follow-up order for one Boeing 777-300ER. UPS (NYSE: UPS ) placed an order for 14 Boeing 747-8F aircraft. Two unidentified customers ordered 12 and five Boeing 787-9 airframes, respectively. The order for 12 units likely comes from China Southern Airlines ( OTCPK:CHKIF ). Two unidentified customers ordered six and two Boeing 737MAX airframes, respectively. An unidentified customer ordered five Boeing 737-900ER aircraft. At list prices, the orders are valued $23.5B, but after discounts, the market value is closer to $10.9B. A few things that are interesting to observe here is the fact that the Boeing 747-8 program received the order inflow it was desperately looking for. For the year, net orders for the Boeing 747 now equal that of the Boeing 777, while Boeing is closing in on the number of Dreamliners it sold last year. Compared to October 2015, order inflow increased by 45%. During the first 10 months of 2016, Boeing received 545 orders versus 557 orders in the first 10 months of 2015, a 2% decline. Boeing is still trailing year over year, but the gap has closed somewhat over the last month. Deliveries Click to enlarge Figure 2: Boeing deliveries (up until) October 2016 (Source: AeroAnalysis) For 2016, Boeing guided slightly lower, reflecting lower production rate on the Boeing 747 program and the transition towards the Boeing 737MAX combined with a gap on the Boeing 737NG. In October, the jet maker increased its guidance for deliveries in 2016 from 740-745 deliveries to 745-750 deliveries. In October, Boeing delivered 54 aircraft valued at $4.4B. Deliveries decreased by 18 units month over month, but four units less compared to October 2015: Split between narrow- and wide-body deliveries was 65:35. No freighter aircraft were delivered. Despite relatively lower deliveries, the drop in deliveries is not worrying. Lower deliveries are primarily caused by lower deliveries on the Boeing 737 programs in combination with the absence of freighter deliveries. 13 Dreamliners were delivered, 11 of which were Boeing 787-9s. It can be concluded that the Boeing 787-9 will have the upper hand in the Dreamliner deliveries, which bodes well for Boeing as the aircraft has higher profit margins and brings in more cash. Delivery volume was below the monthly average. In order to reach its delivery target, Boeing will need 62 deliveries per month for the remaining months this year. Book-to-bill ratio Just like in 2015, Boeing is targeting a 1:1 book-to-bill ratio. However, internal figures suggest that Boeing is aiming for a book-to-bill ratio of .7, and we observed a slight change in rhetoric as well. In October, Boeing booked 85 orders and delivered 54 airframes, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.57. Year to date, the book-to-bill ratio is .88. Despite order inflow and deliveries picking up pace throughout the year, the road towards reaching its targets will be a long one for Boeing. I do believe that a book-to-bill ratio below one is more realistic. Customer spotlight Click to enlarge In this month's customer spotlight, we have Qatar Airways. The airline was established in 1993 and commenced operation in 1994. The airline has a total of 151 destinations. In a relatively short time frame, the airline has grown to become one of the G3 carriers with a fleet of 190 aircraft. The airline started with a fleet of Airbus A310 aircraft and later added second-hand Boeing 747s to achieve its growth aspirations. Fast-forward to 2016 and the airline has a fleet of 190 aircraft, 86 Boeings and 104 Airbus aircraft with unfilled orders for 223 aircraft. In October, the airline ordered 40 Boeing wide-body jets and signed a Letter of Intent for the purchase of up to 60 Boeing 737MAX aircraft. Conclusion In October, Boeing saw a satisfying order inflow focused on wide-body jets. Boeing's gross book-to-bill ratio is .88, which is an improvement from the .81 a month ago, but there is some work to do for the marketing team. In 2015, Boeing achieved its book-to-bill target at the very last moment. Despite lower anticipated deliveries in 2016, I expect Boeing to be facing a challenge to achieve its book-to-bill target. In April 2015, I published an article in which I stated that the order books of jet makers are not bubbles, but should decline at some point. In that article, I shared my thoughts and expected order inflow to decline. With oil prices having declined ever since, chances are the order books will decline sooner than I expected at first. With Boeing just barely meeting its target last year, 2016 might be the year in which the company will not achieve its book-to-bill ratio. In Boeing's upcoming earnings report, I am expecting some more information on sales targets. Boeing is currently below its desired book-to-bill ratio and still has to sell roughly 200 aircraft to reach its target. Orders tend to increase a bit towards year-end. Reaching a gross book-to-bill ratio of one is possible if BA has some bigger orders in its sleeve for the last two months of 2016.

      "text": "Money News | Thu Nov 24, 2016 | 3:49am IST Quebec aerospace industry expects benefits from Boeing jet deal Boeing facilities are seen in Los Angeles, California, U.S. April 22, 2016. REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson/File Photo By Allison Lampert | MONTREAL \nMONTREAL Aerospace companies in the Canadian province of Quebec will likely benefit from in-service support contracts linked to a federal government purchase of 18 Boeing Co ( BA.N ) Super Hornets, an industry group said on Wednesday. \nOn Tuesday, Canada's Liberal government said it would initiate talks with Boeing to soon acquire Super Hornets as a stop-gap measure while preparing an open, five-year competition to replace its aging fleet of fighter jets. \nWhile the terms of a Super Hornet deal are not yet clear, the purchase could generate new in-service support contracts for industry in Canada's aerospace hub of Quebec, where CF-18s are now maintained, said Suzanne Benoit, director general of Aero-Montreal. \n\"Quebec is well positioned for all aspects of services support and other specialized areas related to this type of aircraft,\" Benoit said in a statement. \nBoeing has said it is committed to giving Canadian companies contracts as a result of the deal. \nOne aerospace analyst suggested Montreal-headquartered CAE Inc ( CAE.TO ) would likely benefit as it could partner with Boeing to deliver training. \nSimulator-manufacturer CAE works with L-3 MAS, a Quebec-based division of L-3 Communications Holdings Inc ( LLL.N ), to provide in-service support for the aging CF-18s. \nCAE spokeswoman Pascale Alpha said in an email the company wants to provide support for both the existing CF-18 fleet, and future Super Hornets aircraft. \n\"We have the experience to do that,\" she wrote. \"We believe we are in the best position to (also) provide the training for the fleet of Super Hornets to Canada.\" \nCanada's Procurement Minister Judy Foote has said details about the in-service support component of a Super Hornets procurement would be known next year. \nCanada intends to buy the 18 Super Hornets outright, as opposed to leasing them or purchasing them with a buyback provision, a source familiar with the matter said. \nReplacing the CF-18 jets - some of which have been flying for 35 years - has been repeatedly put off. \nCanada's former Conservative government said in 2010 it would buy 65 F-35 jets from Boeing rival Lockheed Martin Corp ( LMT.N ) for C$9 billion ($6.7 billion). During last year's election campaign, the Liberals vowed not to buy the planes on the grounds they were too costly. \nLockheed has given Canadian firms about $1 billion in development and production work on the F-35 fighter jet program. \n(Reporting By Allison Lampert; Editing by Alan Crosby) Next In Money News ",

      "title": "Boeing responds to ‘errors’ and ‘flawed assumptions’ about its proposed satellite system in 37/39 GHz band",
      "text": "by Monica Alleven | Nov 22, 2016 5:48pm Boeing argues that its proposed NGSO satellite system can operate in the 37/39 GHz band without appreciable interference with terrestrial systems. (Image: Boeing) \nAerospace giant Boeing continues to defend its proposal to launch a constellation of low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites in order to offer broadband services to all Americans, similar to the plans of OneWeb and SpaceX, and its latest filing with the FCC addresses concerns brought up by the likes of T-Mobile US, Samsung, CTIA, Straight Path Communications and Nokia. \nMuch of Boeing’s filing takes direct aim at Straight Path, however, a small company that holds hundreds of 39 GHz licenses, including those it acquired from Winstar, that has been critical of the satellite industry's plans. Boeing said Straight Path’s Oct. 31 analysis confirms Boeing’s technical findings “once Straight Path’s analysis is corrected for the significant errors in calculations and assumptions that Straight Path employed.” \nThe most significant error, according to Boeing, is Straight Path’s use of an incorrect equation for the model of the Upper Microwave Flexible Use Service (UMRUS) planar array antenna, which results in sidelobes that are “twice as high as would actually result.” \nBoeing says Straight Path makes other incorrect assertions about the operations of Boeing’s non-geostationary satellite orbit (NGSO) systems in the 37/39 GHz band, including the assumption that satellites will transmit toward Earth from all angles, including very low elevation angles, despite Boeing’s assurance that its satellites will not transmit at angles below 45 degrees. Boeing also said Straight Path “disregards the transient nature of NGSO interference, acknowledging, but failing to take into account that low Earth orbit satellites move quickly across the sky.” \nA Straight Path representative wasn’t immediately available to comment on Boeing’s most recent filing, but if the past is any indication, they’re at opposite ends of the spectrum when it comes to the 37/39 GHz band. Straight Path previously provided analysis of various interference scenarios between fixed satellite services (FSS) and 5G services in the 39 GHz band, and on Oct. 31, Straight Path provided an update, incorporating progress in 3GPP regarding the modeling of 5G base stations and mobile stations. Straight Path focused on the 39 GHz band but said its conclusions were applicable to the 37 GHz band as well. \nRELATED: Boeing refutes Straight Path suggestion that sharing analysis will effectively 'cede' U.S. leadership in 5G \nAs for CTIA’s concerns, Boeing says they also require corrections. “CTIA mistakes measurements performed on satellite earth station gateways operating in the uplink direction in the 28 GHz band as being applicable to satellite downlink transmissions in the 37/39 GHz band,” wrote Boeing's counsel, Bruce A. Olcott, in the FCC filing. “CTIA references Nokia’s claim that it conducted measurements showing that earth station gateway transmissions in the 28 GHz band were 20-30 dB higher than the adopted limits.” \n“Obviously, localized measurements of uplink emissions from satellite earth stations at distances of less than 200 meters have no bearing on the potential downlink emissions encountered from orbiting satellites located some 1,200 kilometers away from UMFUS receiving equipment,” Olcott stated. “CTIA’s assertions are therefore specious.” \nRELATED: CTIA tells FCC to reject arguments by Boeing, SIA about 37-40 GHz band \nAs for Samsung, it, too, got it wrong according to Boeing. “In generating its recommendations for satellite downlink PFD limits in the 37/39 GHz band … Samsung employs calculations that use the 28 GHz as the operating frequency band. The 28 GHz band is used by satellite networks as an uplink band and not as a downlink band. As a result, the PFD levels suggested in the Samsung Appendix are incorrect,” the company wrote, noting what it considers the corrected values. \nAddressing T-Mobile’s issues, Boeing says its concern about potential interference is unjustified. “T-Mobile’s concerns that multiple beams employed by an UMFUS end user device may experience more interference is unfounded and such devices are already envisioned and included” by the equivalent power flux density (ePFD) regulations proposed by Boeing, the company said. \nNokia raised a number of questions in comments filed with the commission, and Boeing sought to address those as well, saying it derived UMFUS antenna gain parameters using the 3GPP channel model antenna modeling recommendations for planar arrays, among other things. \nBoeing’s proposed NGSO system calls for 2,956 satellites, although the initial deployment would consist of a constellation of 1,396 LEO satellites operating at a 1,200 kilometers altitude. That’s compared to the 4,425 satellites that SpaceX is proposing to operate at altitudes ranging from 1,110 kilometers to 1,325 kilometers. Boeing filed its application with the FCC in June and SpaceX submitted its application to the FCC on Nov. 15. \nOneWeb, which has the backing of Qualcomm’s Paul Jacobs and Virgin Group’s Sir Richard Branson, is talking about launching at least 700 satellites as the basis for its LEO constellation, which would orbit at an altitude of 1,200 kilometers. That system calls for low-cost, easy to install Ku-band user terminals, and a small number of globally distributed Ka-band gateway antennas. OneWeb submitted its license application with U.S. regulators back in April. Read more on",

      "text": "JG Business Associated Press Airplanes are on the assembly line at Boeing’s 737 assembly facility in Renton, Wash. A rise in orders for commercial airplanes helped boost demand for big-ticket manufactured goods in October. November 24, 2016 1:01 AM Manufacturing jumps 4.8% MARTIN CRUTSINGER | Associated Press \nWASHINGTON – Orders for big-ticket manufactured goods increased in October by the largest amount in a year, reflecting a surge in demand for commercial airplanes. The category that tracks business investment spending showed a far more modest advance, indicating this key category remains under stress. \nOrders for durable goods rose 4.8 percent in October, the Commerce Department reported Wednesday. That is the best showing since a similar advance in October 2015. The gain primarily reflected a 94.1 percent jump in demand for commercial airplanes, an extremely volatile category. \nThe category that tracks business investment plans was up a slight 0.4 percent, erasing only a small part of a 1.4 percent plunge in September. Business investment spending has been a drag on the economy this year, reflecting in part big cutbacks in the energy sector. \nSo far this year, orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft – the category used to track business investment – are down 4 percent from the same period in 2015. This weakness in investment has held back overall growth this year. \nEconomists said that the small rise in the investment category should strengthen further as the energy sector stabilizes following a big plunge. \n“Manufacturing is not booming, despite the headline today, but neither is it sliding into the recession some feared earlier this year,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. “We expect a gradual pickup in activity.”",

By: FE Online | Published: November 23, 2016 4:38 PM The new Airbus A350-1000 aircraft is all set for its first flight on November 24. \nThe new Airbus A350-1000 aircraft is all set for its first flight on November 24. According to Airbus, the new aircraft has an enhanced range and provides greater comfort. The A350-1000 measures around 74 metres from nose to tail and is scheduled to enter service some time in 2017. The first plane will be delivered to Qatar Airways. A number of airlines, including Virgin Atlantic, have placed orders for the new A350-1000. \nAirbus says that the A350-1000 is the longest-fuselage version of its new family of wide body jetliners. The A350-1000 will be able to seat a total of 366 passengers. Airbus says that its latest aircraft can be configured for a higher-density layout to accommodate up to 440 passengers. In its typical 3-class configuration, the Airbus A350-1000 will have 18-inch wide seats in the economy class. The A350-1000 has new cabin crew rest compartment improvements, new in-flight Entertainment (IFE), optimised lavatory shapes and new galley arrangements, claims the company. \nNow I’m ready for my close up – the #A350 -1000’s first paint job. First flight scheduled on Thursday Nov. 24 (weather permitting) #A350FF pic.twitter.com/1bCLTmupHY \n— Airbus (@Airbus) November 22, 2016 \nThe Airbus A350-1000 is powered by “higher-thrust” Trent XWB engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce. The engine will provide additional payload capability and range, along with 97,000 lbs. of thrust on take-off, Airbus says. The A350-1000 is a 7,950 nautical-mile-range aircraft with a wing span of 64.75 m and a maximum payload of 20.89 tonnes. Airbus claims that the A350-1000 offers a 25% lower operating cost than its similarly sized competitors. The latest aircraft from Airbus’ stable will take on the Boeing 777. The average list price of the A350-1000 for the year 2016 is $355.7 million. \nMeanwhile, it was reported in March this year that Airbus is seeking airline support for a new 400-seat jetliner provisionally dubbed the A350-8000. Airbus is expected to aim its design at airlines that do not always require the performance needed for extreme Gulf conditions. “It would have similar capacity and range (as the 777-9) and substantially lower seat-mile costs,” Airbus sales chief John Leahy was quoted as saying. \nThe A350 XWB (Extra Wide Body) family, of which the A350-1000 is a part, was launched after a string of setbacks in 2006 to compete with Boeing’s mid-sized 787 Dreamliner and the larger 777. Boeing responded to the all-new jet by upgrading its existing 777 family to include the 777-9, one of a pair of jets also known as the 777X series. The new, bigger A350 would use a derivative of the latest Rolls-Royce Trent XWB engines. \n(With inputs from Reuters) Please Wait while comments are loading... Trending Now ",

      "text": "Quebec aerospace industry expects benefits from Boeing jet deal Updated: November 23, 2016 — 5:11 PM EST Share Reuters \nBy Allison Lampert \nMONTREAL, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Aerospace companies in the Canadian province of Quebec will likely benefit from in-service support contracts linked to a federal government purchase of 18 Boeing Co Super Hornets, an industry group said on Wednesday. \nOn Tuesday, Canada's Liberal government said it would initiate talks with Boeing to soon acquire Super Hornets as a stop-gap measure while preparing an open, five-year competition to replace its aging fleet of fighter jets. \nWhile the terms of a Super Hornet deal are not yet clear, the purchase could generate new in-service support contracts for industry in Canada's aerospace hub of Quebec, where CF-18s are now maintained, said Suzanne Benoit, director general of Aero-Montreal. \n\"Quebec is well positioned for all aspects of services support and other specialized areas related to this type of aircraft,\" Benoit said in a statement. \nBoeing has said it is committed to giving Canadian companies contracts as a result of the deal. \nOne aerospace analyst suggested Montreal-headquartered CAE Inc would likely benefit as it could partner with Boeing to deliver training. \nSimulator-manufacturer CAE works with L-3 MAS, a Quebec-based division of L-3 Communications Holdings Inc , to provide in-service support for the aging CF-18s. \nCAE spokeswoman Pascale Alpha said in an email the company wants to provide support for both the existing CF-18 fleet, and future Super Hornets aircraft. \n\"We have the experience to do that,\" she wrote. \"We believe we are in the best position to (also) provide the training for the fleet of Super Hornets to Canada.\" \nCanada's Procurement Minister Judy Foote has said details about the in-service support component of a Super Hornets procurement would be known next year. \nCanada intends to buy the 18 Super Hornets outright, as opposed to leasing them or purchasing them with a buyback provision, a source familiar with the matter said. \nReplacing the CF-18 jets - some of which have been flying for 35 years - has been repeatedly put off. \nCanada's former Conservative government said in 2010 it would buy 65 F-35 jets from Boeing rival Lockheed Martin Corp for C$9 billion ($6.7 billion). During last year's election campaign, the Liberals vowed not to buy the planes on the grounds they were too costly. \nLockheed has given Canadian firms about $1 billion in development and production work on the F-35 fighter jet program.

      "text": "Quebec aerospace industry expects benefits from Boeing jet deal Boeing facilities are seen in Los Angeles, California. Photo: Reuters Tweet Published: 6:50 AM, November 24, 2016 \nMONTREAL - Aerospace companies in the Canadian province of Quebec will likely benefit from in-service support contracts linked to a federal government purchase of 18 Boeing Co <BA.N> Super Hornets, an industry group said on Wednesday. \nOn Tuesday, Canada's Liberal government said it would initiate talks with Boeing to soon acquire Super Hornets as a stop-gap measure while preparing an open, five-year competition to replace its aging fleet of fighter jets. \nWhile the terms of a Super Hornet deal are not yet clear, the purchase could generate new in-service support contracts for industry in Canada's aerospace hub of Quebec, where CF-18s are now maintained, said Suzanne Benoit, director general of Aero-Montreal. \n\"Quebec is well positioned for all aspects of services support and other specialized areas related to this type of aircraft,\" Benoit said in a statement. \nBoeing has said it is committed to giving Canadian companies contracts as a result of the deal. \nOne aerospace analyst suggested Montreal-headquartered CAE Inc <CAE.TO> would likely benefit as it could partner with Boeing to deliver training. \nSimulator-manufacturer CAE works with L-3 MAS, a Quebec-based division of L-3 Communications Holdings Inc <LLL.N>, to provide in-service support for the aging CF-18s. \nCAE spokeswoman Pascale Alpha said in an email the company wants to provide support for both the existing CF-18 fleet, and future Super Hornets aircraft. \n\"We have the experience to do that,\" she wrote. \"We believe we are in the best position to (also) provide the training for the fleet of Super Hornets to Canada.\" \nCanada's Procurement Minister Judy Foote has said details about the in-service support component of a Super Hornets procurement would be known next year. \nCanada intends to buy the 18 Super Hornets outright, as opposed to leasing them or purchasing them with a buyback provision, a source familiar with the matter said. \nReplacing the CF-18 jets - some of which have been flying for 35 years - has been repeatedly put off. \nCanada's former Conservative government said in 2010 it would buy 65 F-35 jets from Boeing rival Lockheed Martin Corp <LMT.N> for C$9 billion ($6.7 billion). During last year's election campaign, the Liberals vowed not to buy the planes on the grounds they were too costly. \nLockheed has given Canadian firms about $1 billion in development and production work on the F-35 fighter jet program.

      "text": "Share By Allison Lampert MONTREAL, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Aerospace companies in the Canadian province of Quebec will likely benefit from in-service support contracts linked to a federal government purchase of 18 Boeing Co Super Hornets, an industry group said on Wednesday. On Tuesday, Canada's Liberal government said it would initiate talks with Boeing to soon acquire Super Hornets as a stop-gap measure while preparing an open, five-year competition to replace its aging fleet of fighter jets. While the terms of a Super Hornet deal are not yet clear, the purchase could generate new in-service support contracts for industry in Canada's aerospace hub of Quebec, where CF-18s are now maintained, said Suzanne Benoit, director general of Aero-Montreal. \"Quebec is well positioned for all aspects of services support and other specialized areas related to this type of aircraft,\" Benoit said in a statement. Boeing has said it is committed to giving Canadian companies contracts as a result of the deal. One aerospace analyst suggested Montreal-headquartered CAE Inc would likely benefit as it could partner with Boeing to deliver training. Simulator-manufacturer CAE works with L-3 MAS, a Quebec-based division of L-3 Communications Holdings Inc , to provide in-service support for the aging CF-18s. CAE spokeswoman Pascale Alpha said in an email the company wants to provide support for both the existing CF-18 fleet, and future Super Hornets aircraft. \"We have the experience to do that,\" she wrote. \"We believe we are in the best position to (also) provide the training for the fleet of Super Hornets to Canada.\" Canada's Procurement Minister Judy Foote has said details about the in-service support component of a Super Hornets procurement would be known next year. Canada intends to buy the 18 Super Hornets outright, as opposed to leasing them or purchasing them with a buyback provision, a source familiar with the matter said. Replacing the CF-18 jets - some of which have been flying for 35 years - has been repeatedly put off. Canada's former Conservative government said in 2010 it would buy 65 F-35 jets from Boeing rival Lockheed Martin Corp for C$9 billion ($6.7 billion). During last year's election campaign, the Liberals vowed not to buy the planes on the grounds they were too costly. Lockheed has given Canadian firms about $1 billion in development and production work on the F-35 fighter jet program. (Reporting By Allison Lampert; Editing by Alan Crosby) Reblog",

      "text": "* Maiden flight of 366-seat A350-1000 due on Thursday * Biggest A350 model competes with Boeing 777 * Planemakers vie to develop largest twin-engined jet * Rise of 'big twin' puts pressure on slow-selling superjumbos By Tim Hepher PARIS, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Airbus is preparing to stage the maiden flight of its largest twin-engined airplane, the A350-1000, stepping up a war for sales in a market segment dominated by U.S. rival Boeing. Barring bad weather that could lead to a postponement, Thursday's roughly three-hour debut will add a new 366-seat member to the lightweight carbon-fibre A350 family, which entered service with the smaller A350-900 early last year. It is part of a game of leapfrog at the top of the market for twin-engined long-haul jets, as the dominant planemakers vie to outdo each other in size and efficiency in a category expected to generate $1 trillion in orders over the next 20 years. It is also at the centre of a new subsidy row between Europe and the United States at a time of protectionist pressures on both sides of the Atlantic. The World Trade Organization is expected to rule in coming days that Boeing received at least one strand of banned support for its response to the A350-1000, known as the 777X. Airbus said the A350-1000, a stretched version of the model which entered service last year, was scheduled to take off from its Toulouse base at around 0930 GMT on Thursday, returning there later, in an outing that marks the start of roughly a year of flight testing. The United States says the plane and its smaller A350 sister model could only get off the drawing board thanks to damaging European subsidies, in a dispute likely to rumble on long after the A350-1000 enters service in the second half of 2017. The aircraft, which sells for $356 million at list prices, is designed to compete with Boeing's 777-300ER, the most successful version of the U.S. planemaker's popular 777 family. Airbus hopes it will help it reach 50 percent of wide-body aircraft deliveries, up from 35 percent in 2015. But critics say the aircraft failed to deliver the knockout blow to the older 777 it had hoped, despite an upgrade in engine design. Airbus has sold 195 new-generation A350-1000s out of 810 total A350 orders, compared with 809 sales of the 777-300ER. LEAPFROG Unwilling to cede a lucrative spot at the top of the market for twin-engined jets, Boeing responded by launching the \"777X\", including the 406-seat 777-9. That has in turn sent its European rival looking for new and bigger solutions. Even before taking flight, industry sources say the A350-1000 has been eclipsed by a potential 400-seat version called A350-2000 which is being offered to key airlines, though Airbus recently deferred a decision on whether to develop it. In one final throw of the dice, Boeing is mulling plans for an even larger \"777-10X\" which could seat some 450 people. Singapore Airlines could make a decision on which of those two concept jets to order by year-end, CNN reported this month. \"The category killer has been the 777-300ER and the A350-1000 fits there. The question is where the market is?: The sweet spot may not be the largest aircraft, but manufacturers don't yet know,\" said Agency Partners analyst Nick Cunningham. The growth of the big twinjet is driven by advances in the largest engines, sparking a parallel battle between Boeing ally General Electric and Airbus supplier Rolls-Royce. But by conquering 400 seats, the rise of the \"big twin\" raise questions over demand for slightly larger four-engined jets like the A380 and Boeing 747-8, whose sales are weak. The trend was highlighted as recently as June. While Airbus celebrated a much-needed order boost from Virgin Atlantic, people familiar with the matter said the airline had decided behind the scenes to cancel its remaining orders for A380s. Adding to pressure on both planemakers as they stretch their designs, Thursday's debut coincides with a dip in demand for wide-body jets due to a surge of aircraft scheduled to be delivered later this decade and concerns over the economy. Boeing said last month it saw \"hesitation\" from airlines over such planes, but insisted long-term demand was sound. (Editing by Adrian Croft)",

      "text": "(Adds aviation analyst comments) By David Ljunggren and Leah Schnurr OTTAWA, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Canada on Thursday unveiled plans to buy 18 Boeing Corp Super Hornets as a stop-gap measure while it prepared an open five-year competition to replace its aging fleet of fighter jets. Procurement Minister Judy Foote told a news conference the government would launch immediate talks with Boeing for the Super Hornets, in a victory for the U.S. plane maker if the order goes ahead. One defense contractor said the choice could be interpreted as giving Boeing a long-term advantage but Foote, speaking in a phone interview, later said Ottawa would run \"a real, open, transparent competition\" where any firm could compete. The language of Canada's announcement prompted speculation about whether it was buying the Boeing jets outright, leasing them or purchasing with a buyback provision. An outright purchase of the Super Hornets would make it harder for Canada to later justify acquiring other jets as it would be more costly to operate both programs, said U.S. aerospace industry analyst Richard Aboulafia of the Teal Group. Spokespeople for Foote and Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A Boeing Defense spokesman declined to comment. The decision on how to replace Canada's CF-18 jets - some of which have been flying for 35 years - is politically sensitive and has been repeatedly put off. Sajjan said the CF-18s could no longer meet Canada's international military commitments. \"Because they were not replaced, we now have a capability gap ... we need additional planes as soon as possible for an interim period,\" he told the news conference. The former Conservative administration said in 2010 it would buy 65 Lockheed Martin Corp F-35 jets for C$9 billion ($6.7 billion). During last year's successful election campaign, the Liberals vowed not to buy the planes on the grounds they were too costly. Sajjan said Canada would remain a member of the nine-nation consortium that helped fund development of the F-35. Lockheed Martin said that while it was disappointed with the choice of an interim fighter it was \"confident the F-35 is the best solution\", according to a statement. Ottawa insists the winner of the open competition must provide industrial benefits to Canadian firms. It also wants the companies to have a chance of getting work from the interim order with Boeing, Foote said. Boeing is committed to giving Canadian companies contracts that would equal the total amount Ottawa pays for the 18 Super Hornets, said Scott Day, spokesman at Boeing Defense. Foote said talks would start immediately with Boeing though a final decision would only be made once the discussions were over. Sajjan, though, said he was confident the Boeing plane met Canada's requirements. The government declined to answer any questions on cost, in particular whether the money set aside for the interim order would come out of the initial budget for the planes. Boeing's stock rose after the announcement and closed up 1.7 percent at $149.52, while Lockheed Martin shares pared gains to end the day at $264.66, up 0.5 percent.

      "text": "* A350-1000 to compete with Boeing's popular 777 * Airbus considers A350-2000 as Boeing goes bigger * FACTBOX on A350-1000 maiden flight: (Recasts after news briefings) By Tim Hepher and Johanna Decosse TOULOUSE, France, Nov 24 (Reuters) - Europe's largest twin-engined passenger jet, the Airbus A350-1000, took to the skies for the first time on Thursday, seeking to grab the spotlight from Boeing's popular 777. The lightweight carbon-fibre plane, 7 metres longer and able to carry 40 more people than A350s already in service, began a three-hour debut flight at 0942 GMT, watched by some of the airline bosses who have invested in the $356 million jet. The 366-seat A350-1000 is designed to break Boeing's virtual monopoly in the lucrative \"mini-jumbo\" segment, typically involving large twin-engined jets carrying 350 people. It is a larger cousin to the new-generation A350-900, which entered service last year. Both are built from similar advanced materials to Boeing's mid-sized 787 Dreamliner in a race between planemakers for fuel savings and better passenger comfort. The aircraft involved in Thursday's Toulouse debut is one of three test planes facing 1,600 hours of intensive flight testing before the A350-1000 enters service in the second half of 2017. Fabrice Bregier, chief executive of the planemaking division of Airbus Group, told Reuters he was confident the A350-1000 would be delivered on time to launch customer Qatar Airways. \"It makes me very happy and very proud. We are flying according to the timetable we had planned,\" he said moments after the jet, weighing 230 tonnes, took off under leaden skies to applause from factory workers. While the first flight of its latest model took place on time, Airbus is grappling with delivery delays to the earlier A350-900, clusters of which remain dotted around the airport in Toulouse, France, due to shortages of cabin equipment. Smaller A320neo jets are also parked with missing engines, due to delays in supplies from Pratt & Whitney, highlighting the strain on the industry of adding new technology while securing record production targets. Airbus programmes chief Didier Evrard said the planemaker continued to scrutinise its suppliers, notably France's Zodiac Aerospace, which said this week it was on a path to recovery following a production crisis at its factories. Asked about the progress displayed by cabin and other suppliers for the A350 family, Evrard told Reuters: \"It has improved, but it is not where it should be and we are watching them very carefully.\" He said the planemaker was working hard to achieve a target of 50 A350-900 deliveries for this year, having reached 34 so far, with a further plane due to be delivered later on Thursday. \"I have already cancelled my holidays,\" he added. Airbus says the A350-1000 will be 25 percent cheaper to operate than the competing Boeing 777-300ER, an older aircraft which weighs more but which has more seats in some layouts. Boeing has responded to the A350-1000 by developing an even larger version of 777 able to seat over 400 people, making it the largest twin-engined jet when it enters service in 2020. Airbus is also considering whether to go up in size with a further stretch of the A350, but senior marketing vice president Francois Caudron said it did not currently deem this necessary. Industry sources say Airbus is nonetheless offering the potential \"A350-2000\" to influential buyers including Singapore Airlines and British Airways. Such a jet would need an enhancement of the Rolls-Royce Trent XWB engine that powers the A350-1000, already one of the industry's largest with a fan case large enough to swallow the fuselage of the now defunct Concorde. Chris Young, programmes director at the embattled UK engine manufacturer, which is in the midst of restructuring, said it would always be ready if needed to upgrade its engines or add new ones according to the needs of airplane manufacturers.

      "text": "Airbus' new jewel in its crown and rival to Boeing's well-known 777, the Airbus A350-1000, took to the skies for its maiden flight today.\n\nEurope's largest twin-engined passenger jet took off this morning at Blagnac in Toulouse France (at 10.42am local time just in case you were wondering). Equipped with specially developed Rolls-Royce Trent XWB-97 turbofans, Airbus is not messing around.\n\nThe plane is seven metres longer than A350s in service and able to carry 40 more people.\n\n*Read more*: Airbus to bring operations tighter under its wing\n\nTo date 11 customers across five continents have placed overs for a total of 195 A350-1000s.\n\nThe aim of the game is for the 366 seater to break Boeing's hold in the lucrative mini-jet segment (typically involving large twin-engined jets that carry 350 people).\n\nThe aircraft involved in today's flight is one of three test planes facing 1,600 hours of intensive flight testing before the A350-1000 enters service in the second half of 2017.\n\n*Read more*: Serious Fraud Office opens criminal investigation into Airbus\n\nLast month, the European aerospace group reported a sharp fall of 21 per cent in quarterly earnings, pointing to supplier headaches and choppy helicopter sales as part of the problem. There have been troubles in the production of its popular long-range passenger jet, the A350.\n\nIn September, the firm announced a restructuring shake-up to merge divisions, simplify brands and get rid of the amount of bureaucracy.\n\nAirbus' plane and engine divisions were brought under one umbrella with Fabrice Bregier taking on the role of chief operating officer.\n\nThe month before it was announced that the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) had opened a criminal investigation into Airbus, probing allegations of fraud, bribery and corruption at the company. It's still ongoing and the SFO has said it can't comment on how long the investigation will take.",

      "text": "Boeing, Nok Air Partner for Humanitarian Aid Flight   \nBoeing (a DiversityInc Noteworthy Company ) is taking steps to operate its Defense, Space & Security business more efficiently through facilities consolidations and work movements that will increase employment in Los Angeles County, St. Louis, and Huntsville, Ala. \n“In order to push ourselves farther and win more business, we need to make the most of our resources and talent,” said Leanne Caret, president and CEO, Defense, Space & Security. “These steps will help us be a stronger partner for our customers worldwide.” \nBy the end of 2020 Boeing will reduce facilities space by approximately 4.5 million square feet. Along with that, many positions in Huntington Beach will move to El Segundo, Long Beach, and Seal Beach in Southern California, with others moving to St. Louis and Huntsville, Ala. \nSimilarly, many positions in Kent, Wash., will move to nearby Tukwila. Boeing also will close its El Paso, Texas, and Newington, Va., sites. \nWith the moves, Los Angeles County gains about 1,600 positions, with St. Louis gaining 500 and Huntsville about 400. \n“Making better use of our facilities will enhance efficiency and promote greater collaboration,” Caret said. “This will help drive our global growth in Boeing’s second century.” \nTo bolster that effort, Boeing Defence Australia, Boeing Defense Saudi Arabia, and Boeing Defence United Kingdom will be aligned and managed in a new global operations group led by David Pitchforth. He will also continue as managing director of Boeing Defence UK. While Pitchforth will report directly to Caret, those three organizations will continue operating independently. \nFor more information on Defense, Space & Security, visit www.boeing.com .

Boeing will deliver two of the fuel-efficient jets in 2018 and three more in 2019. Boeing said the sale hasn't been finalized and didn't disclose terms of the deal. The list price is $110 million for the 737 Max 8 model. The new jets will replace Fiji Airways' fleet of older 737 aircraft: four 787-800s and one 737-700. The…",

      "title": "Airbus completes first flight of A350-1000, challenger to Boeing’s twinjets",
      "text": "The largest version of the Airbus A350 widebody twinjet made its first flight Thursday in Toulouse, France, achieving an important milestone in the European planemanker’s strategic sales battle with Boeing. \nThe A350-1000, seating 366 passengers, is approximately the same size as Boeing’s best-selling current widebody, the 777-300ER, which typically seats 365 passengers. The new Airbus jet is an inch longer than Boeing’s, though the 777’s cabin is 9 inches wider. \nThe A350’s key advantage is that it’s a lighter, all-composite airplane with new engines, giving it longer range and higher fuel efficiency than the 777. That’s why new sales of the 777-300ER have plummeted. \nIn response, Boeing has launched the new, even larger 777X model, the first version of which is due to enter service in 2020 and will seat more than 400 passengers.\nMost Read Stories Mariners acquire shortstop Jean Segura and two other players from Diamondbacks for Taijuan Walker and Ketel Marte She’s pondering relocating to Canada for long-distance love | Dear Carolyn Thanksgiving, Apple Cup travel alert: ‘Parade of storms’ to bring rain, wind, mountain snow Lodge Sports Grille preps new locations as existing ones go into Chapter 11 bankruptcy Most expensive destroyer in Navy history breaks down Unlimited Digital Access. $1 for 4 weeks. Though both manufacturers are toying with the idea of even larger models of both jet families, the fact that Boeing has sold more than 800 of its 777-300ERs since 1990 suggests that the A350-1000 may be the right size to hit the sweet spot of the big twin-jet market.\nSo far, Airbus has booked 195 orders for the A350-1000.\nMeanwhile, the four-turbine Boeing 747 and Airbus’s own A380 superjumbo struggle to find buyers.\nZafar Khan, an analyst at Societe Generale in London, said the price of crude oil would need to drop “much lower” than $50 a barrel for four-engine planes to have a chance of a renaissance.\n“As long as fuel prices remain at elevated levels then two-engine jets willclearly prevail,” he said.\nBefore the advent of the so-called “big twin” aircraft, older two-engine wide-bodies such as the 767 and A330 were limited to medium-haul markets such as the north Atlantic, partly because of practical limits on how far they could fly in the event of one turbine failing. The 777 cast off those shackles by winning certification for flights as far as three hours from the nearest airport.\nThe standard A350-900 has U.S. Federal Aviation Administration approval for up to five hours or 2,000 nautical miles of diversionary flying on a single engine, making possible trips from Southeast Asia and Australia to the U.S. In a denser configuration the new -1000 will be able to carry 440 people, less than 100 short of the A380’s standard 525-passenger payload, though the double-decker could accommodate as many as 800 seats in a single class.\nThe airline industry’s appetite for bigger twin-engine planes was revealed when Airbus scrapped a shrunken A350-800 variant, which was deemed too small at 280 seats, and opted instead to upgrade the A330 for shorter routes.\nWith the A350-1000 attracting fewer than 200 orders, versus about 600 for the baseline -900, airlines appear to be holding out for something still bigger, though Francois Caudron, Airbus’s senior vice president for marketing, said in Toulouse it’s not yet ready to commit to a double-stretch of the plane, dubbed the A350-2000. The -1000 already addresses a sweet-spot in the market and is 20 tons lighter and 25 percent more fuel efficient than Boeing’s 777-300ER, he said.\nBoeing, though, is adding more seats to its best-selling wide-body, with new slimline berths taking the total to 396 while still retaining three classes.\nTwinjet capacity will increase still further from 2020, when the U.S. company introduces the 777X upgrade, the largest version of which will seat as many as 425 people in three classes. A bigger version is under consideration able to take upwards of 450 travelers, making it a true jumbo in its own right.\nAll told, the A350, 787 and 777 have unfilled orders totaling more than 1,950 planes, versus just 29 for the 747 and 121 for the A380. The four-engine Airbus A340, which emerged around the time of the 777, is already out of production.\nThe A350-1000’s debut flight means Airbus has met its goal of getting the model into the air before the end of 2016, with Qatar Airways Ltd. scheduled to be the first carrier to deploy the aircraft next year. The manufacturer is still racing to deliver the 50 A350-900s promised this year amid delays in the supply of interior fittings from suppliers including Paris-based Safran SA.\nDominic Gates: 206-464-2963 or dgates@seattletimes.com \nInformation from Bloomberg News is included in this report.

      "text": "Business News   \nEVERETT — The Boeing Co. is running out of time to hit its goal of getting roughly one new order for every airplane it delivers this year. \nThe company posted a slew of orders in October, but after taking out cancellations this year, Boeing has a net total of 462 orders as of Nov. 15. That is 62 percent of the more than 745 airplanes the company expects to deliver this year. \nAirplane orders have plummeted from just two years ago when Boeing posted a record 1,550 orders. Airlines went on a buying spree as their industry shook off the 2008 global recession, and now they are letting their credit cards cool off. \nBoeing executives say it is just the latest pause in an industry with a history of regular up-and-down cycles. This time around, though, the company and its chief rival, Airbus, have huge backlogs, allowing them to weather slowdowns in new orders. \nBoth companies are still bullish about demand over the next decade, and are ramping up overall airplane production. \n“Keep in mind we had a very strong month for our widebody airplanes in October , and we have several sales campaigns currently in work,” said Randy Tinseth, a vice president and head of marketing at Boeing Commercial Airplanes. \nMany analysts share Boeing’s view that demand for new airplanes will come back. That forecast is driven by expectations of sustained economic growth in Asian and Pacific markets, and the need to replace older aircraft in North America and Europe. \nSome analysts, though, say a big chunk of those orders were placed during the most recent order frenzy, and rising economies, such as China, are showing signs of slowing down. Under those conditions, they say, the industry can expect flat demand for the next few years. \nEither way, Boeing has plenty of work in its order backlog for more than 5,800 commercial airplanes. That is enough to keep its assembly lines busy well past 2020. \nBoeing’s deal with Iran, which wants to buy 80 airliners and lease another 29, could be undone by Republicans opposed to compromise with Tehran. On Thursday, the GOP-led U.S. House of Representatives voted 243-174 to block the sale , which was a carrot offered to Iran as part of its agreement with the U.S. and other world powers to curtail Iran’s nuclear program. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump railed against the agreement on the campaign trail as weak and a mistake. \nIf the deal is further delayed or falls through, Boeing is not rashly chasing orders. “There’s nothing that’s driving us with a sense of urgency that we have to hit a book-to-bill of one-to-one this year,” Boeing CEO and Chairman Dennis Muilenburg said at an investment conference in September. The company is “not going to do anything unusual to hit a book-to-bill target for the year.” \nThe politics of the Iran sale are secondary to the financial realities, said Richard Aboulafia, vice president of the Teal Group, a Washington, D.C.-area consulting firm. “Iran’s ability to pay for the jets and finance them has always been in question.” \nAcross the industry, it looks as if airlines are catching their collective breath after years of growth capped with a whirlwind rush of orders in 2012 through 2014, Aboulafia said. \nIn 2014, Boeing received 1,550 new orders — 1,432 net orders after subtracting cancellations that year. Last year, gross new orders dropped to 878 and net orders fell to 768. \n“This year is a pretty big harbinger of what the future looks like,” at least for the next few years, he said. \nBut if Boeing and Airbus, which is experiencing similar developments, get nearly as many new orders as airplanes they deliver during the next few years, “that would make for an amazing decade” for the industry, he said. \nDemand for big, twin-aisle jets has dropped significantly in recent years. From 2002 to 2011, orders for more profitable twin-aisle airplanes made up 34 percent of all Boeing’s orders. That number dropped to 20 percent of orders since 2012. \nThat shift almost certainly will pinch Boeing’s bottom line in coming years, as it churns out more less-profitable airplanes. \nSince 2012, Boeing has booked orders worth nearly $850 billion at current list prices. (Actual sales prices are considerably lower after contract negotiations.) While orders for twin-aisle jets made up one-fifth of orders, they are worth about $362.5 billion — nearly 43 percent of that total value. \nIndustry watchers expect orders for Boeing’s twin-aisle airplanes to rebound as its new 777X jetliner gets closer to first delivery, which is scheduled for 2020. \nEven so, as Boeing’s order book is increasingly dominated by less-profitable 737 work, “something’s gotta give,” Aboulafia said. \nIt is hard to see how Boeing can balance its current emphasis on rewarding shareholders under those conditions, he said. \nDan Catchpole: 425-339-3454; .Twitter: @dcatchpole .

      "text": "FarkIt \nWhat to make of the Liberal government’s decision to explore the purchase of 18 Boeing Super Hornet warplanes, as an interim measure until a permanent next-generation fighter can be found? As a stopgap, and if one ignores indications that military procurement is once again being treated as a political plaything, it may represent an acceptable compromise. But it smells an awful lot like the kind of behaviour for which the Liberals used to slam the Tories. \nAdding the 18 Super Hornets — a squadron of 12, plus spares — to the Air Force fleet makes sense in the short term. Canada’s current fleet of CF-18 Hornets, an older, less advanced version of the Super Hornet — is aging. Despite costly upgrades, there is only so much life that can be squeezed out of any aircraft. Attrition has reduced the fleet since the early 1980s. Canada now has only 48 of the jets routinely assigned to frontline squadrons, with a mission availability rate of roughly 70 per cent. \nGiven that reality, the arithmetic is simple — 48 jets times 70 per cent is 34, rounded up to the nearest jet. That’s not exactly an armada, especially considering the vastness of Canada’s landmass, its far-flung air approaches, and its commitments to NORAD and our NATO allies. Our 34 jets simply aren’t enough to go around, and that number will only dwindle further. \nThe fact that one cannot hold a fair and open competition with a major contender already excluded seems not to trouble the Liberal brass \nAcquiring the Super Hornets is a quick fix to this problem. The Super Hornets are fearsome aircraft, already in use as the carrier-borne attack aircraft of the United States Navy. Their general similarity to the CF-18s will make their introduction a reasonably straightforward affair. Given the challenging international outlook facing Canada and its allies, and the very real prospect of U.S. president-elect Donald Trump calling on allies that lag on defence spending — Canada very much included — to get serious about security, buying the jets makes sense. \nBut, and this is critical, it can serve only as a temporary measure. There is a very real danger that the purchase, if completed, will lull this government or a successor into believing that selecting a true replacement for the CF-18, and acquiring it in large numbers, is no longer an urgent national priority. It is. Eighteen Super Hornets buys the government time, but not much. And it shouldn’t pretend otherwise. \nPolitics, of course, plays a big role in this decision. The Liberals made two conflicting promises during the past election campaign, and have struggled to find a way to honour them both. On the one hand, they committed to holding a fair and open competition to determine Canada’s next warplane. But they also (bizarrely) pledged that the Lockheed F-35 Lightning, a jet developed with substantial Canadian participation, would not be purchased. The fact that one cannot hold a fair and open competition with a major contender already excluded seemed not to trouble the party brass, but has certainly proved an obstacle in government. There is much reasonable speculation suggesting the Liberals chose to proceed with an interim purchase simply to buy themselves time to escape this trap of their own making. Choosing the Super Hornet also suggests the Trudeau government is in the process of stacking the deck in favour of that jet in any future “fair and open”competition. \nThe Liberals are now apparently set on an expensive sole-source acquisition of a fighter jet. It was not long ago that they professed outrage at the Harper government’s plan to directly procure F-35 jets. One can fairly debate the merits of the Super Hornet compared to the F-35, but the Liberals can’t deny they are now trying to pass off a measure they once opposed. Yet another reminder, though none is required, of the danger of politicizing urgent military procurements. \nCanada needs an air force that is advanced enough to go toe to toe with any reasonable potential enemy, and, in line with the military maxim that quantity has a quality all its own, large enough to be meaningfully present everywhere it may be expected to go. The Liberals would not be in the position they’re in if the CF-18s had been replaced, by Liberals or Conservatives, in a smooth, efficient, orderly process. Responsible procurement of vital military equipment ought not to be an unattainable goal. And yet, under both major parties, it always has been. And, frustratingly, seems doomed to remain ever so. \nNational Post ",

      "text": "Airtrain - The uncontrollable airliner based off the Boeing 727 in GTA III , GTA Vice City , GTA Liberty City Stories and GTA Vice City Stories . FBI Car - The FBI car featured in GTA III and GTA Advance . It was similar to the Las Venturas police car , but had a different grille. The model was going to be featured in an unused cutscene. The model and a low quality texture still exist in the game and itcan be turned into a drivable vehicle via use of modifications. Fenton - Fenton is a beta vehicle that was scheduled to be in the final version of the game. It was cut for unknown reasons. It could've been be a cheap 4-door European compact car or a Luxury Executive sedan probably manufactured by Enus . This vehicle was also cut from Grand Theft Auto IV . Float - The Float was a beta vehicle that was cut from the final version of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas . Only its handling data exists. Its handling shows that would have been a slow vehicle, like a train or a parade float. Idaho - The 2-door coupe featured in all other 3D Universe GTA games. Rio - The cataraman sailboat featured in GTA Vice City and GTA Vice City Stories . Roller - Another new vehicle. Nothing is known about it but its handling. It appears to be either a roadroller or a rollerskates. A GXT entry for the Roller exists. Skateboard - A cut weapon in GTA: San Andreas but also a vehicle. It was cut during the development of the game and was planned to be introduced in the mission Madd Dogg's Rhymes . In the PS2 files, the HUD icon is the only remains. However, on the PC version it is a complete weapon that can only be found in one of the game's beta interiors. Nonetheless, the weapon will only appear if it is enabled in the game's files. If not enabled, it will be a Knife . The Stinger was supposed to return but was replaced by the ZR-350 . See Also",

      "text": "Business News   7:15am EST Turkey's Pegasus may postpone Boeing deliveries as costs weigh, CEO says The Boeing Company logo is projected on a wall at the ''What's Next?'' conference in Chicago, Illinois, U.S., October 4, 2016. REUTERS/Jim Young \nISTANBUL Turkish budget carrier Pegasus Airlines may postpone delivery of three new Boeing aircraft next year, lease some of its current fleet and sell older planes to cut costs after a difficult year for Turkish tourism, its chief executive said. \nPegasus ( PGSUS.IS ), which competes with national carrier Turkish Airlines ( THYAO.IS ), has been hit as widening security fears after a spate of bombings and a failed July coup dampened foreign tourist interest in Turkey. Meanwhile, the weakening lira currency has driven up fuel costs and other expenses. \n\"We were going to take delivery of five planes ordered from Boeing next year. Two of them will come but three of them we may take later,\" Mehmet Nane told Reuters in an interview late on Thursday. \nPegasus initially expected passenger growth of 13-15 percent this year, but in August slashed the target to 5-7 percent. Now, Nane said, it expects to beat the lowered forecast. \n\"Current developments show we will do better than our revisions,\" he said. \n(Reporting by Ceyda Caglayan; Writing by Daren Butler; Editing by David Dolan) Next In Business News",

REUTERS/Jim Young \nNovember 25, 2016 \nISTANBUL (Reuters) – Turkish budget carrier Pegasus Airlines may postpone delivery of three new Boeing aircraft next year, lease some of its current fleet and sell older planes to cut costs after a difficult year for Turkish tourism, its chief executive said. \nPegasus <PGSUS.IS>, which competes with national carrier Turkish Airlines <THYAO.IS>, has been hit as widening security fears after a spate of bombings and a failed July coup dampened foreign tourist interest in Turkey. Meanwhile, the weakening lira currency has driven up fuel costs and other expenses. \n“We were going to take delivery of five planes ordered from Boeing next year. Two of them will come but three of them we may take later,” Mehmet Nane told Reuters in an interview late on Thursday. \nPegasus initially expected passenger growth of 13-15 percent this year, but in August slashed the target to 5-7 percent. Now, Nane said, it expects to beat the lowered forecast. \n“Current developments show we will do better than our revisions,” he said. \n(Reporting by Ceyda Caglayan; Writing by Daren Butler; Editing by David Dolan)",

      "text": "Business News You must sign in or register to continue reading content. \nEVERETT — Everett Community College students studying how to operate and maintain increasingly automated and robotic factories could soon get workplace experience before graduating. \nCollege and other state officials are meeting with companies around the state to set up a paid-internship program. \nIn July, the state’s Center of Excellence for Aerospace and Advanced Materials Manufacturing , which supports workforce training programs, received a $4 million taxpayer-funded grant from the federal Department of Labor to create paid internships for low-income students learning how to keep increasingly complex and automated factories running. \nThe Boeing Co. has chipped in, too. It gave a $66,000 grant to cover some of the program’s set-up costs. The Center of Excellence announced the contribution Monday, but declined to say exactly how much the airplane maker gave. \nAmong other things, the money from Boeing will help pay for a database and web portal to match students and internships, and planning meetings with interested employers around Washington. \nThe new field of study — called mechatronics — combines traditional industrial subjects, such as hydraulics, mechanics and welding, with newer areas, such as robotics and programming. That mix of skills is in high demand in a wide range of industries in Washington, including aerospace, advanced manufacturing, food processing, and shipping and logistics. \nCompanies in the state posted 12,632 job openings in 2015 for mechatronics technicians, and that demand is expected to grow in coming years, according to the Center of Excellence, which is based at Everett Community College . \nThe college created its Advanced Manufacturing Training &Education Center in 2014 . Its mechatronics program began in September with room for 60 students. \nThe internships are open to low-income students at Everett, Renton, Shoreline, North Seattle and South Seattle community colleges. \nCenter of Excellence executive director Mary Kaye Bredeson said she hopes to fund more internships for more than 200 students over the next three years. \n“With a median salary of $60,940, increasing access to mechatronics-related internships can fast-track disadvantaged youth to a better quality of life while meeting workforce needs,” she said. \nDan Catchpole: 425-339-3454; .

      "text": "Defense Stock Roundup: Lockheed Martin Scores Big; Boeing, Textron, General Dynamics Make a Mark November 24, 2016, 08:58:00 AM EDT By Zacks Equity Research,   \nWith Donald Trump considering James Mattis as the new defense secretary, securities in the Aerospace and Defense sector scaled higher last week, buoyed by the reputation the retired U.S. Marine Corps General has in Capitol Hill. In addition to this, a generous flow of contracts from the Pentagon kept the sector on its toes. \nConsequently, major indices for the aerospace and defense sector ended in the green during the trailing five sessions. While the S&P 500 Aerospace & Defense (Industry) index gained 0.7%, the Dow Jones U.S. Aerospace & Defense Index rose 1.8% last week. \nAmong last week's highlights, Pentagon's largest defense contractor Lockheed Martin Corp. LMT stole the limelight with a handful of big wins. Defense majors like The Boeing Company BA , Textron Inc. TXT , Harris Corporation HRS , General Dynamics Corp . GD and United Technologies Corporation UTX also clinched a number of important contracts from the Pentagon. \n(Read Defense Stock Roundup for Nov 17, 2016 here .) \nRecap of the Week's Most Important Stories \n1. Lockheed Martin's Aeronautics business division secured a huge modification contract worth $7.19 billion for the F-35 Lightening II Joint Strike Fighter aircraft. The original advance acquisition contract involved low-rate initial production of the Lot 10 F-35 Lightening II jets. Work related to this deal is expected to be over by Mar 2020. \nPer the terms of the contract, Lockheed Martin will procure 90 jets, comprised 76 F-35As for the U.S. Air Force, non-U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) participants and Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers; 12 F-35Bs for the Marine Corps and non-U.S. DoD participants; and two F-35Cs for the Navy. Notably, Lockheed Martin's F-35 Lightning II is the fifth-generation, single-seat, single-engine fighter aircraft, equipped with an advanced stealth feature. Notably, it is the world's largest defense program. \nThe Aeronautics business division nabbed another contract, worth $1.2 billion for upgrading the Korean F-16 fighter jets. Work related to the deal is scheduled to be over by Nov 15, 2025. \nOriginally manufactured by General Dynamics, F-16 became part of Lockheed Martin after it acquired the former's aircraft manufacturing business. The combat-proven F-16 falcon is a multi-role fighter jet, which currently serves 28 nations. The latest and most advanced version - F-16V - is the fourth generation of the F-16 fleet, which comes with an advanced, high-resolution radar system. (Read more: Lockheed Martin Clinches $1.2B FMS Deal for Korea's F-16 ) \nMeanwhile, Lockheed Martin's Rotary and Mission Systems business division won a modification contact worth $77.2 million for upgrading the Aegis Combat System. Per the terms of the deal, as the Aegis Combat System Engineering Agent, Lockheed Martin will provide design, development, integration, test and delivery of computer program baselines and associated technology insertion hardware design support for future capability enhancements of the Aegis System. Work is scheduled to be over by Dec 2017. \nLockheed Martin's Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense (ABMD) is the naval component of the U.S. Missile Defense Agency's (MDA) Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS). It is the world's only maritime BMDS that can simultaneously attack land targets, submarines and surface ships. (Read more: Lockheed Martin Nabs $77M Deal for Aegis System Upgrade ) \n2. Bell-Boeing, a strategic joint venture (JV) between aircraft major Boeing and diversified U.S. conglomerate Textron's wholly owned subsidiary, Bell Helicopter - recently secured a modification contract worth $267.3 million. Per the terms of the deal, the JV will offer additional joint performance-based logistic support to the Marine Corps' MV-22, and the Air Force and Special Operations Command's CV-22 jets. Work related to the deal is scheduled to be over by Nov 2018. \nBell-Boeing's key product is V-22 Osprey, a joint service multirole combat aircraft that utilizes tiltrotor technology to combine the vertical performance of a helicopter with the speed and range of a fixed-wing aircraft. CV-22 and MV-22 are two variants of the V-22 jets. With rapid rise in terror attacks in recent times, Pentagon has been allocating substantial funds to the defense contractors for enhanced security of the country. With no improvement expected in the geopolitical situation at present, defense majors like Boeing and Textron, to name a few, are poised to gain substantially. (Read more: Bell-Boeing JV Wins $267M Navy Deal for CV-22, MV-22 Jets ) \n3. Another defense behemoth General Dynamics' Land Systems business division grabbed a foreign military sales (FMS) contract worth $65.3 million. Per the terms of this deal, General Dynamics will offer contractor logistic support and training services for Iraq's M1A1 tanks and M88A2 recovery vehicles. \nWork related to this agreement is scheduled to be over by Dec 31, 2017. The contract was awarded by the Army Contracting Command, Warren, MI, and will utilize fiscal 2010 other funds. \nAlso, its Electric Boat business division won a modification contract worth $47 million from the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C. Work associated with the deal will be over by Dec 2017. \nPer the terms of this contract, Electric Boat will perform non-nuclear submarine repair work on Groton-based submarines under the New England Manpower Initiative (NEMMI). The division will also continue providing skilled personnel to perform non-nuclear submarine repair work at the Naval Submarine Base, New London, CT, in support of returning mission ready submarines to the fleet. \n4. United Technologies' subsidiary, Pratt and Whitney has clinched a modification contract worth $93.2 million for F119 engine sustainment. Work related to this deal is scheduled to be over by Dec 31, 2017. \nPer the terms of this agreement, Pratt and Whitney will provide engine sustainment labor, data and combined test force operations and support. Notably, F119 is the most advanced, fifth-generation production engine that powers the Air Force's F-22 Raptor. This engine offer the F-22 supercruise - the ability to operate supersonically without afterburning, facilitating exceptional combat performance without compromising on mission range. \n5. Harris Corp. won a contract worth $91 million to support FMS Advanced Integrated Defensive Electronic Warfare Suite (AIDEWS) customers' production requirements. Work related to this deal will be over by Nov 18, 2019. \nThis contract will aid the production of the AN/ALQ-211(V)4/8/9 AIDEWS systems, software, and associated support equipment for Electronic Combat International Security Assistance Program customers. Notably, Harris Corp.'s AIDEWS is a modular electronic warfare system compatible with a wide range of fighter aircraft. AIDEWS can be tailored to meet unique customer requirements related to integrated radar warning and RF countermeasures, and advanced stand-alone radar warning. \nPerformance \nThe major defense stocks have put up a strong performance over the past five trading sessions, with all of them witnessing impressive gains. L-3 Communications Holdings, Inc. LLL was the biggest gainer, with the stock improving 3.35%, followed by Boeing. \nOver the past six months too, major the stocks in this sector delivered a stellar performance. Notably, Textron gained the most with its stock rallying 19.6%, followed by General Dynamics. \nThe following table shows the price movement of the major defense players over the past five trading days and during the last six months.

      "text": "The Forgotten American Concordes - Boeing 2707 - Lockheed L-2000 SST Advertisement From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Boeing 2707 Three view of a Boeing 2707-300 Role Supersonic transport Manufacturer Boeing Commercial Airplanes Status Canceled The Boeing 2707 was the first American supersonic transport (SST) project. After winning a competition for a government-funded contract to build an American SST, Boeing began development at its facilities in Seattle, Washington. The design emerged as a large aircraft with seating for 250 to 300 passengers and cruise speeds of approximately Mach 3. It would have been much larger and faster than preceding SST designs such as Concorde. The SST was the topic of considerable concern within and outside the aviation industry. From the start, the airline industry had noted that the economics of the design were questionable, concerns that were only partially addressed during development. Outside the field, the entire SST concept was the subject of considerable negative press, centered on the issue of sonic booms and effects on the ozone layer. A key design feature of the 2707 was its use of a swing wing configuration. During development the required weight and size of this mechanism continued to grow, forcing the team to start over using a conventional delta wing. Rising costs and the lack of a clear market led to its cancellation in 1971 before two prototypes had been completed. ... From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Lockheed L-2000 Full-scale mockup of the L-2000-7 design Role Supersonic transport Manufacturer Lockheed Corporation Status Cancelled The Lockheed L-2000 was Lockheed Corporation's entry in a government-funded competition to build the United States' first supersonic transport (SST) in the 1960s. The L-2000 lost the contract to the Boeing 2707, but that competing design was ultimately cancelled for political, environmental and economic reasons. In 1961, President John F. Kennedy committed the government to subsidizing 75% of the development of a commercial airliner to compete with the Anglo-French Concorde then under development. The director of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Najeeb Halaby, elected to improve upon the Concorde's design rather than compete head-to-head with it. The SST, which might have represented a significant advance over the Concorde, was intended to carry 250 passengers (a large number at the time, more than twice as many as Concorde), fly at Mach 2.7-3.0, and have a range of 4,000 mi (7,400 km). The program was launched on June 5, 1963, and the FAA estimated that by 1990 there would be a market for 500 SSTs. Boeing, Lockheed, and North American officially responded. North American's design was soon rejected, but the Boeing and Lockheed designs were selected for further study. ...  ",

The Boeing Company logo is projected on a wall at the \"What's Next?\" conference in Chicago \nBy Ceyda Caglayan \nISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkish budget carrier Pegasus Airlines may postpone delivery of three new Boeing (NYSE: BA ) aircraft next year, lease some of its current fleet and sell older planes to cut costs after a difficult year for tourism, its chief executive said. \nPegasus (IS: PGSUS ), which competes with national carrier Turkish Airlines (IS: THYAO ), has increased passenger numbers more slowly than planned this year as series of bombings, a failed coup in July and tension with Russia deterred tourists. A weak lira currency has driven up fuel costs and other expenses. \n\"We were going to take delivery of five planes ordered from Boeing next year. Two of them will come but three of them we may take later,\" Mehmet Nane told Reuters in an interview late on Thursday. \nPegasus initially expected passenger growth of 13-15 percent this year, then cut that target in August to 5-7 percent. Now, Nane said: \"Current developments show we will do better than our revisions.\" He did not elaborate. \nThe airline has been cutting costs by closing some less popular routes, he said. It is also leasing out two of its aircraft, complete with crew, maintenance and insurance - known in the airline industry as \"wet lease\". \n\"If our planes are empty, why not?\" Nane said when asked if more lease deals were possible. Pegasus has a fleet of 77 aircraft, which is set to rise to 82 by year-end, not including next year's Boeing deliveries. \nPegasus plans to sell off older, less fuel-efficient planes as new ones arrive, Nane said. He does not expect the fleet to shrink overall. \nTOURISM SLUMP \nThe number of tourists visiting Turkey slumped 32 percent to 20.3 million people in the first nine months of the year. Relations with Russia, traditionally a major source of tourism, soured after Turkey shot down a Russian warplane over Syria last year. \nRival Turkish Airlines has also been hurt, postponing delivery of a total 39 aircraft from Airbus and Boeing due to arrive between 2018 and 2022. \nAnkara has worked to restore relations with Russia and Nane said he was optimistic that 2017 would be a better year. Pegasus was waiting for regulatory approval for 40 new routes and could open them as soon as it gets permission, he said. \n\"The majority of routes will be international. The new flights will be not just from Istanbul but Ankara, Izmir and Antalya too,\" he said. Turkey's Pegasus may postpone Boeing deliveries as costs weigh, CEO says ",
