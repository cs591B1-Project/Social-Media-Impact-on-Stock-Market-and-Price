      "text": "News \nThe Nest store has some pretty sweet offers for its portfolio of products for Black Friday weekend. The Nest indoor camera is available at the very compelling price of just $149. Well, sorry if you already bought one, because Amazon just dropped the price on two different Nest camera models to the lowest level we've seen yet (Maybe you can still cancel your order?). \nThe Nest indoor camera is currently on sale for $127.49 and the outdoor model is also discounted to $169.99. Those are both excellent prices for connected cameras of this quality and could be the best deals we see on them all year. In fact, the indoor models price is so good that, as of now, it is back-ordered. The good news is that it is still available to purchase as long as you are OK waiting a bit longer to receive it than the accustomed 2-day Amazon delivery. \nWith prices this good, both products may go OOS soon, so don't delay if you want to pick up one, or both of these devices while they are on sale. I think I might grab an indoor camera to use as a baby monitor. If any of you readers have used one for that purpose I'd love to hear how well it works in the comments below. \nHere are the links, you know what to do with them.",

      "text": "Amazon Devices \nAmazon Echo, $140 — Amazon's signature Alexa voice-control device gets a $40 discount for the time being. We're also guessing that Cyber Monday will feature a lot of Alexa-only deals. Grab your Echo now so you'll be ready for those deals by Monday. \nEcho Dot, $40 — Add Alexa voice control to a room of your house for $10 off right now. At $40, this personal assistant makes for a great gift for that person on your list that you aren't quite sure what to get. \nAmazon Tap, $90 — Tap — a smaller, more portable version of Echo — is under $100. \nFire HD 8 Tablet, $60 — One of the best tablet deals out there is as affordable as it'll ever be, at 16 GB of storage. If you want 32 GB, you'll add $30. \nFire Tablet, $33.33 — The entry-level Fire tablet is also down to \"ridiculously cheap\" levels right now. \nKindle Paperwhite, $100 — Paperwhite is probably the best bang for your buck if you're a bookworm, and you can knock $20 off of it right now. \nKindle E-reader, $50 — Amazon's signature e-reader is just $50 in its base form. \nFire Kids Edition, $75 — This kid-friendly bundle comes with a Fire tablet loaded with kids apps, books and movies plus a heavy-duty case to keep it safe. \nAmazon Fire TV, $75 — Amazon's Fire TV keeps getting more powerful. Now you can stream 4K Ultra HD picture quality along with all of your streaming services. \nFitbits — Fitbit's Cyber Monday deals are live, and some of the prices are actually lower than they were on Black Friday. The bare-bones Flex is down another $10 to $59 , the powerful Charge 2 is holding steady at $129 , the stylish Alta is $15 cheaper at $84 and the Blaze smartwatch drops another $22 from Black Friday down to $127 . \nWe aren't sure how long these prices will last, so go ahead and pull the trigger now if you're looking for Fitbits. \nXbox One S 500GB Console, Minecraft Bundle, $212 — The kids will love you when they open this Xbox One bundle. Your wallet will love you when it pays just $212 for it. You can also grab a 1TB Xbox One - Battlefield bundle for $255. Both of these prices you won't see until checkout. \nPlayStation 4 Pro, 1 TB, $340 — If you're a Playstation family, you can pick up a powerful 1TB PlayStation Pro — on the high end of the PlayStation spectrum — for $340 right now (Note: you'll see the discount at checkout). This is the only PlayStation deal we're seeing right now, but will update right here if that changes. \nPlayStation 4 DualShock 4 Wireless Controller $34 — If your kids want to play their video games with their friends PlayStation 4 controllers are both $34 right now, a five-dollar drop-off from Black Friday prices. Xbox One controllers are out of stock right now , but we'll update right here as soon as they're back up. \nAnker PowerCore 20100, Ultra High Capacity Power Bank, $28 — This powerful battery pack from Anker will give you about five to seven full charges on your smartphone depending on the model. Anker's smaller model that will give you just one full charge is $12. \nVIZIO Sound Bars — Vizio's popular sound bars are extremely easy to use and can instantly add theater-level sound to your living room or bonus room. Right now, you can pick up a 38-inch model for $212 or the 40-inch for $297. \nBlue Snowball iCE Condenser Microphone, $40 — We've used Blue's Snowball microphone for podcasting and basic recording needs and couldn't be happier. At $40 right now, it's a no-brainer for anyone who needs to do any sort of voice capturing. The more powerful Blue Yeti is still going for $90 , as it was on Black Friday. Home and Kitchen \nZinus Memory Foam 12 Inch Green Tea Mattress, $128-$262 — Add a comfy memory foam mattress to your home for the holidays right now with this deal from Zinus. It can be unnerving ordering a mattress online, but these have 4.5 stars from more than 3,000 notoriously hard-to-please Amazon reviewers. It'll also show up at your front door in two days if you have Amazon Prime. \nJust note that this is good for Sunday only and will be gone on Cyber Monday. \nRowenta DW5080 Focus 1700-Watt Micro Steam Iron, $47 — Amazon's best-selling steam iron is marked down more than 50 percent. Note: This deal is only good Sunday. \nHoover FH50150 Carpet Basics Power Scrub, $80 — Hoover's Power Scrub can clean your carpets and furniture in one fell swoop and is just $80 right now, an incredible price for this highly rated machine. You can also add pet stain remover for just $14 more. \nNest Learning Thermostat, 3rd Generation, $200 — Pick up Nest's signature smart thermostat, which can work with Alexa, for $50 off right now. \nEcobee3 Thermostat with Sensor, $199 — Ecobee's smart thermostat has many of the same features as Nest, with one difference: It comes with a sensor that sits in the middle of the room for a better temperature reading. And it will talk to your new Echo or Echo Dot . \nInstant Pot IP-LUX50 6-in-1 Programmable Pressure Cooker, $54 — There's never been a better time to buy Instant Pot's mega-popular pressure cooker. At $54, it's now $4 cheaper than it was even on Black Friday and at the lowest price we've ever seen for it. \nOral-B Pro 5000 SmartSeries Power Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush, $60 — Oral-B's popular electric toothbrush is marked down four dollars cheaper than on Black Friday down to just $60, a killer deal for this rechargeable brush that uses Bluetooth to track your brushing habits. Just be sure to click the green \"clip coupon\" button before you checkout. \nUp To 75 Percent Off Coats — Winter is coming. Gear up and browse through this Gold Box Deal full of coats for men, women and kids. \nNinja Coffee Bar Single-Serve System, $110 — Coffee-lovers will love this single-serve coffee machine that comes with a frother and five different brewing options. \nNinja Coffee Bar Brewer, $130 — Alternatively, this brewer bundle comes with an 18oz. tumbler, Glass frother, 40-recipe cookbook, permanent filter, five paper filters, scoop, and a 43-oz. carafe. \nCanon Office and Business MX922 All-in-one Printer, $70 — Add this reliable, mobile-abled printer to your office for $70 right now. \nAll prices and savings are as of publication and could change, and Patch may earn a commission on some purchased items.

With free shipping , that's tied with our expired mention from three days ago (which required padding to trigger the Visa Checkout discount) as the best deal we've seen since Black Friday 2015.

      "text": "Don't Miss: Amazon Cyber Monday 2016 Deals \n\"Liver cancer is on the rise worldwide, and in human studies we have now seen that patients can progress from fatty liver disease to liver cancer without any middle steps such as cirrhosis,\" said lead author David Moore, Professor at Baylor College of Medicine in the US. \nThe study found that chronically jet-lagged mice developed liver cancer in a very similar way as that described for obese humans. \nWhen we constantly travel through different time zones, work night shifts, or push ourselves to stay awake at the regular sleep time, our central circadian clock in the brain becomes chronically disrupted, the researchers said. \n\"We think most people would be surprised to hear that chronic jet lag was sufficient to induce liver cancer,\" Moore added. \nIn the study, the researchers changed the times the lights went on and off during the night each week to understand the effects of chronic jet lag in normal mice who were fed a healthy diet. \nThey found that the mice gained weight and fat, and developed fatty liver disease, which progressed to chronic inflammation and eventually liver cancer in some cases. \nThe jetlagged mice lost normal control of liver metabolism. This included not only the buildup of fat, but also increased production of bile acids -- acids produced by the liver to help us digest our food -- linked with liver cancer. \nFurther, the jetlagged mice were also lacking in receptors -- called FXR and CAR -- that help regulate liver bile acid metabolism, which works in a similar manner in humans. \nAlthough the researchers did not directly study jetlag in humans. But as evidence have showed that sleep disruption increases both fatty liver disease and liver cancer risk in humans, they hypothesised that lifestyle changes that generate chronic jet lag can also disrupt the body's internal homeostasis and increase liver cancer risk in humans. \nThe study appears in the journal Cancer Cell. \n ",

      "title": "Amazon Reviewers Take On Donald Trump Holiday Ornament — And Other Trump Products",
      "text": "\nIt seems nobody is taking Donald Trump’s holiday ornament, a brass cap with gold trim and Trump’s ‘Make America Great Again’ logo emblazoned on the front, very seriously. Released this week in the Trump shop for $149 , the item is being offered for resale on Amazon at prices over $200, and while it’s not clear if anyone is actually buying it there, Amazon shoppers are definitely reviewing it.\n[Image via Amazon ] It’s pretty clear that most of the reviews aren’t being posted by Donald Trump’s biggest fans. They make reference to things like Trump’s apparent support from KKK members, and the disparity between the popular and the electoral vote.\nCame with an entire crate of white hood ornaments. Great bargain! Downside: My tree is now on fire.\nThis year it was between this ornament and another one that is less flashy, less gaudy, and just overall nicer. During our family meeting we overwhelmingly chose the other ornament but somehow we still ended up with this one. We’re not sure what happened.\nAnother one-star review refers to Trump’s promises to deport undocumented immigrants.\nThe only Christmas ornament that will try to deport your nativity scene.\nOthers make reference to the surfaced recording in which Trump appears to brag about sexually assaulting women — generally making use of the fact that the slang term Trump used in the recording is also used for cats.\nI actually ordered the bright blue “Pantsuit Ornament,” but this is what i got instead. After several days of paralyzing shock and disappointment, some friends intervened and told me i should “make the best of it” and hang the ornament on the Christmas tree anyway. So i did. Unfortunately, within minutes the ornament’s tiny mango-hued hands began reaching out to grab my two cats as they walked by.\nIt’s not just the official Make America Great Again holiday ornament though — reveiwers have been having fun on other Trump merchandise as well.\nThe Donald Trump coffee mug, for instance, with removable toupee lid, has been reviewed by buyers who say it has an ’empty head’ or that they ‘filled it with nuts.’\n[Image by Amazon ] If it’s been part of the criticism of Trump this election year, you can bet on it turning up in some of the reviews. For instance, the coffee mug has been the subject of jokes about the President Elect’s apparently changed stances on such topics as ‘ going after ‘ Hillary Clinton, and building a border wall .\nDoesn’t hold water. More like a mirage…. Great from far but once you buy it, doesn’t work as promised!\n…found coffee filters on the shelf above last night and I found conical white hats atop many of my coffee mugs this morning. \nOn another Donald Trump holiday ornament (unlike the Make America Great Again cap, this is not an official product from the President Elect himself), reviewers warn that the ornament will make your tree lean so far to the right it snaps in half, waterboard the Joseph and Mary nativity ornament, and that it will get rid of your ‘non-white’ ornaments.\nThen, of course, like on the other Trump products, there are the reviews poking milder fun at his style of speech.\nThis ornament is fantastic. It’s wonderful, really. I’ve had so many, many wonderful Christmas trees. Beautiful Christmas trees. The most beautiful Christmas trees in the entire world. I know how to find great Christmas trees. I do. Some of the most Christmasy, wintery, Christmas trees, believe me.\nEven a Donald Trump novelty mask isn’t skipped by reviewers with a laugh in mind.\nScares children and minorities as advertised.\nAs for the Donald Trump holiday ornament, the Make America Great Again cap does have positive reviews and ratings, some touting positives points like collector’s value and possible future spikes in the value of gold, and others calling out detractors as crybabies and losers. However, there aren’t enough to balance the humorous and negative reviews — as of this writing, the Donald Trump holiday ornament has only a 1.5-star average rating.\n[Featured Image by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images]\nAmazon Reviewers Take On Donald Trump Holiday Ornament — And Other Trump Products is an article from: The Inquisitr News \n",

      "title": "Cloud compute pricing bakeoff: Google vs. AWS vs. Microsoft Azure - ZDNet",
      "text": "| Topic: Cloud \nWith Amazon Web Services hosting its annual powwow this week talk about the price for performance and agility equation will be everywhere. Special Feature Cloud Computing: Moving to IaaS \nInfrastructure as a Service providers make a very compelling argument for businesses to stop running their own data centers and simply purchase server capacity on-demand and scale up and down as needed. This is our deep dive on IaaS strategy and best practices Read More \nKnowing AWS' re:Invent conference is kicking off this week, the largest cloud service provider has been busy cutting prices for various instances. Rest assured that Google and Microsoft are likely to toss in their own price cuts as AWS speaks to its base. \nBut the cloud pricing equation is getting complicated for compute instances. Not so shockingly, these price discussions have to include discounts. Like everything in enterprise technology there's the street price and your price. Comparing the cloud providers on pricing is tricky given Microsoft, Google and AWS all have different approaches to discounts. \nAlso: IaaS: What you need to know about pricing, options, best practices | Eight questions to ask before choosing an IaaS vendor | IaaS checklist: Best practices for picking an IaaS vendor \nFortunately, RightScale on Monday will outline a study on cloud compute prices. Generally speaking AWS won't be your cheapest option for compute. AWS typically lands in the middle between Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. \nThe bottom line is that AWS uses reserved instances in 1-year and 3-year terms to offer discounts. Microsoft requires an enterprise agreement for its Azure discounts. Google has sustained usage discounts that are relatively easy to follow. \nOverall, RightScale found that Google will be cheapest in most scenarios because sustained usage discounts are automatically applied. Among the key takeaways: If you need solid state drive performance instead of attached storage Google will charge you a premium. Azure matches or beats AWS for on-demand pricing consistently. AWS won't be the cheapest alternative in many scenarios. Then again AWS has a bigger menu, more advanced cloud services and the customer base where it doesn't have to go crazy on pricing. AWS just has to be fair. Your results will vary based on the level of your Microsoft enterprise agreement and what reserved instances were purchased on AWS. \nHere are three slides to ponder from RightScale. \nAdd it up and you'd be advised to make your own comparisons, check out RightScale's SlideShare and then crunch some numbers. In the end, enterprises may have to have all three cloud providers in their company--if only to play them off each other. ZDNet Monday Morning Opener \nThe Monday Morning Opener is our opening salvo for the week in tech. Since we run a global site, this editorial publishes on Monday at 8:00am AEST in Sydney, Australia, which is 6:00pm Eastern Time on Sunday in the US. It is written by a member of ZDNet's global editorial board, which is comprised of our lead editors across Asia, Australia, Europe, and the US. \nPreviously on Monday Morning Opener :",

Or maybe you want to help a friend or family member do so? What about just providing them with more incentive to stay active? Or, you know, they could already have an activity tracker that is getting a bit long in the tooth. Now's a good time to jump on the Fitbit bandwagon as there are deals for different models all over the web. \nI've been wearing Fitbits for almost 4 years now, so I am a bit partial toward the brand. I love the social aspect, I love gamifying activities by just trying to surpass my own performance each time, and I love using it to entice myself to move a little bit more than I would have each day. I've already reviewed the Blaze and Charge 2 if you want to check those out for a more informed opinion, and my Flex 2 review should be out next week. \nBack to the deals now. You'll find a lot of them on Fitbit's own store , but the better discounts are on Amazon. \nLooks like Amazon dropped prices for many Fitbit products by another 15%. See the new prices below.

      "text": "News \nDid you pick up a new smartphone or tablet this Black Friday? If so, you may want to check out the deals that Amazon is running on some Anker products today as part of their Deal of the Day program. \nFirst up, the Anker Astro E1 , a 5200mAh portable battery. That may not sound like much, but it's good for between 1.5 and 2 full charges of a typical smartphone at 2A speeds. For $11.99 (about $4 cheaper than usual), you can't argue too much with the small capacity, as the small form factor is part of this battery's appeal anyway. \nLooking for a larger battery? The Anker PowerCore 20100 , which has an easily guessed 20,100mAh capacity, may be more up your alley. This thing, with its two 2.4A ports, can charge the average smartphone between 6 and 8 times. Its $27.99 price is around $12 cheaper than usual, which makes it great bang for the buck. \nIf you'd rather have a quick charger, you may want to consider the poorly named \" Anker Quick Charge 3.0 39W Dual USB Wall Charger, PowerPort Speed 2 .\" This charger features two ports capable of Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0 speeds, which will allow you to charge your shiny new smartphone as fast as humanly possible. The sale price of $19.99 is about $8 lower than usual. \nAs of this article's publishing, these deals will expire in around 7 hours, so don't wait too long if you're interested. Source:",

(Source: Amazon/YouTube) \n(WTVM) – Online retailer Amazon hopes to bring a little joy to the world after what some would call a rough year with its new holiday advertisement. \nIn the ad, which looks to bridge the gap between religions, a priest invites an imam over for a cup of tea and meaningful conversation. \nWhen both friends go to sit down and stand up, you can see the physical struggle of age as both clench their knees and grimace in pain \nAs the imam leaves the priests’ home, both grab their phones and place an order on the Amazon app. \nDays later, both men receive a package from Amazon as they find out that each bought each other knee braces. \nBoth men put on their gift and can kneel for prayer pain-free. \nClick here to watch the advertisement from Amazon , which has gotten over 1 million views on YouTube. \nCopyright 2016 WTVM .
