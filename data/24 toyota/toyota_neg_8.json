Auto Show 2016: Toyota CH-R Toyota CH-R subcompact crossover Toyota CH-R subcompact crossover Toyota CH-R subcompact crossover (Toyota) Russ Mitchell started the subcompact crossover trend in 2009 with the Soul. Since then, this submarket has proved one of the fastest growing categories in the hot crossover market.\nToyota (like Ford,with its EcoSport) is jumping in late. “I’ve been a little shocked at the lack of offering on the subcompact SUV side” from both companies, said Karl Bauer, analyst at Kelley Blue Book. The vehicles “appeal to such a wide range of people: those who don’t have a lot of money to spend and want to save on gas, but also want room to carry around people and cargo with a high SUV ride.” \nToyota’s more sedate but more refined compact crossover, the Rav-4, is highly popular. With the CH-R, Toyota offers a smaller, cheaper, edgy-looking option. What’s new \nThe look, which will provoke lovers and haters. Toyota’s marketing team describes the CH-R’s design as a “Distinctive Diamond … matchless, sexy, muscular and edgy.” \nToyota deputy chief engineer Hiro Koba, a race car enthusiast, said the suspension system was designed for a sporty ride. Where you put your stuff Toyota Where you put your stuff Where you put your stuff (Toyota) The competition \nThe choices are many. The most direct competitor in the freaky-funky design category is the Nissan Juke . \nThe Juke employs a 188 horsepower four-cylinder turbo to blast from zero to 60 in 6.9 seconds. (The CH-R comes in at 144 horsepower; zero to 60 time not yet made public.) \nThe Kia Soul maintains a boxy sort of funk with less power but still draws good reviews. \nThe Mazda CX-3 looks like a grown-up compared with the CH-R and the Juke. It’s no speedster, but a smooth powertrain, a tight fit and finish, and sport tuned suspension have won many fans. The details \n2.8-liter, four-cylinder, double-overhead cam, 16-valve engine. 144 horsepower at 6,100 rpm. Fuel economy to be determined, and no stats offered on cargo space.

      "title": "2018 Toyota C-HR is the Scion that should have been",
      "text": "By : Jeff Perez , Editor Toyota's edgy new C-HR small crossover makes its debut in L.A. With the death of Scion (RIP), Toyota needed to make a change to its growing lineup. The tC and xB would go the way of the dodo, while the iA and iM would be rebadged and rebranded. But most importantly, the C-HR CUV concept we saw at last year’s Los Angeles Auto Show would now find a forever home under its parent marque. After much anticipation, the production-version of that car is finally here – and it looks great. Making its U.S. debut at the 2016 L.A. Auto Show, the 2018 C-HR – which stands for “Coupe – High Rider” – shares a number of cues with the original concept. Most notably the flared fenders and the sleek front end. What it loses from concept to production, though, it makes up for in usability. Riding on the Toyota New Global Architecture , it shares its bones with the new Prius, and can be configured in either front-, rear-, or all-wheel drive. Specifically, the C-HR uses the former and the latter (though we wish a rear-wheel-drive option was available). Available in XLE and XLE Premium at launch, the trims will come with features like 18-inch alloys, sport bucket seats, and a seven-inch audio display. Power comes courtesy of a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine paired to a CVT, pumping out a respectable 144 horsepower (107 kilowatts) and 140 pound-feet (189 Newton-meters) of torque. Though no fuel economy figures have been given, the engine utilizes Variable Valve Timing, which is said to enhance fuel economy and overall operation. Eventually we'll see a hybrid version added to the lineup. At 171.2-inches (4,348-millimeters) long, 70.7-inches (1,795-millimeters) wide, and 61.6-inches (1,564-millimeters) tall, it balloons past the Nissan Juke – but only slightly – and sits underneath the larger Rav4 . The enhanced exterior gives way to a more spacious interior, which includes a set of rear seats that fold flat, and what Toyota calls a driver-centric “MeZone.” Soft-touch features and sports car influence gives the C-HR a more premium feel. Featuring Toyota's Safety Sense technology, systems like pre-collision warning, pedestrian detection, lane departure warning, and forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking come standard. Opt for the XLE Premium trim, and that also includes blind spot monitoring with rear cross traffic alert. The C-HR is expected to go on sale early in 2017. No word on U.S. pricing, but the C-HR starts at £26,495 ($32,960) in the U.K. for front-wheel drive, and increases to £27,995 ($34,830) with the all-wheel-drive option ticked.

Of course, the C-HR was always planned to sell as a Toyota in other markets, such as Europe (where that market’s production version was shown in Geneva early this year). Look, just because the lifted-coupe thing hasn’t been cool to us since “Eagle” was an American Motors brand doesn’t mean that other folks don’t find it impossibly hip. Just ask the Germans. If the Japanese want to ape some of that perceived Teutonic snap, who are we to discourage them from making a vehicle with a name that stands for “Coupe High Rider”? READ MORE ›› \n- ",

Slotting below the RAV-4 and set to take on the likes of the Mazda CX-3 and Honda HR-V, the C-HR is essentially the same car as the one sold in the rest of the world. Well, make that almost the same, as in the US it will be solely available with a naturally aspirated 2.0-liter four with 144 HP mated to a CVT transmission driving the front wheels. So, no 1.2 turbo or hybrid for this side of the pond, at least for now. Developing story",

      "text": "It looks like the first hydrogen fuel-cell vehicle from Lexus will be faster than previously advertised , but it will get to the market slower than expected. It's all part of the paradox involved with Toyota looking to broaden its fuel-cell technology beyond the Mirai . Either way, the first Lexus fuel-cell vehicle is slated to start sales by the end of the decade , said Auto Express , citing comments from Alain Uyttenhoven, head of Lexus Europe.\n\nUyttenhoven noted that it'd take an SUV to provide enough space to accommodate the packaging for the Lexus fuel cell powertrain. That comment may imply that the hydrogen-fueled powertrain from Lexus will offer similar performance to that of the Lexus RX450h hybrid SUV . That model delivers 300 horsepower and boasts a 0 to 60 mile-per-hour time of about seven seconds.\n\nSuch a mill would be a departure from what we'd previously reported on Toyota's plans to expand its fuel-cell technology to its Lexus luxury badge. With Toyota believed to be planning to unveil as many as three fuel-cell models in time for the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, the Japanese automaker said early last year that it may have a Lexus fuel-cell vehicle available as soon as 2017, while reports suggesting the model would be a Lexus LS-based sedan.\n\nAdditionally, the Mirai's fuel-cell powertrain had been believed to be the platform for the proposed Lexus fuel cell from the moment that model started sales in California last year . Apparently, though, the Mirai's 152-horsepower powertrain, coupled with a full-tank range that would be about 20 percent less than the 300-mile Mirai, isn't up to snuff for Lexus duty.",

      "text": "Toyota has no plans to leave behind the funky crossover segment, even though Scion is now closed. Enter the 2018 C-HR, which debuted in US-spec Thursday at the Los Angeles auto show .\n\nWe've seen the styling many times before, thanks to multiple concepts and more recently the production-ready variant at the 2016 Geneva Motor Show . The interior also remains the same as seen before, with the dashboard and controls slightly angled toward the driver.\n\nWhile other parts of the world will have two engines choices to choose from – a 1.2-liter turbocharged unit and a hybrid model with a 1.8-liter four-cylinder motor – the vehicle will be sold, at least in the beginning, with a 2.0-liter four-cylinder in the US. The engine is matched to an all-new CVT and sends 144 horsepower and 140 pound-feet of torque to the front wheels. On paper, the C-HR lines up with the Honda HR-V and Mazda CX-3 .\n\nThe C-HR hits dealerships next spring and will come in XLE and XLE Premium trims. Standard features on the XLE include a leather steering wheel, heated mirrors, dual-zone climate control, and an auto-dimming rear-view mirror. The XLE Premium adds heated front seats, blind-spot monitor, puddle lamps on the side mirrors that project \" Toyota C-HR\" onto the ground, and more. The CUV , regardless of trim, comes with a seven-inch touchscreen display and the automaker's Toyota Safety Sense P, which boasts radar cruise control, pedestrian detection, lane departure warning, and more, as standard.",

      "text": "TOKYO -- A week after conceding it needs electric vehicles, longtime EV-skeptic Toyota Motor Corp. said it is forming a streamlined “in-house venture company” next month to start developing battery-powered eco-cars in a speedy, innovative way.\nThe new unit will consist of just four people -- each from a separate Toyota Group company -- in a bid to accelerate decision-making and get the cars to market faster.\n“As a venture company that will specialize in its field and embrace speed in its approach to work, it is my hope that it will serve as a pulling force for innovation,” Toyota CEO Akio Toyoda said in a release today announcing the new task force, which begins work in December.\nOne member of the group will come from Toyota Motor. The others will come from Toyota Industries Corp., Aisin Seiki Co. and Denso Corp., parent company Toyota Motor said.\n“Its small organizational structure is meant to enable it to implement unconventional work processes, leading to accelerated project progress and, thus, fast-to-market products,” the company said.\nToyota emphasized that it remains committed to developing a range of alternative powertrain technologies, including hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, which it called the “ultimate eco-car.”\nBut echoing comments made the previous week by Chief Financial Officer Takahiko Ijichi, Toyota's announcement said the world's largest automaker -- which doesn't have a single electric car in its lineup nor a publicized timeline for introducing one -- must react to changing regulations.\n“Differing energy and infrastructure issues around the world and the rapid strengthening of regulations aimed at increasing the use of zero-emission vehicles have heightened the need for product lineups that can respond to various situations,” Toyota said.\nThe streamlined EV venture company, Toyota said, will allow the carmaker to “commercialize EVs at an early stage, as an alternative means of achieving zero emissions.”\nToyota did not give a timeline for launching an EV.\nThe announcement follows a report in Japan's Nikkei newspaper that said Toyota was planning jump into mass production of long-range EVs by 2020. Toyota will set up a team next year to develop EVs that can travel more than 300km (186 miles) on a single charge and sell them in Japan and in other markets that promote EVs, such as California and China, it said.\nToyota signaled earlier this year it was prepared to shift gears.\nOn the eve of the Beijing auto show, Hiroji Onishi, head of Toyota's China operations, said China's fuel economy regulations will make it tougher for the company to reach its China sales goal of 2 million vehicles by around 2025. The rules are forcing Toyota to deviate from its product strategy centered around conventional hybrids, which don't qualify for China's new energy vehicle (NEV) credits.\nTo comply, the company eventually will have to introduce an EV there, Onishi said.\nVolkswagen Group said today it aims to boost NEV sales in China to 400,000 units a year by 2020 and increase that to 1.5 million NEVs annually by 2025.\nToyota pulled the plug on its EV program in 2014, when it said it was ending a two-year deal to build electric Toyota RAV4 crossovers with Tesla Motors Inc. It said the same year it would end deliveries of its eQ, a battery-driven minicar based on the Scion iQ three-seater.\nToyota joined hands with Tesla, it said at the time, so that the bureaucratic Japanese giant might glean some of the California carmaker's entrepreneurial spirit and fast, flexible mindset.\nYou can reach Hans Greimel at hgreimel@crain.com . -- Follow Hans on",

      "text": "Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends \nThe 2018 Toyota C-HR took a long and convoluted route to its U.S. debut at the 2016 Los Angeles Auto Show this week. It debuted as a concept car just over two years ago, and was originally supposed to be sold here under Toyota’s now-defunct Scion “youth” brand . Now that it’s finally here, is the C-HR worth the wait? \nC-HR stands for “Coupe High-Rider,” although this subcompact crossover does have four doors. Toyota tried to camouflage the rear pair by shrinking the rear window, and making a big crease that almost separates the rear wheels from the rest of the body. It’s all part of a fairly extroverted design that also includes slim headlights, protruding taillights, and a low, sloping roofline. It’s Toyota latest attempt to shake its reputation for boring cars. \nMore: Ford’s EcoSport SUV makes its North American debut \nUnderneath the wildly creased sheet metal, the C-HR rides on the same Toyota New Global Architecture platform used by the Prius hybrid . As with the Prius, Toyota tried to imbue the C-HR with sporty handling characteristics. It even took the little crossover to the Nürburgring, the infamous German racetrack that’s become a measuring stick for high performance cars. \nThe C-HR is far from the most powerful car to show up at the Nürburgring, though. In the U.S., the only available engine will be a 2.0-liter four-cylinder, with 144 horsepower and 140 pound-feet of torque. A continuously variable transmission (CVT) will be mandatory as well. Toyota did include a Sport mode that allows manual shifting with seven simulated gears (because CVTs are fearless), and sharpens throttle response. \nToyota says the interior was designed around a “MeZONE” theme that emphasizes the driver. The 7.0-inch central display screen, for example, is positioned on top of the dashboard rather than in it because, Toyota claims, it requires less eye movement from the driver. All C-HR models also come standard with Toyota Safety Sense P , a bundle of safety systems including autonomous emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, lane departure alert with steering assist, and automatic high beams. \nThe 2018 Toyota C-HR goes on sale in the U.S. next spring, with pricing to be announced closer to the launch date.",

      "text": "Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends \nToyota is shifting position on all-electric cars. Toyota Motor Corporation has formed a small, in-house group to fast-track electric car development, as reported by Reuters . \nThe new unit, which launches in December, will be responsible for electric car development and marketing strategy and will draw on other corporate resources. Starting with four people, the team will pull in engineers, designers, and any other needed personnel. \nMore: Will Toyota change course and build a mass-market electric car? \nToyota spokesperson Itsuki Kurosu said, “Regulations on lower emissions vehicles are changing very quickly, so we also have to respond quickly. With its small size, the new venture will be able to be more nimble in its planning and decision making, to speed up the process to develop electric cars.” \nThe initial four team members will come from Toyota itself and three other Toyota group entities, including machine manufacturer Toyota Industries Corporation and parts suppliers Aisin Seiki Company and Denso Corporation. \nConsistent with its earlier pledge that all Toyota vehicles will be emissions-free by 2050, the company is now preparing to move forward with full-sized all-electric vehicles. Previously Toyota’s focus has been on hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles (FCVs). Earlier this month, however, the company said it was considering coming to market with all-electric cars. Japan’s largest automaker had also said before that it would continue its success with hybrids because of their greater range and because of the high price of batteries and the long charging times for all-electric vehicles. \nCompetitors Nissan and Volkswagen have been committed to all-electric cars as the best option for zero-emissions vehicles going forward. While Toyota has been working on short-distance, ultra-compact electric vehicles, it has stayed away from all-electrics. With yesterday’s announcement, however, the corporate focus has shifted. Part of that decision may have been influenced by positive market pressure for electric cars and by the long timeline for FCVs. \n“The company’s position is changing,” CASA analyst Chris Richter said, “They still talk about hybrids and fuel cells but I think there is a recognition that battery electric cars are getting a lot of traction right now. It’s going to take an awful long time before fuel cells are a competitive alternative to electric vehicles. In the meantime, a lot of things are going on right now (with battery electric cars) and they need to be there.” Also watch: Superformance Ford GT40 MkII Review",

      "title": "2018 Toyota C-HR [US]",
      "text": "Toyota C-HR [US] ( 2018 ) Toyota C-HR [US] \nAn exciting next chapter in Toyota's storied North American product history has been revealed under the lights of the Los Angeles Convention Center. Stylish, athletic, and tech-filled, the all-new 2018 Toyota C-HR - or, Coupe High-Rider - represents a leap forward in design, manufacturing, and engineering for Toyota. When it arrives at dealerships in spring 2017, the C-HR will serve as a solid springboard of excitement, adventure, and pride for its fashion-forward, trendsetting owners. \nAt the 2016 Los Angeles Auto Show, Scion debuted its stunning C-HR Concept. That well-received design study set the stage for the Toyota C-HR, which, nearly to the tee, carries on the concept's avant-garde physique; modern, comfortable cabin; and bold, outgoing character. \nThe Toyota C-HR will be available in two grades at launch, XLE and XLE Premium, each equipped with a long list of standard premium features that includes 18-inch alloy wheels, dual-zone climate control, supportive bucket seating, 7-inch audio display, and Toyota Safety Sense P™ (TSS-P). \nBut, the Toyota C-HR doesn't only look great - it's got the sportiness to impress thanks to Deputy Chief Engineer, Hiro Koba, who is a diehard racer at heart. He and his team made it their mission to ensure the C-HR exhilarates its driver anytime, anywhere. Like its uncanny looks, the C-HR's comprehensive and cohesive blend of comfort, control, consistency, and responsiveness that was cultivated on the famed Nürburgring is as impressive as it is unique. 2018 Toyota C-HR [US] \nPOLISHED DIAMOND STYLE \nToyota's team of global designers expounded on one theme: \"Distinctive Diamond.\" The iconic gemstone evokes universal notions of luxury, attractiveness, sophistication, and strength. Designers translated these traits into a physical form that's collectively matchless, sexy, muscular, and edgy. From the get-go, they strived to sculpt an urban-dwelling crossover that would effortlessly navigate tight city streets and stand out, with an agile, dynamic expressiveness. \nAt the Toyota C-HR's nose, two slim projector-beam halogen headlights with LED daytime running lights wrap deep into its toned shoulders - nearly all the way into the front quarter panels. Because of this, the vehicle looks wider than it is, and possesses an assertive fascia that's uncommon in the segment. \nDeep, curvy character lines emerge from a prominent Toyota badge that's flanked by the headlamps, and lead into the narrower core body. They run below the slender windows, and continue above the rear wheel where they marry to a high beltline and distinctive C-Pillar with integrated door handle. \nLook closely at the silhouette to see the clear resemblance of a diamond set on its side. Powerful arches housing the extra-large 18-inch aluminum wheels accentuate the C-HR's sturdy posture and compact cabin. \nThe rear is a cohesive melding of its elaborate lines and 3D shapes. The tail lamps protrude outward, and the hatchback - outfitted with a lip spoiler and functional top wing - tapers neatly inboard, adding to the C-HR's futuristic look, and, once more, surprising girth. \nCUTTING-EDGE CABIN \nOpening a door reveals a modern, spacious, and uncluttered interior having a keen placement of diamond accents and a driver-centric \"MeZONE\" orientation. Along with the soft-touch materials covering surfaces throughout, the diamond pattern influences the designs of the dual-zone climate controls, speaker surrounds, and black headliner above the front passengers. \nThe slightly angled dashboard and amenity controls allows for the driver to have a clear view of the road ahead and intuitive access to instrumentation - a nod to the C-HR's sports car influence. The 7-inch audio display is positioned centrally atop the dash, rather than in it, so as to help reduce a driver's eye movements. An informative twin-ring gauge cluster resides behind the leather-wrapped multi-function steering wheel. The wheel, with its slender profile, small diameter, and compact center pad, is reminiscent of a sports car's easy-to-grip helm. The satin-plated shift knob exudes a high-quality feeling, and once in-hand, has a solid shift movement. A bright 4.2-inch color Multi-Information Display sits between the twin-ring cluster. \nKey XLE standard features include a premium leather steering wheel; power fold and heated mirrors; auto-dimming rearview mirror with backup camera; electric parking brake; and dual-zone climate control. The XLE Premium builds upon the XLE's amenities and adds Blind Spot Monitor and Rear Cross Traffic Alert; heated front seats; power lumbar driver's seat; auto fold, heated side mirrors with puddle lamps that project \"Toyota C-HR\"; fog lamps; and Smart Key with Push Button Start. Both grades are equipped with a 7-inch touchscreen display having AM/FM/HD Radio™, Aha™app, USB port and AUX jack, Bluetooth®, and Voice Recognition with voice training. \nBolstered bucket seats help keep passengers snug and comfortable, no matter their commute's duration or dynamism. All passengers will appreciate the generous amount of small item storage space and cup holders. Designers used scalloped seatbacks, foot well cubbies carved below the front seats, and a chamfered headliner to create a spacious backseat environment. Sound insulating materials placed on the carpet, headliner, A-pillars, and door trim to help keep all unwanted noises out and the good conversations in. For extra cargo carrying versatility on weekend trips or errand runs, the rear 60/40 seat can split and fold flat. \nSURPRISE ATHLETE \nThe Toyota C-HR scores high on style points, but it is also a hit when it comes to thrilling fun and impressive comfort. Deputy Chief Engineer Koba took full advantage of the C-HR's adaptable Toyota New Global Architecture (TNGA) to craft an engaging character that goes well beyond just a cool appearance. The Toyota C-HR's core driving personality incorporates the ingredients of a well-sorted sports car - one that seamlessly melds cunning responsiveness, linearity, consistency, and comfort. \nYears were spent developing the C-HR's driving performance and ride quality on some of the world's most curvaceous and challenging roads, including the Nürburgring Nordschleife, an iconic racing circuit. Doing so took a mix of innovation, creativity, and trial and error. As a result, the TNGA platform - with an inherent low center-of-gravity, high strength, and low weight - benefitted from extra rigidity through added spot welding, gussets, braces, and adhesives in and on key connection structures. \nThe newly developed MacPherson strut front suspension with SACHS dampers has angled strut bearings and a large diameter stabilizer bar to help the C-HR's front end respond quickly and precisely at initial corner turn-in. And at the rear, an all-new double-wishbone suspension utilizes SACHS shock absorbers with urethane upper supports - a first for Toyota. The material, together with an aluminum-cast upper support housing, aids in the dampers' absorption efficiency, and therefore, greatly benefit passenger comfort, cabin quietness, and vehicle agility. \nFeeling connected to the road is characteristic of a sporty drive, and the C-HR delivers with its column-type Electronic Power Steering (EPS) system. As is the case with other EPS systems, a tilt of the steering wheel will return light feedback at low speeds, and at higher speeds, drivers will notice stronger feedback for increased confidence while behind the wheel. The Toyota C-HR's steering system's feel, however, relies on a highly rigid rack-and-pinion steering gearbox that is installed directly to the front suspension. \nFor all of its sportiness, the C-HR's ride quality is well-sorted, civilized, and highly capable in absorbing the nastiest of unkempt pavement. The end result is a C-HR that finds itself as at home on congested boulevards as it does on serpentine roads. \nCOMPACT PUNCH \nThe C-HR's engine, a punchy 2.0-liter four-cylinder producing 144 horsepower and 140 pound-feet of torque, sends all power to the front wheels via continuously variable transmission (CVT). The engine employs many of Toyota's latest generation of technologies, including Variable Valve Timing (VVT) and Valvematic, both of which have received extensive optimization to enhance fuel economy and smooth operation. Valvematic offers a broader range of continuously variable valve timing (lift and phasing) to provide optimal intake valve (not on exhaust side) operation relative to engine demands. Furthermore, to reduce exhaust emissions, the catalyst is warmed earlier during the engine's ignition cycle. \nThe all-new CVT received much attention by engineers, and utilizes redesigned pulleys to enhance acceleration and fuel economy; a new belt structure to reduce cabin noise; and, a world's-first coaxial two-port oil pump system that allows for continuous oil pressure modifications in various driving conditions. A Preload Differential helps to distribute torque between the left and right wheels during low-speed operation to make for easier, composed driving. \nOf course, drivers and passengers will appreciate the powertrain's fuel efficiency, impressive smoothness, and quiet operation, but they'll love Sport mode and the simulated 7-speed Sequential Shiftmatic. Engaging the Sport mode via the MID increases the responsiveness of the throttle, quickens the CVT's automatic artificial \"step-up\" shifts, and maintains high engine speed to enhance acceleration. The EPS' feedback is weightier for a more confidence-inspiring feel. Pushing the gearshift over to the left while in Drive engages Sequential Shiftmatic, and lets drivers shift simulated gears at their convenience. \nSTATE-OF-THE-ART SAFETY \nNo matter its grade, the Toyota C-HR comes equipped with standard Toyota Safety Sense P™ (TSS-P). This multi-feature advanced active safety suite bundles cutting-edge active safety technologies including Pre-Collision System with Pedestrian Detection function (PCS w/PD) featuring forward collision warning and Automatic Emergency Braking, Lane Departure Alert with Steering Assist function (LDA w/SA), Automatic High Beams (AHB), and Full-Speed Dynamic Radar Cruise Control (DRCC). The Toyota C-HR is the only competitor in the segment to offer standard Full-Speed DRCC. \nComplementing TSS-P are 10 standard airbags, standard Hill-Start Assist Control (HAC) and rear backup camera, as well as available Blind Spot Monitor with Rear Cross Traffic Alert, which are only available on the XLE Premium grade.",

      "title": "2017 Toyota C-HR",
      "text": "Toyota C-HR ( 2017 ) Toyota C-HR \nDesigned to stand out both within the Toyota line-up and in its segment, the all-new Toyota C-HR - or Coupe High-Rider - represents Akio Toyoda's determination to allow greater stylistic freedom and promote engineering creativity in order to achieve eye-catching designs and enhanced driving pleasure. \nThe Toyota C-HR remains remarkably true to the general features of the concept-cars that attracted so much public attention in Paris in 2014 and in Frankfurt in 2015. Its coupe-like lines are a testimony to the resolve of its designers to create a style that stands out in the Toyota range, and to establish a new direction amongst mid-sized crossovers. \nWith the Toyota C-HR, Toyota targets a clear and singular customer profile. Predominantly driven by emotional considerations, these customers want individuality, and to be the first to try new experiences and products. Style and quality are essential considerations in any purchase they make, and the car is an extension of their personality. \nInspired by what he learned from meeting with these customers, C-HR Chief Engineer Hiroyuki Koba focused persistently on their requirements throughout the development process, setting high demands for design and perceived quality. \nThe Toyota C-HR's unique character demonstrates the flexibility that the TNGA (Toyota New Global Architecture) gives to vehicle developers in the three key areas of design, powertrain and dynamics, enabling them to deliver a new and fresh take on the increasingly commoditized crossover segment. 2017 Toyota C-HR \nA NEW DESIGN DIRECTION FOR THE CROSSOVER SEGMENT \nThe all-new Toyota C-HR introduces a distinctive styling that brings newfound dynamism and sensuality to the crossover market, combining a coupe-like upper body with the powerful underpinnings of an SUV. \n4,360 mm long, 1,795 mm wide, 1,555 mm high (Hybrid) and with a 2,640 mm wheelbase, the production vehicle remains remarkably true to the concept car's exterior which was first shown at the Paris Motorshow in 2014, and which registered extremely well with target customers. \nUnder the concept of \"Sensual Speed-Cross\", and featuring a diamond architectural theme with wheel arches projecting prominently at all four corners to emphasise the new crossover's strength and rigidity, the C-HR modulated structure combines a powerful lower body and raised ground clearance with the slim and sleek cabin profile of a coupe. \nViewed from any angle, the C-HR's combination of facetted gemstone-like shapes with fluid surfaces and elegantly integrated detailing create a delicate balance of precision and sensuality. \nThe front represents a further development of Toyota's Under Priority and Keen Look design identity. The slender upper grille flows from the Toyota badge into the sleek, aggressive wing extremities of the headlamp clusters and wraps fully around the front corners of the vehicle. \nThe movement of the blacked out rocker panel towards the front and rear wheels, along with the shoulder axis that runs through to the front and rear, emphasise the fast-looking, 'lift-up' feel of the thin body. \nThe Toyota C-HR's coupe-like styling is further enhanced by disguised rear door handles integrated within the C pillar and, essential to the representation of speed within the design, the powerful projection of the sweeping roofline into a large, highly aerodynamic, skeletal frame rear spoiler. \nTo the rear, the strongly tapered cabin integrates a top-hinged tailgate giving access to the loadspace that can accommodate luggage for 5 people. This contrasts with the pronounced flaring of the wheel arches, which give the new crossover a wide and extremely powerful stance. \nStanding proud of the tapering body work, prominent rear light clusters may also be equipped with LED lamp technology to give the rear view of the C-HR an equally expressive visual signature. \nSOPHISTICATED INTERIOR DESIGN WITH OUTSTANDING SENSORY QUALITY \nA new departure for Toyota, the interior styling represents a new 'Sensual Tech' design concept combining high-tech functionality with a sensual and fashionable style. It embodies a driver focused area within an airy, expansive cabin space. \nThe warm, welcoming ambiance of an airy, expansive cabin space was created by the seamless layered architecture of the instrument panel that continues through to the door trim with a stylish ornamentation and a piano black panel. It offers a contrast between sensual surfacing and crisp lines to deliver a fresh, yet comfortable environment. \nThe driver oriented area incorporates innovative details and intuitive, approachable high technology. All operating switchgear, and an 8\" display audio touch-screen featuring a redesigned and improved HMI (Human Machine Interface) with Toyota's Multimedia '16 navigation platform and enhanced connected services are slightly oriented towards the driver. \nIn conjunction with the asymmetrical centre console design, this brings all controls within easy reach of the driver, whilst still allowing front passenger access to the relevant switchgear. \nBecause the touch-screen stands proud of the instrument panel rather than being enclosed by it, the upper dashboard is considerably lower in depth, further helping driver visibility. \nA unique new two-tiered front seat design combines a slender, sporting upper section with a more strongly bolstered and supportive lower area, these differences emphasised through the use of differing tones, textures and patterns within the upholstery. \nTargeting class-leading sensory quality (SQ), and knowing that C-HR customers will also have competitors from premium brands on their shopping list, the C-HR interior represents the earliest involvement yet of Toyota's European SQ team in the design process. \nWorking closely with the headquarters design team to maintain the original interior styling concept, the SQ team have focused painstakingly on component quality, and the consistency of grain, texture, shape, colour and illumination in every element, even the stitch groove radii of the seats. \nReinforcing the link between interior and exterior design, many switches use a similar shape, reflecting the diamond motif of the exterior body shell. The same diamond theme is also visible in the door trim pattern, the headliner, the JBL speaker grilles and tweeter shape, and even the needles of the driver's analogue instrument dials. \nA carefully considered choice of finishes is essential to the harmonious, consistent, one-piece look of the new interior. There are three main surface finishes - leather-like for all background surfaces, a smooth Nappa grain for all touching surfaces and technical grain for all functional elements such as switchgear. \nDecorative elements are finished in high quality piano black and satin silver trim, and the clear blue instrument and switchgear illumination has been carefully fine-tuned to ensure consistency of hue, even on adjacent reflective surfaces of differing colours. \nThis outstanding new interior design is available in a choice of three colour schemes: Dark Grey, Black/Blue and Black/Brown. \nEQUIPMENT LEVELS TO SUIT THE MOST DEMANDING CUSTOMERS \nReflecting the demands of its target customer, the Toyota C-HR can be equipped with a wide variety of features. \nAs part of Toyota's commitment to democratise advanced safety equipment, Toyota Safety Sense is standard across the range. The system includes a Pre-Collision System (including Pedestrian Recognition), Adaptive Cruise Control, Lane Departure Alert with steering control, Automatic High Beam and Road Sign Assist. \nTop-of-the-range customers will be able to specify heated seats, a smart entry system, privacy glass, bespoke upholstery including part-leather seats, Toyota's revolutionary S-IPA system (Simple Intelligent Park Assist), 18\" alloy wheels and Bi-tone metallic paintwork. \nTOYOTA SAFETY SENSE \nToyota Safety Sense helps to reduce the risk of a collision and delivers additional benefits by making life easier for the driver and reducing fatigue. \nPre-Collision system \nAt speed ranges of between 10 km/h and the vehicle's top speed this system uses a front-mounted monocular camera sensor and millimeter-wave radar sensor to detect vehicles and pedestrians on the road ahead. If it calculates a risk of a collision, it automatically warns the driver with a buzzer and alert in the multi-information display. At the same time the Pre-Collision Brake Assist engages to provide extra braking force the moment the brake pedal is pressed. If the system determines that the possibility of a frontal collision with a vehicle or pedestrian is extremely high, the brakes are automatically applied to help avoid the collision or help reduce the impact of the collision. \nToyota's improvement of the technology has enabled it to recognize and react to the presence of pedestrians as well as vehicles and to function across a wider range of speeds. \nAdaptive Cruise Control \nThe Toyota C-HR's Adaptive Cruise Control with Full Speed Range Following Function makes use of the same millimeter-wave radar as the Pre-Collision system to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle ahead, slowing the car to a standstill if necessary and accelerating smoothly back to the pre-selected cruising speed once the way is clear. \nLane Departure Alert \nLane Departure Alert uses the camera on the windscreen to track the vehicle's course between lane markings painted on the road surface. If it judges that the Toyota C-HR is about to move out of its lane without the turn indicator being used, the system sounds a buzzer and lights up a warning on the multi-information display. If the vehicle is still moving outside the lane, it will apply light steering force to assist the driver to bring the vehicle back on course. \nAutomatic High Beam \nAutomatic High Beam uses the same windscreen-mounted camera as the Lane Departure Alert. This recognizes the lights of oncoming vehicles or traffic ahead, automatically switching the headlights to low beam to avoid dazzling other road users and returning them to high beam as soon as the road is clear, maximizing night-time illumination and the driver's field of vision. \nRoad Sign Assist \nRoad Sign Assist uses the front camera to recognize principal highway/motorway warning and command signs. These are then repeated on the multi-information display, reducing the risk of the driver not being aware of speed limits, lane closures and other important information. \nAdvanced safety and driver assistance systems \nThe Toyota C-HR is available with additional systems that support safer driving by giving the driver better real-time information about the area immediately around the car, including a Blind Spot Monitor and Rear Cross Traffic Alert. \nThe Blind Spot Monitor uses radar sensors mounted on the rear corners of the vehicle to detect nearby vehicles in adjacent lanes as they move into the driver's blind spot. The driver is alerted to their presence by LED warning indicators in the door mirror on the appropriate side of the car. The LED indicators will remain illuminated as long as the vehicle remains in the blind spot. If the driver operates the turn indicators, intending to move into path of the vehicle, the LEDs will flash rapidly to draw further attention to the hazard. \nThe same radars are used to provide the Rear Cross Traffic Alert, monitoring approaching traffic from either side as the vehicle is reversed out of a parking space and warning the driver if any vehicles are detected. \nSimple Intelligent Parking Assist system \nThe Toyota C-HR offers Toyota's new Simple Intelligent Parking Assist (S-IPA) system, which uses an array of sensors to identify viable parking spaces and surrounding objects. Improvements to the technology allow it to work in parking spaces up to 22 per cent smaller than previously. \nThe driver stops the car next to the parking space and pushes a single button to engage S-IPA, which guides the car to the correct position for reverse maneuvering into the space. This system was developed to utilize the corner sensors for the parking assist. \nCONCERT HALL SOUND \nRecognizing the importance that the Toyota C-HR target customer attaches to the quality of the in-car entertainment system, the car can be equipped with a tailor-made JBL premium audio system comprising an 8-channel, 576 Watt stereo amplifier and 9-speakers, including two newly patented acoustic JBL wave guides, known as horn tweeters. It provides the ultimate sound reproduction in the C-crossover segment. \nBecause various elements of the interior such as the windows and upholstery, as well as the rigidity of the body structure surrounding each speaker, can have a significant impact on system sound quality, the system is the result of particularly close collaboration between JBL and Toyota's engineers from early in the design process. \nAn in-depth customer analysis was taken into account for the system design and resulted in the orientation of the speaker layout and the use of a precisely integrated, A pillar-mounted horn tweeter -a JBL system signature- to deliver crisp, clear sound. \nAs well the two 25 mm horn tweeters and acoustic wave guides, the system further features two 80 mm wide-dispersion units and two 17 cm sub-woofers in the front of the Toyota C-HR, and, in the rear, two 15 cm full-range speakers and a 19 cm sub-woofer in a dedicated, 10-litre, ported enclosure in the boot. \nAvailable in combination with the navigation option, the JBL premium audio system also incorporates lossless audio encoding. \nThe partnership between Toyota and JBL started in 1996 and has been successfully expanded since that time. Trusted by music professionals, JBL audio systems are used in major concert halls, venues and stadiums throughout the world (80% of live concerts, 70% of all recording studios and 90% of all THX-certified movie theatres). \nQuality is the common focus of both companies, which has resulted in the all-new, uncompromised premium audio system specifically tailored for the C-HR. \nSTATE OF THE ART POWERTRAINS \nThe Toyota C-HR is equipped with an engine-range that is designed to deliver exactly the fluent, engaging driving behaviour that its customers are looking for. This is most powerfully expressed by the segment-unique, range-topping, full hybrid version, the intrinsic characteristics of which guarantee a smooth, jolt-free ride. \nFitted with the latest-generation hybrid power plant, the Toyota C-HR generates CO2 emissions as low as 82 g/km - a figure unrivalled within its segment - and returns combined fuel consumption of only 3.6 l/100 km. \nDelivering 90 kW/122 DIN hp, this new hybrid powertrain is not only more efficient and lighter than the previous system, but also offers sharper performance. Detailed design changes to the engine have resulted in a thermal efficiency of 40% - a world-beating performance for a petrol unit. \nOther hybrid system components have been made lighter and smaller, and have been repositioned for optimum packaging, further contributing to the car's low centre of gravity. \nThis new hybrid powertrain offers the response and the fluidity of a dynamic driving style that particularly suits the Toyota C-HR's dynamic design philosophy. \nThe Toyota C-HR is also available with a new 1.2 litre turbo engine, which debuted in the Auris. Delivering 85 kW/116 DIN hp and 185 Nm of torque, this unit generates CO2 emission from 125 g/km and returns combined fuel consumption from 5.5 l/100 km. It may be mated to either a 6-speed manual gearbox or a Continuously Variable Transmission. CVT equipped versions are available with either front- or all-wheel drive. \nAnd finally, a 2-litre 144 DIN hp/107 kW, 188 Nm CVT-only model will be available for certain markets (Ukraine and Caucasus). \nNEW HYBRID SYSTEM \nThe Toyota C-HR is equipped with the new generation of Toyota's signature hybrid powertrain. \nToyota has focused its efforts on making this next generation of hybrids even easier and more intuitive to drive. The system has been set up so that it gives a natural, immediate, but smooth response to any accelerator pedal input. Refined and confident, it delivers the right level of performance. \nBut of course, fuel economy has been improved as well, as demonstrated in new Toyota C-HR's combined cycle economy starting from just 3.6 l/100 km. The new hybrid system comes in a more compact package that is lighter in weight and lower in cost. It reflects significant advances in battery, electric motor and petrol engine technologies. \nThe new hybrid battery offers higher energy density. Whilst its total power was maintained, its size could be reduced by 10%. And what's more, it can now absorb 28% more energy in the same amount of time, which means that it charges faster than before. The electric motors are smaller in size, yet also provide a better power-to-weight ratio. And the thermal efficiency of the petrol engine reaches more than 40 per cent, a world's best for a petrol unit. \nImproved petrol engine \nThe Toyota C-HR's hybrid system features a 1.8-litre VVT-i Atkinson cycle petrol engine. Compared to the third generation Prius, the unit has been completely re-engineered to deliver significantly better fuel economy. The gas flow, combustion, cooling and knock control have all been improved and much more effective use is made of exhaust gas recirculation. \nToyota has developed a heat recovery system that uses spent exhaust gas to speed the warming up of engine coolant. This means fuel can be saved because the hybrid system is able to stop the engine earlier and more often when it isn't needed to power the vehicle. The engine is also helped to reach its optimum operating temperature more quickly thanks to a new dual-passage cooling system that can reduce the volume of coolant flowing into the engine, when required. This helps improving efficiency during cold weather. \nFurther work has been done to reduce energy losses, particularly through eliminating friction. Measures include the use of thin-section, resin-coated connecting rod bearings and a low-friction camshaft chain. Friction created by the piston skirts, rotating parts and oil pump has been reduced and a new electric water pump has helped cut the level of losses. \nConical \"beehive\"-type springs have been adopted to reduce the valvetrain load. And, to ensure comprehensive improvement, the entire engine underwent CAE analysis to achieve the best rigidity and to reduce noise and vibration. \nThe intake and exhaust systems came under particular scrutiny, resulting in an engine that enjoys better breathing, air filtration, packaging efficiency, reliability and quietness. The air filter has been made smaller and reduced in height, which helped the designers bring down the line of the hood. The new intake system has a resonator that creates less noise at noticeable frequencies and the intake duct is made of a porous material that suppresses resonance. \nA fresh air inlet duct has been added to make sure ample air volume is obtained at motorway speeds and a clever air/fluid separating structure has been added to keep water and snow from mixing with the intake air. Should the fresh air duct fill with water or snow, a secondary inlet serves as the air intake. \nA thinner silencer secures optimum performance and noise reduction, while also improving the underbody aerodynamics and avoiding any intrusion on the space available in the trunk. \nThe engine block has V-shaped drilled paths that reduce losses in water jacket pressure. There is also a new water jacket spacer which helps control cylinder wall temperatures in the combustion chamber, reducing friction and preventing engine knock, which in turn supports optimum ignition timing. \nEngine cooling has been improved with a new cooling module structure and attachment, and a redesign that accommodates a lower hood line and helps reduce the car's centre of gravity. There is a new grille shutter behind the radiator which automatically closes when full airflow isn't required, improving aerodynamic performance and saving fuel. \nWhile engine cooling helps improve anti-knock performance, it can lead to an increase in cooling heat loss. To help counter this, Toyota engineers have developed a new water jacket spacer to control temperature on the surface of the cylinder. This keeps engine oil warmer with lower viscosity and reduces the temperature fluctuation. This helps reduce friction and allows more engine torque to be generated. At the top end of the temperature scale it reduces temperatures in the combustion chamber. \nThe engine's maximum output of 98 DIN hp/72 kW is delivered at 5,200 rpm, with peak torque of 142 Nm at 3,600 rpm. \nWorld-best thermal efficiency \nThermal efficiency is a measurement of how well an engine converts the energy available in its fuel into usable energy to power the vehicle. \nAs a result of the large-volume exhaust gas recirculation system, improvements in combustion efficiency and innovative ways of managing heat and reducing friction, the new engine has a maximum 40 per cent thermal efficiency, the highest level in the world for a mass-produced petrol engine. This surpasses the 37 per cent of the first Prius' 1.5-litre unit and the 38.5 per cent level of the 1.8-litre engine in the third generation Prius. \nImproved exhaust gas recirculation \nThe exhaust gas recirculation system has an EGR cooler which lowers the temperature of the gas being circulated, thereby reducing the temperature of the intake mixture and reducing risk of engine knock. This allows ignition timing to be fully optimized, which contributes to better thermal efficiency. \nMulti-shaft transaxle - a hybrid first \nThe new generation hybrid system has a redesigned transaxle that offers more efficient performance and packaging and reduced weight. A gear train with the two electric motor-generators placed on multiple axes has been adopted to shorten the overall length by 47 mm compared to the previous generation hybrid system. \nThe transaxle houses four components: two electric motor-generators (MG1 and MG2); a single planetary gear; and a reduction gear to the final drive. MG1 serves primarily as a generator, converting any surplus power from the petrol engine into electricity, which can be stored in the HV battery. It also serves as the engine's starter motor. MG2 is the electric drive motor, which also acts as a generator when the car is in regenerative braking mode. It drives the car from start-up, at low speed and in EV (electric vehicle) mode and is the sole propulsion method when the vehicle is in reverse. \nImproved hybrid software \nUpdates to the hybrid system software allow the Toyota C-HR to draw more on its electric drivetrain, allowing it to accelerate in a low engine rev range. It also has permitted the speed range of the electric motor (the range in which the electric motor can be used exclusively) to be increased by 60 per cent, compared to the third generation Prius. This means there is less dependency on the petrol engine at higher speeds, improving fuel economy. \nSmaller, better electric motors \nThe two motor-generators are all-new and are smaller and lighter than before to suit the new multi-shaft transaxle design, with no negative affect on fuel economy. \nHigher motor speed and new forced water-convection cooling in place of air cooling improve the efficiency of the electric-drive motor (MG2), which delivers 53 kW of power and 163 Nm of torque. \nFully redesigned power control unit \nThe power control unit (PCU) has been totally redesigned, resulting in a 33 per cent reduction in size, a six per cent weight saving and a 20 per cent reduction in electrical losses. \nThe PCU is the multi-purpose electrical heart of the vehicle, housing the inverter/voltage booster, a DC/DC converter for auxiliary power and the electronic control for the motor-generators. \nIn place of a belt-driven alternator the Toyota C-HR uses a DC/DC converter to recharge the 12-volt auxiliary battery by using the HV battery energy. \nNickel-metal Hydride HV battery \nThe nickel-metal hydride (NiMH) battery is more compact, and is located entirely beneath the rear seats, avoiding any intrusion in the load space. It has increased cooling efficiency and a wider regeneration range. \n1.2T ENGINE: GOOD PERFORMANCE AND LOW CONSUMPTION \nThe 1.2T engine uses advanced technologies that allow the engine to change from the Otto-cycle to the Atkinson cycle under low loads, it has vertical vortex high tumble air flow intake ports, an exhaust manifold integrated in the cylinder-head and advanced heat management. To this, the 1.2T adds a direct injection system, as well as a water-cooled turbo and heat-exchanger. Furthermore, the VVT-i (Variable Valve Timing - intelligent) system known from the Aygo and Yaris 1.0 engine, is upgraded to a VVT-iW (Variable Valve Timing - intelligent Wide) system, which allows even more flexibility in the valve-timing. \nThe combination of these technologies results in outstanding performance and efficiency. For a displacement of 1.197cm3, the engine delivers 116 DIN hp (85kW) and a constant torque of 185 Nm between 1.500 and 4.000 rpm. It will push the Toyota C-HR from 0 to 100 km/h in 10.9 seconds and the top speed is set at 190 km/h. All of this is achieved despite a strong focus on fuel consumption and CO2 - the car achieves 5.5/100 km on the combined cycle, and delivers just 125g/km of CO2. \nAdvanced heat management \nThe key to achieving outstanding fuel consumption without compromising performance, is to apply a higher compression. But generally, as the compression increases, so does the risk of uncontrolled combustion, also known as knocking. \nThe 1.2T's high compression ratio of 10:1 was made possible thanks to the adoption of a series of key technologies that improve control over the combustion process. That way, the risk of knocking could be avoided. \nFirst of all, the intake ports have been designed to generate a more intense flow and a 'vertical vortex', and also the shape of the piston has been optimized to improve in-cylinder turbulence. As a result, fuel and intake air mix faster, and a more homogeneous mixture is formed. This leads to a higher combustion speed - which helps prevent knocking. \nAdvanced heat-management is in itself a great way to improve fuel economy, but it is also another way of reducing the risk of knocking. The engine was designed in such a way, that the temperature of each individual part can be optimized. For example, the bottom of the pistons is cooled by oil-jets and the cooling of the cylinder head is separated from that of the engine block. This allows to reduce the temperature in the combustion chamber, whilst keeping the block itself hot enough to reduce friction. \nDirect injection contributes as well, as it helps to dissipate the heat in the combustion chamber. And the charge air passes through the intercooler, which uses an independent low temperature cooling circuit. \nLow-end torque and quick response \nA low-inertia turbocharger, the VVT-iW valve system and the D-4T direct injection system work hand in hand to ensure excellent torque delivery from the lowest engine speeds. Together with the limited volume intake system, this ensures an immediate response to the accelerator pedal. \nThe injection system has been newly developed for the 1.2T engine. Compact in design, it is perfect for utilisation in a small displacement engine. It allows multiple injections per cycle, and the optimized width and reduced length of the fuel spray ensure the quality of the combustion, regardless of the engine regime and load. \nFrom Otto to Atkinson \nThe VVT-i (Variable Valve Timing - intelligent) system operates on both the intake and the exhaust side, and allows maximizing torque at all engine speeds. In addition, the new VVT-iW (Variable Valve Timing - intelligent Wide) allows for the intake valve closing to be delayed, which means that the engine can operate in both the Otto and the Atkinson cycle. The latter is used in extremely low load conditions, when the intake valve remains open for a fraction of time, after the compression stroke has set in, allowing part of the gas charge to be pushed back into the intake. As a result, the effective compression stroke is shortened. Pumping losses are reduced, since the pressure on the piston is lower, and also the throttle valve can be opened wider. \nQuick and smooth Stop & Start \nA new start control was developed to ensure a quick and smooth engine restart. When the system shuts down the engine, it controls the stop position to leave the piston half way in the compression stroke. Then, upon restart, it applies stratified injection in the first compressed cylinder to counter vibrations. And by retarding the ignition, torque increase is kept in check, preventing the engine from revving excessively, hence ensuring a confident and tranquil take-off. \nLike a heel/toe master: Intelligent Manual Transmission \nFor the first time in the Toyota range a new system called \"Intelligent Manual Transmission\" is fitted to the Toyota C-HR 1.2T. Just like a heel/toe master, the system automatically increases the engine revs when downshifting ensuring a smooth gear shift. The system also works when shifting up in order to improve comfort for driver and passengers by reducing clutch shock. A smooth start is also ensured and the risk of stalling is almost null - particularly good news for all the learner-drivers out there. \nDYNAMICS THAT BELIE A CROSSOVER \nThe design and development of the Toyota C-HR chassis has received the full attention of the Chief Engineer Hiroyuki Koba, himself a keen driver. \nFrom the very outset of the project, Hiroyuki Koba travelled thousands of kilometres along European roads in order to understand not only the requirements of the road network, but also the way that Europeans drive. \n\"I have noticed, for example, that Europeans have a much more fluid driving style, based on a more acute observation of traffic\" observes Hiroyuki Koba. \"They avoid obstacles simply by adapting their trajectory and speed and will focus to carry on speed aiming for efficient progress, while elsewhere in the world the preferred approach is very often to stop. This has prompted us to work with our European team on driving precision in all aspects of the vehicle. We wanted to achieve performance on a par with a good C-segment hatchback.\" \nWith its low centre of gravity and double-wishbone rear suspension, the new TNGA-based platform has formed an ideal starting point from which to ensure that all of the features of the chassis could be designed to obtain an immediate and natural response to the driver's actions. Chief Engineer Hiroyuki Koba has been engaged in each key dynamic assessment and decision, assuring that his vision \"Response, Linearity and Consistency\" fully came to life. \nIn particular, steering has been designed to be perfectly linear which, together with the optimum limitation of rolling motion, gives the Toyota C-HR remarkable driving precision for a crossover. Limiting body movement, which generally affects tall cars in particular, also has a direct influence on comfort. Even on European often battered roads, the car remains remarkably composed and accurate, adding to the confidence and joy of driving. \nResponse, Linearity and Consistency \nDuring the entire development phase, Chief Engineer Hiroyuki Koba has stayed true to his vision of 'Response, Linearity and Consistency'. 'Response' refers to the fact that the car needs to react immediately to any driver input. 'Linearity' means that the vehicle response must build up gradually, and precisely in line with the amount of driver input. And 'Consistency' relates to how the car reacts in the same predictable way, no matter what the speed or circumstances are. It is Koba's belief that by ensuring these three elements, the car can inspire true confidence, making every drive more fun. \nThe new and rigid GA-C platform on which the Toyota C-HR is built, provided an excellent starting point. To ensure precision, a MacPherson Strut suspension was designed specifically for the Toyota C-HR. It includes a strut bearing rotation axis that has been defined to reduce steering friction drastically, allowing smooth and accurate steering. To ensure a hatchback-like roll-rigidity, the large-diameter stabilizer is directly linked to the strut via a stabilizer link. \nAt the back, a double wishbone suspension contributes significantly to the crisp driving experience. It lends most of its hardware from the latest generation Prius, the first car to be built on the GA-C platform. However, for the Toyota C-HR, it has been modified to meet Koba's demands in terms of controllability, stability and ride comfort. Thanks to the use of a specific sub frame, the suspension angles could be optimized - an element that was instrumental to give this C Crossover its hatchback-like handling in spite of its increased height. Different from Prius, the C-HR uses a ball-joint for the connection of the lower arm n°2. This provides a high level of twist rigidity, and enables compliance steer through the side forces that act on the rear wheels. The shock absorber is angled forward, reducing road load and improving luggage space. \nAll Wheel Drive (AWD) system \nThe Toyota C-HR 1.2T with CVT transmission can be equipped with the Dynamic Torque Control AWD System. The front and rear drive force distribution is precisely controlled via an electro-magnetic coupling. Depending of the circumstances the front-rear drive force distribution can vary from 100-0% to 50-50%. The system includes Cornering Control, a specific logic allowing the driver to track the intended driving line by adjusting the drive force depending on driving conditions. With Pre-torque Control, front-rear drive-torque distribution is adjusted to 90-10% as from the moment the driver operates the steering wheel. This ensures good response to changes in the steering angle when cornering. Thanks to the Yaw-rate feedback control, understeer and oversteer are corrected by optimal control of the front and rear drive-force, distributed every 6 milliseconds. \nTOYOTA NEW GLOBAL ARCHITECTURE \nThe Toyota C-HR reaps the benefits of being constructed on a new Toyota New Global Architecture-based platform (TNGA). \nThe Toyota C-HR follows the new, fourth generation Prius as the second production model to use the GA-C platform, strategically adapted to suit the particular requirements of a stylish and dynamically rewarding C-segment crossover. \nIt demonstrates how Toyota's development of TNGA has ensured its new platforms are not rigidly standardized, but have a built-in flexibility that allows them to be engineered with ease to suit multiple vehicle types, from hatchbacks to SUVs. \nThe C-HR's use of a TNGA-based platform has proved central in supporting Chief Engineer Hiroyuki Koba's determination \"not to compromise design or driving performance,\" contributing to the crossover's fun-to-drive quality, its individual styling and its fundamental safety performance. \nLow centre of gravity \nIn terms of vehicle dynamics, the basic design of the GA-C platform allows for a low centre of gravity to be achieved - in the case of the Toyota C-HR, the lowest in its class, in fact. The benefit of this is realized in a more engaging drive and balanced handling, with much reduced body roll. \nA low-set driving position is another direct benefit of TNGA, but with the C-HR the designers have raised the driver's hip point slightly compared to the new Prius, in line with the higher, commanding position at the wheel that crossover customers favour. \nThe adaptability of the GA-C platform is also witnessed in the C-HR's shorter wheelbase compared to Prius (2,640 vs 2,700 mm) and wider front and rear treads (+20 mm front, +10 mm rear). These changes reflect both the different packaging and handling requirements for the crossover. \nRationalized engine compartment \nTNGA allows for the arrangement of the engine compartment to be rethought, with components relocated and set lower down in the space to support the vehicle's lower centre of gravity. In the C-HR it has enabled the engine to be angled slightly rearward, helping the designers secure a lower hood line as well as contributing to the lower centre of gravity. \nAlthough the new Prius is exclusively powered by a full hybrid system, the C-HR offers both full hybrid and petrol powertrains, the latter with the option of both front and all-wheel drive. The GA-C platform is able to accommodate each of these powertrains without compromising the vehicle's packaging, styling or chassis balance. \nHigh-rigidity for rewarding dynamics and ride comfort \nThe GA-C platform combines with the Toyota C-HR's highly rigid body to provide excellent responsiveness that is consistent and linear to the driver's inputs. The essential quality of the dynamic handling removes the need for the suspension to be firmed up to achieve the desired level of performance, thus avoiding any compromise in ride comfort. \nDesign freedom with reduced vehicle height \nAs well as the lower hood line made possible by the repositioning of the engine within the engine bay, the GA-C platform also enables a lower overall vehicle height to be achieved, This has been of particular value to the C-HR design team in producing the striking, coupe-like upper body that helps set the Toyota apart from its C-segment crossover rivals. At the same time, the low roofline does not call for compromise in headroom for front or rear seat passengers, thanks to the lower seating positions made possible by the new platform. \nSafety performance \nSuperior safety performance is inherent in TNGA, with priority given to achieving the highest standards of active and passive safety. Toyota's new platforms and vehicle designs target the exacting standards set by the world's leading independent crash test programs, supported by the advanced performance of the functions and systems of Toyota Safety Sense, as featured on the new Toyota C-HR.",

Click here to submit a Letter to the Editor , and we may publish it in print. \nLOS ANGELES -- The U.S. version of Toyota's subcompact crossover C-HR will be equipped with one gasoline engine and a continuously variable automatic transmission for now. \nToyota did not announce pricing in unveiling the crossover at the Los Angeles Auto Show on Thursday. But executives said they are targeting the low-$20,000 range to distinguish it from its larger RAV4 offering, which typically is sold in the high-$20,000 to low-$30,000 price point, depending on options. The wavy-bodied C-HR will be available next spring . \nThe naturally aspirated 4-cylinder gas engine makes a modest 144 horsepower and 140 pound-feet of torque sent to the front wheels through a CVT with a manual mode, Toyota said. \nIn Europe, the “Coupe-High Rider” is equipped with a hybrid engine or a small turbocharged gasoline motor, and is available with a manual transmission. Some of those combinations could come to the U.S. later. \nThe new baby crossover was presented to booming electronic music at the auto show by Bill Fay, group vice president and General Manager, Toyota Division. \n“The C-HR will attract young, active multi-cultural professionals,” Fay said. “It gets us right in synch with the market’s love for compact crossovers, a segment that is expected to surpass one million sales by 2020.” You can reach Laurence Iliff at Tags:",

      "text": "Marty Padgett Editorial Director \nThe Toyota C-HR is a five-seat hatchback with the ride height of a crossover SUV--but without the all-wheel-drive option. \nShown for a few years as a concept at major auto shows, the C-HR initially was intended for Toyota's Scion brand, but was moved to the Toyota product plan when Scion was shuttered. \nThe C-HR joins the Corolla iM and Yaris in the Toyota hatchback lineup in the spring of 2017, as a 2018 model MORE: Read our 2018 Toyota C-HR preview \nThe C-HR has an adventurous design, one that goes head to head with the conceptually similar Nissan Juke in its audacious looks. Its shape isn't one that is digested on one glance: its curves, crests, slits, and upkicks take a while to process. Animal-like jowls and cat-eye lamps flow into fenders that wrap themselves tightly around its wheel wells and 18-inch tires. The sills and side stampings impress a deep skeletal shape into the sideview. The roofline slopes and the rear pillar turns up--and they meet at the rear door handles. The taillamps bracket a tall rear end, where the 3/4 view of the C-HR isn't quite as appealing, more janky. \nThe C-HR's cockpit may be a standout in its class, which includes vehicles such as the Fiat 500L and the Honda Fit and, of course, the Juke. The center stack is particularly interesting; Toyota calls the surround that groups the touchscreen and other controls a MeZONE. Minus the cloying marketing-speak, it's an interesting approach that isolates secondary controls in one area. \nThe C-HR's crossover vibe stops with its tall ride height. The 2.0-liter inline-4 promises economy, not off-road grunt. It puts out 144 hp and 140 lb-ft of torque, and the C-HR sends its power to the front wheels only, no all-wheel drive at all. A continuously variable transmission (CVT) delivers the power to those driven wheels; it's programmed with 7 simulated gear ratios, available through the C-HR's Sport driving mode, which also adds weight to its steering. \nAs a member of the Toyota TNGA global-car family (think new Prius), the C-HR should have markedly better handling than Toyota's recent small cars. Toyota says its front strut suspension gets Sachs dampers and a relatively thick stabilizer bar for responsive road manners. At the rear, the C-HR employs double wishbones and Sachs dampers. In all, Toyota says, it's a combination that should deliver a smooth ride and good responsiveness in city driving. \nThe C-HR sits at the very small end of the Toyota crossover spectrum, but among its hatchbacks, it's not so petite. Interior space is augmented, Toyota says, by well-bolstered sport seats in front, surrounded by lots of storage bins and cupholders. In back, no promises are made--but Toyota says it's scalloped out the backs of the front seats and trimmed the headliner back to create valuable headroom. For more flexibility, the rear seats flip and fold flat along a 60/40 split. \nAll C-HR hatchbacks come with 10 airbags, a rearview camera, forward-collision warnings with automatic emergency braking, lane-departure warnings with lane-keep assist, automatic high beams, and adaptive cruise control. Blind-spot monitors are an option. \nTwo versions of the C-HR will come to showrooms in the spring. The XLE gets power features, 18-inch wheels, dual-zone climate control, touchscreen audio, and a rearview camera. The XLE Premium adds blind-spot monitors, a power driver seat, heated front seats, and pushbutton start. The audio system on both includes AM/FM/HD radio, a USB port, and Bluetooth with audio streaming and voice controls. \nPricing hasn't been announced, but the 2018 C-HR will go on sale in spring 2017.",

      "text": "11/17/16 AT 6:45 PM Close \nIt appears that Toyota Motor Corporation is planning to position itself as a solid competitor against Elon Musk’s Tesla Motors. The Japanese automotive manufacturer just confirmed that it is forming an “in-house venture company,” which is going to focus on EVs. The in-house company is forming next month, and it is expected to start developing battery-powered eco-cars right away. What’s good about having a streamlined company of just four people is that decision-making is remarkably faster, according to Auto News . This setup would also be beneficial for Toyota’s main goal of commercializing EVs at the start of the next decade. \n“As a venture company that will specialize in its field and embrace speed in its approach to work, it is my hope that it will serve as a pulling force for innovation,” Toyota CEO Akio Toyoda said in a statement. In a press release, the company echoed the same message of accelerated progress when it comes to manufacturing “fast-to-market products.” \nToyota is reportedly shifting its attention from producing fuel-cell cars onto commercializing electric vehicles since battery-powered vehicles are becoming more viable as mainstream cars in the global market, as per Auto Express . Toyota is said to be planning its entry into the EV market by launching an electric car that borrows its platform from the company’s famous Prius cars. Should this be the case, Toyota could save a lot of time and development costs. Related Stories",

      "text": "Toyota 2018 Toyota C-HR \nToyota may be late to the subcompact crossover game, but it's got a sharp new entry. After appearing in close-to-production trim at the Geneva Motor Show in March, the CH-R has finally arrived in final US production form at the Los Angeles Show , and a few things have changed on the model's journey to production -- including a few things we're rather bummed to report. \nWe first caught a glimpse of the C-HR concept at the Paris Motor Show in 2014, and the production vehicle hasn't changed much. This little guy was originally supposed to be sold as a Scion, which goes some way toward explaining its youthful look. Whatever its origins, we're just glad it's finally made it into production. The C-HR looks to be a slightly less-wacky-looking Nissan Juke , with aggressive body lines, exaggerated front and rear fenders, large 18-inch wheels and an inward boomerang bend to the tail lights. Versus the European production version we saw earlier this year in Geneva, the US model has been fitted with different lights front and rear, and regrettably, they appear to be cheaper, non-LED units. \nEdgy looks disguise a pretty ordinary drivetrain. Wayne Cunningham/CNET Roadshow \nBased on the same global platform that underpins the latest-generation Prius , the C-HR will be available in the US powered solely by a 2.0-liter naturally aspirated four-cylinder engine generating 144 horsepower and 139 pound-feet of torque. For those keeping score, in Europe, the C-HR is offered as a 1.8-liter hybrid, putting out 120 horsepower, or a 133-hp, 1.2-liter turbo, the latter of which can also be ordered with a manual gearbox. \nWe're particularly bummed we won't get more powertrain diversity in the States, but the most curious -- and frustrating -- omission is a lack of available all-wheel drive, a pretty essential ingredient for entry into crossoverdom. That's right, the C-HR is front-wheel-drive only, which suggests its appeal could be limited in northern markets. There aren't too many CUVs that make this compromise -- rivals like the aforementioned Juke, Honda HR-V , Mazda CX-3 and Chevrolet Trax are all available with grips-at-all-fours traction. The boxy Kia Soul sells well and is available exclusively with front-wheel drive, but many would debate if it's even a crossover, or simply a hatchback. \nNo word on pricing yet, but it would make sense for the new C-HR to slot in a good bit south of Toyota's larger RAV4 , which starts at just over $24,000. Toyota C-HR looks outrageous, conceals...

      "text": "Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends \nMazda is joining with electric car commitment lineup, though it is hedging its bets. Mazda told Australian press at the Los Angeles Auto Show it will likely start with a low-volume electric vehicle, teaming with Toyota in developing an electric powertrain with an optional rotary engine range extender, according to CarAdvice.com . \n“Probably by 2020 globally, five to 10 percent [of vehicle sales] will be pure EV, while the other 95-90 will still use ICE (internal combustion engine). Therefore ICE is [still] the most important technology all over the world,” Mazda’s Head of Research and Development Kiyoshi Fujiwara said. \nMore: Toyota joins the all-electric club, forms ‘nimble’ development team \nMazda’s initial electric cars may not show up in the United States, however, or in the huge Chinese market, Fujiwara said. “Of course we need EVs. As you know, in Norway, the complete energy source is water … this means that EV is much better for CO2 in Norway. But not in the U.S. or China … Therefore we are focusing on ICE, but some regions we need EV, so therefore in 2019 [or] in that time frame we will introduce EV where it is needed in the world.” \nIn a separate roundtable at the Los Angeles Auto Show, Mazda CEO Masamichi Kogai said the company would offer electric vehicles in 2019 in order to “accommodate the ZEV regulations in North America,” Electrek reported . The ZEV (Zero Emissions Vehicle) regulations are percentages of total fleet sales with zero-emissions guidelines established by California and adopted by nine other states. \nElectrek also quoted a Wall Street Journal report in which Kogai said, “Mazda would add original features to its electric cars to differentiate itself. He said engineers were looking at ways to keep the cars running longer when the battery was nearly dead.” The “original features” comment sounds like a reference to the small ICE rotary range extender mentioned by Fujiwara. \nMazda is developing its system by itself, according to Fujiwara, but development has just started. Any partnership with Toyota for cost efficiency and scalability would likely involve portions common to vehicles made by both companies. \nFujiwara also indicated that Mazda’s first electric vehicle would use an existing ICE platform, rather than starting from the ground with a new EV platform. Because he sees the Mazda EV with a small rotary range extender, the ICE platform could be suitable. If it were battery only, requiring huge battery packs, then a new platform would be required. \nMazda’s R&D head also indicated that as the cost of battery technology comes down, the potential for electric vehicles increases. So overall, Mazda is going to develop at least one electric vehicle but for now, the company appears to be committing to EVs only with an ICE assist. Also watch: Superformance Ford GT40 MkII Review",

      "text": "Toyota Drops 2018 C-HR into Subcompact Crossover Grudge Match Los Angeles Debut Reveals Toyota’s Juke-Fighter View Photo Gallery | 36 Photos One of the newest and most contested segments today is the subcompact crossover, currently dominated by the likes of the Honda HR-V, Nissan Juke, Jeep Renegade, and Chevrolet Trax. Toyota wants buyers to add one more funky alphanumeric designation to their shopping lists, with the C-HR subcompact. View Photo Gallery | 36 Photos Photo 2/36 | 2018 Toyota C HR Rear Three Quarter Immediately, the Toyota C-HR makes a strong first impression, thanks to its aggressive styling elements and serious body sculpting. Its front end bears a passing resemblance to the Toyota RAV4 , but a lower snout betrays it as the RAV's kid brother. Strong rocker panel sculpting moves the eye toward the rear of the vehicle, where the steeply raked hatch does its best impression of a sporty coupe. Whether it's attractive or not depends on each individual's perspective, but there's no denying the C-HR is one of the most unique crossovers in the segment. View Photo Gallery | 36 Photos Photo 3/36 | 2018 Toyota C HR Front Three Quarter A 144hp 2.0L direct-injected I-4 gives the C-HR its motivating force. That output isn't pavement-breaking at all, but it does compare favorably to the Honda HR-V and Chevrolet Trax. Lead-footed crossover buyers would be better served by the turbocharged Nissan Juke. The C-HR routes its power to the front wheels via a continuously variable transmission. All-wheel drive doesn't look to be an option, at least not yet. View Photo Gallery | 36 Photos Photo 4/36 | 2018 Toyota C HR Interior All Toyota C-HRs will come with Toyota Safety Sense P (TSS-P), a suite of active driving assistants that provide forward collision monitoring, automatic emergency braking, lane-departure alert, and full-speed radar-based cruise control. That's a long list of features that aren't expected in the subcompact crossover segment, and TSS-P will likely be one of the crossover's most appealing features to buyers. View Photo Gallery | 36 Photos Photo 5/36 | 2018 Toyota C HR Rear Three Quarter 03 With a subcompact footprint, it's not fair to expect the C-HR to offer Range Rover comfort inside, but the Toyota's artful interior design and various interior storage bins should make it a fun place to spend time. A 60/40 folding rear seat expands cargo space for larger items, while deeply scalloped seatbacks open up rear passenger kneeroom. As on most modern compact cars, the C-HR looks to be a very well-packaged machine, offering reasonable space with trim proportions.",

      "text": "Toyota organises 'Fortuner Experiential Drive Camp' to give first-hand experience to potential customers\n\nLaunched on November 7, 2016, the new Toyota Fortuner has been drumming headlines with its awe-inspiring looks, plusher cabin and powerful engines. To give more insight and feel to its customers, Toyota has announced a ‘Fortuner Experiential Drive Camp’ across three major cities – Mumbai, Bangalore and Delhi. The event started on November 11 and will culminate on the 21st of this month.\nThe Japanese automaker plans to call around 1500 of its existing customers to get a feel of the new Fortuner’s off-roading capabilities across different scenarios like steep inclines, slush, deep water, descents, etc.\nSpeaking on the camp organisation, N. Raja, director & senior vice president - Sales & Marketing, Toyota Kirloskar Motor, said, “Ever since its launch in 2009 in India, the Fortuner has enjoyed immense popularity as an SUV for both its on-road as well as off-roading capabilities. As a company, Toyota believes in constantly studying the market and enhancing our products basis the customer feedback that we receive. In the case of the Fortuner, we discovered that our customers find value in the pride of owning a vehicle with full-fledged 4WD capability which can also be used for smooth city driving.”\nHe also said that the newly developed frame structure of the new Fortuner, which delivers exceptional toughness, have been loaded with features like Hill Start Assist Control (HAC), Downhill Assist Control (DAC) and Active Traction Control (A-TRC), among others.\n“…we are confident that in the new Fortuner, customers will find value and prestige that goes beyond their expectations,” he added.\nSpeaking of its mechanicals, the new Fortuner is packed with a new 2.7-litre petrol mill and a new 2.8-litre diesel engine, linked to an all-new 6-speed automatic transmission with sequential & paddle shifters. The former puts out 166PS and 245Nm while the latter produces 177PS and 450Nm.\nThe launch of the new Fortuner has certainly scared the competition but whether it can continue the same supremacy like it used to enjoy with the older version is yet to be seen. Do let us know what you feel about this SUV in the comments section below.\nRead More on: Toyota Fortuner \nRead full article on cardekho.com",

      "text": "Blog This Changshu, China,   Toyota Motor Corporation announces the expansion of R&D facilities at Toyota Motor Engineering & Manufacturing (China) Co., Ltd., (TMEC). This is in accordance with the initial investment plan, which had been created at the time of the establishment of the R&D facilities. Specifically, the plan includes improvements to the existing laboratory facility, construction of a new laboratory, creation of a battery evaluation and test facility, as well as improvements to test tracks on the premises. These are scheduled to be completed from late 2018 onwards.TMEC was established in 2010, in line with Toyota's aim to produce cars in China for the Chinese market. To this end, TMEC was created with the intention to emphasize on the localization and strengthening of organizational development in the country. Since then, TMEC has worked toward the promotion and expansion of cars that are equipped with China-made hybrid systems for the Chinese market. In 2012, Toyota Motor (Changshu) Auto Parts Co., Ltd., was created as the local production company for the main hybrid system (hybrid vehicle transaxle). This was followed by the establishment of the Sinogy Toyota Automotive Energy System Co., Ltd. (STAES), a hybrid battery production company in 2013. Altogether, these developments led to the October 2015 launch of the Corolla Hybrid and the Levin Hybrid which are fitted with China-made hybrid systems.Toyota has been using each of the distinct characteristics of hybrid, plug-in hybrids, electric, and fuel cell vehicles to develop and promote the full range of eco-cars. The Chinese government is currently promoting eco-cars under its Energy-Saving and New Energy Automotive Industry Development Plan. In line with this plan, Toyota is planning the introduction of plug-in hybrids under its Corolla Levin lineup, in addition to its current effort to promote the wider use of hybrid vehicles.Additionally, preparations are underway to begin demonstration tests for fuel cell vehicles in China, and to conduct research for the introduction of electric vehicles into the China market. Amid the growing intensity of competition in the Chinese market and the increasingly stringent regulations in relation to motor vehicles, Toyota intends to continue with the emphasis on the making of ever-better cars through the further expansion of TMEC's R&D facilities, and the reinforcement of its technological development capability.Mr. Hiroji Onishi, Senior Managing Officer and CEO for the China Region, said at a press conference held at the ongoing Guangzhou Motor Show, that \"Efforts are being directed toward the reinforcement of local R&D capability for the long term. We hope to train as many local engineers as possible, and to develop more cars that would satisfy the needs of our customers in China.\" About ToyotaSupported by people around the world, Toyota Motor Corporation (TSE: 7203; NYSE: TM), has endeavored since its establishment in 1937 to serve society by creating better products. As of the end of December 2013, Toyota conducts its business worldwide with 52 overseas manufacturing companies in 27 countries and regions.

      "text": "Prius \nJapan's biggest automaker said on Thursday it will launch next month a unit that will start with four persons and be responsible for planning a strategy for developing and marketing electric cars to keep pace with tightening global emissions regulations. The unit will expand by drawing upon engineers, designers and other personnel from various sections of the company as needed. \nThe announcement comes after Toyota, which has invested heavily in hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles (FCVs), this month said it would like to have the option of developing full-sized electric vehicles. Even as rivals such as Nissan Motor Co, Volkswagen AG and Tesla Motors have touted pure electric cars as the most viable zero-emission vehicles for the future, Toyota had said it would reserve electric vehicles for short-distance commuting given the high price of rechargeable batteries and lengthy charging times. Toyota Prius - The Company's Hybrid Electric Car \nToyota has been developing ultra-compact electric vehicles for years. But by adding longer-range models to its product range, it would be changing its tune from promoting FCVs and plug-in petrol-electric hybrid cars as the most promising alternative to conventional cars. \"The company's position is changing. They still talk about hybrids and fuel cells but I think there is a recognition that battery electric cars are getting a lot of traction right now,\" CASA analyst Chris Richter said. \n\"It's going to take an awful long time before fuel cells are a competitive alternative to electric vehicles. In the meantime, a lot of things are going on right now (with battery electric cars) and they need to be there,\" Richter added. \nThe new unit would initially consist of one person each from the automaker and three group companies. These are machine manufacturer Toyota Industries Corporation, and parts suppliers Aisin Seiki Co and Denso Corp. \"Regulations on lower emissions vehicles are changing very quickly, so we also have to respond quickly. With its small size, the new venture will be able to be more nimble in its planning and decision making, to speed up the process to develop electric cars,\" spokesman Itsuki Kurosu said. \nToyota has pledged to make all of its vehicles essentially emissions-free by 2050.",

      "text": "Toyota Expands its R&D Facilities in China Toyota Expands its R&D Facilities in China Changshu, China, Nov 18, 2016 - (ACN Newswire) - Toyota Motor Corporation announces the expansion of R&D facilities at Toyota Motor Engineering & Manufacturing (China) Co., Ltd., (TMEC). This is in accordance with the initial investment plan, which had been created at the time of the establishment of the R&D facilities. Specifically, the plan includes improvements to the existing laboratory facility, construction of a new laboratory, creation of a battery evaluation and test facility, as well as improvements to test tracks on the premises. These are scheduled to be completed from late 2018 onwards.\nTMEC was established in 2010, in line with Toyota's aim to produce cars in China for the Chinese market. To this end, TMEC was created with the intention to emphasize on the localization and strengthening of organizational development in the country. Since then, TMEC has worked toward the promotion and expansion of cars that are equipped with China-made hybrid systems for the Chinese market. In 2012, Toyota Motor (Changshu) Auto Parts Co., Ltd., was created as the local production company for the main hybrid system (hybrid vehicle transaxle). This was followed by the establishment of the Sinogy Toyota Automotive Energy System Co., Ltd. (STAES), a hybrid battery production company in 2013. Altogether, these developments led to the October 2015 launch of the Corolla Hybrid and the Levin Hybrid which are fitted with China-made hybrid systems.\nToyota has been using each of the distinct characteristics of hybrid, plug-in hybrids, electric, and fuel cell vehicles to develop and promote the full range of eco-cars. The Chinese government is currently promoting eco-cars under its Energy-Saving and New Energy Automotive Industry Development Plan. In line with this plan, Toyota is planning the introduction of plug-in hybrids under its Corolla Levin lineup, in addition to its current effort to promote the wider use of hybrid vehicles.\nAdditionally, preparations are underway to begin demonstration tests for fuel cell vehicles in China, and to conduct research for the introduction of electric vehicles into the China market. Amid the growing intensity of competition in the Chinese market and the increasingly stringent regulations in relation to motor vehicles, Toyota intends to continue with the emphasis on the making of ever-better cars through the further expansion of TMEC's R&D facilities, and the reinforcement of its technological development capability.\nMr. Hiroji Onishi, Senior Managing Officer and CEO for the China Region, said at a press conference held at the ongoing Guangzhou Motor Show, that \"Efforts are being directed toward the reinforcement of local R&D capability for the long term. We hope to train as many local engineers as possible, and to develop more cars that would satisfy the needs of our customers in China.\"\nAbout Toyota\nSupported by people around the world, Toyota Motor Corporation (TSE: 7203; NYSE: TM), has endeavored since its establishment in 1937 to serve society by creating better products. As of the end of December 2013, Toyota conducts its business worldwide with 52 overseas manufacturing companies in 27 countries and regions. Toyota's vehicles are sold in more than 170 countries and regions. For more information, please visit www.toyota-global.com .

      "text": "We auto journalists rarely get surprises at auto shows any more -- there are just too many teasers and leaks. But Chevy has managed a small, mud-spattered coup today, revealing this 2017 Colorado ZR2 just ahead of the Los Angeles Auto Show. The midsize off-road bruiser was first shown in concept form back in 2014 right here in LA, and the production version looks to have retained much of what made the concept so menacingly enticing for truck buyers who prefer to play dirty. The new ZR2 literally picks up where the Colorado ZR2 leaves off, with a 2-inch suspension lift featuring unique spool-valve dampers from Multimatic, a company perhaps better known for its activities in Formula One.

I have no options.” \nCity Attorney Robert Sullivan declined to comment on the status of the negotiations. \nBut he did confirm that the notice of land taking had been sent to Boyle. \n“The next step is that a filing will occur with the Board of Tax and Land Appeals and a declaration of taking is recorded,” Sullivan said. \nThe lawsuit against the city scheduled for Friday is also moving forward, Boyle said, and on Thursday Woodland, City Planner Rick Taintor and Director of Public Works Peter Rice were all deposed. \nRice testified that it would cost $1.3 million to 1.7 million to move the sewer line on the property, Boyle said, when previously city officials had said it would cost $500,000. \nSullivan, who attended the depositions, confirmed they had taken place. \n“There are going to be further depositions as you would expect in a case of this magnitude,” Sullivan said. \nBut he declined to discuss Rice’s testimony. \n“I’m not prepared to get into a media debate with Mr. Boyle,” Sullivan said. \nBoyle criticized what he described as the “wasting of taxpayer money” as the city continues its legal fight with him. \n“The city continues to spend thousands of dollars but it’s not their money,” Boyle said. “ ... The only one who’s actually spending their own money is me.” \nSpear on Thursday declined to comment on how the negotiations were going. \n“We’re all trying to do the best we can for the residents and the city,” Spear said. “Until there’s a resolution we can’t discuss anything that happens in the meetings.” \nSullivan said there is still an opportunity to reach a deal. \n“I have been hopeful for a number of years that this case could be settled and I would intend to continue efforts in that direction,” Sullivan said.",

      "text": "GUANGZHOU, China (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> is testing its Mirai fuel-cell vehicle in China, the head of the Japanese automaker's China business, Hiroji Onishi, said on Friday at the Guangzhou auto show.\nToyota has promoted fuel cell vehicles as the most sensible next-generation option to hybrids but a lack of hydrogen fuelling stations poses a major hurdle for mass consumption.\nMirai, which means \"future\" in Japanese, is a four-person sedan first introduced in 2014 that has a range of 300 miles, and is Toyota's first mass-market fuel cell car.\nWhile China is pushing electric technology and hoping its homegrown brands can close a competitive gap with global rivals, Japan is investing heavily in fuel-cell technology, aiming to foster what it calls a 'hydrogen society', where the zero-emission fuel would power homes and vehicles.\n(Reporting by Jake Spring; Writing by John Ruwitch; Editing by Himani Sarkar and Edwina Gibbs)",

      "text": "U.S. Spec 2018 Toyota C-HR Makes 2016 LA Auto Show Debut Toyota joins the subcompact crossover party By: Patrick M. Hoey November 17, 2016 \nW hile the Euro-spec Toyota C-HR that made its debut in Geneva earlier this year — a model recently sampled by our colleagues at Motor Trend — gave us a good idea what to expect, it’s only now that we’re meeting the C-HR that will reach U.S shores this coming Spring. \nTo answer those wondering what Toyota’s intent is with the 2018 C-HR, it’s a response to the appetite consumers have for sporty subcompact crossovers that lean more toward the sporty and stylish end of segment. Its main competition will be the likes of the Honda HR-V, Mazda CX-3, and Nissan Juke. \nIf you were hoping the C-HR would retain the expressive and unique styling of its overseas brethren, you’re in luck. Apart from some alterations to headlight and taillight signals, the C-HR will arrive in America with the same sharp looks as it flaunts in other parts of the world. \nUnder the hood, Toyota’s naturally aspirated 2.0-liter I-4 will deliver 144 hp and 140 lb.-ft. of torque to the front wheels via a continuously variable transmission. Other parts of the world will see all-wheel-drive and hybrid variants, but Toyota has yet to announce if or when either drivetrain will be offered in North America. However, we’re counting on seeing one if not both arrive stateside in the future. \nAt launch, the U.S.-spec C-HR will be offered in two trims: XLE and XLE Premium. Both arrive with 18-inch alloy wheels, dual-zone climate control, a 7-inch touchscreen infotainment display, and Toyota Safety Sense P (TSS-P) as standard equipment. TSS-P is a bundle of safety technologies that include pre-collision and pedestrian detection functions, which automatically apply emergency braking if the driver fails to, along with lane departure alerting, assisted steering, automatic high beans, and dynamic radar cruise control. Coupled with a standard suite of 10 airbags, hill-start assist, and a rear backup camera, the only safety equipment offered outside of that is blind spot monitoring system with rear cross traffic alerts, an option that’s exclusive to the XLE Premium. \nAdditional niceties included in the XLE Premium are heated front seats with power lumbar for the driver and auto folding, heated side mirrors, which include puddle lamps that project a “Toyota C-HR” logo onto the ground. XLE Premium models also come with keyless entry and push button start. \nPricing on the C-HR XLE and XLE Premium has not been announced, but we expect it to be competitively priced when it goes on sale Spring 2017, with the XLE starting around $19,500 and XLE Premium around $23,500.",

      "text": "The 2018 Toyota C-HR took a long and convoluted route to its U.S. debut at the 2016 Los Angeles Auto Show this week. It debuted as a concept car just over two years ago, and was originally supposed to be sold here under Toyota’s now-defunct Scion “youth” brand . Now that it’s finally here, is the C-HR worth the wait?\nC-HR stands for “Coupe High-Rider,” although this subcompact crossover does have four doors. Toyota tried to camouflage the rear pair by shrinking the rear window, and making a big crease that almost separates the rear wheels from the rest of the body. It’s all part of a fairly extroverted design that also includes slim headlights, protruding taillights, and a low, sloping roofline. It’s Toyota latest attempt to shake its reputation for boring cars.\nMore: Ford’s EcoSport SUV makes its North American debut\nUnderneath the wildly creased sheet metal, the C-HR rides on the same Toyota New Global Architecture platform used by the Prius hybrid . As with the Prius, Toyota tried to imbue the C-HR with sporty handling characteristics. It even took the little crossover to the Nürburgring, the infamous German racetrack that’s become a measuring stick for high performance cars.\nThe C-HR is far from the most powerful car to show up at the Nürburgring, though. In the U.S., the only available engine will be a 2.0-liter four-cylinder, with 144 horsepower and 140 pound-feet of torque. A continuously variable transmission (CVT) will be mandatory as well. Toyota did include a Sport mode that allows manual shifting with seven simulated gears (because CVTs are fearless), and sharpens throttle response.\nToyota says the interior was designed around a “MeZONE” theme that emphasizes the driver. The 7.0-inch central display screen, for example, is positioned on top of the dashboard rather than in it because, Toyota claims, it requires less eye movement from the driver. All C-HR models also come standard with Toyota Safety Sense P , a bundle of safety systems including autonomous emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, lane departure alert with steering assist, and automatic high beams.\nThe 2018 Toyota C-HR goes on sale in the U.S. next spring, with pricing to be announced closer to the launch date.\nAfter many twists and turns, Toyota’s 2018 C-HR will appear in LA Lexus’ UX concept has ‘kinetic’ seats and holographic displays",

      "text": "Toyota sharpens focus on electric cars through new in-house unit Thu Nov 17, 2016 6:38am EST [ - ] Text [ + ] \nBy Naomi Tajitsu \nTOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp is setting up a new in-house unit to develop electric cars, offering its strongest endorsement yet of a technology it has not embraced wholly, as take up of a rival technology it pioneered remains slow. \nJapan's biggest automaker said on Thursday it will launch next month a unit that will start with four persons and be responsible for planning a strategy for developing and marketing electric cars to keep pace with tightening global emissions regulations. \nThe unit will expand by drawing upon engineers, designers and other personnel from various sections of the company as needed. \nThe announcement comes after Toyota, which has invested heavily in hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles (FCVs), this month said it would like to have the option of developing full-sized electric vehicles. \nEven as rivals such as Nissan Motor Co, Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE: Quote ) and Tesla Motors have touted pure electric cars as the most viable zero-emission vehicles for the future, Toyota had said it would reserve electric vehicles for short-distance commuting given the high price of rechargeable batteries and lengthy charging times. \nToyota has been developing ultra-compact electric vehicles for years. But by adding longer-range models to its product range, it would be changing its tune from promoting FCVs and plug-in petrol-electric hybrid cars as the most promising alternative to conventional cars. \n\"The company's position is changing. They still talk about hybrids and fuel cells but I think there is a recognition that battery electric cars are getting a lot of traction right now,\" CASA analyst Chris Richter said. \n\"It's going to take an awful long time before fuel cells are a competitive alternative to electric vehicles. In the meantime, a lot of things are going on right now (with battery electric cars) and they need to be there,\" Richter said. Continued... ",

Post to Facebook Toyota's new C-HR small crossover CH-R makes a debut Once a Scion, now a Toyota, likely to be a strong contender in the small crossover segment.  //usat.ly/2g4VzC2   Toyota's new C-HR small crossover CH-R makes a debut Chris Woodyard , USA TODAY 8:04 a.m. EST November 18, 2016 The new Toyota C-HR is driven on stage during its introduction at the Toyota press conference on the second of two press days at the Los Angeles Auto Show, (Photo: FREDERIC J. BROWN, AFP/Getty Images) \nLOS ANGELES -- Once a Scion, now a Toyota, likely to be a strong contender in the small crossover segment. \nThat describes the Toyota C-HR, which was just introduced at the Los Angeles Auto Show. It was going to be Scion's replacement for the xB, but then the Japanese automaker closed the division -- and now it's a Toyota. \nLast year, it was one of the top, most interesting concept cars at the L.A. Auto Show. \nIn the debut of the production version this year, Toyota managed to keep most of the concept car's sinewy lines. But while it has the youthful feel of a Scion, it also has cost-cutting elements that made it affordable for the brand's young buyers, like a center screen that looks like an aftermarket add-on. \nBill Fay, the chief of the Toyota division, says not to worry -- designers and engineers are gradually ironing out the Scion-like elements of the division's cars to make them feel more like Toyotas. \nC-HR will be powered by a 2-liter four-cylinder that puts out 144 horsepower. It's coupled with a continously variable transmission, or CVT. \nIn case you're wondering, C-HR stands for \"Coupe -- High Rider,\" Toyota says. It will come in two grades. The base model includes 18-inch alloy wheels, dual-zone air conditioning and heating, a seven-inch center display and Toyota's suite of safety technologies, including 10 airbags.

      "text": "Toyota Edges Closer To Launching Its Own All-Electric Vehicles | By Share Despite being a longtime electric-car skeptic , Toyota is finally leaving the door open for full-electric vehicles to join its lineup in the near future. According to a company executive, the Japanese automaker has to consider introducing electric vehicles to markets where regulations mandate them or where the infrastructure is best suited for them. \"EVs do have many challenges,\" said Executive VP Takahiko Ijichi. \"But different countries and regions have different energy policies, and depending on infrastructure availability, we would like to have a structure that allows us to consider the introduction of EVs.\" Previously, Toyota were against the idea of pure electric vehicles due to their high costs, limited driving range and lengthy recharging times - things which have started to change recently in the industry. Still, the automaker is far from ready to give up their position on hydrogen fuel cells, as reported by Autonews. \"If you ask the question - What is the ultimate environmentally friendly vehicle? - we'll say it will be fuel cell vehicles. And our idea has not changed,\" added Ijichi, before admitting that as one of the biggest automakers in the world, Toyota must cover all alternative drivetrains, which include battery-powered electric vehicles. These comments came shortly after a Japanese newspaper reported that Toyota was planning to jump into mass producing long-range EVs by the year 2020, cars that will be able to cruise more than 300 km (186 miles) on a single charge.

Environmentalists had constructed an interest called “the environment” and then advocated for it in the same way that the insurance industry or the auto industry or the labor movement advocated for its interests. \nThat insight is all the more important today. Trump may build better roads and airports and the trains, as the old saw goes, might run on time. He might even lead a nuclear renaissance. But no amount of clean energy or infrastructure is worth forfeiting what remains of our civic and democratic culture. \nFurther, it is difficult to imagine a democratic path toward an ecomodern future that does not successfully address the twin challenges of immigration and multiculturalism on the one hand and deindustrialization on the other. These challenges are bedeviling advanced developed economies all over the world and represent the underlying crisis of the post-industrial economy and polity. Democracy, civil society, and the environment all demand that we not retreat back to our silos to advocate for the narrow technical, regulatory, and bureaucratic solutions in which we have become expert. \nMidwest Energy News : FirstEnergy Continues Push to Have Ratepayers Prop Up Its Credit Rating \nIn addition to recent moves to seek re-regulation to limit competition in Ohio’s electricity markets and to back out of a major contract for half a million customers, FirstEnergy told state regulators this week that more than $200 million in annual charges wasn’t nearly enough to prop up the company’s credit rating. \n“It can hardly be disputed that the Companies and their corporate parent face a challenging future,” FirstEnergy’s filing said. “They have credit ratings at or near the bottom of the investment grade range.” \nCritics say FirstEnergy’s dilemma stems from bad business decisions that consumers should not have to pay for. \nJalopnik : Trump Takes Credit for Keeping Lincoln Plant in America That Wasn’t Going to Leave \nBarely a week after his election and two months from even taking office, President-elect Donald J. Trump is already making America great again by keeping American jobs in America. You know it’s true because he told us so on Twitter! There tonight, Trump bragged of negotiating with Ford to keep a Lincoln plant from moving from Kentucky to Mexico. Problem is, he’s full of shit, as always. These plants -- there’s two of them -- were never going to Mexico. \nWindpower Offshore : Denmark Agrees PSO Deal \nhe government has finally agreed a deal in the long-running dispute over the public service obligation (PSO) support system, paving the way for the 350MW nearshore and 600MW Kriegers Flak offshore wind projects. \nThe PSO will be phased out gradually between 2017-2022, providing long-term stability for the projects' developer Vattenfall. \n\"The agreement creates certainty about the financing of Denmark's green transition [and] strengthens the competitiveness of Danish industry, giving the Danes a cheaper electricity bill and paves the way for using more green power in Danish society,\" the Danish energy ministry said.",

      "text": "Toyota 86 Gets High Performance Package, Solar Orange Limited Edition In Japan | By Share Not wanting to fall behind the Subaru twin , Toyota has followed a similar pattern with the 86 in its home market. Equipped with the same features as the Subaru BRZ Performance Package in the United States and the BRZ GT in the Land of the Rising Sun, the Toyota 86 GT Limited High Performance Package adds Sachs performance dampers, Brembo Brakes and 17-inch alloy wheels. Prices for the six-speed manual gearbox variant kick off from 3,394,440 Yen ($31,510), while the six-speed automatic can be had from 3,461,400 Yen ($32,135). Based on the GT version, the Toyota 86 Solar Orange Limited Edition adopts the obvious exterior paint job, along with Alcantara upholstery, orange stitching, Grand Luxe fabric dashboard trim and heated seats. Toyota is charging 3,251,880 Yen ($30,190) for the six-speed manual gearbox model, and 3,318,840 Yen ($30,810) for the automatic version. Both are scheduled to launch in Japan on March 10, with the order books opening on January 31. Additionally, buyers of the Solar Orange Limited Edition can also specify their cars with the High Performance Package, as well as the front underbody cover and rear wing, at an extra cost.

      "text": "Gallery: 2016 Los Angeles Auto Show Debuts \nThere were a plethora of new debuts during the past three days in Los Angeles, some noteworthy and others less so. To help you find the best of the best, we, the elite minds that are the Daily News Autos team, each picked our favorite premiere. \nWe’ve cars that are sporty, stylish, powerful and even, believe it or not, a family SUV (regular readers can probably guess who’s behind that one). So yes, there really is something for everyone. \nCheck out our picks here . The Toyota C-HR is finally ready for production First Pictures: 2018 Toyota C-HR \nThis time it’s for real: Toyota has once again brought its C-HR crossover to the Los Angeles Auto Show, but now the stylish SUV is really ready for the road. Curvy, sleek and sporty, the 2018 C-HR does not disappoint. \nC-HR stands for Coupe High-Rider and Toyota certainly takes that moniker seriously, offering a bevy of performance orient specs that promise to make its latest crossover as enjoyable to drive as it is to look at. It also offers an impressive array of standard safety features, including automatic braking, lane departure warnings with steering assistance and pedestrian detection. \nRead more about the C-HR here . Jeep debuts redesigned Compass First Pictures: 2017 Jeep Compass \nFor as well documented as the C-HR’s development and arrival were, Jeep’s latest offering caught us a little off-guard this year in the sense that we, like others, thought the Compass redesign was slated for the 2018 model year. Not so, however: Jeep will offer both the current and next generation Compasses for 2017. \nIf you’re on the fence between the two, something tells me you won’t be for long. The redesigned 2018 looks great and promises ample off-road capabilities, especially in the top-of-the-line Trailhawk trim. Jeep has even taken steps to improve safety, the biggest knock we had against last year’s Compass. \nRead more about the redesigned Compass here . Tesla shareholders approve SolarCity deal \nYou know it’s an auto show week when Tesla occupies the five spot in the Daily Drive-Thru, but here we are. The electric car company is now, as Bloomberg put it, officially a clean-energy company as shareholders signed off on its $2 billion acquisition of solar panel-maker SolarCity yesterday. \nMore than 85 percent of shareholders voted in favor of the merger that at one point faced opposition from some investors who felt Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk and other insiders were merely trying to bail themselves out of a bad SolarCity deal. Perhaps Musk’s solar roof presentation last month swayed some voters. \nSource: Bloomberg \nCheck the Daily Drive-Thru every weekday morning to get the latest on the most important news and trends in the automotive world. \nYou can find Thursday’s installment of the Drive-Thru here and view the rest of our archives here . \nGot a news tip or a comment?

      "text": "Eager to speed its electric vehicle development, Toyota is assigning a special internal task force responsible for EV know-how. A \"virtual organization,\" as Toyota calls it, it will consist of only four people, each brought in from one of the core companies involved in Toyota's electric vehicle resources to brainstorm together.\nIn addition to representatives from Toyota Industries Corporation and Toyota Motor Corporation, there will be a person from transmission manufacturer Aisin Seiki, of which Toyota holds a 30-percent share, and Denso Corporation, of which Toyota owns by 25 percent. Denso produces hybrid powertrain components, as well as ignition parts and electronics.\nThe idea of the virtual in-house venture is that its small structure allows more \"out of the box\" style of thinking, free from any organizational restraints that can slow down a bigger company's thought and work processes. Easily compared to the principles of lean manufacturing, Toyota wants to introduce the right vehicle at the right time, and by having a lean management that could be achieved. As TMC's president Akio Toyoda puts it, \"As a venture company that will specialize in its field and embrace speed in its approach to work, it is my hope that it will serve as a pulling force for innovation in the work practices of Toyota and the Toyota Group.\"\nFuel cell vehicles are still a top priority for Toyota, despite contradictory claims from other manufacturers: for instance, Jaguar Land Rover's technical design director Wolfgang Ziebart has recently gone to the lengths of describing hydrogen powered fuel cell vehicles as \"complete nonsense\" , due to their \"well-to-wheel\" relationship regarding efficiency. A battery electric vehicle, as Ziebart says to Autocar , has a 70 percent well-to-wheel efficiency as electricity is directly stored in its battery; in comparison, a hydrogen fuel cell vehicle can only manage 30 percent efficiency due to having to create electricity from hydrogen, which in turn has to be produced, compressed and cooled.\nHowever, in Toyota Motor Company's statement, hydrogen fuel cell vehicles are considered \"the ultimate eco-car\", due to their range and fueling times, as they do not have to sit still at a charging point, as compared to a battery electric vehicle.",

      "text": "Dew Tour adds Adaptive Competition to Breckenridge event, presented by Toyota \nNovember 18, 2016 By Hayley Helms \nNovember 17, 2016 (CARLSBAD, Calif.)– Mountain Dew® and TEN: The Enthusiast Network announced today that they will be adding a men’s and women’s adaptive snowboarding competition to the reimagined Dew Tour ski and snowboard competition and winter festival coming to Breckenridge Ski Resort, Colo. on December 8 – 11. \nDew Tour’s Adaptive Competition, presented by Toyota, in partnership with Adaptive Action Sports, will take place on Thursday, December 8. \nAlready confirmed to attend is Toyota’s star adaptive snowboarding athlete Amy Purdy. Adaptive Action Sports, the action sports organization co-founded by Purdy and her husband Daniel Gale, has partnered with TEN and Toyota to be involved in every step of the competition from the course buildout to the contest details. \n“We are so grateful to have an ongoing partnership with Toyota who believes in inclusion and innovation which is a key to our success. We also couldn’t be more excited to have Dew Tour as a platform to share the sport we are so passionate about with the world,” said Purdy. \n“Not only will Dew Tour give us the opportunity to share these amazing athletes and stories with the world but to also show what is possible in each and every one of us.” \n“We are beyond excited to collaborate with Toyota, Adaptive Action Sports and Breckenridge Ski Resort to bring an adaptive competition to Dew Tour for the first time,” said Adam Cozens, Vice President and GM of Dew Tour. \n“This great addition is part of our bigger vision at TEN to reimagine the Dew Tour by creating compelling action sports events that celebrate the sports and the athletes through style, creativity and inclusiveness. And this is just the beginning as we hope to continue to incorporate more adaptive competition in future Dew Tour events.” \nDew Tour’s Adaptive Competition presented by Toyota will bring 23 of the best adaptive snowboarding athletes in the world to Breckenridge Ski Resort to compete individually in a banked slalom course. Each competitor will take three single runs with their final score based on their fastest time. The women’s adaptive snowboard final will take place at 11:30 am MDT and the men’s competition will follow starting at 12:45 pm MDT. For fans tuning in to dewtour.com, recap coverage of the adaptive competition will be highlighted, along with a spot on the NBC TV special airing on December 24. \nDew Tour and Toyota will also be giving back to Adaptive Action Sports all weekend long by donating 10 dollars each time an event-goer takes a Toyota out for a spin at the Toyota’s Ride N’ Drive event taking place at the Blue River Plaza in downtown Breckenridge as part of the Dew Tour Festival. \nMore details on Dew Tour’s winter event in Breckenridge will be revealed over the coming weeks. Stay tuned at DewTour.com and on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat and YouTube @DewTour.

      "text": "- Published: 4:00 AM, November 19, 2016 \nErfoud ( Morocco) — Toyota’s Hilux is arguably the king of pickups, having established its cockroach-like indestructibility long ago, but Nissan’s latest version of its Navara pickup is the pretender to the throne and eager to prove as much. \nWe first drove it in Singapore, and found it handles the increasingly bumpy roads and ever-present speed humps with stoic stability. But the raison d’etre of a pickup is work, and the Navara can carry a tonne of cargo (or tow 3.5 tonnes of it), thanks to its powerful twin-turbo, 2.3-litre diesel engine, which makes short work of Singapore’s roads. \nTo put it through its paces, we were invited to Morocco to tackle sand dunes in the Sahara Desert. Erg Chebbi is one of two Saharan ergs in Morocco (“erg” means dune sea) and spans more than 300 sq km. Its dunes, which can reach heights of 150m, are among the highest in the world. \nSURF’S UP \nRiding high dunes in a two-tonne production pickup truck may not sound like a good idea, but it is actually not that difficult. The first thing is to take a lesson from the real ship of the desert: A camel’s toes are wide, flat pads that spread their weight across the sand. We do likewise by lowering the truck’s tyre pressure to create a flatter and larger contact patch. \nTo keep traction and forward motion in deep sand, the truck needs to skim across, spinning the tyres, using momentum to “float” across the top. \n“You need to move like a snake as it goes over the sand,” said our instructor, rally driver Carlos Herrera, from Portugal. He should know, as a four-time participant in the legendary Paris-Dakar Rally, which included a stage that passed by Erfoud and the dunes. \n“You need to do everything gently so you don’t get stuck. If you brake hard, you’ll dig the wheels in and get stuck. If you turn or work the steering too much, you’ll also dig in again.” \nDunes are shaped by the wind, but when it comes to driving on them, the experience is more akin to steering a boat. The vehicle suffers a slight delay in response to driver input, much like controlling a boat. Climbing dune crests, for instance, requires you to lift off the throttle a car length or two before you peak, while also maximising momentum so that you don’t get stuck churning sand going uphill. \nThe Navara makes the job of navigating the massive dunes easier, thanks to its seven-speed automatic transmission and tall seating position. It does not just stop at the four-wheel drive, but also has features like a locking differential that helps improve traction. \nNAVARA NAVIGATOR \nOnce you do get the hang of it, it is tremendous fun, riding the troughs and crests like waves, skimming across ridges and finding the line of least resistance by avoiding lateral slides and looser sections of sand. The intensely blue sky makes it feel even more like surfing or sailing, except that your “board” is a two-tonne truck. \nBut it was not just smooth sailing on sand alone. The drive, part of an event run by Nissan Europe to showcase the adaptability of its trucks and commercial vehicles, took us from the town of Erfoud and covered more than 180km with more than half of the route on mixed, off-road conditions. \nWhile the Navara is a much more focused machine than a consumer Sport Utility Vehicle (SUV), Nissan says part of the appeal of the latest model is its familiarity. It borrows many features you would otherwise see in a normal SUV, such as an infotainment system, driver displays and independent rear suspension. Importantly for the driving in the desert — and Singapore — it has a powerful climate control system. \nThe pickup tackled the varied off-road conditions with ease. At one point, we hit 100kmh-plus on hard clay topped with loose soil, but it also behaved remarkably car-like and refined on Morocco’s well-kept tarmac roads. \nOwning such a versatile machine in Singapore requires a Category C COE, as it is sold as a commercial vehicle. But it is a true working-class hero in ways crossovers can only dream of. While SUVs merely borrow the off-road image and need to be taken with a pinch of salt, you can easily take the Navara with a desert’s worth of sand and still keep going. Derryn Wong \nNissan Navara Double Cab A.T. \nEngine: 2,298cc, in-line four, turbodiesel, 190hp, 450Nm \nPerformance: 180kmh, 0-100kmh: 10.8s, 6.9L/100km, 156g/km CO2 \nPrice: S$140,900 with COE \nPROS: Makes tough going easy, a real workhorse \nCONS: Needs a Cat C COE",

      "title": "2017 Toyota Tacoma TRD Pro First Drive",
      "text": "2017 Toyota Tacoma TRD Pro First Drive Going Pro: Toyota’s Top Tier Tacoma   97 Photos When Ford’s F-150–based Raptor landed in showrooms in late 2009, the pickup industry shifted forever. The factory-built performance off-road truck was an immediate hit, often selling for thousands of dollars more than sticker price and flying off of dealer lots faster than they could even get them off the delivery truck. Up until this point, every pickup manufacturer had a form of “off-road” package, which typically comprised of “upgraded” shocks, skidplates, and stickers at best. These often performed adequately, but left a lot to be desired. However, Raptor was the proverbial game-changer. It proved that the public not only wanted a true desert racing-inspired off-road truck but that they were willing to clamber over each other and spend money hand-over-fist to get one. Toyota, being no stranger to off-road racing, jumped into the factory performance off-road craze a couple years later, in 2012, with the Tacoma TRD T/X Baja edition. The T/X Baja was a limited edition, with only 1,500 being produced between the ’12 and ’14 model years. These trucks came equipped with 60mm (2.4-inch) Bilstein coilover shocks up front and 50mm (2-inch) Bilstein monotube shocks in the rear. Ride height was increased by nearly 2 inches, and wheel travel increased by 1 inch in the front and 2 1/2 inches in the rear. For ’15 the name changed to TRD Pro and production numbers increased. All of the functional bits remained the same, while a few cosmetic upgrades graced the exterior. Tundra and 4Runner also got the TRD Pro treatment for ’15, rounding out the family of off-roaders. Tacoma was fully redesigned for ’16, and due to the complexity of launching an all-new truck, we said goodbye to the TRD Pro Tacoma. Fortunately, Toyota isn’t keeping us waiting any longer and has reintroduced and all-new and significantly updated Tacoma TRD Pro edition for the ’17 model year. Photo 2/97 | 2017 Toyota Tacoma Trd Pro Familiar Underpinnings If the ’17 Tacoma TRD Pro looks and feels familiar, that’s because it is. The truck’s frame, cab, bed, and drivetrain are all your typical Tacoma fare. Under the hood is Toyota’s new 3.5L Atkinson Cycle D4S V-6, which churns out 278 hp and 265 lb-ft of torque. Mated to the engine is your choice of six-speed automatic or manual transmissions. If fuel economy matters to you the manual transmission version will net 17 mpg city and 20 mpg on the highway, while the automatic returns 18 mpg city and 23 mpg highway. Four-wheel drive is the only drive option, and the transfer case gives a 2.57:1 low range. Axle gearing is 4.300:1 for manual trucks and 3.909:1 for automatics. For those looking for a smaller truck, we’re sorry: Double Cab is the only option for TRD Pro. Photo 3/97 | 2017 Toyota Tacoma Trd Pro Engine Go–Fast Bits What really makes the Tacoma TRD Pro special is what lies beneath the body. For ’17 Toyota paired up with renowned desert racing shock manufacturer Fox, a departure from Bilstein on the previous TRD Pro Tacoma. The new dampers are 2 1/2-inch internal bypass units that are specifically tuned by TRD for the Tacoma. The shocks feature an aluminum body for impeccable cooling and corrosion resistance; hardened and oversized shafts; and protective and redundant dust boots. The front coilovers use Fox’s Internal Floating Piston (IFP) technology, while the rear utilizes a traditional piggyback reservoir. All of the shocks are position-sensitive, utilizing internal bypass valves that create five compression and three rebound zones in the front and seven compression and four rebound zones in the rear. TRD-tuned Eibach coil springs provide 1 inch of front lift, while progressive-rate leaf springs from the TRD Off-Road models support the rear. Compensating for the softer shock valving, spring rate, and ride height is a front anti-sway bar that has been increased in size from 28 mm to 30 mm. Off-Road Chops Toyota designed the ’17 TRD Pro Tacoma to do two things, off-road well and look good doing it. In addition to the Fox racing shocks, the Tacoma TRD Pro also sports Crawl Control and Multi-Terrain Select, both new on the ’16 Tacoma TRD Off-Road, and Hill Start Assist. Sorry manual transmission fans, these features are only available on the automatic-equipped trucks. Fortunately, regardless of transmission, all TRD Pros also get an electric locking rear differential and Toyota’s Automatic Limited-Slip Differential (Auto LSD) technology.   97 Photos Photo 4/97 | 2017 Toyota Tacoma Trd Pro Wheels Goodyear’s Kevlar-reinforced Wrangler All-Terrain Adventure tires in a 265/70R16 size (about 30 1/2 inches in diameter) adorn each corner, along with TRD Pro–exclusive black alloy wheels with an offset designed to increase track width by an inch over the standard TRD Off-Road. Fog lights from Rigid Industries light up the night with ultra-bright LEDs while remaining legal in all 50 states. For those hard hits, a skidplate constructed of ¼-inch aluminum protects the vital bits at the front of the truck. And thanks to its special front bumper and lack of a lower valance, the TRD Pro Tacoma touts an impressive 36-degree approach angle. Departure angle is 24 degrees, with the standard trailer hitch being the first thing to hit, and breakover is 26 degrees, making for a pickup that you can actually take off-road without tearing up the bumpers and rockers. Style Points There’s an old saying that says looks aren’t just one thing, they are everything. We would disagree, but fortunately, in addition to all of the function, the TRD Pro Tacoma has it in the form department as well. On the inside we find heated leather-trimmed seats, which are embossed with the TRD Pro logo. The steering wheel and shift knob are also trimmed in leather, and accented with red stitching. In an interesting love it or leave it move, black is the only interior color option. Outside we find a custom grille, bumper, and black-accented projector headlamps with LED daytime running lights. The TRD Pro’s hood comes by way of the TRD Sport and features a blacked out scoop along with black accent graphics. Out back are black-accented taillights and TRD’s stainless steel exhaust. Toyota is offering the ’17 TRD Pro in three colors: Cement, Barcelona Red Metallic, and Super White.",

      "text": "Medium Large \nWhat is it: The C-HR (Coupe High Rider) is Toyota ’s entry into the burgeoning compact tall hatchback segment. Expect it to do battle in the showrooms against Honda’s HR-V. \nWhy does it matter? The C-HR marks a shift away from conventional CUV design like that found in the RAV-4 and moves Toyota into the murky realm of quasi-CUV’s like the Mercedes GLA, Buick Encore and Nissan Juke. It’s a growing segment in Canada and one that captures much sought after younger buyers. \nThe bones of the C-HR are a 144-horsepower 2.0L four-cylinder backed by a CVT transmission and a FWD drivetrain. Toyota bills the C-HR as being inspired by sports car design and to that end you can slap the CVT transmission into sport mode which allows you to shift up and down between seven simulated gears. The car cleverly designed with the rear door handle hidden in the C-pillar. \nAccording to designers, the C-HR features a driver-centric “Me-Zone” interior with a 60/40 folding rear seat. Sound deadening is applied generously throughout. \nWhen is it coming to Canada? We can expect to see the C-HR in Toyota showrooms around late spring of next year. \nShould you buy it? If you find a RAV-4 to be too practical and frumpy and don’t mind sacrificing AWD, the C-HR could be for you. In the style-conscious tall-hatchback market, the C-HR is the freshest design among the HR-V and aging Buick Encore. The C-HR also comes with Toyota’s sterling reputation for quality and reliability.

      "text": "  \nNissan has its Juke, Honda has its HR-V, Mazda has its CX-3, and now Toyota has its C-HR . The subcompact crossover segment is larger than ever, and Toyota, one of the world’s largest automakers, has arrived fashionably late. At the 2018 Toyota C-HR’s L.A. auto show debut, we got a closer look at what could be Toyota’s next hot seller among younger buyers. \nStanding for Coupe-High Rider, the C-HR takes after the popular trend of “coupifiying” crossovers by using narrower windows, low-slung rooflines, highly raked rear glass, blacked-out B-pillars, and high beltlines to name a few styling cues. \nAutomakers have had success with this form-over-function philosophy as we have seen with the Mercedes-Benz GLE Coupe , BMW X6, and Range Rover Evoque. Now, Toyota is following the Nissan Juke’s lead and bringing this trend to budget crossovers. As we learned from the C-HR’s project director in our First Drive of the European hybrid model , most compact crossover owners only ride with one other person, making the need for rear seat room less of a priority for these vehicles. \nToyota stylized the C-HR to be unique, sexy, muscular, and edgy; the crossover knows it’s a latecomer and wants to stand out from the crowd. The “Diamond”-themed styling takes aim at professional millennials who are active and enjoy the latest in technology and trendsetting. The slim headlights wrap deep into the crossover’s toned shoulders almost to the front quarter panel, giving it a wider and more aggressive look. Deep, curvaceous lines run from the Toyota badge on the grille, then along the sides below the windows and continue above the rear wheel and taper into the high beltline and very thick C-pillar. Prominent wheel arches house the extra-large standard 18-inch wheels, increasing the girth of this small four-door. The C-HR’s rear tapers in and features distinctive lines, 3D taillights, and a double spoiler on the hatch giving it a futuristic look. \nStyling was not the only aim for the C-HR — Toyota promises it will deliver thrilling driving dynamics with impressive comfort. Built on the adaptable Toyota New Global Architecture ( TNGA ), the C-HR takes full advantage of the platform’s inherent low center of gravity, and high-strength, lightweight construction. After years of developing the C-HR’s driving performance on challenging roads and tracks, Toyota increased structural rigidity by adding additional spot welds, gussets, braces, and adhesive on specific areas, resulting in improved handling. The front comes equipped with Sachs dampers and a large front stabilizer bar while the rear has a new double-wishbone suspension with Sachs shocks and upper urethane supports. This design not only aids in increased agility, according to Toyota, but passenger comfort and cabin quietness as well. The driver-centric interior resembles the layout of many sports cars, thanks to the wish of project director Hiro Koba. \nToyota equipped the C-HR with a 144-hp 2.0-liter inline-four engine mated to a redesigned continuously variable transmission (CVT) that is said to improve acceleration and fuel economy while reducing cabin noise. In Sport mode, the CVT simulates a traditional seven-speed automatic, shifts through the simulated gears faster, and keeps the engine at higher speeds for enhanced acceleration. The driver can also choose to shift through the seven simulated gears at will by pushing the gearshift lever to the left. \nWe’ll found out if Toyota’s efforts to imbue the C-HR with sportiness and style pay off when we drive the U.S.-spec model ahead of its arrival in spring 2017.

      "text": "toyota electric car special unit logo More Toyota is shifting position on all-electric cars. Toyota Motor Corporation has formed a small, in-house group to fast-track electric car development, as reported by Reuters .\nThe new unit, which launches in December, will be responsible for electric car development and marketing strategy and will draw on other corporate resources. Starting with four people, the team will pull in engineers, designers, and any other needed personnel.\nMore: Will Toyota change course and build a mass-market electric car?\nToyota spokesperson Itsuki Kurosu said, “Regulations on lower emissions vehicles are changing very quickly, so we also have to respond quickly. With its small size, the new venture will be able to be more nimble in its planning and decision making, to speed up the process to develop electric cars.”\nThe initial four team members will come from Toyota itself and three other Toyota group entities, including machine manufacturer Toyota Industries Corporation and parts suppliers Aisin Seiki Company and Denso Corporation.\nConsistent with its earlier pledge that all Toyota vehicles will be emissions-free by 2050, the company is now preparing to move forward with full-sized all-electric vehicles. Previously Toyota’s focus has been on hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles (FCVs). Earlier this month, however, the company said it was considering coming to market with all-electric cars. Japan’s largest automaker had also said before that it would continue its success with hybrids because of their greater range and because of the high price of batteries and the long charging times for all-electric vehicles.\nCompetitors Nissan and Volkswagen have been committed to all-electric cars as the best option for zero-emissions vehicles going forward. While Toyota has been working on short-distance, ultra-compact electric vehicles, it has stayed away from all-electrics. With yesterday’s announcement, however, the corporate focus has shifted. Part of that decision may have been influenced by positive market pressure for electric cars and by the long timeline for FCVs.\n“The company’s position is changing,” CASA analyst Chris Richter said, “They still talk about hybrids and fuel cells but I think there is a recognition that battery electric cars are getting a lot of traction right now. It’s going to take an awful long time before fuel cells are a competitive alternative to electric vehicles. In the meantime, a lot of things are going on right now (with battery electric cars) and they need to be there.”\nWill Toyota change course and build a mass-market electric car? How Volkswagen plans on putting a million electric cars on the road by 2025 Can Fisker beat Tesla with state-of-the-art battery tech and butterfly doors?",

Photo: Facebook/ Auður Gísladóttir The New Paper Saturday, Nov 19, 2016 \nAn Icelandic woman was saved by four Singaporeans after her car turned turtle in an accident in icy road conditions. \nBut she could not remember anything about the Singaporeans or the dramatic rescue on a road about 40km east of the capital Reykjavik on Tuesday. The rescue was caught on video. \nWhen she finally saw the video, shot by one of the four Singaporeans who helped, she said she cried. \nMiss Audur Gisladottir, 21, who works in a nail salon, was on her way to meet a friend in Hverageroi, a town in the south of Iceland when the accident happened. \nShe can remember listening to US band Korn as she drove in her red 2008 Toyota Yaris behind a big truck that day. \nMiss Gisladottir told TNP: \"I was driving at 90kmh when I suddenly lost control of the car and hit a sign. \n\"I think the car rolled three times and I broke the window with my head.\" In the video, Mr Muhammad Nasir can be heard urgently instructing his friends in a mix of English and Malay. Facebook: Auour Gisladottir \nThe car landed on its roof at the road side, with Miss Gisladottir hanging upside down from her seat, held up by her seat belt. \nShe said: \"I got a big wound on my head, a lot of broken glass went inside of my body and I sprained my back and neck.\" \nShe was admitted to the hospital for nine hours and did not suffer any long-term injuries. \nThe Singaporeans saw her car overturn and rushed to help, as she screamed. \nShe said: \"I kind of remember everything except after the car stopped. I do not remember screaming and crying like in the video.\" ",

      "text": "The 2017 Toyota Prius Prime won the best buy in Electric/Hybrid Category from the Kelley Blue Book Best Buy Awards. Toyota Prius Prime \nThe Japanese plug-in hybrid beat more than 300 models because of its great fuel economy, and 640 miles of combined range (including 25 miles all-electric), but most importantly priced from just $27,950 …making the plug-in cost less than the base Prius model after the $4,500 federal credit is applied. \n“Of more than 300 new-car models available for 2017, Kelley Blue Book’s expert editors narrowed the field to 12 major vehicle categories evaluating the finalists head-to-head to ultimately determine the winners. The awards are the culmination of a year-long evaluation of nearly every new vehicle available in America. \nThe 2017 Prius Prime is doing what no hybrid has ever done before delivering 640 miles of total full-charge/full-tank driving range, 25 miles of pure electric range and a 133 MPGe rating that’s the highest of any electric car currently available, making it the most efficient car in America. With a revolutionary design, advanced technology such as the 11.6-in. HD multimedia display and a well-documented history of reliability and low ownership costs, there is no question why the Toyota Prius Prime was chosen as the Electric/Hybrid Best Buy of 2017.” \nNathan Kokes, advanced technology vehicle manager, Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc. said: \n“When we set out to build the 2017 Prius Prime, we wanted to deliver a car that would live up to the idea of the word ‘Prime,’ – a plug-in hybrid vehicle with no compromises. With the new Prius Prime, Toyota has delivered the most efficient car in America and we are thrilled to receive the Electric/Hybrid Best Buy Award from Kelley Blue Book,” 2017 Toyota Prius Prime \nJack R. Nerad, executive editorial director and executive market analyst, Kelley Blue Book said: \n“With 90 years of trust in providing the auto industry with data and decades of providing car shoppers with valuable information, Kelley Blue Book takes great pride in identifying the new vehicles that our experts believe to be the absolute best-value choices for new-car shoppers and the new 2017 Prius Prime indisputably takes first place with its innovation and efficiency for the Electric/Hybrid category,”.",

      "text": "  \nAfter announcing recently that it is open to the idea of making electric cars , Toyota is putting its money where its mouth is. It has decided to establish an in-house venture company responsible for developing electric vehicles. It will be staffed by four people. How’s that for making a commitment? Hot pink Toyota i-Road charging in Grenoble, France. Credit: Electric Cars Report \nToyota’s approach is the ultimate in streamlining the design process. The four will come from Toyota Industries Corporation, Aisin Seiki Company, Ltd, Denso Corporation, and Toyota Motor Company. The organization is a “virtual organization.” Called a “venture company,” it will operate outside of all internal structural organizations within the four participating companies. Kickoff is scheduled for December. \nThe venture company will draw on all the technological resources of the Toyota Group. The small organizational structure is meant to promote unconventional working procedures. That should help the project to move along swiftly and bring products to market in the shortest possible time. \nUp until now, Toyota has been a steadfast proponent of fuel cell vehicles (aided by a big push from the Japanese government). In terms of cruising range, hydrogen fueling times, and other considerations, Toyota believes FCEV’s offer convenience equal to conventional internal combustion vehicles. That makes them the “ultimate eco-car” as far as Toyota is concerned \nThat’s the theory. The reality is that unless Toyota jumps into the deep end of the electric car pool soon, it risks seeing market share flee to other car companies in the very near future. Commenting on the establishment of the new venture company, Toyota president Akio Toyoda told the press, \n“Over these past few years, which we have positioned for strengthening our planting of seeds for the future. We have taken such measures as establishing the Toyota Research Institute, made Daihatsu a fully owned subsidiary, and have begun work to established an internal company responsible for compact vehicles for emerging markets. \n“The new organizational structure for EVs is a part of this effort. As a venture company that will specialize in its field and embrace speed in its approach to work, it is my hope that it will serve as a pulling force for innovation in the work practices of Toyota and the Toyota Group.” \nThe approach is novel and innovative. But will it be too little too late for Toyota? Every other car manufacturer has at least a two year head start. Tesla is now 6 years ahead, based on work on the Model S began. Make haste, Toyada-san. Tempes fugit .",

      "text": "Toyota says testing Mirai fuel-cell vehicle in China Thu Nov 17, 2016 10:40pm EST [ - ] Text [ + ] \nGUANGZHOU, China (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T: Quote ) is testing its Mirai fuel-cell vehicle in China, the head of the Japanese automaker's China business, Hiroji Onishi, said on Friday at the Guangzhou auto show. \nToyota has promoted fuel cell vehicles as the most sensible next-generation option to hybrids but a lack of hydrogen fuelling stations poses a major hurdle for mass consumption. \nMirai, which means \"future\" in Japanese, is a four-person sedan first introduced in 2014 that has a range of 300 miles, and is Toyota's first mass-market fuel cell car. \nWhile China is pushing electric technology and hoping its homegrown brands can close a competitive gap with global rivals, Japan is investing heavily in fuel-cell technology, aiming to foster what it calls a 'hydrogen society', where the zero-emission fuel would power homes and vehicles. \n(Reporting by Jake Spring; Writing by John Ruwitch; Editing by Himani Sarkar and Edwina Gibbs) © Thomson Reuters 2016 All rights reserved.

      "text": "Email \nCLIMAX, Mich. -- A West Michigan man bought a 2005 Toyota Prius because it’s built to last, and it has for the most part. After years of maintenance and careful care, there’s an issue this car owner says he shouldn’t have to pay to fix after the Toyota dealership told him they knew the problem existed 11 years ago. They are still insisting the owner has to pay to correct it. \nFeeling cheated, he turned to the FOX 17 Problem Solvers. \nConsumer Reports named the Prius the number one most reliable car of 2016. It’s so reliable, in fact, that many of the older models are still going strong after hundreds of thousands of miles. Apparently, Toyota didn’t count on them reaching 300,000 miles, because as Jim Burgess found out you won’t see it reach that milestone on the odometer. \nJim Burgess’ 2005 Prius was nothing short of reliable for several years. He averaged about 30,000 miles a year traveling up to northern Michigan for backpacking trips, and down to Pennsylvania to visit family. \n“Just keeping up with the oil changes and the maintenance on it is all I’ve ever done to it. If you take care of them right they seem to go forever,” said Burgess. \nBurgess was on a recent journey to Pennsylvania to see family with a milestone in sight. \n“I wanted to take a picture of the odometer at 300,000 miles so at 299,999 I kept on waiting and kept on waiting, and I said 'Surely I have been a mile?' Then after I kept tracking the mile markers I knew it wasn’t going to turn over,” said Burgess. \nBurgess turned to Google only to find out this has happened to other people with various models of Toyotas. He called Toyota up thinking it was something they would replace for free. \n“They told me I should back to my dealership and have them do a diagnosis, and if they won’t help you out to call them back” said Burgess. \nBurgess said the dealership quoted him a $556 charge to fix the odometer. They offered him a discount, but he refused to pay it because he said it's Toyota's fault. \n“As a matter of fact, I talked to the guy at the dealership, and he said the new one we stick in there is going to do the same thing,” said Burgess. \nBurgess called Toyota back to see about them covering a real fix, telling us Toyota wouldn't pay for it because the issue was past the 9-year warranty. A warranty for a problem that Burgess was never alerted about in the first place. \n“Who is going to have 299,999 miles when it’s still under warranty? It just doesn’t make sense. It’s not a transmission that wears out, it’s not tires that wear out, it’s not ball joints that wears out it’s a computer program,” said Burgess. \nFOX 17 reached out to Toyota they sent us some answers over e-mail, and on the phone. \nFirst, they said they no longer install odometers that stop right before 300,000 miles, now they go to 1 million. Toyota claims the faulty odometer is only in 2005 models of the Prius, Corolla, and Corolla Matrix. They said they don’t have to issue a recall on the problem because it’s not a safety issue. \nToyota has offered other people the opportunity to fix their odometer for free, but in Burgess’ case he won’t be offered that. Toyota considers this a maintenance issue like changing oil or replacing tires. They said people should contact their dealership and it will be decided on a case-by-case basis if they can give you a break on the cost. \nFor reasons Toyota would not disclose, he was offered a $200 discount on the repair, and the company thinks that is fair enough. \n“There are several issues at stake when you can’t track your mileage. My tires happen to be under warranty but I have to have mileage proof to show they are under warranty. I have to have oil changes on time; that’s how this car has lasted this long,” said Burgess. \nAll things he won’t be able to do unless he forks over the nearly $400 he will have to pay to repair. All for an issue he said is no fault of his own. \nIf you have a 2005 Prius, Corolla, or Corolla Matrix and find yourself in this same situation Toyota said you should contact Toyota Motor Sales directly at 1.800.331.4331 rather than their dealer.",

      "text": "Toyota target Lappi clinches WRC2 title with Australia win 358 views By: David Gruz , Editorial assistant 20/11/2016 03:36 Esapekka Lappi, who has been strongly linked to a spot in Toyota's WRC programme next year, took the 2016 WRC2 crown following a dominant win in Rally Australia. \nThe Skoda factory driver topped 21 out of 23 stages and beat runner-up Nicolas Fuchs by more than four and a half minutes. \nLappi, who was fourth in the series last year, had a slow start to his 2016 campaign as he lost the chance to win in Sweden after a spin and went off road in Italy to only take ninth. \nHe led Rally Poland early on before dropping down due to mechanical issues but Lappi revitalized his campaign by dominating both in Finland and Germany. \nHe won in Wales as well, which put him 13 points behind joint leaders Elfyn Evans and Teemu Suninen before the final round. \nAs both of the aforementioned drivers already entered the maximum allowed seven rallies, Lappi was the only title contender to go to Australia. \n\"I feel relieved and really, really happy. Everyone in our team deserves the title, they have worked hard with the Fabia R5 for the past three years and they gave me the best car,\" said Lappi. \n\"Okay, we had some bad luck this year, but we ended with four wins in a row. \n\"This [Australia] wasn't an easy event - I was driving against myself and had to motivate myself in a different way. \n\"There were some rough sections today [Sunday], but otherwise we kept up the speed to stay concentrated and have a good feeling.\" \nM-Sport's Evans and Suninen, who was himself recently linked with Toyota , ended up second and third in the standings ahead of Lappi's Skoda teammates Jan Kopecky and Pontus Tidemand.

      "text": "This 2017 Toyota Tacoma TRD Pro is Ready To Go And it's dealership equipped! twitter.com/evanyates_ instagram.com/evan__yates \nOverlanding means different things to different people. To some, it’s trans-continental travel spanning multiple months, even years. For others, it’s simply taking their trusty rig to the mountains for a relaxing weekend away from the city. The common denominator is vehicle dependent travel with the ultimate goal of simply connecting with the outdoors. \nMost overlanding vehicles are weathered to say the least - and for good reason. The amount of abuse these robust rides endure is extensive and ultimately takes its toll in the form of scratches, dents and abrasions. With that in mind, it’s quite rare to stumble upon one of the most sacred, sought-after vehicles in the overlanding community out in the wild; fully-equipped and prepped for the trails. \nLast weekend, I attended a ride with the No Limits Overland crew and Expedition Georgia ( more on that later ). In the midst of this meet-up, a brand spankin’ new 2017 Toyota Tacoma TRD Pro pulled up and everyone’s eyes got a little bigger. Even to the untrained eye, this rig is impressive but to those in the know, it currently holds holy-grail status as far as factory-equipped vehicles go. Expedition Georgia \nShut down the parking lot. \nThe owner, Bobby Hall of Myrtle Beach, SC, hopped out and immediately began greeting everyone. He woke up at five am that morning to make the trek to North Georgia. It didn’t take long to notice that this particular Toyota was heavily equipped with all the latest gear available. Bobby was more than willing to go over his modifications with in-seat tutorials and was both humble and proud of his rig. This warmth and generosity seems to be an underlining theme in the overlanding community. Expedition Georgia \nAnother immediately apparent aspect of this particular Pro is the factory color, which Toyota named 'Cement'. This subtle tone is simply mesmerizing in person. The paint doesn’t appear to have a lick of metallic which further implies it means business and its prime purpose is functionality - it just so happens it's attractive, too. To contrast the subdued body hue, the grille, bumper inserts, fender flares and hood scoops are all coated in a sultry satin black. Thankfully, the door handles and mirrors are painted to match the body reminding you this ain't a cheap truck. Expedition Georgia \nBefore we move forward, it’s important to look back first. Toyota released the Tacoma TRD Pro in December 2015 and two days later, Bobby placed an order for one. The vehicle was in such high demand, he didn’t even receive the Tacoma until September 21, 2016. That’s nine excruciating months of anticipation. During the delay, Bobby’s garage temporarily transformed into a parts warehouse for the Tacoma. Patiently waiting, he took those nine months to select and stockpile all the latest parts for the build. \nTo the casual observer, it may appear that someone with such an expensive, exclusive vehicle is simply a guy with a boatload of money that clicked away on his Macbook Pro to build the ultimate overland vehicle. However, that couldn’t be further from the truth. This isn’t Bobby’s first rodeo with overland Tacomas. He’s had plenty of experience that ultimately lead him towards his most recent purchase(s). Bobby’s previous vehicle was a 2007 Tacoma TRD Sport that he fully-equipped for pretty much any obstacle thrown its way. Not new to this life. Bobby Hall Bobby Hall Bobby Hall \nBefore Bobby and his wife, Hannah, got married, the 2007 Tacoma was put to the test via a 40-day, 11,000-mile excursion. From South Carolina, the duo worked their way across New Orleans, to the Grand Canyon, Sequoia National Park and ended up in Huntington Beach, CA. Bobby used that time to discover through trial and error what equipment he liked and disliked, needed and didn’t need. \nBobby attributes his passion for overlanding and Toyota to his wife, whose affinity for the culture and the brand fully transferred over to him. Oh, and she also bought the TRD Pro for Bobby while they were still engaged. So while they were planning a wedding, Bobby was ordering parts. Expedition Georgia \nFor Bobby, the appeal of the new Tacoma TRD Pro was its capability straight from the factory. One of the most important lessons Bobby learned from his 2007 Tacoma was that with all the major upgrades he added, the truck lost considerable gas mileage and the warranty was voided in a heartbeat. \n“I liked the Pro because it’s the best of both worlds,” says Bobby. “It’s lifted from the factory, you still get good gas mileage and you get to keep your warranty.” He continues, “Plus, if you let Toyota add all your accessories, they’ll warranty it - including the tires!” \nThat last statement may come as a surprise as it’s quite the opposite of a typical dealership experience. We’ve all been to dealerships that can’t wait to blame aftermarket products on totally unrelated issues. Knowing that there are dealerships eager to get involved with builds such as this one is encouraging and hopefully, this practice rubs off on others. \nBobby’s 2017 Tacoma TRD Pro was purchased from Sparks Toyota in Myrtle Beach, SC, who literally installed every piece of equipment he brought them. Both parts and service went above and beyond the call of duty and if they didn’t know something about the product, they did their research and figured it out. Hey, car dealers, pay attention! Expedition Georgia \nThe modification list for Bobby’s Pro is extensive and everything serves a specific purpose. Are some of the items primarily for worst-case scenarios? Sure, but that doesn’t make them a waste of money or the truck any less capable. \nAs you'll see at the very bottom, the modification list for this 2017 Tacoma TRD Pro is extensive. And while all of the items serve a purpose, the list could get a bit overwhelming. With that in mind, here are Bobby's top three mods to the truck: 1. Goose Gear Drawer System \nIt may sound simple, but having your items stored in an organized manner is of the utmost importance. Unloading all of your gear just to find something at the bottom of the pile is not only inefficient, it could get you in some real trouble if the conditions aren’t ideal. 2. CVT Roof Top Tent \nBobby purchased a roof top tent mainly to get off the ground and away from animals. Thankfully, the CVT tent also afforded them outstanding protection from the elements, ease of use and extreme comfortability compared to a ground-based tent. 3. CBI Armor \nEspecially with a newer, nicer vehicle, keeping it protected is paramount. Not to say a couple battle scars aren’t cool but you certainly don’t want to completely damage your vehicle if it’s possible to avoid. Bobby says his CBI sliders and rear bumper have saved him from severe, expensive damage to the truck already on multiple occasions. Expedition Georgia \nPlays well with others. \nThe future for this Tacoma is open-ended. The next few mods on the list are rock lights inside the CBI tire swing, Magnuson Supercharger (as soon as it’s released) and Nitro 4.88 gears. Bobby and wife also plan on attending the FJ Summit in July 2017 with the TRD Pro and another big expedition with the folks from Goose Gear in August 2019.

      "text": "toyota c hr More The 2018 Toyota C-HR took a long and convoluted route to its U.S. debut at the 2016 Los Angeles Auto Show this week. It debuted as a concept car just over two years ago, and was originally supposed to be sold here under Toyota’s now-defunct Scion “youth” brand . Now that it’s finally here, is the C-HR worth the wait?\nC-HR stands for “Coupe High-Rider,” although this subcompact crossover does have four doors. Toyota tried to camouflage the rear pair by shrinking the rear window, and making a big crease that almost separates the rear wheels from the rest of the body. It’s all part of a fairly extroverted design that also includes slim headlights, protruding taillights, and a low, sloping roofline. It’s Toyota latest attempt to shake its reputation for boring cars.\nMore: Ford’s EcoSport SUV makes its North American debut\nUnderneath the wildly creased sheet metal, the C-HR rides on the same Toyota New Global Architecture platform used by the Prius hybrid . As with the Prius, Toyota tried to imbue the C-HR with sporty handling characteristics. It even took the little crossover to the Nürburgring, the infamous German racetrack that’s become a measuring stick for high performance cars.\nThe C-HR is far from the most powerful car to show up at the Nürburgring, though. In the U.S., the only available engine will be a 2.0-liter four-cylinder, with 144 horsepower and 140 pound-feet of torque. A continuously variable transmission (CVT) will be mandatory as well. Toyota did include a Sport mode that allows manual shifting with seven simulated gears (because CVTs are fearless), and sharpens throttle response.\nToyota says the interior was designed around a “MeZONE” theme that emphasizes the driver. The 7.0-inch central display screen, for example, is positioned on top of the dashboard rather than in it because, Toyota claims, it requires less eye movement from the driver. All C-HR models also come standard with Toyota Safety Sense P , a bundle of safety systems including autonomous emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, lane departure alert with steering assist, and automatic high beams.\nThe 2018 Toyota C-HR goes on sale in the U.S. next spring, with pricing to be announced closer to the launch date.\nAfter many twists and turns, Toyota’s 2018 C-HR will appear in LA Lexus’ UX concept has ‘kinetic’ seats and holographic displays",

      "text": "LOS ANGELES, CA: Toyota capped off this year’s media days at the LA Auto show by unveiling the 2018 C-HR compact crossover. C-HR stands for Coupe High Rider and will arrive in Toyota dealerships in the spring ushering a new contender into the red-hot Canadian compact CUV segment.\nIt actually appeared for the first time one year ago at the LA show as the Scion C-HR concept. With the demise of the Scion brand, the C-HR is back as a Toyota.\nThe C-HR is very highly styled in what the brand terms “Distinguished Diamond” looks starting from the nose with slim projector headlights which stretch back well over the top of the front fenders augmented by largish standard 17-inch and optional 18-inch alloy wheels.\nThe inside carries through the edgy styling with its “MeZone” driver oriented cabin with diamond patterns throughout featuring dual-zone climate control and a seven-inch infotainment touchscreen raised high on the centre stack. This is augmented by a color 4.2-inch driver info display between the two main gauges in the instrument cluster.\nIt will be powered by a 2.0-litre direct injection inline four-cylinder producing 144 hp and 139 lb/ft of torque on regular fuel with consumption figures yet to be announced.\nD-HR is front engined with front drive and a CVT transmission. AWD is not available.\nSuspension is a new MacPherson strut setup at front with a double wishbone rear system featuring rear shocks with urethane upper supports, a first for Toyota.\nThe CVT, with seven-speed sequential manual shift mode has a Sport setting at “steps up” ratio changes.\nC-HR will be fitted with a full suite of driver/safety features including, as standard, Toyota Safety Sense P (TSS-P) which is a multi-feature advanced active safety suite bundles cutting edge active safety technologies including Pre-Collision System with Pedestrian Detection function (PCS w/PD) featuring forward collision warning and Automatic Emergency Braking, Lane Departure Alert with Steering Assist function (LDA w/SA), Automatic High Beams (AHB), and Full Speed Dynamic Radar Cruise Control (DRCC).\nWhen it arrives in the spring, C-HR will be offered in two trim levels – XLE and XLE Premium with pricing to be announced when it goes on sale.\nJim Robinson is an automotive writer for Metroland Media",

This is followed by the fuel cell buses that will be launched by early 2017, ahead of the Tokyo 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games. \nIn line with the automaker's plan to realize a hydrogen-based society in the future Toyota is now exploring on the heavy-duty hydrogen fuel cell application in California, with the aim of creating a potential zero-emission freight transportation for the future. \nApart from these, however, Toyota declined to provide any more details regarding the study and the continued evolution of a hydrogen society. Instead, they said that further details will be announced in the coming months. Related Articles",

      "text": "Toyota North EDSA Service Center offers 1-hour Express Maintenance Text: / Photos: Brent Co  19 One hour service, from reception to releasing at newly opened TNESC in Valenzuela \nThe Oben Group of Companies recently inaugurated their new Toyota North EDSA Service Center (TNESC) along Mindanao Avenue Extension in Valenzuela City. \nThe TNESC, a first of its kind in the Asia Pacific Region, provides a guaranteed one hour service time from reception to releasing. This allows a shorter waiting time for its clients, which is in favor of today's bustling lifestyle. \nIt also boasts a first class receiving and waiting lounge, car wash per bay, three technicians per vehicle, a state of the art CCTV camera per bay so customers can check their vehicles each step while waiting at the lounge, as well as an array of services to fit the car maintenance requirements. \n“In my 16 years of working in our Toyota dealerships I have commonly observed that the bottleneck of the service process is in the carwash stage because of the idle time in queueing and its distance from the work bay. With a new layout of having a carwash bay for every service lane/work bay, it completely removes the bottleneck and idle time – and this totally cuts the delay in service lead-time delivery to out customers,” said Cosco Oben, president of TNESC. \nAs a basic procedure for the facility, TNESC ensures the efficiency of the three stages of maintenance:(1) Reception and Receiving, wherein the service advisor communicates with the customer and assess the vehicle; (2) Production Bay, wherein three technicians work per vehicle ensuring the normal 1.5 hour reduced to thirty minutes production time; and (3) Washing Bay, wherein the car gets wash and assess at the same time. \nThe washing process takes approximately ten minutes. Meanwhile, an additional ten minutes to finish the Documentation Transaction from Billing and Payment. The car and the customer, along with the Service Advisor, will then meet at the Exit Area, cutting down the guaranteed time of one hour service. \nThe TNESC encourages its customers to set an appointment beforehand so that they could immediately be accommodated by the front lines or service advisors once they enter the facility.

      "text": "Blog This Toyota GAZOO Racing experienced a disappointing end to the 2016 FIA World Endurance Championship (WEC) season in the 6 Hours of Bahrain. TOKYO, Nov 21, 2016 - (JCN Newswire) - Toyota GAZOO Racing experienced a disappointing end to the 2016 FIA World Endurance Championship (WEC) season in the 6 Hours of Bahrain.The #5 TS050 Hybrid of Anthony Davidson, Sebastien Buemi and Kazuki Nakajima was the lead Toyota in fourth, just the third time this year that the team has missed out on the podium.Stephane Sarrazin, Mike Conway and Kamui Kobayashi in the #6 car began the race with an outside chance of the drivers' World Championship, but fifth place was not enough to overhaul the Porsche #2 crew of Romain Dumas, Neel Jani and Marc Lieb.The #6 crew finished the season a creditable third in the drivers' standings, 15 points behind the champions, with their #5 counterparts 8th following a series of misfortunes this year.Toyota's finally tally from the nine-race season stands at one win, seven podium finishes and 229 points with the TS050 Hybrid, earning third position in the manufacturers' World Championship.Today's race represented Audi's final appearance in the championship. The team marked the occasion by displaying messages on both TS050 Hybrids and presenting a commemorative banner to the Head of Audi Motorsport, Dr Wolfgang Ullrich.When the race got under way, Kamui in the #6 fought hard with #7 Audi but could not stay ahead, instead he put pressure on from fifth with Sebastien just behind in the sister car.The Porsche #2 suffered a puncture after almost one hour, elevating the #5 to fourth place, with the #6 now in fifth as the sun set and darkness took hold at the Bahrain International Circuit.The order stayed that way through the first half of the race, as track temperatures dropped slightly in the darkness. But after the halfway point, the two TS050 Hybrids swapped position several times, both in the pits and on track.The #1 Porsche remained out of reach in third place despite consistent efforts from all Toyota drivers as the end of the race approached.When the chequered flag fell, Sebastien crossed the line in fourth place, a lap behind the winning Audi #8. Mike followed 38.685secs later to complete a frustrating weekend.The team's focus will now switch to 2017 preparations, with an intense pre-season testing schedule to fine-tune an updated TS050 Hybrid in time for the opening race, at Silverstone on 16 April.Those preparations begin already on Sunday with a two-car test session in Bahrain, which also sees promising LMP2 driver Pipo Derani test the TS050 Hybrid as part of the WEC's rookie driver initiative.Toshio Sato, Team President:\"We were hoping for more from this race. We gave everything to stand on the podium again but our speed was not enough compared to Audi's exceptional performance. Not only was this the final race of a tough season but today we also said goodbye to a great competitor. We will miss competing as three manufacturers in LMP1. Congratulations to Audi for bringing their WEC era to an end with a deserved victory, and congratulations also to the Porsche #2 drivers on becoming World Champions. We will now focus on 2017, when we will come back stronger and ready to fight at the front.\"TS050 Hybrid #5 (Anthony Davidson, Sebastien Buemi, Kazuki Nakajima)Race: 4th, 200 laps, 6 pit stops. Grid: 6th. Fastest lap: 1min 42.867secsAnthony Davidson:\"It was a frustrating race for us. We gave it everything but we didn't quite have the speed to challenge for the podium. It's a sad way to end the season but it's not been a great year for car #5 so I am pleased to see the back of it. I want to say congratulations not only to the Porsche #2 drivers but also to Audi. It was a very impressive display which sets the standard for next season.\" Sebastien Buemi:\"In the last race of the season I am pleased for Audi that they win with a one-two. We would have loved to have been on the podium but we didn't have the pace today. We were hoping to give a better opportunity for car #6 to fight for the drivers' championship but it wasn't to be this weekend.\"Kazuki Nakajima:\"Firstly well done to the Porsche #2 drivers and big congratulations to Audi for the one-two. For us it was a difficult race because we didn't have the pace to fight at the front; Audi were basically untouchable. The car felt okay to drive and I was happy enough with it; I think we did a decent job.\"TS050 Hybrid #6 (Stephane Sarrazin, Mike Conway, Kamui Kobayashi)Race: 5th, 200 laps, 6 pit stops. Grid: 5th. Fastest lap: 1min 43.096secsStephane Sarrazin:\"I'm a bit sad to finish the season off the podium. It was a difficult race for us; we didn't feel good with the car. Audi did an incredible job so well done to them. Well done also to Porsche #2. We were really fast since Mexico, with some very good results and a big highlight with the win at Fuji. All the team did a great job; we enjoyed this year together and for me it was still a positive season.\"Mike Conway:\"It was a tough day really. We thought it would be very close and we would be able to fight but Audi were so strong, it was impressive. Congratulations also to the Porsche #2 guys. Towards the end of the race it got really difficult with so much rubber stuck in the front of the car; I lost a lot of front grip. The team has plenty to be proud of this season so we will look back on the positives.\"Kamui Kobayashi: \"Congratulations to Audi for winning their last race in WEC and of course Porsche #2 won the title so well done to them. We had a good fight with them all season right until the last race but unfortunately we couldn't do it today. It's a pity to end with fifth place but we didn't have the performance here that we hoped for. We are frustrated with this race but we will come back stronger.\"6 Hours of Bahrain results:1st #8 Audi (di Grassi / Duval / Jarvis) - 201 laps 2nd #7 Audi (Fassler / Lotterer / Treluyer)- +16.419secs 3rd #1 Porsche (Bernhard / Webber / Hartley) - +1min 17.001secs 4th #5 Toyota GAZOO Racing - +1 lap 5th #6 Toyota GAZOO Racing - +1 lap 6th #2 Porsche (Dumas / Jani / Lieb) - +3 lapsAbout ToyotaSupported by people around the world, Toyota Motor Corporation (TSE: 7203; NYSE: TM), has endeavored since its establishment in 1937 to serve society by creating better products.

      "text": "Toyota earns first manufacturer's title in Cup, ending Chevrolet's streak 287 views By: Jim Utter , NASCAR Editor 21/11/2016 01:57 Lost in the shuffle Sunday night at Homestead-Miami Speedway was an important NASCAR milestone for Toyota Racing. Kyle Busch’s sixth-place finish in the Sprint Cup Series finale at Homestead-Miami Speedway allowed Toyota to win its first manufacturer’s championship in the Cup series in its 10th season of competition. Toyota drivers won 16 of the 2016 season’s 36 races and two of its drivers on its way to the manufacturer’s crown, which snapped Chevrolet’s streak of 13 consecutive titles. “Capturing our first Cup Series manufacturer’s title is a tremendous accomplishment, and one that has been a goal for Toyota since entering the series 10 years ago as underdogs in this ultra-competitive series,” said Ed Laukes, Vice President of Integrated Marketing Operations for Toyota Motor Sales (TMS), USA. “With the partnership of great teams like Joe Gibbs Racing and Furniture Row Racing, Toyota has been able to breakthrough and become the first different manufacturer to earn this championship in 13 seasons. “We’re proud of the effort put forth by each of our Toyota teams, and all of the Toyota team members that have allowed us to reach this goal.” A season to remember for Toyota Joe Gibbs Racing collected 12 of the wins while newcomer to the Toyota camp, Furniture Row Racing, added four more. Busch and Martin Truex Jr. led the group with four wins a piece, followed by Carl Edwards (three), Denny Hamlin (two) and Matt Kenseth (two). Toyota also had two drivers competing for the series championship in Sunday night’s season finale – Busch and Edwards. Toyota has now won manufacturer’s titles in all three NASCAR national series – Cup, Xfinity and Trucks. Toyota driver Daniel Suarez won the 2016 Xfinity championship on Saturday night. \nToyota first entered NASCAR competition in the Trucks series in 2007. Since joining the Cup series, Toyota has won 95 races and 90 poles in 360 races. Be part of something big Your email address",

      "text": "Frustrating Finale for Toyota GAZOO Racing Frustrating Finale for Toyota GAZOO Racing TOKYO, Nov 21, 2016 - (ACN Newswire) - Toyota GAZOO Racing experienced a disappointing end to the 2016 FIA World Endurance Championship (WEC) season in the 6 Hours of Bahrain.\nThe #5 TS050 Hybrid of Anthony Davidson, Sebastien Buemi and Kazuki Nakajima was the lead Toyota in fourth, just the third time this year that the team has missed out on the podium.\nStephane Sarrazin, Mike Conway and Kamui Kobayashi in the #6 car began the race with an outside chance of the drivers' World Championship, but fifth place was not enough to overhaul the Porsche #2 crew of Romain Dumas, Neel Jani and Marc Lieb.\nThe #6 crew finished the season a creditable third in the drivers' standings, 15 points behind the champions, with their #5 counterparts 8th following a series of misfortunes this year.\nToyota's finally tally from the nine-race season stands at one win, seven podium finishes and 229 points with the TS050 Hybrid, earning third position in the manufacturers' World Championship.\nToday's race represented Audi's final appearance in the championship. The team marked the occasion by displaying messages on both TS050 Hybrids and presenting a commemorative banner to the Head of Audi Motorsport, Dr Wolfgang Ullrich.\nWhen the race got under way, Kamui in the #6 fought hard with #7 Audi but could not stay ahead, instead he put pressure on from fifth with Sebastien just behind in the sister car.\nThe Porsche #2 suffered a puncture after almost one hour, elevating the #5 to fourth place, with the #6 now in fifth as the sun set and darkness took hold at the Bahrain International Circuit.\nThe order stayed that way through the first half of the race, as track temperatures dropped slightly in the darkness. But after the halfway point, the two TS050 Hybrids swapped position several times, both in the pits and on track.\nThe #1 Porsche remained out of reach in third place despite consistent efforts from all Toyota drivers as the end of the race approached.\nWhen the chequered flag fell, Sebastien crossed the line in fourth place, a lap behind the winning Audi #8. Mike followed 38.685secs later to complete a frustrating weekend.\nThe team's focus will now switch to 2017 preparations, with an intense pre-season testing schedule to fine-tune an updated TS050 Hybrid in time for the opening race, at Silverstone on 16 April.\nThose preparations begin already on Sunday with a two-car test session in Bahrain, which also sees promising LMP2 driver Pipo Derani test the TS050 Hybrid as part of the WEC's rookie driver initiative.\nToshio Sato, Team President:\n\"We were hoping for more from this race. We gave everything to stand on the podium again but our speed was not enough compared to Audi's exceptional performance. Not only was this the final race of a tough season but today we also said goodbye to a great competitor. We will miss competing as three manufacturers in LMP1. Congratulations to Audi for bringing their WEC era to an end with a deserved victory, and congratulations also to the Porsche #2 drivers on becoming World Champions. We will now focus on 2017, when we will come back stronger and ready to fight at the front.\"\nTS050 Hybrid #5 (Anthony Davidson, Sebastien Buemi, Kazuki Nakajima)\nRace: 4th, 200 laps, 6 pit stops. Grid: 6th. Fastest lap: 1min 42.867secs\nAnthony Davidson:\n\"It was a frustrating race for us. We gave it everything but we didn't quite have the speed to challenge for the podium. It's a sad way to end the season but it's not been a great year for car #5 so I am pleased to see the back of it. I want to say congratulations not only to the Porsche #2 drivers but also to Audi. It was a very impressive display which sets the standard for next season.\"\nSebastien Buemi:\n\"In the last race of the season I am pleased for Audi that they win with a one-two. We would have loved to have been on the podium but we didn't have the pace today. We were hoping to give a better opportunity for car #6 to fight for the drivers' championship but it wasn't to be this weekend.\"\nKazuki Nakajima:\n\"Firstly well done to the Porsche #2 drivers and big congratulations to Audi for the one-two. For us it was a difficult race because we didn't have the pace to fight at the front; Audi were basically untouchable. The car felt okay to drive and I was happy enough with it; I think we did a decent job.\"\nTS050 Hybrid #6 (Stephane Sarrazin, Mike Conway, Kamui Kobayashi)\nRace: 5th, 200 laps, 6 pit stops. Grid: 5th. Fastest lap: 1min 43.096secs\nStephane Sarrazin:\n\"I'm a bit sad to finish the season off the podium. It was a difficult race for us; we didn't feel good with the car. Audi did an incredible job so well done to them. Well done also to Porsche #2. We were really fast since Mexico, with some very good results and a big highlight with the win at Fuji. All the team did a great job; we enjoyed this year together and for me it was still a positive season.\"\nMike Conway:\n\"It was a tough day really. We thought it would be very close and we would be able to fight but Audi were so strong, it was impressive. Congratulations also to the Porsche #2 guys. Towards the end of the race it got really difficult with so much rubber stuck in the front of the car; I lost a lot of front grip. The team has plenty to be proud of this season so we will look back on the positives.\"\nKamui Kobayashi:\n\"Congratulations to Audi for winning their last race in WEC and of course Porsche #2 won the title so well done to them. We had a good fight with them all season right until the last race but unfortunately we couldn't do it today. It's a pity to end with fifth place but we didn't have the performance here that we hoped for. We are frustrated with this race but we will come back stronger.\"\n6 Hours of Bahrain results:\n1st #8 Audi (di Grassi / Duval / Jarvis) - 201 laps\n2nd #7 Audi (Fassler / Lotterer / Treluyer)- +16.419secs\n3rd #1 Porsche (Bernhard / Webber / Hartley) - +1min 17.001secs\n4th #5 Toyota GAZOO Racing - +1 lap\n5th #6 Toyota GAZOO Racing - +1 lap\n6th #2 Porsche (Dumas / Jani / Lieb) - +3 laps\nAbout Toyota\nSupported by people around the world, Toyota Motor Corporation (TSE: 7203; NYSE: TM), has endeavored since its establishment in 1937 to serve society by creating better products.

      "title": "Frustrating Finale for Toyota GAZOO Racing",
      "text": "  11:08 AM EST Frustrating Finale for Toyota GAZOO Racing \nTOKYO,   Toyota GAZOO Racing experienced a disappointing end to the 2016 FIA World Endurance Championship (WEC) season in the 6 Hours of Bahrain. \nThe #5 TS050 Hybrid of Anthony Davidson, Sebastien Buemi and Kazuki Nakajima was the lead Toyota in fourth, just the third time this year that the team has missed out on the podium. \nStephane Sarrazin, Mike Conway and Kamui Kobayashi in the #6 car began the race with an outside chance of the drivers' World Championship, but fifth place was not enough to overhaul the Porsche #2 crew of Romain Dumas, Neel Jani and Marc Lieb. \nThe #6 crew finished the season a creditable third in the drivers' standings, 15 points behind the champions, with their #5 counterparts 8th following a series of misfortunes this year. \nToyota's finally tally from the nine-race season stands at one win, seven podium finishes and 229 points with the TS050 Hybrid, earning third position in the manufacturers' World Championship. \nToday's race represented Audi's final appearance in the championship. The team marked the occasion by displaying messages on both TS050 Hybrids and presenting a commemorative banner to the Head of Audi Motorsport, Dr Wolfgang Ullrich. \nWhen the race got under way, Kamui in the #6 fought hard with #7 Audi but could not stay ahead, instead he put pressure on from fifth with Sebastien just behind in the sister car. \nThe Porsche #2 suffered a puncture after almost one hour, elevating the #5 to fourth place, with the #6 now in fifth as the sun set and darkness took hold at the Bahrain International Circuit. \nThe order stayed that way through the first half of the race, as track temperatures dropped slightly in the darkness. But after the halfway point, the two TS050 Hybrids swapped position several times, both in the pits and on track. \nThe #1 Porsche remained out of reach in third place despite consistent efforts from all Toyota drivers as the end of the race approached. \nWhen the chequered flag fell, Sebastien crossed the line in fourth place, a lap behind the winning Audi #8. Mike followed 38.685secs later to complete a frustrating weekend. \nThe team's focus will now switch to 2017 preparations, with an intense pre-season testing schedule to fine-tune an updated TS050 Hybrid in time for the opening race, at Silverstone on 16 April. \nThose preparations begin already on Sunday with a two-car test session in Bahrain, which also sees promising LMP2 driver Pipo Derani test the TS050 Hybrid as part of the WEC's rookie driver initiative. \nToshio Sato, Team President:\"We were hoping for more from this race. We gave everything to stand on the podium again but our speed was not enough compared to Audi's exceptional performance. Not only was this the final race of a tough season but today we also said goodbye to a great competitor. We will miss competing as three manufacturers in LMP1. Congratulations to Audi for bringing their WEC era to an end with a deserved victory, and congratulations also to the Porsche #2 drivers on becoming World Champions. We will now focus on 2017, when we will come back stronger and ready to fight at the front.\" \nTS050 Hybrid #5 (Anthony Davidson, Sebastien Buemi, Kazuki Nakajima)Race: 4th, 200 laps, 6 pit stops. Grid: 6th. Fastest lap: 1min 42.867secs \nAnthony Davidson:\"It was a frustrating race for us. We gave it everything but we didn't quite have the speed to challenge for the podium. It's a sad way to end the season but it's not been a great year for car #5 so I am pleased to see the back of it. I want to say congratulations not only to the Porsche #2 drivers but also to Audi. It was a very impressive display which sets the standard for next season.\" \nSebastien Buemi:\"In the last race of the season I am pleased for Audi that they win with a one-two. We would have loved to have been on the podium but we didn't have the pace today. We were hoping to give a better opportunity for car #6 to fight for the drivers' championship but it wasn't to be this weekend.\" \nKazuki Nakajima:\"Firstly well done to the Porsche #2 drivers and big congratulations to Audi for the one-two. For us it was a difficult race because we didn't have the pace to fight at the front; Audi were basically untouchable. The car felt okay to drive and I was happy enough with it; I think we did a decent job.\" \nTS050 Hybrid #6 (Stephane Sarrazin, Mike Conway, Kamui Kobayashi)Race: 5th, 200 laps, 6 pit stops. Grid: 5th. Fastest lap: 1min 43.096secs \nStephane Sarrazin:\"I'm a bit sad to finish the season off the podium. It was a difficult race for us; we didn't feel good with the car. Audi did an incredible job so well done to them. Well done also to Porsche #2. We were really fast since Mexico, with some very good results and a big highlight with the win at Fuji. All the team did a great job; we enjoyed this year together and for me it was still a positive season.\" \nMike Conway:\"It was a tough day really. We thought it would be very close and we would be able to fight but Audi were so strong, it was impressive. Congratulations also to the Porsche #2 guys. Towards the end of the race it got really difficult with so much rubber stuck in the front of the car; I lost a lot of front grip. The team has plenty to be proud of this season so we will look back on the positives.\" \nKamui Kobayashi: \"Congratulations to Audi for winning their last race in WEC and of course Porsche #2 won the title so well done to them. We had a good fight with them all season right until the last race but unfortunately we couldn't do it today. It's a pity to end with fifth place but we didn't have the performance here that we hoped for. We are frustrated with this race but we will come back stronger.\" \n6 Hours of Bahrain results:1st #8 Audi (di Grassi / Duval / Jarvis) - 201 laps 2nd #7 Audi (Fassler / Lotterer / Treluyer)- +16.419secs 3rd #1 Porsche (Bernhard / Webber / Hartley) - +1min 17.001secs 4th #5 Toyota GAZOO Racing - +1 lap 5th #6 Toyota GAZOO Racing - +1 lap 6th #2 Porsche (Dumas / Jani / Lieb) - +3 laps \nAbout Toyota \nSupported by people around the world, Toyota Motor Corporation (TSE: 7203; NYSE: TM ), has endeavored since its establishment in 1937 to serve society by creating better products.

For the Sporting Class, Miko Maristela had topped the list with a scant three-point lead over Sean Velasco, while Marc Martinez had been sitting atop the Promotional Class ahead of Aira Medrano. Completing the entrants for the leg was the Celebrity Class with Jinno Rufino ahead of Fabio Ide. \nAlthough the cloudy skies threatened to dampen the excitement heading into the final leg, the double points to be awarded at the end of the races certainly guaranteed some heated battles around the 4.2km racetrack. \nWhile most of the participants in the four classes tried to keep the racing clean and devoid of crashes, quite a few cars in the Sporting Class got too close for comfort on the asphalt, with radio DJ Sam YG’s No. 6 car taking most of the beating. While Sam was leading the first race, a competitor cut inside a corner the celebrity was taking, causing him to briefly lose control which resulted in him dropping down to second place. Although Sam was able to take back the lead later, his car was subjected to a bump-and-run—a racing technique where the car at the back intentionally bumps the car in front, causing the latter to lose control and giving the former the opportunity to overtake. The maneuver caused Sam to drop two places and finish the race in third place. As a concession, following the racing incident which cost Sam YG the lead, he was promoted to second place. \nWith the double points finish, TMP and race organizer Tuason Racing could only hand out provisional results at the end of the day, with the first race being topped by Fabio Ide (Celebrity Class), Arbie Jacinto (Promotional Class), Gerald Loy (Sporting Class). and Allan Uy (Super Sporting Class). The second race, meanwhile, was won by Ide, Kiko Dysico (Promotional Class), Steve Bicknell (Sporting Class) and Estefano Rivera (Super Sporting Class). \nChanges planned for 2017 season? \nAfter three successful seasons, Toyota Motor Philippines is reportedly planning to make some changes to its already exciting Vios Cup one-make racing series for the 2017 season. \nFirst and foremost, according to our source, would be to bring the new NR-series dual VVT-i engine into the mix. This motor was introduced on the updated Toyota Vios in July this year. One supposed reason for the move is that TMP has apparently stopped selling the Vios Cup race car with the previous NZ-FE mill to the teams as confirmed to us by an officer of one of the teams. This doesn’t necessarily mean that TMP will no longer support the teams that don’t want to use the updated Vios. Instead, TMP would run two separate classes for the Vios Cup—with one class catering to the race cars with the new engine, and the other class featuring race cars with the old mill. \nWe also asked our source about the long-rumored plan to make a Toyota 86 racing series. While our source confirmed that this had always been talked about, the cost of running it would be prohibitive and that the only way to make it work would be if a certain number of teams and drivers signed up for the series. \nAnother way proposed to make an 86 racing series would be to run it across the ASEAN region and promote motorsport tourism by attracting foreigners to fly to different countries in support of their national teams. \nBut perhaps the most significant development for the 2017 Vios Cup season would be the entry of Gazoo Racing as a title sponsor. For the uninitiated, Gazoo Racing is an independent racing outfit under Toyota’s banner, which aims to promote grassroots motorsport activities in the interest of attracting new generations of car enthusiasts. In April 2015, Toyota opted to run all its motorsports activities—namely, Toyota Racing, Lexus Racing and Gazoo Racing—under the Gazoo Racing banner. \nAccording to our source, officials from Gazoo Racing were at the recently concluded final leg of the 2016 Vios Cup to study how the local race series was run, and to get a feel for our local racing atmosphere. \nIf all these changes push through, the 2017 Vios Cup season may very well provide a much-needed shot in the arm for the ailing Philippine motorsport scene.",

      "text": "Target: James Lentz, CEO of Toyota \nGoal: Stop Toyota from using leather in its vehicles. \nAnimal rights organization PETA recently released videos of severe animal cruelty allegedly taking place on ranches that supply leather for Toyota. The videos show cows, bulls and calves being beaten, dragged, shocked and branded on the face. \nCalves were seen being dragged away from their mothers, branded on the face and forced into compact areas where they would often panic. The cattle were kept on the ranch until about 3 years old and it was clear the animals were severely neglected. Cows were seen with large, open wounds infested with maggots. At 3, the cows and bulls have their throats slit and are then skinned. \nSign this petition to demand Toyota make the compassionate change and start using vegan leather. Animals should not be tortured and killed for a car. \nPETITION LETTER: \nDear Mr. Lentz, \nRecently, animal rights organization PETA released footage of some of the cattle ranches where the leather for your cars is allegedly produced. The footage was shocking and difficult to watch. \nCows, bulls and calves were seen being beaten, dragged, shocked and branded all without the use of any painkillers. Large, open wounds were a common sight among the animals and some even had maggots crawling on them. After about three years of pain and misery, the animals have their throats slit and are then skinned. \nPlease consider using a vegan leather which would spare countless animals from unnecessary pain and death. The alternative materials are available and it is time to start utilizing them. \nSincerely,",
