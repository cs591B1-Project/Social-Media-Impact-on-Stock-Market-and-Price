      "text": "By Jennifer Booton, MarketWatch\nCook says Watch sales are 'off the charts,' confusingly rebuffing an IDC report that covered watch sales from a different quarter\nApple Chief Executive Tim Cook once again chose this week to offset negative news with a selective disclosure of limited material information to a single member of the media, a move that flirts with the boundaries of financial regulations and values short-term stock reaction over long-term investors.\nAfter IDC, a tracker of consumer electronics trends, published a report Monday showing a 71% plunge in Apple Watch shipments last calendar quarter (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/apple-watch-shipments-plunge-70-in-third-quarter-2016-12-05) that nearly halved Apple's (AAPL) share of the smartwatch market amid gains from competitors such as Garmin Ltd. (GRMN), Cook weighed in with an email to Reuters reporter Julia Love, claiming sales growth for Apple Watch has been \"off the charts\" (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/what-tim-cook-really-said-about-apple-watch-2016-12-06). That selective disclosure came after a nearly 1% decline in Apple shares in the wake of the IDC report Monday, and helped to reverse that decline and send Apple's shares higher in premarket trade (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/apples-stock-rallies-after-ceo-cook-tries-to-reassure-investors-2016-12-06)and nearly 1% into the green on Tuesday.\nCook declined to give specific sales data, but did say sell-through--a niche metric that measures how much product was sold to consumers as compared with the total product shipped to stores--hit a record during the first week of holiday shopping, and projected \"the best quarter ever for Apple Watch.\" While the statement seems to contradict the IDC report, the information is actually for two different quarters, with the period Cook is referencing coming after the release of Apple's Series 2 watch late in the third quarter and during the busy holiday shopping season, whereas IDC's report spans a three-month period ended Sept. 30, which includes the first two weeks of Series 2 sales.\n(https://accounts.icharts.net/icharts/embed/MH/UzilN)\nThe content of Cook's statement seems positive for investors, leading to headlines with some combination of the words \"record\" and \"Apple Watch sales,\" but is part of a pattern of vague details about the only product category introduced since Cook took the helm at Apple from Steve Jobs five years ago. For long-term investors, this is a concern: Sales trends that matter in the long run are being sugarcoated for short-term gain.\nFor an example, look at the last time Cook reacted in a similar manner. Last summer, Cook emailed a statement to CNBC's Jim Cramer (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/apple-ceo-tim-cook-may-have-violated-sec-rules-with-jim-cramer-email-2015-08-24) on a day when the Dow Jones Industrial Average suffered its worst decline in four years amid concerns about China's economy (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/us-stock-ends-volatile-session-with-steepest-losses-in-4-years-2015-08-24), claiming that Apple's sales were showing immunity to the headaches of China's economy. The email arrived as Apple was down more than 10%, but shares rallied into positive territory after CNBC publicized the statement, and investors hailed Cook as a hero saving them from outside factors.\nOnly investors planning to get out of the stock should have been cheering, though, because Apple wasn't immune to China's economic turn. Apple's sales in China fell 30% year-over-year from the fiscal fourth-quarter of 2015 to the same quarter in fiscal 2016 and 18% for the full fiscal year, leading to Apple's first-ever annual decline in iPhone sales (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/apple-faces-decade-of-uncertainty-after-next-years-iphone-2016-11-21). Apple's stock, meanwhile, has barely budged since then, rising just 6.5% to $109.95 as of Tuesday's closing price, from $103.12 on Aug. 24, 2015, the day of the Cramer disclosure. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, the 30-member index of which Apple is a part of, has climbed more than 21%.\nThe method of delivery for both these statements is worrisome as well. Apple did not follow Monday's statement with a press release nor post the information anywhere else, leaving it up to Reuters to disseminate that information and properly make sense of it so that investors were given the full context of Cook's statements in relation to the grim IDC data. Without full context, readers could be misled by the \"record Apple Watch sales\" headlines. Reuters, for example, did not point out (http://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-watch-idUSKBN13V0BT)that the IDC data and holiday sales data lauded by Cook reflect separate time periods.\n(https://sw.graphiq.com/w/4MNV1PLhyV7)\nThat type of disclosure enters into hazy territory with the Securities and Exchange Commission, as MarketWatch pointed out after the email to Cramer (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/apple-ceo-tim-cook-may-have-violated-sec-rules-with-jim-cramer-email-2015-08-24).\nAccording to the Securities and Exchange Commission's Regulation FD, which governs fair disclosures, the media is exempt from rules overseeing fair disclosure if the issuer of such information believes the outlet is large enough to ensure the disclosure will be widely disseminated. However, another part of Regulation FD raises questions about whether this is the best method the world's most valuable company should take when revealing potential market-moving information.\nAccording to the regulation, there is a \"responsibility on the issuer to choose methods that are, in fact, 'reasonably designed' to effect a broad and non-exclusionary distribution of information to the public.\" While delivering material financial information to one national media outlet may exempt Apple from SEC scrutiny because it will eventually be widely disseminated, its decision to disclose material information in an email without following up with a press release or an 8K filing may starve investors of context, thus potentially inflating the stock.\nLong-term investors should take these Cook emails with a grain of salt. Longer-term trends are much more an indication of how a product category is performing. IDC even made note of this in its report on Apple Watch shipments earlier this week, saying Apple's success \"will likely be muted as the smartwatch category continues to be challenged,\" even though Apple Watch may benefit in the near term from Black Friday promotions and people gifting devices for the holidays.\nThe SEC declined the opportunity to comment on this story. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment regarding why it chose this particular disclosure method.\nShares of Apple closed 0.7% higher to $109.92 on Tuesday as the market absorbed Cook's comments regarding record holiday sales of Apple Watch. They're down 7.6% in the past 12 months though, vastly underperforming the Dow Jones Industrial Average , which is up 8%.\n-Jennifer Booton;\n 0846ET\n ",

      "text": "By Jennifer Booton, MarketWatch\nCook says Watch sales are 'off the charts,' confusingly rebuffing an IDC report that covered watch sales from a different quarter\nApple Chief Executive Tim Cook once again chose this week to offset negative news with a selective disclosure of limited material information to a single member of the media, a move that flirts with the boundaries of financial regulations and values short-term stock reaction over long-term investors.\nAfter IDC, a tracker of consumer electronics trends, published a report Monday showing a 71% plunge in Apple Watch shipments last calendar quarter (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/apple-watch-shipments-plunge-70-in-third-quarter-2016-12-05) that nearly halved Apple's (AAPL) share of the smartwatch market amid gains from competitors such as Garmin Ltd.

That selective disclosure came after a nearly 1% decline in Apple shares in the wake of the IDC report Monday, and helped to reverse that decline and send Apple's shares higher in premarket trade (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/apples-stock-rallies-after-ceo-cook-tries-to-reassure-investors-2016-12-06)and nearly 1% into the green on Tuesday.\nCook declined to give specific sales data, but did say sell-through--a niche metric that measures how much product was sold to consumers as compared with the total product shipped to stores--hit a record during the first week of holiday shopping, and projected \"the best quarter ever for Apple Watch.\" While the statement seems to contradict the IDC report, the information is actually for two different quarters, with the period Cook is referencing coming after the release of Apple's Series 2 watch late in the third quarter and during the busy holiday shopping season, whereas IDC's report spans a three-month period ended Sept. 30, which includes the first two weeks of Series 2 sales.\n(https://accounts.icharts.net/icharts/embed/MH/UzilN)\nThe content of Cook's statement seems positive for investors, leading to headlines with some combination of the words \"record\" and \"Apple Watch sales,\" but is part of a pattern of vague details about the only product category introduced since Cook took the helm at Apple from Steve Jobs five years ago. For long-term investors, this is a concern: Sales trends that matter in the long run are being sugarcoated for short-term gain.\nFor an example, look at the last time Cook reacted in a similar manner. Last summer, Cook emailed a statement to CNBC's Jim Cramer (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/apple-ceo-tim-cook-may-have-violated-sec-rules-with-jim-cramer-email-2015-08-24) on a day when the Dow Jones Industrial Average suffered its worst decline in four years amid concerns about China's economy (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/us-stock-ends-volatile-session-with-steepest-losses-in-4-years-2015-08-24), claiming that Apple's sales were showing immunity to the headaches of China's economy.

Apple's sales in China fell 30% year-over-year from the fiscal fourth-quarter of 2015 to the same quarter in fiscal 2016 and 18% for the full fiscal year, leading to Apple's first-ever annual decline in iPhone sales (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/apple-faces-decade-of-uncertainty-after-next-years-iphone-2016-11-21). Apple's stock, meanwhile, has barely budged since then, rising just 6.5% to $109.95 as of Tuesday's closing price, from $103.12 on Aug. 24, 2015, the day of the Cramer disclosure. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, the 30-member index of which Apple is a part of, has climbed more than 21%.\nThe method of delivery for both these statements is worrisome as well. Apple did not follow Monday's statement with a press release nor post the information anywhere else, leaving it up to Reuters to disseminate that information and properly make sense of it so that investors were given the full context of Cook's statements in relation to the grim IDC data.

Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment regarding why it chose this particular disclosure method.\nShares of Apple closed 0.7% higher to $109.92 on Tuesday as the market absorbed Cook's comments regarding record holiday sales of Apple Watch. They're down 7.6% in the past 12 months though, vastly underperforming the Dow Jones Industrial Average , which is up 8%.\n-Jennifer Booton;\n 0857ET\n ",

      "text": "Reddit \nJapanese Apple rumor blog Macotakara has a new report today indicating that the successor to the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus will come in an all new color. The site says Apple will add a red casing color, joining the existing Black, Jet Black, Silver, Gold and Rose Gold options. Macotakara has a decent track record when it comes to reporting details about unreleased Apple products. It was the first site to say that Apple would remove the headphone jack with the iPhone 7. \nKGI has previously reported that Apple will introduce three new iPhones in 2017. This would include one majorly redesigned ‘iPhone 8’ with OLED display and no physical Home Button, as well as two iterative updates to the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. \nReconciling these rumors, it appears the Macotakara report is talking about the latter devices which it has dubbed iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus. \nHowever, unlike KGI, Macotakara says that the 7s series would not include features like wireless charging or a glass casing. It would be a straightforward internal component update, moving from the A10 chip to the A11 chip, alongside the introduction of the red color option for the exterior. \nKGI has recently said the opposite of this , indicating that wireless charging would be available on high-end and low-end 2017 iPhone models but the charger itself may not be bundled in the box. \nThe more-radical changes are expected for the premium iPhone 8 model, which will apparently feature an OLED display that wraps around the side of the phone. It has been described as bezel-less with the Home Button somehow integrated into the screen. \nThe new iPhone is expected to feature an all-glass body and distance itself from the plastic/aluminium design language of the last three iPhone generations, first introduced with iPhone 6.

      "text": "Apple will open flagship store in Carnegie Library This will be the second D.C. location for the tech giant Rec Photo via Patrick Müller In Mt. Vernon Square, Apple has agreed to open a flagship store in the 113-year-old Carnegie Library. First reported by Washington Business Journal , the tech giant has been in talks with D.C.’s convention and sports authority, Events DC, for several months now for Apple’s second location in the District. The first location is in Georgetown. Lease terms have not yet been finalized. The proposal is expected to be a 10-year-term with two five-year extensions. To offset any losses at Carnegie Library, Apple will pay up to $2 million. Award winning British architects Foster + Partners of London will redesign the 63,000-square-foot building in D.C. Washington Business Journal further reported “There will be an educational component to the deal, [Events D.C. Chair Max] Brown said. Details will be worked out, but the plan is to “connect youth to opportunities in programming, creative design, summer jobs and permanent jobs,” he said. He envisions training programs and after-school programs, both at the Carnegie Library site and in the community, particularly east of the river in Anacostia.” In order for the proposal to become reality, the National Capital Planning Commission and the Historic Preservation Review Board will have to approve the plans. This isn’t the first time there have been efforts to re-purpose the Carnegie Library, the first desegregated public building in the city. There have also been plans for a local history museum, music museum, and a new location for the International Spy Museum inside the space. None of these plans worked out. There are no reports yet as to where the Historical Society of Washington, D.C. will relocate to since it is headquartered in the Carnegie Library, which is currently closed due to mold .",

The plant processed about 1.1 million pounds of waste created by Apple's devices during a two-year period before closing in 2013 and moving the operations to Sunnyvale. \nRegulators say Apple processed about 803,000 pounds of electronic waste in Sunnyvale before notifying the state about its activities there.",

      "text": "Safety testers warn against fake Apple chargers | 1 hour ago | Vote 0 0 Safety testers warn against fake Apple chargers Apple By Levi Sumagaysay Where did you buy your Apple charger? If you didn't buy it from Apple, you might want to pay attention: 99 per cent of fake Apple chargers bought online failed a basic safety test, according to a consumer protection organization in the U.K. and U.S.-based safety testers UL. The testers said recently that they looked at 400 counterfeit Apple chargers bought online \"from suppliers around the world,\" and 397 failed the safety test. In October, Apple sued Mobile Star for trademark infringement, accusing it of selling fake chargers and cables on Amazon. In its lawsuit, the company included a review from a customer who bought one of the chargers and said it caught fire \"after just a few hours of use on the very first day.\" Apple also said in the lawsuit that it found that almost 90 per cent of supposed Apple products sold on Amazon were fake. (Amazon reportedly is stepping up its efforts against counterfeit items on its site.) The Chartered Trading Standards Institute and UL offer the following tips to check whether your charger might be a safety risk: Does it plug in easily? \"If pins do not fit properly into the socket, overheating, arcing and mechanical damage can occur to both the socket and the charger, which can be dangerous,\" Trading Standards Institute says. \"There should be at least 9.5 mm between the edge of the pins and the edge of the charger.\" Check whether the voltage and ratings marks on the product and your mobile device match. Look for warnings and instructions included with the charger. Also, Apple does provide certification for third parties to make accessories for its products. Look for the \"MFi\" logo on those accessories. | Join The Conversation Sign Up Login Most Read",

      "text": "Apple blames ‘external factors’ for iPhone fires in China By Dan Pye ● 6 minutes ago \nApple’s investigation into a series of iPhone fires in China has uncovered “no cause for concern,” with the company blaming physical damage to the devices, the BBC reports. Eight users filed complaints with Shanghai’s consumer protection agency, claiming their phones spontaneously caught fire or exploded. The report quoted one woman who said her iPhone 6s Plus exploded in August, “shattering the screen and leaving the battery and back of the phone blackened.” Apple has recently offered battery replacements for some users whose phones are experiencing sudden shutdowns, but has offered assurances that the problem isn’t a safety issue and blamed the fires reported in China on external physical damage “which led to the thermal event.”",

      "text": "By Tiernan Ray Another day, another Apple ( AAPL ) iPhone warning.\nRosenblatt Securities ’s Jun Zhang today reiterates a Neutral rating, and a $102 price target, warning that sales of the iPhone in China , he estimates, are “still weaker than retail channels” as discounting of the phone has popped up across the country.\niPhone sales, presumably in dollars, he doesn’t specify — fell by 6% in November, and are probably down “slightly” from November this month, as discounting takes hold outside of tight supplies at Apple’s online store:\nOverall iPhone sales in China were down 6% in November and slightly down MoM in November due to some pushes in “single day” sales. In our view, iPh- one 7 sales will continue trending down and many retailers in China have al- ready started discounting ($50) the iPhone 7 in November. iPhone 7 Plus sup- ply is catching up in November, and sales have grown MoM in November. iPh- one 6/6S sales continue to be weak. The 7 Plus model currently accounts for 60% of iPhone 7 sales in China. We started seeing some retailers discounting this model in November. In our view, there is a waitlist if ordered from Apple’s online store, but consumers can easily buy them from local stores and third party retail stores. Since the jet black mod- el has high return rate, Apple might try to control capacity. Overall, we believe iPhone sales in China are still weaker than retail channels expected. \nZhang also cautions investors not to be mislead if they hear of component orders rising come the March quarter. In his view, “Some noise of Apple increasing orders might come from the iPad instead of the iPhone,” given he sees Apple refreshing the various iPad models in March.",

      "text": " 33:  Apple Inc. ( AAPL ) has confirmed that the iPhone 6s battery issue may be larger than thought, as the tech giant said that some customers \"outside the affected range of devices\" have also reported unexpected shutdowns. \nIn mid-November, Apple said it will replace batteries for the iPhone 6s free of charge for customers who have experienced an unexpected shutdown of their smartphones. The program covers affected iPhone 6s batteries for three years after the first retail sale of the unit. \n\"Apple has determined that a very small number of iPhone 6s devices may unexpectedly shut down. This is not a safety issue and only affects devices within a limited serial number range that were manufactured between September and October 2015,\" Apple stated at that time. \nAccording to Apple, some of these shutdowns may be normal as the iPhone will shut down to protect its electronic components. \nHowever, the tech giant added that it found a small number of iPhone 6s devices manufactured between September and October 2015 were exposed to \"controlled ambient air\" for too long before a battery component was loaded into the battery pack, causing the battery to drain faster than normal. This resulted in an unexpected shutdown. \nApple has not provided details about how many devices have been affected. \nThe company said it will add an additional diagnostic feature to the iOS software update that will be released next week, in order to gather more information. \nAccording to Apple, the feature will collect a variety of information in the coming weeks that may help it to improve algorithms for managing battery performance and shutdown operations. \nIf improvements are achieved, Apple intends to deliver them through further software updates. \n ",

      "text": "Apple agrees to pay $450,000 for mishandling hazardous waste Apple agrees to pay $450,000 for mishandling hazardous waste Posted: Tags : Apple - Apple + The California Environmental Protection Agency (CEPA) said on Tuesday that Apple has agreed to pay $450,000 to settle claims that it mishandled hazardous electronic waste. According to CEPA's Department of Toxic Substances Control, Apple also agreed to increase inspections in its waste disposal facilities in Cupertino, CA and Sunnyvale, CA.State regulators claim that Apple operated an electronic waste shredding facility in Cupertino between 2011 and 2012, processing about 1.1 million pounds, or 500 tons, of waste before closing it in January 2013. The facility was then moved to Sunnyvale and Apple processed 800,000 pounds of waste before letting the state know that such a facility actually exists.At the Sunnyvale plant, Apple gathered hazardous metal dust, and sent it to a disposal site, which was not licensed, nor prepared, to handle it properly. If such fine particles are accidentally released in the air, they can be extremely dangerous for both wildlife and people.According to regulators, Apple also failed to mark used oil containers as hazardous waste and didn't track exports of dangerous waste, nor did it report it properly to the respective authorities. “This matter involves an oversight in filing paperwork to close one of our recycling facilities as part of our expansion to a larger site,” wrote Alisha Johnson, an Apple spokeswoman, to Reuters in an email. “We've worked closely with [the Department of Toxic Substance Control] to ensure that going forward we have the proper permits for our current site. As we do with all our facilities, we followed our stringent set of health and safety standards, which go well beyond legal requirements.” Stringent standards or not, Apple has acknowledged to mishandling hazardous waste and sending it to an unauthorized third-party facility. Even if this is simply a matter of oversight in paperwork, we'd prefer that California authorities are aware of the toxic waste next time. PhoneArena is on Instagram .

      "title": "Inside the secret meeting where Apple revealed the state of its AI research",
      "text": "Apple has long been secretive about the research done within its Cupertino, California, labs. It’s easy to understand why. Conjecture can spin out of even the most benign of research papers or submissions to medical journals, especially when they’re tied to the most valuable company on the planet.\nBut it seems Apple is starting to open up about its work, at least in artificial intelligence. On Dec. 6, at an invitation-only lunch at an industry AI conference , the company’s new head of machine learning , Russ Salakhutdinov, and other Apple employees gave a wide-ranging talk detailing the problems the company is using AI to tackle, according to nine slides from the presentation obtained by Quartz.\nApple’s AI research areas. (Supplied to Quartz) Apple, unsurprisingly, is working on a lot of the same problems as other companies that are exploring machine learning: recognizing and processing images, predicting user behavior and events in the physical world, modeling language for use in personal assistants, and trying to understand how to deal with uncertainty when an algorithm can’t make a high-confidence decision.\nOne presentation slide that summarized the company’s research featured two pictures of cars, to illustrate “volumetric detection of LiDAR” and “prediction of structured outputs.” Both LiDAR, or Light Detection and Ranging (similar to radar but with lasers), and prediction of physical events are important building blocks of today’s self-driving car technologies . However, two attendees of the presentation, who asked not to be identified due to the sensitive nature of the content, both stressed that the company made no mention of cars or automotive ambitions.\nApple has been long-rumored to be building an autonomous vehicle, even sending a letter to the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) saying that companies looking to test autonomous vehicles should be treated the same, whether they are new to the field or more established self-driving car shops like Googleila and Uber.\nSpecific research goals. (Supplied to Quartz) Another slide focused on Apple’s ability to build neural networks that are 4.5 times smaller than the originals with no loss in accuracy, and twice the speed. The technique, not unknown in AI research , uses a larger, more robust neural network to teach another network the decisions it would make in a variety of situations. The “student” network then has a streamlined version of the “teacher” network’s knowledge. In essence, it predicts the larger network’s predictions about a given photo or audio sample.\nThis kind of work is essential for Apple, as a hardware company that makes mobile devices. By slimming down the neural network, iPhones and iPads can identify faces and locations in photos, or understand changes in a user’s heart rate, without needing to rely on remote servers. Keeping these processes on the phone makes the features available anywhere, and also ensures data doesn’t need to be encrypted and sent over wireless networks.\nHealth data analysis (Supplied to Quartz) A bragging point for Apple was the efficiency of its algorithms on graphics processing units, or GPUs, the hardware commonly used in servers to speed processing in deep learning. One slide claimed that Apple’s image recognition algorithm could process twice as many photos per second as Google’s (pdf), or 3,000 images per second versus Google’s 1,500 per second, using roughly one third of the GPUs. The comparison was made against algorithms running on Amazon Web Services, a standard in cloud computing.\n\nWhile other companies are beginning to rely on specialty chips to speed their AI efforts, like Google’s Tensor Processing Unit and Microsoft’s FPGA s, it’s interesting to note that Apple is relying on standard GPUs. It’s not known, however, whether the company builds its own, custom GPUs to match its custom consumer hardware, or buys from a larger manufacturer like Nvidia, which sells to so many internet companies it has been described as “ selling shovels to the machine learning gold rush. ”\nThe images Apple uses to train its neural network on how to recognize images also seems to be proprietary, and is nearly twice the size of the standard ImageNet database.\nMachine-learning scientists have long-criticized Apple for its reluctance to contribute back to the research community. During the presentation, which served to bring a small, select group of researchers up to speed with Apple’s efforts, Salakhutdinov—a prominent AI researcher himself, at Carnegie Mellon University—said that Apple would begin to publish its research and make a greater effort to work with the research community, according to attendees.\nIt’s unclear whether Apple’s pledge to publish will apply only to machine-learning research, or to other areas of computer-science research, like security.\nApple did not respond to a request for comment.",

      "text": "0 \nSome good news in the direction of Samsung–it’s pay-out to Apple for copying has been overturned. We’re not saying Samsung really did copy the iPhone design but that’s the reason why the South Korean tech giant needs to pay the Cupertino company $400 million in damages. The decision is overturned in the United States and the Supreme Court is in the process of reassessing the case. Samsung filed a counter complaint earlier this year and said there’s be a miscalculation in the damages, no thanks to the arguments given by Apple. \nThe Federal Circuit is once again looking into the lawsuit and is expected to make a ruling on the $400 million figure and say if it’s the correct amount. Samsung is arguing that those patents only covered one part of the phone so the amount shouldn’t be that high. Of course, the court said phones are sold as one whole device and not as parts so full prices and revenues must be considered. \nWe’ll wait for the new decision to be handed down in the coming weeks. For now, we can say Samsung isn’t in a good place. The amount may be small for both Samsung and Apple but we all know this isn’t just about money. Apple just wants the world to know that Samsung is a copycat. We’re not saying it is one but this Apple-Samsung battle has been going on for years. We don’t think there will be an end to it soon. We’re just hoping Samsung will rise from the Note 7 failure and do better next year.",

If you didn't buy it from Apple, you might want to pay attention: 99 per cent of fake Apple chargers bought online failed a basic safety test, according to a consumer protection organization in the U.K. and U.S.-based safety testers UL.\nThe testers said recently that they looked at 400 counterfeit Apple chargers bought online \"from suppliers around the world,\" and 397 failed the safety test.\nIn October, Apple sued Mobile Star for trademark infringement, accusing it of selling fake chargers and cables on Amazon. In its lawsuit, the company included a review from a customer who bought one of the chargers and said it caught fire \"after just a few hours of use on the very first day.\"\nApple also said in the lawsuit that it found that almost 90 per cent of supposed Apple products sold on Amazon were fake. (Amazon reportedly is stepping up its efforts against counterfeit items on its site.)\nThe Chartered Trading Standards Institute and UL offer the following tips to check whether your charger might be a safety risk:\nDoes it plug in easily? \"If pins do not fit properly into the socket, overheating, arcing and mechanical damage can occur to both the socket and the charger, which can be dangerous,\" Trading Standards Institute says. \"There should be at least 9.5 mm between the edge of the pins and the edge of the charger.\"\nCheck whether the voltage and ratings marks on the product and your mobile device match.\nLook for warnings and instructions included with the charger.\nAlso, Apple does provide certification for third parties to make accessories for its products. Look for the \"MFi\" logo on those accessories.",

      "text": "print \nMunster's concept foldable iPhone. Piper Jaffray \nIn a presentation at Business Insider's IGNITION conference Wednesday, Piper Jaffray analyst Munster said he believes Apple will release a version of the iPhone with a foldable screen. \nThe idea is to have a phone that can fold open into a tablet form factor when you need a larger screen. Think of it as an all-in-one tablet and phone hybrid. \nKeep in mind this is just a prediction from Munster, and there's little evidence Apple will actually build a device beyond where Munster and his colleagues see smartphones going in the future. \nBusiness Insider caught up with Munster after his presentation for a bit more color on his prediction. He said he thinks Apple will want to release a foldable iPhone in about five years. \nMunster is one of the most dedicated Apple watchers in the world, and his near-term analysis is pretty good. But he famously whiffed when he said Apple would release a television set. That project was canceled by Apple, according to The Wall Street Journal , though it was in the works. \nStill, a foldable iPhone isn't a completely insane concept. Apple's biggest smartphone rival Samsung has been experimenting with foldable smartphone displays for years, and there's even a chance that such a device will launch in 2017.

      "text": "By Tiernan Ray \nKicking off a day of testimony by AT&T ( T ) and Time Warner ( TWX ) regarding their proposed combination, Mark Cuban , who once sold Broadcast.com to Yahoo! ( YHOO ) for a lot of money, told Congress why the deal should be allowed. \nCuban, reading from prepared remarks, painted for the Congress a picture of a media landscape dominated by a handful of big companies who control content today, chief among them Facebook ( FB ), but also Apple ( AAPL ) and Alphabet ’s ( GOOGL ) Google , because they dominate the apps that people use to “avoid boredom.”\nCuban said that TV was always the dominant medium because it allowed people to avoid boredom “while pretending we were doing something.”\n“The idea TV is the dominant content delivery medium no longer is valid,” said Cuban.\nFacebook, and smartphone apps, and virtual reality platforms such as Facebook’s Oculus Rift headset, now offer consumers “any kind of content, in any manner the consumer would like to receive it,” better than television can do.\n“Facebook is in a dominant position, if not the dominant position, for delivery of content.”\nCuban told congressmen to imagine what would have happened had Facebook not bought WhatsApp, Oculus, and Instagram. “The market would be far more competitive,” he concluded.\nIn addition, said Cuban, “ Snapchat is taking over millennials as the best alternative to boredom.”\nAmidst all this, “TV is losing viewers to other dominant content players,” he said, citing Apple, and Google’s YouTube . He made a point of noting that YouTube, for instance, was an “acquired property.” He also referred to Google’s search business as the “ultimate programming guide.” \nCuban said it was serious that there are “Two companies, Google and Apple, that are the sole gatekeepers to content.”\nHe then went on to say that “Neither AT&T nor Time Warner are “in any sort of dominant position,” and that “alone they will have a very difficult time controlling their destinies.”\n“We need more companies to compete with Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon ( AMZN ) and Facebook,” continued Cuban. “They have all established dominant positions, and that’s why this is an important, strategic content acquisition.”\n“Together, they will have a chance to battle the dominant players,” he concluded of AT&T and Time Warner.",

Some owners of the new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar are also complaining that they are getting far less than the stated 10 hours of battery life from their laptop.",

      "text": "Apple \nCiting sources in Taiwan, Japanese Apple blog Mac Otakara just came out with the first rumor on Wednesday suggesting Apple will release \"S\" models of the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus that will look identical to this year's iPhone 7.\nAside from a similar design as the iPhone 7, the iPhone 7 \"S\" models are said to come in a new red color option, as well as an updated processor.\nMac Otakara has a decent track record with Apple rumors, but its claims contradict reports from notable KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who claims that Apple is going to release three new iPhones with glass casings .\nIf Mac Otakara's report is accurate, and the iPhone 7S looks identical to the iPhone 7, it means the iPhone's design will have gone largely unchanged for four straight years. It would be a blow for those holding out for a truly new and different iPhone.\nIf you were hoping to get your hands on an all-glass iPhone in 2017, there's still hope: MacOtakara's report doesn't mention the third rumored \"high-end\" model, sized between the iPhone 7 and larger iPhone 7 Plus, to be called either the \"iPhone 8\" or \"iPhone 10,\" since 2017 will be the 10th anniversary of the iPhone's existence. Rumors surrounding the \"high-end\" model include a total redesign from the iPhone 7 with a wraparound glass design, borderless screen, and a 5.1 or 5.2-inch OLED display that's superior to the LCD displays on current iPhones.\nApple \nIt's also said the \"high-end\" model will cost more than the two models with the regular 4.7 and 5.5-inch screens that Apple is also expected to release.\nWhile Apple may have a prototype of the iPhone 8 (or 10) with an OLED screen, Apple could be facing difficulties in obtaining enough OLED screens for mass-production.\nWe don't expect Apple to announce new iPhones until September 2017, so it's not worth jumping to any conclusions. The next iPhone's release is still over nine months away, which means Apple is likely in the prototyping and testing phase, and that itself means there could be a bunch of prototypes with different designs and features floating around Apple factories. As Business Insider reported in November, Apple is apparently testing 10 different prototypes of the so-called iPhone 8 .\nThat said, these are just rumors, and everything we think we know about Apple's next iPhone could change over the next few months, so take this latest information with a grain of salt.\nNOW WATCH: Apple revealed why some iPhones are randomly shutting down despite having battery life left \n",

      "text": "Trump Targets Drug Prices, Apple, Seeks '5 Minutes' With Offshoring Firms (Investor's Business Daily) \nSen. Bernie Sanders and President-elect Donald Trump don't agree on much, but they seem to have found some middle-ground when it comes to drug prices. \nSanders said in a press release Tuesday that he proposed an amendment that would lower the cost of prescription drugs by allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices and also allow the importation of low-cost prescription drugs from other countries. \nSanders has been a leading figure in advocating for change against drug prices and has never shied away from challenging pharmaceutical companies such as Ariad Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: ARIA ) directly. \nThe former presidential candidate added that both of these proposals have been advocated by Trump. \nHowever, Republicans blocked Sanders' amendment. Unlikely Ally? \nSanders quoted Trump saying in a speech back in February when he criticized the existing law, which forbids Medicare from negotiating prices with pharmaceutical companies. \nSpecifically, Trump said, \"We are not allowed to negotiate drug prices. Can you believe it? We pay about $300 billion more than we are supposed to, than if we negotiated the price. So there's $300 billion on day one we solve.\" \nSanders' press release added that Trump also called for the legalization of importing cheaper drugs from other countries. \n\"I am sure that all of my Republican colleagues will support an amendment in my hands that will do exactly what Mr. Trump said he would accomplish as president,\" Sanders was quoted as saying to his Senate colleagues. \n\"It is incomprehensible to me that we have a major bill dealing with prescription drugs and yet we are running from the most important issue and that is the greed of the pharmaceutical industry,\" the press release added. \"The prescription drug industry, along with Wall Street, is the most powerful political force in America. I have been fighting the greed of the prescription drug industry for decades. And, as far as I can tell, the prescription drug industry always wins, but the American people lose.\" © 2016 Benzinga.com. Benzinga does not provide investment advice. All rights reserved.",

      "text": "print Apple \nCiting sources in Taiwan, Japanese Apple blog Mac Otakara just came out with the first rumor on Wednesday suggesting Apple will release \"S\" models of the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus that will look identical to this year's iPhone 7. \nAside from a similar design as the iPhone 7, the iPhone 7 \"S\" models are said to come in a new red color option, as well as an updated processor. \nMac Otakara has a decent track record with Apple rumors, but its claims contradict reports from notable KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who claims that Apple is going to release three new iPhones with glass casings . \nIf Mac Otakara's report is accurate, and the iPhone 7S looks identical to the iPhone 7, it means the iPhone's design will have gone largely unchanged for four straight years. It would be a blow for those holding out for a truly new and different iPhone. \nIf you wanted to get your hands on an all-glass iPhone in 2017, there's still hope: MacOtakara's report doesn't rule out or mention the third rumored \"high-end\" model, sized between the iPhone 7 and larger iPhone 7 Plus, to be called either the \"iPhone 8\" or \"iPhone 10,\" since 2017 will be the 10th anniversary of the iPhone's existence. Rumors surrounding the \"high-end\" model include a total redesign from the iPhone 7 with a wraparound glass design, borderless screen, and a 5.1 or 5.2-inch OLED display that's superior to the LCD displays on current iPhones. \nYouTube/TechDesigns \nIt's also said the \"high-end\" model will cost more than the two models with the regular 4.7 and 5.5-inch screens that Apple is also expected to release. \nWhile Apple may have a prototype of the iPhone 8 (or 10) with an OLED screen, Apple could be facing difficulties in obtaining enough OLED screens for mass-production. \nWe don't expect Apple to announce new iPhones until September 2017, so it's not worth jumping to any conclusions. The next iPhone's release is still over nine months away, which means Apple is likely in the prototyping and testing phase, and that itself means there could be a bunch of prototypes with different designs and features floating around Apple factories. As Business Insider reported in November, Apple is apparently testing 10 different prototypes of the so-called iPhone 8 . \nThat said, these are just rumors, and everything we think we know about Apple's next iPhone could change over the next few months, so take this latest information with a grain of salt.

      "title": "Is iPhone 7 Plus As Good As A Movie Camera? Apple Thinks So",
      "text": "Apple seems to have got into the Donald Trump-style exaggeration mode lately. Recently, the Cupertino company tried to convince its fans that the latest MacBook Pro is among some of the world’s greatest inventions . Now Apple wants you to believe that the iPhone 7 Plus camera is as good as a Hollywood movie camera. In its latest ad Romeo and Juliet , the company highlights the video recording capabilities of the iPhone 7 Plus.\nImage source: Apple / YouTube video Should Hollywood directors use iPhone 7 Plus to shoot movies? Sure, the latest flagship iPhone features one of the best smartphone cameras out there. Its dual-camera system allows you to take pictures in Portrait Mode with blurred background. But it still lags behind DSLR cameras . Apple’s ad shows two children acting out William Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet in a realistic setting. The video then reveals that what we are seeing is a father recording a school play with the iPhone 7 Plus.\nThen a caption from Apple appears: “Your movies look like movies on iPhone 7.” It implies that the 5.5-inch iPhone is as good as movie cameras. It depends on what movies you are talking about. You can certainly shoot something like the Blair Witch Project with your iPhone 7, but not T he Grand Budapest Hotel , says Chris Matyszczyk of CNet . The ad ends with the “Practically magic” tagline that Apple has used in the previous iPhone 7 ads.\nThe new ad comes after Apple’s annual Frankie’s Holiday ad featuring an iPhone-totting Frankenstein. Interestingly, the Frankie’s Holiday ad focused only on the iPhone rather than a variety of Apple products. The iPhone 7 Plus features dual 12-megapixel high-speed sensors with optical image stabilization (OIS), f/1.8 aperture, wide color gamut, and new image signal processors.\niPhone 7 demand “OK, not great” Consumers are not too excited about the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus as they prefer to wait for the 2017 iPhone 8. Recent reports suggest that Apple has asked its suppliers to cut down on the iPhone 7 production amid fading demand. KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo believes that Apple suppliers would revise down their shipment forecasts by 5%-15% in the last two months of 2016.\nOn Monday, Pacific Crest Securities analyst Andy Hargreaves told investors that the iPhone 7 demand was “OK, not great.” The research firm has slashed its price target on the stock from $129 to $127 due to “uninspiring” iPhone demand. Pacific Crest estimates Apple to sell 77 million iPhones during the December quarter.\nThe 2017 iPhone 8 is said to feature an all-glass design with the home button and fingerprint sensor embedded in the display itself. Apple is expected to switch to OLED display with the next-gen iPhone.\nThe post Is iPhone 7 Plus As Good As A Movie Camera? Apple Thinks So appeared first on ValueWalk .\n",

      "text": "Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) FILE - In this Dec. 12, 2013 file photo, a man passes by the Samsung Electronics Co. logos at its headquarters in Seoul, South Korea. A unanimous Supreme Court on Tuesday, Dec. 6, 2016, sided with smartphone maker Samsung in its high-profile patent dispute with Apple over design of the iPhone. The justices said Samsung may not be required to pay all the profits it earned from 11 phone models because the features at issue are only a tiny part of the devices. (AP Photo/Ahn Young-joon, File) \nWASHINGTON (AP) — A unanimous Supreme Court on Tuesday sided with smartphone maker Samsung in its high-profile patent dispute with Apple over design of the iPhone. \nThe justices said Samsung may not be required to pay all the profits it earned from 11 phone models because the features at issue are only a tiny part of the devices. \nApple had won a $399 million judgment against Samsung for copying parts of the iPhone’s patented design, but the case now returns to a lower court to decide what Samsung must pay. \nThe case is part of a series of disputes between the technology rivals that began in 2011. Apple accused Samsung of duplicating a handful of distinctive iPhone features for which Apple holds patents: the flat screen, the rounded rectangle shape of the phone, and the layout of icons on the screen. \nAt issue was how much Samsung is required to compensate Apple under an 1887 law that requires patent infringers to pay “total profit.” Apple said that meant all the profits from the phone sales, while Samsung argued it was limited to profits related to the specific components that were copied. \nJustice Sonia Sotomayor wrote for the court that the law does not require damages to be based on the entire product, but can be limited to only a component of the product. The decision overturned a ruling from a federal appeals court in Washington, which said that Apple was entitled to all the profits. \nBut the high court declined to lay out a specific test for how such damage awards should be calculated. Sotomayor said doing so was not necessary and the justices left it up to lower courts to resolve. \nSamsung had argued that the hefty award ignored the fact that its phones contain more than 200,000 other patents that Apple does not own. Apple said the verdict was fair because the iPhone’s success was directly tied to its distinctive look. Share this: ",

      "text": "See full gallery on TechnoBuffalo Is Apple facing some sort of Galaxy Note 7 situation of its own? The BBC said this week that as many as eight different reports have suggested iPhones are “spontaneously” catching fire in China. The iPhone 6 appears to be the problem device, suggesting that battery issues related to the iPhone 6s aren’t the only problem Apple is facing right now.\nApple acknowledged the issue in China and said that “external factors” are responsible for the iPhone 6 fires. In other words, unlike the Galaxy Note 7, Apple believes that its iPhones aren’t the units at fault but, instead, it’s something else causing the problem. It could be that the iPhone owners accidentally dropped their devices, causing some sort of internal malfunction, or are using dangerous parts like third-party chargers that are causing the fires.\n“‘We treat safety as a top priority and have found no cause for concern with these products,” Apple said. Still, the issues have caused enough problems that the Shanghai Consumer Council is getting involved and looking for answers. Additionally, it appears that Apple’s iPhone 6s woes have spread to China, too, where users are also complaining of problems related to the device shutting down when the battery still shows a 30 percent charge.\nThe iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s are both having problems Apple responded to that problem last week, noting that it, too, isn’t a safety concern and is indeed a feature of the iPhone meant to automatically shut it down. Apple says there is a small batch of iPhone 6s units experiencing the issue , though it appears to be widespread enough that it’s now planning to roll out diagnostic tools in an update due sometime next week to help it better identify the problem. Users affected by that issue can have their batteries replaced at no charge.\nFor now, it appears Apple is not facing any sort of Galaxy Note 7 problem of its own. We’ll let you know if the fire issues become a bigger concern.\n\n\nSource : BBC ",

      "text": "China Says Eight iPhone 6 Models Exploded, Apple Claims It’s Not Its Fault GO Consumer group says more iPhones catch fire in China Dec 7, 2016 13:50 GMT · By Bogdan Popa · Share: China’s Consumer Council, which is a consumer group that’s linked to the Beijing government, revealed that it received a total of 8 complaints from Apple customers across the country that their iPhone 6 models caught fire due to what they believed to be faulty batteries. Details are sketchy for the time being, but the consumer group says that all devices “spontaneously” burst into flames, according to a report by Bloomberg , even though they were in perfect condition. On the other hand, Apple says that it already investigated these phones and it found external physical damage on all of them, so the fire is a direct result of this factor. “We appreciate that customers are more concerned than ever about the performance and safety of batteries in their mobile devices,” Apple said in a statement, adding that those experiencing issues with their iPhones should contact the company or visit an Apple store. While this isn’t the first report of iPhones catching fire (in China or across the world), it’s hard to tell who is right here, as the consumer group only claims the iPhone 6 was involved in these spontaneous fires. Physical damage caused by bending? For what it’s worth, the iPhone 6 was affected by the famous bendgate, which caused the devices to bend under strong pressure, thus causing physical damage to the phone and possibly leading to a battery malfunction which in its turn could cause a fire. If this is the case, Apple is indeed right when it says that external factors caused the explosions, but it’s not known if bending was the source of the physical damage or not. This report, however, comes only a few days after Apple started a global recall of iPhone 6s models that came with a bad battery causing the devices to turn off unexpectedly. More recently , Apple admitted that more phones than initially believed might by impacted , saying that it plans to release an iOS update that would help determine how widespread the problem actually is. On the other hand, Apple says that only the iPhone 6s is impacted by this unexpected shutdown, but with China pressuring the firm to look into these reports, don’t be too surprised if more models are included in the recall.",

      "title": "U.S. Supreme Court Sides with Samsung Over Apple in Latest Appeal",
      "text": "There are multiple lawsuit cases going back and forth between Samsung and Apple right now. At the end of last month, we learned that Samsung was denied an appeal against Apple in regards to their slide-to-unlock, quick links and auto-correct patents. On this case, Samsung can either pay the $119.6 million, or attempt to take it to the Supreme Court. Now, in a completely separate case, the U.S. Supreme Court has sided with Samsung.\nThis other case was one that Samsung had lost as well, and was ordered to pay Apple $930 million for copying “key iPhone designs.” While the penalty for this specific case was supposed to be $930 million, but it was cut by $382 million before Samsung decided to pay. So last year, Samsung paid Apple $548 million and then decided to take the case to the Supreme Court, hoping they could have that penalty cut again (this time by $399 million).\nGenerally for patents, it’s said that the person or company who violates them will have to pay its entire profits from the sales of products using stolen designs. This is generally known to be true even if the design patents are only for a portion of the overall product being sold. Samsung felt this was unfair and asked the U.S. Supreme Court to weigh in on the issue. They agree with Samsung and feel they shouldn’t have to pay the entire $548 million penalty.\nSamsung feels they should have that total cut by $399 million, but now it’s up to the lower courts to figure out a new penalty total. The thing is, the U.S. Supreme Court did not present a way for the juries and lower courts to come up with this new total. Apple will continue to argue that it was innovative designs that made the iPhone a success (and therefore the majority of a product’s profits), while Samsung will continue to say these features are small and do not reflect the overall product.\nSource: Reuters \n",

      "text": "Foxxconn to expand U.S. investment 3:37pm GMT - 01:09 \nThe Taiwanese Apple supplier said Wednesday it would boost its investment in the U.S. one day after its Japanese partner Softbank pledged to invest $50 billion in the U.S. Fred Katayama reports.   \nAsian tech investments heading for the U.S. Just after Softbank's CEO Masayoshi Son pledged to President-elect Donald Trump his company would invest $50 billion in the U.S., Son's close Taiwanese business partner, Foxconn, said Wednesday it's in preliminary talks to expand its U.S. operations. The Apple supplier said it hasn't yet determined how much it would invest. But CNBC reported that a snapshot of papers held by Son outlining his investment carried the logos of SoftBank and Foxconn, and that page showed an additional $7 billion investment and the creation of another 50,000 jobs. Son had pledged that his company would create 50,000 new jobs in the U.S. Trump claimed his election brought about that move. That pledge revived speculation that the company that Softbank controls, Sprint, might restart merger talks with T-Mobile US. The two companies had dropped their merger talks after they faced pressure from regulators. Shares of Foxconn rose nearly 1 percent. Softbank finished more than 6 percent higher.  //reut.rs/2gUhbmM",

      "text": "iPhone Maker Foxconn Planning U.S. Expansion  39 PST \nFoxconn is one of Apple’s biggest contract manufacturing partners making products like the iPhone at its factories in China. Apple doesn’t make iPhones or most of its other products in the United States and it has been often criticized for that by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump who said on the campaign trail that he’s going to make the company move production back to the United States . Foxconn has now announced that it’s planning an expansion into the U.S. \nIn a statement provided to Bloomberg, Foxconn says that “While the scope of the potential investment has not been determined, we will announce the details of any plans following the completion of direct discussions between our leadership and the relevant U.S. officials,” adding that “Those plans would be made based on mutually-agreed terms.” \nIt’s unclear at this point in time how much money Foxconn will invest in the United States and how many jobs it will end up creating. It’s also unclear whether Foxconn’s U.S facilities will manufacture the iPhone. \nThat’s easier said than done considering the fact that majority of the component suppliers for the iPhone are based outside the United States. This is going to raise significant logistics issues and will also end up raising production costs. \nThe scope of Foxconn’s planned investment in the United States remains unclear at this point in time and it can’t be said with absolute certainty if Apple will start manufacturing iPhones in the United States. \nFiled in Cellphones .

      "title": "Best Buy vs. The Apple Store",
      "text": "A recent shopping experience that really surprised me I was captivated when Apple opened its first set of physical retail stores in 2001. I’ve never owned a retail business, but I worked a variety of retail jobs growing up. What Apple did with retail was different.\nI’ve always been endlessly fascinated by retail. Watching people browse, seeing how people choose what to buy, seeing how moving stuff around in a store can have significant effects on purchasing patterns, etc. Paco Underhill’s Why We Buy is one of my favorite books of all time.\nWhen Apple finally opened one in the Chicago area over a decade ago, I rushed over there. I was in awe. What a unique retail experience. Just wonderful.\nAnd for years I enjoyed visiting the stores. Whenever I needed something Apple, I’d go there. I’d rearrange my schedule to shop at an Apple Store.\nBut in the last few years, the stores have really turned me off. I don’t like stepping into them. They don’t make me feel welcome — rather they make me feel like I need a good reason to be there. Of course I have a reason to be there, but I don’t like the fact that I have to declare it upon entry.\nAt the door you’re often met by a bouncer who asks you what you need and then directs you here or there. “Please wait by that table over there for a guy with glasses and a blue shirt.” And so you go, awkwardly waiting. Not sure if you can leave your station, lest you miss your opportunity to talk to who you were directed to talk to. Then what?\nI find the stores packed with so much Apple staff that you often have to break up a conversation between two staff members in order to ask a question. Now I feel like I’m interrupting someone just to buy something.\nAm I being a little dramatic? I’m really trying not to be. This is just how the stores make me feel these days . And it’s not just one store — it’s a handful of stores I’ve visited. Some have been better than others, but there’s a general vibe I get when I walk in that just doesn’t sit well with me. Whenever I go to the Apple Store I feel like I’m on the clock. Like some other customer appointment is pushing up behind me. Hurry up. I can’t explain it beyond that.\nI recognize Apple is a victim of their success here. Due to unprecedented retail demand, they’ve had to institute protocols to manage the number of people and different kinds of customers. I’m sympathetic to the challenges — it can’t be easy. And they’re probably doing it better than anyone else could. But regardless, I’m just sharing how it makes me feel as a customer.\nSo just a few days ago my wife asked me to pick up a new iPad for her. She needed it quickly — shipping wasn’t an option. A few years ago I would have hopped in the car and ran down to the local Apple store. This time, I checked Amazon Now first to see if we could get same day delivery. Then I realized Amazon doesn’t really sell Apple stuff so that was out. I could have tried Postmates since they deliver from local Apple Stores, but it didn’t cross my mind at the time.\nSo I decided to go somewhere I almost never go: Best Buy. There’s one right around the corner from our house. A 10 minute walk, a 3 minute drive.\nI walked in. The place was empty. This doesn’t bode well for Best Buy, but as a customer I kinda loved it. I could enter the store without being asked why I was there today. I just walked in and headed towards the dedicated Apple area in the back. When I got there I asked a guy if they had a 128 gig smaller size iPad Pro. He asked what color, I said gold. And he grabbed me one. Done. 5 minutes.\nThen I happened to ask the guy if they had the iPhone 7 and if I could switch our service from T-Mobile to Verizon. I figured I’d have to go to an Apple Store to do this (which is why we hadn’t done it yet). Or an Verizon store (which is another reason why we hadn’t done it yet). He said, sure, no problem at all, and he was really helpful throughout the process. So we did that too.\nThey weren’t happy or unhappy to see me. They weren’t overeager or disinterested. They didn’t stop me before I started shopping. I was there, they were there. It was just a transaction. Smooth, fast, and fair. At Best Buy. In and out in a few minutes.\nAgain — if you break it down, it’s clear that Apple Stores are doing quite well and Best Buy stores aren’t. So this isn’t commentary on successful business models. It’s just a simple share of a shopping experience I had recently that surprised me. Best Buy feels simple, Apple Stores feels over engineered, too sophisticated. I get why, but why doesn’t matter to the customer experience. It’s either great or it’s not — the why behind the scenes doesn’t matter. Who’s been teaching me that for decades? Apple.\nBest Buy vs. The Apple Store was originally published in Signal v. Noise on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.",

      "text": "Subscribe to the MacRumors Newsletter Apple Believes MacBook Pro Graphics Issues May Be Fixed in Latest macOS 10.12.2 Beta Wednesday December 7, 2016 8:49 am PST by Joe Rossignol Last week, we reported an increasing number of early adopters experiencing concerning graphics issues on the new MacBook Pro . All late 2016 MacBook Pro models appear to be affected, including standard 13-inch and 15-inch configurations with AMD Radeon Pro 450 or AMD Radeon Pro 455 graphics, but the issues appear to be most prevalent on the high-end 15-inch model with built-to-order AMD Radeon Pro 460 graphics. 15-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar exhibiting graphics issues ( jscooper22 ) User complaints have continued to surface over the past five days, with new videos emerging showing the usual symptoms, ranging from brightly colored flickering and full-screen checkerboard patterns to screen tearing and visual artifacts. Affected systems sometimes become unresponsive or crash due to a kernel panic, requiring some new MacBook Pro users to perform a hard restart. Separately, a number of users continue to report brief glitches during the boot up process on new MacBook Pro models, particularly along the bottom of the screen. It appears this issue is related to FileVault 2 startup disk encryption , as the glitches go away for many of these users once the feature is disabled. Apple has yet to publicly acknowledge or comment on the graphics issues, but in a supposed email response to a MacRumors forum member, Apple software engineering chief Craig Federighi allegedly said he believes the problems have been resolved in the latest macOS Sierra 10.12.2 beta released on Monday. As a point of emphasis, this email response has not been verified. Hi, Thanks for your note! We believe we have addressed all of these graphics issues in the latest beta of Sierra 10.12.2 (available at beta.apple.com). I hope that you enjoy your new MacBook Pro — it’s a fantastic machine! - craig While we have yet to verify the authenticity of the email beyond a reasonable doubt, there is some unscientific evidence to suggest it could be real: • Although it could easily be faked, the response appears to resemble previous email responses sent by Federighi • The user who shared the email response is a longtime MacRumors forum member who registered his account in June 2007 • Apple executives appear to be increasingly using email as a vehicle to subtly address customer questions and concerns • MacRumors viewed a lengthy follow-up email the user received from Apple's Executive Relations team, which appears to be legitimate Reports from affected users running the latest macOS Sierra beta are slim at this point, but at least one forum member claims to still be experiencing graphics issues on the fifth and latest macOS Sierra beta. macOS Sierra 10.12.2 should be publicly released later this month, so additional user reports should soon prove if the graphics issues have truly been fixed.",

      "text": "Trump Targets Drug Prices, Apple, Seeks '5 Minutes' With Offshoring Firms (Investor's Business Daily) \nBillionaire entrepreneur Chris Sacca is the latest person to take exception to one of President-elect Donald Trump ’s tweets. On Tuesday, Trump Tweeted about Japanese company SoftBank making a major investment in the US. \n“Masa (SoftBank) of Japan has agreed to invest $50 billion in the U.S. toward businesses and 50,000 new jobs…” Trump wrote . \nOn Wednesday morning, Sacca called out Trump for taking credit for the deal. \n“SoftBank formed and announced this $100 billion fund before you were elected. But cool story, bro,” Sacca replied . \nSacca then took a personal swipe at Trump. \n“You had a pretrial conference to defend a child rape suit so I’m sure you missed that day’s news.” \nSacca then re-tweeted a link to a story on the Huffington Post about an attorney for four of Trump’s sexual assault accusers welcoming the opportunity to question Trump under oath. \nSacca also re-tweeted a link to a Washington Post article in which the president of the United Steelworkers 1999 said Trump “lied his a—off” about his recent deal with United Technologies Corporation (NYSE: UTX )’s Carrier to save 1,100 U.S. jobs. It turns out 550 Carrier workers will lose their jobs after all. \nSacca took one final jab at Trump’s selection as Time’s 2016 Person of the Year by re-tweeting a Trump tweet from 2013:  ",

The company chose the photo editing app Prisma as its iPhone App of the Year ( as did we ), calling the app’s ability to turn photos into works of art “almost too cool for words.” MSQRD, with its live photo and video filters, took the runner-up spot. Clash Royale was named iPhone Game of the Year, followed by runner-up Reigns, with Pokémon GO getting a special distinction as the Breakout Hit of 2016. \nOn the iPad side of things, Sketchbook Motion’s simple animation interface and Apple Pencil compatibility earned it the App of the Year title, followed by runner-up Bear, a writing app that simplifies linking and formatting. Severed took top honors as the iPad Game of the Year, followed by runner-up Chameleon Run. Twitter took the App of the Year honors on Apple TV, and fitness app MySwimPro took App of the Year honors on the newly waterproof Apple Watch. Riptide GP was named Apple TV Game of the Year and Field Day was Apple Watch Game of the Year. Apple has full lists of its top games and apps of the year in iTunes and the App Store.",

      "text": "Apple to publish its AI research December 7, 2016 - 17:15   Apple isn't exactly known for sharing its research with the world, but it's making a big exception to that rule. Company AI director Russ Salakhutdinov has revealed that Apple will publish its machine learning research. In other words, some of the discoveries it makes behind closed doors will be available to academia, Engadget said. \nHowever, the move raises a question: why open the kimono when AI is a fiercely competitive field? The most likely answer: this is at least partly about attracting talent to Apple. Researchers in AI (and many other fields) like to have their work publicly shared and recognized. They're more likely to be interested in joining Apple if they know their breakthroughs won't be treated as trade secrets to be kept under lock and key. Don't be surprised if Apple has more success building its AI team in the future, particularly when it wants to recruit professors and others who still want to contribute to science, Engadget said.

      "text": "print \nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Apple is paying $450,000 to settle allegations that the iPhone maker operated and closed two hazardous-waste processing plants without submitting the proper paperwork to California environmental regulators. \nThe agreement announced Tuesday involves a now-closed plant near Apple's Cupertino, California, headquarters and another one in nearby Sunnyvale. \nCalifornia's Department of Toxic Substances Control alleged Apple opened, ran and then closed the Cupertino plant without regulators' knowledge. The plant processed about 1.1 million pounds of waste created by Apple's devices during a two-year period before closing in 2013 and moving the operations to Sunnyvale. \nRegulators say Apple processed about 803,000 pounds of electronic waste in Sunnyvale before notifying the state about its activities there. \nApple described its conduct as \"an oversight in paperwork\" that didn't affect its health and safety standards.

      "text": "print \nBEIJING, Dec 7 (Reuters) - Apple Inc said external factors were the likely cause of iPhone 6 battery fires detailed in a Chinese consumer protection report that featured widely in state media earlier this week and created a buzz on social media. \nThe Shanghai Consumer Council released a report on Friday detailing battery fires in eight iPhone 6 handsets. It also detailed iPhone 6 handsets powering down before their batteries are depleted - handsets outside of a global iPhone 6 recall range that Apple announced on Nov. 20 to address the issue. \n\"The units we've analyzed so far have clearly shown that external physical damage happened to them which led to the thermal event,\" an Apple spokeswoman said in an emailed statement to Reuters late on Tuesday. She also said Apple was widening its investigation into the power-down issue. \nThe U.S. tech firm has seen Chinese sales fall over the past three quarters as domestic smartphone makers compete with high-spec handsets at low price points. It is hoping to bounce back in the first quarter of next year with its iPhone 7. \nBut domestic handset makers also likely received a boost after South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co Ltd recalled 2.5 million Note 7 handsets globally following a series of battery fires, raising distrust of foreign smartphone brands, according to users, analysts and consumer groups. \nThe Shanghai Consumer Council in its report said that during Samsung's recall in October-November, complaints involving Apple products jumped, accounting for almost half the year-to-date total of 2763 - itself a nearly two-fold increase from 2015. \n\"The Samsung case did make (Chinese smartphone users) start to think an international brand doesn't necessarily equal a safe product,\" said Nicole Peng, Asia-Pacific director at researcher Canalys. \nState media outlets featuring the Shanghai council's report on Monday garnered tens of thousands of comments on social media. While many doubted the iPhone 6 was at fault, top-ranking comments expressed frustration that foreign brands could set high prices and yet not guarantee safety. \n\"I still worry about the iPhone in case there is indeed a problem, but it's not investigated,\" said Mr. Liu, a 21-year-old student in Beijing. \n\"The news did make me change my Apple habits,\" he told Reuters. \"For example, I don't dare play with the phone in bed and if it heats up I quickly throw it aside.\" (Reporting by Cate Cadell; Editing by Christopher Cushing) Read the original article on Reuters .

      "text": "\n(Adds details from ruling, paragraphs 3-5) \nBy Andrew Chung \nWASHINGTON, Dec 6 (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday sided with Samsung in its big-money smartphone patent fight with Apple, throwing out an appeals court ruling that said the South Korean company had to pay a $399 million penalty to its American rival for copying key iPhone designs. \nThe justices in their 8-0 ruling sent the case back to the lower court for further proceedings. \nThe decision gives Samsung another chance to try to get back a big chunk of the money it paid Apple in December following a 2012 jury verdict that it infringed Apple's iPhone patents and mimicked its distinctive appearance in making the Galaxy and other competing devices. \nThe court held that a patent violator does not always have to fork over its entire profits from the sales of products using stolen designs, if the designs covered only certain components and not the whole thing. \nThe ruling followed a ferocious legal battle between the world's top two smartphone manufacturers that began in 2011 when Apple sued Samsung, asserting that its rival stole its technology and the iPhone's trademarked appearance. It was one of the most closely watched patent cases to come before the top U.S. court in recent years. \n(Reporting by Lawrence Hurley; Editing by Will Dunham) Read the original article on Reuters .

      "text": "Today, 8:15 AM by Eric M. Zeman @phonescooper \nApple has agreed to pay a fine of $450,000 for improperly operating a hazardous waste facility in California. The company ran a plant in Cupertino that processed some 1.1 million pounds of hazardous waste. The plant was closed in 2013 and moved to Sunnyvale. California's Department of Toxic Substances Control alleged that Apple ran the facility without the state's knowledge. Apple blamed the transgression on \"an oversight in paperwork.\" The state accused Apple of mishandling some toxic dust, but no one was harmed and neither was the environment. Apple made clear that its own safety standards are more strict than the law demands.",

      "text": "Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak shows 7th and 8th graders how to use an Apple Macintosh computer circa 1993. Image: Getty Steve Wozniak Was My Computer Teacher in 1995 7 December 2016 // 12:00 PM CET Copy This URL \nI grew up in Silicon Valley two decades before it was cool enough to be the title of a show on HBO. My parents were conventional hippies who drove Volvos donned with “Save Tibet” and “Question Authority” bumper stickers. The public elementary school I went to in the Santa Cruz Mountains had only 30 kids in the 5th grade. \nNo matter their livelihoods or income levels, whether they were on food stamps or had enough money to get their kids their own miniature drivable Power Wheels Jeeps for Christmas —the parents would help out in whatever ways they could. My dad would take our class on nature walks while another girl’s mom led our Girl Scout troop. In 5th grade, we’d stay after school so my friend Sara’s dad could teach us about computers. \nSara’s dad happens to be Steve Wozniak, co-founder of Apple . \n“It was less important to me what you teach, and more important to motivate people by making things as fun as you can,” Wozniak told me recently over the phone, after I reconnected with him nearly 22 years later. “I had that liberty because I was sponsoring the class myself and wasn’t under the guidance of a principal. My intent was not to train people to become computer specialists or work for computer companies. We don’t need everyone in life to be computer experts.” A photo of the author's class showing off their Macintosh PowerBook laptops provided by Wozniak. The author appears on the slide, near the top. Image: Cati Myer \nThe Keys to the Kingdom of the Early Internet \nWozniak was teaching my 5th grade class back in 1995, almost a decade after the brain behind the Apple 1 had left the company to start other ventures, including CL9, which brought the first programmable remote control to the commercial market. \nThinking back to that class, I remember looking out the classroom window on our first day. It was raining and Steve walked across the playground wearing a red, white, and yellow umbrella hat—indicative of his love for quirky innovations. He walked in, took off his hat, and asked us to gather around. Then he pulled a floppy disk out of his pocket and proceeded to take it apart to show us what each piece did. In the back of the room were 30 brand new Apple Macintosh PowerBooks (1400c) on loan to us. He said that those who mastered the concepts would get to keep theirs at the end of the year. “It was less important to me what you teach, and more important to motivate people by making things as fun as you can.\" \nWe spent the next months learning how to use the internet, set up a network, and build simple webpages. I remember feeling like I had the keys to some magical kingdom. \nSteve had a sincere demeanor about the class, but he made sure to keep things interesting. Some days he’d bring us McDonald’s Happy Meals, which felt rebelliously exciting for kids who were regularly force-fed granola by health conscious parents. He also loved sharing fun gadgets with us. One day he gave us all laser pens, which he instantly must have realized was a mistake, as we spent the rest of class sneakily trying to blind each other. \nWhen I Discovered the Web Wasn’t Made By Spiders \nI was not exactly your ideal tech learner. When Steve told us he was going to teach us how to get on the “world wide web”, I imagined some secret underground tunnel where we’d be able to climb gigantic spider webs that connected every town around the world. I had heard about people trying to dig holes to China—who knew they had it all wrong? \nI was at first disappointed when I discovered the web was invisible and inside my computer, but my disappointment was soon replaced by glee when Steve introduced us to America Online. He helped us set up usernames and we’d dial in and wait for the voice of God to tell us we had mail. I soon decided this was way cooler than a giant underground spider web. Steve Wozniak leads a conga line of 7th and 8th graders carrying Apple Macintosh PowerBook laptops he purchased for them, in an image dated 1993. Image: Getty \n“I actually spent quite a bit [of money] to bring internet to the schools to even give dial-up to all you students,” Steve said during our recent conversation, reflecting on the early days of online access and how we hoped it would change how kids learn. “But networks were important and AOL was here before the internet. When we were in dial-up speed times, we could hardly imagine real live instantaneous things. But pre-internet, AOL had chat rooms which were kind of like the social web. You could get into rooms and categories you wanted to. As far as what it would lead to in the future, I just assumed computers would become more and more commonplace in school. All the schools were getting labs.” \nLearning Lessons in Online Privacy (With a Little Help From Jonathan Taylor Thomas) \nOnce I realized that we could technically connect to anyone or anything, I immediately wanted to know if my childhood celebrity crush and Home Improvement kid star Jonathan Taylor Thomas would come hang out with me. Surely, he had the internet. So naturally I emailed him at telling him how much I loved him on the show and that I know he was probably really busy but if he came to visit, I’d show him my Pog collection. I gave him my address and phone number just in case. \nTwo weeks later my parents received a very polite typed letter from a dentist in Des Moines telling them they should monitor their daughter’s activity online as she was giving out their personal information to total strangers. And there I had my first lesson in internet privacy at the age of 10. \nWoz’s Legacy as a Computer Teacher \nOf the 30 kids in our class, at least eight of us have gone into careers in technology. One of my former classmates, Dan Leis, said that Steve teaching us binary and networks like the long-dead Token ring , inspired him to go into tech. I have no such memory of that part of the curriculum and can only assume that was being taught when I snuck out to play “Truth or Dare” in the greenhouse behind our classroom. Another classmate, Bianca Yacoub, who now works at Apple in California, mentioned how he taught our class in her interview. Yacoub had a vision impairment due to albinism, and had a hard time seeing the font on our laptops, so Steve went to her house and installed a huge screen so she could see the lessons better. Steve Wozniak instructs children in his after-school computer class in the 1990s. Image: Getty \nMy most vivid memory from the class was a conversation I had with Steve. It was no secret that I was not the star pupil of that class. I found computers to be fun, but the technical aspect was lost on me pretty early on. One time Steve caught me zoning off and was instantly plagued with guilt. After class he came up to me and asked how I was liking the class. I replied with a cheerful, “Good!” but followed up with a confession that I didn’t love learning about computers the way some kids did. He just smiled and asked me what I did like. \nI admitted that generally, school was hard for me, but I loved art and in his class I liked the software that let you build things, like Sim City . He said those things were important, too, and that when he was younger, he didn’t like school much either. He was kind and nonjudgemental, and let me just be me about it.

Let them go off and do what they like to do and don’t force them to be going at the same speed as somebody else. Most of school might as well just be daycare anyway. If people have something in their heart, you shouldn’t slow them down...I liked being a super geek, but I definitely never pushed my values on other people.” \nAt the end of the year, we were all given a hard copy of Steve’s biography, Steve Wozniak, Inventor of the Apple Computer , by Martha E. Kendall. The kids awarded free computers had sparkly star stickers on their back page. I opened mine flipped to the back, where in place of a star, there was a note that read, “Go build great things. Best, Steve.” \nLooking back now, I think “The Woz” being something of a tech God was lost on us, as were many things when we were 10. I think we all just thought of him as Sara’s cool, super smart dad who made computers. We also thought it was cool that another girl’s dad was a firefighter, and that our class pet rabbit would eat pretty much anything you fed it. We were kids. Regardless, he gave us the freedom to be who we were, to discover our own passions, and defy imposed normative structures, whether they be from the confines of a school curriculum or parents who wouldn’t let us eat Mickey D’s. \nSyambra Moitozo is Associate Producer for Daily VICE. \nGet six of our favorite Motherboard stories every day by signing up for our newsletter .

By SAM HANANEL Associated Press Share Read Article \nWASHINGTON — The Supreme Court unanimously sided with smartphone maker Samsung on Tuesday in its high-profile patent dispute with Apple over design of the iPhone. \nThe justices said Samsung may not be required to pay all the profits it earned from 11 phone models because the features it copied from the iPhone were only a part of Samsung’s devices. Justices ruled that Samsung may not be required to pay all the profits earned from phone models using Apple-patented features, as they are only a tiny part of the devices. Associated Press/Ahn Young-joon Search photos available for purchase: Photo Store → \nCupertino, California-based Apple had won a $399 million judgment against South Korea-based Samsung for infringing parts of the iPhone’s patented design, but the case now returns to a lower court to decide what Samsung must pay. \nThe case is part of a series of disputes between the technology rivals that began in 2011. Apple accused Samsung of duplicating a handful of distinctive iPhone features for which Apple holds patents: the flat screen, the rounded rectangular shape of the phone and the layout of icons on the screen. \nAt issue was how much Samsung is required to compensate Apple under an 1887 law that requires patent infringers to pay “total profit.” Apple said that means all the profits from the phone sales, while Samsung argued it was limited to profits related to the specific components that were copied. \nJustice Sonia Sotomayor wrote for the court that the law does not require damages to be based on the entire product, but can be limited to only a component of the product. The decision overturned a ruling from a federal appeals court, which said that Apple was entitled to all the profits. \nBut the high court declined to lay out a specific test for how such damage awards should be calculated. Sotomayor said doing so was not necessary and the justices left it up to lower courts to resolve. \nSamsung had argued that the hefty award ignored the fact that its phones contain more than 200,000 other patents that Apple does not own. Apple said the verdict was fair because the iPhone’s success was tied to its distinctive look. \nSamsung already has handed the $399 million over to Apple, but was hoping to get some of that money back with a favorable Supreme Court ruling. None of the early-generation Samsung phones involved in the lawsuit remains on the market. \nIn a statement, Apple said the company is optimistic that lower courts “will again send a powerful signal that stealing isn’t right.” \nThe patent battle was being closely watched by other industry titans.

      "text": "Apple iPhone 6s battery issue hits more phones than thought Apple iPhone 6s battery issue hits more phones than thought Posted: If you've been following what is known now as #Batterygate, you know that Apple is replacing the battery for free on certain versions of the Apple iPhone 6s . Originally, Apple offered the free cell replacement for units produced between September and October 2015. Typing your handset's serial number into a special box on Apple's support page tells you whether or not your particular iPhone 6s is affected.Those units experiencing the problem will shut down suddenly as battery life drops from 30% to 0% in the blink of an eye. Plugging the phone into an outlet to charge it will bring the battery life right back to 30%. Last week, Apple said that a manufacturing problem allowed too much air into the battery compartments of affected units while they were being manufactured .Now, Apple is telling its customers in China that the problems with the battery affects more units than it thought. The tech titan said that a small number of iPhone 6s models \"outside of the affected range\" also experienced a battery related shutdown. While a shutdown is normal under certain extreme operating conditions (too hot, too cold, etc.) and is done to protect the components inside the phone, Apple plans on sending out a software update to garner more information about this problem. Another future update could be disseminated in order to fix the issue.If your iPhone 6s is experiencing this problem, we would suggest taking it right away to an Apple Store or an Apple authorized repair shop. We'd skip checking to see if the serial number matches affected units because of Apple's comment about phones outside of the affected range experiencing the same problem. If your iPhone 6s battery life drops from 30% to 0% and then recovers to 30% when plugged in, we'd run to have it looked at immediately. Apple iPhone 6s",

      "text": "Transcript: Apple’s iPhone 6S Battery Issue Is Bigger Than Expected \n(Apple, pixabay, reuters) Apple is admitting the iPhone 6S battery issues are much more complex than they initially anticipated. \nThe problem may affect phones manufactured beyond September or October 2015. \nA message posted on Apple’s Chinese support page said that a “small number of customers outside of the affected range have also reported an unexpected shutdown.” The problem originates from a component in the battery that was \"exposed to controlled ambient air\" for a longer period of time than it should have been before it was put into the battery packs. \nBut Apple stressed that it is not a safety issue. \nApple failed to inform exactly how many phones might be affected, or if the issues extended to other devices. \nBut the company will be offering support to all affected units by replacing its batteries for free. \nTo find out if your phone is affected visit Apple’s support page and type in your serial number.

      "text": "November set App Store's 'highest monthly sales ever,' says Apple's Schiller By Wednesday, December 07, 2016, 08:16 am PT (11:16 am ET) Last month saw the App Store achieve a new monthly sales record, Apple's senior VP of worldwide marketing said on Wednesday. Phil Schiller made the boast on Twitter without providing any specifics, such as whether he meant downloads or —presumably —revenue for both Apple and developers. November 2016 was a record breaker for the #AppStore - the highest monthly sales ever in App Store history! — Philip Schiller (@pschiller) December 7, 2016 While App Store sales can fluctuate from month to month, they have generally been on an upward trend since 2008 alongside a growing number of iPhone and iPad owners. That in turn has attracted high-profile developers, a number of which have figured out how to further monetize their work via in-app purchases. Sales are likely to run even higher this month, since iPhones and iPads can be popular Christmas gifts, and new owners tend to binge on apps to make them useful. During the last holiday season, over $1.1 billion was spent at the App Store between Dec. 20 and Jan. 3. Topics:",

      "text": "Apple's Federighi suggests GPU issues on 2016 Retina MacBook Pro fixed in macOS 10.12.2 By Wednesday, December 07, 2016, 07:09 am PT (10:09 am ET) In email response to a customer regarding GPU anomalies associated with the Touch Bar MacBook Pro, Apple's senior VP of Software Engineering Craig Federighi suggested that the problem is solved in the latest macOS 10.12.2 beta. In the email, sent to a MacRumors forum member, Federighi reportedly noted that he believes that everything software-related has been rectified. The executive declined to mention any specific fixes applied in the update. Problems are inconsistent among users, with reports spanning both the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pro. In an otherwise unaffected machine, some symptoms can be induced using non-updated software, but users are also reporting glitches in the login screen, as well as in Apple's own Photos app. The most likely culprit for the graphical distortions is the hand-off between Intel's integrated graphics chip and the discrete Radeon Pro GPU. Intel issued a Windows-based update for Skylake integrated graphics earlier in December, which may have been folded into Tuesday's macOS beta. AppleInsider has examined the new Sierra beta, and a large amount of the GPU drivers have been modified —but by how much is impossible to tell. However, in the one case of profound distortion out of eight machines we have access to, the beta has in fact fixed the problem the user was having with subscription Adobe offerings. The problem is still reproducible on some significantly older software dating back to OS X 10.8, however. Topics:",

      "text": "Fitbit's Pebble buyout valued at less than $40M, more about fighting Apple than product line By Wednesday, December 07, 2016, 06:07 am PT (09:07 am ET) New details about Fitbit's buyout of Pebble have emerged, namely that the deal is more about acquiring software and talent the company needs to fight Apple in the wearable arena, and less about the Pebble product line. The deal, said to be less than $40 million , is valued below Pebble's existing debts and obligations, according to Bloomberg . Fitbit will not assume Pebble's debt, and is selling off the majority of the company's assets, including existing inventory and IT support equipment. The vast majority of Pebble's products will be discontinued, including the Pebble 2 which recently started shipping to Kickstarter backers. The Time 2 and Pebble Core will be cancelled, and backers will be refunded. Most of the company's employees will be out of a job as a result of the acquistion. Only 40 percent of the employee base has been offered a position at Fitbit's San Francisco headquarters —the remainder will be let go outright, or offered a severance package. Money from the sale will go primarily to Pebble's debt holders and main equity investors. Sources familiar with the matter say that the Pebble stock given to them is essentially worthless. After a long head start, Fitbit appears to be on the losing end of its battle with Apple regarding wearable technology profits. A recent study regarding holiday season revenue suggests that the Apple Watch is reaping about half of the segment's revenue , similar to the dominance it holds with smartphone profits . Fitbit's offerings are mostly less expensive than Apple's, with a less robust feature set than the Apple Watch. Topics:",

      "text": "Getty Images Pokemon Go on Apple iPhones Shares of Sprint gained 7 percent Wednesday after the carrier announced an exclusive wireless partnership with Niantic, the publisher and developer of \"Pokemon Go.\" \nThe two companies are collaborating to create \"a special 'Pokemon Go' experience\" in more than 10,500 Sprint, Boost Mobile and \"Sprint at Radioshack\" locations across the U.S. Beginning Dec. 12, players can visit select locations and engage with the game by collecting Pokeballs and eggs to help them advance in the game. \nAfter the \"Pokemon Go\" launch in July, it quickly became the biggest mobile game in U.S. history. The augmented reality game reached no. 1 on the Apple App Store within 24 hours, and attracted just under 21 million daily active users across the country. Within three days, the game had attracted more users than Twitter and rose to the top of the App Store's revenue charts. \nNiantic had previously struck a deal with McDonald's in Japan to turn 3,000 of the fast food restaurants into \"gyms\" where players can battle each other. The game brought in $200 million in net revenue globally on the App Store and Google Play in its first month, beating other top games such as \"Candy Crush\" and \"Clash Royale.\" \n\"This collaboration with \" Pokemon Go\" brings together two innovative, groundbreaking and creative brands that will offer trainers greater accessibility and destinations to advance their game,\" Sprint CEO Marcelo Claure said in a news release . \nOn Tuesday, Sprint's majority owner, Softbank, announced a deal to invest $50 billion in the U.S., aiming to create 50,000 jobs. The stock climbed as much as 6 percent before paring those gains and ending the session about 1.5 percent higher on the day. SoftBank owns about 80 percent of the telecom company, and bought British chipmaker ARM Holdings earlier this year. \nSprint's stock is up more than 140 percent year to date, according to FactSet.\n—CNBC's Arjun Kharpal, Berkely Lovelace and Jacob Pramuk contributed to this report.",

The new chip will provide 27% better performance with 40% less energy consumption. We also passed along the results of the GFXBench benchmark test , which measured the graphics crunching capabilities of the Adreno 540 GPU. Now, the new Snapdragon 835 chipset has been benchmarked by AnTuTu where it scored 181,434. That topped the previous peak score of 172,644 tallied by the Apple A10 chipset employed by the Apple iPhone 7 Plus . The Snapdragon 835 chipset is equipped with an octa-core CPU, the first Snapdragon chip to run eight cores since the Snapdragon 810 caused controversy by overheating frequently.The prototype that ran the Snapdragon 821 SoC on AnTuTu carries a 5.9-inch screen with a 1440 x 2560 resolution. It features 4GB of RAM with 64GB of internal storage. Android 7.0 is running the show. The prototype is supposed to be equivalent to the typical specs found on the high-end phones that will be powered by the Snapdragon 835 SoC.. \nThe Snapdragon 835 SoC rings up a new record benchmark score on AnTuTu",

      "text": "\nThe Samsung Galaxy S8 will have no headphone jack, and possibly no home button just like Apple’s iPhone 7.\nOn Tuesday, Sam Mobile reported that the South Korean tech company’s upcoming smartphone would have a USB Type-C port instead of a 3.5mm headphone jack. \nSamsung’s decision to design the Galaxy S8 with no headphone jack is expected to enable the company make the smartphone much thinner, and also make room for more battery space.\nApple was arguably the first tech company to ditch the standard 3.5mm headphone jack with its iPhone 7, which was released in September. The Cupertino-based received a backlash due to its decision to do away with the headphone jack. However, Apple defended the move, saying it was a display of “courage” to do something new and beneficial. Many other companies have since hopped on the bandwagon.\nA man passes by Samsung Electronics Galaxy Note 7 smartphones in a shop. [Image by Ahn Young-joon/AP Photo] Just as Apple’s decision to abandon the 3.5mm headphone jack is said to have supported the sales of its AirPods, Samsung’s move in a similar direction would also benefit the sales of its Gear IconX.\nWhile it is noteworthy that the Galaxy S8 will have no headphone jack, this would not be Samsung’s first smartphone without the seemingly ubiquitous headphone port. The ill-fated Galaxy Note 7 did not also come with the 3.5mm headphone jack. The device had a USB-Type C port instead. Since Samsung was forced to recall and stop production of the Galaxy Note 7 due to the battery of the device exploding, the upcoming Galaxy S8 would be the only smartphone from the company with a USB-Type C port.\nThe Samsung Galaxy S8 smartphone is expected to be unveiled at the Mobile World Congress (MWC) in Barcelona, Spain next year. Building the Galaxy S8 with no headphone jack could give Samsung the chance to improve the speaker of the smartphone.\nFon Arena has reported that its sources claim the Galaxy S8 would come with dual stereo speakers , like the iPhone 7. The speakers and the technology powering them would reportedly be designed by Harman. Samsung purchased Harman in a deal worth $8 billion in November to strengthen its connected car business. Neither Samsung nor Harman has confirmed or denied the reports about the dual speaker technology of the Galaxy S8.\nBesides making the Galaxy S8 with no headphone jack and allegedly opting for dual stereo speakers like the iPhone 7, Samsung could also be taking inspiration from Apple in another way. According to Sam Mobile , there is a possibility that the Galaxy S8 would not come with a physical home button like its predecessors. Instead, the smartphone could have an ultrasonic fingerprint scanner fitted under the screen. Removing the home button would give Samsung the opportunity to design the upcoming device with edge-to-edge display.\nThe Samsung Galaxy Note 5 on display in a store. [Image by Andrew Burton/Getty Images] Since the Galaxy S8 would have no headphone jack, Samsung could build the device with a large and powerful battery. Following the battery debacle of the Galaxy Note 7, Samsung is expected to give its upcoming smartphone with a powerful battery in a bid to win back the confidence of customers. There are rumors that the Galaxy S8 would have a removable battery. There have also been talks that Samsung has changed its battery supplier.\nThe Galaxy S8 will allegedly boast of some cutting-edge features including an artificial intelligence (AI) assistant and an improved camera set up. The upcoming smartphone is also expected to be compatible with virtual reality (VR) content out of the box. Samsung would reportedly release two versions of the Galaxy S8; one with a 6.2-inch display without any bezel, and another with a 5.2-inch curved display and a thin bezel.\nWill you miss not having a headphone jack on the Galaxy S8?\n[Featured Image by David Ramos/Getty Images]\nGalaxy S8 No Headphone Jack, No Home Button, Samsung Apparently Taking Cues From Apple is an article from: The Inquisitr News \n",

      "text": "Some good news in the direction of Samsung–it’s pay-out to Apple for copying has been overturned. We’re not saying Samsung really did copy the iPhone design but that’s the reason why the South Korean tech giant needs to pay the Cupertino company $400 million in damages. The decision is overturned in the United States and the Supreme Court is in the process of reassessing the case. Samsung filed a counter complaint earlier this year and said there’s be a miscalculation in the damages, no thanks to the arguments given by Apple.\nThe Federal Circuit is once again looking into the lawsuit and is expected to make a ruling on the $400 million figure and say if it’s the correct amount. Samsung is arguing that those patents only covered one part of the phone so the amount shouldn’t be that high. Of course, the court said phones are sold as one whole device and not as parts so full prices and revenues must be considered.\nWe’ll wait for the new decision to be handed down in the coming weeks. For now, we can say Samsung isn’t in a good place. The amount may be small for both Samsung and Apple but we all know this isn’t just about money. Apple just wants the world to know that Samsung is a copycat. We’re not saying it is one but this Apple-Samsung battle has been going on for years. We don’t think there will be an end to it soon. We’re just hoping Samsung will rise from the Note 7 failure and do better next year.\nVIA: SlashGear\nStory Timeline Samsung Pay faces tight competition against Android Pay, Apple Pay Samsung Pay plans to take on Apple Pay, won't charge transaction fees Samsung Pay satisfies more consumers than Apple Pay, study says Apple, Samsung being challenged by other players, changes in market",

      "text": "December 07, 2016 \niPhones are not only shutting down unexpectedly in China, but apparently they’re also exploding. \nShanghai Consumer Council (SHCC), a consumer watchdog group chaired by a Shanghai member of the Municipal People’s Congress, put up a notice on its website on Dec. 2 that eight iPhones reportedly exploded from Sept. 1 to Nov. 30. The group highlighted two specific cases involving an iPhone 6 and 6s Plus: \nMr. Zhang reported to the SHCC that his iPhone 6 (bought in November 2014) suddenly started smoking and spontaneously self-combusted in standby mode on Sept. 30 this year. \nMs. Chen reported to the SHCC that an iPhone 6s Plus (bought in March 2015) spontaneously self-combusted, cracking the screen and the phone’s back with a blackening battery on Aug. 31 this year. Apple gave Chen a new one in the same model without offering a detailed explanation. iPhones explode in china too // iPhone在中国也炸了充电时手机直接炸开差点着火_腾讯网触屏版 https://t.co/zew60BA4Jo pic.twitter.com/APc6w8gZ1r \n— John Artman (@KnowsNothing) December 5, 2016 \nApple told Quartz that it had analyzed some “thermal units” and found they “have clearly shown that external physical damage happened to them which led to the thermal event.” It insisted it has “found no cause for concern with these products.” \nThe new allegations are the latest wrinkle in an ongoing dispute between Apple and China. In November, the China Consumers Association, a consumer watchdog group affiliated with China’s State Council (chaired by premier Li Keqiang), demanded answers from Apple after many Chinese users reported their iPhone 6 and 6s devices were abruptly shutting down. \nThe group was dissatisfied with Apple’s response when the Cupertino, California, company insisted the problem affected only a “ very small number of iPhone 6s devices ” and offered to replace customers’ iPhone batteries . The China Consumers Association said the problem was much more widespread than Apple has admitted to. An Apple representative says the company is releasing a new software update next week to gather more information about the unexpected iPhone shutdowns. \nAlong with its recent notice about the iPhone explosions, SHCC said it had received 2,763 consumer complaints of Apple products from Jan. 1 to Nov. 30, twice that of 2015. Nearly half of the complaints were made in the past two months alone. \nNeither Chinese media nor consumers seem pleased with Apple’s explanations so far. “Apple’s consecutive decline in revenues and profits (paywall) has shown that Apple is sliding and if the combustions were to cause bigger influence, Apple might very likely walking Samsung’s path,” Beijing Business Today wrote on Dec. 6 (link in Chinese). \nA Weibo user (link in Chinese, registration required), meanwhile, has described iPhones as “time bombs” in people’s pockets. “There are so many iPhone users, so it’s like everyone’s walking with a time bomb? What happened if the mobiles explode like Samsung Note 7? ” \nThe full statement from Apple is below: \nTitle: Statement regarding Thermal Events \nWe appreciate that customers are more concerned than ever about the performance and safety of batteries in their mobile devices. SHCC recently published accounts of a small number of iPhones which reportedly experienced thermal incidents. We want to assure our customers that we thoroughly investigate any such report. We have been in touch with the customers and retrieved these units for analysis. \nAs part of our standard process, we do a thorough forensic investigation including CT scans, cross sections, and more. The units we’ve analyzed so far have clearly shown that external physical damage happened to them which led to the thermal event. We treat safety as a top priority and have found no cause for concern with these products. \nWe encourage any customer who experiences an issue with an Apple product to visit an Apple Store or an Apple Authorized Service Provider, or to contact Apple Support.

      "text": "Last week, we reported an increasing number of early adopters experiencing concerning graphics issues on the new MacBook Pro.\n\nAll late 2016 MacBook Pro models appear to be affected, including standard 13-inch and 15-inch configurations with AMD Radeon Pro 450 or AMD Radeon Pro 455 graphics, but the issues appear to be most prevalent on the high-end 15-inch model with built-to-order AMD Radeon Pro 460 graphics.\n15-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar exhibiting graphics issues (jscooper22)\n\nUser complaints have continued to surface over the past five days, with new videos emerging showing the usual symptoms, ranging from brightly colored flickering and full-screen checkerboard patterns to screen tearing and visual artifacts. Affected systems sometimes become unresponsive or crash due to a kernel panic, requiring some new MacBook Pro users to perform a hard restart.\n\nSeparately, a number of users continue to report brief glitches during the boot up process on new MacBook Pro models, particularly along the bottom of the screen. It appears this issue is related to FileVault 2 startup disk encryption, as the glitches go away for many of these users once the feature is disabled.\nApple has yet to publicly acknowledge or comment on the graphics issues, but in a supposed email response to a MacRumors forum member, Apple software engineering chief Craig Federighi allegedly said he believes the problems have been resolved in the latest macOS Sierra 10.12.2 beta released on Monday. As a point of emphasis, this email response has not been verified.\n\nHi,\n\nThanks for your note! We believe we have addressed all of these graphics issues in the latest beta of Sierra 10.12.2 (available at beta.apple.com).\n\nI hope that you enjoy your new MacBook Pro — it’s a fantastic machine!\n\n- craig\n\nWhile we have yet to verify the authenticity of the email beyond a reasonable doubt, there is some unscientific evidence to suggest it could be real:• Although it could easily be faked, the response appears to resemble previous email responses sent by Federighi\n• The user who shared the email response is a longtime MacRumors forum member who registered his account in June 2007\n• Apple executives appear to be increasingly using email as a vehicle to subtly address customer questions and concerns\n• MacRumors viewed a lengthy follow-up email the user received from Apple's Executive Relations team, which appears to be legitimate\n\nReports from affected users running the latest macOS Sierra beta are slim at this point, but at least one forum member claims to still be experiencing graphics issues on the fifth and latest macOS Sierra beta.\nmacOS Sierra 10.12.2 should be publicly released later this month, so additional user reports should soon prove if the graphics issues have truly been fixed.Related Roundups: MacBook Pro, macOS Sierra\nBuyer's Guide: MacBook Pro (Buy Now)\n\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

Wolfe December 7, 2016 \nLast month, Apple’s App Store celebrated a record-breaking month in terms of sales, according to Phil Schiller, the company’s senior vice president of worldwide marketing. \nIn a Twitter post on Wednesday, Schiller celebrated the news by noting: November 2016 was a record breaker for the #AppStore – the highest monthly sales ever in App Store history! \n— Philip Schiller (@pschiller) December 7, 2016 \nThough Schiller didn’t give actual sales numbers, we know that historically the holiday quarter is the best on Apple’s annual calendar. \nIn January , Apple said that the 2015 Christmas season was the App Store’s “biggest ever,” seeing iOS app sales of a record-breaking $1 billion in total. More than likely, Apple will surpass that number this year.",

      "text": "When Apple announced its new iPhone in September, the news was overshadowed by a goofy plumber with a bushy mustache and bright blue overalls: Nintendo unveiled its first-ever smartphone game starring its biggest icon, Super Mario himself. \nNintendo/Apple \n\"Super Mario Run\" arrives on December 15 for $10 , and it's coming to the iPhone/iPad first thanks to a deal struck between Nintendo and Apple. Nintendo creative director Shigeru Miyamoto even appeared on stage to announce it — Miyamoto is essentially the Walt Disney of video games, having created Mario, Link, Donkey Kong, and many other iconic Nintendo characters. \nFor Miyamoto to appear on stage with Apple's Tim Cook was, to put it lightly, a very big deal. \nLeft: Nintendo creative director Shigeru Miyamoto | Right: Apple CEO Tim Cook Stephen Lam/Getty Images \nIn a Tokyo event on December 7, Sony's mobile gaming unit made a less splashy, broader announcement about Sony's PlayStation games: 10 smartphone titles are in the works, with six planned for launch in the coming fiscal year. \nUnlike Nintendo's approach, Sony's leading with lesser-known games from PlayStation's past — music/rhythm game \"PaRappa the Rapper\" and tactical role-playing game \"Arc the Lad,\" according to a report from Reuters . Also unlike Nintendo's approach, it appears that Sony's targeting Japan first; the games will arrive on iPhone and Android in Japan and other parts of Asia before going worldwide. \nThis makes particular sense for the \"Arc the Lad\" series — it's wildly popular in Japan. \n\"Arc The Lad: Twilight of the Spirits\" on the PlayStation 2. This game is actually available on the PlayStation 4 as well. Sony \nIt's unclear if the mobile versions of these games are direct ports of the original PlayStation 1 games; we've asked Sony and not yet heard back, but there's precedent. Sony's done as much in the past — a variety of PlayStation 1 games were sold on mobile phones under the \"PlayStation Mobile\" name. Sony's Xperia Play phone even had a built-in gamepad specifically for use with these types of games. \nOf course, if you're interested in playing classic (and new) PlayStation games on-the-go right now, there's always the PlayStation Vita. Sony's plan is to start selling these games sometime after April 2017 — we've asked for a full list of games and more information, but haven't heard back as of publishing. EXCLUSIVE FREE REPORT:",

      "text": "| Follow About | \nEye On Apple covers the latest hot news stories, rumors and illuminating discussions about Apple and its products. Product coverage includes Apple Watch, Mac, iPhone, iPad, Apple Pay, Apple TV. Opinion Is Apple milking the iPhone too much? Apple is taking a lot of heat for failing to update the Mac, ditching its AirPort routers, and for not selling its own monitors. Is the company betting too much on the iPhone? CIO | Dec 7, 2016 8:10 AM PT Email a friend Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. More like this \nApple is in a strange situation these days, the company is under siege by some in the media and by some of its own customers. Disappointment is probably the key emotion being felt by many long-time Apple observers and customers. \nHere’s a quick overview of why some people are very unhappy with Apple right now: \n1. No new Mac mini for three years \n2. No new Mac Pro for three years \n3. No new iPad Air for three years \n4. iPhone design has been the same for three years \n5. No 4K in the Apple TV \n6. No more monitors made by Apple \n7. No more AirPort routers \nAnd I'm not kidding when I say that some people are very unhappy with Apple right now. Take a look at the Apple, Inc and Tech Industry section of the MacRumors forum to see what some Apple users are saying about the company. \nHere are just a few of the threads in there that underscore the anger and disappointment of some Apple fans: \nMicrosoft innovates while Apple becomes stale Milking the iPhone at the expense of other products \nSo what exactly is Apple doing that is irritating so many people? Well one writer at Above Avalon thinks that Apple has decided to milk the iPhone for all its worth (even at the expense of the company's other products), and in doing so hopes to build an unbeatable ecosystem. \nNeil Cybart reports for Above Avalon: \nIt feels like cracks are forming at Apple's edges. The company is straining to push out hardware updates. Supply issues are getting worse. Apple is reportedly moving away from selling beloved products like stand-alone displays and wireless routers. Meanwhile, Microsoft, Amazon, and Snap are gaining buzz with new niche hardware while Apple appears to be hanging back and resting on its laurels. \nSomething feels off with Apple, and the blame is increasingly pointed at Tim Cook. I suspect these feelings are a result of Cook betting now is the time to milk the iPhone. Apple is doubling down on the iPhone to build one of the world's most formidable tech ecosystems, and few are taking notice. \nApple is confident we are still in the era where it makes sense to milk the iPhone. Consumers are giving even more tasks to their smartphones. This may continue for another two years, or maybe even five years. While Apple may be building a sandcastle around the iPhone today, the company will need to find the next big wave that may topple that very same sandcastle. \nMore at Above Avalon What if consumers move past the iPhone? \nI found Neil’s article to be quite interesting, and I can understand if Apple’s management wants to bolster the iPhone’s ecosystem. In the short term that probably makes good financial sense. Unfortunately, over the long term it opens the door for Apple’s competitors to bypass it if users begin to move beyond the smartphone and into new categories of devices. \nI was at a friend’s house recently, and was surprised to see that he had Amazon’s Alexa product sitting on his kitchen table. He seemed quite taken with it, and the other folks there for brunch were also smitten with it. People kept yelling commands at the device to see how it would respond, and it did pretty well considering all the different voices being used. \nI started to wonder why Apple doesn’t offer a product like Alexa, since it seems pretty clear that voice assistants are becoming increasingly popular with some households. Oh sure, Apple has the Apple TV and my friend owns one of those too, but watching TV is not the same thing as what Alexa does. \nHere’s a brand new product category that seems to be taking off fairly quickly, and Amazon (and Google) seem to have beaten Apple to the punch yet again. It makes me wonder if focusing on the iPhone so much has caused Apple to drop the ball in other product categories. \nApple’s Siri might not be up to the task when it comes to competing with a product like Alexa. That could be why Apple has not released its own in-home voice assistant. But the company has had years to fix Siri and get it right, at this point maybe it should consider dumping Siri and starting fresh? \nThe larger point here is that Apple cannot rely on the iPhone alone in the years ahead. It must be very wary about consumers moving on from smartphones and into new product categories. Being so dependent on the iPhone could be a big vulnerability if people move past smartphones too soon. The Mac still matters in a big way too \nI noted above the lack of updates to the Mac Pro and Mac mini. To me this is one of Apple’s biggest mistakes right now. The Mac is still a very important product for Apple and, more importantly, for its customers. \nPeople still need desktop computers and if Apple’s hardware lags behind for years, some customers will dump their Macs and move to Windows or Linux computers. Why would anyone buy a Mac Pro at this point, given that computer’s old hardware? Some people have been waiting forever to buy an updated Mac Pro, and they are getting tired of waiting. \nIf Apple is going to charge premium prices for its Macs, then it had better make sure they have the latest CPUs and graphics cards. Otherwise there might be a slow but steady drift away from the Mac by people who are sick of waiting for updated hardware. \nThe iPhone is Apple’s biggest and most important product, but the company still needs the Mac. The longer Apple lets the Mac drift without being updated, the more customers it risks losing to other platforms. \nApple is playing a very dangerous game by milking the iPhone while letting the Mac languish, and it might come back to haunt the company eventually. \nDid you miss a post?

      "text": "\n-Although Apple’s plans for the world of self-driving cars remain opaque, the tech behemoth has taken a keen interest in the federal government’s new policy on autonomous vehicles . \n-In five pages of comments submitted to regulators, a top Apple executive outlined the company’s position on the new Federal Automated Vehicles Policy and offered suggestions on how it could be clarified to accelerate the process of putting test vehicles on U.S. roads.\n-The letter gave no hint on whether or when Apple is planning to introduce its own autonomous vehicles or provide self-driving technology to another company that produces cars. But Steve Kenner, director of product integrity at Apple, nonetheless conveyed enthusiasm for a foray into autonomous vehicles.\n-“The company is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation,” he wrote in comments submitted to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) on Nov. 22.\n- - “ - “By sharing data, the industry will build a more comprehensive dataset than any one company could\n-create alone.” – Steve Kenner, Apple\n- - ” - -His comments generally supported the major planks of the Federal Automated Vehicles Policy, which federal leaders unveiled in late September, including plans for a 15-point safety assessment of autonomous cars and the development of a network in which competing companies could share anonymized data on autonomous crashes and near misses.\n-“By sharing data, the industry will build a more comprehensive dataset than any one company could create alone,” Kenner wrote. “This will allow everyone in the industry to design systems to better detect and respond to the broadest set of nominal and edge-case scenarios.”\n-Kenner emphasizes these shared datasets should be stripped of any identifying data to ensure motorist and vehicular privacy. He went further, proposing that the auto industry should create privacy standards that are more stringent than the ones adopted by the Auto Alliance , the main lobbying arm of major OEMs, in November 2014.\n-Apple’s top concern isn’t necessarily one that arises in the policy, but it’s one that a revised policy could potentially fix. A provision in the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation (FAST) Act , enacted into law in December 2015, permits established manufacturers to test new technologies on public roads without the need to receive an exemption from federal motor vehicle safety standards. But that doesn’t extend to newer entrants into transportation.\n- \n-“To maximize the safety benefits of automated vehicles, encourage innovation, and promote fair competition, established manufacturers and new entrants should be treated equally,” Kenner wrote.\n-While NHTSA can’t override the FAST Act–that would require an act of Congress–regulators could amend the policy to state that exemptions are not required for testing of vehicles on public roads, as long as they are never used by the general public. NHTSA has already signaled its willingness to give prompt attention to the exemption process to help new innovations that may not conform to the safety standards.\n-In a separate section of its comments on the policy, Apple said that, while it supports the 15-point safety assessment, it’s concerned about a section that asks companies to submit documents four months before testing on public roads takes place.\n-“As written, the safety assessment provision of the policy could be interpreted as requiring preapproval by NHTSA prior to testing,” Kenner wrote. “This could result in a testing blackout period while NHTSA reviews the safety assessment.”\n-Overall, Apple offered NHTSA high compliments on the policy development, something the agency isn’t accustomed to receiving from the industry it regulates. Apple praised portions that included a discussion of ethical considerations that should be incorporated into vehicle development, the encouragement of the data-sharing network, and a push for model state policies that would help avoid a patchwork approach that subjects manufacturers to different laws in different states.\n- - No, McLaren Won’t Be Sold to Apple, McLaren Says - iMaybe: What We Know about the Apple Car - Ford Hopes to Fend Off Apple, Google in Infotainment - -In July, Apple undertook a high-profile shift in the direction of its autonomous-car project—if developments in a secret project can be described as high profile. The company, which has never publicly acknowledged that it’s working on a vehicle, tapped longtime executive Bob Mansfield to take over its self-driving-car program, dubbed Project Titan, according to many reports .\n-While Kenner’s letter to NHTSA didn’t delve into details of how Apple intends to deploy its machine learning and automated technologies in the realm of transportation, it does, if anything, confirm that the project exists and that Apple remains hard at work.\n- ",

      "text": "Dec 7, 2016 12:18pm Apple's iPhone 7 \nApple’s iOS claimed 40.5 percent of the U.S. smartphone market for the three months ending in October, according to Kantar Worldpanel ComTech, marking the platform’s biggest gains in its home market in more than two years. \nThe operating system’s market was up from 33.5 percent a year ago and was the highest share since Apple owned 42.8 of the U.S. smartphone market during the three months ending January 2015. Android claimed 57.9 percent of the market as its share slid year over year for the fifth consecutive time, Kantar said . \n“The lack of the headphone jack has proved to be a non-issue for U.S. iPhone consumers, as iPhone 7 was the top selling device in the three months ending October 2016, achieving 10.6 percent of smartphone sales, despite not being available for the full three-month period. (The) iPhone 7 Plus was the fourth best-selling device at 5.3 percent, behind the iPhone 6s and Samsung Galaxy S7,” Lauren Guenveur, consumer insight director for Kantar, said in a prepared announcement. “Google achieved .5 percent of smartphone sales, a strong showing given that the Pixel was only widely available from October 20. In that short time, Google has reached market parity with more established brands like Huawei and Microsoft, who are also at .5 percent.” \nIndeed, iOS saw year-over-year growth in every market Kantar measured other than Germany and urban China. It claimed 51.7 percent of the smartphone market in Japan and 44 percent in Great Britain. \nThe iPhone 7 was the second best-selling phone in urban China during the period, however, Kantar reported, capturing 3.8 percent of all smartphone sales. The iPhone 7 Plus claimed 1.9 percent of smartphone sales in urban China, as iOS’s share of the market grew to 17.1 percent, outpacing Xiaomi’s 15.9 percent. \nThose figures demonstrate significant progress for Apple, which has struggled to compete in China this year as several homegrown handset vendors have emerged as major players. IDC said recently that Apple’s share of the massive Chinese smartphone market slid by more than a third in the latest quarter as Oppo, Vivo, Huawei and Xiaomi all outperformed their U.S. counterpart.

      "text": "Dec 7, 2016 11:33am Apple Watch Series 2. \nApple holds the dubious distinction of leading a worldwide smartwatch market that has fallen flat, according to fresh data from IDC. But the company insists sales of the Apple Watch are stronger than ever. \nThe market research firm reported this week that the overall wearables market grew 3.1 percent year over year in the third quarter. That modest traction was almost entirely to demand for fitness bands, which saw double-digit growth and accounted for 85 percent of the wearables market. \nFitbit shipped 5.3 million units to lead the market with a 23 percent share, seeing 11 percent growth, followed in order by Xiaomi and Garmin. Apple claimed a mere 4.9 percent of the wearables market as Apple Watch shipments plummeted 71 percent, IDC estimated, although the company still owned 41 percent of the smartwatch market. \n“Apple’s decision to launch its second-generation watches in mid-September, towards the end of the quarter, did contribute to its year-over-year decline in 3Q16,” IDC wrote. “However, the primary reasons for the downturn were an aging lineup and an unintuitive user interface. Though both issues have been addressed with the latest generation of watches, Apple’s success will likely be muted as the smartwatch category continues to be challenged.” \nApple CEO Tim Cook told Reuters this week that the company’s smartwatch recently saw record-high sales, however. Cook didn’t exactly refute IDC’s data—and he declined to give specific sales figures—but he claimed the gadget “looks to be one of the most popular holiday gifts this year,” Reuters reported . \n“Sales growth is off the charts,” Cook reportedly said via email. “In fact, during the first week of holiday shopping, our sell-through of Apple Watch was greater than any week in the product’s history. And as we expected, we’re on track for the best quarter ever for Apple Watch.” \nAs The Register observed , it’s possible that both Cook and IDC are making accurate claims. Record-high one-week sales of the Apple Watch 2 might not have done much to offset dismal sales earlier in the quarter, and it’s certainly conceivable that momentum could carry through the holidays. \nBut the smartwatch sector has clearly failed to live up to a significant amount of hype. IDC reported in October that global smartwatch shipments sank 52 percent in the third quarter due to a lack of new devices and platforms. Meanwhile, Pebble was acquired this week by Fitbit for less than $40 million, according to a Bloomberg report, although its debt and other obligations exceed that sum. And Lenovo’s Motorola said last week that it has scratched plans to release a new smartwatch, saying demand simply doesn’t warrant it. \nThe smartwatch market isn’t dead, of course, but developers and vendors have yet to come up with devices consumers find truly valuable. And it may take a few more years before they do so. \n“Smart wearables have been down in recent quarters, but clearly not out,” IDC Research Manager Ramon Llamas said in the firm’s press release. “As user tastes change, so will their needs. That’s the opportunity for smart wearables with multi-functionality and third-party applications, both for consumers and business users. To get there, we need to see more intuitive user interfaces, seamless user experiences, standalone connectivity, and applications that go beyond health and fitness and into personal and professional productivity.” Read more on",

      "text": "Ian Hardy \nDecember 7, 2016 12:55pm \nApple unveiled its 2016 “best of” year-end list yesterday, revealing the year’s top selling App Store apps, games, books and movies. Topping the list were Canadian-made Severed by Toronto-based Drinkbox Studios and Chameleon Run by Saskatchewan-based company Noodlecake Studios. \nIn a tweet sent out today, Phil Schiller, Apple’s senior vice president of worldwide marketing, said that November 2016 saw “the highest monthly sales ever in App Store history.” Unfortunately, in the company’s usual style, Schiller did not provide exact numbers, nor did he say how much money went to app creators. \nApple recently embarked upon cleaning up the App Store. In just the last month, the company has reportedly delisted over 50,000 outdated and abandoned apps. \nThe App Store officially launched on July 9th, 2008. It now has over 2 million available apps to download, and the company has paid out over $50 billion dollars to developers.",

Users can now select from all repair centers nearby, in the \"bring in for repair\" step of the check-in process.\n\nThe list of repair venues can be sorted by distance, or earliest possible appointment for most vendors —with third party options often being available much sooner than service at an Apple Store. Some Apple Specialists listed in options for service don't have availability data provided to the system, so users with a favorite third-party repair shop should call ahead for that information, rather than relying on the online appointment generator.\n\n\n\nBesides some long-time Apple Specialists, repair venues include some iPhone service centers, Best Buy, Microcenter, and Computercare, among others. Third-party shops can also offer services that Apple Stores don't, like drive capacity increases in compatible models, service on older devices no longer officially supported by Apple, or other upgrades as available for a particular computer.\n\nApple TV, and Apple Watch service and support remains limited to Apple Stores.",

      "text": "Apple Watch sales to consumers set record in holiday week, says Apple's Cook Tue Dec 6, 2016 12:30am EST [ - ] Text [ + ] \nBy Julia Love \nSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Sales of the Apple Watch to consumers set a record during the first week of holiday shopping, and the current quarter is on track to be the best ever for the product, Apple Inc AAPL.O Chief Executive Tim Cook told Reuters. \nResponding to an email from Reuters, Cook said the gadget's sell-through - a measure of how many units are sold to consumers, rather than simply stocked on retailers' shelves - reached a new high. \nCook's comments followed a report on Monday from technology research firm IDC estimating that the tech giant sold 1.1 million units of the Apple Watch during the third quarter of 2016, down 71 percent from the year-ago quarter. The comments offer a glimpse of the gadget's performance during the holiday quarter, which is typically Apple's strongest. \n\"Our data shows that Apple Watch is doing great and looks to be one of the most popular holiday gifts this year,\" Cook wrote. \n\"Sales growth is off the charts. In fact, during the first week of holiday shopping, our sell-through of Apple Watch was greater than any week in the product’s history. And as we expected, we’re on track for the best quarter ever for Apple Watch,\" he said. \nCook did not respond to a request for specific sales figures for the gadget. \nApple has disclosed few details about the performance of the Apple Watch, its first new product released under Cook. The company has not broken out sales of the gadget in its earnings, instead lumping it into an \"other products\" category that includes devices such as the iPod and Apple TV. \nStrong sales of the Apple Watch are to be expected during the holiday quarter as the gadget is a more natural gift than some of the company's other products such as the iPhone or Mac computer, said analyst Bob O'Donnell of TECHnalysis Research. Apple also lowered the price of the gadget this year, potentially helping the holiday sales comparison, O'Donnell noted. Continued... ",

      "text": "Apple says iPhone 6 battery fires in China likely caused by external factors Tue Dec 6, 2016 10:57pm EST [ - ] Text [ + ] \nBEIJING (Reuters) - Apple Inc said external factors were the likely cause of iPhone 6 battery fires detailed in a Chinese consumer protection report that featured widely in state media earlier this week and created a buzz on social media. \nThe Shanghai Consumer Council released a report on Friday detailing battery fires in eight iPhone 6 handsets. It also detailed iPhone 6 handsets powering down before their batteries are depleted - handsets outside of a global iPhone 6 recall range that Apple announced on Nov. 20 to address the issue. \n\"The units we've analyzed so far have clearly shown that external physical damage happened to them which led to the thermal event,\" an Apple spokeswoman said in an emailed statement to Reuters late on Tuesday. She also said Apple was widening its investigation into the power-down issue. \nThe U.S. tech firm has seen Chinese sales fall over the past three quarters as domestic smartphone makers compete with high-spec handsets at low price points. It is hoping to bounce back in the first quarter of next year with its iPhone 7. \nBut domestic handset makers also likely received a boost after South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co Ltd recalled 2.5 million Note 7 handsets globally following a series of battery fires, raising distrust of foreign smartphone brands, according to users, analysts and consumer groups. \nThe Shanghai Consumer Council in its report said that during Samsung's recall in October-November, complaints involving Apple products jumped, accounting for almost half the year-to-date total of 2763 - itself a nearly two-fold increase from 2015. \n\"The Samsung case did make (Chinese smartphone users) start to think an international brand doesn't necessarily equal a safe product,\" said Nicole Peng, Asia-Pacific director at researcher Canalys. \nState media outlets featuring the Shanghai council's report on Monday garnered tens of thousands of comments on social media. While many doubted the iPhone 6 was at fault, top-ranking comments expressed frustration that foreign brands could set high prices and yet not guarantee safety. \n\"I still worry about the iPhone in case there is indeed a problem, but it's not investigated,\" said Mr. Liu, a 21-year-old student in Beijing.

The cuts this year are not as bad as was seen last year , for example: While we do expect the recent forecast reductions to be a headwind for semiconductor suppliers with iPhone exposure in the March quarter, these cuts are not of the same magnitude of reductions for the iPhone 6s when cuts began in December 2015 and continued with additional reductions in January and April 2016.",

( YHOO ) for a lot of money, told Congress why the deal should be allowed. Cuban, reading from prepared remarks, painted for the Congress a picture of a media landscape dominated by a handful of big companies who control content today, chief among them Facebook ( FB ), but also Apple ( AAPL ) and Alphabet ’s ( GOOGL ) Google , because they dominate the apps that people use to “avoid boredom.\"",

Rosenblatt Securities ’s Jun Zhang today reiterates a Neutral rating, and a $102 price target, warning that sales of the iPhone in China , he estimates, are “still weaker than retail channels” as discounting of the phone has popped up across the country. iPhone sales, presumably in dollars, he doesn’t specify -- fell by 6% in November, and are probably down “slightly” from November this month, as discounting takes hold outside of tight supplies at Apple’s online store: Overall iPhone sales in China were down 6% in November and slightly down MoM in November due to some pushes in \"single day\" sales. In our view, iPh- one 7 sales will continue trending down and many retailers in China have al- ready started discounting ($50) the iPhone 7 in November. iPhone 7 Plus sup- ply is catching up in November, and sales have grown MoM in November. iPh- one 6/6S sales continue to be weak. The 7 Plus model currently accounts for 60% of iPhone 7 sales in China. We started seeing some retailers discounting this model in November.",
