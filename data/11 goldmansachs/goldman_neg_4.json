      "title": "Goldman Sachs: Higher Oil Prices Will Benefit Global Economy",
      "text": "November 25, 2016 at 07:18 AM EST Goldman Sachs: Higher Oil Prices Will Benefit Global Economy \nFrom OilPrice.com : OPEC is closing in on a deal to cut production, which will surely cause oil prices to rise. Oil is already almost back to $50 per barrel, so cuts of nearly 1 million barrels per day could boost prices well into the mid-$50s, even up towards $60 per barrel. That will provide a windfall to oil producers around the world and the sacrifice for OPEC members will be more than paid for by higher revenues. For example, Iraqi officials say that for every $1 increase in the price of a barrel of oil, their revenues jump by $1 billion per year. \nAs a result, the odds of rising crude oil prices are high. But while that could be welcomed by the industry, consumers might not be as excited to see cheap gasoline disappear. After all, U.S. motorists have enjoyed two years of incredibly cheap fuel. Will rising oil prices put a dent in already tepid U.S and global economic growth? \nPerhaps not. As Bloomberg reported , Goldman Sachs wrote in a Nov. 22 research note that the global economy could benefit from higher oil prices. That conclusion may not be obvious, but here is the logic the investment bank lays out: Higher oil prices lead to a wave of capital that flows into major oil producing countries such as Saudi Arabia. Unable to use all the capital, Saudi Arabia sends the excess savings back into the global financial system. Banks then use that capital to lend. Interest rates also fall as the financial markets are more liquid. The end result is lower interest rates, more financial liquidity, higher asset values and ultimately greater consumer confidence. In short, higher oil prices could boost economic growth. \nThese conclusions echo those from a team of IMF economists from earlier this year. In March, the IMF said that the assumed connection between oil prices and GDP (falling oil prices will boost GDP as consumers have more money in their pockets) is not as solid as previously thought. Many analysts, including those at the IMF, once assumed that although oil producing countries such as Saudi Arabia would be damaged from low oil prices, the benefits to consuming countries would more than offset those losses, delivering net benefits to the global economy. \nBut over the past two years a surprising trend emerged. Equity prices tended to move in tandem with oil prices; in the past we had grown accustomed to expect the reverse to be true (crude prices rise, stock markets fall). The positive correlation between financial markets and crude oil prices caught many by surprise. \nThe reason that this unexpected link occurred has to do with monetary policy. In the past, central banks including the U.S. Fed would respond to falling oil prices with a cut in interest rates, spurring economic growth. Now, with interest rates near zero, central banks have no firepower left. Falling oil prices is causing some deflationary pressure as a result (falling asset values), and the lack of an interest rate cut means that the real interest rate is actually higher, dampening growth. As a result, the IMF economists argue that the reverse will also be true: a rise in oil prices will push up asset prices, and if central banks hold off on interest rate increases, the effect could be positive for growth. \nWhile that explanation is convoluted and a little bit of a mouthful, Goldman Sachs’ interpretation is much simpler: An integrated financial system means that savings from oil producing countries finds its way back to consumer countries, where it can stimulate growth. The investment bank singles out the early 2000s, in which rising asset prices and global growth came even as oil prices (and prices across a range of commodities) rose substantially. “The difference between today and the 1970s is that oil creates global liquidity through a far more sophisticated financial system,” Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in their note to clients. “More sophisticated financial markets in the 2000s were able to transform this excess savings into greater global liquidity that increased asset values, lowered interest rates, and improved credit conditions that spanned the globe.” \nGoldman says that the surplus in savings outside the U.S. ballooned from $1 trillion to $7 trillion between 2001 and 2014, pushing up asset prices. Of course, that can also have a darker side – asset bubbles in commodities as well as housing also led to widespread financial ruin. \nAll in all, the research from Goldman Sachs suggests that, while it may not be obvious to individual consumers who see higher prices at the pump, there could be a boost to the global economy in the coming months if oil prices rise. \nThe United States Oil Fund LP ETF ( NYSE:USO ) fell $0.11 (-1.03%) to $10.56 per share in premarket trading Friday. Year-to-date, the largest fund tied to WTI oil prices has declined 3%. \nThis article is brought to you courtesy of OilPrice.com .

      "text": "Goldman Weighs in on Commodities, Crude, and Gold PART: Goldman Weighs in on Commodities, Crude, and Gold PART 1 OF 3 Goldman Sachs Gets Bullish on Commodity Prices By David Ashworth | Nov 25, 2016 6:30 pm EST Higher commodity prices \nGoldman Sachs ( GS ) has gone bullish on commodities. The finance major, which is the biggest commodities dealer in terms of sales, has advised its clients to go overweight on commodities. This is the first time in over four years that Goldman has recommended this stance. \nGoldman has likely turned bullish on equities due to its view of manufacturing. It expects manufacturing around the world to pick up next year and lead to a rise in demand for commodities. \nIn its report, Goldman also sounded bullish on iron ore. It raised its estimates for iron ore prices due to the strength in steel usage. Another reason it cited for increasing its price estimates was the recent restocking of inventories of iron ore. China has played a major role \nThe Goldman Sachs team noted that China’s stimulus ( FXI ) ( MCHI ) earlier this year led to an increase in demand for iron ore. The team stated that “During the first ten months of 2016, property sales in China increased 27% YoY (year-over-year), auto sales climbed 14%, and excavator sales jumped 17%.” On inventory restocking, the team informed that China’s port inventory has actually increased in until October 2016, as compared to the destocking witnessed in 2015. \nBut apart from fundamentals, speculation is also a reason behind the rise in iron ore prices. The Goldman team stated: “In recent months, the renewed CNY depreciation against the US dollar and the government’s effort in curbing price appreciation in the real estate market may have led to speculation in the commodities market.” \nThe SPDR S&P Metals & Mining ETF ( XME ) has had an excellent run so far in 2016. The ETF has returned over 110% in the year so far. Donald Trump’s triumph in the US Presidential elections has also provided a fillip to iron ore prices and the XME due to his views on infrastructure spending ( IGF ). \nIn the next part of this series, we’ll take a look at the state of manufacturing—a prime reason why Goldman has upwardly revised its estimates for iron ore prices.

      "text": "The biggest copper rally in almost six years is leaving hedge funds squaring off with Goldman Sachs Group Inc.\nFutures in New York jumped about 20 percent in just a month. The gains were propelled by a drop in London Metal Exchange-monitored inventories and speculation that Donald Trump’s pledges on infrastructure building will increase metals demand. The president-elect seems to have convinced money managers, who boosted their wagers on further price gains to the largest ever.\nThe surge reflects an abrupt change in sentiment — just three weeks ago investors were betting on price declines. While other metals had climbed earlier in 2016, copper was mainly dormant, even as Chinese imports rose. That sparked a rush this month among Asian traders. The frenzy picked up steam after the election victory for Trump, who’s called for $1 trillion of infrastructure investment over the next decade. Now, Goldman says that prices have risen too far too fast.\n“It’s a parabolic move higher, and parabolic moves can’t be sustained,” Donald Selkin, the chief market strategist at National Securities Corp. in New York helping oversee $3 billion, said in a telephone interview.\nNet-Long Holding\nThe net-long position in copper jumped 19 percent to 70,546 futures and options for the week ended Nov. 15, according to Commodity Futures Trading Commission data released three days later. That’s the largest holding in the data, which starts in 2006. Comex futures renewed their advance Monday after capping their first weekly drop in four. The metal rose 1.9 percent to $2.526 a pound by 12:43 p.m. in Shanghai for an 18 percent gain this year.\nGlobal copper inventories tracked by the LME have slumped 32 percent since the end of September, snapping six months of gains and signaling that demand may be accelerating. The decline for supplies comes as Trump, who secured a win in the Nov. 8 U.S. election, reiterated the importance of infrastructure spending in his victory speech.\nMining shares have fared well in the aftermath. Freeport-McMoRan Inc., the largest publicly traded copper producer, has jumped 14 percent since election night. Jefferies Group LLC said producers of mined commodities will benefit through the next year from the prospect of more infrastructure spending. Copper is used in pipes for buildings and in wiring for electric grids.\nBut Freeport’s Chief Executive Officer Richard Adkerson had a more measured view of the election than some investors, saying it will take more than Trump to keep prices rallying.\n‘Global Economy’\n“In terms of being a long-term driver of copper prices, it will have an impact but not a huge impact,” Adkerson said Nov. 16 in an interview at Freeport’s office in Lima. “For copper demand to be robust requires a positive economic situation in China, in the world’s global economy.”\nGoldman said last week the copper market became too bullish too quickly, even as it was forced to increase its three-month LME copper estimate 16 percent to $5,000 a metric ton from $4,300. The bank raised its 12-month estimate to $4,800 from $4,200. Their view remains below the current price of copper for delivery in three months, which settled Friday at $5,423, averaging $4,767.54 in 2016. The bank sees gains for supply amidst a modest slowing of Chinese demand growth.\nDemand for the metal is currently falling short of production by about 400,000 tons, according to researcher CRU Group. To erase that glut, U.S. copper use would need to increase 25 percent, while China’s consumption would need to grow by 4 percent above the baseline view, Robert Edwards, a managing consultant at CRU, said in an interview last week at an industry conference in Naples, Florida.\n“The market is definitely going to pull back some of those gains, because that is what happens until there’s further evidence to underpin the move with more concrete infrastructure spending plans,” said Quincy Krosby, a market strategist at Prudential Financial Inc. in Newark, New Jersey. “There’s definitely going to be zigs and zags in the trajectory of copper prices.”\nBefore it’s here, it’s on the Bloomberg Terminal.\nSource: Bloomberg",

Oil is already almost back to $50 per barrel, so cuts of nearly 1 million barrels per day could boost prices well into the mid-$50s, even up towards $60 per barrel. That will provide a windfall to oil producers around the world and the sacrifice for OPEC members will be more than paid for by higher revenues. For example, Iraqi officials say that for every $1 increase in the price of a barrel of oil, their revenues jump by $1 billion per year. \nAs a result, the odds of rising crude oil prices are high. But while that could be welcomed by the industry, consumers might not be as excited to see cheap gasoline disappear. After all, U.S. motorists have enjoyed two years of incredibly cheap fuel. Will rising oil prices put a dent in already tepid U.S and global economic growth? \nPerhaps not. As Bloomberg reported , Goldman Sachs wrote in a Nov. 22 research note that the global economy could benefit from higher oil prices. That conclusion may not be obvious, but here is the logic the investment bank lays out: Higher oil prices lead to a wave of capital that flows into major oil producing countries such as Saudi Arabia. Unable to use all the capital, Saudi Arabia sends the excess savings back into the global financial system. Banks then use that capital to lend. Interest rates also fall as the financial markets are more liquid. The end result is lower interest rates, more financial liquidity, higher asset values and ultimately greater consumer confidence. In short, higher oil prices could boost economic growth. \nThese conclusions echo those from a team of IMF economists from earlier this year. In March, the IMF said that the assumed connection between oil prices and GDP (falling oil prices will boost GDP as consumers have more money in their pockets) is not as solid as previously thought. Many analysts, including those at the IMF, once assumed that although oil producing countries such as Saudi Arabia would be damaged from low oil prices, the benefits to consuming countries would more than offset those losses, delivering net benefits to the global economy.

Equity prices tended to move in tandem with oil prices; in the past we had grown accustomed to expect the reverse to be true (crude prices rise, stock markets fall). The positive correlation between financial markets and crude oil prices caught many by surprise. \nThe reason that this unexpected link occurred has to do with monetary policy. In the past, central banks including the U.S. Fed would respond to falling oil prices with a cut in interest rates, spurring economic growth. Now, with interest rates near zero, central banks have no firepower left. Falling oil prices is causing some deflationary pressure as a result (falling asset values), and the lack of an interest rate cut means that the real interest rate is actually higher, dampening growth. As a result, the IMF economists argue that the reverse will also be true: a rise in oil prices will push up asset prices, and if central banks hold off on interest rate increases, the effect could be positive for growth. \nWhile that explanation is convoluted and a little bit of a mouthful, Goldman Sachs’ interpretation is much simpler: An integrated financial system means that savings from oil producing countries finds its way back to consumer countries, where it can stimulate growth. The investment bank singles out the early 2000s, in which rising asset prices and global growth came even as oil prices (and prices across a range of commodities) rose substantially. “The difference between today and the 1970s is that oil creates global liquidity through a far more sophisticated financial system,” Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in their note to clients. “More sophisticated financial markets in the 2000s were able to transform this excess savings into greater global liquidity that increased asset values, lowered interest rates, and improved credit conditions that spanned the globe.” \nGoldman says that the surplus in savings outside the U.S. ballooned from $1 trillion to $7 trillion between 2001 and 2014, pushing up asset prices. Of course, that can also have a darker side – asset bubbles in commodities as well as housing also led to widespread financial ruin. \nAll in all, the research from Goldman Sachs suggests that, while it may not be obvious to individual consumers who see higher prices at the pump, there could be a boost to the global economy in the coming months if oil prices rise.",

      "text": "November 26, 2016 at 10:42 AM EST Goldman Sachs Gets Bullish on Basic Materials \nFrom Brad Hoppmann : When a top investment bank reverses course and makes a bullish call on a sector, it’s a good idea to pay close attention. \nThis week, Goldman Sachs (GS) upgraded its outlook on commodities and basic materials. Analysts say the segment is poised for a strong run next year — with prices for oil, coal, iron ore, nickel and zinc all likely to rise. \nThe upgrade on the basic materials sector to “Overweight” was the first time GS has made such a move in four years. \nAccording to the Goldman note, as quoted in TheStreet.com : \n“We believe the recent reacceleration in global PMIs (purchasing managers’ indexes) suggests commodity markets are entering a cyclically stronger environment … Supply restrictions from policy actions should benefit oil, coking coal and nickel in the near term while economic reductions should boost natural gas and zinc.” \nSo, what does an upgrade to “Overweight” mean in terms of actual expected percentage upside? \nGoldman analysts think that commodities as a sector , as tracked by the Goldman Sachs Commodity Index, could jump 9% over the next three months . That forecast represents a huge turnaround from the previous forecast for a decline of 2%. \nThe question now is … why the change of heart? \nBig spending on big infrastructure will cause a big boost in demand for basic materials. And prices are adjusting to that potential outcome accordingly.The most-obvious answer here is that commodity prices — particularly industrial commodities and basic materials — are charging higher. This is happening in anticipation of a Trump administration and a compliant Republican Congress ready to act on the promise of a $1 trillion infrastructure spending spree. \nYet here, Goldman cautions investors not to jump to this conclusion. \nPer the TheStreet.com article: \n“It is tempting to blame the sharp post-election rally in industrial metals prices on President-elect Trump’s platform of lower taxation and higher public spending on infrastructure … We would argue this rally was a continuation of a reflation trend put in place at the start of 2016 by the Chinese through credit stimulus aimed at infrastructure projects and policy-driven supply curtailments in coal.” \nThe overall reflation trend certainly has had a hand in pushing coal and iron ore prices higher this year. But I think Goldman is understating the “Trump effect” when it comes to the latest boost in the segment. *** \nAll we need do is look at a recent price chart of the benchmark basic materials fund, the iShares U.S. Basic Materials ETF ( NYSE:IYM ) , to see the reversal of fortune that took place on Nov. 9. \nAs you can see, the price of basic materials had been trending lower in the two months preceding Election Day. \nThen, not coincidentally, the sector soared on Nov. 9. That’s when traders began pricing in the pro-growth policies, as well as the infrastructure buildout, that’s at the heart of the president-elect’s economic proposals. \nNow, while it may be tempting to jump into a sector like basic materials on the promise of a Trump “reflation trade,” I think it is a bit premature right now. \nThere are still numerous unknowns regarding what a Trump administration will do, and what kind of infrastructure buildout will occur … and at what pace. \nStill, it is safe to say that the Goldman call is a step in the right direction. It recognizes a reversal of fortune for the industrial commodities and basic materials sector … a reversal that, if sustainable, will be a leading indicator signaling future economic growth. \nThis article is brought to you courtesy of Uncommon Wisdom Daily .

      "text": "  2 reasons why USD correlation with oil is 'overstated' - Goldman Sachs Mon 28 Nov 2016 00:52:47 GMT Author: share Goldman Sachs on the oil-USD correlation \nHistorically, the dollar has been negatively correlated with oil prices, meaning low oil prices have coincided with a strong dollar, while high oil prices have typically come when the Dollar has been weak. \nWe argue that the importance of this empirical relationship is overstated for two reasons. \nFirst, many of the counterpart currencies in broad dollar indices belong to commodity exporting countries, so that falling (rising) oil prices push down (up) their terms of trade, which weakens (strengthens) their currencies. The negative correlation thus exists almost by construction, i.e. is a bit like looking at the correlation of oil prices with their reciprocal (commodity exporters' terms of trade). In short, the correlation isn't really about the Dollar per se , but about commodity exporters. \nSecond, fluctuations in oil prices often coincide with other developments that have effects on the dollar, including global demand shocks or monetary policy changes. Both of these are present in Exhibit 1, which shows the drop in oil prices during the global financial crisis, which - being a negative demand shock originating in the US - moved rate differentials against the Dollar, and the pronounced drop in oil prices in 2014, which coincided with the BoJ and ECB increasing monetary stimulus, moving rate differentials in favor of the Dollar. This is perhaps one reason why the correlation of the Dollar with oil prices is less pronounced in changes than in levels \nWe examine the correlation of the Dollar with oil prices using daily data, controlling for interest differentials, risk appetite and other factors. It concludes that rate differentials are the most important driver behind recent Dollar moves, followed by oil prices. \nWe conclude that it is primarily the forces of economic divergence that are driving recent Dollar direction, in line with our forecasts which anticipate more Dollar appreciation (around 7 percent) on these grounds.

      "title": "Goldman Sachs Is Suddenly Bullish On Oil Again",
      "text": "November 28, 2016 at 06:30 AM EST Goldman Sachs Is Suddenly Bullish On Oil Again \nFrom OilPrice.com : Goldman Sachs is known to make outlandish calls on crude oil. First came a forecast of $200 a barrel back in March 2008, which fell flat on its face within months. The second was a call of $20 a barrel made in September 2015: To be fair, though crude did not actually make it to this catastrophic low, it did come down to $27 a barrel. It was close. \nNow, in a recent report, analysts including Damien Courvalin at Goldman have turned “tactically bullish,” forecasting $55 a barrel for the first half of 2017, up from their earlier forecast of a range-bound market between $45 and $50 a barrel for that period. \nHowever, they have not upgraded their annual average of $52.5 a barrel for next year. While the first half’s forecast for 2017 has been upgraded, the forecast for the second half of next year has been downgraded from $55-$60 a barrel to $50 a barrel, as the bank expects OPEC to resume production and U.S. shale oil supply to increase. \n(Click to enlarge) \nEven without the OPEC production cut, Goldman sees the second half of next year tip over to a deficit . Hence, the bank believes that a production cut by OPEC will not hurt them for more than six months, as they can return to their normal production by the second half of next year. \n“With greater confidence that the global oil market can finally shift into deficit later next year, we now believe that there is a strong rationale for low-cost producers to deliver a swift production cut to normalize inventories,” the analysts said, as cited by Bloomberg . \nLet’s examine the possibility of a deal on November 30 and the likely effect on oil prices. \nThe future of oil prices, at least in the short-term, hinges on the OPEC meeting in Algiers. \nThe initial signs point to an all-out effort by OPEC to secure a deal. Initially, though, both Iran and Iraq had objections to the 4-4.5 percent across-the-board production cut proposed by Algeria for all members, barring Libya and Nigeria. Nevertheless, the cartel has been able to convince Iraq to go ahead with a cut of some magnitude—potentially the 4 to 4.5 percent cut. \n“At the end of the day, we are probably going to get about a million barrels a day of cuts from OPEC and that’s going to drive the market into deficit,” Bart Melek, the head of commodity strategy at TD Securities in Toronto. ”We are seeing communications from Iraq that they would be happy to participate,” reports The Business Times. \nThat only leaves Iran, which is still not on board with the formula. \nOn the production front, Iran has reached 4 million barrels a day. Previously, Iran had said it would come to the table for talks only after reaching its pre-sanction level of production. \nHowever, the new President-elect in the U.S. had promised to “tear up” the nuclear agreement with Iran during his campaign. And while the Iranians are not acknowledging the threat to the deal, the uncertainty is palpable. \n“There’s just no way the Iranians are going to agree to this,” Again Capital’s John Kilduff told CNBC . “I think they see a horizon, potentially, where their oil production and exports get disrupted again by the new Trump administration … so why would they agree to any sort of cut at all right now?” \nAmong the non-OPEC nations, Russia has agreed to freeze production, but is not willing to cut production. Russia is attempting to convince OPEC that even a freeze by Russia is equivalent to a production cut, because Russia had planned to increase production in 2017. \n“While there’s actually nothing new from Russia today, Moscow is changing its rhetoric to show its commitment to a deal,” said Alexander Kornilov, an analyst at Aton LLC in Moscow. “The new wording shows Russia is trying to convince OPEC partners,” reports Bloomberg . \nOPEC will announce a deal (or no deal) at the end of the meeting on November 30, which should give a small pop to oil prices if favorable. The markets, however, will be keen to look at the numbers in the subsequent months to analyze whether the OPEC members and Russia adhere to their production quotas or whether there is blatant cheating. \nThough a pop above $52 a barrel in WTI is not inconceivable, sustenance and a huge rally is unlikely, regardless of a cut. \nThe United States Oil Fund LP ETF ( NYSE:USO ) fell $0.10 (-0.97%) to $10.23 per share in premarket trading Monday. Year-to-date, the largest fund tied to crude oil futures has fallen 6.09%. \nThis article is brought to you courtesy of OilPrice.com .

      "text": "By Sandeep Kanihama \nResearch Team at Goldman Sachs, believes that Mr. Trump will pursue a pro-growth agenda, supporting a pickup in growth that was already underway and as a result GS is downgrading their near term 3 and 6-mo gold price forecasts to $1,200/oz, from $1,280/oz (vs. spot $1,208/oz) (N.B. GS 2017 forecast is now $1213/oz from $1261/oz previously). \nKey Quotes \n“While gold has already sold off sharply and real rates have risen substantially to reﬂect this thinking, we see the very near-term price risks as skewed to the downside, owing primarily to our concerns about the potential for physical ETF liquidation. Speciﬁcally, we estimate that the vast bulk of this year’s ETF build is losing money at current prices and that if half of this was unwound this would result in a c.$60/oz sell-off in the gold price.” \n“Having said this, our base case medium to longer-term outlook towards gold is relatively agnostic since the outlook depends greatly on how the Fed responds to potential US stimulus and inﬂation as the economy reaches full employment. Were the Fed to be relatively dovish, this would see real rates remain low and be bullish for gold, while the opposite would be true if the Fed raised rates more quickly.” \n“Speciﬁcally, our economists expect US real rates to be broadly ﬂat from current levels over the next 12 months. At the same time, a number of other factors are likely to be supportive for gold, at the margin, over the medium to long term. Valuation levels for alternative asset classes such as equities and bonds remain highly elevated by historical standards, mine supply growth is likely to be weak over the next 12-24 months, and China’s RMB is set to depreciate further, to 7.3 by yearend 2017 on our FX team’s forecast, potentially supporting gold ETF purchases (especially in the context of a slowing growth in Chinese property prices). Overall, these considerations result in us leaving our 12-mo and 2018 price forecasts of $1,250/oz unchanged.” RELATED TOPICS",

      "text": "by Paul Clarke 16 minutes ago \nGoldman Sachs continues to lose senior traders in the U.S. after a series of job cuts hitting its New York operation.  en/254896/254896/ \nThe churn in the senior ranks in Goldman Sachs’ markets division continues. So far this month, at least two long-serving managing directors have departed for Wall Street competitors. \nDerek Brown, a managing director in Goldman Sachs’ equities division, joined Citigroup as a managing director earlier this month. He was bumped up to MD in 2005 at Goldman, and had been working at the firm for over 19 years. \nMeanwhile, Thomas Harrop, a managing director in Goldman’s global liquidity products division in New York, has just joined Credit Suisse. Again, Harrop spent a long time at Goldman Sachs – he joined in March 2004, as a prop trader focused primarily on credit derivatives. He was promoted to managing director in 2012. \nHarrop spent nearly three years in Hong Kong where he was APAC co-treasurer and a managing director in its global liquidity products group. He returned to New York in July this year, but departed Goldman earlier this month. \nGoldman’s bi-annual promotion of partners earlier this month was always likely to see the departure of some managing directors who failed to make the cut. However, Goldman has also been making some deep cuts to its U.S. operation – 443 employees have been affected by numerous announcements throughout this year stating its intentions to cut staff in New York. Most of the job cuts earlier this year hit senior sales and trading staff within its fixed income currencies and commodities division. \nCitigroup, meanwhile, has been quietly shoring up its equities business since the departure of its equities head Derek Bandeen earlier this year. It brought in Armando Diaz from hedge fund Millennium Capital Management to run its cash equities business in the Americas, while Dirk Keijer and Quentin Andre also joined from Goldman Sachs in senior derivatives sales roles.",

The number of shares short is then compared to the average daily volume, in order to calculate the total number of trading days it would take to close out all of the open short positions if every share traded represented a short position being closed.",

ET Goldman Sachs: 3 Reasons to Buy ConocoPhillips Right Now By Ben Levisohn \nGoldman Sachs analyst Neil Mehta and team offer four reasons for upgrading ConocoPhillips ( COP ) to Buy from Neutral: Getty Images \nWe upgrade ConocoPhillips (COP) from Neutral to Buy and add it to the Conviction List with 20% total return to our 12-month EV/DACF-based price target of $54 (from $47). Three factors drive our upgrade: (1) ConocoPhillips offers the most attractive free cash flow yield among large cap US majors/E&Ps, as we expect capex to stay low and 2017-2020 oil prices to normalize to above $50/bbl WTI; (2) we see a solid capital allocation story , with ConocoPhillips growing the dividend, reducing its share count and paying down debt, partly through asset sale proceeds; and (3) ConocoPhillips offers compelling relative and absolute valuation, especially given share price underperformance in 2016 (lagging Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF ( XLE ) by 22% YTD). \nShares of ConocoPhillips have gained 2% to $46.66 at 10:24 a.m. today, while the Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF has dipped 0.1% to $72.63.",

      "text": "By Dimitra DeFotis Commodities analysts at Goldman Sachs raised their outlook for base metals prices on Monday with currencies as a tailwind, but lowered their gold projection and offered a mixed outlook for Australia-based metals producers as the commodities cycle peaks.\nThe upward revisions included prices for iron ore, hard coking coal, oil & base metals (Aluminum, Cu, Zinc, Pb & Nickel) on 3- 6- and 12-month basis. The Goldman analysts Craig Sainsbury, Meredith Schwarz and Ken Lek see strength in the Australian dollar and U.S. dollar. Select price outlook changes:\n” … *We upgrade our Iron Ore CFR China forecasts to US$65/63/65/ton on a 3/6/12-month basis (from US$36/36/36/ton previously) and raise our long term forecasts to US$40/t from US$35/ton.\n* Our new copper forecasts are US$5,000/4,800/4,800/t (from US$4,300/4,300/4,200/t)\n* We upgrade our 4Q16/1Q17/2Q17 WTI U.S. oil price forecasts to $48/55/55/bbl from $43/45/50/bbl previously. However, we also reduce our 3Q17/ 4Q17 forecasts to $50/50/bbl from $55/60/bbl previously.\n* We downgrade our 3/6 month gold price forecast to $1,200/oz as downside risks remain from potential physical ETF liquidation. However, our 12-month outlook is unchanged at $1250/oz …\n… Upward revisions in bulk metals have significantly impacted BHP, RIO, FMG and S32 which all have iron ore & coal mining operations. The most exposed is FMG, followed by RIO, BHP then S32…. We continue to keep Fortescue Metals Group (FMG.Australia and FSUGY ) and South32 (S32.Australia and SOUHY ) on discounts to BHP Billiton ( BHP ) & Rio Tinto ( RIO ) due to their lower margin businesses and less diverse asset portfolios. We believe BHP and RIO’s more diversified and higher margin business warrants a multiple premium given the lower risk that diversity brings. Also, given single commodity companies and those with lower margins have historically traded at around a 20% multiple discount to their diversified peers, we believe a 1x multiple discount is warranted for FMG and S32.”\nThe analysts have a buy rating on S32, neutral ratings on BHP and RIO, and a sell rating on Fortescue. The SPDR Gold Trust ( GLD ) was moving higher in pre-market trading.",

      "text": "Goldman Sachs is known to make outlandish calls on crude oil. First came a forecast of $200 a barrel back in March 2008, which fell flat on its face within months. The second was a call of $20 a barrel made in September 2015: To be fair, though crude did not actually make it to this catastrophic low, it did come down to $27 a barrel. It was close.\nNow, in a recent report, analysts including Damien Courvalin at Goldman have turned “tactically bullish,” forecasting $55 a barrel for the first half of 2017, up from their earlier forecast of a range-bound market between $45 and $50 a barrel for that period.\nHowever, they have not upgraded their annual average of $52.5 a barrel for next year. While the first half’s forecast for 2017 has been upgraded, the forecast for the second half of next year has been downgraded from $55-$60 a barrel to $50 a barrel, as the bank expects OPEC to resume production and U.S. shale oil supply to increase.\nOilprice.com Even without the OPEC production cut, Goldman sees the second half of next year tip over to a deficit . Hence, the bank believes that a production cut by OPEC will not hurt them for more than six months, as they can return to their normal production by the second half of next year.\n“With greater confidence that the global oil market can finally shift into deficit later next year, we now believe that there is a strong rationale for low-cost producers to deliver a swift production cut to normalize inventories,” the analysts said, as cited by Bloomberg .\nLet’s examine the possibility of a deal on November 30 and the likely effect on oil prices.\nThe future of oil prices, at least in the short-term, hinges on the OPEC meeting in Algiers.\nThe initial signs point to an all-out effort by OPEC to secure a deal. Initially, though, both Iran and Iraq had objections to the 4-4.5 percent across-the-board production cut proposed by Algeria for all members, barring Libya and Nigeria. Nevertheless, the cartel has been able to convince Iraq to go ahead with a cut of some magnitude—potentially the 4 to 4.5 percent cut. \n\"At the end of the day, we are probably going to get about a million barrels a day of cuts from OPEC and that's going to drive the market into deficit,\" Bart Melek, the head of commodity strategy at TD Securities in Toronto. ''We are seeing communications from Iraq that they would be happy to participate,\" reports The Business Times. \nThat only leaves Iran, which is still not on board with the formula.\nOn the production front, Iran has reached 4 million barrels a day. Previously, Iran had said it would come to the table for talks only after reaching its pre-sanction level of production.\nHowever, the new President-elect in the U.S. had promised to “tear up” the nuclear agreement with Iran during his campaign. And while the Iranians are not acknowledging the threat to the deal, the uncertainty is palpable.\n\"There's just no way the Iranians are going to agree to this,\" Again Capital's John Kilduff told CNBC . \"I think they see a horizon, potentially, where their oil production and exports get disrupted again by the new Trump administration … so why would they agree to any sort of cut at all right now?\" \nAmong the non-OPEC nations, Russia has agreed to freeze production, but is not willing to cut production. Russia is attempting to convince OPEC that even a freeze by Russia is equivalent to a production cut, because Russia had planned to increase production in 2017.\n“While there’s actually nothing new from Russia today, Moscow is changing its rhetoric to show its commitment to a deal,” said Alexander Kornilov, an analyst at Aton LLC in Moscow. “The new wording shows Russia is trying to convince OPEC partners,” reports Bloomberg .\nOPEC will announce a deal (or no deal) at the end of the meeting on November 30, which should give a small pop to oil prices if favorable. The markets, however, will be keen to look at the numbers in the subsequent months to analyze whether the OPEC members and Russia adhere to their production quotas or whether there is blatant cheating.\nThough a pop above $52 a barrel in WTI is not inconceivable, sustenance and a huge rally is unlikely, regardless of a cut.\nNOW WATCH: This hidden iPhone feature will boost your reception \n",

      "text": "Dividend Yields: Goldman Sachs vs. Morgan Stanley (GS, MS) By Richard Saintvilus | November 29, 2016 — 8:30 AM EST \nGoldman Sachs Group, Inc. ( GS ) and Morgan Stanley ( MS ) are investment banking firms that offer institutional client services, financial advisory services, and consulting services with respect to mergers and acquisitions , divestitures , and corporate defense activities, among other businesses. But which of the two banks offers the more appealing dividend yield ? \nShares of Goldman Sachs will begin trading ex-dividend on Tuesday, Nov. 29. To qualify for a dividend check, investors must have owned Goldman Sachs prior to Tuesday, which is the day the company's management will finalize its roster of shareholders to whom it will mail payments. (See also: Goldman Sachs: How to Trade First Year of Trump .) \nGoldman Sachs stock closed Monday at $210.35, down 0.49%. The shares have risen 16.7% year to date, including gains of 27% in the past three months. This compares with a 7.72% year-to-date rise in the S&P 500 index ( SPX ). Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley shares closed Monday at $40.44, down 1.61%. The shares have risen 27% this year, while gaining 30% in the past three months. \nBased on Monday's closing price, Goldman Sachs' 65-cent per share quarterly dividend yields 1.23% annually, or about 77 basis points below the 2.00% average yield of the S&P 500 index. Goldman Sachs will send its dividend payment on Dec. 29 to shareholders of record as of Dec. 1. The company has raised its dividend by 85.7% since it paid a 35-cent per share dividend in 2010. Goldman Sachs stock has a consensus Hold rating and an average analyst 12-month price target of $194.50, implying a potential decline of about 7.5% from current levels. \nIn comparison, Morgan Stanley's 20-cent per share dividend yields 1.95% annually, which is 5 basis points below the S&P 500 index average. Morgan Stanley has raised its dividend by 300% since paying a 2-cent dividend in 2010. The stock has a consensus Hold rating and an average analyst 12-month price target of $36, implying a potential decline of about 11% from current levels. (See also: BMO Still Likes Capital One, Morgan Stanley .) \nThe verdict? While Morgan Stanley's annual dividend yield of 1.95% is five basis points below the S&P 500, it is still 72 basis points higher than that of Goldman Sachs. Plus, Morgan Stanley's aggressive dividend increases (300% vs. 85.7% for Goldman Sachs) suggest that it is the yield to bet on in the long term.

      "text": "By Teresa Rivas Both Bank of America ( BAC ) and Goldman Sachs ( GS ) are trading higher today, after Keefe, Bruyette, and Woods upgraded both stocks.\nBloomberg News Analysts Brian Kleinhanzl and Michael Brown boosted their rating on both stocks to Outperform Tuesday, as a result of their new 2017 models, which take into account the election results. Next year, they expect to see higher interest rates, a modest boost to banks from deregulation and improved trading results thanks to increased volatility.\nHere are their specific thoughts on Bank of America and Goldman Sachs:\nGiven our expectations for an improved operating environment and an improved regulatory and macroeconomic backdrop, we are raising BAC and GS to Outperform from Market Perform. BAC still has room to move despite having the best performance post election, in our view. We expect BAC to have the best earnings growth trajectory versus peers and we believe the valuation is still reasonable given the operating leverage from expense saves and higher rates. For GS, we believe we are moving to a better trading environment for FICC trading and GS should benefit more than peers given the company’s reliance on trading results and the greater contribution from FICC revenues toward total revenues. In general, we are more confident in rising rates and better trading versus wide-sweeping regulatory changes and we believe BAC and GS offer the best exposure to both at still reasonable valuations. \nAs for the group overall, they expect higher estimates, fed funds rate increase and regulatory policy proposals will keep bank stocks climbing, although the pace of their outperformance will probably slow from the post-election rally. They also have Outperform ratings on JPMorgan ( JPM ) and Bank of New York Mellon ( BK ).",

      "title": "Goldman Sachs: Stocks Will Plunge If Bonds Sell Off Much More",
      "text": "  07:53 AM EST Goldman Sachs: Stocks Will Plunge If Bonds Sell Off Much More \nFrom Tyler Durden : Ever since “Trumpflation” emerged as a driver of risk-assets, a tension has emerged in capital markets: how much higher can rates rise (and by implication the US Dollar) before financial conditions become so tight that the equity rally reverses under the weight of the very reflation it is pricing in. \nTen days ago, SocGen became the first to attempt an answer , by providing the following table, according to which the answer was roughly 2.6% on the 10Y Treasury: a level at which equities become rich relative to bond yields. \nOf course, on a simple yield comparison basis, if looking at the 10Y yield, which today is just over 2.31%, relative to overall dividend yield of the S&P500, stocks are already overvalued… \n… however that is a rather simplistic take. A full analysis would take additional variables into consideration, chief among which is the so-called growth/yield trade off. \nConveniently, an answer to that question, and more broadly, to the question of how far can equities rise alongside higher bond yields, was provided earlier today courtesy of Goldman Sachs. \nNot surprisingly, Goldman’s strategist Peter Oppenheimer writes that “this is a question we are asked a lot” and adds that “the inflection point this summer, where deflationary risks have faded and reflationary hopes have been rekindled, has caused the relationship between bonds and equities to change. In effect, the collapse of the ‘deflation’ risk premium has pushed up bond yields and has supported some equities, especially financials. But in reality this shift in the risk premium (and slightly improved earnings outlook) has not been sufficient to offset the speed and change in bond yields. The net effect has been a flat market but with a small de-rating in the valuation.” \nThis is shown in the exhibit below which shows that the market P/E has moved down by a full PE point since bond yields have increased from July. \n12-month forward IBES consensus P/E for SXXP \n\nGoldman then provides a broader answer to the bigger question of the “The Growth/Yield trade off” as follows: \nThe answer to the question about the level of bond yields that could dampen equities is not a concrete one; answering it is more an art than a science. There are several factors to consider: \n1) The relative movements between bond yields and expected growth \nOne way to think about the range of possible outcomes is to attempt to put some possible numbers behind the ‘trade-off’ between the discount rate and long-term nominal growth expectations. We do this by using our standard DDM in the exhibit below. Here we fix the equity risk premium (ERP) and vary growth and bond yields. As a rough rule of thumb a 50bp rise in bond yields would knock around 10% off equity values without any change in the long run expected growth rate. \nSXXP sensitivity to risk-free rate and growth assumptions, with a fixed ERP \n2) The level of bond yields \nWhile the correlation between changes in bond prices and equity prices is a positive one under most ‘normal’ environments, as bond yields fall to very low levels (around 3% or so) the correlation flips. That is why falling bond yields post the financial crisis have often been combined with weaker equities as they both reflect deflation risks. By association, the reverse should be true, and the rise in bond yields from trough levels has been accompanied by a rally in risky assets since the July lows this year, although in Europe equities have remained flat as they have de-rated alongside the rise in yields. However, a rise to anything over c.3% on US treasuries (see Exhibit 12) could be a significant negative, particularly given high current valuations. In fact, the speed of adjustment is also important; note from Exhibit 12 that the sharp rise in bond yields during the so-called taper tantrum in 2013 was negative for equities as well as bonds. As Exhibit 11 shows, the same relationships exist in Europe. \nAnother way to show this is in Exhibits 13 and 14, described in GOAL, Reflation, equity/bond correlation and diversification desperation, November 14, 2016. This shows that the correlation between German 10-year bond returns and equities is negative when there is a low level of GDP growth and low levels of inflation. The ‘tipping point’ in the correlations is typically around real GDP of c.1.5%-2.0% and CPI inflation of around 2.0%-2.5%. \n3) The valuations of bonds \nIn addition to levels, and the rate of change of bond yields and inflation expectations, the valuations of assets are also important in determining the impact of rising bond yields on equity prices. This is a crucial point. In recent years, given fears of deflation and the impact of QE, the valuation of bond markets has increased to levels well beyond those we believe are justified by fundamentals. It is as if bonds have benefited from the deflation risk premium (while of course equities have correspondingly been held back by this risk premium). We can get a sense of excess valuation by using our bond strategy team’s so-called ‘Sudoku’ fair value model. Exhibit 15 shows that when this model shows overvaluation, the correlation with equity prices is negative: rising bond yields are good for equities. The reverse is true when the bond market is at fair value or is expensive. This is further illustrated in Exhibit 16 which shows a scatter plot of the valuation mismatch of bonds (in standard deviations from fair value) and the correlation of equities and bonds. The overvaluation of bond yields has meant that rising yields (and a diminishing deflation risk premium) has been good for equities. \nBut we have already moved away from the point at which rising bond yields were definitively good. Back in July, when concerns about the ramifications of Brexit on global growth and inflation had pushed yields down to extreme low levels, and consequently had pushed down equity markets, any rise in inflation expectations or growth helped to push up yields and see equities rise from the lows together. In July, the correlation between European equities and US bonds was about -80%, but even now this correlation has already moved to -40%. \n* * * \nAll of which brings us to the one thing that really matters: the number, or rather Goldman’s estimation, above which the 10Y yield would lead to selling in stocks, all else being equal. That number, according to Goldman is… Taking all of these approaches together we believe that the equity market is still at a level that can cope with moderately rising bond yields. We estimate that a rise in US bond yields above 2.75% or probably between 0.75-1% in Germany would create a more serious problem for equity markets: at that point we would expect the correlation between bonds and equities to be more positive – i.e., any further rises in yields from there would be a negative for stock returns. \nTaking a midpoint of Socgen’s and Goldman’s estimates, it means that the 10Y can rise another ~35 bps before it starts acting as a break to further gains in the S&P500 on expectations of the Trump “reflation” trade. \nThe SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust ( NYSE:SPY ) rose $0.37 (+0.17%) to $220.85 per share in premarket trading Tuesday. Year-to-date, the largest fund tied to the S&P 500 index has gained 8.15%. \nThis article is brought to you courtesy of ZeroHedge .   Related Stocks:",

The data issued Tuesday by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. showed strength in the banking industry more than eight years after the financial crisis struck. However, the impact of low oil prices on energy companies led banks to continue to post bigger losses on commercial and industrial loans. Some energy companies have struggled to repay loans, causing distress for banks in oil and gas producing regions. The FDIC reported that U.S. banks earned $45.6 billion in the third quarter, up from $40.4 billion a year earlier. Almost 61 percent of banks reported an increase in profit from a year earlier. Only 4.6 percent of banks were unprofitable, down from 5.2 percent in the third quarter of 2015 and the lowest percentage since the third quarter of 1997. The FDIC said net interest income increased by $10 billion, or 9.2 percent, from a year earlier. As a sign of a healthy banking industry, the interest income earnings were boosted by a $112 billion, or 1.2 percent, increase in lending in the third quarter. The largest increases came in mortgage lending and credit cards. Most Popular",

      "text": "Topics: Donald Trump , Finance , Goldman Sachs , Penny stocks , Steve Bannon , Wall Street , Business News , Politics News Steve Bannon, campaign CEO for President-elect Donald Trump, leaves Trump Tower, Friday, Nov. 11, 2016, in New York. (Credit: AP) \nSteve Bannon has worn many hats: Breitbart News chairman, Donald Trump’s chief campaign strategist, “Seinfeld” royalties collector . Such a renaissance man is bound to eventually run into contradiction. \nFor instance, in the 1980s, Bannon — populist and “ economic nationalist ” — worked as an investment banker at Goldman Sachs, and later tried his hand at the penny stock market. \nFrom Politico : \nThese penny-stock firms employed some of the complex corporate maneuvers favored by financial masters of the universe — trans-national acquisitions, reverse mergers and asset purchase agreements — though on a much smaller scale. Most of the companies failed to take off, often in the throes of legal troubles, in the years before Bannon emerged as a populist critic of financial wizardry run amok and failures to prosecute Wall Street executives. \nIn the early 2000s, Bannon and business partner Andy Badolato consulted, advised, and served as board members of several small businesses ahead of their IPOs. \nOne such company was SinoFresh. Bannon and co. started advising the homeopathic nasal spray producer in 2003, ahead of its IPO. According to Politico, the “partnership . . . soon soured” after “the company’s founder, Charles Fust, uncovered an alleged scheme by Badolato to rob him of a million shares of stock by putting it under the control of a corporation registered in Belize and controlled by a Costa Rica-based businessman named Jonathan Curshen.” \nAfter Fust tried to remove Bannon from SinoFresh’s board of directors, Bannon responded with a baseless lawsuit claiming Fust had used company money to buy an engagement ring. Bannon was eventually reinstated to the board and the lawsuit was thrown out. \nA Florida court awarded Fust the disputed shares, but SinoFresh “was roiled by the dispute and performed poorly. Eventually its stock stopped trading altogether in 2011,” according to Politico. Brendan Gauthier is assistant editor at Salon.",

      "text": "By Ben Levisohn Goldman Sachs ( GS ) got upgraded by KBW today, but downgraded by Instinet , with the disagreement centering on whether the investment bank’s nearly 30% rise during the past three months means it’s come too far, too fast.\nGetty Images Instinet’s Steven Chubak and team explain why they cut Goldman Sachs to Neutral from Buy:\nFollowing the recent rally, we see risk / reward as more balanced for Goldman Sachs, given an already low tax rate / heavier international gearing; lower asset sensitivity; higher risk of multiple rebasing (akin to 2004-06 rate cycle); and weaker excess capital / buyback capacity.\nKBW’s Brian Kleinhanzl and Michael Brown explain why they upgraded Goldman Sachs to Outperform from Market Perform:\nWe are expecting an improved trading outlook on higher volatility and we believe investors would be best positioned for higher volatility and trading volumes by owning shares of Goldman Sachs. We increased our earnings estimates 11.8% and 13.9% in 2017 and 2018, respectively. Our $240 price target and dividend assumptions imply 15.4% total return over the next twelve months. Our updated price target represents 10.7x our 2018 EPS estimate and this is below the peer average of 11.1x estimates. We believe there could be additional upside in shares of GS should global economic growth improve at a faster pace or deregulation occur on a wider scale (such as a Volcker rollback).\nWho’s right? Well, the market is siding with KBW. Shares of Goldman Sachs have gained 1.1% to $212.10 at 11:39 a.m., while the Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF ( XLF ) has risen 0.4% to $22.25. Barron’s Steven Sears recommended Goldman Sachs in August when it was trading at $173.",

We increased our earnings estimates 11.8% and 13.9% in 2017 and 2018, respectively. Our $240 price target and dividend assumptions imply 15.4% total return over the next twelve months. Our updated price target represents 10.7x our 2018 EPS estimate and this is below the peer average of 11.1x estimates. We believe there could be additional upside in shares of GS should global economic growth improve at a faster pace or deregulation occur on a wider scale (such as a Volcker rollback).\nWho’s right? Well, the market is siding with KBW. Shares of Goldman Sachs have gained 1.1% to $212.10 at 11:39 a.m., while the Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF ( XLF ) has risen 0.4% to $22.25. Barron’s Steven Sears recommended Goldman Sachs in August when it was trading at $173.",

      "text": "By Teresa Rivas Both Bank of America ( BAC ) and Goldman Sachs ( GS ) are trading higher today, after Keefe, Bruyette, and Woods upgraded both stocks.\nBloomberg News Analysts Brian Kleinhanzl and Michael Brown boosted their rating on both stocks to Outperform Tuesday, as a result of their new 2017 models, which take into account the election results. Next year, they expect to see higher interest rates, a modest boost to banks from deregulation and improved trading results thanks to increased volatility.\nHere are their specific thoughts on Bank of America and Goldman Sachs:\nGiven our expectations for an improved operating environment and an improved regulatory and macroeconomic backdrop, we are raising BAC and GS to Outperform from Market Perform. BAC still has room to move despite having the best performance post election, in our view. We expect BAC to have the best earnings growth trajectory versus peers and we believe the valuation is still reasonable given the operating leverage from expense saves and higher rates. For GS, we believe we are moving to a better trading environment for FICC trading and GS should benefit more than peers given the company’s reliance on trading results and the greater contribution from FICC revenues toward total revenues. In general, we are more confident in rising rates and better trading versus wide-sweeping regulatory changes and we believe BAC and GS offer the best exposure to both at still reasonable valuations.\nAs for the group overall, they expect higher estimates, fed funds rate increase and regulatory policy proposals will keep bank stocks climbing, although the pace of their outperformance will probably slow from the post-election rally. They also have Outperform ratings on JPMorgan ( JPM ) and Bank of New York Mellon ( BK ).",

Coalition puts Goldman second globally for rates trading, behind J.P. Morgan. Credit Agricole, however, is unranked in the rates business. So, why did a mid-ranking Goldman rates trader just quit for Credit Agricole’s CIB? \nMohit Gupta left Goldman in October according to his public profile. He turned up at Credit Agricole this month. Headhunters say he quit Goldman voluntarily after six years at the bank. \nGupta’s didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. He joins Credit Agricole as an executive director in European swaps trading – exactly same title he had at Goldman. His motivation for quitting Goldman might have something to do with the fact that he’s being tasked with “building and developing” Credit Agricole’s European rates franchise, whereas at Goldman he just was just an “important member of the team.” \nAlthough Goldman Sachs is at number two globally for rates trading, it ranked outside the top six in Europe in 2015 according to Greenwich Associates. The European market leaders are instead Barclays, Citi and Deutsche Bank. Credit Agricole doesn’t rank in Europe either…",

      "text": "Donald Trump may be thinking of adding a key member of the great vampire squid to his presidential cabinet.\nGoldman Sachs gs president and chief operating officer Gary Cohn, who is only second to CEO Lloyd Blankfein, is set to meet with the president-elect in New York on Tuesday. Cohn is the latest business leader to make a trip to Trump Tower following the elections to either offer advice or discuss a potential seat in Trump’s cabinet, Sean Spicer said on a conference call with reporters Tuesday. It is unclear if 56-year-old Cohn is in the running for a cabinet position or if he is there to advise.\nThe high-profile Wall Street executive has been with Goldman Sachs for roughly 26 years, and has also been rumored to be Blankfein’s successor should he step down. Cohn started at Goldman in the 1990s, working in the commodities trading unit. He gained oversight in Goldman’s mortgage unit in 2000, and pushed the desk to increase risk-taking in the years leading up to the financial crisis, according to Bloomberg .\nAlthough the president-elect heavily criticized Wall Street on the campaign trail , he has considered picking a handful of financial industry leaders to be in his cabinet. Trump’s campaign finance chairman and the top contender for treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin , is a Goldman Sachs alumus, as is chief strategist Steve Bannon . Trump first considered J.P. Morgan Chase’s jpm Jamie Dimon for treasury secretary before Dimon turned him down .\n \nInvestors are expecting Trump’s presidency to be friendly to Wall Street . The Keefe Bruyette and Woods Nasdaq Bank Index has risen 14.3% since election day earlier this month, as investors piled into the financial industry. Trump has voiced plans to deregulate Wall Street, such as pulling back on the Dodd-Frank act, while his promise to build more infrastructures is expected to result in further interest rate hikes. Both moves should help the banks boost their revenue and bottom line.",

      "text": "(Reuters) - Goldman Sachs said in a research note dated Monday it expected oil prices to rise to the low $50s per barrel in the event of producer cartel OPEC reaching an agreement to cut production at a meeting in Vienna scheduled for Nov. 30.\nMarkets were on edge ahead of the meeting of Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) on Tuesday as there remained disagreement among members over which producers should cut and by how much. At 0632 GMT, Brent was trading at 47.80 per barrel.\nAt an assumed cut to 32.5 million barrels per day, Goldman Sachs told clients in the note the Brent market was pricing in a 30 percent probability of a deal being reached, with a $6 per barrel move the implied volatility on Wednesday.\nIn the absence of a deal, the bank warned, rising inventories through the first half of next year would mean prices averaging $45 per barrel through next summer.\n(Reporting by Apeksha Nair in BENGALURU; Editing by Kenneth Maxwell)",

      "title": "Goldman Sachs President Gary Cohn Gettin' a Little Face Time with Donald Trump Today | Vanity Fair",
      "text": "Goldman Sachs President Gary Cohn Gettin' a Little Face Time with Donald Trump Today Will Gary trade Lloyd for Donald? by Twitter From Bloomberg/Getty Images. Add Gary Cohn to the long list of people shuffling to and from midtown for a sit-down with our next president: according to Bloomberg , the Goldman Sachs president is scheduled to have a little chat with Donald Trump today, during a meeting that V.P.-elect Mike Pence will also sit in on. It’s unclear what’s on the agenda, but it’s not totally unreasonable to think that Trump, still reeling from JPMorgan C.E.O. Jamie Dimon’s reported rejection , is throwing yet another name into the mix for Treasury secretary . Or Trump could simply be picking Cohn’s brain about the markets, which the latter knows a thing or two about. In addition to getting a chance to see the end product of telling an interior designer ”just vomit gold on everything,” there is another big reason the meeting and potential job offer might be intriguing to Cohn. And that’s the fact that he’s been living in his own ”Marcia, Marcia, Marcia” hell for the past number of years ( his boss Lloyd Blankfein playing the part of Marcia, Gary being Jan ) and may like the idea of having an exit plan. Cohn and Blankfein have been bosom buddies since 1990, when Cohn was hired as a metals trader at Goldman and became ” Blankfein’s corporate problem solver ” and in the 20-plus years since have taken family vacations together, hung out on weekends, and have gotten so tight that friendship bracelets wouldn’t be out of the question. The bond was only made stronger by weathering the financial crisis together, as a unit, like twins, in an Arnold Schwarzenegger / Danny DeVito way . Still, you don’t get to be president of Goldman Sachs without being a somewhat ambitious person, and when you're the No. 2 at an organization, and the only thing standing between you and the No. 1 spot is your best friend who has no plans to retire, things can get awkward! As far back as 2012, sources were saying Cohn believed it was ”his time [to lead]” and last year someone told The Wall Street Journal that shareholders didn’t have to worry about Blankfein’s cancer diagnosis, because Cohn had come a long way from being a tactless oaf and now had the polish to be the C.E.O. of a major bank . But goddamn that Blankfein! He still hasn’t left, and with no signs of packing up his knick-knacks and getting out of there, Trump’s call may have come at the perfect time. According to a financial-services executive who spoke to the Hive, ”If the rumors are true, and they’re going to skip a generation and look to people like Harvey Schwartz when [the time comes to pick a Blankfein successor], this could be a way for [Gary] to make a graceful exit. It’s either this or retire in a few years and sit on a couple of boards.” Or taking the meeting could simply be a good way of making Lloyd jealous, giving him a little taste of what life would be like without ole Gar and his grundle around.

      "text": " 51 p.m. ET Share \nExpectations for faster growth have tightened money, but that’s not a bad thing Goldman Sachs Goldman Sachs produces a Financial Conditions Index of questionable utility. \nBy Caroline Baum Columnist \nEver since Donald Trump’s surprise election victory on Nov. 8, financial markets have been telegraphing a collective sense of optimism about future economic growth. The major U.S. stock indexes set new records, the dollar soared and the yield on Treasury securities rose across the curve. \nBefore you get too excited about the prospect for the economy to reach escape velocity after seven and one-half years of 2% growth, the financial press is warning that such optimism may contain the seeds of its own destruction. \n“Higher rates and a stronger dollar are making money tighter,” according to the Nov. 15 edition of the Wall Street Journal. \n“Financial conditions are tightening at an alarming pace,” warned a Nov. 15 headline on the popular ZeroHedge blog. Housing Prices Hit Record Levels, and More (18:58) \nHome prices set a record in September, reaching their highest level since 2006 and bringing to a close the worst stretch for the housing market since the Great Depression. Plus, what's the smartest way to donate on Giving Tuesday? Photo: Getty \nPfff! Just like that, those Masters of the Universe deal a blow to any anticipated stimulative effect from Trump’s proposed reduction in tax rates and regulations, and increased spending on infrastructure and defense. Both articles cite a sudden rise, or tightening, in the Goldman Sachs Financial Conditions Index, which has been at the forefront of the economics profession’s we-can-index-it craze. \nThe idea of a financial conditions index makes perfect sense on the surface. The central bank tightens or loosens monetary policy, which in turn affects an array of financial variables, which then act to transmit policy changes to the real economy. So far so good. \nThe problem lies with the interpretation: imputing a fixed meaning to a change in price. (Trigger warning: Get ready for a brief economics lesson.) \nThe price of any good, service or financial asset may vary because of a change in demand or a change in supply, with very different implications. Yet in the GSFCI, all changes are created equal. Lower long-term interest rates equate to easier financial conditions; higher long rates represent a tightening. \nConsider the case where long-term interest rates, a proxy for the price of credit, rise because the public decides to save less and spend more. Demand for credit pushes up the price of credit, which, as reflected in the GSFCI, constitutes tighter financial conditions and a harbinger of weaker demand in the future! If that were really the case, bond traders would be Masters of the Universe — and not only in a work of fiction. \nAlternatively, higher prices may be the result of a reduction in supply , in which case the effect would be negative. \nThis is one of the most basic, important and widely misunderstood concepts in economics. Only a handful of economists understand the application of microeconomic theory to the real world. One of them is Scott Sumner, director of the program on monetary policy at George Mason University’s Mercatus Center, who expresses what I’ve been talking about as a simple rule: “Never reason from a price change.” \n“Reflexively, I am not opposed to indexes: leading indicators, a yield spread — as long as they are properly constructed,” Sumner says. “Anything involving interest rates or exchange rates would be very problematic in terms of price change.” \nTherein lies the rub. An index or a rule removes discretion from decision-making. In some cases, such as the conduct of monetary policy, this may be a good thing. But when the components of an index require judgment to determine whether a change in the price will have a positive or negative effect, it defeats the purpose of an index. \nGoldman’s economics team has retooled its FCI over the years in an effort to improve its predictive powers. In its latest reincarnation, the weighting for the long-term Treasury yield has been increased to 45.1%, the biggest among the five GSFCI components. So it matters a great deal whether the Treasury yield enters the index with a positive or negative sign. (The other four components are the federal funds rate, the trade-weighted dollar, the S&P 500 Index and an investment-grade credit spread.) \nGoldman confirmed in a note to clients this week that the main drivers of the recent tightening in the GSFCI have been rising Treasury yields and a stronger dollar, both of which appear to signal expectations for stronger economic growth. Yet both moves constitute tighter financial conditions, as calculated by the GSFCI. \nAs to Goldman’s claim that the GSFCI has “substantial predictive power for growth,” the evidence doesn’t seem to support it. \nThe GSFCI set an all-time high (higher = tighter financial conditions) in June 1982, shortly before the end of a 16-month recession in November of that year. The economy was about to take off. Real growth a veraged 6.4% in the next two years, including four quarters of growth in excess of 8%. Predictive? Hardly. \nThe GSFCI shot up again in 1984, coming close to the previous high. Growth averaged 3.7% in the four quarters following that peak. \nThe GSFCI registered an all-time low in December 1999, coincident with the peak of the tech bubble. The index was still accommodative (below 100) when the economy fell into recession in March 2001. The yield curve had been inverted for almost a year, a sure sign that policy was tight. Yet in mid-2000, based on the GSFCI, Goldman economists expected the Federal Reserve to raise the funds rate by an additional 100 basis points from its 6.5% level at the time. \nInstead, the Fed started slashing its benchmark rate aggressively in January 2001, lowering it to 1.75% by year-end. \nOne more observation: The GSFCI set another cycle peak in October 2002, again just as the economy was set to take off. Economic growth in the ensuring four quarters averaged 4.4%. \nGoldman economists were unavailable to comment on the seeming contradiction between their claims about the index’s predictive powers and the data. At a neutral reading of 100.13 this week, the GSFCI is hardly emitting the kind of red alerts reflected in the financial press. \nThen again, the historical performance of the GSFCI taken in conjunction with the large weighting for Treasury yields and the flawed methodology of reasoning from a price change (see Sumner Rule above) tell me a yellow, cautionary warning is in order. Not because of the current tightening of financial conditions, but because the index suffers from some incurable flaws.  ",

      "text": "Get Unlimited Digital Access Your first month is less than a dollar. $0.99 for first 4 weeks Subscribe Now \nWASHINGTON - Dallas Rep. Jeb Hensarling's hopes of becoming the next U.S. Treasury Secretary appear to be dashed, as multiple news outlets reported Tuesday that President-elect Donald Trump will go in a different direction. \nTrump is expected to name to the post Steven Mnuchin, a 53-year-old financier who served as national finance chairman for the billionaire's campaign. The Goldman Sachs alum, who's since founded a hedge fund, has no experience in government. \nThe planned announcement, which was first reported by The New York Times , could come as soon as Wednesday. \nThe decision would cross off the list at least one opportunity for a Texan to take a prominent role in Trump's administration. Of the several Texans bandied about as possible Cabinet members, Hensarling was among the select group to receive an interview at Trump Tower . \n\"I stand ready to help the president in any capacity possible,\" the Dallas Republican said after the meeting this month. Rep. Jeb Hensarling, R-Dallas, was among the select group of Texans to get an interview this month at Trump Tower. (Sam Hodgson/The New York Times) \nEven if Hensarling isn't part of Trump's administration, he could still play a key role over the next four years as House Financial Services chairman. With Trump's support, Hensarling might finally succeed in his push to peel back banking regulations and cut taxes. \n\"Very excited to help drain the swamp, very excited to help get this economy working for working Americans again,\" he said this month, parroting Trump's call to shake up Washington. \nIn selecting Mnuchin, Trump risks alienating some of his blue-collar supporters by elevating yet another Wall Street insider to the treasury post. Trump often railed against Goldman Sachs and other investment bankers while on the stump. \nBut Mnuchin was an early Trump supporter who has said he agrees with the real estate mogul's priorities, the Times reported. And Mnuchin, who's financed movies like Avatar , hasn't been shy in explaining some of his ambition in rallying behind the bombastic billionaire. \n\"Nobody's going to be, like, 'Well, why did he do this?' if I end up in the administration,\" he told Bloomberg Businessweek in August . \nMore to come.",

      "text": "NEW YORK — President-elect Donald Trump has tapped Steven Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs banker who profited from the housing meltdown, as his Treasury secretary, according to an official briefed on the decision.\nMnuchin’s career has been full of contradictions. He started as a Wall Street insider working for old-line firms before running a series of eclectic businesses — including his own hedge fund and a West Coast consumer bank. In recent years, he has been a Hollywood movie producer.\nHe served as finance chairman of Trump’s presidential campaign and has been one of Trump’s closest economic advisers. His nomination will be announced as soon as Wednesday, the official said.\nAs Treasury secretary, the 53-year-old Mnuchin would be the face of the American economy around the world. The Treasury Department has expansive responsibility over business and oversees banking regulations, financial markets and the IRS. It has about 100,000 employees, an estimated 91,000 of them at the IRS.\nBesides co-signing the currency, the Treasury secretary is Uncle Sam’s banker, paying the bills, collecting taxes, managing the federal government debt and selling billions of dollars a year in Treasury bonds.",

      "title": "Trump Taps Ex-Goldman Banker Steven Mnuchin for Treasury Post",
      "text": "NEW YORK — President-elect Donald Trump has tapped Steven Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs banker who profited from the housing meltdown, as his Treasury secretary, according to an official briefed on the decision.\nMnuchin’s career has been full of contradictions. He started as a Wall Street insider working for old-line firms before running a series of eclectic businesses — including his own hedge fund and a West Coast consumer bank. In recent years, he has been a Hollywood movie producer.\nHe served as finance chairman of Trump’s presidential campaign and has been one of Trump’s closest economic advisers. His nomination will be announced as soon as Wednesday, the official said.\nAs Treasury secretary, the 53-year-old Mnuchin would be the face of the American economy around the world. The Treasury Department has expansive responsibility over business and oversees banking regulations, financial markets and the IRS. It has about 100,000 employees, an estimated 91,000 of them at the IRS.\nBesides co-signing the currency, the Treasury secretary is Uncle Sam’s banker, paying the bills, collecting taxes, managing the federal government debt and selling billions of dollars a year in Treasury bonds.\nMnuchin, like his father before him, was a partner at Goldman. He worked for the firm for 17 years, joining at age 22 and leaving just before his 40th birthday, in 2002.\nHe briefly joined the hedge fund of his former college roommate Eddie Lampert. Mnuchin still serves as a director of Sears Holdings, of which Lampert is chairman and CEO.\nAfter less than a year, he left Lampert to work as a portfolio manager for the hedge fund of George Soros, the billionaire financier who has bankrolled liberal candidates and causes — and who was depicted as a villain in Trump’s last campaign ad.\nHe only stayed a year, leaving in September 2004 to start his own hedge fund, Dune Capital Management.\nAs a producer, he has put out films including “American Sniper,” “The Lego Movie” and this summer’s “Suicide Squad.” His latest film, which opened right before Thanksgiving, is called “Rules Don’t Apply.”\nMnuchin joined the Trump campaign as finance chairman in May, and sources tell CNN he made it clear early that he wanted the Treasury job. He recruited deputies before he was tapped for the job.\nMnuchin has contributed to both Republican and Democratic candidates, including Hillary Clinton’s Senate campaigns and 2008 presidential run. He gave to Barack Obama’s Senate and presidential campaigns and to Charles Schumer, the new Democratic leader in the Senate.\nMnuchin and his brother were sued by the trustee trying to recover money for Bernard Madoff’s victims after his Ponzi scheme unraveled in 2008. They were executors of their mother’s estate, and had withdrawn her investment with Madoff shortly after she died in 2005.\nA court eventually blocked the trustee, Irving Picard, from collecting his mother’s $3.2 million in profits withdrawn from the Madoff fund that long before its collapse.\nMnuchin led the group that bought failed subprime lender IndyMac for pennies on the dollar in 2009, about a year after the FDIC took over the California bank following a run on deposits by customers.\nIndyMac had become a poster child for the risky home loans that brought on the housing crisis and the meltdown in financial markets. The FDIC agreed to assume much of the losses as part of its sale to Mnuchin, who renamed it OneWest.\nBut regulators soon questioned OneWest’s foreclosure practices, which included so-called robo-signings that pushed homeowners into foreclosure without proper review or due process.\nThe bank was one of many that agreed to pay millions in fines to compensate customers. Occupy Los Angeles protesters showed up at Mnuchin’s Bel Air mansion. And this month two fair housing groups in California filed a complaint with the Department of Housing and Urban Development, accusing the bank of discriminating against minority borrowers during his tenure there.\nMnuchin eventually sold OneWest to CIT Group in 2014 for $3.4 billion and joined CIT as part of the deal. When he left CIT less than two years later, he received a $10.9 million severance package.\n40.712784 -74.005941 ",

      "text": "President-elect Donald Trump has tapped Steven Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs banker who profited from the housing meltdown, as his Treasury secretary, according to an official briefed on the decision.\nMnuchin’s career has been full of contradictions. He started as a Wall Street insider working for old-line firms before running a series of eclectic businesses — including his own hedge fund and a West Coast consumer bank. In recent years, he has been a Hollywood movie producer.\nHe served as finance chairman of Trump’s presidential campaign and has been one of Trump’s closest economic advisers. His nomination will be announced as soon as Wednesday, the official said.\nAs Treasury secretary, the 53-year-old Mnuchin would be the face of the American economy around the world. The Treasury Department has expansive responsibility over business and oversees banking regulations, financial markets and the IRS. It has about 100,000 employees, an estimated 91,000 of them at the IRS.\nBesides co-signing the currency, the Treasury secretary is Uncle Sam’s banker, paying the bills, collecting taxes, managing the federal government debt and selling billions of dollars a year in Treasury bonds.\nMnuchin, like his father before him, was a partner at Goldman. He worked for the firm for 17 years, joining at age 22 and leaving just before his 40th birthday, in 2002.\nHe briefly joined the hedge fund of his former college roommate Eddie Lampert. Mnuchin still serves as a director of Sears Holdings, of which Lampert is chairman and CEO.\nAfter less than a year, he left Lampert to work as a portfolio manager for the hedge fund of George Soros, the billionaire financier who has bankrolled liberal candidates and causes — and who was depicted as a villain in Trump’s last campaign ad.\nHe only stayed a year, leaving in September 2004 to start his own hedge fund, Dune Capital Management.\nAs a producer, he has put out films including “American Sniper,” “The Lego Movie” and this summer’s “Suicide Squad.” His latest film, which opened right before Thanksgiving, is called “Rules Don’t Apply.”\nMnuchin joined the Trump campaign as finance chairman in May, and sources tell CNN he made it clear early that he wanted the Treasury job. He recruited deputies before he was tapped for the job.\nMnuchin has contributed to both Republican and Democratic candidates, including Hillary Clinton’s Senate campaigns and 2008 presidential run. He gave to Barack Obama’s Senate and presidential campaigns and to Charles Schumer, the new Democratic leader in the Senate.\nMnuchin and his brother were sued by the trustee trying to recover money for Bernard Madoff’s victims after his Ponzi scheme unraveled in 2008. They were executors of their mother’s estate, and had withdrawn her investment with Madoff shortly after she died in 2005.\nA court eventually blocked the trustee, Irving Picard, from collecting his mother’s $3.2 million in profits withdrawn from the Madoff fund that long before its collapse.\nMnuchin led the group that bought failed subprime lender IndyMac for pennies on the dollar in 2009, about a year after the FDIC took over the California bank following a run on deposits by customers.\nIndyMac had become a poster child for the risky home loans that brought on the housing crisis and the meltdown in financial markets. The FDIC agreed to assume much of the losses as part of its sale to Mnuchin, who renamed it OneWest.\nBut regulators soon questioned OneWest’s foreclosure practices, which included so-called robo-signings that pushed homeowners into foreclosure without proper review or due process.\nThe bank was one of many that agreed to pay millions in fines to compensate customers. Occupy Los Angeles protesters showed up at Mnuchin’s Bel Air mansion. And this month two fair housing groups in California filed a complaint with the Department of Housing and Urban Development, accusing the bank of discriminating against minority borrowers during his tenure there.\nMnuchin eventually sold OneWest to CIT Group in 2014 for $3.4 billion and joined CIT as part of the deal. When he left CIT less than two years later, he received a $10.9 million severance package.",

      "text": "Comments \nAmerican voters are rightfully frustrated with the constant gridlock in Washington, where our Republican-dominated Congress operates like an auction house for multinational corporations and special interest lobbyists, putting the needs of the ultrawealthy above those of regular Americans. Donald Trump promised his voters that he would “drain the swamp” and make government work for the American people again. How anyone took his promises seriously is difficult to understand, but millions of Americans apparently wanted major change and decided Trump was their best chance for it. \nNeedless to say, they couldn’t have been more wrong. First, Trump began by appointing a swath of lobbyists to his transition team . Now, he’s taking advice from banking oligarchs for his cabinet. \nThe Hill just reported that Donald Trump will be holding a closed-doors meeting with Goldman Sachs president and chief operating officer Gary Cohn to consult with him on cabinet appointees. The notorious multinational finance corporation Goldman Sachs was a major player in setting the stage for the Great Recession before crying to Washington for a bailout. They now have assets of 861 billion dollars and make $6.8 billion in profits a year – which they pay a paltry 18% tax on. \nNow that Goldman Sachs has the President-elect’s ear, they will persuade the easily manipulated egomaniac to hire Wall Street shills who will push for radical deregulation of the financial markets, allowing the big banks to resume playing casino capitalism with the savings of the American people and setting the stage for the next financial collapse. \nPresident Obama and Senator Elizabeth Warren’s (D-MA) Consumer Financial Protection Bureau will be the first to go, leaving the American people once more vulnerable to the predatory machinations of big banks like Wells Fargo, which just got busted conducting a massive scheme in which bank agents opened fake accounts for their customers and bilked millions out of everyday Americans . Trump’s economic plan is already projected to inflate our national debt by five trillion dollars ; if the oligarchs at Goldman Sachs get their way, we could be looking at another recession quicker than anyone could have predicted. \nTrump promised the American people that he would weed out corruption in Washington and “drain the swamp.” Instead, he appears to be burrowing himself squarely in the mire. On the campaign trail, he railed against Hillary Clinton and Ted Cruz for their connections to Goldman Sachs. “They have total, total control over him. Just like they have total control over Hillary Clinton” he complained at one of his rallies. \nIt looks like they will have total control over Donald Trump as well. \nIn case there were any lingering doubts, there’s nothing like a million-dollar a plate fundraiser to really get rid of corruption in Washington: Draining the swamp (in between candlelight dinners with $1M donors to the inaugural committee). pic.twitter.com/81eqscCGZa",

      "text": "Steven Mnuchin, a financier and alumnus of Goldman Sachs, will be named President-elect Trump's secretary of the treasury, multiple outlets reported Tuesday.\nThe selection of Mnuchin, Trump's campaign finance director, would place a former Wall Street banker and Hollywood insider at the top economic policy position in government.\nTrump's team was expected to announce its intention to nominated Mnuchin as early as Wednesday, the New York Times , the Wall Street Journal and other outlets reported Tuesday evening.\nThe 53-year-old investor earned the nod over several other reported candidates, including former BB&T Bank head John Allison, House Financial Services Committee chairman Jeb Hensarling, and — an outside rumored choice — JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon.\nStay abreast of the latest developments from nation's capital and beyond with curated News Alerts   news desk and delivered to your inbox.\nSorry, there was a problem processing your email signup. Please try again later. Processing... Thank you for signing up for Washington Examiner News Alerts. You should receive your first alert soon! Mnuchin would be the second treasury secretary within the past decade to have worked at Goldman Sachs, a background that is sure to cause friction when his nomination is sent to the Senate, where skepticism of Wall Street's influence over the government is running hot.\nCurrently the CEO of a hedge fund, Dune Capital, Mnuchin doesn't have experience in government. Before joining Trump's campaign, he had contributed to the campaigns of both Republicans and Democrats over the years, although he also backed Mitt Romney for president in 2012.\nAfter beginning his career at Goldman Sachs, earning a fortune over the course of 17 years, Mnuchin left in 2002 to found his hedge fund. In the meantime, he has become involved in Hollywood, producing major films such as \"American Sniper,\" \"Mad Max: Fury Road,\" and \"Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice.\"\n ",

      "text": "  5:03pm President-elect Donald Trump is planning to name investor and former Goldman Sachs executive Steven Mnuchin as Treasury Secretary, opting for an industry insider with no government experience to helm the agency in charge of the nation’s finances, according to people familiar with the matter.\nMnuchin (pronounced mah-NEW-chin) joined Trump’s whirlwind campaign in May as finance chairman, despite the fact that he has never worked in politics and that he donated to Democrats in the past. He quickly earned Trump’s trust as he worked closely with the Republican National Committee to raise substantial amounts of money in a short period of time. On the policy front, he was instrumental in crafting the details of Trump’s proposal to overhaul the tax code. \nMnuchin is the latest member of Trump’s top advisers to secure a high-level and influential post in the nascent administration, highlighting the importance the president-elect places on loyalty as he builds out his White House team. Last week, officials confirmed that industrialist billionaire Wilbur Ross would be nominated for Commerce secretary after serving as an economic adviser during the campaign. Trump also plans to install RNC Chairman Reince Priebus as his chief of staff and named his combative campaign adviser, Steve Bannon, as his chief strategist. \nMnuchin has close ties to Wall Street, and his nomination could undermine Trump’s campaign promise to “drain the swamp” of special interests. Trump frequently lambasted big banks while on the stump – and Goldman Sachs in particular – and advocated the reinstatement of Glass-Steagall legislation that once separated retail and investment banks. In addition, Mnuchin’s involvement in the purchase in 2009 of a failed bank at the heart of the housing bust could create conflicts of interest down the road. Advertisement Continue reading \n“Anyone concerned about Wall Street billionaires rigging the economy should be terrified by the prospect of a Treasury Secretary Mnuchin,” the activist campaign Take on Wall Street said in a statement. \nMnuchin did not immediately return a request for comment. But Stephen Moore, one of Trump’s economic advisers during the campaign, called Mnuchin “extremely knowledgeable.” He added that Mnuchin’s primary focus would likely be to shepard passage of Trump’s tax plan through Congress. \n“He clearly, like Donald Trump, understands that the number one goal for this administration is going to be to grow the economy and get jobs,” Moore said. \nIn news interviews, Mnuchin has said he was not previously close to Trump, but the two move in the same circles of big-money financiers, willing to take big risks in the face of improbable odds. \nTrump’s campaign was just the latest big bet in Mnuchin’s varied career in the upper echelons of finance, which has stretched from New York to Hollywood. Goldman Sachs, the New York investment bank, is a family affair for Mnuchin. Before he worked at the Wall Street giant, his father, Robert Mnuchin, spent more than 33 years at the bank. His brother, Alan, was a Goldman Sachs’ vice president. \nMnuchin spent 17 years at the bank rising from its savings and loan business to mortgage-backed bond training before becoming the bank’s chief information officer in 1999. Mnuchin is a “very smart guy,” Lloyd Blankfein, chief executive of Goldman Sachs, said earlier this month. \n“He was a very senior guy at a very young age at Goldman Sachs,” he said. \nBlankfein said Mnuchin reported to him when he ran the fixed income division, but they haven’t spoken much in recent years. “I’m sure he stayed just as smart as he was when he was at Goldman,” he said.

He then founded his own private equity fund, Dune Capital Management. Among its most notable investments was the purchase of IndyMac from the FDIC during the depths of the financial crisis in 2009. \nDune was part of a consortium of investors who bought the failed subprime lender for about $1.3 billion, and Mnuchin oversaw the rebuilding of its business as chief executive of the re-named OneWest. (A member of Trump’s economic advisory team, John Paulson, was also part of the investor group.) \nUnder Mnuchin, the bank more than doubled its branches and increased its assets. But it also faced criticism from advocacy groups who complained about aggressive foreclosure tactics. At one point, activists marched to Mnuchin’s home in Bel Air to protest its treatment of customers. \nAs Treasury Secretary, Mnuchin would be responsible for the Trump administration’s ongoing response to the aftermath of the housing bust. A crisis-era program that helps homeowners refinance their mortgages, for example, is not scheduled to end until next year. \n“The notion that a candidate who got elected in part due to the ongoing consequences from the housing crisis would hire someone who profiteered from the housing crisis is just kind of appalling,” said Jeff Hauser, executive director at the Revolving Door Project at the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research. \nIn 2014, OneWest was sold to financial services firm CIT Group for $3.4 billion. Mnuchin is chairman of CIT’s board of directors but is not involved in day-to-day operations. \nAfter moving to California with the purchase of IndyMac, Mnuchin also became involved in financing Hollywood films. Dune Capital invested in several blockbusters, including American Sniper, Gravity, Avatar, and Life of Pi. \nAccording to Open Secrets, Mnuchin donated more than $200,000 to the RNC during the election. Together with his wife, Heather, they have contributed a total of $465,000 since 1995 – with $13,400 supporting Trump rival Hillary Clinton’s campaigns for Senate and even the White House. \n––– \nThe Washington Post’s Renae Merle contributed to this report. \ntrump-treasury",

President-elect Donald Trump and his transition team are in the process of filling cabinet and other high level positions for the new administration. Mnuchin is expected to be selected for Treasury Secretary. Drew Angerer Getty Images i \nBy Kevin G. Hall and Anita Kumar \nMcClatchy Washington Bureau Order Reprint of this Story WASHINGTON \nPresident-elect Donald Trump will nominate Steven Mnuchin to head the Treasury Department, one of the senior-most positions in his administration, according to a person with knowledge of the situation but not authorized to speak publicly. \nA film producer, banker and investor with no government experience who served as Trump’s finance chairman during the campaign, Mnuchin is expected to be named to the Cabinet position Wednesday. \nMnuchin is a 17-year veteran of Wall Street powerhouse Goldman Sachs, where his father had served on the management committee. He left in 2002 and founded a hedge fund called Dune Capital Management. He also sits on the board of directors of retailing giant Sears Holding Corp. He had two companies that were involved in providing capital for movies such as the “X-Men” franchise and “Avatar.” \nJohn Allison , the former CEO of Winston-Salem-based BB&T, had been seen as a potential candidate for the post, meeting Monday with Trump and other aides. \nMnuchin is sure to face questions about his banking ties in California, which suffered greatly during the housing crisis in 2008. \n“Steven Mnuchin...made himself enormously wealthy by cashing in on the country’s financial collapse,” the group Americans for Financial Reform said in a statement Tuesday night. “He purchased a bailed-out bank for pennies on the dollar and then aggressively foreclosed on tens of thousands of families. Anyone concerned about Wall Street billionaires rigging the economy should be terrified by the prospect of a Treasury Secretary Mnuchin.” \nConsumer advocacy groups charge that Mnuchin as a banker exacerbated the foreclosure crisis in California. He led a group of powerful investors in 2009 that purchased the assets of failed lender IndyMac Bank, which had specialized in loans to weaker borrowers and was taken over by the government during the financial crisis. As part of the deal, the government agreed to absorb some of the potential losses. \nFrom the ​ruins of IndyMac came OneWest Bank, based in Pasadena, Calif. It was owned by a holding company led by Mnuchin and composed of hedge fund giants. They included billionaire George Soros and John Paulson, who famously made billions betting on the collapse of housing finance. They were part of the plot of the book and movie “The Big Short.” \nJust four years later, they all roughly doubled their investments when it was announced that New York-based CIT Group would purchase OneWest Bank for $3.4 billion. Mnuchin sits on the CIT board of directors. \n“We expect that the Senate will dig into Mr. Mnuchin’s track record, and we imagine the many families who lost their homes at the hands of OneWest will be watching closely and will also want to share their experiences as part of any confirmation hearings,” Paulina Gonzalez, executive director at the California Reinvestment Coalition, a housing advocacy group, said in a statement. \nTrump has pledged to rid Washington of Wall Street’s influence, part of a broader call to “drain the swap.” Democrats quickly pounced on the nomination. \n“Nominating Steve Mnuchin to be treasury secretary – a billionaire hedge fund manager and Goldman Sachs alumnus who preyed on homeowners struggling during the recession – is a slap in the face to voters who hoped he would shake up Washington,” said said Adam Hodge, a spokesman for the Democratic National Committee. \nThe treasury nominee also holds a unusual place in pop culture as financier of Hollywood hits. \nThe Warner Brothers movie “The Accountant,” in theaters now, was produced with Mnuchin’s Ratpac-Dune Entertainment, and the new treasury nominee appears in the credits as an executive producer. Mnuchin also has a cameo in “Rules Don’t Apply,” a movie directed by Warren Beatty and in theaters now. Mnuchin plays a Merrill Lynch executive in the film. Ironically, also in that movie is actor Alec Baldwin, whose portrayal of Trump on Saturday Night Live has angered the president-elect. \nThe incoming treasury secretary will face a number of difficult issues in a Trump administration, especially if the president-elect makes good on promises to have a more confrontational approach to China. It could lead to an upward cascade of prices for consumers. \nBoth the Bush and Obama administrations, in annual reports to the Congress, raised concerns routinely about China’s semi-fixed exchange rate. They argue that financial markets should set the value of China’s yuan against the U.S. dollar, not China’s government. \nBut both presidents declined to label China a currency manipulator, a designation that would allow Congress to seek retaliatory action such as imposing a compensatory penalty in goods imported from China. \nThe past two Treasury departments have instead engaged in a strategic dialogue with China, meeting twice a year, one in each country’s capital. \nThe new treasury secretary will likely preside over a revamp of corporate taxation, if not the entire tax code. Tax legislation by law is introduced in the House of Representatives and has been promised for a number of years running. \nThe president-elect has already had conversations with Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady, R-Texas, to begin narrowing differences between Trump’s campaign proposals and a tax plan offered by House Republicans in June. \nThe next treasury secretary will also have to deal with issues of deficits and the debt ceiling. Republicans who’ve led both chambers had engaged in brinksmanship with President Barack Obama, bringing the nation close to defaulting on government debt before raising the legal borrowing limits. \nThat ceiling must be raised again, and is estimated to bump against the limit in May. Some deficit-concerned Republicans may push back if Trump’s tax cuts and spending plans threaten to significantly widen deficits. \nMany Republicans would also like to see a number of key provisions of the 2010 revamp of financial regulation overturned. The so-called Dodd-Frank Act sought to rein in the bad behavior on Wall Street that led to 2008’s deep financial crisis, including the independence of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which has put curbs on a number of lending practices advocacy groups deemed predatory. \nMost recently, the CFPB issued a massive fine against Wells Fargo & Co. for its creation of phony bank accounts to meet sales targets. The mounting criticism, even after a formal apology before a Senate panel, led to CEO John Stumpf’s resignation, and attracted attention on the bank’s spending on lobbyists. \nThe next treasury secretary will also wade into the complex web of financial sanctions imposed on Iran, and recently lifted in part, in the effort to curb the Persian nation’s nuclear ambitions. Trump has blasted the Obama administration’s deal to disarm Iran and vowed to reimpose a range of financial sanctions. That will put him at odds with Europe, Russia and other international powers, and will be another challenge awaiting the next leader to occupy the historic building adjoining the White House. \nKevin G.

      "text": "President-elect Donald Trump has tapped Steven Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs banker who profited from the housing meltdown, as his Treasury secretary, according to an official briefed on the decision.\nSteven Mnuchin, finance chairman for the Trump campaign, arrives at Trump Tower, Nov. 15, 2016, in New York City. (Credit: Drew Angerer/Getty Images)\nMnuchin’s career has been full of contradictions. He started as a Wall Street insider working for old-line firms before running a series of eclectic businesses — including his own hedge fund and a West Coast consumer bank. In recent years, he has been a Hollywood movie producer.\nHe served as finance chairman of Trump’s presidential campaign and has been one of Trump’s closest economic advisers. His nomination will be announced as soon as Wednesday, the official said.\nDemocrats immediately signaled their strong opposition to the expected nomination, which would require Senate confirmation. In a statement, the Democratic National Committee quipped “So much for draining the swamp.” The DNC added that “nominating Steve Mnuchin to be Treasury Secretary… is a slap in the face to voters who hoped he would shake up Washington.”\nAs Treasury secretary, the 53-year-old Mnuchin would be the face of the American economy around the world. The Treasury Department has expansive responsibility over business and oversees banking regulations, financial markets and the IRS. It has about 100,000 employees, an estimated 91,000 of them at the IRS.\nBesides co-signing the currency, the Treasury secretary is Uncle Sam’s banker — paying the bills, collecting taxes, managing the federal government debt and selling billions of dollars a year in Treasury bonds.\nMnuchin, like his father before him, was a partner at Goldman. He worked for the firm for 17 years, joining at age 22 and leaving just before his 40th birthday, in 2002.\nHe briefly joined the hedge fund of his former college roommate Eddie Lampert. Mnuchin still serves as a director of Sears Holdings, of which Lampert is chairman and CEO.\nAfter less than a year, he left Lampert to work as a portfolio manager for the hedge fund of George Soros, the billionaire financier who has bankrolled liberal candidates and causes — and who was depicted as a villain in Trump’s last campaign ad.\nHe only stayed a year, leaving in September 2004 to start his own hedge fund, Dune Capital Management.\nAs a producer, he has put out films including “American Sniper,” “The Lego Movie” and this summer’s “Suicide Squad.” His latest film, which opened right before Thanksgiving, is called “Rules Don’t Apply.”\nMnuchin joined the Trump campaign as finance chairman in May, and sources tell CNN he made it clear early that he wanted the Treasury job. He recruited deputies before he was tapped for the job.\nMnuchin has contributed to both Republican and Democratic candidates, including Hillary Clinton’s Senate campaigns and 2008 presidential run. He gave to Barack Obama’s Senate and presidential campaigns and to Charles Schumer, the new Democratic leader in the Senate.\nMnuchin and his brother were sued by the trustee trying to recover money for Bernard Madoff’s victims after his Ponzi scheme unraveled in 2008. They were executors of their mother’s estate, and had withdrawn her investment with Madoff shortly after she died in 2005.\nA court eventually blocked the trustee, Irving Picard, from collecting Mnuchin’s mother’s $3.2 million in profits withdrawn from the Madoff fund long before its collapse.\nMnuchin led the group that bought failed subprime lender IndyMac for pennies on the dollar in 2009, about a year after the FDIC took over the California bank following a run on deposits by customers.\nIndyMac had become a poster child for the risky home loans that brought on the housing crisis and the meltdown in financial markets. The FDIC agreed to assume much of the losses as part of its sale to Mnuchin, who renamed it OneWest.\nBut regulators soon questioned OneWest’s foreclosure practices, which included so-called robo-signings that pushed homeowners into foreclosure without proper review or due process.\nThe bank was one of many that agreed to pay millions in fines to compensate customers. Occupy Los Angeles protesters showed up at Mnuchin’s Bel Air mansion. And this month, two fair housing groups in California filed a complaint with the Department of Housing and Urban Development, accusing the bank of discriminating against minority borrowers during his tenure there.\nMnuchin eventually sold OneWest to CIT Group in 2014 for $3.4 billion and joined CIT as part of the deal. When he left CIT less than two years later, he received a $10.9 million severance package.\n38.907192 -77.036871 ",

      "text": "News and commentary about the stocks you need to know about today Search Stocks to Watch2 November 29, 2016, 11:48 A.M. ET Goldman Sachs Gets Upgraded and Downgraded. Which One’s Right? By Ben Levisohn \nGoldman Sachs ( GS ) got upgraded by KBW today, but downgraded by Instinet , with the disagreement centering on whether the investment bank’s nearly 30% rise during the past three months means it’s come too far, too fast. Getty Images \nInstinet’s Steven Chubak and team explain why they cut Goldman Sachs to Neutral from Buy: \nFollowing the recent rally, we see risk / reward as more balanced for Goldman Sachs, given an already low tax rate / heavier international gearing; lower asset sensitivity; higher risk of multiple rebasing (akin to 2004-06 rate cycle); and weaker excess capital / buyback capacity. \nKBW’s Brian Kleinhanzl and Michael Brown explain why they upgraded Goldman Sachs to Outperform from Market Perform: \nWe are expecting an improved trading outlook on higher volatility and we believe investors would be best positioned for higher volatility and trading volumes by owning shares of Goldman Sachs. We increased our earnings estimates 11.8% and 13.9% in 2017 and 2018, respectively. Our $240 price target and dividend assumptions imply 15.4% total return over the next twelve months. Our updated price target represents 10.7x our 2018 EPS estimate and this is below the peer average of 11.1x estimates. We believe there could be additional upside in shares of GS should global economic growth improve at a faster pace or deregulation occur on a wider scale (such as a Volcker rollback). \nWho’s right? Well, the market is siding with KBW. Shares of Goldman Sachs have gained 1.1% to $212.10 at 11:39 a.m., while the Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF ( XLF ) has risen 0.4% to $22.25. Barron’s Steven Sears recommended Goldman Sachs in August when it was trading at $173.",

      "text": "November 29, 2016 5:59 PM Trump taps Goldman Sachs movie mogul to head Treasury Department Steven Mnuchin, national finance chairman of President-elect Donald Trump's campaign, waves after speaking to media at Trump Tower, Wednesday, Nov. 16, 2016, in New York. Carolyn Kaster AP i \nBy Kevin G. Hall and Anita Kumar \nMcClatchy Washington Bureau   WASHINGTON \nPresident-elect Donald Trump will nominate Steven Mnuchin to head the Treasury Department, one of the senior-most positions in his administration, according to a person with knowledge of the situation but not authorized to speak publicly. \nA film producer, banker and investor with no government experience who served as Trump’s finance chairman during the campaign, Mnuchin is expected to be named to the Cabinet position Wednesday. \nMnuchin is a 17-year veteran of Wall Street powerhouse Goldman Sachs, where his father had served on the management committee. He left in 2002 and founded a hedge fund called Dune Capital Management. He also sits on the board of directors of retailing giant Sears Holding Corp . He had two companies that were involved in providing capital for movies such as the “X-Men” franchise and “Avatar.” \nHe’s sure to face questions about his banking ties in California , which suffered greatly during the housing crisis in 2008. \n“Steven Mnuchin...made himself enormously wealthy by cashing in on the country’s financial collapse,” the group Americans for Financial Reform said in a statement Tuesday night. “He purchased a bailed-out bank for pennies on the dollar and then aggressively foreclosed on tens of thousands of families. Anyone concerned about Wall Street billionaires rigging the economy should be terrified by the prospect of a Treasury Secretary Mnuchin.” \nConsumer advocacy groups charge that Mnuchin as a banker exacerbated the foreclosure crisis in California. He led a group of powerful investors in 2009 that purchased the assets of failed lender IndyMac Bank, which had specialized in loans to weaker borrowers and was taken over by the government during the financial crisis. As part of the deal, the government agreed to absorb some of the potential losses. \nFrom the ​ruins of IndyMac came OneWest Bank, based in Pasadena, Calif. It was owned by a holding company led by Mnuchin and composed of hedge fund giants. They included billionaire George Soros and John Paulson, who famously made billions betting on the collapse of housing finance. They were part of the plot of the book and movie “The Big Short.” \nJust four years later, they all roughly doubled their investments when it was announced that New York-based CIT Group would purchase OneWest Bank for $3.4 billion . Mnuchin sits on the CIT board of directors. \n“We expect that the Senate will dig into Mr. Mnuchin’s track record, and we imagine the many families who lost their homes at the hands of OneWest will be watching closely and will also want to share their experiences as part of any confirmation hearings,”Paulina Gonzalez, executive director at the California Reinvestment Coalition, a housing advocacy group, said in a statement. \nTrump has pledged to rid Washington of Wall Street’s influence, part of a broader call to “drain the swap.” Democrats quickly pounced on the nomination. \n“Nominating Steve Mnuchin to be treasury secretary – a billionaire hedge fund manager and Goldman Sachs alumnus who preyed on homeowners struggling during the recession – is a slap in the face to voters who hoped he would shake up Washington,” said said Adam Hodge, a spokesman for the Democratic National Committee. \nThe treasury nominee also holds a unusual place in pop culture as financier of Hollywood hits. \nThe Warner Brothers movie “The Accountant,” in theaters now, was produced with Mnuchin’s Ratpac-Dune Entertainment, and the new treasury nominee appears in the credits as an executive producer. Mnuchin also has a cameo in “Rules Don’t Apply,” a movie directed by Warren Beatty and in theaters now. Mnuchin plays a Merrill Lynch executive in the film. Ironically, also in that movie is actor Alec Baldwin, whose portrayal of Trump on Saturday Night Live has angered the president-elect. \nThe incoming treasury secretary will face a number of difficult issues in a Trump administration, especially if the president-elect makes good on promises to have a more confrontational approach to China. It could lead to an upward cascade of prices for consumers. \nBoth the Bush and Obama administrations, in annual reports to the Congress, raised concerns routinely about China’s semi-fixed exchange rate . They argue that financial markets should set the value of China’s yuan against the U.S. dollar, not China’s government. \nBut both presidents declined to label China a currency manipulator , a designation that would allow Congress to seek retaliatory action such as imposing a compensatory penalty in goods imported from China. \nThe past two Treasury departments have instead engaged in a strategic dialogue with China, meeting twice a year, one in each country’s capital. \nThe new treasury secretary will likely preside over a revamp of corporate taxation, if not the entire tax code. Tax legislation by law is introduced in the House of Representatives and has been promised for a number of years running. \nThe president-elect has already had conversations with Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady, R-Texas, to begin narrowing differences between Trump’s campaign proposals and a tax plan offered by House Republicans in June. \nThe next treasury secretary will also have to deal with issues of deficits and the debt ceiling. Republicans who’ve led both chambers had engaged in brinksmanship with President Barack Obama, bringing the nation close to defaulting on government debt before raising the legal borrowing limits. \nThat ceiling must be raised again, and is estimated to bump against the limit in May. Some deficit-concerned Republicans may push back if Trump’s tax cuts and spending plans threaten to significantly widen deficits. \nMany Republicans would also like to see a number of key provisions of the 2010 revamp of financial regulation overturned. The so-called Dodd-Frank Act sought to rein in the bad behavior on Wall Street that led to 2008’s deep financial crisis, including the independence of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which has put curbs on a number of lending practices advocacy groups deemed predatory. \nMost recently, the CFPB issued a massive fine against Wells Fargo & Co . for its creation of phony bank accounts to meet sales targets. The mounting criticism, even after a formal apology before a Senate panel , led to CEO John Stumpf’s resignation, and attracted attention on the bank’s spending on lobbyists . \nThe next treasury secretary will also wade into the complex web of financial sanctions imposed on Iran, and recently lifted in part, in the effort to curb the Persian nation’s nuclear ambitions . Trump has blasted the Obama administration’s deal to disarm Iran and vowed to reimpose a range of financial sanctions. That will put him at odds with Europe, Russia and other international powers, and will be another challenge awaiting the next leader to occupy the historic building adjoining the White House.",

      "text": "Eli Miller, left, chief operating officer of the Trump campaign, and Steve Mnuchin, national finance chairman for the Trump campaign, arrive at Trump Tower, November 29, 2016 in New York City. (Photo: Drew Angerer / Getty Images) \nSteven Mnuchin, who spent 17 years at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and later ran a hedge fund, was picked by President-elect Donald Trump as the next U.S. Treasury secretary, a person familiar with the decision said.\nThe 53-year-old Mnuchin would be the second Goldman Sachs alumnus to be given a key role in the incoming administration, following Stephen Bannon’s nod as chief strategist and senior counselor. If confirmed by the Senate, Mnuchin would become the third former Goldman Sachs executive to head the Treasury since the mid-1990s.\nAt the Treasury, Mnuchin will be a crucial player in carrying out Trump’s campaign pledges to quickly tackle some of the nation’s most contentious political, economic and diplomatic issues. Those include overhauling the tax code, reconsidering a deal that lifted some sanctions on Iran, renegotiating trade agreements to help American manufacturers and designating China a currency manipulator.\nMnuchin was in and out of meetings at Trump Tower Tuesday but he wasn’t listed by the transition team as among those the president-elect was scheduled to meet. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the decision hasn’t been announced by the transition team.\nMnuchin, who donated to Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential campaigns but backed Republican Mitt Romney in 2012, served as national finance chairman in charge of fundraising for Trump’s winning White House run.\nLittle is known about the views of Mnuchin (pronounced ma-NOO-shin) regarding interest rates, fiscal policy, or whether he would continue the strong-dollar mantra of his predecessors. He comes from a pedigree of Wall Street elites: His father was on the management committee at Goldman Sachs before founding an art gallery on New York’s Upper East Side, while his brother Alan’s resume includes now-defunct financial companies Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and Bear Stearns Cos.\nInauguration Day is scheduled for Jan. 20, and hearings for Cabinet-level positions like Treasury secretary typically occur in the weeks after the new president takes office. Given his Goldman Sachs roots and his dealings during the financial crisis, he may face sharp questioning during his Senate hearing.\nThe Mnuchin family pocketed about $3.2 million in fake profit from a fake account with convicted con man Bernard Madoff. It was money that didn’t have to be returned to victims because it had been removed before Madoff’s Ponzi scheme was exposed. The Treasury nominee himself profited from the housing market crash in 2008 when he and a group of investors bought a failed California mortgage lender and, after recapitalizing and renaming it, sold it for more than double the purchase price.\nMnuchin’s role in buying the bank, then called IndyMac, may hold clues to what his leadership at the Treasury department means for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The two companies have been under U.S. control since 2008, sending their almost all of their profits to the Treasury. Just before the crisis hit, Mnuchin was financing movies, including Avatar, at 20th Century Fox.\nIn the new job, Mnuchin would inherit an era of rising government debt just as the Treasury will need to finance Trump’s expansionary fiscal plans. The U.S. budget deficit is forecast to widen and could go higher if Trump needs to finance a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border, cut taxes and spend $1 trillion on infrastructure. Investors say the new era of steep increases in debt issuance could cause market turbulence.\nWhile traditionally a Treasury secretary with Wall Street experience has been associated with dollar strength, Mnuchin inherits a list of campaign promises filled with trade policy rhetoric that could collide with currency policy, said Alan Ruskin, head of currency research at Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.\n“It’s possible that that the strong dollar will be worn by the coming administration as a badge of honor — a signal of global confidence in Trumpism,’” he said. “You need a stronger exchange rate, otherwise you’re going to have too much inflation pressure, meaning the bond market would blow up.”\nRuskin sees room for the dollar to appreciate at least 5 percent given the prospect of fiscal expansion under Trump.\nThe president-elect’s pledge that he’ll direct the Treasury to designate China a currency manipulator as one of his first official acts could also impact the U.S.’s financing outlook. The U.S. has long relied on insatiable demand from international investors for its debt. China is the largest foreign holder of U.S. debt. Although the stockpile is at the lowest level in nearly four years, it’s still a massive $1.16 trillion.\nAs Treasury chief, Mnuchin will lead the Financial Stability Oversight Council, established under the Dodd-Frank Act that Trump wants to unwind. The 2010 law aimed to prevent future crises similar to those of 2008-09 with an overhaul of U.S. financial regulation. Asked about Dodd-Frank before the election, Mnuchin said there are good and bad things about it, without elaborating.\nHe’ll also chair the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., through which he could raise protective barriers by rejecting Chinese investments.\nMnuchin stands to save millions in taxes should the Senate confirm his nomination. A 1989 rule would allow him to sell stock tax-free if he reinvests in Treasuries or government-approved funds. Mnuchin owns $97 million of CIT Group Inc., according to a February ownership filing.\nMnuchin hails from the kind of elite institutions Trump spent much of his campaign vilifying. He worked for a time with George Soros, and co-founded the hedge fund Dune Capital Management LP.\nSenator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts on Nov. 15 assailed Trump for what she called a slew of “special interests, Wall Street elites and insiders” joining the White House transition team.\n“The American people are watching to see if you were sincere in your campaign promises to look out for the interests of working families, rather than the interests of the rich and powerful,” Warren said.",

      "text": "Former Goldman Sachs partner Steven Mnuchin is President-elect Donald Trump’s likely choice for secretary of the treasury, The New York Times reported on Tuesday. Mnuchin began his career at Goldman Sachs, then started a hedge fund before moving to invest in the movie business. The Wall Street insider has never held a government position.\nMr. Mnuchin, 53, was the national finance chairman for Mr. Trump’s campaign. He began his career at Goldman Sachs, where he became a partner, before creating his own hedge fund, moving to the West Coast and entering the first rank of movie financiers by bankrolling hits like the “X-Men” franchise and “Avatar.”\n[…]\nAfter leaving Goldman in 2002, he founded Dune Capital Management, a hedge fund named after the dunes near his beach house in the Hamptons.\nHe also started investing in the movie business and bought a house in Bel-Air. He is engaged to the actress Louise Linton, who would be his third wife. He told The Times in May that he has focused in recent years on the “West Coast economy,” although he added that he was not turning his back on Wall Street.\nMnuchin then moved to OneWest Bank , which battled claims of improper foreclosures during his tenure.\nMr. Mnuchin was part of a group that bought the failed California mortgage lender IndyMac from the government in 2009. He became chairman of the company, renamed OneWest, which was ultimately sold to CIT, the nation’s largest small-business lender, in 2015 for more than twice the price the group had paid.\nDuring his tenure, OneWest faced allegations that it had foreclosed improperly on some borrowers. Fair-housing groups also filed a complaint with the federal government, alleging that OneWest was not meeting its legal obligation to make loans in minority neighborhoods.\nMnuchin has been a Trump supporter since the early stages of his presidential campaign. He even attended a victory party for Trump after he won New York’s Republican presidential primary.\nBut Mr. Mnuchin has said that he agrees with Mr. Trump’s priorities, and he was an early supporter of a candidate who clearly prizes loyalty.\nWhen Mr. Trump won New York’s Republican presidential primary in April, Mr. Mnuchin attended the victory party. The next day, he accepted Mr. Trump’s invitation to become the campaign’s national finance director.\nMnuchin and Trump have known each other for a long time.",

      "text": "President-elect Donald Trump has tapped Steven Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs banker who profited from the housing meltdown, as his Treasury Mnuchin's career has been full of contradictions. He started as a Wall Street insider working for old-line firms before running a series of eclectic businesses -- including his own hedge fund and a West Coast consumer bank. In recent years, He served as finance chairman of Trump's presidential campaign and has been one of Trump's closest economic advisers. His nomination will be announced as As Treasury secretary, the 53-year-old Mnuchin would be the face of the American economy around the world. The Treasury Department has expansive responsibility over business and oversees banking regulations, financial markets and the IRS. It has about 100,000 employees, an estimated 91,000 of them at Besides co-signing the currency, the Treasury secretary is Uncle Sam's banker -- paying the bills, collecting taxes, managing the federal government debt and Mnuchin, like his father before him, was a partner at Goldman. He worked for the firm for 17 years, joining at age 22 and leaving just before his 40th He briefly joined the hedge fund of his former college roommate Eddie Lampert. Mnuchin still serves as a director of Sears Holdings (SHLD), of which Lampert is chairman and CEO. After less than a year, he left Lampert to work as a portfolio manager for the hedge fund of George Soros, the billionaire financier who has bankrolled liberal candidates and causes -- and who was depicted as a villain in Trump's last campaign ad. He only stayed a year, leaving in September 2004 to start his own hedge fund, Dune Capital Management. As a producer, he has put out films including \"American Sniper,\"\"The Lego Movie\" and this summer's \"suicide Squad.\" His latest film, which opened right before Thanksgiving, is called \"Rules Don't Apply.\" Mnuchin joined the Trump campaign as finance chairman in May, and sources tell CNN he made it clear early that he wanted the Treasury job. He recruited deputies before he was tapped for the job. Mnuchin has contributed to both Republican and Democratic candidates, including Hillary Clinton's Senate campaigns and 2008 presidential run. He gave to Barack Obama's Senate and presidential campaigns and to Charles Schumer, the new Democratic leader in the Senate.

      "text": "NEW YORK — President-elect Donald Trump has tapped Steven Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs banker who profited from the housing meltdown, as his Treasury secretary, according to an official briefed on the decision.\nMnuchin’s career has been full of contradictions. He started as a Wall Street insider working for old-line firms before running a series of eclectic businesses — including his own hedge fund and a West Coast consumer bank. In recent years, he has been a Hollywood movie producer.\nHe served as finance chairman of Trump’s presidential campaign and has been one of Trump’s closest economic advisers. His nomination will be announced as soon as Wednesday, the official said.\nAs Treasury secretary, the 53-year-old Mnuchin would be the face of the American economy around the world. The Treasury Department has expansive responsibility over business and oversees banking regulations, financial markets and the IRS. It has about 100,000 employees, an estimated 91,000 of them at the IRS.\nBesides co-signing the currency, the Treasury secretary is Uncle Sam’s banker, paying the bills, collecting taxes, managing the federal government debt and selling billions of dollars a year in Treasury bonds.\nMnuchin, like his father before him, was a partner at Goldman. He worked for the firm for 17 years, joining at age 22 and leaving just before his 40th birthday, in 2002.\nHe briefly joined the hedge fund of his former college roommate Eddie Lampert. Mnuchin still serves as a director of Sears Holdings, of which Lampert is chairman and CEO.\nAfter less than a year, he left Lampert to work as a portfolio manager for the hedge fund of George Soros, the billionaire financier who has bankrolled liberal candidates and causes — and who was depicted as a villain in Trump’s last campaign ad.\nHe only stayed a year, leaving in September 2004 to start his own hedge fund, Dune Capital Management.\nAs a producer, he has put out films including “American Sniper,” “The Lego Movie” and this summer’s “Suicide Squad.” His latest film, which opened right before Thanksgiving, is called “Rules Don’t Apply.”\nMnuchin joined the Trump campaign as finance chairman in May, and sources tell CNN he made it clear early that he wanted the Treasury job. He recruited deputies before he was tapped for the job.\nMnuchin has contributed to both Republican and Democratic candidates, including Hillary Clinton’s Senate campaigns and 2008 presidential run. He gave to Barack Obama’s Senate and presidential campaigns and to Charles Schumer, the new Democratic leader in the Senate.\nMnuchin and his brother were sued by the trustee trying to recover money for Bernard Madoff’s victims after his Ponzi scheme unraveled in 2008. They were executors of their mother’s estate, and had withdrawn her investment with Madoff shortly after she died in 2005.\nA court eventually blocked the trustee, Irving Picard, from collecting his mother’s $3.2 million in profits withdrawn from the Madoff fund that long before its collapse.\nMnuchin led the group that bought failed subprime lender IndyMac for pennies on the dollar in 2009, about a year after the FDIC took over the California bank following a run on deposits by customers.\nIndyMac had become a poster child for the risky home loans that brought on the housing crisis and the meltdown in financial markets. The FDIC agreed to assume much of the losses as part of its sale to Mnuchin, who renamed it OneWest.\nBut regulators soon questioned OneWest’s foreclosure practices, which included so-called robo-signings that pushed homeowners into foreclosure without proper review or due process.\nThe bank was one of many that agreed to pay millions in fines to compensate customers. Occupy Los Angeles protesters showed up at Mnuchin’s Bel Air mansion. And this month two fair housing groups in California filed a complaint with the Department of Housing and Urban Development, accusing the bank of discriminating against minority borrowers during his tenure there.\nMnuchin eventually sold OneWest to CIT Group in 2014 for $3.4 billion and joined CIT as part of the deal. When he left CIT less than two years later, he received a $10.9 million severance package.",

      "text": "View Comments Pic: Reuters President-elect Donald Trump is expected to name former Goldman Sachs partner and Hollywood financier Steven Mnuchin as his nominee for Treasury secretary, a source said on Tuesday, putting a Wall Street veteran in the top U.S. economic Cabinet post for the first time in eight years. Mnuchin, who was Trump's presidential campaign finance chairman, could be named as early as Wednesday, said a Republican source close to the decision. Mnuchin was chosen over several high-profile candidates, including JPMorgan Chase Chairman Jamie Dimon and Republican Representative Jeb Hensarling, chairman of the powerful House Financial Services Committee. Mnuchin is the first person with Wall Street experience to head the Treasury since his former boss, Henry Paulson, the former Goldman Sachs CEO who served under President George W. Bush and steered Treasury through the chaotic initial stages of the 2008-2009 financial crisis. The selection of Mnuchin was first reported by The New York Times. A relatively little-known but successful private equity investor and hedge fund manager, Mnuchin spent 17 years at Goldman Sachs before leaving in 2002, when he launched Dune Capital Management. With Dune, Mnuchin has invested in movies produced by Rupert Murdoch's 20th Century Fox and Time Warner Inc's Warner Bros, including blockbusters \"Avatar,\" \"Mad Max: Fury Road\" and \"Suicide Squad.â ACQUIRED FAILED BANK The son of a Goldman Sachs partner who became an art dealer, Mnuchin worked hard to step outside his father's shadow and make a name for himself, former colleagues said, rising to become the firm's chief information officer in 1999. \"He wanted to prove that he was there on the merits,\" said a former Goldman colleague, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Mnuchin's experience running Goldman's mortgage-backed bond trading desk would later prove valuable when an opportunity arose in 2009 to buy the deeply discounted assets of failed California mortgage lender IndyMac Bank from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation during the financial crisis. He assembled an investor group that included hedge fund manager John Paulson to buy the assets for $1.55 billion, and moved to Los Angeles. After rebranding the operation OneWest Bank, Mnuchin built it with other assets and professional sports team sponsorships into Southern California's largest bank, with 73 branches and $23 billion in assets. His group sold OneWest to CIT Group Inc last year for $3.4 billion. But the bank came under fire for its foreclosure practices as housing advocacy groups accused it of being too quick to foreclose on struggling homeowners. In 2011, dozens of demonstrators descended on Mnuchin's $26.5 million home in the wealthy Bel Air neighborhood to protest OneWest's eviction tactics, according to the Los Angeles Times. This month, two housing groups filed a complaint asking the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to investigate complaints that OneWest engaged in discriminatory \"redlining\" practices against black and Latino communities. Although Mnuchin has a reputation for being a behind-the-scenes player in Hollywood, he does appear on screen in the 2016 film \"Rules Don't Apply,\" according to the IMDB movie database. The drama, opening in theaters Nov. 23, stars Warren Beatty, who also wrote and directed the film. - Reuters",

      "text": "\nDonald Trump is expected to name former Goldman Sachs and OneWest banker, Steven Mnuchin, as his pick for Treasury Secretary on Wednesday. Mnuchin’s name has been floated for weeks as a possible candidate for the role after having served on Trump’s campaign as its National Finance Director beginning in early April soon after Trump won the New York Primary. Mnuchin and Trump have been long-time friends, according to a New York Times story written in May shortly after Mnuchin accepted the role with the now President-elect’s campaign.\nWhile it may come as little surprise that Trump, who claims to place a high value on loyalty, would choose a long-time friend who worked diligently on his campaign for a top position in his administration, the choice of Steven Mnuchin for Secretary of the Treasury is sure to raise some eyebrows, both among Trump’s opponents and even among some of his supporters who, as speculated on the blog Zero Hedge and other outlets, thought he could be considering former banking CEO and anti-Federal-Reserve libertarian John Allison of the Cato Institute to head his Treasury Department.\nTrump did, after all, in much of his campaign rhetoric take a populist stance against Wall Street, even once attacking his primary opponent, Ted Cruz, whose wife is an executive at Goldman Sachs, for taking out a loan from that company to fund his 2012 Senate campaign, according to a story on Politifact .\nSteven Mnuchin expected as Donald Trump’s choice for Treasury Secretary. [Image by Drew Angerer/Getty Images]\nBut while Steven Mnuchin may not be the favorite pick for people who otherwise like and support Donald Trump, there could be some elements in Mnuchin’s history which will raise serious red flags for anyone predisposed to uneasiness over anything Donald Trump does. After graduating from Yale, Mnuchin started working at Goldman Sachs, where his father had been a long-time partner. At Goldman Sachs Mnuchin was in charge of overseeing the trading and sales of municipal and mortgage-backed bonds and of Government and money-market securities, according to the New York Times . After making millions at Goldman Sachs Mnuchin worked for a brief period at Soros Fund Management , owned by billionaire investor George Soros. He then went on to co-found a Hollywood production company, RatPac-Dune Entertainment, which has produced a number of X-men films and the highly successful Avatar .\nIn 2009 RatPac-Dune Entertainment purchased the f ailed housing lender IndyMac , renamed it OneWest and served as its chairman, the New York Times reports. It is during his tenure with OneWest, prior to it being sold to small-business lender CIT, that Mnuchin’s record could come under some intense scrutiny.\nOneWest was the subject of a number of wrongful foreclosure lawsuits, including one filed in San Luis Obispo County , California, which resulted in OneWest reaching a 7 figure settlement with the plaintiffs. A formal housing discrimination complaint was also filed earlier this year with the federal government against CIT alleging improprieties said to have occurred before the lending giant purchased OneWest. That complaint is currently under investigation by the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The Wall Street journal also reports that CIT was forced to pay a $230 million charge in July 2015 to clean up OneWest accounting problems .\nDonald Trump is filling his cabinet with billionaires and millionaires. [Image by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images] Trump’s cabinet is starting to look like it will have no shortage of billionaires to keep Trump company. In addition to the possibility of Trump naming Steven Mnuchin as his pick for Treasury Secretary, the President-elect has already named billionaire Betsy Devos as his choice for Education Secretary, and he is expected to name billionaire former investment banker Wilbur Ross as his Commerce Secretary. Other people in Trump’s growing inner political circle include millionaires such as Steve Bannon and Ben Carson, and there may or may not be truth to the rumors swirling that Mitt Romney will be named his pick for Secretary of State.\nDonald Trump positioned himself throughout his campaign as a political outsider focused on ‘draining the swamp’ in Washington. Steven Mnuchin as Treasury Secretary could be another in a series of post-election moves signaling that Trump may not be as ‘anti-establishment’ as much of his campaign rhetoric seemed designed to imply.\nTrump names former Goldman Sachs partner with no gov't experience as Treasury Secretary. Surprise surprise. He chose Wall St over Main St.\n— George Takei (@GeorgeTakei) November 29, 2016 \n\n[Featured Image by Drew Angerer/Getty Images] Steven Mnuchin: Donald Trump Expected To Name Billionaire Banker As Treasury Secretary Pick is an article from: The Inquisitr News \n",

He also acts recently playing the role of a Merrill Lynch executive in “Rules Don't Apply.” The film, directed by Warren Beatty, tells the story of two employees who work for eccentric billionaire Howard Hughes.\nAt 54 years old, Mnuchin’s net worth is estimated to be around $40 million, much of which was earned during his partner years at Goldman Sachs ( GS ). Prior to getting involved in politics, he was a fixture on New York’s society set frequenting galas and serving on boards, including the Whitney Museum of American Art, as reported by the Wall Street Journal.\nMore From FOXBusiness.com...

      "text": "President-elect Donald Trump is expected to name former Goldman Sachs executive, and Hollywood producer, Steve Mnuchin as the next Treasury Secretary. An announcement is imminent, according to sources close to the decision making.\nContinue Reading Below\nPrior to the election, FOX Business was first to report that the Yale graduate, who also ran a hedge fund and served as Trump’s campaign finance chief, was the frontrunner for what is one of the president’s top cabinet positions. Along with a deep background in finance, Mnuchin has produced films including “American Sniper” and “Batman vs. Superman,” according to the Internet Movie Database. He also acts most recently playing the role of a Merrill Lynch executive in “Rules Don't Apply.”\nMnuchin, if selected, would follow other Wall Street titans who have held the Treasury role including former New York Federal Reserve President Timothy Geithner and former Goldman Sachs Chairman and CEO Henry “Hank” Paulson. Both played a role in navigating the U.S. through the financial crisis that began in 2008.\nWall Street is likely to applaud Trump’s pick on the view he will pursue his economic agenda which promises less regulation and lower corporate taxes. Earlier this month billionaire investor Carl Icahn predicted President-elect Donald Trump would likely select Mnuchin.\nMore From FOXBusiness.com... Who will be the next Treasury Secretary? Gasparino on Trump's cabinet selections Carl Icahn Sets Record Straight on Role with Trump Carl Icahn Believes Steven Mnuchin Will Become Treasury Secretary “I think Steve is a very smart guy. I think Steve at that job would do better than I would and I think he will do a very capable job. I think he is a real loyalist for Donald. He wants to do the same program that Donald wants to do,” said Icahn during an interview on the FOX Business Network’s The Intelligence Report.\nEarly in Trump’s campaign he said Icahn would make a great Treasury Secretary. Icahn said he didn’t want the job but would prefer to advise Trump on economic policies if needed.\nContinue Reading Below",

      "text": "NEW YORK — President-elect Donald Trump has tapped Steven Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs banker who profited from the housing meltdown, as his Treasury secretary, according to an official briefed on the decision.\nMnuchin’s career has been full of contradictions. He started as a Wall Street insider working for old-line firms before running a series of eclectic businesses — including his own hedge fund and a West Coast consumer bank. In recent years, he has been a Hollywood movie producer.\nHe served as finance chairman of President-elect Trump’s presidential campaign and has been one of President-elect Trump’s closest economic advisers. His nomination will be announced as soon as Wednesday, the official said.\nDemocrats immediately signaled their strong opposition to the expected nomination, which would require Senate confirmation. In a statement, the Democratic National Committee quipped “So much for draining the swamp.” The DNC added that “nominating Steve Mnuchin to be Treasury Secretary… is a slap in the face to voters who hoped he would shake up Washington.”\nAs Treasury secretary, the 53-year-old Mnuchin would be the face of the American economy around the world. The Treasury Department has expansive responsibility over business and oversees banking regulations, financial markets and the IRS. It has about 100,000 employees, an estimated 91,000 of them at the IRS.\nBesides co-signing the currency, the Treasury secretary is Uncle Sam’s banker — paying the bills, collecting taxes, managing the federal government debt and selling billions of dollars a year in Treasury bonds.\nMnuchin, like his father before him, was a partner at Goldman. He worked for the firm for 17 years, joining at age 22 and leaving just before his 40th birthday, in 2002.\nHe briefly joined the hedge fund of his former college roommate Eddie Lampert. Mnuchin still serves as a director of Sears Holdings, of which Lampert is chairman and CEO.\nAfter less than a year, he left Lampert to work as a portfolio manager for the hedge fund of George Soros, the billionaire financier who has bankrolled liberal candidates and causes — and who was depicted as a villain in President-elect Trump’s last campaign ad.\nHe only stayed a year, leaving in September 2004 to start his own hedge fund, Dune Capital Management.\nAs a producer, he has put out films including “American Sniper,” “The Lego Movie” and this summer’s “Suicide Squad.” His latest film, which opened right before Thanksgiving, is called “Rules Don’t Apply.”\nMnuchin joined the President-elect Trump campaign as finance chairman in May, and sources tell CNN he made it clear early that he wanted the Treasury job. He recruited deputies before he was tapped for the job.\nMnuchin has contributed to both Republican and Democratic candidates, including Hillary Clinton’s Senate campaigns and 2008 presidential run. He gave to Barack Obama’s Senate and presidential campaigns and to Charles Schumer, the new Democratic leader in the Senate.\nMnuchin and his brother were sued by the trustee trying to recover money for Bernard Madoff’s victims after his Ponzi scheme unraveled in 2008. They were executors of their mother’s estate, and had withdrawn her investment with Madoff shortly after she died in 2005.\nA court eventually blocked the trustee, Irving Picard, from collecting Mnuchin’s mother’s $3.2 million in profits withdrawn from the Madoff fund long before its collapse.\nMnuchin led the group that bought failed subprime lender IndyMac for pennies on the dollar in 2009, about a year after the FDIC took over the California bank following a run on deposits by customers.\nIndyMac had become a poster child for the risky home loans that brought on the housing crisis and the meltdown in financial markets. The FDIC agreed to assume much of the losses as part of its sale to Mnuchin, who renamed it OneWest.\nBut regulators soon questioned OneWest’s foreclosure practices, which included so-called robo-signings that pushed homeowners into foreclosure without proper review or due process.\nThe bank was one of many that agreed to pay millions in fines to compensate customers. Occupy Los Angeles protesters showed up at Mnuchin’s Bel Air mansion. And this month, two fair housing groups in California filed a complaint with the Department of Housing and Urban Development, accusing the bank of discriminating against minority borrowers during his tenure there.\nMnuchin eventually sold OneWest to CIT Group in 2014 for $3.4 billion and joined CIT as part of the deal. When he left CIT less than two years later, he received a $10.9 million severance package.",

President-elect @realDonaldTrump will pick former Goldman Sachs banker Steven Mnuchin to head the Treasury Department \n— Bret Baier (@BretBaier) November 29, 2016 \nY’all remember when Trump cultists were screaming at Ted Cruz’s wife that she was evil because she had worked with Goldman Sachs? Now it’s a prerequisite to work for Trump!! \nFrom the New York Times: \nFrom 2003 to 2004, Mnuchin worked as chief executive of SFM Capital Management, which the Wall Street Journal reports is backed by Soros. He also worked for Soros Fund Management LLC, according to Bloomberg. \nIsn’t it funny how no conspiracy theory was too stupid or outrageous for Trump supporters to push before he got elected, but now everyone will look away as a former Soros lackey gets in charge of the frickin’ Treasury?!

      "text": "11/29/16 AT 7:06 PM Close \nPresident-elect Donald Trump reportedly is planning to tap his campaign finance chairman to be treasury secretary with the announcement coming as soon as Wednesday. \nThe New York Times reported Trump will nominate financier Steven Terner Mnuchin, 53, to head the Treasury Department, despite his lack of government experience and his ties to Wall Street. If approved by the Senate, he would become the third Goldman Sachs alumnus to serve in the post after Henry R. Paulson (George W. Bush) and Robert E. Rubin (Bill Clinton). \nMnuchin, whose fortune is estimated to exceed $40 million, began his career at Goldman Sachs where his father was a partner, eventually becoming a partner himself, and then created his own hedge fund, Dune Capital Management, in 2002 before becoming a major player in the movie industry where he bankrolled such hits as “X-Men” and “Avatar.” \nHe was part of a group in 2009 that bought defunct mortgage lender IndyMac, changing its name to OneWest. The lender, which was sold to CIT, the country’s biggest small business lender, in 2015, was accused of improperly foreclosing on some borrowers and failing to meet lending targets in minority neighborhoods. \nAmericans for Financial Reform, a nonpartisan, nonprofit coalition of more than 200 groups, reacted to the possible nomination, saying Mnuchin made himself “enormously wealthy by cashing in on the country's financial collapse.” \n“He purchased a bailed-out bank for pennies on the dollar and then aggressively foreclosed on tens of thousands of families. Anyone concerned about Wall Street billionaires rigging the economy should be terrified by the prospect of a Treasury Secretary Mnuchin,\" the group said in a statement. Related Stories Trump, Romney To Meet Tuesday \nMnuchin was an early Trump supporter and has said he agrees with the president-elect’s priorities. He could play a major role in shaping the administration’s economic policies as well as foreign policy on such issues as the Iran nuclear deal and relations with Cuba. \nMnuchin has been married twice and currently is engaged to actress Louise Linton. \nTrump expended much of his campaign rhetoric railing against Goldman Sachs, accusing the investment banking firm of robbing the working class and criticizing Democrat Hillary Clinton for accepting speaking fees. During the primaries, he criticized rival Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, for taking a loan from Goldman Sachs to fund his campaign. \nIn addition to Mnuchin , Trump has ties to other Goldman Sachs figures. His choice for White House strategist, Breitbart head Stephen Bannon, started out in Goldman’s mergers and acquisitions division. Former Goldman Vice President of Private Wealth Management Anthony Scaramucci emerged as a key Trump fundraiser.
