      "text": "Amazon y JD.com establecen una presencia sólida en AWE 2017  36   La 2017 Appliance & Electronics World Expo (AWE) tendrá lugar del 9 al 11 de marzo de 2017 en el Shanghai New International Expo Centre (SNIEC). SHANGHAI , 7 de diciembre de   AWE ha forjado una asociación estratégica con Amazon y JD.com, dos plataformas de e-commerce líderes, y las ha invitado a mostrar más aparatos smart home en la próxima AWE 2017, lo que permitirá a los clientes ver de primera mano marcas reconocidas internacionalmente y su extraordinario desempeño. Organizada por la China Household Electrical Appliances Association, AWE es un importante evento, equivalente a CES e IFA, y su próxima edición adoptará nuevas alturas históricas, expandiéndose a casi 120.000 metros cuadrados de espacio de exposición en sus ocho pabellones. Impulsada por las explosivas demandas de consumidores chinos de productos de valor añadido, Amazon establecerá su presencia por primera vez en AWE 2017, y establecerá una Amazon Life Show de aparatos pequeños y de calidad para el hogar, electrodomésticos de cocina, cuidado de la salud y más. En marzo de 2016, JD.com lanzó una feria de smart home en AWE 2016, con seis áreas de experiencia (incluyendo una cocina independiente, una sala de estar abierta y un área especial para los aparatos del hogar), en la que se mostrarán productos de Siemens, Samsung, Casarte, LG, Midea, Robam, Fotile, TCL, Haier, Panasonic, LeTV, Hisense, Joyoung, Phillips, A.O. Smith , y más. Esto lleví a los consumidores un paso más cerca de las últimas tecnologías. Uno de los principales canales de distribución para consumidores, las plataformas de comercio electrónico, comenzarán a escalar sus esfuerzos mediante la promoción de productos inteligentes de alto nivel y la expansión de su cartera para incluir negocios fronterizos, ofreciendo a los consumidores productos de todo el mundo. Amazon China ha registrado más de 10 millones de pedidos extranjeros desde que comenzó a ofrecer sus servicios transfronterizos en 2014. En la primera mitad de 2016, las ventas de su segmento de compras transfronterizo aumentaron cuatro veces más que el mismo periodo del año anterior. AWE, la exposición de más alto nivel en la industria de los aparatos para el hogar y la electrónica de consumo de China , se ha convertido en una plataforma preferente para los proveedores de e-commerce para hacer promociones offline. Solo tres semanas después de que AWE 2017 se lanzase oficialmente, el 80 % de sus expositores estaba reservado, batiendo el récord del año anterior. AWE está expandiendo su cartera para incluir más marcas internacionales, como ABB, KUKA, Karcher, Tiger, Vitamix, Cuisinart, Omega, Fisher & Paykel, Westinghouse, Vidal Sassoon , BaByliss y Laurastar.

      "text": "Amazon Go Makes Me Want To Checkout Digimarc (Seeking Alpha) \nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ) has unveiled a new concept grocery store, Amazon Go , which bypasses the check-out process in online shopping. The company has not provided any technical details so far; however, terming the latest initiative as a “revolutionary concept,” Bernstein’s Jay Huang said in a report that it is likely “camera-based vision technology.” Cameras To Be The Core Technology \nCameras will play two important roles in stores. Firstly, cameras track the items, including the removal of items from their original position and their replacement back to that position. Secondly, cameras “constantly track the identity of customers, and match each item to an individual customer, without losing track at any moment,” analyst Huang wrote. \nHuang explained the second role is much more difficult than the first because it employs pattern matching as well as real-time location and trajectory tracking. \n“For this reason, we believe although the various sensors (laser displacement, pressure, weight [...]) barcoding and RFID may be supplementary in an Amazon Go store, they are unlikely to be the core, revolutionary part, as those methods are not particularly good at tracking movements,” the analyst stated. \nFacial recognition may not be used, since individual customers can be tracked by their overall characteristics and movements, and this would allow Amazon to stay clear of privacy controversies, Huang added. Employees \nAmazon provided Benzinga with the following details: \"We have at least as many associates as traditional retail store[s].\" \"Amazon Go associates work in both the kitchen and the store, prepping ingredients, making breakfast, lunch, and dinner items, stocking shelves, and helping customers.\" \nAt last check , Amazon shares were down 0.53 percent at $760.66. © 2016 Benzinga.com.

      "text": "Skip in Skip x Embed\nx Share\nThe online giant has revealed its advanced concept for a store utilizing \"Just Walk Out\" technology. Newslook\nA screen shot from a promotional video by Amazon about Amazon Go, it's pick up and go shopping prototype story. (Photo: Amazon)\nSAN FRANCISCO — The Amazon Go grocery store, now in the testing stage in Seattle, has captured the public's attention. At a time of year when many people are standing in long lines to do their holiday shopping, the idea of being able to walk into a store, pick things up, walk out and have everything automatically charged to a credit card sounds like a dream come true.\nBut how, exactly, is Amazon making this happen?\nThe video the Seattle company released online Monday said nothing about the underlying technology beyond some buzz-words: computer vision, deep learning algorithms and sensor fusion.\nBut a patent filed by the company in 2014 and published in 2015 may shed some light on the process, and it looks like it's all about cameras and microphones.\nLots and lots of cameras and microphones. The tech is similar to what's used to allow self-driving cars to navigate the world.\nAccording to the patent, each customer entering the store would be tagged as they entered. In Amazon's video, they tag their smartphone, which contains the Amazon Go app, as they walk in.\nThat then allows the store's surveillance system to identify the customer so that it can track them as they move throughout the space. Cameras pick up images of when they stop in front of shelves, what items they picked up and whether the item stayed in their hand or went back to the shelf.\nAs the patent puts it, \"when the user's hand is removed from the inventory location, one or more images may be captured of the user's hand as it exits the inventory location. Those images may be compared to determine whether a user has picked an item from the inventory location or placed an item in the inventory location.\"\nAn image for the patent which appears to be the basis for the Amazon Go \"pick up and go\" grocery system. (Photo: Amazon)\nThe cameras would even know the customer's skin tone, to determine if it was indeed the hand of the person the system thinks it is.\nAs in, \"image analysis may be performed on the first image to determine a skin tone color of the user's hand and pixels including that color, or a range of colors similar to the identified skin tone color, may be identified to represent the user's hand.\"\nThat could potentially be used to distinguish between two people each reaching for things on adjacent shelves, as skin tone is very individual.\nThis is all hugely, even astoundingly, computing intensive. But it's also exactly what Amazon has become very good at with its Alexa voice-control system. That system sends sound files of spoken commands up to Amazon's cloud computing network, where they are identified, turned into digital commands, answered and then sent back down to the Echo device.\nIn fact, some of that expertise may be explicit in the Amazon Go system, as microphones are also used in the stores to determine where users are by the noises that they make. It even tracks them by noticing the time difference between the audio signals received by each microphone in the store, a kind of reverse echolocation.\nThe system also uses infrared, pressure and load sensors on the shelves that note when items have been picked up and whether they are put back. These sensors also feed into the store's continuous sense of where everything, and everyone, in it are at any moment.\nUSA TODAY\nAmazon just opened a grocery store without a checkout line\nWhile the concept is brilliant, whether or not it works in real life will come down to how much it costs to implement.\n“The challenge is whether you can make it cost-effective. Has Amazon come up with the secret sauce?” said Forrester analyst Brendan Witcher.\nMany in the industry had thought something like this would happen through the use of tiny RFID, or radio-frequency ID, tags. These send out a constant “I am here!” message, allowing the system to track whatever they’re attached to.\n“They’ve come down in price, they’re now only about five cents each. But it’s still pretty labor intensive to RFID tag everything,” said Witcher.\nIt's been suggested for years. In fact, IBM released an ad about a store where you just picked things up and walked out back in 2006, he said.\nBut looking at the patent, it seems as if Amazon’s found a less expensive, more technologically intensive, way to make that work.\nThe power of information\nKnowing who a customer is from the moment they walk through the door, and then tracking everything they do once inside, could be hugely useful to a company, said David Hewitt, an analyst with the consulting firm SapientRazorfish.\n“Think about turning on a digital display that markets to the person who’s in the aisle right then. I know it’s a little Big Brother, but all this data is welcome if it makes the shopping process better,” he said.\nAmazon could also license the technology to other supermarkets. That would be a win-win for Amazon, because it would be selling not only the technology but also the cloud computing power of its AWS cloud services.\nIn the end, whether this is economically viable may not matter as much to Amazon as it would to another company, said Witcher.\nInvestors have been happy to let Amazon lose money quarter after quarter as long as it seems to be moving forward in its technological abilities.\n“The market’s given them free rein to fail. They’re allowed to try interesting — and expensive, things,” he said.\nAnd even if the technology is too pricey to actually implement, Amazon will have done what it does best: “Learn and then apply that new knowledge to whatever makes the most sense,” Witcher said.\n11533 CONNECT TWEET 47 LINKEDIN 6 COMMENT EMAIL MORE //usat.ly/2hetHdA",

      "text": "Brawling Nerds is the theme of Day 4 (Wednesday, Dec. 7) of Amazon’s 12 Days of Deals, with bargains on PCs, video games and 3D printers.\nDell’s Inspiron i3455 all-in-one touchscreen desktop with free shipping is up for $499.99 , a discount of 23% on the regular price of $649.99, the video game Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare is on sale for $49.99 , 38% off the regular price of $79.99; and the LulzBot TAZ 5 Desktop 3D Printer is priced at $1,650 , down 26% from its recent price of $2,248.\n\nAmong other bargains are: an unlocked LG G5 phone with 32 GB memory for $449 (Reg. $649.99); and a World Source Design Rome power recliner, in Rolls Royce black leather, for $2,014 ($2,599).\nAmazon’s 12 Days Of Deals Amazon’s 12 Days of Deals, which kicked off on Dec. 4, is a play on the Christmas carol, “The 12 days of Christmas.” Amazon Prime members get early access by up to several hours depending on the products.\nMicrosoft is running a similar campaign online and in its stores since Dec. 5. Today, select Xbox One titles are on sale for half-price.\nTAZ5 has a rating of 4.1 out of 5 on Amazon, and some users on 3DHubs.com have rated it ahead of other 3D popular 3D printers such as Ultimaker 2 and Makergear, mainly because of reliability, print volume and choice of materials. Some users urge others to buy a commercial slicer software in order to get optimal results.\nThe Colorado firm that makes TAZ 5 advocates open source hardware and open source free software. Consequently, users have the support of a large community. It also enhances user options to adapt and upgrade, giving it an advantage over proprietary models. For example, the modular tool head carriage design allows plug-and-play with different print heads for growing selection of 3D printing filament materials. This model comes with a 0.5 mm nozzle.\nTAZ 5 measures 298 mm x 275 mm x 250 mm (11.7 in x 10.8 in x 9.8 in), allowing good print volume for printing larger items or multiple parts at once.\nThe printer’s aluminum frame is strong and absorbs machine vibrations. Its all-metal hot-end can heat up to 300°C (572°F), and the print bed up to 120°C (248°F).\nFor a fused deposition modeling, or FDM, printer, print quality is rated good even at 75 microns in Z. XY resolution is good too. Users who have problem with the mobile Y-axis printing can get better results with feed rate reduction, according to some users.\nThe post Amazon 12 Days Of Deals: HOT Deals On LulzBot 3d Printer, Dell Inspiron Desktop, LG 5 Mobile appeared first on ValueWalk .\n",

      "text": "'Harry Potter and the Cursed Child' Tops Amazon’s List of 2016 Books It really was magic. Twitter \nUnless you've been living under a rock (or, you know, in a small closet under the stairs) you know that this was the year for Harry Potter . Between the release of the eighth book, the play , and of course, the whole host of new products that come alongside any beloved series, it was a major year for the series that debuted years ago. Though we knew it was popular in 2016, we're now starting to get an idea of just how important the book was: according to Amazon's rankings, Harry Potter and The Cursed Child was actually the #1 bestselling book of the year. \nThe company notes that #1 selling book of 2016 was Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, Parts 1 & 2, Special Rehearsal Edition Script by J.K. Rowling, Jack Thorne, and John Tiffany. It was also the bestselling book in the Kids & Teens category, and topped the lists for both the Most Gifted and Most Wished For books of the year. All of this is particularly remarkable when you consider that it's categorically a fiction if not young adult novel — and written as a script, at that! To cross genres and audiences the way it has is nothing short of exceptional. \nFollowing Harry Potter on the list were a whole slew of titles aimed at older audiences, including When Breath Becomes Air by Paul Kalanithi, The Whistler by John Grisham, and The Last Mile by David Baldacci. Notably, #10 on the list was Diary of a Wimpy Kid, which stands apart as the only children's book on the list beyond Harry Potter . \nSo there you have it: the most popular reads of the year. If there's anyone in your life who hasn't gotten their hands on Harry, (and, statistically at least, they're probably few and far between) it seems you just got the best idea for a last minute holiday gift.",

      "text": "  \nLOS ANGELES,   Detecting Deceit , released this past month in all formats by Amazon, discusses a threat to our teenagers that the National Center for Victims of Crime (NCVC) has dubbed 'the grooming dynamic.' This issue is on the cusp of becoming part of the global consciousness, and none too soon, as the only defense against 'grooming' is wide spread knowledge of what types of behavior to look for in victims and predators alike. \nAccording to the NCVC, perpetrators of sexual abuse may groom potential victims and their caregivers by gaining their trust and breaking down their defenses over time. Grooming helps the offender gain access to the victim and set up a relationship grounded in secrecy so the crime is less likely to be discovered. \nSexual exploitation of teens is becoming a worldwide plague. Nearly 70% of all reported sexual assaults (including assaults on adults) occur against children ages 17 and under ( Howard N. Snyder PhD, Nat'l Center for Juvenile Justice, 2000 ). One in four girls are sexually assaulted by the age of 18 ( ref. NCVC ), and those are just reported statistics. In the case of 'grooming,' the victims themselves often don't realize they're victims because the process is so slow and calculated. \nDetecting Deceit , written by husband and wife team Eric and Olivia Dupree, is the true account of a family victimized by this new kind of predator that we, as a society, have yet to fully recognize or understand. The authors provide a valuable perspective that can serve parents, teens and the community at large. In the tech-infused environment of 2016, our teens are more prone than ever before to this type of predator because they most often come from within the family's social circle (90% of sexual assaults come from a trusted adult, ref. NCVC) . Detecting Deceit provides an increased ability to detect the signs of these predators, and their victims, among us. \n\"My eyes have been opened... if I had the authority I would make this required reading for anyone involved in middle and high school education...\" Helen M.

      "text": "Innovation GE's lamp of the future is the first embedded with Amazon's Alexa Voice Service The cool factor of smart home technology goes up a notch with the debut of a new voice-controlled table lamp from GE. By Teena Maddox | December 7, 2016, 6:59 AM PST \nThe futuristic glow of GE's new LED table lamp embedded with Amazon's Alexa. Image: GE Lighting \nOn Wednesday, GE debuted the first stand-alone LED table lamp embedded with Amazon Alexa Voice Service. The futuristic-looking lamp has a modern vibe, with a glowing LED-filled circular tube on a small gray base. \nThe voice-controlled table lamp has microphones and a speaker, so that a homeowner can simply say \"lights on\" or \"lights off\" to control the lighting, as well as give it additional Alexa commands, such as asking about the latest headlines or asking about the weather. Consumers will be able to pre-order the lamp in early 2017, with delivery by the second quarter of the year. \n\"The way it works essentially is it's a table lamp. It has the Alexa Voice Service embedded inside. You could use it very much as you might use an Echo or Dot today in any room in your home to activate the Alexa service. At the same time you get a wonderful light source, a table lamp,\" said Jeff Patton, general manager of Connected Home Products for GE Lighting. \nSEE: Amazon Alexa will now talk to GE's connected appliances in smart home (TechRepublic) \nGE began developing the product earlier this year because the smart home market continues to grow, with a three-fold increase expected by 2020, said Tom Stimac, chief innovation officer for GE Lighting. \n\"What we look at in a lot of the reviews and work that we do, the consumer wants a seamless experience, they want that ultimate experience inside a house. As we started looking at a lot of different ways of accomplishing that experience, a couple of things came to us. Lighting is in every room of the house, whether it's the pantry, kitchen, bathroom, or closet. There's almost no space in your home that doesn't have some type of lighting in it,\" Stimac said. More about Innovation Read more \n\"People are wanting to get away from apps. They're really trying to understand how not to always have their phone on them. They want to understand how things can work for them. They say, 'how do I walk into a room and the lights just go on?' The first component of that overall experience that we've seen materialize is voice. Everyone has their own voice. It's something you use anyway. You can walk into a space and say, 'lights on, lights off,'\" Stimac said. \nPatton said this is just the first of what will be many smart home products that GE develops. \"Our goals are around delivering simplification of experience for people,\" Patton said. \"As we've used that as our key motivator out there, that's one reason why we chose voice as a key controlling element as we roll forward. There will be different features in months and quarters and years to come.\" \nAs for the price, Patton said they haven't finalized it yet, but they are aiming for a cost close to the Amazon Echo. The Amazon Echo retails for $179.99. \nStimac said new smart home products will begin rolling out in the first and second quarters of 2017. \nLighting is an easy entry point for those who want to have a smarter home, just as it's a common entry point for municipalities adding smart city technology. \n\"Lighting is something we use day in and day out, and when you look at how you use it and when you want to use it, there is a lot of basic automation built in already, with Christmas lights going on and off outside of a home. The big thing we can't underestimate is it's relatively easy to install or uninstall,\" Stimac said. \"It's the same thing with an overall city. If you have a pole somewhere and you're taking a light off, and putting a light on, it's one of the easier things on the operational side of a business that you can do.\" \nAnother factor that must be considered is the appeal of having the latest technology. Smart lighting adds the cool factor, Stimac said, but in an accessible manner. \n\"I think a lot of people hear a lot about   and self-driving cars that they know they can't grasp because it's outside what they do on a day-to-day basis. But this is within the overall scope of what the consumer can do, and it makes them feel like they're actually pushing themselves forward,\" Stimac said. Three takeaways  : GE Lighting has created an LED table lamp, the first-ever light source embedded with Amazon's Alexa. The market for smart home products is expected to grow three-fold by 2020. This is the first of what GE expects to be many smart home products that they will develop, with others debuting as early as the first quarter of 2017.

The Fitbit Alta , one of the best fitness trackers on the market right now, is available on Amazon for only $84.96. Not only is that a savings of $44.99, that also puts the Alta at the lowest price we’ve ever seen.\nThe Alta is available in three sizes – Small, Large and X-Large – and comes in five different color options. You can pick up the Black, Blue, Plum or Teal models for the discounted price, though you’ll have to spend an extra $65 if you want the fancy Gold/Black model.\nIt’s worth noting that this deal is only available for today, December 7, so you’ll need to act fast if you want to save some moolah.\nSee also: Fitbit Alta review March 29, 2016 Personally, the Alta is one of my favorite fitness trackers. Not only is it one of Fitbit’s best looking wearables, it’s also super accurate, has a battery that will last about five days, and, oh yeah, it’s really affordable.\nInterested in picking one up for yourself? Head to the Amazon link below for the details!\nBuy now from Amazon ",

      "text": "0 Amazon Offering $100 Gift Card with Oculus Rift Purchases for Today Only \nVirtual reality entered the mainstream this year with the release of VR headsets across consoles and PC, and now those looking to jump in to the world of Oculus Rift can do so with a special, limited-time offer from Amazon. \nAmazon is currently hosting a deal for today only on Oculus Rift headsets that provides purchasers with a free $100 Amazon gift card. While the headset itself is still at its $599 MSRP, the deal still offers a nice bonus for purchases of the (pricey) headset, which you can use toward the newly-released Oculus Touch controllers or other items on Amazon as you see fit. \nThe Oculus Rift headset released in March of this year alongside competitors such as HTC Vive and Sony’s PlayStation VR, with the headset coming in more of a mid-range price compared to the $799 Vive and PlayStation VR’s $399 price point. Alongside the headset, this month also saw the release of the Oculus Touch controllers for more intuitive motion controls and feedback while playing VR-compatible titles. \nOculus Rift is available now for PC, and you can click here to check out the deal from Amazon while it is available for today only.",

      "text": "'Cursed Child' Top Selling Book at Amazon in 2016 By John Maher | Dec 07, 2016 Amazon has released its annual list marking its best-selling books of 2016 , best-selling kids and teens books of 2016, as well as the \"most gifted\" and \"most wished for\" books of the year. J.K. Rowling, Jack Thorne, and John Tiffany's Harry Potter and the Cursed Child: Parts 1 and 2 swept the competition, and was the top-selling book in all four categories. It is the first time a play has made the top 20 bestsellers list. In the main category, Paul Kalanithi's When Breath Becomes Air was #2, and in kids and teens, Jeff Kinney's Double Down , the 11th installment in his Diary of a Wimpy Kid series, was #2. Kinney has now made the kids and teens list four years in a row. “This year’s bestselling list showcases the variety of Amazon readers’ tastes, from literary fiction to thrillers to memoirs,” Amazon senior book editor Chris Schluep said in a statement. He added: “The power of Potter is still strong, and readers of all ages can’t get enough of Hogwarts. Harry Potter and the Cursed Child was the most anticipated book of the year, breaking pre-order records months before its release.” In order to be eligible for the list, books must have published in first edition in 2016. The list reflects both print and Kindle purchases. The top 20 best-selling books of 2016 overall are: 1. Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, Parts 1 & 2, Special Rehearsal Edition Script by J.K. Rowling, Jack Thorne and John Tiffany2. When Breath Becomes Air by Paul Kalanithi3. The Whistler by John Grisham4. The Last Mile (Amos Decker series) by David Baldacci5.

      "title": "‘It’s fun!’ Microsoft vet Bob Muglia speaks out on competing with Amazon, his first CEO post, and his stint in Redmond",
      "text": "Bob Muglia at re:Invent 2016, Las Vegas. (GeekWire Photo / Dan Richman) It takes a certain amount of courage to compete with public-cloud giant Amazon Web Services — especially when your own product runs exclusively on AWS. But that isn’t fazing Bob Muglia, a 23-year Microsoft vet who in June 2014 stepped into his first C-suite job as CEO of data warehouse-maker Snowflake .\n“We compete and we’re good partners at the same time,” Muglia said. “Don’t forget, AWS sells compute and storage time whether someone’s running Redshift (its own data warehouse) or Snowflake, so our success is their success, to some extent.”\nMuglia, now 53, shared his candid views on that relationship, on Azure’s shortcomings and on what drove him to leave Microsoft during a one-on-one interview with GeekWire at AWS’s re:Invent user conference in Las Vegas.\nCoopetition with Amazon Web Services Snowflake, a San Mateo, Calif., startup founded in August 2012, makes a data warehouse that competes directly with AWS’s Redshift. Data warehouses keep copies of structured data (in rows and tables, such as relational databases) or, in some cases, semi-structured data (JSON files, logs, mobile-device output and Internet-of-Things sensor output) and analyze it to reveal unsuspected connections and patterns. They’re old technology, at least as offered by companies including Oracle, Neteeza, Teradata and Vertica, in Muglia’s view.\n“Our approach is different from those and from Redshift, which is built using the architecture all the others also use, called ‘ shared nothing ,'” Muglia said. “They all involve a set of compute nodes closely coupled to data, working together as a cluster. But for any cluster, you will eventually run out of capacity, and adding new clusters requires creating new ones, copying and data and managing it. It’s very difficult for companies to do that.”\nSnowflake, in contrast, scales easily, he said. It uses AWS’s S3 as its sole storage mechanism and has a three-layer architecture: storage on the bottom, compute in the middle and service (management) on top.\n“When a Snowflake cluster runs out of capacity, we can instantiate another cluster right next to it, accessing the same data at the same time, and basically continue to scale,” Muglia said. Conventional data warehouses “can’t be turned into what we’ve created, which we call multi-cluster shared-data architecture.” Snowflake also allows running relational queries and updates on stored data, a feature missing from many open-source competitors, he said. And its ability to process semi-structured data is a feature most data warehouses omit.\nSnowflake runs only an AWS, Muglia said, because “S3 is such a sophisticated service. Azure’s blob storage is not as sophisticated, so it would be a technical challenge to run on Azure. This is one of the areas where Amazon is just ahead.”\nMuglia didn’t hesitate to bash Azure, in the process taking a swipe at himself.\n“We obviously compete with the cloud vendors, for example with companies that were using (Microsoft’s) SQL Server (relational database) and are looking at Redshift, Azure, Snowflake,” he said. “When we have those (as competitors), we tend to do very well, because Azure’s products are very deficient, particularly Azure Data Warehouse. Redshift is a much better product, which I can tell you because (Azure Data Warehouse) is technology based on technology that was built by my team.”\nAWS “has done a great job of supporting us,” Muglia said. “We’re very happy with them. They helped sponsor our recent tour of 10 cities. Their sales reps come out on our sales calls under a program Amazon has put in place. But we compete for customers. We talk about our benefits and they talk about theirs.”\nThe data warehouse market is worth fighting for. For conventional products alone, IDC values it at $14-$15 billion, “but the cloud data warehouse market will be much bigger, because the cloud will be larger and you can do a lot more in the cloud,” Muglia said. “All the legacy-technology (end-user) companies will move to the cloud eventually. ”\nMicrosoft ‘missed the shift in the industry’ For 23 years, through 2011, Muglia labored in the engineering arm of Microsoft, at various times building SQL Server, running developer operations, the server group and Office, then running Windows and the entire server and tools business. In the 2000s, the early days of open-source software, “I got to feeling there was a lot more we should be doing with the open-source ecosystem, but Steve (Ballmer, then CEO) was well-quoted as calling it cancer,” Muglia recalled. “Microsoft had a policy that was very protective of its intellectual property, and I always felt that was very detrimental, because we weren’t participating in the ecosystem.\n“And Steve was, like, ‘No, we need to hang onto this, because Linux will be competing with Windows.’ It almost got to the point where we were making threats that people who were using open source needed to license it. And I was just, like, ‘This is broken.'”\nBallmer and Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates “were in sync on this,” Muglia said. “But the world changed and they hadn’t. They were operating in the business model of the 1980s, not the model of the 2000s. It’s true that by retaining that intellectual property, Microsoft has a $3-billion patent-royalty business right now. Whoop-de-doo. That’s not going to move the mark, yet they missed the shift in the industry because of it.”\nUnder current CEO Satya Nadella, Microsoft “is positioned to do much better, because one of the first things he did is reverse policies,” Muglia continued.\nBut by the time Nadella was appointed CEO, in February 2014, Muglia had left for Juniper Networks, where he ran the software group. Flat growth, budget cuts and quarter after quarter of layoffs proved discouraging, so he began searching for something new.\nAvoiding the daily ‘BS’ “My time at Juniper helped me see that the transition to the cloud was going to be a major tidal-wave disruption and that the companies I call old technology — HP, Dell, Symantec, SAP, Cisco, Oracle — were going to struggle as a result,” he said. “I realized that most of the innovation was happening in smaller companies. And for the remainder of my career, I wanted to build something that matters. I was looking for a big market, a major disruption, something cloud focused. And I love databases. I heard about Snowflake through Sutter Hill, an early investor and builder of the company. When I heard what they’re doing technically, I recognized it could really work. So essentially, I was hired by the founders of Snowflake.”\nWhat’s it like being a CEO for the first time?\n“It’s fun!” Muglia said. “People say it’s a huge amount of work to lead a startup, and it’s true. But it’s rewarding because it makes a difference. At Microsoft or Juniper, a large percentage of what I did every day was BS — just stuff you had to do to make the business go forward, just overhead. There’s no overhead at Snowflake. Everything you do is focused on helping the team to grow, or improving the product, the sales process, the marketing.”\nHis biggest challenge, he said, is “scaling, scaling, scaling. In particular, hiring engineers is one of my top challenges.”\nTo that end, Snowflake is looking to open a Seattle office with 10-15 people initially, because “it’s a very strong market for systems talent, with the history of Microsoft and Amazon.” The search for real estate in Seattle is set to begin immediately, he said. “I hope to grow it to be a a material office over time.”\nFor now, Muglia is commuting between Seattle, where he and his wife own a Mercer Island house, and San Mateo, where they own a condo. “My driver’s license is issued by California and my wife’s is from Washington,” he said.",

      "title": "How Amazon's line-less grocery service would really work",
      "text": "SAN FRANCISCO — The Amazon Go grocery store, now in the testing stage in Seattle, has captured the public's attention. At a time of year when many people are standing in long lines to do their holiday shopping, the idea of being able to walk into a store, pick things up, walk out and have everything automatically charged to a credit card sounds like a dream come true. But how, exactly, is Amazon making this happen?\nThe video the Seattle company released online Monday said nothing about the underlying technology beyond some buzz-words: computer vision, deep learning algorithms and sensor fusion.\nBut a patent filed by the company in 2014 and published in 2015 may shed some light on the process, and it looks like it's all about cameras and microphones.\nLots and lots of cameras and microphones. The tech is similar to what's used to allow self-driving cars to navigate the world.\nAccording to the patent, each customer entering the store would be tagged as they entered. In Amazon's video, they tag their smartphone, which contains the Amazon Go app, as they walk in.\nThat then allows the store's surveillance system to identify the customer so that it can track them as they move throughout the space. Cameras pick up images of when they stop in front of shelves, what items they picked up and whether the item stayed in their hand or went back to the shelf.\nAs the patent puts it, \"when the user's hand is removed from the inventory location, one or more images may be captured of the user's hand as it exits the inventory location. Those images may be compared to determine whether a user has picked an item from the inventory location or placed an item in the inventory location.\"\nAn image for the patent which appears to be the basis for the Amazon Go \"pick up and go\" grocery system. (Photo: Amazon)\nThe cameras would even know the customer's skin tone, to determine if it was indeed the hand of the person the system thinks it is.\nAs in, \"image analysis may be performed on the first image to determine a skin tone color of the user's hand and pixels including that color, or a range of colors similar to the identified skin tone color, may be identified to represent the user's hand.\"\nThat could potentially be used to distinguish between two people each reaching for things on adjacent shelves, as skin tone is very individual.\nThis is all hugely, even astoundingly, computing intensive. But it's also exactly what Amazon has become very good at with its Alexa voice-control system. That system sends sound files of spoken commands up to Amazon's cloud computing network, where they are identified, turned into digital commands, answered and then sent back down to the Echo device.\nIn fact, some of that expertise may be explicit in the Amazon Go system, as microphones are also used in the stores to determine where users are by the noises that they make. It even tracks them by noticing the time difference between the audio signals received by each microphone in the store, a kind of reverse echolocation.\nThe system also uses infrared, pressure and load sensors on the shelves that note when items have been picked up and whether they are put back. These sensors also feed into the store's continuous sense of where everything, and everyone, in it are at any moment.\nUSA TODAY\nAmazon just opened a grocery store without a checkout line\nWhile the concept is brilliant, whether or not it works in real life will come down to how much it costs to implement.\n“The challenge is whether you can make it cost-effective. Has Amazon come up with the secret sauce?” said Forrester analyst Brendan Witcher.\nMany in the industry had thought something like this would happen through the use of tiny RFID, or radio-frequency ID, tags. These send out a constant “I am here!” message, allowing the system to track whatever they’re attached to.\n“They’ve come down in price, they’re now only about five cents each. But it’s still pretty labor intensive to RFID tag everything,” said Witcher.\nIt's been suggested for years. In fact, IBM released an ad about a store where you just picked things up and walked out back in 2006, he said.\nBut looking at the patent, it seems as if Amazon’s found a less expensive, more technologically intensive, way to make that work.\nThe power of information\nKnowing who a customer is from the moment they walk through the door, and then tracking everything they do once inside, could be hugely useful to a company, said David Hewitt, an analyst with the consulting firm SapientRazorfish.\n“Think about turning on a digital display that markets to the person who’s in the aisle right then. I know it’s a little Big Brother, but all this data is welcome if it makes the shopping process better,” he said.\nAmazon could also license the technology to other supermarkets. That would be a win-win for Amazon, because it would be selling not only the technology but also the cloud computing power of its AWS cloud services.\nIn the end, whether this is economically viable may not matter as much to Amazon as it would to another company, said Witcher.\nInvestors have been happy to let Amazon lose money quarter after quarter as long as it seems to be moving forward in its technological abilities.\n“The market’s given them free rein to fail. They’re allowed to try interesting — and expensive, things,” he said.\nAnd even if the technology is too pricey to actually implement, Amazon will have done what it does best: “Learn and then apply that new knowledge to whatever makes the most sense,” Witcher said.",

      "text": "Here are just 6 reasons why Amazon’s “Good Girls Revolt” should not be cancelled Last week, Amazon Studios shocked subscribers when it cancelled critically acclaimed series Good Girls Revolt after just one season. The series — which is a fictionalized version of the landmark 1970 lawsuit in which 46 female employees of Newsweek sued the magazine for gender discrimination — is based on a 2012 book of the same name by Lynn Povich, one of the leading complainants in the suit. \nThe cancellation came as a shock to many, not just because they were fans of the series, but because of its popularity amongst Amazon viewers . Data commissioned by Sony TV, the production company behind the series, found the series to have an 80% completion rate, which is higher than many of Amazon’s most beloved series. \nAmazon With latest reports citing Amazon Studios head Roy Price’s disinterest in the series as the primary factor for the cancellation, there seems to be a serious underlying gender problem. While it appears that Sony is looking for another distributor, let’s take a moment to reflect on the impact of Good Girls Revolt and its importance for women and men now more than ever. \nHere are just a few reasons (beyond popularity) why Good Girls Revolt deserves another season . \n1. The series takes place around the turn of 1970, but is still incredibly relevant in 2016. \nAmazon The lawsuit takes place 46 years ago, but will still resonant with so many women. We continue to live in a time when women are denied opportunity because of their sex, not to mention most still make less than their male counterparts. We can connect with Patti and the women of News of the Week because, underneath their retro garb and Creedence Clearwater Revival records, they’re facing similar problems to ours. If there’s one thing this show has taught us, it’s that 46 years may have passed but we still have much more ground to cover. \n2. The women are complex and flawed (and the acting is superb). \nAmazon While they’re our champions and our heroes in taking on this difficult task, the women of News of the Week are complex and multilayered. Patti Robinson (Genevieve Angelson), Cindy Reston (Erin Darke), and Jane Hollander (Anna Camp) don’t seamlessly pull together their lawsuit. They engage in potentially damaging office relationships and struggle to pull together enough support from the women of the office. \nThere are also times when they are selfish and unaware of their own privilege, like Jane and her wealth, and Patti and Cindy not understanding their privilege as white women while they try to recruit the only three black women in their office to join the cause. Their portrayal is made even better because they are flawed and real. \n3. It’s a show about gender discrimination without pointing fingers at men. \nAmazon Good Girls Revolt doesn’t cast men as malicious villains actively seeking to act as the foils to their female colleagues. Doug Rhodes (Hunter Parrish) is the reporter to Patti’s researcher and her on-again, off-again boyfriend who wants to understand Patti’s point of view but struggles to understand his privilege as a man . He loves Patti and in theory, wants her to follow her dreams to become a reporter but just does not (and in many ways, simply cannot) understand the lack of opportunity she has as a woman in a male-dominated world, let alone workforce. \nSimilarly, Finn Woodbridge (Chris Diamantopoulos), News of the Week ’s Editor at Large wants to modernize the magazine but can’t shake his sexist “boys club” newsroom habits . While some of the men do abhorrent things, most of the male characters seem to consider their female colleagues as partners and friends without actually understanding the gross inequalities as anything other than journalistic tradition. These guys aren’t bad people, they just have yet to reconcile what it means to be straight white men , which would be really interesting to explore in future seasons. \n\n4. It’s a show for women of all generations. \nAmazon My sisters and I love watching the show because it makes us feel empowered and it inspires us to speak up and act on moments of injustice. It reminds us that we’re not alone in our frustrations with gender inequality and makes us realize that change is possible. At the same time, it’s incredible to watch the show and talk about it with our mom, who grew up during the ‘70s. Sure, she was a bit younger than Patti, Jane, and Cindy, but she experienced the same lack of opportunities despite intellectual abilities and drive. She remembers the sexist comments and profound male arrogance that made up her regular work environment. \nSpecifically, this show offers young women a chance to learn and build on the women’s movement that came before them, while simultaneously reminding older (or middle-aged) women why it is important to continue fighting and not become complacent. \n5. There is so much more to be explored both in terms of gender and politics. Amazon The series centers around the lawsuit, but the show does an incredible job weaving in real-life events and stories within narrative. It touched on the complexities of the Vietnam War and veteran struggles back home. It references the added struggle of fitting into the office environment for a woman of color in the working world, leaving the opportunity to revisit the storyline in later seasons. The first season also featured stories that centered around illegal abortions and potential unwanted pregnancies . The point is, there is SO much left to be covered. \n6. This series is essentially an ode to the power of women. Amazon It’s impossible to not feel empowered watching the show. This show was created by a woman, based on a book by a woman, and is centered around women being all-around badasses. In addition to the female dominated cast, the number of women working behind the scenes on the series is almost unheard of. In the 10-episode first season, six episodes were directed by women and women made up half of the credited writers on staff. In an industry where women make up such a small percentage of showrunners, directors, producers, and writers, Good Girls Revolt is breaking barriers in a multitude of ways. \nWithout rehashing the entirety of the past year, 2016 was a really tough year to be a woman . Good Girls Revolt was a beacon of hope for many women looking to be inspired. With or without a second season, Good Girls Revolt meant a lot for women in 2016. This series deserves to find a new home because it is telling a history that can’t and shouldn’t be forgotten. \nThe post Here are just 6 reasons why Amazon’s “Good Girls Revolt” should not be cancelled appeared first on HelloGiggles .",

      "text": "With Amazon seemingly on the cusp of complete world domination, it came as no surprise to see the retail giant expand its streaming operation last month with Music Unlimited. And while the service offers 40 million tracks, nifty playlists and that all-important collaboration with its Echo speaker and voice assistant Alexa, it did miss out one thing that may have kept you tethered to that Spotify or Apple Music subscription. So it took a few weeks to drop, but Amazon has today launched a further subscription for those who are looking to get their parents involved. The Family Plan will allow up to six users to stream content, costing users £15 a month or a lower overall lump rate of £149 if you happen to be part of the company's special Prime club. Related: Amazon just made it a whole lot easier to ditch your Spotify subscription Of course, while this means Amazon has caught up to its rivals in terms of what it offers, the price you pay is pretty much the same across the board — especially when it comes to family plans. Both Spotify and Apple Music offer this same usage limit for the same price. The incentive to join Music Unlimited, though, is that you'll pay less if you dive deep on Prime or Echo/Echo Dot. Members will only pay £8 a month for the platform, while this drops to £4 for use on either of the intelligent speakers. ",

(GeekWire Photo / Nat Levy) As an online retail giant, Amazon can use its engineering prowess and the vast capabilities of the digital world to track and analyze how customers use its site.\nSo it’s only natural that the company, in its first brick-and-mortar convenience store, would want to create a real-world version of the same thing.\nThe new Amazon Go store logs customers in when they walk through the door, knows instantly when they pick an item up from the shelf, automatically tallies what they put in their carts or shopping bags, uses past purchases to improve their shopping experience, and automatically charges their accounts when they walk out — no need for checkout lines — making it nearly frictionless to buy something.\nIn short, it’s a physical manifestation of Amazon.com.\nThe 1,800-square-foot store is also a new test of our willingness to trade privacy for convenience in the real world. We already leave digital footprints online. Are we ready for an e-commerce system to follow us down the aisle at the neighborhood market?\nThat’s one of the fundamental questions to be answered by the new store, unveiled by the company this week in its hometown of Seattle.\nFor now, Amazon Go is just for Amazon employees, as the company prepares for a public opening early next year. Amazon explained the basics in the video above and an online FAQ . But past patent filings by Amazon engineers and executives , some of whom ended up leading the Amazon Go team, go into much greater detail about their vision for a new type of store.\nA store full of sensors \nFor starters, their vision involves a wide array of sensors.\nThis diagram appears in a pair of related patents by Amazon executives, which describe a variety of high-tech methods of tracking products, employees and customers through a facility such as a distribution center or a retail store. Here is the description of this chart from one of the patent filings.\n“Generally, the materials handling facility 200 may include one or more image capture devices, such as cameras 208. For example, one or more cameras 208 may be positioned in locations of the materials handling facility 200 so that images of locations within the materials handling facility can be captured. In some implementations, the image capture devices 208 may be positioned overhead, such as on the ceiling, to capture images of users and/or locations within the materials handling facility. In addition, in some implementations, one or more cameras 208 may be positioned on or inside of inventory locations. For example, a series of cameras 208 may be positioned on external portions of the inventory locations and positioned to capture images of users and/or the location surrounding the inventory location. Likewise, one or more cameras 208 may be positioned within the inventory locations to capture images of items stored in the inventory locations and/or images of objects (e.g., a user’s hand, items) moving into and/or out of the inventory locations. Cameras may also be positioned at or near transition areas to capture images of users as they enter or pass through the transition area.”\nAnother diagram from the patent filing goes into greater detail.\n\n“Generally, the inventory management system 150 may include input components 311, output components 301 and computing resource(s) 203. The input components 311 may include an image capture device 308 (e.g., camera), microphone 314, antenna 316, sensor (not shown), scale (not shown), light curtain (not shown), a volume displacement sensor (not shown) or any other component that is capable of receiving input about the surrounding environment, from the user of the portable device and/or from the portable device. The output components 301 may include a projector 310, a portable device 306, a display 312, an antenna 316, a radio (not shown), speakers 313 and/or any other component that is capable of providing output.”\nThe filing explains the practical benefits of deploying this system of sensors and data in a retail store or a distribution center.\n“For example,” it says, “if the inventory management system cannot determine if the picked item is a bottle of ketchup or a bottle of mustard, the inventory management system may consider past purchase history and/or what items the user has already picked from other inventory locations. For example, if the user historically has only picked/purchased ketchup, that information may be used to confirm that the user has likely picked ketchup from the inventory location.”\nThe filing also outlines how the system could follow users through the facility.\n“For example, a camera may capture an image of the user that is processed using facial recognition to identify the user. In some implementations, one or more input devices may collect data that is used to identify the user when the user enters the materials handling facility. The position of the user may also be monitored as the user moves about the materials handling facility. When the position of the user enters or passes through a transition area, the identity of the user is known because the position of the user and the identity of the user has been maintained.”\nAnother portion of the filing explains how the system could capture an image of someone’s hand as it crosses the plane of a shelf, analyzing the skin color to help identify the person’s hand, and determine whether the person was removing or placing an item on the shelf.\nOf course, this is just a patent filing. It’s not clear which of these approaches the company will be using in the new Amazon store, and which might be reserved for use in an Amazon distribution center. Also unclear are the extent of the customer tracking technology being used in Amazon Go, and the related privacy policies and practices. Amazon declined GeekWire’s request to try out the store this week.\nAmazon SVP Steve Kessel However, the gist of the patent filing matches the Amazon Go FAQ : “Our checkout-free shopping experience is made possible by the same types of technologies used in self-driving cars: computer vision, sensor fusion, and deep learning. Our Just Walk Out technology automatically detects when products are taken from or returned to the shelves and keeps track of them in a virtual cart. When you’re done shopping, you can just leave the store. Shortly after, we’ll charge your Amazon account and send you a receipt.”\nTwo of the inventors listed on the latest version of patent filing, Dilip Kumar and Gianna Puerini , have updated their LinkedIn bios to note that they are Amazon vice presidents. The third inventor on the latest patent filing, Steve Kessel, is an Amazon senior vice president who returned from a sabbatical last year to lead a “super secret” project , now believed to be Amazon’s high-tech physical retail initiatives.\nA new frontier for privacy So who cares if the store’s technology follows you through the aisles? We asked a variety of technology and retail experts whether privacy concerns about Amazon’s approach are likely to create pushback, either in customer acceptance or regulation. Or is it already too late for that?\n“It may be too late for that, at least among the younger demographics, although, on the whole, Millennials haven’t shown much concern about privacy issues to date,” said Tom Caporaso , CEO of Clarus Commerce , in an email. “Grocery purchases are also less likely to cause concern than, say, pharmacy purchases might, so consumers could very well choose to use the technology in some places but not others.”\nALSO READ: The end of grocery checkers? Amazon’s high-tech store points to the future of physical retail Larry Arnstein , vice president of business development and solutions at Seattle-based RFID technology company Impinj , pointed out one of the realities of the digital economy: “We tend to be willing to give up information to get good service,” he said.\nOne area where the store could help Amazon is in product recommendations, said Nick Manzo , the Global Omnichannel Lead of product information network 1WorldSync .\n“Because the company would know exactly what consumers picked up and put back, or even the walking patterns of customers in store, Amazon would have a whole new set of consumer data to add to targeted promotions and ads,” Manzo said. “For some consumers, this may be a layer of intrusion that sparks a conversation on privacy issues, but for many, the difference in convenience may be worth it.”",

      "text": "Amazon Just Launched the Supermarket of the Future (and Your Dreams) December 7, 2016 Share on Facebook image/Amazon \nIf being stuck in line at the supermarket with just one item behind a customer with a filled-to-the-top cart gives you panic attacks, Amazon has some exciting news. \nEarlier this week, the online retail giant released a video for a brick and mortar convenience store its calling Amazon Go. And it’s the shopping experience of everyone’s dreams. No lines. Ever. \nThe flagship 1,800 square-foot supermarket of the future is located in Seattle, where Amazon is based. \n“It’s clearly a sign that Amazon sees a big opportunity in revolutionizing the staid traditions of Main Street commerce,” reports the Seattle Times. \nUsing a mobile app, Amazon Go shoppers check-in upon entering the store—kind of like entering a subway station through a turnstile or using a phone at airport security check-in. Then, once inside the store, the app automatically identifies the items being purchased (kind of like those library book check-outs). Then, you walk out and Amazon charges you after you’ve left the store. \nNo checkout aisle, no putting items into carts with the one broken wheel only to have to take them back out of the cart a few minutes later and pile them onto the little conveyor belt and then back into the cart while the cashier asks you what kind of apple your Crapaudine beets are. \nAmazon has aptly dubbed the (r)evolutionary concept “Just Walk Out Technology.” It relies on RFID and sensors (and a little Jetsons inspo) to identify the merchandise you’re stuffing right into your bags, purse, underwear. Go for it, right? And no one will care now that you have your period, btw. Or a chocolate addiction. \nAnd, just like the self-checkout registers at most major supermarkets these days, there’s likely to be errors that occur—but surely not nearly as much of a hassle as spending 45 minutes in line at checkout and being forced to make small talk with the cashiers while the person in line behind you keeps accidentally banging your heels with their cart. \nYes, the concept may kill those register area impulse item purchases and magazine sales. But we’re guessing the technology will actually allow for much more creative merchandising within the stores, something that could bode better for brands (and retailers) compromised by traditional supermarket navigation. \nGrocery shopping online with services like Instacart, Thrive Market, and Amazon Fresh is gaining in popularity, as is the booming meal kit delivery trend, and Amazon Go is, in theory at least, the best of both worlds: the anonymity and swiftness of online shopping married with the tactile experience of shopping the aisles, seeing and touching the food, particularly fresh fruits and vegetables or grab-and-go items. It’s the convenience of the future meets the quaintness of the past, presumably with all of the deliciousness of both. Find Jill on Twitter and Instagram  ",

      "text": "EMAIL BY Alison Thoet December 7, 2016 at 1:13 PM EST The sign for the Amazon Go brick-and-mortar grocery store without lines or checkout counters, is pictured in Seattle Washington, U.S. December 5, 2016. Photo by Jason Redmond/REUTERS \nAmazon forayed into the brick and mortar grocery industry Monday by testing its first convenience store, Amazon Go . But the high-tech, small-scale market could drastically change the way people shop and eventually eliminate the need for millions of workers, industry experts predict. \nThe first Amazon Go location is situated in Seattle and is only available to Amazon employees until early 2017. It looks like a typical small grocery store with one thing missing–cashiers. \nAmazon Go has no cash registers and no lines because customers do not have to check out. Instead, they check into the store using an Amazon Go app on their smartphones. Sensors placed around the store detect what customers take off the shelves, and the company automatically charges their established Amazon accounts when they leave. It’s like shoplifting, except you pay for stuff as you walk out of the store. \nAmazon said it aimed to “push the boundaries of computer vision and machine learning to create a store where customers could simply take what they want and go.” The company has not disclosed the details of its proprietary technology, but experts in the field say it builds on past developments. \n“The application is new,” Wolfgang Lehmacher, director of supply chain and transport industries at the World Economic Forum, told NewsHour. “The technology is the continuation of what has happened in recent years.” \nAmazon first entered the food market with Amazon Fresh, a delivery food service launched in 2007 in Seattle, but that project’s potential was limited. According to Kantar Retail , online purchases make up only one percent of the $674 billion market for edible groceries. \nThe 1,800 square-foot Amazon Go store taps into a different and possibly more lucrative market. Convenience stores serve 160 million customers per day and earn $575 billion in sales annually, according to the National Association of Convenience Stores . An Amazon employee is pictured outside the Amazon Go brick-and-mortar grocery store without lines or checkout counters, in Seattle Washington, U.S. December 5, 2016. Photo by Jason Redmond/REUTERS \nAmazon is also exploring two other larger-format stores, as well as two drive-through prototypes, the Wall Street Journal reported . \nIf successful, Lehmacher indicates the technology could be applied to countless other stores, which employed 3.5 million cashiers in the U.S. last year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics . \nTom Davenport, professor of information technology at Babson College, warns employees will have adapt if they want to stay relevant. \n“If you’re willing to learn something about how the technology works and can either fix it or try to improve it, I think there will still be a job for you,” Davenport said. “But if you’re wedded to the traditional point of sale grocery role, I think your future is quite limited.” \nFuture jobs might shift to consumer-focused areas, such as managing cybersecurity threats for the new technology and fixing system glitches. \n“It’s not that this will revolutionize the world tomorrow,” Lehmacher said, but, he said, it is something customers and workers will need to start preparing for today.",

      "text": "It’s been a long path for the adaption of Dark Horse’s Emily the Strange , which once had Chloë Grace Moretz ( Amityville Horror, Dark Shadows, Let Me In, Kick-Ass ) attached to star as the title character. Dark Horse Entertainment has been developing the character as a movie project since 2008, setting it up at Universal in 2010. It’s once again gone into turnaround, which is leading it to one of the best places it can – Amazon Studios.\nThe intellectual property, a punky goth girl and her assorted cats created by skateboarder Rob Reger, is in the process of being set up to be adapted as a feature film at Amazon Studios, THR writes. There’s a big difference, though: Universal’s take was to have been live-action, but the Amazon Studios version will be in the form of an animated movie that would keep the authenticity and edge of the property. \nThe character was created in the early 1990s by Reger, a skateboarder who was designing assorted stickers, T-shirts and skateboards. That one design took on a life of its own, and a multimillion-dollar worldwide business with toeholds in fashion, books and comics, toys, school supplies and accessories took off.\nDark Horse Entertainment is negotiating the deal that once set will see the company’s Mike Richardson acting as producer. Reger also will be a producer, as will Dark Horse’s Keith Goldberg.\n",

Share story Ángel González Seattle Times business reporter \nThe largest union representing grocery store workers has come out strongly against Amazon.com’s launch of a store sans cashiers, a sign of how a recent generation of futuristic technology comes with a dose of angst for big parts of the workforce. \n“Amazon believes that America’s hard-working men and women are irrelevant to customers — they couldn’t be more wrong,” Marc Perrone, international president of the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union (UFCW) said in a statement released Tuesday. \nAmazon on Monday unveiled a pilot store dubbed “Amazon Go” right in the middle of its downtown campus. So far it’s open only to employees who are part of a beta testing program, but the company said in 2017 the public will have access. \nThe store deploys a combination of technologies ranging from artificial intelligence to computer vision allowing shoppers to pick products from the shelves and walk out without lining up behind a register. Amazon says it’s technology that’s similar to what animates driverless cars. Most Read Stories Unlimited Digital Access. $1 for 4 weeks. \nAnd just like driverless cars, which threaten to shake up the livelihoods of millions of truck, taxi and Uber drivers, Amazon Go is bound to trouble those who fear the displacement of millions of relatively low-skilled jobs in an economy where automation has already taken a toll on manufacturing employment. Cashiers are the second largest occupation in America, to the tune of 3.5 million jobs, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. \nIn a statement, Amazon said: “Getting rid of checkout lines is great for customers, and our associates are great for customers, too.” \nThe company said Amazon Go stores will have employees working in both the kitchen and the store, preparing food, greeting customers and stocking shelves. \nAmazon has come under criticism in the past for upending large swaths of the retail sector, from independent booksellers to mom-and-pop Main Street stores. \nThe company has argued that it’s creating plenty of opportunities for independent authors, merchants and start-ups that rely on its platforms. The company says that about half the items sold on its site are shipped by third-party sellers, many of which have lots of revenue and generate jobs. \n“Amazon is masking its blind greed as progress,” the UFCW’s Perrone said, adding, “This is not about improving customer experience: it’s about destroying good jobs, with no regard to the families and communities impacted. This is not the America that hard-working families want and deserve. Ángel González: 206-464-2250 or .

      "text": "Here are just 6 reasons why Amazon’s “Good Girls Revolt” should not be cancelled Meaghan Kirby More Last week, Amazon Studios shocked subscribers when it cancelled critically acclaimed series Good Girls Revolt after just one season. The series — which is a fictionalized version of the landmark 1970 lawsuit in which 46 female employees of Newsweek sued the magazine for gender discrimination — is based on a 2012 book of the same name by Lynn Povich, one of the leading complainants in the suit. The cancellation came as a shock to many, not just because they were fans of the series, but because of its popularity amongst Amazon viewers . Data commissioned by Sony TV, the production company behind the series, found the series to have an 80% completion rate, which is higher than many of Amazon’s most beloved series. More With latest reports citing Amazon Studios head Roy Price’s disinterest in the series as the primary factor for the cancellation, there seems to be a serious underlying gender problem. While it appears that Sony is looking for another distributor, let’s take a moment to reflect on the impact of Good Girls Revolt and its importance for women and men now more than ever. Here are just a few reasons (beyond popularity) why Good Girls Revolt deserves another season . 1. The series takes place around the turn of 1970, but is still incredibly relevant in 2016. The lawsuit takes place 46 years ago, but will still resonant with so many women. We continue to live in a time when women are denied opportunity because of their sex, not to mention most still make less than their male counterparts. We can connect with Patti and the women of News of the Week because, underneath their retro garb and Creedence Clearwater Revival records, they’re facing similar problems to ours. If there’s one thing this show has taught us, it’s that 46 years may have passed but we still have much more ground to cover. 2. The women are complex and flawed (and the acting is superb). More While they’re our champions and our heroes in taking on this difficult task, the women of News of the Week are complex and multilayered. Patti Robinson (Genevieve Angelson), Cindy Reston (Erin Darke), and Jane Hollander (Anna Camp) don’t seamlessly pull together their lawsuit. They engage in potentially damaging office relationships and struggle to pull together enough support from the women of the office. There are also times when they are selfish and unaware of their own privilege, like Jane and her wealth, and Patti and Cindy not understanding their privilege as white women while they try to recruit the only three black women in their office to join the cause. Their portrayal is made even better because they are flawed and real. 3. It’s a show about gender discrimination without pointing fingers at men. More Read More Good Girls Revolt doesn’t cast men as malicious villains actively seeking to act as the foils to their female colleagues. Doug Rhodes (Hunter Parrish) is the reporter to Patti’s researcher and her on-again, off-again boyfriend who wants to understand Patti’s point of view but struggles to understand his privilege as a man . He loves Patti and in theory, wants her to follow her dreams to become a reporter but just does not (and in many ways, simply cannot) understand the lack of opportunity she has as a woman in a male-dominated world, let alone workforce. Similarly, Finn Woodbridge (Chris Diamantopoulos), News of the Week ’s Editor at Large wants to modernize the magazine but can’t shake his sexist “boys club” newsroom habits . While some of the men do abhorrent things, most of the male characters seem to consider their female colleagues as partners and friends without actually understanding the gross inequalities as anything other than journalistic tradition. These guys aren’t bad people, they just have yet to reconcile what it means to be straight white men , which would be really interesting to explore in future seasons. 4. It’s a show for women of all generations. More My sisters and I love watching the show because it makes us feel empowered and it inspires us to speak up and act on moments of injustice. It reminds us that we’re not alone in our frustrations with gender inequality and makes us realize that change is possible. At the same time, it’s incredible to watch the show and talk about it with our mom, who grew up during the ‘70s. Sure, she was a bit younger than Patti, Jane, and Cindy, but she experienced the same lack of opportunities despite intellectual abilities and drive. She remembers the sexist comments and profound male arrogance that made up her regular work environment. Specifically, this show offers young women a chance to learn and build on the women’s movement that came before them, while simultaneously reminding older (or middle-aged) women why it is important to continue fighting and not become complacent. 5. There is so much more to be explored both in terms of gender and politics. More The series centers around the lawsuit, but the show does an incredible job weaving in real-life events and stories within narrative. It touched on the complexities of the Vietnam War and veteran struggles back home. It references the added struggle of fitting into the office environment for a woman of color in the working world, leaving the opportunity to revisit the storyline in later seasons. The first season also featured stories that centered around illegal abortions and potential unwanted pregnancies . The point is, there is SO much left to be covered. 6. This series is essentially an ode to the power of women. More It’s impossible to not feel empowered watching the show. This show was created by a woman, based on a book by a woman, and is centered around women being all-around badasses. In addition to the female dominated cast, the number of women working behind the scenes on the series is almost unheard of. In the 10-episode first season, six episodes were directed by women and women made up half of the credited writers on staff. In an industry where women make up such a small percentage of showrunners, directors, producers, and writers, Good Girls Revolt is breaking barriers in a multitude of ways. Without rehashing the entirety of the past year, 2016 was a really tough year to be a woman . Good Girls Revolt was a beacon of hope for many women looking to be inspired. With or without a second season, Good Girls Revolt meant a lot for women in 2016. This series deserves to find a new home because it is telling a history that can’t and shouldn’t be forgotten.",

      "title": "How Amazon could become the first $1 trillion business - Business Insider",
      "text": "print Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos Getty/Drew Angerer \nAmazon has been on an absolute tear over the past 18 months, more than doubling its market cap to roughly $360 billion. \nBut according to RBC Capital's managing director Mark Mahaney, there's still plenty of room to grow. \nIn fact, Mahaney is so bullish on Amazon's growth potential that he sees it becoming the first $1 trillion business within the next five years. \nMahaney laid out his thinking on Wednesday at Business Insider's annual conference, Ignition. Although he pointed out this is \"just for fun\" and is based on the assumption that Amazon's core business continues to execute \"really well,\" his basic premise actually makes a lot of sense. \nBasically, Mahaney forecasts Amazon's retail business will continue to grow 20% year-over-year on average, while the AWS cloud business will grow at a 40% annual clip for the next five years. In its most recent quarter, Amazon's retail grew a little over 25% year-over-year. AWS grew 55% year-over-year. \nThen, put a 10% margin on the retail side, and a 40% margin on AWS, and you would get to roughly $82 in earnings per share, he said. If you give a \"modest\" 25X P/E multiple on that, Amazon's stock will hit $2,000, which would equate to a $1 trillion market cap. \nRBC Capital \nOn top of that, e-commerce only accounts for roughly 10% of total retail, and Amazon is the leader in the space, meaning there's still tons of market opportunity, he said. \nAnd this is only based on Amazon's core retail and cloud business. The company is constantly investing in other areas in search for its fourth pillar of growth, so another big revenue source could emerge over the next five years. Mahaney believes that could come from one of the following areas : business supplies sales, groceries, shipping logistics, and artificial intelligence/virtual reality (AI/VR). \nMahaney isn't the only high-profile investor to predict Amazon's trillion-dollar valuation. Chamath Palihapitiya, CEO of venture-capital fund Social Capital, recently said that he sees Amazon becoming a $3 trillion company a decade from now. Disclosure: Jeff Bezos is an investor in Business Insider through his personal investment company Bezos Expeditions. ",

      "text": "5 Amazon Go alternatives to save checkout time Marie Rossiter 11:29 AM, Dec 6, 2016 7:35 AM, Dec 7, 2016 Share Article LOS ANGELES - NOVEMBER 08: Employees teach shoppers to use self-service checkout stations at a Fresh &amp; Easy grocery as Tesco PLC, the UK's biggest retailer, officially enters the U.S. market, opening its first six stores in southern California on November 8, 2007 in Los Angeles, California. Tesco is importing its own system of grocery store operations, making heavy use of pre-packaged produce, in contrast to U.S.-based grocery chains, to reduce overhead and refrigeration costs. (Photo by David McNew/Getty Images) David McNew Next \nMonday's Amazon Go announcement has shoppers excitedly talking about the next generation of grocery shopping. \nAdvances in digital technology have changed the grocery shopping experience in recent years with added conveniences and opportunities to save money. \nA study by Packaged Facts shows online grocery shopping will likely hit $100 billion by 2019 as more people become familiar with the variety of options available. Meanwhile. brick-and-mortar stores continue to search for ways to bring in and keep customers, as well. And, according to Nielson , while online shopping continues to grow, shoppers are searching for more convenience during the traditional in-store experience. \n\"The connected commerce era has arrived,\" wrote Patrick Dodd, Global President Retailer Vertical of Nielson in a 2015 study.. \"Consumers are no longer shopping entirely online or offline; rather, they're taking a blended approach, using whatever channel suits their best needs.\" \nWhile Amazon Go may be the latest shopping innovation, there are already a number of grocery business models serving to meet busy customers' need to save time. Digital coupons and loyalty programs \nForget buying the weekly paper to find, clip and organize coupons. Leave the big binder or accordion folder you have to dig through at home. Grocery store chains and even the major coupon providers now offer savings anyone can download with a simple click. All of the coupons can be easily organized and carried and can be redeemed automatically on checkout. Curbside pickup \nA number of grocery stores, including Wal-Mart, Kroger and Hy-Vee offer customers the opportunity shop from home and pick up your purchases. Just click the items you need to buy, schedule a time to pick them up and then drive to the store at the appointed time. Then, go to the curbside pickup, pay and someone loads the groceries into the car. Grocery delivery/meal subscription services \nFor shoppers who simply want to avoid the store altogether, there are a wide range of grocery delivery or subscription services. Amazon Dash : Never worry about running out of items as detergent, diapers, beauty products and hundreds more. The Amazon Dash buttons can be placed where you store these items and as you run low, just click the button and confirm the purchase to replenish the item. Amazon Dash is available for Prime members only. Amazon Fresh : Online grocery shopping and delivery direct to your door. Whether you need fresh produce or canned goods, Amazon Fresh allows shoppers to cross off their must-have lists and have what they need. Groceries can be delivered same day or the following day. Meal subscription services: For people who not only want convenience in shopping, but also in meal planning, there are many meal subscription services as as Blue Apron , Plated , Hello Fresh and Purple Carrot have pre-planned meals that are then packaged fresh and shipped to customers with recipes to follow to make home-cooked meals beyond the typical fare. Scan as you go \nStores around the country, including Sam's Warehouse and Stop and Shop, have been using scan as you go technology to avoid the long lines at the checkout counter for a while. Each shopper gets a personal price scanner to use as they select their groceries. When you are done shopping, make a quick payment and you're out the door. Wal-Mart has been testing this program of and on over the years, as well. Mobile Payments \nA number of grocery stores are connecting to Apple Wallet, Google Wallet, PayPal and other mobile wallets for customers to use as payment. Like Amazon Go, these payment options give customers the ability to leave their cash and cards at home and simply use their email address or smartphone to pay the bill. \n\nCopyright 2016 Scripps Media, Inc.

      "text": "Harry Potter just can't stop setting records. Amazon has revealed that the script for Harry Potter and the Cursed Child was its biggest-selling book of the year, also topping the Most Gifted and Most Wished For books. \"The power of Potter is still strong, and readers of all ages can't get enough of Hogwarts. Harry Potter and the Cursed Child was the most anticipated book of the year, breaking pre-order records months before its release,\" explained Amazon senior book editor Chris Schluep (via EW). The best-selling lists consist of first editions published this year, including both print and Kindle purchases. Second and third spot went to Paul Kalanithi's memoir When Breath Becomes Air and John Grisham's The Whistler. Harry Potter and the Cursed Child was released when the play opened on London's West End this summer and sold more than two million copies in its first two days. Earlier this month, it was revealed that JK Rowling and her theatrical team are in talks to bring Harry Potter and the Cursed Child to Broadway in the spring of 2018. It would see New York City's historic Lyric Theatre transformed from a 1,900-seater venue into a fully-immersive 1,500-seater space. The play cast its spell on the Evening Standard Theatre Awards last month as it picked up the Best Play gong, making it no surprise that it was recently extended through to February 2018. You might have to cast your own spell if you want to get tickets though. ",

      "text": "Dec 7, 2016 1:51 PM Photo: Amazon Share Tweet \nThe team behind Good Girls Revolt isn’t going quietly into the good night following Amazon’s cancellation of the series . Creator Dana Calvo tells The Hollywood Reporter that by the streamer’s own standards/metrics, her ’60s journalism show was “a hit.” Apparently, Amazon takes a couple of things into account: a show’s Rotten Tomatoes audience score—which was 96% fresh for Good Girls Revolt —and its ability to ratchet up sales. Calvo says her show was no slouch in that second department either: “Of the people driven from the entertainment sections to the commerce section, we were driving 55 percent, which was phenomenal.” \nAmazon didn’t pony up those figures, in case you’re wondering. Instead, Calvo told BuzzFeed via Twitter that she got the data from Sony— Good Girls’ production company—which picked it up from streaming monitor site Symphony Advanced Media. I just called @DanaSCalvo of #GoodGirlsRevolt , and she said this about its cancellation. pic.twitter.com/rFM5vA5Nc9 — Kate Aurthur (@KateAurthur) December 2, 2016 \nBut it sounds like Calvo doesn’t think her show could performed well enough for Amazon at all. She goes on to tell THR that Amazon Studios was indifferent to her adaptation of Lynn Povich’s book. \nWhat we hadn’t factored in is that [Amazon Studios head] Roy Price just doesn’t care for the show. He’s representative of the Amazon culture in that he’s just impenetrable. \nAll I know is that in the [season two] pitch, he asked us to refer to the characters by the actors’ names because he didn’t know the characters’ names. \nNow, THR cites “insiders” who say that Price was pretty hands off about the show, skipping the premiere and reportedly saying it wouldn’t be an awards contender. But Joe Lewis, Amazon Studios head of comedy and drama development, tells a different story. Lewis says Amazon had “had high hopes for Good Girls Revolt , and have tremendous respect for the creators, cast and Sony, but I can tell you that the Symphony numbers being reported are wrong and that the show wasn’t performing at the levels we had hoped for—either in total viewership or completion rates.” \nBut the revolution might be televised elsewhere, as THR also reports ABC, Freeform, USA Network, Bravo and Hulu are all eyeing the series for a second season. \nSubmit your Newswire tips here",

Within a few years, they had displaced thousands of book and retail stores nationwide (remember Walden Books?). \nRecently, they have gone “old school” and have opened up physical book and local stores to cater to those who have not jumped on the click and shop bandwagon. Now, with Amazon “Go”, a Seattle-based grocery store is using Amazon technology to eliminate cashiers, lines and the process of checkout itself. \nAccording to TechCrunch , the sole retail location is built specifically around meals — sounding more like an early 21st century version of an automat than a full-fledged grocery store, revolving around ready-to-eat meals and snacks prepared on-site along with Amazon Meal Kits. \nSo, while consumers may save a few minutes during the checkout process, the slippery slope of low-wage jobs continues to permanently erode from our society. \n“The power of our mobile phones may permanently obliterate over a million jobs in the next few years,” according to Scott Rilley, CEO of MonkeyDrill , a leader in mobile marketing. “Just as the automobile replaced the horse and carriage, our smart phones will be responsible for killing and creating, jobs. The difference between distinguishing job killers from job growth is being on the right side of the equation.” \nRilley knows what he’s talking about. His firm has provided not only the mobile apps, but the mobile-ready websites for countless insurance companies, auto dealerships and other businesses. “A company who rides the positive side of the mobile age will be in a state of growth, both in revenue and job creation. It is only the companies or people who cling to the status quo who are in peril.” \nLydia R. an entrepreneur from the Midwest, lauded Rilley’s attention to detail and forward thinking solutions. “A Mobile App was just what we needed to keep my customers coming back over and over again; especially when our business was slow.” \nHowever, as businesses embrace mobile technology like this what is the net effect of jobs? For every low-wage job lost, is there an equal number of tech jobs created? More importantly, as entry level jobs permanently evaporate, where do unskilled workers begin their employment journey? \nEconomists with a static model predict a net drop in jobs. Entrepreneurs, on the other hand, see all volatility as opportunity. While entry level jobs are slowly being replaced with technology including apps and robots, an increased demand for developers, engineers and support services are on the rise. \nPerhaps the next big opportunity is an educational system specifically designed to transform an unskilled worker onto path of technology support, service and mobile business operations. \nNo matter what the future holds Rilley, and people like him, are sure to exploit the opportunity for the benefits of their customers. \n### About MonkeyDrill \nWe strive to help increase profit for your business through Mobile App Only Offers to current and future clients as they download and use your mobile app while also creating Brand Awareness.

      "text": "Close Patrick T. Fallon \nEmployees assist shoppers at the checkout counter of a Wal-Mart in Los Angeles on Nov. 24, 2014. Bloomberg photo by Patrick T. Fallon. Buffett's shrinking Wal-Mart stake signals Amazon holiday threat By Katherine Chiglinsky, Shannon Pettypiece and Jordyn Holman • Bloomberg 7 hrs ago ( … ) Patrick T. Fallon \nEmployees assist shoppers at the checkout counter of a Wal-Mart in Los Angeles on Nov. 24, 2014. Bloomberg photo by Patrick T. Fallon. \nWhen Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Vice Chairman Charles Munger lamented the mistakes made in the company's first 50 years under Warren Buffett, he cited the failure to buy Wal-Mart Stores stock early enough in the retailer's history. Judging by recent events, Buffett doesn't think Wal-Mart is such a great idea for his company's next half-century. \nBerkshire said last month that it cut its holding in the Bentonville, Ark.-based retailer to 13 million shares as of Sept. 30, marking the third-straight quarter that Buffett's company lowered its stake. Online shopping has shifted the balance of power among retailers, a trend that's become more evident this holiday season, and Wal-Mart stock has trailed Amazon.com in recent years. \n\"He makes mistakes too,\" Brian Yarbrough, an analyst with Edward Jones & Co., said of Buffett. \"There are a lot of better places to put new money than Wal-Mart,\" he added. \"They are going to have to continue to fight this headwind of Amazon.\" \nBuffett, 86, has long highlighted the vulnerability of even the largest retailers, citing Sears, F.W. Woolworth, Kresge and Montgomery Ward as merchants that lost their dominant positions. More recently, he's focused on the threat from companies like Jeff Bezos's Amazon that sell everything from food to clothes and electronic gadgets online. \n\"It is a big, big force and it has already disrupted plenty of people and it will disrupt more,\" Buffett told shareholders at Omaha, Neb.-based Berkshire's most recent annual meeting. Many competitors, \"including us in a few areas, have not figured the way to either participate in it, or to counter it.\" \nWal-Mart still trades below its closing price from 2013, even after rallying 15 percent since Dec. 31. Berkshire's stake topped 60 million shares in 2014, when Wal-Mart was one of Buffett's five biggest equity positions, valued at more than $5 billion at the end of the year. The holding was cut by more than half in the three months ended Sept. 30, according to a regulatory filing, and now it doesn't crack the top-15 list in Berkshire's portfolio, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. \nWhile Buffett is known for sticking with stocks like Coca-Cola Co. for decades, he's not wedded to old favorites when circumstances change. In recent years, he got rid of most of Berkshire's stock in Procter & Gamble Co. and Graham Holdings Co., the former owner of the Washington Post. \nHis company recently invested in airlines, an industry that Buffett long dismissed as too risky. Also, he's empowered deputy stock pickers to diversify the portfolio, a move that led to an investment in iPhone maker Apple. Buffett has mostly avoided tech stocks, and missed out on the years-long rally at Amazon, even as he repeatedly praised Bezos. \nBerkshire's units include several retailers, such as Helzberg Diamonds, Jordan's Furniture and Nebraska Furniture Mart. They are a fraction of the size, however, of subsidiaries like the BNSF railway, the Geico auto insurer and an energy operation. And Buffett has said he learned some tough lessons in the retail business. \n\"We have a really bad record, starting in 1966,\" Buffett told CNBC in 2014. \"We bought what we thought was a second-rate department store in Baltimore at a third-rate price, but we found out very quickly that we bought a fourth-rate department store.\" \nStill, he saw something different in Wal-Mart, which, like Geico, established itself as a dominant low-cost provider. Berkshire disclosed a stake of 19.9 million shares in 2005 and doubled the holding by the end of 2009. The stock had already surged more than 4,000 percent in the two decades through 2004. Munger, 92, has lamented that Berkshire didn't invest sooner. \n\"While mistakes of commission were common, almost all huge errors were in not making a purchase, including not purchasing Wal-Mart stock when that was sure to work out enormously well,\" Munger wrote in a 2015 letter to investors. \"The errors of omission were of much importance. Berkshire's net worth would now be at least $50 billion higher if it had seized several opportunities it was not quite smart enough to recognize as virtually sure things.\"",

      "text": "Because you're always in the market for a swingin' good costume drama, Amazon has conjured up a healthy flapper-costume budget for its new Jazz Age–set series, Z: The Beginning of Everything . Following the roaring life of Zelda Fitzgerald (a heavily accented Christina Ricci!) and her turbulent relationship with her husband, a certain F. Scott Fitzgerald, the first trailer somehow manages to make their fights look glamorous beside a plethora of Champagne flutes and Charleston dancers. Think of the Fitzgerald scenes from Midnight in Paris , but 50 percent grittier ... and filmed in America. It's set to premiere on January 27 on Amazon Prime.",

Attempting to depose him, the Duke of Kiskaddon gambles…and loses. Now the duke must atone by handing over his young son, Owen, as the king’s hostage. And should his loyalty falter again, the boy will pay with his life.\nSeeking allies and eluding Severn’s spies, Owen learns to survive in the court of Kingfountain. But when new evidence of his father’s betrayal threatens to seal his fate, Owen must win the vengeful king’s favor by proving his worth—through extraordinary means. And only one person can aid his desperate cause: a mysterious woman, dwelling in secrecy, who truly wields power over life, death, and destiny.\n– The Queen’s Poisoner (The Kingfountain Series Book 1) (Kindle) – $2\n– The Thief’s Daughter (The Kingfountain Series Book 2) (Kindle) – $2\n– The King’s Traitor (The Kingfountain Series Book 3) (Kindle) – $2\nThe post Like Fantasy Books?

      "text": "Amazon should have the NES Classic Edition in stock soon Chris Mills Pin it Share The NES Classic Edition is virtually impossible to find right now, unless you want to go on eBay and pay someone five times the asking price for a glorified Nintendo DS. Up until now, your best chance has been flash sales by Walmart, or weird one-off stock events from Toys R Us and Urban Outfitters . But Nintendo is pumping out consoles as fast as it can, which means you might still have a chance to buy one before Christmas. The latest retailer to enter the fray? Amazon. DON’T MISS: 10 great iOS 10 widgets that should be on every iPhone The country’s biggest online retailer dropped a big hint about an upcoming sale yesterday on Twitter, which has us thinking there’s stock coming soon: NES Classic fans: we've got a couple exciting announcements to make in the coming week. Stay tuned for more info soon! \n— Amazon Video Games (@amazongames) December 7, 2016 That announcement is about as vague and open-ended as they come, so we don’t have much to go on for the time being. My best guess is that Amazon is going to have some kind of Lightning sale for Prime members only, which will help scare off the scalpers, and also get more people onto Amazon’s VIP program. Of course, it’s equally possible that Amazon is going to troll us with an exclusive one-day sales event for NES Classic cases, skins and accessories, but I’m really hoping the company is better than that. Even if Amazon does run some kind of limited sales event, chances are stock will be incredibly limited. Walmart is having trouble fulfilling orders from two weeks ago, according to emails readers have sent me, and the Urban Outfitters flash sale seems to have only sold a tiny number of consoles, leaving hundreds of people complaining on Twitter. For the time being, it seems like the recipe for NES Classic success is the same as ever : keep your eyes on local Target and Walmart stores, using stock trackers to see any overnight deliveries coming into stores. Watch Walmart’s site for any last-minute flash sales, although those seem to have ceased for now. And, for the time being, add to the list desperately monitoring Amazon’s Twitter account for any updates on this mysterious sale. There’s still a few weeks before Christmas. Don’t give up hope yet. Here’s the Amazon link you’ll want to keep your eye on every waking moment from now until Christmas Trending right now:",

      "text": "Mindful of Amazon, malls take the Santa experience high-tech JOSEPH PISANI Share View photos In this Sunday, Nov. 20, 2016, photo, mall shoppers line up to visit the \"Adventure to Santa,\" a DreamWorks DreamPlace experience at North Point Mall, in Alpharetta, Ga. In an effort to lure online shoppers to their stores, many malls are upgrading the traditional visit to Santa into a high-tech spectacle. (AP Photo/Branden Camp) More NEW YORK (AP) — Hop on a virtual sleigh ride to the North Pole. Stand on the \"Naughty or Nice O'Meter.\" Snap a selfie and see your face on a dancing elf. The Santa experience has gotten a makeover as many malls install shows and games they hope will lure shoppers who are buying more online. About 40 malls in the U.S. and one in London have the high-tech Santa displays, most of them located near major cities that tend to house pricier stores. Taking photos on Santa's lap costs about $30 and up, around the same as at other malls, but most of the malls say people can walk through without purchasing anything. \"It was a half-hour of entertainment that was free,\" says Katie Mass, who took her twin daughters through Santa's Flight Academy, a 3,000-square-foot setup at The Mall at Short Hills in New Jersey. She had gone to the mall to return some dresses, but had to stop when her 2-year olds saw the spectacle. \"They started running,\" says the stay-at-home mom from Westfield, New Jersey. The girls tapped touch screens, pulled levers and watched as flight suits were virtually fit over their bodies on a screen. The final stop was a two-story tall enclosed sleigh that dropped fake snow upon them. One girl made snow angels on the floor while her sister danced under the colorful lasers. \"It was extravagant and well done,\" says Mass. Malls are hoping the over-the-top Santa visits remind people what brick-and-mortar stores can offer. They're increasingly trying to offer special experiences as they compete with online rivals, says Howard Davidowitz, chairman of New York-based retail consulting group Davidowitz & Associates. \"The parents love it, the kids love it and Amazon can't do it,\" says Davidowitz. Santa's Flight Academy was developed by mall operator Taubman Centers Inc., which spent two years on the idea. After testing it last year at The Mall of San Juan in Puerto Rico, the company rolled it out to 11 other Taubman malls this year, replacing a low-tech ice palace that had housed Santa for years. Like other malls with elaborate Santa sets, Taubman declined to say how much it spent on Santa's Flight Academy. Guy Perry, a manager of a Disney Store at Taubman's Westfarms mall in West Hartford, Connecticut, credited this year's \"great\" store traffic to Santa's Flight Academy. Kids come into the store and tell him how they helped Santa take flight. \"It is getting a lot of good reviews,\" says Perry. An old-school Santa display got the boot at Queens Center in New York as the mall this year installed Santa HQ, a set sponsored by cable TV channel HGTV. As kids stand on the \"Naughty or Nice O'Meter,\" they can watch their names pop up on Santa's \"Nice List\" screen. In another room they can take a selfie and see themselves as dancing elves. In the last room, they're handed tablets that use augmented reality technology to make it appear as if cartoon elves are popping out of the walls and packing gifts. The entire set and trees put on a light show every 20 minutes that is synchronized with holiday music. Quite a difference from last year's Santa setup: A couch and some Christmas trees. \"It's Santa-meets-21st-century-technology,\" says John Scaturro, a marketing manager for the mall. Queens Center's owner, Macerich Co., first installed Santa HQ at some malls two years ago. This year, that expanded to 15 malls from 10. As of November, sales of photos with Santa at Queens Center nearly tripled from last year, says Scaturro. In addition to bringing in shoppers, the set is an advertisement for HGTV. Screens air the network's home improvement and real estate programs. Stars of its shows were set to sign autographs and take photos at two Macerich malls. It's cartoon characters that share the spotlight with Santa at another mall display, the DreamWorks DreamPlace. The set, created by DreamWorks Animation, stars characters from the movie studio's \"Kung Fu Panda\" films — replacing the green ogre from the \"Shrek\" movies that were last year's focus. Thirteen malls are using the set, which uses rumbling seats, wind and mist to create a virtual ride on Santa's sleigh. Whatever malls are spending on the Santa spectacles is worth it, says Davidowitz. Santa has always attracted crowds, he says, but adding a high-tech twist is likely to bring in even more who may stop to shop. \"I don't see many things out there that equal Santa's power to draw crowds,\" he says.",

      "text": "by Taylor Bryant \nWell-behaved women don’t make history, as the new trailer for Amazon’s forthcoming bio series Z: The Beginning of Everything reminds us. \nStarring the sorely underutilized Christina Ricci, the series is a fictional take on the life of novelist, muse, and '20s icon Zelda Fitzgerald. The trailer takes us through Zelda’s highs: meeting her future husband, the champagne-filled prohibition days, and her overall charisma. And then it takes us right through the lows: her eventual downward spiral, marriage troubles, and... her husband stealing her work. Truly a love story for the ages. \nFrom what we can glean, it looks like a fascinating take on a fascinating woman. Cheers to Zelda finally getting the attention history never gave her. \nSubscribers can watch the first episode on Amazon Prime now, while the full 10-part series arrives January 27. It’s sure to be one boozy ride. NYLON Video",

      "text": "Follow @munchies \nFor those who swear by self-checkout lines as a means of keeping human interaction at a minimum, one retail giant has just made your most misanthropic dream come true. \nThis week, Amazon unveiled Amazon Go, a new kind of grocery shopping experience that requires no barcode scanning, cash, or small-talk. The mysterious project first came under speculation in August, when the company began construction in the Ballard neighborhood of Seattle, but wasn’t revealed in its entirety until the release of this explanatory video. \n“What would shopping look like if you could walk into a store, grab what you want, and just go?” a breezy voice asks over images of a bearded, trucker hat-donning guy ( who looks just like you and your bros, right? ) grabbing a wrap on the go. From the outset, Amazon wants to establish this isn’t a regular grocery store; this is a cool grocery store. \nThe futuristic shopping system is the latest in the consumer juggernaut’s endless quest to eliminate the need to spend virtual dough anywhere else, which has included enlisting pizza-delivering drones to ensure maximum pie access with minimal personal contact. \nAt the inaugural Amazon Go location, the company weaves “the most advanced machine learning, computer vision, and [artificial intelligence] into the very fabric of the store,” guaranteeing “no lines, no check-outs, no registers.” The magic equation for this high-tech brand of shopping is a mix of “computer vision, deep learning algorithms, and sensor fusion,” also known, for the less tech-inclined, as “just walk out technology.” \nComparing their own pioneering technology to that of self-driving cars, the company explains that all that’s required of shoppers is a tap of the Amazon app at the store’s entry. When their shopping is complete, customers can “just walk out,” letting the combination of sensors and other technological doodads calculate the tab. A virtual receipt is then sent to the individual’s app for easy review. READ MORE: The Supermarket of the Future Knows Exactly What You’re Eating \nThough the establishment of an IRL, interaction-free shopping option doesn’t bode well for the average retail worker, their job security will likely remain intact for a while as Amazon plots the next move in their total commercial takeover. The first Amazon Go location on 7th Avenue in Seattle is currently in Beta mode and only accessible by select company employees. The store is slated to open to the public in early 2017. \nIn the meantime, checkout folks and bag boys might want to start updating their LinkedIns.",
