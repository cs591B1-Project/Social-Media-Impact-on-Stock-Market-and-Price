      "title": "Starbucks Verismo System review – Coffee shop coffee at home",
      "text": "The first generation of the Starbucks Verismo System was meant to give Starbucks fans a way to make the coffee they’re used to at home. It was met with some negative feedback from consumers.\nSo, Starbucks decided to try again with a second generation. The new Verismo System offers a much more competitive product, and I’d pick one up if I was a daily Starbucks diehard.\nGreat coffee and espresso engineered with an odd drawback Does this make good coffee? That’s the simple question here. Yes. It does. The coffee matches what’s sold in Starbucks, and I know that because I bought the same exact beverages I made at home and tried them side by side. The cappuccino from the Verismo system wasn’t quite the same, but both were of similar quality.\nThe coffee is brewed at the right temperature, though it dispenses 10oz at roughly 175º F. The brewing temperature seems right because of the spot-on flavor of the coffee. It’s neither too weak or burnt, and I’d guess that the internal brew put it much closer to 195º F. The system and proprietary Starbucks Verismo pods produce much better coffee than what you get from the Keurig, though that comes at an expense.\nI couldn’t find the pods sold locally at any grocery stores near me in the Mid-Atlantic. My only option was online, and Starbucks sells them for, in the smallest amount, $12-13 for 12 pods. That’s more expensive than the competition, but it’s still cheaper than a Starbucks coffee shop.\nOn the whole, I admired the engineering behind the Verismo System’s Brewer. The rinse feature is brilliant, it produces large cups of coffee, espresso shots come out perfectly every single time and when pods are used they drop into a collection bin that’s housed within the unit. All of that is great, though multiple weeks of use brought up an odd drawback.\nSee full gallery on TechnoBuffalo Even with the cup holding tray removed, some travel mugs were too large to actually fit below the brewer. I had to either brew into a different mug or (I don’t recommend this) hold my mug off of the counter and move the brewer to a hanging position. The profile of the device is too low for some cups.\nWhile it was easy to clean, Starbucks says that the way to properly deep clean the brewer is with special cleaning liquids. There’s no recommendation to simply brew with vinegar and water.\nA milk frother that works well most of the time The milk frother can be purchased separately if you want the addition. It typically sells for $59, but it’s a necessity if you want to make lattes and cappuccinos with the System. It heats and froths milk, and it can do the frothing without heat if you want your drink iced or chilled.\nIt’s also easy to clean, though you’ll need to work the bottom of the frother to remove any milk film created with the heat. It froths quickly, but it is the longest part of the brewing process by far.\nMy only complaint with the frother comes from the produced texture. At times, it’s wetter than it should be when frothing for cappuccinos. I’d say it happens, perhaps, once out of every 10 uses, and I couldn’t pinpoint the reason for it.\nThere are cheaper frothers out there, so you don’t necessarily need the Starbucks version. It works well, though, and it’s priced competitively when compared to other heated frothers.\nThe Starbucks Verismo System fills a niche The Starbucks Verismo System sits right between the Keurig and coffee shops in price. The pods are more expensive than what the competition offers, but each cup of java, espresso or otherwise, is cheaper than what you’d find in an actual Starbucks.\nIf the system’s two biggest benefits are its ease of use and the relative quality of coffee, its biggest slight is the cost of pods. For an everyday Starbucks drinker, the Verismo System makes a whole lot of sense. You’ll get the Starbucks you crave at home for less money than you spend in stores.\nSee full gallery on TechnoBuffalo If you’re more of a frugal coffee drinker, like me, than the Verismo System will stand as an unnecessary expense. Which is totally okay. As strong as the system is, I don’t think it’s been designed or priced to be ultra competitive among consumers like me.\nIt is a novelty, though, and one that produces great coffee. I’ve had a cappuccino daily since having it in my house, and that’s been a great treat.\nIf you like Starbucks and don’t mind the extra price of the pods, the Verismo System is a well-engineered product that makes good coffee. It’s definitely more capable than the Keurig, so keep that in mind if you’re shopping for both.\nBlack Friday presents a great deal for the system The Verismo System is actually on sale right now, too. We received a note from the PR contact working with us in regards to the system. Here are the details.\nFrom November 21 through December 25, customers can purchase the “Everyday Bundle” for $129 (regularly $179) at select Starbucks stores and on Verismo.com; This includes a Verismo® V Brewer, Verismo® Milk Frother and free 12-count box of Verismo® pods of your choice. Also available on Verismo.com. The Verismo® V Brewer is available for $99 (regularly $149) with a free 12-count box of Verismo® pods of choice, and the Verismo® Milk Frother is available for $39 (regularly $59). Also available on Verisimo.com. Those discounts make this system a strong option right now.\nDisclaimer: We were loaned a Verismo System for review purposes. We also received four boxes of pods. ",

      "text": "Trades from $ 3 On Nov 22, we issued an updated research report on coffee chain giant Starbucks Corporation ( SBUX - Free Report ) .Starbucks’ shares have lost approximately 1.2% year to date due to several macro issues. Although the stock has partially recovered, it lags the broader market. Pros Starbucks is one of the most recognized coffee brands in the world. From espresso to specialty roast and ground coffee to premium single-serve market, Starbucks enjoys a leading position in all coffee segments. It is the number one premium packaged coffee brand in America. Further, management focuses on increasing its global market share through store openings in new and existing markets, remodeling of existing stores, deploying technology, controlling costs and aggressive product innovation and brand building.Recently, Starbucks concluded fiscal 2016 on a solid note. The company reported better-than-expected results in the fourth quarter with earnings and revenues increasing 30.2% and 16% year over year, respectively, buoyed by strong sales and margin expansion (up 180 basis points or bps). Higher sales in the U.S. and China/Asia Pacific division have counterbalanced a slowdown in the Europe, Middle East, and Africa (“EMEA”) segment.Starbucks is working on technological innovation to strengthen its brand, improve efficiency and in-store execution and boost profits. Its Mobile Order & Pay service now represents nearly 6% of the total U.S. transactions as of Oct 2, 2016, up from 5% in the prior quarter.The Mobile Order & Pay service allows customers to order before arriving at a Starbucks café and pick up the items at the store, thus saving on time. The service is witnessing increased usage and could prove to be a key growth driver going ahead. Starbucks has also deployed the facility in many of its stores in the U.K. and Canada with plans to continue rolling out the platform in key international markets.Again, Starbucks’ Channel Development or CPG business has become a fast growing and highly profitable business. This segment’s operating margin rose 390 bps in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. Cons Economic, geopolitical and consumer headwinds continue to impact Starbucks’ results. Meanwhile, the company’s EMEA segment has been experiencing sluggish performance. During the fourth quarter, Starbucks posted negative 1% comp growth in the EMEA region and a 12% decline in revenues due to the ongoing macro and consumer challenges, and a shift toward more licensed stores along with currency headwinds. Comparable store sales or comps were flat in fiscal 2016 versus 4% growth in fiscal 2015.In Europe, economic/political conditions are anticipated to be challenging after U.K.’s exit from the 28-member economic bloc. As it is, business in Europe is clouded by the economic uncertainties in the Northern region and deflation in the Eurozone.High inflation rates and currency devaluation are hurting sales in Latin America, especially Brazil and Argentina. Moreover, the slowing down of the Chinese economy and concerns about Japan, owing to a weaker yen and tax increases, are adding to the restaurateurs’ woes. Zacks Rank & Key Picks Starbucks carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Better-ranked stocks in the restaurant space include The Cheesecake Factory Incorporated ( CAKE - Free Report ) , Darden Restaurants, Inc. ( DRI - Free Report ) and McDonald's Corporation ( MCD - Free Report ) .All three companies carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here .Darden Restaurants’ current year growth rate is pegged at 10.9% while that for Cheesecake Factory is 19.5% and McDonald’s is 14%.

      "text": "  \n(Facebook/ Pokemon) Promotional image for \"Pokemon Go\" \nThe most recent rumors regarding the possible arrival of \"Pokemon Go's\" second generation are surprisingly hinting at a potential partnership between Starbucks and Pokemon. The leaked information allegedly came from a Starbucks staff who received a written internal memo detailing the upcoming \"Pokemon Frapuccino\" and its alleged release date. \nThe document outlines some of the promotional activities that Starbucks will undertake for the months of November and December. The series of events will culminate with the launching of the \"Pokemon Version 2\" on Dec. 7. \nThere is also mention of lures that will be made available at all Starbucks stores some time between January to February. However, there is no telling if the said document is authentic. It is not enough to confirm an actual partnership and the arrival of a new version of the game. \nThe possible partnership with Starbucks is most likely a strategy to attract players back to the game. Just recently, \"Pokemon Go\" released a Halloween and Thanksgiving event together with new spawn locations and daily bonuses that apparently worked in terms of luring players back to the game. Advertisement \nThe game experienced a dip a few months back that compelled its developer, Niantic, to come up with something new to create momentum again. \nNevertheless, some gaming fans are inclined to believe the alleged leak may be true. It will come as no surprise to them at all if new Pokemon characters start appearing near Starbucks stores when Dec. 7 arrives. \nOnly then will fans be able to affirm that the Starbucks staff who posted the document was indeed telling the truth. At present, the Reddit post has already been removed and what remains are the comments that some users posted. Both Niantic and Starbucks have yet to comment on the supposed partnership. \nAs for the much-anticipated second generation of \"Pokemon Go,\" there is no formal announcement released from the game developers yet. Should it arrive anytime soon, Niantic will surely make initial announcements for the benefit of the game's avid followers.  ",

      "text": "  Bryn Mooth | November 23, 2016 \nThink YOU have a challenging workload? Every two months, Starbucks launches a new in-store promotion in more than 23,000 stores around the world. All-new design concepts, all-new creative output … every eight weeks … 52 weeks a year. The work doesn’t stop. \nHow does the Starbucks creative team pull it off? Collaboration is the key. And they’ll talk about how it all happens at HOW Design Live . Dena Blevins, Creative Director Global Promotions & Brand will head up a panel discussion with her Starbucks colleagues, Account Director Melissa Bush, Creative Director Steve Murray, VP Jeffrey Fields and VP Nancy Poznoff titled Building a Strong Brand Through Collaboration . \nAs the brand shifts its seasonal look from a “Pumpkin Spice” fall theme to wintery holiday imagery, we asked Blevins about what it’s like to maintain creative energy amid a constant workflow and how collaboration is key. She describes the office as fast-moving, busy and intense — but “we play nice,” Blevins says. “We have a lot of respect and love for each other.” \nThroughout the studio area, she says, you’ll find artists and designers painting, sketching, printing, creating all the artwork for promotions, packaging and products. Each season brings a new aesthetic to the Starbucks look. And, as you might expect, there’s coffee. Lots of it. Coffee stations in every aisle, with grinders, scales, gadgets to make the perfect pour-over cup. “It smells amazing!” Blevins raves. Part of a summer campaign to promote new and old flavors of the customer-favorite Frappuccino \nHow is the company’s creative function organized? Roughly how many creative staffers work there, and how is the team structured? The Starbucks Global Creative studio is part of the marketing organization. We have a team of about 160 — composed of talented designers, writers, illustrators, pre-press specialists and producers. The creative team is divided into two main groups that report into two Vice Presidents that support different aspects of the business. One VP supports advertising, brand, promotional work, and visual merchandising. The other VP supports merchandise design, packaging, Starbucks Reserve & Roastery. One thing to note too, this work includes our other brands as well: Teavana, Evolution Fresh and Tazo. \nTell us about your team’s work — I assume that you touch EVERYTHING, from coffee sleeves to seasonal store decor to merchandise. Yes, my team supports the brand work and all of the in-store promotional work you see in our stores around the world. I have one team that supports brand work, two teams that support promotional work for retail North America, one team that supports international promotions, and one team that supports Teavana promotions. In promotions, there are certain times of the year that the we affect almost everything in our stores — specifically our annual holiday promotion. The store signage completely flips: everything from menus, to banners, to our shopping bags, and most importantly our iconic red cups that signal the beginning of the holiday season. Every year, I am so proud of the work our studio produces. Every year I feel like it is our best work ever — and I feel that way again right now. Our holiday promotion just launched in our stores, our red cups are being carried in customer’s hands around the world — it is really incredible! I love my job. Above and below: Part of Starbucks fall campaign celebrating all things autumnal; artist Victor Melendez created the seasonal illustrations \nThe theme of your panel presentation is collaboration — how does your team embrace a culture of collaboration? And how does that enable you to produce the enormous volume of work you do? Yes, collaboration is so key. Working in our creative studio here is very different than my experience working at a typical ad agency. We collaborate across functions and across teams. We have our “clients” down the hall, our marketing partners, and we’re all equally passionate about the brand, and doing what’s right for our brand. We think long term, not short term, and consider how the decisions we make affect every aspect of our business. Will it resonate with our customers? Does it elevate our brand? Does it make our partners (baristas) proud? Starbucks commissioned Seattle artist Shogo Ota to create an illustration (a single line) on the windows for its flagship stores in NYC and Seattle; he also illustrated a limited-edition green cup to signify human connection \nWhat’s your team’s biggest challenge, and how do you work to overcome it? Timelines. As a company, we try to be nimble, and make shifts in strategies and businesses as needed — and that can cause timelines to get crunched. So, our biggest challenge is trying to do our best work in the time allowed. That can lead to pulling in people from other teams to help out—again, that’s the importance of collaboration. We divide and conquer. Once our work is out in the world, it is truly a team effort. \nEven if you don’t work with a brand as massive as Starbucks, you can learn from the team’s experience about how to manage your project load, how to work with colleagues and how to stay inspired year ’round.

      "text": "SKU: IRTNTR10924   report identifies players like JDE, Keurig Green Mountain, Nestlé, and Starbucks to be the key vendors in the global instant coffee market. This research report also presents a detailed segmentation of the market by product (spray-drying, and freeze-drying), distribution channel (department stores, hypermarkets, and supermarkets, convenience stores, specialty stores, and online retail), and by geography (the Americas, APAC, Europe, and MEA). Overview of the global instant coffee market Technavio’s market research analyst predicts the global instant coffee market to grow at a CAGR of almost 6% between 2016 and 2020. Changing lifestyle and consumption patterns of time-pressed consumers are increasing the demand for coffee . The convenient preparation of instant coffee and its availability in multiple flavors and formats are the most significant factors driving growth in this market. Also, the shelf life of instant coffee is longer than that of ground coffee because it is in a powder texture. Several well-known coffee brands are marketing instant coffees as specialty coffees, which has widened the scope for this market. For instance, Nestlé has come up with a Barista style instant coffee, Azera. Starbucks has also introduced many different flavors for consumers. Some manufacturers are making constant innovations in the product segment in terms of aroma, flavor, and color of instant coffee, which will inevitably attract more consumers. In terms of geography, Europe accounts for the largest share in the global market where the UK, Turkey, Belarus, and Ukraine are the leading instant coffee-consuming countries. The region depends mainly on imports to meet the growing demand as the harsh climatic conditions restricts the cultivation of coffee. Russia is the most prominent market for instant coffee, and the easy availability of three-in-one coffee sachets are propelling more consumption among contemporary Russian consumers. With several manufacturers setting up instant coffee-based vending machines in convenience stores, offices, and high-traffic public areas, the market in Europe will witness huge growth in the coming years.

So I am officially launching the media war on Christmas. Let’s meet at George soros’s home to gather weaponry.” \nI’m a Pagan and it was our holiday first, but alright, let’s play. After all, as the retail industry has proved, again and again, you can never start early enough. So Hooah ! \nStarbucks is there already. They unveiled their new green holiday cup on November 1. Who can forget the red holiday cup controversy of 2015 , the infamous “Satan Sippers”? \n(This author has one in his collection. My local Starbucks told me the brouhaha had made them collector’s items. Gets yours early as a symbol of whatever, or just as a sign that you’re thirsty.) \nAccording to Starbucks, \n“The green cup and the design represent the connections Starbucks has as a community with its partners (employees) and customers. During a divisive time in our country, Starbucks wanted to create a symbol of unity as a reminder of our shared values, and the need to be good to each other,” said Howard Schultz, chairman and CEO. \nAwe. Well, that’s just so hateful. What about baby Jesus? \nCNN’s MoneyStream senior editor David Goldman winks at us with the answer : Starbucks' new holiday cups are green, because Starbucks hates baby Jesus #waronchristmas https://t.co/l871MWBvv0 pic.twitter.com/GKuKUHkqxB \n— David Goldman (@DavidGoldmanCNN) November 1, 2016 \nYes. Editors are paid to know these things. \nEsquire’s Matt Miller humorously observes that, \n“Confusingly enough, some seem to believe that the red (which did not represent Christmas last year), should be brought back to these green cups to make them more Christmas-y.” \nOh dear. \nIt’s a cup. You drink out of it. You don’t hang it from your tree unless you’re celebrating the birth of coffee. As Katherine Timpf of The National Review and Fox News put it in response to the fuss over the new green cup, Unless a Starbucks cup is \nA) Threatening to murder you &B) Somehow seems to have the ability to do so \nThen some of you are overreacting \n— Katherine Timpf (@KatTimpf) November 2, 2016 \nWith all the green and red being flashed around this time of the year, the idea that because a cup is red or green somebody hates Jesus is as absurd as the idea that Donald Trump is an honest man.",

FBI spokesman Frank Fisher said one of them “caused minimal damage” to one of the stores.\n“Nobody was injured,” he said.\nThe store that was minimally damaged was the Starbucks in Nob Hill at Central and Tulane. Another store near Gibson and San Mateo was also vandalized, while the third vandalized store was at Lomas and Washington.\nImages from surveillance footage released by the FBI show the suspect at the Starbucks on Lomas. Fisher asked anyone with information to call the FBI at 505-889-1300.\n— This is a developing story. More information will be added as it becomes available.\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading",

      "text": "Feds, police investigate vandalism at 3 Starbucks locations Updated 26 min ago \nALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) — Three Starbucks locations in New Mexico's most populous city were cordoned off and surrounded by police vehicles early Friday as federal and local authorities investigated reports of vandalism at the coffee shops. \nSuspicious devices were placed inside the stores sometime after midnight, and one of them caused minimal damage, FBI spokesman Frank Fisher said. The shops were closed at the time, and no one was injured. \nFisher did not provide any details about the devices but noted that the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives was helping investigate. \nStarbucks said in an email Friday that its local team was working with law enforcement. Company officials confirmed what they understood to be arson at the three stores but they were still waiting for more details. \n\"We are relieved there are no reported injuries,\" the statement said. \nAt least one of the stores had opened its drive-thru to customers in the morning as shoppers fanned out across the city for Black Friday, one of the busiest shopping days of the year. \nOne of the locations was along historic Route 66 in Albuquerque's Nob Hill neighborhood. The other two were just a few miles away. \nAuthorities released an image from a security camera at one of the stores showing a suspect entering as broken glass from the shattered front door covered the entrance. The suspect was dressed in dark clothing and appeared to be holding something. \nAuthorities were asking anyone with information about the incidents to call the FBI in New Mexico or submit tips online .

Officers responded just after midnight to various Starbucks locations to reports of suspicious devices and vandalism. \nThe Albuquerque Police Department has confirmed three separate devices detonated at three different Starbucks locations throughout the city early Friday morning. \nA picture just released from the FBI shows their suspect from the incident at the Lomas Starbucks. Officers also responded to the Gibson location in southeast Albuquerque. \nThe FBI and the ATF are investigating the small devices left at the coffee shops. APD is assisting in the investigation. \nAPD was unable to say whether the devices went off inside or outside the building. They did send out their bomb squad to the scene Friday. \nMany people in the area surrounding these Starbucks were put on high alert after the incident saying those detonations were loud enough for them to hear. \nEmployees at a store near one of the affected locations say they’re shocked someone would do something like this on a busy day like Black Friday. \nIf you have any information, you’re asked to call the Albuquerque FBI branch. 3 #ABQ Starbucks vandalized, suspicious devices found.

In addition to all those red-cupped peppermint mochas and gingerbread lattes, the coffee company is serving up some pretty tasty eats and treats, and you can definitely expect some new offerings this year.\nWe can always count on some staples from the Starbucks holiday line-up: cranberry bliss bars (which you can buy by the case to truly fuel that addiction), that adorbs frosted snowman cookie, and the gingerbread loaf, and all of those are of course there and accounted for, but this year we've also got a few new items to get excited about.\n© Provided by Delish As far as baked goods go, expect to see the cranberry bliss bar, frosted snowman cookie, holiday ugly sweater cookie, gingerbread loaf, peppermint brownie cake pop, and a snowman cake pop. They will also be offering two new sandwiches, including the All The Trimmings Breakfast Sandwich (maple-glazed ham, an apple sausage patty, apple-sage stuffing, and savory maple glaze on a buttery bun) and a Carved Ham, Egg, and Swiss Breakfast Sandwich on a croissant. While the croissant will be available in most stores across the U.S., the All The Trimmings sandwich will only be offered in Seattle, Florida, and some stores in California. But on the bright side-you can ease your sandwich suffering with the returning classic Holiday Turkey and Stuffing Panini.\n© Provided by Delish Follow Delish on Instagram .\nNow watch: 9 ways to save money at Starbucks\nReplay Video Play Pause Seek i Volume Volume Volume Mute Unmute CC SETTINGS OFF HQ HD HQ SD LO Full Screen Exit Full Screen Play Pause Volume Volume\nGo to MSN Home",

      "text": "Feds, police investigate vandalism at 3 Starbucks locations Updated 9 hrs ago \nALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) — Three Starbucks locations in New Mexico's most populous city were cordoned off and surrounded by police vehicles early Friday as federal and local authorities investigated reports of vandalism at the coffee shops. \nSuspicious devices were placed inside the stores sometime after midnight, and one of them caused minimal damage, FBI spokesman Frank Fisher said. The shops were closed at the time, and no one was injured. \nFisher did not provide any details about the devices but noted that the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives was helping investigate. \nStarbucks said in an email Friday that its local team was working with law enforcement. Company officials confirmed what they understood to be arson at the three stores but they were still waiting for more details. \n\"We are relieved there are no reported injuries,\" the statement said. \nAt least one of the stores had opened its drive-thru to customers in the morning as shoppers fanned out across the city for Black Friday, one of the busiest shopping days of the year.

The other two were just a few miles away. \nAuthorities released an image from a security camera at one of the stores showing a suspect entering as broken glass from the shattered front door covered the entrance. The suspect was dressed in dark clothing and appeared to be holding something. \nAuthorities were asking anyone with information about the incidents to call the FBI in New Mexico or submit tips online .

      "text": " \nALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (KRQE)- Broken glass and bullet holes are what’s left behind at the Starbucks on Central Avenue. One of three Starbucks locations targeted in the city early Friday morning.\nA Starbucks on Lomas, and another on Gibson also suffered major damage from vandals that broke into the coffee shops. Albuquerque police have released a photo of the suspect, but the FBI has now taken over the investigation.\nThis is just the latest in a series of suspicious events in Nob Hill in recent days. A fire left devastating damage at The Carlisle , a new building full of condos that was expected to open next month.\nA pro-life ministry was also the victim of a damaging fire on San Mateo.\n“I just thought, more of the same,” said a man who works at Red Wings, looking at the scene outside the Starbucks on Central early Friday morning.\nMany people in Nob Hill are fed up with the recent events, especially with the neighborhood already facing challenges from the Albuquerque Rapid Transit project.\n“We had the fire two blocks down the street last week, that’s all blocked off and then this,” said the Red Wings employee.\nBut plenty of shop owners in Nob Hill are trying to stay optimistic as they gear up for the holidays.\n“We just are not letting anything get us down,” said Michele Schuch the owner of Schushop on Carlisle.\nSchuch’s business looks onto The Carlisle project that was burned to a crisp.\n“My business is my livelihood, so I look at it like, I don’t have a choice, I’m not going to complain, I try to remain positive,” said Schuch.\nThe staff at Ooh Aah in Nob Hill said what keeps them going, “Honestly, it’s our customers,” said Dallas Ulibarri, the store’s manager. She said the fires and the vandalism is something they’ll move past.\n“When ART started, we had customers come in and they would say, ‘we’re coming because we wanna see you survive everything that’s happening in the neighborhood,” said Ulibarri.\nBut, no matter what, Ulibariri said as a business and a community, they know they’ll be okay.\n“I think it takes a lot for this neighborhood to get knocked down.”",

      "text": "Feds, police investigate vandalism at 3 Starbucks locations Updated 6 hrs ago ( … ) \nALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) — Three Starbucks locations in New Mexico's most populous city were cordoned off and surrounded by police vehicles early Friday as federal and local authorities investigated reports of vandalism at the coffee shops. \nSuspicious devices were placed inside the stores sometime after midnight, and one of them caused minimal damage, FBI spokesman Frank Fisher said. The shops were closed at the time, and no one was injured. \nFisher did not provide any details about the devices but noted that the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives was helping investigate. \nStarbucks said in an email Friday that its local team was working with law enforcement. Company officials confirmed what they understood to be arson at the three stores but they were still waiting for more details. \n\"We are relieved there are no reported injuries,\" the statement said. \nAt least one of the stores had opened its drive-thru to customers in the morning as shoppers fanned out across the city for Black Friday, one of the busiest shopping days of the year. \nOne of the locations was along historic Route 66 in Albuquerque's Nob Hill neighborhood. The other two were just a few miles away. \nAuthorities released an image from a security camera at one of the stores showing a suspect entering as broken glass from the shattered front door covered the entrance. The suspect was dressed in dark clothing and appeared to be holding something. \nAuthorities were asking anyone with information about the incidents to call the FBI in New Mexico or submit tips online .

      "text": "Starbucks' (SBUX) Initiatives Impress, Macro Woes Remain November 24, 2016, 06:33:00 AM EDT By Zacks Equity Research, Zacks.com Shutterstock photo \nOn Nov 22, we issued an updated research report on coffee chain giant Starbucks Corporation SBUX . Starbucks' shares have lost approximately 1.2% year to date due to several macro issues. Although the stock has partially recovered, it lags the broader market. Pros Starbucks is one of the most recognized coffee brands in the world. From espresso to specialty roast and ground coffee to premium single-serve market, Starbucks enjoys a leading position in all coffee segments. It is the number one premium packaged coffee brand in America. Further, management focuses on increasing its global market share through store openings in new and existing markets, remodeling of existing stores, deploying technology, controlling costs and aggressive product innovation and brand building. Recently, Starbucks concluded fiscal 2016 on a solid note. The company reported better-than-expected results in the fourth quarter with earnings and revenues increasing 30.2% and 16% year over year, respectively, buoyed by strong sales and margin expansion (up 180 basis points or bps). Higher sales in the U.S. and China/Asia Pacific division have counterbalanced a slowdown in the Europe, Middle East, and Africa (\"EMEA\") segment. Starbucks is working on technological innovation to strengthen its brand, improve efficiency and in-store execution and boost profits. Its Mobile Order & Pay service now represents nearly 6% of the total U.S. transactions as of Oct 2, 2016, up from 5% in the prior quarter. The Mobile Order & Pay service allows customers to order before arriving at a Starbucks café and pick up the items at the store, thus saving on time. The service is witnessing increased usage and could prove to be a key growth driver going ahead. Starbucks has also deployed the facility in many of its stores in the U.K. and Canada with plans to continue rolling out the platform in key international markets. Again, Starbucks' Channel Development or CPG business has become a fast growing and highly profitable business. This segment's operating margin rose 390 bps in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. Cons Economic, geopolitical and consumer headwinds continue to impact Starbucks' results. Meanwhile, the company's EMEA segment has been experiencing sluggish performance. During the fourth quarter, Starbucks posted negative 1% comp growth in the EMEA region and a 12% decline in revenues due to the ongoing macro and consumer challenges, and a shift toward more licensed stores along with currency headwinds. Comparable store sales or comps were flat in fiscal 2016 versus 4% growth in fiscal 2015. In Europe, economic/political conditions are anticipated to be challenging after U.K.'s exit from the 28-member economic bloc. As it is, business in Europe is clouded by the economic uncertainties in the Northern region and deflation in the Eurozone. High inflation rates and currency devaluation are hurting sales in Latin America, especially Brazil and Argentina. Moreover, the slowing down of the Chinese economy and concerns about Japan, owing to a weaker yen and tax increases, are adding to the restaurateurs' woes. Zacks Rank & Key Picks Starbucks carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Better-ranked stocks in the restaurant space include The Cheesecake Factory Incorporated CAKE , Darden Restaurants, Inc. DRI and McDonald's Corporation MCD . All three companies carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here . Darden Restaurants' current year growth rate is pegged at 10.9% while that for Cheesecake Factory is 19.5% and McDonald's is 14%.

      "text": "Posted November 25 2016 — 9:28 PM EST See also Eleven from 'Stranger Things' crushes Nicki Minaj's 'Monster' verse \nHello from the Upside Down. \nStranger Things star Millie Bobby Brown livened up a recent trip through the Starbucks drive-thru with her dad by singing her order in a parody of Adele’s “Hello.” In a video she posted to Twitter on Friday, Brown can be seen leaning over from the passenger seat and belting out, “Can I have a venti latte / And a caramel frappuccino? / Oh please!” \nAlthough she’s best known for playing a psychokinetic preteen on Netflix’s hit sci-fi series, Brown is no stranger to rocking the mic. She has a history of winning the internet with her fun videos by performing hits by artists such as Adele and Beyoncé, and she once demonstrated on The Tonight Show that she can rap Nicki Minaj’s “Monster” verse with aplomb. \n— Millie Bobby Brown (@milliebbrown) November 26, 2016 \nCheck out her Adele parody above.

      "text": "When it comes to switching up a drive-thru order, major kudos goes to Stranger Things' Millie Bobby-Brown, who turned the process into a musical extravaganza. We already know she could rap, thanks to that awesome 'Monster' cover she did on The Tonight Show, but thanks to a recent social media post, we now know Eleven can SANNGGG as well. Exactly like another British sweetheart who has become a major sensation Stateside... Millie was with her dad at a Starbucks drive-thru when she went to order a large latte and a caramel frappuccino. So far so normal, right? Only, this time, she decided to mix 'Things' up, by singing her order to the tune of Adele's hit 'Hello'. Have we seen a 'Stranger Thing'? Probably not, but remind us to try this with our next Chicken Legend order because the results would probably be hilarious. Adventures at Starbucks with my daddy #hellofromtheupsidedown #keepcalmimparked #fatheranddaughterbanter @adele A video posted by Millie Bobby Brown (@milliebobby_brown) on Nov 25, 2016 at 5:07pm PST In the video, Millie can be seen leaning over her dad to deliver the vocally-tight-if-bizarre request. \"Hello from the UPSIIDDEE DOOWNNN,\" sang Millie, \"Can I have a venti latte / And a caramel frappuccino? / Oh please!\" Her dad then stopped the singing and confirmed the order, before telling Millie that the unsuspecting drive-thru employee is probably not a fan. \"She nearly shut the window, that's how much she hates ya,\" said Millie's dad. \"Yeah she don't like ya.\" LOL. No worries, Mills, we're totally fans here at Digital Spy, and the incident has got us thinking about more Adele food-related covers, such as 'When We Were Young Hungry' and 'Rolling in the (Maccie) D's'.

In addition to all those red-cupped peppermint mochas and gingerbread lattes, the coffee company is serving up some pretty tasty eats and treats, and you can definitely expect some new offerings this year.\nWe can always count on some staples from the Starbucks holiday line-up: cranberry bliss bars (which you can buy by the case to truly fuel that addiction), that adorbs frosted snowman cookie, and the gingerbread loaf, and all of those are of course there and accounted for, but this year we've also got a few new items to get excited about.\n© Provided by Delish As far as baked goods go, expect to see the cranberry bliss bar, frosted snowman cookie, holiday ugly sweater cookie, gingerbread loaf, peppermint brownie cake pop, and a snowman cake pop. They will also be offering two new sandwiches, including the All The Trimmings Breakfast Sandwich (maple-glazed ham, an apple sausage patty, apple-sage stuffing, and savory maple glaze on a buttery bun) and a Carved Ham, Egg, and Swiss Breakfast Sandwich on a croissant. While the croissant will be available in most stores across the U.S., the All The Trimmings sandwich will only be offered in Seattle, Florida, and some stores in California. But on the bright side-you can ease your sandwich suffering with the returning classic Holiday Turkey and Stuffing Panini.\n© Provided by Delish Follow Delish on Instagram .\nNow watch: 9 ways to save money at Starbucks\nReplay Video Play Pause Seek i Volume Volume Volume Mute Unmute CC SETTINGS OFF HQ HD HQ SD LO Full Screen Exit Full Screen Play Pause Volume Volume\nGo to MSN Home",

One went off and caused minimal damage, the FBI’s local office tweeted.\nAll three stores were closed at the time and no one was injured, the FBI said.\nThe person in custody has not been named, and no motive has been given.\nThe FBI, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives and the Albuquerque police and fire departments are investigating.\nA Starbucks spokesperson told CNN the company was working closely with investigating authorities. “We are relieved that the stores were closed at the time of the incidents, and there are no reports of any injuries,” the spokesperson said.\nCNN affiliate KOAT is reporting that multiple incidents, including a fire early Saturday at an Old Navy, may be connected.",

      "title": "‘Stranger Things’ Eleven Sings Her Starbucks Order To Adele",
      "text": "\nYoung star Millie Bobby Brown behind Stranger Things ‘ Eleven is incredibly funny in real life—and singing her Starbucks order to Adele’s Hello is only one of her many hilarious skits.\nMillie Bobby Brown is an astounding actress, as we have seen in her flawless and spine-tingling portrayal of Eleven in hit Netflix series Stranger Things. If you’ve been following Bobby Brown on TV and on the internet, then you’re sure no stranger to her hilarious things (get the pun? of course!). Bobby Brown has appeared in various television shows since Stranger Things took off and has been very active on her social media accounts, too.\nLove and light ???? pic.twitter.com/o0Zlp6hU7v \n— Millie Bobby Brown (@milliebbrown) November 24, 2016 \nIf you haven’t been following the Stranger Things actress on Instagram (why?!) or just failed to check her out this week, then you must know she’s up to some terribly hilarious things again. This time pulling pranks with her dad, Digital Spy reports that our favorite Eleven is showcasing her mad voice skills again—but this time, on a Starbucks drive-thru. Basically just another normal day for the very normal Millie Bobby Brown. Millie revealed earlier that she started loving singing at a very young age.\nThe Instagram video shows the young Stranger Things star with her dad, going through a Starbucks drive-thru window. Millie then leans over her dad to get closer to the window and belt out her coffee orders to the tune of Adele’s record-breaking Hello. Her coffee song goes:\nHello from the UPSIIDDEE DOOWNNN~\nCan I have a venti latte / And a caramel frappuccino? / Oh please!\nMillie’s dad then cuts her and confirms the order to the Starbucks barista, who seems like she doesn’t recognize the young star from Stranger Things at all! If Millie Bobby Brown’s coffee song was not strange enough, then there’s definitely no stranger thing than someone not knowing about Stranger Things’ Eleven! She’s basically everywhere, these days (especially last Halloween)!\nMillie’s dad then teases her:\nShe nearly shut the window, that’s how much she hates you. Yeah, she don’t like you.\nWatching the video for the first time gave me so much chills—one because Millie trying so hard is so hilarious; and two, because her voice is just phenomenal. See for yourself in the video below:\nAdventures at Starbucks with my daddy #hellofromtheupsidedown #keepcalmimparked #fatheranddaughterbanter @adele \nA video posted by Millie Bobby Brown (@milliebobby_brown) on Nov 25, 2016 at 5:07pm PST \n\nMillie Bobby Brown is hilarious hands down, and the Stranger Things star would constantly post on Instagram her many adventures. In two more of Bobby Brown’s Instagram videos, she showcases her dancing skills.\nIn one video, she is dancing with Todrick Hall to Ariana Grande’s Into You. In the other one, we see her trying for a pun, where our Stranger Things’ Eleven dances to Beyoncé’s 7/11.\n(null) (made by @ milliebrown70 with @musical.ly) ♬ Into You – Ariana Grande . #musicallyapp #ArianaGrande #IntoYou #music #musicvideo #musical #musica #followme #bestoftheday #instadaily with my fave @todrick \nA video posted by Millie Bobby Brown (@milliebobby_brown) on Oct 24, 2016 at 6:57pm PDT \n\nBeing 12 is so much fun! ❤️ #younglife #youthful #embrace \nA video posted by Millie Bobby Brown (@milliebobby_brown) on Sep 5, 2016 at 9:41pm PDT \n\nHere’s also another video where Millie tries to channel her inner Stranger Things’ Eleven to skip having to do the push ups her trainer asks her to do.\nEleven in the gym with her powers! #Mark #boxingrules #strangerthings @phoenixmma_bournemouth \nA video posted by Millie Bobby Brown (@milliebobby_brown) on Aug 25, 2016 at 5:23am PDT \n\nMillie Bobby Brown has gone through so much ever since her role as Eleven in Stranger Things and with that huge talent of hers and her even bigger heart, she is poised to take over Hollywood in no time.\nSeason 2 of Stranger Things have already been confirmed and while Eleven was blasted off to magic dust in the last season, we know she’s coming back in season 2, Inquisitr reports. We have no idea, at the moment, however, in what form does Eleven come back in season 2 of Stranger Things, or if she’s being renewed as a season regular at all. Well we do know that one of the biggest selling points of Stranger Things remains to be Eleven so it’s unwise for the Duffer brothers to not give her the exposure time she deserves.\n011 is back! It's official, can't wait to be back working with this lovely cast again for #strangerthings thank you to the amazing duffer brothers for having el back for a second season!❤️ \nA photo posted by Millie Bobby Brown (@milliebobby_brown) on Nov 4, 2016 at 10:32am PDT \n\nSeason 2 of Stranger Things will hope to uncover more about the upside down, about Eleven’s powers, and about Will possibly carrying a Demogorgon inside of him (as teased in the last episode of last season). It’s scheduled to release around July of 2017.\nIn the meantime, you can watch more hilarious moments of Stranger Things’ Eleven in the video below.\n[Featured image by Mike Coppola/Getty Images]\n‘Stranger Things’ Eleven Sings Her Starbucks Order To Adele is an article from: The Inquisitr News \n",

      "text": "ALBUQUERQUE, Nov. 27 (UPI) -- One person is in custody after suspicious devices were found at three vandalized Starbucks, including one that detonated and caused minimal damage to a franchise in southeast Albuquerue.\nThe FBI announced the arrest Saturday after the incidents occurred early Friday.\nThe FBI, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, and the Albuquerque Police and Fire Departments are investigating. The individual arrested hasn't been named.\nBefore the arrest, the FBI released photos from surveillance video of a suspect involved in the incident at one of the stores.\nAll three stores have since reopened, despite multiple windows having apparent bullet holes.\nGlass doors at some of the locations were shattered.\n\"We heard gunshots go off. At least four rounds of gunshots go off, and then we heard a large explosion,\" a witness who lives near the Starbucks in Albuquerque's Nob Hill told KOAT-TV . \"It was like a big flash -- like, orange and white -- just smoke everywhere.\"\nAnother witness said he saw a person get into a car and drive away.\n\"We saw an individual approach the Starbucks before the explosion, and he threw something towards the window, and then the explosion went off,\" said the witness.\nTwo other suspicious fires occurred in the area earlier in the week.\nAfter new condominiums went up in flames, Albuquerque firefighters called the incident suspicious. The FBI is also looking into another fire around the same time at a pro-life ministry.\n  Car bomb in Somalia kills at least 11 At least 57 Shiite pilgrims dead in Iraq truck bomb explosion Couple charged with plot to blow up school, shoot cops, rob bank",

      "text": "snow Share this article \nWith Starbucks releasing their red Christmas cups and Dedman playing Christmas music, it appears that the holidays have begun. Whether you agree “the most wonderful time of the year” has begun or you believe the holidays are still around the corner, we all start to anticipate budgeting our money on gifts, celebrations, and of course, decorations. But there is no need to tap into that gift giving fund in order to make your home look the part this year. With these easy and affordable decorations, your house (or dorm room!) will look just as cheerful as your bank account. \nWe understand that you cannot deck out every inch of the house for the holidays like the inhabitants of Whoville in “The Grinch,” so pick main spots you or guests will see the most. Decorate main entrances with cutouts of snowflakes tied to string, a single role of white streamers or festive white lights that can be found on Amazon for only $8.99! \nDo not be a “cotton headed ninnny muggins” this year. Take Buddy the Elf’s strategy and utilize edible decorations from the four main food groups: “Candy, candy canes, candy corn, and syrup.” We suggest filling festive colored bowls with candy, spreading red and green salt water taffies across a table, or tying candy canes to a continuous string and displaying them across a plain wall or fire place. \nWe all have seen “Christmas Vacation” and understand that not every house is meant to fit a tree. But the holiday must go on, so take some festive gold and green ribbon, sticky tape or tacks, and follow a zig zag pattern along a wall to create the image of a tree. If you want to continue “Rocking Around the Christmas Tree” tack up all your friend’s Christmas cards along the ribbon as ornaments, or string some lights along the wall for some sparkle. If you create your tree in an area with plenty of space, place any wrapped presents you have along the base of the wall, under your tree. \nDon’t have wall space? Then bring the outdoors in with a simple yard search and some green paint. Simply find pinecones and paint them green with a paintbrush or simply dip the entire pinecone in paint, let it dry, and there you have it: mini Christmas trees to display anywhere from the dinner table to the bathroom counter. If you have extra time, make it a “White Christmas” and add some white paint to the tips, or dash some silver sparkles on the tips of each pinecone. \nTurn any average white door or fridge into Frosty the Snowman with some paper and scissors. Cut two large black circles for eyes, five smaller circles to form a mouth, and three additional small circles for the buttons on his stomach. Duct tape the circles on the door as they would appear on any snowman and cut out an orange triangle for his nose. If you want to be on Santa’s Nice List, you should finish off the look by cutting one long strip of red or green paper, and two smaller strips that make a scarf to keep your snowman looking sharp. \nLet more than Rudoplh’s nose shine bright this Christmas and add some sugar and spice to items already in your home. Fill any candle holders or clear jars with raw cranberries or other red items. This will add a festive look to any table without screaming “Santa’s coming!” \nIf you have any trees in your front yard or plants within your home, instantly create a “Winter Wonderland” by hanging traditional plastic ornaments off branches. Cheap ornaments can be found in Target, Walmart, or any basic drugstore for as little as $5 per package. Feeling naughty? Get messy by purchasing clear ornaments, and filling them with paint to create your own, uniquely designed Christmas decorations. \nWith these easy, budget friendly decorating ideas, it is impossible to not get involved in the holiday cheer. Whether you have already embraced the Christmas spirit or plan to hold off until December, remember than you do not have to break the bank to make your home look Martha Stewart worthy this holiday season. Just make sure your guests do not get their tinsel in a tangle when they realize how easy it was to turn your home into Santa’s workshop. You Might Also Enjoy",

The young actress shared a video of herself belting out a coffee order in the style of Adele's \"Hello.\" \n“Can I have a venti latte / And a caramel frappuccino? / Oh, please!” she can be heard singing below, swapping her words in place of the original lyric, \"Hello from the other side / I must have called a thousand times / To tell you...,\" and then covering her face as though in disbelief she actually did it. \nIt's unclear how the Starbucks employee reacted to the serenade, since she seemed focused on just trying to make sure she heard the order correctly. \nCheck out the spontaneous performance.",

      "text": "Starbucks Just Released a Cup That Will Prevent Your Coffee From Going Cold Ever Again PopSugar 9 hrs ago Terry Carter © Provided by PopSugar What Is the Ember Mug?\nSay goodbye to lukewarm Pumpkin Spice Lattes this Winter. Starbucks has teamed up with Ember, the company behind the Ember Mug , a smartphone-controlled coffee mug designed to keep your coffee heated to your desired temperature all day long.\nAccording to Inc., the cup works by using \" a series of sensors and heating rings \" that will warm up your drink - or cool it down, if you'd prefer. To control the temperature, all you have to do is rotate the dial located on the bottom of the mug. You can also control how warm your coffee stays using the Ember app. Once connected to your smartphone or smartwatch device, you can change the temperature of the liquid inside of your Ember cup with just a tap on your screen.\nStarbucks \"ran the mugs through months of safety inspections\" before agreeing to allow the product to be sold in its stores, Inc. reported. The chain also reportedly tested the mug to make sure the heating process \"didn't change the flavor of its coffee.\" The Ember Mug is currently listed for $150 and is available for purchase in 100 Starbucks locations throughout the US. Get a closer look at the brand-new smart mug ahead. Would you invest in a cup that promises to keep your coffee warm all day long?\nRELATED: #TrumpCup campaign hits Starbucks, draws questions\nClick to expand Replay Video Homemade flying machines get wet in Hong Kong harbor Dozens of colorful and whimsical homemade flying objects take the plunge into Hong Kong's iconic Victoria Harbor during the third annual third Red Bull Flugtag event.

      "text": "0 2016Actors Gaten Matarazzo (L), Caleb McLaughlin and Millie Bobby Brown from the Netflix series \"Stranger Things\" arrive at the 68th Primetime Emmy Awards in Los Angeles, California U.S., September 18, 2016. Reuters/Lucy Nicholson \nMillie Bobby Brown sang out her order at Starbucks in Adele style in the video clip she posted on Twitter on Nov. 25. The \"Stranger Things\" star was sitting on the passenger seat when she leaned over to the side of the drive-thru attendant. She ordered a venti latte and a caramel frappuccino belting out to the tune of \"Hello.\" \n“Can I have a venti latte / And a caramel frappuccino? / Oh, please!”/\"Hello from the other side / I must have called a thousand times / To tell you...,\" Brown belted out the song. \n&mdash; Millie Bobby Brown (@milliebbrown) November 26, 2016 \nThe 12-year-old actress has also posted several videos of herself singing Beyoncé and Nicki Minaj's songs. Brown's videos showed that she has the talent in singing and completely different from the role she played in the American science fiction-horror web television series. She loves to sing Adele and Amy Winehouse's song but her favourite artist is Ed Sheeran. \nMillie Bobby Brown in \"Stranger Things\" \nBrown played small roles in \"Modern Family\" and \"Grey's Anatomy.\" However, the actress' family decided to move back to England to stay with her aunt. The roles she played wasn't enough to make her family stay in the US. Then she got an invitation to audition for the role of Eleven in the series. She auditioned using dummy slides using fake scenes to test the ability of an actor without giving away the plot of the story. She obviously got the role but she didn't know anything about her character. \nBrown's role as Eleven is dark, broody and hardly loquacious type. She mostly shows her emotions and speaks few words. . \n\"Stranger Things\" Season 2 News and Update \nIn the second installment of \"Stranger Things,\" Brown's character, Eleven, is coming back. There are new actors joining the next season, including Sadie Sink, Dacre Montgomery and Brett Gelman. Sink will play a tomboyish new girl in town named Max. Montgomery will play a friendly-with-ladies bad boy named Billy, playing Max's step brother. Gelman will play Murray Bauman, a former journalist passionate with conspiracy theories. The show is expected to air before July 2017.",

      "text": "13 Photos Apparently when Millie Bobby Brown isn’t playing Eleven on Netflix’s hit series ‘Stranger Things,’ she’s doing epic covers of amazing songs in Starbucks drive-thrus. Who knew? Check out the video of Millie belting out her coffee order set to Adele’s ‘Hello’ right here. \nStranger Things star Millie Bobby Brown said “Hi” from the Upside Down on a trip through a Starbucks drive-thru with her dad when she sang out her order in a parody of of Adele ’s “Hello.” In the clip she posted to Twitter on Nov. 25, Millie is seen leaning over from the passenger seat to serenade the drive-thru attendant with her order, “Can I have a venti latte / And a caramel frappuccino? / Oh please!” OMG Millie, how we love you. \nThe 12-year-old actress is best known for playing Eleven, a psychokinetic preteen on the hit Netflix series . But that doesn’t mean she doesn’t take every opportunity she gets to prove she’s got some musical chops too! In fact she’s posted several videos of herself performing hits by Adele and Beyoncé . She even epically rapped Nicki Minaj ‘s “Monster” verse on The Tonight Show. ‘Stranger Things’ Season 1 Pics \nAnd Millie isn’t the only Stranger Things kid who knows how to rock a rhyme. Gatten Matarazzo , 14, starred in a recent Old Navy video that was a parody of a Technotronic’s 1989 music video for “Pump Up The Jam.” In the retro-style video, Gaten was seen getting down to the song and rapping in front of an animated backdrop. It was seriously hilarious and we absolutely love that all of these kids know how to have fun and get down to the beat. Though, with the seriousness of the show, we doubt we’re gonna see them singing in the series any time soon. But you never know! \nHollywoodLifers , did you love Millie’s rendition of “Hello”? Are you a huge Millie fan? Let us know below! More 'Stranger Things' News:",

Doug Kass Nov28,20161:00AMEST \nDoug Kass shares his views every day on RealMoneyPro. Click here for a real-time look at his insights and musings. \nNot So Fast: The Path to Faster Growth Won't Be Easy \nOriginally published Nov. 21 at 7:40 a.m. EDT \" Dougie, there is many a slip 'twixt the cup and the lip.\" --Grandma Koufax \nA surprising amount of spontaneous optimism has spread over the markets following the Trump election victory. \nSpecifically, interest rates have climbed swiftly and economic and profit forecasts have been lifted based on the expectation of successful pro-growth policies to be implemented by the Trump administration. \nHowever, one of the most pressing headwinds as described in Friday's opening missive will be those higher interest rates. It is a headwind that will be compounded by the size of the federal government's debt, which will be close to $20 trillion in January 2017. And that does not include another $3.5 trillion of local and state debt. \nThe Debt and Deficits Are Now Out of Control \n\"Deficits don't matter.\" --Vice President Dick Cheney \nBack in the Reagan administration, tax cuts increased the deficit, but when combined with the Clinton/Gingrich budget controls, debt was falling and economic growth accelerated. Debt as a percentage of GDP fell. But the abandonment of budgetary controls (tax cuts rose at the same time spending programs grew) in the Bush administration put us back into deficits The Great Recession led to an explosion in the deficit, growing by nearly $10 trillion in eight years.

      "text": "\nTis the season for Starbucks red cups, Coca Cola polar bears, the majestic Clydesdales, and more. The holidays are a marketer’s dream come true . If you play your cards right , Q4 can be incredibly profitable for you and your business.\nHoliday Marketing Tips for Small Businesses 1. Don’t Make Assumptions Don’t just assume that your customers delight upon hearing Christmas greetings. Be sensitive to the beliefs of others. Don’t force your celebration down their throats. At the same time, know your demographic. For example, if you work for a Catholic based charity; religious connotations in your holiday marketing campaigns would be expected and acceptable. Understanding who you are, what you want to represent and the temperature of your audience will make sure your campaign resonates with customers.\n2. Go Where the People Are As with all marketing campaigns, make sure you’re using the right outlet for your message. For example, if you’re running a week long special, you can afford to send out an email promoting this deal. But, if it’s a three hour discount, send out a mass text campaign or post on social media. These two methods are instantaneous, and will encourage the most offer redemption. Know where your customers are “living,” in a digital sense, and make a home there.\n3. Respect Differences in Beliefs As I first stated, don’t assume that everyone celebrates the same way you do. On top of that, once differences do arise, show respect for the beliefs, traditions and customs of others. If your customer base is one huge melting pot, than choose to celebrate the majority holiday of you and your staff, while being aware of other preferences. When applicable, recognize these differences, in an effort to show you’re globally minded.\n4. Make the Most of Old Traditions Don’t be afraid to capitalize on current traditions. If it’s not broke, don’t fix it. One of the longest holiday traditions? The Christmas tree. Plan a marketing campaign around a custom that’s already stamped itself in the minds of consumers. People will recognize this symbol and immediately develop associations with your campaign.\n5. Start Your Own Traditions Make room for new traditions. With new traditions come the opportunity to solidify your brand in an evergreen way. For example, the Coca Cola polar bears have become an iconic symbol for this corporation; especially around the holidays. In fact, if you don’t see these symbols, it doesn’t even feel like that time of the year. One of the best examples of a new tradition that has swept the nation? Elf on the Shelf.\n6. Don’t Overspend — Word of Mouth Marketing Escalates Around the Holidays The holidays bring people together. When people are together, what do they do? Talk. They exchange first hand accounts about what products they’re using, where they’re going, who they’re following … the list goes on. Who wouldn’t want their product or service to be a part of those conversations? Take the main stage this holiday season by focusing on memorable campaigns.\nMemorable campaigns usually possess one or more of the following elements.\nThe “Me too!” factor (people relate your campaign to a past experience) A storyline that incites emotion or a reaction (nostalgia, laughter, etc.) A way to share their own stories or contribute to the campaign (share your favorite holiday recipes) 7. Note What Works and What Doesn’t Your holiday marketing campaigns won’t always resonate. Every year, try a new angle until something sticks. Once you find a campaign that takes off, follow this same direction every year. Maximize the storyline. Make your efforts cohesive and apparent.\nAbove all else, you must see the holidays as a time of opportunity . People expect to come face to face with marketing messages this time of year. This 60 to 90 day period is a perfect time to position your brand.\nRepublished by permission.

Fresh off killing Nikki Minaj’s “ Monster ” verse on The Tonight Show With Jimmy Fallon and Mark Ronson’s “ Uptown Funk ” at the Emmy awards, Millie Bobby Brown, aka Eleven, has now been filmed flexing her dulcet tones at a Starbucks drive-thru.\nRiding up front with her dad, Brown decided to mix up the order process by delivering her large latte and caramel frappuccino order to the melody of Adele’s hit track, “Hello.” “Hello, from the Upside Down,” Brown intones much to the chagrin of her server who, rather than seeing the funny side, is solely focused on getting the order right. “She nearly shut the window, that’s how much she hates ya,” warns Brown’s dad.\nAdventures at Starbucks with my daddy #hellofromtheupsidedown #keepcalmimparked #fatheranddaughterbanter @adele pic.twitter.com/OeImRpQ4fK \n— Millie Bobby Brown (@milliebbrown) November 26, 2016 \n\nWatch the clip above, and then check out Brown star in this music video by electronic DJ duo Sigma .\n",

      "text": "Employees at Starbucks in Hotel Locations should have Starbucks training   5:53 AM by barngal I frequent the Starbucks in the Marriott Copley Place in Boston quite often. There is a complete Starbuck's menu and most other Starbuck's products are sold, so maybe it's a true Starbucks location, however, the service is extremely slow and barristas stand around with blank stares while customers are piling up waiting for their drinks and food. Most often, it you order more than a cup of brewed coffee or a plain latte, they either make it all wrong, or they are missing ingredients. This morning I ordered a Chestnut Praline latte. They asked me if I wanted whipped cream when I placed my order and I said \"yes, everything !\" That's what makes the coffee special. When I got my coffee, which took about 15 minutes, there was no whipped cream and no topping. I asked the barrista and she put some whipped cream on top and said \"sorry, we are out of topping\" . Had I been told, I would have ordered something else...so can this be fixed ?? It is very frustrating .",

      "text": "Millie Bobby Brown Covers Adele in Starbucks Drive Thru Eleven meets 25 . Twitter Photo: Courtesy of Instagram/@MillieBobby_Brown \nWhen Millie Bobby Brown isn’t busy starring as our favorite Eggo-loving kid on Stranger Things , or having sleepovers with Maddie Ziegler, she spends her time serenading strangers. \nLike many of us, Millie stopped at Starbucks over the weekend, but she used the pit stop to unleash her inner Adele with a rendition of “Hello,” but like any true artist, she took some lyrical liberties. \n“Can I have a venti latte,” she sang into the drive-thru microphone. “And a caramel Frappuccino? Oh, please!” \nShe posted the video on Twitter hashtagged it #hellofromtheupsidedown, because of course she did. \nMillie has already shown that she has a talent for music, performing a song at the Emmys pre-show and rapping Nicki Minaj’s “Monster” verse for Jimmy Fallon . (If you haven't seen her cover songs on her YouTube channel , uh, you need to fix that now.) We wonder if there will be an album in the works someday for the young star. If so, sign us up. Loading",

While no exact premiere date was been released, season two will feature nine episodes and is reported to be set in autumn of 1984. — Millie Bobby Brown (@milliebbrown) November 26, 2016 \nPhoto: Getty Images",

(AP) — The Latest on fires and vandalism that authorities say damaged Starbucks coffee shops, an Old Navy store and other Albuquerque establishments (all times local):\n10:55 a.m.\nFederal authorities have charged a man with using an explosive device to damage an Old Navy store in Albuquerque, where a string of fires and vandalism over the holiday weekend damaged three Starbucks shops, a Barnes & Noble, and other establishments.\nA federal complaint states that police arrested David Hickman early Saturday morning after he pulled away from the shopping center where an Albuquerque police officer who was on patrol said he had heard \"small explosions.\"\nAuthorities did not link Hickman in court documents to other local fires under investigation.\nFederal agents say they discovered assault rifle, ammunition, and a box labeled \"Tannerite\" in his vehicle with jars containing a white substance. The complaint also says Hickman had a loaded handgun in a holster attached to his belt and emergency flare tucked into his waistband.\n___\n10:31 a.m.\nAn Albuquerque Barnes & Noble damaged by a suspicious fire over the weekend won't lay off employees while it cleans during the holiday season.\nBarnes & Noble spokeswoman Mary Ellen Keating told The Associated Press on Monday some booksellers are in the store helping with clean up while others are working shifts at another store in Albuquerque.\nShe said no one is losing pay.\nAuthorities say two suspicious fires damaged the Albuquerque Barnes & Noble and an Old Navy early Saturday morning. Officials say buildings suffered smoke and water damage.\nThe fires come after \"suspicious devices\" were left at three Albuquerque Starbucks coffee shops on Friday. A series of fires were lit at an anti-abortion ministry and a luxury condo complex was destroyed by a blaze last week.",

      "title": "Coffee Versus The Dollar",
      "text": "Global warming, Brazil, and Starbucks. \nRisky business: a look at the charts. Introduction In October, we presented a bullish outlook for 2017 coffee prices: The Future Of Coffee Prices . The article provided worldwide production, consumption, export and import forecasts as well as strategies for going long the soft commodity via the ETN: JO. Weather fluctuations and crop disease in Asia, Brazil, and Latin America produced lower yields creating reductions in inventory, and higher coffee prices in the short-term. However, risks to a bullish thesis exist, and the article mentioned currency fluctuations as something to watch for. \nGoing long (or short) coffee futures carry many inherent risks including currency fluctuations with the Brazilian Real and U.S. Dollar as analysts throw out numbers like 130 to 200-cents per pound in the short-term (2016/17). Current prices have already reached some price targets, and with soft commodities there is always a chance most of the supply side issues have been priced in. Production numbers can increase with ideal weather conditions, just as numbers have decreased the past four years with a variety of changing environmental conditions. Commodity futures trade with an air of speculation, and prices sometimes move with exuberance despite fundamentals.\" Coffee Currency Correlations Fast forward a month: Donald Trump's election victory created a violent re-pricing of equities (SPY, QQQ, DIA), and a rising U.S. Dollar (NYSEARCA: UUP ) sent a number of world currencies into a tailspin. The Mexican Peso ($MXN), for example, weakened dramatically and shows little sign of recovery without some clarity concerning American trade policy moving forward. Latin America produces a significant amount of the world's coffee, and a strong U.S. Dollar wreaks havoc on the region's currencies and exports. Mexico and Columbia ($COP), two of the bigger coffee exporters in world, saw their pesos weaken amid political change in the United States. Click to enlarge Brazil (NYSEARCA: EZM ) produces and exports, by far, the most coffee in the world. Donald Trump's strong dollar aside, the Brazilian Real continues weakening amid political turmoil and corruption . Despite a significant rise in 2016, coffee prices remain in a longer-term downtrend. A weak Brazilian economy coupled with a strong U.S. Dollar has played a significant role for prices the past five years. Click to enlarge Global Warming, Brazil, and Starbucks Brazil remains the most important player in the worldwide coffee trade, and the correlation between their currency and coffee prices (NYSEARCA: JO ) appears as a blatant catalyst for lower prices. Commodities generally fall with a rising dollar, but soft commodities like Sugar, Orange Juice, and Coffee also follow the Brazilian Real as the country exports a large number of agricultural goods and raw materials. The spike in coffee prices in 2014 can be attributed to many worldwide weather conditions including Southeast Asia, whose exports and consumption rates continue climbing. Coffee rust, a fungal disease that kills yields and requires the replanting of farms, plagued Central America while Columbia experienced lower yields due to heavy rains. The price hike was short-lived as prices dropped to new decade lows in 2015. Coffee prices appeared to have bottomed in summer of 2015 as prices shot up amid more weather-related production numbers for 2016-2017, which can be accessed from the previous article mentioned above. Global warming plays a significant role in worldwide coffee production for two main reasons. Most the world's coffee grows in higher elevations along the equator, and a couple degrees rise in temperature drastically reduces yields for the fickle coffee plant. Deforestation continues to alter the coffee growing landscape in Brazil, and reform looks unlikely at this juncture. To the dismay of many green activists, Donald Trump and the new U.S. Republican leadership may potentially roll back many environmental protections and treaties. Fellow SA contributor Phillip Davis highlights this dilemma , outlining an intriguing \"inflation and temperature hedge for a coffee achiever\" trade idea: long JO calls combined with selling puts in Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX ). With this move in coffee and currency, Starbucks, a stock suffering from coffee prices and politics for most of 2016, looks poised to break out to the upside as Wall Street positions into year-end. A long SBUX position may help hedge a long JO position, but the company also relies on a strong consumer. With the holiday shopping season in full swing, Starbucks needs a great quarter in the U.S. and China to keep the stock moving at current valuations. A stronger U.S. Dollar may dimmer, and perhaps cap the upside for coffee prices in the short-term, but the stock price for Starbucks provides little as far as inverse correlations go, and should be considered on its own fundamental merit. Risky Business Click to enlarge As illustrated in the chart, JO sits in the bottom range of the short-term uptrend. The stock sits below its 20- and 50-day moving averages, but JO remains above the 200-day by 7.65%. Currency issues dropped JO in November, and the trend looks in danger of breaking down. Technical analysis can prove risky business, so investors should gather all the information possible no matter their personal views with reading the charts. Dana Lyons, a Finance Contributor on Tumblr, suggests the buzz could wear off with coffee prices setting up for a downtrend. His thesis relies upon technical analysis, and he makes a compelling argument from the charts. But it's not just that. Another observation from Lyons includes net short positions. \nThis potential price resistance may be enough to halt the coffee rally temporarily, even if it does not derail it longer-term. However, there is another factor that may be a more substantial headwind should some selling commence. According to the CFTC, Commercial Hedgers in coffee futures are holding their largest net short position in the history of the contract. The concern is that these Hedgers most often represent the \"smart money\" once positioning gets to an extreme. Thus, this record net short position indicates a potential negative for coffee prices, should they begin to reverse lower. Whether you follow smart money or the U.S. Dollar, volatility remains a risk associated with trading commodities, long or short. Following the charts seem reasonable, and can reduce risk should an apparent trend-line break. Fundamentally, the weakening real in Brazil coupled with the strong dollar should signal trouble for coffee prices in the short-term, and in the past month these moves have proven dramatic. The future of Brazil's economy depends largely upon political change, the reduction of corruption, and a stronger currency for exports. The future of coffee prices depends upon many varying factors; crop yields, weather, consumption, currency, and politics all play important roles. Investors looking for a hedge with their long coffee position might consider a long position in the U.S. Dollar (NYSEARCA: USDU ) or a short position in Brazil.

      "title": "Why Starbucks cups always stir up controversy",
      "text": "Why Starbucks cups always stir up controversy By Maura Judkis, The Washington Post Published: November 28, 2016 1:45 PM CDT Updated: November 28, 2016 2:11 PM CDT 0 shares facebook twitter email comments × Pedestrians walk past a Starbucks coffee shop in New York; the coffee company is targeted every holiday season for its politics. MUST CREDIT: Bloomberg photo by Victor J. Blue \nThe culture wars come every December, fueled by peppermint mochas and venti soy lattes. The battleground is Starbucks. It's always Starbucks, isn't it? No one is complaining that the blue-and-brown holiday cups at Caribou Coffee take the \"Christ\" out of Christmas. No one is telling the Olive Garden hostess that their name is \"Trump\" so that she will have to call out \"Trump, party of three!\" \nReligion. Politics. The Bill of Rights. They all converge here, in front of a glass case full of cake pops. \nThe company's current foray into the headlines comes from several Trump-related incidents in stores over the past couple of weeks. On Nov. 16, a video of Miami real estate remodeler David Sanguesa berating a Starbucks employee whom he claimed refused to serve him because he was a Trump supporter went viral. (A witness said that Sanguesa got angry that his coffee order took too long.) \"We want nothing to do with you,\" he told the barista, who appears to be a person of color. \"You're trash.\" \nTwo days later, political consultant Tim Treadstone posted a video of Starbucks employees allegedly calling the police on a man who insisted that baristas write \"Trump\" on his cup. \"Operation #TrumpCup\" was born: Treadstone encouraged Trump supporters to go to Starbucks, give their name as Trump, and take video if the barista refused to use the name. \n\"We have a culture war to win. I'm a Trump supporter. I thought when Trump won, I might just wake up and America would be great again. Guess what, it wasn't,\" Treadstone told The Washington Post. \"Obviously, a lot of people aren't happy with us, and we need to stand up for our freedom and our First Amendment.\" \nThe First Amendment protects your right to speech and expression without government interference. But it does not protect against interference by private businesses, such as Starbucks. Besides, taking customers' names is not even official company policy. It's \"a fun ritual in our stores,\" said spokesman Reggie Borges, who said that Starbucks does not require employees to call out names. \nThe movement is an \"attempt to troll [Starbucks's] famously liberal baristas into being hypocritical in some fashion: to refuse to serve a customer in the same way that some opponents of same-sex marriage want to refuse service to gay couples,\" said Erik Owens, interim director of the Boisi Center for Religion and American Public Life at Boston College. \n#TrumpCup is a spinoff of a movement called #MerryChristmasStarbucks, which Joshua Feuerstein, an evangelical social media personality, started in 2015 when Starbucks released a minimalist red cup that people criticized for being too plain - a design that Starbucks intended as a blank-slate holiday celebration for all faiths. \n\"I felt as though a point needed to be made that we as Americans are tired of political correctness and the cultural cleansing of anything related to Jesus (i.e. Christmas),\" Feuerstein wrote in an email. \nIn a video, he encouraged his followers to go to Starbucks and give their names as Merry Christmas, so that baristas would write it on the cup. Feuerstein's video alleged that Starbucks employees are instructed not to say \"Merry Christmas.\" Borges denied that: \"Our baristas are not provided a script or a policy around greeting customers,\" he said. \nThe movement caught on, and even President-elect Donald Trump, then one of 14 candidates in the Republican primary field, jumped into the fray. \n\"That's the end of that lease,\" he said at a rally, referring to the Starbucks in Trump Tower. \"If I become president, we're all going to be saying 'Merry Christmas' again, that I can tell you.\" \nIronically, instead of boycotting the business, many of the Starbucks-related social media movements involve mobilizing people to actually spend money at a company whose views they presumably disagree with. Feuerstein said that his followers \"flooded Starbucks to participate\" in #MerryChristmasStarbucks. (He did not answer a question asking whether his message outweighed the company's potential financial gain.) Treadstone was fine with spending money there: \"This was never meant to be a boycott,\" he told The Post of his call to arms. \"I love Starbucks.\" \nAs many have pointed out on social media, the people who are offended by Starbucks cups are often the same people who accuse their political rivals of being too sensitive about things like the Confederate flag. \n\"It's a transparent attempt to stir up false conflict in order to rally a certain subset of Christians against so-called liberal culture,\" Owens said. \nStarbucks's holiday cups have often featured nondenominational holiday symbols, such as snowmen and stars. Those images have been politicized, too: In 2011, the company was accused of featuring a nutcracker that looked like the Guy Fawkes mask, then a symbol of Occupy Wall Street. Starbucks said it was a coincidence. \nAnd it is not the only company to stick to bland seasonal greetings. Last year's McDonald's cup was purple (!) with an image of a wreath and the phrase \"Welcome home.\" This year's design features a Christmas tree, as does the Dunkin' Donuts cup. \nThe Starbucks design is a lot spiffier this year, too. Inspired by customers who drew on last year's plain red cups, the company has released a series of elaborate but secular designs - birch trees, snowflakes, strings of holiday lights and Santa with his sleigh. \n\"It would have been difficult for us to ignore the feedback from last year, and we take it in stride, both positive and negative,\" Borges said. \nMaybe that is why a promotional video features a cup with a drawing of Jesus in the manger - a design that does not appear on any cups in stores. Still, Feuerstein and others seem pleased with the change. \n\"Looks like the American people have been heard,\" Feuerstein said. \"And we not only saved Christmas, we elected Donald Trump as our next president and saved the country!\" \nThe idea that something as simple as a Starbucks cup could either save or ruin Christmas would have seemed absurd for much of the company's history. In the early days, Starbucks was almost snooty, serving espresso to people who were too good for regular drip coffee. It was distinctly Left Coast. Not to mention, it required Americans to learn Italian: The country struggled with words like doppio, venti and macchiato. \nToday, Starbucks has more than 12,000 shops in the United States, and 80 percent of the country lives less than 20 miles from a grande eggnog latte. \n\"Starbucks has a broader target, based on the ubiquity of the brand,\" said Derek Rucker, a marketing professor at Northwestern University. \"With that broader target, you're more likely to get difference of opinion.\" \nPart of the reason Starbucks is a frequent target is because its chief executive, Howard Schultz, is outspoken about his politics. In 2013, he requested that customers not bring guns to his stores, even in states where open carry is permitted. He launched \"Race Together,\" a widely mocked attempt to start a conversation about race in stores. He endorsed Hillary Clinton for president. And just before the election, Starbucks released a green cup with an illustration of more than 100 people drawn with one continuous line - \"a symbol of unity as a reminder of our shared values, and the need to be good to each other,\" Schultz said in a news release. People thought it was the holiday cup, and a mass freakout ensued. Schultz, by the way, was raised Jewish. \nBut other companies headed by Democrat-endorsing chief executives have not found themselves in the crosshairs nearly as much. Calls for Republicans to boycott Netflix and Costco did not take off the way that Starbucks protests have. This may be because Starbucks' history of these types of protests builds upon itself, making the brand a symbolic target for right-wing demonstrators. \n\"The stage has almost been set for not only consumers but also media to be sensitive to what Starbucks has done, perhaps more than other brands,\" Rucker said. \nIt may also have something to do with consumers' relationship with the brand. \n\"Many of us go to the same coffee shop every day, so when there's a violation, it's not so easily overlooked,\" Rucker said. Potentially, customers are \"more vested in their experience there.\" \nCoffee is a ritual, and when it gets political, it is personal. After all, your name is on the cup - except when it's Trump's name instead. \n(c) 2016, The Washington Post Subscribe to NewsOK's Daily News Headlines Stay informed with a wide selection of the top news, sports, entertainment and lifestyle headlines.
