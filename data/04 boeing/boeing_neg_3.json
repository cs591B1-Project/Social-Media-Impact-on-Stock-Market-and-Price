It is Huntsville’s talent that will help Boeing meet the needs of the warfighter and, in turn, help secure our nation and that of our allies,\" Mayor Tommy Battle \nThese 400 jobs will take Boeing’s footprint to just over 3100 jobs in Alabama. This only furthers their commitment to our region and once again shows that Madison County is perfectly positioned in every aspect related to missile defense, space and National security,\" Madison County Commission Chairman, Dale W. Strong said in a statement. \nThe announcement impacts more than 2,500 positions across the United States. \n“In order to push ourselves farther and win more business, we need to make the most of our resources and talent,” said Leanne Caret, president and CEO, Defense, Space & Security. “These steps will help us be a stronger partner for our customers worldwide.” \nPositions at the current Kent, Washington Boeing facility will move to another Washington state location. Boeing leaders will also close its El Paso, Texas and Newington, Virginia sites. \n1,600 positions will go to Los Angeles County in California, 500 jobs head to the company's St. Louis operations, along with the 400 already announced jobs coming to Huntsville. \nCopyright 2016 WAFF .

      "text": "ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Boeing Co. plans to move about 2,500 positions to other sites, cut 500 jobs, and close two facilities by the end of 2020 as part of an effort to operate its Defense, Space & Security business more efficiently, the company said Tuesday.\nAbout 1,600 positions currently in Huntington Beach, California, will move to plants in three other Southern California locations -- El Segundo, Long Beach and Seal Beach. About 500 positions will move to St. Louis County in Missouri, and 400 will shift to Huntsville, Alabama.\nChicago-based Boeing will close a plant that employs 290 people in in El Paso, Texas, and another that employs 70 people in Newington, Virginia. The company said the moves will reduce facility space by about 4.5 million square feet.\nThe Huntington Beach plant will remain open. Boeing spokesman Ken Smith declined to say how many workers will remain there.\nThe company will move an unspecified number of jobs from Kent, Washington, to Tukwila, Washington. The two towns are just 16 miles apart.\n\"In order to push ourselves farther and win more business, we need to make the most of our resources and talent,\" Leanne Caret, president and CEO of Boeing Defense, Space & Security, said in a statement. \"These steps will help us be a stronger partner for our customers worldwide.\"\nThe company said it also will align Boeing Defence Australia, Boeing Defense Saudi Arabia, and Boeing Defence United Kingdom into a new global operations group, led by David Pitchforth, managing director of Boeing Defence U.K.\n ",

Strong said in a statement. \nThe announcement impacts more than 2,500 positions across the United States. \n“In order to push ourselves farther and win more business, we need to make the most of our resources and talent,” said Leanne Caret, president and CEO, Defense, Space & Security. “These steps will help us be a stronger partner for our customers worldwide.” \nPositions at the current Kent, Washington Boeing facility will move to another Washington state location.

      "text": "November 15, 2016 8:11 PM Boeing consolidating defense, space operations \nBy Jerry Siebenmark   \nBoeing will consolidate its Defense, Space and Security business, reducing facility space and closing sites in two states. \nLeanne Caret, a Derby native and Defense, Space and Security chief executive, said in a Boeing news release Tuesday the consolidation is driven by a need to win more business and make the most of its operations and employees. \nThe consolidation includes reducing facilities space by 4.5 million square feet, moving employees from one site to another – Los Angeles County gains 1,600 positions while St. Louis and Huntsville, Ala., will add 500 and 400 positions, respectively – and closing operations in El Paso, Texas, and Newington, Va. \n“Making better use of our facilities will enhance efficiency and promote greater collaboration,” Caret said.",

United will take delivery of the other four 737s as planned, but convert them to the 737-800 model. \nThe fleet changes are part of $4.8 billion in initiatives intended to improve the airline’s profitability through 2020. Chief Executive Officer Oscar Munoz is looking for ways to elevate profit margins and match Delta, which has led the industry in recent years. United’s operating profit amounted to 13.6 percent of sales last year, trailing Delta’s 19 percent margin and American’s 15.1 percent. \nUnited stock climbed 5 percent to $66.10 at 9:45 a.m. in New York, a day after Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway said it had invested in the airline and three major rivals. Berkshire is an “anchor tenant” investor, Munoz said in a meeting with analysts. United’s gain was the biggest on the Bloomberg U.S. Airlines Index, which climbed 1.6 percent.",

      "text": " Safran Nacelles\nLE HAVRE , France , November 15, 2016 /PRNewswire/ --\nThe initial jet engine exhaust system component for Boeing's new 777X airplane has been delivered by Safran Nacelles, achieving another on-time milestone in this Safran group company's first major role as a supplier to the U.S. aircraft manufacturer.\nProvided to Boeing was the exhaust system's center body - a complex-shaped unit that contributes to the proper aerodynamic flow of exhaust from the 777X's General Electric GE9X turbofan engines.\n\"On-time deliveries and meeting Boeing's high expectations are Safran Nacelles' priorities for this program, and we are fully committed to meeting our commitments on the 777X exhaust system,\" said Jean-Paul Alary, the President of Safran Nacelles. \"We're building a strong and valued relationship with Boeing based on our experience in nacelle integration, and we look forward to additional opportunities to grow our association in the future.\"\nThe two-piece exhaust system center body was delivered from Safran Nacelles' Le Havre , France , production facility. It is composed primarily of titanium and incorporates an acoustically treated area for reduced engine noise levels.\nA second development unit is in production at Safran Nacelles for delivery to Boeing before year-end, involving the center body, the nozzle and the center vent tube - representing a complete exhaust system.\nThe 777X's exhaust systems are among the largest of their type ever manufactured for civil aircraft, and fully benefit from titanium's lower mass and increased resistance to heat in jet engine applications.\nSafran i s a leading international high-technology group with three core businesses: Aerospace (propulsion and equipment), Defence and Security. Operating worldwide, the Group has 70,000 employees and generated sales of 17.4 billion euros in 2015. Safran is listed on Euronext Paris and is part of the CAC40 index, as well as the Euro Stoxx 50 European index.\nSafran Nacelles is the world's second leading supplier of aircraft engine nacelles, with more than 17,000 in service, logging over 100,000 flight-hours per day. It supplies nacelles and components for all segments of the aviation market, from business and regional jets to mainline commercial jets.\nFor more information : http://www.safran-group.com and http://www.safran-nacelles.com / Follow @Safran and @SafranNacelles on Twitter\n ",

      "text": "By Doug Cameron\nBoeing Co. said Tuesday it would cut another 500 jobs over the next four years from its defense and space business by shrinking work at its Huntington Beach facility in California and closing two smaller plants in Texas and Virginia.\nThe aerospace company plans to transfer work on a range of military, space and commercial aircraft programs to existing facilities, cutting the amount of manufacturing and office space at its domestic plants by 4.5 million square feet from an existing total of around 80 million square feet, a trim of almost 6%.\nThe Pentagon has said the U.S. military has 20% more facility space than it needs, though Congress has opposed more base closures. Defense companies such as Lockheed Martin Corp. and Raytheon Co. have been cutting their own real estate holdings by around 10% in recent years.\nBoeing's defense arm has cut thousands of jobs over the past five years, a faster pace than reductions at a commercial airplane arm that have climbed in recent months as it faced tougher competition from Airbus Group SE.\nThe U.S. company said it would offer some staff affected by the latest changes alternative opportunities at other sites in southern California as well as Missouri and Alabama that would result in 2,500 job additions at those facilities. Huntington Beach employs around 5,000 staff, a number that will also drop through natural attrition. Boeing also is closing sites in El Paso, Texas, and Newington, Va.\nBoeing has cut almost 7,000 staff this year -- around 4% of its total workforce -- mainly through a mix of voluntary layoffs, attrition and some compulsory cuts at its commercial aircraft arm. The group's workforce fell 2.5% in 2015.\nWrite to Doug Cameron at doug.cameron@wsj.com\n 20:03 ET (01:03 ",

He said the first aircraft will be delivered by July 2020, the remaining three will be delivered by the end of 2021. India, already operates eight of the long range sea patrol aircraft. In July, the navy placed an order for an additional four planes and also shared an undisclosed list of upgrades and new features that it requires, a senior Boeing executive said. While the Boeing official did not share details of the upgrades being discussed, the Indian Navy is also likely to go in for a simultaneous upgrade of its existing fleet of eight planes to the latest standard. The boost to the Indian fleet will come at a time when the Chinese Peoples Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) is seen increasing its footprints in the Indian Ocean. Boeing officials said the P-8I planes are likely to be certified for aerial refuelling by 2017, a move that will enhance its range for maritime missions. India has been using its P-8I fleet extensively for missions ranging from patrolling and spotting passing submarines and ships to search missions in the Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea. It was also used for search missions of the missing An 32 transporter off the Chennai coast. India is also looking to placing some aircraft at the strategic Andaman islands to give them more reach to patrol regions of interest.

      "title": "Safran Delivers the First Jet Engine Exhaust System Component for Boeing's 777X Airplane",
      "text": " Safran Nacelles\nLE HAVRE , France , November 15, 2016 /PRNewswire/ --\nThe initial jet engine exhaust system component for Boeing's new 777X airplane has been delivered by Safran Nacelles, achieving another on-time milestone in this Safran group company's first major role as a supplier to the U.S. aircraft manufacturer.\nProvided to Boeing was the exhaust system's center body - a complex-shaped unit that contributes to the proper aerodynamic flow of exhaust from the 777X's General Electric GE9X turbofan engines.\n\"On-time deliveries and meeting Boeing's high expectations are Safran Nacelles' priorities for this program, and we are fully committed to meeting our commitments on the 777X exhaust system,\" said Jean-Paul Alary, the President of Safran Nacelles. \"We're building a strong and valued relationship with Boeing based on our experience in nacelle integration, and we look forward to additional opportunities to grow our association in the future.\"\nThe two-piece exhaust system center body was delivered from Safran Nacelles' Le Havre , France , production facility. It is composed primarily of titanium and incorporates an acoustically treated area for reduced engine noise levels.\nA second development unit is in production at Safran Nacelles for delivery to Boeing before year-end, involving the center body, the nozzle and the center vent tube - representing a complete exhaust system.\nThe 777X's exhaust systems are among the largest of their type ever manufactured for civil aircraft, and fully benefit from titanium's lower mass and increased resistance to heat in jet engine applications.\nSafran i s a leading international high-technology group with three core businesses: Aerospace (propulsion and equipment), Defence and Security. Operating worldwide, the Group has 70,000 employees and generated sales of 17.4 billion euros in 2015. Safran is listed on Euronext Paris and is part of the CAC40 index, as well as the Euro Stoxx 50 European index.\nSafran Nacelles is the world's second leading supplier of aircraft engine nacelles, with more than 17,000 in service, logging over 100,000 flight-hours per day. It supplies nacelles and components for all segments of the aviation market, from business and regional jets to mainline commercial jets.\nFor more information : http://www.safran-group.com and http://www.safran-nacelles.com / Follow @Safran and @SafranNacelles on Twitter\n ",

      "title": "Australia Takes Delivery of First P-8A Anti-Submarine Jet",
      "text": "Email Australia's prime minister on Wednesday took delivery of the air force's first Boeing P-8A surveillance and anti-submarine aircraft which will take a front-line role in preventing asylum seekers from reaching the Australian coast by boat. The Royal Australian Air Force will receive 12 of the modified Boeing 737 jets by March 2020 for 5 billion Australian dollars ($3.8 billion). The plane will take over the coastal surveillance role that the Lockheed P-3 Orion has carried out since 1968. \"These aircraft will be absolutely critical elements in the work of Australia's border protection forces ... ensuring that we can continue to say that it is only the Australian government that determines who comes to Australia ,\" Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull told reporters at the Canberra air force base. Australia expects a new wave of asylum seekers to come from Indonesia by boat after a weekend announcement that the United States had agreed to resettle up to 1,600 refugees who have languished at Australia's expense for up to three years in Pacific island camps. Australia refuses to resettle any refugee who has arrived by boat since the date the tough policy was announced on July 19, 2013. Australia pays Nauru and Papua New Guinea to house boat arrivals from Africa, Middle East and Asia. No people smuggling operation has successfully delivered asylum seekers to Australia by boat since July 2014, but the navy has turned back 29 boats to Indonesia. Australia has increased air and sea surveillance between Australia and Indonesia to ensure that any new smuggling attempt was intercepted. 0 Shares",

      "text": "By Doug Cameron\nBoeing Co. said Tuesday it would cut another 500 jobs over the next four years from its defense and space business by shrinking work at its Huntington Beach facility in California and closing two smaller plants in Texas and Virginia.\nThe aerospace company plans to transfer work on a range of military, space and commercial aircraft programs to existing facilities, cutting the amount of manufacturing and office space at its domestic plants by 4.5 million square feet from an existing total of around 80 million square feet, a trim of almost 6%.\nThe Pentagon has said the U.S. military has 20% more facility space than it needs, though Congress has opposed more base closures. Defense companies such as Lockheed Martin Corp. and Raytheon Co. have been cutting their own real estate holdings by around 10% in recent years.\nBoeing's defense arm has cut thousands of jobs over the past five years, a faster pace than reductions at a commercial airplane arm that have climbed in recent months as it faced tougher competition from Airbus Group SE.\nThe U.S. company said it would offer some staff affected by the latest changes alternative opportunities at other sites in southern California as well as Missouri and Alabama that would result in 2,500 job additions at those facilities. Huntington Beach employs around 5,000 staff, a number that will also drop through natural attrition. Boeing also is closing sites in El Paso, Texas, and Newington, Va.\nBoeing has cut almost 7,000 staff this year -- around 4% of its total workforce -- mainly through a mix of voluntary layoffs, attrition and some compulsory cuts at its commercial aircraft arm. The group's workforce fell 2.5% in 2015.\nWrite to Doug Cameron at doug.cameron@wsj.com\n 15, 2016 20:03 ET (01:03 ",

      "text": "United Continental Holdings Inc. said Tuesday that it would postpone receiving dozens of new Boeing Co. jets to trim spending.\nThe third-largest U.S. airline will defer 61 planes from a 65-jet order for 737-700s and convert them into the new Max model with yet-to-be-determined arrival dates. Boeing will switch the remaining four to the larger 737-800 model for delivery next year.\nThe airline, among four U.S. carriers that have recently attracted investment from Berkshire Hathaway Inc., also announced a push to boost its share of budget-conscious travelers with a new no-frills fare class. The basic economy class entitles fliers only to an under-seat bag and is also intended to avoid the delays caused by passengers stowing overhead baggage.\nThe move are among a parade of planned changes unveiled by United Chief Executive Oscar Munoz and his new management team that include cost cuts and revenue-boosting initiatives designed to increase profits by $4.8 billion by 2020.\nThe fleet changes are among the industry's largest since Southwest Airlines Co. in June reached a deal with Boeing to defer 67 of its 737 Max deliveries scheduled for the 2019-2022 period until 2023 and beyond.\nBoeing and Airbus Group SE have order books for their best-selling jets stretching out for several years of production, and typically overbook knowing that some planes will be canceled or deferred.\nBoth jet makers have said that cancellations and requests to push back deliveries remain below their historical average. Boeing had no immediate comment on United's move.\nChicago-based United is also buying 24 175 Embraer jets from the Brazilian manufacturer rather than leasing them from an unidentified regional airline, with the Boeing fleet changes expected to cut capital spending over the next two years by $1.6 billion.\nUnited also plans changes to flights at its three big hubs in Chicago, Newark and Houston that it hopes will add $900 million in incremental revenue by 2019.\nWrite to Doug Cameron at doug.cameron@wsj.com\nNovember 15, 2016 08:05 ET (13:05 ",

      "text": "ST. LOUIS (AP) — Boeing Co. plans to move about 2,500 positions to other sites, cut 500 jobs, and close two facilities by the end of 2020 as part of an effort to operate its Defense, Space & Security business more efficiently, the company said Tuesday.\nAbout 1,600 positions currently in Huntington Beach, California, will move to plants in three other Southern California locations -- El Segundo, Long Beach and Seal Beach. About 500 positions will move to St. Louis County in Missouri, and 400 will shift to Huntsville, Alabama.\nChicago-based Boeing will close a plant that employs 290 people in in El Paso, Texas, and another that employs 70 people in Newington, Virginia. The company said the moves will reduce facility space by about 4.5 million square feet.\nThe Huntington Beach plant will remain open. Boeing spokesman Ken Smith declined to say how many workers will remain there.\nThe company will move an unspecified number of jobs from Kent, Washington, to Tukwila, Washington. The two towns are just 16 miles apart.\n\"In order to push ourselves farther and win more business, we need to make the most of our resources and talent,\" Leanne Caret, president and CEO of Boeing Defense, Space & Security, said in a statement. \"These steps will help us be a stronger partner for our customers worldwide.\"\nThe company said it also will align Boeing Defence Australia, Boeing Defense Saudi Arabia, and Boeing Defence United Kingdom into a new global operations group, led by David Pitchforth, managing director of Boeing Defence U.K.",

      "text": "By JIM SALTER - 11/16/16 2:43 AM \nST. LOUIS — Boeing Co. plans to move about 2,500 positions to other sites, cut 500 jobs, and close two facilities by the end of 2020 as part of an effort to operate its Defense, Space & Security business more efficiently, the company said Tuesday. \nAbout 1,600 positions currently in Huntington Beach, California, will move to plants in three other Southern California locations — El Segundo, Long Beach and Seal Beach. About 500 positions will move to St. Louis County in Missouri, and 400 will shift to Huntsville, Alabama. \nChicago-based Boeing will close a plant that employs 290 people in in El Paso, Texas, and another that employs 70 people in Newington, Virginia. The company said the moves will reduce facility space by about 4.5 million square feet. \nThe Huntington Beach plant will remain open. Boeing spokesman Ken Smith declined to say how many workers will remain there. \nThe company will move an unspecified number of jobs from Kent, Washington, to Tukwila, Washington. The two towns are just 16 miles apart. \n“In order to push ourselves farther and win more business, we need to make the most of our resources and talent,” Leanne Caret, president and CEO of Boeing Defense, Space & Security, said in a statement. “These steps will help us be a stronger partner for our customers worldwide.” \nThe company said it also will align Boeing Defence Australia, Boeing Defense Saudi Arabia, and Boeing Defence United Kingdom into a new global operations group, led by David Pitchforth, managing director of Boeing Defence U.K.",

      "text": "November 15, 2016 3:44 PM Boeing to cut some jobs, move others, in efficiency effort By JIM SALTER Associated Press Order Reprint of this Story ST. LOUIS \nBoeing Co. plans to move about 2,500 positions to other sites, cut 500 jobs, and close two facilities by the end of 2020 as part of an effort to operate its Defense, Space & Security business more efficiently, the company said Tuesday. \nAbout 1,600 positions currently in Huntington Beach, California, will move to plants in three other Southern California locations - El Segundo, Long Beach and Seal Beach. About 500 positions will move to St. Louis County in Missouri, and 400 will shift to Huntsville, Alabama. \nChicago-based Boeing will close a plant that employs 290 people in in El Paso, Texas, and another that employs 70 people in Newington, Virginia. The company said the moves will reduce facility space by about 4.5 million square feet. \nThe Huntington Beach plant will remain open. Boeing spokesman Ken Smith declined to say how many workers will remain there. \nThe company will move an unspecified number of jobs from Kent, Washington, to Tukwila, Washington. The two towns are just 16 miles apart. \n\"In order to push ourselves farther and win more business, we need to make the most of our resources and talent,\" Leanne Caret, president and CEO of Boeing Defense, Space & Security, said in a statement. \"These steps will help us be a stronger partner for our customers worldwide.\" \nThe company said it also will align Boeing Defence Australia, Boeing Defense Saudi Arabia, and Boeing Defence United Kingdom into a new global operations group, led by David Pitchforth, managing director of Boeing Defence U.K. Related content",

LOUIS (AP) — Boeing Co. plans to move about 2,500 positions to other sites, cut 500 jobs, and close two facilities by the end of 2020 as part of an effort to operate its Defense, Space & Security business more efficiently, the company said Tuesday. About 1,600 positions currently in Huntington Beach, California, will move to plants in three other Southern California locations -- El Segundo, Long Beach and Seal Beach. About 500 positions will move to St. Louis County in Missouri, and 400 will shift to Huntsville, Alabama. Chicago-based Boeing will close a plant that employs 290 people in in El Paso, Texas, and another that employs 70 people in Newington, Virginia. The company said the moves will reduce facility space by about 4.5 million square feet. The Huntington Beach plant will remain open. Boeing spokesman Ken Smith declined to say how many workers will remain there. The company will move an unspecified number of jobs from Kent, Washington, to Tukwila, Washington. The two towns are just 16 miles apart. \"In order to push ourselves farther and win more business, we need to make the most of our resources and talent,\" Leanne Caret , president and CEO of Boeing Defense, Space & Security, said in a statement. \"These steps will help us be a stronger partner for our customers worldwide.\" The company said it also will align Boeing Defence Australia, Boeing Defense Saudi Arabia, and Boeing Defence United Kingdom into a new global operations group, led by David Pitchforth , managing director of Boeing Defence U.K. Today's Deals",

(Jeff Gritchen/The Orange County Register/SCNG via AP) \nST. LOUIS (AP) — Boeing Co. plans to move about 2,500 positions to other sites, cut 500 jobs, and close two facilities by the end of 2020 as part of an effort to operate its Defense, Space & Security business more efficiently, the company said Tuesday. \nAbout 1,600 positions currently in Huntington Beach, California, will move to plants in three other Southern California locations -- El Segundo, Long Beach and Seal Beach. About 500 positions will move to St. Louis County in Missouri, and 400 will shift to Huntsville, Alabama. \nChicago-based Boeing will close a plant that employs 290 people in in El Paso, Texas, and another that employs 70 people in Newington, Virginia. The company said the moves will reduce facility space by about 4.5 million square feet. \nThe Huntington Beach plant will remain open. Boeing spokesman Ken Smith declined to say how many workers will remain there. \nThe company will move an unspecified number of jobs from Kent, Washington, to Tukwila, Washington. The two towns are just 16 miles apart. \n\"In order to push ourselves farther and win more business, we need to make the most of our resources and talent,\" Leanne Caret, president and CEO of Boeing Defense, Space & Security, said in a statement. \"These steps will help us be a stronger partner for our customers worldwide.\" \nThe company said it also will align Boeing Defence Australia, Boeing Defense Saudi Arabia, and Boeing Defence United Kingdom into a new global operations group, led by David Pitchforth, managing director of Boeing Defence U.K. Tags",

      "text": "Jason Redmond | Reuters Boeing aircraft at Boeing Field in Seattle Boeing Co. plans to move about 2,500 positions to other sites, cut 500 jobs, and close two facilities by the end of 2020 as part of an effort to operate its Defense, Space & Security business more efficiently, the company said Tuesday.\nAbout 1,600 positions currently in Huntington Beach, California, will move to plants in three other Southern California locations -- El Segundo, Long Beach and Seal Beach. About 500 positions will move to St. Louis County in Missouri, and 400 will shift to Huntsville, Alabama.\nChicago-based Boeing will close a plant that employs 290 people in in El Paso, Texas, and another that employs 70 people in Newington, Virginia. The company said the moves will reduce facility space by about 4.5 million square feet.\nThe Huntington Beach plant will remain open. Boeing spokesman Ken Smith declined to say how many workers will remain there. \nThe company will move an unspecified number of jobs from Kent, Washington, to Tukwila, Washington. The two towns are just 16 miles apart. \n\"In order to push ourselves farther and win more business, we need to make the most of our resources and talent,\" Leanne Caret, president and CEO of Boeing Defense, Space & Security, said in a statement. \"These steps will help us be a stronger partner for our customers worldwide.\" \nThe company said it also will align Boeing Defence Australia, Boeing Defense Saudi Arabia, and Boeing Defence United Kingdom into a new global operations group, led by David Pitchforth, managing director of Boeing Defence U.K.",

      "text": "ST. LOUIS -- Boeing Co. plans to move about 2,500 positions to other sites, cut 500 jobs, and close two facilities by the end of 2020 as part of an effort to operate its Defense, Space & Security business more efficiently, the company said Tuesday.\nAbout 1,600 positions currently in Huntington Beach, California, will move to plants in three other Southern California locations -- El Segundo, Long Beach and Seal Beach. About 500 positions will move to St. Louis County in Missouri, and 400 will shift to Huntsville, Alabama.\nChicago-based Boeing will close a plant that employs 290 people in in El Paso, Texas, and another that employs 70 people in Newington, Virginia. The company said the moves will reduce facility space by about 4.5 million square feet.\nThe Huntington Beach plant will remain open. Boeing spokesman Ken Smith declined to say how many workers will remain there.\nThe company will move an unspecified number of jobs from Kent, Washington, to Tukwila, Washington. The two towns are just 16 miles apart.\n\"In order to push ourselves farther and win more business, we need to make the most of our resources and talent,\" Leanne Caret, president and CEO of Boeing Defense, Space & Security, said in a statement. \"These steps will help us be a stronger partner for our customers worldwide.\"\nThe company said it also will align Boeing Defence Australia, Boeing Defense Saudi Arabia, and Boeing Defence United Kingdom into a new global operations group, led by David Pitchforth, managing director of Boeing Defence U.K.\nArticle Comments ( 0 ) Tweet This article filed under: Business Nation/World Associated Press",

(Jeff Gritchen/The Orange County Register/SCNG via AP) \nST. LOUIS (AP) — Boeing Co. plans to move about 2,500 positions to other sites, cut 500 jobs, and close two facilities by the end of 2020 as part of an effort to operate its Defense, Space & Security business more efficiently, the company said Tuesday. \nAbout 1,600 positions currently in Huntington Beach, California, will move to plants in three other Southern California locations -- El Segundo, Long Beach and Seal Beach. About 500 positions will move to St. Louis County in Missouri, and 400 will shift to Huntsville, Alabama. \nChicago-based Boeing will close a plant that employs 290 people in in El Paso, Texas, and another that employs 70 people in Newington, Virginia. The company said the moves will reduce facility space by about 4.5 million square feet. \nThe Huntington Beach plant will remain open. Boeing spokesman Ken Smith declined to say how many workers will remain there. \nThe company will move an unspecified number of jobs from Kent, Washington, to Tukwila, Washington. The two towns are just 16 miles apart. \n\"In order to push ourselves farther and win more business, we need to make the most of our resources and talent,\" Leanne Caret, president and CEO of Boeing Defense, Space & Security, said in a statement. \"These steps will help us be a stronger partner for our customers worldwide.\" \nThe company said it also will align Boeing Defence Australia, Boeing Defense Saudi Arabia, and Boeing Defence United Kingdom into a new global operations group, led by David Pitchforth, managing director of Boeing Defence U.K. Tags",

      "text": "CTT Systems Announces Zonal Drying™ Order for 5 Boeing 757-200s and 3 767-300s  10 CET \nCTT Systems AB (“CTT”), the market leader in aircraft humidity control systems, announces a Zonal Drying™ order for 5 Boeing 757-200s and 3 767-300s to be retrofit installed by AZUR Aviation, with deliveries between December 2016 and August 2017. \nPeter Landquist, VP Sales & Marketing, CTT Systems AB, comments: ‘We are privileged to receive an order from AZUR Aviation, a new customer valuing the benefits of mastering the root-cause of fuselage condensation from the very first operation. Hereby, the new aircraft will not gain weight from accumulated water/ice accretion (which increasing fuel and CO2 burn) and it will not experience moisture problems, such as electrical failures, which increase cost.’ \nThe Zonal Drying™ Anti-Condensation System generates the following advantages: Lower fuel burn and CO2/NOX emissions from excess weight reduction of 200-300kg of accumulated water in B737/A320 aircraft; Higher operational reliability from significantly lower moisture related faults in electrical equipment (reduced Out-Of-Service time).

      "text": "ST. LOUIS — Boeing Co. plans to move about 2,500 positions to other sites, cut 500 jobs, and close two facilities by the end of 2020 as part of an effort to operate its Defense, Space & Security business more efficiently, the company said Tuesday.\nAbout 1,600 positions currently in Huntington Beach, California, will move to plants in three other Southern California locations — El Segundo, Long Beach and Seal Beach. About 500 positions will move to St. Louis County in Missouri, and 400 will shift to Huntsville, Alabama.\nChicago-based Boeing will close a plant that employs 290 people in in El Paso, Texas, and another that employs 70 people in Newington, Virginia. The company said the moves will reduce facility space by about 4.5 million square feet.\nThe Huntington Beach plant will remain open. Boeing spokesman Ken Smith declined to say how many workers will remain there.\nThe company will move an unspecified number of jobs from Kent, Washington, to Tukwila, Washington. The two towns are just 16 miles apart.\n\"In order to push ourselves farther and win more business, we need to make the most of our resources and talent,\" Leanne Caret, president and CEO of Boeing Defense, Space & Security, said in a statement. \"These steps will help us be a stronger partner for our customers worldwide.\"\nThe company said it also will align Boeing Defence Australia, Boeing Defense Saudi Arabia, and Boeing Defence United Kingdom into a new global operations group, led by David Pitchforth, managing director of Boeing Defence U.K.",

      "text": "Photo: New Times (file photo) The national carrier, RwandAir's latest acquisition Boeing 737-800NG is expected in Kigali today (4PM), having left Seattle, United States on Monday. The Boeing aircraft is the first of two new orders from the American manufacturer. The new aircraft christened 'Kalisimbi' is expected to increase the airline's fleet to ten aircraft and it is expected to facilitate the carrier's growing routes on the continent and beyond. The airline in September acquired brand new Airbus 330-200, -nicknamed 'Ubumwe' (unity). The expansion of the fleet is at a time when the airline is preparing to start flights to Gatwick, London's second-busiest airport next year and is also eyeing the American market in the course of 2017. In recent months the airline has launched flights to Cotonou, Benin and Abidjan, ivory coastbring the total number of destinations to 19 destinations. Others include including Nairobi, Entebbe, Mombasa, Bujumbura, Lusaka, Juba, Douala, Dar es Salaam, Kilimanjaro, Cotonou, Johannesburg, Dubai, Lagos, Libreville and Brazzaville. The airline is also set to open routes to Harare in Zimbabwe and Mumbai, India in coming days. The expansion is also based on projections that the airline's capacity could grow from the current 500,000 passengers annually to more than 3,000,000 in the next five years. RwandAir is IATA Operational Safety Audit (IOSA) certified. The globally-recognised and accepted evaluation certification confirms that the airline's operational management and control systems meet international civil aviation safety and other standards.

LOUIS — Boeing Co. plans to move about 2,500 positions to other sites, cut 500 jobs, and close two facilities by the end of 2020 as part of an effort to operate its Defense, Space & Security business more efficiently, the company said Tuesday. \nAbout 1,600 positions in Huntington Beach, California, will move to plants in three other Southern California locations — El Segundo, Long Beach and Seal Beach. About 500 positions will move to St. Louis County in Missouri, and 400 will shift to Huntsville, Alabama. \nChicago-based Boeing will close a plant that employs 290 people in El Paso, Texas, and another that employs 70 people in Newington, Virginia. The company said the moves will reduce facility space by about 4.5 million square feet. \nThe Huntington Beach plant will remain open. Boeing spokesman Ken Smith declined to say how many workers will remain there. \nThe company will move an unspecified number of jobs from Kent, Washington, to Tukwila, Washington. The two towns are just 16 miles apart. \n“In order to push ourselves farther and win more business, we need to make the most of our resources and talent,” Leanne Caret, president and CEO of Boeing Defense, Space & Security, said in a statement. “These steps will help us be a stronger partner for our customers worldwide.” \nThe company said it also will align Boeing Defence Australia, Boeing Defense Saudi Arabia, and Boeing Defence United Kingdom into a new global operations group, led by David Pitchforth, managing director of Boeing Defence U.K. ",

LOUIS (AP) — Boeing Co. plans to move about 2,500 positions to other sites, cut 500 jobs, and close two facilities by the end of 2020 as part of an effort to operate its Defense, Space & Security business more efficiently, the company said Tuesday. About 1,600 positions currently in Huntington Beach, California, will move to plants in three other Southern California locations -- El Segundo, Long Beach and Seal Beach. About 500 positions will move to St. Louis County in Missouri, and 400 will shift to Huntsville, Alabama. Chicago-based Boeing will close a plant that employs 290 people in in El Paso, Texas, and another that employs 70 people in Newington, Virginia. The company said the moves will reduce facility space by about 4.5 million square feet. The Huntington Beach plant will remain open. Boeing spokesman Ken Smith declined to say how many workers will remain there. The company will move an unspecified number of jobs from Kent, Washington, to Tukwila, Washington. The two towns are just 16 miles apart. \"In order to push ourselves farther and win more business, we need to make the most of our resources and talent,\" Leanne Caret , president and CEO of Boeing Defense, Space & Security, said in a statement. \"These steps will help us be a stronger partner for our customers worldwide.\" Most Read",

About 1,600 positions currently in Huntington Beach, Calif., will move to plants in three other Southern California locations -- El Segundo, Long Beach and Seal Beach. (Jeff Gritchen/The Orange County Register/SCNG via AP) \nST. LOUIS (AP) — Boeing Co. plans to move about 2,500 positions to other sites, cut 500 jobs, and close two facilities by the end of 2020 as part of an effort to operate its Defense, Space & Security business more efficiently, the company said Tuesday. \nAbout 1,600 positions currently in Huntington Beach, California, will move to plants in three other Southern California locations -- El Segundo, Long Beach and Seal Beach. About 500 positions will move to St. Louis County in Missouri, and 400 will shift to Huntsville, Alabama. \nChicago-based Boeing will close a plant that employs 290 people in in El Paso, Texas, and another that employs 70 people in Newington, Virginia. The company said the moves will reduce facility space by about 4.5 million square feet. \nThe Huntington Beach plant will remain open. Boeing spokesman Ken Smith declined to say how many workers will remain there.   \nThe company will move an unspecified number of jobs from Kent, Washington, to Tukwila, Washington. The two towns are just 16 miles apart. \n\"In order to push ourselves farther and win more business, we need to make the most of our resources and talent,\" Leanne Caret, president and CEO of Boeing Defense, Space & Security, said in a statement. \"These steps will help us be a stronger partner for our customers worldwide.\" \nThe company said it also will align Boeing Defence Australia, Boeing Defense Saudi Arabia, and Boeing Defence United Kingdom into a new global operations group, led by David Pitchforth, managing director of Boeing Defence U.K. Tags",

LOUIS (AP) - Boeing Co. plans to move about 2,500 positions to other sites, cut 500 jobs and close two facilities by the end of 2020 in an effort to make its Defense, Space & Security business more efficient, the company said Tuesday. \nAbout 1,600 positions currently in Huntington Beach, California, will move to plants in three other Southern California locations -- El Segundo, Long Beach and Seal Beach. About 500 positions will move to St. Louis County in Missouri, and 400 will shift to Huntsville, Alabama. \nChicago-based Boeing will close a plant that employs 290 people in in El Paso, Texas, and another that employs 70 people in Newington, Virginia. The company said the moves will reduce facility space by about 4.5 million square feet. \nThe Huntington Beach plant will remain open. Boeing spokesman Ken Smith declined to say how many workers will remain there. \nThe company will move an unspecified number of jobs from Kent, Washington, to Tukwila, Washington. The two towns are just 16 miles apart. \n\"In order to push ourselves farther and win more business, we need to make the most of our resources and talent,\" Leanne Caret, president and CEO of Boeing Defense, Space & Security, said in a statement. \"These steps will help us be a stronger partner for our customers worldwide.\" \nThe company said it also will align Boeing Defence Australia, Boeing Defense Saudi Arabia, and Boeing Defence United Kingdom into a new global operations group, led by David Pitchforth, managing director of Boeing Defence U.K.",

LOUIS (AP) - Boeing Co. plans to move about 2,500 positions to other sites, cut 500 jobs and close two facilities by the end of 2020 in an effort to make its Defense, Space & Security business more efficient, the company said Tuesday. \nAbout 1,600 positions currently in Huntington Beach, California, will move to plants in three other Southern California locations -- El Segundo, Long Beach and Seal Beach. About 500 positions will move to St. Louis County in Missouri, and 400 will shift to Huntsville, Alabama. \nChicago-based Boeing will close a plant that employs 290 people in in El Paso, Texas, and another that employs 70 people in Newington, Virginia. The company said the moves will reduce facility space by about 4.5 million square feet. \nThe Huntington Beach plant will remain open. Boeing spokesman Ken Smith declined to say how many workers will remain there. \nThe company will move an unspecified number of jobs from Kent, Washington, to Tukwila, Washington. The two towns are just 16 miles apart. \n\"In order to push ourselves farther and win more business, we need to make the most of our resources and talent,\" Leanne Caret, president and CEO of Boeing Defense, Space & Security, said in a statement. \"These steps will help us be a stronger partner for our customers worldwide.\" \nThe company said it also will align Boeing Defence Australia, Boeing Defense Saudi Arabia, and Boeing Defence United Kingdom into a new global operations group, led by David Pitchforth, managing director of Boeing Defence U.K. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

LOUIS (AP) - Boeing Co. plans to move about 2,500 positions to other sites, cut 500 jobs and close two facilities by the end of 2020 in an effort to make its Defense, Space & Security business more efficient, the company said Tuesday. \nAbout 1,600 positions currently in Huntington Beach, California, will move to plants in three other Southern California locations -- El Segundo, Long Beach and Seal Beach. About 500 positions will move to St. Louis County in Missouri, and 400 will shift to Huntsville, Alabama. \nChicago-based Boeing will close a plant that employs 290 people in in El Paso, Texas, and another that employs 70 people in Newington, Virginia. The company said the moves will reduce facility space by about 4.5 million square feet. \nThe Huntington Beach plant will remain open. Boeing spokesman Ken Smith declined to say how many workers will remain there. \nThe company will move an unspecified number of jobs from Kent, Washington, to Tukwila, Washington. The two towns are just 16 miles apart. \n\"In order to push ourselves farther and win more business, we need to make the most of our resources and talent,\" Leanne Caret, president and CEO of Boeing Defense, Space & Security, said in a statement. \"These steps will help us be a stronger partner for our customers worldwide.\" \nThe company said it also will align Boeing Defence Australia, Boeing Defense Saudi Arabia, and Boeing Defence United Kingdom into a new global operations group, led by David Pitchforth, managing director of Boeing Defence U.K. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

LOUIS (AP) - Boeing Co. plans to move about 2,500 positions to other sites, cut 500 jobs and close two facilities by the end of 2020 in an effort to make its Defense, Space & Security business more efficient, the company said Tuesday. \nAbout 1,600 positions currently in Huntington Beach, California, will move to plants in three other Southern California locations -- El Segundo, Long Beach and Seal Beach. About 500 positions will move to St. Louis County in Missouri, and 400 will shift to Huntsville, Alabama. \nChicago-based Boeing will close a plant that employs 290 people in in El Paso, Texas, and another that employs 70 people in Newington, Virginia. The company said the moves will reduce facility space by about 4.5 million square feet. \nThe Huntington Beach plant will remain open. Boeing spokesman Ken Smith declined to say how many workers will remain there. \nThe company will move an unspecified number of jobs from Kent, Washington, to Tukwila, Washington. The two towns are just 16 miles apart. \n\"In order to push ourselves farther and win more business, we need to make the most of our resources and talent,\" Leanne Caret, president and CEO of Boeing Defense, Space & Security, said in a statement. \"These steps will help us be a stronger partner for our customers worldwide.\" \nThe company said it also will align Boeing Defence Australia, Boeing Defense Saudi Arabia, and Boeing Defence United Kingdom into a new global operations group, led by David Pitchforth, managing director of Boeing Defence U.K. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

      "text": "Boeing Co. said Tuesday it would cut 500 net jobs over the next four years from its defense and space business in Southern California as it shrinks work at its Huntington Beach facility and closes two smaller plants in Texas and Virginia.\nThe aerospace company BA, -1.25% plans to transfer work on a range of military, space and commercial aircraft programs to existing facilities, cutting the amount of manufacturing and office space at its domestic plants by 4.5 million square feet from an existing total of around 80 million square feet, a trim of almost 6%.\nThe Pentagon has said the U.S. military has 20% more facility space than it needs, though Congress has opposed more base closures. Defense companies such as Lockheed Martin Corp. and Raytheon Co. have been cutting their own real estate holdings by around 10% in recent years.\nAn expanded version of this report appears at WSJ.com.\nPopular now on WSJ.com:\nDonald Trump’s Transition Team Reshaped\nYuan Slides to Lowest Level in Nearly Eight Years\nMore from MarketWatch Bernie Sanders has some harsh words for the Clinton campaign in his new book Lawsuits Against Donald Trump to Move Forward Should Parents Engage Their Young Teen in Arguments?",

      "text": "By JIM SALTER\nAssociated Press ST. LOUIS (AP) - Boeing Co. plans to move about 2,500 positions to other sites, cut 500 jobs and close two facilities by the end of 2020 in an effort to make its Defense, Space & Security business more efficient, the company said Tuesday.\nAbout 1,600 positions currently in Huntington Beach, California, will move to plants in three other Southern California locations -- El Segundo, Long Beach and Seal Beach. About 500 positions will move to St. Louis County in Missouri, and 400 will shift to Huntsville, Alabama.\nChicago-based Boeing will close a plant that employs 290 people in in El Paso, Texas, and another that employs 70 people in Newington, Virginia. The company said the moves will reduce facility space by about 4.5 million square feet.\nThe Huntington Beach plant will remain open. Boeing spokesman Ken Smith declined to say how many workers will remain there.\nThe company will move an unspecified number of jobs from Kent, Washington, to Tukwila, Washington. The two towns are just 16 miles apart.\n\"In order to push ourselves farther and win more business, we need to make the most of our resources and talent,\" Leanne Caret, president and CEO of Boeing Defense, Space & Security, said in a statement. \"These steps will help us be a stronger partner for our customers worldwide.\"\nThe company said it also will align Boeing Defence Australia, Boeing Defense Saudi Arabia, and Boeing Defence United Kingdom into a new global operations group, led by David Pitchforth, managing director of Boeing Defence U.K.\nCopyright 2016 The Associated Press.

      "text": "Boeing to cut some jobs, move others, in efficiency effort By JIM SALTER   7:30 AM EST The Boeing Co. building is seen in Huntington Beach, Calif., Tuesday, Nov. 15, 2016. Boeing Co. plans to move about 2,500 positions to other sites, cut 500 jobs, and close two facilities by the end of 2020 as part of an effort to operate its Defense, Space & Security business more efficiently, the company said Tuesday. About 1,600 positions currently in Huntington Beach, Calif., will move to plants in three other Southern California locations -- El Segundo, Long Beach and Seal Beach. (Jeff Gritchen/The Orange County Register/SCNG via AP) \nST. LOUIS (AP) — Boeing Co. plans to move about 2,500 positions to other sites, cut 500 jobs and close two facilities by the end of 2020 in an effort to make its Defense, Space & Security business more efficient, the company said Tuesday. \nAbout 1,600 positions currently in Huntington Beach, California, will move to plants in three other Southern California locations -- El Segundo, Long Beach and Seal Beach. About 500 positions will move to St. Louis County in Missouri, and 400 will shift to Huntsville, Alabama. \nChicago-based Boeing will close a plant that employs 290 people in in El Paso, Texas, and another that employs 70 people in Newington, Virginia. The company said the moves will reduce facility space by about 4.5 million square feet. \nThe Huntington Beach plant will remain open. Boeing spokesman Ken Smith declined to say how many workers will remain there. \nThe company will move an unspecified number of jobs from Kent, Washington, to Tukwila, Washington. The two towns are just 16 miles apart. \n\"In order to push ourselves farther and win more business, we need to make the most of our resources and talent,\" Leanne Caret, president and CEO of Boeing Defense, Space & Security, said in a statement. \"These steps will help us be a stronger partner for our customers worldwide.\" \nThe company said it also will align Boeing Defence Australia, Boeing Defense Saudi Arabia, and Boeing Defence United Kingdom into a new global operations group, led by David Pitchforth, managing director of Boeing Defence U.K.",

LOUIS (AP) - Boeing Co. plans to move about 2,500 positions to other sites, cut 500 jobs and close two facilities by the end of 2020 in an effort to make its Defense, Space & Security business more efficient, the company said Tuesday. \nAbout 1,600 positions currently in Huntington Beach, California, will move to plants in three other Southern California locations -- El Segundo, Long Beach and Seal Beach. About 500 positions will move to St. Louis County in Missouri, and 400 will shift to Huntsville, Alabama. \nChicago-based Boeing will close a plant that employs 290 people in in El Paso, Texas, and another that employs 70 people in Newington, Virginia. The company said the moves will reduce facility space by about 4.5 million square feet. \nThe Huntington Beach plant will remain open. Boeing spokesman Ken Smith declined to say how many workers will remain there. \nThe company will move an unspecified number of jobs from Kent, Washington, to Tukwila, Washington. The two towns are just 16 miles apart. \n\"In order to push ourselves farther and win more business, we need to make the most of our resources and talent,\" Leanne Caret, president and CEO of Boeing Defense, Space & Security, said in a statement. \"These steps will help us be a stronger partner for our customers worldwide.\" \nThe company said it also will align Boeing Defence Australia, Boeing Defense Saudi Arabia, and Boeing Defence United Kingdom into a new global operations group, led by David Pitchforth, managing director of Boeing Defence U.K. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

LOUIS (AP) - Boeing Co. plans to move about 2,500 positions to other sites, cut 500 jobs and close two facilities by the end of 2020 in an effort to make its Defense, Space & Security business more efficient, the company said Tuesday. \nAbout 1,600 positions currently in Huntington Beach, California, will move to plants in three other Southern California locations -- El Segundo, Long Beach and Seal Beach. About 500 positions will move to St. Louis County in Missouri, and 400 will shift to Huntsville, Alabama. \nChicago-based Boeing will close a plant that employs 290 people in in El Paso, Texas, and another that employs 70 people in Newington, Virginia. The company said the moves will reduce facility space by about 4.5 million square feet. \nThe Huntington Beach plant will remain open. Boeing spokesman Ken Smith declined to say how many workers will remain there. \nThe company will move an unspecified number of jobs from Kent, Washington, to Tukwila, Washington. The two towns are just 16 miles apart. \n\"In order to push ourselves farther and win more business, we need to make the most of our resources and talent,\" Leanne Caret, president and CEO of Boeing Defense, Space & Security, said in a statement. \"These steps will help us be a stronger partner for our customers worldwide.\" \nThe company said it also will align Boeing Defence Australia, Boeing Defense Saudi Arabia, and Boeing Defence United Kingdom into a new global operations group, led by David Pitchforth, managing director of Boeing Defence U.K. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

(Jeff Gritchen/The Orange County Register/SCNG via AP) \nST. LOUIS (AP) — Boeing Co. plans to move about 2,500 positions to other sites, cut 500 jobs and close two facilities by the end of 2020 in an effort to make its Defense, Space & Security business more efficient, the company said Tuesday. \nAbout 1,600 positions currently in Huntington Beach, California, will move to plants in three other Southern California locations -- El Segundo, Long Beach and Seal Beach. About 500 positions will move to St. Louis County in Missouri, and 400 will shift to Huntsville, Alabama. \nChicago-based Boeing will close a plant that employs 290 people in in El Paso, Texas, and another that employs 70 people in Newington, Virginia. The company said the moves will reduce facility space by about 4.5 million square feet. \nThe Huntington Beach plant will remain open. Boeing spokesman Ken Smith declined to say how many workers will remain there. \nThe company will move an unspecified number of jobs from Kent, Washington, to Tukwila, Washington. The two towns are just 16 miles apart. \n\"In order to push ourselves farther and win more business, we need to make the most of our resources and talent,\" Leanne Caret, president and CEO of Boeing Defense, Space & Security, said in a statement. \"These steps will help us be a stronger partner for our customers worldwide.\" \nThe company said it also will align Boeing Defence Australia, Boeing Defense Saudi Arabia, and Boeing Defence United Kingdom into a new global operations group, led by David Pitchforth, managing director of Boeing Defence U.K. Tags",

(Jeff Gritchen/The Orange County Register/SCNG via AP) By JIM SALTER The Associated Press ST. LOUIS — \nBoeing Co. plans to move about 2,500 positions to other sites, cut 500 jobs and close two facilities by the end of 2020 in an effort to make its Defense, Space & Security business more efficient, the company said Tuesday. \nAbout 1,600 positions currently in Huntington Beach, California, will move to plants in three other Southern California locations -- El Segundo, Long Beach and Seal Beach. About 500 positions will move to St. Louis County in Missouri, and 400 will shift to Huntsville, Alabama. \nChicago-based Boeing will close a plant that employs 290 people in in El Paso, Texas, and another that employs 70 people in Newington, Virginia. The company said the moves will reduce facility space by about 4.5 million square feet. \nThe Huntington Beach plant will remain open. Boeing spokesman Ken Smith declined to say how many workers will remain there. \nThe company will move an unspecified number of jobs from Kent, Washington, to Tukwila, Washington. The two towns are just 16 miles apart. \n\"In order to push ourselves farther and win more business, we need to make the most of our resources and talent,\" Leanne Caret, president and CEO of Boeing Defense, Space & Security, said in a statement. \"These steps will help us be a stronger partner for our customers worldwide.\" \nThe company said it also will align Boeing Defence Australia, Boeing Defense Saudi Arabia, and Boeing Defence United Kingdom into a new global operations group, led by David Pitchforth, managing director of Boeing Defence U.K. Copyright The Associated Press \nThere are no comments yet.

The company said the moves will reduce facility space by about 4.5 million square feet. \nThe Huntington Beach plant will remain open. Boeing spokesman Ken Smith declined to say how many workers will remain there. \nThe company will move an unspecified number of jobs from Kent, Washington, to Tukwila, Washington. The two towns are just 16 miles apart. \n\"In order to push ourselves farther and win more business, we need to make the most of our resources and talent,\" Leanne Caret, president and CEO of Boeing Defense, Space & Security, said in a statement. \"These steps will help us be a stronger partner for our customers worldwide.\" \nThe company said it also will align Boeing Defence Australia, Boeing Defense Saudi Arabia, and Boeing Defence United Kingdom into a new global operations group, led by David Pitchforth, managing director of Boeing Defence U.K. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

      "text": "Boeing to cut some jobs, move others, in efficiency effort By Jim Salter, Associated Press Posted: # Comments \nST. LOUIS (AP)  Boeing Co. plans to move about 2,500 positions to other sites, cut 500 jobs and close two facilities by the end of 2020 in an effort to make its Defense, Space & Security business more efficient, the company said Tuesday. \nAbout 1,600 positions currently in Huntington Beach, California, will move to plants in three other Southern California locations -- El Segundo, Long Beach and Seal Beach. About 500 positions will move to St. Louis County in Missouri, and 400 will shift to Huntsville, Alabama. \nChicago-based Boeing will close a plant that employs 290 people in in El Paso, Texas, and another that employs 70 people in Newington, Virginia. The company said the moves will reduce facility space by about 4.5 million square feet. \nThe Huntington Beach plant will remain open. Boeing spokesman Ken Smith declined to say how many workers will remain there. Advertisement \nThe company will move an unspecified number of jobs from Kent, Washington, to Tukwila, Washington. The two towns are just 16 miles apart. \n\"In order to push ourselves farther and win more business, we need to make the most of our resources and talent,\" Leanne Caret, president and CEO of Boeing Defense, Space & Security, said in a statement. \"These steps will help us be a stronger partner for our customers worldwide.\" \nThe company said it also will align Boeing Defence Australia, Boeing Defense Saudi Arabia, and Boeing Defence United Kingdom into a new global operations group, led by David Pitchforth, managing director of Boeing Defence U.K.",

(Jeff Gritchen/The Orange County Register/SCNG via AP) \nST. LOUIS (AP) — Boeing Co. plans to move about 2,500 positions to other sites, cut 500 jobs and close two facilities by the end of 2020 in an effort to make its Defense, Space & Security business more efficient, the company said Tuesday. \nAbout 1,600 positions currently in Huntington Beach, California, will move to plants in three other Southern California locations -- El Segundo, Long Beach and Seal Beach. About 500 positions will move to St. Louis County in Missouri, and 400 will shift to Huntsville, Alabama. \nChicago-based Boeing will close a plant that employs 290 people in in El Paso, Texas, and another that employs 70 people in Newington, Virginia. The company said the moves will reduce facility space by about 4.5 million square feet. \nThe Huntington Beach plant will remain open. Boeing spokesman Ken Smith declined to say how many workers will remain there. \nThe company will move an unspecified number of jobs from Kent, Washington, to Tukwila, Washington. The two towns are just 16 miles apart. \n\"In order to push ourselves farther and win more business, we need to make the most of our resources and talent,\" Leanne Caret, president and CEO of Boeing Defense, Space & Security, said in a statement. \"These steps will help us be a stronger partner for our customers worldwide.\" \nThe company said it also will align Boeing Defence Australia, Boeing Defense Saudi Arabia, and Boeing Defence United Kingdom into a new global operations group, led by David Pitchforth, managing director of Boeing Defence U.K. Tags",

Boeing Co. plans to move about 2,500 positions to other sites, cut 500 jobs, and close two facilities by the end of 2020 as part of an effort to operate its Defense, Space & Security business more efficiently, the company said Tuesday. About 1,600 positions currently in Huntington Beach, Calif., will move to plants in three other Southern California locations -- El Segundo, Long Beach and Seal Beach. (Jeff Gritchen/The Orange County Register/SCNG via AP) comments ST. LOUIS — Boeing Co. plans to move about 2,500 positions to other sites, cut 500 jobs and close two facilities by the end of 2020 in an effort to make its Defense, Space & Security business more efficient, the company said Tuesday.\nAbout 1,600 positions currently in Huntington Beach, California, will move to plants in three other Southern California locations -- El Segundo, Long Beach and Seal Beach. About 500 positions will move to St. Louis County in Missouri, and 400 will shift to Huntsville, Alabama.\nChicago-based Boeing will close a plant that employs 290 people in in El Paso, Texas, and another that employs 70 people in Newington, Virginia. The company said the moves will reduce facility space by about 4.5 million square feet.\nThe Huntington Beach plant will remain open. Boeing spokesman Ken Smith declined to say how many workers will remain there.\nThe company will move an unspecified number of jobs from Kent, Washington, to Tukwila, Washington. The two towns are just 16 miles apart.\n\"In order to push ourselves farther and win more business, we need to make the most of our resources and talent,\" Leanne Caret, president and CEO of Boeing Defense, Space & Security, said in a statement. \"These steps will help us be a stronger partner for our customers worldwide.\"\nThe company said it also will align Boeing Defence Australia, Boeing Defense Saudi Arabia, and Boeing Defence United Kingdom into a new global operations group, led by David Pitchforth, managing director of Boeing Defence U.K.",

LOUIS (AP) - Boeing Co. plans to move about 2,500 positions to other sites, cut 500 jobs and close two facilities by the end of 2020 in an effort to make its Defense, Space & Security business more efficient, the company said Tuesday. \nAbout 1,600 positions currently in Huntington Beach, California, will move to plants in three other Southern California locations -- El Segundo, Long Beach and Seal Beach. About 500 positions will move to St. Louis County in Missouri, and 400 will shift to Huntsville, Alabama. \nChicago-based Boeing will close a plant that employs 290 people in in El Paso, Texas, and another that employs 70 people in Newington, Virginia. The company said the moves will reduce facility space by about 4.5 million square feet. \nThe Huntington Beach plant will remain open. Boeing spokesman Ken Smith declined to say how many workers will remain there. \nThe company will move an unspecified number of jobs from Kent, Washington, to Tukwila, Washington. The two towns are just 16 miles apart. \n\"In order to push ourselves farther and win more business, we need to make the most of our resources and talent,\" Leanne Caret, president and CEO of Boeing Defense, Space & Security, said in a statement. \"These steps will help us be a stronger partner for our customers worldwide.\" \nThe company said it also will align Boeing Defence Australia, Boeing Defense Saudi Arabia, and Boeing Defence United Kingdom into a new global operations group, led by David Pitchforth, managing director of Boeing Defence U.K. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.
