      "text": "Photo: Rob Kim/Getty Images for Amazon \nIf it’s been too long since your last crying jag, we’ve got one more reason for you to take another bathroom break at work today. In a video posted on Twitter, Miley Cyrus weeps and sniffles her way through an appreciation for the contributions of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, and even works her way around to saying she accepts Donald Trump as a president, and hopes he can unite us in this most divisive time. For every Hillary supporter, and really for every disillusioned millennial, Cyrus really hits a lot of the right notes here, as she mourns not only the results of the presidential election, but Clinton’s personal loss. “I still think that in her lifetime she deserves to be the first female president,” says Cyrus. “And that’s what makes me so sad, is that I just wish she had that opportunity, because she’s fought for so long, and because I believe her when she says she loves this country. She has given her life to make it better.” To her great credit, Cyrus even avoids slipping into easy cynicism, which everyone has a right to access for a while in the wake of Clinton’s heartbreaking concession speech this morning, and closes her video with a plea for unification. Carry on crying.\nâ¤ď¸đâ¤ď¸đâ¤ď¸đ pic.twitter.com/kuETRP7tb0 \n— Miley Ray Cyrus (@MileyCyrus) November 9, 2016",

      "text": "Ambika Chopra November 9, 2016 2 min read Inc42 Staff 84 SHARES \nIn what can be said as a reactionary move to India’s decision of demonetisation and digitisation, ecommerce giants like Flipkart , Snapdeal , Amazon India , and Shopclues have revised their customer policies. \nAs per a report by ET, online marketplace Amazon India has currently disabled the cash-on-delivery payment option for all its orders. Whereas its rival Flipkart has restricted the COD option for orders above INR 1000, and Snapdeal for orders above INR 2000. \nWhen contacted via email by Inc42, an official spokesperson from Flipkart stated, “We welcome this bold and historic initiative by the Government of India. This will enable India to move faster towards digital payments and will be a game changer for Flipkart and for the ecommerce industry. Meanwhile, we urge our customers to opt for alternative payment modes such as card on delivery, internet banking, credit and debit cards, gift cards, and our easy and convenient PhonePe wallet. We are also working on a slew of measures to help customers easily transition from cash to digital payments.” \nIn a nation like India, where people are still comparatively apprehensive about switching to digital modes of transactions and around 60% of the purchases are made via the COD mode, this move might bring an initial slow down in sales via these platforms. \nCommenting on the development, an official spokesperson from Snapdeal said, “All Snapdeal users who have already placed Cash on Delivery orders can pay for their deliveries using any currency notes except the INR 500 & INR 1000 notes discontinued by RBI. Users also have the option to defer the delivery by a few days till new currency notes become easily available. As an interim measure, we have restricted new COD orders to INR 2000 to make it convenient for the buyers and the delivery personnel. The COD limits will get increased gradually over the next few days.” \nWith this major shift in the economic model of the country, these ecommerce sites may face a slow down in the near future, but the move will ultimately be beneficial for the companies, since it will ultimately lead to the reduction in number of cash on delivery orders, thereby improving the unit economics in the longer run.

      "text": "Linked By John Voorhees \nLast month, Amazon announced a new perk for Prime members in the US called Prime Reading, a collection of approximately one thousand books and magazines that Prime members can read for free. Today, Amazon added Prime Reading to its Kindle app for iOS . \nFrom the Kindle app's Library view tapping the Prime Reading link opens a searchable list of 1,016 books that are available as part of the program. The selection of books and magazines is a small fraction of what is available to purchase from Amazon or download with its Kindle Unlimited program, but it includes several classics like The Hobbit and Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone , as well as newer selections like What If?: Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions and the first volume of the Scott Pilgrim's Precious Little Life graphic novel series. Also, unlike paid Kindle books, which you can only purchase from Amazon's website, Prime Reading books can be downloaded directly within the Kindle app, a reminder of how I wished the app worked for all books. Adding a Prime Reading book.",

By: FE Bureau | New Delhi  30 AM \nThe demonetisation of R500 and R1,000 notes will aid the e-commerce firms to move towards pre-paid options in a big way, while reducing the cash-on-delivery (CoD) option. \nFirms like Snapdeal and Flipkart on Wednesday put a cap of R2,000 for new cash-on-delivery orders, while Amazon India completely stopped cash-on-delivery in the aftermath of the development. \n“Currently, we have temporarily stopped cash as a payment option for new orders. Customers that had already placed cash on delivery orders before midnight 8/11 can pay for their orders using debit or credit cards or currency of valid denominations. For future orders, we are working on alternatives to make doorstep payments easier for customers by introducing a variety of electronic payment options. We will shortly reintroduce cash payment on delivery and also provide an improved selection of payment methods — both online and at customers’ doorsteps to offer a seamless experience,” Amazon said in a statement. On its part, Snapdeal said that CoD limits will be increased gradually over the next few days. The company is providing its customers, who have a shortage of smaller currency notes, an option to get their delivery deferred by a few days till new currency notes become easily available. \nAccording to KPMG, more than 30 lakh orders are in the pipeline to be delivered on cash-on-delivery from Wednesday. The average order value of the orders is estimated to be around R1,800. Hence, orders worth about R540 crore is yet to be delivered. \nMeanwhile, online grocery firm Grofers has devised a new mechanism of payment in addition to existing digital payment options. It is sending a payment link on a customers’ email or in the form of a message to their mobiles. The customers can then click on the link, which directs them to a payment gateway to make the payment. “As our average order value is R1,000, consumers mostly like to pay in cash. Hence, we have devised this new mechanism to ensure consumers continue to shop online,” said Albinder Dhindsa, CEO, Grofers. \nAnalysts point out that internet firms need to devise a payment mechanism soon. According to industry estimates, on an average 10 lakh orders are dispatched every day by e-commerce firms. Of this, 6 lakh orders fall under CoD. “Unless an immediate wallet pay on delivery model is devised, many of them may get cancelled, or clog the logistics network with significant delays in delivery,” said Sreedhar Prasad, partner, e-commerce and start-ups, KPMG in India. \nMeanwhile, digital wallet firms have witnessed a surge in transactions as consumers are using various wallets like Paytm and FreeCharge, besides individual wallets operated by companies. For example, Paytm claims to have reported a 250% increase in overall transaction with transaction value going up by 200%. Likewise, Freecharge claims to have reported 12 times jump in the average wallet balance.  ",

While Reviewed.com may receive a small share of the revenue from your purchase, editorial opinions are independent from any business sales.\nToday and tomorrow, Prime members can get Amazon's Dash Buttons—normally $4.99 each—for just $0.99 using code \"REVIEWDASH\" at checkout (limit three per customer).\nIf you haven't encountered the Dash buttons before, they're little branded buttons that link to your Amazon account and let you push the button to re-order whatever product the button links to (Cheez-Its, Pop-Tarts, Milk-Bones, and so on).\nNot only can you get your very own little Dash buttons for $0.99, but Amazon is actually giving a $4.99 credit for each purchase —yep, they're essentially paying you $4 to buy a button.\nBecause it's limited to three discounted Dash buttons per Prime customer, your max gain from this button bargain is $12. But still, it's not every day you get paid $12 to push buttons—dash off and get some!\nBuy an Amazon Dash Button for $0.99, get a $4.99 credit with code \"REVIEWDASH\"\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2fDcWd8 Most Popular Cyber 'SWAT' teams gird for Election Day trouble 773 Shares The best Black Friday deals on Amazon right now 4.6k Shares Costco, Staples preview Black Friday tech deals 2.1k Shares Canadian immigration site crashes 5.7k Shares Why your washing machine smells, and how to clean it 2.9k Shares Supersized!

      "text": "\nThe NES Classic is one of the more sought-after holiday items this year, and it has been relatively difficult to secure days before its launch. A few retailers held brief pre-order periods, but anyone who didn't get in on those is left hoping there will be ample supply on Friday, November 11 when it releases.\nAmazon, like most places, won't open pre-orders but we do know exactly when it'll have some NES Classics to purchase. An email was just sent out to interested Amazon customers that the mini console will be available on Friday at 2pm Pacific. Here's the product page just in case you want to keep tabs on it; we'll also put up a reminder post on Friday afternoon.\nThere are a few circumstances that are unique to the NES Classic since it's an item that Amazon says will have \"very limited quantities\" (although more are expected in the coming weeks). The NES Classic is restricted to one per customer. Further, one-click ordering is turned off. Because of the high demand, make sure you have your credit card and shipping details sorted ahead of time.\nWith this heads-up, most people should be able to nab one if they want one -- that is, if they have the benefit of not doing anything else at this very specific moment. Those without that luxury might find themselves waiting a couple of weeks.\nNintendo Entertainment System: NES Classic Edition [Amazon] ",

      "text": "Hands down, the biggest story in retail in recent years has been the rise of e-commerce. This major disruptive force has changed the way that businesses operate, as well as influencing consumer preferences.\nAs consumers find it more convenient to shop online, rather than getting in the car and driving to the mall, traditional retailers have watched their revenues plunge.\nYet investors who got in early on e-commerce have done well , and such companies as Amazon , Alibaba Group and Baidu continue to thrive. But intelligent investors can also benefit from purchasing shares of major package delivery services, most of all, FedEx ( FDX ) and United Parcel Service ( UPS ) . Their growth is intertwined with e-commerce sites.\nFedex\nFirst-quarter numbers for FedEx reflect how the company is running evenly with explosive e-commerce momentum. Fedex shares are up about 22% this year.\nAs e-commerce has grown in significance and capacity during the past few years, consumers have started ordering larger items over the internet, including big household appliances and pieces of furniture. This means that FedEx has had to re-engineer its ground delivery capabilities from delivering mostly smaller parcels. By smartly hiking surcharges for bulky shipments and by testing new equipment and facilities better suited to handle big items from e-commerce, FedEx has managed to address this altering landscape.\nThese capabilities are particularly important as the holiday season approaches.\nSales from e-commerce are projected to rise 11% this year, to $91.6 billion . Experts suggest that FedEx could expect roughly 10% growth in holiday season shipping volumes. That figure could go even higher - industry tracker ShipMatrix has penciled in a 14% increase for FedEx.\nFedEx is positioned for nearly 11% annual earnings per share (EPS) growth for the next five years, over 270 basis points faster than the S&P 500 during this period.",

      "title": "Amazon Vouchers Offered Monthly for Costa Ricans in USA Who Top Up Claro Mobiles in Costa Rica on LlamaCostaRica.com",
      "text": "LlamaCostaRica.com offers on a monthly basis 11 Amazon vouchers of $40 or $100 to 11 Costa Ricans who make international mobile top ups from the USA to Claro Costa Rica on the website. Expats who make such top ups until April 30, 2017, enter automatically the raffle for one of these Amazon vouchers. The promotion addresses Costa Ricans living in the USA and their families and friends in Costa Rica, who are the direct beneficiaries. The offer is available until the end of April, 2017, for mobile top ups of minimum $10 on LlamaCostaRica.com: https://llamacostarica.com/buy/mobile_recharge The chance to win an Amazon voucher of $40 or $100 requires a customer to top up a Claro mobile in Costa Rica from the USA until April 30, 2017 on LlamaCostaRica.com. Each month, the website will single out 11 people randomly. Prizes vary according to the amount recharged on LlamaCostaRica.com:\n-10 Amazon vouchers of $40 each will be offered for top ups higher than $10;\n-1 Amazon voucher of $100 will be offered for top ups higher than $25.\nAnyone living in the USA can benefit of this promotion . The only condition is to have a free account on LlamaCostaRica.com and send a minimum of $10 as mobile credit to a Claro mobile in Costa Rica. It takes seconds to open an account and few more seconds to send the Claro credit, as existing customers point out on review platforms.\nFor Costa Ricans in the USA, who send Claro credit to mobiles in Costa Rica, this is a win-win situation. Besides the $10 minimum credit they send to Claro mobiles, they get something themselves: one of the $40 worth Amazon vouchers or the unique $100 voucher. The current promotion is available with the service called Mobile Recharge on LlamaCostaRica.com .\nThe winner will be singled out randomly among those who send Claro credit of minimum $10 on LlamaCostaRica.com to someone in Costa Rica, until April 30, 2017. The winners will be contacted by phone in maximum 48 hours. The voucher will be sent by email in maximum 7 business days.\nThere are also backup winners besides the 11 winners each month. If the winner can not be contacted during the mentioned time, the prize will be offered to the backup winner.\nA customer can have multiple entries, yet a participant can only win once during the campaign. The Amazon vouchers cannot be exchanged to cash or other prizes. More details are available on LlamaCostaRica.com.\nBesides this promotion, offers run monthly on LlamaCostaRica.com for Claro, as well as for top ups to the other phone providers in the country: Kolbi, FullMovil, Movistar and Tuyo. The online top up process takes less than 1 minute and the credit gets to the destination instantly. Plus, it saves a lot of time and hassle to top up online on LlamaCostaRica.com.\nLlamaCostaRica.com offers a full expat service. Besides the online Mobile Recharge service, it also facilitates international calls to Costa Rica through the Voice Credit service. There are at least 3 big advantages about this service, that makes LlamaCostaRica.com stand out on the global market:\n-Balance never expires.\n-The lowest price to call Costa Rica is 1.2 cents/minute. In other words, one can get up to 526 minutes for a $10 Voice Credit purchase.\n-Voice Credit balance can be used to make calls to other destinations in the world.\nThank You points are offered on any regular purchase on LlamaCostaRica.com, outside the promotional period. Once these points reach 1000, they can be converted into $10 Voice Credit for free calls to Costa Rica and other parts of the world.\nLlamaCostaRica.com makes available 3 ways to call for each customer:\n-From any phone to any phone, through the use of access numbers;\n-From one's laptop or computer, through the Web Call application;\n-Using KeepCalling app on any smartphone or device using Android or iOS..\nLlamaCostaRica.com is a website dedicated to the Costa Rican diaspora worldwide. The website is a brand of KeepCalling, a global telecommunications company registered in 2002 in the USA. Presently, KeepCalling provides its services to hundreds of thousands of consumers and businesses, with a focus on customer satisfaction.

      "text": "Amazon Expecting ‘Limited Quantities’ of NES Classic Share. Got feedback on our player? We want to hear it. Purchases of the console are limited to one per customer, and the company said that 1-Click Ordering will be disabled for NES Classic Edition. “We have very limited quantities of this item,” an email from the company said, “however we will be receiving additional quantities over the coming weeks. Please act quickly at 2:00 p.m. PT on Friday for your best chance at buying an NES Classic.” You can find the Amazon listing for the NES Classic at this link. Amazon said that demand is expected to be ‘very high,’ and there are no guarantee that the NES Classic Edition will remain in stock for long. The company stated that it will release similar update announcements when additional inventory becomes available. The online retailer reminded customers to make sure they’ve updated purchase and shipping information to help speed up the checkout process. Got feedback on our player? We want to hear it. The NES Classic is preloaded with 30 games, comes with a single NES Classic Controller, and will be sold for $59.99 USD. Additional controllers are sold for $9.99 USD, but they are not mentioned in Amazon’s email. The first system in Nintendo’s ‘Classic’ label was announced last July . Few US retailers have taken pre-orders in the lead up to the NES Classic Edition’s release. GameStop announced it would not accept pre-orders, but a source told IGN that some locations would be receiving up to 12 units per store. These are all sure signs that the NES Classic will be a difficult product to pick up this holiday. Nintendo has made no announcements on the pre-order status of the system at major retailers, but the company posted on Facebook that the first 250 people in attendance at Nintendo World NY Store's retro '80s bash will be among the first to purchase the system in the US.

      "text": "Amazon, Microsoft Capitalize On Cloud-Computing Bonanza Cloud-computing growth is accelerating, says Nomura. (©Nataraj - Fotolia/stock.adobe.com) Reprints \nSpending on cloud-computing services continues to accelerate, with Amazon ( AMZN ) and Microsoft ( MSFT ) key drivers of growth, says investment bank Nomura. \nNomura estimates capital spending on cloud services hit $45 billion in 2015, up 24% from the $36 billion in 2014. It said much of the growth has gone to Amazon's Amazon Web Services and Microsoft's Azure and Office365 cloud services. \n\"The revenue trends here are robust as ever, which lends confidence to our view that capital expenditures will continue to expand,\" Nomura said in a research report. Amazon and Microsoft \"account for a material percentage of the growth of traditional IT hardware spending,\" Nomura said. IBD'S TAKE: Microsoft has been riding high since it reported better-than-expected September-quarter results , boosted by its cloud offerings. Amazon is the leader in web services, with sales last year topping $10 billion, putting it in prime position to benefit from the accelerated use of cloud services. \nNomura said it surveyed 50 global chief information officers in early October to gauge their spending priorities. Cloud computing is a driver for 70% of CIOs, while software-defined data centers drive 34%. These figures are up from 52% and 14%, respectively, in the October 2015 survey. \nAmong the big beneficiaries of the cloud spending is Arista Networks ( ANET ), Nomura said. It expects Arista to maintain its rapid growth as it gains share in the hot data-center switching market. \nAnother beneficiary is fiber-optic company Ciena ( CIEN ). Ciena's optical technology \"targets the data-center interconnect market directly and, thus, ought to boost Ciena's mix of data-center revenue,\" Nomura said. \nOther beneficiaries are Infinera ( INFN ), Broadcom ( AVGO ) and Juniper Networks ( JNPR ). \nThe survey said CIOs now expect 65% of 2018 workloads to be in the cloud, up from 57% in its March survey. This compares with 48% of workloads in the cloud in 2016.",

      "text": "Jack Busch | November 10, 2016 in News \nAnd then there were two. Amazon’s voice-activated speaker/digital assistant has had a good unopposed run with the Amazon Echo and its little sister the Amazon Echo Dot . We here at groovyPost have bought a couple of these, and we like them a lot for home automation, streaming music, and more. But in a tech world dominated by Google, Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft, there are bound to be competitors. Google brings the first. \nGoogle Home is pretty much everything that the Amazon Echo is, except by Google. And it looks like an air freshener. Check out the video, if you haven’t already seen the ad a hundred times on Hulu. Google Home vs. Amazon Echo: What’s Different? \nOther than aesthetics (you can swap out the base on the Google Home for a different color), the biggest difference between the Home and Echo is that it’s Google, instead of Amazon. Google will have you saying “OK, Google” while Amazon Echo is powered by “Alexa.” Google obviously has the hulking power of its search capabilities baked in, and when you ask it to DJ for you, it taps into Google Music rather than Amazon Music. While the Amazon Echo’s sidekick is the smaller and cheaper Amazon Echo Dot, Google Music is helped out by the similar Google Chromecast. You can group together Google Home and Google Chromecast Audio devices for multi-room playback. \nThe other obvious difference: price . Google Home costs $129, and Amazon Echo starts at $179. Right now, you can snag a refurbished Amazon Echo for $119 —and it’s backed by the same limited warranty as a brand new Amazon Echo. Rumor has it that both Amazon Echo and Google Home will get up to $20 discounts on Black Friday/Cyber Monday in a few weeks. \nAlso, Amazon Echo is designed to help you buy stuff from Amazon (“Alexa, buy more beef jerky!”). That feature is lacking from Google Home. \nThe remaining differences are more minor. The list of supported third-party services are ever-growing for both devices, but Amazon Echo has had more time to pick up additional services. Both support Spotify, Pandora, and TuneIn. On the home automation front, both support Phillips Hue , SmartThings, Nest, and IFTTT, but Amazon Echo has a few more, including Wink, Belkin Wemo, and Lifx. Alexa also supports over 3,000 skills, which are like apps for the Amazon Echo. \nOn the personal assistant front, the two voice-activated speakers are very similar. They both let you check your calendar and ask random trivia. OK, Google gives you a daily briefing, just like with your Android phone. Amazon Echo can order you pizzas and send you an Uber. So, Should I Buy a Google Home? \nWondering if you should buy a Google Home device? I say…maybe. If you are more invested in the Google ecosystem — Android mobile, Chromecast, Nest, etc., it might make makes sense to go with Google. Right now, Google Home comes with a free 6-month subscription to YouTube Red. And, being that Google also owns Nest, \nBut… \nIf you already have Amazon Echo and Amazon Echo Dots all over your house, there’s no reason to switch brands or mix and match. These two devices are highly similar. \nAnd… \nIt’s only a matter of time before Apple releases its Siri-powered voice-activated speaker. Knowing Apple, their device will be 50% more expensive and tout some supposedly game-changing additional feature. No real word on when we might see that device, though. If you aren’t dying for a soothing robot presence in your house and you’ve already decked yourself out with an iPad, Macbook, Apple Watch, and iPhone, you may be happier biding your time. \nFor the majority of users, though, brand loyalty shouldn’t matter. Amazon Echo, Google Home, and Apple’s Echo competitor (TBD) will be handy and functional no matter what phone you have or which cloud-based multimedia services you prefer. \nConsidering buying an Amazon Echo, Google Home or something else? Already got one? Tell us about it in the comments. More Reading: About Jack Busch",

      "title": "New Book Summoned to Love Offers Voters Tangible Solutions To Their Problems",
      "text": "With a divisive and contentious election season upon us, Amazon #1 Christian author Barry Ferguson has released his new book, “Summoned To Love” which offers up tangible solutions to many of the problems plaguing today’s society.\nNeptune, United States – November 8, 2016 /PressCable/ —\nThe 2016 Presidential election has been one of the most divisive and contentious elections in history and like many people, Christian author Barry Ferguson is fed up with all the anger and hate being thrown around by the candidates. Unlike many voters though, Barry has decided to do something about it. He has written a new book entitled “Summoned To Love” which offers up tangible solutions to many of the problems plaguing today’s society.\nAsked why he is releasing his book at this time, Barry states, “There is so much hate, violence and anger everywhere you go that I can’t just sit around and watch my country go to hell. I decided to write a book that addressed the reasons why there is so much hate among people and what we can do to bring everyone closer together. I know this country is capable of so much more than what it has shown.”\nThe self-published book was written with the aim to make a positive difference in the way people treat one another and help bring individuals of all faiths, colors and nationalities together. Barry says, “I wanted to give people who have lost hope that peace, love and happiness are still available to everyone if they put their faith in God and take action. They need to know there are people who really care about them.”\n“Summoned To Love” sets its main focus on God’s unconditional love and how we can heal what ails our country. Mr. Ferguson hopes his book will inspire Americans to go to the polls with the idea of caring for one another without being hateful or judgemental. His book is based on three main points that he lives his life by:\n1- “If you cannot love you cannot live!”\n2-“Without hope you cannot cope.”\n3- With clarity of mind brings clarity of heart.”\nMr. Ferguson says that “Today is the turning point in our country and we either start caring about one another and stop being so selfish or we face a world where violence and hate are the norm.”\nBarry Ferguson is the author of over forty books and is an Amazon #1 Best-Selling Christian author, speaker, Transformational Life Coach, and teacher who has dedicated his life to helping individuals become the person they’ve also wanted to be.\nThe book is available through Amazon.com and on his website and those wishing to learn more about the book can visit here:\nhttp://BarryFergusonAuthor.com/books/summoned-to-love\n http://www.BarryFergusonAuthor.com\nContact Info:\nName: Barry Ferguson\nEmail: bmsj33@aol.com\nOrganization: OuttaSite Marketing LLC\nAddress: 8 Colleen Way\nPhone: (732) 533-3813\nRelease ID: 144426\n ",

      "text": "| Twitter \nNASHVILLE — The mini refrigerators at the Gulch's newest luxury hotel are stocked with pre-mixed cocktails thanks to a local birthday party that took place last year. \nThe party was for Joshua Ellis , a local entrepreneur and management consultant. His bartending friend Bradley Ryan wasn't able to attend, but wanted to make sure Ellis would have a good time. To do so, Ryan mixed large portions of three different types of cocktail, each without the alcohol. He then put the non-alcoholic cocktail mixes in pitchers and set the pitchers with the type of liquor that should be added. \nAt the party, guests mixed their own cocktails using the mixes, and the feedback Ellis got was phenomenal. \n\"I didn't pour one drink, yet all my guests were happy,\" Ellis said. \nEllis said he immediately knew he would have success selling the pre-mixed cocktails, so he teamed up with Ryan and launched what is now called WithCo. \nEllis expects his brand to quickly grow and spread across the country, revolutionizing homemade cocktails. WithCo cocktails, Ellis said, are better and easier than anything usually found in the country's homes. \n“We want you with your company, not back in the kitchen prepping,” Ellis said. \nIf Ellis is successful, he could bring more national attention to Nashville's growing alcohol scene, which has recently branched out from its traditional beer, wine and whiskey roots. \nGuests of The Thompson Nashville are currently the only people who can purchase the product, as Ellis and Ryan prepare to officially launch in February. But even after the product launches, people won't be able to purchase the product without subscribing to WithCo. Along with the ability to purchase bottles of the product online, subscriptions will come with a monthly bottle of the product shipped to subscribers' doors. Page 1",

      "text": "NES Classic Edition Now Available On Amazon, But Only In Limited Quantities By Ryan Grant ,   05:29 am IGN takes the covers off of the NES Classic Edition. Watch as we compare Nintendo's tiny console (and it's controllers) to the original system and other Wii accessories.(Photo : IGN/YouTube) \nMissing Super Mario Brothers, Donkey Kong, Pac Man, and other Nintendo computer games you played as a child in the late 80's and 90's? Well, the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) is back, and now is your best chance to buy the item. Amazon announced that the NES Classic Edition will be available online, but here's the catch: only while supplies last. Advertisement \nAmazon is selling \"limited\" quantities of the NES Classic Edition beginning today, November 11, at 2 p.m. Pacific Time. Only one unit will be available per customer, and pre-ordering is not allowed anywhere. \nEach unit costs $59.99. Expecting \"very high\" demand, the online retail giant said that it cannot guarantee to have enough supply of the NES Classic Edition for long, CNET reports. Amazon added, however, that it will receive more supplies in the coming weeks, and that announcements will be made when they become available again. It did not say exactly when. \nAccording to its listing on Amazon , the NES Classic Edition has the original look of the gadget, first released in 1985. But the 2016 edition is smaller and sleeker than the original. \nThe NES Classic Edition has 30 built-in games, including hits like Super Mario, Mega Man, The Legend of Zelda and Final Fantasy. The package comes with a standard HDMI cable, an old-school controller, and AC adapter. Additional controllers will be sold separately. \nNostalgic users will have several options to change the display mode so that the games would appear the way they did in the old days, according to Nintendo . The first is the CRT filter, which makes the display look like an old TV with scan lines. The second is the 4:3 display, which has the slight horizontal stretch of the original NES. Finally, it has the Pixel Perfect option, where pixels look like a perfect square, allowing users to see the games in precise detail as they were designed. \nNow that's perfect for a #ThrowbackThursday or #FlashbackFriday photo, wouldn't you agree?

As for Kindle deals, I found just one: The Envy of Eve by Melissa Kruger.\nWestminster Books has a deal on some excellent Christmas books . Yes, Christmas is coming!\nWhere Evangelicals Go From Here I appreciated Thomas Kidd’s reflections on Trump’s victory and some of the new challenges for Christians. (Also on the subject of the election, you may enjoy J.D. Vance’s Life Outside the Liberal Bubble .)\nHorrifying Book Curses Did you know that people used to attempt to protect their precious books with curses? “At the beginning or the end of books, scribes and book owners would write dramatic curses threatening thieves with pain and suffering if they were to steal or damage these treasures.”\nCharacteristics of Biblical Faith George Guthrie goes looking for some surprising characteristics of biblical faith.\nInitiating a Discipleship Relationship Here’s just a little practical wisdom on taking that first step in a discipleship relationship.\nThis Day in 1908. 108 years ago today Gideons International placed their first Bible in a room at the Superior Hotel in Montana. * \nThe Best Way to Deal with Hot Coffee This is kind of important if you’re a committed coffee drinker.\nTrue Leadership Is Sacrifice, Not Privilege David Mathis: “From before we can even remember, we have been indoctrinated, at nearly every turn, with the idea that being ‘a leader’ means getting the gold star. Leadership is a form of recognition, a kind of accomplishment, the path to privilege. Being declared a leader is like winning an award or being identified among the gifted.”\nIguana vs Snakes This is amazing footage from the next Planet Earth . (Also, a short behind-the-scenes here .)\nFlashback: She Is a Public Nuisance My neighbor is a public nuisance. It’s official, actually. She has been declared a nuisance which means the police are no longer obligated to respond to her phone calls. And she calls them a lot.\n\nThere is no greater delusion than the common idea that it is possible to live wickedly, and yet rise again gloriously . —J.C.

Using the methods she describes in this book, you can also achieve the same, if not completely surpass these results. \nThat's what study hacking is all about. This is the book for you if you find that you: \n- Are uncertain about what to do after you finish school - Know you have bad habits which are preventing you from succeeding - Struggle to be organised or to manage your time - Find that you get stressed out by upcoming exams, university applications or the thought of what to do once you finish school \nGoing well in school can be a tough process. Becoming a study hacker will make your success in this process as effortless and as easy as possible! \n“Study Hacker” by Despina Gavoyannis   5 days (11/07/2016 – 11/11/2016)   \n“Study Hacker” has a 5.0-  “This book is a great guide for getting success in your studies.

      "text": "NEW YORK , Nov. 10, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- MediaMall Technologies Inc. today announced the launch of its PlayOn Cloud service and iOS app, which will empower users to record their favorite movies and TV shows from popular streaming services including Netflix, Amazon Video, Hulu and HBO NOW to watch offline on an iPhone, iPad, PC or Mac. \nPlayOn Cloud is a first-of-its-kind cloud-based Streaming Video Recorder that allows users to initiate and download recordings directly to their mobile device. Think of it as a DVR for streaming video. PlayOn immediately creates the recording in the cloud and keeps it there for 30 days, allowing users to download the recording to their mobile device or computer to watch anytime, anywhere. And with PlayOn's AdSkip technology, users can watch recordings while automatically skipping over commercials. \n\"The PlayOn Cloud iOS app takes our revolutionary Streaming Video Recorder to the next level and untethers it from the PC,\" said Jeff Lawrence , president and CEO of PlayOn. \"We are now offering streamers something they've always wanted - a way to watch their favorite streaming programming on their mobile device when no internet is available. This is a game changer for commuters, travelers, users with mobile data caps and those who don't want to miss movies and TV shows when they expire from streaming services.\" \nAt launch, the PlayOn Cloud iOS app will allow users to record from Netflix, Amazon Video, Hulu, Yahoo! View, HBO NOW, YouTube, NBC, ABC, CBS, FOX, PBS and The CW. PlayOn Cloud users who have existing accounts with the paid streaming channels can record content from those services. Future updates will bring more streaming channels to the app. An Android app is in development.",

From July 1 to August 31, more than 1,400 authors from 39 countries entered the contest by uploading their titles to Amazon’s Kindle Direct Publishing (KDP) ( https://kdp.amazon.com ). The top countries participating were Spain, Mexico, Venezuela, the U.S. and Argentina, and the books were sold to customers in 71 different countries. To be eligible for the contest, the stories had to be original, unpublished works written in Spanish, and exclusive to Kindle through enrollment in KDP Select. After selecting five finalists, submissions were carefully reviewed by a panel of judges to determine the winning title. \nNingún Escocés Verdadero tells the story of Elías, a private investigator specializing in art-related crimes, who is hired by the Spanish Bishop of Murcia to search for the Cross of Caravaca, stolen in the year 1934. His mission is to restore it in time for an upcoming visit from the Pope. At the same time, Elías is tasked with acquiring a mysterious painting, which also goes missing soon after he purchases it in an auction in Madrid. From there, he meets an enigmatic and beautiful woman who will lead him down a dangerous path to the truth. \n“ Hope, excitement, restlessness, joy, anxiety and happiness. We have gone through all these emotions throughout the contest, since we submitted the novel until we learned we were the winners,” said authors Ana Ballabriga and David Zaplana. “We know where we came from and how hard it was to get here, so now the future seems like a wonderful place.” \n“For the third year in a row, we were amazed by the talent participating in the Indie Literary Prize for Spanish-language. It is great to be able to bring amazing characters such as the ones in the thriller Ningún Escocés Verdadero to a broader audience for Spanish readers and, in the future, to English readers as well,” said Charles Kronbach, Director, Kindle Direct Publishing. “This initiative is a great way to make new books available to our growing Spanish-speaking customers worldwide. The incredible engagement we see every year, both in terms of authors and readers, confirms that there are many more books out there that haven’t had a chance to be read and there are millions of readers eager to discover new stories.” \nContest ambassador and best-selling author Ismael Cala, said, “Winning a contest is not a matter of luck, but talent and perseverance. I congratulate the winning authors, the finalists, and all of the participants. Whatever the outcome, all of them have written a book and have made it available to others under the auspices of Amazon. The accomplishment is collective and our history is being added to day by day.” \nNingún Escocés Verdadero will be published globally in Spanish by Amazon Publishing, and translated into English and published globally by AmazonCrossing in digital, print and audio formats. Ana Ballabriga and David Zaplana are now part of the group of winners of Amazon’s Indie Literary Prize for Spanish-Language, which also includes Myriam Millán, winner of the prize in 2015 with her book La hija del Dragón ; and Jorge Magano, 2014 winner with his title La mirada de piedra .

      "text": "Blog This \n(NASDAQ:AMZN) —Amazon today announced that Ana Ballabriga and David Zaplana,with their title Ningún Escocés Verdadero —a thriller that involves religion, mystery, art and deception—have won the Third Indie Literary Prize for Spanish-language authors worldwide. From July 1 to August 31, more than 1,400 authors from 39 countries entered the contest by uploading their titles to Amazon’s Kindle Direct Publishing (KDP) ( https://kdp.amazon.com ). The top countries participating were Spain, Mexico, Venezuela, the U.S. and Argentina, and the books were sold to customers in 71 different countries. To be eligible for the contest, the stories had to be original, unpublished works written in Spanish, and exclusive to Kindle through enrollment in KDP Select. After selecting five finalists, submissions were carefully reviewed by a panel of judges to determine the winning title. \nNingún Escocés Verdadero tells the story of Elías, a private investigator specializing in art-related crimes, who is hired by the Spanish Bishop of Murcia to search for the Cross of Caravaca, stolen in the year 1934. His mission is to restore it in time for an upcoming visit from the Pope. At the same time, Elías is tasked with acquiring a mysterious painting, which also goes missing soon after he purchases it in an auction in Madrid. From there, he meets an enigmatic and beautiful woman who will lead him down a dangerous path to the truth. \n“ Hope, excitement, restlessness, joy, anxiety and happiness. We have gone through all these emotions throughout the contest, since we submitted the novel until we learned we were the winners,” said authors Ana Ballabriga and David Zaplana. “We know where we came from and how hard it was to get here, so now the future seems like a wonderful place.” \n“For the third year in a row, we were amazed by the talent participating in the Indie Literary Prize for Spanish-language. It is great to be able to bring amazing characters such as the ones in the thriller Ningún Escocés Verdadero to a broader audience for Spanish readers and, in the future, to English readers as well,” said Charles Kronbach, Director, Kindle Direct Publishing. “This initiative is a great way to make new books available to our growing Spanish-speaking customers worldwide. The incredible engagement we see every year, both in terms of authors and readers, confirms that there are many more books out there that haven’t had a chance to be read and there are millions of readers eager to discover new stories.” \nContest ambassador and best-selling author Ismael Cala, said, “Winning a contest is not a matter of luck, but talent and perseverance. I congratulate the winning authors, the finalists, and all of the participants. Whatever the outcome, all of them have written a book and have made it available to others under the auspices of Amazon. The accomplishment is collective and our history is being added to day by day.” \nNingún Escocés Verdadero will be published globally in Spanish by Amazon Publishing, and translated into English and published globally by AmazonCrossing in digital, print and audio formats. Ana Ballabriga and David Zaplana are now part of the group of winners of Amazon’s Indie Literary Prize for Spanish-Language, which also includes Myriam Millán, winner of the prize in 2015 with her book La hija del Dragón ; and Jorge Magano, 2014 winner with his title La mirada de piedra .

      "title": "Amazon Readies Three New Original Kids Holiday Specials for November 25 Premiere",
      "text": "Posted Wed Nov 9, 2016 at 12:00 PM PST by Steven Cohen \nThree new kids holiday specials are set to start streaming later this month. \nAmazon has announced its upcoming lineup of kids holiday themed specials. The new programs include 'If You Give a Mouse a Christmas Cookie,' 'The Snowy Day,' and 'An American Girl Story—Maryellen 1955: Extraordinary Christmas.' \n\"We are so excited to bring our customers our first-ever holiday line-up of specials this season, with If You Give a Mouse a Christmas Cookie and The Snowy Day based on beloved children's books that highlight strong bonds between friends and families. It's what the holidays are all about,\" said Tara Sorensen , Head of Kids Programming at Amazon Studios. \"The American Girl Maryellen special is an inspiring feel-good story that will surely become a holiday family favorite for our customers.\" \nHere's a full rundown of the lineup: \n' If You Give a Mouse a Christmas Cookie ' - If You Give a Mouse a Christmas Cookie is an animated holiday special based on the classic If You Give a Mouse a Cookie book series written by Laura Numeroff and illustrated by Felicia Bond. In this special, it’s holiday time and in Mouse’s house that means Christmas cookies (including a special one for Santa, of course), caroling with friends…and one nearly-destroyed holiday pageant. Can Mouse and his animal friends save the show, without getting utterly distracted along the way? It’s a wild ride as Mouse and his friends work together to solve a problem in a fun and creative way. The special is written and produced by Ken Scarborough (Doug, Curious George, Martha Speaks, Arthur,and Saturday Night Live); stars Mason Mahay (voice of Oliver), Roger Craig Smith (Avengers Assemble and Wreck-It Ralph), Jessica DiCiccio (Over the Hedge), Jeff Bennett (Futurama), and Lara Jill Miller (The Loud House, Henry Hugglemonster, and Doc McStuffins). The special also features an original song \"Christmas Cookie Song\" by Lisa Loeb, available exclusively on Amazon Music to download and stream November 25. If You Give a Mouse a Cookiewas part of Amazon's 2015 fall pilot season rated 4.7 stars by customers with 82% 5-star reviews; season one will premiere on Amazon Prime Video next year. \n' Ezra Jack Keats’ The Snowy Day ' - The Snowy Day is an animated holiday special based on the award-winning book by Ezra Jack Keats. The book is well-known as one of the first picture books to feature an African-American protagonist, has won many awards, including the Caldecott medal—one of the highest honors in children’s literature, and was included in the Library of Congress’ list of “Books that Shaped America.” The special follows Peter, a young boy in a red snowsuit, as his mother sends him on an adventure to Nana’s house to retrieve their traditional Christmas mac and cheese dinner. Enjoying the snowy day along the way, Peter encounters friends from the neighborhood, including storekeepers and bakers to the older boys he admires—and a group of a capella singers voiced by Boyz II Men. After arriving at Nana’s and retrieving the mac and cheese—and his most coveted gift, a brand-new red sled—Nana helps Peter team up with the older boys for an epic snowball fight, resulting in the destruction of the special holiday dinner and his sled. When the neighborhood comes together to celebrate new traditions with Peter and his family, Peter realizes that the true meaning of the holiday is who you spend it with. Narrated by Laurence Fishburne (Black-ish, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, and The Matrix) and featuring voice talent by Regina King (American Crime and The Leftovers), Jamie-Lynn Sigler (The Sopranos), and Angela Bassett (American Horror Story and BoJack Horseman), The Snowy Day features an original song “Snowy Day” by Boyz II Men, available exclusively on Amazon Music to download and stream November 25. Executive produced by Laurence Fishburne and Helen Sugland (Akeelah and the Bee) as well as Ann Austen, Irene Sherman, and Deborah Pope (Ezra Jack Keats Foundation). \n' An American Girl Story—Maryellen 1955: Extraordinary Christmas ' - An American Girl Story—Maryellen 1955: Extraordinary Christmas is the second collaboration between American Girl and Amazon and is based on American Girl’s previously launched BeForever character Maryellen Larkin. The special is set during Christmas in 1955 in Daytona Beach, Florida, where middle child Maryellen (Alyvia Alyn Lind) longs to stand out amidst the hustle and bustle of her big, busy family. A boisterous and artistic girl, Maryellen’s adventurous spirit is sometimes at odds with the era she’s living in: when conformity was valued above individuality. When Benji (Samuel Faraci), a family friend afflicted with polio comes to stay with them and visit Daytona Beach’s hospital for care, Maryellen is inspired to help the polio patients have the best Christmas ever. But her first attempts fall flat, followed by a fight with her best friend Davy (Maxwell Acee Donovan). With guidance and advice from Maryellen’s wise and sympathetic mother (Mary McCormack), Maryellen learns the key to helping others is through listening. Through her gift of drawing, Maryellen helps give the children an extraordinary Christmas they’ll never forget. Executive produced by Jane Startz (Ella Enchanted). An American Girl Story—Maryellen 1955: Extraordinary Christmas features an original song “Christmas and Everyday” by Best Coast, available exclusively on Amazon Music to download and stream November 25. A current Amazon Prime subscription costs $99 per year or $11 per month. Likewise, Prime Instant Video is available as a standalone service for $9 per month.",

      "text": " 36 AM EST Ultimate Kitchen Launches New Vertical Vacuum Sealer on Amazon \nUltimate Kitchen, maker of various kitchen products, announces the release of its new innovative kitchen solution, the Vertical Vacuum Sealer with Vacuum Sealer Rolls. The product will be sold exclusively on Amazon starting on October 1, 2016. Ultimate Kitchen is unveiling its new kitchen solution, the Vertical Vacuum Sealer with Vacuum Sealer Rolls, and it will be sold exclusively on Amazon, https://amzn.com/B01J6L8SZ2 , as with its previously launched home improvement and kitchen products. “We want to share our product exclusively on Amazon, with its long history of bridging buyers to sellers through secure, simple, and easy procedures,” Cassie Clark, the company’s Director for Operations explained. Ultimate Kitchen’s Vertical Vacuum Sealer is a state-of-the-art machine that uses powerful automatic vacuum technology to suction and seal food in one step. This feature slows down spoilage of by reducing atmospheric oxygen, thus limiting the growth of aerobic bacteria or fungi, and prevents the evaporation of unstable components. Further details of the new vacuum sealer are provided by Ultimate Kitchen in their introduction video, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVFUJKsMEvI . Clark said using the Vertical Vacuum Sealer is extremely economical as it extends the lifespan of perishable foodstuff 5 times longer than ordinary storage solutions such as Tupperware and aluminum foils. “With the Vertical Vacuum Sealer, foods maintain their texture and appearance longer. This is why shopkeepers can purchase food products in bulk to be divided and vacuum sealed into smaller servings. Batch cooked food can also be preserved this way,” says Clark. She said when storing vacuum sealed food products in the freezer, it can keep the food fresh for months because the sub-zero temperature slows down enzyme action that are taking place in the perishable food. Clark added the best advantage of vacuum sealed food when placed on the freezer is the absence of freezer burns. This vacuum sealer model primarily uses sealer rolls but it can also be connected to vacuum sealer accessories like the Ultimate Kitchen Vacuum Canister, for handheld vacuum sealing. Meanwhile its compact vertical design saves valuable kitchen space. It has a ‘gentle’ setting that switches the food sealer vacuum to a lower pressure to prevent delicate foods from being crushed. Moreover, Ultimate Kitchen's various food option settings allow the preservation of moist foods. It also comes with a removable liquid box unlike most vacuum sealers for food. Ultimate Kitchen's new line of vacuum sealers and accessories are available on Amazon, at https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01J6L8SZ2/ref=cm_sw_r_tw_dp_x_DxoTxbYNTNACD . About Ultimate Kitchen Ultimate Kitchen is a successful division of QRscanit, Inc., located in Coeur d’Alene, ID. Ultimate Kitchen will be expanding its line of kitchen products throughout the year 2016 with updates on the brand's website: http://ultimate-kitchen.com/ .

      "text": "(Picture: Amazon/Getty) The internet have been left weeping after an Amazon review was posted to Tumblr. \nA 70-year-old man had left an incredibly positive 5-star Amazon review on a pair of rainbow suspenders that he had worn to Gay Pride.\nThe 2011 Gay Pride was to be his 46th Gay Pride March and he wanted to make an entrance with a bold choice of clothing.\nHe decided to purchase the rainbow suspenders to pair with a white shirt and a purple Brooks Brothers shirt.\nHe wrote: ‘I could not ask for a better made pair. It seems every time I need something, Amazon finds it for me and makes it easy to purchase. How very wonderful.’\nhttp://fangirlingoverdemigods.tumblr.com/post/152479592916/this-is-honestly-just-so-pure \nTumblr user fangirlingoverdemigods came across the review and couldn’t help but feel incredibly touched by it. She posted it online alongside the caption: ‘This is honestly just so pure’.\nShe told BuzzFeed : ‘I came across the review after my girlfriend showed it to me. We both thought it was super adorable. It made my day and I thought it could make other peoples’ days too.’\nThe review went on to be re-blogged by over 30,000 other people, all of whom felt equally moved by the post.\nPeople have found out what dogs dream about and they’re all crying One user wrote: ‘I’ll bet they looked just magnificent in that outfit too. Truly, how very wonderful.’\nAnother said: ‘This made me really happy from start to finish. Just a nice little review. Ah. Just makes your heart smile.’\nWe don’t know about you, but this review certainly made us smile – and we just can’t imagine this man ever leaving a bad review on anything.\nIt’s just so comforting to know there’s people like this in the world.\nMORE: The internet is loving this special needs teacher who wears a chicken suit when her class hand their homework in on time \nMORE: Mum closes off living room until Thanksgiving with hilarious set of rules ",

      "text": "share Samit Sarkar/Polygon Nintendo’s adorable NES Classic will finally go on sale tomorrow and, according to an email from Amazon , those interested in picking one up should be online at 2 p.m. PT, but it’s likely a good idea to get there a bit early. Instead of allowing customers to pre-order the system, Amazon is choosing to email people who have indicated their interest in purchasing the micro console with a series of helpful tips to nab one. Amazon has said that there will be very limited quantities of the NES Classic available and, because of that, is limiting orders to one per customer. The online retailer also confirmed that it was disabling one-click purchasing and reminded customers to make sure their credit card info was up-to-date. “Demand is expected to be very high, and there's no guarantee that it will remain in stock for long,” the email reads. “We will make similar announcements when additional inventory becomes available.” Amazon said that it has plans to replenish its stocks over the next couple of weeks, but couldn’t give an exact date for when it would receive more. Other retailers, like GameStop and Best Buy aren’t offering pre-orders on the Classic. Target made pre-orders available for a brief moment in August, but has since stopped. The miniature console, which was announced back in July , comes pre-loaded with 30 of Nintendo’s classic titles, including Super Mario Bros. , The Legend of Zelda , Metroid , Donkey Kong , and Kirby's Adventure. It also comes with one retro-style controller, but Nintendo will be selling additional controllers for the system at $9.99.

      "text": "Recode ^ | Nov 9, 2016 | Jason Del \nPosted on 11/10/2016 6:13:23 AM PST by TigerLikesRooster \nDonald Trump said Amazon and Jeff Bezos have a huge antitrust problem. Now they may. \nThe president-elect is certainly one to hold grudges. \nby Jason Del Rey@DelRey Nov 9, 2016, 12:10pm EST \nLets state the obvious: Donald Trump and Amazon CEO, and Washington Post owner, Jeff Bezos do not see eye to eye. And that becomes a more concerning prospect for Bezos and Amazon now that Trump is president-elect. \nIn May, after learning of the large team of Washington Post reporters looking into his past, Trump told conservative TV commentator Sean Hannity that Bezos was using the paper to damage Trumps chances because he feared what a President Trump would mean for Amazon. \n\"He thinks I'll go after him for antitrust,\" Trump said at the time. \"Because he's got a huge antitrust problem because he's controlling so much, Amazon is controlling so much of what they are doing. \n\"He's using the Washington Post, which is peanuts, he's using that for political purposes to save Amazon in terms of taxes and in terms of antitrust.\" \nTrumps campaign later reiterated this narrative in a statement claiming that the Post was being used as political leverage so Amazon doesnt get sued for monopolistic tendencies that have led to the destruction of department stores and the retail industry. (Excerpt) Read more at recode.net ...

FR is funded solely by the patriots who love and use it. If you have not yet made your donation, today would be an excellent day to do so ! Thank you very much, Jim Robinson \nOr by mail to: Free Republic, LLC - PO Box 9771 - Fresno, CA 93794 To me, this election ended with the best possible results. Hillary campaign managed to string along all establishment players, making them go to extreme lengths to prop her up. In the process, we saw the stark display of the blatant corruption and collusion among big corporations, media, politicians, and sinister foreign powers (such as Saudi Arabia.) Those who need to keep some discrete distance are all in it together. Jeff Bezos was eager to play a shameless and brazen propagandist. Google and Facebook are shown to be closely linked up with Hillary campaign. Eric Schmidt and Sheryl Sandberg were in direct contact with Hillary campaign. It was more than giving huge sum of campaign donation. \nCNN and WaPo basically went for broke. We all knew they were in the tank with liberals, but they all exceeded our wildest expectation. They can no longer walk back from what they did. There is no room for spin. The same goes with all pollsters, except a few. So are all GOPe politicians. We suspected all along that they were no good. But I am glad that they left us no doubt with their actions, showing clearly where they stand. What we have always suspected is vindicated ten times over. What is better is that we can now convince lots of others who were not sure. \nI am sure many would rather wanted a huge landslide in terms of popular votes, but it is indeed the landslide considering all forces arrayed against Trump. All ruling class elites and oligarchs overextended themselves to shore up damaged good like Hillary. Had they cut their losses early, we have not been able to see clear public display of their extensive corruption and abuse of power. Good to see that it all blew up in their face and the whole thing went down like Titanic. \nHillary forced them to hitch their fortune with her, and managed to sink all of them along with her. For that, I am grateful. 1 posted on 11/10/2016 6:13:23 AM PST by TigerLikesRooster",
