Chief Executive Mark Fields warned President-elect Donald Trump's proposal that placing high tariffs on automobiles and other products coming from outside the U.S. would have negative consequences for the auto industry and beyond.\nA steep tariff \"would be imposed on the entire auto sector and that could have a huge impact on the U.S. economy,\" Mr. Fields told reporters on Tuesday on the sidelines of the Automobility LA car show. \"I continue to be convinced that the right policies will prevail because I think we all share the same objective which is a healthy and vibrant U.S. economy.\"\nMr. Fields said the company will stick with plans to assemble cars in Mexico, which Mr. Trump has singled out as a serious problem for American workers. The executive said Ford has been in touch with Mr. Trump's transition team as the president-elect prepares to take office in January.\n\"We have conversations with the transition team,\" Mr. Fields said. \"I've sent a congratulatory letter to the president-elect and we look forward to working with the new administration.\"\nIt was Mr. Fields first public appearance since Mr. Trump was elected to the White House after a campaign that often had Ford in its crosshairs for manufacturing its products outside the U.S.\nCriticism of Ford reflected a wider concern that the U.S. is losing well-paying manufacturing jobs to countries such as Mexico and China. Mr. Trump has said he would renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement that came into force in 1994 and has been widely criticized as encouraging the offshoring of U.S. jobs.\nMr. Trump has also vowed to impose steep tariffs on Ford if the Dearborn, Mich., auto maker carries out its plan to move assembly of its Focus compact car to Mexico from Wayne, Mich. The company has said the move won't result in American job losses.\nMr. Fields reiterated Ford plans to move forward with its Mexico plans that he said will make room for two new products at the U.S. factory.\nOn Monday night, at a party on Hollywood Boulevard near the Dolby Theatre, Ford unveiled the EcoSport SUV it plans to bring to the U.S. market in 2018. The model will be built in a factory in India that already makes the vehicle for other countries.\nWrite to Tim Higgins at Tim.Higgins@WSJ.com\n 13:45 ET (18:45 ",

      "text": "By Tim Higgins\nLOS ANGELES -- Ford Motor Co. Chief Executive Mark Fields issued a warning about President-elect Donald Trump's proposed trade policies, saying high tariffs on automobiles and other products coming into the U.S. would be a blow to the auto industry and broader U.S. economy.\nMr. Fields, speaking with reporters on the sidelines of the Los Angeles Auto Show on Tuesday, said Ford has talked to Mr. Trump's transition team and believes the company can work with the new administration. During a separate interview, he said, \"We all share the same objective; we want a vibrant and healthy U.S. economy.\"\nThe two sides, however, appear to be at odds on how to achieve that goal.\nFord's plan to move a substantial portion of its passenger-car production to Mexico from a factory in Michigan was heavily criticized by Mr. Trump on the campaign trail. Like many of its rivals, Ford is building more-profitable light trucks in the U.S. while investing in new capacity in Mexico to produce lower-margin small cars.\nFord is also looking to better use the rest of its global footprint. On Monday, the company unveiled a small sport utility called the EcoSport. It fills a hole in the company's U.S. market, but the company will import the vehicle from India.\nWhile Ford has argued that no jobs will be lost because of the Mexico move and that lower costs there would boost profitability, Mr. Trump has proposed a 35% tariff as penalty for such a move.\nMr. Fields said the tariff \"would be harmful, I think, to the entire industry and the economy and therefore we want to engage in a very productive set of discussions.\" He noted the North American Free Trade Agreement has increased the interwoven connections shared by auto industries in the U.S., Canada and Mexico.\nMr. Trump has said he would renegotiate Nafta, which came into force in the 1990s and has been blamed for substantial U.S. job loss.\n\"The facts are when we look at something like Nafta, production and supply chains are deeply integrated across the three countries,\" Mr. Fields said. \"A lot of that integration supports U.S. jobs and we want to make sure we're looking at those facts.\"\nThe executive rattled off a list of items important to auto makers that need to be shared with incoming government leaders. He said auto companies need fuel-economy standards that are realistic, a regulatory framework for the safe deployment of autonomous vehicles and stronger stances on currency manipulation.\nFuel-economy regulations are a key concern because low gasoline prices are boosting demand for light trucks, which typically have poorer fuel-economy performance. Mr. Fields pointed to a review of regulations coming in 2017 as an important moment for the auto industry's relationship with Washington.\nAs for the Nafta disagreement between Ford and Mr. Trump, Mr. Fields said the company will stick with plans to assemble cars in Mexico, but it will continue to discuss the situation with the incoming administration.\n\"We have conversations with the transition team,\" Mr. Fields said. \"I've sent a congratulatory letter to the president-elect and we look forward to working with the new administration.\"\nIt was Mr. Fields's first public appearance since Mr. Trump was elected to the White House last week.\nMr. Fields reiterated Ford's plans to make room for two new products at the Wayne, Mich., facility that currently makes the cars that are being relocated to Mexico.\nWrite to Tim Higgins at Tim.Higgins@WSJ.com\n 17:38 ET (22:38 ",

      "text": "By Tim Higgins\nFord Motor Co. Chief Executive Mark Fields warned President-elect Donald Trump's proposal that placing high tariffs on automobiles and other products coming from outside the U.S. would have negative consequences for the auto industry and beyond.\nA steep tariff \"would be imposed on the entire auto sector and that could have a huge impact on the U.S. economy,\" Mr. Fields told reporters on Tuesday on the sidelines of the Automobility LA car show. \"I continue to be convinced that the right policies will prevail because I think we all share the same objective which is a healthy and vibrant U.S. economy.\"\nMr. Fields said the company will stick with plans to assemble cars in Mexico, which Mr. Trump has singled out as a serious problem for American workers. The executive said Ford has been in touch with Mr. Trump's transition team as the president-elect prepares to take office in January.\n\"We have conversations with the transition team,\" Mr. Fields said. \"I've sent a congratulatory letter to the president-elect and we look forward to working with the new administration.\"\nIt was Mr. Fields first public appearance since Mr. Trump was elected to the White House after a campaign that often had Ford in its crosshairs for manufacturing its products outside the U.S.\nCriticism of Ford reflected a wider concern that the U.S. is losing well-paying manufacturing jobs to countries such as Mexico and China. Mr. Trump has said he would renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement that came into force in 1994 and has been widely criticized as encouraging the offshoring of U.S. jobs.\nMr. Trump has also vowed to impose steep tariffs on Ford if the Dearborn, Mich., auto maker carries out its plan to move assembly of its Focus compact car to Mexico from Wayne, Mich. The company has said the move won't result in American job losses.\nMr. Fields reiterated Ford plans to move forward with its Mexico plans that he said will make room for two new products at the U.S. factory.\nOn Monday night, at a party on Hollywood Boulevard near the Dolby Theatre, Ford unveiled the EcoSport SUV it plans to bring to the U.S. market in 2018. The model will be built in a factory in India that already makes the vehicle for other countries.\nWrite to Tim Higgins at Tim.Higgins@WSJ.com\n 13:39 ET (18:39 ",

      "text": "Ford CEO says production plans on track despite election Posted:   Full Story \nDETROIT (AP) - Ford Motor Co. CEO Mark Fields says the presidential election won't change the company's plans to move small car production to Mexico. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump has repeatedly criticized Ford for moving production to Mexico. Trump wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and has called for a 35-percent tariff on goods shipped from Mexico. \nIn an interview with CNBC Tuesday, Fields said Ford is proceeding with its plan to move Focus car production from Michigan to a new plant in Mexico by 2018. He stressed that no jobs will be lost, since the Michigan plant will make two other vehicles. \nFields also warned that a tariff would affect the entire industry - and autoworkers' profit-sharing checks - since many companies sell Mexican- and Canadian-made vehicles or parts.

      "text": "By Tim Higgins\nLOS ANGELES -- Ford Motor Co. Chief Executive Mark Fields issued a warning about President-elect Donald Trump's proposed trade policies, saying high tariffs on automobiles and other products coming into the U.S. would be a blow to the auto industry and broader U.S. economy.\nMr. Fields, speaking with reporters on the sidelines of the Los Angeles Auto Show on Tuesday, said Ford has talked to Mr. Trump's transition team and believes the company can work with the new administration. During a separate interview, he said, \"We all share the same objective; we want a vibrant and healthy U.S. economy.\"\nThe two sides, however, appear to be at odds on how to achieve that goal.\nFord's plan to move a substantial portion of its passenger-car production to Mexico from a factory in Michigan was heavily criticized by Mr. Trump on the campaign trail. Like many of its rivals, Ford is building more-profitable light trucks in the U.S. while investing in new capacity in Mexico to produce lower-margin small cars.\nFord is also looking to better use the rest of its global footprint. On Monday, the company unveiled a small sport utility called the EcoSport. It fills a hole in the company's U.S. market, but the company will import the vehicle from India.\nWhile Ford has argued that no jobs will be lost because of the Mexico move and that lower costs there would boost profitability, Mr. Trump has proposed a 35% tariff as penalty for such a move.\nMr. Fields said the tariff \"would be harmful, I think, to the entire industry and the economy and therefore we want to engage in a very productive set of discussions.\" He noted the North American Free Trade Agreement has increased the interwoven connections shared by auto industries in the U.S., Canada and Mexico.\nMr. Trump has said he would renegotiate Nafta, which came into force in the 1990s and has been blamed for substantial U.S. job loss.\n\"The facts are when we look at something like Nafta, production and supply chains are deeply integrated across the three countries,\" Mr. Fields said. \"A lot of that integration supports U.S. jobs and we want to make sure we're looking at those facts.\"\nThe executive rattled off a list of items important to auto makers that need to be shared with incoming government leaders. He said auto companies need fuel-economy standards that are realistic, a regulatory framework for the safe deployment of autonomous vehicles and stronger stances on currency manipulation.\nFuel-economy regulations are a key concern because low gasoline prices are boosting demand for light trucks, which typically have poorer fuel-economy performance. Mr. Fields pointed to a review of regulations coming in 2017 as an important moment for the auto industry's relationship with Washington.\nAs for the Nafta disagreement between Ford and Mr. Trump, Mr. Fields said the company will stick with plans to assemble cars in Mexico, but it will continue to discuss the situation with the incoming administration.\n\"We have conversations with the transition team,\" Mr. Fields said. \"I've sent a congratulatory letter to the president-elect and we look forward to working with the new administration.\"\nIt was Mr. Fields's first public appearance since Mr. Trump was elected to the White House last week.\nMr. Fields reiterated Ford's plans to make room for two new products at the Wayne, Mich., facility that currently makes the cars that are being relocated to Mexico.\nWrite to Tim Higgins at Tim.Higgins@WSJ.com\n 17:38 ET (22:38 GMT)\n ",

      "text": "Ford Motor Co. Chief Executive Mark Fields warned President-elect Donald Trump's proposal that placing high tariffs on automobiles and other products coming from outside the U.S. would have negative consequences for the auto industry and beyond.\nA steep tariff \"would be imposed on the entire auto sector and that could have a huge impact on the U.S. economy,\" Mr. Fields told reporters on Tuesday on the sidelines of the Automobility LA car show. \"I continue to be convinced that the right policies will prevail because I think we all share the same objective which is a healthy and vibrant U.S. economy.\"\nMr. Fields said the company will stick with plans to assemble cars in Mexico, which Mr. Trump has singled out as a serious problem for American workers. The executive said Ford has been in touch with Mr. Trump's transition team as the president-elect prepares to take office in January.\n\"We have conversations with the transition team,\" Mr. Fields said. \"I've sent a congratulatory letter to the president-elect and we look forward to working with the new administration.\"\nIt was Mr. Fields first public appearance since Mr. Trump was elected to the White House after a campaign that often had Ford in its crosshairs for manufacturing its products outside the U.S.\nCriticism of Ford reflected a wider concern that the U.S. is losing well-paying manufacturing jobs to countries such as Mexico and China. Mr. Trump has said he would renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement that came into force in 1994 and has been widely criticized as encouraging the offshoring of U.S. jobs.\nMr. Trump has also vowed to impose steep tariffs on Ford if the Dearborn, Mich., auto maker carries out its plan to move assembly of its Focus compact car to Mexico from Wayne, Mich. The company has said the move won't result in American job losses.\nMr. Fields reiterated Ford plans to move forward with its Mexico plans that he said will make room for two new products at the U.S. factory.\nOn Monday night, at a party on Hollywood Boulevard near the Dolby Theatre, Ford unveiled the EcoSport SUV it plans to bring to the U.S. market in 2018. The model will be built in a factory in India that already makes the vehicle for other countries.\nWrite to Tim Higgins at Tim.Higgins@WSJ.com\n 15, 2016 13:45 ET (18:45 ",

      "title": "Ford CEO Wary of Trump's Talk About Tariffs and Nafta",
      "text": "By Tim Higgins\nLOS ANGELES -- Ford Motor Co. Chief Executive Mark Fields issued a warning about President-elect Donald Trump's proposed trade policies, saying high tariffs on automobiles and other products coming into the U.S. would be a blow to the auto industry and broader U.S. economy.\nMr. Fields, speaking with reporters on the sidelines of the Los Angeles Auto Show on Tuesday, said Ford has talked to Mr. Trump's transition team and believes the company can work with the new administration. During a separate interview, he said, \"We all share the same objective; we want a vibrant and healthy U.S. economy.\"\nThe two sides, however, appear to be at odds on how to achieve that goal.\nFord's plan to move a substantial portion of its passenger-car production to Mexico from a factory in Michigan was heavily criticized by Mr. Trump on the campaign trail. Like many of its rivals, Ford is building more-profitable light trucks in the U.S. while investing in new capacity in Mexico to produce lower-margin small cars.\nFord is also looking to better use the rest of its global footprint. On Monday, the company unveiled a small sport utility called the EcoSport. It fills a hole in the company's U.S. market, but the company will import the vehicle from India.\nWhile Ford has argued that no jobs will be lost because of the Mexico move and that lower costs there would boost profitability, Mr. Trump has proposed a 35% tariff as penalty for such a move.\nMr. Fields said the tariff \"would be harmful, I think, to the entire industry and the economy and therefore we want to engage in a very productive set of discussions.\" He noted the North American Free Trade Agreement has increased the interwoven connections shared by auto industries in the U.S., Canada and Mexico.\nMr. Trump has said he would renegotiate Nafta, which came into force in the 1990s and has been blamed for substantial U.S. job loss.\n\"The facts are when we look at something like Nafta, production and supply chains are deeply integrated across the three countries,\" Mr. Fields said. \"A lot of that integration supports U.S. jobs and we want to make sure we're looking at those facts.\"\nThe executive rattled off a list of items important to auto makers that need to be shared with incoming government leaders. He said auto companies need fuel-economy standards that are realistic, a regulatory framework for the safe deployment of autonomous vehicles and stronger stances on currency manipulation.\nFuel-economy regulations are a key concern because low gasoline prices are boosting demand for light trucks, which typically have poorer fuel-economy performance. Mr. Fields pointed to a review of regulations coming in 2017 as an important moment for the auto industry's relationship with Washington.\nAs for the Nafta disagreement between Ford and Mr. Trump, Mr. Fields said the company will stick with plans to assemble cars in Mexico, but it will continue to discuss the situation with the incoming administration.\n\"We have conversations with the transition team,\" Mr. Fields said. \"I've sent a congratulatory letter to the president-elect and we look forward to working with the new administration.\"\nIt was Mr. Fields's first public appearance since Mr. Trump was elected to the White House last week.\nMr. Fields reiterated Ford's plans to make room for two new products at the Wayne, Mich., facility that currently makes the cars that are being relocated to Mexico.\nWrite to Tim Higgins at Tim.Higgins@WSJ.com\n 15, 2016 17:38 ET (22:38 ",

No tax, no nothing, and we'll have nothing but more unemployment in Flint and in Michigan,\" he said in the speech in Flint. \n\nFord announced its plan in mid-September.\nOn Tuesday, Fields said the automaker will continue to focus on Mexico despite Trump's threats to impose tariffs on all vehicles built there and brought to the United States.\nSuch a tariff could impact the entire auto sector and economy, a risk the Republican administration would not want to take, Fields said.\nThere will be no change to the number of jobs Ford creates within the U.S. despite the company's push to expand its \"global manufacturing footprint,\" Fields said.\nAs for Trump's view on the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico, Fields said the company's strategy is laid out according to the international trade agreements the United States holds, and that most of its investments are in this country.\nTrump has called NAFTA \"the single worst trade deal ever approved in this country.\"\n\"Both the production and the supply chains are deeply integrated between the three countries, and that integration also supports a lot of American jobs,\" Fields said.\nFord reported a decline in October's U.S. sales of 11.7 percent earlier this month, lower than analysts' predictions of 10.9 percent.",

      "text": "By Tim Higgins\nFord Motor Co. Chief Executive Mark Fields warned President-elect Donald Trump's proposal that placing high tariffs on automobiles and other products coming from outside the U.S. would have negative consequences for the auto industry and beyond.\nA steep tariff \"would be imposed on the entire auto sector and that could have a huge impact on the U.S. economy,\" Mr. Fields told reporters on Tuesday on the sidelines of the Automobility LA car show. \"I continue to be convinced that the right policies will prevail because I think we all share the same objective which is a healthy and vibrant U.S. economy.\"\nMr. Fields said the company will stick with plans to assemble cars in Mexico, which Mr. Trump has singled out as a serious problem for American workers. The executive said Ford has been in touch with Mr. Trump's transition team as the president-elect prepares to take office in January.\n\"We have conversations with the transition team,\" Mr. Fields said. \"I've sent a congratulatory letter to the president-elect and we look forward to working with the new administration.\"\nIt was Mr. Fields first public appearance since Mr. Trump was elected to the White House after a campaign that often had Ford in its crosshairs for manufacturing its products outside the U.S.\nCriticism of Ford reflected a wider concern that the U.S. is losing well-paying manufacturing jobs to countries such as Mexico and China. Mr. Trump has said he would renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement that came into force in 1994 and has been widely criticized as encouraging the offshoring of U.S. jobs.\nMr. Trump has also vowed to impose steep tariffs on Ford if the Dearborn, Mich., auto maker carries out its plan to move assembly of its Focus compact car to Mexico from Wayne, Mich. The company has said the move won't result in American job losses.\nMr. Fields reiterated Ford plans to move forward with its Mexico plans that he said will make room for two new products at the U.S. factory.\nOn Monday night, at a party on Hollywood Boulevard near the Dolby Theatre, Ford unveiled the EcoSport SUV it plans to bring to the U.S. market in 2018. The model will be built in a factory in India that already makes the vehicle for other countries.\nWrite to Tim Higgins at Tim.Higgins@WSJ.com\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\nNovember 15, 2016 13:39 ET (18:39 ",

      "text": "Hello fellow Ford owners.\nI recently bought a 2014 Focus se\nAutomatic.\nI had noticed the jerking and hesitation many people talk about. However on Sunday when I got out of work about 1 minute into my drive home I received a message saying TRANSMISSION FAULT SERVICE NOW. I parked the car, shut if off on again and light came on again. I needed to get home so I drove it easy about 7 miles or so. Before I reached home it started to jerk really hard, rpms getting high but car did not want to go anywhere. I parked it put it in reverse and it did not go backwards it was as if it was in neutral.\n\nDodge (dealer which I bought the car from) told me they ran the car and all was working fine. This was the morning after. No codes or anything. They did however send it to the nearby Ford dealership to check it out more. One day later they call me saying Ford only found a code. It needed an update to the computer for the transmission control module. I will pick up the car tomorrow. Has anyone ever experienced anything like this? I do not want to keep a car that will keep giving me trouble. I bought it a month and a half ago with 40k miles. \n\nThoughts or comments would be appreciated \nThank you!! ",

CEO Mark Fields says the presidential election won't change the company's plans to move small car production to Mexico. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump has repeatedly criticized Ford for moving production to Mexico. Trump wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and has called for a 35-percent tariff on goods shipped from Mexico. \nIn an interview with CNBC Tuesday, Fields said Ford is proceeding with its plan to move Focus car production from Michigan to a new plant in Mexico by 2018. He stressed that no jobs will be lost, since the Michigan plant will make two other vehicles. \nFields also warned that a tariff would affect the entire industry - and autoworkers' profit-sharing checks - since many companies sell Mexican- and Canadian-made vehicles or parts.

      "text": "© 2016 Time Inc. All rights reserved. Ford Is Moving Small Car Production to Mexico Despite Donald Trump’s Tariff Threats \nFord Motor f is moving ahead with plans to shift production of small car s to Mexico from Michigan, while “two very important products” will be built in its U.S. factories, Chief Executive Officer Mark Fields told Reuters on Tuesday. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump has criticized Ford for the decision to shift production of Focus small car s to Mexico in 2018, and said he would consider levying tariffs on Mexican-made Ford s. Trump has also said he wants to scrap the North American Free Trade agreement, which also includes Canada, and to build a wall on the U.S.- Mexico border to stop undocumented immigrants. \n“We’re going forward with our plan to move production of the Ford Focus to Mexico , and importantly that’s to make room for two very important products we’ll be putting back into Michigan plants,” Fields said in an interview on the sidelines of the Los Angeles Auto Show. “There will be no job impact whatsoever with this move.” \nFord Chairman Bill Ford Jr. said last month he met with Trump. Ford has countered Trump’s criticism, saying the company, founded by his great-grandfather, makes more car s and trucks in the United States than any other automaker. \nFields said with U.S. gasoline prices so low, “it’s very difficult for us to be able to make money on a vehicle produced in the U.S.” in the small car segment. If Ford decided to build the Focus small car line in the United States, and had to raise the price, “we wouldn’t sell the vehicle.” \nThe group that represents Ford and other major automakers in the U.S. has asked the Trump transition team to review and consider easing the Obama administration’s fuel economy standards, which call for automakers to more than double the fuel efficiency of their fleets to 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025. \nFuel economy and trade “are two separate issues,” Fields said. \nFord also is moving ahead with plans to use factory capacity in other markets to fill gaps in its U.S. lineup. Company executives used the auto show to promote a small sport utility vehicle called the EcoSport that the company plans to ship from India. \n“We already have the plants and investment in other parts of the world. It frees us up to make further investments in the U.S.,” Fields said, pointing to the money invested to launch a new SuperDuty pickup at a plant in Kentucky. For more information on Ford, watch Fortune’s video: \nFord has cautioned investors that it sees demand for car s and light trucks hitting a plateau in the United States. Fields said heading into the last two months of the year “we are seeing a tougher pricing environment.” \n“We expect the industry to be about the same as it was last year, probably a little lower on the retail side, and a continuing competitive pricing environment,” Fields said.",

      "text": "It was hard to miss the message behind Ford Motor Co.’s pop-up event in Hollywood on Monday night. The tiny homes, vignette of Venice Beach, signs emblazoned with social media messages, and food stand hosted by the trendy Smorgasburg flea market were all code for “Hey, millennials, this is for you.” And that’s the market--at least one of them--that Ford hopes its new EcoSport subcompact crossover will attract.\nFord’s SUV group marketing manager, Michael O’Brien, said Monday the company is also targeting women and empty nester baby boomers with the EcoSport. The idea, as its Go Small, Live Big tagline suggests, is to introduce a vehicle desirable to mobile, connected consumers who want to experience things, not collect them.\nFord, with the help of rap artist DJ Khaled, introduced its EcoSport to the North American market Monday night at the event and on Snapchat. Ford says it’s the first vehicle to be revealed on Snapchat.\nFord introduced the subcompact crossover ahead of AutoMobility LA, the new industry trade show that combines the automotive press days for the LA Auto Show and its related (and former) Connected Car Expo. AutoMobility LA, which officially kicked off Monday night, gets down to business Tuesday morning with a keynote from Ford CEO Mark Fields.\nThe EcoSport was introduced in 2003, but it’s never been available in the U.S. or Canada. It was originally built and sold in Brazil. It’s also sold in Argentina, Asia, and Europe.\nThe new EcoSport will come in four trim level offerings, including the S, SE, SES, and Titanium. Customers will be able to pick from 10 exterior color choices and seven ambient lighting options. The Titanium trim, pictured below, features more chrome details, and comes standard with a B&O PLAY audio system and 10 speakers. The SES is designed to look more rugged.\nThe vehicle will be offered in two different powertrains: a 1.0-liter ecoboost engine that is 2-wheel drive and a 2.0-liter engine with a 4-wheel drive. The latter is the same system on the Ford Escape SUV.\nThe inside features an 8-inch floating touchscreen with enhanced voice recognition. The vehicle will be equipped with its Sync 3 infotainment platform that will include CarPlay or Android Auto, two rival software services that let the driver or passengers bring the functions of their smartphone into the vehicle's central screen. This is in line with Ford’s previous announcement in July that all of its 2017 model-year cars, trucks, and SUVS will come with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.\nOther notable items include the EcoSport aiming to make more room, even though it’s a subcompact. The back storage area is accessed via a swing gate. The handle for the swing gate, which is incorporated into the taillight pictured below, is one of the cooler design details.\nThere are easy places for passenger to stash their smartphones, with a cooled glovebox and dual pockets behind the front seats. There’s even a small shirt-sized pocket on the side of the passenger seat that a driver could easily access.\nThe vehicle also has two fast-charging USB ports and a standard 12-volt power outlet.\nFord says the new EcoSport will start arriving in dealerships in early 2018.\nSee original article on Fortune.com\nMore from Fortune.com\nNike's Self-Lacing Sneakers Won't Actually Cost $1,000 A Pair How Booming Mobile Video is Pushing Carriers to Lower Quality China Threatens to Cut iPhone Sales Over Trump Rhetoric Here's How Many Electric Cars BMW Aims to Sell Next Year Samsung Just Paid $8 Billion to Get Into the Automotive Business",

      "text": "Ford's compact SUV for younger drivers has driven into the record books as the first car ever to launch via the Snapchat social network\nOne day, two automotive world firsts. Hot on the heels of Jaguar reaching for a HTC Vive headset and Virtual Reality to launch a new model, Ford has grabbed its smartphone for what it says is the world's first new car reveal via Snapchat.\nAnd in both cases, the launch medium is completely apt. The new Jaguar concept car is all about the technology and possibilities of tomorrow, whereas Ford's new EcoSport is all about fun, hassle-free driving, individuality and the possibilities for adventure. In other words those that Ford describe as \"going small and living big.\"\n\"More people are choosing to spend their time and money sharing experiences with friends and family instead of buying more stuff,\" said Chantel Lenard, ‎executive director, Ford US marketing. \"EcoSport fits perfectly into this growing lifestyle.\"\nTherefore it shouldn't come as a surprise that the car's connectivity and entertainment capabilities are being singled out. It supports Apple CarPlay and Android Auto and fast-charging USB ports in the front. Infotainment is delivered via an integrated 8-inch touchscreen system and there's even the option of a premium Bang & Olufsen sound system with 10 speakers.\nWhat's more, owners will be able to start, lock and locate their EcoSport with nothing more than their smartphones and the FordPass app.\nHowever, the powerplants aren't too shabby either. Initial engines will include a 1.0-liter turbocharged EcoBoost unit and a 2.0-liter engine that comes with all-wheel drive as standard.\nStandard equipment on all models will include a six-speed automatic transmission and up to 30 separate storage spaces, hooks and pockets for ultimate practicality.\nAs for personalization, there will be a choice of 10 exterior paint finishes, seven ambient interior lighting options and a choice of four different trim levels.",

      "text": "College: York's Ford to play lacrosse at Wheaton College   9:55 PM Jay Pinsonnault jpinsonnault@seacoastonline.com @JayPinceSMG \nThe moment Emma Ford stepped on the Wheaton College campus she knew she didn’t want leave. \nFrom the pond in the middle of the campus, to the bridge that students crossed from their apartments to the dining hall and classroom buildings, to the pretty backdrop highlighted by the multi-colored foliage, Ford knew she found her next home. \n“Academically, athletically and just the location, they were all perfect for me,” Ford said. “I stepped on campus and I just knew it was where I wanted to be.” \nFord signed her National Letter of Intent last Wednesday to play women’s lacrosse at Wheaton College, a Division III program in Norton, Mass. \n“The coach is awesome and the girls are awesome,” Ford said. \nFord, who also plays hockey at York, was also considering Castleton University and Keene State College. \n“Keene was a close second,” Ford said. “I always wanted to play club hockey and Keene has a really program for that, but Wheaton, in the end, was a better fit.” \nWheaton went 9-9 last season, losing to Springfield, 9-4, in the New England Women's and Men's Athletic Conference (NEWMAC) Tournament semifinal. \n“She has a nice shot and is dangerous in the open field,” York girls lacrosse coach Jodie Lawlor said. “I think Wheaton is a good fit for her.” \nFord led the Wildcats in assists last season as a junior when York advanced to the Class B South quarterfinal round. \nFord, who says she needs to work on her footwork and stick skills to adjust to the college game, took in a pair of Wheaton games last season. \n“I liked how they used each other efficiently,” Ford said. “Even when they were losing, they were cheering as loud as they could; it was a good atmosphere to be around.” About Us",

      "text": "Ford Motor f is moving ahead with plans to shift production of small car s to Mexico from Michigan, while “two very important products” will be built in its U.S. factories, Chief Executive Officer Mark Fields told Reuters on Tuesday.\nPresident-elect Donald Trump has criticized Ford for the decision to shift production of Focus small car s to Mexico in 2018, and said he would consider levying tariffs on Mexican-made Ford s. Trump has also said he wants to scrap the North American Free Trade agreement, which also includes Canada, and to build a wall on the U.S.- Mexico border to stop undocumented immigrants.\n“We’re going forward with our plan to move production of the Ford Focus to Mexico , and importantly that’s to make room for two very important products we’ll be putting back into Michigan plants,” Fields said in an interview on the sidelines of the Los Angeles Auto Show. “There will be no job impact whatsoever with this move.”\nFord Chairman Bill Ford Jr. said last month he met with Trump. Ford has countered Trump’s criticism, saying the company, founded by his great-grandfather, makes more car s and trucks in the United States than any other automaker.\nFields said with U.S. gasoline prices so low, “it’s very difficult for us to be able to make money on a vehicle produced in the U.S.” in the small car segment. If Ford decided to build the Focus small car line in the United States, and had to raise the price, “we wouldn’t sell the vehicle.”\nThe group that represents Ford and other major automakers in the U.S. has asked the Trump transition team to review and consider easing the Obama administration’s fuel economy standards, which call for automakers to more than double the fuel efficiency of their fleets to 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025.\nFuel economy and trade “are two separate issues,” Fields said.\nFord also is moving ahead with plans to use factory capacity in other markets to fill gaps in its U.S. lineup. Company executives used the auto show to promote a small sport utility vehicle called the EcoSport that the company plans to ship from India.\n“We already have the plants and investment in other parts of the world. It frees us up to make further investments in the U.S.,” Fields said, pointing to the money invested to launch a new SuperDuty pickup at a plant in Kentucky.\nFor more information on Ford, watch Fortune’s video: \n\nFord has cautioned investors that it sees demand for car s and light trucks hitting a plateau in the United States. Fields said heading into the last two months of the year “we are seeing a tougher pricing environment.”\n“We expect the industry to be about the same as it was last year, probably a little lower on the retail side, and a continuing competitive pricing environment,” Fields said.",

CEO Mark Fields says the presidential election won't change the company's plans to move small car production to Mexico. | AP file photo Associated Press \nDETROIT — Ford Motor Co. CEO Mark Fields says the presidential election won’t change the company’s plans to move small car production to Mexico. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump has repeatedly criticized Ford for moving production to Mexico. Trump wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and has called for a 35 percent tariff on goods shipped from Mexico. \nIn an interview with CNBC Tuesday, Fields said Ford is proceeding with its plan to move Focus car production from Michigan to a new plant in Mexico by 2018. He stressed that no jobs will be lost, since the Michigan plant will make two other vehicles. \nFields also warned that a tariff would affect the entire industry — and autoworkers’ profit-sharing checks — since many companies sell Mexican- and Canadian-made vehicles or parts.

CEO Mark Fields says the presidential election won’t change the company’s plans to move small car production to Mexico. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump has repeatedly criticized Ford for moving production to Mexico. Trump wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and has called for a 35-percent tariff on goods shipped from Mexico. \nIn an interview with CNBC Tuesday, Fields said Ford is proceeding with its plan to move Focus car production from Michigan to a new plant in Mexico by 2018. He stressed that no jobs will be lost, since the Michigan plant will make two other vehicles. \nFields also warned that a tariff would affect the entire industry — and autoworkers’ profit-sharing checks — since many companies sell Mexican- and Canadian-made vehicles or parts. \nCopyright © The Associated Press.

      "text": "To: monkapotamus \nNot news. \nThe Ford planning for shifts in production came long before Trump was mentioned as a candidate, and they probably had tens (or hundreds) of millions of dollars in it when it became an issue. \nFord’s transfer is really a challenge to fed regulations. Higher-profit and lower mpg vehicles will continue to be made in the US. More government squeezing by emission and mpg regulation would then come directly at the expense of American workers while ‘green’ incentives would go to imports. Ford is playing hardball with the bureaucracy. \nTrump’s success with the bureaucracy remains to be seen. 33 posted on 11/16/2016 5:59:02 AM PST by jjotto (\"Ya could look it up!\") [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies ] To: monkapotamus \nIf this happened in November 2008, the story would be about how horrible it was that Bush policies pushed Ford to move the plant and how Obama was going to change all that when he took office. 34 posted on 11/16/2016 5:59:19 AM PST by Opinionated Blowhard (\"When the people find they can vote themselves money, that will herald the end of the republic.\") [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies ] To: monkapotamus \nI’ve been driving the same Honda Element - made in Marysville, Ohio - for ten years. It has about 240,000 miles on it, and it looks like it just left the showroom. The engine is getting a little tired, but there’s no smoke, no leaks. \nI parked it in 2009. Bought a Chevy HHR SS - made in Mexico. It was a hot rod, and a lot of fun, but the Honda required far less maintenance. \nI hope to drive the Element (yeah, it’s ugly) until it reaches 450,000 miles. \nThen, I’ll have it crushed into a cube, put a piece of glass on top, and turn it into a coffee table. \nHondas from Ohio; Chevys from Mexico. \nWhat a country...

As auto sales have flagged in the U.S., the industry has turned its focus to alternative transit applications. Fields also highlighted its Chariot shuttle service, which Ford acquired this year, and its bike-sharing program.\nHe sees \"substantial revenue opportunity\" from providing mobility solutions to U.S. commuters, including those not owning autos.\nFord shares fell 2 cents to 12.04 in the stock market today .

      "title": "Ford CEO Warns of \"Huge Impact\" to Economy from Trump Trade Plans",
      "text": "Ford CEO Mark Fields warned that President-elect Donald Trump's proposed trade plans — which include a 35 percent tariff on motor vehicles imported from Mexico — would have a \"huge impact\" on the entire American economy, not just the auto industry.\nThough Fields said Ford has \"had conversations with the transition team\" for the incoming president, his comments, made during a keynote speech marking the opening of the 2016 Los Angeles Auto Show, could escalate a sometimes sharp dispute that began early during the election campaign. It was touched off by Ford's announcement it would shift small car production from U.S. plants to a new factory in Mexico.\n\"We've got to keep (factories) here. It's not that hard to do,\" then-candidate Trump said during one campaign interview, adding that if Ford and other makers continued to expand in Mexico, \"pretty soon all we're going to have is nursing home jobs.\"\nEarlier this year, Ford Chairman William Clay Ford Jr. met with Trump to discuss what the grandson of company founder Henry Ford describe as \"infuriating\" attacks. Ford executives stressed that they were replacing production of slow-selling small cars like the Focus with high-demand light truck models such as the F-150 pickup.\nThat failed to quell the dispute, the idea of tearing up trade deals such as NAFTA and a yet-unapproved trans-Pacific pact becoming a centerpiece of the Trump campaign. There have been some signs that the New York businessman might pull back from such tariffs, though with the transition process reportedly in turmoil it has become difficult to tell precisely where the next administration will position itself once in office.\n'Free Trade is a Must'\nFields used his keynote speech to send a message that aggressive anti-trade moves would be risky, telling reporters and industry officials gathered in downtown Los Angeles that, \"A tariff like that (Trump has proposed) could have a huge impact on the U.S. economy.\"\nFields tried to soften the tone of his comments, adding that there have been meetings with the transition team, and that, \"we look forward to working with a new administration and the entire newly elected Congress.\"\nBut free trade is a must for Ford, he added, Fields indicating that the second-largest U.S. automaker doesn't intend to back down from plans that it has, in the past, said are necessary to delivering an acceptable return on investment.\nIn fact, just hours before Fields delivered his morning keynote, Ford announced another move that could lead to further friction with Washington. The carmaker says it will begin selling a new entry-level SUV in the U.S. in 2018, with the little EcoSport coming off an assembly line in India.\nThat would mark the first time a major manufacturer has imported an Indian-made automobile, but others may follow — along with one of that country's biggest local producers, Mahinda & Mahindra.\nMeanwhile, two automakers have begun importing vehicles from China, Volvo moving first with a stretched version of its S60 sedan dubbed Inscription. General Motors followed recently with the launch of the Chinese-made Buick Envision utility vehicle.\nMexico in the Headlights\nBut Mexico, in particular, has been in the crosshairs for Donald Trump. The country has experienced explosive growth in its carmaking sector in recent years, becoming one of the five largest automotive manufacturing nations in the world.\nJust this week, Toyota broke ground for a new assembly plant in the state of Guanajuato that will produce the world's best-selling vehicle, the Corolla. New plants run by Kia, Audi and Nissan's Infiniti brand went into production in recent months.\nIndustry planners say that low wages are only a part of the appeal. They also point to the need to balance operations around the world, sometimes shifting production bases to both keep plants operating efficiently and holding down costs.\n\"The automotive business is truly global. So, to make this whole thing work, you have to have a relatively free flow of components and vehicles across borders,\" said Joe Phillippi, head of Auto Trends Consulting. \"It's how you keep the costs down.\"\nOther automotive insiders have begun weighing in, though cautiously, many worried about going on the record and getting off on a bad foot with the new administration.\n\"I am sure free and fair trade is a better way for all of us,\" said Ralf Speth, CEO of British-based Jaguar Land Rover. Though the German-born executive insisted he was not criticizing Trump, or any specific U.S. trade plans, he stressed his belief that trade barriers \"only make things more difficult and, at the end of the day, this takes buying power away from the people.\"",

      "text": "Daily Drive-Thru: Debuts for Honda, Kia, Nissan in Los Angeles; Ford is undeterred by Trump; treats for NYC commuters, and more Debuts for Honda, Kia; Ford unafraid of Trump tarrifs, and more Brian Krzanich, chief executive officer of Intel Corp., speaks during Automobility LA ahead of the Los Angeles Auto Show. (Bloomberg via Getty Images) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Updated: Wednesday, November 16, 2016, 9:26 AM \nBetween vehicle automation, ride-hailing partnerships and car-sharing fleets, it seems like some automakers are actively trying to sell fewer cars. \nFord Chief Executive Mark Fields addressed that very topic during his keynote speech to open Tuesday’s AutoMobility L.A. technology showcase at the Los Angeles Auto Show. He explained that the future of his company is not so much focused on cars as it transportation at large. \nHe talked about battling traffic congestion; taking steps to have less, not more, cars on the road, and working with cities to renovate transportation practices. That was in the opening first few minutes of the exhibition. \nAs you can imagine, there was a whole lot news more from automakers and tech companies alike. Lucky for you, I’ve got the full rundown waiting for you below. \nWe’ve got car debuts from Ford, Honda, Kia and Nissan, plus an electrified concept from Jaguar and real life plug-in hybrid from Cadillac. On top of that, we’ve got some exciting developments for New York City commuters, Hyundai technology that allows owners to talk to their cars and more in this jam-packed edition of the Daily Drive Thru. \nCheck out our gallery of the new releases at this year’s show and, as always, connect with us on social media to get the latest updates. \nFOLLOW DAILY NEWS AUTOS ON FACEBOOK. ‘LIKE’ US HERE. New Car Round-Up: L.A. Auto Show Edition \nI could dedicate this entire article to recapping the redesigned, refreshed and relocated vehicles that came down the pike yesterday, but rather than waste your time and mine, I’ll keep it snappy, give you what you need to know about each vehicle then direct you to a magical place where you can continue to expand your mind (spoiler: it’ll probably just be a link to another post written by me or one of my colleagues). First Pictures: 2018 Ford EcoSport \n2018 Ford EcoSport: Ford is bringing this compact crossover up from Brazil to the U.S. for the 2018 model year. It’ll slot just below the Escape, cost about $20,000 and, seeing as Ford opted to use Ryan Seacrest, DJ Khaled and Snapchat to introduce it to North America, I think it’s safe to say that the EcoSport’s target demographic will be millennials. \nRead more about the EcoSport here . \n2017 Kia Soul Exclaim: The hip-hop hamsters are gone, as are the criticisms about its appearance, now all that’s left for Kia’s subcompact crossover is a sterling reputation and a fanbase that’s poised to push the nameplate over the 150,000-sales mark this year. The only knock on the Soul is that it lacks a certain oomph under the hood, but that too is about to change with the turbocharged Exclaim package. \nRead more about the Soul Exclaim here . First Pictures: 2017 Nissan Sentra NISMO \n2017 Nissan Sentra NISMO: In other turbocharging news, Nissan announced that it will make the Sentra its first-ever mainstream vehicle to receive the NISMO treatment. It’s stylish, sporty and reasonably priced. The only catch is it’s eerily similar to the Sentra SR Turbo, another new add for the 2017 model that has the same horsepower and torque rating but with a cheaper price tag. \nRead more about the Sentra NISMO here . The Civic Si is a (finally) turbocharged return to fun from the beloved Japanese automaker that emphasized it in the first place. (Brian Leon) \nHonda Civic Si Prototype: Nissan isn’t the only Japanese automaker having fun with its sedan lineup in Los Angeles. Honda brought along a similarly turbocharged version of the Civic, which seems to be targeting performance-oriented competitors such as the Volkswagen’s GTI and Ford’s Focus ST. It also ain’t too hard on the eyes either. \nRead more about the Civic Si here . First Pictures: Jaguar I-Pace Concept \nJaguar I-Pace Concept: Calling this a debut would be a bit premature seeing as Jaguar does not yet have a set production plan for it, you can pretty much pencil the I-Pace in for a 2018 or 2019 model year release. Essentially a battery-powered version of the fun and functional F-Pace SUV, the I-Pace appears to be taking aim at Tesla’s Model X crossover. Chalk this up as yet another bold but brilliant move by the resurgent British brand. \nRead more about the I-Pace here . \nBONUS: First Pictures: 2017 Cadillac CT6 Plug-In Hybrid \n2017 Cadillac CT6 Plug-In Hybrid: OK, so this was nowhere near the Los Angeles Auto Show, but since we’re recapping the first looks of the day, I’ll show some love to Cadillac’s first proper plug-in hybrid electric vehicle. I say proper because, as some of you might remember, a few years ago Caddy essentially co-opted the Chevrolet Volt, fancied it up, slapped a Cadillac badge on the grille and called it the ELR. Unlike that sad excuse for an EV, the plug-in CT6 will help you save money at the pump and look good while doing it. \nRead more about the CT6 plug-in here . Ford’s CEO outlines plan for mobility future Mark Fields, President and CEO, Ford Motor Company, delivered the keynote address to media and guests at the 2016 Los Angeles International Auto Show's AutoMobility L.A. exhibition. (Ford) \nEarlier this year, Ford threw down a gauntlet in the automotive world, promising fully-autonomous cars by 2021 for ride-sharing purposes. Then, it went on to promise a personal-use robotic car by 2025 . It has gradually migrated the heart of research operation from southeast Michigan to northern California to attract computer scientists, rather than engineers. \nFor those concerned that that 113-year-old automaker is having an identity crisis, CEO Mark Fields both confirmed those suspicions and tamped them down during his opening remarks yesterday. Ford, he said, is becoming a tech company and an information company, as well. The focus of the Dearborn, Mich.-based company will still be transportation, but less on an individual basis and more so on a mass level. \nFields said Ford will work with cities across the country to identify transportation needs, craft individual remediation plans then help execute them. Many of those solutions will target alleviating road congestion through vehicle sharing and automation. \nIn a way, it’s as if Ford is trying to use 21st-century technologies to undo the damage it inflicted upon this country during the 20th century. For as much good Ford’s assembly line and affordable vehicles did for this country, it also enabled people to flee their cities in favor of suburbia, leaving many once-great metropolises depleted with over-taxed infrastructures and the congestion issues that Ford is now looking to fix. \nSource: Ford Fields: Trump election won’t alter Ford’s plans Ford will continue making the Fiesta and other small vehicles in Mexico despite President-elect Trump's tarrif tough talk. (Ford) \nIt’s no secret that, as a candidate for president, Donald Trump was no fan of Ford’s decision to move some vehicle production to Mexico. As president-elect, Trump has not backed down from his claims that he will tear up trade deals and impose a steep tariff on U.S. companies that produce goods outside the country, but that tough talk has not deterred the Dearborn automaker. \nAt the Los Angeles Auto Show yesterday, Fields told reporters that his company will continue shifting its small car assembly operation toward Mexico as planned, despite facing an import tariff as high as 35 percent. Fields also said Ford would not be swayed from its course on vehicle electrification, even if the Trump Administration rolls back fuel economy and emissions standards. \n“I do think electrification will become a bigger part of this industry because it’s not only the U.S. When you look globally at European regulations and China regulations it’s really driving toward electrification,” Fields told Automotive News. \nSource: Automotive News Hyundai’s Blue Link system gets Alexa-fied \nAlexa, write the rest of today’s Drive-Thru… What’s that? You don’t have the update yet?… Shoot. \nIt turns out the Amazon Echo’s Alexa software still has some limitations, though seemingly fewer by the day. Yesterday, Hyundai announced that it has synced its signature connectivity package, Blue Link, with the Echo voice recognition system, enabling car owners to control their vehicles’ engines, locks and climate settings without lifting a finger. \nOwners of the Hyundai’s Ioniq Electric, Ioniq Plug-In and Sonata Plug-In to control charging in their vehicles with the sound of their voice. Amazon Echo is compatible with all second generation Blue Link systems, which will be available to paying subscribers in all 2017 Hyundai models and most 2016s. \nRead more about the Echo-Blue Link connection here . BMW expands ReachNow to Brooklyn \nReachNow, BMW’s take on car sharing, is headed for Brooklyn. The German luxury automaker announced that the borough would be its third location in the U.S. and first east of the Mississippi after debuting the service in Portland and Seattle. \nLike other car sharing programs, ReachNow requires a membership fee and charges customers per minute of use. The big difference is this service will allow Brooklynites to drive BMW 3 Series or Mini Clubman instead of some of the more economy-oriented vehicles offered by other services. \nAfter paying a one-time $39 membership fee, ReachNow customers pay 49 cents per driving minute and 30 cents per parked minute, with caps of $50 for three hours, $80 for 12 hours and $110 for 24 hours. All cars must be returned to home areas, which include certain streets within Williamsburg, Greenpoint, Borough Park, Bushwick, Bed-Stuy, Crown Heights and Sunset Park. \nIn addition to the geographic expansion, BMW announced that it also would expand the services provided by ReachNow to include on-demand ride-hailing, maintained fleets that are at static locations, multi-day reservations and peer-to-peer vehicle sharing. \nSource: BMW Gett to offer free, cheap rides to NYC commuters Gett is looking to expand its New York user base by offering free rides to commuters in Manhattan. (Gett) \nThere’s a new ride-hailing company in town that’s marking its territory by offering free rides to New Yorkers. Until December 5, commuters will be able to hail a free ride through the Gett app in certain underserved parts of Manhattan. After December 5, rides prices will shoot up to a whopping $3 flat. \nFounded in Israel and heavily backed by Volkswagen, Gett has established strong customer bases in several European cities and Tel Aviv by promoting its no-surge price policy. Now, it’s looking to make up ground on competitors such as Uber and Lyft in the U.S, hence the ridiculously cheap promotion. \nFree rides will be offered between 7 a.m. and 10 a.m. as well as between 5 p.m. and 8 p.m. Designated routes are designed to serve people who live on the Upper East Side, Upper West and in the East Village. \nSource: Gett \nCheck the Daily Drive-Thru every weekday morning to get the latest on the most important news and trends in the automotive world. \nYou can find Tuesday’s installment of the Drive-Thru here and view the rest of our archives here . \nGot a news tip or a comment?

      "text": "Follow CBSMIAMI.COM: Facebook | Twitter \nMIAMI (CBSMiami) – Turns out those rumors all those years ago about Han and Princess Leia weren’t rumors after all.\nIn her new book “The Princess Diarist” Carrie Fisher credits an on-set romance for her on-screen chemistry with Harrison Ford in the 1977 blockbuster ‘Star Wars’. At the time Fisher was 19 and Ford was 33 and married.\nFisher’s book is billed as an intimate, hilarious and revealing recollection of what happened behind the scenes on one of the most famous film sets of all time. “I looked over at Harrison,” she writes, “And thought he looked like a movie star.”\nFisher said their “intense affair,” which lasted about three months, ended when they wrapped shooting for the film.

Delivering the keynote speech at the Los Angeles Auto Show, Fields said the tariff would have a \"huge impact\" on the entire American economy. Trump has been critical of Ford's decision to add nearly three-thousand jobs in Mexico and shift small car production to that country. ",

      "text": "  GM, Ford, Toyota Report October Sales Decline Slowing October sales reinforce analysts' fear that US auto sales may have plateaued   GM +0% F +0% TM +0% NSANY +0% VLKAY +0% \nU.S. auto sales declined for the month of October despite discounts provided by dealers. Truck sales continued to show strength, but it was not enough to surpass a year-ago record in October sales with a seasonally adjusted rate of 17.5 million units. \nOne of the key reasons for the drop in sales is that it had fewer selling days in comparison to last year. Industry analysts had expected volumes to drop in the range of 6% to 8% for the month. \nAmerican automakers reported plunging sales for the month. General Motors ( NYSE:GM ), Ford ( NYSE:F ) andChrysler each posted sales decline, down 1.7%, 11.7% and 10%. Here’s a detailed look at the performances of the U.S. and other automakers. \nThe Detroit Three \nGeneral Motors' U.S. sales plunged 1.7% for the month from last year comparable's period. Buick, Cadillac, GMC and Chevrolet together sold 258,626 vehicles in October. Although Buick witnessed strong sales gain of 7.4%, it was not enough to offset declines seen at Cadillac and GMC. Chevrolet sales, on the other hand, remained flat. In fact, the company’s top seller, Chevrolet Silverado, plunged 4%. Sales to retail customers climbed 3%.   GM \nFord posted a severe decline of 11.7% to 188,813 units in the U.S. auto market for October mainly because of the plunge in sales of Ford Mustang and Ford Fusion sedan. However, October was a good month for Lincoln as it sold 9,069 vehicles, up 6.9% year over year. Lincoln, which saw massive sales gain for its cars of 40.6% to 4,028 units, was the key driving force behind the luxury brand’s strong performance. Lincoln SUVs, on the other hand, experienced a drop of 10.3% to 5,041 units. The Blue Oval’s retail sales were down 7%. \nFiat Chrysler’s sales were down 10%. While sales of Jeep, Chrysler, Dodge, Alfa and Fiat were weak, Ram sales were up 12%. Again, Maserati, the Italian luxury brand, was another bright spot for the company with sales surging nearly 12% to 1,304 units sold as compared with last year when it sold 1,164 units. \nPerformance of the other automakers \nToyota ’s ( NYSE:TM ) sales were weak, down 8.7% for October due to low demand. Toyota division car sales dropped 17% to 74,299 units old. Lexus division car sales plunged 19.7% to 10,098 vehicles compared with last year. Moreover, Toyota division truck sales were down 1% to 87,193 units. \nNissan ’s ( NSANY ) sales plunged 2.2% to 113,520 units. While sales of Nissan Armada SUV climbed a mammoth 79%, Murano SUV sales doubled last year. The combined sales of trucks, SUVs and crossovers improved 12.7%. Infiniti sales were flat, whereas the combined sales of Nissan and Infiniti declined 13%. \nVolkswagen ( VLKAY ) also registered a sales decline due to the underperformance of most of its vehicles. Sales plunged 18.5% to 24,779 units year over year. However, Beetle sales spiked 29.5%. \nOverall, U.S. retails sales were a bright spot in October as they rose 0.8%. That compares with an expectation of 6%. The better-than-expected retail numbers signify the resurgence of retail customers and higher consumer spending participating in the economic growth. It may be noted, though, the overall slowness in October sales is reinforcing analysts’ expectations regarding the U.S. auto market having reached its peak. Only time will tell if sales volume will go higher than 2015 to report yet another record year. Let’s stay tuned for the closing months. \nDisclosure: I do not hold any position in the stock/s discussed in this article. \n  A seasoned writer with keen interest in the automotive, technology, telecommunication, retail and aerospace sectors.

      "text": "7 News WSVN \nFORT LAUDERDALE, FLA. (WSVN) - There’s a new horse on the force at the Fort Lauderdale Police Department: a mustang named Ford. \nThe unit invited the public to meet their newest member, Tuesday, at their barn along Sunrise Boulevard and North Federal Highway. \nSeven-year-old Ford is part of a program aimed at training wild horses. Now, after months of coaching, he’s getting ready to represent his brothers in blue. \nFort Lauderdale Police Detective Kevin Dupree said the department welcomes their four-legged addition with open arms. “They are actually officers. One horse represents five, six officers,” he said. “These officers are amazing. The work they do, in terms of crowd control, in terms of responding to areas that officers just can’t get into, the horses can do it.” \nFord is now a permanent South Florida resident, after making his way across the country from California. \nCopyright 2016 Sunbeam Television Corp.

      "text": "Ford EcoSport Coming To America In The 2018 Model Year 57 SHARES \nFans of Ford’s CUVs have been asking for the EcoSport to make its way to America and are finally getting their wish. Coming for the 2018 model year is the smallest SUV that Ford produces, the EcoSport CUV. Already produced in Chennai, India, these will also make the only vehicle that Ford imports from that country. \nSeveral examples of the EcoSport are on hand for the LA Auto Show which is happening this week. Attendees will get a first hand look at the small, family friendly CUV and its surprising engine options. They’ll also be able to see the changes made to the front fascia, specifically the grill size and placement. \nOne of the choices that will be available is the turbocharged 1L 3 cylinder EcoBoost while the other is a 2L 4 cylinder. At the moment, both are matched only to a six speed automatic transmission but this may expand closer to 2018. The base models are all front wheel drive but the 2L engine variant’s higher trims offer AWD. Right now, it looks like only the SES and Titanium trim options on the larger engine will give AWD capability. \nThe real surprises come in the cabin with all the modern luxuries and ease of use electronics at your fingertips. FordPass allows owners to Sync Connect their smartphones with the vehicle to remotely control locks. AndroidAuto and Apple CarPlay have also made their way in as options for entertainment. an 8″ tablet for navigation and information is mounted in the center of the dash. \nWhat looks to be an upgrade option is the B&O Play sound system offering a 675 watt sound system through 10 speakers. 12 volt power outlets are positioned both in the front console as well as in the rear for convenience.Two USB ports in the dash offer fast charging as well as further connectivity. \nWe’ve only had a good look at the SES trim interior so far, with its leather and cloth blended seating. The copper accented black interior looks sharp and hints at some of the storage and cargo options. Believe it or not, there are at least 30 hooks, pockets, and bins available to keep everything organized. Seven ambient lighting options on the interior compliment the 10 exterior paint options that it will launch with. \nAt the moment, that’s all we know until more details come out during and after the LA Auto Show. Pricing hasn’t been announced but similar vehicles trend around the $20,000 mark when brand new. Have they missed any marks or is there anything that stands out as a great feature to you? Let us know what you think of the Ford family’s new smallest member in the SUV class. Categories : Production Cars About James Murrell \nI love to read about and research all sorts of vehicles from restored classics to top shelf supercars, monstrous offroaders to weird concept vehicles. I always have a vehicle build happening on one side of my garage for myself and a second bay open for my friends to come and build their dreams too. Subscribe  ",

      "text": "Thank you for subscribing! 1 of 9 Days after his sordid affair with Carrie Fisher was revealed to the world, Harrison Ford took a break from his busy schedule to fly his helicopter. Get the details on his secret romance from decades past! Advertisement FameFlynet FameFlynet Harrison Ford looked solemn as he made his way to the helicopter, no doubt avoiding reports of his rumored affair. FameFlynet FameFlynet As Radar exclusively reported, Carrie Fisher revealed the shocking secret earlier this week, claiming Ford seduced her after getting her drunk on the set of first Star Wars movie ! Advertisement FameFlynet FameFlynet Now 60, the former Princess Leia blew the whistle on her forbidden romance with Han Solo in a forthcoming book, The Princess Diarist, exclusively obtained by RadarOnline.com. FameFlynet FameFlynet Harrison was a 34-year-old married father of two when he met the fresh-faced, 19-year-old Carrie on the London set of the blockbuster sci-fi classic. The daughter of showbiz royals, Eddie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds , Carrie said Harrison offered to drive her home when she was ”wine sodden” and they ended up in bed. Advertisement FameFlynet FameFlynet The teenager was sexually inexperienced and complained she was a “bad kisser.” She recalled that their first lovemaking experience didn’t exactly send her to the stars, either, but she forgave him because “he really was handsome.” FameFlynet FameFlynet Carrie couldn't remember many details of their three-month relationship because of \"the brutal strength of Harrison's preferred strain of pot.\" FameFlynet FameFlynet Her book contains excerpts from a diary she kept of the affair, in which she said she tried \"relentlessly\" to make him love her and fantasized that he would ask her to marry him and give her a \"gold band with diamonds (inscribed) 'Carrison.\"' FameFlynet FameFlynet But at the finish of the 1976 shoot Harrison returned to his wife Mary and two sons . Their marriage broke up soon after, Carrie wrote, but she insisted the divorce was \"for reasons having nothing whatsoever to do with me.\"   X",

      "title": "Don’t Expect Us to Backpedal on Mexico Plans: Ford CEO",
      "text": "Tweet \nThere’s something about billions of dollars in investment and carefully planned long-term product strategies that make it hard for an automaker to turn on a dime in the face of a threat. \nFord Motor Company CEO Mark Fields says his company has no plans to reverse course on its goal of boosting production of cars and components in Mexico, even after President-elect Trump’s promise of a 35-percent tariff on vehicles crossing the Rio Grande. \nIt’s a game of chicken Ford intents to win. \nSpeaking after an address at the Los Angeles Auto Show last night, Fields said it’s full steam ahead on the automaker’s Mexico plans. Saying he feels that such a tariff would negatively impact the U.S. economy, Fields implied that Trump’s election promise won’t amount to much. \n“A tariff like that would be imposed on the entire auto sector, and that could have a huge impact on the U.S. economy,” Fields said, according to Automotive News . “I continue to be convinced that the right policies will prevail. I think we all share the same objective, which is a healthy and vibrant U.S. economy.” \nCertainly, General Motors and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles share a similar strategy, and aren’t in the mood to change it . Earlier this year, Ford invested $1.6 billion to build a Mexican small car assembly plant (where the U.S. market Focus will eventually find a home). A year earlier, the Blue Oval dropped another $2.5 billion on engine and transmissions plants south of the border. \nDespite the acrimony between Fields and Trump during the campaign period, the CEO claims Ford is in “constant contact” with the president-elect’s transition team. Fields claims he wishes the new administration well. \nThere’s plenty of speculation surrounding what the election of Trump means for environmental standards, including CAFE targets, but Ford isn’t paying it much mind. If the 54.5 mile-per-gallon CAFE target does indeed get a haircut, the automaker claims it hasn’t any plans to dial back on its development of electric vehicle technology. The market for such vehicles is far bigger than just the U.S., said Fields. \n“When you look globally at European regulations and China regulations it’s really driving toward electrification,” he said. \n[Image: Ford Motor Company]",

      "text": "Jim Hoft Nov 16th, 2016 7:55 am Leave a Comment \nGuest post by Aleister at American Lookout : \nThere’s no evidence to show that Ford is moving truck production from Mexico to Ohio because of Trump as he hasn’t even been sworn in yet. But it’s awfully coincidental, isn’t it? \nCNN Money reported: \nFord shifts truck production from Mexico to Ohio \nFord’s heavy duty pickup trucks which used to be built in Mexico started rolling off an assembly line in Ohio this week. \nThat’s good news for the 1,000 Ford workers in Ohio, who might have otherwise been out of work. \nIt’s also good publicity for Ford (F), which has been under fire for investing so much in Mexico. In April, the automaker said it would invest $2.5 billion in transmission plants in the Mexican states of Chihuahua and Guanajuato, creating about 3,800 jobs there. \nFord’s south-of-the-border strategy has drawn heavy criticism from groups such as the United Auto Workers union and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. \nThe Avon Lake, Ohio, plant produced its first batch of Ford’s full-size F-650 and F-750 pick up trucks on Wednesday. \nThe man hasn’t even taken office yet. And we’re seeing change! \nImagine what Trump can do once he’s sitting in the White House. \nThings are going to get better, folks. \nIgnore the media. Trump is going to make America great again.

Photo: Bill Pugliano/Getty Images During his campaign, Donald Trump singled out Ford by name, calling on the American car manufacturer to stop sending jobs to Mexico and threatening to slap tariffs on any cars imported from south of the border.\nFord’s chief executive officer Mark Fields must not respond well to threats; he admitted to Reuters on Tuesday that Ford was still planning on moving the production of its small cars from Michigan to — you guessed it — Mexico.\n“We’re going forward with our plan to move production of the Ford Focus to Mexico,” he confessed at an interview during the Los Angeles Auto Show. Still, Fields claimed that the move would not have any effect at all on American jobs because the move south will “make room for two very important products we’ll be putting back into Michigan plants.”\nFord has yet to announce what, exactly, those “important products” are, but Fields is convinced that the move will lead to “no job impact whatsoever.”\nWhile Trump won the White House on his promise to keep American manufacturing jobs in America and punish companies that move jobs overseas — hitting them with “a 35 percent tax when they want to ship their products back into the United States” — Ford still considers it cheaper to manufacture outside of the country.\n“It’s very difficult for us to be able to make money on a vehicle produced in the U.S,” said Fields, explaining that if they were to raise the cost of their smaller cars to compensate for the increased cost of manufacturing in the United States the car just “wouldn’t sell.”\nCar makers may not be pleased with Trump’s stance on American manufacturing, but they are still eager to do business with him. The group representing American car makers — including Ford — is already lobbying Trump’s team to do away with President Obama’s fuel-economy standards, which would compel car manufacturers to double the fuel efficiency of their vehicles by 2025.\nFields, for one, doesn’t see the contradiction. Fuel economy and trade, he says, “are two separate issues.”",

      "text": "Posted by Leslie Eastman   at 10:00am | 11/16/2016 - 10:00am \nFord hits the reverse gear for good profits and even better PR. \nLegal Insurrection readers may recall that Professor Jacobson featured Michael Moore clearly predicting the outcome of last week’s vote : “Trump’s election is going to be the biggest Fuck You ever recorded in human history. And it will feel good.” \nA reminder worth checking again, in light of Moore’s prediction. \nMoore recounted a meeting that President-Elect Donald Trump had with the executives of Ford Motor Company, threatening tariff hell if they moved jobs to Mexico. According to Moore, this was “music to the ears of the people of Michigan, Ohio, and Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.” \nIndeed! Analysis has shown that Trump’s “ War with Motor City ” was a key reason for his win. \n…In Michigan, the epicenter of America’s auto industry, Trump won a state that hadn’t supported a Republican candidate since George H.W. Bush in 1988. The Republican nominee also took Ohio, the second-largest car producer among the 50 states, with relative ease. A similar story played out in Indiana, whose vehicle production is slightly ahead of Kentucky this year. \nOverall, the seven states that have manufactured the most cars so far this year all lined up behind Trump: Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky, Alabama, Tennessee and Missouri. \nIt was apparent that Trump’s message resonated with voters who work in manufacturing…. \nPerhaps sensing that the country may be heading in a new, anti-globalist direction, Ford shifted the production of a line of trucks from Mexico to Ohio in mid-2015! \nFord’s [F-650 and F-750 medium-duty commercial] trucks which used to be built in Mexico started rolling off an assembly line in Ohio this week. \nThat’s good news for the 1,000 Ford workers in Ohio, who might have otherwise been out of work. \nIt’s also good publicity for Ford (F), which has been under fire for investing so much in Mexico. In April, the automaker said it would invest $2.5 billion in transmission plants in the Mexican states of Chihuahua and Guanajuato, creating about 3,800 jobs there. \nTo say that their line subsequently had a successful sales year would be an understatement, as sales of medium-duty trucks soared : \n\nIt would be heartening to see Ford and other manufacturing firms return to this country, inspired by profits instead of threatened by tariffs. \nDonald Trump once remarked that the 1990’s sure aren’t like the 1980’s . I sure hope this is a sign that our businesses realize that our President is serious about business, and that Trump will work to ensure that the remainder of this decade is nothing like the 8 years that have preceded it.",

      "text": "KHQ Email Subscription Ford CEO says production plans on track despite election \nDETROIT (AP) - Ford Motor Co. CEO Mark Fields says the presidential election won't change the company's plans to move small car production to Mexico. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump has repeatedly criticized Ford for moving production to Mexico. Trump wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and has called for a 35-percent tariff on goods shipped from Mexico. \nIn an interview with CNBC Tuesday, Fields said Ford is proceeding with its plan to move Focus car production from Michigan to a new plant in Mexico by 2018. He stressed that no jobs will be lost, since the Michigan plant will make two other vehicles. \nFields also warned that a tariff would affect the entire industry - and autoworkers' profit-sharing checks - since many companies sell Mexican- and Canadian-made vehicles or parts.

      "text": "By : Graham King , Editor Ford CEO says Focus production will move to Mexico, despite Donald Trump's election victory. \nDonald Trump’s criticism of Ford’s plan to move Focus production to Mexico was a recurring theme of his presidential campaign. Now that the businessman has won the White House, Ford CEO Mark Fields has said the company will push ahead with its plan despite the new administration’s threat of imposing a 35 percent tariff on cars imported to the United States from Mexico, reports Automotive News. \nDuring a keynote speech at the Los Angeles auto show Fields said: “A tariff like that would be imposed on the entire auto sector, and that could have a huge impact on the U.S. economy. I continue to be convinced that the right policies will prevail. I think we all share the same objective, which is a healthy and vibrant U.S. economy.” \nFord is spending $1.6 billion on a new factory in Mexico that will produce the Focus. It is also building engine and transmission plants in the country. The Fiesta is built there already. \nTwo new models are due to be produced at Ford’s Michigan Assembly Plant in place of the Focus . \nFord is not the only automaker to build cars for the U.S. market in Mexico. Others include Fiat Chrysler, Toyota, and Nissan. \nFields said he had sent a letter of congratulation to Trump following his election victory, adding that Ford is in “constant communication” with the president-elect’s transition team. \n“We have a proven track record of working with policymakers going all the way back to Teddy Roosevelt. We expect to work very effectively and positively with the president-elect’s administration, as well as the new Congress.” \nFord’s priorities have changed with the new administration, Fields concluded. It continues to target protection from currency manipulation, tax reform, safe adoption of autonomous cars, and fuel economy regulations that “are aligned with market realities.” Be part of something big About this article",

      "text": "Graham Crouch | Bloomberg | Getty Images A Ford Motor Co. EcoSport sport-utility vehicle (SUV) is displayed at the Auto Expo 2012 in New Delhi, India, on Thursday, Jan. 5, 2012. Ford 's new EcoSport model is set to become the smallest SUV in the Detroit automaker's line-up, but it could fuel the biggest debate over automotive trade. \nThat's because the little EcoSport will roll off a Ford assembly line in India, rather than one in the United States. \nFord has also made plans to move all of its small passenger car production from its U.S. operations to a new facility in Mexico - a decision frequently cited by President-elect Donald Trump during his campaign. \nMore from NBC News: \nFord CEO warns of huge impact on economy from Trump trade plans \n'Trump Toilet' name is entirely coincidental, Chinese firm says \nAs Trump leaves press behind for steak dinner, incoming admin already showing lack of transparency \nThe Republican candidate repeatedly warned that he would take steps to block Ford from importing Mexican-made passenger cars, if by no other means than adding hefty tariffs. Since last week's election, the incoming administration has sent signals it will not only try to tear up NAFTA and block a trans-Pacific trade deal but look at barrier-inducing tariffs against a variety of countries, possibly including China. \nAutomakers abroad \nFord is by no means the only automaker that could be impacted should this anti-import rhetoric turn into hard policy. A virtual Who's-Who of the world's automakers can be found either operating Mexican production facilities or setting up new plants there. \nToyota broke ground this week for a new assembly facility in Apaseo el Grande, in the central Mexican state of Guanajuato. It will produce the compact Corolla, the world's best-selling automobile and routinely one of the best-sellers in the U.S. \nOther automakers, including Audi and Kia , have recently gone into production south of the border. A new factory set up by Nissan for its Infiniti luxury model will, in less than two years, begin turning out some Mercedes-Benz products, as well. \nIn some cases, these facilities will add to existing operations in other parts of the world—the Corolla is also built in Blue Springs, Mississippi, as well as at a factory in Canada, for example. But the new Audi plant will be the world source for the popular Q5 sport-utility vehicle. \nMuch of the attention in the current trade debate has focused on Mexico, in part because of the role critics contend the North American Free Trade Agreement has played in shifting automotive jobs out of the U.S. What is clear is that Mexico has become one of the five largest national manufacturers of automobiles in the world. But while low wages are a factor, so is the fact that the country has inked more global trade deals than any other nation in the world. \nFord tough on Mexico \nFord and other carmakers are so far showing no sign of pulling back from Mexico. William Clay Ford Jr., the automaker's chairman and great-grandson of Henry Ford, even met with candidate Trump to try to get the then-candidate to drop what Ford called \"infuriating\" rhetoric. That did little to cool the debate or take Ford out of the bullseye. And it remains to be seen if the EcoSport announcement will fan the fires. \n\"To make this whole thing work, you have to have a relatively free flow of components and vehicles across borders.\" A source close to the carmaker, who wished to remain anonymous to avoid being pulled into the current trade debate, said Ford isn't intentionally waving a red flag. It identified a yawning new product segment and wanted to get into it as soon as possible, the source explained, adding that many of the market's other small SUVs are also coming from abroad in order to hold down costs and build a profitable business case. \n\"This decision was made a long time ago,\" the source explained, adding that, \"It has everything to do with Ford's manufacturing footprint, not the trade battle with Trump.\" \nJoe Phillippi, head of Auto Trends Consulting, said he hopes the trade dispute will die down, though he fears the EcoSport announcement could raise it back to headline levels. \"The automotive business is truly global. So, to make this whole thing work, you have to have a relatively free flow of components and vehicles across borders,\" stressed Philippi. \"It's how you keep the costs down.\" \nThe EcoSport announcement actually could widen the automotive side of the trade debate, as Ford could now become the first carmaker to begin selling Indian-made vehicles in the U.S. when the first of the utes arrives in 2018. Several other Indian companies have laid out similar plans, but have yet to push into the States. \nThe China question \nThe 800-pound gorilla of the trade debate, however, is China. That country already runs up a massive trade deficit with the U.S. and it notably has numerous trade restrictions in place to discourage automotive imports. That has led virtually every major global automaker to set up operations in China—and, by law, to do so in partnership with a domestic Chinese auto manufacturer. \nUntil recently, the rapid pace of growth in China's car market sucked up just about everything the industry could produce, but with the numbers slipping into single digits, that's encouraging both domestic Chinese and foreign-owned carmakers to start looking at export opportunities. \nVolvo , the Swedish-based but Chinese-owned carmaker, recently became the first to bring a car into the U.S. from a factory in Chengdu, capital of Szechuan province. The stretched S60 Inspiration sedan will soon be followed by a longer version of the new Volvo flagship, the S90, it announced last week. \nMeanwhile, Volvo's parent Geely also made it clear it will push into the U.S. with an all-new mid-range, Chinese-made brand, Lynk & Co. \"The goal is somewhere around 2019,\" a source close to the carmaker attending this week Los Angeles Auto Show told NBC News. \nGeneral Motors quietly launched its own Chinese import this fall, the new Buick Envision, like the Ford EcoSport, the smallest SUV in that brand's line-up. Several company officials have privately said that GM decided to forego the usual, splashy new model media preview for Envision to avoid getting caught up in the trade debate. But GM would like to follow up with other Chinese-made models in the not-too-distant future. As that country's second-largest automaker, it has lots of capacity to tap. \nFord would also like to get off the radar in the trade debate, viewing sourcing decisions as a part of a global business strategy, not a matter of politics. But with the launch of EcoSport it could find itself back in the spotlight and draw more attention to the auto industry overall.",

      "text": "Ford's newest car carries a 'Made in India' label Paul A. Eisenstein SHARES Graham Crouch | Bloomberg | Getty Images A Ford Motor Co. EcoSport sport-utility vehicle (SUV) is displayed at the Auto Expo 2012 in New Delhi, India, on Thursday, Jan. 5, 2012. \nFord 's new EcoSport model is set to become the smallest SUV in the Detroit automaker's line-up, but it could fuel the biggest debate over automotive trade. \nThat's because the little EcoSport will roll off a Ford assembly line in India, rather than one in the United States. \nFord has also made plans to move all of its small passenger car production from its U.S. operations to a new facility in Mexico - a decision frequently cited by President-elect Donald Trump during his campaign. \nMore from NBC News: As Trump leaves press behind for steak dinner, incoming admin already showing lack of transparency \nThe Republican candidate repeatedly warned that he would take steps to block Ford from importing Mexican-made passenger cars, if by no other means than adding hefty tariffs. Since last week's election, the incoming administration has sent signals it will not only try to tear up NAFTA and block a trans-Pacific trade deal but look at barrier-inducing tariffs against a variety of countries, possibly including China. \nAutomakers abroad \nFord is by no means the only automaker that could be impacted should this anti-import rhetoric turn into hard policy. A virtual Who's-Who of the world's automakers can be found either operating Mexican production facilities or setting up new plants there. \nToyota broke ground this week for a new assembly facility in Apaseo el Grande, in the central Mexican state of Guanajuato. It will produce the compact Corolla, the world's best-selling automobile and routinely one of the best-sellers in the U.S. \nOther automakers, including Audi and Kia , have recently gone into production south of the border. A new factory set up by Nissan for its Infiniti luxury model will, in less than two years, begin turning out some Mercedes-Benz products, as well. \nIn some cases, these facilities will add to existing operations in other parts of the world—the Corolla is also built in Blue Springs, Mississippi, as well as at a factory in Canada, for example. But the new Audi plant will be the world source for the popular Q5 sport-utility vehicle. \nMuch of the attention in the current trade debate has focused on Mexico, in part because of the role critics contend the North American Free Trade Agreement has played in shifting automotive jobs out of the U.S. What is clear is that Mexico has become one of the five largest national manufacturers of automobiles in the world. But while low wages are a factor, so is the fact that the country has inked more global trade deals than any other nation in the world. \nFord tough on Mexico \nFord and other carmakers are so far showing no sign of pulling back from Mexico. William Clay Ford Jr., the automaker's chairman and great-grandson of Henry Ford, even met with candidate Trump to try to get the then-candidate to drop what Ford called \"infuriating\" rhetoric. That did little to cool the debate or take Ford out of the bullseye. And it remains to be seen if the EcoSport announcement will fan the fires. \"To make this whole thing work, you have to have a relatively free flow of components and vehicles across borders.\" \nA source close to the carmaker, who wished to remain anonymous to avoid being pulled into the current trade debate, said Ford isn't intentionally waving a red flag. It identified a yawning new product segment and wanted to get into it as soon as possible, the source explained, adding that many of the market's other small SUVs are also coming from abroad in order to hold down costs and build a profitable business case. \n\"This decision was made a long time ago,\" the source explained, adding that, \"It has everything to do with Ford's manufacturing footprint, not the trade battle with Trump.\" \nJoe Phillippi, head of Auto Trends Consulting, said he hopes the trade dispute will die down, though he fears the EcoSport announcement could raise it back to headline levels. \"The automotive business is truly global. So, to make this whole thing work, you have to have a relatively free flow of components and vehicles across borders,\" stressed Philippi. \"It's how you keep the costs down.\" \nThe EcoSport announcement actually could widen the automotive side of the trade debate, as Ford could now become the first carmaker to begin selling Indian-made vehicles in the U.S. when the first of the utes arrives in 2018. Several other Indian companies have laid out similar plans, but have yet to push into the States. \nThe China question \nThe 800-pound gorilla of the trade debate, however, is China. That country already runs up a massive trade deficit with the U.S. and it notably has numerous trade restrictions in place to discourage automotive imports. That has led virtually every major global automaker to set up operations in China—and, by law, to do so in partnership with a domestic Chinese auto manufacturer. \nUntil recently, the rapid pace of growth in China's car market sucked up just about everything the industry could produce, but with the numbers slipping into single digits, that's encouraging both domestic Chinese and foreign-owned carmakers to start looking at export opportunities. \nVolvo , the Swedish-based but Chinese-owned carmaker, recently became the first to bring a car into the U.S. from a factory in Chengdu, capital of Szechuan province. The stretched S60 Inspiration sedan will soon be followed by a longer version of the new Volvo flagship, the S90, it announced last week. \nMeanwhile, Volvo's parent Geely also made it clear it will push into the U.S. with an all-new mid-range, Chinese-made brand, Lynk & Co. \"The goal is somewhere around 2019,\" a source close to the carmaker attending this week Los Angeles Auto Show told NBC News. \nGeneral Motors quietly launched its own Chinese import this fall, the new Buick Envision, like the Ford EcoSport, the smallest SUV in that brand's line-up. Several company officials have privately said that GM decided to forego the usual, splashy new model media preview for Envision to avoid getting caught up in the trade debate. But GM would like to follow up with other Chinese-made models in the not-too-distant future. As that country's second-largest automaker, it has lots of capacity to tap. \nFord would also like to get off the radar in the trade debate, viewing sourcing decisions as a part of a global business strategy, not a matter of politics. But with the launch of EcoSport it could find itself back in the spotlight and draw more attention to the auto industry overall. Related Securities",

      "title": "Ford kicks off fiesta for new, more luxurious supermini on November 29",
      "text": "By : Anthony Karr , Editor The manufacturer will reveal the all-new Fiesta in Cologne, Germany. \nThe current generation Ford Fiesta has been on the market for almost eight years, and the Blue oval company is finally ready to present its successor. The global premiere of the all-new 2017 Fiesta will happen on November 29 during a Go Further event in Cologne, Germany. \nThe outgoing Fiesta is a total bestseller for the brand with more than 313 000 sales in 2015, and this new generation should be at least as good as the sixth Fiesta was. Not only that, but Ford wants it to be better in nearly every possible way, so it is creating a bigger and more luxurious supermini. \nFord now has the Ka+ in Europe , and the new Fiesta will be wider and longer than its predecessor, which will provide roomier interior, answering the main criticism of the current Fiesta. The cabin will be equipped with softer materials arranged in more upscale design, combined with the latest SYNC3 infotainment system. Also, expect to see a wide array of safety and assistance systems. \n“The new Fiesta will be our best expression of Ford – lovable fun, sporty to drive and with an unmatched personality true to the spirit of the iconic small car that has delighted generations of customers for the past 40 years,” Ford of Europe executive vice president and president Jim Farley commented. \nWe have already caught Ford testing the hot ST version of the model, expected to hit the market in 2018. It will be powered by a retuned 1.6-liter EcoBoost turbocharged engine with more than 200 horsepower (149 kilowatts). What’s more, the company is also working on its WRC challenger for 2017 , which will feature a completely new aerodynamic package, generating more downforce. \nBack to the regular, street-legal Fiesta, the official premiere will be streamed live on November 29 at 19:00 GMT time. Stay tuned for more details and official photo gallery. \nNote: 2017 Ford Fiesta rendering on top image. \nSource: Ford Be part of something big Ford Fiesta 3- and 5-door spy photos Hide press release Show press release Ford president and CEO Mark Fields and Ford of Europe executive vice president and president Jim Farley to unveil new Ford Fiesta at a special “Go Further” event Ford also will announce Ford Smart Mobility, fuel-saving technology and commercial vehicle news at the event on Nov. 29, in Cologne, Germany Go Further available to watch live or through replay from 19:00 GMT, 29 th November, in six languages.

      "title": "First Look: 2017 Chevrolet Colorado ZR2",
      "text": "NEW YORK DAILY NEWS   2:57 PM \nChevrolet is taking aim at off-road warriors like the Ford Raptor and Ram Rebel with a performance-oriented pickup of its own. \nThough smaller than the aforementioned trucks, the Colorado ZR2 embodies a similar dedication to both on- and off-road driving performance, sporting front and rear electronic locking differentials as well as an off-road oriented version of the dynamic suspension inspired by the Camaro Z28 . The 2017 Colorado ZR2 combines the maneuverability of a midsize pickup with the capability of off-roading performance to create a truck that can tackle just about any obstacle in its path. (Chevrolet) \nChevy introduced the world to its off-roading midsize pickup during the 2016 Los Angeles Auto Show, the same venue where, two years prior, it debuted the ZR2 concept and received widespread praise. \nFans of the concept are not likely to be disappointed by the production version. First Pictures: 2017 Chevrolet Colorado ZR2 \nNormally reserved for track performance vehicles, such as the Camaro Z28, Chevrolet has adapted its Dynamic Suspensions Spool Valve, or DSSV, dampers for off-road use in the ZR2 to give it enhanced precision, ride and handling. \nThat beefier suspension helps the ZR2 stand about two inches taller than the 2016 Colorado Z71 and Chevy says the new version it will offer greater clearance, though it doesn’t give specifics as to approach, departure or break-over angles. The ZR2 powers through off-road terrain with help from either a 3.6-liter V6 with 308 horsepower and 275 lb.-ft. of torque or a class-exclusive Duramax diesel engine capable of 181 horsepower and 369 lb.-ft. of torque. (Chevrolet) \nUnderneath, the Colorado features a thick aluminum skidplate to protect the radiator and engine oil pan, while functional rocker protectors are a standard to shield the side body. \nOn looks alone, the ZR2 puts the Z71 to shame with an aggressively restyled grille that puts the Chevy bowtie in the middle of a black insert to complement the swooping hood design. Plus, sitting on 17-by-8-inch aluminum wheels wrapped in 31-inch Goodyear Duratrac tires and sporting a wider, the new Colorado is imposing from all angles. Some more exclusive features of the 2017 ZR2 include front and rear electronic locking differentials, available diesel engine, first off-road application of Multimatic Dynamic Suspensions Spool Valve damper technology. (Chevrolet) \nUnder the hood, the ZR2 matches the rest of the 2017 Colorado lineup by offering either a 3.6-liter V6 that makes 308 horsepower and 275 lb.-ft. of torque or a Duramax diesel engine that puts out 181 horses and a whopping 369 lb.-ft. of torque. It also has nine driving configurations that include a variety of two- and four-wheel drive settings. \nIn terms of practicality, the ZR2 can tow up to 5,000 pounds and it has a maximum payload of 1,100 pounds. \nThe 2017 Chevrolet ZR2 certainly commands respect on the showroom floor, we’ll see if it can do the same in the backwoods when it hits dealerships early next year.

But it’s awfully coincidental, isn’t it? \nCNN Money reported: \nSPECIAL: Only with your help can we stop Obama’s plans for martial law. Can you donate something, anything to help? \nFord shifts truck production from Mexico to Ohio \nFord’s heavy duty pickup trucks which used to be built in Mexico started rolling off an assembly line in Ohio this week. \nThat’s good news for the 1,000 Ford workers in Ohio, who might have otherwise been out of work. \nIt’s also good publicity for Ford (F), which has been under fire for investing so much in Mexico. In April, the automaker said it would invest $2.5 billion in transmission plants in the Mexican states of Chihuahua and Guanajuato, creating about 3,800 jobs there. \nFord’s south-of-the-border strategy has drawn heavy criticism from groups such as the United Auto Workers union and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. \nThe Avon Lake, Ohio, plant produced its first batch of Ford’s full-size F-650 and F-750 pick up trucks on Wednesday. \nThe man hasn’t even taken office yet.

      "text": "Ford Super Duty is the 2017 Motor Trend Truck of the Year Motor Trend 1 day ago Motor Trend Staff Ford Super Duty is the 2017 Motor Trend Truck of the Year \"Who's your favorite for Truck of the Year?\"\nResearch More Or Compare 2017 ford f-250-super-duty 2017 ford f-350-super-duty 2017 ford f-450-super-duty Compare Cars The conversation plays out across the office in the weeks leading up to all the Of The Year competitions. The question comes from all angles: from video producers, art directors, fellow judges, non-participating editors, photographers—even the honchos in corporate. We have been thinking about this topic ever since we saw the official invite list of vehicles, sometimes since the launch of a particularly impressive vehicle earlier in the year. We all have our favorites, but it's our thorough regimen of testing that determines the winner. Nowhere are those numbers more important than for Truck of the Year.\nAn Of The Year contest plays out one of three ways: There's no clear winner right up to the end; there are two to three potential winners and a nail-biting vote; or there's a clear winner early on and the rest becomes a coronation. In this year's Truck of the Year competition, we knew by the halfway point which truck would win.\nSometimes, one vehicle so clearly satisfies or exceeds our criteria that we spend more time looking for faults than attributes, just to be sure we haven't gotten ahead of ourselves. In this year's field, the Ford Super Duty trucks emerged as the intuitive choice, one that had to be scrutinized, analyzed, and picked apart in subsequent days of testing. Some competitors rose in standing in the course of our evaluations, but none so much that the Super Duties needed to sweat. Indeed, the Fords' ability to remain cool under our extreme pressure, regardless of the circumstances, made it all the more clear they deserved this award.\nAdvancement in Design Design is inherently subjective, but there are many ways to objectively judge it. Is it cohesive? Do all the individual elements serve a purpose, and do they advance the design as a whole? Does the design separate the vehicle from the competition, and does it speak to its intended market? The Ford Super Duties answer all these questions in the affirmative.\nBy their utilitarian nature, trucks can be inherently hard to differentiate. Get too creative, and you risk impinging on the vehicle's ability to get the job done—and for the working professional, that's what matters at the end of the day. Clunky but proficient wins over gorgeous and inefficient. The Ford Super Duties strike this balance expertly, looking like no other truck on the road while keeping the customer mission front of mind. They are clearly and distinctly Ford Super Duties seen from afar, and the design doesn't break down the closer you look.\nAlthough the design is busy in places, an obvious vision has been executed. Every panel relates to the adjacent one, even around corners, and every line serves a purpose. Critically, the design as a whole advances the direction of the previous generation without losing or abandoning its signature. From every angle, there is no mistaking this truck for anything but a Ford.\nEfficiency Vehicles of this size—or, more specifically, this weight—are not rated by EPA. Fortunately, we have our own means of evaluating fuel efficiency thanks to our partners at Emissions Analytics.\nSubjected to our Real MPG testing regimen, the Ford Super Duties, in all configurations, handily outperformed the equivalent Ram trucks. Given the gas-powered F-250 weighs some 400 pounds less than the Ram 2500 with similar equipment, we expected an advantage and weren't surprised to see the Ford return 11.0/16.4/12.9 mpg city/highway/combined versus the Ram's 9.2/15./11.4.\nWe were far more impressed with the performance of the F-350 dual-rear-wheel diesel. Despite weighing in at 8,643 pounds—15 pounds heavier than the Ram 3500 dual-rear-wheel diesel—the F-350 returned an outstanding 16.3/20.5/18.0 mpg city/highway/combined. Excellent in its own right, the F-350's result is all the more impressive compared against the Ram 3500 dually's 13.3/17.3/14.8 result. Did we mention class-leading torque and towing/payload capability?\nThere are strong arguments to be made for technological advancement and environmental protection, but the Super Duties' efficiency will most resonate with customers at the pump. Given these trucks do more physical labor than any other class of non-commercial vehicle, the Super Duties' advantages in efficiency will be a boon to working professionals balancing costs with capability.\nEngineering Excellence Ford ads tout the Super Duty's class-leading 32,500-pound towing capacity. (Capabilities of the forthcoming Chevy Silverado HD had not been announced as of this writing.) That's impressive. Equally so is the also-class-leading 7,630-pound max payload capacity.\nWhat the ads don't tell you is how the truck actually behaves with 16 tons burdening the rear axle. With a class-leading 925 lb-ft of torque on tap, the F-350 Super Duty will begin rolling forward at idle when you release the brake—despite a gross combined vehicle weight of more than 40,000 pounds. That's simply stunning torque. Give it some throttle, and it's a strong, steady pull to freeway speeds. Braking from such speeds is handled with confidence thanks to a powerful exhaust brake, a well-calibrated Tow/Haul mode, and strong 14-inch rotors front and rear.\n\"With 30,000 pounds in tow, the F-350 was remarkably unfazed,\" Chris Walton said. \"Sure, there's a sense of weight behind, but not 15 tons. The engine pulled smoothly through the rev range, the transmission clicked off smooth, quick upshifts without surging, and when it came time to slow after the quarter mile, the Jake brake gave me so much compression braking that I felt extremely confident transitioning from off-throttle to gentle braking for the turnaround.\"\n© Motor Trend Staff 2017 Ford F 250 Lariat 4x4 and 2017 Ford F 350 Lariat 4x4 67L front end in motion 05 We had the luxury in this test of having the Super Duty's most direct competitor on hand, and it proved instructive. The Super Duties accelerated more quickly and smoothly than their Ram Heavy Duty rivals, braked comparably well, and handled better both on the skidpad and the figure eight. Towing at near max capability, the F-350 was quicker and smoother than the Ram 3500 and felt less burdened. In a trailering slalom test, the F-350 was able to carry considerably more speed than the Ram 3500 and experienced less body roll, increasing driver confidence. The same held true when comparing the gas-powered F-250 to the equivalent Ram 2500.\nOn the topic of the gasoline-powered trucks, the F-250's aluminum body helped it save 400 pounds relative to the Ram. The F-350 weighs more than the Ram 3500, which Ford attributes to the reinforcements necessary to tow 16 tons.\nThe Fords' advantage became inescapable as we transitioned to a real-world test—towing about 7,500 pounds of skid loader up the grueling Davis Dam grade. In a 3555-mph uphill passing test, both gasoline- and diesel-powered Ford models clobbered the equivalent Rams in both passing time and distance.\nOf course, no vehicle is perfect, and we'd be remiss if we didn't call out areas for improvement. The gasoline-powered F-250 goes light on the nose when towing uphill, which makes it prone to tramlining and requires more driver attentiveness. Also, on one occasion, the diesel-powered F-250 under cruise control gasped in the heat and failed to maintain its uphill speed despite having adequate power to do so. Finally, all three Ford Super Duty trucks were prone to moderate bump steer on especially bad pavement and expansion joints.\nPerformance of Intended Function \"I'm not sure I've ever evaluated a vehicle that hits this criterion so hard,\" Jonny Lieberman said. None of us argued. Ford has spent an enormous amount of time researching its customers' needs and wants and finding clever engineering solutions. We know from industry research that the vast majority of heavy-duty truck customers aren't weekend cowboys. Capability and usability are king, and Ford has delivered both.\nThe suite of work-focused technologies baked into the Super Duties was also highly impressive. Although most folks who drive heavy-duty trucks are everyday pros, we noticed the Ford assistance features best helped rookies and those rusty in trailering.\nHeavy-duty truck customers aren't weekend cowboys. Capability and usability are king. The ability to extend blind-spot detection to cover a trailer adds an important layer of safety, as does the ability to monitor six trailer tires' pressures and the trailer lights on the dashboard. Its 360-degree camera coverage greatly aides maneuvering in close quarters, as do forward- and rear-looking cameras. An additional camera mounted above the rear window, as well as the ability to zoom both this camera and the tailgate-mounted backup camera, makes connecting to a trailer a breeze for one person. A dash-mounted tailgate release saves time and effort when attaching a gooseneck or fifth wheel and when loading or unloading. The ability to add an additional wired backup camera to a trailer and display it on the center console is also helpful, as is the trailer-backing guidance with jackknife warning.\nJudges also gave the Super Duties high marks for the inclusion of four 25-amp and two 40-amp auxiliary switches, ready to be connected to power takeoffs and other equipment, and we appreciated the available 400-watt power inverter and two available 110-volt power outlets for charging tools, computers, and more.\nSafety The 2017 Ford Super Duties had not yet been crash tested by either the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. However, we expect them to perform well because of the strengthened frame.\nOf course, we prefer a vehicle that can avoid collisions in the first place. To increase your chances, Ford has added a number of features, including collision warning, automatic emergency braking, and trailer sway control. All those cameras increase low-speed safety, as does the blind-spot warning system, especially when extended to cover a trailer. Adaptive cruise control helps maintain safe distances both laden and unladen and maintains a set speed on hill descent, even while trailering.\nThe Super Duty's strong performance in the uphill passing-while-trailering test also indicated a measure of safety, as the trucks are able to more quickly remove themselves from an unsafe situation.\n© Motor Trend Staff 2017 Ford F 250 Lariat 4x4 and 2017 Ford F 350 Lariat 4x4 67L rear side\nValue Heavy-duty trucks are expensive. Regardless of make, they all start around $32,000, roughly the average price of a new vehicle in America. That doesn't seem so bad. But fully loaded—and if you are using a heavy-duty truck to its capacity, you tend to load up on options—the price more than doubles. Value, then, is not synonymous with price. Rather, it is relative to the competition.\nHere again, the Super Duty compares favorably. When matched with the only other equally capable truck on the market, the Super Duties are priced roughly the same or better than the equivalent Ram trim level—especially at higher trim levels. It's more than just dollars and cents, though. The Fords offer class-leading towing and hauling. They can also be equipped with a suite of trailering technologies Ram doesn't offer. In terms of content per dollar spent, the Super Duties are the clear class leaders.\nWinners As with any Of The Year competition, Truck of the Year is not a direct comparison test. Each truck is judged against our criteria, based on the class it competes in. The Ford F-250 and F-350 score remarkably well on all six—as well as against their direct competition. With its latest Super Duties, Ford has set new benchmarks for capability and functionality. We have no doubt the competition will race to meet Ford's new standard. Putting the competition on notice and forcing them to catch up is a hallmark of an Of The Year winner. Consider the bar raised.\nDodging Monsoons and haboobs: Behind the scenes at 2017 Truck of the Year testing | Follow MSN Autos on Facebook\n2017 Motor Trend Truck of the Year Contenders Nissan Titan Ram 2500/3500 HD Nissan Titan XD 2017 Truck of the Year Finalists Ford F-150 Honda Ridgeline 2017 Motor Trend Truck of the Year Introduction 2017 Ford F-250 Lariat 4x4 2017 Ford F-250 Platinum 4x4 6.7L 2017 Ford F-350 Lariat 4x4 6.7L POWERTRAIN/CHASSIS DRIVETRAIN LAYOUT Front-engine, 4WD Front-engine, 4WD Front-engine, 4WD ENGINE TYPE 90-deg V-8, iron block/alum heads Turbodiesel, 90-deg V-8, iron block/alum heads Turbodiesel, 90-deg V-8, iron block/alum heads VALVETRAIN SOHC, 2 valves/cyl OHV, 4 valves/cyl OHV, 4 valves/cyl DISPLACEMENT 379.0 cu in/6,210 cc 405.9 cu in/6,651 cc 405.9 cu in/6,651 cc COMPRESSION RATIO 9.8:1 16.2:1 16.2:1 POWER (SAE NET) 385 hp @ 5,750 rpm 440 hp @ 2,800 rpm 440 hp @ 2,800 rpm TORQUE (SAE NET) 430 lb-ft @ 3,800 rpm 925 lb-ft @ 1,800 rpm 925 lb-ft @ 1,800 rpm REDLINE 6,000 rpm 4,000 rpm 4,000 rpm WEIGHT TO POWER 18.4 lb/hp 18.0 lb/hp 19.6 lb/hp TRANSMISSION 6-speed automatic 6-speed automatic 6-speed automatic AXLE/FINAL-DRIVE RATIO 3.73:1/2.57:1 3.55:1/2.38:1 4.10:1/2.75:1 SUSPENSION, FRONT;

But the move frees up the Michigan Assembly Plant to build a new Ford Ranger pickup and also bring back the Ford Bronco SUV .\nFord CEO Mark Fields said everything is still on track for two new products to be built in Michigan, despite the Trump presidential win. The automaker sent a letter congratulating the president-elect and has been in constant communication with Trump's transition team.\n© Motor Trend Staff 2015 Ford Ranger Wildtrak Euro Spec front three quarter \"We have had conversations with the transition team,\" Fields said on the opening day of the Los Angeles Auto Show's media days. I've sent a congratulatory letter to the president-elect and we look forward to working with the new administration and the entire newly-elected Congress.\"\nHe warned that small car buyers and the U.S. economy in general would be penalized if Trump follows through on threats to impose a 35-percent tariff on made-in-Mexico vehicles. Meanwhile, Ford this week unveiled a version of the EcoSport subcompact crossover that will be sold in the U.S. in the first quarter of 2018. The new model will be imported from Chennai, India.\nFollow MSN Autos on Facebook\nGo to MSN Home",

      "text": "Ford CEO warns of 'huge impact' to economy from Trump trade plan - WRCBtv.com | Chattanooga News, Weather & Sports Member Center: Ford CEO warns of 'huge impact' to economy from Trump trade plans Posted: President-elect Donald Trump. AP photo \nBY PAUL A. EISENSTEIN, NBC News \n(NBC News) - Ford CEO Mark Fields warned that President-elect Donald Trump's proposed trade plans — which include a 35 percent tariff on motor vehicles imported from Mexico — would have a \"huge impact\" on the entire American economy, not just the auto industry. \nThough Fields said Ford has \"had conversations with the transition team\" for the incoming president, his comments, made during a keynote speech marking the opening of the 2016 Los Angeles Auto Show, could escalate a sometimes sharp dispute that began early during the election campaign. It was touched off by Ford's announcement it would shift small car production from U.S. plants to a new factory in Mexico. \n\"We've got to keep (factories) here. It's not that hard to do,\" then-candidate Trump said during one campaign interview, adding that if Ford and other makers continued to expand in Mexico, \"pretty soon all we're going to have is nursing home jobs.\" \nEarlier this year, Ford Chairman William Clay Ford Jr. met with Trump to discuss what the grandson of company founder Henry Ford describe as \"infuriating\" attacks. Ford executives stressed that they were replacing production of slow-selling small cars like the Focus with high-demand light truck models such as the F-150 pickup. \nThat failed to quell the dispute, the idea of tearing up trade deals such as NAFTA and a yet-unapproved trans-Pacific pact becoming a centerpiece of the Trump campaign. There have been some signs that the New York businessman might pull back from such tariffs, though with the transition process reportedly in turmoil it has become difficult to tell precisely where the next administration will position itself once in office. \n'Free Trade is a Must' \nFields used his keynote speech to send a message that aggressive anti-trade moves would be risky, telling reporters and industry officials gathered in downtown Los Angeles that, \"A tariff like that (Trump has proposed) could have a huge impact on the U.S. economy.\" \nFields tried to soften the tone of his comments, adding that there have been meetings with the transition team, and that, \"we look forward to working with a new administration and the entire newly elected Congress.\" \nBut free trade is a must for Ford, he added, Fields indicating that the second-largest U.S. automaker doesn't intend to back down from plans that it has, in the past, said are necessary to delivering an acceptable return on investment. \nIn fact, just hours before Fields delivered his morning keynote, Ford announced another move that could lead to further friction with Washington. The carmaker says it will begin selling a new entry-level SUV in the U.S. in 2018, with the little EcoSport coming off an assembly line in India. \nThat would mark the first time a major manufacturer has imported an Indian-made automobile, but others may follow — along with one of that country's biggest local producers, Mahinda & Mahindra. \nMeanwhile, two automakers have begun importing vehicles from China, Volvo moving first with a stretched version of its S60 sedan dubbed Inscription. General Motors followed recently with the launch of the Chinese-made Buick Envision utility vehicle. \nMexico in the Headlights \nBut Mexico, in particular, has been in the crosshairs for Donald Trump. The country has experienced explosive growth in its carmaking sector in recent years, becoming one of the five largest automotive manufacturing nations in the world. \nJust this week, Toyota broke ground for a new assembly plant in the state of Guanajuato that will produce the world's best-selling vehicle, the Corolla. New plants run by Kia, Audi and Nissan's Infiniti brand went into production in recent months. \nIndustry planners say that low wages are only a part of the appeal. They also point to the need to balance operations around the world, sometimes shifting production bases to both keep plants operating efficiently and holding down costs. \n\"The automotive business is truly global. So, to make this whole thing work, you have to have a relatively free flow of components and vehicles across borders,\" said Joe Phillippi, head of Auto Trends Consulting. \"It's how you keep the costs down.\" \nOther automotive insiders have begun weighing in, though cautiously, many worried about going on the record and getting off on a bad foot with the new administration. \n\"I am sure free and fair trade is a better way for all of us,\" said Ralf Speth, CEO of British-based Jaguar Land Rover. Though the German-born executive insisted he was not criticizing Trump, or any specific U.S. trade plans, he stressed his belief that trade barriers \"only make things more difficult and, at the end of the day, this takes buying power away from the people.\" ",

      "text": "Trump is Right on Trade, But He Doesn’t Know Why \nAsked about the consequences of renegotiating or pulling out of free trade agreements such as NAFTA -- something Trump has pledged to do -- Fields said Ford remains \"a big supporter of free and fair trade\" but added: \"We'll see how things play out.\" \nHis remarks echoed those made by BMW chief Harald Krueger in the wake of the real estate tycoon's surprise election last week. \nFields said of Trump, \"We look forward to working with him to consolidate the U.S. economy.\" \nFord will continue to advocate for policies on currency manipulation and fuel standards that are \"in line with market realities,\" as well as tax reform and \"the safe adoption of autonomous cars.\" \nDuring the bitter campaign for the White house, Trump criticized American companies for relocating production abroad. Computer giant Apple has been one of his main targets. \nFord in early April unveiled a $1.6 billion investment in a new facility in Mexico, where the workforce is very cheap compared to the United States. The plant will be operational in 2018. \nCar companies that move U.S. factories offshore have become a frequent target of politicians and local elected officials, not least because General Motors and Chrysler -- although not Ford -- were saved from bankruptcy in 2009 with a government bailout. \nJessica Caldwell, an analyst at the Edmunds.com automotive website, the most immediate challenge created by a Trump administration, even more so than the renegotiation of international trade agreements, is to question government subsidies on electric cars. \nTrump, who has denied the existence of climate change in the past, suggested during his campaign that he would close the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and his government may decide to eliminate federal incentives for the purchase green cars. \n\"The big concern now is the government subsidies for green cars,\" she says, adding that the manufacturers have spent tens of millions of dollars to reduce gasoline consumption and polluting emissions. \nCopyright Agence France-Presse, 2016",

      "title": "Ford: Jenkins balances football, social politics",
      "text": "Ford: Jenkins balances football, social politics Updated: November 16, 2016 — 5:58 PM EST Share Bob Ford INQUIRER COLUMNIST \nBob Ford is an award-winning sports columnist for the Inquirer. He is a four-time Pennsylvania Sportswriter of the Year, as selected by the National Sportscasters and Sportswriters Association. His work has been cited numerous times by Associated Press Sports Editors judges, and he won an Eclipse Award for outstanding coverage of horse racing. Prior to becoming a columnist at the Inquirer, Ford was the 76ers beat writer for six seasons and then a general assignment feature writer with a specialty in Olympic sports. In 1995, he was designated a fellow of the Knight Center for Specialized Journalism. Ford has written sports in the Philadelphia area since 1981, when he served as the Phillies beat writer and later as a general sports columnist for the Delaware County Daily Times. More by Bob Ford Nov 13 \nMalcolm Jenkins looked around for a moment on Tuesday during one of the meetings he and four other NFL players had with members of Congress on the subject of race relations in this country, and it struck him that this has been sort of a different year for him, and that he might be different now as well. Why the Eagles-Seahawks game is on CBS, not Fox \n\"Sitting on Capitol Hill and I'm thinking, 'Yeah, if you had asked me in high school if I would be here saying the kind of stuff I'm saying, the answer would be no.' But it's funny how life works,\" Jenkins, the Eagles starting safety, said after practice on Wednesday. \nThrough those years at Piscataway High, through Ohio State and then seven previous seasons in the NFL, Jenkins was always respected, but he never turned himself into the nail that sticks up as he has this season. He added his voice, and the action of raising a fist during the national anthem, to the voices of others who have protested the state of race relations, and particularly recent confrontations between police and the African American community. \nAgree or disagree with the politics of the matter, there's nothing easy about being the only one and that is what Jenkins chose. Since cornerback Ron Brooks was lost to injury, Jenkins is the lone protester before games. He always makes a point to shake hands with whatever color guard or military veterans are part of the pregame ceremony, but he also makes his own point. \nThis is all a departure for Jenkins, different from any other year in the NFL. \n\"Any other year in my life ,\" he said. \"I am [comfortable], as much as this is an unknown realm for me. I'm learning as I go. I'm reading, I'm listening. When I have any doubt, it's usually followed by reassurance that I'm doing the right thing, whether someone encouraging me or an opportunity to speak up. I understand that, whatever track this is, I'm on the right one.\" Poll Who should be the Eagles’ No. 1 running back? Darren Sproles. Small but explosive. Ryan Mathews. Big and back on track. Wendell Smallwood. Give the new guy a chance. Vote Results \nThe opportunity Tuesday was organized by Detroit wide receiver Anquon Bolden. The five players met with both Democratic and Republican members of Congress, including Keith Ellison, the representative from Minnesota in line to become the next Democratic National Committee chair. \n\"He was the most engaged talking about criminal justice reform, and the relations between community and police, as well as race relations. It was a really good conversation,\" Jenkins said. \"I'm sure he's someone we'll continue to reach out to for advice and guidance. Overall, everything was supportive and you want to hear just that they're willing to work with us.\" \nJenkins has made his decisions, pursued his beliefs and spoken by his actions during the stress and pressure of an NFL season. He's been playing at an extremely high level as he and safety Rodney McLeod hold together the defensive backfield. Jenkins is second on the team (to McLeod) with 43 solo tackles and 61 total tackles. If he worried that his play had to back him up this season, it hasn't showed. \n\"Early, I did,\" Jenkins said. \"Especially with the protest, because that's all that was happening then, you know there are people that are just waiting for you to not play well and say that you're distracted. It was on my mind early in the season, but as time went on, I'm pretty secure in my stances and that, regardless of what happens on the field, I know I'm doing the right thing. So, I don't think about it that much.\" \nNeither do his teammates, although they have let him remain that vocal loner. \n\"Jenks is a guy who's very strong in his convictions, very strong in who he is as an individual, and it's hard to do that and be controversial,\" center Jason Kelce said. \"He does a good job of keeping [politics] out of the locker room. Not everybody's going to agree with everybody else. In the football world, so many guys come from so many walks of life, that you have every single viewpoint in a locker room. As a football player, you try to leave that stuff at the door. But he is strong about what he believes in and he's like that as a teammate. He doesn't' accept anything but the best from every one of us, and that's what makes him a great leader.\" \nJenkins went to Washington on Tuesday, but was back at work on Wednesday. He said he and the whole team are focused on beating the Seattle Seahawks. That's his day job and he takes it very seriously, but he takes other things seriously as well. He wants to change the country for the better and, again, agree or disagree, that's difficult to criticize as a goal. \n\"It was an opportunity for us to be heard, but also an opportunity for us to listen and learn how the process works,\" Jenkins said. \"It was a full day. We got a lot of information and left feeling pretty optimistic and well-informed.\" \nThis has been a journey for Malcolm Jenkins and some of it has surprised him. Stepping out has opened his eyes, even as he has tried to open the eyes of others. Nobody knows what happens next – particularly nobody in Washington – but Jenkins is sure that what has happened with him so far this year has been right. \n@bobfordsports",

The EcoSport has long been rumored as a vehicle the automaker would eventually bring to the U.S. as fuel economy standards get tougher and the popularity of small crossovers continues to grow. \nThe Dearborn automaker also said the EcoSport is part of four all-new SUVs it plans to launch globally over the next four years. Due up for redesigns are the Ford Explorer, Ford Escape and the return of the Ford Bronco, a nameplate the automaker plans to revive in 2018 . ",

      "text": "Ford CEO warns of big impact from Trump's proposed tariff Keith Naughton and Jamie Butters, (c) 2016, Bloomberg (c) 2016, Bloomberg \nPresident-elect Donald J. Trump's proposal to levy a 35 percent tariff on cars made in Mexico would hurt the U.S. economy, according to the head of Ford Motor Co. -- the target of the future president's tariff talk. \n\"A tariff like that would be imposed on the entire auto sector and that could have a huge impact on the U.S. economy,\" Mark Fields, Ford's chief executive officer, told reporters following a speech at the AutoMobility conference in Los Angeles. Ford favors \"free and fair trade.\" \nTrump has criticized Ford for planning to move all its North American small-car production to Mexico, where wages are 80 percent lower than in the U.S. During the campaign, he threatened to slap Ford's Mexican-built cars with a 35 percent tariff. He also said he would terminate the North American Free Trade Agreement, which lets goods flow between Mexico, the U.S. and Canada without tariffs. \nFields said that the company has been in touch with Trump's transition team and that he sent a congratulatory letter to the president-elect. \n\"I continue to be convinced that the right policies will prevail, because I think we all share the same objective, which is a healthy and vibrant U.S. economy,\" Fields said. \"We expect to work very effectively and positively with the president-elect's administration as well as the new Congress.\" \nDuring the presidential campaign, Ford pushed back on Trump's assertions that the company was moving jobs to Mexico. The Wayne, Michigan, factory losing the Focus small car and C-Max hybrid will get new production of a Ranger pickup and revived Bronco sport utility vehicle, people familiar with the plans have said. Ford has said no jobs will be lost at the Michigan plant. \nFord Executive Chairman Bill Ford, great-grandson of the company's founder, even met with Trump, but the candidate's criticism of the automaker continued. \n\"We are everything that he should be celebrating about this country,\" Bill Ford said in September. \nFields said Tuesday at the conference, which is the kickoff to the Los Angeles Auto Show, that company officials have talked to Trump's transition team and expect to be able to work with him as president. \n\"We look forward to working with the new administration and the entire newly elected Congress,\" Fields said. \"We're in constant communication.\" ",

      "text": "by George Washington - Nov 15, 2016 11:14 PM \nDid You Know ... by TDB - Nov 16, 2016 1:06 PM \nTrump would do well to push back against this propaganda before it becomes entrenched. Ford CEO Blasts \"Huge Impact\" Of Automotive Import Tariffs Nov 16, 2016 6:30 PM 0 SHARES \nIt is quite clear, at this point, that Trump's election victory was almost entirely due to support he received from unemployed auto workers in PA, OH, MI and WI, many of whom suffered the devastating consequences of their jobs being exported to Mexico. During the campaigning cycle, many questioned Trump's decision to repeatedly get on stage and blast auto executives for shipping jobs out of the US but, in hindsight, clearly it worked very well. \n\nAnd while most auto executives probably took some comfort from Hillary's \"lead\" in the polls heading into election day, they're now terrified that Trump will follow through on a pledge to impose a 35% tariff on imported vehicles. With capital investments already made in foreign countries and U.S. capacity shuttered, there is little that domestic auto OEMs can do in the short-term to offset such massive penalties. Ford CEO warns of \"huge impact\" to economy from President-elect Trump's trade plans following his election https://t.co/u5nUQSWzgH pic.twitter.com/8awconIcNJ \n— NBC News (@NBCNews) November 16, 2016 \n\nJust yesterday Ford CEO, Mark Fields, delivered a stark warning to the Trump administration from the Los Angeles Auto Show that a 35% tariff on auto imports would have a \"huge impact\" on not just Ford but the overall economy. While acknowledging that he looks forward to \" working with a new administration and the entire newly elected Congress,\" Fields also highlighted new plans to manufacture and import their EcoSport SUV from India starting in 2018...a move that the Trump administration may not appreciate so much. \nFord CEO Mark Fields warned that President-elect Donald Trump's proposed trade plans — which include a 35 percent tariff on motor vehicles imported from Mexico — would have a \"huge impact\" on the entire American economy , not just the auto industry. \n\nThough Fields said Ford has \"had conversations with the transition team\" for the incoming president, his comments, made during a keynote speech marking the opening of the 2016 Los Angeles Auto Show, could escalate a sometimes sharp dispute that began early during the election campaign. It was touched off by Ford's announcement it would shift small car production from U.S. plants to a new factory in Mexico. \n\nFields used his keynote speech to send a message that aggressive anti-trade moves would be risky, telling reporters and industry officials gathered in downtown Los Angeles that, \"A tariff like that (Trump has proposed) could have a huge impact on the U.S. economy.\" \n\nFields tried to soften the tone of his comments, adding that there have been meetings with the transition team, and that, \"we look forward to working with a new administration and the entire newly elected Congress.\" \n\nBut free trade is a must for Ford, he added, Fields indicating that the second-largest U.S. automaker doesn't intend to back down from plans that it has, in the past, said are necessary to delivering an acceptable return on investment. \n\nIn fact, just hours before Fields delivered his morning keynote, Ford announced another move that could lead to further friction with Washington. The carmaker says it will begin selling a new entry-level SUV in the U.S. in 2018, with the little EcoSport coming off an assembly line in India. \nWhile auto executives have attempted to downplay the fact that wages are the primary appeal of moving plants to low-cost areas like Mexico... \nIndustry planners say that low wages are only a part of the appeal. They also point to the need to balance operations around the world , sometimes shifting production bases to both keep plants operating efficiently and holding down costs. \n\n\"The automotive business is truly global. S o, to make this whole thing work, you have to have a relatively free flow of components and vehicles across borders, \" said Joe Phillippi, head of Auto Trends Consulting. \"It's how you keep the costs down.\" \n...the facts are somewhat difficult to dispute. \n\nIt certainly seems as though this is setting up to be one of the more epic battles of the Trump presidency. While we certainly understand the importance of restoring jobs in the United States, we are also acutely aware of the need of companies like Ford to earn a reasonable return on invested capital for their shareholders while competing in a global market. To that end, it will be interesting to see whether/how the United Auto Workers and their unreasonably excessive contracts will play into negotiations. \nAnd here is Ford CEO, Mark Fields, discussing trade with Bloomberg earlier today (fast forward to the 6:20 mark for the discussion on trade).",

      "text": "Ford CEO warns of proposed tariff effects BLADE NEWS SERVICES Print \nPresident-elect Donald Trump’s proposal to levy a 35 percent tariff on cars made in Mexico would hurt the U.S. economy, according to the head of Ford Motor Co . — the target of the future president’s tariff talk. \nFord CEO and President Mark Fields says that the company has been in touch with President-elect Donald Trump and congratulated him. \nASSOCIATED PRESS Enlarge \n“A tariff like that would be imposed on the entire auto sector and that could have a huge impact on the U.S. economy,” Mark Fields, Ford’s chief executive officer, told reporters following a speech at the AutoMobility conference in Los Angeles. \nMr. Trump has criticized Ford Motor for planning to move all its North American small-car production to Mexico, where wages are 80 percent lower than in the United States. During the campaign, he threatened to slap Ford’s Mexican-built cars with a 35 percent tariff. He also said he would terminate the North American Free Trade Agreement, which lets goods flow between Mexico, the United States, and Canada without tariffs. \nMr. Fields said that the company has been in touch with Mr. Trump’s transition team and that he sent a congratulatory letter to the president-elect. \nFord Chairman Bill Ford Jr. said last month he met with Mr. Trump. Mr. Ford has countered Mr. Trump’s criticism, saying the company, founded by his great-grandfather, makes more cars and trucks in the United States than any other automaker. \nMr. Fields also said that with U.S. gasoline prices so low, “it’s very difficult for us to be able to make money on a vehicle produced in the U.S.” in the small car segment. If Ford decided to build the Focus small car line in the United States, and had to raise the price, “we wouldn’t sell the vehicle.” \nA group that represents Ford and other major automakers in the United States has asked the Trump transition team to review and consider easing the Obama Administration’s fuel economy standards, which call for automakers to more than double the fuel efficiency of their fleets to 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025. \nDuring the presidential campaign, Ford pushed back on Mr. Trump’s assertions that the company was moving jobs to Mexico. The Wayne, Mich., factory losing the Focus small car and C-Max hybrid will get new production of a Ranger pickup and revived Bronco sport utility vehicle, people familiar with the plans have said. Ford has said no jobs will be lost at the Michigan plant. Related Items:",

      "text": "It is quite clear, at this point, that Trump's election victory was almost entirely due to support he received from unemployed auto workers in PA, OH, MI and WI, many of whom suffered the devastating consequences of their jobs being exported to Mexico. During the campaigning cycle, many questioned Trump's decision to repeatedly get on stage and blast auto executives for shipping jobs out of the US but, in hindsight, clearly it worked very well. \n\n\nAnd while most auto executives probably took some comfort from Hillary's \"lead\" in the polls heading into election day, they're now terrified that Trump will follow through on a pledge to impose a 35% tariff on imported vehicles. With capital investments already made in foreign countries and U.S. capacity shuttered, there is little that domestic auto OEMs can do in the short-term to offset such massive penalties.\n\n\n\nFord CEO warns of \"huge impact\" to economy from President-elect Trump's trade plans following his election https://t.co/u5nUQSWzgH pic.twitter.com/8awconIcNJ\n\n— NBC News (@NBCNews) November 16, 2016\n\n\n\n\nJust yesterday Ford CEO, Mark Fields, delivered a stark warning to the Trump administration from the Los Angeles Auto Show that a 35% tariff on auto imports would have a *\"huge impact\" on not just Ford but the overall economy.* While acknowledging that he looks forward to \"*working with a new administration and the entire newly elected Congress,\"* Fields also highlighted new plans to manufacture and import their EcoSport SUV from India starting in 2018...a move that the Trump administration may not appreciate so much.\n\n\n\nFord CEO Mark Fields warned that President-elect Donald Trump 's proposed trade plans — which include a 35 percent tariff on motor vehicles imported from Mexico — *would have a \"huge impact\" on the entire American economy*, not just the auto industry.\n\n\nThough Fields said Ford has *\"had conversations with the transition team \"* for the incoming president, his comments, made during a keynote speech marking the opening of the 2016 Los Angeles Auto Show, *could escalate a sometimes sharp dispute that began early during the election campaign.* It was touched off by Ford's announcement it would shift small car production from U.S. plants to a new factory in Mexico.\n\n\nFields used his keynote speech to send a message that aggressive anti-trade moves would be risky, telling reporters and industry officials gathered in downtown Los Angeles that, *\"A tariff like that (Trump has proposed) could have a huge impact on the U.S. economy.\"*\n\n\nFields tried to soften the tone of his comments, adding that there have been meetings with the transition team, and that, *\"we look forward to working with a new administration and the entire newly elected Congress.\"*\n\n\n*But free trade is a must for Ford, he added, Fields indicating that the second-largest U.S. automaker doesn't intend to back down from plans that it has, in the past, said are necessary to delivering an acceptable return on investment.*\n\n\nIn fact, just hours before Fields delivered his morning keynote, Ford announced another move that could lead to further friction with Washington. *The carmaker says it will begin selling a new entry-level SUV in the U.S. in 2018, with the little EcoSport coming off an assembly line in India. *\n\n\n\nWhile auto executives have attempted to downplay the fact that wages are the primary appeal of moving plants to low-cost areas like Mexico...\n\n\n\n*Industry planners say that low wages are only a part of the appeal.* They also point to the *need to balance operations around the world*, sometimes shifting production bases to both keep plants operating efficiently and holding down costs.\n\n\n\"The automotive business is truly global. S*o, to make this whole thing work, you have to have a relatively free flow of components and vehicles across borders,*\" said Joe Phillippi, head of Auto Trends Consulting. *\"It's how you keep the costs down.\" *\n\n\n\n...the facts are somewhat difficult to dispute.\n\n\nIt certainly seems as though this is setting up to be one of the more epic battles of the Trump presidency . *While we certainly understand the importance of restoring jobs in the United States , we are also acutely aware of the need of companies like Ford to earn a reasonable return on invested capital for their shareholders while competing in a global market.* To that end, it will be interesting to see whether/how the United Auto Workers and their unreasonably excessive contracts will play into negotiations.\n\nAnd here is Ford CEO, Mark Fields, discussing trade with Bloomberg earlier today (fast forward to the 6:20 mark for the discussion on trade).",

BROWN, AFP/Getty Images) \nLOS ANGELES — Ford is moving fast to seize opportunities with cities to reduce traffic congestion in cities as it strives toward becoming a mobility company. \nThe Dearborn automaker and businessman Michael Bloomberg reached an agreement to work together less than a month after the former New York mayor announced the creation of a new philanthropic organization that will help cities prepare for self-driving cars and how best to use them to address city challenges. \nThe initiative was initially announced by Bloomberg Philanthropies and the Washington, D.C.-based Aspen Institute in October. \nOn Tuesday, Fields announced that Ford would join forces with Bloomberg Philanthropies. \n\"We’re discussing how we can work together to help create the city of tomorrow, incubating ideas around mobility and to accelerate solutions in cities,\" Fields said during his keynote speech at the Los Angeles Auto Show. \"Working with Bloomberg, we will collect the best ideas from around the world and put them into action.\" \nLater, Ford told the Free Press that the partnership came together in a matter of weeks. \n\"When the announcement came out from Bloomberg…our City Solutions Group immediately reached out,\" Fields said. \"That’s the benefit of having a team, this Ford City Solutions Group, that is living and working and eating this stuff 24/7.\" \nFord's City Solutions team was created to work with cities and study their transportation needs and to figure out how the self-driving cars, ride-sharing services and shuttle services can interact with more traditional mass transit systems. \nThe idea is to create better links between the vehicles the automotive industry produces, the services automakers can provide and transportation services. \nThe City Solutions team is just one part of a Ford Smart Mobility, a division Ford created earlier this year to oversee its mobility and autonomous vehicle development efforts. \nJust six months ago, industry observers were saying Ford was moving slower than its competitors to develop self-driving vehicles and get involved in the emerging ride-sharing industry with companies like Uber and Lyft. \nBut after several acquisitions, Ford's declaration it will launch an autonomous car by 2020, Fields said that skepticism is dying down. \n\"We are just going through a very disciplined process of where to play, how to win and then what capabilities do we think we need,\" Fields said. \"From our standpoint, as you know, we are not in a race to make announcements. We want to do what’s right for the business and what’s right for the customers.\" CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2g0gcPT Find New & Used Cars",

      "text": "Top 5 \n\nNo. 48 Jimmie Johnson : Johnson has never won at Homestead, but he is one of the greatest drivers in NASCAR history and he is on the verge or reeling-in his record-tying seventh championship. It is be difficult to pick against him. \nNo. 18 Kyle Busch : Busch dominated the 2013 race at Homestead and won at the track last year. He is a great option as he races to repeat as series champ. \nNo. 22 Joey Logano : Logano has been terrific on 1.5 mile tracks lately. He led 178 laps at Texas and finished third at Kansas. He will be very, very fast once again. \nNo. 19 Carl Edwards : Edwards has visited victory lane twice at Homestead. He is a great choice this weekend. \nNo. 4 Kevin Harvick : Harvick won at Homestead in 2014 and finished second last year. He is one of the favorites again this visit to South Florida. \n\n6 to 10 \n\nNo. 78 Martin Truex Jr. : Truex Jr. has been very good at Homestead during his career and is a great pick to win this weekend. \nNo. 20 Matt Kenseth : Kenseth has four top 10 finishes in the past five races at Homestead. He is a very nice choice. \nNo. 11 Denny Hamlin : Hamlin has finished in the top four in four of the past 10 races at Homestead, including wins in 2013 and 2009. We like his chances. \nNo. 2 Brad Keselowski : Keselowski finished third and led the most laps at Homestead last year. \nNo. 24 Chase Elliott : Elliott is making his Cup debut at Homestead this weekend. He won’t have any issue with the track and should easily crack the top 15. \n\n11 to 20 \n\nNo. 41 Kurt Busch : Busch has four top five finishes in 15 career starts at Homestead, including a win in 2004. He should finish inside the top 15 this weekend. \nNo. 31 Ryan Newman : Newman has been great at Homestead in four of the last six years. He is a nice value pick. \nNo. 88 Alex Bowman : We love how Bowman drove for most last weekend’s race at Phoenix. He is a great third or fourth driver this weekend. \nNo. 42 Kyle Larson : Larson notched a fifth place finish at Homestead last year. He should be in the top 15 again. \nNo. 3 Austin Dillon : Dillon finished 14 th at Homestead last year. He will take the checkers around the same spot this visit. \nNo. 14 Tony Stewart : Smoke fires up his engine for the final time this weekend. It will be sad to see him drive off into the Florida sunset at the end of the race but we have a feeling it won’t be the last time we ever see him behind the wheel of NASCAR. He has averaged a 23 rd place finish at Homestead the last four races and will be doing well to notch a top 20 finish. \nNo. 5 Kasey Kahne : Kahne has four top 10 finishes in 12 career starts at Homestead. He is just an okay pick. \nNo. 16 Greg Biffle : Biffle has won three of the past 12 Homestead races. This weekend is a rare time to sneak the No. 16 onto your roster this season. \nNo. 27 Paul Menard : Menard finished fourth in 2014 and 11 th at Homestead in 2012. He is a sleeper pick. \nNo. 1 Jamie McMurray : McMurray has notched top 13 finishes at Homestead the past two years. He is a nice sleeper choice for those in deep leagues.",

      "text": "AUTOMOTIVE NEWS EUROPE MONTHLY MAGAZINE PSA execs say net pricing gaps with VW, Ford, others closing faster than expected PSA Europe boss Maxime Picat says the Peugeot 3008 is better in net pricing than the new VW Tiguan and BMW X1. Automotive News Europe November 16, 2016 06:01 CET \nPSA Group executives say that the net pricing gaps between Peugeot, Citroen and DS Automobiles and their benchmarked rivals are closing faster than planned. Peugeot was almost on par with the Volkswagen brand in terms of net pricing in Europe in the first half, company figures show. By the end of June, Citroen brand had already reached its full-year net pricing target on its new benchmark: Ford. Even the slow-selling DS near-premium brand is narrowing its gap on Audi faster than planned. \nPSA's new Europe boss, Maxime Picat, who led the Peugeot brand until his recent promotion, said that numerous internal comparison tests have shown that Peugeot is already beating VW in the key compact SUV segment. \"Our new 3008 is better [in net pricing] than the new Tiguan and better than the BMW X1 as well,\" he told Automotive News Europe sister publication Automobilwoche . \nPSA is also showing more confidence in its price setting. The most expensive variant of the 3008, the GT diesel, starts at 39,700 euros in Germany. The price range for VW's top trim level for the Tiguan is 33,975 to 42,700 euros in Germany. \nPicat said one key reason the gap narrowed is because the brands Peugeot and DS benchmark for pricing, VW and Audi, had been using incentives to maintain volumes at the height of VW Group’s emissions-cheating scandal. In spring, however, the brands stabilized their incentive spending, Picat said. \nWhile PSA does not officially confirm the benchmarks for each of its brands, it also doesn't deny the names of the brands previously mentioned in this story. Automotive News Europe has also learned that PSA changed its benchmark for Citroen to Ford from Renault. The reason for the change was high volatility in Renault's net pricing in Europe, sources told ANE . \nPricing discipline in Europe has helped to make PSA one of the best-performing automakers in world. PSA CEO Carlos Tavares told Automotive News Europe that the automaker ranked fourth globally in terms of operating margin in the first half. PSA reported a 6.8 percent margin for its automotive operations in the January-June period, compared with a 4 percent target set for the full year and 5 percent achieved in 2015. \"We continue to be disciplined in pricing, because performance matters more than size,\" Tavares said on the sidelines of the Paris auto show in September. \nPSA's European sales grew by 7.4 percent to 1,056,000 units in the first half. Overall, PSA's first-half sales were flat at 1.54 million units largely because of a near 20 percent decline in its volume in China and Southeast Asia.

      "text": "print \nDETROIT (AP) — Ford Motor Co. CEO Mark Fields says the presidential election won't change the company's plans to move small car production to Mexico. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump has repeatedly criticized Ford for moving production to Mexico. Trump wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and has called for a 35-percent tariff on goods shipped from Mexico. \nIn an interview with CNBC Tuesday, Fields said Ford is proceeding with its plan to move Focus car production from Michigan to a new plant in Mexico by 2018. He stressed that no jobs will be lost, since the Michigan plant will make two other vehicles. \nFields also warned that a tariff would affect the entire industry — and autoworkers' profit-sharing checks — since many companies sell Mexican- and Canadian-made vehicles or parts.

      "text": "2012 Ford F-250 Grand Slam An Out-of-the-Park ’12 Ford Super Duty   44 Photos Some guys build trucks for a living, pumping out more project vehicles than even they can keep track of. Knowing the right people and having the right hookups, they are the guys the newbies look up to. They are the industry leaders, the trendsetters who get business done—fast. They won't be caught driving the same truck for more than a year. They hit the show circuit hard, with eyes on the Best Of trophies—and for good reason. Their builds kick ass. Buy, build, sell. Buy, build, sell. Being the \"big fish\" in the pond is impressive and exhausting. For every one of these guys, there are thousands of others who work their tails off to build one truck, piece by piece, over the course of many years and who have no intention of selling or building another. Out of enthusiasm, passion, and hard work, these \"small fish\" build killer rides. They dream big, set goals, and plan accordingly to humbly and graciously make their mark on the truck hobby they love. One of these guys is Casey King of Odessa, Texas, who has transformed his ’12 Ford F-250 Super Duty into something we all wouldn't mind cruising around in for a few days, years, or, let's be honest—indefinitely. The enviable F-250 on these pages was a high school graduation gift to King from his parents. (Note that he has since taken over payments of the beast.) He had been looking for something in the ½-ton category, like a new F-150 to replace the one he had been driving. But, like we all know too well, once you glance at an HD truck like a Super Duty, there's no going back. Perceptive to their son's growing infatuation with the ¾-ton beauty, King’s parents insisted on the big boy, with the understanding that any mods would be out of King’s pocket. By working for a lawn mowing company while he was in high school—before he even had a driver’s license—King had some money saved up. He also had a growing wish list for the would-be truck. Eventually, King jumped at the opportunity to buy the lawn mowing service, while he was still in high school! The purchase was made, and King found himself cruising in a brand-new Tuxedo Black Super Duty, using it to tow his trailer full of lawn mowers, as well as a water trailer. One of his first mods was a set of Ranch Hand bumpers. He started attending Texas Tech University. He sold the lawn business and switched to the oil field industry while he completed his college education. It was during this time that the truck transformation took place. Having his plate full with school and work, King enlisted the guys at Complete Customs to customize the F-250 to his standards. Several visits were necessary, as the build escalated from a leveling kit to an all-out show truck. After three sets of wheels and several years, King finally felt he had hit the jackpot with the current version of his Blue Oval. A walk around the truck leaves an eyebrow-raising impression thanks to the bumpers, grille, headlights, lightbars, badges, hooks, wheels, and tires. The in-your-face Road Armor Titan II front bumper houses 20- and 30-inch Trux Tech lightbars and protects an RBP RX-3 grille and Gold Standard Lighting custom headlights. Red F-250 badges add some accent color to the vast black canvas, as do an array of front and rear Monster Hooks products. Wrapped in massive 37-inch Interco tires, the 22-inch American Force Blade SS 8 wheels were painted by TC Customz; the black and red add tasteful style points. The exterior mods would look amiss were it not for the sleek-looking 6-inch Icon Vehicle Dynamics lift, complete with shiny remote-reservoir piggback shocks and complemented by PMF traction bars and an Icon steering stabilizer to keep the heavy truck road-worthy and controllable. Amp Research retractable steps makes entry and egress a breeze, and really, every lifted truck on 37s needs steps. As the 6.7L Power Stroke diesel puts plenty of power and torque to the ground, engine mods were kept modest with an S&B cold-air intake, H&S MiniMaxx tuner, and Flo-Pro exhaust. Likewise, interior mods were kept clean and classy, with a hydro-dipped carbon-fiber dash, Pioneer screen, a pair of 10-inch Memphis Car Audio subs, and WeatherTech floormats. King graduated from Texas Tech University and now has a Bachelor of Arts degree to go along with a fine looking ride. Having left behind his lawn mowing company and oil field job, he's settled into a rewarding career and still has his whole life ahead of him. Some kids squander the gifts they've been given—both the material gifts like the truck and the immaterial gifts like perseverance, dedication, and support. Others, like King, make the best of them and reap the rewards.   44 Photos Photo 2/44 | Casey King F250 Front End The front end get its menacing look from a trio of 50-, 30-, and 20-inch Trux Tech LED Lighting lightbars, an RBP RX-3 grille, and four Trux Tech LED pods and two Monster Hooks swivel hooks in the Road Armor Titan II bumper. There’s one more piece that makes the front end “pop,” so seamlessly integrated that it may go unnoticed: the Gold Standard Lighting custom headlights. Photo 3/44 | Casey King F250 Engine King never expected to be the proud owner of a 6.7L Power Stroke diesel, but he sure wasn’t going to turn down the opportunity. The dirt- and dust-free engine compartment sports an S&B cold-air intake and the trademark blue of Sinister Diesel products.   44 Photos Photo 4/44 | Casey King F250 Wheel Tire The Super Duty’s rear wheelwells swallow the massive 22x14 American Force Blade SS 8 wheels wrapped in 37X13.5R22 Interco SS-M16 tires. The wheels, custom-painted by TC Customz, tie together the black from the truck’s body with the red accent color seen elsewhere on the truck—including the Complete Customs brake caliper covers sneaking out from behind the wheel. Photo 5/44 | Casey King F250 Suspension Up, up, and away! Like so many other builds, King’s Super Duty went from stock to leveled before settling into its current height. Complete Customs installed the red powdercoated Icon Vehicle Dynamics 6-inch lift with those oh-so-pretty shocks stuffed under the wheelwells. Photo 6/44 | Casey King F250 Rear I spy a bunch of aftermarket details on the tail of King’s Super Duty: a custom Ford logo, Recon taillights and a third brake light, a Road Armor bumper with Rigid Industries reverse lights, Monster Hooks hook and two swivel hooks, Mag-Hytec differential cover, and an RBP exhaust tip. Photo 7/44 | Casey King F250 Headlight There’s a big difference between the Super Duty’s factory headlights and the final version from Gold Standard Lighting.

The No. 88 JR Motorsports Chevrolet has 10 starts on tracks measuring 1.5-miles in length this season, where the team earned seven top-10 finishes and an average finish of 13.7.-JR Motorsports Nov 16 - 11:26 PM Alex Bowman won his first career pole prior to the Can-Am 500 at Phoenix International Raceway and led the most laps, but a late-race incident cost him a shot at Victory Lane; he finished 6th Bowman had the type of run he needs in order to catch the eye of an owner for the 2017 season; he is without a ride once Dale Earnhardt Jr. returns to the cockpit for Daytona. While he has shown speed, he lacks consistency and that could limit his appeal for a team looking to build a program versus one that already has fast cars. Bowman led 194 of the 312 laps on Sunday. Nov 13 - 7:54 PM In his 80th start, Alex Bowman earned the first pole of his career with a lap of 140.521 mph and will lead the Can-Am 500k field to the green on Sunday at Phoenix International Raceway. This is only Bowman’s fourth top-10 start. All three previous high water marks came this year in the No. 88. Bowman sat on the outside pole for the Bank of America 500, but crashed and finished 39th. The next week, he fared better with a fifth-place start and seventh-place finish. Nov 11 - 7:43 PM In addition to driving the No. 88 Nationwide Chevrolet SS in Sunday's Sprint Cup Series Cup Can-Am 500(k) at Phoenix Int’l Raceway, Alex Bowman will be back behind the wheel of the JR Motorsports No. 88 Hughes General Contractors Chevrolet Camaro in the NASCAR XFINITY Series (NXS) Ticket Galaxy 200 on Saturday afternoon. Phoenix serves as the Arizona native’s home track, where he has four previous NXS starts. His best start of fifth came in 2014 and he earned his best finish of 11th in 2013. This weekend marks Bowman’s eighth race for JR Motorsports in 2016, with his final race taking place in Homestead next week. He has captured three top-five and seven top-10 finishes this season.-JRM Nov 9 - 2:21 PM",

      "text": "“A tariff like that ... could have a huge impact on the U.S. economy,” Ford’s Mark Fields said. (Photo: Frederic J. Brown / / Getty Images) \nThe presidential campaign is over, and hopefully the flirtation with trade protectionism has ended as well. The new Trump administration will not be able to deliver on its promise of a reinvigorated economy if it also sticks to its pledge to curtail trade. \nThat was the message Ford Motor Co. CEO Mark Fields delivered at the Los Angeles Auto Show this week.\nFord Motor was a favorite whipping boy of Donald Trump on the campaign trail. As a candidate, Trump blistered the automaker for moving car production to Mexico.\nSpecifically, he targeted Ford for shifting assembly of the Ford Focus and C-Max hybrid models to that country.\nBut as Fields said then, the reality of labor contracts with the United Auto Workers union and federal emissions and fuel economy rules make profitably producing small cars in this country nearly impossible.\nFields pointed out that the Wayne plant whose production is moving south of the border will soon be transitioned to building the new Ford Ranger and Bronco. Both are expected to be red-hot models that could add more jobs to the facility.\nWhat is particularly worrisome to Fields, and should be to everyone else, is Trump’s campaign pledge to add a 35 percent tariff on cars and trucks built in Mexico and imported to the United States.\nThat would seem to be in direct violation of the North America Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the rules of the World Trade Organization. And it would also be terrible economic policy.\n“A tariff like that would be imposed on the entire auto sector, and that could have a huge impact on the U.S. economy,” Fields said.\nIt would surely ignite a trade war, with Mexico slapping tariffs on auto parts imported from United States manufacturers.\nAutomotive is the largest manufacturing export sector in the U.S., amounting to $54 billion in 2014, according to the Department of Commerce.\nMexico is the third largest export market in terms of value for light vehicles assembled in the United States.\nIn other words, trade is not a one-way street. American workers are benefiting from free trade with Mexico, just as Mexican workers are.\nFord’s hands are not entirely clean on the issue of free trade. The Dearborn-based automaker opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which would bring together the United States and 11 Pacific Rim countries in a trade consortium.\nFields complains the TPP does not do enough to curtail currency manipulation by some Asian countries. In that view he is in sync with the president-elect.\nTrump has also suggested a 45 percent tariff on goods imported from China, which is rapidly becoming America’s most important trading partner. That, too, would have disastrous impact on U.S. workers and economic growth. And it would drive up prices for a wide range of consumer goods.\nAmerica always loses when it engages in trade wars. Trump and his team should focus on growing the economy through smarter tax and regulatory policies, rather than throwing up barriers to trade.",

      "text": "Ford has taken a lot of heat for moving production out of the US and into Mexico. Ford is NOW moving the truck plant out of Mexico… \nAnd that’s great news for you, Ohio! \nFord’s heavy duty pickup trucks which used to be built in Mexico started rolling off an assembly line in Ohio this week. \nThat’s good news for the 1,000 Ford workers in Ohio, who might have otherwise been out of work. \nIt’s also good publicity for Ford (F), which has been under fire for investing so much in Mexico. In April, the automaker said it would invest $2.5 billion in transmission plants in the Mexican states of Chihuahua and Guanajuato, creating about 3,800 jobs there. \nFord’s south-of-the-border strategy has drawn heavy criticism from groups such as the United Auto Workers union and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. \nThe Avon Lake, Ohio, plant produced its first batch of Ford’s full-size F-650 and F-750 pick up trucks on Wednesday. \n“Our investment…reinforces our commitment to building vehicles in America,” said Joe Hinrichs, Ford president, The Americas. “Working with our partners in the UAW, we found a way to make the costs competitive enough to bring production of a whole new generation of work trucks to Ohio.”… \n…Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump recently said that if he’s elected he would take steps to make it more expensive for manufacturers to shift work to Mexico and then export the items back to the United States. \n“How does that help us?” Trump said about the Ford investment in Mexico while campaigning in Michigan this week. “Mexico is becoming the new China.” Read more: CNN Money \nMake America Great Again! \nThis is the kind of thing that Democrats didn’t get — the struggle to keep good-paying jobs in America. \nMicheal Moore got this and even used the example of Trump confronting the Ford Motor Executives at the Detroit Economic Club. \nEven crazy ol’ Joe Biden got it. \n(Here at ClashDaily are gonna kinda miss Joe for being such a douchebag.) \nIt’s a good move on Ford’s part. The tariffs for importing goods from Mexico is about to go up! \nShare if you think this is YUGE news for manufacturing in the US 490 shares Post navigation",

The first wave of downsizing was spurred by the oil crisis of the mid-70's, bringing rise to the economy car as we know it today. \nDownsizing simply means putting in a smaller engine in favor of a bigger one. Unfortunately, downsizing an engine usually means you have to sacrifice performance as these engines are limited when it comes to making power. Forcing something like a 1.3 liter engine to be as powerful as a 2.0 liter engine has its engineering limitations too and you also end up giving up reliability as well. If you wanted more power, you were forced to get yourself a car with a larger displacement at the expense of fuel economy. With shifting market demands, we now want more from the humble motor car. We want them to be fun but still be efficient. \nEnter the turbocharger. \nAnother alternative to adding power is to turbocharge the engine. The idea of turbocharging is sound, simply force more air into the engine, add fuel to the mix and you get a healthy gain in horsepower. However, in the early days of boost, turbochargers ran hot and ate up a lot of fuel. Thanks to advances in technology, it can now be used as a fuel saving measure and Ford has combined the benefits of downsizing and perks of turbo power with EcoBoost. Ford is one of the few brands in the Philippines to offer advanced turbo technologies to a wide range of vehicles from the subcompact Fiesta to the full-size Expedition. \nSo what can Ford EcoBoost do for you? Here are two key benefits to downsizing with the help of a turbo. \nPower \nIf one were to follow logic, big engines equals big power while small engines equal less power. With turbocharging, it allows small engines to make significant gains in power. The 1.0 liter, three cylinder engine in the Fiesta may be small but it develops 125 PS and 170 Nm of torque, figures old 1600cc engines would struggle to reach. \nThe same applies for the Ford Focus with its 1.5 liter, four cylinder mill. The compact engine puts out 180 PS and 240 Nm of torque and, in the past, you needed a six cylinder engine just to reach those figures. \nAs for the Mustang, it too gets an EcoBoost engine. The 2.3 liter, four cylinder engine puts out more power than the V6 from the previous model and more power than the V8 models from the early 2000's. With 310 PS and 434 Nm of torque available at low revs, the Mustang EcoBoost is an efficient pony car. Simply put, it is a muscle car without the thirst. \nFor those looking for a potent SUV, Ford also packs the EcoBoost engine in the Explorer. Choose between the Explorer Limited or Explorer Sport and both pack quite the punch. In the Explorer Limited, it runs with the same engine as the Mustang albeit with a different power output. It puts out 274 PS and 408 Nm of torque and, to put that into perspective, it produces more power that old V6 engines. Opt for the Explorer Sport and you get an even more potent 3.5 liter V6 punching out 370 PS and a whopping 475 Nm of torque. The new Explorer not only shuttles your family in comfort but also lets you enjoy the thrills of boost. \nNeed even more space? Then its time to consider the Expedition Platinum, also with EcoBoost power. Like the Explorer Sport, it is powered by the same 3.5 liter V6 but with a healthier dose of good ol' torque. Power is retained at 370 PS while torque rises to a stump-pulling 569 Nm, emphasizing the haul in hauler. The best part is, you no longer have to feed eight cylinder to enjoy the perks of locomotive-like pulling power. \n- \nEfficiency \nWith the help of EcoBoost, The Fiesta, Focus, Mustang, Explorer and Expedition all make over 100 horsepower per liter, extracting every ounce of power from their downsized engines and thus, negating the need for eight cylinders. When it comes to making the most out of a little, the EcoBoost engine delivers. \nThe Ford EcoBoost line not only makes the most out of their compact engines but also delivers high fuel efficiency which have been proven in official testing. \nDuring the DOE Fuel Economy Run last May, the Ford Fiesta and Ford Focus posted high marks for fuel economy. The Fiesta 1.0L Sport+ managed 23.39 kilometers per liter while the Focus 1.5L Sport + did 19.20 kilometers per liter. \n- \nTo sum up, the Ford EcoBoost engines balance the fine line between performance and economy. The second wave of downsizing sees manufacturers making the most out of a little and Ford is showing us the way by offering a wide range of high-power and high-efficiency vehicles. From subcompact to full-size, Ford has an EcoBoost powertrain for all. It's performance without the guilt. \n- \nWant to feel and experience the EcoBoost-powered cars first hand? Then head on to the AutoFocus Testdrive Festival at the SM Mall of Asia Grounds in Pasay City from November 17-20. Related Articles",
