      "text": "  \nCambridge, MA - 16 Nov 2016: Resilient, an IBM (NYSE: IBM ) Company and the Ponemon Institute unveiled the results of the annual Cyber Resilient Organization study, which found that only 32   say their organization has a high level of Cyber Resilience – down slightly from 35 percent in 2015. The 2016 study also found that that 66 percent of respondents say their organization is not prepared to recover from cyberattacks. For the second straight year, the study showed that challenges with incident response (IR) are hindering Cyber Resilience. Seventy-five percent of respondents admit they do not have a formal cyber security incident response plan (CSIRP) that is applied consistently across the organization. Of those with a CSIRP in place, 52 percent have either not reviewed or updated the plan since it was put in place, or have no set plan for doing so. Additionally, 41 percent say the time to resolve a cyber incident has increased in the past 12 months, compared to only 31 percent who say it has decreased. \n\"This year’s Cyber Resilience study shows that organizations globally are still not prepared to manage and mitigate a cyberattack,\" said John Bruce, CEO and co-founder of Resilient, an IBM Company. “Security leaders can drive significant improvement by making incident response a top priority – focusing on planning, preparation, and intelligence.” \nAccording to respondents, an incident response platform (IRP) is among the most effective security technologies for helping organizations become Cyber Resilient, along with identity management and authentication, and intrusion detection and prevention systems. \nThe study also uncovered common barriers to Cyber Resilience. The majority – 66 percent – say “insufficient planning and preparedness” is the top barrier to Cyber Resilience. Respondents also indicate that the complexity of IT and businesses processes is increasing faster than their ability to prevent, detect, and respond to cyberattacks – leaving businesses vulnerable. This year, 46 percent of respondents say the “complexity of IT processes” is a significant barrier to achieving a high level of Cyber Resilience, up from 36 percent in 2015. Fifty-two percent say “complexity of business processes” is a significant barrier, up from 47 percent in 2015. \nConducted by the Ponemon Institute and sponsored by Resilient, The 2016 Cyber Resilient Organization is a benchmark study on Cyber Resilience – an organization’s ability to maintain its core purpose and integrity in the face of cyberattacks. The global survey features insight from more than 2,400 security and IT professionals from around the world, including the United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany, United Arab Emirates, Brazil, and Australia. \nWhile a recent study from IBM’s Institute of Business Value found that reducing incident response time is the top challenge facing   today [1] , this new survey from the Ponemon Institute shows that the majority of companies are still not taking the proper steps to plan an effective and comprehensive response plan. \nWhile the results of the study show that many organizations have yet to implement effective planning and preparedness measures to respond to cyberattacks, studies show that incident response will become a greater priority within the next several years. [2] \n“While companies are seeing the value of deploying an incident response plan, there is still a lag in having the appropriate people, processes, and technologies in place,” said Dr. Larry Ponemon. “We are encouraged that this is becoming a more important part of an overall IT security strategy.” \nThe executive summary of these findings and the infographic can be downloaded here . \nKey takeaways from the study include: Companies are experiencing frequent and successful cyberattacks More than half (53 percent) say they suffered at least one data breach in the past two years 74 percent say they faced threats due to human error in the past year When examining the past two years, 74 percent say they have been compromised by malware on a frequent basis, and 64 percent have been compromised by phishing on a frequent basis Organizations can’t maintain operations effectively or recover quickly post-attack 68 percent don’t believe their organizations have the ability to remain resilient in the wake of a cyberattack 66 percent aren’t confident in their organization’s ability to effectively recover from an attack A lack of planning and preparation is the biggest barrier Only 25 percent have an   consistently across the organization. Twenty-three percent have no incident response plan at all Only 14 percent test their incident response plans more than one time per year 66 percent cite a lack of planning as their organization’s biggest barrier to becoming resilient to cyberattacks Ability to respond to a cyberattack has not improved significantly 48 percent say their organization’s Cyber Resilience has either declined (4 percent) or not improved (44 percent) over the past 12 months 41 percent say the time to resolve a cyber incident has increased or increased significantly, while only 31 percent say it has decreased or decreased significantly \nAbout Resilient, an IBM Company \nResilient’s mission is to help organizations thrive in the face of any cyberattack or business crisis.

      "text": "IBM opens new Cambridge, MA security headquarters with massive cyber range Posted Spotify’s   \nIt was a big day today for IBM today as it opened its shiny new security headquarters in Kendall Square in Cambridge, MA, complete with what the company is calling the first commercial cyber range. \nA cyber range is a network security testing environment, and is typically run by the military or military contractors. This one, dubbed X-Force Command, however, is much more than a couple of terminals in a lab. It is a massive setup with seats for 36 operators. It features audio, video and a simulated Fortune 500 company operation with the goal of giving the user a realistically simulated cyber crisis. \nIt includes nearly a petabyte of data running in a data center underneath the cyber range, and includes all of the kinds of operations that you would have running in a typical enterprise such as email servers, supply chain software, employees using the internet and so forth. \nThe idea behind the cyber range is to simulate an actual cyber event to show security personnel, C-suite executives or anyone just how prepared (or more likely unprepared) they are to deal with a massive breach. \n“We are putting you into a simulator that is so realistic that your pulse will race, and you will be stressed, and you will learn how to make critical decisions in a crisis,” Caleb Barlow, vice president of security at IBM explained. \nThe Cyber Range is part of a broader security strategy by the company. Over the last couple of years, it has purchased at least 7 security properties including Resilient Systems earlier this year , which helps companies prepare for a cyber attack before they happen. We are putting you into a simulator that is so realistic that your pulse will race, and you will be stressed, and you will learn how to make critical decisions in a crisis. — Caleb Barlow, IBM VP of Security \nWhile Barlow said the cyber range wasn’t being positioned as a sales tool, so much as an awareness raising device, it is designed to show people in stark terms what happens during a breach, and how they might react after an incident — especially if they are unprepared. \nThe simulation can help you understand the different aspects of breach response such as how quickly you report the event to regulators and government officials, what happens if the breach leaks to the press (as often happens), and how to deal with all of this with the company in crisis mode. Obviously, if you have thought this through beforehand, and have a plan in place, a playbook if you will, you are going to be in a better position than trying to react to all of the different pressure points in the heat of the moment. \nIt’s not a coincidence of course that this is all the kind of stuff Resilient has built into its solutions. In addition, it wouldn’t be IBM without a consulting piece and they have built a team of consultants to help customers prepare for an attack and deal with the aftermath. Related Articles IBM Adds Post-Cyber Attack Planning With Resilient Systems Acquisition IBM and MIT partner up to create AI that understands sight and sound the way we do Sony Hackers Threaten A Media Organization And Others \nWendi Whitmore was brought on board 7 months ago to run the IBM X-Force IRIS Team, a group of consultants that have been picked for their expertise in cybersecurity. Whitmore herself has almost 15 years of cyber experience including stints with the Air Force, Mandiant and CrowdStrike. \nShe says the goal of her team is to help companies deal with massive breaches after they occur, but they also want to work with companies on how to prevent them. While she acknowledges blocking smaller breaches is probably not possible, she believes that, with proper preparation, a company can prevent a massive company-wide, Sony-style breach — and that is what her team is trying to do. \nThe company seems fixated on this idea of helping companies to prepare for breaches. It has devoted $200 million this calendar year to its security operation, which has included opening the new security headquarters and building the cyber range. To date, the security division has 8000 employees worldwide and generates $2 billion worth of business. The company wouldn’t reveal how many would be housed in the Cambridge office, but said much of the Security executive team would be based there.",

      "title": "IBM and Ponemon Study Reveals Organizations Remain Unprepared to Respond to Cyberattacks",
      "text": "CAMBRIDGE, Mass. , Nov. 16, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Resilient, an IBM Company (NYSE: IBM ) and the Ponemon Institute unveiled the results of the annual Cyber Resilient Organization study, which found that only 32 percent of IT and security professionals say their organization has a high level of Cyber Resilience – down slightly from 35 percent in 2015. The 2016 study also found that 66 percent of respondents say their organization is not prepared to recover from cyberattacks. \nFor the second straight year, the study showed that challenges with incident response (IR) are hindering Cyber Resilience. Seventy-five percent of respondents admit they do not have a formal cyber security incident response plan (CSIRP) that is applied consistently across the organization. Of those with a CSIRP in place, 52 percent have either not reviewed or updated the plan since it was put in place, or have no set plan for doing so. Additionally, 41 percent say the time to resolve a cyber incident has increased in the past 12 months, compared to only 31 percent who say it has decreased.\n\"This year's Cyber Resilience study shows that organizations globally are still not prepared to manage and mitigate a cyberattack,\" said John Bruce , CEO and co-founder of Resilient, an IBM Company. \"Security leaders can drive significant improvement by making incident response a top priority – focusing on planning, preparation, and intelligence.\"\nAccording to respondents, an incident response platform (IRP) is among the most effective security technologies for helping organizations become Cyber Resilient, along with identity management and authentication, and intrusion detection and prevention systems.\nThe study also uncovered common barriers to Cyber Resilience. The majority – 66 percent – say \"insufficient planning and preparedness\" is the top barrier to Cyber Resilience. Respondents also indicate that the complexity of IT and businesses processes is increasing faster than their ability to prevent, detect, and respond to cyberattacks – leaving businesses vulnerable. This year, 46 percent of respondents say the \"complexity of IT processes\" is a significant barrier to achieving a high level of Cyber Resilience, up from 36 percent in 2015. Fifty-two percent say \"complexity of business processes\" is a significant barrier, up from 47 percent in 2015.\nConducted by the Ponemon Institute and sponsored by Resilient, The 2016 Cyber Resilient Organization is a benchmark study on Cyber Resilience – an organization's ability to maintain its core purpose and integrity in the face of cyberattacks. The global survey features insight from more than 2,400 security and IT professionals from around the world, including the United States , United Kingdom , France , Germany , United Arab Emirates , Brazil , and Australia.  \nWhile a recent study from IBM's Institute of Business Value found that reducing incident response time is the top challenge facing security professionals today[1], this new survey from the Ponemon Institute shows that the majority of companies are still not taking the proper steps to plan an effective and comprehensive response plan. \nWhile the results of the study show that many organizations have yet to implement effective planning and preparedness measures to respond to cyberattacks, studies show that incident response will become a greater priority within the next several years.[2]\n\"While companies are seeing the value of deploying an incident response plan, there is still a lag in having the appropriate people, processes, and technologies in place,\" said Dr. Larry Ponemon . \"We are encouraged that this is becoming a more important part of an overall IT security strategy.\"\nThe executive summary of these findings and the infographic can be downloaded here .\nKey takeaways from the study include: \nCompanies are experiencing frequent and successful cyberattacks More than half (53 percent) say they suffered at least one data breach in the past two years 74 percent say they faced threats due to human error in the past year When examining the past two years, 74 percent say they have been compromised by malware on a frequent basis, and 64 percent have been compromised by phishing on a frequent basis Organizations can't maintain operations effectively or recover quickly post-attack 68 percent don't believe their organizations have the ability to remain resilient in the wake of a cyberattack 66 percent aren't confident in their organization's ability to effectively recover from an attack A lack of planning and preparation is the biggest barrier Only 25 percent have an incident response plan applied consistently across the organization. Twenty-three percent have no incident response plan at all Only 14 percent test their incident response plans more than one time per year 66 percent cite a lack of planning as their organization's biggest barrier to becoming resilient to cyberattacks Ability to respond to a cyberattack has not improved significantly 48 percent say their organization's Cyber Resilience has either declined (4 percent) or not improved (44 percent) over the past 12 months 41 percent say the time to resolve a cyber incident has increased or increased significantly, while only 31 percent say it has decreased or decreased significantly About Resilient, an IBM Company\nResilient's mission is to help organizations thrive in the face of any cyberattack or business crisis.

      "text": "CAMBRIDGE, Mass. , Nov. 16, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- IBM Security (NYSE: IBM ) today announced a major expansion of its incident response capabilities, including new facilities, services and software as part of a $200 million investment made this year. These investments include a new global security headquarters in Cambridge, Mass. which features the industry's first physical Cyber Range for the commercial sector, where participants experience preparing for and responding to cyber attacks using live malware and real-world scenarios. \nIBM also expanded capabilities and capacity for its global network of IBM X-Force Command Centers which now handle over 1 trillion security events per month. These security operations centers are staffed by 1,400 security professionals who will use cognitive technologies like Watson for client services, including chat sessions and data delivery, as well as Watson for Cybersecurity to quickly address cyber security events. \nAs part of today's announcement, IBM launched a new elite incident response and intelligence consulting team called IBM X-Force Incident Response and Intelligence Services (IRIS).  IBM's investments also includes its acquisition of Resilient Systems earlier this year , a pioneer in the incident response market.\nA new Ponemon Institute study on Cyber Resilience, sponsored by IBM and also announced today , found 75 percent of IT and security professionals surveyed say their organization does not have a modern incident response plan applied across the entire enterprise. This lack of planning and coordination can make it difficult to respond quickly and contain the costs of an incident. For example, in 2018, companies in the UK must report data breaches to regulators within 72 hours or face fines up to 4 percent of their global annual turnover.\n\"Being prepared to respond is the first line of defense in making sure a cyber security incident doesn't become a crisis,\" said Marc van Zadelhoff , General Manager, IBM Security. \"To adequately prepare for –and respond to – cyber attacks, companies need to assemble cross-functional teams that bring a strategic mix of security intelligence, technical skill, legal precision and regulatory understanding combined with a comprehensive plan of action. With our investments, we've moved IBM into a unique position in the industry with a comprehensive cybersecurity immune system for customers to build world-class capabilities for thwarting cybercrime.\"\nIBM X-Force Command Centers and New Cyber Range \nIBM Security's new headquarters in Cambridge , located at 75 Binney Street, includes a fully operational \"Cyber Range,\" bringing together capabilities and experiences previously only available in the public sector. IBM's new X-Force Command Cambridge Cyber Range immerses people in simulated cyber attacks to train them on how properly prepare for, respond to, and manage a broad variety of threats. This experience can be leveraged by Chief Information Security Officers and their security teams, as well as those without security expertise, such as other members of the C-Suite/lines of business, board members, students and others.  \nIBM's Cyber Range uses live malware, ransomware and other real-world hacker tools culled from the dark web to deliver realistic cyber attack experiences. The facility features an air-gapped network of a fictitious corporation, used for simulated attacks, consisting of one petabyte of information, more than 3,000 users and a simulated version of the internet.\nAs part of the Cyber Range experience, IBM has designed real-world scenarios to help clients experience, defend against and shut down cyber attacks. The scenarios will also help train organizations with the necessary steps required to respond quickly in the wake of an incident, from addressing regulatory requirements that vary from country to country and state to state, to client, business partner, media and supply chain notifications and management.\nAs part of today's announcement, IBM also launched IBM X-Force Command Center Atlanta, a fully upgraded security operations center which IBM has operated for 15 years. The facility now handles over 35 billion security events per day – a 75 percent increase in capacity. \nIBM X-Force Command Center Atlanta is a hub for the company's network of SOCs, which help protect 4,500 clients across 133 countries. Using IBM X-Force Threat Intelligence, the security operation centers bring in 200,000 new pieces of threat intelligence daily, by leveraging insights from analysis on over 100 million web pages and images, and collecting data from monitoring 270 million endpoints.\nIBM also has expanded its capacity to handle security events and intelligence for IBM X-Force Command Centers in Bangalore and Poland , complemented by previously modernized IBM centers in Costa Rica and Tokyo , creating a scalable global network of defense for clients.\nNew IBM X-Force IRIS Team of Elite Security Consultants\nIBM also launched a new incident response and intelligence consulting team called IBM X-Force IRIS . Led by Wendi Whitmore , Global Lead, IBM X-Force IRIS the team includes over 100 elite cybersecurity consultants positioned throughout the globe, with deep expertise in incident response and threat intelligence.   \nWhitmore has built the IBM X-Force IRIS team by bringing together security consultants with a broad spectrum of experience , including those who have led responses to many of the largest cyber security breaches in the past decade.  Their response experience has spanned retail, political and international banking networks. Many members of the new team are former security experts at federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies where they built intelligence collection and analysis capabilities which are still in use today. \nThe IBM X-Force IRIS team further expands IBM's incident response capabilities, building on the services announced in February. The new consulting capabilities, with the incorporation of IBM X-Force intelligence services, will help clients understand where and how cyber attacks are being launched to defend against and remediate them with greater speed and precision. \nWith a focus on preparedness and planning, the IBM X-Force IRIS practice helps clients test their environment, run attack scenarios, and identify key business systems and processes needing stronger security and critical to maintaining resiliency. Through an emphasis on proactive planning, IBM X-Force IRIS can help clients reduce the costs and complications of response, which can help lead to quicker containment of an incident.\nThe IBM X-Force IRIS's capabilities include: \nProactive incident response planning and preparedness training Incident simulation and tabletop exercises, including Red Teaming / Blue Teaming A concurrent approach to containment, remediation and threat intelligence Forensic analysis Threat Intelligence analysis      Builds on Resilient Systems' Pioneering Incident Response Technology\nResilient, an IBM Company, provides a software platform for comprehensive incident response management and orchestration – designed to help security professionals manage and respond to incidents faster and more intelligently. The platform has agile playbooks based on National Institute of Standards and Technology and SANS Institute standards that cover potential threats from a lost laptop to malware attacks. It also has the one of the largest privacy databases with global breach notifications to help clients maintain compliance. This enables clients to mitigate cyber incidents more quickly while helping minimize their exposure. \nResilient Systems' award-winning platform is a foundational component of IBM's incident response technologies, along with IBM's QRadar Security Intelligence.\nFor more information on or to arrange a visit to the IBM X-Force Command Center Cyber visit:   http://www.ibm.com/security/xforcecommand \nAbout IBM Security \nIBM Security offers one of the most advanced and integrated portfolios of enterprise security products and services.

      "text": "  11:00 AM EST IBM and Ponemon Study Reveals Organizations Remain Unprepared to Respond to Cyberattacks \nCAMBRIDGE, Mass. , Nov. 16, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Resilient, an IBM Company (NYSE: IBM ) and the Ponemon Institute unveiled the results of the annual Cyber Resilient Organization study, which found that only 32 percent of IT and security professionals say their organization has a high level of Cyber Resilience – down slightly from 35 percent in 2015. The 2016 study also found that 66 percent of respondents say their organization is not prepared to recover from cyberattacks. \nFor the second straight year, the study showed that challenges with incident response (IR) are hindering Cyber Resilience. Seventy-five percent of respondents admit they do not have a formal cyber security incident response plan (CSIRP) that is applied consistently across the organization. Of those with a CSIRP in place, 52 percent have either not reviewed or updated the plan since it was put in place, or have no set plan for doing so. Additionally, 41 percent say the time to resolve a cyber incident has increased in the past 12 months, compared to only 31 percent who say it has decreased. \n\"This year's Cyber Resilience study shows that organizations globally are still not prepared to manage and mitigate a cyberattack,\" said John Bruce , CEO and co-founder of Resilient, an IBM Company. \"Security leaders can drive significant improvement by making incident response a top priority – focusing on planning, preparation, and intelligence.\" \nAccording to respondents, an incident response platform (IRP) is among the most effective security technologies for helping organizations become Cyber Resilient, along with identity management and authentication, and intrusion detection and prevention systems. \nThe study also uncovered common barriers to Cyber Resilience. The majority – 66 percent – say \"insufficient planning and preparedness\" is the top barrier to Cyber Resilience. Respondents also indicate that the complexity of IT and businesses processes is increasing faster than their ability to prevent, detect, and respond to cyberattacks – leaving businesses vulnerable. This year, 46 percent of respondents say the \"complexity of IT processes\" is a significant barrier to achieving a high level of Cyber Resilience, up from 36 percent in 2015. Fifty-two percent say \"complexity of business processes\" is a significant barrier, up from 47 percent in 2015. \nConducted by the Ponemon Institute and sponsored by Resilient, The 2016 Cyber Resilient Organization is a benchmark study on Cyber Resilience – an organization's ability to maintain its core purpose and integrity in the face of cyberattacks. The global survey features insight from more than 2,400 security and IT professionals from around the world, including the United States , United Kingdom , France , Germany , United Arab Emirates , Brazil , and Australia. \nWhile a recent study from IBM's Institute of Business Value found that reducing incident response time is the top challenge facing security professionals today[1], this new survey from the Ponemon Institute shows that the majority of companies are still not taking the proper steps to plan an effective and comprehensive response plan. \nWhile the results of the study show that many organizations have yet to implement effective planning and preparedness measures to respond to cyberattacks, studies show that incident response will become a greater priority within the next several years.[2] \n\"While companies are seeing the value of deploying an incident response plan, there is still a lag in having the appropriate people, processes, and technologies in place,\" said Dr. Larry Ponemon . \"We are encouraged that this is becoming a more important part of an overall IT security strategy.\" \nThe executive summary of these findings and the infographic can be downloaded here . \nKey takeaways from the study include: Companies are experiencing frequent and successful cyberattacks More than half (53 percent) say they suffered at least one data breach in the past two years 74 percent say they faced threats due to human error in the past year When examining the past two years, 74 percent say they have been compromised by malware on a frequent basis, and 64 percent have been compromised by phishing on a frequent basis Organizations can't maintain operations effectively or recover quickly post-attack 68 percent don't believe their organizations have the ability to remain resilient in the wake of a cyberattack 66 percent aren't confident in their organization's ability to effectively recover from an attack A lack of planning and preparation is the biggest barrier Only 25 percent have an incident response plan applied consistently across the organization. Twenty-three percent have no incident response plan at all Only 14 percent test their incident response plans more than one time per year 66 percent cite a lack of planning as their organization's biggest barrier to becoming resilient to cyberattacks Ability to respond to a cyberattack has not improved significantly 48 percent say their organization's Cyber Resilience has either declined (4 percent) or not improved (44 percent) over the past 12 months 41 percent say the time to resolve a cyber incident has increased or increased significantly, while only 31 percent say it has decreased or decreased significantly \nAbout Resilient, an IBM Company Resilient's mission is to help organizations thrive in the face of any cyberattack or business crisis.

      "text": "  11:00 AM EST IBM Invests $200M to Help Clients Respond to Cybersecurity Incidents \nCAMBRIDGE, Mass. , Nov. 16, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- IBM Security (NYSE: IBM ) today announced a major expansion of its incident response capabilities, including new facilities, services and software as part of a $200 million investment made this year. These investments include a new global security headquarters in Cambridge, Mass. which features the industry's first physical Cyber Range for the commercial sector, where participants experience preparing for and responding to cyber attacks using live malware and real-world scenarios. \nIBM also expanded capabilities and capacity for its global network of IBM X-Force Command Centers which now handle over 1 trillion security events per month. These security operations centers are staffed by 1,400 security professionals who will use cognitive technologies like Watson for client services, including chat sessions and data delivery, as well as Watson for Cybersecurity to quickly address cyber security events. \nAs part of today's announcement, IBM launched a new elite incident response and intelligence consulting team called IBM X-Force Incident Response and Intelligence Services (IRIS). IBM's investments also includes its acquisition of Resilient Systems earlier this year , a pioneer in the incident response market. \nA new Ponemon Institute study on Cyber Resilience, sponsored by IBM and also announced today , found 75 percent of IT and security professionals surveyed say their organization does not have a modern incident response plan applied across the entire enterprise. This lack of planning and coordination can make it difficult to respond quickly and contain the costs of an incident. For example, in 2018, companies in the UK must report data breaches to regulators within 72 hours or face fines up to 4 percent of their global annual turnover. \n\"Being prepared to respond is the first line of defense in making sure a cyber security incident doesn't become a crisis,\" said Marc van Zadelhoff , General Manager, IBM Security. \"To adequately prepare for –and respond to – cyber attacks, companies need to assemble cross-functional teams that bring a strategic mix of security intelligence, technical skill, legal precision and regulatory understanding combined with a comprehensive plan of action. With our investments, we've moved IBM into a unique position in the industry with a comprehensive cybersecurity immune system for customers to build world-class capabilities for thwarting cybercrime.\" \nIBM X-Force Command Centers and New Cyber Range \nIBM Security's new headquarters in Cambridge , located at 75 Binney Street, includes a fully operational \"Cyber Range,\" bringing together capabilities and experiences previously only available in the public sector. IBM's new X-Force Command Cambridge Cyber Range immerses people in simulated cyber attacks to train them on how properly prepare for, respond to, and manage a broad variety of threats. This experience can be leveraged by Chief Information Security Officers and their security teams, as well as those without security expertise, such as other members of the C-Suite/lines of business, board members, students and others. \nIBM's Cyber Range uses live malware, ransomware and other real-world hacker tools culled from the dark web to deliver realistic cyber attack experiences. The facility features an air-gapped network of a fictitious corporation, used for simulated attacks, consisting of one petabyte of information, more than 3,000 users and a simulated version of the internet. \nAs part of the Cyber Range experience, IBM has designed real-world scenarios to help clients experience, defend against and shut down cyber attacks. The scenarios will also help train organizations with the necessary steps required to respond quickly in the wake of an incident, from addressing regulatory requirements that vary from country to country and state to state, to client, business partner, media and supply chain notifications and management. \nAs part of today's announcement, IBM also launched IBM X-Force Command Center Atlanta, a fully upgraded security operations center which IBM has operated for 15 years. The facility now handles over 35 billion security events per day – a 75 percent increase in capacity. \nIBM X-Force Command Center Atlanta is a hub for the company's network of SOCs, which help protect 4,500 clients across 133 countries. Using IBM X-Force Threat Intelligence, the security operation centers bring in 200,000 new pieces of threat intelligence daily, by leveraging insights from analysis on over 100 million web pages and images, and collecting data from monitoring 270 million endpoints. \nIBM also has expanded its capacity to handle security events and intelligence for IBM X-Force Command Centers in Bangalore and Poland , complemented by previously modernized IBM centers in Costa Rica and Tokyo , creating a scalable global network of defense for clients. \nNew IBM X-Force IRIS Team of Elite Security Consultants IBM also launched a new incident response and intelligence consulting team called IBM X-Force IRIS . Led by Wendi Whitmore , Global Lead, IBM X-Force IRIS the team includes over 100 elite cybersecurity consultants positioned throughout the globe, with deep expertise in incident response and threat intelligence. \nWhitmore has built the IBM X-Force IRIS team by bringing together security consultants with a broad spectrum of experience , including those who have led responses to many of the largest cyber security breaches in the past decade. Their response experience has spanned retail, political and international banking networks. Many members of the new team are former security experts at federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies where they built intelligence collection and analysis capabilities which are still in use today. \nThe IBM X-Force IRIS team further expands IBM's incident response capabilities, building on the services announced in February. The new consulting capabilities, with the incorporation of IBM X-Force intelligence services, will help clients understand where and how cyber attacks are being launched to defend against and remediate them with greater speed and precision. \nWith a focus on preparedness and planning, the IBM X-Force IRIS practice helps clients test their environment, run attack scenarios, and identify key business systems and processes needing stronger security and critical to maintaining resiliency. Through an emphasis on proactive planning, IBM X-Force IRIS can help clients reduce the costs and complications of response, which can help lead to quicker containment of an incident. \nThe IBM X-Force IRIS's capabilities include: Proactive incident response planning and preparedness training Incident simulation and tabletop exercises, including Red Teaming / Blue Teaming A concurrent approach to containment, remediation and threat intelligence Forensic analysis Threat Intelligence analysis \nBuilds on Resilient Systems' Pioneering Incident Response Technology Resilient, an IBM Company, provides a software platform for comprehensive incident response management and orchestration – designed to help security professionals manage and respond to incidents faster and more intelligently. The platform has agile playbooks based on National Institute of Standards and Technology and SANS Institute standards that cover potential threats from a lost laptop to malware attacks. It also has the one of the largest privacy databases with global breach notifications to help clients maintain compliance. This enables clients to mitigate cyber incidents more quickly while helping minimize their exposure. \nResilient Systems' award-winning platform is a foundational component of IBM's incident response technologies, along with IBM's QRadar Security Intelligence. \nFor more information on or to arrange a visit to the IBM X-Force Command Center Cyber visit: http://www.ibm.com/security/xforcecommand \nAbout IBM Security IBM Security offers one of the most advanced and integrated portfolios of enterprise security products and services.

      "text": "IBM Invests $200M To Help Clients Respond To Cybersecurity Incidents Opens Industry's First Commercial Cyber Range at New Global Security HQ in Cambridge, MA PR Newswire Nov16,201611:00AMEST CAMBRIDGE, Mass. , Nov. 16, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- IBM Security (NYSE: IBM ) today announced a major expansion of its incident response capabilities, including new facilities, services and software as part of a $200 million investment made this year. These investments include a new global security headquarters in Cambridge, Mass. which features the industry's first physical Cyber Range for the commercial sector, where participants experience preparing for and responding to cyber attacks using live malware and real-world scenarios. IBM also expanded capabilities and capacity for its global network of IBM X-Force Command Centers which now handle over 1 trillion security events per month. These security operations centers are staffed by 1,400 security professionals who will use cognitive technologies like Watson for client services, including chat sessions and data delivery, as well as Watson for Cybersecurity to quickly address cyber security events. As part of today's announcement, IBM launched a new elite incident response and intelligence consulting team called IBM X-Force Incident Response and Intelligence Services (IRIS). IBM's investments also includes its acquisition of Resilient Systems earlier this year , a pioneer in the incident response market. A new Ponemon Institute study on Cyber Resilience, sponsored by IBM and also announced today , found 75 percent of IT and security professionals surveyed say their organization does not have a modern incident response plan applied across the entire enterprise. This lack of planning and coordination can make it difficult to respond quickly and contain the costs of an incident. For example, in 2018, companies in the UK must report data breaches to regulators within 72 hours or face fines up to 4 percent of their global annual turnover. \"Being prepared to respond is the first line of defense in making sure a cyber security incident doesn't become a crisis,\" said Marc van Zadelhoff , General Manager, IBM Security. \"To adequately prepare for -and respond to - cyber attacks, companies need to assemble cross-functional teams that bring a strategic mix of security intelligence, technical skill, legal precision and regulatory understanding combined with a comprehensive plan of action. With our investments, we've moved IBM into a unique position in the industry with a comprehensive cybersecurity immune system for customers to build world-class capabilities for thwarting cybercrime.\" IBM X-Force Command Centers and New Cyber Range IBM Security's new headquarters in Cambridge , located at 75 Binney Street, includes a fully operational \"Cyber Range,\" bringing together capabilities and experiences previously only available in the public sector. IBM's new X-Force Command Cambridge Cyber Range immerses people in simulated cyber attacks to train them on how properly prepare for, respond to, and manage a broad variety of threats. This experience can be leveraged by Chief Information Security Officers and their security teams, as well as those without security expertise, such as other members of the C-Suite/lines of business, board members, students and others. IBM's Cyber Range uses live malware, ransomware and other real-world hacker tools culled from the dark web to deliver realistic cyber attack experiences. The facility features an air-gapped network of a fictitious corporation, used for simulated attacks, consisting of one petabyte of information, more than 3,000 users and a simulated version of the internet.

      "text": "Source: via Nvidia \nAccording to Venture Beat , “A new software toolkit available today called IBM PowerAI is designed to run on the recently announced IBM server built for artificial intelligence that features Nvidia NVLink technology optimized for IBM’s Power Architecture.” \nThis is potentially a very significant step forward for both IBM and Nvidia stock, as the deep learning arena is still relatively small, yet will certainly be a major factor in the future. \nFor the uninitiated, non-geek consumer, HPC and deep learning are, in layman’s terms , the use of multiple pieces of high-powered computer hardware components together with software designed to analyze huge amounts of data. \nInitially, software teaches the machine — referred to as “machine learning”— how to analyze and interpret the data so, later, it will be able to act independently (e.g., recognizing and understanding spoken words or identifying specific characteristics of an image) without the need for additional instructions. \nOne of the ultimate goals of die-hard deep learning enthusiasts is to further the development of a true artificial intelligence system. IBM Remains a Leader in the Deep Learning Arena \nWhile the concept of deep learning has existed for quite some time, the industry has not progressed as quickly as many had hoped, simply because the technology required to effectively process the utterly massive amounts of available data was just too weak. Too few companies and organizations possessed supercomputers with enough processing power to make headway. 10 Best Cheap Stocks to Buy Now Under $10 \nOne of the companies that did, however, was International Business Machines. As far back as the early 1950s, IBM was heavily involved in the development and teaching of computers to analyze data and make independent decisions based on their experiences. A notable example was IBM’s checkers-playing program written by Arthur Samuel in 1952, which eventually learned enough and evolved to the point it was able to win a game against a human champion in 1962. \nMore than three decades later, IBM’s Deep Blue chess-playing computer beat world champion Garry Kasparov in a six-game standard chess match in May 1997. Of course, it took IBM more than 12 years to successfully train and develop Deep Blue, but the match against Kasparov was a monumental leap forward for IBM in the AI and deep learning arenas. \nFast-forward to 2011, and IBM’s latest game-playing creation, Watson, beat Jeopardy! ’s all-time (human) winner, Ken Jennings , who had previously won a record 74 games in a row. Watson wasn’t perfect, though, despite the massive teams of computer engineers and developers who created the bedroom-sized supercomputer . \nHowever, continued advancements in technology allowed IBM to shrink Watson down to the size of “three stacked pizza boxes” just a few years later. \nThose technological advancements, which include not only making machines and computers faster, but smaller as well, have continued to be a focal point for IBM’s deep learning endeavors, not to mention the eventual commercial applications for Watson . \nThe company’s research and development efforts recently culminated in the creation of the TrueNorth computer chip , hailed as a giant leap forward in pushing the potential of artificial intelligence and deep learning capabilities. Enter NVDA Graphics Processing Units \nIn case you didn’t know, your computer’s graphics processing unit, or GPU, is actually capable of quite a bit more than merely displaying high-definition pictures and videos on your monitor. In fact, today’s high-end GPUs are frequently used for a multitude of tasks that often have nothing at all to do with videos . \nNvidia is the undisputed leader in the GPU market, having recently pulled so far ahead of it’s top competitor, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD ), that it’s unlikely AMD will regain any significant amount of that lost market share. NVDA stock advanced to the front of the pack not just because its GPUs were reliable and extremely cutting-edge, but because they were affordable, too. \nNvidia took advantage of a series of AMD mistakes that led to delayed releases and poor hardware performance, and management has continued to push out new products that expand the boundaries of the semiconductor industry. \nOne such boundary has been deep learning, which NVDA has embraced with its Deep Learning SDK, software that “provides high-performance tools and libraries to power innovative GPU-accelerated machine learning applications.”",

The FinTech startup is also using IBM Cloud to develop new cognitive-based investment solutions using Watson APIs and broaden its reach within and outside Singapore. Eigencat is a startup which offers a digital, multi-asset class portfolio analysis platform that caters to both private banks and new entrants such as Internet and telecom companies looking to manage the risk and performance parameters of their investments. \nWith strong backgrounds in the financial and technology sectors, the co-founders of Eigencat built a multi-product robo-advising software that provides automated portfolio management advice without the use of human financial planners, to meet this need. However, they needed to run their solution on a platform that could be accessed by clients globally, at an economical cost. Bluemix , provided them with an open standards-based cloud platform that allowed them to develop and deploy apps quickly, with scalability to build more solutions in future. \nSince its move to the IBM Cloud, Eigencat has seen significant improvement in business productivity and a reduction in lead time for application development. For example, it now takes Eigencat two days instead of seven to set up the application development infrastructure. Eigencat has also gained about 20 per cent in time efficiency through significantly reduced system administration effort. \nEigencat also turned to IBM for its Global Entrepreneurs Program for Cloud Startups , which provides startups with access to resources like IBM Cloud credits, tech support and business mentorship. With this, the startup will also be able tap into over eight million IT professionals from around the world from within the IBM developerWorks community. \n\"Given that Eigencat is a startup, joining the IBM ecosystem was really appealing as it introduced us to a bigger world of possibilities. We are truly impressed by how easy our migration process was with Bluemix, allowing us to reduce the time and cost for service deployment. It was an added bonus to receive mentoring and technical assistance from the IBM team. We look forward to our continued relationship with them and are confident that investors too will find it convenient to use our platform to meet their investment needs,\" said Will Lawton, Co-Founder of Eigencat. \n“ With Singapore fast becoming a leading global FinTech hub , we hope to engage with more startups like Eigencat to help them gain a strong foothold in the FinTech space. IBM’s cloud platform with cutting-edge cognitive and analytics capabilities is a natural place to build industrial strength Fintech. IBM has been proactively helping to build a rich ecosystem for startups and developers, and provide a strong network of resources to drive collaborative cloud innovation. Over 20,000 new developers join Bluemix every week and through the Global Entrepreneurs Program for Cloud Startups, we have worked with more than 2,000 startups globally. This is just the beginning for FinTech in Singapore and we are excited to mentor other fintechs to help bring them to the next level as we did with Eigencat. ” said Richard Turrin, FinTech Executive for IBM Asia-Pacific. \nBluemix, launched in 2014 with a $1 billion investment, has quickly risen to become the largest Cloud Foundry deployment in the world.

      "text": "IBM's The Weather Company adding 400 jobs and relocating its headquarters within Atlanta World's largest private weather enterprise reaffirms commitment to Atlanta and continued growth  19   ATLANTA   Gov. Nathan Deal and The Weather Company, an IBM (NYSE: IBM ) Business, today announced the company, which delivers up to to 40 billion forecasts daily, will relocate its headquarters within Atlanta and is hiring an additional 400 people as it prepares to grow its services that already provide accurate, personalized and actionable weather data and insights to millions of consumers and thousands of businesses around the world. \"The Weather Company has made significant contributions in Georgia for more than three decades,\" Governor Deal said. \"The company's decision to expand its workforce in the metro Atlanta area is a reflection of our state's ability to retain dynamic companies with our business-friendly environment and highly skilled workforce. We look forward to our ongoing relationship with The Weather Company and its continued success in Georgia .\" Atlanta headquarters of The Weather Company, an IBM Business, will move to Perimeter Summit and add 400 jobs. The Weather Company, which was acquired by IBM in January, helps some of the world's biggest brands in aviation, energy, insurance and media as well as government anticipate and respond to weather's impact on their operations. It connects newscasters, airline pilots, energy traders, insurance executives, state agency employees, retail management and more to the weather intel they need. \"The combination of technology and expertise from The Weather Company and IBM is progressing well as we create additional value for the clients of both companies,\" said Cameron Clayton , CEO and General Manager, The Weather Company. \"The additional hiring and the move to a new headquarters are indicative of the support and investment that IBM is providing to attract and retain the best and brightest as we build this amazing business.\" Relocation of The Weather Company's headquarters to Perimeter Summit at 1001 Perimeter Summit Boulevard is expected to begin in late spring of next year. Jobs being added include positions in software and product development, engineering, technology and marketing, among others.The Weather Company provides weather data and insights via Weather's API, its business solutions division, and its own digital products from The Weather Channel (weather.com ) and Weather Underground ( wunderground.com ). Earlier this year, The Weather Company announced plans to advance the precision and accuracy of weather forecasting by combining hyper-local, short-term custom forecasts developed by IBM Research with The Weather Company's global forecast model. The powerful combination of the two models is called Deep Thunder, which also uses historical weather data to train machine learning models to help businesses predict the actual impact of weather. Every day, The Weather Company's sophisticated models analyze data for worldwide locations using more than 100 terabytes of third-party data daily and Weather Underground's network of more than 200,000 personal weather stations. Combining that enormous volume and variety of data with advances in atmospheric and computational sciences enables The Weather Company to produce one of the most reliable global forecasts available today. As it announced the acquisition of The Weather Company in January, IBM said it will use The Weather Company's technology and expertise to serve as the foundation for the Watson Internet of Things Cloud platform, building on a $3 billion commitment IBM made in 2015 to invest in the Internet of Things. The acquisition extended the scale and capability of IBM's cloud data services platform and expanded The Weather Company's enterprise services capabilities and consumer reach to a global scale, including plans to bring weather.com to new major markets such as China and India . The Weather Company worked closely with the Georgia Department of Economic Development (GDECD), the Metro Atlanta Chamber and Georgia Power in the selection of its new headquarters location.\"We are excited that The Weather Company, a leader in the technology industry, is expanding their operations here,\" said GDEcD Commissioner Pat Wilson . \"We thank The Weather Company for their growth and confidence in the Atlanta area, and look forward to supporting them as they continue to provide weather data to millions of consumers and thousands of businesses around the world.\" The Weather Company, an IBM Business The Weather Company, an IBM Business, is the world's largest private weather enterprise, helping people make informed decisions -- and take action -- in the face of weather. The company offers the most accurate, personalized and actionable weather data and insight to millions of consumers, as well as thousands of marketers and businesses via Weather's API, its business solutions division, and its own digital products from The Weather Channel ( weather.com ) and Weather Underground ( wunderground.com ).

      "title": "IBM Chief Offers Trump Advice",
      "text": "International Business Machines Corp. CEO Ginni Rometty published an open letter to President-elect Donald Trump outlining her recommendations on health care, infrastructure spending and other issues.\nThe letter is her first comment on the prospect of a Trump administration since Mr. Trump, shortly before the election, criticized IBM and other companies for shifting U.S. jobs overseas.\nThe letter offers support for some of Mr. Trump's policies and advice on national issues—adding along the way that IBM is the largest technology employer in the U.S. Last year IBM hired more U.S. employees than in the five years prior, the letter said, and it has thousands of open positions.\nThe Donald J. Trump for President organization didn't immediately reply to a request for comment.\nSilicon Valley generally has viewed Mr. Trump's victory as a blow to the tech industry, as the president-elect has been a critic of Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. as well as IBM.\nAmong other technology executives, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos offered Mr. Trump congratulations in a message on Twitter, as did Salesforce.com CEO Marc Benioff, while Microsoft Corp. CEO Satya Nadella posted a congratulatory message on LinkedIn, with a link to a longer blog post by the company's president and chief legal officer.\nMr. Trump, in a Nov. 6 campaign speech in Minnesota, said IBM had laid off 500 workers in Minneapolis and moved their jobs to India and other countries. Mr. Trump also called out Ford for laying off 794 workers in St. Paul and MoneyGram for laying off 408 workers and moving those jobs overseas.\n\"If a company wants to leave Minnesota, fire their workers and move to another country, and then ship their products back into the United States…we will make them pay a 35% tax,\" he said.\nThe letter offers support for another of Mr. Trump's proposals, to end tax-code incentives for businesses to keep their overseas earnings out of the country. \"Many billions of dollars of American companies' earnings do not come home because of an outdated and punitive tax system,\" Ms. Rometty wrote.\nThe change would \"free up capital that companies of all sizes can reinvest in their U.S. operations, training and education programs for their employees, and research and development programs,\" the letter continues.\nIBM in 2015 spent more than half its annual $5.4 billion annual research and development budget in the U.S.\nIBM also supports Mr. Trump's proposed investment in infrastructure such as roads, bridges, buildings and other public facilities, Ms. Rometty wrote, adding that the infrastructure's performance would benefit by the inclusion of networked sensors and artificial intelligence, technologies that IBM offers.\nSimilarly, Ms. Rometty in her letter suggested reducing health-care costs through the use of information technology and data analytics. IBM said it operates one of the largest employer-sponsored health plans in the U.S. Health-care costs could be reduced by analyzing data to detect fraudulent Medicare claims, she wrote, citing a 2009 IBM position paper.\nMs. Rometty's letter also called for giving veterans the best health care possible. IBM recently announced a pilot program to help Department of Veterans Affairs oncologists treat 10,000 veterans using genomic analysis powered by Watson, the company's artificial-intelligence computing system.\nWrite to Rachael King at rachael.king@wsj.com\n 16, 2016 08:35 ET (13:35 ",

      "text": "Amazon Confronts Microsoft, Google, IBM In Cloud Computing Wars Big rivals have expanded in the field, but Amazon Web Services remains king of cloud services. (Amazon) Reprints \nAmazon.com ( AMZN ) has maintained a strong first-mover advantage in cloud computing services despite the expansion of Microsoft ( MSFT ) and the Google unit of Alphabet ( GOOGL ) into the field, says Pacific Crest Securities. \nLaunched 10 years ago and now with annual revenue above $10 billion, Amazon Web Services has a dominant market share of 54% in the cloud computing segment referred to as infrastructure-as-a-service, says Pacific Crest analyst Brent Bracelin in a research note ahead of the AWS user conference. \nAmazon is followed by IBM ( IBM ), with a 16% share, Microsoft at 12% with its Azure platform, Alibaba ( BABA ) at 4% with the Alibaba cloud platform and Google Cloud at 3%, Bracelin estimates. \nAlibaba Cloud launched in 2009; Microsoft Azure in 2010 and Google Cloud in 2011. For Q3, Amazon reported Amazon Web Services revenue rose 55% to $3.23 billion . IBD'S Take: Amazon stock has moved up the last two trading days, bouncing off a five-month low of 710.10 on Nov. 14, but is trading below its 50-day moving average. The stock sports an IBD Composite Rating of 56, meaning it has outperformed 56% of all stocks in the past year. To find out more about the stock, IBD Stock Checkup is the place to go. \n\"We remain impressed with the pace of innovation at AWS,\" Bracelin wrote. \"It is contributing to much higher profit levels than most investors anticipated, particularly for a business that is approaching a $13 billion run-rate yet is still growing by 55% year over year.\" \nAmazon stock was up 0.5%, near 747, in midday trading in the stock market today . \nBracelin estimates capital expenditures among the top seven cloud providers will reach $45 billion in 2016, up 24%. \n\"This large amount of spending creates an increasingly big hurdle rate for new entrants given the large head start of the existing suppliers and massive amount of capital required to establish a global data center footprint that is comparable in size and reach,\" he wrote. \nMicrosoft Azure just passed the $2 billion milestone for revenue, Bracelin wrote, making it still just one-fifth the size of AWS. \n\"Bottom line: AWS has a material first-mover advantage over peers, particularly given its internal culture drives a rapid pace of innovation,\" he said. \nThe Pacific Crest report comes just ahead of AWS re:Invent , Amazon's annual cloud computing user conference Nov. 28 in Las Vegas. It's expected to attract 24,000 attendees. The event is sold out. \nRELATED:",

      "title": "IBM Chief Offers Trump Advice",
      "text": "International Business Machines Corp. CEO Ginni Rometty published an open letter to President-elect Donald Trump outlining her recommendations on health care, infrastructure spending and other issues.\nThe letter is her first comment on the prospect of a Trump administration since Mr. Trump, shortly before the election, criticized IBM and other companies for shifting U.S. jobs overseas.\nThe letter offers support for some of Mr. Trump's policies and advice on national issues—adding along the way that IBM is the largest technology employer in the U.S. Last year IBM hired more U.S. employees than in the five years prior, the letter said, and it has thousands of open positions.\nThe Donald J. Trump for President organization didn't immediately reply to a request for comment.\nSilicon Valley generally has viewed Mr. Trump's victory as a blow to the tech industry, as the president-elect has been a critic of Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. as well as IBM.\nAmong other technology executives, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos offered Mr. Trump congratulations in a message on Twitter, as did Salesforce.com CEO Marc Benioff, while Microsoft Corp. CEO Satya Nadella posted a congratulatory message on LinkedIn, with a link to a longer blog post by the company's president and chief legal officer.\nMr. Trump, in a Nov. 6 campaign speech in Minnesota, said IBM had laid off 500 workers in Minneapolis and moved their jobs to India and other countries. Mr. Trump also called out Ford for laying off 794 workers in St. Paul and MoneyGram for laying off 408 workers and moving those jobs overseas.\n\"If a company wants to leave Minnesota, fire their workers and move to another country, and then ship their products back into the United States…we will make them pay a 35% tax,\" he said.\nThe letter offers support for another of Mr. Trump's proposals, to end tax-code incentives for businesses to keep their overseas earnings out of the country. \"Many billions of dollars of American companies' earnings do not come home because of an outdated and punitive tax system,\" Ms. Rometty wrote.\nThe change would \"free up capital that companies of all sizes can reinvest in their U.S. operations, training and education programs for their employees, and research and development programs,\" the letter continues.\nIBM in 2015 spent more than half its annual $5.4 billion annual research and development budget in the U.S.\nIBM also supports Mr. Trump's proposed investment in infrastructure such as roads, bridges, buildings and other public facilities, Ms. Rometty wrote, adding that the infrastructure's performance would benefit by the inclusion of networked sensors and artificial intelligence, technologies that IBM offers.\nSimilarly, Ms. Rometty in her letter suggested reducing health-care costs through the use of information technology and data analytics. IBM said it operates one of the largest employer-sponsored health plans in the U.S. Health-care costs could be reduced by analyzing data to detect fraudulent Medicare claims, she wrote, citing a 2009 IBM position paper.\nMs. Rometty's letter also called for giving veterans the best health care possible. IBM recently announced a pilot program to help Department of Veterans Affairs oncologists treat 10,000 veterans using genomic analysis powered by Watson, the company's artificial-intelligence computing system.\nWrite to Rachael King at rachael.king@wsj.com\n 08:35 ET (13:35 ",

      "text": "IBM Invests $200M to Help Clients Respond to Cybersecurity Incidents [November 16, 2016] Tweet \nCAMBRIDGE, Mass. , Nov. 16, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- IBM Security (NYSE: IBM ) today announced a major expansion of its incident response capabilities, including new facilities, services and software as part of a $200 million investment made this year. These investments include a new global security headquarters in Cambridge, Mass. which features the industry's first physical Cyber Range for the commercial sector, where participants experience preparing for and responding to cyber attacks using live malware and real-world scenarios. \nIBM also expanded capabilities and capacity for its global network of IBM X-Force Command Centers which now handle over 1 trillion security events per month. These security operations centers are staffed by 1,400 security professionals who will use cognitive technologies like Watson for client services, including chat sessions and data delivery, as well as Watson for Cybersecurity to quickly address cyber security events. \nAs part of today's announcement, IBM launched a new elite incident response and intelligence consulting team called IBM X-Force Incident Response and Intelligence Services (IRIS). IBM's investments also includes its acquisition of Resilient Systems earlier this year , a pioneer in the incident response market. \nA new Ponemon Institute study on Cyber Resilience, sponsored by IBM and also announced today , found 75 percent of IT and security professionals surveyed say their organization does not have a modern incident response plan applied across the entire enterprise. This lack of planning and coordination can make it difficult to respond quickly and contain the costs of an incident. For example, in 2018, companies in the UK must report data breaches to regulators within 72 hours or face fines up to 4 percent of their global annual turnover. \n\"Being prepared to respond is the first line of defense in making sure a cyber security incident doesn't become a crisis,\" said Marc van Zadelhoff , General Manager, IBM Security. \"To adequately prepare for –and respond to – cyber attacks, companies need to assemble cross-functional teams that bring a strategic mix of security intelligence, technical skill, legal precision and regulatory understanding combined with a comprehensive plan of action. With our investments, we've moved IBM into a unique position in the industry with a comprehensive cybersecurity immune system for customers to build world-class capabilities for thwarting cybercrime.\" \nIBM X-Force Command Centers and New Cyber Range \nIBM Security's new headquarters in Cambridge , located at 75 Binney Street, includes a fully operational \"Cyber Range,\" bringing together capabilities and experiences previously only available in the public sector. IBM's new X-Force Command Cambridge Cyber Range immerses people in simulated cyber attacks to train them on how properly prepare for, respond to, and manage a broad variety of threats. This experience can be leveraged by Chief Information Security Officers and their security teams, as well as those withut security expertise, such as other members of the C-Suite/lines of business, board members, students and others. \nIBM's Cyber Range uses live malware, ransomware and other real-world hacker tools culled from the dark web to deliver realistic cyber attack experiences. The facility features an air-gapped network of a fictitious corporation, used for simulated attacks, consisting of one petabyte of information, more than 3,000 users and a simulated version of the internet. \nAs part of the Cyber Range experience, IBM has designed real-world scenarios to help clients experience, defend against and shut down cyber attacks. The scenarios will also help train organizations with the necessary steps required to respond quickly in the wake of an incident, from addressing regulatory requirements that vary from country to country and state to state, to client, business partner, media and supply chain notifications and management. \nAs part of today's announcement, IBM also launched IBM X-Force Command Center Atlanta, a fully upgraded security operations center which IBM has operated for 15 years. The facility now handles over 35 billion security events per day – a 75 percent increase in capacity. \nIBM X-Force Command Center Atlanta is a hub for the company's network of SOCs, which help protect 4,500 clients across 133 countries. Using IBM X-Force Threat Intelligence, the security operation centers bring in 200,000 new pieces of threat intelligence daily, by leveraging insights from analysis on over 100 million web pages and images, and collecting data from monitoring 270 million endpoints. \nIBM also has expanded its capacity to handle security events and intelligence for IBM X-Force Command Centers in Bangalore and Poland , complemented by previously modernized IBM centers in Costa Rica and Tokyo , creating a scalable global network of defense for clients. \nNew IBM X-Force IRIS Team of Elite Security Consultants IBM also launched a new incident response and intelligence consulting team called IBM X-Force IRIS . Led by Wendi Whitmore , Global Lead, IBM X-Force IRIS the team includes over 100 elite cybersecurity consultants positioned throughout the globe, with deep expertise in incident response and threat intelligence. \nWhitmore has built the IBM X-Force IRIS team by bringing together security consultants with a broad spectrum of experience , including those who have led responses to many of the largest cyber security breaches in the past decade. Their response experience has spanned retail, political and international banking networks. Many members of the new team are former security experts at federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies where they built intelligence collection and analysis capabilities which are still in use today. \nThe IBM X-Force IRIS team further expands IBM's incident response capabilities, building on the services announced in February. The new consulting capabilities, with the incorporation of IBM X-Force intelligence services, will help clients understand where and how cyber attacks are being launched to defend against and remediate them with greater speed and precision. \nWith a focus on preparedness and planning, the IBM X-Force IRIS practice helps clients test their environment, run attack scenarios, and identify key business systems and processes needing stronger security and critical to maintaining resiliency. Through an emphasis on proactive planning, IBM X-Force IRIS can help clients reduce the costs and complications of response, which can help lead to quicker containment of an incident. \nThe IBM X-Force IRIS's capabilities include: Proactive incident response planning and preparedness training Incident simulation and tabletop exercises, including Red Teaming / Blue Teaming A concurrent approach to containment, remediation and threat intelligence Forensic analysis Threat Intelligence analysis \nBuilds on Resilient Systems' Pioneering Incident Response Technology Resilient, an IBM Company, provides a software platform for comprehensive incident response management and orchestration – designed to help security professionals manage and respond to incidents faster and more intelligently. The platform has agile playbooks based on National Institute of Standards and Technology and SANS Institute standards that cover potential threats from a lost laptop to malware attacks. It also has the one of the largest privacy databases with global breach notifications to help clients maintain compliance. This enables clients to mitigate cyber incidents more quickly while helping minimize their exposure. \nResilient Systems' award-winning platform is a foundational component of IBM's incident response technologies, along with IBM's QRadar Security Intelligence. \nFor more information on or to arrange a visit to the IBM X-Force Command Center Cyber visit: http://www.ibm.com/security/xforcecommand \nAbout IBM Security IBM Security offers one of the most advanced and integrated portfolios of enterprise security products and services.

      "text": "November 16, 2016 at 13:19 PM EST IBM's The Weather Company adding 400 jobs and relocating its headquarters within Atlanta \nATLANTA , Nov. 16, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Gov. Nathan Deal and The Weather Company, an IBM (NYSE: IBM ) Business, today announced the company, which delivers up to to 40 billion forecasts daily, will relocate its headquarters within Atlanta and is hiring an additional 400 people as it prepares to grow its services that already provide accurate, personalized and actionable weather data and insights to millions of consumers and thousands of businesses around the world. \n\"The Weather Company has made significant contributions in Georgia for more than three decades,\" Governor Deal said. \"The company's decision to expand its workforce in the metro Atlanta area is a reflection of our state's ability to retain dynamic companies with our business-friendly environment and highly skilled workforce. We look forward to our ongoing relationship with The Weather Company and its continued success in Georgia .\" \nThe Weather Company, which was acquired by IBM in January, helps some of the world's biggest brands in aviation, energy, insurance and media as well as government anticipate and respond to weather's impact on their operations. It connects newscasters, airline pilots, energy traders, insurance executives, state agency employees, retail management and more to the weather intel they need. \n\"The combination of technology and expertise from The Weather Company and IBM is progressing well as we create additional value for the clients of both companies,\" said Cameron Clayton , CEO and General Manager, The Weather Company. \"The additional hiring and the move to a new headquarters are indicative of the support and investment that IBM is providing to attract and retain the best and brightest as we build this amazing business.\" \nRelocation of The Weather Company's headquarters to Perimeter Summit at 1001 Perimeter Summit Boulevard is expected to begin in late spring of next year. Jobs being added include positions in software and product development, engineering, technology and marketing, among others.The Weather Company provides weather data and insights via Weather's API, its business solutions division, and its own digital products from The Weather Channel (weather.com ) and Weather Underground ( wunderground.com ). \nEarlier this year, The Weather Company announced plans to advance the precision and accuracy of weather forecasting by combining hyper-local, short-term custom forecasts developed by IBM Research with The Weather Company's global forecast model. The powerful combination of the two models is called Deep Thunder, which also uses historical weather data to train machine learning models to help businesses predict the actual impact of weather. \nEvery day, The Weather Company's sophisticated models analyze data for worldwide locations using more than 100 terabytes of third-party data daily and Weather Underground's network of more than 200,000 personal weather stations. Combining that enormous volume and variety of data with advances in atmospheric and computational sciences enables The Weather Company to produce one of the most reliable global forecasts available today. \nAs it announced the acquisition of The Weather Company in January, IBM said it will use The Weather Company's technology and expertise to serve as the foundation for the Watson Internet of Things Cloud platform, building on a $3 billion commitment IBM made in 2015 to invest in the Internet of Things. The acquisition extended the scale and capability of IBM's cloud data services platform and expanded The Weather Company's enterprise services capabilities and consumer reach to a global scale, including plans to bring weather.com to new major markets such as China and India . \nThe Weather Company worked closely with the Georgia Department of Economic Development (GDECD), the Metro Atlanta Chamber and Georgia Power in the selection of its new headquarters location.\"We are excited that The Weather Company, a leader in the technology industry, is expanding their operations here,\" said GDEcD Commissioner Pat Wilson . \"We thank The Weather Company for their growth and confidence in the Atlanta area, and look forward to supporting them as they continue to provide weather data to millions of consumers and thousands of businesses around the world.\" \nThe Weather Company, an IBM Business \nThe Weather Company, an IBM Business, is the world's largest private weather enterprise, helping people make informed decisions -- and take action -- in the face of weather.

      "text": "International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) said on 27 October that it is buying Bengaluru-based Sanovi Technologies Corp. for an undisclosed sum ( bit.ly/2faHWUK ). Just a couple of days earlier, another Bengaluru-based company, NxtGen Datacenter and Cloud Technologies Pvt. Ltd, announced a strategic partnership with enterprise cloud services provider Nutanix Inc. to develop, market and sell hosted private cloud services and a cloud-based disaster recovery (DR) model from NxtGen’s nine data centres across India. ( bit.ly/2fcOKy4 )\nThese developments once again put the spotlight on DR as a service (DRaaS), a segment which is witnessing growing traction among enterprise users.\nOutsourcing data recovery to a third-party provider in a cloud model, rather than set up one’s own data centres for the purpose, is increasingly catching on with enterprises globally as well as in India. Cloud computing allows companies to pay for software modules or services used over a network, typically the Internet, on a subscription basis.\nBusiness continuity refers to an organization’s capability to carry on business as usual, or with minimum disruption, in the event of an untoward incident or calamity.\nAccording to research firm Gartner Inc.’s Magic Quadrant for Disaster Recovery as a Service report published in June 2016, “In recent years, IT disaster recovery (DR) as a whole and DRaaS specifically have gained momentum for small and midsize organizations due to improved affordability and functionality. Gartner estimates the DRaaS market will nearly triple in the next three years to a revenue point of $3.4 billion by 2019. In addition, DRaaS Interest has grown significantly among large enterprises during the past year, as Gartner witnessed a 77% increase in inquiries from these organizations throughout 2015.” ( bit.ly/2avRrIo )\nAs companies face increasing business risk due to factors such as natural disasters, sabotage and terrorism, the ability to move operations to secondary facilities—in effect the data centres that act as the hub of all enterprise activity in a connected world—quickly, reliably and cost-effectively is becoming more critical than ever.\nWhat’s more, chief information officers (CIOs) and other information technology (IT) decision makers need to free themselves up from routine tasks such as taking backups in order to spend more time on innovation.\nRitu Madbhavi, CIO of FCB Ulka Advertising Pvt. Ltd, for one, believes that activities such as DR, back-up, storage, and replication are highly manpower-oriented and time-consuming—things that should function as pure hygiene rather be on a CIO’s agenda ( bit.ly/2fDleE2 ). She moved backup and DR to the cloud, on Microsoft Corp.’s Azure cloud platform.\nCIOs across sectors are increasingly looking at the cloud as a workable option to move not just the plain old email but other tasks too such as back-up, DR and software applications for payroll and customer relationship management.\nThey are being wooed primarily by two types of vendors competing in the DRaaS market. One is the large, so-called “horizontal” cloud service providers such as Google, Amazon Web Services, Microsoft and IBM. The other set comprises specialists in this segment such as Sanovi, Axcient Inc., Bluelock Llc, Sungard Availability Services, Commvault Systems Inc., Veeam Software and many others.\nDespite the market gaining maturity, however, the associated complexities are posing challenges for IT decision makers in choosing the right-fit DR solution for their particular business. According to the Gartner report cited above, “Even though substantial market growth and increased provider service maturity have occurred, it is still difficult for many organizations to know whether they are making appropriate decisions or asking all the right questions of prospective DRaaS providers. These providers all offer a wide range of supported server platforms, service onboarding methodologies, recovery time service levels and different pricing policies.”\nAnother challenge, according to Gartner, is that the use of a DRaaS provider does not mean that internal IT departments are no longer responsible or accountable for successful recoveries. This implies that CIOs and their lieutenants will have to work closely and actively with the cloud providers to “manage recovery assurance”. As such, how the CIOs sift through, negotiate and monitor service level agreements with DRaaS providers will assume greater significance.\nGartner further cautions that service-level commitments of providers may vary by configuration size and required computing platforms. Problems may also arise due to platform interoperability issues—which may occur when a company wants to move from one service provider to another—in case of lack of open application programming interfaces or accepted standards in this domain.\nOther analyst firms concur on the need to take a precautionary approach. Ovum Consulting, in its report Ovum Decision Matrix: Selecting a Data Availability and Protection Solution for the Cloud Era, 2016-17 , points out, “Cloud computing and the move to an as-a-service delivery method is also beginning to create tensions and splits in organizations’ data protection and availability strategies, with questions being raised about location, security, and latency (delay in movement of data through a network.). The issue for CIOs is that these technologies need to be administered and configured correctly to provide solutions to the many different requirements for resiliency that organizations demand.”",

      "text": "| Share \n2017 and Beyond: How Digital Innovation Will Impact the World \nThis week is artificial intelligence (AI) week, and all week we’ll be seeing announcement after announcement from artificial intelligence vendors about improved performance and capability in AI technology. More important to me is how this will change our lives. I spent some time last week talking to IBM about how its partnership with NVIDIA and its advancements with Watson and OpenPOWER will be changing the world around us . We spoke about a number of artificial intelligence trends and several stood out for me. Artificial Intelligence and Credit Card Security \nEvery year, financial institutions write of billions in losses due to credit card fraud, and a great deal of focus has been placed on stopping this steady drip, drip, drip of illegal cost. Currently, systems are advanced enough to do four fraud checks at the time of the transaction, but they simply aren’t enough to stop the flood of people cloning, stealing and skimming credit cards to steal money. \nAccording to these institutions, the massive increase in performance that IBM and NVIDIA are promising will allow them to raise significantly the number of fraud checks they do at transaction and, even more effectively, select dynamically the checks they are doing to better address each individual situation. This will make it nearly impossible for people and criminal organizations to game the system and effectively eliminate most of the credit card fraud going on. This dynamic capability will allow these AI systems to adapt in real time to new threats and mitigate them on the fly. In one big step, this could, for all practical purposes, make credit card fraud a thing of the past. Artificial Intelligence and Physical Security \nWe know that perimeter protection in electronic security is no longer effective, but we often don’t talk about the fact that it generally doesn’t work for physical security either. People can jump fences, tailgate others with security cards, clone security cards, steal security cards and use them to gain access to areas they aren’t allowed in. And legitimate employees steal stuff. With AI and deep learning, security systems can more effectively be used to catch people who are where they shouldn’t be in real time, through facial recognition. By being able to scan faces, people who shouldn’t have the cards and who wander into areas that they aren’t authorized to enter can be immediately flagged, and access to systems and equipment can be electronically and physically denied with security guards, electronic locks, ties into system security and even robots. This can allow the physical resources to be more effectively used to not only curtail theft but to potentially eliminate it and to automate things like calls for help, both for the breach and to get first responders to the location of an attack or even natural disaster or accident more quickly. \nSecurity guards make mistakes. Increasingly, these AI-guided, deep learning facial recognition systems will not. Artificial Intelligence and Health Care \nHealth care is one of the areas where AI and deep learning have been most targeted. The ability to quickly see a pattern in symptoms and winnow down the number of possible causes was one of the initial focuses of IBM Watson, and its performance has been impressive. However, training has been daunting. The announced advancements will massively reduce the resources needed to train a Watson system and that should help spread its availability to patients all over the world. Artificial Intelligence and Personal Assistants \nOne of the problems with personal assistants like Amazon Alexa, Microsoft Cortana and Apple Siri is that they are relatively stupid and, as a result, fall far short of their promise. These new deep learning systems, when placed behind a personal assistant, will make them smarter, not only with regard to parsing and responding to questions but in anticipating the needs of users and seeming increasingly alive, making them more effective companions. This could address a wide range of needs, from helping keep users from getting depressed, to calling for help more often and more effectively when they sense a user’s need, to becoming a more effective advertising and sales tool for the firms deploying them. And, as they integrate with these other systems, they could also be used to guide users to safety before users even know they are at risk, notify them more effectively if their home or car is being broken into, and even help prevent health problems or suggest timely remedies. We’ve barely touched the surface here. Wrapping Up: We’ve Barely Touched the Surface in AI \nThese are just a few examples of how these higher performing deep learning and AI systems backed by artificial intelligence vendors IBM and NVIDIA will change the world around us. I didn’t touch on how they’ll be used to improve things like discovery for the legal profession, potentially turning small firms into powerhouses, as these services are offered as a cloud service, to vastly accelerating self-driving cars, trucks, and automated drones to change transportation and delivery forever, or how they will change entertainment in ways that will make the old Star Trek Holodeck look limited by comparison. We are rapidly moving into an amazing new future, a time when instead of having to learn how to work the systems around us, these systems will learn how to work better with us, and where instead of reacting to a crisis or problem, these systems anticipate and mitigate without human intervention. \nThanks to firms like IBM and NVIDIA, prepare for a world we aren’t even remotely ready for yet. \nRob Enderle is President and Principal Analyst of the Enderle Group, a forward-looking emerging technology advisory firm.

      "text": "Ton Ngo / @tango245 / November 16, 2016 / 0 comments \nCo-authored with Winnie Tsang (IBM), Ricardo Rocha (CERN), Spyros Strigazis (CERN) \nThe OpenStack community has been developing support for containers for over two years since the Paris Summit. Containers are now alive and well on OpenStack: not only can users easily deploy containers but OpenStack services themselves have been well containerized, as evident in projects such as Kolla and OpenStack Ansible. The next natural question is, how do containers scale? In other words, what happens when ten of thousands containers are deployed in the cloud? And how do they perform? \nWe set out to answer these questions in a collaboration between two teams from IBM and CERN, with assistance from a team from Rackspace who also participated in the CERN Openlab collaboration. Of course to study scalability, we need access to large OpenStack environments. Fortunately, the CERN lab was able to run some tests on part of their large OpenStack cloud, and the CNCF lab provided a 100 nodes cluster for the study. The CERN cloud ran the Mitaka release while the CNCF cloud ran the Newton release. \nWe have presented the results we have found so far at the last OpenStack Summit in Barcelona; you can view the video from this link: \nIn this blog, we describe the key findings from that presentation. \nWe consider 3 perspectives: \nFirst, the infrastructure in OpenStack to host the containers must be created. This is the scope of Magnum, the OpenStack service that manages container infrastructure by creating all the necessary resources such as VM/baremetal nodes, storage, networking, etc. The type of container infrastructure includes clusters for Kubernetes, Swarm, or Mesos. The question here is, how well does OpenStack deploy these container infrastructures at scale? \nSecond, once the infrastructure is up and running, the containers are deployed. This is the scope of the particular container platform, i.e. Kubernetes, Swarm, or Mesos. The question at this level is, how well do these platforms deploy containers on OpenStack on a large scale? \nThird, once the containers are running, the apps running in the containers will handle the workload that they are designed for. The scope at this level is specific to the app. The question is, how does the app running in containers on OpenStack perform at scale? \nFor our benchmarks, we use Rally for the first two scenarios, using a plugin designed for driving Magnum, Kubernetes, Swarm, and Mesos. For the third scenario where an app is measured, we use a benchmark from Google: many nginx containers serve web requests generated by a load driver. Google has published performance characteristics from the benchmark, allowing us to compare with result from OpenStack. \nIn the first scenario, we attempted to deploy various combination of many small clusters or a few large clusters. Magnum handles the requests by launching Heat templates which in turn create and configure all the OpenStack resources. We found that Magnum does not generate a heavy load and so it is itself not a bottleneck. However, Heat does have to handle a large number of nested templates and does exhibit signs of problems at the point of around 200 medium sized clusters. This limitation was a focus topic at a design session with the Heat team at the Barcelona Summit. We also found RabbitMQ to be a bottleneck, and this is consistent with observations from others. In fact, there were multiple presentations at the Summit on experiences with Rabbit as well as techniques to alleviate the bottleneck. Overall, it became apparent that scalability for container infrastructure is really a general OpenStack scalability issue. If your OpenStack cloud has been tuned to scale well, then there should be no problem with scaling the infrastructure for containers. \nIn the second scenario, we measured how the 3 container platforms deploy containers. This work is still ongoing and we don’t have the complete data yet, but some interesting observation did emerge. The time to deploy containers is similar on Kubernetes and Swarm, but is significantly higher on Mesos. The reason is that Mesos only manages the resources, therefore a framework such as Marathon is needed to manage the actual containers. In the current Mesos implementation, a container request is sent to Marathon, then Marathon needs to go through a negotiation protocol with Mesos to obtain a resource offer and to start the Docker container. This overhead suggests that Mesos is appropriate as a container platform when resources need to be shared among multiple workloads. Running Marathon alone on Mesos to deploy Docker containers would not be efficient. In a previous talk, we have shown how to run both Kubernetes and Swarm containers on the same Mesos cluster: \nhttps://www.openstack.org/videos/video/mesos-and-openstack-the-perfect-tag-team-for-containers \nIn the third scenario, we created a Kubernetes cluster with 800 vCPU, as indicated by the Google benchmark. As the replication controller scaled up the pods running nginx, we found that the cluster easily handled 1 million requests per second from the load driver. With larger clusters, we have observed up to 3 million requests per second. This result matches the data published by Google and suggests that once the infrastructure and the containers are in place, the container app performs as well on OpenStack as on other platforms. \nThe result so far is encouraging, suggesting that there is no fundamental issue with scaling containers on OpenStack. But our scalability study is continuing. We are testing container app benchmark for Swarm and Mesos, similar to the Google benchmark. We are experimenting with techniques to tune Rabbit and Heat find the best practices for scalability. In future tests, we want to measure performing key lifecycle operations on the cluster while the cluster is handling a significant load. This includes operations such as scaling the cluster, upgrading the cluster, and upgrading a running service by updating its image. \nWe will share more result in future presentation and blogs.

They can use live malware, ransomware , and other hacking tools to stage realistic cyberattacks.\nIBM said in a statement that it is the first privately operated facility of its kind. It's built around the intranet of a fictitious corporation, with more than one petabyte of information and more than 3,000 users.

Of those with a CSIRP in place, 52% have either not reviewed or updated the plan since it was put in place, or have no set plan for doing so. 41% say the time to resolve a cyber incident has increased in the past 12 months, compared to only 31% who say it has decreased. 74% say they faced threats due to human error in the past year When examining the past two years, 74% say they have been compromised by malware on a frequent basis, and 64% have been compromised by phishing on a frequent basis 68% don’t believe their organizations have the ability to remain resilient in the wake of a cyberattack 66% aren’t confident in their organization’s ability to effectively recover from an attack 25% have an incident response plan applied consistently across the organization. 23% have no incident response plan at all Only 14% test their incident response plans more than one time per year 66% cite a lack of planning as their organization’s biggest barrier to becoming resilient to cyberattacks 48% say their organization’s Cyber Resilience has either declined (4 percent) or not improved (44%) over the past 12 months 41% say the time to resolve a cyber incident has increased or increased significantly, while only 31% say it has decreased or decreased significantly In 2015, the average cybersecurity budget was $10 million. This increased to an average of $11.4 million. More funding has been allocated to cyber resilience-related activities. In 2015, 26% of the IT security budget was allocated to cyber resilience related activities. This increased to 30% in 2016. \n+More on Network World: Phishing scheme crimps El Paso for $3.2 million + \nMost organizations represented in this research experienced a data breach in the past year. Fifty-three percent of respondents say their organization experienced a data breach involving the loss or theft of more than 1,000 records containing sensitive or confidential business information in the past two years. Of those breached, 57% of respondents say they had more than one data breach in the past two years. \nCheck out these other hot stories:",

      "text": "Markets Today Nvidia's Deals with IBM, Microsoft and Google Strengthen Its Artificial Intelligence Lead Though competition abounds, Nvida's GPU investments and software ecosystem are big advantages in a booming market for powering AI tasks. Eric Jhonsa Nov16,20165:35PMEST \nNvidia's ( NVDA ) spectacular earnings and guidance last week provided good evidence that the GPU leader is on its way to making the powering of artificial intelligence workloads a 10-figure annual business. \nSince then, it hasn't wasted time announcing moves that grow its AI ecosystem and could help keep hungry rivals at bay. \nOn Monday, Nvidia and IBM ( IBM ) announced the latter is rolling out a software toolkit called IBM PowerAI for IBM servers containing Nvidia's Tesla accelerator cards, which are widely used to handle a popular type of AI known as deep learning. \nIBM also rolled out a new server, the Power S822LC, that's optimized for AI and other high-performance computing (HPC) workloads: It pairs Big Blue's mammoth Power8 CPUs with Tesla accelerators and Nvidia's NVLink high-speed GPU interconnect. \nThat day, Nvidia also announced it's teaming with Microsoft ( MSFT ) on a solution that lets businesses create AI workloads by using Microsoft's Cognitive Toolkit software on systems containing Tesla GPUs. The solution is available both via Microsoft's Azure public cloud platform, and for corporate data centers through Nvidia's Tesla-powered DGX-1 HPC system. \nAnd on Tuesday, Nvidia and Microsoft disclosed Azure server virtual machines (VMs) that feature Tesla GPUs are now generally available to Azure cloud computing users, four months after launching in preview mode. This comes less than two months after Amazon ( AMZN ) unveiled cloud computing VMs that support up to 16 Tesla GPUs. Prev 0 of 3 Next If you liked this article you might like",

      "text": "IBM’s editorial director, Michela Stribling, kicks off Session 1 at TED@IBM: Spark, November 16, 2016 in San Francisco. (Photo: Russell Edwards/TED)\nFrom artists to scientists, mothers, mathematicians and business visionaries, people in every corner of the world are dreaming up solutions to our most pressing problems. Whether tackling war and peace or the principles of machine learning, ingenuity starts with one thing: a spark.\nAnd regardless of where the spark takes hold, inspiration demands action to reach its greatest potential. At the third installment of TED@IBM — part of the TED Institute , held on November 15, 2016, at the SFJAZZ Center in San Francisco — a diverse and brilliant collection of speakers and performers dared to ask: What if we used our collective expertise and insights to provide a spark that could change the world for good?\nAfter opening remarks from Michela Stribling, IBM’s editorial director, the talks in Session 1 challenged us to think about how we can work together to solve problems and, maybe, leave the planet better than we found it.\nWhere light meets sound. In a performance that blurs the boundaries of light and sound, Ryan and Hays Holladay create a visual experience of beats and tones shaped around reverberations of color. With multicolored projections and an assortment of carefully placed lamps, the brothers transcribe their music across the illuminated bursts of surfaces suddenly made visible. Here, music becomes the performer, rather than the performance, directing us not toward itself but toward the tempo and rhythm that orchestrates its narration. It’s a melody as much seen as it is heard: a series of intonations whose colorful pattern of sound eventually collapses into the nearly faded spotlight of a solitary lamp.\nThe answer to fighting cybercrime. Cybercrime netted $450 billion in profits last year, with 2 billion records lost or stolen. As the vice president at IBM Security, Caleb Barlow recognizes the insufficiency of our current strategies to protect our data from the ultra-sophisticated criminal gangs that are responsible for 80 percent of all cyber attacks. His solution? When a cyber attack occurs, we should respond to it with the same collective effort and openness as a health care crisis — we need to know who is infected and how the disease is spreading. Last year, Barlow and his team started publishing all of IBM’s threat data in an effort to encourage the same sharing from other major corporations, governments and private security firms. If we’re not sharing, he says, then we’re part of the problem.\nAccording to Adam Grant, there are three basic kinds of employees: givers, takers, and matchers (who’ll match the prevailing behavior of the group). The key to a happy workplace is to balance that mix. Grant speaks at TED@IBM: Spark. (Photo: Russell Edwards/TED)\nOne bad apple spoils the bunch. The success of any company is defined by the quality of people who work there. Organizational psychologist Adam Grant has spent a lot of time analyzing business structures, and he’s concluded that there are three different types of employees: givers, takers and matchers. To achieve a balanced workplace with equal opportunity for and distribution of work, power and play, companies must endeavor to hire givers and matchers, whose personalities allow employees to feel supported, heard and acknowledged. The challenge is to stop takers from getting a seat at the table, because they so often undercut the spirit of collaboration workplaces need to thrive.\nThe business of rewriting stereotypes. After what felt like a lifetime spent simultaneously living out stereotypes and being imprisoned by them, Villy Wang wondered how she could break the cycle of racism and still make a living. She hit upon the idea of empowering young, diverse kids — those most misrepresented in the media — to become storytellers, training them in filmmaking so they can create new, authentic stories. After training, she helps place them into creative industries that influence media and entertainment, helping rewrite stereotypes at one of its sources. Wang has nested this entire program within a professional media production studio, a business that helps fund and ensure the future of the program. “Obviously, racism is deeply rooted in our history, politics, media and language,” she says, “but I believe if we can empower more diverse kids to take that narrative and change it, we will break hold of these ugly roots.”\nPerformer Ise Lyfe, at right, breaks down the Bay Area’s gentrification battles in a spoken-word collaboration with cellist Michael Feckses, performed at TED@IBM: Spark. (Photo: Russell Edwards/TED)\nWe are not mud, we are fertile ground. Spoken-word artist and activist Ise Lyfe sparks crucial dialogue on social justice through performance. With music accompaniment by master cellist Michael Feckses , Lyfe unravels the impact of the displacement of minority communities in American cities, threaded from his personal experience in East Oakland. By using the image of a flag in the mud to convey the claiming of a muddy territory, Lyfe creates a symbol for gentrification but urges: “I reject the notion of your flag in our mud. Let us be the spark to convey. We are not mud, we’re fertile ground waiting on the rain.”\nAI and justice for all. You need a good lawyer if you’re involved in a legal case. But a typical case can cost thousands of dollars in legal fees — and a lot of that money goes toward the time it takes to learn the case and study the law around it, sifting through hundreds of documents and databases to find a winning angle. Lawyer and entrepreneur Andrew Arruda set out to democratize this process by partnering with a computer scientist to create the world’s first artificially intelligent lawyer, ROSS. Using ROSS, a lawyer can search through millions of documents in a matter of minutes, saving hours of research time. ROSS is already being rolled out, for free, to pro-bono lawyers who are helping those most in need. “Justice should cost the same for everyone,” Arruda says. “More money should not buy better justice.”\nIntelligence, knowledge and wisdom … in the age of smart machines. Artificial intelligence is a next step in the evolution of our species; some say, in fact, we have come to the limits of our own intelligence. But intelligence is only part of the story — it’s what we do with that intelligence that matters. In a special video created for TED@IBM , Guruduth Banavar, chief science officer of cognitive computing at IBM, asks us to cultivate the wisdom necessary to improve our future.\nAn organic approach to an organic problem. Beset by plunging biodiversity, pathogens and skyrocketing populations, our global food supply is at risk — but solutions that rely on chemicals and genetically modified organisms come with their own problems. Computational geneticist Laxmi Parida proposes instead that we use the genetic biodiversity that already exists within plants, wrought over millennia by evolution, in order to safeguard our food. To sort through and make sense of the vast amount of sequenced DNA, artificial intelligence and machine learning don’t quite make the cut. Parida has another technique in mind: discrete mathematics. Using math, Parida is cracking open our understanding of the links between DNA and external traits, like stress resistance, so we can breed more robust crops while reducing strain on the environment.\nBuilding with dust. The world-changing promise of nanotechnology remains just that — a promise. We don’t yet have the disease-fighting nanobots, elevators to space or quantum computers that nanotech could someday provide. Why? Because building things from nanomaterials is incredibly difficult, says George Tulevski , a nano architect and researcher at IBM. We don’t have tools small enough to manipulate nanomaterials into something useful. But Tulevski and his team think they’ve located the missing link: chemistry. They’re developing chemical processes to compel billions of nanoparticles to simultaneously assemble themselves into the patterns needed to build circuits, much the same way that natural organisms like Radiolaria build intricate, diverse and elegant structures. It’s like building a sculpture from dust, Tulevski says, and it may be the key to delivering on — or far exceeding — those original promises of nanotechnology.\nBehavior hacks for the well-intentioned. “Why is it that we have such a difficult time doing what’s right?” asks behavioral scientist Bob Nease . “It’s because intention and action don’t often go hand-in-hand.” That is, good intentions don’t always lead to good behavior, while bad behavior is not always the result of bad intentions. So how do we bridge the gap between good intention and positive action? Nease offers two simple mind-hack solutions: first, make the right thing so easy to do that it requires minimal mind power to arrive at a good decision. Then make the wrong thing so drawn out and convoluted that it’s nearly impossible to justify doing. Nease applies these principles to current issues surrounding health, business and even government reform.\nWorld music group Wobbly World led off Session 2 of TED@IBM: Spark with a musical celebration of collaboration that included singing, rapping, guitar, congas and much more.

Time. An early cancer diagnosis can be the difference between a chance to fight for life, or death. But diagnostic tools tend to be costly, invasive and slow to reveal results, and they’re not always totally accurate. Cancer fighter Joshua Smith presents an affordable, formidable weapon in the fight against cancer that combats these statistics — a noninvasive early-warning system that works like a pregnancy test by intercepting and analyzing the biomarkers that may hint at the presence of cancer. With this streamlined process, says Smith, early-stage cancer detection can happen more frequently and start when a person is still healthy. It’s a strong beacon of hope in the fight against cancer.\nWe can’t afford to give up on government, says Charity Wayua. She speaks at TED@IBM:Spark. (Photo: Russell Edwards/TED)\nHow to cure ailing governments. In the current political climate, it’s easy to want to give up on transforming government, says public sector researcher Charity Wayua — but we can’t afford to be afraid to tackle challenges like government efficiency head-on. Starting in 2014, Wayua, a trained biochemist, and a team of scientists, engineers and technologists began to “treat” the government of Nairobi, Kenya, as an ailing patient in order to restore the health of the country and its economy. In keeping with a biomedical approach, the team examined the government, its divisions, its employees and every single one of its malfunctions before making a diagnosis and devising a strategic treatment plan. Within two years, the efforts of Wayua and her team paid off, and Kenya moved from 136 to 92 on the World Bank’s index ranking the ease of doing business there. As Wayua says, just because something is sick doesn’t mean it’s dying.\nThe drumming habits of neurons. In March 1993, an article published in the journal Cell identified the single gene responsible for Huntingon’s disease. The product of a nearly ten-year effort by scientists from around the world, the article held great promise that a cure for the neurodegenerative disorder would soon follow; yet today, there is still not a single medicine able to slow, stop, or reverse this disease. James Kozloski has watched a generation of neuroscientists struggle with this, and his conclusion is that neuroscientists have focused far too long on just the neuron. He argues that the answer lies not only in showing how neurons suffer from genetic disorders but also in how genes suffer from nervous disorders. Comparing the communication of neurons to the beat of a drummer, Kozloski highlights that in brains, things like a bad gene, an injury or aging can lead to changes in circuits that first create and then reinforce subtle bad drumming habits, which are often difficult to detect until it’s too late. His team has been working to detect these habits early in order to break them, mapping the brain’s core components and connecting them together in what he calls the Grand Loop. “Before we can fully understand how genes cause imbalance in neurons leading to their death,” he says, “neuroscience must understand how the brain’s core circuitry balances itself, how genes change synapses, and how brain feedback onto neurons, synapses and genes can push imbalance to the tipping point.”\nHow the internet of things is transforming the routine. How do we protect our aging population while letting them keep the comfort of their lives and their daily routine? Everyday objects with sensors and WiFi can track each step of that routine and form a picture of a life being lived, in real time, to the children and support systems caring for the safety and independence of their loved ones. Learn more about how the internet of things is changing the routine in another special video produced for TED@IBM .\nA library of human cognition. What if you could consult Winston Churchill on a looming international crisis? Or ask Einstein what he thinks about the latest scientific breakthrough? National security expert Juliane Gallina is working on a way to harness the best minds of all time to make the world safer. When Gallina was in the military, she learned a special concept: the OODA loop, a mental model (which stands for Observe, Orient, Decide, Act) designed to help intelligence officers get into the minds of their adversaries. You’re in the OODA loop right now, Gallina says, and every person or team that makes decisions is constantly using it. Today, Gallina is a technologist, and she’s using the OODA loop in her work on cognitive computing. Her goal: to create a way to systematically record the way we think when solving problems so that future generations can better tap into the wisdom of the past. “Let’s find and record the exquisite thinking strategies of innovators and pioneers,” Gallina says, “and then let’s use it.”\nThe untold story behind a landmark NASA mission. Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughn, Mary Jackson — you’ve probably never heard their names, but these three African-American women were instrumental in putting astronaut John Glenn into orbit around Earth. Their story has been largely untold until now with the upcoming release of biographical film Hidden Figures . Elizabeth Gabler, president of Fox 2000 Pictures, talks with TED@IBM curator Bryn Freedman about what drew her to make film and shares with the audience more about the women from the upcoming film and the barriers they overcame.\nNo expertise required. The problem with music, says Tim Exile , is that it’s so perfect. For those of us who didn’t grow up playing an instrument, instruments can never be objects of play because we’re often too afraid to mess around and try things out due to a strict idea of what an instrument should sound like. In a talk-performance hybrid, Exile demos a software instrument that he designed to allow anyone, whether they have musical training or not, to record loops, mix sounds and make music. “Apart from anything else,” he says, “this is is a hell of a lot of fun, and we’re all missing out!”\nGrady Booch asks us to worry a bit less about artificial intelligence, while speaking at TED@IBM: Spark. (Photo: Russell Edwards/TED)\nThe illusion of intelligence. When we think about artificial intelligence and its possibilities, it becomes difficult to disassociate the concept with the dangers outlined by films like The Terminator and 2001: A Space Odyssey . For supporters like Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking, such fears are far from misplaced; they and others argue that artificial intelligence represents an existential threat to humanity. But according to Grady Booch , super-knowing is not the same as super-doing. Cognitive systems, he argues, are far different from the software-intensive systems of earlier generations, in that, “by and large, we don’t program them: we teach them,” imparting onto those machines reflections of our already-present human values. Rather than worry about any existential threat of superintelligence, Booch cautions us to focus instead on the realities that we currently face, “for the rise of computing already brings to us a myriad of other human and societal issues to which we must attend.” Indeed, from raising the level of education around the world to helping humans eventually reach the surface of Mars, “the right question we should now be asking is how shall we best use this technology to augment our humanity, not diminish it.”",

      "text": "IBM researchers have developed a computer system it believes is more effective at identifying a form of skin cancer than expert dermatologists. × IBM diagnoses skin cancer with a computer IBM researchers have developed a computer system it believes is more effective at identifying a form of skin cancer than expert dermatologists. \nWASHINGTON – The smartphone is on a collision course with your local dermatologist. \nIBM researchers have developed a computer system it believes is more effective at identifying a form of skin cancer than expert dermatologists. The technology is young, and IBM said it must prove itself in more tests. The findings are a harbinger of when we turn to computers rather than humans for more affordable and better health care. \nThe IBM system was given photos of skin lesions taken with a smartphone attachment designed for dermatologists. Costs for this device, called a Dermascope, run from $100 to $1,400. The IBM computer then compared the images to its database of skin cancer photos and estimated the likelihood the lesion was melanoma. The computer was more accurate — 76 percent — than eight expert dermatologists (70 percent.) \nThe paper, which is available online, will also be published in a 2017 issue of the IBM Journal of Research and Development. \nIBM’s computer relies on artificial intelligence to make its decisions. The system was fed hundreds of images labeled as skin cancer, so it could realize the appearance and characteristics of dangerous skin lesions. The exposure to hundreds of pictures helps the computer suss out the underlying traits of what appears to be cancerous and what’s harmless. \nThis isn’t simply a case of man vs. machine. The computer system was trained with photos, which came from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration, that humans labeled as cancerous. IBM’s approach to diagnosing skin cancer still leaves room for human dermatologists to train the computer system. \nNoel Codella, an IBM Research scientist and author of the research, said tools like this one could help a physician quickly check how risky a skin lesion is and refer a patient to a dermatologist as needed. Expert dermatologists aren’t always available and can be expensive. IBM’s computer system may eventually work as a stand-in. \nCodella declined to say when the technology would be made available to the public and described it as still a research project. \nIBM is not the only company harnessing cameras and computers to improve health care. \n“You have all these phones everywhere with very powerful computers inside them,” said Modiface founder and CEO Parham Aarabi. “Using them to help doctors is a really good cause.” \nAarabi’s startup Modoface, which is the brains behind an app from Vichy, provides recommendations about whether someone needs to moisture their skin. \nModiface’s artificial intelligence also powers beauty apps that lets consumers see how cosmetics might look on them or how a Botox treatment would change appearance. \nModiface found skin roughness can be easily identified with the camera on a smartphone, but it had a tougher time telling a part acne and dark spots on the skin. \n“This doesn’t replace doctors – it aids them,” Parham said. “The best technology helps them become efficient, and better and faster at what they do.” 38.907192 -77.036871 ",

      "text": "Nvidia's ( NVDA ) spectacular earnings and guidance last week provided good evidence that the GPU leader is on its way to making the powering of artificial intelligence workloads a 10-figure annual business.\nSince then, it hasn't wasted time announcing moves that grow its AI ecosystem and could help keep hungry rivals at bay.\nOn Monday, Nvidia and IBM ( IBM ) announced the latter is rolling out a software toolkit called IBM PowerAI for IBM servers containing Nvidia's Tesla accelerator cards, which are widely used to handle a popular type of AI known as deep learning.\nIBM also rolled out a new server, the Power S822LC, that's optimized for AI and other high-performance computing (HPC) workloads: It pairs Big Blue's mammoth Power8 CPUs with Tesla accelerators and Nvidia's NVLink high-speed GPU interconnect.\nThat day, Nvidia also announced it's teaming with Microsoft ( MSFT ) on a solution that lets businesses create AI workloads by using Microsoft's Cognitive Toolkit software on systems containing Tesla GPUs. The solution is available both via Microsoft's Azure public cloud platform, and for corporate data centers through Nvidia's Tesla-powered DGX-1 HPC system.\nAnd on Tuesday, Nvidia and Microsoft disclosed Azure server virtual machines (VMs) that feature Tesla GPUs are now generally available to Azure cloud computing users, four months after launching in preview mode. This comes less than two months after Amazon ( AMZN ) unveiled cloud computing VMs that support up to 16 Tesla GPUs.",

      "text": "Top of the Order:\nListen Up: When you become the president of the United States, there is no shortage of people wanting to tell you how to do your job. Heck, with two months to go until he takes office, President-elect Donald Trump is already hearing it from the 60.8 million Americans who voted for him , never mind the 61.8 million citizens who cast their ballots for Hillary Clinton.\nIt’s a tough gig. You are the boss, but you also have 325 million bosses, too. You need to “listen” to everyone, but let’s be frank here — not everyone’s voice is going to carry the same weight when it comes to determining the nation’s policies on everything from military alliances to dealing with ISIS to, eventually, pardoning the White House Thanksgiving turkey. You have to heed the words of those who really know what they are talking about when it comes to finally making a decision. And then make it.\nIt’s the same situation when it comes to dealing with the business of the nation’s businesses. And if there is a company that defines “Business” in America, it has to be IBM.\nSure, IBM doesn’t have the flash of a Tesla, nor does it have the general consumer appeal of an Apple. But this is still a company that cranked out almost $82 billion in revenue last year, and that employs close to 380,000 people, with a significant number of those in Silicon Valley and at the tech giant’s home base of Armonk, N.Y. So when IBM Chief Executive Ginni Rometty has something to say about business in America, yeah, it might be worth a listen.\nAnd does she ever have something to say to President-elect Trump.\nIn an open letter that she sent to Trump, and posted on IBM’s corporate policy site , Rometty laid out a series of “suggestions” under six different topic headings, including using data to cut down on inefficiency and waste, applying lessons from the private sector to improve health care and health care processes, and one of the keystones of Trump’s campaign, improving the nation’s infrastructure.\n“As we build big, let’s also build smart. The country should focus on infrastructure investments that incorporate ‘internet of things’ technology and artificial intelligence to improve performance,” Rometty wrote. “And as infrastructure gets smarter, it also increases the need for cybersecurity, so that vital networks cannot be compromised. We recommend that your infrastructure package include incentives for states and localities to build intelligent — and secure — roads, bridges, buildings and other public facilities.”\nBut probably the most notable point in Rometty’s letter was the one that came right off the bat: The creation of what Rometty called “new collar” jobs, or “entirely new roles in areas such as cybersecurity, data science, artificial intelligence and cognitive business.”",

      "title": "IBM Security Expands Incident Response Capabilities with $200M Investment",
      "text": "Print Subscribe \nIBM Security announced a major expansion of its incident response capabilities, including new facilities, services and software as part of a $200 million investment made this year. These investments include a new global security headquarters, which features the industry’s first physical Cyber Range for the commercial sector, where participants experience preparing for and responding to cyber-attacks using live malware and real-world scenarios. \nIBM also invested in expanded capabilities and capacity for its global network of IBM X-Force Command Centers. These security operations centers are staffed by 1,400 security professionals who will use cognitive technologies like Watson for client services, including chat sessions and data delivery, as well as Watson for Cybersecurity to quickly address cyber security events. The new capabilities are also part of expanded security analytics capacity to IBM centers in Atlanta, Bangalore and Poland, which now handle over 1 trillion security events per month. These facilities are complemented by previously modernized IBM command centers in Costa Rica and Tokyo, creating a scalable global network of defense for clients. \nAs part of today’s announcement, IBM also launched a new elite incident response and intelligence consulting team called IBM X-Force Incident Response and Intelligence Services (IRIS). IBM’s investment also includes its acquisition of Resilient Systems earlier this year, a pioneer in the incident response market. Advertisement \nA new Ponemon Institute study on Cyber Resilience, sponsored by IBM and also announced today, found 75 percent of IT and security professionals say their organization does not have a modern incident response plan applied across the entire enterprise. This lack of planning and coordination makes responding with the speed and precision required to contain the costs of from an incident difficult. For example, in 2018, companies in the UK must report data breaches to regulators within 72 hours or face fines up to 4 percent of their global annual turnover. \n“Being prepared to respond is the first line of defense in making sure a cyber security incident doesn’t become a crisis,” said Marc van Zadelhoff, General Manager, IBM Security. “To adequately prepare for –and respond to – cyberattacks, companies need to assemble cross-functional teams that bring a strategic mix of security intelligence, technical skill, legal precision and regulatory understanding combined with a comprehensive plan of action. With our investments, we’ve moved IBM into a unique position in the industry with a complete immune system for customers to build world-class capabilities for thwarting cybercrime.” \nIBM X-Force Command Centers and New Cyber Range IBM Security’s new headquarters in Cambridge includes a fully operational “Cyber Range,” bringing together capabilities and experiences previously only available in the public sector. IBM’s new X-Force Command Cambridge cyber range immerses people in simulated cyber-attacks to train them on how properly prepare for, respond to, and manage a broad variety of threats. This experience can be leveraged by Chief Information Security Officers and their security teams, as well as those without security expertise, such as other members of the C-Suite/lines of business, board members, students and others. \nIBM’s X-Force Command cyber range uses live malware, ransomware and other real-world hacker tools culled from the dark web to deliver realistic cyber-attack experiences. The facility features an air-gapped network of a fictitious corporation, used for simulated attacks, consisting of one petabyte of information, more than 3,000 users and a simulated version of the internet. \nAs part of the cyber range experience, IBM has designed real-world scenarios to help clients experience, defend against and shut down cyberattacks. The scenarios will also help train organizations with the necessary steps required to respond quickly in the wake of an incident, from responding to regulatory requirements that vary from country to country and state to state, to client, business partner, media and supply chain notifications and management. \nAs part of today’s announcement, IBM also launched IBM X-Force Command Atlanta, a fully upgraded security operations center which IBM has operated for 15 years. The facility now handles over 35 billion security events per day — a 75 percent increase in capacity. \nIBM X-Force Command Center Atlanta is a hub for the company’s network of SOCs, which help protect 4,500 clients across 133 countries. Using IBM X-Force Threat Intelligence, the security operations centers bring in 200,000 new pieces of threat intelligence daily, by leveraging insights from analysis on over 100 million web pages and images, and collecting data from monitoring 270 million endpoints. \nNew IBM X-Force IRIS Team of Elite Security Consultants IBM also launched a new incident response and intelligence consulting team called IBM X-Force IRIS. Led by Wendi Whitmore , Global Lead, IBM X-Force IRIS the team includes over 100 elite cybersecurity consultants positioned throughout the globe, with deep expertise in incident response and threat intelligence. \nWhitmore has built the IBM X-Force IRIS team by bringing together security consultants with a broad spectrum of experience, including those who have led responses to many of the largest cyber security breaches in the past decade. Their response experience has spanned retail, political and international banking networks. Many members of the new team are former security experts at federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies where they built intelligence collection and analysis capabilities which are still in use today. \nThe IBM X-Force IRIS team further expands IBM’s incident response capabilities, building on the services announced in February. The new consulting capabilities and the addition of expanded intelligence services, use IBM’s X-Force Threat Intelligence network to help clients understand where and how cyberattacks are being launched to defend against and remediate them with greater speed and precision. \nWith a focus on preparedness and planning, the IBM X-Force IRIS practice helps clients tests their environment, runs attack scenarios, and identify key business systems and processes needing stronger security and critical to maintaining resiliency. Through an emphasis on proactive planning, IBM X-Force IRIS can help to reduce the costs and complications of response, leading to quicker containment of an incident. \nThe IBM X-Force IRIS’s capabilities include: · Proactive incident response planning and preparedness training · Incident simulation and tabletop exercises, including Red Teaming / Blue Teaming · A concurrent approach to containment and threat intelligence · Forensic analysis · Threat Intelligence analysis \nBuilds on Resilient Systems’ Pioneering Incident Response Technology Resilient, an IBM Company, provides a software platform for complete incident response management and orchestration – enabling security professionals to manage and respond to incidents faster and more intelligently. The platform has agile playbooks based on National Institute of Standards and Technology and SANS Institute standards that cover potential threats from a lost laptop to malware attacks. It also has the one of the largest privacy databases with global breach notifications to ensure compliance. This enables clients to mitigate cyber incidents more quickly while helping minimize their exposure. \nResilient Systems’ award-winning platform is a foundational component of IBM’s incident response technologies, along with IBM’s QRadar Security Intelligence. \nIBM operates one of the world’s broadest security research, development and delivery organizations, monitors 35 billion security events per day in more than 130 countries, and holds more than 3,000 security patents. 27",

      "text": "IBM CEO Offers Advice To Trump -- WSJ  48:  By Rachael King \nInternational Business Machines Corp. CEO Ginni Rometty published an open letter to President-elect Donald Trump outlining her recommendations on health care, infrastructure spending and other issues. \nThe letter is her first comment on the prospect of a Trump administration since Mr. Trump, shortly before the election, criticized IBM and other companies for shifting U.S. jobs overseas. \nThe Donald J. Trump for President organization didn't immediately reply to a request for comment. \nSilicon Valley generally has viewed Mr. Trump's victory as a blow to the tech industry, as the president-elect has been a critic of Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. as well as IBM. \nAmong other technology executives, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos offered Mr. Trump congratulations in a message on Twitter, as did Salesforce.com CEO Marc Benioff, while Microsoft Corp. CEO Satya Nadella posted a congratulatory message on LinkedIn, with a link to a longer blog post by the company's president and chief legal officer. \nMr. Trump, in a Nov. 6 campaign speech in Minnesota, said IBM had laid off 500 workers in Minneapolis and moved their jobs to India and other countries. Mr. Trump also called out Ford Motor Co. and MoneyGram International Inc. for laying off workers and moving jobs overseas. \n\"If a company wants to leave Minnesota, fire their workers and move to another country, and then ship their products back into the United States...we will make them pay a 35% tax,\" he said. \nFord Chief Executive Mark Fields, speaking to reporters Tuesday, said the company would stick with plans to assemble cars in Mexico but would continue to discuss the situation with the incoming administration. A 35% tariff \" would be harmful, I think, to the entire industry and the economy and therefore we want to engage in a very productive set of discussions,\" Mr. Fields said. \nThe letter from IBM's Ms. Rometty offers support for another of Mr. Trump's proposals, to end tax-code incentives for businesses to keep their overseas earnings out of the country. \"Many billions of dollars of American companies' earnings do not come home because of an outdated and punitive tax system,\" Ms. Rometty wrote. \nThe change would \"free up capital that companies of all sizes can reinvest in their U.S. operations, training and education programs for their employees, and research and development programs,\" the letter continues. \nIBM in 2015 spent more than half its annual $5.4 billion annual research and development budget in the U.S. \nIBM also supports Mr. Trump's proposed investment in infrastructure such as roads, bridges, buildings and other public facilities, Ms. Rometty wrote, adding that the infrastructure's performance would benefit by the inclusion of networked sensors and artificial intelligence, technologies that IBM offers. \nSimilarly, Ms. Rometty in her letter suggested reducing health-care costs through the use of information technology and data analytics. IBM said it operates one of the largest employer-sponsored health plans in the U.S. Health-care costs could be reduced by analyzing data to detect fraudulent Medicare claims, she wrote, citing a 2009 IBM position paper. \nMs. Rometty's letter also called for giving veterans the best health care possible. IBM recently announced a pilot program to help Department of Veterans Affairs oncologists treat 10,000 veterans using genomic analysis powered by Watson, the company's artificial-intelligence computing system. \nWrite to Rachael King at rachael.king@wsj.com (END) Dow Jones Newswires 11-17-160248ET Copyright (c) 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

      "text": "Ambika Chopra November 16, 2016 2 min read Inc42 Staff SHARES \nIBM , under its Global Entrepreneur Program is organising a startup challenge – IBM Smartcamp for Deeptech. \nB2B and B2C startups functioning for less than five years in the areas including IoT, big data & analytics, security, storage, mobile, cognitive, machine learning, blockchain, and social or cloud Infrastructure that can be used across various industries, can apply for the event. \nThe top 10 startups will get a chance to pitch their idea to enterprise VCs, IBM executives and others, and will also receive feedback for the same. They will also get to pitch their idea to enterprise CEOs in the relative industrial space and an audience of 200+ people. \nThe IBM Global Entrepreneur Program engages with startups in providing them with cloud credits worth $24K per year on Softlayer and Bluemix. The programme provides technical mentoring and assistance with go-to market solutions and a chance to work with accelerators in India. It also engages with large enterprises in helping them finding their next set of innovations. \nLast year IBM conducted a B2B Startup challenge called IBM India Smartcamp, where it went to nine cities, with three regional finals and a Grand finale; with 50+ VCs, angel investors, IBM executives as panelists and more than 60 CIOs in participation. \nIn July 2016, in association with the Edelweiss Group , it organised IBM Smartcamp for Fintech . \nIn October 2016, IBM in association with Manipal Hospitals and T-Hub organised IBM Smartcamp for HealthTech . Nine healthtech startups have been selected under the same. The first prize at the event was bagged by Oxyent Technologies, and UE LifeSciences and DailyRounds were selected as the first and second runners-up respectively. \nThe applications for the challenge will close on December 3, 2016. \nIts penultimate event, IBM Smartcamp for Smart City will host its finale in Delhi on November 18, 2016, and the event is expected to be participated by startups working in the areas of energy, agritech, and smart city planning. \n(This post is powered by IBM) Advertisement 111 SHARES  Next article  Previous article",

      "text": "Summary \nIBM has been a dog over past couple of years having done absolutely nothing for investors. \nIBM is a Dog Of The Dow as it currently yields 3.5% while the stock is up 15.8% so far this year against an S&P 500 which has gained 7.7%. \nWith nearly enough cash on the balance sheet to cover all long- and short-term debt obligations I believe IBM can reinvigorate itself through some sort of acquisition. International Business Machines (NYSE: IBM ), otherwise known as IBM has been a dog over past couple of years having done absolutely nothing for investors. In fact, over the past five years the stock is down 15% while the S&P 500 is up 73.7%! But lately I have been thinking to myself that it has to be about time this behemoth begins to move upwards. I mean Warren Buffett purchased a stake in the name, he has to see something in it, right?!? IBM has long been part of the Dogs Of The Dow investment theory because it has been a perennial high yielder. The Dogs of the Dow theory essentially has an investor purchasing the ten highest yielding stocks in the index and holding them for a year. The reason for the stocks being high yielders is because they have been underperformers for the prior year. These stocks usually end up outperforming the following year and the investor gets to keep the outsized dividend. IBM remains in the Dogs Of The Dow as it currently yields 3.5% while the stock is up 15.8% so far this year against an S&P 500 which has gained 7.7%. If we take a look at the chart below we see that it appears IBM has formed an inverse head & shoulders pattern which is usually a bullish signal. My eyes tell me that the neckline is around $150 with the head at $120. Usually with a pattern such as this one can eventually see the distance from the head to the neck to the opposite direction once the pattern is completed. Which if $150 is the neck we can tack on the $30 difference between the head and the neck to get a stock that may hit $180. Click to enlarge The stock is relatively inexpensive as it is trading 13x last year's earnings and 11.4x next year's earnings estimates. The fact that it is inexpensive on an earnings basis and that it is making a bullish pattern had me wanting to enter the stock. I'm not too concerned about the dividend either as the company is paying $5.60 annually which is covered by $12.27 in trailing earnings, or from a cash flow perspective the company has paid $5.2B over the past year in dividends off of $18.6B in operating cash flows. With the dividend yielding higher than a 10-year treasury I still believe it is a decently safe investment. The earnings and revenue growth story has been slowing down so that is a bit of a concern. But they should be able to turn things around relatively soon as they have been trying to execute their strategies on the cognitive learning side in addition to the cloud side. With nearly enough cash on the balance sheet to cover all long- and short-term debt obligations I believe IBM can reinvigorate itself through some sort of acquisition, perhaps in the cyber security arena. So what I ended up doing was putting in an options trade in the name rather than owning the stock outright. In mid-September I ended up purchasing the November $160 call but I subsidized the purchase by writing the November $165 call and November $145 put for a net credit of $0.59. If the stock expires between $145 and $160 I end up keeping the $0.59. I was hoping that in October the earnings call would have been a great catalyst for the name either by beating earnings and guiding higher or by announcing some sort of corporate restructuring such as a spinoff of the higher growth businesses into a different entity. Alas, the earnings announcement came and passed with no movement. I look forward to seeing how the trade plays out seeing that is currently sits at $159.29.

      "text": "IBM acquires Bengaluru based Sanovi Technologies Published: November 17, 2016 Share Sanovi Technologies, a Bengaluru based company providing cloud based services has been acquired by IBM which will help its Software Defined Resiliency strategy and delivery of Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery services for clients who are undergoing digital and hybrid cloud transformation. IBM will combine the Sanovi capabilities into the IBM Global Technology Services unit. Sanovi Technologies provides hybrid cloud recovery, cloud migration and business continuity software for enterprise data centers and cloud infrastructure. Through this acquisition, IBM will further empower clients to redefine their disaster recovery strategy in the face of unprecedented industry change. The addition of Sanovi’s orchestration technology to IBM’s existing resiliency portfolio offers a solution that helps simplify and automate the disaster recovery process, helps to manage recovery workflows, and can help to reduce recovery time, operating costs, and disaster recovery drill testing time. From a central dashboard, resiliency professionals can automate and monitor recovery point and time objectives in their disaster recovery environments by application, server, or database to work towards business driven recovery outcomes. IBM envisions expanding Sanovi’s Disaster Recovery Management (DRM) capabilities and enable organisations to move from business continuity planning to more proactive resiliency programs that help anticipate potential failures.",

CEMEX will deploy a suite of custom made-for-business apps, built to meet the needs of CEMEX's customers, transforming how the entire company does business from attracting new clients to collecting payments, invoicing and after-sale support.\nBeginning in early 2017, CEMEX will launch a suite of custom apps designed in collaboration with IBM iX (Interactive Experience) to create the best mobile-led customer experience in the building materials supply industry. CEMEX will follow a \"speed-to-market\" approach, launching a pilot project, followed by user testing, adjusting the solutions to meet the users' needs, and then scaling the apps worldwide. For example, a new Foreman app that will enable construction foremen to manage many aspects of their ready-mix concrete orders in real-time is currently being field tested by select CEMEX customers in several markets prior to global implementation. \n\"At CEMEX, the future for our industry will be driven by the quality of the customer experience, not just the quality of the products and services. Our customers are increasingly expecting to have the same kind of experiences in working with businesses that they have in the consumer space,\" said Fernando A. Gonzalez , CEMEX's Chief Executive Officer. \"By deploying IBM's new and innovative methods of experience design and process reinvention, CEMEX can create a superior customer experience and more readily deliver higher value to our stakeholders.\"\nCEMEX is teaming up with IBM on one of the most comprehensive digital transformation strategies undertaken in the industry, including digital experience design, digital process reinvention, agile delivery, dev-ops implementation and business process operation. The transformation will fundamentally change how foremen, field operations managers, cement masons, concrete finishers, truck drivers and other construction professionals do their jobs and interact with CEMEX.\n\"We are committed to reinventing how work gets done using IBM iX and IBM Design as the new methods to reengineer business processes. We forged our partnership with Apple to change the nature of work by combining our expertise in customer experience design with our technological acumen,\" said Jesus Mantas, General Manager, IBM Global Business Consulting Services.  \"The changes we are driving with CEMEX focus on digital reinvention and customer experience transformation at speed and scale. Our approach always starts with user experience - creating exceptionally elegant and simple ways for clients, employees and partners to better perform their jobs.\"\nCEMEX is also leveraging Mobile at Scale for iOS, a new IBM app design and development model for the rapid development and deployment of multiple iOS apps.

      "text": "  06:00 AM EST CEMEX to Digitally Transform Its Customers’ Experience in Collaboration with IBM CEMEX teams up with IBM to digitally reinvent business operations across the construction industry ecosystem \nCEMEX ( NYSE: CX ), one of the leading building materials companies in the world, and IBM (NYSE: IBM ), today announced that CEMEX will undertake a sweeping digital transformation designed to improve its operations, substantially improve its customer experience and increase business efficiencies. \nCEMEX's digital transformation will enable real-time, mobile engagement with its building materials customers and distributors—companies that build everything from sports complexes and skyscrapers to houses and high-scale infrastructure around the world. CEMEX will deploy a suite of custom made-for-business apps, built to meet the needs of CEMEX’s customers, transforming how the entire company does business from attracting new clients to collecting payments, invoicing and after-sale support. \nBeginning in early 2017, CEMEX will launch a suite of custom apps designed in collaboration with IBM iX (Interactive Experience) to create the best mobile-led customer experience in the building materials supply industry. CEMEX will follow a “speed-to-market” approach—launching a pilot project, followed by user testing, adjusting the solutions to meet the users’ needs, and then scaling the apps worldwide. For example, a new Foreman app that will enable construction foremen to manage many aspects of their ready-mix concrete orders in real-time is currently being fieldtested by select CEMEX customers in several markets prior to global implementation. \n“At CEMEX, the future for our industry will be driven by the quality of the customer experience, not just the quality of the products and services. Our customers are increasingly expecting to have the same kind of experiences in working with businesses that they have in the consumer space,” said Fernando A. Gonzalez, CEMEX’s Chief Executive Officer. “By deploying IBM’s new and innovative methods of experience design and process reinvention, CEMEX can create a superior customer experience and more readily deliver higher value to our stakeholders.” \nCEMEX is teaming up with IBM on one of the most comprehensive digital transformation strategies undertaken in the industry, including digital experience design, digital process reinvention, agile delivery, dev-ops implementation and business process operation.

      "title": "Microsoft: SQL Server for Linux is the real deal - InfoWorld",
      "text": "How IBM's Watson will change cybersecurity \nThose who wondered what it would be like to run Microsoft SQL Server on Linux now have an answer. Microsoft has released the first public preview of the long-promised product. \nMicrosoft also wants to make clear this isn’t a “SQL Server Lite” for those satisfied with a reduced feature set. Microsoft has a four-point plan to make this happen. [ The InfoWorld review: SQL Server 2016 boosts speed, analytics . | Cut to the key news in technology trends and IT breakthroughs with the InfoWorld Daily newsletter , our summary of the top tech happenings. ] \nFirst is through broad support for all major enterprise-grade Linux editions: Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Ubuntu Linux, and soon Suse Linux Enterprise Server. “Support” means behaving like other Linux applications on the distributions, not requiring a Microsoft-only methodology for installing or running the app. An introductory video depicts SQL Server installed on RHEL through the system’s yum package manager, and a white paper describes launching SQL Server’s services via systemd. \nSecond, Microsoft promises the full set of SQL Server 2016’s features for Linux users—not only support for the T-SQL command set, but high-end items like in-memory OLTP, always-on encryption, and row-level security. It will be a first-class citizen on Linux, as SQL Server has been on Windows itself. \nThird is Linux support for the tooling around SQL Server—not SQL Server Management Studio alone, but also the Migration Assistant for relocating workloads to Linux systems and the sqlps PowerShell module. This last item is in line with a possibility introduced when PowerShell was initially open-sourced : Once ported to Linux, it would become part of the support structure for other big-name Microsoft applications as they, too, showed up on the OS. That’s now happening. \nBy bringing SQL Server to Linux, Microsoft can compete more directly with Oracle, which has long provided its product on Linux. Oracle may be blunting the effects of the strategy by shifting customers toward a cloud-based service model , but any gains are likely to be hard-won . \nThe other, immediate benefit is to provide Microsoft customers with more places to run SQL Server. Enterprises have historically run mixes of Linux and Windows systems, and SQL Server on Linux will let them shave the costs of running some infrastructure. \nMost of all, Microsoft is striving to prove a Microsoft shop can lose little, and preferably nothing, by making a switch—and a new shop eyeing SQL Server has fewer reasons to opt for a competing database that’s Linux-first.

CEMEX will deploy a suite of custom made-for-business apps, built to meet the needs of CEMEX's customers, transforming how the entire company does business from attracting new clients to collecting payments, invoicing and after-sale support.\nBeginning in early 2017, CEMEX will launch a suite of custom apps designed in collaboration with IBM iX (Interactive Experience) to create the best mobile-led customer experience in the building materials supply industry. CEMEX will follow a \"speed-to-market\" approach, launching a pilot project, followed by user testing, adjusting the solutions to meet the users' needs, and then scaling the apps worldwide. For example, a new Foreman app that will enable construction foremen to manage many aspects of their ready-mix concrete orders in real-time is currently being field tested by select CEMEX customers in several markets prior to global implementation.\n\"At CEMEX, the future for our industry will be driven by the quality of the customer experience, not just the quality of the products and services. Our customers are increasingly expecting to have the same kind of experiences in working with businesses that they have in the consumer space,\" said Fernando A. Gonzalez , CEMEX's Chief Executive Officer. \"By deploying IBM's new and innovative methods of experience design and process reinvention, CEMEX can create a superior customer experience and more readily deliver higher value to our stakeholders.\"\nCEMEX is teaming up with IBM on one of the most comprehensive digital transformation strategies undertaken in the industry, including digital experience design, digital process reinvention, agile delivery, dev-ops implementation and business process operation.

They can use live malware, ransomware , and other hacking tools to stage realistic cyberattacks. \nIBM said in a statement that it is the first privately operated facility of its kind. It's built around the intranet of a fictitious corporation, with more than one petabyte of information and more than 3,000 users. IBM hopes it will better prepare its clients to recover from the type of large-scale attack that disabled much of the US Internet infrastructure for several hours last month. // Related Articles How US Army Cyber Command Pitched Camp in Augusta, Georgia \n\"Response is such a big part of security, but it's often a forgotten part of security,\" IBM Security General Manager Marc van Zadelhoff said at the facility's unveiling Wednesday, according to BostInno . Seventy-five percent of IT and security professionals that IBM surveyed said their organizations don't have a modern incident response plan in place. \nIn addition to getting critical systems back online, the response to a cyberattack typically involves notifying a company's customers in addition to alerting government authorities. The Obama administration recently issued new rules for handling cyberattacks, complete with a color-coded \"cyber incident severity schema\" reminiscent of the Bush-era Homeland Security Advisory System. \nIBM's Cambridge center is the latest addition to its security division, which already has 1,400 experts in multiple data centers around the world who use the Watson artificial intelligence platform to detect attacks.

      "text": " Google+\nJohn Mottern/Feature Photo Service for IBM\nIBM’s “Cyber Range” in Cambridge will be available free of charge to other groups who would like to test their response to hacking attacks.\nBy Curt Woodward Globe Staff November 16, 2016\nIBM’s security division has moved into a sleek new Cambridge headquarters, part of a $200 million global investment in cybersecurity products and services this year, the digital giant said Wednesday.\nThe new IBM Security facility, adjoining the company’s Watson Health offices on Binney Street in booming Kendall Square, include a state-of-the-art war room that corporate executives can use to practice their response to cyberattacks.\nAdvertisement\nThe “Cyber Range,” expected to open in January, includes a dedicated network that will not be connected to the Internet and will be used to simulate malware, denial-of-service, and other attacks on a company’s digital infrastructure.\nIBM customers are likely to have priority to use the facilities, but the company also plans to make it available free of charge to other groups who would like to test their response to possible hacking attacks, IBM vice president Caleb Barlow said.\nGet Business Headlines in your inbox: The Globe's latest business headlines delivered every morning, Monday through Friday.

Sign up for more newsletters here “Our intention, initially, is to not charge for this,” Barlow said. “We want it to be an open asset.”\nIBM’s increasing focus on cybersecurity services comes amid continued growth of malicious hacking aimed at public- and private-sector targets, including the “botnet” attack that crippled Internet infrastructure provider Dyn Inc. and the thefts of e-mails from Democratic presidential campaign operatives, which federal officials have said were tied to Russia .\nIn remarks at the office’s grand opening Wednesday, Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey said her office was notified of 3,200 data breaches last year, an increase of one-third from the year before.\nAdvertisement\n“This is an issue I lay awake at night thinking about,” Healey said. “You all know we have our work cut out for us.”\nIBM’s security division generated $2 billion in revenue in 2015. The company’s $200 million in cybersecurity spending this year includes its February acquisition of Cambridge cybersecurity company Resilient Systems and the addition of a new cybersecurity incident response team.\nIBM has acquired several other cybersecurity companies in the region, including Trusteer, Q1 Labs, Guardium, and Watchfire.\nCurt Woodward can be reached at curt.woodward@globe.com .

      "title": "Agile Content Management",
      "text": "Categorized: Digital Experience \nWhen IBM asked CIOs in the IBM Global C-Suite Study about what’s important to them now, the results were clear – top CIOs are focusing on “creating intelligent, agile cultures; wising up to the needs of customers; and rewiring the way their organizations reason.” Fully 90% of leader CIOs said they are focused on agile innovation . \nAs one CIO put it, ““We’ve been charged with speeding up time-to-market, both for the products we sell and for our own internal tools. We need to operate more like a start-up.” \nTo meet that goal, they acknowledge that they need to integrate their own strong suite of in-house IT capabilities with new skills readily available on the market. 1 \nContent Management is One Area of Focus \nAs the need to deliver relevant, effective and real-time experiences continues to grow, companies are working to create better digital/user experiences. In a recent survey, 85% of firms are investing in content management tools. 2 \n84% of businesses report that finding the right assets is the biggest challenge they have when working with digital content. Businesses can be overwhelmed by the sheer volume of images, documents and videos in their library. Content is typically housed in siloes around the organization and tracking down and accessing an asset can be a frustrating – and less than agile – process. \nAt IBM we have introduced a Cognitive Content Management system to help CIOs address some of the issues with content management. The Watson Content Hub is a new Content-as-a-Service (CaaS) solution. Working initially with IT, marketers and merchandisers will be able to manage a centralized repository of their content directly, and be able to make future updates without depending on IT. Cognitive tagging is used to make it easier to keep the content organized, and an all-new, intuitive, tablet-friendly user interface makes the service simple to use. The result — a more consistent brand experience delivered in an agile environment. \nBecause Watson Content Hub is cloud-based, finding and sharing assets is no longer a problem. Even global organizations can quickly pull content created worldwide. A corporate campaign created in one hemisphere — easily accessed by the whole organization. That costly video created last year – let’s see if we can reuse some of the opening footage. Your content group and video group in separate locations? No problem – your content is in the cloud and all can have access. And those podcasts created for mobile? Easily use clips in your new online case studies. \nOne big benefit for IT organizations is that a “headless” version of content management, like Watson Content Hub, is well suited to reusing content across multiple channels. The swagger-documented REST APIs are easy for developers to work with and content is published to Akamai content distribution network so you always get the best performance, regardless of where your clients are. By separating the content from the presentation layer, Watson Content Hub lets your development teams focus on creating a great user experience, and your business people focus on creating just the right piece of content. \nCognitive Power \nWhat makes it Watson a cognitive content system is its ability to understand, learn, and reason. Powered by IBM Watson artificial intelligence, Watson Content Hub can actually understand the content stored in it and will apply tags that describe the content, so the marketing and merchandiser will be able to manage their content more intelligently. They can review the tags that Watson recommends and add or delete tags as necessary. \nTorchbearer, or leader CiOs always have their sights set on the next big thing. The next big thing is “cognitive,” and it can be the key to meeting their objective of agile innovation today and tomorrow. \nThe Watson Content Hub is now live.

      "text": "IBM Built a Copy of the Internet for Mock Cyberattacks By PC Mag ME Team Nov. 17, 2016, 3 p.m. A new Massachusetts facility will help companies recover from attacks. \nA simulated version of the entire Internet is now live inside an IBM data center in Massachusetts, where the company plans to hold mock cyberattacks against large corporations. \nThe \"cyber range,\" located just a few blocks from MIT in Cambridge, is manned by former security experts from federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies. They can use live malware, ransomware , and other hacking tools to stage realistic cyberattacks. \nIBM said in a statement that it is the first privately operated facility of its kind. It's built around the intranet of a fictitious corporation, with more than one petabyte of information and more than 3,000 users. IBM hopes it will better prepare its clients to recover from the type of large-scale attack that disabled much of the US Internet infrastructure for several hours last month. Related Articles How US Army Cyber Command Pitched Camp in Augusta, Georgia \n\"Response is such a big part of security, but it's often a forgotten part of security,\" IBM Security General Manager Marc van Zadelhoff said at the facility's unveiling Wednesday, according to BostInno . Seventy-five percent of IT and security professionals that IBM surveyed said their organizations don't have a modern incident response plan in place. \nIn addition to getting critical systems back online, the response to a cyberattack typically involves notifying a company's customers in addition to alerting government authorities. The Obama administration recently issued new rules for handling cyberattacks, complete with a color-coded \"cyber incident severity schema\" reminiscent of the Bush-era Homeland Security Advisory System. \nIBM's Cambridge center is the latest addition to its security division, which already has 1,400 experts in multiple data centers around the world who use the Watson artificial intelligence platform to detect attacks.",

      "text": "in: Direct Release | November 17, 2016 | by: Jagat Review Direct Release: IBM and NVIDIA Team Up on World’s Fastest Deep Learning Enterprise Solution \nNew IBM PowerAI Software Toolkit Paired with NVIDIA NVLink and GPUDL Libraries Optimized for IBM Power Architecture Helps Enable 2X Performance Breakthroughs on AlexNet with Caffe \nSALT LAKE CITY, UT – 14 Nov 2016: IBM ( IBM: NYSE ) and NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) today announced collaboration on a new deep learning tool optimized for the latest IBM and NVIDIA technologies to help train computers to think and learn in more human-like ways at a faster pace. \nDeep learning is a fast growing machine learning method that extracts information by crunching through millions of pieces of data to detect and rank the most important aspects from the data. Publicly supported among leading consumer web and mobile application companies, deep learning is quickly being adopted by more traditional business enterprises. \nDeep learning and other artificial intelligence capabilities are being used across a wide range of industry sectors; in banking to advance fraud detection through facial recognition; in automotive for self-driving automobiles and in retail for fully automated call centers with computers that can better understand speech and answer questions. \nA new deep learning software toolkit available today called IBM PowerAI runs on the recently announced IBM server built for artificial intelligence that features NVIDIA® NVLink™ interconnect technology optimized for IBM’s Power architecture. The hardware-software solution provides more than 2X performance over comparable servers with 4 GPUs running AlexNet with Caffe. [1] The same 4-GPU Power-based configuration running Alexnet with BVLC Caffe can also outperform 8 M40 GPU-based x86 configurations [2] , making it the world’s fastest commercially available enterprise systems platform on two versions of a key deep learning framework. \nCaffe is a widely-used deep learning framework developed by Berkeley Vision and Learning Center (BVLC) and is recognized within the technology industry as one of the most popular deep learning community applications. Caffe is one of five deep learning software frameworks available in the IBM PowerAI toolkit. The toolkit leverages NVIDIA GPUDL libraries including cuDNN, cuBLAS and NCCL as part of NVIDIA SDKs to deliver multi-GPU acceleration on IBM servers. \nIBM PowerAI is designed to run on IBM’s highest performing server in its OpenPOWER LC lineup, the IBM Power S822LC for High Performance Computing (HPC), which features NVIDIA NVLink technology optimized for the Power architecture and NVIDIA’s latest GPU technology. The new solution supports emerging computing methods of artificial intelligence, particularly deep learning. IBM PowerAI also provides a continued path for Watson, IBM’s cognitive solutions platform, to extend its artificial intelligence expertise in the enterprise by using several deep learning methods to train Watson. \n“PowerAI democratizes deep learning and other advanced analytic technologies by giving enterprise data scientists and research scientists alike an easy to deploy platform to rapidly advance their journey on AI,” said Ken King, General Manager, OpenPOWER. “Coupled with our high performance computing servers built for AI, IBM provides what we believe is the best platform for enterprises building AI-based software, whether it’s chatbots for customer engagement, or real-time analysis of social media data.” \n“Our innovation with IBM on NVIDIA NVLink has created new opportunities for POWER in the deep learning and analytics market,” said Ian Buck, VP and GM of Accelerated Computing Group. “NVIDIA’s GPUDL libraries in PowerAI will provide world class high-performance tools to power GPU-accelerated deep learning applications.” \nIBM PowerAI is available immediately at no charge to customers of IBM’s Power S822LC for HPC server. PowerAI is designed to run on a single S822LC server and also to scale to large scale supercomputing clusters consisting of dozens, hundreds or thousands of servers. \nThe NVLink Advantage PowerAI is a set of binary distributions of popular deep learning frameworks including Caffe, Torch and Theano. Additional distributions include the IBM and NVIDIA versions of the Caffe deep learning frameworks, IBM-Caffe and NVCaffe. IBM has optimized each of the distributions to take advantage of the recently announced IBM POWER8 chip with the NVIDIA NVLink interface featured on the IBM Power S822LC for HPC server. \nThe POWER8 with NVIDIA NVLink chip is a technology-leading processor design that is the result of open collaboration between OpenPOWER Foundation members IBM and NVIDIA. The new chip enables tight integration between IBM’s POWER8 CPU server architecture and the new Pascal architecture NVIDIA’s Tesla P100 GPU accelerators. The CPUs and GPUs integrated into the Power S822LC for HPC are connected to each other via the high-speed NVIDIA NVLink interconnect. This industry-unique interface between the CPUs and GPUs, and also between the GPUs, removes potential bottlenecks created by the PCIe interface found in most Intel x86-based servers. The PowerAI toolkit of deep learning applications takes advantage of this new NVLink-based server architecture to optimize performance of the leading artificial intelligence, deep learning and machine learning applications. \nGrowing Momentum for the Power S822LC for High Performance Computing The hardware pairing for PowerAI, the IBM Power S822LC for HPC server, was launched in early September. There was immediate interest in the server, equipped with raw performance advantages, among leading research institutions, cloud service providers and business enterprises. This led to very strong demand in the third quarter, contributing to Power’s 2x year to year growth in Linux systems revenues. \nInitial client uses for the new IBM Power S822LC for HPC servers include: Human Brain Project – In support of the Human Brain Project, a research project funded by the European Commission to advance understanding of the human brain, IBM, and NVIDIA deployed a pilot system at the Juelich Supercomputing Centre as part of the Pre-Commercial Procurement process. Called JURON, the new supercomputer leverages Power S822LC for HPC systems. Cloud provider Nimbix – HPC cloud platform provider, Nimbix expanded its cloud supercomputing offerings this month, putting IBM Power S822LC for HPC systems with PowerAI in the hands of developers and data scientists to achieve enhanced performance. City of Yachay, Ecuador – Ecuador’s “City of Knowledge,” Yachay, is a planned city designed to push the nation’s economy away from commodities and towards knowledge-based innovation. Last week the city announced it is using a cluster of Power S822LC servers to build the country’s first supercomputer for the purpose of creating new forms of energy, predicting climates, and pioneering food genomics. SC3 Electronics – A leading cloud supercomputing center in Turkey, SC3 Electronics announced last month at the OpenPOWER Summit Europe that it is creating the largest HPC cluster in the Middle East and North Africa region based on Power S822LC for HPC servers. \nTo download IBM PowerAI, go to www.ibm.biz/powerai . \nTo learn more about the IBM Power S822LC for High Performance Computing server, go to: www.ibm.biz/s822lc-hpc . \nTo learn more about NVIDIA deep learning, go to www.nvidia.com/deeplearning . \n# # # (1) Based on AlexNet Training for Top-1 50% Accuracy.

      "text": "Security 66% of organizations won't recover after cyberattack, study says IBM and the Ponemon Institute's 2016 Cyber Resilient Organization study found that cyber resilience among enterprise organizations is dropping. By Conner Forrest | November 17, 2016, 8:48 AM PST Google Plus Image: iStockphoto/FotoMaximum \nA recent study performed by IBM's Resilient and the Ponemon Institute found that 66% of organizations would be unable to recover from a cyberattack. The results of the 2016 Cyber Resilient Organization study were released Wednesday, and show a decline in organizational resilience against cyberattacks. \nOf the respondents, 32% of IT and security professionals ranked their resilience as high. That same number was 35% in 2015, marking a drop over the past 12 months. A press release announcing the study defined resilience as \"an organization's ability to maintain its core purpose and integrity in the face of cyberattacks.\" \nOne of the biggest hindrances to effective security listed by respondents was the lack of a proper cyber security incident response plan (CSIRP). However, it should be noted that Resilient provides incident reporting services. \nSEE: Information security incident reporting policy (Tech Pro Research) \n\"While companies are seeing the value of deploying an incident response plan, there is still a lag in having the appropriate people, processes, and technologies in place,\" Larry Ponemon said in the press release. \"We are encouraged that this is becoming a more important part of an overall IT security strategy.\" More about IT Security Subscribe to TechRepublic's Cybersecurity Insider newsletter \nThe next highest barrier to proper resilience, as listed by 66% of respondents, was \"insufficient planning and preparedness.\" The report also noted that 46% listed \"complexity of IT processes\" as something that kept their organization from achieving resilience. That number is up from 36% last year. \nThe study also looked at what type of security incidents the respondents were experiencing. Some 53% reported that they had dealt with at least one data breach in the past two years. Over that same period, 74% said their organization had experienced threats as a result of \"human error,\" the release said. \nMalware (74%) and phishing (64%) topped the list of frequently-experienced attacks. And, while most respondents were not confident in their organization's ability to recover from an attack, 68% believed their organization could at least remain resilient. \nIn all, 2016 has seen some of the worst cyberattacks in recent history. With the DYN DDoS attack taking out many major web properties and other high-profile attacks, it's no wonder companies are losing confidence in their security. The 3 big takeaways for TechRepublic readers A new study from IBM and the Ponemon Institute claims 66% of organizations would likely be unable to recover from a cyberattack. Insufficient planning and complexity of IT and business were listed as top reasons for companies being unable to properly respond to an attack. More than half of respondents have dealt with a data breach in the last two years. Stay informed, click here to subscribe to the TechRepublic Cybersecurity Insider newsletter. Subscribe",

      "text": "By Rachael King\nInternational Business Machines Corp. CEO Ginni Rometty published an open letter to President-elect Donald Trump outlining her recommendations on health care, infrastructure spending and other issues.\nThe letter is her first comment on the prospect of a Trump administration since Mr. Trump, shortly before the election, criticized IBM and other companies for shifting U.S. jobs overseas.\nThe letter offers support for some of Mr. Trump's policies and advice on national issues -- adding along the way that IBM is the largest technology employer in the U.S. Last year IBM hired more U.S. employees than in the five years prior, the letter said, and it has thousands of open positions.\nThe Donald J. Trump for President organization didn't immediately reply to a request for comment.\nSilicon Valley generally has viewed Mr. Trump's victory as a blow to the tech industry, as the president-elect has been a critic of Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. as well as IBM.\nAmong other technology executives, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos offered Mr. Trump congratulations in a message on Twitter, as did Salesforce.com CEO Marc Benioff, while Microsoft Corp. CEO Satya Nadella posted a congratulatory message on LinkedIn, with a link to a longer blog post by the company's president and chief legal officer.\nMr. Trump, in a Nov. 6 campaign speech in Minnesota, said IBM had laid off 500 workers in Minneapolis and moved their jobs to India and other countries. Mr. Trump also called out Ford Motor Co. and MoneyGram International Inc. for laying off workers and moving jobs overseas.\n\"If a company wants to leave Minnesota, fire their workers and move to another country, and then ship their products back into the United States...we will make them pay a 35% tax,\" he said.\nFord Chief Executive Mark Fields, speaking to reporters Tuesday, said the company would stick with plans to assemble cars in Mexico but would continue to discuss the situation with the incoming administration. A 35% tariff \"would be harmful, I think, to the entire industry and the economy and therefore we want to engage in a very productive set of discussions,\" Mr. Fields said.\nThe letter from IBM's Ms. Rometty offers support for another of Mr. Trump's proposals, to end tax-code incentives for businesses to keep their overseas earnings out of the country. \"Many billions of dollars of American companies' earnings do not come home because of an outdated and punitive tax system,\" Ms. Rometty wrote.\nThe change would \"free up capital that companies of all sizes can reinvest in their U.S. operations, training and education programs for their employees, and research and development programs,\" the letter continues.\nIBM in 2015 spent more than half its annual $5.4 billion annual research and development budget in the U.S.\nIBM also supports Mr. Trump's proposed investment in infrastructure such as roads, bridges, buildings and other public facilities, Ms. Rometty wrote, adding that the infrastructure's performance would benefit by the inclusion of networked sensors and artificial intelligence, technologies that IBM offers.\nSimilarly, Ms. Rometty in her letter suggested reducing health-care costs through the use of information technology and data analytics. IBM said it operates one of the largest employer-sponsored health plans in the U.S. Health-care costs could be reduced by analyzing data to detect fraudulent Medicare claims, she wrote, citing a 2009 IBM position paper.\nMs. Rometty's letter also called for giving veterans the best health care possible. IBM recently announced a pilot program to help Department of Veterans Affairs oncologists treat 10,000 veterans using genomic analysis powered by Watson, the company's artificial-intelligence computing system.\nWrite to Rachael King at rachael.king@wsj.com\n 17, 2016 02:48 ET (07:48 ",

      "title": "IBM Sells Somers Campus For $31.75 Million",
      "text": "0 Read / Add Comments \nSOMERS, N.Y. -- IBM has sold its longtime campus in Somers for $31.75 million, according to records from the Westchester County Clerk's office. \nThe sale, through a deed transfer was agreed to on Sept. 29, while the transaction was recorded with the clerk's office on Oct. 18. The deal also included payment of a $127,000 transfer tax. \nScant information is known about the site's buyer other than its legal name and hired representatives. \nThe buyer is a Delaware-based limited liability company called 294 Route 100, LLC. The name merely matches the campus' address, which is 294 Route 100. \nNo information about the company's ultimate owners (whether beneficial or for a parent company) could be found in the transfer document or in a Delaware corporations search, the latter of which shows that the entity was formed in July. \nThe only contact information pertaining to the buyer that is publicly available is for two companies that serve as its representatives: a title-transfer company listed in the deed-transfer and a registered agent in Delaware, which is listed in its corporate filing abstract. \n\"I don't know who the owners are,\" Somers Supervisor Rick Morrissey told The Journal News , which first reported the sale. \"Our main concern as a town is that we maintain our tax base. If there's another taxpayer that bought it, I have no problem with that.\" \nThe sale price for the property is a steep discount from its full market value, which is the town's estimate of the property's worth for tax purposes. \nThe town, in its current assessment roll, gives the campus a full market value of $122,150,943. The campus has 723.08 acres, according to the assessment roll, and carries an assessed value (taxable value) of $16,185,000. \nThe campus has entrances and exits that connect to Route 100, Route 138 and Route 116. \nIBM announced in May that it was looking to sell the campus and to move staff out of it next year. Staff will be reassigned to the tech giant's North Castle campus. \nMorrissey, when he reacted to IBM's departure announcement in May, wrote on Facebook that the company's headcount in Somers had been going down over time and that multiple buildings on the campus had been mothballed. \nIn a separate transaction, IBM is in contract to sell property on the other side of Route 100 to the Somers Fire District. That property contains the current New York State Police barracks. The fire district is looking to build a new firehouse on the site as a replacement for its facility along Route 202; plans call for sharing space with state police, which would become a tenant of the fire district. \nThe IBM campus' sale is the second major transaction to upend Somers' corporate landscape. Last year, the owner of the PepsiCo site sold its campus, which straddles Routes 100 and 35, to a company linked to Mexican business tycoon Carlos Slim as an investor, published reports noted. \nThat company was sold by a subsidiary of MHP Real Estate Services in a deal valued at nearly $87 million. \nThe legal purchasing entity for the PepsiCo site deal is called One P Way, LLC, although its parent company is Sebastian Capital, a real-estate acquirer and asset-manager for outside investors. \nSebastian Capital is seeking to rent out PepsiCo's former office building - it has dubbed the place \"Westchester Campus\" - and proposes developing 220 housing units. It has not filed an application with the town for the housing component. Share this story",

      "text": "DAILY VIDEO: IBM opens global headquarters for security services; IoT devices evolving rapidly as favorite DDoS attack tool, experts say; Google, Facebook act to keep ads off of known 'fake news' sites; and there's more. \n\nToday's topics include the official opening of IBM's new security services headquarters in Massachusetts, security experts’ warnings that the cyber threats to the Internet of Things will only increase, Google and Facebook’s plan to block advertising traffic to fake news sites and Microsoft’s announcement that it is now a Platinum member of the Linux Foundation. \nIBM is officially opening its new global security headquarters in Cambridge, MA, providing a new base of operations for the company's $2 billion a year security business. \nAlong with the new headquarters, IBM is opening what it calls the industry's first \"commercial Cyber Range,\" which is a cyber-threat simulator to train clients who need to learn how to deal with cyber-attacks. IBM is also launching a new Incident Response and Intelligence Services team. \nAfter massive Distributed Denial of Service attacks in October, security experts are warning that the relative lack of security of the Internet of Things will continue to make connected devices favored targets of attackers looking to create botnets to drive DDoS traffic to new unprecedented scales. \nOn Nov 16 security experts testified before two subcommittees in the U.S. House of Representatives, warning Congress that a lack of focus on security has made the Internet of Things a playground for hackers. \nThe hearing follows the October attacks against Internet-infrastructure provider Dyn, which struggled for more than 11 hours to mitigate a flood of data that caused its domain services to become unreachable and resulted in intermittent service outages for its clients, including Twitter, Netflix, Etsy, Paypal and Spotify. \nGoogle this week joined Facebook in announcing that it would restrict revenue-generating advertisements from being placed on websites purveying fake news. \nThe move appears to be in response to the criticism that both companies have received in recent days for allowing some websites to distribute fake news pertaining to the recent U.S. presidential election. \nSome believe that the false reports, a majority of them unfavorable to presidential contender Hillary Clinton, played a role in President-Elect Donald Trump's victory. \nGoing forward, Google will also restrict ad service on pages that misrepresent, misstate or conceal information about the publisher, the primary purpose of the website or the publisher's content. \nIn a move that would have been unthinkable a decade ago, Microsoft today announced it is becoming a Platinum member of the Linux Foundation. As a Platinum member, Microsoft will provide $500,000 a year to the Linux Foundation and pledges to support the group's open-source and Linux efforts. \nMicrosoft has been moving incrementally toward embracing Linux and open source over the past eight years, though the interaction with the Linux community initially was somewhat hostile. \nNow, however, Microsoft's $500,000 yearly Platinum membership dues will help the Linux Foundation in its many efforts to advance Linux and open-source technology.",

Assign resources to the CICS system. Use a template to tailor the CICS service Publish the service in our Marketplace Use that service to create a CICS region and start it. Deprovision the CICS region once it is no longer required. \nWe explain the basic terms that are associated with the cloud services and which roles play a part in creating, using, and maintaining a cloud service. We show you how we used IBM z/OSMF to provision a CICS Transaction Server (TS) System Management Single Server (SMSS) in a controlled laboratory environment. \nThe goal of this paper is to provide you with an overview of how a cloud service can be created and used on z/OS. This paper is intended for infrastructure support staff and application development staff who require middleware to develop and maintain business applications that use middleware.

      "text": "News Town of Ulster prohibits further demolition at old IBM site pending cleanup Freeman file photoA parking lot in front of the former IBM-Kingston main building in the town of Ulster is jam-packed with cars in 1978. By William J. Kemble, # Comments Photo by William J. Kemble Demolition work proceeds last December at TechCity Building B025 in the town of Ulster. \nTOWN OF ULSTER >>TechCity will not be allowed to demolish the iconic IBM Building 001 on Enterprise Drive until debris from the other six structures has been completely removed from the property, town officials said. \nAt a Town Board meeting Thursday, town Supervisor James Quigley said the demolition permits have lapsed and only the remaining section of Building 034 will be allowed to be taken down. \n“I will allow them to take 034 down because it’s half down now,” he said. “As long as they’re making substantial progress on the cleanup of the middle, they can take 034 down, subject to receiving a permit.” \nTown officials in September 2015 approved demolition permits for seven buildings without requiring a cleanup plan for the property. They noted that a debris removal deadline had not been requested because there has never previously been a project of that size to use as a precedent. Advertisement \nBuildings that were scheduled to come down were B025 at 277,571 square feet, with a $6,626,506 market value; B001 at 274,928 square feet and $2.41 million market value; B002 at 48,267 square feet and $575,904 market value; B003 at 274,291 square feet and a $2.41 million market value; B004 at 41,748 square feet and a $1.2 million market value; B034 at 8,364 square feet and a $120,482 market value; and B035 at 18,181 square feet and a $150,602 market value. \nQuigley said TechCity representatives have said they would have the debris removed by the end of the year. He said it is difficult to judge how much material is still on the property because it is spread out and mounds change positions as material is sorted. \n“I can’t gauge it,” Quigley said. “If you look at Building 025, which (was) the four-story building on the corner of Boice’s (Lane) and Enterprise Drive, in comparison to where it was four months ago when they had those humongous piles of debris that had basically the carpet and the roof fabric just piled up there and it looked really ugly, that’s all gone and you’ve got a clean slab except three piles of crushed concrete.” \nQuigley said a contractor does want to take the crushed concrete and is waiting for the state Department of Environmental Conservation to determine if the material is acceptable to be used as fill. \n“If you go to the center where the manufacturing buildings were that were built in the 1950s, there’s still large piles of metal and there’s still piles of unprocessed concrete,” he said. “They’re still in the process of loading out and taking the metals to the recycling yard. If you drive in there you will see that they’re processing the concrete through a screener to separate the sizes.”",

      "text": "While testifying at a recent House of Representatives hearing , IBM adviser and Harvard University lecturer Bruce Schneier contended that appliances connected to the internet deserve a strong set of federal regulations and standards. Similar to the way the federal government regulates automobiles, Schneier put forth an argument for a creation of an entirely new government agency in light of recent cyber attacks and threats — he also wasted no time in referencing how quickly the Department of Homeland Security was created in the wake of 9/11. To him, “everything is a computer” and should be treated and defended as such.\n“This is not a phone [gesturing with his smartphone], this is a computer that makes phone calls, your refrigerator is a computer that keeps things cold, an ATM machine is a computer with money inside, your car is not a mechanical device with a computer but a computer with four wheels and an engine,” Schneier pointed out. “And this is the Internet of Things. And this is what caused the DDoS attack we’re talking about.”\nSchneier’s presence on Capitol Hill was for a hearing to examine how connected devices participated in recent hacks such as the October 21 hit on Netflix and Twitter. Congress’ part in the hearing was not only to better understand what happened but also to devise a reasonable solution for protecting smart appliance owners and businesses without overreaching. Texas Republican Rep. Michael Burgess acknowledged that many consumers don’t even realize “ they need strong protection on everyday devices ,” pointing out how the most regularly used password is “password.”\nView photos\nHarvard lecturer Bruce Schneier thinks any connected device coul be susceptible to hacks More Harvard lecturer Bruce Schneier believes any connected device could be susceptible to hacks\nBill Roberson/Digital Trends\nUnfortunately, it appears as though House Republicans such as Burgess aren’t particularly keen on approving an entirely new agency. Although it would provide Americans with the peace of mind of being protected by their government, the cost to actually create the agency would set the U.S. back a hefty billion or two.\n“Regulation needs to be a cop on the beat. People do need to know that they are protected, but there does need to be a light touch,” Burgess added. “We ought to be enforcing current laws before we write new ones.”\nThough while the ball appears unlikely to start rolling on a new agency, the hearing did see a bipartisan moment in which both sides of the aisle agreed on the idea that the public needs to practice better online hygiene (as they called it). Instead of settling on a four-digit passcode such as 1234, utilizing a system capable of creating stronger authentication is paramount as cyber warfare becomes more prevalent.\n“There’s always been a role for passwords, but in general passwords have outlived their usefulness,” Schneier acknowledged. “There are many other systems that give us more robust authentication. I like the world where the internet can do whatever it wants whenever it wants. It’s fun, but we don’t live in that world anymore.”\nMore: Siri may open your smart lock-enabled doors to anyone who asks nicely\nWhat Schneier and (likely) his colleagues want to accomplish is to establish a working set of regulations fit for the long haul, meaning future appliance or device releases would have the ability to remain compliant. Be it mandatory two-step authentication or fingerprint recognition tech, a standard which proves better than a simple typed password could reasonably function as a better set of protections for tens of millions of people.\nWhat makes Schneier’s appearance in the hearing so important is the fact he’s trying to get out in front of the issue before it becomes a full-on disaster. Cyber attacks are constantly on the rise — with almost all of them avoiding discovery of any kind, as Burgess pointed out during the hearing — which means the likelihood of being affected is at an all-time high. While a hearing of this nature represents progress in and of itself, it looks like relevant legislation is far from being agreed upon.\nHow to keep your gadgets from being part of a botnet Broadband providers now need consent to share your data, thanks to the FCC On edge after the DDoS attack?

      "text": "MONTERREY, Mexico and ARMONK, N.Y. , Nov. 17, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- CEMEX (NYSE: CX), one of the leading building materials companies in the world, and IBM (NYSE: IBM ), today announced that CEMEX will undertake a sweeping digital transformation designed to improve its operations, substantially improve its customer experience and increase business efficiencies.\nCEMEX's digital transformation will enable real-time, mobile engagement with its building materials customers and distributors, including companies that build everything from sports complexes and skyscrapers to houses and high-scale infrastructures around the world. CEMEX will deploy a suite of custom made-for-business apps, built to meet the needs of CEMEX's customers, transforming how the entire company does business from attracting new clients to collecting payments, invoicing and after-sale support.\nBeginning in early 2017, CEMEX will launch a suite of custom apps designed in collaboration with IBM iX (Interactive Experience) to create the best mobile-led customer experience in the building materials supply industry. CEMEX will follow a \"speed-to-market\" approach, launching a pilot project, followed by user testing, adjusting the solutions to meet the users' needs, and then scaling the apps worldwide. For example, a new Foreman app that will enable construction foremen to manage many aspects of their ready-mix concrete orders in real-time is currently being field tested by select CEMEX customers in several markets prior to global implementation.\n\"At CEMEX, the future for our industry will be driven by the quality of the customer experience, not just the quality of the products and services. Our customers are increasingly expecting to have the same kind of experiences in working with businesses that they have in the consumer space,\" said Fernando A. Gonzalez , CEMEX's Chief Executive Officer. \"By deploying IBM's new and innovative methods of experience design and process reinvention, CEMEX can create a superior customer experience and more readily deliver higher value to our stakeholders.\"\nCEMEX is teaming up with IBM on one of the most comprehensive digital transformation strategies undertaken in the industry, including digital experience design, digital process reinvention, agile delivery, dev-ops implementation and business process operation. The transformation will fundamentally change how foremen, field operations managers, cement masons, concrete finishers, truck drivers and other construction professionals do their jobs and interact with CEMEX.\n\"We are committed to reinventing how work gets done using IBM iX and IBM Design as the new methods to reengineer business processes. We forged our partnership with Apple to change the nature of work by combining our expertise in customer experience design with our technological acumen,\" said Jesus Mantas, General Manager, IBM Global Business Consulting Services. \"The changes we are driving with CEMEX focus on digital reinvention and customer experience transformation at speed and scale. Our approach always starts with user experience - creating exceptionally elegant and simple ways for clients, employees and partners to better perform their jobs.\"\nCEMEX is also leveraging Mobile at Scale for iOS, a new IBM app design and development model for the rapid development and deployment of multiple iOS apps.

      "text": "ZDNet Japan IBM rolls out new cloud data services and features on Bluemix As cloud adoption continues at a rapid clip, IBM is appealing to customers with promises of a smooth migration and ways to find value in unstructured data. | Topic: Cloud \nIBM on Friday is announcing new cloud data services and features on Bluemix, designed to give businesses an easy way to migrate their data to the cloud and, once there, collect valuable insight from it. \nThe new services come just a few weeks after IBM merged its SoftLayer cloud infrastructure with its Bluemix services, scrapping the SoftLayer brand. \nAt a time when cloud adoption is poised to accelerate , just about every cloud service provider is appealing to the enterprise with promises of an easy migration and new services. IBM's latest pitch is largely about helping customers make the most of complex, unstructured data. \n\"Cloud is the platform that enables cognitive intelligence,\" John Murphy, vice president of the IBM Watson Data Platform, said in a statement. \"We're continuing to grow our catalog of cloud data services on Bluemix so that we can help developers and data scientists better manage and more quickly interpret data for business innovation.\" \nFirst, IBM is offering Bluemix Lift , a data migration tool for the Watson Data Platform. The service encrypts data being transferred, securely moving it through capabilities that can operate at a rate of up to 225GB per hour -- IBM says that's 10 times faster than traditional offerings. It's designed to minimize downtime, so applications using the source database can run through the migration process. IBM also promises that the data transfer will continue even during an outage or connectivity loss. \nNext, IBM is rolling out Decision Optimization on Cloud in beta on Bluemix. This service takes large amounts of data -- such as predictions, master and transactional data, business goals and business rules -- ingests all of those variables, and helps you make the best business decisions. \nFor instance, a clothing retailer could use Decision Optimization to consider whether or not it's worth restocking a low-inventory item. Factors like potential suppliers, shipping lanes and fees would all be ingested to give the most optimal decision, without any manual cost-benefit analysis. IBM points out it should be applicable in a wide variety of industries, including manufacturing, utilities, finance and retail. \nDecision Optimization on Bluemix includes the CPLEX Optimizer Engines and can run as a standalone. Alternatively, a customer can embed it in applications using a Rest API or use it from the Data Science Experience Notebooks. \nLastly, IBM dashDB for Transactions is a fully-managed SQL database service on IBM Bluemix. It's optimized for transactional and web workloads to help developers fuel new cloud-based applications. It offers high availability on selected plans, as well as pay-per-use units.",

      "text": "Latest News for Tech Companies: Some Changes Are in the Offing PART 4 OF 6 Can IBM’s Letter Persuade Trump to Soften on Tech Companies? By Rachel Gunter | Nov 17, 2016 5:57 pm EST IBM’s CEO offers proposal for job creation \nInternational Business Machines’ ( IBM ) CEO (chief executive officer) Ginni Rometty has written an open letter to president-elect Donald Trump, offering advice on job creation and other issues on healthcare and infrastructure. The question is whether the letter will cause Trump to be a little gentler on IBM and several others that he has rebuked for taking jobs outside the country. \nOn the campaign trail, Trump publicly called out IBM, Ford (F), and Carrier for moving jobs to Mexico, India, and other countries, thus creating a shortage of employment opportunities in the United States. He also called out Apple ( AAPL ) and Amazon ( AMZN ). \nThe US unemployment rate fell to 4.9% in October 2016 from 5.0% in September. The country added 161,000 new jobs that month. ‘New collar’ jobs at IBM \nIn her letter, Rometty didn’t directly address Trump’s concern over job losses. She did let Trump know, however, that the potential still exists, even for large companies such as IBM, to continue hiring more people domestically. She wrote about “new collar” jobs, which she described as entirely new roles in areas such as data science, cybersecurity, and artificial intelligence. She said IBM was already creating jobs and hiring in this “new collar” area. \nRometty also seemed to assure the president-elect that IBM hasn’t turned its back on less-educated Americans. She said in the letter that in some IBM centers across the United States, up to a third of the company’s employees don’t have college degrees. Concern in Silicon Valley \nRometty’s letter seems to echo the concern in Silicon Valley about a Trump presidency. Before the election, Tesla’s ( TSLA ) CEO Elon Musk was particularly worried about Trump’s position on climate change. \nIt remains to be seen if IBM’s overtures to Trump through Rometty’s letter could convince the President-elect to take a softer stance on the tech industry. {\"metrics\":[\"Open\"],\"tickers\":[\"IBM\",\"TSLA\",\"AAPL\",\"AMZN\",\"F\"],\"ticker_names\":[\"International Business Machines Corp.\",\"Tesla Motors Inc\",\"Apple Inc.\",\"Amazon.com, Inc.\",\"Ford Motor Company\"]} X",

      "text": "Contact(s) information \nARMONK, N.Y. - 18 Nov 2016: IBM (NYSE: IBM ) today announced several cloud data services and features on Bluemix designed to help organizations accelerate the migration of their data to the cloud and more easily generate business insights. Organizations look to the cloud as a powerful engine to collect and interpret vast amounts of data. However, many are struggling to move their already existing datasets to the cloud, as well as retain control of where they reside and how they are accessed. Without the right tools in place, the problem will only get worse as the amount of data continues to grow. According to IDC 1 , the amount of high-value data worth analyzing will double by 2020, and much of this data will be in the form of complex, unstructured information. \nNow available on Bluemix, IBM Decision Optimization, Bluemix Lift and dashDB for Transactions can help organizations overcome this challenge and make more informed business decisions by enabling them to more easily aggregate, ingest and analyze expanding workloads. \n“Cloud is the platform that enables cognitive intelligence,” said John Murphy, Vice President, IBM Watson Data Platform. “We’re continuing to grow our catalog of cloud data services on Bluemix so that we can help developers and data scientists better manage and more quickly interpret data for business innovation.” \nThe services include: \nIBM Decision Optimization on Cloud (including the CPLEX engines) is now in beta on Bluemix. It can ingest large amounts of data including predictions, master and transactional data, business goals, and business rules to prioritize and rank business decisions such as plans and schedules. Applicable across all industries, including manufacturing, utilities, finance and retail, this powerful tool offers the ability to trade-off conflicting business goals while balancing resource limitations to make more informed decisions. This offering includes the CPLEX Optimizer Engines and can run as a standalone, embedded in applications using a Rest API, or be used in Jupyter Notebooks within IBM's Data Science Experience . \nFor example, consider a major clothing retailer in need of restocking its winter coat supply. Local warehouses might be very low in stock, and shipping and transferring supplies from international locations could incur costly fees. Using Decision Optimization, a retail planner could automatically get recommendations and choose the most cost-effective replenishment plan, considering all possible suppliers, warehouses, shipping lanes, and costs, without having to do a potentially time-consuming manual \"what-if\" analysis or manual comparison of options. \nIBM Bluemix Lift is a data migration tool to quickly, securely and reliably migrate databases from existing on-premises data centers to IBM Bluemix and IBM Watson Data Platform. Bluemix Lift encrypts data being transferred, helping to securely move it at a rate of up to ten times faster than traditional offerings. The technology is also designed to minimize downtime, so that applications using the source database can run uninterrupted during migration. In addition, Lift has been designed to be highly reliable, enabling data transfers to keep flowing even during a connectivity loss. \nIBM dashDB for Transactions is a fully managed SQL database service on IBM Bluemix, optimized for transactional and web workloads to help developers fuel cloud-based applications. It offers high availability on selected plans, as well as pay-per-use units. It is part of IBM’s dashDB portfolio, offering a workload-optimized database environment designed to meet both the data warehousing and transactional needs of applications. \nTo get started with these services, visit the Bluemix Developers Catalog for IBM Bluemix Lift, Decision Optimization, and dashDB for Transactions . \nBluemix , IBM's Cloud platform, has grown rapidly to become one of the largest open, public cloud deployments in the world. Based in open standards, it features over 150 advanced technologies and services, including 35 cloud data services and a roster of others spanning categories of cognitive computing, blockchain, Internet of Things, DevOps and security.",
