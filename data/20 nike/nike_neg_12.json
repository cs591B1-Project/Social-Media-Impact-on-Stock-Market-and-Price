They’re flashy and pricey, and while Nike isn’t revealing exact numbers, it’s clear that they’re an extremely limited edition. But one thing they’re not, according to Tiffany Beers, is a gimmick.

      "text": "Nike investors do not have to add more shares now. \nBelow $48, the stock may drop to $40. \nBoth technicals and fundamentals prove that $40 be an ideal entry point. Nike (NYSE: NKE ) has been a painful stock for the investors this year. Having lost more than 25 percent from its all-time high of $68.19, the stock still languishes near the 52-week low even as the broader market scales fresh highs. Although the decline seems tempting to add more shares at $50, I believe that investors would be better off postponing their purchases, and adding closer to $40. Click to enlarge Source: TechCrunch The primary reason for not recommending a purchase at the current level is because an investor should be willing to weather a 20-25 percent decline in his stock value. So, investors who bought near the top don't necessarily have to rush in to add now. Adding now would make strong business sense only if there is high conviction that the downtrend is over and the stock is primed for a rally . Technically, the stock is trapped in a downtrend, which has been clearly marked in the daily Nike price chart below. The technical indicators - RSI and MFI - fail to indicate any signs of reversal as of yesterday. Click to enlarge Source: TradingView If the year-long downward channel is breached on the downside, there is a strong probability that the correction extends down to $40, which acted as a strong resistance earlier. The same has been marked in the daily chart above. But, if the stock were to negate the selling pressure and head higher, it will have to cross the formidable resistance of $56, beyond which significant short covering can be observed. At this point, I also want to address Nike's short interest which is at a 5-year high. It must be understood well that even at the multi-year highs, the short interest is just 2.06 percent of the outstanding float, which is nothing to be concerned about. So, investors are advised to look past the scary headlines and find out the actual merit. Click to enlarge If the $56 resistance is taken out, then we will definitely see a retreat in the short positions but, if the channel is breached on the downside, then we may see fresh short positions building up as well. The support level of $48 is the key. Let us also take a look at the monthly Nike price chart which spans almost two decades. After the debacle of 2008-09, Nike began an uptrend which lasted until late-2012. Come 2013, the stock began another uptrend although this time on a higher slope (highlighted in dotted line). Just few months ago, the stock violated the higher slope uptrend and has been declining since. Check out below. Click to enlarge Source: TradingView My bear -case expectation is that the stock will now attempt to take support from the much stronger and more sustainable support, extrapolated from the 2009-2012 uptrend. Interestingly, the present value of this support comes close to $40. Another reason why $40 could mark a strong reversal point is because it marks the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement level of the entire rally from 2009-2015. The stock, after taking support from the 23.6 percent Fib retracement, decisively violated it. The next Fib support is the 38.2 percent retracement level of $45.79, but the market generally views the 50 percent retracement as a stronger reversal level. It must also be noted from the monthly chart above that the Money Flow has dropped to 33.9860, a level not seen in the last 20 years . This is a strong indication of the underlying bearishness, and forces me to wait for better levels before recommending a buy. If the stock does drop 20 percent from the current level, it would bring many fundamental metrics in-line with their 5-year averages or even lower. Please see the valuation data below pulled from Morningstar which suggests that several ratios such as Price/Sales, Price/Cash Flows, Price/Book, Price/Forward Earnings are trading at 10-15 percent premiums to their 5-year averages. Click to enlarge Source: Morningstar.com A 20 percent drop will also push the current earnings yield of 4.35 percent to a level not seen since 2008. All of this confirms the same thing: That levels closer to $40 would be attractive from both technical and fundamental perspectives . Conclusion Nike has been battling weakness since the beginning of this year, however, investors do not have to add to their long positions now. The stock is trapped in a downward channel, which if pierced on the downside, could open the gates to $40. It has been well established both fundamentally and technically that another 20 percent drop would make the stock a very juicy affair. It would also attract significant buying interest from those investors who have been sitting on the sidelines with idle cash. That would lay the foundation of a sustainable recovery in the stock price. Only above the resistance of $56 should investors expect to see more gains and renewed short covering.

      "text": "By Melaina Juntti Washington Nationals left fielder Corey Brown wears a pair of Nike Sparq Strobe sports vision training glasses during a vision workout. Credit: Getty Images \nIf you blow out your knee or have major joint surgery, your doctor will likely recommend or even require physical therapy. By doing repeated physical exercises, you relearn how to move that body part, which can certainly help you get back up to speed. However, a new study suggests PT skips a key component of recovery: retraining the brain. MORE: How to Injury-Proof Your Body \nUsing MRI scans on patients recovering from ACL reconstructions, researchers at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center discovered that their brains processed information from their injured leg differently than from their healthy leg — and differently than how uninjured people process info. These guys relied much more heavily on visual cues when moving their reconstructed knee and didn’t move it as instinctively as they did their other knee. \n“When we asked participants to move their leg in a simple bend, the MRIs showed they used a visual processing system, even though this was not a visual task,” says Jimmy Onate, lead researcher and director of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences at OSU. “There was no reason to use their vision — they were not asked to avoid obstacles or use their eyesight in any way. But because nerve endings get damaged with musculoskeletal injuries, we think people begin relying on vision more to use, control, and monitor their movements.” ALSO: What's Really Causing Your Running Injuries \nThe problem with becoming overly dependent on your eyes is that you end up not retraining the joint to move naturally. Furthermore, you’re kidnapping your vision and devoting it to otherwise simple movements, when it would be better served watching out for fallen branches on your running trail or anticipating the next pass on the basketball court. \n“Think about vision from a cost-of-resources standpoint,” Onate says. “We only have a certain amount of it. If you’re walking down a wide, brightly lit hallway and don’t need to judge whether to go faster or slower or move right or left, then you can afford to use some of your vision for movement. But if you need to react to anything — say, you’re crossing a busy road or you’re on the court and need to know where the ball is and where your teammates are — then you don’t want to use up your vision on moving your knee.” \nNow that the researchers have discovered this disparity in information processing, they’ve begun testing out a method to fix it. In hopes of training patients to not depend on vision after ACL reconstruction, they’re having them wear stroboscopic eyewear during some physical therapy sessions. Also dubbed “strobe glasses,” these dark-hued specs are similar to sunglasses, making it much tougher to see in a bright therapy setting. But they also have shutters that open and close rapidly, creating a strobe light–like effect that interferes, distorts, and forces the body to move instinctively rather than by sight. \n“We’re taking away some of their vision but not blinding them completely and then also adding the visual-disturbance element,” Onate says. “You can’t just rehab someone on a soccer field because their leg is not ready.” But by re-teaching movements in a safe environment with impaired vision, Onate feels they can better prepare patients for resuming real life and real activities. \nStroboscopic eyewear isn’t entirely new in the world of sports. Since these glasses came onto the scene a few years back, pro athletes have used them to help hone their skills and quicken their reaction times. In 2013, Duke University researchers even tested them out on members of the NHL’s Carolina Hurricanes. After wearing the glasses during their 16-day preseason training camp, players performed 18 percent better on shooting and passing tests than their teammates who didn’t sport the specs. \nBut bringing stroboscopic eyewear into the therapy setting is an entirely new concept, one that Onate thinks may have real merit. “Using these glasses in physical therapy is not mainstream by any means, and we’re still looking at the pros and cons and for how long and when they should be used,” he says. But if Onate’s next round of experiments proves successful, strobe glasses could soon become an ingrained part of PT. \nOnate warns that people with seizures, migraines, or past concussions steer clear of strobe glasses because they may exacerbate symptoms. But for everyone else recovering from injury, he advocates trying them at home — that is, if you want to spring the $400 for the glasses online . Just don’t use them right out of the gate. “We do almost all activities with eyes open at first,” he adds. “Next you can move onto eyes closed. Then later, when you’re working on single-leg movements and other exercises, you can try the glasses.”  ",

      "text": "Previous Next \nUPDATE: Swooping in without warning this past November, the Nike SF Air Force 1 has quickly established itself as one of 2016s most coveted silhouettes – and none more so than this white-on-white rendition. Originally thought to be a ComplexCon exclusive, it looks like the crispy clean colourway will be seeing a wider release through select Nike Sportswear stockists in Asia from December 1. \nNo word on numbers yet, nor do we have any confirmation of these showing up in other regions. If you’re in Asia, march on down to your local retailer if you want to cop this military marvel. Previous Next \nAfter teasing the silhouette at the end of October, Nike have gone the whole hog on the announcement of the next generation of Air Force 1 s. Since 1982 the shoe has been changing and evolving with each new generation morphing into a force to be reckoned with. We’ve seen the shoe take on new weaves, higher and lower profiles, fusions and zips – and now we’re seeing it turn into this SF utilitarian adaption. \nThe newest version in the lineage goes sky high with the collar and comes clad in fortified materials. With a full grain leather and ballistic nylon build, interchangeable straps and ‘Espionage Tongue Storage’, it definitely has some Batman -esque gadgetry sensibilities. But it also slots in seamlessly with the current fashion climate. A military inspired carry bag also comes with the SF AF1, which has the same detachable straps as the shoe. \nAll colourways of the Nike SF Air Force 1 will be available on November 5 from the SNKRS page of Nike online , bar the white version which will be exclusive to ComplexCon. \nOn foot images via \n– Originally published November 2, 2016 SHARE THIS ARTICLE ",

      "text": "Even the most tech-averse will admit that they'd like to step, even if just briefly, into a shoe from the future. That's what Nike is promising with its self-lacing sneakers that have leapt from Hollywood screens into reality.\nNike put the dream of self-lacing shoes into the minds of sci-fi and sneaker fans when Michael J. Fox donned a fictional pair in 1989's Back to the Future Part II . By 2015, the year the movie is set, Nike had seemingly perfected the technology in real life, first announcing the Nike Air Mags , replicas of the sneakers Fox wears in the movie, and later the HyperAdapt — a self-lacing sneaker Nike intends to sell as an actual product.\nSEE ALSO: Nike's self-lacing sneakers are coming soon, but they're going to cost you ... a lot\nI got a chance to try out Nike's HyperAdapt shoes, finally getting a chance to find out how real-deal self-lacing sneakers actually feel. Are they just slick, logo-emblazoned technology you'll quickly regret spending your cash on, or is this the future of footwear?\nAre they just slick, logo-emblazoned technology, or is this the future of footwear?\nThat's the question I wanted to answer when I visited Nike's little known Nike+ Clubhouse, not far from its new Niketown store location in Soho, New York City.\nWhen I slipped on the size-14 HyperAdapts (the shoes are unisex, so a woman needing a size 8 would wear a HyperAdapt men's 6.5) with the much-talked-about battery and lacing mechanism embedded in its sole, I wasn’t expecting much in the way of comfort. Let's just say the shoes surpassed my expectations. The shoe not only looks better in person — it feels about as comfortable as any Nike I've worn. In fact, in keeping with most of Nike's line of running shoes, the HyperAdapt is amazingly lightweight. You'd never know the shoe was even special without seeing its LED lighting arrays in the sole and heel.\nSimilarly, the wireless charging pucks that magnetically snap onto the bottom of the shoes are light enough that tossing them into your backpack or purse won't add significant weight to your travels.\nImage: MASHABLE, LILI SAMS\nBut the real test was the lacing mechanism. With so many different foot shapes out there, could Nike have actually developed a lacing system that doesn't just squeeze your foot into the shoe, but actually supports your foot like traditional laces? I've only worn the shoes for an hour, but my early impression is: absolutely.\nYo this is crazy I'm officially part of the @Nike family! Trust me there's more to come but for now step into the future with me! 😜 #TeamNike #HyperAdapt\nA video posted by michaelbjordan (@michaelbjordan) on Nov 29, 2016 at 3:59pm PST\n\"There's a lace engine [in the shoe] and it has a motor and spool and there's a cable that winds up on that spool,\" says Tiffany Beers, a senior innovator at Nike who has worked on the shoe for about 10 years. \"Leading up to that you have a couple lace cables they come up and wind through [the surface of the shoe] in a very specific pattern to give you just the right fit and adjustability.\"\nTiffany Beers, Senior Innovator at Nike\nImage: MASHABLE, LILI SAMS\nI tested this mechanism a number of ways, and although the lacing mechanism is incredibly strong and supportive during wear, it doesn't pinch your foot or errant fingers with enough force to result in injury.\n\"[The laces are] a braided piece of nylon,\" says Beers. \"We call it the parachute. The whole goal of it is to give you a visual representation of the shoe's closing. They also help to distribute pressure.\"\nStill, I couldn't help but wonder if knockoff sneaker makers will attempt to replicate the HyperAdapt, possibly putting less than safe, would-be self-lacing sneakers on the market.\nImage: MASHABLE, LILI SAMS\n\"Eventually people will be able to reverse-engineer this and figure out how we did it,\" says Beers. \"The thing about it is that it's such a particular system to get the fit right and to get the mechanism built right. They're going to have to have electronics backgrounds.\"\nVery true. But it won't stop them from trying.\nImage: mashable, Adario strange\nThe HyperAdapt offers another cool feature: automatic lacing. So even if you don't use the plus or minus buttons to adjust the fit, when you put the shoes on, once you start walking, sensors in the heel detect your motion and begin tightening the shoe to a comfortable level of snugness.\nAnother nice surprise: If you ever feel like the shoes are perhaps not as responsive or functioning as they should be, the HyperAdapts can reboot. Just hold down the plus and minus buttons for 13 seconds and watch as the normally blue-green LEDs on the its heel and sole display a rainbow of red, yellow and purple flashes. Cool.\nImage: MASHABLE, LILI SAMS\nAside from the fit and the design, I also wondered if tagging the shoe \"E.A.R.L.\" (which stands for Electro Adaptive Reactive Lacing) was Nike's way of previewing a future Siri- or Alexa-style voice command system that allows you to adjust the fit of your Nike shoes and clothing in the future?\n\"I can't share all of the secrets with you,\" Beers says. \"A lot of these technologies are still in their infancy and we need to let them develop.\"\nNike will release the black version of the HyperAdapt on Dec. 1, and Beers says a silver version is coming for the Christmas season. Along with those versions, she also confirmed that a white version, with a gum rubber sole, with be distributed to \"friends of the brand.\" NBA star Kyrie Irving showed off that version on Monday via Twitter.\nYessir! Thanks @Nike pic.twitter.com/bXL1zbWNOw\n— Kyrie Irving (@KyrieIrving) November 28, 2016\nSo is Nike's HyperAdapt the best attempt at fashion-meets-tech we've seen to date?\nShort answer: Yes.\nBut the real challenge for Nike will be price. At $720, these are pricey as both a piece of tech and a pair of sneakers. Sure, for footwear in general, they're comfortably below the wares of Manolo and Ferragamo, but as trendy tech accessories go, the HyperAdapt sneakers are out of range for most, surpassing even the Apple Watch . Let's not forget Snapchat's Spectacles are just $129.\nBut in Nike's case, the wearable tech outlook may be brighter. My prediction is that if Nike can, in coming years, soften the blow on your wallet by a few hundred dollars, it's likely we'll see HyperAdapt's self-lacing technology everywhere.\nWelcome (back) to the future of wearable tech.\nBONUS: Nike’s self-lacing sneakers are on their way, but they ain’t cheap",

      "text": "Nike is swooshing into a huge, 70,000 square-foot store at 650 Fifth Ave. on the southwest corner of West 52 Street — across from Cartier and Olympic Tower.\nThe deal is valued at $700 million over its 15-year term and includes additional options, sources said.\nThe lease was approved and signed late Tuesday with SL Green Realty Corp. and Jeff Sutton, who control the retail base of the 36-story office building that is operated under a federal trustee.\nNike was represented by Joanne Podell of Cushman & Wakefield.\nThe new superstore will include the lower level along with the first six floors of the building.\nTo get to yes with Nike, Sutton and SL Green bought out the two remaining tenants and added the fourth to sixth floors to their original holdings through an additional lease that had to be approved by the building’s trustee and the federal government.\nThe Commercial Observer reported two current tenants, Godiva and Devon & Blake, were bought out of their leases in order to give the athletic sportswear giant a full, 100 feet of frontage along Fifth Avenue.\nNike has another large flagship a few blocks north at 6 E. 57 St. in a building controlled by President-elect Donald Trump that is adjacent to the rear of Trump Tower. The company previously picked up an option to remain there until 2022.\nThe retailer also just opened a newly built 55,000-square-foot store at 529 Broadway in a building partially owned by Sutton that paved the way for this deal.\nFindTheCompany | Graphiq Developed when Iran was governed by the former Shah, 650 Fifth became subject to forfeiture to the US government under the original embargo.\nTo unlock the value and provide funds to maintain the building, Sutton and SL Green were granted a 49-year lease that runs through 2062. The deal for 33,000 square feet originally included the lower level and the first three floors. The group then bought out tenant Juicy Couture for $51 million.\nBecause it was slow to respond to availabilities in the past, Nike lost other prime spaces — including at the former FAO Schwarz space at 767 Fifth Ave. where rival Under Armour recently leased.\nNone of the companies or brokers responded to requests for comment.\n ",

      "title": "Amazon, Kohl’s, Home Depot, Nike and Dick’s Supply Chain Executives to Keynote at eft’s 2nd Annual D3: Dynamic Distribution Disruption – Retail Summit in New York",
      "text": "The biggest so-called holiday shopping weekend of the year just ended. The result: some shops wrecked due to big crowds, websites crashed due to high traffic, while other millions of shoppers decided to #OptOutside ditching Black Friday altogether. Regardless, one thing is certain – retail is going through a major disruption. This disruption is driven by consumer preferences, and can be solved through a robust supply chain. The movers and shakers of retail are gathering in May in New York for the D3 Retail Summit: https://goo.gl/3S2x4d . Leading physical and online merchants, including Amazon, Kohl’s, Home Depot, Aldo and Nike, will blaze a trail for the industry through an omnichannel future in which supply chain will increasingly represent retailers’ USP. The Home Depot recently announced that they will be returning in May for the keynotes. “The D3 Summit was an outstanding event. The opportunity to meet with high level executives in supply chain in an intimate setting, provided for great candor and conversation. Everyone walked away highly energized with a larger network of experts and friends to leverage in the future,” commented Scott Spata, Home Depot’s VP of Supply Chain about the summit this year, and will be representing the company at D3 in May.\nDiscussions will center around eight key themes: consumer-driven supply chain, demand forecasting, inventory strategy, warehouse optimization, supplier collaboration, logistics and last-mile delivery, network redesign and route optimization, and organizational alignment. Download the brochure for more details: https://goo.gl/3S2x4d\nPriyanka Asera, Head of Retail at eft and D3’s principal architect, believes that the excitement around the event is a reflection of the retail industry having arrived at a crossroads. “Distribution and supply chain are no longer backroom functions, they are a core part of every retailer’s business and therefore require a more holistic, strategic approach,” Asera explains. “It is also incredibly exciting that we have Amazon involved as part of the keynotes since Amazon is the biggest enabler of pushing retail out of its comfort zone. Alexis is fantastic – and she is also the former VP of Operations at Target so she brings a wealth of all-round experience with her.”\nConfirmed speakers include:\nAlexis DePree, VP Global Customer Fulfilment, Amazon Ratnakar Lavu, CTO, Kohl’s Scott Spata, VP Supply Chain, The Home Depot Eileen Meade, VP Omnichannel Strategy, Dicks Sporting Goods Darrell Edwards, Chief Supply Chain Officer, La-Z-Boy Jeff Girard, SVP Logistics, DSW Don La France, SVP Supply Chain Technology, 1800flowers Jonathan Parks, VP Global Operations & Logistics, Rent-a-Center Bryan Eshelman, COO, Aldo Neil Beckerman, SVP Supply Chain and Finance, New York & Co. Pooja Agarwal, VP Operations, Birchbox Mike Griswold, VP Retail Research, Gartner\nChairing the summit is Hugh Williams, Managing Director at Hughenden Consulting, who will oversee two days of lively debate encompassing a broad cross-section of departments and companies. Williams said, \"I believe it is critical for retailers to be conscious of the needs of the customer in everything they do. But that is only half the story. They also need to work closely with all their supply chain partners to ensure that they all move away from the traditional push system to truly being demand-led. Retailers must take responsibility for driving the supply chain and building true partnerships.\"\nSponsors of the D3 Summit include Mercury Gate, B-Stock Solutions, Convey, project44, Bringg, Macropoint, Transfix and AFS.\nFor detailed information on the agenda, 40+ speakers, venue and more, download the brochure: https://goo.gl/3S2x4d\nIf companies are interested in getting involved, they are encouraged to contact Priyanka Asera via the details below.

With a minimal woven upper, the shoe flexes and breathes like nothing else, while the stretchy silicone strap locks your foot in place. Adding to the lightweight comfort of the Dart, a cushy foam midsole will put a spring in your step. The black and white yarns mingle to give the shoe a slight-grey look, with a matching speckle on the midsole – it’s a winner in our book. \nThe Nike Sock Dart SE ‘Black/White’ is available now from select stockists, including online from Hype DC . \nMore Nike Sock Dart",

      "text": "Previous Next \nUPDATE: Swooping in without warning this past November, the Nike SF Air Force 1 has quickly established itself as one of 2016s most coveted silhouettes – and none more so than this white-on-white rendition. Originally thought to be a ComplexCon exclusive, it looks like the crispy clean colourway will be seeing a wider release through select Nike Sportswear stockists in Asia from December 1. \nNo word on numbers yet, nor do we have any confirmation of these showing up in other regions. If you’re in Asia, march on down to your local retailer if you want to cop this military marvel. Previous Next \nAfter teasing the silhouette at the end of October, Nike have gone the whole hog on the announcement of the next generation of Air Force 1 s. Since 1982 the shoe has been changing and evolving with each new generation morphing into a force to be reckoned with. We’ve seen the shoe take on new weaves, higher and lower profiles, fusions and zips – and now we’re seeing it turn into this SF utilitarian adaption. \nThe newest version in the lineage goes sky high with the collar and comes clad in fortified materials. With a full grain leather and ballistic nylon build, interchangeable straps and ‘Espionage Tongue Storage’, it definitely has some Batman -esque gadgetry sensibilities. But it also slots in seamlessly with the current fashion climate. A military inspired carry bag also comes with the SF AF1, which has the same detachable straps as the shoe. \nAll colourways of the Nike SF Air Force 1 will be available on November 5 from the SNKRS page of Nike online , bar the white version which will be exclusive to ComplexCon. \nOn foot images via \n– Originally published November 2, 2016 SHARE THIS ARTICLE",

      "title": "Nike rolls out sneakers with self-tying laces - MarketWatch",
      "text": "Nike Inc. this week begins selling a pricey sneaker with self-tying laces, a high-stakes test of the company's technology investments and efforts to sell more products directly to consumers.\nSince its founding, Nike has predominantly been a wholesaler. But as shopping shifts online, Nike is moving to lessen its reliance on retailers. It wants to double its direct sales to consumers to $16 billion by 2020, particularly as rivals Adidas AG and Under Armour Inc. have become more competitive in recent years.\nThat is where the self-lacing $720 HyperAdapt sneakers play a role. The company is offering the shoes exclusively on its relaunched Nike+ app and at a new retail store in New York City, beginning on Thursday. The idea is to hook consumers into buying via its app or visiting Nike stores for limited-edition sneaker releases, which to date has been a near-weekly phenomenon at Foot Locker and other retailers.\nThe move could put the squeeze on an already consolidating sporting goods retail industry, analysts say. Nike currently is the single-largest vendor to big chains like Dick's Sporting Goods Inc., Foot Locker Inc. and Finish Line Inc., accounting for 20%, 72%, and 73% of merchandise purchased, respectively, according to regulatory filings.\n\"They have to be worried about it,\" said John Kernan, senior retail analyst for brokerage Cowen & Co. He pointed to recent efforts by Dick's to create some of its own products and provide more shelf space to Under Armour and Adidas. Dick's didn't respond to a request for comment.\nKasper Rorsted, the new chief executive of Adidas, said of the self-lacing shoes, \"I don't know if that's a save-the-world product,\" but sales through mobile devices and apps will continue to grow within the industry.\nAsked for his perspective on the HyperAdapt launch, Foot Locker CEO Dick Johnson said on a November earnings call that Nike has \"very limited peers in the marketplace\" and has the bandwidth to launch some of its product via its own retail channels.\nThe HyperAdapt release comes after a decade of changes within Nike to expand into technology and consumer services.\n\"There was a moment of realization, when Nike people looked around and saw everyone running around with an iPod, that was when we knocked on the door of Apple,\" said Roberto Tagliabue, who was a director of digital innovation at Nike from 2005 through 2009.\nHe oversaw the launch of the first Nike+ product, a sensor placed in running shoes that synced with early iPods. The idea was to keep customers communicating with Nike long after they left the store.\nBeth Sasseen, a recruiter who worked at Nike from 2007 to 2009, said her focus was on finding tech-savvy talent who could help develop more personalized products and software to better engage with consumers. Nike \"was trying to be ahead of the game,\" she said.\nNike's push into tech wasn't without its setbacks. The original Nike+ sensor evolved into a series of wristbands, including the FuelBand, first launched in 2012. But it was discontinued in 2014 when the company decided to scrap hardware development altogether and focus on software and apps.\nMeanwhile, Under Armour purchased a suite of fitness-tracking apps between 2013 and 2015 to create a network of more than 190 million users to market more shirts and shoes. Another fitness app, Strava, is popular among Nike employees, who have recorded thousands of runs around their Beaverton, Ore.,campus, according to interviews with staffers and data from Strava's website.\nNike began upgrading training apps of its own, including Nike+ Run Club and Nike+ Training Club, which include coaching tips from star athletes like Serena Williams and Ashton Eaton. The company returned to the gadget market this fall with a swoosh-branded version of the Apple Watch.\nMr. Tagliabue, who has since started his own Silicon Valley design firm, said Nike operates differently than other tech firms. \"They cannot bring to market products that are not perfect\" and risk damaging the brand, he said. \"At Nike, sometimes you can get frustrated because things go slow.\"\nNike's digital sport team has spent roughly $100 million on software products, including the new Nike + app, over the past four years, according to a person familiar with the matter. The department has also been hit by turnover, with some members departing for Under Armour, Alphabet Inc.'s Google and others, the person said.\nNike said it doesn't disclose spending figures. The company announced in February it was naming Adam Sussman as chief digital officer, shortly before the HyperAdapt shoes and new apps were unveiled. Development on self-lacing technology began over a decade ago, and today's HyperAdapts are intended to be the first version of what Nike calls \"adaptive performance\" products.\nSo far, some Nike aficionados are excited about the futuristic shoes, if not the price. Hunter Harpin of North Adams, Mass., said he buys a pair of custom Nikes every year but the HyperAdapts just aren't worth the extra cost.\n\"It takes me two seconds to tie my own shoes,\" he said, \"so I think I'd have a $200 limit on self-lacing sneakers.\"\nWrite to Sara Germano at sara.germano@wsj.com\nMore from MarketWatch How Election 2016 Changed the Political Parties Oil prices keep a grip on rally after OPEC deal; Brent atop $52 a barrel Why is Hillary Clinton hiking so much?",

      "text": "December 1, 2016 12:00 AM Nike's Flyknit training shoes made for the gym By JEFF BANOWETZ Tribune News Service Order Reprint of this Story \nThe Nike Free line has been at the forefront of the minimalist movement, which focuses on allowing the foot to keep its natural motion as much as possible, unencumbered by the structure of traditional shoes. The Nike Free Train Force Flyknit brings that thinking into the gym, with a breathable shoe that is great for exercise classes, lifting weights and cardio equipment. The design uses Nike's Flyknit technology to provide stability on the upper with very little material. \nThe dual-density sole offers some cushioning for when you're jumping and provides a solid platform for when you're lifting. The sock-like fit is comfortable but still provides that locked-in feel you want when moving in multiple directions in a boot-camp style class or plyometrics. The design may cause some heads to turn (particularly if you go with the red or orange Flyknit), but the function delivers on the promise of a natural feel while still allowing you to safely perform any gym activity. \n$150, nike.com",

      "text": "What it's like to wear Nike's HyperAdapt self-lacing sneakers Published by Mashable on Thu, 01 Dec 2016 Even the most tech-averse will admit that they'd like to step, even if just briefly, into a shoe from the future. That's what Nike is promising with its self-lacing sneakers that have leapt from Hollywood screens into reality.Nike put the dream of self-lacing shoes into the minds of sci-fi and sneaker fans when Michael J. Fox donned a fictional pair in 1989's Back to the Future Part II. By 2015, the year the movie is set, Nike had seemingly perfected the technology in real life, first announcing the Nike Air Mags, replicas of the sneakers Fox wears in the movie, and later the HyperAdapta self-lacing sneaker Nike intends to sell as an actual product.

      "text": "\nScreenshot via Nike \nI really feel bad for basketball people because their sport’s go-to movie is Space Jam , which sucks and was never good. So when it’s time to stick Blake Griffin and Jimmy Butler into a sneaker ad, someone in the marketing agency stands up and says, “Let’s get some Space Jam references in there,” and no one disagrees.\nSo that’s what you get here — thinly veiled shots from Griffin, Butler, and Bugs Bunny at the Golden State Warriors, who are fun and awesome, unlike Space Jam . The Monstars must be stopped because they are a “super team” and Griffin and Butler have got this. One plays for the Clippers and one plays for the Bulls, so I don’t know how they can contractually unite to beat space aliens in street games, but I didn’t think up this ad.\nDefy the Monstars.\n@ BlakeGriffin32 and @ JimmyButler are ready to take the game back. https://t.co/cU8WXFiUzD — \nJordan (@Jumpman23) December 01, 2016 \n\nIt’s sort of crazy that Space Jam is basketball’s movie. How many better movies are there about basketball? 100? Love & Basketball , White Men Can’t Jump , Juwana Mann . The list is endless yet they want to make a Space Jam sequel for some strange reason. Why not an ad where Griffin and Butler dominate old-as-hell Woody Harrelson and Wesley Snipes in 2-on-2. Now I’d watch that for sure. \n( Jordan on Twitter )\n",

      "text": "December 1, 2016 3:00 AM Nike's Flyknit training shoes made for the gym By JEFF BANOWETZ Tribune News Service Order Reprint of this Story \nThe Nike Free line has been at the forefront of the minimalist movement, which focuses on allowing the foot to keep its natural motion as much as possible, unencumbered by the structure of traditional shoes. The Nike Free Train Force Flyknit brings that thinking into the gym, with a breathable shoe that is great for exercise classes, lifting weights and cardio equipment. The design uses Nike's Flyknit technology to provide stability on the upper with very little material. \nThe dual-density sole offers some cushioning for when you're jumping and provides a solid platform for when you're lifting. The sock-like fit is comfortable but still provides that locked-in feel you want when moving in multiple directions in a boot-camp style class or plyometrics. The design may cause some heads to turn (particularly if you go with the red or orange Flyknit), but the function delivers on the promise of a natural feel while still allowing you to safely perform any gym activity. \n$150, nike.com",

      "text": "View photos\nScreenshot via Nike\nI really feel bad for basketball people because their sport’s go-to movie is Space Jam , which sucks and was never good. So when it’s time to stick Blake Griffin and Jimmy Butler into a sneaker ad, someone in the marketing agency stands up and says, “Let’s get some Space Jam references in there,” and no one disagrees.\nRelated Links:\nJordan Brand Teased The Triumphant Return Of The Monstars On The 20th Anniversary Of ‘Space Jam’\nSo that’s what you get here — thinly veiled shots from Griffin, Butler, and Bugs Bunny at the Golden State Warriors, who are fun and awesome, unlike Space Jam . The Monstars must be stopped because they are a “super team” and Griffin and Butler have got this. One plays for the Clippers and one plays for the Bulls, so I don’t know how they can contractually unite to beat space aliens in street games, but I didn’t think up this ad.\nDefy the Monstars.\n@ BlakeGriffin32 and @ JimmyButler are ready to take the game back. https://t.co/cU8WXFiUzD —\nJordan (@Jumpman23) December 01, 2016\nIt’s sort of crazy that Space Jam is basketball’s movie. How many better movies are there about basketball? 100? Love & Basketball , White Men Can’t Jump , Juwana Mann . The list is endless yet they want to make a Space Jam sequel for some strange reason. Why not an ad where Griffin and Butler dominate old-as-hell Woody Harrelson and Wesley Snipes in 2-on-2. Now I’d watch that for sure.\n( Jordan on Twitter )",

(Photo: Business Wire) \nSince 2010, the Nike Community Impact Fund has awarded more than 375 nonprofit organizations with more than $3.75 million in grants. With this recent round of grants, the total impact for 2016 is $800,000, including grants in Oregon where NCIF began and the national expansion of the program. \n“Our Community Store Ambassadors are passionate about getting involved in their communities,” said Caitlin Morris, Nike’s Senior Director of North America Community Impact. “By connecting Nike’s Community Stores to local grant programs, we look forward to fostering even deeper connections to provide youth with early, positive experiences in sport and physical activity.” \nGrant Recipients Reflect the Health and Vitality of Local Communities \nAt the Detroit Community Store, one recipient for the inaugural grant program is the Boys and Girls Club of Southeastern Michigan . The club is devoted to guiding and supporting children ages 6-18 in five core areas: the arts; character and leadership development; education and career development; health and life skills; and sports, fitness and recreation. With the grant, the organization will create a co-ed basketball league. \nTim Carroll, Head Coach of the Detroit Community Store, oversaw the grant process in his community. “We wanted to focus on organizations that are striving to make physical activity, play and sport a highly valued part of everyday life for our athletes in the Detroit area,” Carroll said. “The Boys & Girls Club of Southeastern Michigan is doing just that through their co-ed basketball league.” \nHe added, “Our Nike Store athletes already have a strong relationship with the Boys and Girls Club, spending a few days a week volunteering there. During the afterschool program they lead young athletes in games and activities. We’re excited to deepen our connection with them through this new grant.” \n“We are very grateful to our local Detroit Community Store, The Nike Community Impact Fund and CAF America for their support of our co-ed basketball league,” said Patrice Dicken, Club Director, Boys & Girls Club of Southeastern Michigan-Lloyd H. Diehl Club. “At the Boys & Girls Club, we want our kids to succeed. Through the co-ed basketball team, we’ll be able to provide even more opportunities for our youth to participate in a structured environment that will help them develop skills, increase fitness, learn strategy and practice good sportsmanship.” \nAt the South Chicago Community Store, Caitlyn Hickey, Community Store Ambassador, emphasized the need to hire positive role models who want to be part of the local community. “At the Chicago Community Store, we like to be a positive role model in kids’ lives. Having Nike involved at their school is really impactful to these kids.” \nPrior to the grant process, the Chicago Community Store was already involved with the Gary Comer Youth Center, where Community Store Ambassadors—store employees that have received training in providing early, positive experiences in sport and physical activity--have been helping kids who may be struggling in physical education classes, by working with them to move to the next level. They also talk to kids about career development, how to develop a resume and do interviews, and what life is like after high school. When the grant opportunity came up, Caitlin Hickey personally went out and helped school administrators through the step-by-step grant process. “It was really rewarding to be involved in that portion of the grant process, helping them apply and eventually get chosen as a grant recipient,” said Hickey. \nInternational Expansion of NCIF \nNike is proud to be expanding the Nike Community Impact Fund to Europe. Nike employees in Nike’s European Headquarters in Hilversum, Netherlands, and European Logistics Center in Laakdal, Belgium, will help direct more than $350,000 (USD) of Nike’s community investments in Europe. \nThe first round of grants for these cities will be announced in 2017. \nNike Community Impact Fund Awardees \nThe following 48 organizations received grants from six U.S. Nike Community Stores, through the Nike Community Impact Fund at CAF America: Organization",

      "text": "It's go time for one of Nike's ( NKE ) most innovative sneakers ever and time to say goodbye to tripping over your shoelaces. Nike first showed off its Hyperadapt sneakers in March. The sneakers feature what Nike calls \"adaptive lacing\" technology, which can automatically tweak the snugness of the shoe. There are two buttons on the side to tighten and loosen the laces. They obviously have to be charged, which is done via a wireless charging puck. A blue light on the sole of the shoe indicates a full charge, a yellow light warns a user the battery is dying and red is basically panic mode for sneakerheads. Slowing sales growth for Nike has been fueled by sluggish demand for its basketball sneakers in the face of greater competition from the Under Armour ( UA ) Stephen Curry basketball brand and new fashion offerings from Adidas ( ADDYY )",

      "text": "Adidas \nAdidas has opened a brand-new sprawling home for its offerings in New York City, just a few blocks from Times Square on 5th Ave.\nThe global flagship is four floors, including a lower level, and measures 45,000 square feet. That makes it the German sportswear giant's largest store in the world, and signifies the brand's increased focus on the US market in the midst of its American turnaround.\nAdidas is also focusing on New York as part of its \"key city\" attack plan.\n\"We wanted to focus on elevating the brand in key cities, and New York City is a great place to start because it's a sport and fashion intersection,\" Claire Midwood, Senior VP of Concepts to Consumer, told The Street. \nThe store features a design the company calls its \"stadium retail concept\" that takes inspiration from U.S. high school sports stadiums. To that end, the entrance to the store mimics the tunnels athletes typically walk through to get to the field, and between the first and second level, high school-style bleachers are set up overlooking 5th Ave and shoppers can watch either the street scene below or live games on the TVs.\nOther features in the store include a stall selling juices and snacks, a personal fitness consultation area, and a customization area for both shoes and clothing. The store has \"locker rooms\" to try on product, and areas called \"The Turf\" and \"The Track\" to test out product before purchase.\nAdidas \nAll of Adidas most famous product is accounted for and has its own place in the store, including Originals like the Stan Smith and Superstar and new hot performance products like the Ultra-Boost, as well as new collaborations like Stella McCartney for Adidas and a limited partnership with Canadian-based sportswear manufacturer Reigning Champ.\nLines were long on December 1 , with customers looking to get first dips on some unique styles offered for the grand opening.\nIn November, chief rival Nike also opened a huge store in New York's Soho district , with a focus on technology and trial before purchase. The sportswear giants, it seems, have chosen NYC as the place to wage war.\nAdidas \nNOW WATCH: We did a blind taste test of wings from Pizza Hut, Domino's, Papa John's, and Buffalo Wild Wings — the winner was clear \n",

Tiger to wear new Nike TW ’17 golf shoes at Hero World Challenge E-mail \nTiger Woods will be wearing Nike’s new TW ’17 golf shoe this week at the Hero World Challenge, which is designed to accomodate the golfer’s revamped golf swing. \nAccording to Nike, Woods has been working on the design of the shoe with Tobie Hatfield, Nike’s Senior Director of Athlete Innovation, since July 2015. The inspiration for its design was Woods’ new swing, in which Woods has shifted his dominance from his left leg to his right leg. Woods and Hatfield with the TW ’17. \n“This shoe is an absolutely integral part of my return to the sport I love and have missed so much,” Woods says. “Nike really got in the zone with me. I knew Tobie and I were on to something special back when I tried on the first prototype. I feel supreme support from this shoe which leads to the utmost confidence when I step onto the course.” \nThe most intriguing part of the shoe’s design is what Nike calls its “duo’s strapping system concept,” which was added to keep Woods “secure and locked down in his shoe.” According to Nike, the TW ’17 is the only golf shoe Woods has worn since undergoing two back surgeries in the fall of 2015. \nThe TW ’17 will be available in Spring 2017.

McMenamin also remarked that the shoe doesn’t look like the pair that leaked earlier this summer and features a strap. \nCheck out McMenamin’s full quote below and be sure to watch the Cavs vs. Clippers game tonight on TNT. James might just debut the Nike LeBron 14. \n“ LeBron James wore an all black pair of the yet-to-be-released Nike LeBron 14 to shootaround Thursday but took them off before talking to the press so reporters couldn’t snap photos of them. They don’t look like the images that leaked in August at all. James let ESPN.com inspect them, as long as we promised not to take a photo, and they are very sharp. One clue to what to expect when they drop in January: strap. ” ",

Back in February, the kicks got a major leather-clad overhaul thanks to NikeLab and now the design is being transformed yet again -- this time into a comfy slip-on sneaker. Aptly dubbed the Benassi SLP, the design retains the sole unit of the aforementioned NikeLab drop and even comes with the slide's usual midfoot strap, in this case including it as an overlaying panel across the shoe's predominately suede upper. Joining the suede construction is mesh bootie that sees its materials extended to the silhouette's heel.\nDebuting in a Black/Dark Mushroom/White colorway, the Benassi SLP is available now from atmos and should hit additional Nike Sportswear spots soon.\nClick here to view full gallery at Hypebeast.com \n\n",

      "text": "(The Adidas store on the corner of 46th St. and 5th Ave.Adidas) \nAdidas has opened a brand-new sprawling home for its offerings in New York City, just a few blocks from Times Square on 5th Ave. \nThe global flagship is four floors, including a lower level, and measures 45,000 square feet. That makes it the German sportswear giant's largest store in the world, and signifies the brand's increased focus on the US market in the midst of its American turnaround.\nAdidas is also focusing on New York as part of its \"key city\" attack plan.\n\"We wanted to focus on elevating the brand in key cities, and New York City is a great place to start because it's a sport and fashion intersection,\" Claire Midwood, Senior VP of Concepts to Consumer, told The Street. \nThe store features a design the company calls its \"stadium retail concept\" that takes inspiration from U.S. high school sports stadiums. To that end, the entrance to the store mimics the tunnels athletes typically walk through to get to the field, and between the first and second level, high school-style bleachers are set up overlooking 5th Ave and shoppers can watch either the street scene below or live games on the TVs.\nOther features in the store include a stall selling juices and snacks, a personal fitness consultation area, and a customization area for both shoes and clothing. The store has \"locker rooms\" to try on product, and areas called \"The Turf\" and \"The Track\" to test out product before purchase.\n(The store is Adidas' largest in the world by square footage.Adidas) \n\nAll of Adidas most famous product is accounted for and has its own place in the store, including Originals like the Stan Smith and Superstar and new hot performance products like the Ultra-Boost, as well as new collaborations like Stella McCartney for Adidas and a limited partnership with Canadian-based sportswear manufacturer Reigning Champ.\nLines were long on December 1 , with customers looking to get first dips on some unique styles offered for the grand opening.\nIn November, chief rival Nike also opened a huge store in New York's Soho district , with a focus on technology and trial before purchase. The sportswear giants, it seems, have chosen NYC as the place to wage war.\n(The entrance to the Adidas store on 5th Ave.Adidas) \n\nNOW WATCH: We did a blind taste test of wings from Pizza Hut, Domino's, Papa John's, and Buffalo Wild Wings — the winner was clear \n\nMore From Business Insider \nHere's how much an iPhone 7, a TV, and sneakers would cost if they were made in the US \nDonald Trump is about to prove if he can keep one of his biggest campaign promises \nBurger King is about to bring back a game-changing side",

      "text": "The Future of Nike’s HyperAdapt (NKE) By Dan Moskowitz | December 1, 2016 — 11:44 AM EST \nNIKE, Inc.’s ( NKE ) HyperAdapt 1.0 goes on sale today. They won’t be easy to find, and they’re expensive, but that’s intended. In order to purchase the HyperAdapt 1.0, you will need to lay down $720. You will also need to have made a reservation at one of the two New York City Nike stores where the HyperAdapt 1.0 is being sold. The only other option is the Nike+ app. \nNike doesn’t want its first version of self-lacing shoes to be easy to find and affordable. If that were the case, it wouldn’t drive excitement and demand. When supply is low, demand is high . By driving excitement now, Nike is setting up for the long haul. If the next version of the HyperAdapt offers improved technology at a cheaper price, then demand will absolutely increase. Based on what Nike is saying, the technology will improve. Currently, you must use buttons on the side of the shoes to tighten and loosen, but Nike wants that to become an automatic feature in the future, essentially where the shose detect that athlete’s motion and adjust accordingly. (See also, Why Adidas Has Been Beating Nike and Under Armour ) \nAccording to TechCrunch, Nike senior innovator and engineer Tiffany Beers, said, “This could absolutely be a mainstream product. It doesn’t feel gimmicky after using it. Athletes move and change. And their environment is constantly moving and changing. So optimal fit is important. Why isn’t our shoe changing more with our foot? That speaks to the potential future of where this is going.” \nBeers added, “This is a concept car. We’ve tested it in training, running and basketball — mostly in running to get the durability right.” \nIf you want to further understand where Nike is going with this, the following statement is directly from the Nike website back in March: “to embed the technical components into such a small space that the design moves with the body and absorbs the same force the athlete is facing.” \nFor Nike, the HyperAdapt 1.0 represents the beginning of a long runway. If it works, then Nike will help seal its footwear domination. \nNKE has depreciated 23.66% over the past 12 months and currently offers a dividend yield of 1.42%.",

      "text": "Kith, recipient of the 2016 Footwear News Achievement Awards Retailer of the Year , is teaming up with Nike for a limited-edition sneaker release that will have many feeling nostalgic.\nTo celebrate the opening of Kith’s Miami location, Fieg has partnered with Nike to release what he calls his “favorite shoe of all-time,” the Nike Air Force 1 Low “Linen.” The tan, pink, and white sneakers originally released as a Japan exclusive in 2001 as part of Nike’s fan-favorite “Concept Japan” range and have remained tucked away in the brand’s vaults ever since. Related Watch Cuba Gooding Jr., Spike Lee, Ansel Elgort and Michael Kors Go Off Script \nSelect friends and family pairs of the Nike Air Force 1 Low “Linen” will feature custom packaging by artist Futura. Kith/Tyler Mansour In order to capture the original appeal, Kith and Nike have pulled out all the stops to re-create a one-to-one retro that mimics everything from the grade of premium leather to the narrow shape seen on the “Linen” Air Force 1 Low 15 years ago.\nMeanwhile, the sneaker’s launch will also call back to its regional availability in 2001 with a release exclusively at Kith’s new Miami location at 1931 Collins Ave. Beginning on the store’s grand opening on Dec. 2, raffle opportunities will be presented on four different days over the course of the following two weeks.\n“The timing was amazing, and I am beyond excited to be the one to help reintroduce my favorite shoe ever to the world. 2016 has been an incredible year, and I’ve been able to live out so many of my personal dreams,” Fieg wrote on Instagram.\nAccording to a press release from Kith, this will be the only opportunity to obtain the “Linen” Nike Air Force 1 Low, and the shoes will have a wider release in the future.\nIf you know me, you know my favorite shoe of all time is the AF1 Linen. Over a year ago I spoke with Nike about officially bringing back this grail. This shoe represents a different time for sneakers, a time before the game became commercialized. Back then it was about the hunt, and you either had to physically travel somewhere to get the pair you wanted, or you had to know someone who knew someone else that had them. I told the Swoosh that if these were to be brought back, they had to be done in a way that would honor its original release. Not only did the quality have to be perfect, but so did the way they are brought to market. Being a Japan exclusive in 2001, we agreed that they had to remain a shoe that wasn't sold online and was solely available in 1 place. Around this time I had begun work on another dream of mine – opening a Kith Miami flagship. The timing was amazing, and I am beyond excited to be the one to help reintroduce my favorite shoe ever to the world. 2016 has been an incredible year, and I've been able to live out so many of my personal dreams. Here goes another one. A Kith Miami global exclusive. Stay tuned to @kith for more info. \nA photo posted by Ronnie Fieg (@ronniefieg) on Nov 30, 2016 at 6:04pm PST \n \nThe Nike Air Force 1 Low “Linen” is a one-to-one reproduction of the original 2001 release.

      "text": "Posted By: Kenny Honaker Posted date: December 01, 2016 In: NBA \nOver the years, Cleveland Cavaliers forward LeBron James has proven to be one of the most giving athletes of all time. Whether it be scholarships to kids in Akron or uniforms to area high school athletic programs, James has worked tirelessly to make a positive impact in Cleveland’s local communities. \nJames’ charitable hand reaches much further than Northeast Ohio, though, as two high school teams recently learned. \nRELATED: Kyrie Irving reacts to Tyronn Lue pulling starters from game \nOn Monday, the boys basketball team of the four-time defending state champion West Linn High School Lions in Oregon received a surprise gift during practice drills. Boxes of brand new LeBron Soldier 10s were given to the student athletes; enclosed was an inspirational message from Nike and James. \n“Lions, \nNot two, not three, not four. Time to get number five, boys! \nYou got some big shoes to fill this season. The target on your back has never been bigger. \nBut if no one wants it more than you, no one can take your crown. \nStay hungry, I’ll be watching.” \nWest Linn was thankful in their response on Twitter: West Linn boys basketball team gets surprise gift from LeBron James, Nike https://t.co/lbiuZiD8HR @wlboysbball pic.twitter.com/GUgyaPvfQY \n— KGW HS Sports (@KGW_HSS) November 24, 2016 @KingJames @TDNike @JillNoe thank you! Very grateful to be part of the @nikebasketball family! Excited for the season ! pic.twitter.com/A3q5ViHRBb \n— West Linn Basketball (@wlboysbball) November 22, 2016 \nWest Linn is just the second school to win four straight 6A boys basketball state championships. Their supreme level of play hasn’t gone unnoticed by The King. \nIn a similar stroke of kindness, James and Nike donated shirts and shoes to the Althoff Catholic High School boys basketball team in Belleville, Illinois. \nThe Crusaders of Altoff are currently ranked 5th in the nation and have started the season with a 3-0 record. The boys were ecstatic when they received their gifts. LeBron James gives Althoff Crusaders new shoes and shirts https://t.co/pWKe6rJeFN pic.twitter.com/pCcwRmht7E",

Club America 2017 Third Kit This is the new Nike Club America 2017 third jersey. Based on Nike's global template, used for the likes of Barcelona and Manchester City as well as for Mexican club Pumas, the new Club America 2017 third kit introduces a modern design with a fade from dark to light green. Fittingly, all sponsor logos as well as the club crest on the Club America 2017 third shirt are all-white and don't interfere with the design too much. What do you think?

      "text": "Conner Dial 1 december 2016 \nThe Nike HyperAdapt 1:1 self-tying sneakers are nothing to scoff at. With an automated lace mechanism that allows wearers to adjust lace tightness on the fly and in the moment, Nike truly proves that automated tech isn’t a gimmick. Unlike the Nike Mag shoes that inspired it, Nike says that these sneakers are a performance shoe, not a collector’s item. \nThough the shoe is the result of over three years of research, it doesn’t feel too far out there. The shoe easily slips onto your foot and the adaptive lacing mechanism is triggered by standing on your heel. Two buttons on the side also make it easy to manually adjust tightness. The teal-colored block on the outsole warns you when the shoe is running low on battery, however, Nike ensures it can last two weeks on a single charge (and even more when you aren’t using the flash functionality). \nComing in a beautiful, massive box, fit for its innovative tech, the Nike HyperAdapt 1:1 package comes with a usb charging kit, a customer service hotline number for Nike HyperAdapt users and a hefty $720 price tag. \nNike Senior Innovator Tiffany Beers states that athletes were initially the core consumer as explosive, lateral movements require tighter laces, but often this can restrict movement and blood flow. The adaptive lace system allows athletes to easily change their shoe tightness. \nBearing that in mind, the shoe was designed for general, cross-sport use, from low-impact cardio to explosive, drill-based work. While the shoes aren’t heavy, they aren’t as agile as sprint shoes. Nevertheless, if Nike’s adaptive lace system proves successful, there’s no doubt we will be seeing these in sport-specific iterations. \nUltimately, the adaptive lace system has benefits for anyone with dexterity issues or mobile disabilities. Nike, who has a history of working with non profit organizations like the Parkinson’s Foundation, would like to develop the E.A.R.L (Electro Adaptive Reactive Lacing) system for universal use. For now, though, according to Beers, the HyperAdapt 1:1 is simply a “test car.” ",

      "text": "One of the first ever Nike runners just released in a brand new colorway today. We’re talking about the Nike Cortez .\nThe vintage runner just dropped in a new “Nai Ke” colorway in both men’s and women’s sizes. For its latest look, the Classic Cortez celebrates footwear culture in China with a “Nai ke” theme. A classic, white, royal and varsity red outfits the design, coupled with special branding at the heel.\nGrab your pair now (for men and women) at select Nike retailers for $90.\nvia: Nike \nAuthor’s Take Not really a fan of the Cortez so I’ll pass on these. The colorway is pretty clean though. Definitely has that OG vibe to it.\n\nThe post The Nike Cortez Nai Ke Is Now Available appeared first on KicksOnFire.com .",

      "text": "The winners of the 2016 auto lacing Nike Mag were announced in mid-October and if you entered the raffle you were probably glued to your phone for a couple of hours that day awaiting that notification on the Nike+ app. But unfortunately very few people received good news as there were only 89 pairs made available. Three pairs were auctioned off to charity, so that means that there was supposed to be 86 pairs won through the raffle system.\nThe company that ran the raffle through Nike’s The Draw is required to make the list of winners public and we have the names of the winners here for you. The strange thing is that there’s only 81 names, so there’s five pairs that are unaccounted for. Here is the official list of winners.\nSize 7 Winners\nCharlene A.\nRex A.\nJamilah C.\nPhilip H.\nTammie J.\nKeegan K.\nChanica K.\nMichael O.\nCorazon R.\nGurson S.\nJiahao Y.\nSize 9 Winners\nFelton A.\nMike C.\nJacky C.\nChristopher D.\nJose D.\nChristina D.\nKareem E.\nLuis G.\nRunchao H.\nYifeng L.\nMayra R.\nDavid R.\nManuel R.\nRyan T.\nSpencer T.\nNomeet V.\nRodolfo V.\nMark W.\nJerry Y.\nTony Z.\nSize 11 Winners\nAdnan A.\nJens A.\nChance B.\nLeon B.\nQuinten D.\nLatoya D.\nRichard E.\nKevin F.\nHaunting G.\nJack H.\nTajwarul I.\nChristopher J.\nVahram K.\nMardig K.\nZachary L.\nErika M.\nRaphael M.\nDavid M.\nDillon M.\nJias N.\nIan O.\nFreddy O.\nArthur P.\nJordan R.\nDemetrio R.\nJoshua R.\nBarry R.\nDavis S.\nLeVale S.\nAnthony T.\nMaralee W.\nBroderick W.\nDale W.\nSize 13 Winners\nDon A.\nAaron B.\nDavid C.\nChris C.\nChris C.\nAlbert G.\nMatthew H.\nBlair J.\nBenjamin K.\nMichael M.\nKyriakos M.\nPhillip N.\nKat R.\nCuong T.\nJared T.\nJeff W.\nClaudia W.\nh/t: Sole Collector \n\nThe post Here’s An Official List Of The 2016 Nike Mag Winners appeared first on KicksOnFire.com .",

      "text": "The last time we covered any kind of information regarding the Nike LeBron 14 was a couple months ago when we let you know that the 14th Nike LeBron signature shoe would be making its debut sometime during the month of January (2017). We’re now one month away from the new year and the info on the shoe is still at a minimum.\nThis is what we know so far.\nThe Nike LeBron 14 will release in January It is being reported that it will retail at $175 That’s about it. We had initially thought that this was the Nike LeBron 14 , but this latest info coming out of ESPN proves that that is not the case.\nDave McMenamin from ESPN recently reported that LeBron James was warming up in an all-black pair of LeBron 14’s during a shootaround in Cleveland this morning. As soon as LeBron saw the reporters he was quick to take off the shoes before any kind of pictures were taken. McMenamin stated that the shoe LeBron was wearing was not the shoe we initially thought was the LeBron 14. Reason being, the one he got glance at came with a strap. Being that LeBron favors his strap-equipped LeBron Soldier model, it would not be a surprise to see that the LeBron 14 could also come equipped with a strap.\nThis is what McMenamin had to say about what he saw.\n \n“ LeBron James wore an all black pair of the yet-to-be-released Nike LeBron 14 to shootaround Thursday but took them off before talking to the press so reporters couldn’t snap photos of them. They don’t look like the images that leaked in August at all. James let ESPN.com inspect them, as long as we promised not to take a photo, and they are very sharp.

      "text": "Nike's Self Lacing HyperAdapt 1.0 Is Cool AF! You've GOT To See This Adaptive Lacing Hi-Tech Shoe In Action. Print Share   \nWhy is this important? \nSneakerheads around the world have been breathlessly waiting for the self-lacing HyperAdapt 1.0 from Nike. \nLong Story Short \nFollowing the hype of the self-lacing \"Back To The Future\" Air Mags, Nike has finally released another silhouette powered by adaptive lacing. This pair retails at a cool $720 (Rs 50,000 approx.), and released today in the US and will be available only across two Nike stores in New York as of now. \nLong Story \nThe self-lacing mechanism is similar to the Air Mags (remember Marty McFly’s self-lacing sneakers from Back to the Future Part II ?). The auto-buckling system resembles the way roller blades tighten. This is the first self-lacing shoe that will be directly available to the public. \nWhile these kicks are a definite dream for any professional athlete (you really don't want to be tying shoe laces midfield, halting a splendid match), copping a pair for yourself is sure to place you right up on the ladder of hypebeasts. \nThe Hyperadapt 1.0 has a lightweight silhouette with a black and white lagoon colourway, which is going to be followed by metallic silver, black, and white colour ways soon. \nTiffany Beers, Senior Innovator at Nike Inc, explains, \"When you step in, your heel hits a sensor and the system automatically tightens. Then there are two buttons on the side to tighten and loosen. You can adjust it until it is perfect.\" Can lacing up be more fly? We think not. \nSince this is going to be battery operated, it made sense for the brand to include LED lights into the sole (talk about going hi-tech!) that showcase the battery life. Every full charge claims to make the battery last for a minimum of 2 weeks. DOPE. \nWe're keeping our fingers crossed hoping for a India release soon.",

      "title": "Nike Rolls Out High Tech Sneakers to Boost Direct Sales",
      "text": "By Sara Germano\nNike Inc. this week begins selling a pricey sneaker with self-tying laces, a high-stakes test of the company's technology investments and efforts to sell more products directly to consumers.\nSince its founding, Nike has predominantly been a wholesaler. But as shopping shifts online, Nike is moving to lessen its reliance on retailers. It wants to double its direct sales to consumers to $16 billion by 2020, particularly as rivals Adidas AG and Under Armour Inc. have become more competitive in recent years.\nThat is where the self-lacing $720 HyperAdapt sneakers play a role. The company is offering the shoes exclusively on its relaunched Nike+ app and at a new retail store in New York City, beginning on Thursday. The idea is to hook consumers into buying via its app or visiting Nike stores for limited-edition sneaker releases, which to date has been a near-weekly phenomenon at Foot Locker and other retailers.\nThe move could put the squeeze on an already consolidating sporting goods retail industry, analysts say. Nike currently is the single-largest vendor to big chains like Dick's Sporting Goods Inc., Foot Locker Inc. and Finish Line Inc., accounting for 20%, 72%, and 73% of merchandise purchased, respectively, according to regulatory filings.\n\"They have to be worried about it,\" said John Kernan, senior retail analyst for brokerage Cowen & Co. He pointed to recent efforts by Dick's to create some of its own products and provide more shelf space to Under Armour and Adidas. Dick's didn't respond to a request for comment.\nKasper Rorsted, the new chief executive of Adidas, said of the self-lacing shoes, \"I don't know if that's a save-the-world product,\" but sales through mobile devices and apps will continue to grow within the industry.\nAsked for his perspective on the HyperAdapt launch, Foot Locker CEO Dick Johnson said on a November earnings call that Nike has \"very limited peers in the marketplace\" and has the bandwidth to launch some of its product via its own retail channels.\nThe HyperAdapt release comes after a decade of changes within Nike to expand into technology and consumer services.\n\"There was a moment of realization, when Nike people looked around and saw everyone running around with an iPod, that was when we knocked on the door of Apple,\" said Roberto Tagliabue, who was a director of digital innovation at Nike from 2005 through 2009.\nHe oversaw the launch of the first Nike+ product, a sensor placed in running shoes that synced with early iPods. The idea was to keep customers communicating with Nike long after they left the store.\nBeth Sasseen, a recruiter who worked at Nike from 2007 to 2009, said her focus was on finding tech-savvy talent who could help develop more personalized products and software to better engage with consumers. Nike \"was trying to be ahead of the game,\" she said.\nNike's push into tech wasn't without its setbacks. The original Nike+ sensor evolved into a series of wristbands, including the FuelBand, first launched in 2012. But it was discontinued in 2014 when the company decided to scrap hardware development altogether and focus on software and apps.\nMeanwhile, Under Armour purchased a suite of fitness-tracking apps between 2013 and 2015 to create a network of more than 190 million users to market more shirts and shoes. Another fitness app, Strava, is popular among Nike employees, who have recorded thousands of runs around their Beaverton, Ore.,campus, according to interviews with staffers and data from Strava's website.\nNike began upgrading training apps of its own, including Nike+ Run Club and Nike+ Training Club, which include coaching tips from star athletes like Serena Williams and Ashton Eaton. The company returned to the gadget market this fall with a swoosh-branded version of the Apple Watch.\nMr. Tagliabue, who has since started his own Silicon Valley design firm, said Nike operates differently than other tech firms. \"They cannot bring to market products that are not perfect\" and risk damaging the brand, he said. \"At Nike, sometimes you can get frustrated because things go slow.\"\nNike's digital sport team has spent roughly $100 million on software products, including the new Nike + app, over the past four years, according to a person familiar with the matter. The department has also been hit by turnover, with some members departing for Under Armour, Alphabet Inc.'s Google and others, the person said.\nNike said it doesn't disclose spending figures. The company announced in February it was naming Adam Sussman as chief digital officer, shortly before the HyperAdapt shoes and new apps were unveiled. Development on self-lacing technology began over a decade ago, and today's HyperAdapts are intended to be the first version of what Nike calls \"adaptive performance\" products.\nSo far, some Nike aficionados are excited about the futuristic shoes, if not the price. Hunter Harpin of North Adams, Mass., said he buys a pair of custom Nikes every year but the HyperAdapts just aren't worth the extra cost.\n\"It takes me two seconds to tie my own shoes,\" he said, \"so I think I'd have a $200 limit on self-lacing sneakers.\"\nWrite to Sara Germano at sara.germano@wsj.com\nDecember 01, 2016 08:14 ET (13:14 ",

Returning after a 15-year hiatus, the silhouette will serve this week as a global exclusive to Kith’s new Miami flagship store. The 2016 version of the rare silhouette will feature pretty much the same aesthetics as the OG model, only difference now is the more narrow look of the shoe. Initially debuting in 2001 as a Japanese exclusive regional release, the version of the shoe features a tan premium leather upper with hits of pink on the Swoosh logo, midsole and outsole. \nTo further the festivities of this sneaker release, Kith and Nike are tapping contemporary artist Futura to create a one-of-a-kind piece of art as well as a select number of custom Nike boxes. Kith’s Miami flagship store location is set to open its doors this Friday, Dec. 2, and will be located at 1931 Collins Ave. The Nike Air Force 1 Linen is set to raffle on four different days after the Kith Miami grand opening. 40 Hip-Hop Albums Turning 20 in 2016 Image of",

The innocuous ‘Photo Blue’ Zoom All Out here is more mandarin shirt than turtle neck, and comes with engineered mesh trimmed below the ankle. The midsole – which houses the imaginative, tensile string-based cushioning system – is then showcased in a translucent blue bubble. \nThe Nike Zoom All Out Low is available now from Nike online . \nMore Nike",

      "text": "Twitter As stealthy as footwear gets in 2016. \nNike's Flyknit Racers were an undisputed a game-changer in the sneaker industry when they were released in 2012. Not only were they incredibly lightweight and almost sci-fi in their futuristic appeal, but they instantly became go-to footwear for stylish men—not just those hitting the track. There was a deluge of Nike Flyknits in street style galleries and it didn't take long for the silhouette to reach near-iconic status. These days, Nike Flyknits are as commonplace as any other sneakers. And while the always-innovating Nike has worked tirelessly to improve upon the style, it's the original model that, in our humble opinion, still looks the best. And yesterday, the brand made things even better when they released the original Flyknit Racer in an undeniably cool all-black colorway. \nWhat made Nike Flyknits spark with the masses—its almost painful-to-look-at \"volt\" colorway that was marketing gold—has now been completely inverted in this stealthy iteration. The \"triple black\" craze has taken over not just Nike, but brands like Adidas (which just released its all-black Ultra Boost today) and Under Armour (which dropped its all-black Curry 3 on Black Friday). What is about all-black sneakers that make them so covetable? Maybe it's that they look badass. Maybe it's that they make planning the rest of your outfit easy and look awesome with a gray suit. (And in some cases even work with a dressed-down tuxedo.) Or maybe it's they get less dirty than their all-white counterparts.",

      "title": "Nike's Self-Lacing 'HyperAdapt' Sneaker: More Than A Gimmick",
      "text": "The release of Nike’s ( NKE ) self-lacing “HyperAdapt” sneaker on Thursday is more than a gimmicky nod to Marty McFly’s footwear of choice in “Back To The Future” – it’s a crucial part of the venerable apparel brand’s effort to distinguish itself from burgeoning competition.\nThe HyperAdapt 1.0, which features an adaptive sensor that automatically adjusts the sneaker’s nylon “laces” to fit the wearer’s feet, will be available in “limited quantities” with a price tag of $720. Purchasing the sneakers will be no easy feat, as they will initially only be available at select Nike stores in New York City and customers must make an appointment through the NIKE+ app or the company’s website.\nGiven its limited release and prohibitive cost, HyperAdapt’s value to Nike’s overall brand is more about marketing than sales figures. As Under Armour ( UA ) and Adidas pursue increasing shares of the United States sports apparel marketplace, Nike is leaning on its penchant for innovation to lure consumers away from its competitors.\n“Innovation at Nike is not about dreaming of tomorrow. It’s about accelerating toward it,” famed shoe designer Tinker Hatfield said in a press release last March. “We’re able to anticipate the needs of athletes because we know them better than anybody. Sometimes, we deliver a reality before others have even begun to imagine it.”\nMore on this... Under Armour Investors Punish CEO Kevin Plank Nike's 'Back To The Future' Sneakers Score Big For Charity For Nike, Competition Is Only Part Of The Problem HyperAdapt’s entrance comes at a critical time in the sports apparel marketplace. After reaching a record high in 2015, Nike’s stock price has plunged significantly in 2016 amid the collapse of retail partner Sports Authority and shifting consumer tastes. Several Wall Street firms have expressed concern about Nike’s ability to hit its target of $50 billion in revenue by 2020, given Adidas’ recent success in North America and Under Armour’s rapid growth.\nAnalysts from several firms have repeatedly identified innovation as a key area in which Nike can separate from the pack – especially if customers are willing to pay a premium for select products.\n ",

      "text": "what would marty mcfly do? hyperadapt nike technology self-tying sneakers shoes retail \nIf you’re looking for Nike sneakers with self-tying laces, don’t go to FootLocker or Dick’s Sporting Goods: In an attempt to move away from relying on sports retailers to peddle its wares, Nike is cutting out the middleman and selling its new, pricey HyperAdapt shoes directly to consumers. \nLet’s hope Marty McFly has been saving his pennies since 1984, because Nike’s new sneakers are far from cheap at $720 a pair, and you can only find them on the brand’s Nike+ app and at its new retail store in New York City, starting today. \nThe company is hoping to move away from the wholesale model and get consumers used to going directly to the source when shopping: Nike wants to double direct sales to consumers to $16 billion by 2020, The Wall Street Journal reports, in order to stay competitive with rivals like Adidas and Under Armour. \nThat’s something the sporting goods retail industry will definitely notice, analysts say, as Nike is the single-largest vendor to Dick’s Sporting Goods, Foot Locker, and Finish Line. \n“They have to be worried about it,” John Kernan, senior retail analyst for brokerage Cowen & Co. told the WSJ. \nNike’s push into direct-to-consumer sales isn’t a sudden shift, it comes after a decade of work to expand its technology and consumer services. To that end, the company’s digital sport team has spent about $100 million on software products, including the Nike+ app, in the last four years, the WSJ notes. \nWill its investments pay off? Will anyone actually want to pay $720 simply to cut out the task of tying one’s own shoes? That remains to be seen. ",

      "text": "Nike's Newest Sneaker Loosens Ties to Retailers Nike Inc. (NKE) -- WSJ December 02, 2016, 02:47:  By Sara Germano \nProfile \nNike Inc. this week begins selling a pricey sneaker with self-tying laces, a high-stakes test of the company's technology investments and efforts to sell more products directly to consumers. \nThat is where the self-lacing $720 HyperAdapt sneakers play a role. The company is offering the shoes exclusively on its relaunched Nike+ app and at a new retail store in New York City, beginning on Thursday. The idea is to hook consumers into buying via its app or visiting Nike stores for limited-edition sneaker releases, which to date has been a near-weekly phenomenon at Foot Locker and other retailers. \nThe move could put the squeeze on an already consolidating sporting goods retail industry, analysts say. Nike currently is the single-largest vendor to big chains like Dick's Sporting Goods Inc., Foot Locker Inc. and Finish Line Inc., accounting for 20%, 72%, and 73% of merchandise purchased, respectively, according to regulatory filings. \n\"They have to be worried about it,\" said John Kernan, senior retail analyst for brokerage Cowen & Co. He pointed to recent efforts by Dick's to create some of its own products and provide more shelf space to Under Armour and Adidas. Dick's didn't respond to a request for comment. \nKasper Rorsted, the new chief executive of Adidas, said of the self-lacing shoes, \"I don't know if that's a save- the-world product,\" but sales through mobile devices and apps will continue to grow within the industry. \nAsked for his perspective on the HyperAdapt launch, Foot Locker CEO Dick Johnson said on a November earnings call that Nike has \"very limited peers in the marketplace\" and has the bandwidth to launch some of its product via its own retail channels. \nThe HyperAdapt release comes after a decade of changes within Nike to expand into technology and consumer services. \n\"There was a moment of realization, when Nike people looked around and saw everyone running around with an iPod, that was when we knocked on the door of Apple,\" said Roberto Tagliabue, who was a director of digital innovation at Nike from 2005 through 2009. \nHe oversaw the launch of the first Nike+ product, a sensor placed in running shoes that synced with early iPods. The idea was to keep customers communicating with Nike long after they left the store. \nBeth Sasseen, a recruiter who worked at Nike from 2007 to 2009, said her focus was on finding tech-savvy talent who could help develop more personalized products and software to better engage with consumers. Nike \"was trying to be ahead of the game,\" she said. \nNike's push into tech wasn't without its setbacks. The original Nike+ sensor evolved into a series of wristbands, including the FuelBand, first launched in 2012. But it was discontinued in 2014 when the company decided to scrap hardware development altogether and focus on software and apps. \nMeanwhile, Under Armour purchased a suite of fitness-tracking apps between 2013 and 2015 to create a network of more than 190 million users to market more shirts and shoes. Another fitness app, Strava, is popular among Nike employees, who have recorded thousands of runs around their Beaverton, Ore.,campus, according to interviews with staffers and data from Strava's website. \nNike began upgrading training apps of its own, including Nike+ Run Club and Nike+ Training Club, which include coaching tips from star athletes like Serena Williams and Ashton Eaton. The company returned to the gadget market this fall with a swoosh-branded version of the Apple Watch. \nMr. Tagliabue, who has since started his own Silicon Valley design firm, said Nike operates differently than other tech firms. \"They cannot bring to market products that are not perfect\" and risk damaging the brand, he said. \"At Nike, sometimes you can get frustrated because things go slow.\" \nNike's digital sport team has spent roughly $100 million on software products, including the new Nike + app, over the past four years, according to a person familiar with the matter. The department has also been hit by turnover, with some members departing for Under Armour, Alphabet Inc.'s Google and others, the person said. \nNike said it doesn't disclose spending figures. The company announced in February it was naming Adam Sussman as chief digital officer, shortly before the HyperAdapt shoes and new apps were unveiled. Development on self-lacing technology began over a decade ago, and today's HyperAdapts are intended to be the first version of what Nike calls \" adaptive performance\" products. \nSo far, some Nike aficionados are excited about the futuristic shoes, if not the price. Hunter Harpin of North Adams, Mass., said he buys a pair of custom Nikes every year but the HyperAdapts just aren't worth the extra cost. \n\"It takes me two seconds to tie my own shoes,\" he said, \"so I think I'd have a $200 limit on self-lacing sneakers.\" \nWrite to Sara Germano at sara.germano@wsj.com (END) Dow Jones Newswires 12-02-160247ET Copyright (c) 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Tim Newcomb  02 am. 6:02 am 5 Stylish Snow-Ready Sneakers to Keep You Warm This Winter New Balance (top), Vans (center), Nike (bottom) \nOur sneakers get us through the milder seasons with no problems. But when winter rolls in, they go back into the closet and we bust out the boot collection. Sure, heavier footwear is preferred for cleaning the gutters or shoveling the sidewalk. But when loaded with the right features and technology, sneakers can stand up to winter weather too. Here are five models that will keep your feet warm and dry in the coldest months. Nike Nike Lunar Force 1 Flyknit \nAs part of an annual tradition, Nike releases a line of “sneakerboots” every fall. This year, design director Dylan Raasch wanted to do something unexpected, so his team took the lightweight breathable upper from Nike’s Flyknit line and made it water-repellent. By incorporating a new thermoplastic rubber into the yarn, the summery Flyknit material can now take on the winter elements, shedding rain and surviving the odd puddle. A new durable, water-repellent finish helps seal the gaps in a Flyknit construction while letting the material maintain breathability and a comfortable stretch. \nThe four sneakers in Nike’s new collection all have a more rugged aesthetic. Along with the Air Presto Mid Utility, Lupinek Flyknit, and Roshe Two Hi Flyknit, the iconic Air Force 1 basketball sneaker has been refashioned into the Lunar Force 1 Flyknit Workboot ($200). Leather overlays and a gusseted tongue help protect from moisture, and a beefed-up rubber outsole offers durability and traction. An inner sleeve features zones of soft wool to bring warmth. \nHow it performs: The Lunar Force 1 Flyknit lives up to its water-repellent name without bringing full waterproofing. Typical rain gets pushed aside, but a sudden deluge of powerful water can get through. The elevated rugged outsole performs well in wet conditions and the added wool really ups the winter comfort. Vans Vans Sk8-Hi Mountain Edition \nWhether or not you want to take your skateboard through the slick rain-soaked streets, Vans has footwear options that extend beyond sunny days. In its Mountain Edition collection, Vans has upgraded some classic designs with weather-resistant tech. \nThe most prominent choice in the MTE line is the Sk8-Hi MTE ($85). It comes with either a leather or suede upper, both Scotchguard-treated to keep the water out. A gusseted tongue eliminates openings in the sneaker’s upper for further protection. Inside, Vans uses warm linings, such as fleece, and additional padding. A thermal heat-retention layer (vacuum-coated aluminum strobel board) between the sockliner and outsole to retain up to nine degrees of heat within the shoe. The MTE outsole borrows from the snow boot history of the company. The lug design provides rugged grip and traction akin to a work boot or snow boot by pushing snow or slush out the side of the outsole instead of letting it pile up inside the traction pattern. \nHow it performs: The Sk8-Hi MTE has the look of a premium Vans sneaker, but it performed admirably in winter weather. The leather upper easily shunned rain—even sudden dumps of it. It’s still leather, so don’t be shocked with a little build-up. The fleece lining provides warmth, and the outsole offers solid traction without a blemishing the skateboard-ready aesthetic by making it look too much like a boot. Adidas Adidas EQT Winter Wool \nPesky precipitation isn’t the only wintry weather our feet must endure. It gets plenty cold too. Adidas’s solution is to wrap the foot in wool. Stylish wool, at that. \nThe Adidas Original EQT silhouette, a classic 1990s model currently enjoying a resurgence, takes on our upcoming season with its Winter Wool variety ($140). The entire upper above the high-standing rubber outsole is already built for rough terrain, but here it gets embraced by a grey wool, at times double-layered for additional warmth. Adding leather on the collar lining, toecap, tongue tag, and heel tab add another touch of protection. A robust outsole with oversized nodes of traction help grip and elevate the foot off the ground—a key detail when you encounter a stray puddle. \nHow it performs: The Adidas EQT Winter Wool does what it says, providing plenty of warmth. The oversized outsole provides extra traction and a bit of relief from any splashes you may encounter. Extra leather near the outsole and in the heel tab adds protection. Unlike the rest of the winter crowd, the shoe isn’t a high-top and has a more refined style. New Balance New Balance 910v3 Gore-Tex \nSometimes style isn’t all you need. Performance has its place too. New Balance knows this and partnered with Gore-Tex to winterize running shoes, everything from the typical street runner (the 880v6 has Gore-Tex) to the trail-ready 910v3 ($135). \nThe worst part about testing a pair of waterproof running shoes is running in the wind and rain. But the best part is searching for the next puddle to splash into. The Gore-Tex membrane made the 910v3 perfect for a wet run. \nIn this shoe, Boston-based New Balance added a new technology to its rubber compound it calls “HydroHesion,” which is meant to provide more grip in water. A protective layer of foam and TPU film has been placed under the foot to distribute the pressure of sharp objects (like rocks and roots) you’d find on the trail. There’s also an additional layer of toe protection. Even with all the armor, the running sneaker remains a manageable 11.6 ounces and doesn’t look like a super-duty boot. \nHow it performs: The fully waterproof membrane works from the outsole to the shoe’s upper, ensuring a dry foot even if you fully submerge it in a puddle. The only way water even has a chance of getting in is from the top down, but the proper pants or gaiters will alleviate that concern. And dry means warm; the 910v3 uses Gore-Tex and rubber in a winter-friendly way. Nike Converse Chuck II Shield Canvas Boot \nThe top-selling sneaker in history now comes in three styles that are incredibly unfriendly to water. While the Chuck Taylor All Star Tekoa Waterproof Boot uses rubber and leather for waterproofing in a definite boot-like look, there’s also a more minimal design that retains the classic Chuck aesthetic while including technology more fitting for weather-challenged months. \nI tried both styles of waterproof Chucks, the $83 Shield Canvas version and the $130 waterproof leather model. Both include treatments on the materials to keep water from penetrating the initial layer. There’s a gusseted waterproof neoprene tongue and a weatherized gum outsole. More crucial is the interior bootie, which fully wraps the foot and provides an added layer of warmth. This design hides the winterization elements and retains a true Chuck vibe. \nHow it performs: The waterproof Chucks handle the rain just dandy, even the non-leather canvas variety. It can take on buckets of water and still keep your foot dry. The addition of the inner sleeve really serves to make this more than just a stay-dry version of the classic Chuck, giving it a winter-ready warming element for unfriendly climates. \nFollow Tim Newcomb on Twitter at @tdnewcomb .",

Or this: Fitbit (+0.72%) has reportedly agreed to acquire smartwatch maker Pebble for around $40 million, a much lower price tag than previous offers Pebble had allegedly received over the last few years. Pebble is best known for smashing Kickstarter records when it raised over $20 million for its smartwatch through crowdfunding, but has fallen on some hard times due to softened demand for wearables, faulty products and difficulty paying down its debt. Fitbit’s had a struggle of its own, with its stock down 70% year-to-date, so is this acquisition a “misery loves company” play? Not quite. Fitbit’s likely reason for the acquisition is to acquire Pebble’s talent, software and intellectual property, which still hold a ton of value. Let’s hope it works out; the clock is ticking.\nUlta Really Did it This Time \n…And last time, and the time before, and the time before, and the time before . Cosmetics and fragrance giant Ulta Salon (-0.81%) reported third quarter profits of $87.6 million , beating analyst expectations. Gold star? You bet: this is the beauty giant’s eighth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. How is Ulta pulling it off? First, the company has been moving toward e-commerce, responding to the trend of declining in-store sales. Smart. Other growth factors ? New acquisitions, increased Ulta brand awareness, strong loyalty program growth and improving supply chain performance. The company expects high sales in its final quarter, and hopes to continue to wow those analysts.\nA Fancier Brew \n…And a pricier one too. We’re actually talking about coffee here. More specifically, Starbucks: Howard Schultz is stepping down as CEO of the Seattle-based coffee company (-3.26% after hours) to work on Starbucks Reserve Roasteries —a high-end coffee shop reserved for those special snowflakes who are willing to pay $12 for a cup of joe (we’re not judging, we promise). Schultz has stepped down from the CEO post before to work on the company’s IPO and global strategy, which helped the company become an international juggernaut —the hope is that Schultz’s new focus on high-end coffee will lead to similar success. President and COO Kevin Johnson will be taking over as CEO, and Schultz will remain a chairman. This is the company’s biggest move since expanding abroad 20 years ago; let’s hope it lives up to the tastebuds of coffee snobs.\nStep Aside Robots \n…The gas guzzlers are here to stay…at least for now. Despite stalling industry growth after six straight years of gains, five of the top six automakers saw jumps in November’s auto sales report, with a 10% sales spike from General Motors (+5.50%) leading the way. What’s with the sudden growth in a world headed toward self-driving cars? Well, low gas prices and a 13% increase in discounts certainly lent a hand. Interestingly, the average transaction hit a new record high— thank you SUVs . Now that was good news, but the potentially great news is the seemingly newfound optimism about the U.S. economy. All hail November.\nOther Stories \nBillionaire Steve Cohen’s hedge fund to pay $135 million to settle class action suit HBO and Cinemax now available through Amazon Prime Airbnb cracks down on rentals in London, Amsterdam Princess Cruises to pay record-breaking criminal fine for ocean pollution Economic Calendar \nMonday: Government T-Bill Auctions Tuesday: Tiffany (+) Earnings; U.S. Q3 GDP (2nd Estimate) (+) ; Consumer Confidence (+) ; Case-Shiller Home Price Index (+) Wednesday: Royal Bank of Canada (-) , American Eagle (-) , Box (+) Earnings; Private Employment Report (+) ; Pending Home Sales (+/-) ; Beige Book (+) ; Personal Income and Outlays (+/-) Thursday: Kroger (+ /-) , Dollar G eneral (-) , Ulta Salon (+) , Smith & Wesson (-) Earnings; Motor Vehicle Sales (+) ; Weekly Jobless Claims (-) ; PMI Manufacturing Index (+) ; ISM Manufacturing Index (+) ; Construction Spending (+) Friday: Big Lots Earnings; November Jobs Report Time to Lace Up \nGood news if you hate tying your shoes…and if you happen to have $720 to spare. This week, Nike started selling its new sneaker, HyperAdapt . Pushing further into tech and away from wholesale retailers, the shoe has literal self-tying laces, and is only available on the Nike+ app and at the new Nike retail store in New York City. Here’s more:\nThese new sneaks have been in the works for a while. Nike’s digital sport team started development on self-lacing technology nearly a decade ago, and they don’t plan on stopping with HyperAdapts. After shying away from hardware like the 2012 FuelBand (pulled just two years later), Nike has been focusing on software and apps. In just the past four years, Nike has reportedly spent $100 million on software products like the Nike+ app. Nike’s plan to double its direct sales to consumers will no doubt have an impact on big chains. As the industry’s largest vendor, Nike products account for a whopping 72% of Foot Locker merchandise purchased. Interview Question of the Day \nSanta distributes two gifts to every child on the street during Christmas evening. He mistakenly gives four gifts to some children. If he distributed 50 gifts to 21 children, how many children got four gifts? ( Answer )\nBusiness Person of the Day \nAgustin Carstens , the head of Mexico’s central bank, resigned on Thursday. His exit comes with the country’s currency under pressure following the election of Donald Trump, with plenty more trouble to come. He was seen as a central figure in maintaining Mexico’s economic stability and fiscal discipline. Happy trails, Agustin.\nFood for Thought \nA federal jury in Dallas on Thursday ordered Johnson & Johnson and its DePuy Orthopaedics unit to pay more than $1 billion to six plaintiffs who said they were injured by Pinnacle hip implants. The jurors found that the metal-on-metal hip implants were defectively designed and that the companies failed to warn consumers about the risks. Doesn’t sound like a family company to us.\n\n",

Led by a team of innovators drawn from robotic engineering, design and anthropology, Piaggio Fast Forward has the objective to study and develop innovative solutions for mobility, in order to anticipate and fulfil new behaviours and new needs around the world. \n“ We at PFF think that autonomy and tethering will be the drivers that will move people and goods, in the future, ” said Piaggio Fast Forward Chairman Michele Colaninno . “ We will soon show something that goes in that direction, both for business and consumer markets.” \nJohn Hoke commented that he was “ excited to engage in a forward-looking, problem-solving and innovative global brand that has a remarkable history of inspiring and energising human mobility. ” \nMr Hoke, who is responsible for the design of Nike products around the globe, is considered one of the most innovative minds in the field of design applied to technology. He joins an advisory board composed of primary excellences in the world of technology and robotics, like Nicholas Negroponte (co-founder of MIT Media Lab, professor of Media Technology at MIT), Jeff Linnell (founder of Bot & Dolly), and Doug Brent (CTO at Innovation di Trimble). \nThe board will work together with the rest of PFF’s talents, led by Professor Jeffrey Schnapp (CEO of PFF) and architect Greg Lynn (Chief Creative Officer at PFF).

      "text": "Share \nNike’s technology investments are being put to the test this week after the release of its new product, the Nike HyperAdapt. It is a $720 pair of shoes — and these particular kicks come with a set of self-tying laces (think Back To The Future: Part II ). \nThe new sneakers are exclusively being sold on the Nike+ mobile app (and at the swanky new 55,000-square-foot SoHo store ). The HyperAdapt sneakers come as part of a push by the footwear manufacturing company to shift their business model from wholesaler to eCommerce mogul as retail continues to shift online across sectors. Nike reportedly looks to double its direct sales to consumers to $16 billion by 2020. The idea behind the release model is to draw customers into buying via its app or visiting Nike stores for limited-edition merchandise releases in the vein of Footlocker. Nike has also reportedly been upgrading its fitness and training apps like Nike+ Run Club and Nike+ Training Club — and let’s not forget the Nike-branded version of the Apple Watch . In truth, Nike doesn’t want to be outmatched again by its rivals Adidas and Under Armour like during the Rio Olympics. Normally a boost to Nike’s stock price, the 2016 games in Rio saw a dulled reaction from Nike investors — who bumped the stock price up about 1 percent. By comparison, Adidas saw its stock rise 6 percent, while Under Armour saw an uptick of 3 percent. Under Armour is especially a threat to Nike’s eCommerce ambitions. Under Armour has been a hit online, seeing a 71.6 percent increase in online sales in 2016 , adding up to $377.5 million — up from $220 million in 2013. While customers may be drawn in the moment to Nike’s featured high-tech, limited-edition apparel due to their hype factor (self-tying laces are a pretty awesome invention), it is yet to be seen whether this will lead to sustained eCommerce growth.",

      "title": "Nike's Newest Sneaker Loosens Ties to Retailers Nike Inc. (NKE) -- WSJ",
      "text": "Profile\nBy Sara Germano\nNike Inc. this week begins selling a pricey sneaker with self-tying laces, a high-stakes test of the company's technology investments and efforts to sell more products directly to consumers.\nSince its founding, Nike has predominantly been a wholesaler. But as shopping shifts online, Nike is moving to lessen its reliance on retailers. It wants to double its direct sales to consumers to $16 billion by 2020, particularly as rivals Adidas AG and Under Armour Inc. have become more competitive in recent years.\nThat is where the self-lacing $720 HyperAdapt sneakers play a role. The company is offering the shoes exclusively on its relaunched Nike+ app and at a new retail store in New York City, beginning on Thursday. The idea is to hook consumers into buying via its app or visiting Nike stores for limited-edition sneaker releases, which to date has been a near-weekly phenomenon at Foot Locker and other retailers.\nThe move could put the squeeze on an already consolidating sporting goods retail industry, analysts say. Nike currently is the single-largest vendor to big chains like Dick's Sporting Goods Inc., Foot Locker Inc. and Finish Line Inc., accounting for 20%, 72%, and 73% of merchandise purchased, respectively, according to regulatory filings.\n\"They have to be worried about it,\" said John Kernan, senior retail analyst for brokerage Cowen & Co. He pointed to recent efforts by Dick's to create some of its own products and provide more shelf space to Under Armour and Adidas. Dick's didn't respond to a request for comment.\nKasper Rorsted, the new chief executive of Adidas, said of the self-lacing shoes, \"I don't know if that's a save-the-world product,\" but sales through mobile devices and apps will continue to grow within the industry.\nAsked for his perspective on the HyperAdapt launch, Foot Locker CEO Dick Johnson said on a November earnings call that Nike has \"very limited peers in the marketplace\" and has the bandwidth to launch some of its product via its own retail channels.\nThe HyperAdapt release comes after a decade of changes within Nike to expand into technology and consumer services.\n\"There was a moment of realization, when Nike people looked around and saw everyone running around with an iPod, that was when we knocked on the door of Apple,\" said Roberto Tagliabue, who was a director of digital innovation at Nike from 2005 through 2009.\nHe oversaw the launch of the first Nike+ product, a sensor placed in running shoes that synced with early iPods. The idea was to keep customers communicating with Nike long after they left the store.\nBeth Sasseen, a recruiter who worked at Nike from 2007 to 2009, said her focus was on finding tech-savvy talent who could help develop more personalized products and software to better engage with consumers. Nike \"was trying to be ahead of the game,\" she said.\nNike's push into tech wasn't without its setbacks. The original Nike+ sensor evolved into a series of wristbands, including the FuelBand, first launched in 2012. But it was discontinued in 2014 when the company decided to scrap hardware development altogether and focus on software and apps.\nMeanwhile, Under Armour purchased a suite of fitness-tracking apps between 2013 and 2015 to create a network of more than 190 million users to market more shirts and shoes. Another fitness app, Strava, is popular among Nike employees, who have recorded thousands of runs around their Beaverton, Ore.,campus, according to interviews with staffers and data from Strava's website.\nNike began upgrading training apps of its own, including Nike+ Run Club and Nike+ Training Club, which include coaching tips from star athletes like Serena Williams and Ashton Eaton. The company returned to the gadget market this fall with a swoosh-branded version of the Apple Watch.\nMr. Tagliabue, who has since started his own Silicon Valley design firm, said Nike operates differently than other tech firms. \"They cannot bring to market products that are not perfect\" and risk damaging the brand, he said. \"At Nike, sometimes you can get frustrated because things go slow.\"\nNike's digital sport team has spent roughly $100 million on software products, including the new Nike + app, over the past four years, according to a person familiar with the matter. The department has also been hit by turnover, with some members departing for Under Armour, Alphabet Inc.'s Google and others, the person said.\nNike said it doesn't disclose spending figures. The company announced in February it was naming Adam Sussman as chief digital officer, shortly before the HyperAdapt shoes and new apps were unveiled. Development on self-lacing technology began over a decade ago, and today's HyperAdapts are intended to be the first version of what Nike calls \"adaptive performance\" products.\nSo far, some Nike aficionados are excited about the futuristic shoes, if not the price. Hunter Harpin of North Adams, Mass., said he buys a pair of custom Nikes every year but the HyperAdapts just aren't worth the extra cost.\n\"It takes me two seconds to tie my own shoes,\" he said, \"so I think I'd have a $200 limit on self-lacing sneakers.\"\nWrite to Sara Germano at sara.germano@wsj.com\nDecember 02, 2016 02:47 ET (07:47 ",

      "text": "Share This Tweet This \nThis Thursday, sportswear giant Nike will put its HyperAdapt 1.0 on sale, and it's expected to be rare. They are flashy and pricey at USD 720; sneakerheads are sure to hunt in the open for them. \nAccording to Investopedia , there are only two places to purchase the USD 720 self-lacing sneakers - in Nike's New York City stores and on the Nike+ app. Though the price is high, several customers based in New York are expected to afford these sneakers, apart from receiving positive exposure on national television. \nFor more than a decade, Tiffany Beers, Nike's senior innovator, has been working on the project, which began life as a sketch and concept from legendary Air Jordan designer Tinker Hatfield. Beers said that, this could be an absolute mainstream product, in that they have been tested for running, training, and playing basketball, as reported by Tech Crunch . Advertisement \nThe shoes operate on batteries that must be charged for three hours for two weeks of use. The large blue battery lights are on the soles and the five tri-color LEDs are on the rear. \nNike is trying to improve on making the shoes automatically tighten and loosen. There are buttons on the side of the shoe to make fitting adjustments on the shoes. \nThe shoes may fit anyone well but they might also be on the heavy side, and Nike is trying to work on said weight issue by constructing the top of the midsole system out of the company's proprietary lightweight Flyweave material. \nIt look like it's the right time for the HyperAdapt 1.0 to make it in for Nike, since it's been losing its spotlight to German rival Adidas as of late.

      "text": "Profile\nBy Sara Germano\nNike Inc. this week begins selling a pricey sneaker with self-tying laces, a high-stakes test of the company's technology investments and efforts to sell more products directly to consumers.\nSince its founding, Nike has predominantly been a wholesaler. But as shopping shifts online, Nike is moving to lessen its reliance on retailers. It wants to double its direct sales to consumers to $16 billion by 2020, particularly as rivals Adidas AG and Under Armour Inc. have become more competitive in recent years.\nThat is where the self-lacing $720 HyperAdapt sneakers play a role. The company is offering the shoes exclusively on its relaunched Nike+ app and at a new retail store in New York City, beginning on Thursday. The idea is to hook consumers into buying via its app or visiting Nike stores for limited-edition sneaker releases, which to date has been a near-weekly phenomenon at Foot Locker and other retailers.\nThe move could put the squeeze on an already consolidating sporting goods retail industry, analysts say. Nike currently is the single-largest vendor to big chains like Dick's Sporting Goods Inc., Foot Locker Inc. and Finish Line Inc., accounting for 20%, 72%, and 73% of merchandise purchased, respectively, according to regulatory filings.\n\"They have to be worried about it,\" said John Kernan, senior retail analyst for brokerage Cowen & Co. He pointed to recent efforts by Dick's to create some of its own products and provide more shelf space to Under Armour and Adidas. Dick's didn't respond to a request for comment.\nKasper Rorsted, the new chief executive of Adidas, said of the self-lacing shoes, \"I don't know if that's a save-the-world product,\" but sales through mobile devices and apps will continue to grow within the industry.\nAsked for his perspective on the HyperAdapt launch, Foot Locker CEO Dick Johnson said on a November earnings call that Nike has \"very limited peers in the marketplace\" and has the bandwidth to launch some of its product via its own retail channels.\nThe HyperAdapt release comes after a decade of changes within Nike to expand into technology and consumer services.\n\"There was a moment of realization, when Nike people looked around and saw everyone running around with an iPod, that was when we knocked on the door of Apple,\" said Roberto Tagliabue, who was a director of digital innovation at Nike from 2005 through 2009.\nHe oversaw the launch of the first Nike+ product, a sensor placed in running shoes that synced with early iPods. The idea was to keep customers communicating with Nike long after they left the store.\nBeth Sasseen, a recruiter who worked at Nike from 2007 to 2009, said her focus was on finding tech-savvy talent who could help develop more personalized products and software to better engage with consumers. Nike \"was trying to be ahead of the game,\" she said.\nNike's push into tech wasn't without its setbacks. The original Nike+ sensor evolved into a series of wristbands, including the FuelBand, first launched in 2012. But it was discontinued in 2014 when the company decided to scrap hardware development altogether and focus on software and apps.\nMeanwhile, Under Armour purchased a suite of fitness-tracking apps between 2013 and 2015 to create a network of more than 190 million users to market more shirts and shoes. Another fitness app, Strava, is popular among Nike employees, who have recorded thousands of runs around their Beaverton, Ore.,campus, according to interviews with staffers and data from Strava's website.\nNike began upgrading training apps of its own, including Nike+ Run Club and Nike+ Training Club, which include coaching tips from star athletes like Serena Williams and Ashton Eaton. The company returned to the gadget market this fall with a swoosh-branded version of the Apple Watch.\nMr. Tagliabue, who has since started his own Silicon Valley design firm, said Nike operates differently than other tech firms. \"They cannot bring to market products that are not perfect\" and risk damaging the brand, he said. \"At Nike, sometimes you can get frustrated because things go slow.\"\nNike's digital sport team has spent roughly $100 million on software products, including the new Nike + app, over the past four years, according to a person familiar with the matter. The department has also been hit by turnover, with some members departing for Under Armour, Alphabet Inc.'s Google and others, the person said.\nNike said it doesn't disclose spending figures. The company announced in February it was naming Adam Sussman as chief digital officer, shortly before the HyperAdapt shoes and new apps were unveiled. Development on self-lacing technology began over a decade ago, and today's HyperAdapts are intended to be the first version of what Nike calls \"adaptive performance\" products.\nSo far, some Nike aficionados are excited about the futuristic shoes, if not the price. Hunter Harpin of North Adams, Mass., said he buys a pair of custom Nikes every year but the HyperAdapts just aren't worth the extra cost.\n\"It takes me two seconds to tie my own shoes,\" he said, \"so I think I'd have a $200 limit on self-lacing sneakers.\"\nWrite to Sara Germano at sara.germano@wsj.com\n 02, 2016 02:47 ET (07:47 ",

Adidas shares this focus, but its initiatives also have a slant toward sustainability, like its sneakers made from ocean plastic  or another model that uses a biodegradable silk .\nNike has big hopes for its self-lacing technology, and CEO Mark Parker has gone as far as to compare the self-lacing sneaker tech with self-driving cars, saying in an interview with CNBC that it is a \"good analogy\" in terms of mainstream appeal.\nRegardless, for now the HyperAdapt 1.0 is a niche product — a piece of halo-effect technology priced at $720.

      "text": "Actor T.J. Miller made an appearance on the “Ellen” show this week to promote his upcoming film, “Office Christmas Party.” The comedian was serious at first — discussing the election outcome and his adoration for the talk-show host — but later brought on the jokes.\nDuring the episode, which aired Thursday, Miller reappeared for Ellen DeGeneres’ “12 Days of Christmas” gift-giveaway segment and decided to juggle knives. As part of the prank, Miller dropped a knife, and it landed right through his Nike Blazer sneakers. Watch the funny moment below. Related Here's How to Buy the Nike Zoom KD 9 'The Sauce' \nIn the Christmas film , Jennifer Aniston stars alongside Miller (who plays her brother), Jason Bateman, Olivia Munn, Kate McKinnon and Courtney B. Vance. The two siblings butt heads as Aniston’s character threatens to shut down his Chicago branch of their massive company, and in order to save the branch, co-workers come together to throw an epic Christmas party.\nMiller mentioned the “Friends” actress during his interview, telling DeGeneres that she put him in a chokehold during one scene. He said, “She’s method. She really made me gasp for air.”\nAniston also visited the “Ellen” show this week to promote the film, giving us major Cher Horowitz vibes: The actress looked like the “Clueless” character, wearing black boots, a miniskirt and a plaid vest for her appearance.\nWhat’s better than my @edbyellen sunglasses? Jennifer Aniston wearing my ED by Ellen sunglasses. Have you won any gifts from the 12 Days of Giveaways? We're halfway through.

      "title": "Adidas' CEO unleashed a major criticism of Nike's self-lacing sneakers (NKE)",
      "text": "print Adidas CEO Kasper Rorsted. AP/Michel Euler \nNike's first mass consumer self-lacing sneaker, the HyperAdapt 1.0, is now available for purchase in two Nike stores in New York City, and it's poised to change sneakers as we know them. \nBut the technology is not without its skeptics, and one very biased critic — the CEO of Nike's chief rival, Adidas — has cast doubt on its usefulness. \n\"I don't know if that's a save-the-world product,\" Adidas CEO Kasper Rorsted told the Wall Street Journal in an interview published in the paper on Thursday . \nNike's innovations usually revolve around the athlete and the technology that could improve either performance or comfort — of which the self-lacing shoes are an extreme example. Adidas shares this focus, but its initiatives also have a slant toward sustainability, like its sneakers made from ocean plastic or another model that uses a biodegradable silk . \nNike has big hopes for its self-lacing technology, and CEO Mark Parker has gone as far as to compare the self-lacing sneaker tech with self-driving cars, saying in an interview with CNBC that it is a \"good analogy\" in terms of mainstream appeal. \nRegardless, for now the HyperAdapt 1.0 is a niche product — a piece of halo-effect technology priced at $720. Just like with Nike's other innovations, however, self-lacing sneakers will likely trickle down into cheaper models in some form. \nNike's HyperAdapt 1.0. Nike",
