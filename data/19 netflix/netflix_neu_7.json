      "text": "Netflix makes it so easy to keep an entire family’s viewing habits separate thanks to multi-user profiles on a single account. But one thing that’s not so easy—or at least not obvious—is how to stop TV show episodes from auto-playing on a child’s profile.\n\nBinge watching is lots of fun, but not if you’re trying to curb your kids’ viewing time. With auto-play turned on you’re always checking for when the credits start on your kids’ favorite show. An easier strategy is just to turn off auto-play, but it’s not obvious how to do that on a kids’ profile.\n\nTo read this article in full or to leave a comment, please click here",

      "text": "TV Captive (available 9 December)\nCaptive could well be crowned this Christmas’s Making a Murderer-style sleeper hit. Made by the Oscar-winning producers of Man on Wire and Searching for Sugar Man, it’s a slick documentary series about hostage situations, explained by the people who lived through them. Every one is an eye-opener, from the prison riot in Ohio (told by Muslim and Aryan Brotherhood prisoners, and the warden they waged war against) to a Coca-Cola kidnap in Brazil and the retired couple held hostage for over a year by Somali pirates. \nHip-hop Evolution (available now)\nFirst shown on HBO, this four-part documentary about the birth of hip-hop stars everyone from Chuck D to Grandmaster Flash, Russell Simmons and LL Cool J. \n\nTrollhunters (available 23 December) \nGuillermo del Toro’s animated series about a teenager who accidentally finds the Amulet of Daylight, which turns him into a – you guessed it – champion Trollhunter. And if he refuses his new role, trolls will destroy the whole human world.\nDirk Gently’s Holistic Detective Agency \nElijah Wood stars in this goofy sci-fi detective tale based on Douglas Adams’ novel of the same name. \nChristmas catchup TV \nFacebook Twitter Pinterest More intrigue, more gaffes – and more sex than real life … The Crown. Photograph: Alex Bailey/Netflix \nThe Crown \nAfter this annus horribilis, forget the Queen’s speech on Christmas day and spend 10 hours in the company of Claire Foy’s Her Madge instead. Guaranteed, there’ll be more intrigue, more gaffes – and more sex (both horse and human). \nGilmore Girls: A Year in the Life \nIt’s frosty outside and the world has swiftly become a disaster zone. Why not watch the four new feature-length episodes about Rory and Lorelai, the fast-talking, wise-cracking mother-daughter duo? It’s a beautifully wrapped gift, after all. \nLast Chance U \nYou needn’t have even the vaguest grasp of American football to get hooked on this inspiring sports documentary (I’m speaking as someone who doesn’t – and who has.) If you have yet to meet Ronald Ollie and Miss Wagner and Coach Buddy Stephens, please head straight to Scooba, Mississippi and join them. \nFestive films \nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Captivating … Devon Terrell as Barack Obama in Barry. Photograph: Linda Kallerus/AP \nBarry (available 16 December) \nIt’s Obama: the College Years. This captivating biopic, with one of the finest final scenes of any film this year, explores how the only black kid in the class rose to become the leader of the free world. \nHome Alone and Home Alone 2: Lost in New York (available now) \nChris Columbus’s burglary Crimbo classic. Get nostalgic with Kevin McAllister, the Wet Bandits and John Candy as the “polka king of the mid-west”. Plus, if you make it to the second instalment, a cameo from Donald Trump. \nJingle All the Way (available now) \nArnie’s Christmas movie. Need I say more.",

      "text": "TWEET You know the drill: Another month is coming to a close, which means Netflix will be bringing new shows and movies to its slate, while saying goodbye to a few titles. This December's no different, with Netflix's catalogue bidding adieu to a few cult classics (at least Fuller House is coming back for season two!). But you've still got a couple of days before they're gone. Therefore, if you have a spare 10 hours or so, here are six titles — along with the corresponding date they're leaving the streaming service — any binge-watching buff should check out, post haste. American Beauty (Dec. 1) Nowadays, Kevin Spacey is best known for his role as President Frank Underwood (is he more terrifying than Donald Trump? Hard to tell!) in Netflix's House of Cards , but Spacey's finest performance might've been in American Beauty . As a family man going through a mid-life crisis, beginning to fantasize about his teenage daughter's friend, it was an indicting reflection of the American white upper-middle class that still feels poignant in 2016. Source: Paramount Movies/YouTube Event Horizon (Dec. 1) Event Horizon might not be a critically praised sci-fi film , but it is batshit crazy in the most entertaining way. It lies in the film's conceit, in which a spaceship's crew suddenly vanishes and the rescue team soon discovers that the crew had opened a portal to hell. In doing so, the crew went mad — as does Sam Neill's character on the rescue team — and the imagery was so graphic most of it had to be cut from the film. If you're not afraid of gore, or Sam Neill dissecting people, it's a fun ride through literal hell and back. Source: Paramount Movies /YouTube Top Gun (Dec. 1) You need to take the highway to the danger zone at least once with a viewing of Top Gun , the movie starring Tom Cruise that's chock full of cheesy puns, great music and a preposterous amount of testosterone. That testosterone is mostly led through Cruise and fellow pilot Iceman (Val Kilmer), and while Cruise's Maverick seemingly has a love interest in his female flight instructor Charlotte (Kelly McGillis), it's the clear sexual tension between Maverick and Iceman that steals the show. Source: Paramount Movies/YouTube Holes (Dec. 5) Before Shia LaBeouf became a sentient Internet meme, he was a budding child actor that began with a lead role in Disney Channel's Even Stevens . But another LaBeouf childhood staple is Holes , the movie adaptation of the Louis Sachar novel of the same name. LaBeouf plays the film's lead, Stanley Yelnats (yes, his last name is Stanley spelled backwards), who spends his time at a juvenile detention camp literally digging holes for the warden. Unfortunately, it also spawned an awful Holes-theme song that never should be revisited, but we'll leave the link below. Source: Walt Disney Pictures/YouTube The Da Vinci Code (Dec. 14) The first of three films starring Tom Hanks as Robert Langdon is perhaps the best in the Dan Brown -adapted franchise, which isn't saying much . Still, The Da Vinci Code is entertaining viewing if you don't take the premise as seriously as the movie does — hint: It's about the Illuminati . Source: SonyPicsHomeEntWorld/YouTube Spy Kids (Dec. 27) OK, so the Spy Kids sequels left a lot to be desired, but the original still holds up in all its campy glory. The children of the best spies in the world, tasked with saving their spy parents by becoming spies themselves? That's a fun premise for a kids movie, led by one of Hollywood's most entertaining action directors, Robert Rodriguez. It doesn't leave Netflix until Dec. 27, so it's a great movie to check out around Christmas. ",

      "text": "TWEET Judging by the way Gilmore Girls: A Year in the LIfe ended , there's plenty of cause for speculation about a sequel series. [ Editor's note: Spoilers ahead for the entirety of Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life — including the final four words.] The four-part Netflix miniseries was designed as a one-off follow-up to the original WB Gilmore Girls of the early 2000s. But considering the fan response to the fabled \"last four words\" — in which Rory Gilmore told her mother Lorelai that she's pregnant — it's not hard to imagine a need for further Gilmore. Creator Amy Sherman-Palladino is remaining coy at the moment about the possibility, but some members of the cast (including, most vocally, Scott Patterson ) have signaled their interest in more episodes. Now, thanks to a new interview with the H ollywood Reporter , we can add Gilmore matriarch Kelly Bishop to the list. Source: Netflix/YouTube B ishop , who plays grandmother Emily Gilmore, told the publication when asked about doing more episodes that it all comes down to Sherman-Palladino. \"I have to tell you, I'll work with Amy anytime she wants to write something for me,\" Bishop said. \"I always jump at the chance to work with her when I can. She's amazing.\" In addition to Gilmore Girls , Bishop also appeared on Sherman-Palladino's short-lived ABC Family series Bunheads . The star of that show, Sutton Foster, appeared in a special guest role in A Year in the Life . So Bishop's in, but only if the queen is involved. Looks like this is all going to come down to Sherman-Palladino — and Netflix, of course. Like us on Facebook: ",

      "text": "As a whole, this year has been pretty great for sci-fi. From Netflix ’s new episodes of Black Mirror and HBO ’s latest critically-acclaimed drama Westworld to the upcoming Star Wars: R ogue One , we’ve had the pleasure of watching several top-notch works of science fiction. However, there is one dystopian gem that may have escaped your radar. Netflix’s latest thriller, 3% , is an intense look into social class and desperation that at times makes The Hunger Games look tame.\nCreated by Pedro Aguilera, 3% focuses on a society where most of the world lives in abject poverty, save for a special ruling class — those Offshore. People have only one shot to escape the Inland and become one of the lucky higher class. On their 20th birthday, citizens are allowed to go through the Process, a series of interviews, tests, and physical challenges designed to determine whether or not citizens are worthy to go to the Offshore. Of the thousands that compete each year, only 3 percent pass — hence the show’s ominous name. It’s a concept that sounds jarring but not too terrible on paper. But in practice, 3% is horrifying.\nThe Process that these young adults go through is more like a cult than a fair series of tests. Unspoken rules begin to form, alliances and forged and then broken in the next moment, and mental and physical boundaries are tested. It’s that last part that makes 3% so haunting. It’s not unusual to see one of the series’ contestants dramatically commit suicide after failing a round. It’s during those moments that 3% reveals its hidden dark roots. Whereas other post apocalypse shows and movies focus on heroes fighting for family, friends, or loved ones, for many of 3% ’s protagonists, that bigger picture focus is absent. Only a person who has completed the necessary challenges can make it to the Offshore, and it’s the knowledge that absolutely every sin committed is for personal gain that transforms the series from a by-the-numbers sci-fi to a chilling tale about people’s greed.\nThis deeper lesson is further driven home by the series’ solid performances. It’s easy for sci-fi to enter the realm of predictable or ham-fisted, but under the show’s wide-eyed lead Bianca Comparato, who plays Michele Santana, the world’s oddities and dangers feel real. Likewise, the show’s supporting characters, from the instantly lovable and wheelchair-bound Fernando (Michel Gomes) to the jades Joana (Vaneza Oliveira), feel believable. This is a show that takes pains to make its characters grounded. Becasue of that focus, when something really does go wrong, those moments become darkly compelling.\n\nThe series can easily stand on its own merits. From its pacing to its cinematography and set design, 3% is a good and good looking show. However, what is sure to make this series an item of interest in Netflix’s ever-growing arsenal of original programming is its international focus. 3% is Netflix’s first Brazilian series and second series to be produced in Latin America, the first being Club de Cuervos . As Narcos ’ popularity has proven, Netflix’s audience is willing to read subtitles when it comes to original content, but 3% is distinct in that it features subbing and dubbing options. Currently, you can watch the series in its original Portuguese with English, French, Spanish, or Chinese subtitles, or you can opt to watch a dubbed version in either English or Spanish. No matter what option you choose, the variety of methods to watch aligns with Netflix’s growing global focus.\nWatching a series completely dubbed can be distracting for some. Likewise, watching a series with subtitles can be a taxing experience, especially when the title in question is as fast-paced and beautiful as 3%. However, not giving this Brazilian series a chance because of its international roots or because of its sci-fi focus would be a mistake. 3% is Netflix’s dystopian secret gem that’s worth an eight episode binge.\n[ Stream 3% on Netflix ]\nShare this: Share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) WhatsApp Click to email (Opens in new window)",

      "text": "Tweet \nThe revival of Gilmore Girls on Netflix inspired more anticipation than almost anything scheduled to hit TV this fall. Now we're getting some indication of the reaction to the revival miniseries, and unlike the season premiere of The Walking Dead , it looks like viewers think Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life was worthy of the hype. \nAccording to media-statistics company Symphony Advanced Media, A Year in the Life is the third-most-watched new series on Netflix this year, behind the first season of Fuller House and the fifth season of Orange is the New Black . Fuller House, Symphony says, got 7.3 million views immediately following its debut, and OITNB pulled in 5.8 million views. Gilmore Girls got 5 million views in its first three days, and there's some indication that the series could remain strong longer than both Fuller House and OITNB. \nIt's wise to view Symphony's numbers with some skepticism, though. The company uses unproven technology to calculate its numbers, and it uses a small sample size to extrapolate broad viewership totals. Netflix itself, the only entity that has indisputable viewership numbers, has called Symphony's data \"remarkably inaccurate.\" \nThat doesn't mean that Gilmore Girls isn't a huge hit. It just means that, like always, only Netflix knows for sure. Read the latest news on:",

      "text": "Nathalie Caron Fri, Dec 02, 2016 6:24pm \nNetflix has released the first trailer for Legendary Pictures’ upcoming sci-fi action movie Spectral . The film is directed by Nic Mathieu from a screenplay written by George Nolfi ( The Bourne Ultimatum, The Adjustment Bureau ) based on a story by Ian Fried ( Singularity ) and Mathieu. \nAlthough Mathieu is a relative unknown (it’s actually his first movie), the fact that Nolfi wrote the script gives Spectral some solid geek cred. The storyline centers on a group of badass Special Ops soldiers led by the always awesome James Badge Dale ( The Pacific, Iron Man 3, 13 Hours ) engaged in a fight against some otherworldly ghost thingies in a European city (it was filmed in Budapest). What’s not to like? That and the fact that the trailer below actually looks really, really good. \nSpectral also stars Bruce Greenwood ( Star Trek ), Emily Mortimer ( Shutter Island ), Max Martini ( 13 Hours, Pacific Rim ), Clayne Crawford ( Lethal Weapon ) and Ryan Robbins ( Sanctuary ) and boasts some impressive special effects by Weta Digital ( The Lord of the Rings , anyone?) with the soldier’s weapons designed by Weta Workshop. They even tapped Junkie XL ( Batman v Superman, Deadpool ) to score the movie. Which is a score for the Netflix original movie and yes, it's a very bad pun. It's the weekend, you guys. Here’s the synopsis: The film follows a brilliant DARPA scientist who goes on a deadly mission with a Special Ops team of Delta Force soldiers into a war-torn city where mysterious phantom aggressors code-named Spectral have been causing inexplicable civilians deaths. \nSpectral will land in theaters and on Netflix (much like Beasts of No Nations ) on Dec. 9.

The answer will come when \" Spectral \" premieres on Netflix on December 9\nStaring James Badge Dale, Emily Mortimer and Bruce Greenwood, the film is set in a war-torn European city in the near future that has become possessed by an invisible enemy force from another world.\nAlthough publicised as a Netflix original, the film was once a Universal/Legendary Pictures production. Rather than a theatrical release, the studios decided in November to sell the film's distribution to Netflix instead.\nHelmed by first-time director Nic Mathieu and with effects courtesy of Peter Jackson's Weta, \"Spectral\" will be available to stream starting December 9.",

Your holidays travel plans are about to get a lot more bearable — after years of gentle nudging and downright pleading from subscribers, Netflix has finally launched an offline viewing mode for its smartphone and tablet-using streaming customers.\nThe new service, which will be available worldwide beginning this week, will allow Netflix users to download select movies and TV shows from the network’s vast library, to be watched in whatever Wi-Fi-less place the day takes you — be it a car, subway train, or dial-up-using relative’s house. “While many members enjoy watching Netflix at home, we’ve often heard they also want to continue their Stranger Things binge while on airplanes and other places where internet is expensive or limited,” Eddy Wu, the company’s director of product innovation, wrote in an official blog post announcing the new service. Not all of the network’s offerings will be available for download, but those that are including several of Netflix’s original series, including The Crown, Narcos, and Orange is the New Black — will feature a tiny button that allows you to “Download now to watch offline later.” More titles will be added in the coming weeks.",

We’ve contacted Netflix to find out for sure, and are now trying to write with every single finger crossed. \nPerhaps with hours of back to back episodes we’ll finally learn that middle bit of the full theme tune. \nImagine hours and hours of Carlton’s dance, Uncle Phil’s admonishments, and Jeffrey. Oh Jeffrey. Get the snacks in now. \nWe are not the only ones who are insanely excited about this. ",

      "text": "The ratings have been released for the opening weekend of A Year In The Life , the Gilmore Girls revival that had all of Twitter buzzing before it was released, and complaining about it after. The four episode Netflix series averaged 4.9 million viewers in the 18-49 demographic, the rating most often tracked by TV networked, though it means a little less an an advertisement-free Netflix work. That number was good enough to trounce the openings of Luke Cage and Daredevil by more than 1.5 million average viewers in the demo, though their first episode numbers alone beat Gilmore Girls ‘ first episode, showing the Marvel shows appear to suffer from a severe dropoff, just like their comics.\nAs more numbers come in, Gilmore Girls may even end up rating higher than the last season of Orange Is The New Black . It’s an impressive performance for the show, and a good sign for fans of bringing popular shows from the past back from the dead.\nOn that subject, of course, we know what you really want to know. Did Gilmore Girls beat Fuller House , the revival of the popular 80s sitcom that sees DJ Tanner hilariously widowed by a tragic firefighting accident and forced to raise her kids as a grieving, single parent while wacky high jinx ensue? Well, you can rest easy. Bleeding Cool’s favorite show still reigns supreme, with an impressive 7.3 million viewers in the 18-49 demographic for it’s first season.\nAnd with Fuller House Season 2 set to be released on December 9, we have a chance for it to take the number one AND number two spots, if all of us binge watch it enough times over the holidays, or if Bleeding Cool’s top Fuller House correspondent Christine Marie individually watches it 5 million times. Come on, little bleeders! We can make this happen!\nVia The Wrap",

Now you can watch on your lunch break, on the plane and at stop lights while driving in the back seat of a chauffeured vehicle.\nONLY ON NETFLIX: Why Rory Gilmore is the worst person ever\nTo be clear, there are some caveats. Some popular Netflix originals like \"Orange is the New Black,\" \"House of Cards,\" and \"Stranger Things\" are not included. Any movie or show made by Walt Disney is also unavailable. There's still a whole lot that is available though.\nThe Associated Press points out that this move puts Netflix in competition with Amazon.com which has been allowing subscribers to download for the last year. It also puts it ahead of services like HBO Now and Hulu which don't.\nBEST NEW SHOWS: Make sure you don't miss these\nSo now that you have the option, what should you be watching? We've compiled a list of all the new shows coming to Netflix, Amazon Prime and Hulu in the slideshow above.\nThere's some good stuff coming out. Just make sure to keep the aforementioned caveats in mind.",

      "text": "Michael Che isn't known to shy away from controversy behind the desk of \"Weekend Update\" on \"Saturday Night Live.\" His Netflix comedy special, is no different. \"Michael Che Matters,\" predictably, confronts discussions around the Black Lives Matter movement — including its opponents.\n\"They don't tell you black lives don't matter,\" the comedian and former \"Daily Show\" correspondent tells his audience at Brooklyn's Greenpoint Terminal Warehouse. \"That's not what they say — that's not the argument. They hit you with that slick sh--. Like, well, 'All lives matter. ' Really, semantics? That would be like if your wife came up to you and was like 'Do you love me?' And you're like, 'Baby, I love everybody, what are you talking about?'\n\"Why do black people always have to get over sh — so quickly?\" Che continues. \"Every time we bring some sh — up. Slavery. 'Oh, that was 400 years ago.' Segregation. 'You guys got Black History Month out of it. We gave you February.' Police shooting. 'That was two weeks — come on, still?' 9/11. 'Oh, never forget.' \"\nChe pauses as the crowd claps and cheers. \"That's why this September, I'm getting a T-shirt that says, 'All buildings matter.' I'm gonna see how that works.\"\nThe one-hour special also finds Che sharing his opinion on president-elect Donald Trump. \"I actually like Donald Trump, to be honest with you,\" he says, leading to a few audible boos. Che's response? \"Shut up.\"\n\"I don't think he should be president,\" Che clarifies. \"But I do think he's ... hilarious and he should be my best friend.\"\nThe special was filmed in August, and Che tells the audience he expects Hillary Clinton to be elected president. But just for kicks, he suggests that maybe — when the country isn't so divided, Trump should get a year in the White House.\n\"When we're doing really good, when it's safe — like when you let a baby drive a little bit,\" Che jokes.\nIn a recent interview with Uproxx, Che noted that the special was taped before nearly a dozen women accused the then-Republican presidential nominee of touching them inappropriately or kissing them without their consent. \"So much has come out about him, which makes him seem like much worse of a dude,\" Che told the site, adding that \"all the bits I do are basically just honest, gut reactions to what I feel hearing this news.\"\nChe said that aspect of comedy was much like some of the statements Trump made during his campaign, and even before he was a candidate.\n\"The stuff that he says about Obama? He didn't know he'd be in this same exact position eight years later and now he has to face it,\" Che told Uproxx. \"And now he's like, 'Well, I think everybody should just be fair and stop protesting the president. I'm the president of everybody.' And go back eight years ago and he's like, 'Everybody protest Obama.' \"\nThe Washington Post",

      "text": "You have an iPhone in your pocket that can stream Netflix, watch sports live, and even download and play movies in HD in an instant, the only problem is you grew up on the cusp of the evolving digital world so a bunch of your favorite movies you already own on DVD. Last time I checked Apple doesn't make a portable DVD drive for you iPhone, which leaves you with a giant media collection that sits on a shelf collecting dust.\nThe way I see it you have two options. One, you bite the bullet and repurchase all the movies you can through iTunes and have them available to you for your viewing pleasure whenever you want, which means spending more money on something you have already purchased before, or you do the smart thing and let iMore help you out.\n\nWhat if you could take all your DVDs and convert them to digital files that can play on your iPhone, iPad, Mac, or any other device? iMore Digital Offers can help you do just that with the MacX Media Management Bundle .\nThis bundle comes with three great programs to help you manage your media like never before. Rip your favorite movies right off a DVD with MacX DVD Ripper Pro, convert that video file to the type of file you need with MacX Video Converter Pro, and then quickly store and transfer all your videos with MacX MediaTrans.\nThis bundle would normally cost you $169.85, but right now iMore Digital Offers can get you the entire bundle for only $19.95 . That's over 85% off the original price!\nDon't waste money buying digital versions of movies you already own, jump on this deal right now and start enjoying all your favorites on any device you may have!\nSee at iMore Digital Offers \n",

      "text": "What's on Netflix > Other > When will Second Half Season 5 of Hell on Wheels come to Netflix When will Second Half Season 5 of Hell on Wheels come to Netflix Tweet \nLooking for the final half of the final season of Hell on Wheels? Then you’ve come to right place as we’re going to look as to when you’ll be streaming the final episodes of this great AMC series. \nThe western TV series was a breath of fresh air and a truly unique show on AMC from its initial air date in 2011 to its finale in mid-July 2016. The series sets out to tell the story off Cullen Bohannon who follows the tracks of a group of Union soldiers who are responsible for the murder of his wife. Throughout the series, we see Bohannon enrolled in multiple roles getting involved in conflicts he wouldn’t have normally got himself into. \nThe series faced some rocky times in its second and third season with the show’s creators departing and writers being dropped and changed frequently. Thankfully, though, the show still maintained a good flow and didn’t go downhill, but it was ultimately given its final season split into two halves as a farewell. \n\nHell on Wheels wrapped up its final season split into two halves which we’ve seen done with AMC’s other big finale just a few years back in the form of Mad Men. The first seven episodes were released of Season 5, which aired on AMC from July 2015 to August 2015 arrived on Netflix in May 2016. \nThe first seven episodes of Hell on Wheels were released on AMC from July 2015 to August 2015 arrived on Netflix US in May 2016. \nThe second half of Hell on Wheels also aired on AMC on the same time span but a year later meaning that won’t affect its Netflix release date. Given how Netflix buys a lot of AMC shows in a yearly fashion. We think that it’s likely we’ll get the final season of Hell on Wheels arriving on Netflix in May 2017 . However, given the show is ending, it may come even sooner as a Netflix release would no longer help in promotion for the show. \nCan you wait until May 2017 to catch up with the final season of Hell on Wheels? Are you sad to see the show end? Let us know in the comments below. Also on What's on Netflix Subscribe to our newsletter",

The White Rabbit Project is about to blow your mind and debunk the unbelievable, but without Adam Savage and Jamie Hyneman.\nInstead, the show is launching with veteran “mythbusters” Kari Byron, Grant Imahara, and Tory Belleci. What happened to the iconic hosts we all equated with the long-running show which blew holes in urban legends since 2003?\nJamie and Adam have proven and disproven hundreds of theories placed in our minds by popular TV shows and movies such as Knight Rider , Indiana Jones , and McGyver . They have called BS on scenes from the James Bond franchise, which has long been known for stunts guaranteed to test 007’s luck more than his skill. Thanks to them, we now know through scientific on-screen evidence that fictional characters in action scenarios should mostly be dead by now.\nWATCH: Fans of Mythbusters will love the trailer for the White Rabbit Project on Netflix https://t.co/fo5ifxfIJa \n— JOE.ie (@JOEdotie) November 30, 2016 \nJohn Cusack has made a majority of his career risking his life with electronic equipment or risking hypothermia in the rain, for instance.\nSome not-so-famous discoveries include the fact that a stone kicked up by a lawnmower can hit with the force of a bullet, dog bowls should be kept out of the sunlight where flammable objects are nearby, and a car going under water is highly unlikely to be re-opened due to differences in water pressure.\nSome who have seen the White Rabbit Project trailer are already saying they don’t miss the original main cast of Mythbusters . A popular theory is that personal conflicts behind the scenes somehow made their way in front of the camera, and unless you’re watching an action movie, reality TV, or a YouTube video, you probably don’t want to see people fighting.\nImplications have been made that the hosts of the long-running show had been getting on each other’s nerves for a long time, and stepping on each other’s toes. Adam Savage has made it known that they merely work together, but they aren’t friends , in a statement for Business Insider .\n“[Our relationship has] radically changed, but it’s also stayed the same. Jamie and I make no bones about the fact that we’re not friends. We don’t get along very well together on a personal level. In 25 years we’ve known each other, we’ve never had dinner alone together. We do not choose to hang out if we don’t have to be in proximity, and yet, there’s a couple of things that happened, and they’re pretty remarkable.”\nThis is common in any workplace, and you would be surprised to know that some of Hollywood’s most famous on-screen couples couldn’t stand each other. David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson have been among them , despite the alleged sexual tension between their X-Files characters.\nSometimes co-workers simply get along because they have to, and the pay is good, as Jamie Hyneman suggested. Technically it happens with anyone who deals with another person for an extended amount of time.\nLooks fun, but it’s a shame the Gnomestead doesn’t get Netflicks. https://t.co/uNeV4lLuSF \n— Darrell Wade Penner (@Belgnorman) December 3, 2016 \nThe on-screen chemistry between Kari Byron, Grant Imahara, and Tory Belleci in the trailer for their new series appears to be friendly and often playful. The show seems less about debunking myths than simply having fun with them. Kari told International Business Times that the show is simply taking the Mythbusters formula in a new direction .\nNone of the cast from the older series appears to have any regrets, and they’ve shown gratitude for what they all call a good 10 years as they prepare for a new series.\n[Featured Image by Helga Esteb / Shutterstock.com]\n‘Mythbusters’ Cast Returns In 2016/2017 For Netflix’s ‘The White Rabbit Project’ Show: Kari Byron, Grant Imahara, And Tory Belleci Make New Episodes Without Adam Savage And Jamie Hyneman [Trailer Video] is an article from: The Inquisitr News \n",

      "text": "Order Reprint of this Story \nWarning: Spoilers ahead. \nThe Gilmore Girls reboot on Netflix has generated a stir for a few reasons, and one of those was the wedding date for Luke Danes and Lorelai Gilmore: Nov. 5, 2016. \nIn reality, that was just a few days before the presidential election, and several interviews with the show’s creator, Amy Sherman-Palladino, and her husband and co-executive producer Daniel Palladino have focused on why they chose that date in particular. \nThe two confirmed in interviews with Vulture, TVLine and Vogue that they didn’t want to predict the election’s results so they chose a date before then. \n“We considered putting Hillary Clinton in there, but first of all, I didn’t want to jinx it—little did I know that the world was going to jinx it,” Amy Sherman-Palladino told Vogue. “And it’s the kind of thing that dates a show.” \n“We were tempted to put something about — you know, because there was the prospect and the likelihood that there was going to be a woman president-elect at the very, very end. I think that [promotional] poster [originally] indicated that it would be on Nov. 19, I think it was post-election,” Daniel Palladino told Vulture. “We in this industry can’t afford to even predict the future even when it's as certain as Hillary Clinton winning the presidential election.” \nGiven the election went to Donald Trump, that was probably the better call. But in the interview with Vulture, that question also prompted a back and forth between the spouses about whether Stars Hollow, where the Gilmore Girls live, would have voted for Trump . \n“Amy and I are dyed in the wool liberals and very left wing,” Palladino said. “But the show, we always wanted it to be bipartisan and Stars Hollow is a — probably voted for Trump, mainly...” \n“No. No, no, no, no,” Amy Sherman-Palladino interrupted. \n“Oh, I think they did,” Palladino said, pointing out it’s “rural America.” \n“No, no, no, no, no. There is no evilness in Stars Hollow,” Sherman-Palladino said. “Do not put that out there, I do not accept that. Absolutely not.” \nThe two agreed to disagree, and Sherman-Palladino previously told TVLine she has had a hard time not interpreting the election results as “the world is ending.” \nSo which one was right? Normally, the only way to tell the results in a fictional world would be to ask the show’s creators. But in this case, Stars Hollow is based on a real town called Washington, Connecticut. \nThat town voted for Hillary Clinton over Trump , 1,242 to 738. However, the county it’s in, Litchfield, went to Trump, and the state itself went to Clinton. \nThe show has commented on both presidential candidates in the past, before they were nominees for major parties. Sookie St. James, the cook and Lorelai Gilmore’s best friend, refers to Trump as “that bastard” in one episode. \nOn the other hand, Lorelai Gilmore tells Luke Danes, “see you when Hillary’s president,” when she is expressing doubts about when she’ll ever get to see him again.

I'm not a homophobe but Michael/Nomi and Lito are awful. Boom TittyMilk User Formerly known as Big R Donor TMB OG Just finished the season and thought it was hell of a show. I'll be interested to see where they go with season 2 Arkie Proud The Dungeon Master Staff Member Fucking show was awesome. Me and the wife finished it last night. During the opening credits of episode 1, I made mention to my wife there seemed to be a lot of LGBT symbolism. I later took it to be that the opening focused on the six major locations, with San Francisco being one. But yeah, they do not skimp on the gay stuff. I kinda liked Lito, he brought some humor at times, but Nori was kind of unlikable. Overall, it is a great cast. Story is weird at first and it can be difficult to get a handle, but when it starts kicking into gear, it is pretty fucking bad ass IYAM. Would recommend. dfmPSU don't drive angry Donor TMB OG Just finished as well. Thought it was amazing, and it really hit for me, though I can absolutely understand why it wouldn't be for everyone. Now I'm pissed I have to wait however long for more. i kept thinking Sigur Ros would play really well with some scenes...loved that the finale went out with one of their songs. Oracle of Omahawg Swine Flu Carrier Donor I am 8 eps in and I am glad to see I am not the only one irritated by the force-feeding of the LGBT stuff. I was beginning to feel like I was Clint Eastwood in Grand Torino. I like it, my favorite characters so far are Sun and Riley. CUtigers Well-Known Member Donor 2nd half of the season was really great, and really transformed the show for me from just watching to see what happens to actually being really interested in the story and characters. Interested to see where they go with season 2. Character rankings for me probably go 1/2: Wolfgang/Capheus",

      "text": "Tweet \nIt’s Christmas time and with that means that most people will flock to Netflix to find their favorite holiday movies on the service. In the case of many (including myself), the go-to movie is 2003’s Will Ferrell cult hit, Elf. What we’ll do is take a look as to where and if Elf is streaming on Netflix and also some reasons as to why it’s one of the best Christmas movies out there. \nWill Ferrell plays the role of Buddy the Elf who is a little different from all of the other elves in the North Pole. Once he starts questioning why he’s different, Santa sends him on a trip to New York City in search of his real father. The hilarity comes from the fact that Buddy isn’t very well adjusted for the big apple and chaos ensues. \nAlongside Ferrell is James Caan, Amy Sedaris, Mary Steenburgen, Peter Dinklage, Artie Lange and Daniel Tay. Is Elf on Netflix? \nWell if you’re from a Western country the answer is more than likely no. For those in the United States, United Kingdom or Canada the movie isn’t available on your service. Why? Well because of the popularity of the show, it makes it extremely expensive to license particularly at this time of the year. That means that those with the big bucks spend the most and unfortunately Netflix doesn’t have a look in. \nIt’s not all bad news though as many countries do in fact stream Elf. Most of Africa, Central America, Nordic regions and Asia can stream the movie on their Netflix. For those in the USA, you do have the option of renting it on the Netflix DVD platform but beware, it’ll be a popular choice this time of year. \nFor most, though, you aren’t able to stream Elf and that’s unlikely to change given our knowledge of how licenses work.

      "text": "+ More Options Powered by \nAs Donald Trump settles into president-elect status, Saturday Night Live has decided on a multi-pronged oppositional approach to his presidency, generally taking on Trump’s policies and political action in Weekend Update, and leaving Alec Baldwin to mock the personality traits they find wanting in the cold open. \nTarget #1: Trump’s affinity for tweeting. \nThe cold open finds Baldwin’s Trump and Kate McKinnon’s Kellyanne Conway receiving a security briefing but ignoring the briefers, with Trump focusing instead on retweeting random people including a 16-year-old, which Baldwin, McKinnon, and Kenan Thompson’s intelligence officer practically break character to let us know is something that actually happened. \nIn the meeting, Trump ignores his briefers as Conway explains, “He [tweets so much] to distract the media from his business conflicts and all the very scary people in his cabinet.” Trump disagrees, saying simply, “I do it because my brain is bad.” As the meeting progresses, Trump is unable to shift his focus from Twitter to the briefing. \nThe sketch then uses Trump to articulate President’s Obama’s successes in office, including how unemployment is currently at a nine-year low, and how millions of people having health care, implying that Trump will take credit for the successes Obama is leaving him with. \nBy sketch’s end, Trump blows an airhorn for every retweet as he ignores news of potential chaos in Pakistan. The sketch also takes a shot at presidential advisor Steve Bannon, who they chose to portray as the actual character of Death, complete with black cloak and skeleton mask. \nAs with the show’s last episode, the real Donald Trump objected to the portrayal on Twitter, proclaiming it “biased” and “unwatchable.” SNL has regularly mocked every president, Democratic and Republican, since Gerald Ford. Trump is the first to object, and, from the looks of it, will likely continue doing so throughout his presidency. Just tried watching Saturday Night Live – unwatchable! Totally biased, not funny and the Baldwin impersonation just can't get any worse. Sad \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 4, 2016 \nBaldwin then escalated the matter: \nRelease your tax returns and I'll stop.Ha \n— ABFoundation (@ABFalecbaldwin) December 4, 2016 \nYour move, PEOTUS! \nOne note on McKinnon’s Conway. I find the portrayal increasingly frustrating, false, and even a bit sexist. McKinnon plays Conway as the reluctant fixer, a woman trying to clean up a man’s mess, finding his bad behavior uncouth and trying to keep him in line like a harried wife on a Kevin James sitcom. There is simply no real life basis to this. Throughout his campaign and through the present, Conway has been, and continues to be, a loyal and enthusiastic supporter of everything Trump does, as important to his team and as supportive of his mindset as anyone. McKinnon needs to stop playing her like a put-upon school marm, and figure out how to portray her as she really is. \nBeyond politics, the episode brought back Emma Stone for the second time hosting. The monologue took the backstage tour route, with Stone reminiscing about her last time hosting, five years ago, and taking an 80s teen film approach, with Vanessa Bayer playing the leader of the mean girls, Aidy Bryant the high school friend she left behind to chase Hollywood (they did actually go to the same high school, it turns out), and Bobby Moynihan the castmate she had a fling with. A cute opening, nothing great, but at least it wasn’t a musical. (Separate but related: Moynihan has been pushed further into the background this year, as newcomers Mikey Day and Alex Moffat have, deservedly, received far more airtime than newcomers normally do. Both have performed admirably, but, can we have more Bobby please? His reduced airtime has been noticeable. He’s been missed.) \nFor the first post-monologue sketch, the show inexplicably brought back the high school drama club, as the pretentious, clueless teens take on the perceived threats of a Trump administration. Taking on everything from fears of a new Holocaust to shallow aspects of American culture in the most blunt, shallow, and uninformed ways possible, the students are donating the proceeds to Standing Rock, to “get those Native Americans the pipeline they want.” For conservatives who complain that SNL never takes shots at liberals – here’s your sketch, a shot across the bow at over-enthusiastic liberals who protest with their hearts without using their heads. I’d grown tired of this sketch in the past, but this had some funny moments, including Bryant turning a pledge of support for people with AIDS into, “I love my AIDS!” Thompson and Bayer play exasperated parents who have to sit through this abomination, trying to sort through the confused messages coming at them from the stage. \nNext comes a musical number from the women in the cast — plus Stone — about regifting candles. Dressed in big hair and fur coats like an old timey Christmas special, the performances are sincere, and this seems like it might be a parody of something specific (but if so, I have no idea of what). I have nothing else to say about this sketch, as I have no feelings about regifting one way or another, and this sketch did nothing to make me care. YMMV. \nThe next sketch is a bizarre piece of work featuring Pete Davidson as an algebra student whose posters come alive in a dream to help him learn math. While what seemed like a possible teleprompter glitch, but might have just been Davidson breaking, led to a funny moment between him and Thompson’s stand-up comic, this sketch belonged to Stone as the hot-girl pin-up holding a hot dog, which she then tries to use to help Davidson understand math. Putting on an impossibly high, nasal voice, Stone is all-in for this, mocking sexual stereotypes while doing her best to make eating “gross, stinky” hot dogs sound aggressively, enthusiastically sexy. \nRecent sightings of Hillary Clinton in the woods around her home inspired “The Hunt for Hill,” a reality TV parody in the tradition of shows determined to find Bigfoot or the Loch Ness Monster. The sketch also seemed, at first, like an excuse to employ McKinnon’s now iconic Clinton impression, one that many expected would be a regular presence on the show for the next four years. The sketch features regular people describing Hillary in impersonal terms, a la Bigfoot, followed by trackers seeking out her shoe prints and trying to call her in the woods with an exaggerated laugh. They also use an article about the current Wisconsin recount as bait, but to no avail. Surprisingly, after dressing McKinnon as Clinton, they give her nothing to do but run through the woods in long shots – the sketch ends somewhat abruptly, the trackers’ mission unfulfilled. The premise here was clever, but the sketch seemed cut short. \nWeekend Update was its usual hit-or-miss, with Colin Jost and Michael Che, in what we might as well consider the segment’s permanent format now, spending the entire first segment on Trump. Che’s initial joke, about Trump’s call to Taiwan this week, made the incorrect point that, “Trump probably doesn’t know the difference between Taiwan and China.” Note to Che – he knows it well. There were many aspects of Trump’s breaking with almost 40 years of U.S. protocol that could have been addressed here. Che side-stepped all of them. \nJost then noted that Trump was doing victory rallies in all the places that helped him get elected, like “Ohio, Pennsylvania, Russia, the FBI, Wikileaks, and Hillary’s campaign headquarters.” (That last one got a groan from the crowd. Suck it up, people. There’s truth to it.) He then said that Trump’s “thank you” tour was “the Trumpiest idea I ever heard,” given that “he’s so egotistical that his idea of saying thank you is to have thousands of people show up and chant his name,” then made the case that it would be like if someone started a charity, then had the money go to a portrait of the guy who started the charity – something Trump actually did. \nJost also echoed the cold open by wondering if Trump’s more controversial tweets — this week, about flag burning and voter fraud — were an intentional distraction meant to pull the media’s attention from more important issues. He made the suggestion that if the media insisted on reporting on Trump’s tweets, they should do so in “the most boring way possible,” like a weather report. \nThe pair then took on the Standing Rock controversy, with Jost, noting America’s history of screwing over the natives, comparing the protesting Native Americans to Milton from Office Space , and the area they’re trying to protect to his stapler. “‘Cause remember,” he says, “at the end of Office Space , Milton burns the entire place down. And oil – famously flammable.” \nThe week’s first desk piece came from Leslie Jones, commenting on a report that women in long-term relationships report greater sexual dissatisfaction. Jones’ rant about sexual frustration included some men’s tendency to brag inaccurately about their natural gifts. “Do not promise me a rack of ribs,” she says, “then show up with a little penis.” Jones’ message to men — be confident, and be proud of whatever you have down there. “Even a thumb drive can hold a lot of data.” She ends with a quote from Maya Angelou (not really tho): “No matter the size / in-between your thighs / you can still rise.” \nWe also got Bayer’s spot-on Rachel-from- Friends impression, commenting on the current ’90s nostalgia wave before being interrupted by the real-life Jennifer Aniston, there to call Bayer out on her Friends ‘ obsession (while performing the impression with her). It was a cute, brief cameo, really stealth promotion for the upcoming film Office Christmas Party , which the pair appear in together along with McKinnon. \nJones, Stone and Cecily Strong then play an office cleaning crew who want to perform a Christmas song for the people they clean for, and it turns out the songs involve having sex with Santa. By the end, it’s a full-on orgy with elves. Quick and funny. \nNext up we have a sketch about a panel on gender equality in film. Sasheer Zamata plays moderator, with panelists Jones, Stone, and Aniston (and more film promo) as themselves, and, from minute one, McKinnon as the obvious joke of the sketch, Debette Goldry, her elderly actress character who fondly remembers the horrible sexism of the old-time film industry, including “having to eat arsenic to make your skin pale.” She rationalizes men being paid more than women by noting that men do all the work; women just had to lay on train tracks looking frightened. She then describes being handled as a prop on film sets, and blowing FDR at his request. \n“Wells for Boys” was a commercial parody offering wells for introspection for boys who can’t find their place in childhood (read: boys who are gay) and their difficulty in adapting. I didn’t fully get the symbolism of the well, but the sketch made its point clearly and with laughs, noting that outsiders do things that are often considered weird because the regular world is not cut out for them. \nThe episode ended with a nativity parody featuring Stone as Mary, just after giving birth, telling Joseph to send the three wise men away because she’s exhausted after giving birth. Gold, Frankincense, and Myrrh? Why not blankets, diapers, and a crib? \nNext week’s host is wrestler and actor John Cena, with musical guest Maren Morris. \nLarry Getlen is the author of the book Conversations with Carlin .

      "text": "Tweet \nLeah Remini is revealing all in her brand new documentary series based on the Church of Scientology. It joins a growing number of networks that have put the church in their sights and with Netflix yet to join the game with their own look at Scientology so we’re going to look as to whether A&E’s latest series will be coming to Netflix. \nThe A&E series gives us Leah Remini’s perspective on the church and given she was basically raised as a child within the church she has a pretty good idea of how it operates. The series is spread out across eight episodes and as you can expect, has been strongly condemned by the church, go figure. Leah in many people’s eyes was considered a poster girl for the church. \nWe think that Netflix will eventually stream this series given Netflix previous ties to A&E picking up some of their most successful shows. However, given the documentary series better than predicted ratings, it may be the case that another streaming service swoops in. If it does come to Netflix, we suspect it’d come around November 2017 at the latest. \nIn the meantime, A&E are hosting the episodes online through their website although it’s not known for how long so be quick. What about the other Scientology movies? \nWhile we’re on the topic of Scientology In recent years, there have been two big Scientology movies. One is by HBO called Scientology: Going Clear where it documents the churches practices including a detailed piece of the church’s founder. Because of the way HBO and Netflix conduct its businesses, we wouldn’t expect that ever to be available on Netflix although it is available via Netflix DVD. \nThe more recent one is done by famous BBC documentarian Louis Theroux which cast actors to play the roles of well-known Scientology figures. This is considered to be too new at the moment to join streaming just yet but like the A&E series, because of ties between the BBC and Netflix, we suspect that it will eventually come although giving a timeframe is extremely difficult.

      "text": "Netflix Releases Documentary On Disney’s First Black Animator Movies & TV   5:03   YouTube \nThe story of Disney’s first black animator is now streaming on Netflix. Floyd Norman: An Animated Life details the career of Floyd Norman, a now 81-year-old writer animator and comic book artist, whose work with Disney dates back to the 1950s when he was hired for Sleeping Beauty . \n“Floyd made it possible for him to say if he can do it , I can do it,” a fellow black animator notes in the film. \nIn the late 1950s, Norman worked as an inbetweener (which is essentially creating intermediate drawings for an animated story) with Disney before being drafted to the Armed Forces. Following his service, Norman returned to Disney to work on 101 Dalmatians in 1960, and The Sword Stone in 1963. \nAfter seeing some of the drawings that he did to entertain co-workers, Walt Disney moved the then budding animator to the story department to rewrite The Jungle Book . Following Walt Disney’s death in 1966, Norman along with friend and business partner, Leo Sullivan, launched Vignette Films, a production company which released various film projects focussing on black history. The duo would go on to produce segments for Sesame Street , and Bill Cosby’s Hey, Hey, Hey Fat Albert television special which aired on NBC in 1969. \nNorman returned to Disney in the 1970s where he worked on projects like Robin Hood , and the defunct Mickey Mouse comic strip. At age 65, Disney fired Norman in what his family described as the “prime” of his career. \nNonetheless, his resume includes work with Walt Disney Studios, and Pixar on animated classics such as Toy Story 2 , Monsters In c., Mulan , and The Hunchback of Notre-Dame . \nAn Animated Life debuted in limited released earlier in the year.

      "text": "\nIs the new White Rabbit Project premiering on Netflix in a few days the return of the beloved MythBusters , or is it something else? As reported by Entertainment Weekly , with the same company producing the show and return of three of the previous series stars , there’s reason to be hopeful.\nThe Original MythBusters The original MythBusters – which was the seed for the current White Rabbit Project – was an interesting mix of urban legends, movie myths, scientific methodology, construction and humor. Although insidiously educational, the show was successful enough to run from 2003 to March 2016.\nSpectacular stunts, sometimes nauseating experiments and massive explosions became the hallmarks of MythBusters . Even President Obama got in on the act, guest starring in a special episode about ancient Greek weaponry setting ships on fire.\nWhen the decision was made a couple of seasons ago to dump the build team – comprised of Grant Imahara, Tory Belleci and Kari Byron – from MythBusters , there was an outcry from fans around the world. And although MythBusters continued on without them for a couple of seasons, most viewers thought it wasn’t quite the same.\nBut with MythBusters now canceled and Adam Savage and Jamie Heinemann off doing other things, it left the producers of the original show – Beyond Productions – free to reintroduce and reinvented with the still popular build team. While not precisely the same as MythBusters , the truth is it’s not that far removed from the original show either.\nGrant Imahara, Tory Belleci And Kari Byron ‘White Rabbit Project’ promotion. [Image by Beyond Productions] MythBusters Redux? In the White Rabbit Project , Byron, Belleci and Imahara will tackle a range of topics more or less in the MythBusters style although perhaps with slightly less focus on science per se and a little more focus on fun. Supposedly, the show will also be unscripted, which is a major departure from the original MythBusters series. According to the official synopsis for the White Rabbit Project :\nUnder their microscope are topics as diverse as jailbreaks, superpower technology, heists, and crazy World War II weapons… In each episode the hosts immerse themselves in experiments, builds and tests as they sleuth the truth behind these and other well googled themes.\nSo it sounds like if you enjoyed MythBusters , you’ll probably like the White Rabbit Project as well. And for fans specifically of the build team, this is a golden opportunity to see them throughout the entire episode, instead of just in snippets here and there. And almost inevitably – as happened on MythBusters on numerous occasions – Tory Belleci will find a way to injure himself unnecessarily.\nAnd it also seems clear that one of the best aspects of MythBusters – the re-creation of crazy or unusual scenarios – is going to be a part of this new show as well. The unscripted interaction between the cohosts during these experiments and investigations probably won’t seem too far removed from the scenes they had together on MythBusters .\nAlthough the original MythBusters traveled a bit, occasionally going as far as Florida or even South Africa, for the most part it stay grounded in California. But if this White Rabbit Project Netflix series is going to be all that it claims in the synopsis, it may be that the intrepid trio are going to do much more traveling than they did previously. After all, mysteries and surprises aren’t just confined to the continental United States.\nIt’s always comforting to see familiar faces, and that’s one of the things the White Rabbit Project will provide. With Byron, Belleci and Imahara back in the saddle, fans of MythBusters won’t have to continue pining for the show they devotedly watched for more than a decade. The band’s getting back together.\n[Featured Image by Beyond Productions]\n‘White Rabbit Project’ Starring Grant Imahara, Tory Belleci And Kari Byron: Is This The Return Of ‘Mythbusters’ In Everything But Name? is an article from: The Inquisitr News \n",

      "text": "READ ‘Luke Cage’ Star Says Signature Hoodie Is An Ode To Trayvon Martin \nIt’s great news for fans of both Mike Colter who plays Cage and the show, but no surprise as viewers have been salivating for the show long before it streamed on Netflix. Show creator Cheo Hodari Coker also took to Twitter to celebrate the good news. Sweet Christmas arrived 21 days early! Season Two coming soon! Forward….Always. \n— Cheo Hodari Coker (@cheo_coker) December 4, 2016 \nAs Variety reports, this make Luke Cage the third Marvel series to receive a (well-deserved) second chance. DareDevil, a show about a blind attorney by day (who is also fluent in Spanish) and a superhero with heightened senses at night also kicking ass in New York’s Hell’s Kitchen premiered its Second Season in 2016. And everyone’s favorite iron woman, who may also be a little emotionally stunted, Jessica Jones will return as well. READ Mahershala Ali Discusses The Thin Line Between Right And Wrong In Netflix’s ‘Luke Cage’ \nSeason One of Luke Cage gave fans a lot of history. We learned how Cage became the insanely strong man he is, watched him defeat several enemies (and due so in a tailor made suit from Dapper Dan simply for the culture) as well as develop a burgeoning romance for Rosario Dawson’s character Claire. But the last we saw Mr. Cage was on his was back to jail while an overzealous doctor may have given his worst enemy his biggest advantage. \nWho knows what Coker and Colter have in store for second season, but trust we’re so here for it.",

      "text": "Tweet \nOne of the best Christmas movies of all time is How the Grinch Stole Christmas starring Jim Carrey and every year at Christmas; millions flock to their streaming service to watch the movie. This year, How the Grinch Stole Christmas is available on more Netflix regions than ever before but is it available on yours? Let’s find out. \nFor those who’ve never been initiated with How The Grinch Stole Christmas, let’s give you a bit of a back story. Based on the famous character in the famous Dr Suess story and was in fact, the first Dr Suess story to be adapted to the big screen back in 2000. \nThe story popularised the Grinch which is now given to people who are not particularly festive or giving at this time of year. The movie sets us up in Whoville who are about to potentially get their Christmas spoiled by the Grinch who doesn’t like the holiday season. \nWe’ve got good news too as a reboot of the movie is planned to release in 2018 with Benedict Cumberbatch as the Grinch. \nWith Netflix’s massive expansion in 2016, it’s brought the Grinch to more Netflix regions than ever but it’s likely that if you’re on this page, it’s not streaming on your Netflix service. \nLet’s start off with whether or not The Grinch is available in English-speaking countries to which the answer is mostly no with the exception of Netflix in Canada. For those in the United States and the United Kingdom, you don’t have the privilege of watching How the Ginch Stole Christmas on Netflix as the license is much more in demand and is therefore bought out by premium cable companies including HBO, Starz and Sky. \nAs for the rest of the world, The Grinch is currently streaming on Netflix in the majority of the Middle East, Africa, South America, Asia and a select few European countries.

      "title": "How to download Netflix movies and TV shows to your phone or tablet",
      "text": "Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends \nFor years, Netflix subscribers have dreamed of the ability to download movies or episodes of their favorite TV shows to accompany them on a long trip off the grid. Now that the dream has we’re here to help you make that transition offline go as smoothly as possible so you can simply sit back and enjoy. \nFor now, downloading titles for offline playback is only available via the Netflix app on iOS and Android mobile devices. Follow us below to figure out how to get downloading so you can get off the grid, and take your Netflix along for the ride. Getting your download on Step 1: Get up to date \nFirst things first, you’ll need to make sure your Netflix app has been updated to be ready for downloading. If you don’t have your device set to auto update, for iOS devices you can simply click on the app in the app store to get version 9.0.1 or later, while on Android devices you can do the same at the Google Play, where the version varies by device. Step 2: Choose your download quality \nNetflix offers two different quality levels for downloads: Standard and “Higher,” the latter of which is seemingly high definition (720-1080p resolution), though Netflix doesn’t specify there. Standard uses less space on your device and downloads faster, while Higher takes a bit more space. Which one you’ll want to use will depend on how much free space you’ll have on your device, and what kind of device you’re using — a Standard title may look fine on a phone, while Higher may be necessary for your tablet. To choose, tap the menu icon on the left, then scroll down to App Settings. From here, under the Downloads heading, tap Video Quality and select your preference. We’ll get to more details on how much space Netflix downloads use later in this article. Step 3: Pick your poison \nNot everything on Netflix is available for download, but the company has made downloadable titles easy to find by arranging them in a special section called simply “Available for Download.” To get there, tap the menu button in the upper left and it’s the first option below the Home section. If you’re searching for specific titles simply look for the download icon, which looks like an arrow pointing down to a line. Step 4: Get downloading \nTo begin downloading, simply tap on the download icon on the show or movie you want to watch. There is one thing Android users will need to be aware of here: Netflix can only download titles to the same storage space in which the Netflix app is stored, so if you want to download to an SD card, you’ll need to make sure to download the Netflix app there as well. Step 5: Watch your downloaded titles \nOnce titles are downloaded, they can be found in the “My Downloads” section of the app, can be found by tapping the menu button in the upper left hand corner of the app. The My Downloads folder is located just above the Home section. A title’s running time as well as how much space it uses is listed next to the title. To play a downloaded episode, simply tap on the video thumbnail. How much space do I need? \nJust how much space a download takes up depends on how long the title is and, of course, which video quality option you’ve chosen. As an example, we downloaded the Netflix original film Mascots , as well as the first episode of Stranger Things in both Standard and Higher quality. \nMore: Time to kill? These are the 101 best movies on Netflix \nMascots has a runtime of 1 hour and 35 minutes. The Standard quality download of the movie used 487MB of space, while the Higher quality version took up 749.4MB. Stranger Things episode one is 48 minutes long and takes up 197.1MB of space in Standard quality, and 310.1MB in Higher. As mentioned above, Standard should be fine for most phones, but if you’re picky — or going to a tablet — you’ll want to use the Higher resolution. What’s available? \nAs mentioned above, not all of Netflix’s library of streaming titles is available for download. One thing you can count on being available are Netflix Originals, as every Original we looked at was available for download right away, including episodes of Orange is the New Black, House of Cards, Narcos, and The Crown. \nThe Crown \nOther titles available at the time of writing were TV shows like Breaking Bad, Blacklist, and Weeds . Movies available for download included No Country for Old Men, London Has Fallen, Pulp Fiction , and Jaws. \nMore: The absolute best TV shows streaming on Netflix right now \nAs with Netflix streaming, many of these titles will only be available for a limited time, and once they’re gone from the service, you won’t be able to watch the downloaded version either. There is also no way to move the files off of a mobile device and play them with another app, so if you were planning to file a hard drive with Netflix titles, you’ll be sorely disappointed. How do I delete titles? \nWhether you’ve watched downloaded titles or simply want to make room for more downloads, you’ll eventually want to get rid of them. There are two ways to go about this, depending on how much you want to delete. \nDeleting a single title \nIf you only want to delete one title at a time, this can be done from the My Downloads section. Just tap Edit in the upper right, then tap the red X icon next to any titles you want to delete. Titles will be deleted without a second confirmation, so be careful what you tap. \nDeleting all downloaded titles \nYou could delete everything from the My Downloads section, but if you’re looking to clear everything all at once, there’s an easier way. Tap the menu icon in the upper left, then scroll down to App Settings. From here, just tap Clear All Downloads, confirm that you do want to delete all your downloaded titles, and you’re done.

If you were unhappy in your day-to-day, would you off yourself to see if you’d fare better on this other plane of existence? \nThat’s the premise for one of Netflix’s upcoming 2017 productions, “The Discovery.” \n“The Discovery” is set in a world where the afterlife has been scientifically proven, and as a result millions of people start taking their own lives to “get there.” \nDirected by Charlie McDowell, The Discovery stars Jason Segel, Rooney Mara, Robert Redford, Jesse Plemons, Riley Keough and Ron Canada. The film was produced by Alex Orlovsky of A-LO Films and James D. Stern of Endgame Entertainment, and was co-financed by Endgame Entertainment and Protagonist Pictures. Charlie McDowell and Justin Lader are the screenwriters. \nExecutive Producers are Julie Goldstein, Lucas Smith, Mike Goodridge, Dimitra Tsingou, Hunter Gray, Charlie McDowell and co-producer Erika Hampson. \nLook for it Spring of 2017.

Netflix's aggressive hiring tactics are rubbing Hollywood the wrong way. (Justin Sullivan / Getty Images) David Ng executives has set off a complex legal battle that has captured the industry's fascination, offering a rare glimpse into the inner workings of two entertainment giants at a time when streaming continues to disrupt the industry.\nAs Netflix gains ground against traditional TV and cable, beefing up its original content production and increasing its customer base, the company’s hunger for experienced executives is also expanding. But Netflix's aggressive hiring tactics are rubbing Hollywood the wrong way. The case has the potential to upend longstanding hiring practices in an industry where contracts have historically played an important role as a way to retain top artistic and executive talent. \nAlthough employment disputes are common in Hollywood, rarely do they escalate to such a public level, underscoring the high degree of tension between major studios and Netflix. \n\"It's a systematic, targeted campaign,” said Daniel Petrocelli, the attorney representing Fox in the suit, which was filed in September in Los Angeles Superior Court. “Any company would take action to protect its interests.\" \nHe said Netflix has poached a number of employees at Fox in recent months and that the studio didn't make a fuss. But the two executives at the heart of the dispute were under fixed-term employment contracts, which Fox argues are ironclad. Though Netflix tends to offer smaller base salaries than studios, it attracts prospective employees with stock options. \n\"The issue is contractual,\" Petrocelli said. Fox contends Netflix induced the two executives to break their contracts — tortious interference , in legal parlance — and is seeking damages and an injunction against Netflix to halt the poaching. \nNetflix, which declined to comment, filed a cross-complaint in October asserting that Fox's employment contracts aren't enforceable because they impede employee mobility and stifle the competition for skilled employees, thereby violating the California Business and Professions Code. \nThe streaming company is asking for a court to prevent Fox from enforcing the contracts. Fox contends that if granted, the request would not only allow Netflix to resume its head-hunting campaign, but also set an influential precedent that could affect industries beyond film and television. \nThe dispute shows no signs of ending any time soon. \nThe clash is another signal of the degree to which Netflix is provoking hand-wringing throughout corporate Hollywood. The Los Gatos, Calif.-based company is expected to reach 91.9 million subscribers worldwide during the current quarter, up more than 20% from the same period last year. \nConsumers continue to cut the cord, ditching pay-TV in favor of cheaper streaming services. So far this year, the pay-TV industry has lost 1.3 million subscribers, according to a recent report from SNL Kagan, a consulting firm. That represents a year-to-date record loss for the industry.The trend hurts companies like Fox’s parent company, 21st Century Fox, which derives significant revenue from channels including FX and Fox News. At the same time, studios such as Fox license content to Netflix. \nExperts say that Fox faces an uphill battle to prove its case. \n“California has been strongly in favor of labor competition and mobility,” said David Lewin, professor emeritus at the UCLA Anderson School of Management, where he taught human resource management. “Fox is trying to argue that employment isn't quite at-will. It's the concept of mobility and a free labor market that this kind of case goes against.” \nFixed-term employment contracts are common throughout the entertainment industry, since they provide a degree of stability for both the company and employee, said Kate Gold, a partner at Drinker Biddle & Reath, where she specializes in employment law. \nBut for Fox to succeed, it will have to produce concrete evidence. “Who initiated contact?” Gold said. “Is there an email? Sometimes the proof isn’t there.” In corporate Hollywood, hires are often made “with a wink and a nod,” she added. \nThe dispute began in February when Fox sued Marcos Waltenberg, a former marketing executive who left for Netflix before the expiration of his employment contract. Fox asked the court to rule that the contract was binding, but Waltenberg’s attorneys fought that request. \nA settlement was reached in July that didn’t involve monetary payment, according to Fox. A lawyer for Waltenberg said she was unable to comment. \nTwo months later, Fox was back in court after a second employee — Tara Flynn, a creative executive working in the company’s TV division — jumped ship to Netflix before her contract was up. This time when Fox sued, it argued that Netflex was “engaged in a brazen campaign to unlawfully target, recruit, and poach valuable Fox executives by illegally inducing them to break their employment contracts.” \nIn some cases, studios will grant their employees early releases from their contracts, but typically only if a consensual agreement is reached, Petrocelli said. \nNo such negotiations took place with Netflix, he said, adding that the company ignored Fox’s cease-and-desist letter before the suit was filed. \nThe lawsuit comes at a sensitive time for many studios, which have been downsizing. Fox offered buyouts this year that cut an estimated 300 to 400 jobs. Far more applicants than expected took the buyouts, including some high level executives, according to people with knowledge of the situation not authorized to comment. \nIn its suit against Netflix, Fox may look to two prominent California cases involving employee poaching, though both were eventually settled. \nLast year, four prominent technology companies — Adobe, Apple, Google and Intel — agreed to pay $415 million to settle a case in which they were accused of conspiring not to hire each others’ employees. The plaintiffs, who were former employees, alleged that the agreement impeded their career mobility. \nIn 2007, CRST Van Expedited Inc., a trucking company, reached a settlement in a case in which it accused a competitor, Werner Enterprises Inc., of hiring away drivers who were under contract. Prior to the settlement, an appeals court overturned a lower court’s order to dismiss the case, saying CRST adequately alleged violations of intentional interference with a contract. \nFox is arguing that Netflix overstepped its legal bounds by deciding on its own that the studio’s employment contracts were unenforceable. \n“It is not within their rights to make that judgment on their own,” said Petrocelli, adding that this represented a direct assault on California’s labor code. “If someone wants to change that law, go for it. But it has to be done in the legislature.” Caption Kenneth Turan reviews the 'smart and unexpected' biopic 'Jackie' \nKenneth Turan reviews the Jacqueline Kennedy biopic \"Jackie,\" directed by Pablo Larraín and starring Natalie Portman, who shows us aspects of the the first lady we might not have known before.

      "text": "› How to download and watch Netflix shows and movies for offline viewing on your iPhone or Android How to download and watch Netflix shows and movies for offline viewing on your iPhone or Android Posted: Tags : iOS - iOS + Android - Android + How-to - How-to + A few years ago, a lot of folks raised an eyebrow when Netflix set out to be the new HBO, with original TV show programming and in-house documentaries in the pipeline. Fast forward to today, and the debt-fueled expansion of Netflix has returned several hit series, and there are 20 shows of unscripted programming that are set to make a cameo in 2017. That's a lot of content for what was supposed to be simply a one-stop-shop for others' movies and TV series, and Netflix has started what seems like an arm's race for hit content between the TV networks, HBO and Amazon. As a result, we spare more and more time to watch one brilliant TV show after another, and have less and less time to do anything else. Last week, Netflix introduced offline downloads for some of its content on mobile devices, so that you can grab it while on your Wi-fi network at home, and watch at your convenience on the go, which would certainly bode well for your monthly data cap and your time management. Here's what you need to do if you want to download a few episodes of your favorite show to have with you while waiting for your dentist's appointment: 1. Download the Android or iOS version of the Netflix app on your mobile device;2. Log in with your Netflix account, and tap on the hamburger menu icon, then select the Available for Download option; 3. Pick from the list, or simply search for your content to see if it is available for offline viewing; 4. The programming that can be downloaded is denoted with the icon in the description header if it's a movie, or next to each episode if it is a TV show; 5. After the process is complete in the background, you can access your offline content from the My Downloads section of the app; 6. Should you wish to change the video quality (and, respectively, its size and time to download), you can do so by going to the Menu icon again, tap App settings > Downloads > Video quality , and choose either the Standard or Higher (720p+) options. To store the downloads on the microSD card, it has to be set as your primary shared storage place in your phone's settings, otherwise Netflix will download the movies or episodes to your internal memory.

      "text": "41 Orange Is the New Black (Netflix) \nBetween Piper’s branding with a swastika, Lolly’s sectioning and Poussey’s tragic end, this series was horrific – and way more critical of the US penal system than ever before. With overcrowding at Litchfield prison, the rage between inmates and guards simmered throughout – until that heart-stopping final scene. Read a full review \n42 BrainDead (Amazon Prime) \nIt’s 2016. Political discourse has become violently polarised. Why are we all so angry and partisan? According to BrainDead, it’s because space bugs have come to Earth, crawled into our ears and eaten our brains. This was the timeliest, most inventive and sharpest satire of the year. Read a full review \n43 Crazy Ex-Girlfriend (Netflix) \nA wacky musical romcom about obsessive self-deceit, Crazy Ex-Girlfriend’s skill is its ability to package complex ideas in primary-coloured wrapping. It’s a silly and funny show, and you’ll recognise someone you know in every single character. Read a full review \n44 Fresh Meat (Channel 4) \nJP, Vod and co finally graduated this year, though not before one last series of Jesse Armstrong and Sam Bain ’s smart, funny comedy drama. Throughout its run, Fresh Meat has been that rarest thing: a TV re-creation of uni that refuses to resort to student cliches. Read more \n45 2016: Year Friends (Vimeo) \nAfter the BBC neglected to pick up their sketch-show pilot People Time for a series, young British comics Liam Williams, Ellie White, Natasia Demetriou, Jamie Demetriou, Al Roberts and Daran Johnson created their own web sitcom . The result was absurdly creative and gratifyingly weird: in a world of staid banter, it proved that comedy could still be taken to bizarre new extremes. Read more \n46 Ash vs Evil Dead (Virgin Media) \nA dollop of silliness to counteract the po-facedness of most modern drama. Picking up where the Evil Dead films left off, a middle-aged, chainsaw-handed Bruce Campbell leads a foul-mouthed crusade against the forces of darkness. Read more \n47 Lovesick (Netflix) \nRemember Scrotal Recall? Tom Edge’s timeline-jumping, gonorrhea-themed love-com on Channel 4 has been renamed and reborn on Netflix, resuming its run as the best will-they-won’t-they show since the US Office. Read more \n48 Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt (Netflix) \nThe second series of Tina Fey and Robert Carlock’s cult-survivor fun show. This time it centred around the festive antics of Kimmy, her roommate Titus and their daffy landlady Lillian. Kimmy got a new job as an elf, Lillian went on a one-woman mission to bring down gentrification – and Titus put on a show called Kimono You Didn’t, inspired by his past life as a geisha. Read a full review \n49 Halt and Catch Fire (Amazon Prime) \nAMC’s 1980s tech drama is still the most sorely underrated US show on TV . The spectacular third outing saw our crew of computer programmer pioneers move to the nascent Silicon Valley, and it was full of secrets, shotgun weddings and Super Mario Bros. Plus, its creators are masters of the cliffhanger ending. Catch up before the fourth and final series starts next summer. Read more \n50 The Walking Dead (Fox) \nThe post-apocalypse horror show marches on – and Rick Grimes and the gang may finally have met their match in Negan and the sadistic Saviors. How will they stop themselves dying, one by one, at the hands of Lucille the barbed-wire baseball bat? Read more",

Today, we’re looking as to whether or not you can stream the Home Alone movies on Netflix. \nThe series which catapulted the career of Macauley Culkin who played the role of Kevin, a young squirt who was left at home while the rest of the family was going on vacation. Robbers have their eyes on the house that they live in and it’s up to Kevin to defend it from it being burgled. \nThe cultural significance of Home Alone was even bigger in 2016 given the fact that Donald Trump made a cameo in the second movie while Kevin was swanning around in New York. \nThe original Home Alone (1990) which is by far the best of all the movies just because it’s simply a classic is available on Netflix in European countries such as Germany, Ireland, Netherlands, Nordic regions, Spain and Sweden. Plus the United Kingdom and Ireland also have Home Alone on Netflix. \nHome Alone 2 : Lost in New York (1992) is streaming on Netflix in Nordic regions, Germany, Spain and Switzerland. \nHome Alone 3 (1997) is streaming in Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Finland and Spain \nHome Alone: The Holiday Heist (2012) is unavailable on Netflix anywhere in the world. \nSo excluding the last movie (which sucks by the way) the best place to watch Home Alone is if you live in Spain in which case, go and buy your plane tickets now! \nLooking for other Christmas movies on Netflix?

      "text": "Glass 3 hours ago \nNetflix produced some of the most talked about new shows of 2016, from The Crown —its most expensive production to date—to Stranger Things to Marvel’s Luke Cage. \nFor Netflix, which aims to release something each individual subscriber will enjoy every single month , a diverse library of high-quality originals like these is crucial to growing and retaining its subscriber base. But it’s unclear exactly how hot new programmingtranslates into subscriber growth—one of Wall Street’s measures of success for the streaming giant. Often, it doesn’t happen immediately. \nThe platform says it doesn’t see a boost in subscribers tied to a particular show until the second season, after it has built up buzz and possibly earned some award nods. “It tends to be follow-on seasons of originals because it’s known intellectual property at that time,” said Spencer Wang, vice president of finance and investor relations at Netflix, speaking at an RBC Capital Markets conference last month. \nTo be sure, a few shows have driven subscriber growth for Netflix during their freshman runs, like Stranger Things and Marvel’s Luke Cage . But those seem to be rare. \nWhen a show does manage to draw in new members, Wang cautioned that it usually adds hundreds of thousands, not millions. That makes completely original series even more risky for the platform, because it’s often shouldering exorbitant marketing and production costs without knowing when and if they will pay off. \n“While we do put a big marketing push behind new [intellectual property] like The Crown , it is new IP, so it does take some time to find an audience and does not usually drive a material amount of acquisition,” Wang said. \nThis is a departure from free-to-air TV, where shows have historically lived and died on Nielsen’s measure of viewership. Shows with low ratings were swiftly cut down—sometimes as early as three weeks into a season . Netflix, by comparison, rarely cancels shows. One of its highest profile cancellations was of the Emmy-nominated thriller Bloodline; the verdict came after the third season. \nTo hedge against newer bets, Netflix has given second lives to older programs like Arrested Development, Gilmore Girls, and Full House that were cancelled by their respective broadcast networks years earlier. These revivals had dedicated fan bases that Netflix could tap into—offering a quick payoff from nostalgic fans who were eager for a reprisal. \nFans and critics found plenty of flaws with the Gilmore Girls revival, but at least 5 million people , or 6% of Netflix’s subscribers , still streamed Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life in its entirety within three days of its release, third-party measurement firm Symphony Advanced Media estimated. (Netflix itself doesn’t release viewership numbers and reject third-party data.) It was reportedly Netflix’s third most-binged series of the year in that window, behind another revival, Fuller House, and season five of Orange is the New Black . \nIn contrast, season two becomes even riskier with a revival because it has to faithfully build on the original to keep fans around. \nFuller House is the only of the three to get a second season, which will be released on Friday . Arrested Development was expected to get a fifth season and a movie , but three years later, production hasn’t started on either. And Gilmore Girls was planned as a four-episode mini-series, although chief content officer Ted Sarandos said he’s open to a sophomore season . Read full story ",

      "text": "TELL ME MORE! \nAccording to the announcement: \nToday we are launching a new television user interface that uses video more extensively to bring content alive in real time and helps members decide whether to click play. As we launch more than 1,000 hours of original content next year, we know we have less than 90 seconds to capture someone’s attention and get them excited about a title — that’s why we’re introducing video previews into the TV browsing experience. \nCall it what you want, but the feature is long overdue. Currently, Netflix only uses a rather odd star rating system — which tends to be hit or miss for me (and I’ve rated over 1,000 titles) — and a short blurb as a description. Users are then forced to leave the site to check IMDB for more in-depth information, or head to YouTube to view a trailer. ",

In the announcement, the company was quick to point out that these weren’t teasers or trailers, but instead a way to help users make better decisions about what to watch. The video preview aids users by “highlighting the story, characters, and tone of a title” — which totally sounds like a trailer. These “not-trailers” will play automatically on the title page when you click to view more information about a show or film.

      "text": "\n© 2016 Time Inc. All rights reserved. Netflix Is Now Top of the Apple App Store Food Chain \nNetflix is proving a free app can make big money on Apple’s App Store. \nThe video-streaming app, which is free for users to download but requires a subscription to its service, is now the top-grossing iPhone app in Apple’s App Store. The achievement comes about a year after Netflix announced that it would offer in-app purchases in the program, allowing users to sign up for the service or add the ability for multiple users to watch its content on the same account all from within its software. Sensor Tower, a company that offers mobile app services and analytics, says the app is also the top-grossing iPhone app in India, Mexico, and Colombia. \nApple AAPL tracks the most popular free and paid programs in its App Store based on their total number of downloads on any given day. The company’s top-grossing chart provides insight into the apps that are generating the most revenue through the marketplace. That revenue is generated through the sale of paid apps or via in-app purchases. In Netflix’s case, the company’s app is available as a free download, but comes with in-app purchases ranging from $8 a month to $12 per month, depending on the number of “screens,” or simultaneous viewers, a user might want. Get Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter \nNetflix’s success is also Apple’s success: Apple takes a portion of the revenue generated from paid apps and in-app purchases. Apple typically takes 30% of revenue generated from the sale of an app or in-app content, but for subscription-based apps of an auto-renewing subscription, the company takes 70% the first year and 85% in subsequent years. It’s unknown what the revenue-sharing agreement between Apple and Netflix is. \nNeither Netflix NFLX nor Apple shares how much an individual app generates in revenue through the marketplace, but Sensor Tower’s data suggests it might be significant. \nSensor Tower, which derives its data from anonymous information it collects across millions of smartphones, estimates that Netflix is generating nearly $2.9 million a week in net revenue from its iPhone app. The analytics firm estimates that Netflix’s weekly iPhone app revenue hovered at less than $50,000 in fall 2015, when the in-app purchases were rolling out to users. For more about Apple’Watch, watch: \nLooking ahead, Netflix might have some work cut out for it to stay atop the top-grossing heap. The chart is always changing and apps are constantly moving up and down the list. Just last month, for instance, Netflix was in the seventh spot for highest-grossing iPhone apps. On Nov. 14, it was in the second spot. \nNetflix did not immediately respond to a request for comment. ",

Are you in the mood for a comedy? A compelling drama? The comfort of a TV show you've watched over and over again? If only there was a way to get a little sample of the vibe of a film or series!\nEnter video previews. On Tuesday, Netflix announced that it launched a new feature that enables people to see a little preview of what they want to watch as they scroll over the title, and gave a little demo to show how it works. The company specifies these previews aren't trailers or teasers from the programs, but \"specially designed video synopses\" to really give you an idea of the plot and characters in what you're hovering over.\nMost Popular According to a blog post , \"These previews launch globally today and will become available on eligible devices over the next few weeks. They will be available on Netflix enabled devices, which includes the majority of game consoles and Roku devices, with smart TVs and others getting updated in the coming months.\"\nThere's also mention of more than 1,000 hours of original Netflix content to come over the next year (making a preview option all the more valuable!), so if this isn't reason enough to celebrate, I don't know what is.",

      "text": "A Peek at Netflix's Playbook for the Domestic Streaming Market PART 12 OF 12 How Netflix’s Valuation Metrics Compare By Shirley Pelts | Nov 30, 2016 4:58 pm EST Valuation metrics \nEarlier in this series, we learned about some key updates for Netflix. In this part of the series, we’ll look at how Netflix’s ( NFLX ) value proposition compares. Common valuation multiples for companies include the PE (price-to-earnings), EV-to-EBITDA (enterprise value to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization), PCF (price-to-cash flow), and PFCF (price-to-free cash flow) ratios. \nPrice-based multiples consider value from a shareholder’s perspective. EV-based multiples help investors understand the value of a company from the point of view of the holders of its capital. These are forward multiples based on the expected value of the denominator after a year. Is Netflix overvalued? \nAs the graph above indicates, Netflix has a high forward EV-to-EBITDA multiple of 49.6x and a PE multiple of 124.2x. In contrast, peers 21st Century Fox (FOXA), Time Warner ( TWX ), and CBS ( CBS ) have forward EV-to-EBITDA multiples of 9.1x, 10.6x, and 10.8x, respectively . Netflix’s value proposition \nIn the United States, Netflix is facing increased video streaming competition as media companies go direct-to-consumer and new players enter the market. In international markets, Netflix continues to expand rapidly, but it hasn’t turned profitable yet. The company also faces other challenges in international markets, including susceptibility to currency fluctuations, language barriers, and varying Internet speeds. It remains to be seen how Netflix will withstand competition in domestic markets and overcome its international challenges. Stay tuned. {\"metrics\":[\"Open\"],\"tickers\":[\"NFLX\",\"FOXA\",\"TWX\",\"CBS\"],\"ticker_names\":[\"Netflix, Inc.\",null,\"Time Warner Inc.\",\"CBS Corporation\"]} X",

      "text": "Netflix Is Launching a New Feature That Will Make It Much Easier to Decide What to Watch \nYassss! By Diana Bruk Dec 06, 2016 — Netflix US (@netflix) December 6, 2016 Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Figuring out what to watch on Netflix feels like an absolutely endless study of the depths of your soul. Are you in the mood for a comedy? A compelling drama? The comfort of a TV show you've watched over and over again? If only there were a way to get a little sample of the vibe of a film or series! Enter video previews. On Tuesday, Netflix announced that it launched a new feature that enables people to see a little preview of what they want to watch as they scroll over the title, and gave a little demo to show how it works. The company specifies these previews aren't trailers or teasers from the programs, but \"specially designed video synopses\" to really give you an idea of the plot and characters in what you're hovering over. According to a blog post , \"These previews launch globally today and will become available on eligible devices over the next few weeks. They will be available on Netflix enabled devices, which includes the majority of game consoles and Roku devices, with smart TVs and others getting updated in the coming months.\" There's also mention of more than 1,000 hours of original Netflix content to come over the next year (making a preview option all the more valuable!), so if this isn't reason enough to celebrate, I don't know what is.

      "title": "Voltron: Legendary Defender Season 2 Could Have Two Release Dates on Netflix | Gospelherald.com",
      "text": "Comment When will Season 2 arrive? Netflix/Dreamworks \nI would like to think that many of us will have fond memories of our childhood events. It does not matter which era that we hail from or were born in -- there will always be something that has happened which ends up seared in our memories, from a game to a cartoon or TV series. For those who grew up in the 1980s, you would know that the cartoon series from Japan GoLion, also known as Voltron, was quite the hit back in the day. After all, the idea of different robots joining up to form different parts of one large robot certainly appeals to the imagination regardless of which background you are from. With the remake of this Japanese anime series, Voltron: Defender of the Universe, making its way to Netflix not too long ago, it looks like Season 2 of the Netflix series is going to bring with it its fair share of excitement as well as anticipation. \nRecent reports do point to the new Voltron movie getting not one release date, but two. How is all of that going to work out for the world? Well, we simply need to sit back and enjoy the latest developments. After all, it is but a matter of time that the movie will be released, so a wee bit of patience never killed anyone. \nVoltron: Legendary Defender is the GoLion remake that is ready for its second season, being the brainchild of Joaquim Dos Santos and Lauren Montgomery, who work under the DreamWorks Animation banner. Netflix Japan did mention in the past earlier this year that Voltron is an exclusive , and with work being done on the second season, you can be sure that all our eyes are peeled on a possible release date. Word on the street has it that two release dates will be part of the plan. The first premiere of the live-action movie will happen in the US when January 20, 2017, rolls around, where it will be aligned to the \"Voltron\" series premiere over in Japan. \nHowever, do take note that a small group of fans who rant and rave about a show is not enough to keep it going. There has been recent whispers that point out the possibility of Voltron Legendary Defender being halted in its production, if there are not enough eyeballs each week to keep the series going. Should there be a drop in viewership, or even a level that the studio thinks is not enough to continue, then there is every real possibility of Voltron: Legendary Defender being canned. That is the sad but hard truth of any situation where TV series are concerned, as it is all about the money at the end of the day. \nThis is not the first reboot attempt of Voltron, and we do not think that it will be the last. Should the series see its production canned, then you can be pretty sure that all the robot-joining wizardry in the world is not going to save it, and perhaps such a formula might no longer appeal to the new generation of viewers who grew up with far more fantastic ideas of what “cool” is all about.

      "text": "FarkIt Netflix is notoriously tight-lipped about the data people most want to know about the service and its subscribers. Most specifically, they avoid releasing anything concrete about how many people are actually watching their original productions. It’s a nice bit of curtain-drawing that lets them soak up all the cultural heft that comes from being THE THING everyone is talking about without ever having to publicly worry that they are speaking to anyone beyond digital-obsessed social media junkies who relish the opportunity to write anything in the Stranger Things font. (You could make a case that they are slowly weaponizing the process of targeting exactly those kinds of people, although you’d have to account for the Adam Sandler conundrum, so probably best to just say that their strategy is a big, big tent.) They make up for this lack of information with semi-constant dumps of other kinds of information, usually about some funny quirk of how people actually use the service: hey, people usually watch two episodes of a series in one sitting. Hey, people tend to watch Breaking Bad faster than they watch Gilmore Girls. Hey, two-thirds of users with cats have tried to train them to click the “Continue Watching” button. For the average viewer, I suspect these tidbits of info are – if not completely pointless – on close personal terms with pointless. I guess if you have a lot of personal worth invested in your style of Netflix watching, they make sense, although I suspect we’re at least a couple of years away from Buzzfeed quizzes predicting what kind of Netflixer you are or people using phrases like “Four-episodes-a-sitting enthusiast” on their online dating profiles. (Good god, I can already hear the Christmas party conversations ringing through my ears like the wails of the damned.) As info dumps go, though, they are interesting for their underlying assumptions and implications, which tend to either lay bare the semi-terrifying degree to which Netflix has entwined itself into our daily lives or suggest the ways in which they will be doing that even more effectively in the near future. Certainly that’s the case with its latest bit of info, that people tend to take a break between binging series with a movie or two, and that these movies tend to be pretty predictable based on whatever series they just finished watching. That, in and of itself, is, again, weird that a (presumably) statistically relevant number of people watch The Princess Bride after gorging on Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, but as a viewer I don’t really know what you do with that information, other than maybe congratulate yourself on being the kind of devil-may-care renegade who watches The Martian after gorging on Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. Keep flying that freak flag high, brother. What is more interesting is the fact that the average lag time between finishing one series and then committing to a whole entire other series is three days. It takes most people an entire long weekend before committing themselves to like 20-plus more hours of television, and they can’t even not watch something in the interim – they feel the need to fill that gap with a movie, a little snack between trips to the all-you-can-eat buffet. Ted Sarandos, Chief Content Officer of Netflix, confirmed that this was typical of the Netflix experience. “We find that you’re either a very casual user, or it’s a part of your daily life,” he said over the phone. “And for most of our members, it’s a part of their daily life.” He also explained that the typical Netflix user spent about 70 per cent of their time watching TV, and 30 per cent watching movies, a number that holds pretty constant across countries and varied libraries. So, basically, whatever actual show its subscribers are watching, Netflix is basically replacing the TV experience, but with a few more hooks to keep you around for when your stories are finished. The barb on those hooks, or more specifically how those are about to grow, is the other interesting implication of this information. At present, Netflix’s recommendation system is a little broad. It seems to have a basic idea of the type of content you like, and it will give you a couple of those in between suggesting that, despite months of not even so much as slowing your scroll speed as you zip past it, this might finally be the time you decide to watch The Ranch, or maybe one of its dozens of comedy specials. (I do love to laugh, so kudos there, I guess.) You can improve it by rating stuff or, of course, watching more, but being able to sort out this kind of time or event-specific preference is vastly more valuable than anything you might actively tell them. You may call yourself a coffee addict, for instance, but presumably you’re more interested in it at breakfast than when you’re on the way home from the bar. Now, Netflix just knows you like coffee, and will offer it to you whenever you ask them for a drink. Soon, they’ll be able to tell that what you really want now is some water – which will make both going to them and clicking on one of their shows all the more attractive. “Statistically, when you’ve finished a series, the next thing you’ll probably want to watch is a series,” explains Sarandos. “But, at that moment, you probably want to watch a movie. We want these algorithms to get more and more refined and more and more sophisticated, so that it recognizes moods.” “Over time, it will evolve and be even more sophisticated. So maybe it will consider what time of day you’re watching, what kind of device you’re watching on,” he adds. “You probably do want to watch something different if you’re on an iPad at eight in the morning than if you’re watching television at eight at night. This is all kind of an iteration of the sophisticated merchandising and recommendation.” Related Why does Netflix always have near-perfect movie recommendations, and then one odd ball? This isn’t entirely new in the whole online streaming world, at least if you broaden the horizons a bit. Songza, for instance, was a music service that essentially forced you to pick what you wanted to listen to based on your “mood” – none of that messy “thinking about and specifically choosing something.” It’s a feature, if not quite as prominent, on almost all music services now, and it has popped up now and again on video streaming, too – the recently departed shomi’s graduated genre service was an attempt at this kind of thing. The trick here is that Netflix will likely keep this all in the background. “What we’re trying to do is work on the personalization experience to put choosing in the background and loving at the front of mind,” as Sarandos explained it. Rather than asking you, it will attempt to understand what you’re in the mood for, give it to you, and it will never even occur to you that you were guided to continue watching, without even so much as a three-day break. It all sounds a little Black Mirror-y, of course, but that is basically just the promise of so much of this deep-dive tech data: giving you what you want before you even know you want it. And speaking of wanting, if you understand that Black Mirror reference, you may want to check out Inception — statistically speaking, it’s what you probably want to watch next anyway. \nFull List of TV + Movie Pairings – Canada Series ",

Tweet Supernatural Season 12 on Netflix - Copyright The CW \nLooking for season 12 of Supernatural on Netflix? Then look no further as we’ve got all the release information for when season 12 of The CW’s Supernatural will be coming to Netflix, and it’s much sooner than previous years. \nThe CW catalog on Netflix is quite impressive, stretching back many years and Supernatural has been on Netflix as far as my memory stretches back and has been extremely popular alongside the other CW shows similar to it including The Vampire Diaries and The Originals. The show has been airing on The CW since 2005. \nNever seen Supernatural before? Then you’re in for a treat. The Supernatural show by name and by nature pits two brothers picking up the work that their father started by hunting down all things paranormal. Whether it’s vampires, werewolves, ghouls or anything else these brothers are coming for you. \nSeason 12 of the show has a lot of fans questioning how much longer the series has left with it soon surpassing 250 episodes. It’s story however, are still as captivating as ever with our heroes getting into deeper and more complex storylines. \nLet’s get onto whether or not it’ll be on Netflix and depending on that answer; we’ll then determine when Supernatural season 12 will be on Netflix. \nThe status of most CW shows was up in the air over the summer as rumors of The CW removing all of its content was on the table. It turns out though that Netflix renewed the contract but not only that, it actually improved the terms. \nUsually, we’d expect new seasons of Supernatural to land on Netflix each October as it’s down for the past three years in a row but the new deal we just mentioned will be bringing the series to Netflix much faster this period with it arriving as soon as eight days as the series wraps up on The CW. This means, given how the show is on the same air schedule as last year, that we’ll probably see season 12 of Supernatural be on Netflix in May/June 2017 . \nAre you excited for Supernatural coming to Netflix earlier than normal?

      "title": "New Kids On The Block to guest in Season 2 of Netflix’s Fuller House",
      "text": "  New Kids On The Block to guest in Season 2 of Netflix’s Fuller House By Edmund Silvestre New York Correspondent   Jodie Sweetin and Andrea Barber with the New Kids On The Block in a scene from Netflix’s Fuller House Season 2, which is premiering globally tomorrow, Dec. 9 \nMANILA, Philippines – The ‘90s nostalgia continues with the arrival of the second season of one of the decade’s hit TV series Full House — resurrected as Fuller House — premiering globally tomorrow, Dec. 9, via Netflix. \nThe Tanners and Gibblers are back with holiday-themed episodes marking Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year, among other things. Topbilled by Candace Cameron-Bure, Jodie Sweetin and Andrea Barber, the original cast will be joined by the show’s veterans Bob Saget, John Stamos, Lori Loughlin, Dave Coulier, and Blake and Dylan Tuomy-Wilhoit. \n“The house is very full, indeed,” says Barber at the show’s New York City junket held recently at the Essex House. “We have so many die-hard fans that have been so loyal to the show for 29 years. We were hoping they would love Fuller House as much as they loved Full House, and they did.” \nIn the reboot series still set in San Francisco, recently-widowed D.J. Tanner-Fuller (Cameron-Bure,) finds herself living in one roof with younger sister Stephanie Tanner (Sweetin) and D.J.’s best friend, Kimmy Gibbler (Barber), a single mom. The three have joined forces to help support each other, particularly in raising D.J.’s three boys (Jackson, 13; Max, 7; and baby Tommy Jr.), as well as Kimmy’s feisty teen daughter Ramona, and Kimmy’s semi ex-husband Fernando. \nWith themes ranging from parenting and relationships to career and everyday conflicts, Fuller House remains a good, clean family sitcom that the entire family can watch together. \n“We got a great response from our audience,” says Barber. “It (revival) was even bigger than I expected. Wow, we were pretty blown away. I just felt more confident that we’re in the right direction. We knew what we were doing, and the show didn’t bomb. Our fans are still there, they’re happy, they love the nostalgic factor. They’re still super invested emotionally in our characters.”   \n“Yes, it’s a sitcom, but it’s a sitcom rich with family dynamics, personal relationships, kids growing up, adults finding their way,” adds Sweetin, saying that the show’s storyline mirrors the cast’s personal lives as well. \nJust like in the first season of the revival, there will be no Michelle Tanner, played alternately by twins Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, who both announced retirement from acting at age 17 (they are now 30) to become full-time fashion moguls. \nSweetin says the stars and crew of the classic show tried everything they could think of to lure the Olsen twins to reprise their beloved role to no avail. \nBut Fuller House’s Season 2 will feature a number of special guests and fun cameos, including one of the hottest boy bands of the ‘90s, the New Kids On The Block (NKOTB). \nSweetin reveals that both Cameron-Bure and Barber were huge NKOTB fans and had the hardest time concentrating when the popular group was on the set. She says how the boy band ended up at the Tanner house is something fans must look forward to. \nAccording to Sweetin, Fuller House’s Season 2 can stand apart from Season 1, and first time viewers won’t feel lost even without seeing the first season, or even the original classic series that ran from 1987 to 1995. It helps, she says, that the revival has a huge amount of throwback moments. \n“Fuller House is its own show,” explains Barber. “Even if you’ve never watched the first eight seasons, you can start entirely and you can just pick up there and sort of fill in the blanks. It can stand on its own feet.” \nBob Boyett and Jeff Franklin are executive producers. The series is from Miller-Boyett Productions and Jeff Franklin Productions, in association with Warner Horizon Television for Netflix. \n“The show’s creator and executive producer Jeff Franklin really wanted to protect the show’s legacy,” says Sweetin. “This show is his baby and he wanted to make sure we did the legacy proud.” The complete cast of Netflix’s ‘good, clean family sitcom’  ",

You can watch the classic “White Christmas,” starring Bing Crosby, or go the creepy route with the “Black Mirror: White Christmas” episode. Of course, there are plenty of other holiday favorites to watch, including “Love Actually” and the 1994 “Miracle on 34th Street” remake. \nCheck out the calendar below for some of the best holiday movies (and new specials, like “Reggie Watts: Spatial”) currently streaming on the service. With the exception of a couple premieres (”Trollhunters,”“Netflix NYE Countdowns”), most of the movies are already available to watch all month long. Netflix",

But that doesn’t mean you'll bail on Netflix content, it just means you’re likely to switch to watching movies for a few days.\nAnd, you’ve guessed it, Netflix has a pretty good idea of what you’re going to watch next based on the TV series you just completed. \nContinue reading... \nTrending right now: \n10 great iOS 10 widgets that should be on every iPhone T-Mobile’s multi-number ‘Digits’ solution can transform any phone into a T-Mobile phone Apple killed MagSafe on the MacBook Pro, but you can have it on your iPhone 7 ",

      "text": "Share on Google Plus Share on WhatsApp \nIf the title of Netflix's upcoming sitcom One Day at a Time sounds familiar, that's because it should -- this new version is a reboot of the classic '70s and '80s Norman Lear sitcom . To get you hyped for the January premiere of the new series, the streaming service released the show's first trailer on Wednesday. \nThis new edition focuses on three generations of a Cuban-American family, led by newly single military veteran Penelope ( Justina Machado ), as they all try to live together under one roof. Two show business legends are involved: Rita Moreno , who is one of only two people in history to earn a Triple Crown of Acting (Oscar, Emmy and Tony), plays Lydia, Penelope's mother; and 94-year-old Norman Lear himself executive-produces, with Gloria Calderón Kellett and Mike Royce serving as showrunners. \nThe best shows of 2016 \nOne Day at a Time continues Netflix's push into multicamera sitcoms as it seeks to please all demographics. Netflix struck gold with Fuller House , a sequel to the '90s sitcom Full House , and found critical success with Ashton Kutcher's The Ranch . \nAll 13 episodes of One Day at a Time 's first season arrive on Netflix Friday, Jan. 6.",

      "text": "Photos: PBS, BBC , Illustration: Dillen Phelps Stream Sherlock + More Options Powered by \nI know you’re all about what’s new on Netflix and what’s percolating on HBO , but believe me when I say you should really be giving PBS (and its growing streaming service) a try this fall and winter. Between Hamilton’s America , The Great British Baking Show ‘s Masterclass series , the upcoming completion of The Hollow Crown series, and early 2017’s Sherlock season four and Victoria , PBS is totally killing it when it comes to brilliant original content. Oh, yeah, and they make it easy and free to stream almost all of their shows and specials. \nI should admit up top that I’ve always been a massive dork for PBS programming. I was practically weaned on Mr. Rogers’ Neighborhood , Sesame Street , and Reading Rainbow . I grew up on Anne of Green Gables and marathons of The Chronicles of Narnia . I learned all about romance from Masterpiece Theater . You get what I’m saying. Still, even as a lifelong devotee, I’m in absolute awe of how PBS has significantly upped their game this fall and winter. PBS always has a steady stream of great arts entertainment, but now there seems to be a newfound focus on the “entertainment” part of that phrase. \nPBS kicked off their fall programming slate with Hamilton’s America . The documentary features an intimate look at the creation of the Broadway smash and gives us an all-too-human look at the lives of both Lin-Manuel Miranda and Alexander Hamilton himself. It was a big, bold start to a season that continues to get better and better. PBS presented rebooted versions of Anne of Green Gables and Pollyanna in time for Thanksgiving. They’ve been slaying it on Masterpiece: Poldark ‘s controversial second season and The Durrells in Corfu just ended, making way for the aforementioned The Hollow Crown, Sherlock , and Victoria . \nThe Hollow Crown is a catch all term for a series of lavish BBC Shakespeare adaptations. The first four came out a few years ago and gave us Ben Whishaw as Richard II and Tom Hiddleston as Henry V. Now we’ll get Tom Sturridge as Henry VI and Benedict Cumberbatch as Richard III. Cumberbatch is kind of a big deal on PBS. Season Four of Sherlock will finally debut on January 1, 2017. Finally, Victoria might be your next costume drama obsession. It became a massive hit when it debuted in the UK this year. Think of it as The Crown , but the queen actually has power. \nPBS is also changing the way they approach streaming. They’ve always offered free access to some of their biggest titles, but now they’ve launched PBS Passport. This new membership based service offers subscribers the chance to watch popular titles that have expired from the free streaming site. Think Downton Abbey, Wolf Hall , and yes, Hamilton’s America (boy, they yanked that off of the “free to stream” list fast). Yes, you have to pay for it, but in true PBS fashion, you’re not paying for a streaming service. Instead, you are “becoming a member.” It’s $60 for a year’s “membership” or a mere $5 per month. ",

To get you hyped for the January premiere of the new series, the streaming service released the show's first trailer on Wednesday. \nThis new edition focuses on three generations of a Cuban-American family, led by newly single military veteran Penelope (Justina Machado), as they all try to live together under one roof. Two show business legends are involved: Rita Moreno, who is one of only two people in history to earn a Triple Crown of Acting (Oscar, Emmy and Tony), plays Lydia, Penelope's mother; and 94-year-old Norman Lear himself executive-produces, with Gloria Calderón Kellett and Mike Royce serving as showrunners. \nThe best shows of 2016 \nOne Day at a Time continues Netflix's push into multicamera sitcoms as it seeks to please all demographics. Netflix struck gold with Fuller House, a sequel to the '90s sitcom Full House, and found critical success with Ashton Kutcher's The Ranch. \nAll 13 episodes of One Day at a Time's first season arrive on Netflix Friday, Jan. 6. \n  One Day At A TimeJustina MachadoRita Moreno About Us",
