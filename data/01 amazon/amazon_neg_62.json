This year, they expect the number to be higher.\n“We’ve got probably over a thousand people working today,” Stone said.\nEcho Dot\nThe most popular items this year? Tech gadgets like Amazon’s Echo — a voice-controlled speaker — and the smaller Echo Dot.\nAlso hot — the original Kindle and interactive kids toys.\nEven during this time of high demand, Amazon still has free two-day delivery for Prime members.

      "text": "Amazon Gets Real About Fake Products on Its Marketplace Spencer Soper Nov 28, 2016 6:44 pm ET (Bloomberg) -- Randy Hetrick first noticed counterfeits on Amazon.com Inc. in 2013. He had been selling his TRX Training System-- an exercise kit of suspension straps-- on the site since 2008. When he began noticing cheap imitations, he had his employees scour Amazon for more, then go through the tedious process of reporting them for removal. But new imposters would pop up right away, and by 2014, \"We realized this was an epidemic,\" said Hetrick, who estimates phonies cost him $100 million a year, twice his annual sales. Amazon's Marketplace gives inventors like Hetrick exposure to hundreds of millions of shoppers without the big expense of building and promoting a website from scratch. Merchants give Amazon a commission on each sale. But a hot-selling product on Amazon encourages counterfeiters to make flimsy knockoffs with cheap materials, steal sales and damage a brand with few consequences. Amazon has known the problem is getting worse, according to a source familiar with the matter, but for years, the company has been largely silent about the flourishing fakes. That has frustrated manufacturers and brand owners who bear the cost and responsibility of policing the site, reporting problems and hoping Amazon takes action. It's the subject of the latest episode of the Decrypted podcast (subscribe here on iTunes). SoundCloud: The Fake Reviews and Counterfeits That Amazon's Trying to Quash by Bloomberg Now, the world's biggest online retailer is getting serious. It has made fighting phonies a major goal for 2017, building teams in the U.S. and Europe to work with major brands on a registry to prevent fakes, according to a person familiar with the initiative, who was not authorized to speak about the matter and requested anonymity. Discussions with Major League Baseball and the National Football League about selling merchandise on Amazon hit a standstill earlier this year due to concerns about Amazon's lack of control over fakes, the person said. “Amazon has zero tolerance for the sale of counterfeit items on our site,\" Amazon said in a statement. The company said it was \"aggressively pursuing bad actors.\" In a statement, the MLB said: “It is our responsibility to provide our fans with reliable and secure marketplaces to purchase officially licensed merchandise. Given the rampant growth of online-only retailers supplying counterfeit merchandise, our policies must hold every distribution partner to that same level of commitment.” The NFL declined to comment. The new Amazon teams will encourage brands -- even those that don't sell on Amazon -- to register with the online store, the person said. Once registered, Amazon requires any marketplace merchants listing those products to prove that they have the brand's permission to sell them online. Amazon began experimenting with the registry earlier this year with Nike and other companies. The bigger push in 2017 will target thousands of large companies, including those that have been reluctant to sell on Amazon because of knock-offs. In addition, this month Amazon teamed up with Hetrick's business to sue three people, accusing them of selling fakes on its site. It filed another similar suit the same day against an alleged counterfeit ring. Moving the battle to a courtroom is an acknowledgment that despite spending tens of millions of dollars a year and employing an army of software engineers, investigators and research scientists tasked with fighting copycats, Amazon is not winning the war against counterfeiters. \"The depressing thing about it is, brands that invest the most to innovate and create new products are the ones that lose the most because they are the ones the counterfeiters target,\" said Hetrick, who is encouraged by Amazon's new vigilance. \"You end up becoming the sales and marketing arm for these shysters selling illegal goods.\" Amazon is desperately trying to bring order to the Wild West atmosphere on its marketplace, where more than 2 million independent sellers compete for the attention and money of shoppers. About half of the goods purchased on Amazon come from independent merchants, who help Amazon expand its inventory more quickly and with less upfront cost than Amazon could do on its own. It also makes the retailer and its customers more vulnerable to fakes because the simple online registration process currently in place is designed to make it easy for businesses to begin selling immediately. But that also makes it simple for counterfeiters to list fake goods, sell as many as they can before they're detected, and then vanish. Amazon’s suits targeting sellers were the first of their kind for the company, a warning to counterfeiters heading into the busy holiday shopping season when the most is at stake. It could be too little, too late. The shift of spending from stores with tight inventory controls to online marketplaces where it's tough to distinguish between fake and authentic is fueling a rise in counterfeiting that shows no signs of slowing. Alibaba and Ebay are also grappling with copycat products. Counterfeits made up nearly $500 billion, or 2.5 percent, of global imports in 2013, a figure expected to grow as more spending shifts online, according to an April report by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. China is the biggest source of phonies. Despite efforts to decrease them, complaints about imitations on Amazon have been growing along with its inventory since at least 2014, according to a person familiar with the matter. What Amazon has known internally for years is spilling into the public eye. Birkenstock announced it would cease selling products on Amazon in January due to concerns about counterfeits. And in October, Apple Inc. sued an Amazon supplier claiming the business sold fake Apple products -- some of them unsafe -- on Amazon. \"Online counterfeiting is never going to go down,\" said Stuart Fuller, director of commercial operations at NetNames, which helps brands identify marketplaces and websites where counterfeit products are sold. \"Amazon is the most trusted marketplace in the world. That in and of itself attracts this nefarious element because they know shoppers go there and trust what they are buying is genuine.\" Bret Rosenzweig is another inventor who has felt the sting of counterfeits on Amazon. His company, DC Innovations, makes the Urban Shelf, a collapsible plastic nightstand that wedges between a mattress and box spring. Bachelors and college students are the target market, and Amazon was the perfect place to introduce the product to the masses in 2009. Once his sales on Amazon started picking up around 2015, counterfeiters took notice, mimicked the design with cheaper materials and offered it for less. That's a double-blow to Rosenzweig, who loses a sale and now has a potential customer unimpressed with his brand (or what the customer thinks is his brand). Rosenzweig checks Amazon each day, scouring the marketplace for counterfeiters selling his product. The process of reporting the fakes to Amazon has been a time-suck. He spots a knock-off, buys the item and when he receives it, he takes photos and submits a report to Amazon. The company is usually quick about suspending the counterfeiters, but new accounts quickly spring up in their place and the game of whack-a-mole continues, Rosenzweig said. He can no longer order phony items to his home address because his adversaries know he is conducting a test purchase, so he has his business partner order them. Rosenzweig said he’d welcome any new effort from Amazon to crack down. \"Buying the fakes and reporting them is a waste of my time,\" he said. Amazon, EBay and Alibaba are largely shielded from legal liability as long as they have processes in place for brands to report fake goods and take timely action to suspend their sale once notified. The online marketplaces often don’t have the inventory, so there is nothing to seize. The result is an endless loop with brands buying and reporting fakes, marketplaces suspending accounts, and the fraudsters creating new accounts to hawk the same fake goods under new pseudonyms. EBay lets registered brand owners report suspected counterfeit listings for removal, as does Alibaba. But the retailers can only do so much. Shoppers worried about buying fakes during the holidays have to bear some responsibility, said Akino Chikada, senior brand protection manager at the firm MarkMonitor, which helps brands find online sources of counterfeits. She suggests looking closely at web addresses for subtle variations from brand names and probing websites for sloppy privacy and return policies, which can signal a phony. Bargain basement prices are another tell-tale sign, though sophisticated counterfeiters try to make the price difference less suspicious by coming in at 10 or 20 percent below other offers rather than half price, she said. \"Counterfeiters do a good job mimicking the look and feel of a brand,\" she said. \"It's so easy for people, in just a few clicks, to unknowingly buy counterfeit goods.\" Want more stories like this every week?

      "text": "Stop complaining about specifics, this is a tablet for $33.\nAmazon has the 7-inch Fire tablet with 8GB storage (and \"special offers\" ads) on sale right now for just $33. If that's all you needed to hear, click right here and buy one before they run out of stock.\n\nIf you aren't convinced right away, for 33 bucks you're getting a quad-core 7-inch tablet that can run Android apps from the Amazon app store or ones you sideload from other places. Basically, anything that doesn't need Google's Play Services integration. If you like to tinker with things, you can monkey with the software and install \"regular\" Android and/or the Google Play Store with a little bit of effort.\nRead:Why you should try the Amazon Fire tablet \nIf you're not the kind of person who hacks away at tablet software, this is the best tablet you can buy for $33. In fact, it's the only tablet you should buy for $33. It's perfect to sit on the living room table to control your lights or TV remote. It's perfect to give to the kids (without the password for app purchases!) so they can shoot angry birds out of a slingshot or watch a video or two. Or 90. For $33, you can buy one for each kid so they aren't fighting over it and stuff them in a stocking so you look like a superhero when they grab it.\nIt's no iPad or Pixel C . But it's the best damn tablet you can buy for $33.\nSee at Amazon \n",

      "text": "An Amazon employee leapt from a company building Monday morning after sending an email to hundreds of co-workers, including CEO Jeff Bezos.\nA Seattle Fire Department spokesperson confirmed that a man jumped from a rooftop at an Amazon building at Ninth Avenue North and Thomas Street.\nThe rooftop was about four stories up -- the pedestal section of the 12-story high-rise -- but the man fell only about 20 feet to a balcony below, Lt. Harold Webb, with Seattle Fire, said.\nHe was taken to Harborview Medical Center with non-life-threatening injuries.\nJust minutes before jumping, however, the man sent an email to hundreds of other Amazon employees, including CEO Jeff Bezos, according to a Bloomberg report.\nThe contents of the email were not disclosed, but Bloomberg's anonymous source said the man had been put on an employee improvement plan after requesting a transfer to a different department. An employee on an improvement plan can risk termination if they don't improve.\nAmazon's reputation as a tough workplace was only worsened by a New York Times story last year that painted a dark picture of working at the e-commerce giant. In response, Amazon's Jay Carney (former White House Press Secretary) was quick to paint the NYT piece as something of a hatchet job, and a Times' public editor wrote a column weighing whether the piece was fair.\nDaniel DeMay covers Seattle culture, business and transportation for seattlepi.com.

      "text": "November 28, 2016 at 19:15 PM EST Seven West Media Selects Cloudera, Contexti and Amazon Web Services to Deliver Innovation in Audience Engagement \nSYDNEY, Nov. 28, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cloudera , the global provider of the fastest, easiest, and most secure data management and analytics platform built on Apache Hadoop, Apache Spark and the latest open source technologies, has partnered with Australian-based data analytics experts, Contexti , to deploy an advanced big data solution for Australian media giant Seven West Media (SWM). The solution was run as a pilot program for SWM’s coverage of the 2016 Australian Open Tennis event before being expanded to support the extensive and groundbreaking coverage of the 2016 Rio Olympic Games in Australia. It now forms the core of SWM’s data capability as the company continues to provide market leading audience engagement and innovative advertising solutions. \nData analytics experts from Contexti were engaged to assist in the design, build, and management of a modern data platform to support SWM’s evolving digital strategy aimed at delivering much deeper insights into viewer behaviour. \nSidney Minassian, founder and CEO of Contexti, said, “Seven West Media has recognised the shift in how broadcast television is consumed by their audiences. Underpinned by Cloudera’s sophisticated data analytics platform, Cloudera Enterprise and an array of advanced digital strategies, Seven West Media is leading the innovation in content and audience experiences. Together we were able to uplift the organisation’s data and analytics capabilities, delivering new insights to personalise the viewer experience and deliver higher ROI for their customers.” \nAdopting a cloud-first approach, SWM’s data solution runs on Amazon Web Services (AWS) with a Cloudera enterprise data hub at its core providing a fast, secure, and easily scalable platform that can adapt to demand. \n“There were two key data challenges that we needed to solve. Firstly, the variety and complexity of the data sources meant that we needed a mature and enterprise-grade open-source data management solution at the core of our data ecosystem. The second challenge for us was the highly variable nature of the events that generated the data, with huge events like the Rio Olympics needing to be supported over and above business-as-usual demand. This drove our decision for a cloud-based solution,” said Sharmaine Salis, head of Data Architecture at Seven West Media. \nIn preparing for the Rio Olympics, the Contexti team ran comprehensive performance tests to form a clear benchmark. With a high level of uncertainty around data volumes that would actually be generated, SWM took advantage of their cloud-based solution and the new elastic-pricing model from Cloudera. \n“Although we were pretty confident in the performance of the system after Contexti’s tests, we decided to err on the side of caution. So, with only one week to go before the Opening Ceremony, we provisioned additional nodes. And a week after the Games, we turned them off again. That is exactly the type of flexibility we needed!” said Salis. \nThe solution transformed the enormous data volumes into the usable data sets to drive a comprehensive suite of dashboards. These were delivered to key stakeholders each day to give executives access to critical audience metrics throughout the event. \nThis same data was also used to underpin an innovative audience engagement program. Over one million people registered on the Olympics app or website during the event. Each user’s level of engagement with the content was tracked across over 200 daily variables and these were used to trigger highly targeted and personalised emails aimed at increasing user engagement. \n“Over the two weeks, we delivered 2.7 million emails across 108 targeted campaigns triggered by audience behaviours. The results of the program were compelling. We measured a 29 percent increase in the average minutes streamed by users who engaged in the program when compared against a control group,” said David Miller, director of Data and Business Intelligence at SWM. “Our data solution has transformed how we can understand our audience as well as how we can proactively engage them.” \n“This project demonstrates the power of a data-driven analytics programme,” said Shyam Srinivasan, regional director for Australia and New Zealand at Cloudera. “This has been an absolutely stellar result for Seven West Media, who have been able to use their massive supply of data to great effect, bringing tangible business benefits to the company. Working together with Contexti, it’s compelling to see where this partnership can go, as big data analytics comes to have more and more of an impact on Seven West Media’s operations.” \n\nAbout Cloudera \nCloudera delivers the modern data management and analytics platform built on Apache Hadoop, Apache Spark and the latest open source technologies.

      "text": "Amazon.com Inc.'s stock (AMZN) fell 1.7% in midday trade Monday, which should come as no surprise to investors despite early reports of another big jump in overall Cyber Monday online sales. On the 11 previous Cyber Mondays, which was coined by Shop.org and the National Retail Federation in 2005, Amazon's stock fell six times, including the past three years. The median percentage move for the stock on the first Monday after Thanksgiving has been a decline of 0.2%, while the average move on the day was a decline of about 0.1%. Meanwhile, the SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT) dropped 0.9% on Monday, which is exactly what history suggests. On the past 10 Cyber Mondays since the ETF's inception in June 2006, it has declined nine times, with an average decline of 2.5%. That includes a 10% decline on the 2008 Cyber Monday, which was in the middle of the financial crisis. Despite Monday's decline, Amazon's stock is still up 13% year to date, while the retail ETF has gained 6.9% and the S&P 500 index has climbed 7.9%.\n-Tomi Kilgore; 1400ET\n ",

      "text": "By Tomi Kilgore, MarketWatch\nShares have fallen on most Cyber Mondays, while retail sector ETF has almost always declined\nAmazon.com Inc.'s stock dropped Monday, which should come as no surprise to investors despite reports of a big jump in sales during the busiest online shopping day of the year.\nCyber Monday is a phrase that Shop.org coined in 2005, in an effort to create a Black Friday-like buzz for online retailers on the first Monday after Thanksgiving. Although Cyber Monday is no longer a one-day event for many retailers (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/sears-cyber-monday-sales-to-start-a-day-early-last-a-day-longer-2016-11-22), it is still on track to retain its position as the top online shopping day (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/cyber-monday-expected-to-entice-122-million-americans-to-pounce-on-deals-2016-11-28), according to Adobe Digital Insights.\nAmazon's stock (AMZN) closed Monday down 1.7%, to mark the fourth-straight Cyber Monday decline. On the 12 Cyber Mondays since its inception, Amazon's stock has declined seven times. The biggest one-day percentage decline was 5.2% on Dec. 1, 2008, in the midst of the financial crisis, while the biggest gain was 6.4% on Nov. 28, 2011. See table of Cyber Monday moves below.\n(https://sw.graphiq.com/w/3DsaIrDmlil)\nThe median one-day move has been a 0.3% decline, the same as the overall average move.\nMeanwhile, the selloff in the broader retail sector is almost exactly what history suggests should happen. The SPDR S&P Retail exchange-traded fund (XRT) slumped 1.2%, after falling on nine of the previous 10 Cyber Mondays since the ETF's launch in June 2006. The median decline on down days is 1.2%, while the average drop was 2.4%.\nIn comparison, the S&P 500 index 0.5% on Monday, to mark the 10th Cyber Monday decline, including five in a row.\nDon't miss:5 tips for safe shopping on Cyber Monday (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/5-tips-for-safe-shopping-on-cyber-monday-2016-11-21).\nSee also: Black Friday and Thanksgiving online shopping surpasses $5 billion for the first time (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/black-friday-online-shopping-surpasses-3-billion-for-the-first-time-2016-11-25).\n-Tomi Kilgore; 415-439-6400; AskNewswires@dowjones.com\nCyber Monday one-day percentage moves Date Amazon's stock (AMZN) SPDR Retail ETF (XRT) S&P 500 (SPX) Nov. 28, 2016 -1.7% -1.2% -0.5% Nov. 30, 2015 -1.3% -2.2% -0.5% Dec. 1, 2014 -3.7% -2.2% -0.7% Dec. 2, 2013 -0.3% -0.7% -0.3% Nov. 26, 2012 +1.6% -1.0% -0.2% Nov. 28, 2011 +6.4% +3.4% +2.9% Nov. 29, 2010 +1.1% -0.9% -0.1% Nov. 30, 2009 +3.2% -1.2% +0.4% Dec. 1, 2008 -5.2% -10.0% -8.9% Nov. 26, 2007 -0.2% -2.4% -2.3% Nov. 27, 2006 -3.7% -1.9% -1.4% Nov. 28, 2005 +0.6% N/A -0.9% FactSet\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n11-28-16 1611ET\n ",

      "text": "Victor Oliveira, director of engineering for Concrete Solutions, a Rio de Janeiro consultancy, poses for a selfie with the huge arch at the conference’s entrance. (Dan Richman/GeekWire photos) LAS VEGAS — Easier-to-understand pricing. Best practices. GovCloud enhancements.\nThose are some of the topics the roughly 28,000 people pouring into the Venetian, Encore and Mirage hotels want to learn more about here at re:Invent , the fifth annual Amazon Web Services conference, which is getting underway with preliminary activities today.\nMany of those attending have stood in long lines first to register and then to pick up their swag, which includes a sweatshirt and an Amazon Echo Dot. People are having fun taking selfies in front of a 40-foot wide, 15-foot tall swirling lighted archway near the 10,000-seat theatre where the keynote addresses will take place.\nConference-goers began gathering here as early as Sunday night, though the main proceedings don’t start until Wednesday. Earlybirds are here to take full-day educational bootcamps and workshops on various AWS topics Monday and Tuesday. Live-streamed keynotes by AWS CEO Andy Jassy and CTO Werner Vogels will take place Wednesday and Thursday mornings, respectively.\nAbiade Adedoyin, a senior manager in Expedia’s finance division who works with the company’s cloud team, said she came in from near Seattle to better understand the costs of migrating to and using the cloud. “It’s a little tricky to understand where the costs are coming from, so to the extent AWS can provide simpler visibility into the costs, it would be very beneficial,” she said.\nA conference-goer at re:Invent 2016 stops to inspect the lighted archway. Daniel Tzidony, operations team leader at Earnix, a maker of financial-services software, flew in from Israel to learn more about best practices. Earnix already has most of its production loads on AWS, and “even though we’re very happy with the current state of AWS, we’d always like to have more managed services so we can offload our technical teams,” he said.\nMatt Worsham, AWS’s enterprise support lead for commercial cloud services, works closely with U.S. Government agencies and said many of them, including the CIA, are at the conference “to learn more about when some of the services we offer commercially are going to be available in GovCloud,” a specially isolated region for sensitive data and regulated workloads.\nPaul Ortiz, a solutions architect at business-process outsourcing firm Informatix in Sacramento, said he’s seeking to learn how to move from a “substantial” on-premises computing load into the cloud. “We’re downsizing our computer room and moving all that infrastructure into AWS, plus all our development now is in AWS,” he said. He said he wants to learn more about GovCloud and how to best serve public agencies.\nDuring the conference, AWS is likely to debut a new, easier-to-manage version of the popular PostgreSQL database for its cloud customers. It’s anticipated that AWS will take the open-source PostgreSQL database, which already runs on its cloud service, and then produce its own version to offer as a managed service, available to rent by the hour. As Fortune noted , AWS did the same thing with MySQL, another popular open-source database, when it released Aurora . AWS claims Aurora has been its fastest-growing service.\nAWS is also likely planning to announce new Alexa-like machine-learning tools for developers. And there could be announcements about a new, more flexible option for of Amazon’s basic cloud computing service, Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), that lets customers add or delete memory or processor cores to fit their needs.\nA report that AWS will unveil a video-conference product, possibly based on technology acquired when it bought Biba Systems, now seems unlikely. An AWS spokesperson declined to comment on any products to be announced.",

      "text": "November 28, 2016 Genevieve Angelson ’08 (Photo by Ramona Rosales) \nSeason one of Amazon ’s period drama, Good Girls Revolt , premiered in October 2016 and the show’s star is Genevieve Angelson ’08. \nGood Girls Revolt is based on the book by Lynn Povich P’08. Povich is an award-winning journalist who wrote about her early career at Newsweek. She was one of 46 women who sued the magazine for sex discrimination in 1970. After the lawsuit, Newsweek agreed to provide equal employment opportunities to women, and Povich went on to become the first female senior editor in Newsweek ’s history. \nAngelson, who was a film studies major, attended Wesleyan with Povich’s daughter, Sarah Shephard ’03. She read the book when it was published, and she even knew a few of the women involved in the lawsuit. In what she describes as “completely serendipitous,” Angelson was given the script and an audition for a role in the series. \nShe described an intense attachment to the script and the story. “When I saw what it was based on, I wanted it so much,” she explained. “I thought if someone else gets [the part], it’s not going to mean as much to her.” \nShe recalled being so thankful to the production and writing teams for wanting to tell the story of the female employees who changed the workplace for women everywhere. During her audition, she said, “Cast me, or don’t cast me in this part. Cast the right person, whoever that is, but please take this pilot and make it into a series. I’m a part of a generation of women who need this kind of story to be told.” \nAngelson indeed landed the part of Patti Robinson, a brilliant researcher who wants to be treated equally with the male journalists in the newsroom. \nHowever, when Angelson first arrived at Wesleyan, she did not set out to be an actress. She chose Wesleyan for the liberal arts education she would receive and for the student body she would be a part of. Then, during her junior year, she worked at a production firm in Hollywood, an experience that helped her see the options she had to work in the film business if she didn’t pursue acting. She said, “I was good at it, but I wasn’t fulfilled in my soul. That’s when I made the decision to train to become an actress.” \nAfter Wesleyan, Angelson went on to graduate from New York University’s Tisch School of the Arts master’s program. From there, she landed television roles on series such as Fox’s Backstrom , where she played the lead role of Detective Sergeant Nicole Gravely, and Showtime’s House of Lies , where she played the role of Caitlyn Hobart.

      "text": "By Barbara Kollmeyer and Tonya Garcia, MarketWatch\nMobile devices are a popular way to shop this holiday season\nCyber Monday is expected to bring in $3.36 billion in online sales, up 9.4% from last year, according to the latest figures from Adobe, but retailers will reach that final tally with help from deep discounting.\nSales between midnight and 10am ET total $540 million, according to Adobe. Mobile shopping, a standout so far this holiday shopping weekend, has accounted for $205 million.\nTop-selling electronics items so far this morning are the Sony (6758.TO) PS4, Samsung (005930.SE) brand 4K televisions, Apple (AAPL) iPads, and Amazon Fire. Toys like Mattel Inc.'s (MAT) Barbie and Lego sets are also doing well.\n\"Cyber Monday is on track to hit our prediction of $3.36 billion and could retain its position as the top online shopping day of the season, but only if retailers continue to push as good of deals today as they have over the holiday weekend,\" said Becky Tasker, managing analyst at Adobe Digital Insights, in a press statement.\nAmazon.com Inc. (AMZN) is offering the greatest average discount, according to data from Clavis Insight, with shoppers saving an average of 43% across Cyber Monday promotions compared with 36% at Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) , 23% at Target Corp. (TGT) and 32% at Best Buy Co. Inc. (BBY)\nOnline sales tallied more than $1 billion on Thanksgiving Day alone, according to data from Adobe, which analyzed numbers from 21 billion visits to retail websites (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/us-online-sales-tally-more-than-1-billion-on-thanksgiving-day-2016-11-25).\nAdobe is expecting overall holiday sales to grow 11% over last year.\nRead:More shopped online than in stores over Thanksgiving weekend (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/more-shopped-online-than-in-stores-over-thanksgiving-weekend-2016-11-27) (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/more-shopped-online-than-in-stores-over-thanksgiving-weekend-2016-11-27)\nDialing for deals\nThe NRF predicted that for this Cyber Monday, more than 28 million people, or 23% of all those shoppers, will hunt for deals from mobile devices, just about even with last year's 29.6 million. More than eight in 10 -- 98.6 million people -- will shop via home computers, and another 11.2 million will sneak in some deals from work computers, said the NRF.\nThe most popular times to hunt for deals will fall in the early hours, with 38.9% expected to shop first thing, followed by the 33.9% expected to shop late morning, 16% over lunch and 31% in early afternoon.\nRead:Five tips for safe shopping on Cyber Monday (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/5-tips-for-safe-shopping-on-cyber-monday-2016-11-21)\nInternational Business Machines Corp. (IBM) said it expects Cyber Monday sales to grow in the double-digit percentage range this year, globally (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/online-shopping-on-black-friday-isnt-just-a-us-event-anymore--ibm-2016-11-28). The PC maker projects overall online sales for the November to December period to rise 14%, noting that Thanksgiving and Black Friday sales rose a respective 12% and 10% from the year-ago period.\nAmong those companies jumping into the deal fray, Barnes & Noble Inc. (BKS) offered up a 15% discount on entire orders for Cyber Monday (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/barnes-noble-offering-15-discount-on-entire-online-order-for-cyber-monday-2016-11-28-791857), and was offering its 7-inch Nook tablet for $49.99. Target Corp. (TGT) began offering an extra 15% off, with some restrictions, on Sunday, continuing the offer through Cyber Monday.\nMany retailers are taking promotions to extraordinary lengths in order to get their share of the Cyber Monday action. Land's End Inc. (LE) , Gap Inc. brands (GPS) Banana Republic, Gap and Old Navy, and Loft, and Ascena Retail Group Inc. (ASNA) brand, are offering 50% off entire online purchases, with Loft throwing in free shipping on all orders.\nRead:Apple's best Black Friday deals are being offered at Best Buy and Target (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/apples-best-device-deals-are-being-offered-at-best-buy-and-target-2016-11-25)\nCompetition has already been fierce this holiday season as bricks-and-mortar companies such as Wal-Mart have been beefing up e-commerce sites in a bid to take on dominant players such as Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN). The e-commerce giant started its holiday deals Nov. 1 (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/retailers-push-early-start-to-black-friday-sales-2016-11-24-114852133), promising to offer new discounts daily up to Dec. 22.\nAmazon shares are down 1.8% in Monday trading, but are up 13.5% on the year, while the S&P 500 has gained about 8% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average has gained about 10%.\n-Barbara Kollmeyer; 1559ET\n ",

      "text": "By Barbara Kollmeyer and Tonya Garcia, MarketWatch\nMobile devices are a popular way to shop this holiday season\nCyber Monday is expected to bring in $3.36 billion in online sales, up 9.4% from last year, according to the latest figures from Adobe, but retailers will reach that final tally with help from deep discounting.\nSales between midnight and 10am ET total $540 million, according to Adobe. Mobile shopping, a standout so far this holiday shopping weekend, has accounted for $205 million.\nTop-selling electronics items so far this morning are the Sony (6758.TO) PS4, Samsung (005930.SE) brand 4K televisions, Apple (AAPL) iPads, and Amazon Fire. Toys like Mattel Inc.'s (MAT) Barbie and Lego sets are also doing well.\n\"Cyber Monday is on track to hit our prediction of $3.36 billion and could retain its position as the top online shopping day of the season, but only if retailers continue to push as good of deals today as they have over the holiday weekend,\" said Becky Tasker, managing analyst at Adobe Digital Insights, in a press statement.\nAmazon.com Inc. (AMZN) is offering the greatest average discount, according to data from Clavis Insight, with shoppers saving an average of 43% across Cyber Monday promotions compared with 36% at Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) , 23% at Target Corp. (TGT) and 32% at Best Buy Co. Inc. (BBY)\nOnline sales tallied more than $1 billion on Thanksgiving Day alone, according to data from Adobe, which analyzed numbers from 21 billion visits to retail websites (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/us-online-sales-tally-more-than-1-billion-on-thanksgiving-day-2016-11-25).\nAdobe is expecting overall holiday sales to grow 11% over last year.\nRead:More shopped online than in stores over Thanksgiving weekend (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/more-shopped-online-than-in-stores-over-thanksgiving-weekend-2016-11-27) (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/more-shopped-online-than-in-stores-over-thanksgiving-weekend-2016-11-27)\nDialing for deals\nThe NRF predicted that for this Cyber Monday, more than 28 million people, or 23% of all those shoppers, will hunt for deals from mobile devices, just about even with last year's 29.6 million. More than eight in 10 -- 98.6 million people -- will shop via home computers, and another 11.2 million will sneak in some deals from work computers, said the NRF.\nThe most popular times to hunt for deals will fall in the early hours, with 38.9% expected to shop first thing, followed by the 33.9% expected to shop late morning, 16% over lunch and 31% in early afternoon.\nRead:Five tips for safe shopping on Cyber Monday (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/5-tips-for-safe-shopping-on-cyber-monday-2016-11-21)\nInternational Business Machines Corp. (IBM) said it expects Cyber Monday sales to grow in the double-digit percentage range this year, globally (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/online-shopping-on-black-friday-isnt-just-a-us-event-anymore--ibm-2016-11-28). The PC maker projects overall online sales for the November to December period to rise 14%, noting that Thanksgiving and Black Friday sales rose a respective 12% and 10% from the year-ago period.\nAmong those companies jumping into the deal fray, Barnes & Noble Inc. (BKS) offered up a 15% discount on entire orders for Cyber Monday (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/barnes-noble-offering-15-discount-on-entire-online-order-for-cyber-monday-2016-11-28-791857), and was offering its 7-inch Nook tablet for $49.99. Target Corp. (TGT) began offering an extra 15% off, with some restrictions, on Sunday, continuing the offer through Cyber Monday.\nMany retailers are taking promotions to extraordinary lengths in order to get their share of the Cyber Monday action. Land's End Inc. (LE) , Gap Inc. brands (GPS) Banana Republic, Gap and Old Navy, and Loft, and Ascena Retail Group Inc. (ASNA) brand, are offering 50% off entire online purchases, with Loft throwing in free shipping on all orders.\nRead:Apple's best Black Friday deals are being offered at Best Buy and Target (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/apples-best-device-deals-are-being-offered-at-best-buy-and-target-2016-11-25)\nCompetition has already been fierce this holiday season as bricks-and-mortar companies such as Wal-Mart have been beefing up e-commerce sites in a bid to take on dominant players such as Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN). The e-commerce giant started its holiday deals Nov. 1 (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/retailers-push-early-start-to-black-friday-sales-2016-11-24-114852133), promising to offer new discounts daily up to Dec. 22.\nAmazon shares are down 1.8% in Monday trading, but are up 13.5% on the year, while the S&P 500 has gained about 8% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average has gained about 10%.\n-Barbara Kollmeyer; 1435ET\n ",

      "text": "By Tomi Kilgore, MarketWatch\nShares have fallen on most Cyber Mondays, while retail sector ETF has almost always declined\nAmazon.com Inc.'s stock dropped Monday, which should come as no surprise to investors despite reports of a big jump in sales during the busiest online shopping day of the year.\nCyber Monday is a phrase that Shop.org coined in 2005, in an effort to create a Black Friday-like buzz for online retailers on the first Monday after Thanksgiving. Although Cyber Monday is no longer a one-day event for many retailers (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/sears-cyber-monday-sales-to-start-a-day-early-last-a-day-longer-2016-11-22), it is still on track to retain its position as the top online shopping day (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/cyber-monday-expected-to-entice-122-million-americans-to-pounce-on-deals-2016-11-28), according to Adobe Digital Insights.\nAmazon's stock (AMZN) shed 1.4% in midday trade. On the past 11 Cyber Mondays, the stock had declined six times, including the past three years in a row. The biggest one-day percentage decline was 5.2% on Dec. 1, 2008, in the midst of the financial crisis, while the biggest gain was 6.4% on Nov. 28, 2011. See table of Cyber Monday moves below.\n(https://sw.graphiq.com/w/3DsaIrDmlil)\nThe median one-day move has been a 0.2% decline, while the average move a slip of about 0.1%.\nMeanwhile, the selloff in the broader retail sector is almost exactly what history suggests should happen. The SPDR S&P Retail exchange-traded fund (XRT) slumped 1%, after falling on nine of the previous 10 Cyber Mondays since the ETF's inception in June 2006. The median decline on down days was 1.9%, while the average drop was 2.5%.\nIn comparison, the S&P 500 index eased 0.3% on Monday, after falling on nine of the previous 11 Cyber Mondays.\nDon't miss:5 tips for safe shopping on Cyber Monday (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/5-tips-for-safe-shopping-on-cyber-monday-2016-11-21).\nSee also: Black Friday and Thanksgiving online shopping surpasses $5 billion for the first time (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/black-friday-online-shopping-surpasses-3-billion-for-the-first-time-2016-11-25).\n-Tomi Kilgore; 415-439-6400; AskNewswires@dowjones.com\nCyber Monday one-day percentage moves Date Amazon's stock (AMZN) SPDR Retail ETF (XRT) S&P 500 (SPX) Nov. 28, 2016 -1.4% (midday) -1.0% (midday) -0.3% (midday) Nov. 30, 2015 -1.3% -2.2% -0.5% Dec. 1, 2014 -3.7% -2.2% -0.7% Dec. 2, 2013 -0.3% -0.7% -0.3% Nov. 26, 2012 +1.6% -1.0% -0.2% Nov. 28, 2011 +6.4% +3.4% +2.9% Nov. 29, 2010 +1.1% -0.9% -0.1% Nov. 30, 2009 +3.2% -1.2% +0.4% Dec. 1, 2008 -5.2% -10.0% -8.9% Nov. 26, 2007 -0.2% -2.4% -2.3% Nov. 27, 2006 -3.7% -1.9% -1.4% Nov. 28, 2005 +0.6% N/A -0.9% FactSet\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n11-28-16 1400ET\n ",

      "text": "By Barbara Kollmeyer and Tonya Garcia, MarketWatch\nMobile devices are a popular way to shop this holiday season\nCyber Monday is expected to bring in $3.36 billion in online sales, up 9.4% from last year, according to the latest figures from Adobe, but retailers will reach that final tally with help from deep discounting.\nSales between midnight and 10am ET total $540 million, according to Adobe. Mobile shopping, a standout so far this holiday shopping weekend, has accounted for $205 million.\nTop-selling electronics items so far this morning are the Sony (6758.TO) PS4, Samsung (005930.SE) brand 4K televisions, Apple (AAPL) iPads, and Amazon Fire. Toys like Mattel Inc.'s (MAT) Barbie and Lego sets are also doing well.\n\"Cyber Monday is on track to hit our prediction of $3.36 billion and could retain its position as the top online shopping day of the season, but only if retailers continue to push as good of deals today as they have over the holiday weekend,\" said Becky Tasker, managing analyst at Adobe Digital Insights, in a press statement.\nAmazon.com Inc. (AMZN) is offering the greatest average discount, according to data from Clavis Insight, with shoppers saving an average of 43% across Cyber Monday promotions compared with 36% at Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) , 23% at Target Corp. (TGT) and 32% at Best Buy Co. Inc. (BBY)\nOnline sales tallied more than $1 billion on Thanksgiving Day alone, according to data from Adobe, which analyzed numbers from 21 billion visits to retail websites (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/us-online-sales-tally-more-than-1-billion-on-thanksgiving-day-2016-11-25).\nAdobe is expecting overall holiday sales to grow 11% over last year.\nRead:More shopped online than in stores over Thanksgiving weekend (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/more-shopped-online-than-in-stores-over-thanksgiving-weekend-2016-11-27) (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/more-shopped-online-than-in-stores-over-thanksgiving-weekend-2016-11-27)\nDialing for deals\nThe NRF predicted that for this Cyber Monday, more than 28 million people, or 23% of all those shoppers, will hunt for deals from mobile devices, just about even with last year's 29.6 million. More than eight in 10 -- 98.6 million people -- will shop via home computers, and another 11.2 million will sneak in some deals from work computers, said the NRF.\nThe most popular times to hunt for deals will fall in the early hours, with 38.9% expected to shop first thing, followed by the 33.9% expected to shop late morning, 16% over lunch and 31% in early afternoon.\nRead:Five tips for safe shopping on Cyber Monday (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/5-tips-for-safe-shopping-on-cyber-monday-2016-11-21)\nInternational Business Machines Corp. (IBM) said it expects Cyber Monday sales to grow in the double-digit percentage range this year, globally (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/online-shopping-on-black-friday-isnt-just-a-us-event-anymore--ibm-2016-11-28). The PC maker projects overall online sales for the November to December period to rise 14%, noting that Thanksgiving and Black Friday sales rose a respective 12% and 10% from the year-ago period.\nAmong those companies jumping into the deal fray, Barnes & Noble Inc. (BKS) offered up a 15% discount on entire orders for Cyber Monday (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/barnes-noble-offering-15-discount-on-entire-online-order-for-cyber-monday-2016-11-28-791857), and was offering its 7-inch Nook tablet for $49.99. Target Corp. (TGT) began offering an extra 15% off, with some restrictions, on Sunday, continuing the offer through Cyber Monday.\nMany retailers are taking promotions to extraordinary lengths in order to get their share of the Cyber Monday action. Land's End Inc. (LE) , Gap Inc. brands (GPS) Banana Republic, Gap and Old Navy, and Loft, and Ascena Retail Group Inc. (ASNA) brand, are offering 50% off entire online purchases, with Loft throwing in free shipping on all orders.\nRead:Apple's best Black Friday deals are being offered at Best Buy and Target (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/apples-best-device-deals-are-being-offered-at-best-buy-and-target-2016-11-25)\nCompetition has already been fierce this holiday season as bricks-and-mortar companies such as Wal-Mart have been beefing up e-commerce sites in a bid to take on dominant players such as Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN). The e-commerce giant started its holiday deals Nov. 1 (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/retailers-push-early-start-to-black-friday-sales-2016-11-24-114852133), promising to offer new discounts daily up to Dec. 22.\nAmazon shares closed down 1.7% on Monday, but are up 13.5% on the year, while the S&P 500 has gained 7.7% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average has gained about 10%.\n-Barbara Kollmeyer; 1627ET\n ",

      "text": "Google’s Waze Adds Voice Support For Amazon’s The Grand Tour   Dominik Bosnjak \nCross-promotions are an established practice in the marketing industry and these days, brands are as likely to mutually promote each other as they’ve ever been. This trend isn’t hard to explain as cross-promotions have been proven to work time and time again. That’s especially true when businesses are looking to increase brand awareness and aren’t just marketing specific products. The latest collaboration between Google and Amazon is better described as the former than the latter, but that doesn’t mean these two tech giants didn’t get creative. \nNamely, as of today, the Google-owned navigation app Waze features voice support for Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond, and James May, stars of Amazon’s latest Prime Video show ‘The Grand Tour’. More specifically, Waze users can now opt to have the famous trio guide them through the busy streets of their home cities with the goal of evading as many traffic jams as possible. As anyone who has ever used the mobile app already knows, efficient navigation is pretty much the main idea behind Waze. Unlike many of its competitors, Waze prides itself on the plethora of different language options. Speaking of which, this cross-promotion certainly isn’t the first of its kind that Waze has debuted. Earlier this year, the Google-owned app featured the voice of Morgan Freeman who was promoting his latest blockbuster ‘London Has Fallen’. In recent years, the likes of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Kevin Hart have also lent their voices to the popular service. \nJust like it was the case with all other cross-promotions of this kind, the voices of Clarkson, Hammond, and May will only be available in Waze for a limited time, with the deal between Google and Amazon set to last until February 5th. While the official announcement on the Waze Blog makes no mention of limited availability, it does seem as though the cross-promotion isn’t available in all territories. From the looks of it, the voices of Clarkson, Hammond, and May are only available to Waze users in countries that residents can subscribe to Amazon Prime Video. To find out whether you’re eligible to listen to this trio guide you through traffic, download the latest version of Waze, open it, go to Settings, and select Voice Language under the Sound menu. On the next screen, try to find the “(US) Clarkson, Hammond & May” option – which should be located near the top of the list.",

      "text": "One of the upsides from purchasing from retailers like Amazon is that for the most part, you can rest assured that what you’re buying is the real deal. After all many companies understand that their reputation is important, so having customers trust them is clearly a big deal. Unfortunately sometimes fakes do slip through the cracks, as Apple has previously warned . Now it seems that according to a report from Bloomberg , Amazon is looking to get serious about counterfeit products being sold on their platform and that will be one of their main goals for 2017. While Amazon has yet to confirm, Bloomberg claims that their sources have told them that Amazon has been building teams in the US and Europe and are working with major brands to create a registry of recognized sellers.\nWe’re not sure how this will work out, but we can only imagine it will be similar to verified accounts on Twitter, or in Amazon’s case it would verify that this seller is a seller of genuine products. In a statement made to Bloomberg, Amazon said, “Amazon has zero tolerance for the sale of counterfeit items on our site.”\nAmazon is also said to have been trialing this new registry with brands such as Nike, where resellers are expected to prove that they have the permission to sell the products of the company they claim to represent.\nFiled in",

      "text": "Peter Wynn Thompson/AP Images for Amazon \nAn Amazon employee reportedly sent an email to hundreds of co-workers before jumping off a 12-story building at its Seattle headquarters on Monday, Bloomberg first reported.\nSeattle Police told Business Insider that it responded to the call of an attempted suicide at 8:45 a.m. PT on Monday morning and transported the person to Harborview Medical Center. The man survived the fall and was injured in the incident. The hospital couldn't be reached late Monday for an update on the man's condition.\n“Our thoughts are with our colleague as he continues to recover,\" Amazon said in a statement to Business Insider. \"He’s receiving some of the best care possible and we will be there to support him throughout the recovery process.” \nThe man's identity and role at Amazon have not been released publicly.\nAccording to a Bloomberg report, the employee had sent an email shortly before to hundreds of employees, including Amazon's CEO Jeff Bezos, and had recently put in a request to transfer to a different department. Instead, the person was placed on an employee improvement plan, which can lead to termination, according to Bloomberg , which cited persons \"familiar with the matter.\" Amazon declined to comment further on Monday's incident.\nIf you or someone you know are having suicidal thoughts, call the U.S. National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 800-273-8255. \n",

      "text": "© 2016 Time Inc. All rights reserved. Here’s What Happens at Amazon on Cyber Monday \nAmazon is poised to shatter yet another sales record thanks to the millions of Americans shopping online this Cyber Monday. \nThe Seattle-based ecommerce giant is encouraged by the strong sales it saw on Thanksgiving and Black Friday, said Doug Herrington, Amazon’s senior vice president for North American retail, in an interview with Fortune on Monday. \nThough Amazon won’t disclose actual sales figures, it’s said to have generated about 36% of all online sales during last year’s Cyber Monday. \nCyber Monday sales as a whole are expected to hit a record $3.36 billion this year , up more than 9% from last year. Related: Here Are the Best Apple Cyber Monday Deals \nSome of the top-selling products on Amazon.com include e-readers, TVs, and toys, says Herrington. And more and more of those purchases are being made on a smartphone. Last holiday season, more than 70% of Amazon’s customers shopped using a mobile device. That number is expected to climb. \nInside Amazon’s massive New Jersey fulfillment center, the energy is electric. The facility is the size of 28 football fields and houses more than 4,000 employees who package and ship the millions of products ordered during Cyber Monday. Amazon has hired more than 120,000 seasonal employees nationwide just to keep up with demand on its busiest time of year. Related: Shipping Giant Moves Into Amazon’s Cloud \nAnd what happens when the 2016 holiday season is over? The hustle at the fulfilment center never ends, Herrington says. “Right after this holiday finishes, we start getting ready for the next one. It’s a big process. It takes all year.”",

      "text": "Amazon Worker Jumps Off Company Building After E-Mail Note Spencer Soper November 28, 2016 — 6:02 PM EST November 28, 2016 — 7:48 PM EST \nAn Amazon.com Inc. employee was injured when he leaped off a building at the company’s Seattle headquarters in what police characterized as a suicide attempt. \nThe man, who wasn’t identified by authorities, sent an e-mail visible to hundreds of co-workers, including Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos, before the incident occurred, according to a person familiar with the matter. The man survived the fall from Amazon’s 12-story Apollo building at about 8:45 a.m. local time Monday and was taken to a Seattle hospital, police said. \nThe man had recently put in a request to transfer to a different department, but was placed on an employee improvement plan, a step that can lead to termination if performance isn’t improved, said the person, who asked not to be identified discussing company personnel matters. More than 20,000 people work in multiple buildings at Amazon’s headquarters. \n“Our thoughts are with our colleague as he continues to recover,” Amazon said in a statement. “He’s receiving some of the best care possible and we will be there to support him throughout the recovery process.” \nIn the e-mail, the man expressed criticism of how the company handled his transfer request, and he hinted that he might harm himself, according to the person. \nSuicide was the 10th-leading cause of death in the U.S. in 2013, with 41,149 people taking their own lives that year, for a rate of 12.6 per 100,000, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \nThe online retailer has taken steps to soften its image as a difficult employer since a New York Times story last year portrayed the company as a bruising workplace where employees were encouraged to take advantage of one another to get ahead. Amazon disputed the characterization of the company. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.",

      "text": "© 2016 Time Inc. All rights reserved. Why Amazon’s Shares Are Slumping Despite Record Cyber Monday Sales \nAmazon.com has dozens of deals on items this Cyber Monday. You could pick up a Fire tablet for just $33.33 or the Echo Dot for $39.99 Also on sale this Cyber Monday, it seems: Amazon’s shares. \nShares of the online retailer slipped $12, or 1.5%, to $768 on Monday. The stock is now down nearly $80 from its recent high of $847 less than two months ago. The drop in shares of Amazon amzn come as analysts are saying that this Cyber Monday is expected to be the biggest ever , hitting a record $3.3 billion in sales, up nearly 10% from a year ago. \nSo what gives? \nWell, while near 10% growth sounds good, and would be great for a giant traditional retailer like Walmart wmt , it would actually be relatively slow for Amazon. Sales at the online retailer are expected to rise 25% in the fourth quarter from a year ago. The expectation of huge sales growth is built into Amazon’s enormous stock market valuation of $365 billion, or 176 times its last 12 months of earnings. So a 10% jump would actually be a big disappointment. \nIn the past year, giant retailers, Walmart in particular, have put more and more emphasis on growing their online sales. Walmart and Target tgt this year offered bigger discounts on Black Friday and Cyber Monday to combat Amazon. Research firm Market Track, based on holiday circulars, found that Walmart was offering an average discount of 39% this year, up from 35% last year. Target is offering average discounts of 38% during the post-Thanksgiving shopping spree, vs. 36% a year ago. \nThis is forcing Amazon to match as well. It says it is offering deals on 75,000 items on its website this week . And this comes at a time when investors are betting that Amazon will be able to turn its massive sales into profit, as much as $4.8 billion this year, and $6.9 billion next. \nThe good news is that the fastest growing portion of its business, web services, is not as dependent on Cyber Monday traffic, or at least traffic directly to Amazon. Still that only makes up about 10% of Amazon’s total business. And if the company increasingly finds itself in even more of an online price war than its already in, investors may not be getting much of a discount on the company’s shares at all.",

By: Anushree Bhattacharyya | New Delhi |  32 AM \nAfter witnessing drop in sales post-demonetisation due to curbs on cash-on-delivery orders, online retailers are providing various deals and discounts if consumers pay through digital channels. \nFlipkart , for example is offering up to 20% off on electronic products bought through any debit/credit card. It has also launched cashback offers on its mobile wallet, PhonePe. A Flipkart spokesperson said, “Electronic payment on the platform has risen by 50% after demonetisation kicked in”. \nAccording to industry estimates, in October close to 10 lakh orders were dispatched every day by e-tailers. Post the move the number of orders shipped have dropped to 5-6 lakh per day. \nAmazon India is running a ‘cashless offer’, under which it is selling gift cards worth R500, R1,000 and R2,000. Consumers who buy any product on the site through the gift card, can avail up to 15% discount. \n“Amazon India has seen a 10 times increase in payment through card-on-delivery, post the announcement,” Gopal Pillai, director and GM, seller services, Amazon India, told FE. He added that customers have already started buying the gift cards to shop on the platform. \nSimilarly, Myntra and Jabong — the two fashion and lifestyle portals owned by Flipkart — are running various prepaid offers. For example, Jabong is giving 25% discount on minimum purchase of R999 if goods are bought via an Axis Bank card, HDFC Bank card, SBI card or ICICI Bank debit/credit card. It is also offering 10% instant cashback to MobiKwik wallet users. \nLikewise ShopClues, which has seen an overall decline of 7-8% in its sales post November 8, is offering 10% discount on all prepaid orders. It is also now allowing consumers who order under CoD to avail 2% cash back via CluesBucks. \nSanjay Sethi, CEO, ShopClues, said, “Before the announcement, 30% of the orders were placed under CoD, which is now dropped to 15%.”  ",

      "text": "© 2016 Time Inc. All rights reserved. Amazon Is Already Boasting Its Best Cyber Monday Ever \nAmazon is on track to have its best Cyber Monday in history in terms of sales, the company said Monday. Of course, in typical Amazon AMZN fashion, the Seattle company did not release any sales figures to back up its claim. \nCyber Monday is expected to hit record online sales of $3.3 billion in the U.S., a figure that’s up nearly 10% from last year. \nAmazon didn’t release much data on what is selling well, but the company did report its best-selling item on Thanksgiving, Black Friday, and Cyber Monday so far is the Echo Dot, the company’s internet-connected home automation device. Get Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter. \nOne possible reason for the increased sales could be mobile shopping. Orders through the company’s Amazon’s iPhone and Android app are on pace to surpass app orders compared to Cyber Monday last year. The company also said that Thanksgiving Day became one of its busiest mobile shopping days in history. \nDespite these optimistic reports, Amazon’s stock still dropped just under 2% in trading on Monday. According to Marketwatch, Amazon’s stock has dropped six out of the past 11 Cyber Mondays. \nHoliday season consumers have been spending record amounts online this year, especially on mobile phones. But it’s not just e-commerce only companies that are seeing strong levels of spending. Target TGT also reported record online sales for Thanksgiving, as did Kohls.",

Working directly with the Ticketmaster team and their data feeds will simplify the purchase experience and deepen our understanding of how recommendations drive sales. \nWe’ll continue partnering with Songkick for concerts that aren’t being sold via Ticketmaster. Through Songkick’s comprehensive database of shows, we’ll ensure that every date — no matter who you ticket through — is listed and can be recommended to fans around the world.",

A tangled web of over 3,000 humans, machines, and complex logistical software, each of these warehouses operate with almost seamless precision to get packages to your door in two days or less in most cases. \nI’ve lived most of my adult life assuming this was magic, but a 360-degree video from Cnet gives us an inside look at how it all goes down. \nThe process starts with Kiva robots that bring shelves to employees. Each of these shelves is equipped with a screen that tells employees what to grab. Once ready, the order travels in a yellow bin down a conveyor belt to waiting employees. Upon arrival, Amazon employees pack each item to get it ready for shipping. From there, the order travels down yet another conveyor belt to a robot scanner that ensures the packing label has the correct address. Finally, the box gets put on one last conveyor belt where it’s sent to an area for items awaiting shipping. \nSeriously, logistics on this level are mind-blowing, but Amazon makes it seem so easy.",

      "text": "News \nThere aren't many options for rugged, outdoorsy smartwatches on the market; Casio's horribly named WSD-F10 is one of them. Though this Android Wear-powered smartwatch wasn't very well-received initially due to its $500 price tag, it's now been discounted to $399.99 - a 20% drop. \nThis Casio actually contains many features that standard ones like the Moto 360 and Huawei Watch just don't have. For instance, it features a two LCDs - one low-power one for when you just want to check the time, and one for when you want to use smartwatch functions. It also has tools such as an altimeter, a barometer, and more to assist you when you're hiking. It's also worth noting that it is legitimately stronger than other Android Wear offerings; it's rated for MIL-STD-810G compliance, as well as 50m water resistance. Most other smartwatches' IP67 ratings pale in comparison to this. \nIf you're a regular Ron Swanson (well, except that you like technology) and you'd like to pick one of these bad boys up, Amazon has discounted all three colors (orange, black, and an Amazon-exclusive red) to $399.99. Two-day shipping and returns are free with Prime. We're not sure if this is a Cyber Monday-only deal, so if you're interested, you probably shouldn't wait too long to hit the \"Place your order\" button. Source:",

      "title": "Amazon: Everyday Deals Make Black Friday Less Important, Says SunTrust",
      "text": "By Tiernan Ray As mentioned earlier , Amazon ( AMZN ) is getting some positive feedback today with regards to the holiday shopping season, including Black Friday , but one Wall Street observer thinks you shouldn’t put too much into the holiday numbers.\nRobert Peck of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey , who has a Hold rating on Amazon shares, notes both that discount shopping today, the so-called Cyber Monday shopping frenzy, are above plan, and that it doesn’t matter as much as in prior years.\nFirst, the numbers:\nAdobe predicted Cyber Monday online sales of ~$3.4B, or ~9% YoY growth. However, in the past 3 years, Cyber Monday online sales have grown at ~16%. If online sales grow at the same pace as the past 3 years, Cyber Monday sales could be ~$3.6B, or ~$190M ahead of Adobe’s estimate. \nDespite that upside in Cyber Monday, Amazon and other retailers have been offering so many online deals on a regular basis, in advance of Black Friday, that the shopping event may no longer mean as much:\nIn a recent article, the New York Times highlighted how extended online promotions around Black Friday and the emergence of Millennials (~40% of whom do all or most of their shopping online) is “reshaping one of the country’s biggest shopping days.” Consequently, it is not surprising that Black Friday is becoming “less and less important for the industry over all.” Per a Bankrate (RATE, $11.00, Hold, Andrew Jeffrey) survey, just 23% of adults plan to shop in stores on Black Friday, down from 28% two years ago. Black Friday accounted for 6% of sales during the holiday season a decade ago; this year, it is expected to be only 4.3% per Customer Growth Partners. \nAs far as Amazon, though published estimates for the holiday weekend do tend to support his outlook for Amazon:\nAs we discussed (link), comScore expects 16-19% YoY growth on online sales during the holiday season, which is in line with estimates from other industry commentators, and represents an acceleration from ~11% in 2015 [...] Looking at 4Q estimates, we believe the comScore estimate supports Street expectations for Amazon of 23-24% growth in North America, or 5-7% upside. Note, Prime momentum remains a positive while increasing 3P sales for Amazon (now 50% of units) is a headwind for top line growth. \nAmazon shares today are down $11.57, or 1.5%, at $768.80.",

      "text": "Amazon Gets Real About Fake Products on Its Marketplace Spencer Soper Nov 28, 2016 8:06 pm ET (Bloomberg) -- Randy Hetrick first noticed counterfeits on Amazon.com Inc. in 2013. He had been selling his TRX Training System-- an exercise kit of suspension straps-- on the site since 2008. When he began noticing cheap imitations, he had his employees scour Amazon for more, then go through the tedious process of reporting them for removal. But new imposters would pop up right away, and by 2014, \"We realized this was an epidemic,\" said Hetrick, who estimates phonies cost him $100 million a year, twice his annual sales. Amazon's Marketplace gives inventors like Hetrick exposure to hundreds of millions of shoppers without the big expense of building and promoting a website from scratch. Merchants give Amazon a commission on each sale. But a hot-selling product on Amazon encourages counterfeiters to make flimsy knockoffs with cheap materials, steal sales and damage a brand with few consequences. Amazon has known the problem is getting worse, according to a source familiar with the matter, but for years, the company has been largely silent about the flourishing fakes. That has frustrated manufacturers and brand owners who bear the cost and responsibility of policing the site, reporting problems and hoping Amazon takes action. It's the subject of the latest episode of the Decrypted podcast (subscribe here on iTunes). SoundCloud: The Fake Reviews and Counterfeits That Amazon's Trying to Quash by Bloomberg Now, the world's biggest online retailer is getting serious. It has made fighting phonies a major goal for 2017, building teams in the U.S. and Europe to work with major brands on a registry to prevent fakes, according to a person familiar with the initiative, who was not authorized to speak about the matter and requested anonymity. Discussions with Major League Baseball and the National Football League about selling merchandise on Amazon hit a standstill earlier this year due to concerns about Amazon's lack of control over fakes, the person said. “Amazon has zero tolerance for the sale of counterfeit items on our site,\" Amazon said in a statement. The company said it was \"aggressively pursuing bad actors.\" In a statement, the MLB said: “It is our responsibility to provide our fans with reliable and secure marketplaces to purchase officially licensed merchandise. Given the rampant growth of online-only retailers supplying counterfeit merchandise, our policies must hold every distribution partner to that same level of commitment.” The NFL declined to comment. The new Amazon teams will encourage brands -- even those that don't sell on Amazon -- to register with the online store, the person said. Once registered, Amazon requires any marketplace merchants listing those products to prove that they have the brand's permission to sell them online. Amazon began experimenting with the registry earlier this year with Nike and other companies. The bigger push in 2017 will target thousands of large companies, including those that have been reluctant to sell on Amazon because of knock-offs. In addition, this month Amazon teamed up with Hetrick's business to sue three people, accusing them of selling fakes on its site. It filed another similar suit the same day against an alleged counterfeit ring. Moving the battle to a courtroom is an acknowledgment that despite spending tens of millions of dollars a year and employing an army of software engineers, investigators and research scientists tasked with fighting copycats, Amazon is not winning the war against counterfeiters. \"The depressing thing about it is, brands that invest the most to innovate and create new products are the ones that lose the most because they are the ones the counterfeiters target,\" said Hetrick, who is encouraged by Amazon's new vigilance. \"You end up becoming the sales and marketing arm for these shysters selling illegal goods.\" Amazon is desperately trying to bring order to the Wild West atmosphere on its marketplace, where more than 2 million independent sellers compete for the attention and money of shoppers. About half of the goods purchased on Amazon come from independent merchants, who help Amazon expand its inventory more quickly and with less upfront cost than Amazon could do on its own. It also makes the retailer and its customers more vulnerable to fakes because the simple online registration process currently in place is designed to make it easy for businesses to begin selling immediately. But that also makes it simple for counterfeiters to list fake goods, sell as many as they can before they're detected, and then vanish. Amazon’s suits targeting sellers were the first of their kind for the company, a warning to counterfeiters heading into the busy holiday shopping season when the most is at stake. It could be too little, too late. The shift of spending from stores with tight inventory controls to online marketplaces where it's tough to distinguish between fake and authentic is fueling a rise in counterfeiting that shows no signs of slowing. Alibaba and Ebay are also grappling with copycat products. Counterfeits made up nearly $500 billion, or 2.5 percent, of global imports in 2013, a figure expected to grow as more spending shifts online, according to an April report by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. China is the biggest source of phonies. Despite efforts to decrease them, complaints about imitations on Amazon have been growing along with its inventory since at least 2014, according to a person familiar with the matter. What Amazon has known internally for years is spilling into the public eye. Birkenstock announced it would cease selling products on Amazon in January due to concerns about counterfeits. And in October, Apple Inc. sued an Amazon supplier claiming the business sold fake Apple products -- some of them unsafe -- on Amazon. \"Online counterfeiting is never going to go down,\" said Stuart Fuller, director of commercial operations at NetNames, which helps brands identify marketplaces and websites where counterfeit products are sold. \"Amazon is the most trusted marketplace in the world. That in and of itself attracts this nefarious element because they know shoppers go there and trust what they are buying is genuine.\" Bret Rosenzweig is another inventor who has felt the sting of counterfeits on Amazon. His company, DC Innovations, makes the Urban Shelf, a collapsible plastic nightstand that wedges between a mattress and box spring. Bachelors and college students are the target market, and Amazon was the perfect place to introduce the product to the masses in 2009. Once his sales on Amazon started picking up around 2015, counterfeiters took notice, mimicked the design with cheaper materials and offered it for less. That's a double-blow to Rosenzweig, who loses a sale and now has a potential customer unimpressed with his brand (or what the customer thinks is his brand). Rosenzweig checks Amazon each day, scouring the marketplace for counterfeiters selling his product. The process of reporting the fakes to Amazon has been a time-suck. He spots a knock-off, buys the item and when he receives it, he takes photos and submits a report to Amazon. The company is usually quick about suspending the counterfeiters, but new accounts quickly spring up in their place and the game of whack-a-mole continues, Rosenzweig said. He can no longer order phony items to his home address because his adversaries know he is conducting a test purchase, so he has his business partner order them. Rosenzweig said he’d welcome any new effort from Amazon to crack down. \"Buying the fakes and reporting them is a waste of my time,\" he said. Amazon, EBay and Alibaba are largely shielded from legal liability as long as they have processes in place for brands to report fake goods and take timely action to suspend their sale once notified. The online marketplaces often don’t have the inventory, so there is nothing to seize. The result is an endless loop with brands buying and reporting fakes, marketplaces suspending accounts, and the fraudsters creating new accounts to hawk the same fake goods under new pseudonyms. EBay lets registered brand owners report suspected counterfeit listings for removal, as does Alibaba. But the retailers can only do so much. Shoppers worried about buying fakes during the holidays have to bear some responsibility, said Akino Chikada, senior brand protection manager at the firm MarkMonitor, which helps brands find online sources of counterfeits. She suggests looking closely at web addresses for subtle variations from brand names and probing websites for sloppy privacy and return policies, which can signal a phony. Bargain basement prices are another tell-tale sign, though sophisticated counterfeiters try to make the price difference less suspicious by coming in at 10 or 20 percent below other offers rather than half price, she said. \"Counterfeiters do a good job mimicking the look and feel of a brand,\" she said. \"It's so easy for people, in just a few clicks, to unknowingly buy counterfeit goods.\" Want more stories like this every week?

However, Big Data and Analytics tools are not limited to large companies as products and services are emerging that are democratizing data for smaller companies. A new data economy is developing in which the data associated with corporate products and services becomes almost as value as the company offerings themselves. New models are emerging to reduce friction across the value chain including enhanced Big Data as a Service (BDaaS) offerings. BDaaS is anticipated to make cross-industry, cross-company, and even cross-competitor data exchange a reality that adds value across the ecosystem with minimized security and prvacy concerns. Key Findings: The global Big Data Market will reach $72B USD by 2021 with a CAGR of 20.8%. Western Europe will be a market leader with $20.9B USD by 2021 with CAGR of 22.2%. Business Intelligence Tools and Analytics Platforms will reach $15.8B USD globally by 2021. Professional Services remains the leading revenue area through 2021 with CAGR of 23.8%. Open development tools and communities are driving innovation in key areas such as Cloud and IoT. \nCompanies Mentioned:",

A tangled web of over 3,000 humans, machines, and complex logistical software, each of these warehouses operate with almost seamless precision to get packages to your door in two days or less in most cases. I’ve lived most of my adult life assuming this was magic, but a 360-degree video from Cnet gives us an inside look at how it all goes down. The process starts with Kiva robots that bring shelves to employees. Each of these shelves is equipped with a screen that tells employees what to grab.

      "text": "In a scene one would expect in a Chinese Foxconn factory but certainly not Seattle, Bloomberg reports that in what the police have described as a suicide attempt, an Amazon employee - one of 20,000 working at the location - was injured when he leaped off a building at the company’s Seattle headquarters. The suicide was unsuccessful and the man survived the fall from Amazon’s 12-story Apollo building at about 8:45 a.m. local time Monday and was taken to a Seattle hospital, police said.Amazon's Apollo Building at 333 Ninth Ave. N.\n\nThe man, who wasn’t identified by authorities, sent an e-mail visible to hundreds of co-workers, including Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos, before the incident occurred, according to a person familiar with the matter. In the e-mail, the man expressed criticism of how the company handled his transfer request, and he hinted that he might harm himself, according to the person.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, the man had recently put in a request to transfer to a different department, but was placed on an employee improvement plan, a step that can lead to termination if performance isn’t improved.\n\n“Our thoughts are with our colleague as he continues to recover,” Amazon said in a statement. “He’s receiving some of the best care possible and we will be there to support him throughout the recovery process.”\n\nAs Bloomberg notes, suicide is the 10th-leading cause of death in the U.S. in 2013, with 41,149 people taking their own lives that year, for a rate of 12.6 per 100,000, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It is unclear if there have been any recent, similar attempts at Jeff Bezos' company.\n\nThe online retailer has taken steps to soften its image as a difficult employer since a New York Times story last year portrayed the company as a bruising workplace where employees were encouraged to take advantage of one another to get ahead. Amazon disputed the characterization of the company.",

      "text": "  Amazon Worker Jumps Off HQ Building In Suicide Attempt Nov 28, 2016 8:53 PM 0 SHARES \nIn a scene one would expect in a Chinese Foxconn factory but certainly not Seattle, Bloomberg reports that in what the police have described as a suicide attempt, an Amazon employee - one of 20,000 working at the location - was injured when he leaped off a building at the company’s Seattle headquarters. The suicide was unsuccessful and the man survived the fall from Amazon’s 12-story Apollo building at about 8:45 a.m. local time Monday and was taken to a Seattle hospital, police said. \nAmazon's Apollo Building at 333 Ninth Ave. N. \nThe man, who wasn’t identified by authorities, sent an e-mail visible to hundreds of co-workers, including Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos, before the incident occurred, according to a person familiar with the matter. In the e-mail, the man expressed criticism of how the company handled his transfer request, and he hinted that he might harm himself, according to the person. \nAccording to Bloomberg, the man had recently put in a request to transfer to a different department, but was placed on an employee improvement plan, a step that can lead to termination if performance isn’t improved. \n“Our thoughts are with our colleague as he continues to recover,” Amazon said in a statement. “He’s receiving some of the best care possible and we will be there to support him throughout the recovery process.” \nAs Bloomberg notes, suicide is the 10th-leading cause of death in the U.S. in 2013, with 41,149 people taking their own lives that year, for a rate of 12.6 per 100,000, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It is unclear if there have been any recent, similar attempts at Jeff Bezos' company. \nThe online retailer has taken steps to soften its image as a difficult employer since a New York Times story last year portrayed the company as a bruising workplace where employees were encouraged to take advantage of one another to get ahead. Amazon disputed the characterization of the company.",

      "text": "print Peter Wynn Thompson/AP Images for Amazon \nAn Amazon employee reportedly sent an email to hundreds of co-workers before jumping off a 12-story building at its Seattle headquarters on Monday, Bloomberg first reported . \nSeattle Police told Business Insider that it responded to the call of an attempted suicide at 8:45 a.m. PT on Monday morning and transported the person to Harborview Medical Center. The man survived the fall and was injured in the incident. The hospital couldn't be reached late Monday for an update on the man's condition. \n“Our thoughts are with our colleague as he continues to recover,\" Amazon said in a statement to Business Insider. \"He’s receiving some of the best care possible and we will be there to support him throughout the recovery process.” \nThe man's identity and role at Amazon have not been released publicly. \nAccording to a Bloomberg report, the employee had sent an email shortly before to hundreds of employees, including Amazon's CEO Jeff Bezos, and had recently put in a request to transfer to a different department. Instead, the person was placed on an employee improvement plan, which can lead to termination, according to Bloomberg , which cited persons \"familiar with the matter.\" Amazon declined to comment further on Monday's incident. \nIf you or someone you know are having suicidal thoughts, call the U.S. National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 800-273-8255. Disclosure: Jeff Bezos is an investor in Business Insider through his personal investment company Bezos Expeditions.",

I’m here to keep you company each day while you’re workin’! Let’s just jump right in, shall we? Things I Love: PURPLE EVERYTHING, cinnamon gum, (even though I'm allergic) Miller Lite, (ice cold, preferably in aluminum) to laugh (loudly and often), MUSIC MUSIC MUSIC! I have a tattoo (no, that’s not my only one) of a lightning bolt on my right forearm reminding me to LIVE ELECTRIC (so I guess that's my hashtag) every day. My favorite quote (and I LOVE quotes) is \"Make Everybody Feel Like A Somebody”. I try to stick to that each day, finding the BEST in every situation (even when encountering a grumpypants) because being negative just requires too much energy! It’s easier to smile! I’ve wanted to be on the radio since I was a little girl. I would listen to my favorite stations and record music and deejays on my cassette player and then carry my tapes around with me everywhere … remember those little yellow Walkmans? Yep! Still have mine! In 2009, I was given the opportunity to work for the Big Machine Label Group. That’s the home of some of your favorites like Tim McGraw, Taylor Swift, Rascal Flatts, Brantley Gilbert, Jennifer Nettles, Justin Moore and more. The first (and only) time I got to fly on a private jet was also the same day I got to hear Taylor Swift’s “We Are Never Getting Back Together” (before it was even released)! I worked for Republic Nashville, one of the imprints at the BMLG for seven years and had a hand in launching the careers of The Band Perry, Florida-Georgia Line, A Thousand Horses, Eli Young Band, Cassadee Pope and more! It was my job to take their songs to radio stations all across the West and convince them to play their music on the air … first just a little … and then more often. If I did my job well, and everything worked the way we hoped, we climbed the charts, scored #1 records and our artists got to go on tour all across the World! Some of the songs I worked were The Band Perry’s “If I Die Young”, “All Your Life”, “Better Dig Two”, “Done” … Florida-Georgia Line’s “Cruise”, “Round Here”, “Sippin’ On Fire”, “Sun Daze”, “Dirt” and more. Eli Young Band’s “Drunk Last Night”, “Crazy Girl”, and “Even If It Breaks Your Heart”. We had a Top 10 with Cassadee Pope’s debut single “Wasting All These Tears” after coming off of a big season three of THE VOICE! A Thousand Horses debut single “Smoke” was a favorite of mine too; those guys ROCK. Working so closely with such incredible and talented artists was a dream I didn’t even know I had. And I really LOVED it.But. I missed radio. Every day. So, I came back! And I love hanging out with you every single day! I never ever EVER dread coming into work; totally geek out when we get new songs from your (and my!) favorite artists and absolutely OBSESS over going to live shows. My very favorite part of my job is getting to interview artists … trying to catch them off-guard with unexpected questions & making them laugh. If that happens, you can bet I’m grinning from ear to ear. Couple more fun facts about me? Well, sure. I graduated from Arizona State University’s Walter Cronkite School of Broadcast Journalism. I never skipped class & definitely didn’t party enough, but I did graduate with honors, so it paid off! I have two dogs; an English Springer Spaniel named Clarence Worley & a Cockapoo named Sasha Banks. Bonus points if you know who their namesakes are. If not, that’s okay. It’s insider stuff. My husband Mike is about as opposite from me as you can imagine, but we’re a perfect Match, which is where we met! Match.com! I set all my alarms with 3s. Like, 7:03. 7:33. Everything 3s. It’s my lucky number & I’m SUPER superstitious about it. Weird, I know. I’m not a very good cook, unless I’m making Grammy’s recipe Stuffed Peppers. I replace the ground beef with turkey & YUM. I used to have blue eyes but now they’re green and if I don’t wear my glasses, I squint. I LOVE movies mainly because I WAY WAY love popcorn. I don’t sing karaoke; I rap. My song of choice is usually Young MC’s “Bust A Move” which I realize is weird coming from a country music radio girl. I’m an only child, but I know how to share. I grew up in a retirement community because my Dad is a golf pro. My Mom was a Principal, but thankfully not mine. I played volleyball and softball in high school. I was a power hitter, but super slow around the bases, so my nickname was IceBox (as in, unhitch the Icebox from your back, Lois!). Sad. But also funny because it’s true. I believe different M&Ms have different tastes due to the color of their shell. I prefer red or green. I love shooting stars. I’m a freakishly fast typist. I cannot stand bad grammar. My two favorite movies (yep; it’s a tie) are Top Gun and Pretty Woman. My favorite artists are Eric Church, Garth Brooks, Taylor Swift, everyone I used to work with … and, well, heck. Just EVERYONE. Music is my greatest passion & I try to make sure you feel that in my voice every single time I crack the mic.I hope when you hang out with me on the radio I always leave you with a smile … because you do the same for me.XO,-LL Contact ",

I’m here to keep you company each day while you’re workin’! Let’s just jump right in, shall we? Things I Love: PURPLE EVERYTHING, cinnamon gum, (even though I'm allergic) Miller Lite, (ice cold, preferably in aluminum) to laugh (loudly and often), MUSIC MUSIC MUSIC! I have a tattoo (no, that’s not my only one) of a lightning bolt on my right forearm reminding me to LIVE ELECTRIC (so I guess that's my hashtag) every day. My favorite quote (and I LOVE quotes) is \"Make Everybody Feel Like A Somebody”. I try to stick to that each day, finding the BEST in every situation (even when encountering a grumpypants) because being negative just requires too much energy! It’s easier to smile! I’ve wanted to be on the radio since I was a little girl. I would listen to my favorite stations and record music and deejays on my cassette player and then carry my tapes around with me everywhere … remember those little yellow Walkmans? Yep! Still have mine! In 2009, I was given the opportunity to work for the Big Machine Label Group. That’s the home of some of your favorites like Tim McGraw, Taylor Swift, Rascal Flatts, Brantley Gilbert, Jennifer Nettles, Justin Moore and more. The first (and only) time I got to fly on a private jet was also the same day I got to hear Taylor Swift’s “We Are Never Getting Back Together” (before it was even released)! I worked for Republic Nashville, one of the imprints at the BMLG for seven years and had a hand in launching the careers of The Band Perry, Florida-Georgia Line, A Thousand Horses, Eli Young Band, Cassadee Pope and more! It was my job to take their songs to radio stations all across the West and convince them to play their music on the air … first just a little … and then more often. If I did my job well, and everything worked the way we hoped, we climbed the charts, scored #1 records and our artists got to go on tour all across the World! Some of the songs I worked were The Band Perry’s “If I Die Young”, “All Your Life”, “Better Dig Two”, “Done” … Florida-Georgia Line’s “Cruise”, “Round Here”, “Sippin’ On Fire”, “Sun Daze”, “Dirt” and more. Eli Young Band’s “Drunk Last Night”, “Crazy Girl”, and “Even If It Breaks Your Heart”. We had a Top 10 with Cassadee Pope’s debut single “Wasting All These Tears” after coming off of a big season three of THE VOICE! A Thousand Horses debut single “Smoke” was a favorite of mine too; those guys ROCK. Working so closely with such incredible and talented artists was a dream I didn’t even know I had. And I really LOVED it.But. I missed radio. Every day. So, I came back! And I love hanging out with you every single day! I never ever EVER dread coming into work; totally geek out when we get new songs from your (and my!) favorite artists and absolutely OBSESS over going to live shows. My very favorite part of my job is getting to interview artists … trying to catch them off-guard with unexpected questions & making them laugh. If that happens, you can bet I’m grinning from ear to ear. Couple more fun facts about me? Well, sure. I graduated from Arizona State University’s Walter Cronkite School of Broadcast Journalism. I never skipped class & definitely didn’t party enough, but I did graduate with honors, so it paid off! I have two dogs; an English Springer Spaniel named Clarence Worley & a Cockapoo named Sasha Banks. Bonus points if you know who their namesakes are. If not, that’s okay. It’s insider stuff. My husband Mike is about as opposite from me as you can imagine, but we’re a perfect Match, which is where we met! Match.com! I set all my alarms with 3s. Like, 7:03. 7:33. Everything 3s. It’s my lucky number & I’m SUPER superstitious about it. Weird, I know. I’m not a very good cook, unless I’m making Grammy’s recipe Stuffed Peppers. I replace the ground beef with turkey & YUM. I used to have blue eyes but now they’re green and if I don’t wear my glasses, I squint. I LOVE movies mainly because I WAY WAY love popcorn. I don’t sing karaoke; I rap. My song of choice is usually Young MC’s “Bust A Move” which I realize is weird coming from a country music radio girl. I’m an only child, but I know how to share. I grew up in a retirement community because my Dad is a golf pro. My Mom was a Principal, but thankfully not mine. I played volleyball and softball in high school. I was a power hitter, but super slow around the bases, so my nickname was IceBox (as in, unhitch the Icebox from your back, Lois!). Sad. But also funny because it’s true. I believe different M&Ms have different tastes due to the color of their shell. I prefer red or green. I love shooting stars. I’m a freakishly fast typist. I cannot stand bad grammar. My two favorite movies (yep; it’s a tie) are Top Gun and Pretty Woman. My favorite artists are Eric Church, Garth Brooks, Taylor Swift, everyone I used to work with … and, well, heck. Just EVERYONE. Music is my greatest passion & I try to make sure you feel that in my voice every single time I crack the mic.I hope when you hang out with me on the radio I always leave you with a smile … because you do the same for me.XO,-LL Contact ",

      "text": "The Stainless Steel model with mesh band is now $150 off at Newegg and Amazon. \nThe Huawei Watch is easily one of the best Android Wear watches on the market right now, especially when it comes to design. There are a few different styles to choose from, some costing more than others. The Jewel/Pearl model, shown above with a gold finish tiny jewels circling the display, is down to $349.99 on Amazon, B&H, and Walmart. That's a whopping $200 off the original price, by far the lowest it has ever been (the last lowest price was $470). \nIf you're thinking to yourself, \"What's the catch,\" there really isn't one. We gave the watch solid marks in our review , and with it being one of two watches with the Android Wear 2.0 preview , it's safe to say it will receive the finished update. If you think the Gold/Jewel design is too flashy, several other models are heavily discounted as well. \nHuawei Watch - Jewel/Pearl",

      "text": "Amazon worker jumps off company building after e-mail to staff Photo: Reuters   \nSEATTLE — An Amazon employee was injured when he leaped off a building at the company’s Seattle headquarters in what police characterised as a suicide attempt. \nThe man, who wasn’t identified by authorities, sent an e-mail visible to hundreds of co-workers, including Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos, before the incident occurred, according to a person familiar with the matter. The man survived the fall from Amazon’s 12-story Apollo building at about 8.45am US time (12.45am Singapore time) Monday (Nov 28) and was taken to a Seattle hospital, police said. \nThe man had recently put in a request to transfer to a different department, but was placed on an employee improvement plan, a step that can lead to termination if performance isn’t improved, said the person, who asked not to be identified discussing company personnel matters. More than 20,000 people work in multiple buildings at Amazon’s headquarters. \n“Our thoughts are with our colleague as he continues to recover,” Amazon said in a statement. “He’s receiving some of the best care possible and we will be there to support him throughout the recovery process.” \nSuicide was the 10th-leading cause of death in the US in 2013, with 41,149 people taking their own lives that year, for a rate of 12.6 per 100,000, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \nThe online retailer has taken steps to soften its image as a difficult employer since a New York Times story last year portrayed the company as a bruising workplace where employees were encouraged to take advantage of one another to get ahead. Amazon disputed the characterisation of the company. BLOOMBERG",

      "text": "(Photo: Paul Sakuma / AP, file)\nRandy Hetrick first noticed counterfeits on Amazon.com Inc. in 2013. He had been selling his TRX Training System— an exercise kit of suspension straps — on the site since 2008. When he began noticing cheap imitations, he had his employees scour Amazon for more, then go through the tedious process of reporting them for removal.\nBut new imposters would pop up right away, and by 2014, “We realized this was an epidemic,” said Hetrick, who estimates phonies cost him $100 million a year, twice his annual sales.\nAmazon’s Marketplace gives inventors like Hetrick exposure to hundreds of millions of shoppers without the big expense of building and promoting a website from scratch. Merchants give Amazon a commission on each sale. But a hot-selling product on Amazon encourages counterfeiters to make flimsy knockoffs with cheap materials, steal sales and damage a brand with few consequences.\nAmazon has known the problem is getting worse, according to a source familiar with the matter, but for years, the company has been largely silent about the flourishing fakes. That has frustrated manufacturers and brand owners who bear the cost and responsibility of policing the site, reporting problems and hoping Amazon takes action.\nNow, the world’s biggest online retailer is getting serious. It has made fighting phonies a major goal for 2017, building teams in the U.S. and Europe to work with major brands on a registry to prevent fakes, according to a person familiar with the initiative, who was not authorized to speak about the matter and requested anonymity. Discussions with Major League Baseball and the National Football League about selling merchandise on Amazon hit a standstill earlier this year because of concerns about Amazon’s lack of control over fakes, the person said.\nAmazon is desperately trying to bring order to the Wild West atmosphere on its marketplace, where more than 2 million independent sellers compete for the attention and money of shoppers. About half of the goods purchased on Amazon come from independent merchants, who help Amazon expand its inventory more quickly and with less upfront cost than Amazon could do on its own. It also makes the retailer and its customers more vulnerable to fakes because the simple online registration process currently in place is designed to make it easy for businesses to begin selling immediately. But that also makes it simple for counterfeiters to list fake goods, sell as many as they can before they’re detected, and then vanish.\nAmazon’s suits targeting sellers were the first of their kind for the company, a warning to counterfeiters heading into the busy holiday shopping season when the most is at stake. It could be too little, too late.\nThe shift of spending from stores with tight inventory controls to online marketplaces where it’s tough to distinguish between fake and authentic is fueling a rise in counterfeiting that shows no signs of slowing. Alibaba and Ebay are also grappling with copycat products. Counterfeits made up nearly $500 billion, or 2.5 percent, of global imports in 2013, a figure expected to grow as more spending shifts online, according to an April report by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. China is the biggest source of phonies.\nDespite efforts to decrease them, complaints about imitations on Amazon have been growing along with its inventory since at least 2014, according to a person familiar with the matter. What Amazon has known internally for years is spilling into the public eye. Birkenstock announced it would cease selling products on Amazon in January due to concerns about counterfeits. And in October, Apple Inc. sued an Amazon supplier claiming the business sold fake Apple products — some of them unsafe — on Amazon.\nAmazon, eBay and Alibaba are largely shielded from legal liability as long as they have processes in place for brands to report fake goods and take timely action to suspend sales once notified. The online marketplaces often don’t have the inventory, so there is nothing to seize. The result is an endless loop with brands buying and reporting fakes, marketplaces suspending accounts, and the fraudsters creating new accounts to hawk the same fake goods under new pseudonyms. EBay lets registered brand owners report suspected counterfeit listings for removal, as does Alibaba.\nBut the retailers can only do so much. Shoppers worried about buying fakes during the holidays have to bear some responsibility, said Akino Chikada, senior brand protection manager at the firm MarkMonitor, which helps brands find online sources of counterfeits. She suggests looking closely at web addresses for subtle variations from brand names and probing websites for sloppy privacy and return policies, which can signal a phony. Bargain basement prices are another tell-tale sign, though sophisticated counterfeiters try to make the price difference less suspicious by coming in at 10 or 20 percent below other offers rather than half price, she said.",

      "text": "Amazon’s ‘Grand Tour’ Triples ‘Man in the High Castle’ Viewers (Exclusive) More We already knew that “The Grand Tour” debuted as Amazon’s top-watched original series to-date , but now we have a pretty good snapshot of just how badly it beat “The Man in the High Castle.”\nThe former “Top Gear” guys’ new show more than tripled the opening weekend viewership of the revisionist history drama, which previously held Amazon’s record. Per measurement company Symphony Advanced Media, the highly anticipated “The Grand Tour” premiere earned 1.954 million viewers 18-49, the age range coveted by advertisers. Those numbers are inclusive of three days worth of delayed viewing, like all in this post.\nComparatively, the first episode of “MITHC” premiered to 637,000 viewers, according to Symphony AM. That total is more than double Amazon’s now third-biggest original series, “Catastrophe” (274,000 debut demo viewers). Keep in mind, the “Top Gear” alums had a built-in audience, so this wasn’t a typical new series launch.\nAlso Read: 'Amanda Knox' Ratings Are No Killer on Netflix, Firm Says\nOf course, Amazon’s internal viewership numbers would be better to have, but the streaming company’s not coughing those up. Symphony utilizes audio recognition software and a panelist’s cell phone microphone to count up tune-in. The Silicon Valley-based measurement company considers its TV Ratings to be stable after eight days of compiling data, though Netflix’s Ted Sarandos has disagreed in the past .\nThe series stars Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May doing what they do best — traveling the world and discussing anything and everything car-related. Clarkson, who is known for being impulsive and outspoken, got into hot water at “Top Gear” after he punched a producer; he later apologized for the incident and settled a lawsuit over the matter.\n“The Grand Tour” is releasing one episode at a time, unlike many streaming shows. Further episodes will be released weekly over the next 11 weeks for Prime members in the U.S., U.K., Germany, Austria and Japan, and the show will premiere worldwide for Amazon customers in over 200 countries and territories in December.\nRelated stories from TheWrap:\nMegyn Kelly's New Book Gets Trolled by Donald Trump Supporters on Amazon\n15 Scariest Horror Movies Streaming on Netflix, Amazon (Photos)\nAmazon's Investments in Film and TV Dragged Down Profitability, CFO Says\n'Mad Men' Creator Matt Weiner Sets TV Return at Amazon\nAmazon's Joe Lewis Adds Drama Oversight, Morgan Wandell to Head International Production",

      "text": "(Jonathan Capriel) \nThe period of peak online shopping now extends well beyond Cyber Monday — Amazon workers refer to the span of days between Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday as the \"Turkey Five.\" \nAnd this year was primed for growth: Adobe Digital Insights calculated late Monday that the day was the most successful online shopping date in history, generating $3.39 billion in sales with 10.2 percent growth over last year. Amazon officials said this past weekend broke sales records, and they expected to mark their busiest Cyber Monday to date, though they did not provide predicted sales figure for the single day. \n\"Last year on Cyber Monday, for reference, Amazon customers ordered 54 million units worldwide. That is 692 items per second, so that is a staggering number, and it's going to be an even bigger number this year,\" said Amazon spokeswoman Julie Law. She said Amazon predicted 17 percent to 27 percent growth in fourth-quarter sales compared to the same time last year, generating between $42 billion and $45.5 billion in 2016. \nIn the Baltimore fulfillment center — one of more than 70 around the nation — workers were already feeling the effects of \"peak season.\" \nNicholas Rote, who has been working there since its inception in March 2015, describes Cyber Monday in one word: \"Crazy.\" \nLast year was the first holiday season at the fulfillment center, and Rote said it was \"organized chaos.\" \nThe 28-year-old Armistead Gardens resident, who helps transfer large or heavy products to other facilities in the area for shipment, said this year's peak season is going better than last year despite the expected increase. Still, \"there's a lot more going on inside the building.\" \nOne parking lot, which normally sees only a couple of rows of cars, is nearly filled because of the additional help this season, Rote said. \n\"We've taken a nice, drastic step to ensure that we get everything in, processed and out to where they need to be,\" said Rote, who helps train Amazon's new employees. \"It's pretty crazy working inside Amazon's walls, but the best thing that keeps ... your drive alive is the camaraderie with other Amazon people because it's really diverse in there.\" \n\"We all get along and work together. It's cool to see a lot of people having jobs,\" said Justin Brown, 27, of Northeast Baltimore, who packs items. On this particular Cyber Monday, he and colleagues packed the likes of Christmas decorations, mixed nuts, DVDs, educational toys, toilet paper, the hot Hasbro Pie Face Showdown game and Amazon devices such as the Echo Dot. \n\"People don't want to go to the store. That's what they do; they just order them,\" said Chris Smith, 31, of West Baltimore, who works in the same department as Brown. \nBefore it was an Amazon fulfillment center, the site had been a General Motors assembly plant, which closed in 2005, taking more than 1,000 local jobs with it. \nNow, full-time Amazon associates in Baltimore average over $15 an hour and have benefits such as health insurance and a 401(K), according to an Amazon spokesperson. \nIn recent years, media outlets have reported critically on working conditions in Amazon. The New York Times described a punishing, all-consuming culture at the corporate level, and the Allentown Morning Call documented heat-related safety issues at a distribution center. The company denied the allegations in The Times report and installed air-conditioning at its Allentown facility (it now has climate control at all its distribution centers, including Baltimore). \n\"At Amazon, safety is our top priority,\" spokeswoman Kelly Cheeseman said in a statement Monday to The Sun. \"We have more than 800 dedicated health and safety professionals working in our U.S. fulfillment centers and all employees start by completing a dedicated safety school.\" \nWorkers on Monday spoke favorably about their experiences. \nEvery day, Brown said, presents a new challenge, with numbers to meet — especially during peak season — but also the opportunity to build skills for a career. \n\"It's fast-paced. They tell us the numbers we need … to get for the customers and stuff, so we just push everything out and try to work as fast and in order as possible,\" said Brown, noting the day's package goals are often split into quarters, with the goal of about 150 to 200 units per quarter. \nAnd despite missing out on time with loved ones during much of the holiday season, Smith and Brown say the friendly environment and fast pace keep them focused during their 55-plus-hour weeks during Amazon's peak season. \n\"It's five weeks, and we got to work ... but it pays off because the money is good,\" Brown said. \"That's the best bet. And if we're here enough, we'll get a bonus, too, so that really helps us out.\" \ntwitter.com/brittanybritto",

      "text": " Research and Markets\nDUBLIN , Nov\nResearch and Markets has announced the addition of the \"The Big Data Market: Business Case, Market Analysis & Forecasts 2016 - 2021\" report to their offering.\nThe management of unstructured data (e.g. Big Data), the leveraging of analytics tools to derive value, and the integration between Cloud, Internet of Things (IoT), and enterprise operational technology are key focus areas for large companies across virtually every industry vertical. However, Big Data and Analytics tools are not limited to large companies as products and services are emerging that are democratizing data for smaller companies.\nA new data economy is developing in which the data associated with corporate products and services becomes almost as value as the company offerings themselves. New models are emerging to reduce friction across the value chain including enhanced Big Data as a Service (BDaaS) offerings. BDaaS is anticipated to make cross-industry, cross-company, and even cross-competitor data exchange a reality that adds value across the ecosystem with minimized security and privacy concerns.\nKey Findings:\nThe global Big Data Market will reach $72B USD by 2021 with a CAGR of 20.8%. Western Europe will be a market leader with $20.9B USD by 2021 with CAGR of 22.2%. Business Intelligence Tools and Analytics Platforms will reach $15.8B USD globally by 2021. Professional Services remains the leading revenue area through 2021 with CAGR of 23.8%.

PHOTO: REUTERS Nov 29, 2016 9:13 AM \n[SEATTLE] An Amazon.com Inc employee was injured when he leaped off a building at the company's Seattle headquarters in what police characterised as a suicide attempt. \nThe man, who wasn't identified by authorities, sent an e-mail visible to hundreds of co-workers, including chief executive officer Jeff Bezos, before the incident occurred, according to a person familiar with the matter. The man survived the fall from Amazon's 12-story Apollo building at about 8:45am local time Monday and was taken to a Seattle hospital, police said. \nThe man had recently put in a request to transfer to a different department, but was placed on an employee improvement plan, a step that can lead to termination if performance isn't improved, said the person, who asked not to be identified discussing company personnel matters. More than 20,000 people work in multiple buildings at Amazon's headquarters. \n\"Our thoughts are with our colleague as he continues to recover,\" Amazon said in a statement. \"He's receiving some of the best care possible and we will be there to support him throughout the recovery process.\" \nIn the e-mail, the man expressed criticism of how the company handled his transfer request, and he hinted that he might harm himself, according to the person. \nSuicide was the 10th-leading cause of death in the US in 2013, with 41,149 people taking their own lives that year, for a rate of 12.6 per 100,000, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \nThe online retailer has taken steps to soften its image as a difficult employer since a New York Times story last year portrayed the company as a bruising workplace where employees were encouraged to take advantage of one another to get ahead. Amazon disputed the characterisation of the company. \nBLOOMBERG ",

There are 3 greeting cards to a pack and each one has the blank Amazon Gift Card, so you can basically activate the gift card whenever and for however much much you want.\n",

I haven’t read this book yet, but it’s on my to-read list and I’m really looking forward to it! \nGet The Miracle Morning for just $2.99 .

      "text": "Amazon is finally cracking down on counterfeit products War on fakes on Nov 28, 2016, 8:15 PM TechSpot \nAmazon has been doing some cleaning up lately to provide a safer shopping experience to its users. After stepping up its efforts to clamp down on incentivized reviews, the company is now looking to fight fake products from appearing on its website, by setting up teams in the U.S. and Europe that will work with manufacturers to establish a registry of recognized sellers. \nAccording to a report by Bloomberg , Amazon has made fighting fakes a major goal for 2017. The news outlet’s sources claim that the company's new teams will seek out brands, even those that don't sell through Amazon, to register with it. Once a trademark name is registered, any marketplace seller who lists one of the products will be forced to provide proof they have the brand's permission. \nThe system would in theory reverse the current situation by going directly to brands when sellers want to list a product, instead of brands reporting counterfeit goods to Amazon and waiting for a response. \nThis has become an increasingly troublesome issue for Amazon. According to Bloomberg, the counterfeit problem has prevented the MLB and the NFL from selling its merchandise on the site, while Apple recently sued US-based firm Mobile Star LLC for trademark infringement, alleging that it has been selling counterfeit goods using Apple logos and product images in its Amazon listings. \nWhen it comes to electronics, buying one of these fakes means you could be putting yourself at risk. Apple noted counterfeits are often poorly built with inferior or missing parts, flawed designs, and inadequate electrical insulation. They have the potential to cause fires or even “deadly” electric shocks. \nThe creation of a brand registry would mark Amazon’s biggest push against counterfeits yet, but the company has tried other policies recently, including a $1,500 fee for sellers who want to sell a major brand — something legit businesses would be willing to pay while fending off counterfeiters. It also filed two lawsuits against merchants it says are selling counterfeit goods. Related Reads",

      "text": "on Nov 28, 2016, 4:45 PM TechSpot \nAmazon caught the industry by surprise with the launch of its Echo smart speaker a little over two years ago. With the Fire Phone flop still fresh in everyone’s mind, some in the tech community assumed the cylindrical digital assistant would was destined for the same fate but the reality couldn’t have been further from the truth. \nAccording to a recent report from market analyst Consumer Intelligence Research Partners (CIRP), Amazon has sold 5.1 million Echo devices in the US since launch and roughly two million units over the first nine months of 2016 (Amazon doesn’t publish hardware sales figures). \nThe Amazon Echo launched in November 2014 on an invite-only basis before becoming widely available about six months later. While some may see it as little more than a glorified kitchen timer, the Echo (and its smaller siblings, the Echo Dot and Echo Tap , that Amazon launched earlier this year) can perform a number of useful tasks such as play music, control connected smart home devices, call an Uber, order a pizza from Domino’s and get weather updates. \nCIRP data indicates that more than 40 percent of Echo owners use the device as a speaker for listening to streaming music while roughly a third use it as an information provider responding to questions. \nAmazon may have been first to market with its standalone digital assistant but it’s no longer the only option to choose from. Google earlier this year launched its own voice assistant called Google Home and Apple is said to be building a “ Siri speaker ” to compete with those devices. Related Reads",

      "text": "Amazon remains the go-to marketplace for just about everything, which has made it a target for counterfeit products and phony goods. According to a report from Bloomberg , the online retail giant is finally cracking down on fake products that appear on the site. The report indicates Amazon is assembling teams in the United States and Europe that will work with major brands on initiatives to keep knockoff products off the market. The plan would reportedly include building a registry of products that would help identify authentic items and bar fake ones from the site.\nThe plan would encourage brands to register with Amazon—even if the companies don’t sell their products directly through the marketplace. Once a brand is registered with Amazon, the ecommerce company would require all merchants retailing product from the registered brand to prove they have permission to sell.\nAmazon has reportedly been working on a pilot version of the program with Nike. A wider rollout of the registry and dedicated teams to detect fakes is expected to be a focus of Amazon in 2017.\n“Amazon has zero tolerance for the sale of counterfeit items on our site. We work closely with manufacturers and brands to identify offenders, and removing fraudulent items. We are also taking legal action and aggressively pursuing bad actors,” a spokesperson for Amazon told IBTimes. No additional details about plans to curb fake products were provided.\nDamage caused by fake products can range from physical harm caused by faulty electronics to placing a considerable squeeze on legitimate small businesses .\nAmazon’s newfound focus on fakes comes after Major League Baseball cracked down on merchants on the marketplace that were selling MLB-licensed products without permission. Earlier this year, Amazon’s negotiations with MLB and the National Football League hit a standstill due to concerns about unauthorized merchandise.\nIn July, Birkenstock pulled its products from Amazon as it became too difficult to rid the site of knockoffs and Apple filed a lawsuit  against a company selling fake chargers and cables that were marketed as Apple products on Amazon. This month, Amazon filed suit against sellers placing fake goods on its site.\nThe fraudulent product problem has only increased with Amazon’s reliance on third party merchants. More than 2 million retailers now sell through Amazon, accounting for 50 percent of total sales. According to a report from RW Baird , some product categories see 83 percent of products purchased from third-party sellers on Amazon.\nRelated Articles \nAmazon Might Sell Tickets to Shows in US With 'Prime Tickets' Live Sports On Amazon: Streaming Service Looking To Add Premium Channels To Prime Membership, Report Says",
