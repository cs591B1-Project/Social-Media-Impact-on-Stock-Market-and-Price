      "text": "Published: Dec 5, 2016 6:23 p.m. ET Share \nOpinion: Online retail giant aims to disrupt $795 billion U.S. grocery business with stores that don’t include checkout lines and other concepts Amazon via YouTube A shopper exits an Amazon Go store with her purchases logged on a mobile phone in an image taken from a promotional video released Monday by Amazon.com Inc. \nBy Therese Poletti Columnist \nAmazon.com Inc.’s plans for its most ambitious brick-and-mortar effort yet aim to disrupt an arena seen as an Achilles' heel for Silicon Valley: The $795 billion grocery industry. \nAmazon released a video Monday about a convenience-store effort called Amazon Go, one of three grocery concepts the online-retail giant is planning, according to a Monday report from The Wall Street Journal and earlier reporting from Business Insider . According to Amazon’s website , Amazon Go has been in the works for four years and weaves together a combination of machine learning, computer vision, artificial intelligence, sensors and RFID technology in what it calls “Just Walk Out Technology,” which rids the store of one of the biggest hassles of shopping, the checkout lines. \n“No lines, no checkouts, no registers, no, seriously,” a video on its website says in a demo showing 20-something shoppers entering the store, scanning an app at the turnstile and simply walking out with their wares. \nThe ability to build its biggest push into physical retail from scratch with this type of automatic technology could be the ticket to further disruption of traditional brick-and-mortar retailers like Wal-Mart Stores Inc. WMT, -1.33% and Target Corp. TGT, -1.23% Grocery shopping for fresh food has long been a difficult but enticing arena for tech startups, which have put forth efforts like Webvan during the dot-com boom and now Instacart and its rivals, which offer grocery shopping as a service. Stores have even developed their own online options, such as Safeway.com, but Amazon has a good chance to crack into traditional grocery shopping with this hybrid effort, which addresses many of the issues consumers have with online grocery shopping. \nJohn Blackledge, a Cowen & Co. analyst with an outperform rating on Amazon, wrote in a note to clients Monday that he believes the grocery business is Amazon’s “biggest potential source of revenue upside over time, with Go being another layer of Amazon’s multiplatform grocery strategy,” which also includes its Amazon Fresh and Prime Now two-hour delivery. \n“We are encouraged by Amazon’s growing footprint in this category, which we see as ripe for potential disruption given younger demos increasingly purchasing food and beverage grocery items via digital channels,” Blackledge wrote. \nAccording to a recent survey by Cowen & Co., 65% of consumers surveyed preferred to buy their groceries in a store, with 51% of them stating that they liked to inspect or select the food. Cowen estimates that the online portion of the U.S. food and beverage grocery market was only about 4% retail penetration in 2016, or about $33 billion. Cowen & Co. Results of Cowen & Co. consumer internet survey, June - Nov. 2016 \nAmazon AMZN, +2.57% is testing the Amazon Go technology in an 1,800-square-foot convenience store in Seattle accessible only by Amazon employees, though the company plans to open it to the public early next year. The retail space automatically detects when products are taken from or returned to the shelves and keeps track of them in a virtual shopping cart. When you’re done shopping, you can just leave the store, and items will be charged to your Amazon account. \n“The items are identified and automatically associated with the user at or near the time of the item pick,” according to the abstract of one Amazon patent for the technology , published last year. \nThe company likens the technology at the Amazon Go store to that used in self-driving cars, saying it uses computer vision and AI to associate items with past purchases made by the consumer. This use of AI and machine learning will make its algorithms smarter for future purchases, and is an early consumer-oriented effort, built using AI tools in the design of the product from the get go, versus enhancing an already existing product. \nDespite the work already put into the effort, this could be a costly experiment for Amazon, with the different range of store formats planned, physical retail locations to acquire or rent, technology systems to install and maintain, more employees to hire and, of course, keeping inventory stocked. The cost of Amazon’s vast physical warehouse infrastructure build-out over the past few years has only been eclipsed in cost by the money its spends on shipping products to customers of its Amazon Prime service, which includes free shipping. \nBuilding more physical stores—the WSJ and BI reports say Amazon will build up to 2,000 brick-and-mortar locations—will certainly add to Amazon’s already hefty spending. But if any dot-com can handle the financial outlay necessary to finally break into the grocery business and make it work, it will likely be the company that already did the same to bookstores. \nWall Street seems bullish on the efforts, with Amazon’s shares gaining nearly 3% on Monday . The online-retail giant’s stock has increased 12.4% so far this year, handily outpacing the S&P 500 SPX, +0.58% index, at 7.9%, and Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.24% , which has gained 10.3%.

      "text": "Follow @rawstory \nAmazon.com Inc said on Monday it has opened a brick-and-mortar grocery store in Seattle without lines or checkout counters, kicking off new competition with supermarket chains. \nAmazon Go, the online shopping company’s new 1,800-square-foot (167-square-meter) store, uses sensors to detect what items shoppers have picked off the shelves and sends a bill to their Amazon accounts if they do not replace them. \nThe store marks Amazon’s latest push into groceries, one of the biggest retail categories it has yet to master. The company currently delivers produce and groceries to homes through its AmazonFresh service. \n“It’s a great recognition that their e-commerce model doesn’t work for every product,” said analyst Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research, noting that physical stores would complement AmazonFresh. \n“If there were hundreds of these stores around the country, it would be a huge threat” to supermarket chains, he said. \nThe S&P 1500 food retail index, which includes Kroger Co, Whole Foods Market Inc and other companies, was down 0.5 percent at the close. Shares of Amazon closed up about 2.6 percent. \nAmazon Go is available now for employees of the company and is expected to be open to the public early next year, Amazon said. \nIf tests are successful, Amazon plans to open more than 2,000 grocery stores, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday, citing sources. The company is considering other store formats, including one that would let drivers pick up goods at the curbside, the report said. \nAmazon declined to comment on the report. \n“The checkout lines are always the most inefficient parts of the store experience,” said Neil Saunders, managing director of retail research firm Conlumino. “Not only would you save a lot on labor costs, you actually would make the process much quicker for consumers and much more satisfying.” \nStill, the grab-and-go experience would take getting used to, he said. \nSome people may “feel like they stole” an item, Saunders said. \nApart from groceries such as bread and milk, the store also offers ready-to-eat meals made fresh by on-site chefs and local kitchens and bakeries, Amazon said. \nThat would make Amazon Go a potential competitor to fast-casual dining chains like Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc as well. \nAmazon Go is not the first physical store for the e-commerce company to open. \nIt has a book store in Seattle, as well as pop-ups at malls where it displays Amazon devices such as the Kindle. \n(Reporting by Narottam Medhora in Bengaluru and Jeffrey Dastin in New York; Additional reporting by Lewis Krauskopf in New York; Editing by Andrew Hay and Matthew Lewis) About the Author Reuters.com brings you the latest news from around the world, covering breaking news in business, politics, technology, and more.

But the key selling point is what it doesn't have: checkout lines. \nNEW YORK– Amazon has gone after book stores, retail chains and electronics shops. Now it’s taking on grocery stores, with a twist. \nAmazon unveiled in a video a new physical store on Monday that sells a mix of “grocery essentials” and ready-made meals. But the key selling point is what it doesn’t have: checkout lines. \nThe video shows how customers check in at the entrance of the store with a new app called Amazon Go, then grab whatever items are needed. Amazon claims it can track the items automatically through a combination of computer vision and deep learning technologies. When you’re done shopping, you just walk out. \nThe first store is located in Seattle, where Amazon is headquartered. \nFor years, there have been rumors the e-commerce company would expand its dominance from digital to physical shopping. Amazon began experimenting with physical bookstores a year ago, but Amazon Go may mark its boldest bet on bricks-and-mortar yet. \nBy eliminating much of the staff needed to operate a store, Amazon keeps costs lower than traditional competitors. It’s also in a strong position to bring together data on its customers shopping habits online and offline to make better suggestions in all situations. \nHowever, Amazon’s move deeper into physical retail shops comes in a sensitive political climate. The company could be perceived as being a threat to some of the 3.4 million Americans who work as cashiers, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. \nOn the campaign trail, Donald Trump repeatedly criticized Amazon and its founder Jeff Bezos for “getting away with murder tax-wise” and having “a huge antitrust problem.” Will the President-elect add “job killer” to the list of criticisms? \nAmazon’s effort to launch a new kind of retail store predates the rise of Donald Trump. \n“Four years ago we asked ourselves: what if we could create a shopping experience with no lines and no checkout? Could we push the boundaries of computer vision and machine learning to create a store where customers could simply take what they want and go?” the company says on an informational page about Amazon Go. \nFor now, Amazon is starting slow. The first store is only open to Amazon employees and will not be an option for the general public until early next year. \nBy Seth Fiegerman ",

Amazon has launched a beta version of Go, described as a “new kind of store with no checkout required.” Just grab your groceries and walk right out. More Subscribe on YouTube\nYou’re not shoplifting, you’re just shopping in the future.\nAmazon has launched a beta version of its Go convenience store, which it describes as a “new kind of store with no checkout required.” An ambitious project that has apparently been in the works for four years, Amazon Go seeks to do away with the nuisance of waiting in lines. Rather than paying in the store, customers simply … walk out once they’re done getting their groceries.\nMore : Marshawn Lynch is projecting his inner Santa with Amazon’s Treasure Truck\nSo how does it work? According to Amazon, the experience depends upon “the same types of technologies used in self-driving cars: computer vision, sensor fusion, and deep learning.” Whenever you grab an item from a shelf, the company’s Just Walk Out technology detects what’s been taken and its price. If you change your mind about an item, you can put it back, and Amazon will remove it from your virtual shopping cart. When you’re finished, just leave, and your credit card will be charged and you’ll be sent a receipt.\nAs it stands, Amazon Go currently offers ready-to-eat breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snack options, created daily by on-site chefs, local kitchens, and bakeries. And while Go has grocery store staples like bread, milk, and cheese, it also stocks products for the more adventurous eaters from brands Amazon is eager to introduce to the public. You can even buy an Amazon Meal Kit, which promises to contain “all the ingredients you need to make a meal for two in about 30 minutes.”\nCurrently, only Amazon employees are taking part of the Beta program, though Amazon promises to open up its 21st century grocery store to the public in early 2017. You can sign up to be notified when Go opens here . But until then, keep paying for your groceries in the store. You don’t want to jump the gun on this one.\nBroken smartphone?

      "text": "SHARES Source: Amazon \nAmazon 's new Amazon Go store is one of at least three brick-and-mortar food formats being explored by the online retailer, sources told The Wall Street Journal on Monday. \nEarlier Monday, Amazon announced an employee pilot program of Amazon Go, a high-tech Seattle convenience store that relies on an app and computer vision instead of traditional registers . It will open to the public early next year, Amazon said. \nBut The Wall Street Journal's sources said Amazon is also considering at least two types of bigger stores, including a store with curbside pick-up and a drive-through option. At least one drive-through location is slated to open in the next few weeks, the Journal said, citing people close to the situation, while a combination in-store and curbside pick-up format may be planned for late next year. \nAmazon declined to comment on the report to CNBC, citing a policy against commenting on speculation. \nThe Journal's report likely ties Amazon Go to a pilot program first reported by Business Insider . BI reported earlier this year that Amazon would experiment with a 20-store pilot program, including 10 \"click-and-collect\" drive-up grocery stores and 10 stores where consumers go inside to shop. Ultimately, Amazon may aim for 2,000 grocery stores across the U.S. over the next decade, BI reported.",

A giant billboard of Lady Liberty giving the salute is now up in Times Square, Gothamist reports.\n\nStatue Of Liberty Gives Nazi Salute In Huge Times Square Billboard For Amazon's 'The Man In The High Castle' https://t.co/OS7uS7QLM6 pic.twitter.com/YGhvpfENP2 \n— Gothamist (@Gothamist) December 5, 2016 People on Twitter can't help but compare the ad to the current political landscape, in which there have been reports of Nazi supporters celebrating the victory of President-elect Donald Trump.\n\nA month ago this was just a TV ad.

      "text": "Tweet \nAmazon released a video of their new in-store shopping concept that will revolutionize the purchasing experience but could also put millions of people out of work. The technology will track shoppers’ movements and what products they grab and then automatically charge the shopper’s Amazon account when they leave — no waiting in line for a checkout. \nFor those who dread waiting in long store lines, this could be a godsend, but as with most technological blessings, there is a curse as well. All of those store clerks will need to find new jobs if this tech takes flight. \nThe concept has already been applied at the Amazon headquarters in Seattle where people can purchase meals and snacks. It’s in the testing phase exclusively offered to Amazon employees but will expand for other consumers in 2017. \nAlthough it may take years for the advancement to impact workers, all we need to do is look back to the time before item scanners were widely used to see how technology spreads. The question is not if automation will reduce the demand for workers, but how soon. Rate this story",

      "text": "NEW YORK (REUTERS) - Amazon.com said on Monday (Dec 5) it has opened a brick-and-mortar grocery store in Seattle without lines or checkout counters, kicking off new competition with supermarket chains.\nAmazon Go, the online shopping company's new 167 sq m store, uses sensors to detect what items shoppers have picked off the shelves and sends a bill to their Amazon accounts if they do not replace them.\nThe store marks Amazon's latest push into groceries, one of the biggest retail categories it has yet to master. The company currently delivers produce and groceries to homes through its AmazonFresh service.\n\"It's a great recognition that their e-commerce model doesn't work for every product,\" said analyst Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research, noting that physical stores would complement AmazonFresh.\n\"If there were hundreds of these stores around the country, it would be a huge threat\" to supermarket chains, he said.\nThe S&P 1500 food retail index, which includes Kroger, Whole Foods Market and other companies, was down 0.5 per cent at the close. Shares of Amazon closed up about 2.6 per cent.\nAmazon Go is available now for employees of the company and is expected to be open to the public early next year, Amazon said.\nIf tests are successful, Amazon plans to open more than 2,000 grocery stores, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday, citing sources. The company is considering other store formats, including one that would let drivers pick up goods at the curbside, the report said.\nAmazon declined to comment on the report.\n\"The checkout lines are always the most inefficient parts of the store experience,\" said Mr Neil Saunders, managing director of retail research firm Conlumino. \"Not only would you save a lot on labour costs, you actually would make the process much quicker for consumers and much more satisfying.\"\nStill, the grab-and-go experience would take getting used to, he said.\nSome people may \"feel like they stole\" an item, Mr Saunders said.\nApart from groceries such as bread and milk, the store also offers ready-to-eat meals made fresh by on-site chefs and local kitchens and bakeries, Amazon said.\nThat would make Amazon Go a potential competitor to fast-casual dining chains like Chipotle Mexican Grill as well.\nAmazon Go is not the first physical store for the e-commerce company to open.\nIt has a book store in Seattle, as well as pop-ups at malls where it displays Amazon devices such as the Kindle.\nTopics:  AMAZON SUPERMARKETS  //str.sg/4AkM Copy",

But the key selling point is what it doesn't have: checkout lines. From Amazon Previous Next \nNEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Amazon has gone after book stores, retail chains and electronics shops. Now it's taking on grocery stores, with a twist. \nAmazon unveiled in a video a new physical store on Monday that sells a mix of \"grocery essentials\" and ready-made meals. But the key selling point is what it doesn't have: checkout lines. \nThe video shows how customers check in at the entrance of the store with a new app called Amazon Go, then grab whatever items are needed. Amazon claims it can track the items automatically through a combination of computer vision and deep learning technologies. When you're done shopping, you just walk out. \nThe first store is located in Seattle, where Amazon is headquartered. \nFor years, there have been rumors the e-commerce company would expand its dominance from digital to physical shopping. Amazon began experimenting with physical bookstores a year ago, but Amazon Go may mark its boldest bet on bricks-and-mortar yet. \nBy eliminating much of the staff needed to operate a store, Amazon keeps costs lower than traditional competitors. It's also in a strong position to bring together data on its customers shopping habits online and offline to make better suggestions in all situations. \nHowever, Amazon's move deeper into physical retail shops comes in a sensitive political climate. The company could be perceived as being a threat to some of the 3.4 million Americans who work as cashiers, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. \nOn the campaign trail, Donald Trump repeatedly criticized Amazon and its founder Jeff Bezos for \"getting away with murder tax-wise\" and having \"a huge antitrust problem.\" Will the President-elect add \"job killer\" to the list of criticisms? \nAmazon's effort to launch a new kind of retail store predates the rise of Donald Trump. \n\"Four years ago we asked ourselves: what if we could create a shopping experience with no lines and no checkout? Could we push the boundaries of computer vision and machine learning to create a store where customers could simply take what they want and go?\" the company says on an informational page about Amazon Go. \nFor now, Amazon is starting slow. The first store is only open to Amazon employees and will not be an option for the general public until early next year. \nThe-CNN-Wire ",

      "text": "By now, you've probably seen the new video for Amazon Go, the e-commerce store's first physical grocery store that comes with no cashiers or check out lines.\nBut if you've followed Amazon closely, you've probably noticed the store is missing one of the most important parts about Amazon's retail strategy: Prime benefits.\nPrime, Amazon's annual membership program, gives access to free two-day shipping and a bunch of other services, such as Prime Video and Music. Amazon has increased the number of Prime perks lately in hopes of attracting more members, as it became clear that Prime members tend to spend more on Amazon than non-Prime members .\nOddly, Amazon is not giving any privilege to its Prime members in the new grocery stores, which is easily one of the biggest retail initiatives the company has taken in years. The Amazon bookstore, which launched last year, for example, offers discount prices only to Prime members .\nInternal debate When Business Insider first reported in October that Amazon sees potential for up to 2,000 grocery stores in the US , Prime was mentioned as one of the key discussion points internally. Amazon management wrestled with the question of making the grocery stores Prime-exclusive or open to the general public because of the different cost benefits, according to documents we've seen. The WSJ previously reported that the new grocery stores would be Prime-only.\nCowen & Co.'s analyst John Blackledge suggested Amazon might add those benefits in the future, and is simply trying to first gain mindshare in the grocery space for now. There's certainly precedence: Amazon bookstores introduced the Prime-only discounts almost a year after opening.\n\"Amazon’s doing a lot of things to increase conversion of Prime members, so this might be a way to first expand their customer base and then overtime, convert non-Prime members to Prime members,\" Blackledge told Business Insider.\nThat means Amazon may see its brick-and-mortar grocery stores as a means to expand its share of the massive $800 billion grocery market, instead of a channel to attract more Amazon Prime members. According to Blackledge, Walmart (in combination with Sam's Club) is the leader with a 21% share in the grocery market, while Amazon is outside of the top 20 with just 0.8% share, as of last year, and is expected to be 7th largest by 2021.\nAmazon \nPerhaps what's more striking is that Amazon is indeed doubling down on its brick-and-mortar strategy. From bookstores last year to pop-up stores this year, and now a grocery store, Amazon has been aggressively expanding its presence in the physical space.\nThat's in stark contrast to what Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos said about retail stores just 9 years ago. In a shareholder letter published in 2007 , Bezos wrote that he gets asked a lot about opening physical stores but it's an idea he's resisted.\n\"The potential size of a network of physical stores is exciting. However: we don’t know how to do it with low capital and high returns; physical-world retailing is a cagey and ancient business that’s already well served; and we don’t have any ideas for how to build a physical world store experience that’s meaningfully differentiated for customers,\" Bezos wrote at the time.\nAfter nearly a decade, Amazon seems to have cracked the code on how to answer all those questions. \nNOW WATCH: These size comparisons show the true scale of enormous things \n",

      "text": "print Amazon \nBy now, you've probably seen the new video for Amazon Go , the e-commerce store's first physical grocery store that comes with no cashiers or check out lines. \nBut if you've followed Amazon closely, you've probably noticed the store is missing one of the most important parts about Amazon's retail strategy: Prime benefits. \nPrime, Amazon's annual membership program, gives access to free two-day shipping and a bunch of other services, such as Prime Video and Music. Amazon has increased the number of Prime perks lately in hopes of attracting more members, as it became clear that Prime members tend to spend more on Amazon than non-Prime members . \nOddly, Amazon is not giving any privilege to its Prime members in the new grocery stores, which is easily one of the biggest retail initiatives the company has taken in years. The Amazon bookstore, which launched last year, for example, offers discount prices only to Prime members . Internal debate \nWhen Business Insider first reported in October that Amazon sees potential for up to 2,000 grocery stores in the US , Prime was mentioned as one of the key discussion points internally. Amazon management wrestled with the question of making the grocery stores Prime-exclusive or open to the general public because of the different cost benefits, according to documents we've seen. The WSJ previously reported that the new grocery stores would be Prime-only. \nCowen & Co.'s analyst John Blackledge suggested Amazon might add those benefits in the future, and is simply trying to first gain mindshare in the grocery space for now. There's certainly precedence: Amazon bookstores introduced the Prime-only discounts almost a year after opening. \n\"Amazon’s doing a lot of things to increase conversion of Prime members, so this might be a way to first expand their customer base and then overtime, convert non-Prime members to Prime members,\" Blackledge told Business Insider. \nThat means Amazon may see its brick-and-mortar grocery stores as a means to expand its share of the massive $800 billion grocery market, instead of a channel to attract more Amazon Prime members. According to Blackledge, Walmart (in combination with Sam's Club) is the leader with a 21% share in the grocery market, while Amazon is outside of the top 20 with just 0.8% share, as of last year, and is expected to be 7th largest by 2021. \nCowen & Co. \nPerhaps what's more striking is that Amazon is indeed doubling down on its brick-and-mortar strategy. From bookstores last year to pop-up stores this year, and now a grocery store, Amazon has been aggressively expanding its presence in the physical space. \nThat's in stark contrast to what Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos said about retail stores just 9 years ago. In a shareholder letter published in 2007 , Bezos wrote that he gets asked a lot about opening physical stores but it's an idea he's resisted. \n\"The potential size of a network of physical stores is exciting. However: we don’t know how to do it with low capital and high returns; physical-world retailing is a cagey and ancient business that’s already well served; and we don’t have any ideas for how to build a physical world store experience that’s meaningfully differentiated for customers,\" Bezos wrote at the time. \nAfter nearly a decade, Amazon seems to have cracked the code on how to answer all those questions. Disclosure: Jeff Bezos is an investor in Business Insider through his personal investment company Bezos Expeditions.",

AFP \nSAN FRANCISCO, United States — Amazon on Monday unveiled a new kind of retail store, with no cashiers. \nIn the concept store in Amazon’s hometown of Seattle, Washington, customers can fill their shopping carts and walk out — with the costs tallied up and billed on their accounts with the US online giant. \nAmazon Go, which is being tested in a single store with Amazon employees and will open to the public next year, is a “checkout-free shopping experience made possible by the same types of technologies used in self-driving cars: computer vision, sensor fusion, and deep learning,” its web page says. ADVERTISEMENT \n“Our Just Walk Out technology automatically detects when products are taken from or returned to the shelves and keeps track of them in a virtual cart. When you’re done shopping, you can just leave the store. Shortly after, we’ll charge your Amazon account and send you a receipt.” \nThe store in Seattle of some 170 square meters (1,800 square feet) is selling a variety of food products including breads, cheeses and ready-to-eat meals, as well as Amazon Meal Kits, which has the ingredients for home-cooked dishes. \nIt was not immediately clear whether Amazon will expand this model with more physical stores or offer the technology to other retailers. \nThe online giant has been rumored to be looking at creating brick-and-mortar outlets but so far has only announced a handful of bookselling outlets.

      "text": "San Francisco (AFP) - Amazon on Monday unveiled a new kind of retail store, with no cashiers. In the concept store in Amazon's hometown of Seattle, Washington, customers can fill their shopping carts and walk out -- with the costs tallied up and billed on their accounts with the US online giant.\nAmazon Go, which is being tested in a single store with Amazon employees and will open to the public next year, is a \"checkout-free shopping experience made possible by the same types of technologies used in self-driving cars: computer vision, sensor fusion, and deep learning,\" its web page says.\n\"Our Just Walk Out technology automatically detects when products are taken from or returned to the shelves and keeps track of them in a virtual cart. When you're done shopping, you can just leave the store. Shortly after, we'll charge your Amazon account and send you a receipt.\"\nThe store in Seattle of some 170 square meters (1,800 square feet) is selling a variety of food products including breads, cheeses and ready-to-eat meals, as well as Amazon Meal Kits, which has the ingredients for home-cooked dishes.\nIt was not immediately clear whether Amazon will expand this model with more physical stores or offer the technology to other retailers.\nThe online giant has been rumored to be looking at creating brick-and-mortar outlets but so far has only announced a handful of bookselling outlets.",

      "text": "share this share this \nWe should have seen this coming. Amazon has announced \"Just Walk Out\" technology, which will power the future of brick-and-mortar shopping if it catches on - and really, how could it not? Let's back up. \nAmazon Go is roughly 1,800 square feet of retail space that allows shoppers to use their Amazon Go app as admittance into the store (like a subway turnstile), where they can pick up any item(s) they want and walk out of the store without talking or transacting with anyone ( watch the video ). The Just Walk Out technology automatically detects when products are taken from or returned to the shelves and keeps track of them in a virtual cart. When a person is done shopping, they can just leave the store. Shortly after, their Amazon account will be charged and they'll receive a receipt (kind of like Uber in that regard where no money is exchanged with the driver himself/herself). \nAmazon Go is currently open to Amazon employees in the company's Beta program, and will open to the public in early 2017. It's currently a real experience with a real address (2131 7th Ave, Seattle, WA) though. \nThese \"smart shelves\" have been around for a while. SAP Hybris, for instance, previewed its working model of this concept at its annual user conference this year. When people pick up a beer bottle (as the technology was set up for this example) and place it near their phone, they are given a profile of their beverage choice. To get personalized suggestions, they can even fill out a mobile quiz prior. Some of the smart elements of this idea (and Amazon's) is that more and more people want to help themselves, whether it's making an appointment online themselves, looking to question-and-answer technology to find answers without assistance, accessing a customer portal to find information related to them or any other scenario where they self-help, customers want to get things done without brand intervention (because if they're involved, something has likely gone wrong). \nAmazon Go takes this trend 10 steps further and will likely corner this market (pun not intended) for years to come as many, many grocers are far behind with their technology as it is. Amazon is uniquely positioned to create the system that can make order data, transaction information, payment processing, inventory control, mobile technology and more all work together in a seamless way. What's more, Amazon can now have an incredible 360-view of a customer with a person's everyday habits like picking up a veggie sandwich for lunch because they work nearby and then going home to push their Dash button to refill their laundry detergent while shopping for gifts (and anything else) using Prime. The collecting and leveraging of customer data for personalized experiences, recommendations, merchandising (like why did a person lift up an item but not buy it) and to prevent churn (particularly for Prime) will be very interesting to watch.",

      "text": "share this \nConsumers trust the reviews they encounter on the Web. A recent Nielsen study, in fact, indicates that 66 percent of people actually trust online product reviews above all other sources and 84 percent trust them as much as a personal recommendation from a friend. As a result, there has been some motivation to influence consumers with reviews that aren't actually real. SUBSCRIBE to Website Magazine & Accelerate 'Net Success \nThis has forced marketplaces like Amazon to regularly monitor the integrity of the reviews on their own platforms and develop policies to prevent fakes from influencing customers. \nThe company has actually taken steps over the past year to prevent trouble from arising. Earlier in the year for example Amazon brought legal action against over 1,000 sellers soliciting fake reviews and this past week introduces new rules that will govern \"incentives\" reviews and start restricting how many \"non-verified\" reviews a user can have. And now, the world's largest online marketplace is again cracking down announcing several new rules related to fake reviews. Under Amazon’s new rules, for example, users can leave only five reviews per week on products that they did not purchase on the site (previously, this was unlimited). Any user can still review any product, regardless of whether they purchased it on Amazon or not, but users can’t review products in masse now (which also makes it more difficult for sellers to purchase reviews from third parties). In the past, Amazon has allowed their sellers to offer discounted or even completely free products as long as the receiving user left a review, and clearly stated they had received the product at a discount. Amazon’s objective here is to ensure that their users can trust the reviews they find on the site. By reducing the number of fake reviews overall, it keeps the marketplace fair for all sellers.",

If you read the sales pitch you will see this;- How does this Salter scale work? This Salter scale uses BIA (Bio Impedance Analysis) technology which passes a tiny electrical impulse through the body to determine fat from lean tissue, the electrical impulse cannot be felt and is perfectly safe. Contact with the body is made via stainless steel pads on the platform of the scale (or an almost invisible ITO coating on the surface of the glass*).This method simultaneously calculates your personal weight, BMI, body fat, total body water and muscle mass, giving you a more accurate reading of your overall health and fitness.",

      "text": "REUTERS: Amazon.com Inc said on Monday it has opened a brick-and-mortar grocery store in Seattle without lines or checkout counters, kicking off new competition with supermarket chains.\nAmazon Go, the online shopping company's new 1,800-square-foot (167-square-meter) store, uses sensors to detect what items shoppers have picked off the shelves and sends a bill to their Amazon accounts if they do not replace them.\nThe store marks Amazon's latest push into groceries, one of the biggest retail categories it has yet to master. The company currently delivers produce and groceries to homes through its AmazonFresh service.\n\"It’s a great recognition that their e-commerce model doesn’t work for every product,\" said analyst Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research, noting that physical stores would complement AmazonFresh.\n\"If there were hundreds of these stores around the country, it would be a huge threat\" to supermarket chains, he said.\nThe S&P 1500 food retail index , which includes Kroger Co , Whole Foods Market Inc and other companies, was down 0.5 percent at the close. Shares of Amazon closed up about 2.6 percent.\nAmazon Go is available now for employees of the company and is expected to be open to the public early next year, Amazon said.\nIf tests are successful, Amazon plans to open more than 2,000 grocery stores, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday, citing sources. The company is considering other store formats, including one that would let drivers pick up goods at the curbside, the report said.\nAmazon declined to comment on the report.\n\"The checkout lines are always the most inefficient parts of the store experience,\" said Neil Saunders, managing director of retail research firm Conlumino. \"Not only would you save a lot on labour costs, you actually would make the process much quicker for consumers and much more satisfying.\"\nStill, the grab-and-go experience would take getting used to, he said.\nSome people may \"feel like they stole\" an item, Saunders said.\nApart from groceries such as bread and milk, the store also offers ready-to-eat meals made fresh by on-site chefs and local kitchens and bakeries, Amazon said.\nThat would make Amazon Go a potential competitor to fast-casual dining chains like Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc as well.\nAmazon Go is not the first physical store for the e-commerce company to open.\nIt has a book store in Seattle, as well as pop-ups at malls where it displays Amazon devices such as the Kindle.\n(Reporting by Narottam Medhora in Bengaluru and Jeffrey Dastin in New York; Additional reporting by Lewis Krauskopf in New York; Editing by Andrew Hay and Matthew Lewis)\n ",

      "text": "While the e-commerce world has been waiting to see what unexpected grocery tricks Amazon has up its online sleeve, it pulled a fast one, announcing plans for Amazon Go, a brick-and-mortar supermarket with no lines and no checkout.\nMaking its announcement via a how-it-works video , the company says the first store is slated to open in Seattle this spring. Its “Just walk out” technology, which allows consumers to simply toss items in their bag and then leave, is based on the latest in computer vision, sensor fusion, and deep learning. “Four years ago we asked ourselves, 'What if we could create a shopping experience with no lines and no checkout? Could we push the boundaries of computer vision and machine learning to create a store where customers could simply take what they want and go?” it says in its announcement.\nThe news surprised industry observers, who have long been watching Amazon’s efforts to take online grocery shopping mainstream, including Amazon Fresh. Back in October, reports circulated that it intended to open 20 pilot grocery stores in the next two years, and that it believes it could open 2,000 over the next decade, but many expected they would function mainly as pickup spots for online orders. \n“It’s a great example of how technology is not just an enabler of online shopping, but a way to change physical shopping too,” says Bill Bishop, chief architect of Brick Meets Click, A Barrington, Ill.-based retail consultancy.\nA big question is what consumers—who have only ever met Amazon online—will expect when walking into a physical store. It’s likely to be very different, he predicts. “Every supermarket you’ve ever been in represents the legacy of the last 75 years of supermarkets,” he tells Marketing Daily . “They’ve gotten bigger and bigger, and variety has been extended.”\nHe expects Amazon Go will be radically smaller. Instead of 30,000 items, he predicts it will have more like 3,500, “like a typical Trader Joe’s.” And instead of 40,000 square feet, it’s more apt to be 16,000 or so. And he bets variety will be limited to a national brand and a private label.\nHe thinks Amazon can even handle the problem of perishable foods with quick replenishment and satisfaction guarantees. “It all comes down to trust,” he says. “If Amazon can tell people that asparagus or seafood is fresh and has a meaningful guarantee in place, people will trust them.”\nWith substantially fewer items, smaller stores, shelf technology to know exactly which items sell fastest and high private label sales, it could potentially have higher sales per square foot and higher profits, in an industry known for its razor-thin margins.\nOf course, it’s also possible Amazon isn’t all that concerned about profits, at least in the early phases. “What Amazon has done well historically is test and optimize and scale in order to reduce customer pain points,” says Tom Caporaso, CEO of Clarus Commerce, based in Rocky Hill, Conn. “It’s gone down some interesting roads before, but the more services it puts out there, they more it pulls you into the Amazon ecosystem. If you’re using Amazon Prime, ordering through Amazon Echo, watching movies, and now using Amazon Go and that app, these are all just multiple ways it can stay connected.”\nFood represents an enormous opportunity: Total supermarket sales hit $649.1 billion in 2015, according to the Food Marketing Institute.\nWhile plenty of observers took to Twitter to hail the news as game changing and genius, others pointed out some downsides. “That’s 3.4 million American jobs lost in a minute,” said one. “Amazon to take the jobs of hard-working self-checkout machine manufacturers,” joked another.\nBut Caporaso expects it to be a hit: “This is really an amazing next step in retail.”",

      "text": "Get Unlimited Digital Access Your first month is less than a dollar. $0.99 for first 4 weeks Subscribe Now \nAmazon has created an advanced shopping technology that it's testing in Seattle. It turns the traditional convenience store into a grab-and-go experience. Amazon said Monday that its checkout-free shopping experience is made possible by the same types of technologies used in self-driving cars. \nWatch the video to see what it calls \"just walk out\" technology. Amazon has published a link with more details. \nThe Seattle Times published a story this morning about the 1,800 square-foot store officially called \"Amazon Go.\" Amazon employees are participating in a test of the store. It's expected to open to the public in early 2017. \nAmazon didn't address the possible theft issues or whether there's a roll out planned beyond the one store. \nRegardless, it's clear why analysts are calling it a game changer. \nNeil Stern, a senior partner at Chicago-based retail consulting firm McMillan Doolittle summed up what it means in a column in Forbes today: \nThe proposition for the consumer is simple--save time and hassle. The proposition for retailers may be even more compelling--save labor on the biggest component of the store (the front end) as well as improve throughput. In an era where labor costs are increasing and labor availability is scarce, this becomes an incredibly compelling one-two combination. \nThis isn't Amazon's first store. It has opened three bookstores, a couple electronics stores and kiosks and reportedly has plans for a couple thousand grocery order pick-up stores.",

      "text": "increase font size Amazon to introduce no-checkout grocery store in Seattle The Internet giant is taking on food retailers with a high-tech experience that could alter industry practices. By Sarah Halzack The Washington Post Share Read Article \nAmazon on Monday revealed that it will open a brick-and-mortar grocery store called Amazon Go, an ambitious bid by the once online-only retailer to gobble up more of Americans’ shopping dollars by taking the fight more directly to traditional supermarkets and big-box stores. \nThe store will be powered by a web of technology that allows customers to fill up their shopping bags and walk out without going through a checkout process, a concept that has long been discussed in the retail industry but that has not been implemented at any major U.S. stores. The idea is that it will shave time off the shopping experience. \nHere’s how Amazon Go will work: Customers download an app and then swipe their smartphones as they walk through the store’s entrance. Then they just start picking up groceries. In a process that the company does not describe except to say that it involves such capabilities as computer vision, machine learning and artificial intelligence, every item the shoppers tuck into their bags or carts is tracked on the phone. If an item is put back on the shelf, it’s deleted. As the shoppers exit, their total bill is calculated, a digital receipt appears on their phones and their Amazon account is charged. A video produced by the company offers some visuals that might help you imagine what that will look like. \nThe store is set to open in Seattle, Amazon’s hometown, in early 2017. And its arrival could end up posing some critical questions for the wider retail industry. For starters, Amazon Go will probably need fewer workers than traditional stores that rely on cashiers and clerks. If shoppers respond favorably to this low-touch customer service model, it might end up encouraging other chains to give similar setups a try and save labor costs. \nIf Amazon Go is successful and is expanded widely, it could put serious competitive pressure on a wide range of retailers. For starters, at just 1,800 square feet, Amazon Go looks to be targeting so-called fill-in trips, the kind of quick errand a shopper does when he or she just needs a couple of items. In recent years, drug stores and convenience stores have proved to be potent competitors to supermarkets for these kinds of shopping trips. So a fast-growing Amazon Go could present competition for chains such as CVS and 7-Eleven. And judging from the look of the store as seen in Amazon’s video, it will have an ambiance and selection that will put it up against Kroger or Whole Foods Market. \nThe company is promising to sell prepared foods made by “on-site chefs,” meaning it will be fighting for the same breakfast, lunch and dinner spending that fast-casual and carryout restaurants currently vie for. Amazon Go also plans to sell pre-packaged meal kits that contain ingredients to make a home-cooked dinner for two. That could produce new competition for the wave of meal kit start-ups such as Blue Apron, HelloFresh and Purple Carrot. \nAmazon’s decision to sell groceries in physical stores would seem to be an acknowledgment of how hard it has proven to sell these kinds of goods on the Internet. Despite the explosive growth of e-commerce overall, grocery has largely remained an old-school business, with less than 2 percent of sales taking place online. \nAnd Amazon Go will face no shortage of challenges as it aims to transform the model. Filling up one’s refrigerator has long been a convenience-centric errand, one in which the closest store to your house is often the one that gets your money. It will take a long time – and gobs of money – for Amazon to build out that kind of store network. And it’s not a sure thing that what it calls “Just Walk Out technology” will win customers over. What if it turns out to be buggy? What if some shoppers find it off-putting and impersonal? \nMajor grocers were likely not shocked by Amazon’s announcement: Rumors have been circulating for months that the company planned to open brick-and-mortar stores that sold food. And the e-commerce company has already shown interest in physical retailing by opening bookstores. So, in theory, legacy chains have been preparing for Amazon to try to encroach on their turf.

      "text": "Holiday Buyer's Guide 4 common Amazon Echo problems and how to fix them Amazon's Echo, Tap and Dot speakers are featured-packed and constantly improving, but they're not perfect. Here are some common problems with the connected speakers and how to fix them. Up Next Memes that need to die along with 2016 4 common Amazon Alexa problems and how to fix them Amazon's Echo, Echo Dot and Tap speakers are loaded with features, plus they are virtually maintenance-free. But things don't always go to plan. Here are some common problems with the Alexa speakers and how to fix them. by Taylor Martin Close Drag \nWhen they work as intended, Amazon's Echo , Dot and Tap speakers are quite impressive and save the hassle of having to whip out a phone to change the color of smart lights or the temperature setting of the thermostat. \nBut things don't always go as planned and Amazon didn't create a truly flawless product. Alexa has issues of its own. Here are some of the most common Alexa problems and how to fix them. How the light ring works \nThe vast majority of the time, Alexa sits around completely dormant with no status indicators until called upon. But the ring around the top of the Echo and Echo Dot lights up in six colors, which indicate five different things. Enlarge Image Photo by Sarah Tew/CNET Cyan and royal blue are used together. They spin and flash after the wake word is spoken, during your command and throughout Alexa's response. These also appear during the boot process. Red means you've activated the mute switch on top of the speaker. Orange means the device is trying to connect to the wireless network. Violet appears when a problem occurs during Wi-Fi setup. White is used to indicate the volume level when you either manually turn the volume ring or change the volume by voice. \nThe status indicator is a little different on the Amazon Tap. It comes in the form of five tiny LEDs along the top front edge of the speaker. Photo by Chris Monroe/CNET The lights pulse cyan and blue while powering up. They shine cyan when you press the microphone button and speak a command and pulse while Alexa processes the command. Pulsing red lights mean Alexa could not complete or process your command. Pulsing amber lights from left to right mean the speaker is in setup mode, waiting for you to pair it with a network using the Alexa app. Pulsing blue lights mean the speaker is in Bluetooth pairing mode. Problems with Alexa 4 common Amazon Alexa problems and how to fix them Amazon's Echo, Echo Dot and Tap speakers are loaded with features, plus they are virtually maintenance-free. But things don't always go to plan. Here are some common problems with the Alexa speakers and how to fix them. by Taylor Martin Close Drag \nIn my time with the Amazon Echo, I've had very few problems, most of which were very easily resolved with a power cycle and a few simple tweaks or adjustments. Here are some solutions to problems you may encounter. Alexa cannot find your smart-home devices Photo by Chris Monroe/CNET \nIf you are trying to add smart-home devices to your Alexa speaker, first check to make sure the device you want to add is natively supported . That list is constantly growing, including devices like the Ecobee3 and lines from companies such as Honeywell, Insteon, Lifx, Nest, Philips Hue and Wink. However, far more devices have added official Alexa support by way of Skills . \nTo add a new device, open the Alexa app, navigate to Smart Home and tap Discover devices under the Your Devices section. Even if your devices aren't natively supported and don't have Skills, you're not entirely out of luck. Alexa has an official IFTTT channel and also integrates with Yonomi , both of which have an extensive list of supported smart-home devices. \nIf you've already added your devices but Alexa cannot seem to connect to them, there are at least two possible solutions. Check the command you're using, aka your invocation. The commands vary a lot between different devices, Skills and a connected service like IFTTT. They can be oddly specific commands, and small differences in the phrasing or names of the devices can throw Alexa for a loop. Some smart-home devices have trouble staying connected due to software problems, crowded networks, being always on or other issues. My Lifx bulbs go offline every few days, rendering any commands I issue to Alexa useless. A simple power cycle of the connected devices (in my case, a flip of the light switch) will usually fix any connectivity problems you're having. \nIf that doesn't fix the issue, try rebooting the speaker as well as removing the device and adding it once more from scratch. Frequent disconnects from the wireless network \nIf the Echo, Echo Dot or Tap isn't staying connected to your network consistently enough, there are a few guidelines you can follow to try and improve connectivity . \nFirst, power-cycle everything -- the router, modem and Alexa speaker. After that, try streaming audio for a few minutes to see if the issue arises again. If so, attempt to move the speaker away from other devices, preferably closer to the router, and try switching the speaker to a 5GHz channel to decrease interference. Alexa is no longer hearing you properly \nOver time, you might notice that the Alexa speakers seem not to hear you as well as they once did. \nTry not to crowd the speakers. Leave at least 8 inches (20.3 centimeters) of space around them. \nAgain, a great place to start is turning the speaker off and on again. If this doesn't fix the issue, try moving the speaker away from obstructions and at least 8 inches (20.3 centimeters) from the wall. \nIn recent months, I've noticed that my Echo has more and more trouble hearing me than it did when I first bought it. Then it dawned on me. I bought the Echo when it was still winter. We're now halfway through summer and my air conditioning is running constantly. It's loud and significantly raises the ambient noise level in the room. Before I moved it, the Echo was also positioned near the cold air return, and when the AC was on, I had to project my voice for the speaker to hear the wake word. When the AC was off or I moved it away from the vent, I found Alexa had no trouble hearing me speak normally from nearly 20 feet (6 meters) away. \nIn other words, if you have any noisy appliances, move the Alexa speaker away from those to reduce the ambient noise level. \nAdditionally, you can use Voice Training , which is under Settings in the Alexa app. You'll read 25 phrases aloud in a \"typical voice from a typical distance\" so Alexa can better understand you. Accidental activation \nIf you're a fan of the television show \" Mr. Robot ,\" you likely caught the Amazon Echo mentions in episode 3 of the second season. If your speaker is anywhere near your television, watching this episode, or anything with lines that sound similar to the default wake word, may activate your speaker. \nIt's harmless, but it's still a nuisance when Alexa starts speaking unwanted responses over the TV show you're trying to watch. There are three things you can do to minimize this: Move the speaker farther from the television. Press the mute switch on top while watching TV. Change the wake word from the default \"Alexa\" to either \"Echo\" or \"Amazon.\" \nVoice activation is an area where Amazon could stand to make some general improvements, such as learning a specific person's voice (a la Motorola's Trusted Voice feature) or permitting custom wake words.

      "text": "Amazon Revolutionized Grocery Shopping — and No, It's Not a Delivery Service December 5, 2016 by Erin Cullum 0 Shares \nAmazon is eliminating checkout lines and making grocery shopping faster than ever with its newest business venture, Amazon Go . It's an actual grocery store that you walk into, browse and pick up items from shelves, and then . . . walk straight out without paying at a register. \"Four years ago, we started to wonder, 'what would shopping look like if you could walk into a store, grab what you want, and just go?'\" the narrator of the Amazon Go tutorial video explained. \nHow does it work? To enter the store, you just have to scan your Amazon Go app at the entrance. Amazon detects and records items automatically every time you pick something up or put it back down — you don't even have to scan the grocery items on your app. Once you walk out of the store, your Amazon account is charged and you'll receive a receipt on your app. \"We used senior fusion, much like you'd find in self-driving cars,\" the video noted. Kind of like being charged for Uber or Lyft without swiping your card, the Amazon Go process allows you to leave the store as soon as you're done shopping, avoiding the checkout process altogether. \nFor now, the sole Amazon Go is located in Seattle and is only open to Amazon employees, but according to the company, the store will be open to the public in early 2017. If you (like me) delight in the idea of going grocery shopping without making small talk or waiting in long lines, let's hope this idea catches on fast. Related:",

      "title": "Wal-Mart vs. Amazon: Is India The Next Battleground?",
      "text": "Amazon is on overdrive in India. Earlier this year, the world’s largest online retailer became the second-largest online marketplace in the country by shipments and gross merchandise value. (Flipkart remains number one in India.) It also announced an additional $3 billion investment, taking its total investment in India to $5 billion; it launched its popular subscription-based program Amazon Prime to drive customer loyalty; and it announced that it would be soon be introducing its Prime Video service . Recently, in October, the firm launched its “Global Store” for Indian customers enabling them to buy products sold on its U.S. website while paying in Indian currency. Prior to this, while customers from India could buy on Amazon’s U.S. website, they had to pay in dollars.\n\nWal-Mart vs Amazon Amit Agarwal, Amazon India’s vice president and country head, says that “enhancing shopping experience” for customers is “one of the key pillars” for the company. With the Global Store, customers in India will have direct access to thousands of international brands and a starting selection of over 4 million global products. While initially the Global Store will have products from the U.S., over time, products from other key markets such as the U.K., Germany and Japan are also expected to be listed. India, which is one of the fastest growing e-tail markets around the globe, is the third country after China and Mexico to get the Amazon Global Store. This move will no doubt help Amazon compete more vigorously against Flipkart.\nMore importantly, perhaps, it will also help strengthen the company’s arsenal against the imminent entry of Wal-Mart — the world’s largest brick-and-mortar retailer and its arch rival.\nAmazon, though, is silent on Wal-Mart’s reported entry into this segment. “We are not competition-focused, but customer-obsessed,” says Agarwal. “Our goals and our targets are only focused on our building a better experience for our customers and sellers.”\nWal-Mart’s Entry: A Matter of Time According to media reports, Wal-Mart is all set to join the Indian e-tail party soon. While the company is reported to be talking to several Indian e-tailers like Snapdeal and Shopclues, the strongest buzz is around Wal-Mart entering into a strategic alliance with Flipkart or making an investment in the company , possibly to the tune of $1 billion . While both Wal-Mart and Flipkart refuse to comment on what they term as “speculations,” Rajneesh Kumar, senior vice president and head of corporate affairs at Wal-Mart India, says: “E-tail is undeniably a very big change and is here to stay. Understandably, that is where the consumer is going. We believe the next five years will belong to those who commit to provide an omni-channel experience to customers.”\n“Think of it as an alliance of the ‘Amazon-worrieds.’” – Kartik Hosanagar \nWal-Mart currently has 21 cash & carry wholesale format stores, called Best Price, across nine states in India. This number is expected to increase to 70 over the next three to five years. According to Kumar, currently all stores (which are open only to commercial and institutional customers) provide an o mni-channel shopping experience to the members. “B2B e-commerce is a major driver of growth for us in India,” says Kumar. He adds: “For us, India is a long-term commitment. It is a growing economy and hence an important market. We continue to look at all opportunities and keep scanning the business environment on how we can serve our business members better.”\nIndustry observers and experts believe that it is only a matter of time before Wal-Mart makes a foray into online retail in India through some kind of an investment or partnership with a leading Indian e-tailer. Kartik Hosanagar, Wharton’s professor of operations, information and decisions, whose research focuses on the digital economy, in particular Internet media, Internet marketing and e-commerce, notes: “Wal-Mart has been interested in India for quite some time now. They explored a partnership with Bharti but that fell through. [In 2007, Walmart had entered into a 50:50 joint venture with Bharti Enterprises. The partnership broke off in 2013.] Internet companies that are more used to a different pace and greater transparency are a better partner for Wal-Mart.”\nHosanagar believes that Wal-Mart’s India strategy will borrow heavily from its China experience: It will “partner with local companies that have better local knowledge.” He points out that in China, Wal-Mart started with a small investment in Yihaodian. Later, it purchased Yihaodian in its entirety. And more recently, it has partnered with JD.com, including selling Yihaodian to JD.com. “This way, it has partnered with China’s second largest e-commerce company to take on Alibaba (the e-commerce leader in China). This also allows Wal-Mart to focus on its offline stores and simply set up an online store on JD.com.”\nHosanagar also points to Wal-Mart’s recent acquisition of Jet.com in the U.S. for $3.3 billion. He notes that even though Jet.com is unproven, Wal-Mart was willing to pay a considerable amount because “it finally found a proven [individual, Jet.com co-founder] Marc Lore, who is willing and capable of taking on Amazon.com.” A partnership with a player like Flipkart will seek to do the same in India, says Hosanagar. “Think of it as an alliance of the ‘Amazon-worrieds.’”\nAnkur Bisen, senior vice president for retail at Technopak Advisors, considers Wal-Mart’s reported moves in India to be in line with its global strategy. He says: “With the acquisition of Jet.com in the U.S., Wal-Mart has put e-commerce at the heart of its growth strategy. It wants to protect its status as a dominant global retailer and recognizes the need to align with the rapidly changing world of retail. It also signals that it will not shy away from either building this capability in-house or pursuing acquisition opportunities, or both.” In India, Bisen notes, Wal-Mart has organically built a cash & carry business that has “grown reasonably well” and has also started piloting “multi-channel options” in this business. Says Bisen: “This is in line with Wal-Mart’s global approach of re-modeling brick businesses into multi-channel businesses.”\nRishikesha Krishnan , professor of corporate strategy and policy at the Indian Institute of Management (IIM) Bangalore and currently director of IIM Indore, sees Wal-Mart partnering with Flipkart as a logical move. The current policy environment in India is not conducive for Wal-Mart to make a direct entry into physical retail.

There seems to be a supply for all sizes except medium. I would probably not buy this for $30, but at $10 this seems to be a steal for decent basketball shorts. The waist section has a drawstring to adjust for tightening as needed.\n\nI will go ahead and say that this has very little reviews and that they were all incentivized, but the quality and sizing is up to par with my standards.\n",

      "text": "SAN FRANCISCO — Amazon is testing a grocery store in downtown Seattle that lets customers walk in, grab food from the shelves and walk out again, without ever having to stand in a checkout line. Customers tap their cell phones on a turnstile as they walk into the store, which logs them into the store's network and connects to their Amazon Prime account through an app.\nThe service is called Amazon Go. It uses machine learning, sensors and artificial intelligence to track items customers pick up. These are then added to the virtual cart on their app. If they pick up an item they later decide they don't want, putting it back on the shelf removes it from their cart.\nThe Seattle-based company calls it, \"Just walk out technology.\"\nWhen the customer leaves, the app adds up everything the customer has taken and charges their Amazon account.\nAmazon said it began to work on the project in 2012. It is currently being tested by Amazon employees at the location at 2131 7th Ave., near Amazon's offices, but will open to the public in early 2017, the company said.\nThe technology \"is amazing,\" said Phil Lempert, a food marketing expert based in Los Angeles.\nHe's even more intrigued by the multiple images of \"meal kits\" show in Amazon's video. These \"everything you need to cook a quick, high-quality dinner\" kits have become popular but the economics of delivering them has meant they're difficult to make economically viable. Stores such as Amazon Go may provide a sweet spot for them.\n\"When you look at the store itself in the video (and presumably it is the actual store) they have done a great job of merchandising and having \"meal kits\" available is simply brilliant. As the meal kit industry struggles due to the shipping/logistics aspect,\" Amazon go could be a venue where they could succeed, said Lempert.",

Amazon's new grocery store won't have any checkout lines The 1,800-square-foot Amazon Go store is currently open only to employees of the online retail giant, but the company plans to start letting the public in next year.\nAmazon will also test out “large, multifunction stores with curbside pickup capability” and “drive-through prototype locations,” sources told The Wall Street Journal (paywall). \nThe company wants to open more than 2,000 brick-and-mortar grocery stores, compared with about 2,800 operated by The Kroger Co., now the nation’s largest full-service grocery retailer.\nAmazon’s plans mark its latest push into the $800 billion-a-year grocery business, following it AmazonFresh delivery service that began expanding across the country in 2013 and arrived in New York City last year.\nIt also threatens countless jobs at grocery stores, which are the leading employers of cashiers and had 856,850 on their payrolls in May 2015, according to the latest figures from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nBritt Beamer, president of America’s Research Group, a consumer-behavior research and consulting firm, estimated that Amazon’s cutting-edge technology had the potential to wipe out 75 percent of typical grocery-store staff.\n“It’ll be a big job-killer,” Beamer said. “It’ll eliminate the cashier, it’ll get rid of the baggers, it’ll eliminate the stock clerks. This could be big.”\n\nNeil Saunders, managing director of the retail research firm Conlumino, called checkout lines “the most inefficient parts of the store experience,” and said Amazon could both “save a lot on labor costs” and “make the process much quicker for consumers and much more satisfying.”\nSaunders said the new-fangled shopping method could make people “feel like they stole” an item.\n“There is a bit of education needed for consumers,” he said.\nAn Amazon spokeswoman declined to say how the company planned to prevent shoplifting.\nThe opening of Amazon Go follows the company’s increasing use of warehouse robots and its heavily hyped scheme to deliver online purchases via a fleet of Prime Air drones, which Amazon predicts will one day “be as normal as seeing mail trucks on the road.”\nIt also comes amid growing concern over the impact of self-driving vehicle technology on the nation’s 3.5 million truckers, cabbies and other professional motorists.\nSpeaking on the technological advances at a Capitol Hill hearing last month, Sen. Jack Reed (D-RI) called such driving jobs “a ticket to the middle class” for many people without college degrees.\nSEE ALSO \nTrump's top priority is still jobs, jobs, jobs :0 President-elect Donald Trump is signaling loud and clear that he’s... Trump's top priority is still jobs, jobs, jobs “We have to make sure this technology not only enables better productivity, but doesn’t disqualify millions of Americans from good, solid jobs,” Reed warned.\nIn 2011, President Obama blamed automation for a lack of hiring.\n“There are some structural issues with our economy where a lot of businesses have learned to become much more efficient with a lot fewer workers,” he told NBC News .\n“You see it when you go to a bank and you use an ATM, you don’t go to a bank teller, or you go to the airport and you’re using a kiosk instead of checking in at the gate,” Obama said.\nIn New York City, the introduction of MetroCard vending machines led the MTA to eliminate 600 token-booth jobs in 2010, although the workers were all reassigned to other tasks, said Transit Workers Union spokesman Pete Donohue.\nMeanwhile, the use of robots and other manufacturing efficiencies were responsible for 88 percent of the 7 million factory jobs the US has lost since peak employment in 1979, according to a study last year by Ball State University’s Center for Business and Economic Research.\nAdditional reporting by Danielle Furfaro",

I am shopping for an adopt a family for our church and do not know them at all but do know they are struggling financially. Apparently grandparents are raising the kids and grandfather is very ill. They do have access to a computer and internet. Initially I was also thinking of an ipod for the 13 yo., but saw the tablet and thought it could be educational. Can they get into any trouble on these devices if they are not closely supervised? It has been so long since my kids were that age. FYI, I also will be giving clothing, games, a few legos for the 10yo, food and a walmart gift card. thanks!",

      "text": "  Amazon Goes Offline With Bricks-And-Mortar Grocery Chain; Envisions Opening 2,000 Stores Dec 5, 2016 9:50 PM 0 SHARES \nAfter launching Amazon Fresh, an online food delivery service, in numerous cities just a few years ago, Amazon has now decided it has to go \"offline\" to capture incremental share of the grocery market. As such, the company today revealed its first brick-and-mortar small-format grocery store, Amazon Go, one of at least three formats the online retail giant is exploring as it makes a play for a higher share of grocery spending. With in-store technology designed to track customers' every step, the Amazon Go concept promises \"No Lines\" and \"No Checkout.\" \n\nThe first Amazon Go concept store is roughly the size of a convenience store, though according to the Wall Street Journal the company is also testing a drive-thru concept as well as a traditional 30-to-40,000 square foot grocery store that would combine in-store shopping and curbside pickup. \nThe Amazon Go store, at roughly 1,800 square feet in downtown Seattle, resembles a convenience store-format in a video Amazon released Monday. It features artificial intelligence-powered technology that eliminates checkouts, cash registers and lines. Instead, customers scan their phone on a kiosk as they walk in, and Amazon automatically determines what items customers take from the shelves. After leaving the store, Amazon charges their account for the items and sends a receipt. \n\nMeanwhile, in the suburban Seattle neighborhood of Ballard, a handful of workers on Monday were finishing up one of Amazon’s two drive-through prototypes in the area, which according to the people close to the situation are slated to open in the next few weeks. The wood-paneled building with green trim and an overhang appeared to have at least three covered bays for cars to pull up and pick up orders, with a paved driveway in front. \n\nThe third concept, the newly approved multi-format store, combines in-store shopping with curbside pickups, according to the people. It will likely adopt a 30,000- to 40,000-square-foot floor plans and spartan stocking style like European discount grocery chains Aldi or Lidl, offering a limited fresh selection in store and more via touch-screen orders for delivery later. Stores in this format, which are smaller than traditional U.S. grocery stores, could start appearing late next year. \nWhile the store formats are still in the concept stage, Amazon ultimately envisions opening up to 2,000 brick-and-mortar locations. \nAmazon envisions opening more than 2,000 brick-and-mortar grocery stores under its name, depending on the success of the new test locations, according to the people. By comparison, Kroger Co. operates about 2,800 locations across 35 states. \n\nAdding grocery pickups will be “part of their secret sauce in terms of all of the different ways in which they can engage the customer in bringing the product to them,” says Bill Bishop, chief architect at grocery and retail consultancy Brick Meets Click. “Everyone is looking at grocery because of frequency. Frequency guarantees that you have density.” \n\nOf course, Amazon isn't the first to test drive-thru and curbside grocery as Target and Wal-Mart both plan to launch curbside pickup in 1,000 stores by the end of next year. \nMeanwhile, with nearly 40,000 grocery stores in the U.S. employing roughly 3.5mm people, most of whom work at or near minimum wage, Bernie's \" Fight for $15 \" agitators may want to take note of this development.",

      "text": "Home | International Business | Grab And Go: Amazon's New Grocery Store Has No Checkout Lines The store marks Amazon's latest push into groceries, one of the biggest retail categories it has yet to master. The company currently delivers produce and groceries to homes through its AmazonFresh service. Thomson Reuters | Last Updated: December 06, 2016 09:14 (IST) Thomson Reuters EMAIL COMMENTS \nAmazon.com Inc said on Monday it has opened a brick-and-mortar grocery store in Seattle without lines or checkout counters, kicking off new competition with supermarket chains. Amazon Go, the online shopping company's new 1,800-square-foot (167-square-meter) store, uses sensors to detect what items shoppers have picked off the shelves and sends a bill to their Amazon accounts if they do not replace them. The store marks Amazon's latest push into groceries, one of the biggest retail categories it has yet to master. The company currently delivers produce and groceries to homes through its AmazonFresh service. \"It's a great recognition that their e-commerce model doesn't work for every product,\" said analyst Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research, noting that physical stores would complement AmazonFresh. \"If there were hundreds of these stores around the country, it would be a huge threat\" to supermarket chains, he said. The S&P 1500 food retail index, which includes Kroger Co, Whole Foods Market Inc and other companies, was down 0.5 percent at the close. Shares of Amazon closed up about 2.6 percent. Amazon Go is available now for employees of the company and is expected to be open to the public early next year, Amazon said. If tests are successful, Amazon plans to open more than 2,000 grocery stores, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday, citing sources. The company is considering other store formats, including one that would let drivers pick up goods at the curbside, the report said. Amazon declined to comment on the report. \"The checkout lines are always the most inefficient parts of the store experience,\" said Neil Saunders, managing director of retail research firm Conlumino. \"Not only would you save a lot on labour costs, you actually would make the process much quicker for consumers and much more satisfying.\" Still, the grab-and-go experience would take getting used to, he said. Some people may \"feel like they stole\" an item, Saunders said. Apart from groceries such as bread and milk, the store also offers ready-to-eat meals made fresh by on-site chefs and local kitchens and bakeries, Amazon said. That would make Amazon Go a potential competitor to fast-casual dining chains like Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc as well. Amazon Go is not the first physical store for the e-commerce company to open. It has a book store in Seattle, as well as pop-ups at malls where it displays Amazon devices such as the Kindle. © Thomson Reuters 2016 (Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)

      "text": "Related Content View Photo \n\nAmazon has unveiled a new kind of retail store, with no cashiers.\nCustomers at the concept store in Amazon's hometown of Seattle, Washington, can fill their shopping carts and walk out -- with the costs automatically tallied up and billed to their accounts with the US online giant.\nAmazon Go, which is being tested with Amazon employees and will open to the public next year, is a \"checkout-free shopping experience made possible by the same types of technologies used in self-driving cars: computer vision, sensor fusion and deep learning,\" its webpage said.\n\"Our Just Walk Out technology automatically detects when products are taken from or returned to the shelves and keeps track of them in a virtual cart. When you're done shopping, you can just leave the store. Shortly after, we'll charge your Amazon account and send you a receipt.\"\nThe 1,800-square-foot (170-square-meter) store is selling a variety of food products, including bread, cheeses and ready-to-eat meals, as well as Amazon Meal Kits, which contain ingredients for home-cooked dishes.\nIt was not immediately clear whether Amazon will expand this model with more physical stores or offer the technology to other retailers.\nThe online giant has been rumored to be looking at creating brick-and-mortar stores but so far has only announced a handful of outlets selling books.\nThe Wall Street Journal cited people close to the matter as saying that Amazon Go was one of several store formats the retail giant is considering.\nTwo prototype drive-through locations in Seattle without in-store shopping options are set to open in the coming weeks, the Journal reported.\nDepending on the success of the test locations, Amazon could reportedly open more than 2,000 brick-and-mortar grocery stores under its brand.\nIf it does push forward with selling fresh food in stores, Amazon could put a lot of pressure on traditional grocers and superstores like Wal-Mart.",

      "text": "  \nOnline shopping giant Amazon has revealed a new brick-and-mortar store concept called Amazon Go, a cashier-less outlet that uses smartphones to automatically charge shoppers for items they take off shelves and removes the need for a checkout line entirely. \nOn its website , Amazon describes its creation as “the world’s most advanced shopping technology,” which combines computerization, deep learning algorithms, and embedded sensors to allow shoppers to simply take what they want and have the bill charged to their Amazon account after they leave the store. \nAt its experimental store in Seattle – which is currently only open to Amazon employees — Amazon Go offers ready-to-eat meals, grocery essentials, and Amazon Meal Kits, which contains all the ingredients for a meal that can be prepared at home. Shoppers need to create an Amazon account and download the Amazon Go app to their smartphone in order to purchase any items. \nAlthough Amazon has not yet announced plans to expand the concept throughout the country or to sell the tech to other corporations, analysts have already expressed concern about its potential effect on the middle class. \nIf the concept takes off, millions of Americans who rely on retail jobs could soon find themselves replaced by automation, a trend that has already picked up steam thanks to self-serve checkout lanes at grocery stores and self-order kiosks at fast-food chains like McDonald’s . \nWatch Amazon Go in action below:  ",

The waist section has a drawstring to adjust for tightening as needed.\n\nI will go ahead and say that this has very little reviews and that they were all incentivized, but the quality and sizing is up to par with my standards.\n",

      "title": "Amazon to open physical grocery store — with no checkout",
      "text": "  8 minutes ago Amazon on Monday revealed that it will open a brick-and-mortar grocery store called Amazon Go, an ambitious bid by the once online-only retailer to gobble up more of Americans' shopping dollars by taking the fight more directly to traditional supermarkets and big-box stores. The store will be powered by a web of technology that allows customers to fill their shopping bags and walk out without going through a checkout process, a concept that has long been discussed in the retail industry but that has not been implemented at any major U.S. stores. The idea is that it will shave time off the shopping experience. Here's how Amazon Go will work: Customers download an app and then swipe their smartphones as they walk through the store's entrance. Then they just start picking up groceries. In a process that the company does not describe except to say that it involves such capabilities as computer vision, machine learning and artificial intelligence, every item the shoppers tuck into their bags or carts is tracked on the phone. If an item is put back on the shelf, it's deleted. As the shoppers exit, their total bill is calculated, a digital receipt appears on their phones and their Amazon account is charged. The store is set to open in Seattle, Amazon's hometown, in early 2017. And its arrival could end up posing some critical questions for the wider retail industry. For starters, Amazon Go will probably need fewer workers than traditional stores that rely on cashiers and clerks. If shoppers respond favorably to this low-touch customer service model, it might end up encouraging other chains to give similar set-ups a try and save labor costs. If Amazon Go is successful and is expanded widely, it could put serious competitive pressure on a wide range of retailers. For starters, at just 1,800 square feet, Amazon Go looks to be targeting so-called fill-in trips, the kind of quick errand a shopper does when she just needs a couple of items. In recent years, drug stores and convenience stores have proved to be potent competitors to supermarkets for these kinds of shopping trips. So, a fast-growing Amazon Go could present competition for chains such as CVS and 7-Eleven. And judging from the look of the store as seen in a video released by Amazon, it will have an ambience and selection that will put it up against Kroger or Whole Foods Market. Amazon's decision to sell groceries in physical stores would seem to be an acknowledgment of how hard it has proven to sell these kinds of goods on the Internet. Despite the explosive growth of e-commerce overall, grocery has largely remained an old-school business, with less than 2 percent of sales taking place online. Amazon Go will face no shortage of challenges as it aims to transform the model. Filling up one's refrigerator has long been a convenience-centric errand, one in which the closest store to your house is often the one that gets your money. It will take a long time — and gobs of money — for Amazon to build out that kind of store network. And what it calls “Just Walk Out technology” might be buggy or impersonal and fail to win customers over.",

      "text": "\nNEW YORK -- Amazon has gone after book stores, retail chains and electronics shops. \nNow it's taking on grocery stores, with a twist. \nAmazon unveiled in a video a new physical store on Monday that sells a mix of \"grocery essentials\" and ready-made meals. \nThe key selling point is what it doesn't have: checkout lines. \nThe video shows how customers check in at the entrance of the store with a new app called Amazon Go, then grab whatever items are needed. \nAmazon claims it can track the items automatically through a combination of computer vision and deep learning technologies. \nWhen you're done shopping, you just walk out. \nThe first store is located in Seattle, where Amazon is headquartered. \nFor years, there have been rumors the e-commerce company would expand its dominance from digital to physical shopping. \nAmazon began experimenting with physical bookstores a year ago, but Amazon Go may mark its boldest bet on bricks-and-mortar yet. \nBy eliminating much of the staff needed to operate a store, Amazon keeps costs lower than traditional competitors. It's also in a strong position to bring together data on its customers shopping habits online and offline to make better suggestions in all situations. \nHowever, Amazon's move deeper into physical retail shops comes in a sensitive political climate. \nThe company could be perceived as being a threat to some of the 3.4 million Americans who work as cashiers, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. \nOn the campaign trail, Donald Trump repeatedly criticized Amazon and its founder Jeff Bezos for \"getting away with murder tax-wise\" and having \"a huge antitrust problem.\" Will the President-elect add \"job killer\" to the list of criticisms? \nAmazon's effort to launch a new kind of retail store predates the rise of Donald Trump. \n\"Four years ago we asked ourselves: what if we could create a shopping experience with no lines and no checkout? Could we push the boundaries of computer vision and machine learning to create a store where customers could simply take what they want and go?\" the company says on an informational page about Amazon Go. \nFor now, Amazon is starting slow. \nThe first store is only open to Amazon employees and will not be an option for the general public until early next year. 40.712784 -74.005941 ",

      "text": "Email \nNEW YORK -- Amazon has gone after book stores, retail chains and electronics shops. Now it's taking on grocery stores, with a twist. \nAmazon unveiled in a video a new physical store on Monday that sells a mix of \"grocery essentials\" and ready-made meals. But the key selling point is what it doesn't have: checkout lines. \nThe video shows how customers check in at the entrance of the store with a new app called Amazon Go, then grab whatever items are needed. Amazon claims it can track the items automatically through a combination of computer vision and deep learning technologies. When you're done shopping, you just walk out. \nThe first store is located in Seattle, where Amazon is headquartered. \nFor years, there have been rumors the e-commerce company would expand its dominance from digital to physical shopping. Amazon began experimenting with physical bookstores a year ago, but Amazon Go may mark its boldest bet on bricks-and-mortar yet. \nBy eliminating much of the staff needed to operate a store, Amazon keeps costs lower than traditional competitors. It's also in a strong position to bring together data on its customers shopping habits online and offline to make better suggestions in all situations. \nHowever, Amazon's move deeper into physical retail shops comes in a sensitive political climate. The company could be perceived as being a threat to some of the 3.4 million Americans who work as cashiers, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. \nOn the campaign trail, Donald Trump repeatedly criticized Amazon and its founder Jeff Bezos for \"getting away with murder tax-wise\" and having \"a huge antitrust problem.\" Will the President-elect add \"job killer\" to the list of criticisms? \nAmazon's effort to launch a new kind of retail store predates the rise of Donald Trump. \n\"Four years ago we asked ourselves: what if we could create a shopping experience with no lines and no checkout? Could we push the boundaries of computer vision and machine learning to create a store where customers could simply take what they want and go?\" the company says on an informational page about Amazon Go. \nFor now, Amazon is starting slow. The first store is only open to Amazon employees and will not be an option for the general public until early next year. ",

      "text": "3 \nLos Angeles, CA – As the world’s eyes divert to Toronto’s promising music scene thanks to the mainstream success of Grammy Award-winning artist Drake , music mavens alike have scrapped to see what other sonic treasures reside in T-Dot. \nTasha the Amazon is one of those prized Toronto musicians who’s been consistently producing and creating her own music for a while now. With the success of her EP Die Every Day and the explosive popularity of her track “Picasso Leaning,” her significance seriously begs the question: Has Drake and his OVO crew ever made an attempt to snag her for one of their rumored notorious and exhaustive songwriting camps? \nWhile she remains slightly mum on the subject, careful not to reveal who has been “creeping” in her DMs, she leaves the possibility of working with OVO Sound on the table. \n“Toronto is a small place everybody kind of knows each other a little bit,” she says during a DXLive segment on Thursday (December 1). “Our team is pretty tight. We have like a handful of us and between all of us we may be at the same party and the same thing as OVO.” \nFor now, she keeps her Bass & Bakery production partner Danthrax close and does dope things like shutting down blocks to walk a Bengal through Toronto’s Kensington Market neighborhood . \nWatch the full DXLive interview with Tasha The Amazon below. Sign up for The Daily Drop \nThank you, thank you, thank you,you're far too kind!",

      "text": "December 5, 2016 11:02 AM Amazon Go store is checkout-free The Associated Press NEW YORK \nAmazon is testing a grocery store model in Seattle that works without checkout lines. \nCalled Amazon Go, shoppers scan their Amazon app when they enter the store, and then sensors register items that shoppers pick up and automatically charge them to the Amazon app. \nIf a shopper puts the item back they aren't charged. \nThe store offers ready-to-eat meals, staples like bread and milk and meal-making kits. \nThe store is in testing and is open to Amazon employees on a trial run. It is expected to open to the public in early 2017. \nThe e-commerce powerhouse has also been dipping its toe into the physical realm. It has opened three bookstores in California, Oregon and Washington with traditional check outs. Two more are in the works in Illinois and Massachusetts. \nCowen & Co. analyst John Blackledge says the new grocery store is just one way that Amazon has been setting its sights on the food and beverage category, a lucrative $795 billion market. It also offers grocery delivery in some markets and Prime Now for last-minute items delivered in one or two hours. \n\"We are encouraged by Amazon's growing footprint in this category, which we see as ripe for potential disruption given younger demos increasingly purchasing food and beverage grocery items via digital channels,\" Blackledge said. \nAmazon.com Inc. shares rose $18.69, or 2.5 percent, to $759.03 in afternoon trading Monday. Its shares are up almost 13 percent since a year ago. \n.",

      "text": "Amazon opens line-free grocery store in challenge to supermarkets Reuters Email Author \nAmazon.com Inc said on Monday it has opened a brick-and-mortar grocery store in Seattle without lines or checkout counters, kicking off new competition with supermarket chains. \nAmazon Go, the online shopping company's new 1,800-square-foot (167-square-meter) store, uses sensors to detect what items shoppers have picked off the shelves and sends a bill to their Amazon accounts if they do not replace them. \nThe store marks Amazon's latest push into groceries, one of the biggest retail categories it has yet to master. The company currently delivers produce and groceries to homes through its AmazonFresh service. \n\"It's a great recognition that their e-commerce model doesn't work for every product,\" said analyst Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research, noting that physical stores would complement AmazonFresh. \n\"If there were hundreds of these stores around the country, it would be a huge threat\" to supermarket chains, he said. \nThe S&P 1500 food retail index, which includes Kroger Co, Whole Foods Market Inc and other companies, was down 0.5 per cent at the close. Shares of Amazon closed up about 2.6 percent. \nAmazon Go is available now for employees of the company and is expected to be open to the public early next year, Amazon said. \nIf tests are successful, Amazon plans to open more than 2,000 grocery stores, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday, citing sources. The company is considering other store formats, including one that would let drivers pick up goods at the curbside, the report said. \nAmazon declined to comment on the report. \n\"The checkout lines are always the most inefficient parts of the store experience,\" said Neil Saunders, managing director of retail research firm Conlumino. \"Not only would you save a lot on labor costs, you actually would make the process much quicker for consumers and much more satisfying.\" \nStill, the grab-and-go experience would take getting used to, he said. \nSome people may \"feel like they stole\" an item, Saunders said. \nApart from groceries such as bread and milk, the store also offers ready-to-eat meals made fresh by on-site chefs and local kitchens and bakeries, Amazon said. \nThat would make Amazon Go a potential competitor to fast-casual dining chains like Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc as well. \nAmazon Go is not the first physical store for the e-commerce company to open. \nIt has a book store in Seattle, as well as pop-ups at malls where it displays Amazon devices such as the Kindle.

      "text": "Don't Miss: Amazon 12 Days of Deals Sale \nOur skin sometimes has problems, but the one thing we can always depend on it for is to hold us together. We aren't leaking blood or sweat everywhere at any given time, even though we shed about 500 million cells per day. Don't Miss: Top 100 Victoria's   Photos \nWe replace our entire outer layer of skin every few weeks, but we never leak, and we've never really known why. Now scientists say that they have figured out why: it has to do with the arrangement of shapes called tetrakaidecahedrons. These shapes never leave a gap, even as cells disappear. \n\"Our study is also helping us to see how the cells that make up our skin can switch on a mechanism to make a kind of glue, which binds the cells together, ensuring that our skin maintains its integrity,\" says one of the team, Reiko Tanaka, from the Imperial College London to Science Alert . \nTanaka and team investigated the layer of skin that protects us using the findings of other studies which showed that our skin has two main physical barriers: the stratum corneum and a lower layer that is a liquid-liquid interface barrier formed by tight junctions. \nThere is little known about the level that sits below it, the stratum granulosum. This layer plays a huge role in the shedding process. In order for us to shed our outer layers of skin, new skin cells have to be produced at the lowest levels before they move up. \nStill, up until now, we didn't know how all of this actually happened. \nTanaka and her team used a strange imaging technique called confocal microscopy to examine the stratum granulosum cells of mice and found that the shape is what makes everything work. The shape is something like Kelvin’s tetrakaidecahedron: a 14-sided polyhedron with six rectangular and eight hexagonal sides, but it is flattened. \nThe team figured out the shape by producing a protein that acts like temporary glue that holds the old skin on top until the new skin forms beneath. \nWhile the experiments were only done on mice, it appears that everything is very similar. \nFailures in the shape might explain some common skin problems: \"In other cases, fails in the interlocking barrier between cells - the tight junctions - may partly explain why in psoriasis there is an overproduction of epidermal cells, causing thick patches of skin on the surface.\" \nFor now, they are looking at skin thickness. and seeing how that changes things.",

      "text": "Nick Younker \nAmazon has been leading the way in the digital retail industry, revolutionizing the way that consumers do their shopping from their computers. That includes everything from books and gadgets to food and office supplies. Basically, if you can find it at Wal-Mart, Best Buy or even AutoZone, then you can find it on Amazon. \nBut now, the online retail giant is not just the Amazon of the old days, but rather making their way into the brick and mortar retail market as well, according to a report on CNN . If that were not enough, they are making the shopping experience for their retail customers much more efficient, giving consumers an easy way to shop and pay without any of the hassles normally found at places like Wal-Mart. \nAmazon Go could drastically change the entire retail industry https://t.co/p0ZcEKJ4QO pic.twitter.com/UxbPMfd6bC \n— Forbes (@Forbes) December 5, 2016 \nIf anyone has ever walked into Wal-Mart for a quick item or two and arrived at the check-out counter to find that they are behind several other customers with full carts, then you know all too well just how much of an advantage this will give you. \nAmazon has recently unveiled a brick and mortar grocery store in Seattle and customers there simply have to walk into the store, find what they need, then walk out. It really is as simple as that, but with a small setup. \nThe basic concept to this is that the new Amazon grocery stores will allow people who have an Amazon or an Amazon Prime account to walk into their stores and when they pick something up off the shelves, their phones would essentially be a scanning module which places the item they picked up in their virtual shopping basket. \nIt is basically a concept that Amazon has instituted to work a lot like their home device, Amazon Echo. The smart technology involved with this Amazon grocery store only allows you to enter the store with your Amazon app on your smart phone. This essentially allows Amazon to activate your online account and when you pick something up and put it in your cart, you’re only billed for what you have. This billing comes straight to your online Amazon account and allows you to simply walk into the Amazon Go store and get what you want, then walk out. \nThis revolutionary business model by Amazon introduces a cutting edge way to break into the brick and mortar market without being the same old department store, such as a Wal-Mart or a Kroger. It allows customers to skip the long checkout lines and get in and out of stores much more quickly, thus cutting a blazing path for Amazon to lead the charge in a market that it had once went to great lengths to avoid, the physical consumer goods store. \nAccording to the CNN report, the new Amazon Go store was unveiled for consumers in the Seattle area on Monday, with much more coming. But this is not the first time that Amazon has tried its hand at brick and mortar stores. Previously, Amazon had opened up a book store that would also mark its first foray into the market of physical stores for their customers. Now that the online retail giant has had such immense success with its online and digital offerings over the years, this could be just the start of Amazon’s new business model for the country. \nAmazon Go Store – No Lines, No Check Out, No Hassle For Groceries; Will It Catch On? https://t.co/UYYYptfnsc via @WayneDupreeShow \n—????Wayne Dupree (@WayneDupreeShow) December 6, 2016 \nThe new Amazon Go stores will also be without a traditional staff that essentially used to check customers out after their shopping experience. This relies solely on Amazon customers to simply do all of that for them with the automation of their app. \nIt is unclear at this time if Amazon plans to open more stores in other major metros, or if they plan to expand nationwide at any point. \n[Featured Image by Stephen Brashear/Getty Images]",

      "text": " 43   \n(Dec 5): Amazon.com Inc said on Monday it has opened a brick-and-mortar grocery store in Seattle without lines or checkout counters, kicking off new competition with supermarket chains. \nAmazon Go, the online shopping company's new 1,800-square-foot (167-square-meter) store, uses sensors to detect what items shoppers have picked off the shelves and sends a bill to their Amazon accounts if they do not replace them. \nThe store marks Amazon's latest push into groceries, one of the biggest retail categories it has yet to master. The company currently delivers produce and groceries to homes through its AmazonFresh service. \n\"It's a great recognition that their e-commerce model doesn't work for every product,\" said analyst Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research, noting that physical stores would complement AmazonFresh. \n\"If there were hundreds of these stores around the country, it would be a huge threat\" to supermarket chains, he said. \nThe S&P 1500 food retail index, which includes Kroger Co, Whole Foods Market Inc and other companies, was down 0.5% at the close. Shares of Amazon closed up about 2.6%. \nAmazon Go is available now for employees of the company and is expected to be open to the public early next year, Amazon said. \nIf tests are successful, Amazon plans to open more than 2,000 grocery stores, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday, citing sources. The company is considering other store formats, including one that would let drivers pick up goods at the curbside, the report said. \nAmazon declined to comment on the report. \n\"The checkout lines are always the most inefficient parts of the store experience,\" said Neil Saunders, managing director of retail research firm Conlumino. \"Not only would you save a lot on labor costs, you actually would make the process much quicker for consumers and much more satisfying.\" \nStill, the grab-and-go experience would take getting used to, he said. \nSome people may \"feel like they stole\" an item, Saunders said. \nApart from groceries such as bread and milk, the store also offers ready-to-eat meals made fresh by on-site chefs and local kitchens and bakeries, Amazon said. \nThat would make Amazon Go a potential competitor to fast-casual dining chains like Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc as well. \nAmazon Go is not the first physical store for the e-commerce company to open. \nIt has a book store in Seattle, as well as pop-ups at malls where it displays Amazon devices such as the Kindle.",
