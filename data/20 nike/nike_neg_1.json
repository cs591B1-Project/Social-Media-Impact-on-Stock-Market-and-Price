      "text": "The collaboration between VLONE and Nike on an Air Force 1 had originally been confirmed in mid November. Following the announcement, the sneaker got a limited surprise release at ComplexCon. But no further roll-out has been officially announced to date. The for now very limited sneaker is coming to the brand’s Art Basel Miami Beach pop-up store that we showed you this week. But unfortunately, standing in line will not do it this time. You can only get your hands on the sneaker via a raffle. Buying a long sleeve t-shirt from the pop-up will give you one raffle ticket and a hoodie will give you two raffle tickets.\nWho Knows You Might Win A Pair Of VF1 (Worldwide) – vlone.co \nA photo posted by V. lifestyle (@vlone) on Dec 2, 2016 at 1:09pm PST \n\nThe shop is open to the public from 12 p.m. to 7 p.m. EST until tomorrow, December 4. Good luck getting your hands on raffle tickets and on winning the sneaker!\n",

(Photo: Chris Kitchen/For The Journal News) Buy Photo 27 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nHer team didn’t get to go, which was a big disappointment. But North Rockland freshman Katelyn Tuohy made the best of things and then some Saturday, earning all-American honors in cross-country by running to a 13th-place finish out of 200 runners in the Nike Cross Nationals in Portland, Oregon. \nTuohy, whose team finished 10th in the U.S. at last year’s Nike cross-country championship and was ranked fourth in the U.S. overall before a sub-par performance at last Saturday’s Nike New York qualifier, slipped from 16th place to 20th after two miles Saturday. \nBut the two-year cross-country veteran, who was second in this year’s Class A State Championship, second in the state Federation Championship and fifth at last week’s qualifier, finished characteristically strong despite an extremely muddy course. \n“I’m kind of small. It was hard getting through. I was trying to get some traction,” Tuohy said post-race by phone, noting she tried to step in the driest areas. \nThat approach worked, as did her revamped race plan. \nDespite conditions, Tuohy clocked 17:58.5. Last year, over the same, although less-muddy course, she ran 18:11.60 for 49th place. \nRunning without her team, North Rockland coach Brian Diglio said, allowed Tuohy to be less cautious, since she didn’t have to worry about going out too fast, fading and costing North Rockland placements in team standings. \n“She definitely wanted to test herself,” Diglio said. \n“While she’s been focused on team all year long and that’s been her major motivating factor, this time she could focus on herself,” Diglio explained. “We changed our tactics a little bit. She wanted to try to go out a little harder and try to hang with these top girls. Running as an individual, rather than as part of a team, changed her strategy and I think it worked out perfectly.” \nIndeed, Diglio had hoped for a top-20 finisher for his young runner, which would gain her all-American status, since that goes to the top 21. \nInstead, she bettered that by seven slots, a “fantastic accomplishment,” according to the coach, who, like the rest of his team, stayed home after North Rockland finished fourth as a team in the New York qualifier and was bypassed for an at-large bid. \nThe 14-year-old indicated a calm approach aided her. \n“It’s the most competitive meet in the U.S. all year. (But) I didn’t get too nervous. Whatever happened happened. It wasn’t a big deal. I was really relaxed. I guess it really helped,” she said. \nColorado’s Brie Oakley won in 17:10.1. \nElite runners were so close Tuohy missed a top-10 finish by just 1.4 seconds. \n“The compression between all these girls is really good,” she said. “Going into the race I knew I really had to have a good race or I could end up 20th or 40th.” \nIn Oregon with her parents but not team, Tuohy bonded with other New York runners. \n“I missed them a lot,” Tuohy said of her teammates, “but I made a lot of friends this year.” \nAnd many had much to celebrate. \nFive runners from New York finished in the top 20. And New York won the nine-region regional championship. \nNew York’s Fayettville-Manlius won the girls national team title for the 10th time in 11 years. \nTuohy, who said she’d like to return next year with her team, characterized her finish as “pretty cool,” adding she was proud she executed her race plan well. \nDiglio, though, laughed, saying, “She was actually mad she didn’t finish top-10. She said she would have if I were there.” \n“That’s the mentality of a great runner,\" he added.",

Complementing the design is a set of multicolor striped laces and Volt Zoom cushioning. \nIs this the colorway that gets the model on track? Probably not, but it is an interesting look in a series filled with the opposite. Take another look below and keep it locked for a release date . \nNike KD 9",

      "text": "Organically elevating the Air Force 1 s innovative look and deep-rooted heritage, Amsterdam-based photographer and director Joost van Brug first created his signature, symmetrical sneaker images thanks to an interest in his brother’s passion for sneakers and their iconic colorways.\n“I wanted to shoot something new with sneakers, and my brother is obsessed with Nikes. To me, his collection is just the same shoe in different colors and a big color palette. I just pick shoes based on the color I like, but he told me the stories behind the colorways in his collection.”\nAn interest in his brother’s favorites sneakers, and in sneaker culture at large, pushed Joost to explore new methods of capturing their essence. In an effort to create a nonrepresentational image of something as recognizable as an iconic sneaker, Joost ultimately developed a motion blur technique, which captures the colors of iconic kicks as they rotate around an axis point.\n“For me, seeing my brother’s collection was just seeing a color change in the same shoe. I thought, ‘What if I just get rid of all the information of a shoe, so you don’t even recognize it as one? If you just have the colors, do you still know what shoe it is?’ That’s how I came up with the abstract motion blur.”\nHis new abstract technique highlights the iconic colors of Nike’s most eye-catching sneakers, while also giving each shoe a more nuanced, visceral identity.\n\nThe post Nike Presents The Art Of SNKRS – AF1 appeared first on KicksOnFire.com .",

And Draymond Green is joining the movement with his Nike shoes this weekend. \nGreen will wear specially designed yellow and blue Nikes that read, \"Sideline Racism.\" On Twitter, Green wrote \"I stand with my @NFL brother this weekend in wearing @RISEtoWIN's Sideline Racism shoes in uniting against racism. We stand united @NFL.\" \nThe shoes are through RISEtoWIN, whose Twitter profile states the organization as \"dedicated to harnessing the unifying power of sports to improve race relations.\" \nRISE (the Ross Initiative in Sports for Equality) is a non-profit organization, which was founded by Miami Dolphins owner Stephen Ross in 2015.

It’s layered with no-sew films and a DWR (durable, water-repellent) finish to keep your feet dry, while a mid-cut collar provides a snug, supportive fit and enhances coverage in chilly conditions.\nThe sneaker’s aggressive outsole pattern offers enhanced traction on cold and wet surfaces, while the exaggerated heel provides extra durability. As a nod to the original, a reflective heel counter is debossed with “Talaria” for heritage style and enhanced visibility in low light.\nFeaturing contrasting turquoise laces, the Nike Zoom Talaria Mid Flyknit “Baroque Brown” is now available at retailers like Livestock for approximately $200 USD.\nBuy Now / $200 USD ",

      "text": "EXCLUSIVE: Lewandowski to Become New Nike Hypervenom Face   With Neymar's switch to Nike's Mercurial boot official since Friday , it was expected that Nike would soon present a new main face of the Nike Hypervenom Phantom soccer boot. And while we do not expect an official reveal of the new main face of the soccer cleat before the launch of the third-generation Hypervenom in early 2017, Nike's website already reveals who becomes the new Nike Hypervenom face. Lewandowski to Become New Nike Hypervenom Phantom Face It is almost certain that Lewandowski will become the new cover athlete of the Nike Hypervenom. A look on Nike's dedicated website for the Hypervenom reveals that Lewandowski is the new cover athlete. Whereas Nike's previous Hypervenom page displayed FC Barcelona's Neymar, the updated site shows Lewandowski. Interestingly, the US website still features the text that Neymar would be the Hypervenom cover athlete, while the page already shoes Lewandowski in the background. Robert Lewandowski is likely the best player wearing the Nike Hypervenom boot featuring the Dynamic Fit collar, and we think that he is anything but a poor replacement. Do you think that Lewandowski is a good replacement for Neymar?   below and vote here for your favorite Nike Hypervenom cover athlete .",

      "text": " 39:55 AM PST by Red in Blue PA \nNike Inc. this week begins selling a pricey sneaker with self-tying laces, a high-stakes test of the companys technology investments and efforts to sell more products directly to consumers. \nSince its founding, Nike has predominantly been a wholesaler. But as shopping shifts online, Nike is moving to lessen its reliance on retailers. It wants to double its direct sales to consumers to $16 billion by 2020, particularly as rivals Adidas AG and Under Armour Inc. have become more competitive in recent years. \nThat is where the self-lacing $720 HyperAdapt sneakers play a role. The company is offering the shoes exclusively on its relaunched Nike+ app and at a new retail store in New York City, beginning on Thursday. The idea is to hook consumers into buying via its app or visiting Nike stores for limited-edition sneaker releases, which to date has been a near-weekly phenomenon at Foot Locker and other retailers.

      "text": "\nNike and its SNKRS app have launched the Art of SNKRS , which highlights an inventive method of showcasing the brand's Air Force 1 shoe. Focusing on symmetry, Amsterdam-based director and photographer Joost van Brug utilizes a unique motion-blur technique to show various iterations of the iconic sneaker. He started off shooting sneakers by way of his brother who was an avid Nike fan. He then learned more about the stories behind the different colorways and was intrigued at finding new ways to capture the essence of sneaker culture. \n\"For me, seeing my brother’s collection was just seeing a color change in the same shoe. I thought, 'What if I just get rid of all the information of a shoe, so you don’t even recognize it as one? If you just have the colors, do you still know what shoe it is?' That’s how I came up with the abstract motion blur.\"\nVan Brug's abstract technique focuses on the eye-catching hues set on a rotating axis, while also giving each sneaker a unique identity. Take a look at the mesmerizing video above. \nRead more at Hypebeast.com \n\n",

And the last few seasons, the apparel brand has bedazzled up the swoosh to make it really pop. They’ll do it again this time around : \nThe Alabama Crimson Tide, The Ohio State Buckeyes and Clemson Tigers will be in the Nike Vapor Untouchable Speed uniform with the Washington Huskies wearing the Speed Machine Hypercool uniform during the College Football Playoff, each featuring a fractal diamond Swoosh on the front of the jersey and pant.\n2015:\n2014:\nNike sponsors over half of the FBS, and its dominance is clear at the top. Besides outfitting each Playoff team, the other major apparel brands ( adidas and Under Armour) have barely even gotten close to getting a team in the Playoff. In each of the final top 10s of the Playoff era, there have only been two total non-Nike squads. Notre Dame (Under Armour) finished No. 8 in 2015 and Mississippi State (adidas) finished No. 7 in 2014. There likely will not be any non-Nikes in the 2016 top 10, other than Wisconsin.",

      "title": "Nike uniforms for College Football Playoff: Alabama, Clemson, Ohio State, Washington - CBSSports.com",
      "text": "21m ago • 1 min read \nThe College Football Playoff bracket has been set. There are fans that are thrilled and searching for tickets and other fans, like those in State College, Pennsylvania or Ann Arbor, Michigan, frustrated that the College Football Playoff Selection Committee did not include their team in the top four. \nBut no one is happier than the folks at Nike football. For the third straight year, all four CFP teams are Nike schools. Saturday's announcement came with the release of four mock-ups of the alternate uniforms for the playoff, all from the Nike Vapor Untouchable line in 2016. — Nike Football (@usnikefootball) December 4, 2016 \nAs SB Nation's Land Grant-Holy Land noted, the Ohio State uniforms in the promo are the same ones worn by the Buckeyes for the double-overtime win against Michigan. But if Clemson, as the No. 2 seed and \"home\" team in the Fiesta Bowl, wears its home orange, then Ohio State will likely be in white jerseys. \nThe same is expected to be the case for Washington as the \"road\" team against Alabama in the Peach Bowl. Unlike the Nike Mach Speed template worn by many Nike teams in 2016, the new Nike Vapor Untouchable look features less seams and panels along with the latest uniform technology. ",

      "text": "Not only did Nike decide to bring back the classic Nike Air Zoom Talaria, they also decided to create a hybrid version of the model ideal for the winter season, the Nike Air Zoom Talaria Mid Flyknit. The newest colorway to drop is the Baroque Brown you see above. Today we get a closer look.\nThe Nike Air Zoom Talaria Mid Flyknit Baroque Brown is constructed out of a one piece upper with Flyknit material strategically placed in areas for added breathability, comfort and support. The shoe also comes layered with no-sew films and a durable and water repellent finish. Notable features on the shoe include a mid-cut collar, a speckled sole with an aggressive outsole traction pattern and debossed reflective Talaria branding on the heel. Out now, grab a pair of your own today for $200.\n \nvia: Livestock \nAuthor’s Take Great hybrid model. I’m not a fan of the colorway, but I’m pretty sure I can find one that I like.\n\nThe post The Nike Air Zoom Talaria Mid Flyknit Baroque Brown Is Out Now appeared first on KicksOnFire.com .",

      "text": "Kevin Durant already dropped a Nike KD 9 Home , but this is not that shoe, this is the Nike KD 9 Home 2. a new colorway with some similar features. Donning a two-toned look, this Home version of the Nike KD 9 is done in a Flyknit upper with White thread on the forefoot and Blue mesh on the lateral part of the shoe. Additional hits of White can be seen on the laces, Nike Swoosh and the KD branding on the heel. Below you will find a White sole unit with visible Zoom cushioning. Being that it’s a Home colorway, a little bit of Yellow would have been nice, right? Regardless, the shoe is slated for a February 16th release for $150. Cop?\n \nimages: Eastbay\nh/t: SC \nAuthor’s Take I like the split-colored look on the shoe, I don’t seem much of a “Home” feel to it, but it’s still a solid colorway on the KD 9.\n\nThe post Our First Look At The Nike KD 9 Home 2 appeared first on KicksOnFire.com .",

      "title": "NationBuilder",
      "text": "Capture Moments // Create Sounds // Be happy // Help others smile // and… I just want Nike gear. 37 mins ago NationBuilder Hello Medium, The name is Kam and I am nervous as hell at the thought of folks reading this. I’m exposing myself to a potential onslaught of negative energy, I’ve come across negative energy aimed at the company (and employees), I’m not sure how my fellow coworkers at NationBuilder will react or what they will think, I tend to care less about filtering myself (so there is a high possibility of profanity) and lastly I’ve never done anything like this. I work for NationBuilder, I call myself our “Defender Against the Dark Arts” * (still want my job title switched to that). * Working here is for lack of a better word, different. I use the word different for various reasons and I hope to explain in this post or whatever they’re called on Medium. I have my * ”be the black guy version of yourself that makes everyone feel comfortable around you feeling” *everyday I come into work. This is something I deal with everyday and I’m great at making those who don’t look like me feel ok around me and to wake up and come in and not instantly get that gut feeling is really brilliant. One of the things here at NationBuilder is the idea of being your “true self” and this is something I hold dear to my heart and I do best to, one figure out who my true self is and show up to work being that man. In my short time here I’ve had the privilege of meeting some of the most intellectually, emotionally and socially brilliant folks ever. I get to sometimes have cool dialogue with our CEO Jim, have one of the most powerful moments in my life with our President Lea, bug Amy and Young Thugger (Happy Birthday Young Hater) , dance around the office while I’m in my world and notice Ashlee and A’ja laughing at me and make fun of and connect with the stupefying Jesse C.* (I really enjoy our conversations and growing our friendship). * I could go on and on * (Shoutout to Dom, Ryan and Joe) * It seems that I am somehow able to add to this little community we have in our office and that blows my mind daily. Here at NationBuilder i’ve connected with folks that I developed true friendships with and opened up to complete strangers * (which goes against my survival instincts as a male black) *. This is astounding to me. I have an eccentric, BAM in your face personality (I’m working on refining it) and it appears that folks at NationBuilder accept it. When I hear and read some of the mean spirited comments about the company employees being racist or allowing evil blah blah blah it does bum me out, because I see the power of this overlooked thing called Empathy that NationBuilder is holding and in it’s own way giving to everyone. I struggled with the thought of allowing anyone to use NationBuilder’s product and spew whatever venom they wanted to spew. I struggled greatly with the idea that I have to just sit on the sidelines and do nothing when I see someone becoming the face of something that will more than likely make my day to day life a tad more challenging. I don’t know what changed, yet now I enjoy the thought that there is a platform that gives everyone access. Be it a racist individual, a TRILL individual (urban dictionary it for those not about the Trill life) or one who is strong with the SWIRV * (I’ll probably do another post about SWIRV and the coming SWIRV movement) *I enjoy it because this is one of the few things I know of that gives everyone access. Having access is key to creating change. Change is something this country needs a greatly. I had to think long and hard about continuing to work here because of my being called an “Uncle Tom” by someone close to me. The individual felt that because NB allowed Donald Trump to use the software and me working at NB means that I am aiding an individual who clearly is racist and legitimizing racist thoughts and behaviors for others. This thinking is maybe what led to my change of thought. If NB started saying who could and could not use it’s product where does the line stop? It seems like such a slippery slope and I already think that we are in a catch 22. No matter which side you look, someone will have an issue with what someone else is doing or saying. I ask that folks work to find some empathy and attempt to accept that we don’t have to get folks to be on our side to coexist in a thriving community. Those who have the courage and determination to make a change I encourage you be the change you want and look at NationBuilder, the folks working here are passionate about what they do and more importantly open to learning about the things they don’t see everyday. I am proud that I’ve been able to share stories with peers that have told me it helped them understand the black experience more, I definitely wish we could have more of these discussions. It’s a rare thing to find people who understand that they are ignorant to something and want to become more knowledgeable and understanding. I say this as a man who sees a system that isn’t setup for me to thrive and NationBuilder’s mission gives me hope. Jyn Erso said it best, “rebellions are built on hope.” I have hope that this company can achieve it’s mission and democratize democracy. That shit would be so dam cool. So before you decide to send a Tweet or anything like that remember there is a human (robots haven’t taken all the jobs yet) who sees this and they more than likely are doing what they think is the right thing to do. I hope that this helps someone who could be working on something that will make a positive impact and needed a push about using NationBuilder or anything else. Know that no one here at NationBuilder asked me to do this or has any idea I would be doing this. This is me getting out of my comfort zone and hoping that I can share another voice from NationBuilder. I leave you with a word from a great Wizard I know named Lord V “SWIRV,”",

(Photo credit: Nike) \nIt was assumed Arizona would feel the impact of Donte Williams ' likely impeding departure for Nebraska rather quickly, at least in recruiting. \nSunday, the Wildcats lost the centerpiece of their highly-regarded 2017 recruiting class, and it's likely connected to the Williams news. \nGreg Johnson announced on Twitter he \"decided to re-open my recruitment\" after being verbally committed to the Wildcats since March. Johnson surprised many when he made that early commitment ot the Wildcats, but Johnson picked the Wildcats primarily because of his relationship with Williams. \nWilliams' departure for Nebraska in particular is interesting because of how the Cornhuskers have been recruiting Johnson even as he was committed to Arizona. \nJohnson took an official visit to Nebraska late in the season and told the Star afterward: \"It was cool, just being out of California for a couple days. The atmosphere was cool, and they are cool people out there so I enjoyed it overall. It was a cool visit.\" \nWith Arizona out of the picture, Nebraska and USC are expected to be the leaders for Johnson, whose decision has wide-ranging impact for the UA. \nFor one, Johnson is the recruit that started a flurry of commitments over the summer and into the season, helping the UA get its class as high as 27 players and for a while rated the top class in the Pac-12. Now, Arizona is down to just two four-star recruits committed to its 2017 class: quarterback Braxton Burmeister and running back Nathan Tilford . \nJohnson is rated the No. 2 athlete in the West, according to Scout.com , and was expected to play cornerback at Arizona. \nHis departure likely puts the death knell on Arizona's pursuit of five-star receiver Joseph Lewis , Johnson's teammate at Augustus Hawkins High School in Los Angeles. It's long been believed that Lewis and Johnson wanted to play together in college, and Williams was the primary recruiter on Lewis as well. Nebraska has been considered the favorite for Lewis for much of the recruiting cycle. \nIt's unclear how this impacts the rest of Arizona's 2017 class, but it's less likely to impact the players already committed as much as UA's targets for the next class or two, namely four-star cornerback Thomas Graham , recruited by Williams and from Rancho Cucamonga, California. \nToward the end of Arizona's season, the Star spoke with Johnson about Arizona's incoming recruiting class and his thoughts on Arizona's losing a lot of games this past year. Here's some of what he said. \n\"I’m pretty sure we’re all going to be successful there (Arizona) next year, and help Arizona get a lot of Ws.\" \"I’ve been watching the games, I know they’ve been dealing with a lot of injuries and stuff, but I’m pretty sure they’ll get a couple more Ws. I know that when myself and the rest of the 2017 class gets there we’re going to change a lot of that. We’re looking forward to getting a lot of wins and a lot of bowl wins.\" \"They’ve (Arizona's coaches) been saying they know what’s going on right now but they feel with the guys committed right now, they recruited them for a reason, and that’s to come in and change things. That’s what they talk about.",

      "text": "Nike To Invest More In Direct-To-Consumer Business; Facebook Is Testing OTT Ad Targeting by AdExchanger // \nHere's today's AdExchanger.com news round-up... Want it by email? Sign-up here . \nGet In The Game \nNike has historically distributed through retail channels, but by 2020 it hopes to double its $8 billion direct-to-consumer business , relying heavily on digital channels. “As shopping shifts online, Nike is moving to lessen its reliance on retailers,” writes The Wall Street Journal. For instance, the kinds of exclusive sneaker releases it’s done with stores are shifting to its relaunched app. It isn’t a coincidence that last week Nike also announced a lifetime billion-dollar deal with Portuguese futbol star Cristiano Ronaldo. \nStreaming Power \nFacebook has been quietly testing OTT ad targeting, Bloomberg reports. “For the past few weeks ... it’s been targeting ads to people streaming certain shows on their Roku or Apple TV set-top boxes. It customizes commercials based on the Facebook profiles tied to the IP addresses doing the streaming, according to a company spokesman.” So far, A+E Networks and Tubi TV are involved. Questions still remain around who should be responsible for ad sales and how revenue should be split, as well as how to measure ad effectiveness (and those are pretty important questions). More . \nGrowing Pains \nWPP talked “horizontality” at an investor event last week. After noting growth would be relatively flat, the holding company expanded on its plans to integrate a diverse array of assets. “The more services an agency group and the more integrated a specific team (e.g., Team Ford) is with their client (and involved in more higher-level strategic work), then we think there is less risk of an agency group losing that particular piece of business,” a WPP spokesperson told investors. WPP’s most recent evolution toward this goal is through [m]Platform , which centralizes tech and data expertise. More at MediaPost . \nPrivacy At All Costs \nThe EU’s General Data Protection Regulation, launching in May 2018, will prevent businesses from using individual data without explicit consent. Ad tracking and targeting companies will have to receive consent at every point in the tracking chain, a requirement that could “rip the digital ecosystem apart,” as PageFair exec Johnny Ryan hyperbolically puts it. \"Companies who create value only by using data and tracking people across the internet will have to find a way to build a relationship with the customer,” he said. “They will have their businesses seriously disrupted. Publishers may finally have the upper hand.” More . \nBut Wait, There’s More!",

      "text": "On Sunday afternoon, Sam Acho ’s customized Nike cleats will stand out when the Chicago Bears host the San Francisco 49ers at Soldier Field. The shoes will be green and white, in the hues of the Nigerian flag. And they’ll feature a symbol to represent the hospital Acho is helping to build in the rural African village of Isuikwuato.\nAs part of the NFL's \"My Cause, My Cleats\" campaign , players across the league are wearing special cleats in Week 13 to highlight a charity or cause they’re devoted to. Among the Bears participating are Acho and running back Jordan Howard .\nAcho continues devoting his attention to spreading awareness about Living Hope Christian Ministries , a medical mission devoted, among other things, to improving medical care in parts of Africa. The organization was founded in 1989 by Sam’s father, Sonny Acho, and continues to help provide for local medical clinics, schools and orphanages in Nigeria.\nHoward’s cleats will honor the Pulmonary Fibrosis Foundation . Howard’s father, Reginald, died of that disease when Jordan was a child.\nAcho made his first medical mission trip to Nigeria with his parents when he was 15 years old. He was, he says, just a wide-eyed and helpful volunteer on that initial trip, helping to escort patients from their medical check-in to the doctors they were hoping to see.\nAcho said he was “shocked and amazed” by how much valuable work was being done through the outreach. It instantly heightened his passion for the cause.\n“As I got older, instead of that being my parents’ things, it became my thing – something I loved and cared about,” Acho said. “I started to see the doors I could open. Playing in the NFL, I was telling teammates about what I would do in Nigeria and how we could help and seeing who would come.”\nWhile playing for the Arizona Cardinals , Acho persuaded teammates Calais Campbell , Dan Williams and Ricky Lumpkin to accompany him to Nigeria. Last summer, Bears cornerback De’Vante Bausby joined Acho on the trip.\nCurrently, Acho said, the Living Hope clinic is undertaking a three-phase project to raise $2 million to build the hospital in Isuikwuato. They’ve raised, Acho says, $250,000 of the $300,000 needed to complete the first phase. Acho is hoping his footwear this weekend will encourage others to donate.\nHoward, meanwhile, will use his platform to raise awareness for pulmonary fibrosis.\nReginald Howard was 52 years old when he passed away. In his dad’s honor, Jordan’s Adidas cleats on Sunday will be blue and yellow.\n“He definitely inspires me. I think about him every day,” the Bears rookie said. “I know he’s always there with me. Even though he’s not here in body, I know he’s here spiritually. He always motivates me.”\nAround the league, the “My Cause, My Cleats” campaign will be omnipresent this weekend.\nBears guard Kyle Long has remained active in assisting his older brother, Chris, with his Waterboys initiative, a push to bring clean water to Tanzania and other East African communities in need. Chris will wear cleats highlighting his foundation and the Waterboys cause.\nAcho hopes all the cleats worn across the NFL will spur a positive reaction.\n“The hope obviously is that this doesn’t become oversaturated,” he said. “At first, I’ll admit I was hesitant to do this. I was thinking, ‘Man, everybody else is going to be doing this. Two-hundred-fifty players all with their own cause. No one’s going to get the message.’ At the same time, this is something near and dear to my heart and if people can hear about this and support it we’ll be able to provide so help.”\nPrivacy Policy Chicago Bears NFL Dan Williams Calais Campbell Arizona Cardinals Kyle Long Sam Acho",

      "text": "Jewish Teen Gets $25K Bar Mitzvah Money, Buys 800 Nike Pairs To Donate To Less Fortunate Kids By Amanda Moore   04:00 am Drew Frank loves collecting shoes and turned his passion into helping others for his bar mitzvah project.(Photo : Alberto E. Rodriguez/Getty Images ) \nA Jewish teenager, who received $25,000 for his bar mitzvah, bought several pairs of shoes with his birthday money. But the 800 Nike pairs he purchased weren't for his own use. \nInstead, Drew Frank donated these shoes to less fortunate children in low-income families. The 13-year-old tied up with the Braden Aboud Foundation for his special bar mitzvah celebration. \nThe Jewish teen asked relatives and friends to give him cash for his birthday, in lieu of gifts. He initially had planned on buying shoes and socks for the kids at the Beall Elementary School in El Paso, Texas. But he also had extra money to donate shoes to orphans staying at the YWCA center for women and children, Kveller reports. \nDrew Frank said that he's been always passionate about sneakers and wanted this to be his bar mitzvah project. Jewish teens are apparently required to do community service in line with this religious tradition. \"So I decided to raise money to buy sneakers for kids who are less fortunate than me,\" the 13-year-old said, per El Paso Inc . \nThe Jewish teen celebrated his birthday in May and had over 250 guests who handed out checks. Then, with the help of the foundation that has been spearheading shoe donations to low-income families, they sought Nike for the bulk orders. The shoes have been recently distributed to the school kids as shared in the Braden Aboud Foundation social media account. Another great shoe giveaway ...420 pair of Nike tennis shoes to Beall Elementary ...thank you Drew Frank who gave his Bar Mitzvah gifts to help kids B STRONG! #bstrong #nike #justdrewit #livetogive #tennisshoes A video posted by @bstrongrunwalk on Nov 7, 2016 at 6:35pm PST \nDrew's parents, Dana and Adam Frank, supported his plan and were more than pleased by their son's idea. \"We always try to instill the importance of giving back to the community through volunteering and generosity,\" Dana told the press. \nDoing philanthropic work has always been a family engagement as the Jewish teen's grandparents are well-known philanthropists Stanlee and Gerald Rubin. The Frank kids have also volunteered for Make-A-Wish Foundation on several instances. © 2016 ParentHerald.com All rights reserved. Do not reproduce without permission. Related Articles",

      "text": "Kith, recipient of the 2016 Footwear News Achievement Awards Retailer of the Year , is teaming up with Nike for a limited-edition sneaker release that will have many feeling nostalgic.\nTo celebrate the opening of Kith’s Miami location, Fieg has partnered with Nike to release what he calls his “favorite shoe of all time” — the Nike Air Force 1 Low “Linen.” The tan, pink, and white sneakers were originally released as a Japan exclusive in 2001 as part of Nike’s fan-favorite “Concept Japan” range and have remained tucked away in the brand’s vaults ever since. Related The Best Sneakers to Get You in a Festive Mood \nSelect friends and family pairs of the Nike Air Force 1 Low “Linen” will feature custom packaging by artist Futura. Kith/Tyler Mansour In order to capture the original appeal, Kith and Nike have pulled out all the stops to re-create a one-to-one retro that mimics everything from the grade of premium leather to the narrow shape seen on the “Linen” Air Force 1 Low 15 years ago.\nMeanwhile, the sneaker’s launch will also call back to its regional availability in 2001 with a release exclusively at Kith’s new Miami location at 1931 Collins Ave. Beginning on the store’s grand opening on Friday, raffle opportunities will be presented on four different days over the course of the next two weeks.\n“The timing was amazing, and I am beyond excited to be the one to help reintroduce my favorite shoe ever to the world. 2016 has been an incredible year, and I’ve been able to live out so many of my personal dreams,” Fieg wrote on Instagram.\nAccording to a press release from Kith, this will be the only opportunity to obtain the “Linen” Nike Air Force 1 Low, and the shoes will have a wider release in the future.\nIf you know me, you know my favorite shoe of all time is the AF1 Linen. Over a year ago I spoke with Nike about officially bringing back this grail. This shoe represents a different time for sneakers, a time before the game became commercialized. Back then it was about the hunt, and you either had to physically travel somewhere to get the pair you wanted, or you had to know someone who knew someone else that had them. I told the Swoosh that if these were to be brought back, they had to be done in a way that would honor its original release. Not only did the quality have to be perfect, but so did the way they are brought to market. Being a Japan exclusive in 2001, we agreed that they had to remain a shoe that wasn't sold online and was solely available in 1 place. Around this time I had begun work on another dream of mine – opening a Kith Miami flagship. The timing was amazing, and I am beyond excited to be the one to help reintroduce my favorite shoe ever to the world. 2016 has been an incredible year, and I've been able to live out so many of my personal dreams. Here goes another one. A Kith Miami global exclusive. Stay tuned to @kith for more info. \nA photo posted by Ronnie Fieg (@ronniefieg) on Nov 30, 2016 at 6:04pm PST \n \nThe Nike Air Force 1 Low “Linen” is a one-to-one reproduction of the original 2001 release. Kith/Tyler Mansour Ronnie Fieg calls the Nike Air Force 1 Low “Linen” his “favorite shoe of all time.” Kith/Tyler Mansour The Nike Air Force 1 Low “Linen” originally released as a Japan exclusive in 2001. Kith/Tyler Mansour According to a press release from Kith, the Nike Air Force 1 Low “Linen” retro features a narrowed shape and premium leather.

      "text": "Image Source: POPSUGAR Photography / Ann-Marie Alcantara \nHi there! We're Dominique and Ann-Marie (POPSUGAR Fitness and Tech editors), and we just spent the past few weeks testing out the new Nike+ Apple Watch . We've both got unique perspectives on what we want out of a fitness gadget, and we'll give you our thoughts on each aspect of the Nike+ Apple Watch, walking you through our experience with it over the past month. \nThinking of getting yourself the new Nike+ Apple Watch this holiday season? Or maybe giving it to a loved one? Nike let us take these fancy new trackers on many test runs to see what the user experience is like, so we could give you preview of all the awesome new features. Let's get into it! Related: \nDominique (center), Ann-Marie (right), with Nike running coach Blue Benadum (left) Nike+ Apple Watch vs. Apple Watch Series 2 \nDesign and Aesthetic \nWhat distinguishes this from the other Series 2 Apple Watches is the Nike sport band and preloaded watch \"faces\" with Nike's athletic, minimalist look — with gray and Nike's signature \"volt\" lime green colors. And that's it — other than the design you get the same features as you would on a Series 2 Apple Watch. \n\"When I look at this compared to the other running trackers out there, this is really sleek, stylish, and much more sophisticated. Definitely not your mom's run tracker! I love that I can wear this on my morning run and I don't want to take it off immediately after when I'm getting dressed for work.\" — Dominique Astorino, Fitness \n\"And let's get real, these bands breathe so much easier than the regular Apple Watch band. The regular one doesn't let my skin breathe and since I have sensitive skin, it's not ideal at all.\" — Ann-Marie Alcantara, Tech Related: We've Got Something Awesome For Every Runner on Your Gift List (Stocking Stuffers Included) Fitness-Specific Apple Watch Series 2 Features \nWhile you'll get these same features (below) with a regular Series 2 Apple Watch, if you're comparing the Nike+ Apple Watch to other running trackers, here are some highlights to consider that make this model stand out from the rest. \nWaterproof Design \n\"For a runner or general fitness enthusiast, one of the best features about the updated Apple Watch is the fact that it's waterproof. This is a huge bonus if you're looking for a tracker and comparing it to others on the market.\" — DA \n\"As someone who does not know how to swim well (I swear I can at least float), the waterproofing is awesome for anyone who's also just into outdoor activities. I went kayaking with the Apple Watch and it was sprayed with water a lot. But with its new waterproof durability, I didn't have to worry about it surviving the trip (or feel like a tool for worrying about my precious Apple Watch while kayaking under the stars).\" — AMA \nMusic Storage \n\"You can store up to 1 GB of music on your Nike+ Apple Watch and pair with your wireless headphones (I'd recommend the Powerbeats3 ) so you can have your running playlist on the go. For me, this means I get to store one running playlist at a time.\" — DA \nHeart Rate Monitor \nOne of the benefits of the Apple Watch is the ability to monitor your heart rate, on the Heart Rate app, through the Nike+ Run Club app, and in the Workout app. This helps contribute to calorie-burning data and your movement data for the day in the Activity app. \nGPS \n\"At the end of your run, regardless of whether or not you have your phone, you get a screen at the end that shows you the general route from the GPS. You can then sync to your phone once you've reunited with it (I know . . . it's so hard to leave it behind) and look at your map a little more in depth and analyze where you slowed down, sped up, etc.\" — DA \n\"The map is also a great reminder for anyone on the fitness struggle bus of how much you were able to run. It's also so nice to have the option to leave your phone behind — something not possible on the first generation Apple Watch.\" — AMA Using the Running App \nWhile the general features of the Apple Watch Series 2 are enticing enough, the most exciting part of the Nike+ version is the fact that you get to take one of the best running apps from your phone and put it onto your wrist in the form of a very sleek tracker — arguably the sleekest. \nTo get started, you'll need to have the NRC app on your phone (and a Nike+ account), in order to install it on your Watch. \nOnce you're ready to take it for a test run (literally), all you have to do is tap the Nike+ symbol on your home screen. From there, the app launches and you can hit the start button or adjust your preferences (indoor run versus outdoor, auto-pause on and off). \nModes: Advanced and Basic \nYou can customize the \"modes\" of your running interface depending on the kind of stats you want to see. When you're just starting out, you might just want to see the amount of time you've been out there running and your total distance. For those of you working on the art of pacing, the Advanced Mode is for you. \n\"I use the Advanced Mode because I've been working on both quickening and maintaining an even pace, so this is really important to me. I also love that you can see your heart rate BPM in the top corner, because I've been getting more and more intrigued about heart rate data lately.\" — DA\" \n\"I also use the Advanced Mode to know my pace and adjust — especially if I'm training for a race. I also like knowing it so I can show off and pretend I'm a fitness junkie who can talk about pace.\" — AMA \n\"You can totally talk about pace! We should start training for a race together!\" — DA \n\"If only you'll accept running in the slowest corral ever.\" — AMA Related: 10 Apps For Every Type of Runner \nPhone-Free Running \nThe Watch puts your NRC app on your wrist, so you don't have to carry your phone with you. You can track your pace, distance, total time, and even your route with the GPS feature, and then sync to your Nike+ Run Club app once you're back to your phone. \n\"I personally still run with my phone. The idea is amazing, but in terms of safety (I run alone in a city) — and to be totally honest, pictures — I still want my phone with me. Sharing photos of my run routes is one of my favorite parts of the Nike running app. But now, I can leave my phone in my pocket or waist pack — no need to constantly take it out to check pace, distance, etc. — I can just glance at my wrist!\" — DA \n\"I also always run with my phone, but it's mostly to listen to my curated Spotify playlists and safety. However, on the weekends, it's a great option to leave my phone behind or at least know that having it near means accessing other important safety features that come with the new watch like SOS (hold the side button and 911 gets called).\" — AMA \nFor those of you who love the NRC app but are less attached to your phone (and perhaps in a safer running environment), this will feel like a new freedom. You'll get all the benefits of tracking your pace, progress, and course — plus the ability to share your run — without having to carry or bring anything extra. \nAuto-Pause \n\"Auto-pause is a major feature for me, and it's inherent in the NRC app, so it's nice that it carried over to the Watch as well. It's especially clutch for a distraction-free workout if you're running in a city or anywhere with stoplights. You have the option to turn this on or off depending on your preference, but when you have it on, there's no need to fuss with your Watch every time you stop for traffic or a crosswalk; the app automatically knows, pauses your workout (the classic \"pausing workout\" message you're familiar with if you've been using the app), and then resumes once you've begun running again.\" — DA \n\"The auto-pause is double-edged sword — and one I'm familiar with since I've used the NRC app for a while. It's awesome that it automatically pauses if you're walking or waiting at a stoplight, but sometimes I just want to take a break from huffing and puffing my way through a mile! Thankfully, though, the watch doesn't account for these breaks (necessary for beginner runners); you can turn off the auto-pause feature.\" — AMA Accessing Your Data \nIf you swipe to the left twice in the running app, you'll get to the screen that shows your total mileage for the current month. For example, it might show four runs for December, with 8.75 total miles. \nYour collective run data — including pace, splits, etc. — and past run routes are all stored on the NRC app on your phone and on your Nike+ account online. You cannot see any of this from your Watch once you've saved your most recent run. Fun Features \nNike added in some intuitive and fun bonuses that make running more enticing, exciting, and interactive. \nReminders \n\"The 'Are We Running Today' feature is probably one of my favorite features of the Nike+ Watch. If it's been a few days since your last run, the screen pops up like a notification (with the weather info), prompting you to schedule a run for yourself. My first one said \"It's 61º with a chance of greatness\" and I damn near died with giddiness.\" — DA \n\"I'll admit, I was someone who totally tweeted about how the 'Are We Running Today' feature was a total run-shame move by Nike . But in practice, it doesn't actually remind you every day and it's just like a running to-do list.\" — AMA \nScheduling \nIf you need the extra motivation or accountability, the scheduling feature is both fun and practical. Once you're in the running app, swipe left to open the next screen, which is the scheduler. It'll show the next several hours in half-hour increments, alongside weather conditions, so you know what to expect when you hit the pavement or trails. \n\"If you're training for a run, this is an awesome reminder feature to meet your goals!\" — AMA Related: The 1 New Apple Product You Should Buy Isn't What You'd Expect \nEncouragement \n\"At the end of your run, cute screens come up with different messages — I've seen a different one every time, actually! I wish they lasted longer. You also sometimes get an encouraging audio message from a famous runner, coach, or even Kevin Hart.\" — DA Related: Your New Year's Resolution Made Easy: 10 Simple Steps to Start Running \n\"The messages are what you wish your gym teacher in middle school would've said to you! They are positive, cheesy, and absolutely awesome to hear and see after finishing a run. It's almost like the words are coming from someone real who wants to see you succeed and get fit.\" — AMA \n\"On the note of getting some encouragement, I also interviewed trainer Jeanette Jenkins earlier this year, who ran the New York Marathon and used the Nike+ Apple Watch to pace her run (she LOVES her watch). She told me that one of her favorite features is that it's more than just a tracker — you get the Apple Watch text capabilities, too. This meant she was able to get texts of encouragement from her nieces and nephews that she could see right on her wrist. 'I wasn't expecting it, so it totally filled me with joy.'\" — DA \nSharing \nOnce you've completed a run, you have the option to share it with your fellow Nike+ Apple Watch-owning friends, which can send them a virtual \"fist-bump\" prompting them to match or surpass your mileage. A little friendly competition. \n\"Ann-Marie and I couldn't get this to work between us, but we haven't given up hope. We asked Nike what triggers the bumping of the fists, and they told us that the software is designed to give a more serendipitous feel to the fist-bump — so it doesn't happen every time you run. You also have to make sure that both of you are wearing the watch for it to happen.\" — DA \n\"Since Dominique is a fitness editor, I hope to get some fist bumps from her soon. It'll be a nice and friendly reminder to exercise instead of rewatching Gilmore Girls (again).\" — AMA \n\"Oh yeah this will be a fun way to be accountability buddies! We have to make this work.\" — DA \nBeyond the fist-bump functionality, you also can share your run to the rest of the Nike+ community and your Nike+ friends, and from the app on your phone, you can share more to social media. Keeping the positive run vibe alive, and encouraging you — and your friends — to get out there and stay active. Related: Here's Why You Should Get the iPhone 7 Plus but Not the iPhone 7 Beyond Running \nIf you're using the Nike+ Apple Watch for activities other than running, bear in mind that you'll be using the standard Apple Watch Workout app. This is not a Nike-specific activity tracker, but you can use it to log workouts like indoor cycling, weight training, and even swimming, thanks to the watch being waterproof. Overall Impression \n\"I've never been truly convinced that anyone needs an Apple Watch, but this one finally makes it a worthy investment. With the new watchOS3, bands, GPS, and waterproof capabilities, the price tag on this watch makes sense, and you won't regret having one. It might be the little motivation you need in the New Year to start training for a race (or to pretend like you're going to train for one).\" — AMA \n\"I love this thing so much — it's been encouraging me to go for more runs because it's literally ON MY WRIST every day, encouraging me to use it. The fact that I can interact with friends through the watch is a huge bonus, too. But my favorite part remains that I can take everything I love from my favorite running app and now use it with wrist-tracker functionality. If I didn't have this one, it'd be atop my Christmas list . . . also, my parents read this, so I can't say if they will or won't be getting one from me, but let's just say that things are looking good for them this year.\" — DA \nIs the Nike+ Apple Watch right for you? If running isn't your favorite activity, and you're just hoping for simple step tracking or exercise logging, or if you're looking for a tracker that logs sleep (the Apple Watch can't do this as you need to charge it nightly), then you might want to look elsewhere. But if you're looking for a stylish, waterproof run tracker with the added benefits of the Apple Watch (ability to listen to music phone-free, take calls and texts, use Apple Pay), and get a nice friendly dose of encouragement to go on another run . . . then yes, you're definitely going to want one of these to kick off 2017.",

      "text": "\nHow Nike lost Curry to Under Armour \nWearing Kobe model Nikes, DeRozan played so well at Compton High that he had his choice of many top colleges, but he chose the one that was two-thirds of the way from Compton to Staples, where Bryant played. \"After we met, then he sort of watched me grow up,\" DeRozan said. \"And he was always offering advice. He was always serious. That's one of the things I loved about him, his seriousness.\" \nAfter a year (in Kobe Nikes) at the University of Southern California, DeRozan was drafted ninth by the Raptors, where he now wears No. 10 -- an homage to Bryant's Olympic team number. \nAs a Raptor, DeRozan has seen the league change mightily in style of play, with 3-pointers becoming the game's most treasured form of attack. This trend has not affected DeRozan at all, because it was never a big part of Bryant's game. Instead, DeRozan has spent the better part of a decade learning to find those step-backs, side steps, drop steps and escape dribbles that form the basis of a Bryant-style midrange game. He has become proficient at working with his back to the basket. He knows where his sweet spots are on the floor, and he knows how to get there within the chaos of a game. \nHe grew good enough at all of those skills that last year he had one of the thrills of his career: sharing the court with Bryant during the legend's final All-Star Game in DeRozan's new home of Toronto. They both wore Kobe 11s. \nTHESE DAYS, DEROZAN is scoring like water -- about 30 points a game this season -- as the Raptors are emerging as the Cavs' only real challenger in the East. And he does it without the superpower of the 3-pointer -- attempting one every 18 minutes of play in a league where centers like Marc Gasol (every nine minutes) and Karl Anthony Towns (10 minutes) shoot them far more often. \nWhich is not to say DeRozan is without tricks. Bryant attempted more free throws than any guard in history -- more than 10,000 -- by earning a trip to the free throw line every 4.9 minutes he played for 20 years. DeRozan isn't far behind. For his career, he has attempted one every 5.7 minutes. This season, he's averaging a free throw attempt every 3.9 minutes, better than Bryant's best season. \n\"I'd watched him growing up. I watched Kobe do everything. His shot. His footwork. How he works in the post. Everything growing up was Kobe.\" \nDeMar DeRozan \nThis is the project DeRozan was working so hard on last summer. \n\"Free throws take a toll,\" DeRozan said. \"You have to be relentless because you have to keep doing it even when you're not getting calls. You have to be strong enough to finish through contact. You have to be able to get up after you got knocked down. And you have to do it night after night. There's weight training. There's diet. There's treatment. A lot of things I don't want to do.\" \nSo in that borrowed Rio gym, DeRozan would run, shoot and lift weights for an exhausting two or three hours. \"There was one day where it was raining and there was water all over the court,\" DeRozan said. \"I said, 'We'll wait until it dries. We didn't come all this way only to go back.'\" \n\"He gets it the old-fashioned way. He draws contact, he gets to the line. He breaks the mold when you look at his style,\" Raptors coach Dwane Casey said. \"There's not that many guys who can do it. You can't do it with the entire team because it puts too much on the officials.\" \nThe jujitsu of drawing fouls hardly gets you on SportsCenter. It doesn't lend itself to hero worship. But it does come with the admiration of Rockets star James Harden, the NBA's reigning free throw king. In fact, DeRozan and Harden spend summer study sessions in Los Angeles, where they examine every little opportunity to earn a whistle -- like bringing a very low dribble into traffic. This often forces active-handed defenders to make an exaggerated reach to swipe at the ball and creates the kind of reach a referee just might notice. They also hone the fine art of tracking defenders in transition and finding inadvertent-looking contact with them while shooting, which DeRozan calls \"body hunting.\" \nLast March, when Harden's team visited Toronto, he and DeRozan dined together. The night before, DeRozan had gotten to the line 25 times in a win over the Portland Trail Blazers -- making his first 24 and missing the last on purpose to kill the clock and secure the win. In baseball, pitchers have perfect games. In golf, there's the hole-in-one. For what Harden and DeRozan do, this was the top of the mountain, and Harden wanted to compare notes, maestro to maestro. \nBACK ON THE cruise ship after rehearsing how to beast his way to hard-won and-1s, DeRozan would join his Team USA teammates for a daily 11 a.m. meeting, where he'd sit with heroes of the 3-point revolution, players like Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson, Kyrie Irving and Draymond Green. \nAdvanced statistics say a lot of things about basketball, but nothing more loudly than that 3s make your offense better -- they draw defenders out of the paint, making layups easier; they reduce wear and tear; and, not to be overlooked, they come with one more point . The best offenses shoot near-record numbers of them. The graph of 3s attempted across the league over the past decade is shaped like a hockey stick, going up and up, with no end in sight. \nDeRozan sees it as a fad. After the meeting, when the team went to practice, DeRozan would rest on the sidelines when his teammates did their individual work. \"I'd just watch as guys got their shots in,\" he said. \"I didn't care if someone thought I wasn't doing anything.\" \nLonely hard work and being misunderstood -- or even disliked? That's all part of being like Kobe. While the league has trended toward the deep ball, DeRozan continues to study and mimic Kobe's midrange game. Steve Russell/Toronto Star/Getty Images \nBut it's also not something DeRozan has perfected entirely. He can get a bit tense when he sees how the long-range shooters get praise and respect from media. Midrange shots in traffic go hard against the grain of efficiency. And even though free throws are an important component in efficient offense, DeRozan doesn't think the stars who are the best at getting them are regarded appropriately. \nHe's something of a victim of the changes in how players are assessed. By points per game, he's a hero. By any stat that measures his team's performance when he's on the court, he falls far down the leaderboard. In last year's playoffs, for all of his big buckets, the Raptors were better as a team when DeRozan was out of the game. This season, ESPN's real plus-minus ranks him as the league's 61st best player, much of which is attributable to his being one of the lowest-rated defenders in the league. On offense, he's ranked fourth among shooting guards, after three players who shoot 3s like crazy. \n\"There's still time in my career to move out to the 3-point line. Right now that's not something I need to do,\" DeRozan said as he leaned back in a chair at the Denver Four Seasons hotel and saw teammate Kyle Lowry headed for the front door wearing workout gear. \nIt was almost 8 p.m. The Raptors had just flown in to start a five-game road trip. Denver was having its first snowstorm of the year, but a waiting SUV was ready to take Lowry to a nearby gym to get practice shooting in. There would be lots of 3-pointers. \n\"When I get to be Kyle's age I can shoot 3s,\" DeRozan joked. \"When I'm 33, maybe I can be the next Kyle Korver.\" \nAfter his second All-Star season and strong play in the deepest playoff push in Raptors history -- he averaged 23 points a game and shot 50 percent from the field -- DeRozan was stunned by where he was rated by major media outlets. ESPN's #NBArank had DeRozan at 30th. The Washington Post ranked him 45th. Sports Illustrated had him at 46th. \n\"I think it's B.S.\" DeRozan said. \"I'm willing to line up against anyone in the league, and it will be toe-to-toe until the end. I believe I've proved that. You put in so much work, it's almost sickening. I watch everything, I read everything. I've always been a guy who wants to prove somebody wrong. I wouldn't rub it in anyone's face, but that's my gratification. I've seen so many guys' work ethic, and I know it doesn't come close to what I'm putting myself through. When you see those rankings, it makes you want to go out and prove it.\" \nAnd in his mind, the proving ground lies on the other side of Lake Erie. \"That's all I'm thinking about: the Cavs, the Cavs, the Cavs,\" DeRozan said. \"We've already played two games against them, and both came down to the end. We've got to figure that out; we've got to get that execution. We're going to keep working. I'm going to keep working. I'm not a fluke player; we're not an accident team.\" \nLast summer DeRozan signed a five-year, $137 million deal with the Raptors on the first day of free agency. He had other options: the Lakers, of course. The New York Knicks were interested and so were the Philadelphia 76ers, whose general manager Bryan Colangelo had drafted him in Toronto. He passed on other options for a few reasons, the largest contract in Raptors history being a big one. The possible blowback of not winning right away in L.A. with a young team being another. But when he talks about establishing a legacy in Toronto, he's not trying to give a nice quote. He's following a guiding principle: Playing a whole career in one place is pure Bryant. ",

      "text": "The selection committee made its decision on the four teams that will appear in the College Football Playoff at the end of the month. And aside from being beasts on the gridiron, those teams all have something in common: Nike.\nAll four teams that will compete in the playoff games on Dec. 31 — the Alabama Crimson Tide, Ohio State Buckeyes, Clemson Tigers and the Washington Huskies — all rock Nike on the field. And to football fans who swear they see the Swoosh every year during the College Football Playoff, you’re right: Since the inception of the playoff format three years ago, Nike has outfitted all 12 teams that have participated. Related The Best Sneakers to Get You in a Festive Mood \nTo keep the players of the schools it sponsors ready for action, Nike will outfit the teams in the latest and greatest cleats it has to offer. According to the brand, players on the four teams will be wearing the  Vapor Untouchable 2 (and Vapor Untouchable 2 Pro), the  Alpha Field General  and the  Force Lunarbeast Elite (and  Force Lunarbeast Elite Pro ) for the New Year’s Eve matchups and the Jan. 9 championship game.\nAside from the cleats, Nike will keep the teams in its best uniforms during the tournament. The Nike Vapor Untouchable Speed uniform will be worn by Alabama, Ohio State and Clemson, and the Speed Machine Hypercool   uniform will be worn by Washington.\nLeft to right: the Nike uniforms that Alabama, Washington, Ohio State and Clemson will wear during the College Football Playoff.

      "text": "Nike is 26% off its 52-week high. Disney recently gave investors a 10% dividend raise.\nAbbott has more than four decades of dividend growth.\nLike many of you, December means it is holiday shopping time. My wife has the innate ability to sniff out a good deal. Mrs. Dividend Bro zeros in on what she wants to buy and then shops around to make sure she is getting the best deal. She checks individual stores as well as online to make sure she isn't overpaying for something. Once she knows what she wants to purchase and where, she searches for coupons or promo codes for discounts as well as free shipping deals. By no means is she cheap. She really leaves no stone unturned in hopes of saving money that can be used to buy more gifts or another Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX ) beverage for herself.\nI try to apply this same mentality when I make a stock purchase. Because we are limited to a one, sometimes two, purchases per month, I find it very important to find undervalued stocks and purchase them at prices I want. Like my wife, I have a shopping list with price targets so that if the market gives me what I want, I am able to pull the trigger on a desired stock. I don't always buy from my watch list, see last month's purchase of Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO ) as an example, but more often than not, I do select from this list. My investing guidelines are as follows:\nCore holdings are those that:\nHave at least 10 consecutive years of dividend growth. Are considered by S&P Capital/Morningstar to be no more than 5% overvalued. Are considered by F.A.S.T. Graphs to have a current price to earnings ratio that is no more than 5% overvalued when compared to the five-year average price to earnings ratio. Have a dividend yield above 2.0%. Dominate their sector of the economy. Supporting holdings are those that:\nHave five years of dividend growth or 10 years of paying uninterrupted dividends. Are considered by S&P Capital/Morningstar to be at least fair valued. Are considered by F.A.S.T. Graphs to have a current price to earnings ratio no more than 5% overvalued when compared to the five-year average price to earnings ratio. Have a dividend yield above 1.0%. Speculative holdings are those that:\nHave recently initiated a dividend. Or have an average dividend growth rate of at least 10% or higher for the life of the dividend. Are considered by S&P Capital/Morningstar/F.A.S.T. Graphs to be at least 5% undervalued. Without further ado, here is my shopping list for December:\nNike (NYSE: NKE ) \nCurrent Yield\n# Years div growth\n5-Year Div Growth Rate\n1.43%\n15\n14.9%\nS&P Capital 12-month price target\nS&P Capital Fair Value\nMorningstar Fair Value\n$63\n$53.80\n$57\nF.A.S.T Graphs Current PE\nF.A.S.T Graphs 5-Year Avg PE\nPrice Target\n22.2\n24.8\nUnder $65\nClick to enlarge According to Morningstar, Nike is the most dominant player in the athleisure space. The company ranks #1 in market share in sportswear, athletic shoes and training apparel. Nike is one of the most recognizable brands in the world. Interbrand.com says it is the 18th most valuable brand in the world while Branddirectory.com lists the company as the 29th most valuable brand in the world. Shares of Nike have really struggled this year, losing almost 20% year to date as competitors, such as Under Armour (NYSE: UA ), attempt to take market share from the shoe giant. The stock's 52-week high is $68.19. Based on Friday's closing price of $50.46, shares are 26% off of the high. Nike has raised dividends for the last 15 years and while shares yield just 1.43%, the company has an average annual raise over the past five years at just under 15%. On 11/17/2016, Nike gave investors a 12.5% dividend increase. To someone who likes to acquire shares of quality dividend-paying companies off their highs, this is all music to my ears.\nF.A.S.T. Graphs has a current price to earnings ratio of 22.2. The average PE over the past five years is 24.8. By this criteria, Nike is currently 11.71% undervalued. S&P Capital has a 12-month price target of $63 or almost 25% higher from the most recent close. Its fair value for the company is $53.80 or 6.62% higher from here. Morningstar lists fair value at $57, which would result in an almost 13% gain from the most recent price. Take the average of these numbers and I find shares to be 14% undervalued. Nike is one of the few companies I follow that is undervalued by all of my investing criteria. With 15 years of dividend growth, I'd be willing to pay 5% over fair value. Therefore, I would be fine buying Nike at prices under $65. Based on my investing criteria, Nike is the 11th most undervalued stock that I follow.\nThe Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS ) \nCurrent Yield\n# Years div growth\n5-Year Div Growth Rate\n1.58%\n7\n31%\nS&P Capital 12-month price target\nS&P Capital Fair Value\nMorningstar Fair Value\n$110\n$110.4\n$134\nF.A.S.T Graphs Current PE\nF.A.S.T Graphs 5-Year Avg PE\nPrice Target\n17.1\n18.6\nUnder $131\nClick to enlarge Entertainment and Media colossus Disney continues to have issues with ESPN subscription losses as people make the choice to cut the cable cord. Fears over these losses are justified, but the company continues to produce winner after winner in the movie space. Most people are familiar with Star Wars, Frozen and the Marvel Universe, but did you know that Mona made more than 80 million dollars over the Thanksgiving holiday? The company's theme parks are some of the most visited parks in the world each year. So while the subscription losses are still a problem for the company, the stock has many other drivers going for it that if/when Disney figures out how to improve this area, the stock is likely to skyrocket.\nLike with Nike, Disney's yield, just under 1.6%, isn't all that much to write home about. Dividend growth of more than 30% over the past five years, however, is. On 11/30/2016, the company gave investors a 10% dividend increase. Not as much as in the past, but a solid raise nonetheless.\nF.A.S.T Graphs lists the current PE at 17.1 and the five-year average ratio is 18.6, that is almost 9% of upside potential based on this guideline. S&P Capital has a 12-month price target and fair value at $110 or more than 11% upside from Friday's closing price of $98.50. Morningstar is the most bullish on Disney as it has a fair value of $134, or 36% higher from the most recent close. Altogether, I find Disney to be 17% undervalued. With seven consecutive years of dividend growth, I would be willing to pay 5% above what I find fair value to be. Anything under $131 would qualify Disney for purchase. By how I value stocks, Disney is the sixth most undervalued stock that I follow.\nAbbott Laboratories (NYSE: ABT ) \nCurrent Yield\n# Years div growth\n5-Year Div Growth Rate\n2.74%\n44\n29.17%\nS&P Capital 12-month price target\nS&P Capital Fair Value\nMorningstar Fair Value\n$46\n$42.20\n$44\nF.A.S.T Graphs Current PE\nF.A.S.T Graphs 5-Year Avg PE\nPrice Target\n17.2\n18.9\nUnder $49\nClick to enlarge Abbott Laboratories made our watch list back in September, but we didn't make a purchase at that time. I detail many of the reasons why it was on our watch list here , but we used to own the company before it split from AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV ). I sold ABT to buy more ABBV, but I've always liked the company and wouldn't mind having it back in the portfolio. The stock has been on a roller coaster ride this year and is down more than 15% for 2016. Since the publication of my September watch list, Abbott has fallen another 10%. The company is also 18% off of its 52-week high of $46.22. While there is no guarantee that the stock will get back to that level anytime soon, Abbott has an outstanding track record of 44 years of dividend growth, if you include the years prior to the split of companies. Now could be a good opportunity to pick up a company that is well off of its highs that boasts an impressive history of dividend raises. Shares currently yield 2.74% and the company has given investors an average raise of more than 21% since the split in 2013.\nF.A.S.T. has a current PE of 17.2. This is almost 10% below the five-year average price to earnings ratio of 18.9. S&P Capital has a $46 price target on the stock, which would be good for a 21.37% gain based on Friday's closing price of $37.90. Its fair value is $42.20 or 11.35% higher from this closing price. Morningstar gives a fair value of $44. Reaching this price would give investors a 16% gain. Average these numbers together and I find that Abbott is trading almost 15% below fair value. Since the company has more than four decades of dividend growth behind it, any price under $49 would qualify it for purchase. Abbott is the 10th most undervalued stock that I follow.\nConclusion \nIf you're familiar with my articles on Seeking Alpha, you know how much emphasis I place on having a watch list of stocks. For this month, I'm looking strongly at Nike, Disney and Abbott Laboratories. All of these stocks are undervalued by all of my investing criteria. I can't say the same for too many of the stocks that I follow. What do you think of these three companies? Which ones are you focusing on?\nDisclosure: I am/we are long ABBV, DIS, KO, SBUX AND MAY INITIATE A POSITION IN NKE OR ABT IN THE NEXT 72 HOURS. \n  it (other than from Seeking Alpha).  \nAdditional disclosure: We are not investing professionals.

In fact, the brokerage said Nike could be a good stock for 2017 and beyond. \nInvestors have become cautious on Nike due to concerns that the company is losing share to Under Armour Inc (NYSE: UA ) in basketball to adidas AG (ADR) (OTC: ADDYY ) in lifestyle. Further, Nike has had to deal with excess inventory that should weigh on its second quarter, which will be reported on December 20. \n“Besides, visibility on mid- to high single-digit reported sales growth and limited margin compression we feel is very high for this year and beyond, and these are not exactly metrics to be ashamed of,” analyst Erwan Rambourg wrote in a note. \nRambourg noted that though alternative brands may be gaining share at times, Nike is set for superior growth and returns long term, with several margin driving levers to pull during lower growth times like now. \nOn the valuation front, the analyst now sees the stock trading below 20x forward PE, a level “we find very compelling given our bullish stance on the fundamentals of the sporting goods industry and the quality of Nike’s management team and track record in terms of growth, cash returns and communication.” \nFor the second quarter, Rambourg expects EPS of $0.41, and sales of $8.055 billion, below consensus estimate of $0.43/$8.108 billion. \nThe analyst increased his target price to $60 from $56. \nAt last check, shares of Nike rose 3.25 percent to $52.10.

      "text": "Under Armour is out to prove it’s playing in the big leagues. The Baltimore-based sporting goods company announced today that it has entered into a 10-year deal with Major League Baseball to be its official uniform provider, beginning in the 2020 season.\nThe partnership is the company’s first-ever professional league uniform deal (terms of which were not disclosed), and it’s a big one for Under Armour. It’s debatable how lucrative it will ultimately prove, given that baseball is currently struggling to attract a younger audience in the US. But it shows that Under Armour can play on the same field as its more-established rivals, Nike and Adidas.\nUnder Armour has taken off since Kevin Plank founded the company in 1996, starting with just a single sweat-wicking undershirt for athletes . It has steadily expanded despite the stiff competition, and enlisted global superstars such as Stephen Curry and Michael Phelps to help it build its brand. Beginning in early 2015, it even overtook Adidas for more than a year as the number two sportswear company behind Nike in the US, though Adidas reclaimed the position in October.\nRecently the company has been taking further steps to portray itself as a sportswear powerhouse on Nike’s and Adidas’ level. In July, for instance, it announced it would take over the former FAO Schwarz space on 5th Avenue in New York. It’s a roughly 53,000-square-foot space on the most expensive retail strip in the world.\n“The reason that we did that store was a lot of things,” Plank later explained at WWD’s Apparel & Retail CEO Summit in October. “First of all was to put a flag out there. You have to build product for the biggest and the best.”\nThe deal with MLB shows Under Armour planting another flag—one that could help raise its visibility. Admittedly, baseball, for various reasons , doesn’t have the television audience it once did, and doesn’t sell sneakers the way basketball does (though Under Armour does the bulk of its sales in apparel anyway). It’s not likely Nike or Adidas would have been interested in a similar deal. But for a company whose profile, while growing, isn’t yet at the level of Nike or Adidas, baseball’s still strong attendance record , and the fact that eventually everyone who watches a game will see jerseys “featuring prominent Under Armour branding,” is a strong plus.\nFanatics, a licensed sports merchandiser, was also involved in the transaction. It gets the licensing rights to manage the manufacturing and distribution of Under Armour fan gear, such as jerseys, which the two companies expect to have available prior to the 2020 season.",

      "text": "Getty/Justin Berl \nIn Under Armour's 20-year history, one milestone has eluded it: the coveted major-league wide endorsement deal.\nNo longer, as MLB and Under Armour just announced they entered into the a 10-year long exclusive deal to design and manufacture the uniforms for all 30 teams. In addition to on-field uniforms, the deal includes base layers and game day outerwear.\nThe deal will commence in 2020, and current MLB uniform maker Majestic Athletics's 5-year deal expires. Financial terms for the deal were not revealed. Also announced for the deal: ecommerce platform Fanatics will become official retailer and distributor for the MLB uniforms.\nUnder Armour previously had deals to provide base layers, cleats, and other equipment officially for the MLB uniform kits. \nDeals like these are increasingly important for sportswear makers looking to cash in on official replica uniform sales and the halo effect it creates. Increased competition has led to higher price tags on the deals, and the last major league endorsement deal — Nike's 8-year deal with the NBA signed in 2015 and taking over for Adidas in the 2017-18 season — was valued at more than $1 billion, sources told the Wall Street Journal .\nNike also has a exclusive deal with the NFL. Adidas-owned Reebok has an exclusive deal with NHL, while the mainline Adidas brand has a deal with Major League Soccer.\nThe MLB and Under Armour deal represents a shift in strategy for the brand, who previously focused on sponsoring NCAA teams and inking deals with athletes before they hit their prime.\nNOW WATCH: A style expert explains what 'business casual' actually means \n",

      "title": "UPDATE: Bill Gates reveals his favorite books of 2016",
      "text": "By Silvia Ascarelli, MarketWatch\nThe Microsoft co-founder on Nike, tennis, genes, political leadership and the power grid\nBill Gates is once again displaying his eclectic taste in books as he offers up his favorite reads of 2016, ranging from a book on tennis to another example of \"mundane stuff that are actually fascinating.\"\nThe Microsoft(MSFT) co-founder and co-chair of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation says the one common theme (http://b-gat.es/2gKVMwD) is \"they all dropped me down a rabbit hole of unexpected insights and pleasures.\"\nGates says he's been reading about a book a week since childhood. The typical American reads just four in a year (http://www.pewinternet.org/2016/09/01/book-reading-2016/), according to Pew Research Center, and 26% of Americans haven't cracked open a book (including audio books and e-books) in the past year (http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/11/23/who-doesnt-read-books-in-america/).\nHere's what caught his attention this year:\n\"String Theory\" by David Foster Wallace\nConsider this one for your tennis-loving friends. The book, published is May, is a collection of five essays on the sport\n\"Here, as in his other brilliant works, Wallace found mind-blowing ways of bending language like a metal spoon,\" Gates says. Read more about why he likes the book here (http://b-gat.es/2gKNpRU).\n\"Shoe Dog\" by Phil Knight\nKnight is the co-founder of Nike Inc., and Gates describes the book, published in April, as \"a refreshingly honest reminder of what the path to business success really looks like: messy, precarious and riddled with mistakes.\" Here's his full assessment (http://b-gat.es/2fQ7AJE).\n\"The Myth of the Strong Leader\" by Archie Brown\nThis book, published in 2014, focuses on political leadership, and Gates says he read it because of this year's election battle. Brown, he concludes, \"shows that the leaders who make the biggest contributions to history and humanity generally are not the ones we perceive to be 'strong leaders.' Instead, they tend to be the ones who collaborate, delegate and negotiate -- and recognize that no one person can or should have all the answers.\"\nHis full review is here (http://b-gat.es/2fPYFaZ).\n\"The Gene: An Intimate History\" by Siddhartha Mukherjee\nRead this to get a glimpse of the future of genome science, including the ethical questions it will bring. Genome-editing technologies will affect us all, and this Columbia University doctor has written the book for non-scientists.\n\"It's one thing to reprogram the code that runs our computers. Reprogramming the code that runs our species is a very different thing altogether,\" Gates wrote in a November blog post (https://www.gatesnotes.com/Books/The-Gene) that included this video interview:\n(https://youtu.be/yNlRE2WmcQc)\nHere's his full book review (http://b-gat.es/2fPXCb9).\n\"The Grid: The Fraying Wires Between Americans and Our Energy Future\" by Gretchen Bakke\nThis is the one on mundane but fascinating stuff, and Gates gives it an honorable mention.\nHere's his take: \"Even if you have never given a moment's thought to how electricity reaches your outlets, I think this book would convince you that the electrical grid is one of the greatest engineering wonders of the modern world. I think you would also come to see why modernizing the grid is so complex and so critical for building our clean-energy future.\"\nThere's no full review by Gates for this one. The book was published in July.\nGates recommended a different set of five books (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/5-books-bill-gates-wants-you-to-read-this-summer-2016-05-17) this summer. Here's his list of favorites from 2015 (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/bill-gates-lists-the-best-books-hes-read-this-year-2015-12-07) and 2014 (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-five-best-books-bill-gates-read-in-2014-2014-12-10).\n-Silvia Ascarelli; 415-439-6400; AskNewswires@dowjones.com\nRELATED: 6 books that influence guru Robert Cialdini wants you to read (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/6-books-that-influence-guru-robert-cialdini-wants-you-to-read-2016-10-05)\nRELATED: 6 books recommended by Richard Thaler, a founding father of behavioral economics (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/6-books-recommended-by-richard-thaler-a-founding-father-of-behavioral-economics-2016-07-05)\nRELATED: 20 books that make Amazon's best of 2016--at midyear (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/20-books-that-make-amazons-best-of-2016so-far-2016-06-22)\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n12-05-16 1301ET\n ",

      "text": "Nike Will Win College Football Championship (NKE, UA) By Dan Moskowitz | December 5, 2016 — 1:01 PM EST \nThe College Football Playoff had been determined, with the following four teams being selected: Alabama, Clemson, Ohio State, and Washington. From an investment angle, what stands out about this list is that all four teams sport the NIKE, Inc.’s ( NKE ) swoosh. According to SB Nation, Washington will wear the Speed Machine Hypercool while the other three teams will wear the Nike Vapor Untouchable Speed uniform. The swoosh will be seen on the jersey and pants of all four teams, and for all viewers to see. \nAccording to The New York Times, the College Football Championship game last year, where Alabama beat Clemson 45-40, had 25.7 million viewers. This was a year-over-year decline of 23%, when Ohio State beat Oregon 42-20. That’s a substantial decline, but it relates to which teams make it to the championship game, not declining popularity in college football. Also consider that 25.7 million people is still a lot of viewers, and that the 25.7 million viewers for last year was just for the College Football Championship game and doesn’t include the semifinal games. \nUnder Armour, Inc. ( UA ) has been making strides in sponsorship deals with teams and athletes, but this story continues to repeat itself – just when Under Armour (or one of its peers) begins to gain ground on Nike, Nike funds a way to pull further ahead. The exposure Nike will gain from all four college football playoff teams wearing the swoosh will resonate with young consumers. Nike is likely rooting for Ohio State to make it to the championship game, simply because it draws the most viewers. However, Nike can’t really lose no matter how it plays out. Under Armour will continue to push for more exposure on the college gridiron, but it’s going to have to sit this year's postseason on the bench. \nNKE has depreciated 23.02% over the past 12 months and currently offers a dividend yield of 1.42.",

      "text": "Nike Trading Higher On Upgrade (NKE) By Dan Moskowitz | December 5, 2016 — 11:02 AM EST \nNIKE, Inc.’s ( NKE ) just got a boost from Erwan Rambourg, Global Co-Head of Consumer and Retail Research at HSBC. Rambourg upgraded NKE to “buy” from “hold” and raised his price target to $60 from $56. NKE is currently trading at $51.86. This might represent the beginning of a shift in analyst opinions on Nike. FindTheCompany | Graphiq \nIn September, Nike was downgraded by Piper Jaffray to “neutral” from “overweight.” The primary reason for the downgrade was competition. Analyst Erinn Murphy stated, “We are downgrading our investment rating on NKE from OW to Neutral following our multi-market visits in Germany, UK & France this past week. While we believe in the brand long-term, the resurgence of Adidas has taken a toll on Nike's growth rate in the region. \nIf you pay attention to the footwear market, then you know things have changed, and fast. Nike’s launch of its HyperAdapt 1.0 has taken the media by storm. The self-lacing shoes are selling for $720, but Nike’s angle is likely to drive excitement now in order to lower the price on later versions and sell to a broader audience in the future. (See also, Nike HyperAdapt 1.0 Gets Big Exposure on T.V. ) \nAdditionally, Nike has opened its tech-based 55,000-square-foot store in SoHo, New York City. This has been bad news for local residents because the crowds have been so large. One local resident told the New York Post: “The huge increase in crowds has an enormously negative affect on the neighborhood.” This is clear negative for residents, but it does indicate high demand for the Nike brand and the experiences it’s offering in that store. \nJust when Adidas was gaining ground, Nike has proved that it’s not going anywhere. NKE is up 2.64% intraday based on the upgrade, and if the broader market can stay afloat, then this could signal a reversal for the stock, which has depreciated 23.31% over the past 12 months. NKE currently offers a dividend yield of 1.43%. Subscribe to News To Use for the latest insights and analysis Thanks for signing up to Investopedia Insights - News to Use.",

The shoe don’s Chicago-vibes as a Black and Red color scheme take care of the upper. What really give the shoe a Chi-Town feel is the Chi-Town branding placed on both the heel and tongue.

      "title": "Nike Will Release Two Different Colorways Of The Nike Kyrie 2 What The",
      "text": "Nike will be doing something completely different when it comes to the upcoming What The colorway of the Nike Kyrie 2 . For starters, we’ll be seeing not one, but two different colorways release. The first is the tonal Green Glow pair that we recently took an official look at, and the second is this Sail pair.\nDifferentiating itself from prior “What The” releases, Nike decided to abandon the color mashup on the Kyrie 2 model and instead go with a material mash up. What do we mean? Well instead of combining together past colorways of the Kyrie 2, Nike decided to take a more monotone, sculptural, dimensional execution with very minimal color pops. The Nike team tells the story of the “What The” Kyrie 2 in a three dimensional fashion with textural graphics carefully molded on both shoes. This Sail colorway nods back to the debut “Dream” Kyrie 2, while the green glow edition acknowledges the “Kyrie-oke” edition.\nLook for this Sail colorway to release exclusively in North America while the Green Glow pair will be available in the rest of the world. Both pairs will release on December 12th 2016 for $120.\nvia: Nike \nAuthor’s Take I understand the switching up of the idea with this “What The” colorway since the color mash up thing was getting played out. I just don’t really see this as a “What The” colorway because from a distance you won’t be able to notice the different materials. I expect these to sit on shelves.\n\nThe post Nike Will Release Two Different Colorways Of The Nike Kyrie 2 What The appeared first on KicksOnFire.com .",

      "text": "It’s been the worst performing stock this year on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, but it led the index to new highs Monday.\nShares of Nike ended up 3% Monday, helping prolong the Dow’s rally since Donald Trump’s election in early November.\nShares of the sports apparel company jumped after HSBC analysts upgraded the stock from “Hold” to “Buy,” and gave it a 12-month price target of $60--a 18% upside from Monday’s open.\n“[W]e now see the stock trading below 20x forward price-to-earnings ratio, a level we find very compelling given our bullish stance on the fundamentals of the sporting goods industry and the quality of Nike's management team and track record in terms of growth, cash returns and communication,” the team wrote. “We also view that during lower growth times like now, Nike has many levers to pull to extract better margins.”\nBut the sports apparel maker has been a poor performer this year, with shares dropping 17% year to date as the company repeatedly missed Wall Street expectations in recent quarters.\nInvestors have also fretted about Nike’s competitors, Adidas and Under Armour. The latter company confirmed on Monday that it had entered a 10-year uniform partnership with Major League Baseball--Under Armour’s first ever deal with a major professional U.S. sports league.\nThe Dow ended the day up nearly 46 points, ending at 19,216.24. The index has risen 4.8% since Trump’s election , largely led by stocks in the financial sector.",

And often times, he’s wearing some variation of LeBron James’ signature sneaker collection. \nToday, Smith gets another Nike Lebron 13 Low player exclusive in his quest to help the Cavs repeat. The black, white and red shoe doesn’t necessarily scream team colors or tie in to Smith personally, but they have been labeled as an official JR PE. \nTake a closer look at the Nike LeBron 13 Low “JR Smith” PE below. \nNike LeBron 13 Low “JR Smith” PE Nike LeBron 13 Low “JR Smith” PE Nike LeBron 13 Low “JR Smith” PE",

      "title": "Nike Self-Lacing HyperAdapt Sneaker Review",
      "text": "Photo: Courtesy of Nike My shoelaces are whirring. All around me, in the Nike store, there’s a cacophony of wind-up and clicking noises that sound like a cluster of dentist chairs being raised in unison. In the future, this will be the soundtrack for putting on our shoes, thanks to the newest Nike creation — the first-ever “self-lacing” sneaker, the Nike HyperAdapt shoe.\nAlthough the sneaker is new, it’s not the first of its kind. The self-lacing Nike sneaker first appeared on Marty McFly’s feet in 1989’s Back to the Future Part II , when McFly steps into them in an imagined 2015. Someone smart at Nike clearly wrote “Make these a real thing someday and time them perfectly to the movie” on their vision board, because the timing of the HyperAdapt’s release seems prescient. Technology, fashion, and sneaker press all wrote excitedly anticipatory pieces about the sneaker prior to the launch and Wired even featured the sneaker on the cover of its coveted Design Issue .\nAt first glance, the HyperAdapt is more modern-looking than its 1989 prototype. While the 1989 version looks like a hi-top that would make any modern fuckboy happy, the HyperAdapt resembles a Nike Free or more traditional athletic shoe. But unlike traditional athletic laces that criss-cross across the tongue of the shoe and are tied by hand, the HyperAdapt has electro adaptive reactive lacing (EARL), which run across the shoe in parallel lines. A light-up panel goes under the instep of the shoe, and two small blue dots are located below the heel. Press one blue dot and laces tighten and coil like a snake around a stick, press the other and the laces instantly relax and loosen their grip.\nAccording to Tinker Hatfield, the Nike designer who conceived of 1989’s self-lacing sneaker, the shoes should “come alive” when you step into them. “It would sense you. It would become the shape of your foot, and when it came alive it would light up. Wouldn’t it be great if shoes could do that?” he told Wired he first imagined. The HyperAdapt fulfills that vision. Almost instantly after you put your foot into the shoe, the blue panel flashes, there’s a soft ri , as the sneaker and the laces grip your foot in a soft hug that it doesn’t loosen. In a missed opportunity, no one in the group of editors, including myself, exclaims, “No more laces, all right!” when this first happens. Tiffany Beers, a Nike engineer with gray-blue hair and a good black eyeliner game for 8 a.m., responsible for designing the shoes, looks at us all expectantly as we rock back and forth, Instagram, and try to feel what it’s like to wear a sneaker of the future.\nPhoto: Courtesy of Nike HyperAdapt feels not unlike any other sneaker Nike has designed, albeit a little stiffer, thanks to a rechargeable lithium-polymer battery in the heel of the shoe. It’s not uncomfortable, though. Over the next hour, the group of us literally run around the Nike store before opening hours, to put the sneaker to the test. We’re encouraged to slam the ground with our feet, pivot, do squat jumps, touchdown dances, shoot hoops, and run through a video simulation of Central Park, all to test how we feel in the sneakers. Unsurprisingly, thanks to over 5,000 hours of user-acceptance testing by actual athletes, none of the sneakers or their battery packs break. Everyone dutifully reports that the shoe “feels good.” The blue dots don’t perfectly match up with the button underneath the shoe that controls tightening and loosening, but everyone gets the hang of it and realizes that the key is to press slightly underneath the drawn-on-dot.\nNot since the age of 6 have I considered tying my sneakers to be a pain point (for now, the HyperAdapt comes in adult sizes only; kids everywhere still have to learn the life skill of tying their shoes), but having a mechanism that sets the tightness of my shoe is nice. Nike imagines that it will be more than “nice” for professional athletes whose performance depends on having a perfectly calibrated shoe, down to the laces. But a s the Adidas CEO snarkily asked of HyperAdapt , is it a “save-the-life product?” Probably not, for a normal person. But that’s a lofty expectation for a sneaker. No one thought much of the battery-powered vibrating mascara and automatic soap dispenser either, but our lives are arguably better with them in it (especially the mascara). Despite the $720 price tag, others seem to agree. After going on sale last Thursday, the Nike store has been fully booked with HyperAdapt appointments. “No more laces, all right.”\nTags: beauty health and wellness sneakers nike hyperadapt back to the future laces sneakerheads fuckboys sneaker don shoes omg shoes beauty section lede More   5:32 p.m. The  ",

      "text": "Adidas goes Midtown to compete with Nike in NYC KO By Kyle O'Brien - 05 December 2016 21:56pm \nBarely a month after Nike opened its Nike Soho store in lower Manhattan , Adidas has upped the competition by opening a Midtown feature store at 46th Street and Fifth Avenue , according to reports in Footwear News and Business Insider. The Turf area at the new NYC Adidas flagship store near Times Square / Courtesy of Adidas \nWith its massive 45,000-square-foot store just blocks from Times Square, the German sports retailer has shown a willingness not just to keep up with its Swoosh rival, but also to make a big statement in a sports shoe and apparel market that is swarming to Manhattan to grab attention. \nThe store is the largest Adidas shop in the world and it has a stadium retail vibe, inspired by high school stadiums. Shoppers enter through a football-style tunnel and the stands let people view the space stadium style. Plus, dressing rooms are locker rooms and there is an in-store track and turf area to let consumers wear test products. \nThe Adidas mega-store comes as other sportswear competitors are also trying to make a stamp on the Big Apple. The North Face recently opened a two-level, 20,000-square-foot store on Fifth Avenue, and Under Armour announced recently that it will take over the iconic FAO Schwartz building on Fifth Avenue, which will fill 53,000 square feet. It’s clear that all these brands want to use America’s biggest retail market as its competitive playground. \n“It’s our No. 1 global flagship; it’s the best articulation of our brand. When you think about everything that we’ve been doing to create what’s fresh and new about our brand, this is the first physical manifestation of everything that we’re about. In terms of size and scale, it’s the biggest global store that we’ve ever had,” Simon Atkins, brand director for Adidas America, told Footwear News. \nOther Adidas store features include juice and snacks stall, a personal fitness consultation area and a customization area for both shoes and clothing. \nThe customization at the opening comes through MiAdidas with customers able to personalize the popular Ultra Boost sneakers. \nThe Adidas store also opens as the company announced it is moving 150 jobs from its Boston-area offices to its North American headquarters in Portland, just miles from the Nike world headquarters in Beaverton, Oregon.",

The three-point marksman has been struggling in his past five games, but that hasn’t stopped him from hoisting up his signature long-range contested jumpers. It hasn’t stopped teammate LeBron James from gifting J.R. some brand new player exclusives either, as Smith will lace up this Nike LeBron 13 Low PE against the Toronto Raptors tonight. \nThis LeBron 13 Low PE features a simple black mesh and fuse construction with an eye-catching black to white gradient midsole complete with contrast speckling throughout. The outsole unit combines Nike’s signature LeBron Hexagonal Air units with an Air Max heel for a more traditional ride. Color pops of vibrant red hit the laces and lining to match the Cavaliers uniform kit. What do you think of J.R. Smith’s latest? Check out more photos below and be sure to check out the first look at the LeBron 14 right here on Sneaker News. ",

      "text": "Tweet 0 shares / likes \nLooks like the cat is out of the bag. LeBron James, who had been practicing in the LeBron 14 , was finally spotted in his new shoe by the Cleveland Cavaliers Instagram account. The shoes feature a strap (as mentioned in our last report) and a much shorter cut than the previous LeBron signature installments and most certainly the high-rising LeBron Soldier 10. The soles appear to have Zoom pods in sections, similar to how the LeBron 12 featuring the Hex-Zoom for that distinct outsole design. \nThe Nike LeBron 14 is scheduled to release in the coming weeks with an MSRP of $175.

      "title": "Adidas CEO Has \"Words\" for Nike's HyperAdapt 1.0 (NKE, ADDYY)",
      "text": "Adidas CEO on Nike HyperAdapt 1.0 (NKE, ADDYY) By Dan Moskowitz | December 5, 2016 — 9:02 PM EST \nIf you have ever run in a race, caught ground on the person leading that race, and then fell back into the pack again, then you know how frustrating this experience can be. No matter what you do, no matter how hard you try, catching that superior competitor is just not possible. Based on what Adidas AG (ADDYY) Chief Executive Officer Kasper Rorsted recently told The Wall Street Journal, this is how he must feel. Referring to NIKE, Inc.’s ( NKE ) new HyperAdapt 1.0, Rorsted stated, “I don't know if that's a save-the-world product.” \nPrior to the $720 self-lacing HyperAdapt 1.0, Adidas had stolen Nike’s thunder thanks to its classic Stan Smith shoes becoming popular again. Consumers are currently finding style in simplicity. These same consumers aren’t likely to go out and buy the $720 HyperAdapt 1.0, which are obviously expensive as well as difficult to purchase. Rorsted’s comment didn’t indicate fear about the current version of the HyperAdapt, but the future versions of that shoe, which are highly likely to be more affordable in order to target the masses. Since Nike has been working on the technology for more than a decade, it would be nearly impossible for Adidas to catch up if self-lacing sneakers became a trend. (See also, Adidas Takes on Nike & Under Armour in U.S .) \nRorsted is also likely frustrated because Adidas is focused on sustainability . According to Business Insider, Adidas is making sneakers from ocean plastic and biodegradable silk. Sustainability will play a role in future consumer decisions, but it unfortunately will not be as impactful as a new technology like self-lacing shoes. Once a few young consumers sport the cheaper version of these shoes in the future, everyone else is going to want them. That’s not going to happen with shoes that are made from ocean plastic. If self-lacing shoes resonate with consumers over the next several years, then Nike will once again run far ahead of the competition. \nNKE has depreciated 23.31% over the past 12 months and currently offers a dividend yield of 1.43%. \nADDYY has appreciated 46.98% over the past 12 months and currently offers a dividend yield of 1.23%.

      "text": "First Look at the Nike LeBron 14 LeBron James brings the shoe out for Cavs practice. \nA first look at the Nike LeBron 14 has emerged courtesy of the Cavs' social media. After news arrived last week about LeBron James wearing his next Nike sneakers in practice, the below video appears to depict just that. \nSunday morning workout # striveforgreatness A video posted by Cleveland Cavaliers ( @cavs ) on Dec 4, 2016 at 8: 18am PST \nUnsurprisingly, the video doesn't reveal too much of the design. What's more, it's in black and white so it's impossible to tell even the colorway on the sneaker. What's clearly visible is a hex-zoom arrangement on the sole and a strap (as described by the ESPN reporter who saw the shoes in practice), leading us to believe that this is indeed the LeBron 14. \nThe Nike LeBron 14 should be in stores by January, but don't be surprised if King James and Nike unveil the sneaker before then. \nRetail price on the Nike LeBron 14 should be set at $175 if news about the model's lower price holds.
