      "title": "News: Infoblox Brings Additional Network Control & Security to Microsoft Azure SANTA CLARA, Calif., Nov.",
      "text": "Posted By: News Infoblox Brings Additional Network Control & Security to Microsoft Azure SANTA CLARA, Calif., Nov. 16, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Infoblox Inc., which provides DNS, DHCP, and IP address management (DDI), today introduced Infoblox DDI for Microsoft Azure, a virtual appliance that delivers network control and security to the Azure cloud computing platform. With the addition of Azure, Infoblox now provides DNS, DHCP, and IP address management capabilities —the category known as DDI— across multiple cloud platforms including AWS, OpenStack, VMware and traditional on-premises networks. According to a survey among 1,000 North American and European enterprise infrastructure technology decision makers, 59 percent will adopt a hybrid cloud model in the next 12 months 1 . As companies are making the transition to a hybrid model, they have to operate in a multi-cloud, multi-platform environment which often includes traditional on-premises components as well. Legacy DDI approaches in the new cloud paradigm often negatively impact cloud agility due to manual processes, cause inconsistencies across hybrid deployments, and increase vulnerabilities that can lead to outages, security breaches and a poor end-user experience. “The network is the foundation for any business, and enabling our customers to keep their network strong, stable and secure, from any platform, is our top priority. By extending Infoblox’s Actionable Network Intelligence to Microsoft Azure, we’re offering our customers the ultimate in choice,” said Scott Fulton executive vice president of products at Infoblox. “Legacy DNS infrastructure is one of the most exploited parts of a network and often the hidden crack in the foundation that derails a business especially with next-generation, dynamic initiatives like public and hybrid cloud. Like the Millennium Towers luxury high-rise in San Francisco that is sinking and tilting, problems at the foundation can be notoriously hard to diagnose and can have costly, devastating impacts. Infoblox helps increase business speed and agility by making it fast and easy for IT teams to take charge of core network services and security through one unified platform.” Ryan McGee, director, Microsoft Security Marketing, Microsoft Corp. said, “The cloud brings tremendous speed and business agility with an automated process for spinning up storage and compute, but network configuration like DNS across hybrid environments is often complex and is still managed manually. Now, Azure customers can implement Infoblox’s DDI technology to automatically provision and manage core DNS infrastructure in Azure as part of the workflow, have visibility across disparate platforms, and accelerate the speed in which they can be up and running.” 1 Forrester, The Cloud Computing Playbook For 2016 , by Glenn O’Donnell, October 26, 2016 New Infoblox for Microsoft Azure Infoblox DDI for Azure manages DNS records and IP addresses and integrates seamlessly with an organization’s existing Infoblox infrastructure. The offering also supports DNS firewall security to detect infected workloads and help prevent the spread of malware. The benefits of Infoblox DDI for Azure include: Greater Agility . Infoblox DDI for Azure can reduce deployment times of virtual machines by eliminating manual processes and lengthy trouble ticket processes with automated provisioning and clean-up when VMs are destroyed. As a result, customers can eliminate bottlenecks in creating DNS for setting up virtual machines and deploying new applications in Azure. Consistency . Infoblox’s unified solution helps eliminate errors, reduce unplanned outages and ensure a uniform policy for DNS naming conventions and IP address assignments in a multi-cloud, multi-platform environment that includes Azure. Automated Discovery and Visibility . Infoblox provides network administrators visibility with non-disruptive, automatic discovery of virtual machines and resources in Azure and other cloud platforms, across geographic regions. This helps ensure that organizations meet security and compliance needs without manual overhead. Connectivity . API integrations allow additional automation including IP address assignment and integration with other workflow and orchestration tools. In addition to Azure, supported platforms include AWS, VMware, Microsoft, OpenStack, Cisco, HP, BMC, CA and Elasticbox. This broad support enables organizations to evolve their cloud strategy based on business needs, while maintaining consistent network-services infrastructures without costly and disruptive migrations. Pricing and Availability Infoblox DDI is available now in the Azure Marketplace: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace...-forvnios/ Pricing information is available from Infoblox sales representatives and channel partners. About Infoblox Infoblox delivers Actionable Network Intelligence to enterprise, government, and service provider customers around the world. As the industry leader in DNS, DHCP, and IP address management, the category known as DDI, Infoblox ( www.infoblox.com ) provides control and security from the core—empowering thousands of organizations to increase efficiency and visibility, reduce risk, and improve customer experience. \nMedia Contacts: Jill Reed Highwire PR for Infoblox infoblox@highwirepr.com (415) 963-4174, ext. 5 (0)",

      "title": "Nintendo and Xbox Congratulate Xbox On Their 15th Anniversary",
      "text": "\nFifteen years ago yesterday, Microsoft launched the original Xbox, throwing their gauntlet into the console gaming market, and kick starting their own odyssey, an unforgettable one that ended up contributing a lot to the modern gaming scene. And congratulating Microsoft on completing this milestone were none others than their biggest competitors in the market- Nintendo and Sony.\nPosting on their Twitter , Nintendo wished Xbox a ‘happy anniversary,’ congratulating them on ’15 fantastic years,’ a gesture that Microsoft really appreciated- the main Xbox account liked and retweeted the tweet, and multiple regional Xbox accounts all liked, retweeted, and responded to the tweet too. This seems to be another step in what appears to be growing closeness between Nintendo and Xbox- just recently, Nintendo had sent Xbox head Phil Spencer an NES Classic Mini ahead of its launch , for example.\nOn the other hand, PlayStation also wished Xbox a happy anniversary, with the PlayStation UK account congratulating Xbox with their tongue firmly in cheek . This kind of thing is great to see, because in the end, these companies don’t hate each other, and definitely have a lot of respect for each other. They all learn from each other, and they all need each other to succeed. Of course, that’s something that fans of none of these will ever understand, which is why fanboys exist, I suppose.",

Now Microsoft wants to take advantage of that position to encourage kids to program the game, not just play it.\nOn Tuesday, the company released a new online tutorial for Code.org's Hour of Code, a nonprofit effort sponsored by many tech companies to get children programming.\nIt'll look familiar to those who've used introductory programming projects like Google's Pencil Code or MIT's Scratch : Commands take the form of Lego-like pieces you snap together into a sequence that controls an on-screen character. Puzzles alternate with video tutorials explaining new programming concepts.\nProgramming isn't for everyone, but many schools and businesses are trying to expose students to it as a way to build skills for the 21st century, when tech is spreading beyond PCs and phones into cars, refrigerators , thermostats, and many other corners of our lives.\nPresident Barack Obama has endorsed the Code.org effort.\n\"If we want America to stay on the cutting edge, we need young Americans like you to master the tools and technology that will change the way we do just about everything,\" Obama said in a 2013 video. \"Don't just buy a new video game. Make one... Don't just play on your phone. Program it.\"",

Through this partnership, Microsoft and OpenAI will advance their mutual goal to democratize AI, so everyone can benefit from the technology. \nThis Tuesday, Microsoft announced it is partnering with OpenAI , the non-profit artificial intelligence (AI) research company founded and funded by Elon Musk and other industry luminaries. OpenAI seeks to develop AI to benefit all of humanity — a goal Microsoft isn’t foreign to, with its open-source deep learning software . \n“It’s great to work with another organization that believes in the importance of democratizing access to AI,” reads OpenAI’s official blog announcement about the partnership. For their part, Microsoft sees a valuable partner in OpenAI. As one spokesperson said in an interview for TechCrunch : “Through this partnership, Microsoft and OpenAI will advance their mutual goal to democratize AI, so everyone can benefit.” Shutterstock \nOpenAI will make Microsoft Azure its preferred cloud platform. “Azure has impressed us by building hardware configurations optimized for deep learning — they offer K80 GPUs with InfiniBand interconnects at scale,” says OpenAI. Azure is optimized for AI workloads, using its Azure Batch and Azure Machine Learning, coupled with Microsoft’s rebranded Cognitive Toolkit . \n“Microsoft Research researchers will partner with researchers at OpenAI to advance the state of AI and OpenAI will use Microsoft Azure and Microsoft‘s N-series hardware for their future research and development,” a Microsoft spokesperson explained. \nTrue to OpenAI’s democratic approach to AI research, they’ll make the results of their combined efforts publicly available.",

      "text": "0 0 \nMicrosoft’s Holiday update rolled out almost a week ago and with it came the wondrous convenience of organizing game sessions. Setting up group activities is now hassle-free and can be done online, instead of having to go over to your friend’s, to arrange a match. The update also features a bunch of new additions including clubs, Looking For Group and several other features available to the Xbox line and the Xbox app for Windows 10 . \nClubs are designed to achieve a game-changing way for Xbox users to connect to multiple consoles or Windows 10 PCs. Xbox Live Club enables gamers to connect on a consolidated platform and use it to save or share clips and screenshots or even communicate via the chat room feature. \nIf you are even a little impressed with the features we informed you about, of the Xbox Live Club , here are the steps you need to take to create a club. For Xbox One users Navigate to the Community Tab via the Xbox button and then selecting Home On the extreme right, you will spot the option Clubs on Xbox , select it and then choose Create a Club. Select your club’s type: Public Clubs: only members of the club are granted the permission to chat, while others can find the club, play it and browse through the club’s content. Private Clubs: only members of the club can play, browse through the club’s content and use the chat feature, but everyone can find the club. Hidden Clubs: visible only to the members of the club, while playing and chatting authorities, are also granted only to members. Pick an appropriate name for your club , and then select Continue . Also, keep in mind to make it as generic as possible so that it can be easily searchable. Add additional information about the Club, that will draw like-minded people to your club via the search option: Description Logo Descriptive tags Now, you are given the option to correlate your Club with specific games . While selecting games, note that these are going to be the ones your club will play frequently. Also, your Club will appear in the associated title’s Game Hubs. \nFor any future editing regarding the Club’s settings, you can do it via the Club homepage and selecting Customize . You can add a background, a profile picture, and add other personal touches to make your club look more lively. For PC users Navigate to the Windows 10 Xbox app , by typing “Xbox” into the Start Menu. In the left-side hamburger menu, select Clubs . In the top right-hand corner of the Clubs section, select Create a Club . Select your club’s type: Public Clubs: only members of the club are granted the permission to chat, while others can find the club, play it and browse through the club’s content. Private Clubs: only members of the club can play, browse through the club’s content and use the chat feature, but everyone can find the club. Hidden Clubs: visible only to the members of the club, while playing and chatting authorities, are also granted only to members. Pick an appropriate name for your club , and then select Continue . Also, keep in mind to make it as generic as possible so that it can be easily searchable. Add additional information about the Club, that will draw like-minded people to your club via the search option: Description Logo Descriptive tags Now, you are given the option to correlate your Club with specific games . While selecting games, note that these are going to be the ones your club will play frequently. Also, your Club will appear in the associated title’s Game Hubs. \nLooking at the bigger picture, it is safe to say that Xbox consoles need more light weight additions that could reduce the development complexity for the consoles. As far as Clubs are concerned, they are definitely going to drive a huge chunk of non-gamers towards the gaming realm. \nRELATED STORIES YOU NEED TO CHECK OUT:",

      "title": "Microsoft announces Visual Studio for Mac, preview of the next SQL Server with Linux and Docker support",
      "text": "Microsoft’s Connect(); 2016 developer event in New York City today had some big partnership announcements, including Google joining the .NET Foundation, Microsoft joining The Linux Foundation, and Samsung launching a preview of Visual Studio Tools for Tizen. But there was also a slew of updates for both Visual Studio and SQL Server: a preview of Visual Studio for Mac, a preview of the next version of SQL Server, and a preview of Azure App Service support for containers.\n“We want to help developers achieve more and capitalize on the industry’s shift toward cloud-first and mobile-first experiences using the tools and platforms of their choice,” Microsoft Cloud and enterprise executive vice president Scott Guthrie said in a statement. “By collaborating with the community to provide open, flexible and intelligent tools and cloud services, we’re helping every developer deliver unprecedented levels of innovation.”\nVisual Studio The fact Microsoft is bringing its IDE to macOS would have arguably been the biggest news of the day, had the company not leaked the information itself earlier this week. Still, a preview of Visual Studio for Mac is now available (requires OS X El Capitan 10.11 or higher), letting enables developers write cloud, mobile, and macOS apps on Apple’s desktop operating system using .NET and C#.\nIt’s a big deal, given that Microsoft once made a point of locking in developers by only offering its tools on Windows. This has changed over time, with a big highlight in April 2015 when Microsoft launched Visual Studio Code , its cross-platform code editor, for Windows, Mac, and Linux.\n\nNow Microsoft is taking the next step: making Visual Studio cross-platform. Inheriting from the mobile-centric Xamarin Studio and from Visual Studio for Windows, the IDE is supposed to encourage Mac and iOS developers to use Microsoft’s development tools, since they will no longer need a Windows computer or virtual machine to do so. It will hit general availability next year and Microsoft will eventually sunset Xamarin Studio.\nHere’s how Xamarin project manager Mikayla Hutchinson described the tool in the leak on Monday:\nAt its heart, Visual Studio for Mac is a macOS counterpart of the Windows version of Visual Studio. If you enjoy the Visual Studio development experience, but need or want to use macOS, you should feel right at home. Its UX is inspired by Visual Studio, yet designed to look and feel like a native citizen of macOS. And like Visual Studio for Windows, it’s complemented by Visual Studio Code for times when you don’t need a full IDE, but want a lightweight yet rich standalone source editor.\nBelow the surface, Visual Studio for Mac also has a lot in common with its siblings in the Visual Studio family. Its IntelliSense and refactoring use the Roslyn Compiler Platform; its project system and build engine use MSBuild; and its source editor supports TextMate bundles. It uses the same debugger engines for Xamarin and .NET Core apps, and the same designers for Xamarin.iOS and Xamarin.Android.\nCompatibility is a key focus of Visual Studio for Mac. Although it’s a new product and doesn’t support all of the Visual Studio project types, for those it does have in common it uses the same MSBuild solution and project format. If you have team members on macOS and Windows, or switch between the two OSes yourself, you can seamlessly share your projects across platforms. There’s no need for any conversion or migration.\nVisual Studio for Mac supports native iOS, Android, and Mac development via Xamarin, and server development via .NET Core with Azure integration. The C# language, with the latest C# 7 productivity enhancements, is naturally supported, as is F#, powered by the same F# compiler used in Visual Studio.\nBut that’s not all for the Visual Studio world. Xamarin co-founder and now Microsoft’s vice president of mobile developer tools Nat Friedman also shared some notable milestones with VentureBeat.\nVisual Studio 2015 has passed 20 million installs, with 14 million coming from the free community edition. Visual Studio Code passed 3.5 million installs and 1 million monthly active users.\nAlso worth noting is a preview of a new product called Visual Studio Mobile Center. Think of it as mission control for mobile app developers, which works for all apps regardless of programming language. Here’s the rub: It supports Android and iOS today, while Windows is “coming soon after.” \nSQL Server Microsoft announced the public preview of the next release of SQL Server, which for the first time runs on not just Windows , but Linux too . The new version lets you develop applications with SQL Server on Linux, Windows, Docker, or macOS (via Docker) and then deploy to Linux, Windows, or Docker, on-premises or in the cloud.\nIndeed, all major features of the relational database engine are coming to Linux. Native Linux installations are available with RPM and APT packages for Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Ubuntu Linux, and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server. The public preview on Windows and Linux will also soon be available on Azure Virtual Machines and as images on Docker Hub.\nR Services inside SQL Server have gained machine learning functions that are used by Microsoft’s own product teams. You can expect deep neural network functionality with increased speed, performance and scale, especially for handling a large corpus of text data and high-dimensional categorical data. \nMicrosoft also announced SQL Server 2016 SP1, which doesn’t follow the traditional service pack rules – it brings more than just bug fixes and improvements. “All developer friendly features restricted to enterprise edition are now going to be available to all editions from free to enterprise,” Rohan Kumar, general manager of Microsoft’s SQL team, told VentureBeat. As a result, you only need to upgrade editions based on performance and scale.\nSP1 brings a consistent programming model across SQL Server editions, meaning programs written using powerful SQL features such as in-memory OLTP and in-memory columnstore analytics and partitioning will work across Enterprise, Standard, and Express editions. In short, it’s now possible to adopt advanced features while supporting multiple editions of SQL Server.\nAzure At its event, Microsoft announced the general availability of Azure Data Lake Analytics and Azure Data Lake Store . The former is a cloud analytics service that lets you develop and run parallel data transformations and processing programs in U-SQL, R, Python, and .NET over petabytes of data with just a few lines of code. The latter is a cloud analytics data lake for enterprises that is secure, massively scalable, and built to the open HDFS standard.\nIt’s also worth noting that Microsoft has incorporated the technology that sits behind the Cognitive Services API inside U-SQL directly. Thus, you can now process any amount of unstructured data (text or images) and extract emotions, age, and all sorts of other cognitive features using Azure Data Lake. You can then perform queries by content. \nMicrosoft also announced a public preview of DocumentDB Emulator, which provides a local development experience for Azure DocumentDB. Using the emulator, you can develop and test your application without an internet connection, without creating an Azure subscription, and without incurring any costs. Lastly, .NET Core support has been added to DocumentDB, letting developers build cross platform applications and services that use DocumentDB API.\nMicrosoft made three more smaller announcements to round out all the developer news: the general availability of R Server for Azure HDInsight , the public preview of Kafka for HDInsight , and the availability of Operational Analytics for Azure SQL Database .\n",

      "text": "Satya Nadella speaks at Microsoft Ignite 2016 (Photo by GeekWire/Kevin Lisota) Microsoft is taking increasingly bolder steps toward the openness it has embraced under CEO Satya Nadella, announcing today that it’s joining the Linux Foundation as a platinum member. Microsoft is also releasing a public preview of the next version of SQL Server for Linux and making public-cloud competitor Google a member of its .NET Foundation technical steering committee.\nThose announcements and others are slated for release today at Microsoft’s online developers’ event Connect 2016 , now in its third year, with a tagline that once would have been unimaginable for the Redmond company: “Any developer, any application, any platform.”\n“Joining the Linux Foundation would have been crazy talk if it weren’t for other announcements in the last couple of years like the Red Hat partnership, open-sourcing .NET , and running SQL Server on Linux ,” said Al Hilwa, IDC’s program director for software-development research. “The motivation here is to build out the cloud business around Linux workloads and to sell tools to a broader set of developers than just Windows developers.”\nSo much has changed since then-Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer called Linux a “cancer.” Even Ballmer has taken it back .\nMicrosoft’s trajectory toward openness “is a breath of fresh air to me, because I feel in my bones we’re doing the right things,” said Mitra Azizirad, corporate VP of cloud application development and data marketing, in a recent interview.\nToday, 36 percent of .NET core downloads are from developers totally new to Microsoft, and two-thirds of .NET core contributions are coming from outside developers, she said, calling the trend “hugely gratifying.” Microsoft is emerging as a major contributor to software-sharing site GitHub. And joining the Linux Foundation is “evidence of our turning the corner in our relationship with the open-source community,” Azizirad said.\nMitra Azizirad News broke earlier this week that Microsoft is bringing Visual Studio to Mac, nearly 20 years after that product’s debut. Visual Studio for MacOS came about through Microsoft’s purchase of San Francisco-based startup Xamarin in February, Azizirad said. “We went (into that purchase) with the intention of providing this,” she said.\nIt’s apparently not a direct port of Visual Studio but rather a slightly different product. The Register quoted Mikayla Hutchinson, Microsoft’s senior program manager for the Xamarin platform, as calling it “a new product . . . (that) doesn’t support all of the Visual Studio project types.” She added, though, that projects can be easily shared between Visual Studio for Windows and for MacOS. Microsoft declined to comment on the matter.\nAt Connect 2016, Microsoft will announce a preview version of Visual Studio tools for Tizen, the open-source operating system used by Samsung and others in smartphones, tables, appliances and other devices. It will also release a .NET software-development kit for C# developers to build apps that run on that operating system.\nMicrosoft has changed pretty radically since the days when co-founder and then-CEO Bill Gates declared its goal to be “a computer on every desk and in every home, running Microsoft software.” It has dumped unprofitable businesses like portable music players, made Office free on some devices, and adapted to a world in which many developers use multiple languages and products interchangeably.\n“I’ve been at Microsoft for 25 years, and I don’t think I can stay another 25, but I wish I could,” Azizirad said. “That’s how energized I am about the changes we’re seeing here.”",

      "text": "Microsoft announces SQL Server v.Next for Windows and Linux Posted Microsoft joins the Linux Foundation \nMicrosoft’s announcement that it was bringing its flagship SQL Server database software to Linux came as a major surprise when the company first announced this in March. Until now, the preview was invite-only but as Microsoft announced today, anybody who wants to give it a try can now download the bits . That public preview is part of the launch of SQL Server v.Next, the upcoming version of SQL server, which will be available for Windows and Linux. \nThanks to its support for Docker containers, even macOS users will be able to run it. Indeed, Microsoft is betting on containers as one of the main distribution mechanisms for the preview, which will soon be available on Azure Virtual Machines and the Docker Hub (though you can obviously also download RPM and APT packages for popular enterprise Linux distributions like Red Hat, Ubuntu and SUSE). \n“This represents a major step in our journey to making SQL Server a true platform of choice across operating systems, development languages, data types, on-premises and the cloud,” Microsoft writes in today’s announcement. \nFor now, the Linux version will include all the standard SQL Server management features that come with the Windows version. These include advanced features like always-encrypted and row-level security, as well as in-memory columnstores. \nAs Microsoft corporate VP Julia Liuson told me, it won’t include the business intelligence stack yet (though this part will be added over time). For users, though, what’s maybe most important is that they will soon be able to run SQL Server on Linux and in Linux-based Docker containers, giving them more choice in how they want to deploy their databases (assuming they decide to go with SQL Server and not one of its competitors, of course). \nSQL Server v.Next will include improved support for R Services and a number of new machine learning and deep neural networking features. \nSQL Server for Linux is just another example of how Microsoft’s view of competing platforms has changed in recent years. This move would’ve been unthinkable under its former CEO Steve Ballmer. Under Satya Nadella, however, the company’s mission is to bring its services and tools to where its customers are, even if that’s not on a Microsoft-owned operating system. \nIn addition to the SQL Server for Linux news, Microsoft also today announced the preview of Linux support for Azure App Service . Oh, and in order to puts its money where its mouth it, Microsoft is also joining the Linux Foundation. \nFor SQL Server users on Windows, Microsoft also today announced both the release of the first service pack for SQL Server 2016, as well as a change to its pricing structure: all SQL Server users — including those using free edition — will now get access to the developer features that were previously restricted to the Enterprise edition. 0",

      "text": "Microsoft joins the Linux Foundation Posted Spoiler Alert raises $2.5 million to stop food waste, abate hunger \nHow is this for a surprise: Microsoft today announced that it is joining the Linux Foundation as a high-paying Platinum member . \n“This may come as a surprise to you, but they were not big fans,” Linux Foundation executive director Jim Zemlin told me about his foundation’s history with Microsoft. The new Microsoft under CEO Satya Nadella, however, is singing a very different tune. Today’s Microsoft is one of the biggest open source contributors around. Over the course of just the last few years, it has essentially built Canonical’s Ubuntu distribution into Windows 10, brought SQL Server to Linux, open-sourced core parts of its .NET platform and partnered with Red Hat, SUSE and others. As Zemlin noted, Microsoft has also contributed to a number of Linux Foundation-managed projects like Node.js, OpenDaylight, the Open Container Initiative, the R Consortium and the Open API Initiative. \nDespite all of that, today’s announcement will still come as a surprise to many, given that Microsoft and the Linux community often felt like they were at war with each other in the past. Zemlin acknowledged as much when I talked to him. “There will be some skepticism, but that will be from a smaller group,” he said. “There is an anti-establishment sentiment in open source. That’s natural.” He added that whenever a major corporation goes open source, that’s what happens. But he also noted that Microsoft has been “walking this talk for a very long time” now. \nJohn Gossman, an architect on the Azure team, will join the Linux Foundation Board of Directors. 0",

      "title": "Microsoft joins The Linux Foundation as a Platinum member",
      "text": "At its Connect(); 2016 developer event in New York City today, Microsoft announced it is joining The Linux Foundation . And the company isn’t joining just to say it did: Microsoft is becoming a Platinum member, the highest level of membership , which costs $500,000 annually. John Gossman, architect on the Microsoft Azure team, will sit on the foundation’s Board of Directors and help underwrite projects.\nThe Linux Foundation is a non-profit technology group that advances open technology development and commercial adoption, not just for Linux. It provides tools, training, and events to scale any open source project. Microsoft already contributes to several of its projects, including Node.js Foundation, OpenDaylight, Open Container Initiative, R Consortium, and Open API Initiative.\nMicrosoft is pitching the move as its latest effort to work more closely with the open source community, benefiting its customers through increased collaboration and innovation. And The Linux Foundation agrees.\n“Microsoft has grown and matured in its use of and contributions to open source technology,” The Linux Foundation executive director Jim Zemlin said in a statement. “The company has become an enthusiastic supporter of Linux and of open source and a very active member of many important projects. Membership is an important step for Microsoft, but also for the open source community at large, which stands to benefit from the company’s expanding range of contributions.”\nWe interviewed Zemlin, who was excited to elaborate more on the news, noting that The Linux Foundation and Microsoft started having conversations about a membership earlier this year. “On behalf of our entire board, I think people are excited to see them join,” Zemlin told VentureBeat. “This is just another example of Microsoft participating broadly in the open source community, and we welcome it.”\nGiven Microsoft’s aversion — and that’s putting it lightly — to open source in the past, this is once again another milestone showing the company has indeed turned a new leaf. Zemlin called the announcement a “symbolic moment,” shared that “the feeling is one of historic precedent,” and declared that “Microsoft is being a good citizen.”\nMicrosoft naturally stands to benefit as well, and not just in terms of PR. In addition to taking an active role in making the organization better, the membership means the company can better collaborate with the open source community to improve mobile and cloud technology that millions rely on. The other 10 Platinum members are Cisco, Fujitsu, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Huawei, IBM, Intel, NEC, Oracle, Qualcomm, and Samsung.\n“As a cloud platform company we aim to help developers achieve more using the platforms and languages they know,” Scott Guthrie, executive vice president of Microsoft’s Cloud and Enterprise Group, said in a statement. “The Linux Foundation is home not only to Linux, but many of the community’s most innovative open source projects. We are excited to join The Linux Foundation and partner with the community to help developers capitalize on the shift to intelligent cloud and mobile experiences.”\n",

It’s doing so by leveraging the work of Xamarin, the cross-platform development company it acquired earlier this year , and the open source MonoDevelop IDE that also forms the basis of the Xamarin Studio IDE. \nAfter the acquisition closed, I sat down with Xamarin co-founder Nat Friedman and Microsoft’s corporate vice president Julia Liuson to talk about the future of Xamarin’s tools under Microsoft. At the time, Friedman told me that “if Xamarin could over time earn the honor of representing Visual Studio on Mac, that would be great.” That time has now come and as Liuson told me earlier this month, this was the plan all along. \nVisual Studio for Mac does take it design cues from its Windows brethren and comes with the usual core tools like IntelliSense plus Xamarin’s cross-platform development tools. This means you can now use Visual Studio for Mac to develop for apps for iOS, Android, Windows and macOS. \nYou can now download the preview of Visual Studio for Mac here . 0",

      "text": "\nAt Connect() developer event, Microsoft today announced the release of Visual Studio 2017 RC. It comes with support for automated tasks and improved navigation, as well as with immediate feedback on the quality and state of your code. Visual Studio 2017 RC makes use of the Visual Studio 2015 investment in Roslyn to include tons of cool new features.\nNavigating Code: When developers drill into a bug, discover the implications of a refactoring, or work to grok an unfamiliar code base, they rely on the accuracy and ease of code navigation. This release delivers a greatly improved navigation experience—with Find All References, GoTo and Indent Guides—to get you from A to B with greater confidence and fewer distractions (even in large code bases).\nWriting and Reading Code: Along with navigation, developers spend a lot of time writing and reading code. Visual Studio 2017 RC focuses on facilitating the writing of correct code, as well as maintaining the readability of developer code bases. Building on features in Visual Studio 2015, this release provides a refined IntelliSense experience, more refactorings and code fixes, and customizable code-style configuration and enforcement.\nTesting Code: Visual Studio 2017 RC introduces Live Unit Testing for C# and Visual Basic. Live Unit Testing analyzes data generated at run time to run only impacted tests after an edit and provides immediate feedback on the status of the tests in the editor. These inline visualizations appear on a line-by-line basis:\nIf a line of executable code is hit by at least one failing test, it’s decorated with a red “x.” If a line of executable code is hit by all passing tests, it’s decorated with a green checkmark. If a line of executable code is hit by no tests, it’s decorated with a blue dash. Debugging Code: When all else fails, developers rely on debugging to help them identify the source of an issue. Visual Studio 2017 RC saves you time by reducing the number of actions required to step through a program and to drill into exception information.\nYou can download it here . Learn more about this release at VisualStudio.com.\n",

      "text": "\nA couple of days back, we reported that Microsoft is releasing Visual Studio for Mac . At Connect developer event today, Microsoft officially announced the Visual Studio for Mac. This new IDE is based on Xamarin Studio, but its UX is inspired by Visual Studio on Windows.\nAs you expect from a Visual Studio product, its IntelliSense and refactoring use the Roslyn Compiler Platform. And it uses the same debugger engines for Xamarin and .NET Core apps, and the same designers for Xamarin.iOS and Xamarin.Android. For now, it doesn’t support all of the Visual Studio project types, but If you have team members on MacOS and Windows, or switch between the two OSes yourself, you can seamlessly share your projects across platforms. Visual Studio for Mac supports native iOS, Android and Mac development via Xamarin, and server development via .NET Core with Azure integration. It supports C# and F# languages as well.\nVisual Studio for Mac is based on the open source MonoDevelop IDE and it has a rich extensibility model. Developers can use to add their own functionality ranging from simple editor commands to entirely new languages and project types.\nYou can download the preview today here. \n",

Ltd. to enable .NET developers to build apps for more than 50 million Samsung devices worldwide. Guthrie also demonstrated a preview of Visual Studio for Mac, which enables developers to write cloud, mobile and macOS apps on Apple's Mac operating system using the popular development environment; a preview of the next version of the company's flagship SQL Server database with support for Linux, Linux-based Docker containers and Windows-based environments; and a preview of Azure App Service on Linux with support for containers. \"We want to help developers achieve more and capitalize on the industry's shift toward cloud-first and mobile-first experiences using the tools and platforms of their choice,\" Guthrie said. \"By collaborating with the community to provide open, flexible and intelligent tools and cloud services, we're helping every developer deliver unprecedented levels of innovation.\" Collaborating with the community As part of its effort to work more closely with the open source community, Microsoft on Wednesday announced it has joined the Linux Foundation as a Platinum Member. Microsoft's membership in the Linux Foundation will benefit customers through increased collaboration and innovation among a diverse ecosystem. \"By becoming a Linux Foundation Platinum member, Microsoft is better able to collaborate with the open source community to deliver transformative mobile and cloud experiences to more people,\" said Jim Zemlin , executive director of The Linux Foundation. \"Microsoft has been a key contributor to many projects, and we see the company intensifying its involvement and commitment to open development.\" Microsoft has become an active member of the open source community in part through the popularity of its open source and cross-platform application framework .NET Core. Wednesday's addition of Google to the .NET Foundation's Technical Steering Group further reinforces the vibrancy of the .NET developer community as well as Google's commitment to fostering an open platform that supports businesses and developers who have standardized on .NET. Other industry leaders are also betting on .NET Core for their own commercial products. On Wednesday Samsung is releasing a preview of its Visual Studio Tools for Tizen. Developers can use the tools to build .NET apps for the Tizen operating system that runs on millions of Samsung TVs, wearables, mobile devices and many IoT devices around the world. Tools for any developer on any platform Microsoft highlighted several announcements Wednesday aimed at helping developers use the tools of their choice to create Android, iOS and Windows apps powered by Linux or Windows Server, including the following: The SQL Server on Linux public preview released Wednesday is the first preview of the next version of SQL Server and brings the power of SQL Server to Linux and Linux-based Docker containers, in addition to Windows. A new Visual Studio for Mac preview provides a macOS-based integrated development environment designed for building mobile, cloud and macOS apps. The availability of Azure App Service on Linux with support for Containers in preview provides native Linux support for Node.js and PHP stacks on Azure App Service and now enables developers to bring their own Docker-formatted container image. Enabling better apps through the intelligent cloud Today's most impactful apps are using data to delight users and drive business outcomes. Microsoft today unveiled unique capabilities and services that make it easier for more developers to turn massive amounts of data into deeply personal, intelligent and predictive applications. SQL Server 2016 Service Pack 1 availability makes database innovations accessible to more applications across product editions. The availability of Azure Data Lake services , Azure Data Lake Analytics and Data Lake Store means developers and data scientists now have the capabilities required to easily store and process data at petabyte size files, with massively parallel analytics and enterprise-grade security for insights on data of any size, shape and speed. Improving the end-to-end developer experience Microsoft's solutions evolve with changing developer needs. Through the Visual Studio family, SQL Server, Windows, Office and Azure, Microsoft is working to provide the most complete platform for application innovation, spanning mobile and cloud.

      "text": "NEW YORK—At its first Connect event in 2013, Microsoft released Visual Studio 2013. In 2014, it announced the open sourcing of .NET, and in 2015, the open sourcing of the Visual Studio Code editor. The big news this year? Microsoft, the company that has built an empire on proprietary, closed-source software, has joined the Linux Foundation as a platinum member.\nMicrosoft has been a big contributor to Linux over the past several years, primarily focusing on improving support for its Hyper-V hypervisor. Jim Zemlin, executive director of the Linux Foundation, said that in becoming a member, \"Microsoft is better able to collaborate with the open source community to deliver transformative mobile and cloud experiences to more people.\"\nMicrosoft's increasing commitment to open source has been met with some cynicism (and please, beloved commenters—try to refrain from \"embrace, extend, extinguish\" posts, as the very concept is preposterous when it comes to Linux), but with projects such as Visual Studio Code and .NET, is starting to win hearts and minds. The company does appear to be a reasonably good open source citizen, not merely publishing source code repositories that are occasionally updated from an internal development branch, but actually performing development in the open, accepting community contributions, and seeking community consensus when it comes to new features.\nThis leads to a second surprise membership: Google is joining the .NET Foundation and will be part of the Steering Group. While some parts of Google have been very warm to some Microsoft projects—in particular, the developers of the Angular framework are fans of the TypeScript language and Visual Studio Code—this nonetheless feels like a surprising move. Google has shown little interest in .NET, and with Android is in fact heavily invested in Java, .NET's major competitor. However, .NET is still a major part of corporate development, and it would likely serve the company well to improve .NET support in Google Cloud Platform, if nothing else.\nSamsung is already a member of the .NET Foundation, and has .NET news today too: The company is releasing a preview of Visual Studio Tools for Tizen, allowing developers to build .NET applications for Samsung's non-Android smart devices, such as TVs, wearables, and Internet of Things gizmos.\nOne of the pieces of news that Microsoft hoped would make a big splash was the release of Visual Studio for Mac ; unfortunately the company spoiled the surprise itself, by publishing the news prematurely. The name is a little misleading, as the new Mac development environment is a derivative of Xamarin Studio rather than a port of Visual Studio. As we wrote on Monday, they're not completely separate: core portions are identical between the two, and Mac and Windows developers will be able to share projects between platforms with ease.\nAgain spoiled by Redmond, the next version of Visual Studio has a name, too: it's Visual Studio 2017, and there is a release candidate is out today.\nSQL Server 2016 Service Pack 1 is also out today. This would normally not be tremendously interesting news, but this Service Pack has a difference. Traditionally, the different versions of SQL Server (Express, Standard, and Enterprise, from smallest to largest) have offered different features. They're all built on the same core engine, but some capabilities, such as in-memory transactional databases, were only available in the more expensive versions. This made it hard for developers to justify using those features; if customers may be using a mix of Standard and Enterprise, for example, many developers will stick with the Standard feature set, and ignore Enterprise capabilities.\nService Pack 1 makes all SQL Server versions functionally identical. They still have differences in terms of the number of processor cores and amount RAM they can use, but going forward, that's the only difference between SKUs. Microsoft's hope is that this will result in greater adoption of previously high-end features such as data warehousing and transparent database encryption. The company made a similar change with Windows Server licensing a few years ago, broadly unifying features across SKUs, using the different price points to govern hardware scaling and virtual machine licensing.\nAlongside this, the company is releasing a preview edition of the next version of SQL Server—for Windows and, for the first time, Linux. In developing SQL Server for Linux , the company says that it was strived to make the database engine work and act like a native Linux application to as great an extent as possible. Installation, for example, will use RPM or DEB packages (depending on distribution), and it will support running within Docker containers. Microsoft is not offering full feature parity in this release, but it says that all the major engine features, including the in-memory capabilities and encryption, will be cross-platform. Major administration will continue to use the Visual Studio-based tooling that the Windows edition uses; for most intents and purposes, the two versions should be interchangeable, with few differences visible to developers.\nThe initial announcement of SQL Server for Linux caught many off-guard, as it wasn't immediately clear who would want to use it, or why. That's now becoming somewhat clearer: avoiding Oracle. SQL Server has a rich and diverse feature set (especially with the feature unification across SKUs), and is typically somewhat cheaper than Oracle. That makes it appealing even to Linux shops.",

      "text": "print Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella Microsoft \nIf 2016 weren't weird enough already, here's something else to add to the notion that the end times are approaching: Microsoft is embracing Google, Apple, Samsung and even the free Linux operating system in ways it never has before. \nHere's the quick rundown of the news, coming out of the Microsoft Connect event for programmers: Microsoft will be joining the Linux Foundation, which oversees the development of the very popular free operating system Linux. Microsoft spent much of the '90s fiercely competing with Linux , seeing it as a threat to the dominance of Windows, so this is a notable deal. Microsoft is also releasing a public preview edition of its previously-announced SQL Server database product for Linux . Google is joining the steering committe of the .NET Foundation, the independent nonprofit that Microsoft set up in 2014 to oversee the community around the .NET Programming Framework, its very popular set of technologies for building software, particularly software for businesses and for the web. Samsung is working with Microsoft to let programmers use .NET to develop apps for Tizen operating system, popular on Samsung smart TVs and other gadgets made by the South Korean company. Last, but not least, Microsoft will be releasing a version of Visual Studio for Apple's Macs . Microsoft accidentally revealed this news earlier this week when it published a blog entry ahead of schedule. \nJulia Liuson, Microsoft's corporate VP of the developer division, says ever since the company embraced open source technologies and a more partner-friendly attitude , it's been winning over converts who may otherwise never have looked at Microsoft products. \n\"We're really finding fans everywhere,\" Liuson says. \nMicrosoft Executive VP of Cloud and Enterprise Scott Guthrie Microsoft \nFor instance, she says, a team at Google is using Visual Studio Code, Microsoft's free lightweight code editor, to build the Chrome browser. That's gives Microsoft some major brownie points, given Google's reputation as one of the arbiters of cool in Silicon Valley's programmer scene. \nWhich brings us back around to that veritable mountain of announcements. The whole point is to take Microsoft's improving image in the developer world, and solidify it by making some lasting, formal partnerships. 'Better than the picture' \nAnother Google example: Liuson says the team behind the Google Cloud platform kept reaching out to Microsoft with questions about .NET, because their own customers wanted to use it to build their software. Now, Google is officially helping steer the future of .NET, ideally making it better for customers of both companies. \n\"We're really building one of the biggest and the most robust ecosystems,\" says Liuson. \nSimilarly, for the last few years, Microsoft has loved trotting out a picture of Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella proclaiming his love for the Linux operating system. It's the first image in this article. \nWhile Linux never caught on as a proper competitor to Windows or Mac on PCs, it's the operating system of choice for many millions of servers in the world, and Microsoft supports it in its Azure cloud to great enthusiasm. \nXamarin co-founder Miguel de Icaza on stage at Microsoft Build in 2014 Xamarin \nNow, by signing on as a member of the Linux Foundation, it just proves to the world that its love is real, which has the nice benefit of helping Microsoft prove to developers that Azure is committed to supporting Linux. \n\"We have something better than the picture,\" Liuson says. \nAlong those lines, Visual Studio for Mac — based heavily on the Xamarin Studio product, which Microsoft got in its purchase of Xamarin earlier this year — is a play to appeal to those many programmers who mainly code on their Macs, but might benefit from some Microsoft technologies. \nThe bottom line is, Microsoft is showing a willingness to work with competitors and their platforms if it makes developers, still the company's most important customers, happy. When those customers are happy, they spend more time on Microsoft's playground. And with these announcements, they're committing to fair play. \n\"The excitement is real,\" Liuson says.",

      "text": " 35 AM EST Checkmarx Furthers Agile and Secure Development for Microsoft Visual Studio Teams Checkmarx, a global leader in application security testing, today announced a new Checkmarx plugin for the Microsoft Visual Studio Team Services platform. \nCheckmarx , a global leader in application security testing, today announced a new Checkmarx plugin for the Microsoft Visual Studio Team Services platform. The new Checkmarx (CxSAST) Microsoft Visual Studio Team Services Plugin allows organizations with agile development practices to embed security into their software development lifecycle (SDLC) without the delays traditionally caused by application security testing. \nSoftware development is now occurring at unprecedented speeds. According to Puppet’s State of DevOps survey, high-performing IT organizations deploy 200 times more frequently than low performers. As organizations increasingly turn to DevOps, Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) to help automate and increase deployment speed, it’s crucial for security to keep pace. Creating a Rugged DevOps team that can seamlessly bring security into the DevOps process isn't always easy, as many security solutions and developer practices don’t perfectly align. \nThe Checkmarx plug-in for Microsoft Visual Studio Team Services integrates seamlessly into Visual Studio team’s SDLC, enabling early detection and remediation of crucial security flaws. This allows teams to efficiently fix flaws as part of the CI toolchain, without imposing delays on the DevOps or CI/CD deployment cycle. Other benefits of using the Checkmarx Static Source Code Analysis include: Faster feedback loop - Checkmarx’s unique incremental scan capability means only new or modified code (that hasn't been scanned before) along with the related dependencies will be scanned. This means scan time is reduced from hours to minutes, perfect for organizations using CI/CD. Set your risk threshold and automate - Checkmarx allows users to easily set an organization’s security thresholds to an acceptable risk level. Users can then decide if they want to break builds based on whether scans met the thresholds or not. Saves precious remediation time: Checkmarx doesn’t leave a long list of vulnerabilities to remediate, but actually goes a step further and uses algorithms to correlate the different findings and identify the best fix locations which can eliminate multiple vulnerabilities with a single fix. This unique capability optimizes the remediation process and cuts down developer hours dedicated to remediation by up to 80 percent. Seamless integration: The Checkmarx plugin for Visual Studio Team Services platform is simple to install and configure. Visual Studio users can simply install CxSAST from the Visual Studio marketplace. \n“Checkmarx equips CI/CD and DevOps teams with a seamless way to integrate security into their development practices and “push security left” so developers are empowered to deliver secure code without slowing down development” said Moshe Lerner, senior vice president, Product Strategy and Corporate Development at Checkmarx. “To ensure minimal impact on development cycles, it’s important to work with security testing solutions that can automate your security scans and integrate with your existing IDEs, source repository and build servers, which is what we’ve done with Visual Studio Team Services. We’re excited to be a part of such a vibrant and growing ecosystem.” \nShawn Nandi, senior director, Microsoft Corp. said, “Development teams are looking for ways to reduce security risks while also accelerating the DevOps cycle. Checkmarx’s integration with Visual Studio Team Services tackles this problem head-on by scanning your code as part of the pull request in the Continuous Integration flow.” \nThe Checkmarx Static Source Code Analysis (CxSAST) Microsoft Visual Studio Team Services Plugin has been launched in beta and is available here . A short video describing the plugin’s unique capabilities, can be viewed here \nAbout Checkmarx Checkmarx is an Application Security software company, whose mission is to provide enterprise organizations with application security testing products and services that empower developers to deliver secure applications.

Especially in Agile environments, dependent components (e.g., APIs, 3rd-party services, databases, mainframes, etc.) connected to the application under test are not readily accessible for development and testing because they are still evolving, beyond a team's control, or too costly/complex to configure in a test lab. With service virtualization, testing and development can proceed without waiting for access to the actual dependent components. \nParasoft's service virtualization solution, which was recently named the leading innovator by voke Research , is recognized for its unique environment-based approach. The combination of Microsoft Azure, Microsoft VSTS, and Parasoft Service Virtualization—operating natively within the Microsoft environment—is designed to provide teams the rapid, scalable, and flexible test environment access required for Agile, DevOps, and \"Continuous Everything.\" \n“We're excited to collaborate with Parasoft to give VSTS users direct access to service virtualization within their preferred development environment,” said Clemri Steyn, Visual Studio ALM & DevOps Product Marketing team lead. “VSTS users are rapidly delivering some of the most innovative technologies on the market. This addition to their toolset will help them increase their velocity even further by removing integration and test constraints tied to unavailable or expensive testing environments.\" \nMark Lambert, Parasoft VP of Products, added, \"We are thrilled to extend Parasoft’s service virtualization technology directly into the industry-leading Microsoft ecosystem. Azure deployment lets users access lightweight, scalable simulated test environments that are perfect for Continuous Testing and performance testing. Moreover, the ability to automate our 'deploy and destroy' strategy as VSTS build tasks will help organizations expose critical defects early and stop high-risk release candidates from progressing along the delivery pipeline.\" \nAbout the Parasoft-Microsoft Service Virtualization Solution \nParasoft Service Virtualization is available now on the Microsoft Azure and Microsoft VSTS Marketplaces. Parasoft Service Virtualization provides two license models: hourly-billing consumption or bring your own license. Additional details about Parasoft Service Virtualization for Microsoft VSTS and Azure—including videos, case studies, and getting started guides—are available on the Parasoft Microsoft Service Virtualization web site . \nAbout Parasoft \nParasoft researches and develops software solutions that help organizations deliver defect-free software efficiently. To combat the risk of software failure while accelerating the SDLC, Parasoft offers a Development Testing Platform and Continuous Testing Platform. Parasoft's enterprise and embedded development solutions are the industry's most comprehensive—including static analysis, unit testing, requirements traceability, coverage analysis, API testing, dev/test environment management, service virtualization and more.

      "text": "Katharine Schwab 11.16.16 10:32 AM \nAn estimated 8% of the population suffers from some kind of colorblindness. Some high-tech solutions exists, such as these color-correcting glasses that cost hundreds of dollars . But two Microsoft engineers set out to create a more accessible way to help the colorblind. \nDuring a Microsoft hackathon, the software engineers Tom Overton and Tingting Zhu came up with Color Binoculars , an iPhone app released by Microsoft Garage that uses the phone's camera to apply a filter. The filter increases contrast between two hard-to-distinguish colors or adjusts an image so that colors are easier to tell apart, such as adjusting reds to pinks for those with red-green colorblindness. But you don't have to take a picture or video to see the filter—the app applies filters to the camera's live preview—and the app adapts to three kinds of colorblindness. \nOverton, who is colorblind himself and struggles with red and green in particular, says that the app helps him figure out when food is done based on its changing colors. It would also help with picking out matching clothes, choosing home decor, and even just enjoying fall colors. \nThe project fits right into Microsoft's renewed emphasis on accessibility in design. Practicing inclusivity by designing products that benefit everyone , including people with disabilities, has become an integral part of the company's ethos and has informed the design of products like Cortana, Skype Translator, and the learning tools for OneNote. \n[All Images: via Color Binoculars ]  ",

      "title": "Microsoft contributes to open ecosystem by joining Linux Foundation and welcoming Google to the .NET community",
      "text": " 30 AM EST Microsoft contributes to open ecosystem by joining Linux Foundation and welcoming Google to the .NET community \nNEW YORK , Nov. 16, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- On Wednesday, during its annual Connect(); developer event, Microsoft Corp. unveiled a series of products and partnerships that strengthen the company's Azure cloud platform for building intelligent, cross-platform apps and services. Microsoft Cloud and Enterprise Executive Vice President Scott Guthrie detailed significant steps Microsoft is taking to empower the ecosystem by giving developers greater choice in the tools they use — including joining the Linux Foundation as a Platinum Member to better collaborate with the open source community, welcoming Google to the independent .NET Foundation, and working with Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. to enable .NET developers to build apps for more than 50 million Samsung devices worldwide. \nGuthrie also demonstrated a preview of Visual Studio for Mac, which enables developers to write cloud, mobile and macOS apps on Apple's Mac operating system using the popular development environment; a preview of the next version of the company's flagship SQL Server database with support for Linux, Linux-based Docker containers and Windows-based environments; and a preview of Azure App Service on Linux with support for containers. \n\"We want to help developers achieve more and capitalize on the industry's shift toward cloud-first and mobile-first experiences using the tools and platforms of their choice,\" Guthrie said. \"By collaborating with the community to provide open, flexible and intelligent tools and cloud services, we're helping every developer deliver unprecedented levels of innovation.\" \nCollaborating with the community As part of its effort to work more closely with the open source community, Microsoft on Wednesday announced it has joined the Linux Foundation as a Platinum Member. Microsoft's membership in the Linux Foundation will benefit customers through increased collaboration and innovation among a diverse ecosystem. \n\"By becoming a Linux Foundation Platinum member, Microsoft is better able to collaborate with the open source community to deliver transformative mobile and cloud experiences to more people,\" said Jim Zemlin , executive director of The Linux Foundation. \"Microsoft has been a key contributor to many projects, and we see the company intensifying its involvement and commitment to open development.\" \nMicrosoft has become an active member of the open source community in part through the popularity of its open source and cross-platform application framework .NET Core. Wednesday's addition of Google to the .NET Foundation's Technical Steering Group further reinforces the vibrancy of the .NET developer community as well as Google's commitment to fostering an open platform that supports businesses and developers who have standardized on .NET. \nOther industry leaders are also betting on .NET Core for their own commercial products. On Wednesday Samsung is releasing a preview of its Visual Studio Tools for Tizen. Developers can use the tools to build .NET apps for the Tizen operating system that runs on millions of Samsung TVs, wearables, mobile devices and many IoT devices around the world. \nTools for any developer on any platform Microsoft highlighted several announcements Wednesday aimed at helping developers use the tools of their choice to create Android, iOS and Windows apps powered by Linux or Windows Server, including the following: The SQL Server on Linux public preview released Wednesday is the first preview of the next version of SQL Server and brings the power of SQL Server to Linux and Linux-based Docker containers, in addition to Windows. A new Visual Studio for Mac preview provides a macOS-based integrated development environment designed for building mobile, cloud and macOS apps. The availability of Azure App Service on Linux with support for Containers in preview provides native Linux support for Node.js and PHP stacks on Azure App Service and now enables developers to bring their own Docker-formatted container image. \nEnabling better apps through the intelligent cloud Today's most impactful apps are using data to delight users and drive business outcomes. Microsoft today unveiled unique capabilities and services that make it easier for more developers to turn massive amounts of data into deeply personal, intelligent and predictive applications. SQL Server 2016 Service Pack 1 availability makes database innovations accessible to more applications across product editions. The availability of Azure Data Lake services , Azure Data Lake Analytics and Data Lake Store means developers and data scientists now have the capabilities required to easily store and process data at petabyte size files, with massively parallel analytics and enterprise-grade security for insights on data of any size, shape and speed. \nImproving the end-to-end developer experience Microsoft's solutions evolve with changing developer needs. Through the Visual Studio family, SQL Server, Windows, Office and Azure, Microsoft is working to provide the most complete platform for application innovation, spanning mobile and cloud. The Visual Studio Mobile Center preview announced Wednesday brings together the cloud and life-cycle services that help developers build, test, distribute and monitor apps built in Objective-C, Swift, Java, Xamarin and React Native for Android-, iOS- and Windows-based devices. The Visual Studio 2017 release candidate released Wednesday includes new capabilities to help any developer be more productive than ever for any application and any platform. Visual Studio Team Foundation Server 2017 and Azure Application Insights are now available, providing an enhanced collaboration and DevOps platform for cloud- first, mobile-first scenarios. \n\"Microsoft is transforming the nature of its appeal to developers by broadening its supported platforms,\" said Al Hilwa , research director for Software Development research at IDC. \"The new partnerships and commitments allow Microsoft to meet developers where they are and multiply its reach and impact with mobile and cloud developers as well as become established in emerging areas such as IoT, data science and cognitive computing.\" \nMicrosoft (Nasdaq \"MSFT\" @microsoft) is the leading platform and productivity company for the mobile-first, cloud-first world, and its mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more.",

Sorry IDG News Service | Nov 16, 2016 7:30 AM PT RELATED TOPICS Comments \nThere's no love lost between Google and Microsoft. The two companies have been fiercely competitive with one another in the public cloud, productivity and operating system markets, at times leaving users in the lurch. \nThere's one small glimmer of hope in the relationship between the two companies: Google has joined the .NET Foundation, to help drive forward the programming language framework Microsoft originated. \nGoogle will be a part of the technical steering group for the foundation, which helps guide the future of the platform and consults on changes to the .NET roadmap and project release schedule. The foundation oversees projects including .NET Core and the Roslyn .NET compiler. NEWSLETTERS: Get the latest tech news sent directly to your in-box \nGoogle's fellow technical steering group members include Red Hat, Unity and Samsung, which announced Wednesday that developers will be able to use .NET Core to develop for its Tizen operating system. \nThe group is a set of somewhat strange bedfellows for Microsoft, but could help the company keep .NET and the C# programming language relevant in a broader set of circumstances. \nWednesday's news comes a few months after Microsoft made .NET Core generally available for use on Linux and macOS. Before the creation of the Foundation, the programming framework was more locked to Microsoft-controlled platforms like Windows. \nJulia Liuson, Microsoft's corporate vice president for Visual Studio, said at a press briefing that Google has a team dedicated to making sure that its public cloud platform is compatible with .NET. This partnership seems like a way for each of the companies to gain something from one another. \nThat's how IDC Program Director Al Hilwa saw it. He said in an email that the move could be emblematic of an improving relationship between Microsoft and Google. \n\"I think this is a mark of improving relationships between the two giants as the two have what each other craves,\" he said in an email. \"Microsoft is highly motivated to win startups and other emerging workloads, which Google technologies like Kubernetes have a lot of traction in, while Google is trying to build its enterprise business, something Microsoft has a lot of traction in.\" \nIt’s unclear, however, if the partnership will lead to an easing of relations between the two companies in other areas. Windows users, for example, have been clamoring for a YouTube app, something that Google has been unwilling to provide for a while. \nThis partnership is part of a suite of announcements Microsoft made at its Connect conference in New York City on Wednesday. The tech giant also announced that it would be joining the Linux Foundation as a platinum member, along with a host of product updates. RELATED TOPICS",

Credit: James Niccolai Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry IDG News Service | Nov 16, 2016 7:30 AM PT RELATED TOPICS Comments \nAfter a long campaign against open source and Linux, Microsoft has for the past few been pushing its love of the popular operating system. On Wednesday, the company made that even more official by joining the Linux Foundation, an organization that shepherds development of the operating system's kernel and provides funding for open source projects. \nMicrosoft also launched the public beta of SQL Server on Linux, the much-anticipated port of the relational database software that was first announced in March. Linux developers can also start working with a beta of Azure App Service, which is designed to take away the work of managing infrastructure for cloud-based apps. \nThe moves are part of an ongoing effort by the company to adopt and support Linux and open source in a variety of different ways. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella first proclaimed in 2014 that the company loves Linux, and we've seen the results of that ever since. INSIDER Review: Container Wars: Rocket v. Odin v. Docker \nMicrosoft will be a Platinum member in the Linux Foundation, placing it alongside the likes of Intel, Oracle, Samsung and IBM. The move makes sense for Microsoft, given its open source leanings of late. Jim Zemlin, the Foundation's executive director, said in a press release that he expects Microsoft will intensify \"its involvement and commitment to open development.\" \nBut things weren't always so cozy between the two organizations. In 2009, Zemlin blasted Microsoft for \"secretly attacking Linux\" after it sold a group of Linux-related patents. Microsoft, meanwhile, attacked Linux, with former CEO Steve Ballmer famously calling the operating system a \"cancer\" 15 years ago. \nBut at the same time, the door was open for the two organizations to work together, even during a period when Microsoft was much more aggressive towards Linux. \n\"We'd like to have a place where developers can come and work on making Linux more effectively interoperate with Microsoft products,\" Zemlin told InfoWorld's Paul Krill in a 2008 interview . \"And we'd like to do that in the open-source way that's not tied to any specific marketing agreement, that's not tied to any specific contract, that is an open process that can be participated in by anyone in the community.\" \nA warmer relationship between the two organizations began emerging last year when the two launched a certification for running Linux on Azure. In order to obtain the certificate, sysadmins had to pass a Microsoft exam about Azure, and a Linux Foundation exam about managing the open source operating system. \nMicrosoft also joined the Eclipse Foundation earlier this year . \nNow, Microsoft's move to join the Linux Foundation is an important step, according to IDC Program Director Al Hilwa. \n\"Microsoft is hitting all the right notes in terms of aligning its developer business with an ecosystem much broader than Windows,\" he said in an email. \"Joining the Linux Foundation is a natural progression of this strategy and one that might still generate a double take if it wasn’t for all the actions the company has already taken in terms of supporting Linux in Azure and with SQL Server.\" \nWith the release of the pubic beta for SQL Server on Linux, anyone will be able to take the relational database software for a spin on a Linux machine, though they shouldn't expect the full set of features available on Windows to make their way over to Linux just yet. \nMicrosoft has planned to make SQL Server on Linux available in the middle of next year, and Wednesday's launch is an important step along that path. \nMicrosoft General Manager Rohan Kumar said during a press event that the SQL Server team put a lot of work to making the relational database software feel like it’s at home on Linux, and not just a straight port of the database engine alone. \nAzure App Service is also getting the Linux treatment. Developers building Node.js and PHP applications that run on Linux now have a beta version of Microsoft's platform-as-a-service offering to try out. It's designed to help developers build web and mobile apps that easily scale and integrate with other services. \nAll of this is part of a suite of announcements Microsoft made at its Connect conference in New York City on Wednesday. On top of all the Linux news, Google will be joining the .NET Foundation, and Microsoft is releasing a handful of updates to various Visual Studio products. RELATED TOPICS",

      "text": "Microsoft and Google bury the hatchet in one small way Google has joined the .NET Foundation, to help shape Microsoft's programming framework More like this Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft, speaking at the Build conference in San Francisco on March 30, 2016. Credit: Microsoft/IDGNS Email a friend   IDG News Service |     \nThere's no love lost between Google and Microsoft. The two companies have been fiercely competitive with one another in the public cloud, productivity and operating system markets, at times leaving users in the lurch. \nThere's one small glimmer of hope in the relationship between the two companies: Google has joined the .NET Foundation, to help drive forward the programming language framework Microsoft originated. \nGoogle will be a part of the technical steering group for the foundation, which helps guide the future of the platform and consults on changes to the .NET roadmap and project release schedule. The foundation oversees projects including .NET Core and the Roslyn .NET compiler. \n[ Download the State of the CIO 2016 report ] \nGoogle's fellow technical steering group members include Red Hat, Unity and Samsung, which announced Wednesday that developers will be able to use .NET Core to develop for its Tizen operating system. \nThe group is a set of somewhat strange bedfellows for Microsoft, but could help the company keep .NET and the C# programming language relevant in a broader set of circumstances. \nWednesday's news comes a few months after Microsoft made .NET Core generally available for use on Linux and macOS. Before the creation of the Foundation, the programming framework was more locked to Microsoft-controlled platforms like Windows. \nJulia Liuson, Microsoft's corporate vice president for Visual Studio, said at a press briefing that Google has a team dedicated to making sure that its public cloud platform is compatible with .NET. This partnership seems like a way for each of the companies to gain something from one another. \nThat's how IDC Program Director Al Hilwa saw it. He said in an email that the move could be emblematic of an improving relationship between Microsoft and Google. \n\"I think this is a mark of improving relationships between the two giants as the two have what each other craves,\" he said in an email. \"Microsoft is highly motivated to win startups and other emerging workloads, which Google technologies like Kubernetes have a lot of traction in, while Google is trying to build its enterprise business, something Microsoft has a lot of traction in.\" \nIt’s unclear, however, if the partnership will lead to an easing of relations between the two companies in other areas. Windows users, for example, have been clamoring for a YouTube app, something that Google has been unwilling to provide for a while. \nThis partnership is part of a suite of announcements Microsoft made at its Connect conference in New York City on Wednesday. The tech giant also announced that it would be joining   as a platinum member, along with a host of product updates. RELATED TOPICS",

      "text": "Microsoft doubles down on Linux love, joins foundation SQL Server for Linux hits public beta, and Azure App Service now supports Linux More like this \nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella recently proclaimed the company's newfound love for Linux. Credit: James Niccolai   IDG News Service |     \nAfter a long campaign against open source and Linux, Microsoft has for the past few been pushing its love of the popular operating system. On Wednesday, the company made that even more official by joining  , an organization that shepherds development of the operating system's kernel and provides funding for open source projects. \nMicrosoft also launched the public beta of SQL Server on Linux, the much-anticipated port of the relational database software that was first announced in March. Linux developers can also start working with a beta of Azure App Service, which is designed to take away the work of managing infrastructure for cloud-based apps. \nThe moves are part of an ongoing effort by the company to adopt and support Linux and open source in a variety of different ways. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella first proclaimed in 2014 that the company loves Linux, and we've seen the results of that ever since. \n[ Download the State of the CIO 2016 report ] \nMicrosoft will be a Platinum member in  , placing it alongside the likes of Intel, Oracle, Samsung and IBM. The move makes sense for Microsoft, given its open source leanings of late. Jim Zemlin, the Foundation's executive director, said in a press release that he expects Microsoft will intensify \"its involvement and commitment to open development.\" \nBut things weren't always so cozy between the two organizations. In 2009, Zemlin blasted Microsoft for \"secretly attacking Linux\" after it sold a group of Linux-related patents. Microsoft, meanwhile, attacked Linux, with former CEO Steve Ballmer famously calling the operating system a \"cancer\" 15 years ago. \nBut at the same time, the door was open for the two organizations to work together, even during a period when Microsoft was much more aggressive towards Linux. \n\"We'd like to have a place where developers can come and work on making Linux more effectively interoperate with Microsoft products,\" Zemlin told InfoWorld's Paul Krill in a 2008 interview . \"And we'd like to do that in the open-source way that's not tied to any specific marketing agreement, that's not tied to any specific contract, that is an open process that can be participated in by anyone in the community.\" \nA warmer relationship between the two organizations began emerging last year when the two launched a certification for running Linux on Azure. In order to obtain the certificate, sysadmins had to pass a Microsoft exam about Azure, and a Linux Foundation exam about managing the open source operating system. \nMicrosoft also joined the Eclipse Foundation earlier this year . \nNow, Microsoft's move to join   is an important step, according to IDC Program Director Al Hilwa. \n\"Microsoft is hitting all the right notes in terms of aligning its developer business with an ecosystem much broader than Windows,\" he said in an email. \"Joining   is a natural progression of this strategy and one that might still generate a double take if it wasn’t for all the actions the company has already taken in terms of supporting Linux in Azure and with SQL Server.\" \nWith the release of the pubic beta for SQL Server on Linux, anyone will be able to take the relational database software for a spin on a Linux machine, though they shouldn't expect the full set of features available on Windows to make their way over to Linux just yet. \nMicrosoft has planned to make SQL Server on Linux available in the middle of next year, and Wednesday's launch is an important step along that path. \nMicrosoft General Manager Rohan Kumar said during a press event that the SQL Server team put a lot of work to making the relational database software feel like it’s at home on Linux, and not just a straight port of the database engine alone. \nAzure App Service is also getting the Linux treatment. Developers building Node.js and PHP applications that run on Linux now have a beta version of Microsoft's platform-as-a-service offering to try out. It's designed to help developers build web and mobile apps that easily scale and integrate with other services. \nAll of this is part of a suite of announcements Microsoft made at its Connect conference in New York City on Wednesday. On top of all the Linux news, Google will be joining the .NET Foundation, and Microsoft is releasing a handful of updates to various Visual Studio products. RELATED TOPICS",

      "text": "Linux has won, Microsoft joins   Microsoft also released public preview of SQL Server for Linux. More like this   CIO |   Like this article? thumbsup 0 thumbsdown   \nI knew it was going to happen, it was just a matter of time. Microsoft has officially joined   as a platinum member. You heard it right. Microsoft has joined   as a top tier member. Microsoft and   just made the announcement at the Connect(); // 2016 event in New York. \nI recall in an earlier interview with Jim Zemlin , the executive director of  , when I asked him about the possibility of Microsoft joining   and his response was, “Certainly, we are open to it.” \nWhy Microsoft loves Linux \nThere used to be a time when Microsoft hated Linux. Steve Ballmer called Linux a cancer. Back in those days Linux was a threat to Microsoft’s business, it still is in the operating space. But the larger market has changed, it has evolved from server-client model to cloud-mobile model. In 2014 Microsoft changed its strategy and started its cloud-first, mobile first journey. \nUnder Satya Nadella, Microsoft changed its approach towards Linux and became more friendly towards it. In 2014, Nadella made public the display of Microsoft’s love for Linux . It was a refreshing change, but there was a reason. Linux is a dominant force in the cloud-mobile world. There are only two operating systems in data centers: Linux and Windows. Period. Private cloud is all about Linux. When it comes to public cloud, Ubuntu Linux is the most popular operating system on AWS (Amazon Web Services). Just look at Microsoft’s own cloud platform, Azure, where nearly one in three Azure machines now run Linux. And Azure is critical to Microsoft's cloud strategy. \nAzure customers need the confidence that Microsoft is not hostile towards the very platform that they use. Microsoft has to show that they care about Linux. Microsoft has been working closely with all three major Linux players, including Red Hat, SUSE and Canonical to ensure that their products are fully supported on Azure. Microsoft also works with community distributions like Debian to support them on Azure. \nMicrosoft has hired some of the leading Linux kernel developers including Matthew Wilcox and Stephen Hemminger who work on the kernel. It’s not just about supporting what customers need; Microsoft itself is a consumer of Linux. Microsoft has developed a Linux based operating system called Azure Cloud Switch (ACS) . It is a cross-platform modular operating system for data center networking built on Linux. Linux is now a core component of Azure Cloud. You can’t be hostile towards the very project that powers your own infrastructure. Talk is cheap, show me the code \nMicrosoft is not new to open source. I have been tracking Microsoft’s open source efforts from the very early days. Ten years before Nadella made the ‘Microsoft Loves Linux’ announcement, in 2004 Microsoft released its first open source project called Wix toolset under an OSS approved Licence. \n[ Timeline: Microsoft’s major open source announcements so far ] \nSince then Microsoft has released many open source projects. Recently Microsoft started to open source some of their core components including PowerShell, .NET core and Visual Studio. These technologies are enjoying wider adoption. In an interview, Mitra Azizirad, Corporate Vice President, Cloud Application Development & Data Marketing at Microsoft told me that two thirds of contributions to .NET Core are coming from outside of Microsoft. It will be surprising to hear that arch rivals like Google are actually among the top contributors to .NET Core. \nGoogle is in fact joining the Technical Steering Group of the .NET Foundation which shows that the .NET developer community is like any other open source community where competitors collaborate to improve the code. \nMicrosoft is just getting started. Azizirad told me that Microsoft will continue to open soure more of their technologies. Joining   \nIn addition to open sourcing their own technologies, Microsoft is contributing heavily to many open source projects. You may not know but Microsoft is one of the leading open source contributors on GitHub. Becoming a Linux Foundation member is just another step in its open source journey. “Microsoft has made this announcement today, but they've spent the last eight or so years contributing to open source projects,” said Jim Zemlin, the executive director of The Linux Foundation. \n“Microsoft joining   would have been truly unimaginable a couple years ago, but in the context of the Nadella Microsoft it should be seen as natural and even expected,” said Al Hilwa, Program Director, Software Development Research of IDC. “The company has been driving hard to appeal to Linux workloads on Azure, is bringing its key assets like SQL Server to the Linux platform, is open sourcing most of its platform IP and has moved to strike deep partnerships with major players in the Linux ecosystem.” \nThe Linux foundation is not the only open source organization Microsoft works with. Microsoft has been a supporter of the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) for a very long time. You may not know but Ross Gardler, a Microsoft employee has been the director and president of ASF since 2013. Microsoft also supports the Eclipse Foundation among many other open source organizations. \n\"From what we see, Microsoft continues to recognize the importance of Linux and other open source technologies in the marketplace. We are happy to see them continue to embrace and become involved in projects and organizations like  ,” said Mike Ferris, vice president, Business Development Architecture, Red Hat. \nMicrosoft is already involved with many Linux Foundation projects, including Node.js Foundation, OpenDaylight, Open Container Initiative, R Consortium and Open API Initiative. \n“Microsoft has been a terrific collaborator with us on a variety of projects. Microsoft is working with us on security issues and with our Core Infrastructure Initiative (CII). We work with Microsoft on the AllSeen Alliance, which is an IoT initiative. We work with them on the node.js project. We work with them on Cloud Native Foundation, to name a few,” said Jim Zemlin. “It's been a refreshing and welcome change from the past to work with them. And we like it.” \nNow as a member of  , Microsoft will obviously work on core Linux. Zemlin wants to work with Microsoft to get the company involved in the foundation’s cloud computing projects such as the Cloud Native Computing Foundation, Kubernetes, Prometheus and the mobile efforts that the foundation is doing around things like Tizen, Zephyr and the Octave project. “We hope to see them supporting their strategy which is mobile and cloud through open source and they seem very, very committed to that,” said Zemlin. \nGoing beyond code, creating an even playing field for Linux \nMicrosoft’s collaboration with Linux goes beyond code contribution, the company is now creating a level playing field for Linux. Microsoft ported PowerShell to Linux and at the same time brought Ubuntu shell to Windows. The message is clear, it doesn’t matter what machine you run locally -- whether it’s Linux or Windows -- you will have same tools to do the job. In the enterprise world, Linux is no longer a second class citizen; it’s a first class citizen. Gone are the days when Microsoft would force you to use Windows to do everything. \nAs I said, it was just the beginning. Today at the Connect(); // 2016 event Microsoft also released the public preview of SQL Server for Linux, which means customers will be able to run SQL Server on Linux and Linux-based Docker containers. The company also announced a preview of Azure App Service support on Linux with native Linux support for Node.js and PHP stacks on Azure App Service to give web and mobile developers a simplified and fully managed experience. \nYou must have heard of Tizen, a Linux based operating system that’s aimed at a wide range of devices, including TVs, wearables, mobile, and many IoT devices. Today Samsung is releasing a preview of their Visual Studio Tools for Tizen so developers can use them to build .NET apps for the Tizen operating system. \nEmbrace, extend and... \nIt’s refreshing to see that Microsoft is embracing Linux. But...you can’t use the word ‘embrace’ in the context of Microsoft without bringing in ‘extend and extinguish’. There are still many people in the open source community who are skeptical of Microsoft’s intentions, given the company's long hostility towards Linux and open source. There are some valid concerns and I wrote about earlier . One of the most worrying concern is Microsoft’s continued use of patents as a tool to goad Linux players into signing deals with the company. Will it stop with Microsoft joining  ? \nI see a glimmer of hope. You may have noticed that we don’t hear such stories that much anymore. What’s even more interesting is that you won’t see the same aggression in Microsoft’s blogs and press releases when they do sign such deals. Are they changing? Will becoming a Linux Foundation member change anything? I do hope so. The more you work together the less hostile you are towards your partners. \nWhen I asked Zemlin about Microsoft’s use of patents against Linux players, as a member of  , he said, “We discourage the use of a shared collective resource like Linux as a platform for asserting IP.” That’s a strong statement. \nI am not alone in thinking that Microsoft may actually withdraw from their strategy of using patents as a weapon against Linux vendors. Hilwa said, “I don't think we are going to hear more about Linux-related patents.” All's well that ends well \nThere are many people who will remain skeptical and that’s fine. We should remain vigilant, at the same time we should also welcome Microsoft into the Linux world. I think a friendly Microsoft is much better than a hostile one. In the end all we want is open source to grow, all we want is Linux to succeed. That’s exactly what’s happening with Microsoft joining the Linux foundation. \nI recall my recent interview with Linus Torvalds where he said that getting rid of hostility between Microsoft and Linux will benefit everyone. \nAs someone who has been covering Microsoft’s open source efforts since 2005, I am extremely glad to see this development. The way I look at it is that in the end it’s Linux and open source that has won. \nThis article is published as part of the IDG Contributor Network. Want to Join? RELATED TOPICS",

      "text": "at 10:00 am \nMicrosoft is expanding their research into artificial intelligence by announcing a major partnership. \nThe company announced it will be partnering with Elon Musk, Peter Thiel and Open AI, Sam Altman’s nonprofit organization focused on research into responsible artificial intelligence. You know, rather than the SkyNet type that will create Terminators to obliterate us all. \nThe deal will allow Open AI to use Azure, Microsoft’s cloud-based OS, to deepen their understanding of neural networks, since the company will be running artificial intelligence experiments in the system. Considering the large scale nature of the experiments, it makes sense to use a system that supports open source technologies. \nGreg Brockman, Ilya Sutskever, and Sam Altman went into detail in a blog post to Open AI’s official website : Source: YouTube \nIn the coming months we will use thousands to tens of thousands of these machines to increase both the number of experiments we run and the size of the models we train. \nWe’ll share the results of this partnership with everyone: along with publishing our research results, we’ll continue releasing open-source software making it easier for people to run large-scale AI workloads on the cloud. We’ll also be giving feedback to the Microsoft team so that Azure’s capabilities keep pace with our understanding of AI. \nIt’s great to work with another organization that believes in the importance of democratizing access to AI. We’re looking forward to accelerating the AI community through this partnership. \nIt should be interesting to see what this means for the advancement of artificial intelligence. I certainly think it’s a noble mission, if nothing else, to limit the possibilities of a monopoly on artificial intelligence, especially since it could easily be made to harm humanity in the wrong hands. I know it sounds a bit like a plot from a bad Bond movie, but that’s just the age we live in now. And it’s better to further the democratization of AI now, rather than waiting until it’s too late. \nBut what do you think?  ",

      "text": "Microsoft Fortifies Commitment to Open Source, Becomes Linux Foundation Platinum Member \nShare This Article: SAN FRANCISCO – November 16, 2016 – The Linux Foundation, the nonprofit advancing professional open source management for mass collaboration, today announced that Microsoft has joined the organization at a Platinum member during Microsoft’s Connect(); developer event in New York. From cloud computing and networking to gaming, Microsoft has steadily increased its engagement in open source projects and communities. The company is currently a leading open source contributor on GitHub and earlier this year announced several milestones that indicate the scope of its commitment to open source development. The company released the open source .NET Core 1.0; partnered with Canonical to bring Ubuntu to Windows 10; worked with FreeBSD to release an image for Azure; and after acquiring Xamarin, Microsoft open sourced its software development kit. In addition, Microsoft works with companies like Red Hat, SUSE and others to support their solutions in its products. \"As a cloud platform company we aim to help developers achieve more using the platforms and languages they know,” said Scott Guthrie, Executive Vice President, Microsoft Cloud and Enterprise Group. “The Linux Foundation is home not only to Linux, but many of the community’s most innovative open source projects. We are excited to join The Linux Foundation and partner with the community to help developers capitalize on the shift to intelligent cloud and mobile experiences.” Microsoft already contributes to several Linux Foundation projects, including Node.js Foundation, OpenDaylight, Open Container Initiative, R Consortium and Open API Initiative. John Gossman, Architect on the Microsoft Azure team, will join The Linux Foundation Board of Directors. “Microsoft has grown and matured in its use of and contributions to open source technology,” said Jim Zemlin, Executive Director of The Linux Foundation. “The company has become an enthusiastic supporter of Linux and of open source and a very active member of many important projects. Membership is an important step for Microsoft, but also for the open source community at large, which stands to benefit from the company’s expanding range of contributions.” To view a full roster of Linux Foundation members, please visit http://www.linuxfoundation.org/about/members .

      "text": "\nToday, at Microsoft’s Connect conference, the company made several announcements that highlight where the company is moving towards for the year ahead. Announced at the event are Visual Studio 2017, SQL Server v.Next for Windows and Linux, Visual Studio for the Mac, and that Microsoft has joined the Linux Foundation as a platinum member.\nVisual Studio 2017 is the next installment of the company’s development suite of tools and has been known to many as Visual Studio 15. The company is releasing an RC version of the software today for testing and Microsoft says that the software is nearly complete; the RC version is representative of the final product minus a few bug fixes.\nMicrosoft is ready to talk more about the next version of SQL Server, which will run on Windows, Linux and macOS (via Docker). The next iteration of the platform will include enhanced support for R Services, improved machine learning capabilities, and deep neural networking features.The company is also opening up its Linux-based SQL Server preview which was previously available on an invite-only basis; starting today, anyone can download the SQL Server vNext technology preview, which you can find here .\nThe Linux version of SQL server, which many thought might be a watered-down iteration, is getting all the major features of the relational database engine. The Linux variant will come with the standard SQL management tools, such as encryption and row-level security as well as in-memory column stores. With native install packages now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Ubuntu Linux, and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server, ‘nix users should be able to find a package that works for their instance. If you are using Azure, these new bits will be available for Azure Virtual machines as images on Docker Hub in the near future.\nSamsung also made the keynote too, the company, which as its own Tizen operating system is releasing new tools so that developers can use Visual Studio to build applications for its platform. This is a big move for Samsung who has made it known that it wants to reduce its dependency on Android and the announcement today should help the company move forward with that initiative.\nFinally, Microsoft is also joining the Linux Foundations as a platinum member. Considering the company’s embrace of open source software and that they now are building enterprise software for Linux, this shouldn’t come as a major surprise.\n \nThe post Microsoft Connect: Visual Studio 2017, SQL Server v.Next for Windows and Linux and More appeared first on Petri .\n",

      "text": "\nAlong with Visual Studio for Mac, Microsoft today introduced a new Visual Studio product: the Mobile Center. Visual Studio Mobile Center aims to simplify mobile app testing for Android and iOS app developers. The service can connect with GitHub, allowing developers to be able to get started very easily with their app’s GitHub repository. Once setup, developers can easily build the app for Android and iOS from Mobile Center on the cloud. After that, they can also test the app right from Mobile Center which is very neat. Testing apps is a very simple process as developers can see how their app looks on a variety of devices, no matter what platform they are supporting.\n\nMore importantly, distribution of apps is also quite easy with Mobile Center as it allows developers to be able to release a new version of their app right from the service via GitHub. The service is also able to provide crash reports and other analytics about an app which makes it much easier to debug an app and find issues. Developers can also use the analytics data to see more details about their users — for example, they can find out which devices are being used the most, etc.\nThe service currently seems to support Android and iOS, but it will likely support Windows 10 apps in the near-future.\n",

      "title": "Microsoft's Linux love affair leads it to join The Linux Foundation",
      "text": "Microsoft's Linux love affair leads it to join The Linux Foundation You read the title correctly. Microsoft just joined the Linux Foundation. \nBelieve it or not, Microsoft has joined The Linux Foundation as a Platinum member. \nIt's not an Onion story. It's not an April Fool's joke. Microsoft has joined the Linux Foundation. \nNo, this isn't The Onion and it's not April Fool's Day. Microsoft has joined The Linux Foundation. \nMicrosoft announced that it was joining forces with The Linux Foundation at the Microsoft Connect developer event in New York. \nHeck, Ballmer even recently said he loved Microsoft's porting of SQL Server to Linux . \nSo did someone put some LSD in current Microsoft CEO's Satya Nadella tea? No. \nMicrosoft has changed. Today's Microsoft supports Debian GNU/Linux on Azure and has its own Linux certification . 2016's Microsoft offers the open-source Hadoop big data software on Ubuntu and its CEO proclaims that Microsoft loves Linux . Microsoft even has its own specialized Linux distribution: Azure Cloud Switch . \nWhy has Microsoft done all this? Because, in two words: \" Linux won\" . \nIt's only on the desktop that Microsoft is still omnipresent. Windows isn't even the most popular end-user operating system. That honor goes to Android. \nEverywhere else -- clouds, supercomputers, and servers -- it's a Linux world. Microsoft could have tried to fight it and hemorrhage red-ink or they could embrace it and profit. They choose to make money. \nDon't believe me? Look at Azure. In Microsoft's last quarter, Azure revenue was up 116 percent, with compute usage doubling. What do people run on Azure? More and more they run Linux. One in three server instances on Azure are Linux . I'm counting the days until there's more Linux than Windows Server running on Azure. I won't have that many to count. \nScott Guthrie, Microsoft's executive VP of Cloud and Enterprise Group, knows what I'm talking about. In a statement, he said: \"As a cloud platform company we aim to help developers achieve more using the platforms and languages they know. The Linux Foundation is home not only to Linux, but many of the community's most innovative open-source projects. We are excited to join The Linux Foundation and partner with the community to help developers capitalize on the shift to intelligent cloud and mobile experiences.\" \nThis isn't Microsoft's first move in working with the industry's leading Linux group. Microsoft already contributes to several Linux Foundation projects, including the Node.js Foundation, OpenDaylight, Open Container Initiative, R Consortium, and Open API Initiative. \nI asked Jim Zemlin, the Linux Foundation's executive director, if he were surprised that Microsoft had made the jump to joining the Foundation. He replied, \"Our philosophy is that open source should be a big tent where anyone can contribute\". \n\"There was a time where proprietary versus open source was a winner-take-all proposition, but that's in the past,\" he said. \"Open source is now a major force in software development, and the industry realizes you can make yourself better, while also making others better at the same time. Microsoft has been embracing open source increasingly for the better part of a decade, including contributing to and supporting many Linux Foundation projects, so their decision to take the next step and become a Linux Foundation member didn't come as a surprise to us.\" \nZemlin concluded, \"Microsoft has grown and matured in its use of and contributions to open-source technology. The company has become an enthusiastic supporter of Linux and of open source and a very active member of many important projects. Membership is an important step for Microsoft, but also for the open-source community at large, which stands to benefit from the company's expanding range of contributions.\" \nRelated Stories:",

      "text": "Image by : \nopensource.com \n  Microsoft joins the Linux Foundation \nWhile it may be a logical step from all of the love the Redmond-based computing giant has been showing for Linux in recent years, those who followed the operating system wars of decades before still probably never thought they would see this day: Microsoft is joining the Linux Foundation . But with Microsoft's participation in a number of Linux Foundation supported projects, and their increased support for Linux interoperability in many products, the relationship between Microsoft and the open source community has clearly changed for the better. New release of Firefox \nThe Mozilla Foundation has officially launched version 50.0 of the popular Firefox web browser, which includes a number of new features and changes. Included in this release are updated keyboard shortcuts, expanded WebGL support, download protection for executable files, rendering fixes, added built-in Emoji support, and more. There's also a more extensive list of changes aimed specifically at web developers, helpful for anyone who works professionally in web design. Supercomputers: 99.6% Linux \nWhile Linux is still in a battle for mindshare on the desktop, and has made huge advances in conquering the server and mobile markets, there's one area where the domination of the Linux operating system is almost complete: supercomputing. A look at the top 500 of the fastest computers in the world found Linux to be the operating system in use on 498 of them, a small increase over last year. 4.8 Linux kernel sees update \nNot even a week after the last update to the 4.8 kernel, the latest stable release, yesterday brought an eighth round of updates . It's a rather minor release, changing only a minimal number of files, but brings a few important updates to drivers for various devices as well as networking changes. Battles between big data projects \nWhile Hadoop was the darling of the big data community not all that long ago, it's clear that Apache Spark has seen a great deal of momentum in development and adoption over the past year. In an essay on InfoWorld, Matt Asay takes a look at the forces of change around the open source big data ecosystem and what they might mean for those trying to build a business around big data. Avoiding burnout in open source \nOver on The New Stack , Dawn Foster takes a look at some of the challenges faced by members of the open source community as they struggle to move as fast as possible while avoiding burnout. Citing examples from multiple talks at OSCON Europe, Foster gives information overload, rapid scaling, community behavior, and other factors as some of the stressors felt by open source developers. \n  news  ",

      "text": "ZDNet Japan Microsoft delivers test builds of Visual Studio for Mac, Visual Studio 2017 for Windows Microsoft is releasing a first Visual Studio for Mac preview, as well as a near-final Release Candidate of Visual Studio 2017 for Windows. | Topic: Developer \nNot too surprisingly, documents leaked earlier this week were correct and Microsoft is making available to developers for testing two new test versions of Visual Studio: Visual Studio for Mac and Visual Studio 2017 for Windows. \nVisual Studio for Mac is not a port of Visual Studio for Windows; it's a rebranded version of Xamarin Studio integrated development environment (IDE) that will work on the Mac. (Microsoft bought mobile-tool vendor Xamarin in February 2016.) Visual Studio for Mac is available as of today as a preview for download. \nVisual Studio 2017 is the official name of the product Microsoft has been calling \"Visual Studio Next\" and/or codename \"VS '15'.\" As of today, a near-final Release Candidate version of that product is available to testers. The RC includes a few brand-new features, but is mostly complete at this point. Officials told me this week that the final/general availability version of Visual Studio 2017 would be out in early 2017. \nMicrosoft made these announcements at its Connect() 2016 developer event in New York City on November 16. \nAt that event, Microsoft also announced it is joining the Linux Foundation as a Platinum member, and that Google is joining the .NET Foundation's Technical Steering Committee. The . NET Foundation -- formed by Microsoft and Xamarin in 2014 -- is the vehicle Microsoft has used to open source a number of its developer technologies, including NET and ASP.NET implementations and components. \nVisual Studio for Mac will include IntelliSense and refactoring via the Roslyn Compiler platform . It will use MSBuild and the same debugger engines for Xamarin and .NET Core apps, as well as the same designers for Xamarin.iOS and Xamarin.Android. \nVisual Studio 2017 for Windows also is relying on the \"Roslyn\" work to rearchitect the C# and Visual Basic compilers. The coming release includes enhancements in refactorings, code generation, code analysis, navigation, testing and debugging, officials said. \nOther Connect() announcements today included a preview of a new Visual Studio Mobile Center, and general availability of both Visual Studio Team Foundation server 2017 and Azure Application Insights. \nVisual Studio Mobile Center is a portal that is meant to help developers build, test, distribute and monitor apps built in Objective-C, Swift, Java, Xamarin and React Native for Android, iOS and Windows devices. Documentation for the new Mobile Center is here . \nSamsung also is releasing a preview of Visual Studio Tools for the Tizen operating system, which will allow developers to build apps for Tizen running on Samsung TVs, wearables, mobile and other IoT devices.

      "text": "ZDNet Japan Microsoft's SQL Server Next for Linux, Windows hit public preview Microsoft's next version of SQL Server is available in public preview form for both Linux and Windows. Microsoft also is introducing SQL Server 2016 SP1. | Topic: Data Management \nMicrosoft is releasing a public preview of the next version of its SQL Server database, which will work on Linux and Windows, both. \nMicrosoft released a private preview of SQL Server for Linux in March 2017 . At that time, Microsoft officials said SQL Server for Linux was a subset of SQL Server 2016 for Windows and would work on Ubuntu or as a Docker image. (Microsoft later added support for Red Hat Enterprise Linux to the private preview.) \nIn March, company officials also said that users who bought SQL Server would be able to use that license on either Windows Server or Linux , but didn't go so far as to say that the version of SQL Server for Linux would be the same one that would be considered SQL Server Next for Windows, too. Microsoft only recently -- as of June 1, 2016 -- made its most recent version of SQL Server for Windows, SQL Server 2016, generally available. \nHowever, as of today, Microsoft is positioning SQL Server Next as being both a Linux and a Windows thing. \nMicrosoft officials said SQL Server Next on Linux and SQL Server Next on Windows are based on a single code base. \"There are some features that have platform specific characteristics. For example, file path in Linux are different than file paths in Windows,\" said a spokesperson. But they are not two completely different products. \nAt its Connect() 2016 developer event in New York City on November 16, Microsoft officials reiterated that the coming SQL Server on Linux release would include \"all major features of the relational database engine.\" That includes in-memory online-transaction processing (OLTP), in-memory columnstores, Transparent Data Encryption, Always Encrypted and Row-Level Security, they said. \nThe public preview of SQL Server on Linux will be available on Ubuntu, Red Hat enterprise Linux and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server. The public preview will be available \"soon\" on Azure Virtual Machines and on Docker Hub, Microsoft officials said today. Microsoft officials are still saying that SQL Server will be generally available for both Linux and Windows by mid-2017. read this",

      "text": "Microsoft joins the Linux Foundation as a platinum member 3 minutes ago Microsoft offers 'concessions' to EU antitrust regulators over $26.2bn LinkedIn deal 2 hours ago By Andy Weir Senior News Editor Neowin LLC @gcaweir · 6 seconds ago with 0 comments \nAs we explained in a feature article earlier this week , Microsoft is a very different company today compared with how it used to be. Two decades ago, the idea of the firm enthusiastically embracing open source was unimaginable, but at its Connect() developer conference in New York City today, Chris Wanstrath, CEO of GitHub, highlighted the fact that Microsoft is now the top contributor on that open source community. \nIt once would have seemed similarly unlikely too that Microsoft would run towards Linux with open arms - but today, Microsoft's Scott Guthrie announced that the company is joining the Linux Foundation as a platinum member. \nOf course, in recent years, Microsoft has been strengthening its relationship with the Linux community, including bringing ChakraCore and Skype to Linux in the last few months. \nJim Zemlin, executive director of the Linux Foundation, said today that \"Microsoft and the Linux Foundation may have had our disagreements in the past, but one thing we've always agreed on is that developers are super-important.\" In joining the Foundation, he said that Microsoft will become \"better able to collaborate with the open source community to deliver transformative mobile and cloud experiences to more people\". \n\"To the skeptics out there,\" he added, \"what I want to say is a) we'd like to welcome Microsoft to the Linux Foundation, but b) as the largest employer of software developers in the world, and working on all these projects in open source, Microsoft's already there.\" \nAnd it looks like this relationship is built to last. Zemlin concluded: \"My final thought to you would be: if Microsoft loves Linux, on behalf of the over 800 members of the Linux Foundation... we love you too.\" Tags",

As a Platinum Member . \nMicrosoft is already a major contributor to a number of Linux projects, but joining the board of the organization is a pretty big step toward working with the open source community. \nThe company has also open sourced parts of its .NET platform, and Microsoft has announced that Google is joining the .NET Foundation’s Technical Steering Group and that Samsung is introducing a preview version of its Visual Studio Tools for Tizen, allowing .NET developers to create apps for Samsung’s Linux-based wearables, smart TVs, and other devices. \nMicrosoft is also launching a public preview of SQL Server on Linux today, along with a new Visual Studio for Mac preview. \nWelcome to the new Microsoft under Satya Nadella’s leadership.

      "title": "Slack-averse brands and agencies gravitate to Facebook, Microsoft alternatives",
      "text": "Slack has never quite caught on at brands and agencies , but now Slack alternatives from Facebook and Microsoft are making in-roads among marketers.\nFacebook’s Workplace and Microsoft’s Teams are gaining adaption at marketers in ways Slack largely has not. This is owing to the fact that Slack, being a singular product, lacks the suite of enterprise tools that Microsoft and Facebook others can provide alongside. So it’s easier for IT and procurement departments to shop from a single vendor whose products they already use and also more efficient for licensing purposes. And it’s cheaper too: Facebook Workplace has a three month free trial period after which it costs $3 a month for up to 1,000 active users, $2 a month for 1,001 to 10,000 active users and $1 a month for 10,000 plus active users, whereas Slack’s standard version costs $6.67 per active user per month and its plus version costs $12.50 per active user per month.\nTBWA Worldwide, Weber Shandwick, Starbucks and Heineken are among the more than 1,000 companies using Facebook Workplace, which only formally launched in October. Microsoft Teams is not expected to become widely available until early 2017, but is being tested by companies using Office 365 such as digital shop RPA.\nAdvertisement\nTBWA started piloting Workplace in February this year, when its French agency ici Barbès was working on a campaign with French railway company SNCF. Since then, the agency has experimented with its various features, putting out a daily culture briefing on the Workplace Newsfeed and setting up open groups like “Office 365 Q&A,” for instance. Next week, TBWA is set to roll out Workplace across its offices globally.\n“Slack is great when you have to manage a limited number of small teams, but Workplace is much more user-friendly if you are part of a large number of groups with a large number of people.” said Nicolas Bordas, vp at TBWA\\Europe. “Workplace is not just a communications tool, it is much more than that: It is Slack plus Yammer plus Whatsapp.”\nCompanies like Heineken and Weber Shandwick are betting on Workplace because of its familiarity. The service adapts the Facebook’s messenger, newsfeed, events and other features for use within companies. It has worked: 90 percent of Heineken’s employees are actively engaged on the platform, with over 80 percent engaging on it in the last month.\n“We’ve had great success using it to increase engagement across the organization between colleagues, as well as leadership touchpoints,” said Tara Rush, chief corporate relations officer at Heineken U.S.A. “We’ve also been able to use it in lieu of email in certain circumstances and whenever you can cut down on emails, people are happy.”\nWeber Shandwick, on the other hand, is riding on Workplace’s live video capability to transform how its executives and employees communicate internally, said Kate Bullinger, global lead of employee engagement and change management. The day after the U.S. presidential election, for example, its chairman took to Workplace and led a discussion about the election’s impact on the firm and its work on live video.\n“It was important to us to have that discussion live and as ‘in person’ as possible so that employees could weigh in with comments and questions,” she said. “We know going live has an impact on engagement on Workplace itself – we’ve seen a continuous and sustained increase in engagement following live videos with our leaders.”\nSlack may be dwarfed when you look at the sheer numbers : Facebook has over 1.7 billion monthly users while more than 85 million users already use Microsoft’s Office 365 productivity suite, which Teams will be bundled with. It is designed to work seamlessly with Microsoft productivity apps, so users can embed Skype video conversations in their messages, for example.\nBut Slack still has some advantages, pointed out Bordas. It has an open API, and developers can easily beef up messages with information from partners — such as tweets from Twitter. Slack also enables users to invite external people, who may not be a part of the company to a group, which neither Workplace nor Teams allows right now.\nAnd it still has its proponents. At Weber Shandwick, Workplace is a supplement to other collaboration tools, including Slack, which is often preferred for project work and real-time collaboration. Deutsch is squarely in favor of Slack, and isn’t even considering the alternatives. And although RPA is toying with Microsoft Teams, it will probably remain a “Slack pirate ship,” said Pramit Nairi, user experience director at the agency.\n“Slack has some character and flair to it, it allows agency culture to shine through a lot better than Teams,” said Nairi. “Slack is more for your hipster, colorful startup while Teams is for your Fortune 500, politically correct CEO.”",

Credit: Microsoft/IDGNS Email a friend   IDG News Service | November 16, 2016 RELATED TOPICS Google \nThere's no love lost between Google and Microsoft. The two companies have been fiercely competitive with one another in the public cloud, productivity and operating system markets, at times leaving users in the lurch. \nThere's one small glimmer of hope in the relationship between the two companies: Google has joined the .NET Foundation, to help drive forward the programming language framework Microsoft originated. \nGoogle will be a part of the technical steering group for the foundation, which helps guide the future of the platform and consults on changes to the .NET roadmap and project release schedule. The foundation oversees projects including .NET Core and the Roslyn .NET compiler. [ Best Bluetooth speakers: We'll help you find the best wireless speakers for pairing with your smartphone or tablet—whatever your budget, and whatever music floats your boat. ] \nGoogle's fellow technical steering group members include Red Hat, Unity and Samsung, which announced Wednesday that developers will be able to use .NET Core to develop for its Tizen operating system. \nThe group is a set of somewhat strange bedfellows for Microsoft, but could help the company keep .NET and the C# programming language relevant in a broader set of circumstances. \nWednesday's news comes a few months after Microsoft made .NET Core generally available for use on Linux and macOS. Before the creation of the Foundation, the programming framework was more locked to Microsoft-controlled platforms like Windows. \nJulia Liuson, Microsoft's corporate vice president for Visual Studio, said at a press briefing that Google has a team dedicated to making sure that its public cloud platform is compatible with .NET. This partnership seems like a way for each of the companies to gain something from one another. \nThat's how IDC Program Director Al Hilwa saw it. He said in an email that the move could be emblematic of an improving relationship between Microsoft and Google. \n\"I think this is a mark of improving relationships between the two giants as the two have what each other craves,\" he said in an email. \"Microsoft is highly motivated to win startups and other emerging workloads, which Google technologies like Kubernetes have a lot of traction in, while Google is trying to build its enterprise business, something Microsoft has a lot of traction in.\" \nIt’s unclear, however, if the partnership will lead to an easing of relations between the two companies in other areas. Windows users, for example, have been clamoring for a YouTube app, something that Google has been unwilling to provide for a while. \nThis partnership is part of a suite of announcements Microsoft made at its Connect conference in New York City on Wednesday. The tech giant also announced that it would be joining the Linux Foundation as a platinum member, along with a host of product updates. RELATED TOPICS",

Credit: James Niccolai   IDG News Service | November 16, 2016 RELATED TOPICS Linux \nAfter a long campaign against open source and Linux, Microsoft has for the past few been pushing its love of the popular operating system. On Wednesday, the company made that even more official by joining the Linux Foundation, an organization that shepherds development of the operating system's kernel and provides funding for open source projects. \nMicrosoft also launched the public beta of SQL Server on Linux, the much-anticipated port of the relational database software that was first announced in March. Linux developers can also start working with a beta of Azure App Service, which is designed to take away the work of managing infrastructure for cloud-based apps. \nThe moves are part of an ongoing effort by the company to adopt and support Linux and open source in a variety of different ways. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella first proclaimed in 2014 that the company loves Linux, and we've seen the results of that ever since. [ Best Bluetooth speakers: We'll help you find the best wireless speakers for pairing with your smartphone or tablet—whatever your budget, and whatever music floats your boat. ] \nMicrosoft will be a Platinum member in the Linux Foundation, placing it alongside the likes of Intel, Oracle, Samsung and IBM. The move makes sense for Microsoft, given its open source leanings of late. Jim Zemlin, the Foundation's executive director, said in a press release that he expects Microsoft will intensify \"its involvement and commitment to open development.\" \nBut things weren't always so cozy between the two organizations. In 2009, Zemlin blasted Microsoft for \"secretly attacking Linux\" after it sold a group of Linux-related patents. Microsoft, meanwhile, attacked Linux, with former CEO Steve Ballmer famously calling the operating system a \"cancer\" 15 years ago. \nBut at the same time, the door was open for the two organizations to work together, even during a period when Microsoft was much more aggressive towards Linux. \n\"We'd like to have a place where developers can come and work on making Linux more effectively interoperate with Microsoft products,\" Zemlin told InfoWorld's Paul Krill in a 2008 interview . \"And we'd like to do that in the open-source way that's not tied to any specific marketing agreement, that's not tied to any specific contract, that is an open process that can be participated in by anyone in the community.\" \nA warmer relationship between the two organizations began emerging last year when the two launched a certification for running Linux on Azure. In order to obtain the certificate, sysadmins had to pass a Microsoft exam about Azure, and a Linux Foundation exam about managing the open source operating system. \nMicrosoft also joined the Eclipse Foundation earlier this year . \nNow, Microsoft's move to join the Linux Foundation is an important step, according to IDC Program Director Al Hilwa. \n\"Microsoft is hitting all the right notes in terms of aligning its developer business with an ecosystem much broader than Windows,\" he said in an email. \"Joining the Linux Foundation is a natural progression of this strategy and one that might still generate a double take if it wasn’t for all the actions the company has already taken in terms of supporting Linux in Azure and with SQL Server.\" \nWith the release of the pubic beta for SQL Server on Linux, anyone will be able to take the relational database software for a spin on a Linux machine, though they shouldn't expect the full set of features available on Windows to make their way over to Linux just yet. \nMicrosoft has planned to make SQL Server on Linux available in the middle of next year, and Wednesday's launch is an important step along that path. \nMicrosoft General Manager Rohan Kumar said during a press event that the SQL Server team put a lot of work to making the relational database software feel like it’s at home on Linux, and not just a straight port of the database engine alone. \nAzure App Service is also getting the Linux treatment. Developers building Node.js and PHP applications that run on Linux now have a beta version of Microsoft's platform-as-a-service offering to try out. It's designed to help developers build web and mobile apps that easily scale and integrate with other services. \nAll of this is part of a suite of announcements Microsoft made at its Connect conference in New York City on Wednesday. On top of all the Linux news, Google will be joining the .NET Foundation, and Microsoft is releasing a handful of updates to various Visual Studio products. RELATED TOPICS",

The new web-based tutorial — available for free at http://code.org/minecraft — enables beginner coders to create and share their own simple \"Minecraft\" game, and is designed to empower anyone to begin learning the problem-solving and critical thinking skills required in today’s tech-fueled world. \nCreated by \"Minecraft\" game designers at Mojang and Microsoft, in partnership with Code.org, the fun and easy-to-learn one-hour experience builds on the success of last year’s record-breaking \"Minecraft\" tutorial, which reached more than 30 million students worldwide. With the goal of inspiring millions more to try coding for the first time — and to keep going on their journey of learning computer science — as of today’s launch, the tutorial is available in 10 languages, including Spanish. It is scheduled to be available in 50 languages by Dec. 5.",

      "title": "Microsoft formally announces Visual Studio 2017, offers a release candidate",
      "text": "By Rich Woods Neowin LLC @@TheRichWoods · 4 seconds ago with 0 comments \nMicrosoft held the keynote for its Connect() developer conference today, where it announced the next version of its integrated development environment (IDE), Visual Studio 2017. The company is also offering a release candidate, which you can grab from VisualStudio.com . \nThe IDE has been in preview under the name Visual Studio \"15\" since earlier this year, and it offers a new installer. In fact, for the first time in years, the smallest installation comes in at under 750MB. Of course, packing it out with all of the features that it offers will make it much larger; it can be over 60GB. \nThe company's latest IDE has a heavy focus on mobile cross-platform development, coming with an iOS Simulator, a feature that used to be exclusive to developing on a Mac. \nVS 2017 also includes improvements to IntelliSense, which is among the most popular and helpful features of Visual Studio. New enhancements include smart preselection, filtering and XAML support. \nSmart preselection will determine the “target type” required at a position in code and will preselect items in the IntelliSense completion list matching that type. This speeds your typing flow and removes the burden of having to figure out the expected type at a given location. IntelliSense filtering allows you to filter the completion list by category; for example, you can filter out extension methods or view only events. This feature boosts productivity when you’re working in a large code base where there are many items in the completion list or when dealing with unfamiliar code. \nFinally, this release delivers a whole new experience for XAML IntelliSense to help developers bind quickly and correctly and see only relevant information. This smarter completion experience includes completion when binding events, paths and functions with x:Bind; camelCase matching support (for example, “RTB” will complete as “RichTextBox”); and namespace prefix autocompletion. \nThere are also new Code Analysis features. Code Analysis originally launched with Visual Studio 2015, as a way of identifying issues with your code as you're typing it, rather than at run-time. The new version of Visual Studio \"takes live analysis and code fixes a step further by amplifying the set of refactorings and code fixes available, and by introducing code style analyzers that identify style issues in code as soon as they’re typed.\" \nNew refactoring options include: \nMove Type To Matching File \nSync file and type name \nConvert property to method \nConvert null-check + throw to use ?? + throw \nConvert string.Format to interpolated string \nMake method synchronous \nAdd missing case \nAdd braces \nThere's also a new debugging feature called \"Run To Click\". This feature will allow developers to run a program until it reaches the line of code that breaks it. This removes the necessity of creating break points. \nBut of course, this is a full new version of Visual Studio, and it would be impossible for us to outline its countless new features. Feel free to check out Microsoft's blog post about it, or download it from VisualStudio.com and try out the release candidate for yourself. Tags",

      "text": "  @11:00AM from the boom dept. Microsoft today said it is joining the Linux Foundation as a high-paying Platinum member. Linux Foundation executive director Jim Zemlin said, \"This may come as a surprise to you, but they were not big fans,\" describing the two's previous relationship. From a report on TechCrunch: The new Microsoft under CEO Satya Nadella, however, is singing a very different tune. Today's Microsoft is one of the biggest open source contributors around. Over the course of just the last few years, it has essentially built Canonical's Ubuntu distribution into Windows 10, brought SQL Server to Linux, open-sourced core parts of its .NET platform and partnered with Red Hat, SUSE and others. As Zemlin noted, Microsoft has also contributed to a number of Linux Foundation-managed projects like Node.js, OpenDaylight, the Open Container Initiative, the R Consortium and the Open API Initiative. ArsTechnica has more details .",

      "text": "SparkPost’s cloud-based email delivery service is now available in the Microsoft Azure marketplace, thanks to an integration announced on Tuesday.\nThe integration offers Microsoft Azure developers a collection of email tools that can be incorporated into their web and mobile applications, including deliverability support, notification capabilities and real-time email marketing analytics.\nMicrosoft Azure is Microsoft’s cloud computing platform, and SparkPost’s integration is primarily targeting a developer audience. \n“Microsoft has built a great product that's very competitive,” says Josh Aberant, CMO of SparkPost. “It's great technology and very reliable. Developers get what they need at a competitive price.”\n“Developers are finding a home there,” says Joal Barbehenn, senior vice president of business development at SparkPost. “It’s very clearly one of the fastest growing platforms.”\nAlthough Amazon Web Services (AWS) has a clear lead in the cloud services market, Azure is a rapidly growing second according to a recent study by the Synergy Research Group. Amazon had a larger market share according to the report, but was only experiencing a 53% year-over-year growth compared to Microsoft’s 100% year-over-year growth.\nNow available in the Microsoft Azure Marketplace, the SparkPost add-on is free for brands sending up to 100,000 emails per month. Paid plans tier from there, up to 5 million email sends per month.\nAdditional product features include detailed analytics that can be customized. Barbehenn describes how the user interface is “flexible” and can be “configured to your liking with graphs and data in real-time.” \nBarbehenn says the set-up is only a matter of minutes, so developers and marketers still have time to take advantage of the integration in time for the upcoming holiday season. \nSparkPost is an email infrastructure provider that works with major technology companies such as Pinterest, Twitter, Marketo and Groupon. The company has also worked with LinkedIn, a company soon-to-be acquired by Microsoft.",

      "text": "\n\nMAPI Over HTTP Is the default Outlook Desktop Connection Protocol for Office 365 Microsoft released MAPI over HTTP (the “Alchemy” project) as part of Exchange 2013 SP1 in May 2014 . Well before that time, MAPI over HTTP had been running inside Office 365 to shake down the new protocol before it was released to on-premises customers. The replacement for the long-established RPC over HTTP (aka “Outlook Anywhere”) protocol, MAPI over HTTP is designed to accommodate the demands of modern networking environments where devices hop from network to network and seamless mobility is everything.\nThe natural conclusion for the process has now come to pass. Microsoft is giving Office 365 tenants almost a year’s warning that RPC over HTTP connections will not be supported for Exchange Online after October 31, 2017 . Outlook Anywhere is heading for the rubbish heap, but only for Office 365 as on-premises Exchange will continue to support this venerable protocol.\nChanging Networks, Changing Protocols When you consider what’s happening, the process seems fair. Outlook Anywhere was designed to transport the Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs) used by Outlook desktop clients across an internet connection. Only HTTPS needed to be enabled for firewalls and no VPNs were necessary.\nWhen it was released, Outlook Anywhere was an immediate hit, especially when used with the then-new Outlook 2003 client and its “drizzle mode synchronization.” The protocol, client, and growing availability of Wi-Fi networks made mobility a reality for many and released users from the need for tiresome dial-up connections and extended synchronization sessions.\nThat was some thirteen years ago. When you consider what’s happened since, especially in the areas of mobile devices and networks, a case can be advanced to change the default protocol used by Outlook to something more modern and discard a protocol designed for LAN connections.\nMicrosoft’s HTTP Based Clients Microsoft has a lot of experience with clients that are based on HTTP. Both Exchange ActiveSync (EAS) and Outlook Web App (OWA) clients use longstanding HTTP connections to communicate with Exchange. These connections don’t require the complicated handshaking used when RPC connections are made, which means that they work much better than Outlook over low-quality links.\nAccording to Microsoft, MAPI over HTTP:\nProvides faster connection times to Exchange (especially after a network connection is interrupted, such as when a client switches network). RPC connections require more work to switch networks, most of which is hidden from users because the way that Outlook works in cached Exchange mode. Hibernation is another situation in which faster connections are enabled, again this is a capability that is more important in today’s environment. Improves the connection resiliency. In other words, the protocol doesn’t experience as many problems over flaky networks when packets might be dropped. Enables more secure connections by supporting Multi-Factor Authentication for Outlook 2013 and Outlook 2016. Removes the dependency on the very old RPC technology and focuses on HTTP as the communications protocol for the future. MAPI over HTTP is easier for support personnel to debug when working on connectivity problems. All sounds good. And MAPI over HTTP works and works well. I’ve been using it exclusively for the last two years and haven’t experienced any problems. That being said, Outlook desktop still remains the fat pig of Exchange clients and the new protocol does little to restrain the demands the client makes on network resources. If you’re in a network-constrained environment, such as using Wi-Fi on an airplane, OWA usually delivers a better user experience.\nClient Updates Might Be Required It’s easier for Microsoft to enforce change inside Office 365 than it is in the on-premises world. It controls all the necessary server upgrades (all of which are done) and can force tenants to upgrade clients to remain supported. Some work might be necessary to upgrade Outlook desktop software to one of the supported versions:\nOutlook 2016 Outlook 2013 SP1 Outlook 2010 SP2 In all cases, clients should be updated with the latest patches. In particular, the December 2015 updates contain several important fixes to improve the stability and performance of MAPI over HTTP. These updates should be considered the baseline version for deployment. Outlook 2007 was never updated with MAPI over HTTP capability, so you won’t be able to use this client to connect to Exchange Online after the deadline. Microsoft has a useful Outlook Updates article that outlines the minimum version requirements for Office 365 and on-premises connectivity.\nIt is possible that some Outlook 2016 or Outlook 2013 clients might be blocking MAPI over HTTP connections. This is done by setting the MapiHttpDisabled registry key to 1 (one). Clients might have been configured for on-premises users to force the use of RPC over HTTP connections before their mailboxes were moved to Exchange Online and forgotten about since. The fix is easy (set the value to zero or delete it from the registry), but it’s wise to check before users start to report that they can’t connect on October 31, 2017.\nDiscovering Clients No out-of-the-box method exists inside Office 365 to discover whether any Outlook clients need to be patched or updated. The Get-ConnectionByClientTypeDetailReport cmdlet tells you what users have used MAPI clients to connect to Exchange Online, but those MAPI clients can connect using either MAPI over HTTP or RPC over HTTP. Figuring out version numbers for clients that connect to Exchange is straightforward in an on-premises environment , but is more complex for Office 365 as Microsoft controls the required information. Curiously, although the Get-LogonStatistics cmdlet is available for Exchange Online, any attempt to pass it a mailbox identity fails.\nPerhaps the new “Email clients used report” promised in the “ What’s new in Office 365 Admin October 2016 ” post will provide all the necessary information. We shall see.\nExtended Lifetimes With respects to on-premises Exchange , you obviously have more control over when you upgrade both server and desktop software, so you can persist in using RPC over HTTP for as long as it’s supported. In some cases, software that can’t use MAPI over HTTP is supported for some time to come. Outlook 2007 leaves extended support on October 10, 2017 (one of the reasons why Microsoft never backported MAPI over HTTP to this client). Outlook 2010 lingers until October 13, 2020 and Outlook 2013 until April 11, 2023. This site provides a useful overview of support dates .\nIn some respects, this transition is simply an example of Microsoft changing the internal plumbing for the cloud. You shouldn’t have any concerns if modern clients are deployed. Some pain might be in prospect if ancient clients persist. Such is what happens with old (but still useful) software.\nFollow Tony on Twitter @12Knocksinna .\nWant to know more about how to manage Office 365?

      "text": "You Have to See How the Microsoft Who-Bot Will Help Your Team Find out anything about anyone? That is how this Microsoft Teams bot helps your team. Advertisement \nIt's easy to think of robots as servants who do our bidding. \nWe talk to Siri on an iPhone and ask the bot to set a reminder about picking up milk at the grocery store. We talk to the Google Pixel smartphone and ask the bot to enable the flashlight. These bots are under our command, and using them is helpful and fun. Yet, Microsoft might have a slightly different view of how this works. The company recently announced a new direction to use more AI , but it's incredibly practical. Instead of telling a bot to mow your lawn, you might ask one to make a slideshow. \nHere's a good example. A new competitor to Slack called Microsoft Teams --introduced this month but launching next year--includes bots that are designed to help you find information and learn the app. A recent product demo in New York revealed some interesting details. One of the bots is called T-Bot , and it lets you type any question about how to use Teams and find the answer. Another, called Polly, is for polling . \nThe Who-Bot is my favorite, though. As you may already know, collaborative software is the new email . Apps like Slack allow you to discuss projects, exchange files, and even do a meet and greet with a new employee. It is a \"one to many\" concept, but in apps like Slack and Convo, there are times when you might feel a little lost in the turmoil. \nWho-Bot is one answer to this problem. \nLet's say you are working on a new product launch with the marketing team. Everyone is setup on Microsoft Teams and can share the PowerPoint slideshow. Suddenly, you reach a road block. One part of the presentation talks about European markets. In Slack and Convo, I've had this happen before. There are incredible advantages to a team chat because everyone can see what you're talking about, but things can stall out quickly. When that happens, everyone stalls. It's like a traffic jam where there are no police officers and no traffic cams. We're all stuck in the mud together. \nDuring the demo, a Microsoft rep showed how Who-Bot would help in this situation. You could start a new chat with the Who-Bot and can ask a question like: \"Who knows the most about European markets?\" This actually works. The bot uses the Microsoft Graph, which has a name that reminds me of The Matrix. It can analyze things like the documents a person creates and the meetings they have attended. \nIn the Who-Bot, you can ask about one person and their colleagues (and what they know or what they've worked on), so it's like finding information about company shared knowledge. You can find out what topics are important to someone on the team or that someone lived in Austria for a while. You can even ask about your own boss and his areas of expertise and knowledge or which topics are important to her role. \nI see this as ground-breaking for a few reasons. In many companies, it's hard to know what you don't know. I might be chatting on Convo with someone and can check their LinkedIn profile, but how much do I really know about their work history or topics of focus? How do I find their docs? When those roadblocks happen on a project, you might not know who has experience creating web apps or who has traveled to Europe recently. The Who-Bot could be the ultimate people connector. \nNow, I should say that Microsoft was not ready to show me a live demo of how this all works quite yet, and the New York presentation seemed a bit canned. No one actually did a live search. But I can see some amazing implications for pushing through roadblocks in a team chat and finding out more about who is doing what, which teams are collaborating, and who has the answer to a momentum-crushing problem. \nAs a side note, it is important mention that Microsoft Teams will be available for Office 365 users and, when it debuts next year, it won't support \"guest\" access from people who do not use Office (e.g., someone on Gmail). That makes it a bit more of an enterprise tool, although small companies definitely still use Office. \nStill, I like where this is going. AI without the parlor tricks.

      "text": "0 0 \nMicrosoft’s Quiet Hours feature for Windows 10 is a great tool to have, especially if you’re the kind of person that gets a lot of notifications but has moments when you need absolute quiet. An example of this might be if you’re teaching or attending a class or even presenting at an event or meeting \nHowever, it has been noted that Quiet Hours also silences third party alarms, which could sometimes hinder a user’s ability to staying ahead of the schedule or even put users in a situation where they have to decide between the two functions. \nThat will no longer be the case, however, as Microsoft has taken action and announced that the newest build of their Insider program, which lets people test out features ahead of release (in this case, specifically version 14972 ), will fix the issue and allow people to set their third party alarms knowing they won’t get jammed by the Quiet Hours feature. \nThe new build Insiders will get to test is part of the Creators Update that will be coming to Windows 10 next year in March. While Microsoft is doing their part to maintain a stable ecosystem, third party alarm app developers must now also contribute by updating their apps so they incorporate the latest changes. \nIf you are not in the Insider program, you must wait for the official release of the update which means there is still a bit of time left before you can set your alarms and expect them to ring during Quiet Hours. \n ",

      "text": "  \nMicrosoft Translator , the company’s speech translation technology, used by the cross-platform Microsoft Translator app and Skype Translator, is now powered by neural network technology, the company announced in a blog post . This new technology is available to all developers through the Microsoft Translator speech API, which currently supports ten languages including Arabic, Chinese Mandarin, English, French, German, Italian, Brazilian Portuguese, Russian, Spanish and Japanese (the company says that more languages will be supported over time). \nWhile Microsoft is only getting started with the use of neural networks for speech and text translation, the technology giant believes that this new technology can deliver much better results than preexisting tools: \nNeural networks are making in-roads into the machine translation industry, providing major advances in translation quality over the existing industry-standard Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) technology. Because of how the technology functions, neural networks better capture the context of full sentences before translating them, providing much higher quality and more human-sounding output. \nFor now, the ten languages mentioned by Microsoft are supported in the Microsoft Translator app for iOS and Android as well as through Skype Translator on Skype for Windows desktop and the Skype Preview UWP app on Windows 10 devices. Microsoft has also set a dedicated website to let you see how this new neural network technology compares to the previous SMT technology. Neural networks do seem to provide more accurate translations. \nLastly, the neural network based Microsoft Translator API is now accessible by Azure customers on the Azure portal . For developers looking to move their Microsoft Translator subscription to Azure, you can learn how to do so on this support page . In this story stream:",

      "text": "\nWhen Microsoft introduced the untethered holographic computer that is the HoloLens nearly two years ago, everybody wanted one.\nOf course, at the time no one could get one. The hardware was unfinished, and the tools in Windows Holographic, a new component of Windows 10, which would allow developers to build holographic apps had yet to be to be released.\nBut even then I knew that HoloLens and Windows Holographic would have a profound impact on Microsoft and the future of personal computing. Developer's adoption of the platform and manufacturer partnerships for HoloLens-like wearable computers are core to Microsoft's vision. Microsoft fellow Alex Kipman explains :\n…Windows has always been built with an ecosystem of partners. Throughout our history, we have brought new attributes to Windows that empower not only developers but also our device makers to unleash their creativity to the world. Windows Holographic was created from the ground up with that same heritage in mind.\n\nAs partners have emulated the Surface with affordable 2-in-1s, Microsoft's goal is to foster an explosion of untethered wearable holographic computers for everyone!

      "text": "Open AI And Microsoft Exciting Times For AI Written by Sue Gee Wednesday, 16 November 2016 \nA new partnership between Elon Musk's OpenAI and Microsoft, whereby OpenAI will use Azure for its research into deep learning and neural networks sounds promising in terms of \"democratizing AI\", something both partners are committed to. \nOpenAI is the non-profit designed to promote artificial intelligence as both beneficial for all and open to all. It was founded by Elon Musk, Sam Altman, Greg Brockman and Ilya Sutskever in December 2015 with a $1 billion investment, see AI Goes Open Source To The Tune Of $1 Billion , and quickly began to implement research projects, see OpenAI Gym Gives Reinforcement Learning A Work Out . \nThe decision by OpenAI to use Microsoft Azure to further its research comes shortly after the formation of Partnership on AI , another non-profit with the ultimate aim of ensuring AI is beneficial rather than harmful to society as a whole, which is AI alliance between Amazon, DeepMind/Google, Facebook, IBM, and Microsoft. \nWhereas Partnership on AI has been established to study and formulate best practices on AI technologies, OpenAI is pressing ahead with AI research. \nA blog post by Greg Brockman, Ilya Sutskever and Sam Altman yesterday explains the decision to partner with Microsoft from OpenAI's perspective: We're working with Microsoft to start running most of our large-scale experiments on Azure. This will make Azure the primary cloud platform that OpenAI is using for deep learning and AI, and will let us conduct more research and share the results with the world. One of the most important factors for accelerating our progress is accessing more and faster computers; this is particularly true for emerging AI technologies like reinforcement learning and generative models. Azure has impressed us by building hardware configurations optimized for deep learning — they offer K80 GPUs with InfiniBand interconnects at scale. We're also excited by their roadmap, which should soon bring Pascal GPUs onto their cloud. In the coming months we will use thousands to tens of thousands of these machines to increase both the number of experiments we run and the size of the models we train. We'll share the results of this partnership with everyone: along with publishing our research results, we'll continue releasing open-source software making it easier for people to run large-scale AI workloads on the cloud. We'll also be giving feedback to the Microsoft team so that Azure's capabilities keep pace with our understanding of AI. It's great to work with another organization that believes in the importance of democratizing access to AI. We're looking forward to accelerating the AI community through this partnership. A post on the Official Microsoft Blog from Harry Shum reiterates Microsoft's commitment to democratizing AI , making it accessible to everyone and enabling everyone to take advantage of the breakthroughs in AI. In this brief video clip Harry Shum and Sam Altman share their excitement about these breakthroughs to date and how AI technology can be harnessed in the future: \n\nAt the beginning of the conversation Shum asks why is AI so 2hot\" today and Altman says he thinks the reason is that after 50 years of it making promises it is finally working, something Shum suggests is due to a convergence of multiple forces: having a lot more data, having amazing computing power, especially that from the cloud, referring specifically to Azure and thirdly incredible breakthroughs in deep learning. To this Altman responds with: \nI think the AI revolution will be on the order of the Industrial R evolution or the Agricultural Revolution in terms of how much it changes the way our society works and the way we live. I think we are not all that far away from the super tool that will help us do everything we do better. I think we'll be able to save a lot of lives. I think we'll be able to educate our children better. I think this will transform a lot of industries and a lot of society. \nShum's blog post also explains which OpenAI has chosen to use Azure and also indicates that next month even more cloud computing power will be generally available. \nWe’re also excited that OpenAI chose Microsoft Azure as their primary cloud platform, to help advance their research and create new tools and technologies that are only possible with the cloud. OpenAI chose Microsoft due to our deep learning research and ongoing commitment to AI, along with Azure’s support for open source technologies and its unique combination of high performance computing, big data and intelligence capabilities such as Azure Batch, Azure Machine Learning and the Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (formerly CNTK). \nOpenAI is an early adopter of Azure N-Series Virtual Machines , which will be generally available starting in December. These virtual machines are designed for the most intensive compute workloads, including deep learning, simulations, rendering and the training of neural networks. They also enable high-end visualization capabilities to allow for workstation and streaming scenarios by utilizing the NVIDIA GRID in Azure. \nTo know more about Azure N-Series, which having been in preview since August will be generally available from December 1st, see yesterday's post by Corey Sanders, Director of Compute, Azure, on the Azure blog which has links to pricing. \nAzure is just part of Microsoft's contribution to the future of AI, representing the infrastructure. Other parts are already open sourced - including its Cognitive Toolkit, the new name for its Computational Network Toolkit (CTNK). \nThe Democratizing AI article that both blog posts refer to states: We’re taking a four-pronged approach to how we think about Microsoft AI and how we pursue this bold ambition to democratize AI for all: We’re going to harness artificial intelligence to fundamentally change how we interact with the ambient computing, the agents, in our lives. We’re going to infuse every application that we interact with, on any device, at any point in time, with intelligence. We’ll make these same intelligent capabilities that are infused in our own apps — the cognitive capabilities — available to every application developer in the world. We’re building the world’s most powerful AI supercomputer and making it available to anyone, via the cloud, to enable all to harness its power and tackle AI challenges, large and small. \nFor those interested in AI research it's hard not to be excited at this point in time about how AI can impact all our lives for good.",

      "text": "By Andy Weir Senior News Editor Neowin LLC @gcaweir · 4 seconds ago with 0 comments \nMicrosoft spoilt the surprise a few days ago by prematurely publishing a blog post , but today, it officially announced Visual Studio for Mac, bringing a version of its popular software development suite to Apple systems. Microsoft described it as a \"one-stop shop for .NET development on the Mac, including Android, iOS and .NET Core technologies.\" \nMicrosoft said that VS for Mac includes \"the same Roslyn-powered compiler, IntelliSense code completion, and refactoring experience you would expect from a Visual Studio IDE\", adding: \nSince Visual Studio for Mac uses the same MSBuild solution and project format as Visual Studio, developers working on Mac and Windows can share projects across Mac and Windows transparently. \nWith multi-process debugging, you can use Visual Studio for Mac to debug both your front end application as well as your backend simultaneously. \nThe company says that VS for Mac ties in perfectly to its 'mobile first, cloud first' mantra. For mobile development, software creators can expect: The full power of the beloved-by-millions C# 7 programming language Complete .NET APIs for Android, iOS, tvOS, watchOS, and macOS The Xamarin.Forms API abstraction to maximize code sharing Access to thousands of .NET libraries on NuGet.org to accelerate your mobile development Highly optimized native code backed by the LLVM optimizing compiler \nMicrosoft promises that integrating mobile apps with a cloud backend is exceptionally simple too, whether you're using a custom backend solution, or connecting with pre-packaged Azure services: \nYou can use .NET Core to build your own backend services and deploy these to your Windows or Linux servers on Visual Studio for Mac, while the project templates will get you up and running with an end-to-end configuration. \nAdditionally developers can easily integrate Azure mobile services into their application for things like push notifications, data storage, and user accounts and authentication with Azure App Services. This is available in the new “Connected Services” project node. \nThe first Visual Studio for Mac Preview is available to download today , but Microsoft says that it's already working to bring more features to Mac users in the coming months.

      "text": "Printer-friendly version Email this CRN article \nMicrosoft took steps to make broader artificial intelligence capabilities accessible to partners Tuesday with the introduction of Azure instances geared for AI workloads, a cloud service for developing automated internet bots, and an alliance with an organization looking to keep the technology from destroying the world. \nWith the new Azure cloud products and partnership with OpenAI, a nonprofit founded by Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Y Combinator CEO Sam Altman, Microsoft hopes to make it easier for its partners to deploy cutting-edge services at an \"incredible moment in technology history,\" blogged Harry Shum, executive vice president of Microsoft's AI research. \n\"We’ve made major strides in artificial intelligence just in the past five years, achieving milestones many people who have devoted their lives to the field wouldn’t have thought possible,\" Shum said. \"Now, we have the opportunity to help our partners and customers use these breakthroughs to achieve their goals.\" \n[Related: The Race Is On: IBM, Google, Microsoft And AWS Aim To Deliver Machine Learning As A Cloud Service ] \nOpenAI, founded less than a year ago with the stated goal of preventing advances in AI from threatening humanity, will become a user of Microsoft's new N-Series of Azure VMs, which hit the market in December. \n\"These virtual machines are designed for the most intensive compute workloads, including deep learning, simulations, rendering and the training of neural networks. They also enable high-end visualization capabilities to allow for workstation and streaming scenarios by utilizing the Nvidia GRID in Azure,\" Shum said. \n\"This is indeed a very big step,\" said Dj Das, CEO of Third Eye Consulting, a Microsoft partner based in San Francisco. \"More for Microsoft than OpenAI.\" The partnership with the nonprofit gives the Redmond, Wash.-based software giant much-needed credibility in the data sciences market. And OpenAI benefits from obtaining large discounts on the N-Series instances powered by GPUs, Das said. Shum said on Microsoft's blog that the new Azure Bot Service gives developers cloud-based capabilities to employ Microsoft's framework for building bots that perform automated tasks on the internet. The service is serverless, running on Azure Functions, an event-driven platform that can execute code without spinning up Azure VM instances, according to Shum. Sarosh Hussain, practice lead at Credera, a Microsoft partner based in Dallas, described Microsoft's new cloud products as \"a great leap towards democratizing AI.\" Vital technologies driving advances in artificial intelligence -- big data storage and processing, powerful GPU-based compute, machine-learning tools for developing and manipulating algorithms -- are now accessible to anyone with a credit card, Hussain said, unlocking innovation for small companies and enterprises. \"Until recently these technologies were only accessible to researchers, startups and some large organizations,\" Hussain told CRN. \"The skill requirements do not diminish, but the barrier to entry becomes lower due to things such as Microsoft's bot framework and Azure bot as a service.\" Just about any application, be it greenfield or brownfield, can be enhanced or completely transformed using AI capabilities, Hussain said. But he also cautioned that \"while access and availability to those technologies is being consumerized, enterprises will need specialized skills to take advantage of these technologies.\" New roles will likely emerge such as AI developers, AI architects and AI engineers, Hussain said.",

      "text": "  10:40 AM EST Veracode Empowers Secure DevOps Environments Through Microsoft Visual Studio Team Services Extension Veracode Application Security Platform to embed seamless security testing into the continuous development lifecycle \nBURLINGTON, MA -- (Marketwired) -- 11/16/16 -- Veracode , a leader in securing the world's software, today announced a new extension that integrates the Veracode Application Security Platform with Microsoft Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS). The extension will enable developers and engineering teams using VSTS to apply application security testing into their DevOps environments or other continuous deployment models. \nEnabling Secure DevOps The integration simplifies the delivery of secure applications by moving vulnerability assessments earlier in the development process. This will enable developers to create applications that meet market demand on schedule, without compromising on security. In addition, the solution offers fewer disruptions for developers through integrated testing within the development lifecycle -- thereby reducing friction between security and development teams. \nIntegrating Security into the Development Process Veracode is the first application security provider to join the Microsoft VSTS Marketplace. Developers can now statically scan an application and receive results without additional manual effort. Teams can choose to use high accuracy of the Veracode scan to automatically stop the build or release pipeline if a vulnerability violates the company's policy. Teams can also create their own policy scans or Developer Sandbox scans with the VSTS extension, allowing them to choose the Veracode scanning workflow that best works for them. \n\"The focus of continuous deployment models like DevOps on automated, integrated testing presents an opportunity to build security into the development lifecycle, improving application security without impacting delivery times,\" said Tim Jarrett, senior director of security, Veracode. \"This solution enables developers to code securely, meeting the needs of both developers and security teams by delivering secure applications on time.\" \nShawn Nandi, senior director, Microsoft Corp. said, \"The Veracode extension for Visual Studio Team Services allows developers to test applications and resolve security flaws early in the development lifecycle. Now, teams can rely on VSTS to automatically raise an alarm if a critical issue is found. This reduced risk exposure paired with the ability to accelerate the delivery of secure applications will enable companies to realize the full potential of DevOps environment.\" \nDevelopment team leads or release engineers can install Veracode's VSTS integration extension into their VSTS instance from the Microsoft VSTS Marketplace, or download it for their local Microsoft Team Foundation Server.

      "text": "  10:30 AM EST Microsoft Fortifies Commitment to Open Source, Becomes Linux Foundation Platinum Member \nSAN FRANCISCO, CA--(Marketwired - November 16, 2016) - The Linux Foundation, the nonprofit advancing professional open source management for mass collaboration, today announced that Microsoft has joined the organization at a Platinum member during Microsoft's Connect(); developer event in New York. \nFrom cloud computing and networking to gaming, Microsoft has steadily increased its engagement in open source projects and communities. The company is currently a leading open source contributor on GitHub and earlier this year announced several milestones that indicate the scope of its commitment to open source development. The company released the open source .NET Core 1.0; partnered with Canonical to bring Ubuntu to Windows 10; worked with FreeBSD to release an image for Azure; and after acquiring Xamarin, Microsoft open sourced its software development kit. In addition, Microsoft works with companies like Red Hat, SUSE and others to support their solutions in its products. \n\"As a cloud platform company we aim to help developers achieve more using the platforms and languages they know,\" said Scott Guthrie, Executive Vice President, Microsoft Cloud and Enterprise Group. \"The Linux Foundation is home not only to Linux, but many of the community's most innovative open source projects. We are excited to join The Linux Foundation and partner with the community to help developers capitalize on the shift to intelligent cloud and mobile experiences.\" \nMicrosoft already contributes to several Linux Foundation projects, including Node.js Foundation, OpenDaylight, Open Container Initiative, R Consortium and Open API Initiative. \nJohn Gossman, Architect on the Microsoft Azure team, will join The Linux Foundation Board of Directors. \n\"Microsoft has grown and matured in its use of and contributions to open source technology,\" said Jim Zemlin, executive director of The Linux Foundation. \"The company has become an enthusiastic supporter of Linux and of open source and a very active member of many important projects. Membership is an important step for Microsoft, but also for the open source community at large, which stands to benefit from the company's expanding range of contributions.\" \nTo view a full roster of Linux Foundation members, please visit http://www.linuxfoundation.org/about/members . \nAbout The Linux Foundation \nThe Linux Foundation is the organization of choice for the world's top developers and companies to build ecosystems that accelerate open technology development and commercial adoption.

      "text": "In recent years, Microsoft has transformed itself from being the mortal enemy of Linux to being a productive participant in open-source communities. In a move that would have been unthinkable a decade ago, Microsoft today announced it is becoming a Platinum member of the Linux Foundation. As a Platinum member, Microsoft will provide $500,000 a year to the Linux Foundation and pledges to support the group's open-source and Linux efforts. Microsoft has been moving incrementally toward embracing Linux and open source over the last eight years, though the interaction with the Linux community initially was somewhat hostile. Back in 2001, Steve Ballmer, then CEO of Microsoft, famously said that Linux is cancer. In 2007, Microsoft alleged that open-source software, including Linux, infringes on 235 of Microsoft's patents. \"This is a good day. There was a time when the software industry in general was defined by rivalry and a zero-sum game mentality,\" Jim Zemlin, executive director of the Linux Foundation, told eWEEK . \"The biggest thing that open source and Linux has proven over the last 25 years is that sharing works, and you can better yourself and others at the same time.\" Zemlin traced Microsoft’s journey to embrace open source back to 2008, when the company joined the Apache Software Foundation. In 2009, Microsoft became one of the largest contributors to Linux, by way of its code for enabling Hyper-V virtualization support. Subsequently, Microsoft has open-sourced multiple efforts, including .NET and, earlier this year, PowerShell. \"Tens of thousands of lines of code have been open-sourced by Microsoft,\" Zemlin said. In Zemlin's view, Microsoft has clearly demonstrated it is a meaningful player in the open-source movement. Microsoft employs more software developers than any other single company, he said, and it's his hope the company will have a big, positive impact on the Linux Foundation community. The Linux Foundation itself has expanded in recent years to be about more than just Linux. It has launched multiple Linux Foundation Collaborative Projects including the Hyperledger Project for bitcoin and the Core Infrastructure Initiative (CII) for internet security, among other endeavors. Zemlin commented that Microsoft already has been participating in multiple Linux Foundation Collaborative Projects including CII, node.js Foundation, OpenAPI and the OpenDaylight Project for software-defined networking (SDN). \"Microsoft is an organization that participates across many of the open-source projects that the Linux Foundation hosts,\" Zemlin said. \"It's natural that now they will be joining the Linux Foundation at our highest level, which we're happy to see.\" Microsoft's $500,000 yearly Platinum membership dues will help the Linux Foundation in its many efforts to advance Linux and open-source technology. Zemlin noted membership supports the Linux Foundation's efforts including secure coding programs, diversity outreach and infrastructure development among other activities. \"Our goal is to create the greatest shared technology resource in history and Linux is the primary example of that, but there are lots of others, too,\" Zemlin said. \"In order for that to happen, we need to have vibrant communities that have a rich developer ecosystem and all the infrastructure that's needed to develop new code, bring new developers in, train developers and host events.\" Sean Michael Kerner is a senior editor at eWEEK and InternetNews.com.

      "text": "Yes, Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Can Defeat Alphabet Inc (GOOG) in Search Microsoft stock is one mobile platform away from dethroning Google Search By Craig Adeyanju , InvestorPlace Contributor | Nov 16, 2016, 11:43 am EST View All Posts \nThere’s no arguing that the Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT ) we have these days is different from the one we had in the first decade of the millennium. The fact that comparisons are being drawn between Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and Microsoft stock these days — with MSFT actually coming out ahead — is testament to this assertion. Source: Johannes Marliem Via Flickr \nFor most people, the fact that Microsoft is switching from being just a software company to designing its own computer hardware as well is the reason Microsoft stock is winning. \nThe company has reworked its business to become more vertically integrated, building a one-stop shop for the needs of enterprises and consumers. A recent move in that direction is the addition of customer relationship management functionalities that can be assessed through Outlook to the Office 365 SMB plan at no extra cost. \nMicrosoft execs noted that the Outlook Customer Manager — the name given to the CRM functionality — will be introduced to Office 365 E3 and E5 plans imminently. This makes Microsoft a stronger competitor to salesforce.com, inc. (NYSE: CRM ), to some extent, as it improves the value proposition of Office 365, which was already essential to the operation of several businesses. The Best Investments for 2017 \nIn short, Microsoft is working on getting even more ingrained into consumers’ lives. The only missing piece of the puzzle is a scalable mobile platform that works almost seamlessly with the Microsoft desktop platform. And there are rumors that the company is working on a Surface Phone due for release sometime in 2017. Microsoft stock holders likely aren’t too enthused with MSFT’s mobile prospects, as it hasn’t had the best luck with mobile in the past, but its Surface brand could be strong enough to pull mobile out of the swamp. The Battle Between Microsoft and Google \nIf the missing puzzle that is a coherent mobile platform comes around, and it creates an integrated MSFT ecosystem, Microsoft stock investors should expect a serious battle between Bing and Alphabet Inc’s (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Google Search. \nMicrosoft execs hinted at this (albeit without mentioning Google) during the recent Bing Ads Next event. Rik van der Kooi, corporate vice president of Microsoft Search Advertising, referred to Bing as an “intelligence fabric” that has been embedded into Windows 10, Cortana, Xbox and other products, including Hololens. He went on to say the future Bing will be personal, pervasive and offer a personal experience so much that it “might not be obvious users are even interacting with the search engine.” \nAn example of interacting with search engine without knowing it would be doing a product search on Hololens in which the user tests how a couch looks in their living room. Another example would be asking Cortana questions and getting what you need without actually launching the Bing search box. According to Kooi, Microsoft is working on these aspects.",

      "text": "Microsoft and Google bury the hatchet in one small way Google has joined the .NET Foundation, to help shape Microsoft's programming framework More like this Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft, speaking at the Build conference in San Francisco on March 30, 2016. Credit: Microsoft/IDGNS Email a friend   8:02   \nThere's no love lost between Google and Microsoft. The two companies have been fiercely competitive with one another in the public cloud, productivity and operating system markets. \nBut now there's one small glimmer of hope in the relationship between the two companies: Google has joined the .NET Foundation, to help drive forward the programming language framework Microsoft originated. \nGoogle will be a part of the technical steering group for the foundation, which helps guide the future of the platform and consults on changes to the .NET roadmap and project release schedule. The foundation oversees projects including .NET Core and the Roslyn .NET compiler. \nGoogle's fellow technical steering group members include Red Hat, Unity and Samsung, which announced Wednesday that developers will be able to use .NET Core to develop for its Tizen operating system. \nThe group is a set of somewhat strange bedfellows for Microsoft, but could help the company keep .NET and the C# programming language relevant in a broader set of circumstances. \nWednesday's news comes a few months after Microsoft made .NET Core generally available for use on Linux and macOS. Before the creation of the Foundation, the programming framework was more locked to Microsoft-controlled platforms like Windows. \nJulia Liuson, Microsoft's corporate vice president for Visual Studio, said at a press briefing that Google has a team dedicated to making sure that its public cloud platform is compatible with .NET. This partnership seems like a way for each of the companies to gain something from one another. \nThat's how IDC Program Director Al Hilwa saw it. He said in an email that the move could be emblematic of an improving relationship between Microsoft and Google. \n\"I think this is a mark of improving relationships between the two giants as the two have what each other craves,\" he said in an email. \"Microsoft is highly motivated to win startups and other emerging workloads, which Google technologies like Kubernetes have a lot of traction in, while Google is trying to build its enterprise business, something Microsoft has a lot of traction in.\" \nIt’s unclear, however, if the partnership will lead to an easing of relations between the two companies in other areas. Windows users, for example, have been clamoring for a YouTube app, something that Google has been unwilling to provide. \nThis partnership is part of a suite of announcements Microsoft made at its Connect conference in New York on Wednesday. The tech giant also announced that it will join the Linux Foundation as a platinum member, along with a host of product updates. RELATED TOPICS",

      "text": "Microsoft doubles down on Linux love, joins foundation SQL Server for Linux hits public beta, and Azure App Service now supports Linux More like this \nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella recently proclaimed the company's newfound love for Linux. Credit: James Niccolai   7:57   \nAfter a long campaign against open source and Linux, Microsoft has for the past few been pushing its love of the popular operating system. On Wednesday, the company made that even more official by joining the Linux Foundation, an organization that shepherds development of the operating system's kernel and provides funding for open source projects. \nMicrosoft also launched the public beta of SQL Server on Linux, the much-anticipated port of the relational database software that was first announced in March. Linux developers can also start working with a beta of Azure App Service, which is designed to take away the work of managing infrastructure for cloud-based apps. \nThe moves are part of an ongoing effort by the company to adopt and support Linux and open source in a variety of different ways. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella first proclaimed in 2014 that the company loves Linux. \nMicrosoft will be a Platinum member in the Linux Foundation, placing it alongside the likes of Intel, Oracle, Samsung and IBM. The move makes sense for Microsoft, given its open-source leanings of late. Jim Zemlin, the Foundation's executive director, said in a press release that he expects Microsoft will intensify \"its involvement and commitment to open development.\" \nBut things weren't always so cozy between the two organizations. In 2009, Zemlin blasted Microsoft for \"secretly attacking Linux\" after it sold a group of Linux-related patents. Microsoft, meanwhile, attacked Linux, with former CEO Steve Ballmer famously calling the operating system a \"cancer\" 15 years ago. \nBut at the same time, the door was open for the two organizations to work together, even during a period when Microsoft was much more aggressive towards Linux. \n\"We'd like to have a place where developers can come and work on making Linux more effectively interoperate with Microsoft products,\" Zemlin told InfoWorld's Paul Krill in a 2008 interview . \"And we'd like to do that in the open-source way that's not tied to any specific marketing agreement, that's not tied to any specific contract, that is an open process that can be participated in by anyone in the community.\" \nA warmer relationship between the two organizations began emerging last year when the two launched a certification for running Linux on Azure. In order to obtain the certificate, sysadmins had to pass a Microsoft exam about Azure, and a Linux Foundation exam about managing the open source operating system. \nMicrosoft also joined the Eclipse Foundation earlier this year. \nNow, Microsoft's move to join the Linux Foundation is an important step, according to IDC Program Director Al Hilwa. \n\"Microsoft is hitting all the right notes in terms of aligning its developer business with an ecosystem much broader than Windows,\" he said in an email. \"Joining the Linux Foundation is a natural progression of this strategy and one that might still generate a double take if it wasn’t for all the actions the company has already taken in terms of supporting Linux in Azure and with SQL Server.\" \nWith the release of the pubic beta for SQL Server on Linux, anyone will be able to take the relational database software for a spin on a Linux machine, though they shouldn't expect the full set of features available on Windows to make their way over to Linux just yet. \nMicrosoft has planned to make SQL Server on Linux available in the middle of next year, and Wednesday's launch is an important step along that path. \nMicrosoft General Manager Rohan Kumar said during a press event that the SQL Server team put a lot of work to making the relational database software feel like it’s at home on Linux, and not just a straight port of the database engine alone. \nAzure App Service is also getting the Linux treatment. Developers building Node.js and PHP applications that run on Linux now have a beta version of Microsoft's platform-as-a-service offering to try out. It's designed to help developers build web and mobile apps that easily scale and integrate with other services. \nAll of this is part of a suite of announcements Microsoft made at its Connect conference in New York on Wednesday. On top of all the Linux news, Google will join the .NET Foundation, and Microsoft is releasing a handful of updates to various Visual Studio products. RELATED TOPICS",

Microsoft also mentioned that its use of neural networks for speech and text translation is still at an early stage, but it is producing superior translations to what Statistical Machine Translation provides. You can try and compare the improved quality of these new neural network models by testing translations at https://translator.microsoft.com/neural .\nNeural network-powered translation is available for app developers using both the speech and text APIs:\nAll speech API calls are neural network-powered beginning today.

      "text": "Tweet \nThe year 2016 has been very weird. I mean, hell, a reality TV star is the president-elect of the USA -- it doesn't get more odd than that. \nWell, maybe it does, actually. Today, Microsoft becomes a Linux Foundation Platinum Member. But wait, isn't the Windows-maker an enemy of open source? Not anymore, folks. Actually, the company is a major contributor to the Linux kernel, and it has been embracing other open source projects too. Satya Nadella's Microsoft is a very different beast compared to the company under prior leadership. \n\"From cloud computing and networking to gaming, Microsoft has steadily increased its engagement in open source projects and communities. The company is currently a leading open source contributor on GitHub and earlier this year announced several milestones that indicate the scope of its commitment to open source development. The company released the open source .NET Core 1.0; partnered with Canonical to bring Ubuntu to Windows 10; worked with FreeBSD to release an image for Azure; and after acquiring Xamarin, Microsoft open sourced its software development kit. In addition, Microsoft works with companies like Red Hat, SUSE and others to support their solutions in its products\", says The Linux Foundation. \nALSO READ: Microsoft PowerShell now open source and available for both macOS and Linux \nScott Guthrie, executive vice president, Microsoft Cloud and Enterprise Group explains, \"as a cloud platform company we aim to help developers achieve more using the platforms and languages they know. The Linux Foundation is home not only to Linux, but many of the community's most innovative open source projects. We are excited to join The Linux Foundation and partner with the community to help developers capitalize on the shift to intelligent cloud and mobile experiences\". \nSince Microsoft was already embracing open source projects, including Linux, some may argue that this Platinum Membership is nothing more than a symbolic gesture. I disagree with that notion. This is a major signal to the open source community that the world is changing to its benefit, and the Linux Foundation is stronger as a result. \nRegardless of your opinion of Microsoft, having its backing (figuratively and financially) is very valuable. This move also solidifies the Windows-maker as an open source champion. In fact, John Gossman -- Azure Architect at Microsoft -- will be joining the Linux Foundation board of directors too.",

Credit: Microsoft/IDGNS Email a friend Use   IDG News Service | Nov 16, 2016 RELATED TOPICS Comments \nThere’s no love lost between Google and Microsoft. The two companies have been fiercely competitive with one another in the public cloud, productivity and operating system markets, at times leaving users in the lurch. \nThere’s one small glimmer of hope in the relationship between the two companies: Google has joined the .Net Foundation, to help drive forward the programming language framework Microsoft originated. [ Discover the career hacks for becoming the developer everyone wants in InfoWorld's Deep Dive. | Keep up with hot topics in programming with InfoWorld's Application Development newsletter . ] \nGoogle will be a part of the technical steering group for the foundation, which helps guide the future of the platform and consults on changes to the .Net roadmap and project release schedule. The foundation oversees projects including .Net Core and the Roslyn .Net compiler. \nGoogle’s fellow technical steering group members include Red Hat, Unity and Samsung, which announced Wednesday that developers will be able to use .Net Core to develop for its Tizen operating system. \nThe group is a set of somewhat strange bedfellows for Microsoft, but could help the company keep .Net and the C# programming language relevant in a broader set of circumstances. \nWednesday’s news comes a few months after Microsoft made .Net Core generally available for use on Linux and macOS. Before the creation of the Foundation, the programming framework was more locked to Microsoft-controlled platforms like Windows. \nJulia Liuson, Microsoft’s corporate vice president for Visual Studio, said at a press briefing that Google has a team dedicated to making sure that its public cloud platform is compatible with .Net. This partnership seems like a way for each of the companies to gain something from one another. \nThat’s how IDC Program Director Al Hilwa saw it. He said in an email that the move could be emblematic of an improving relationship between Microsoft and Google. \n“I think this is a mark of improving relationships between the two giants as the two have what each other craves,” he said in an email. “Microsoft is highly motivated to win startups and other emerging workloads, which Google technologies like Kubernetes have a lot of traction in, while Google is trying to build its enterprise business, something Microsoft has a lot of traction in.” \nIt’s unclear, however, if the partnership will lead to an easing of relations between the two companies in other areas. Windows users, for example, have been clamoring for a YouTube app, something that Google has been unwilling to provide for a while. \nThis partnership is part of a suite of announcements Microsoft made at its Connect conference in New York City on Wednesday. The tech giant also announced that it would be joining the Linux Foundation as a platinum member, along with a host of product updates. RELATED TOPICS",

Credit: James Niccolai Use   IDG News Service | Nov 16, 2016 RELATED TOPICS Comments \nAfter a long campaign against open source and Linux, Microsoft has for the past few been pushing its love of the popular operating system. On Wednesday, the company made that even more official by joining the Linux Foundation, an organization that shepherds development of the operating system’s kernel and provides funding for open source projects. \nMicrosoft also launched the public beta of SQL Server on Linux, the much-anticipated port of the relational database software that was first announced in March. Linux developers can also start working with a beta of Azure App Service, which is designed to take away the work of managing infrastructure for cloud-based apps. [ InfoWorld celebrates Linux at 25: A pictorial history . | How Linux changed the world . | Linus Torvalds on the evolution and future of Linux . | Containers and unikernels prove less is more . | Quick guide to Linux admin essentials . | Stay up on open source with the InfoWorld Linux report . ] \nThe moves are part of an ongoing effort by the company to adopt and support Linux and open source in a variety of different ways. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella first proclaimed in 2014 that the company loves Linux, and we’ve seen the results of that ever since. \nMicrosoft will be a Platinum member in the Linux Foundation, placing it alongside the likes of Intel, Oracle, Samsung and IBM. The move makes sense for Microsoft, given its open source leanings of late. Jim Zemlin, the Foundation’s executive director, said in a press release that he expects Microsoft will intensify “its involvement and commitment to open development.” \nBut things weren’t always so cozy between the two organizations. In 2009, Zemlin blasted Microsoft for “secretly attacking Linux” after it sold a group of Linux-related patents. Microsoft, meanwhile, attacked Linux, with former CEO Steve Ballmer famously calling the operating system a “cancer” 15 years ago. \nBut at the same time, the door was open for the two organizations to work together, even during a period when Microsoft was much more aggressive towards Linux. \n“We’d like to have a place where developers can come and work on making Linux more effectively interoperate with Microsoft products,” Zemlin told InfoWorld’s Paul Krill in a 2008 interview . “And we’d like to do that in the open-source way that’s not tied to any specific marketing agreement, that’s not tied to any specific contract, that is an open process that can be participated in by anyone in the community.” \nA warmer relationship between the two organizations began emerging last year when the two launched a certification for running Linux on Azure. In order to obtain the certificate, sysadmins had to pass a Microsoft exam about Azure, and a Linux Foundation exam about managing the open source operating system. \nMicrosoft also joined the Eclipse Foundation earlier this year . \nNow, Microsoft’s move to join the Linux Foundation is an important step, according to IDC Program Director Al Hilwa. \n“Microsoft is hitting all the right notes in terms of aligning its developer business with an ecosystem much broader than Windows,” he said in an email. “Joining the Linux Foundation is a natural progression of this strategy and one that might still generate a double take if it wasn’t for all the actions the company has already taken in terms of supporting Linux in Azure and with SQL Server.” \nWith the release of the pubic beta for SQL Server on Linux, anyone will be able to take the relational database software for a spin on a Linux machine, though they shouldn’t expect the full set of features available on Windows to make their way over to Linux just yet. \nMicrosoft has planned to make SQL Server on Linux available in the middle of next year, and Wednesday’s launch is an important step along that path. \nMicrosoft General Manager Rohan Kumar said during a press event that the SQL Server team put a lot of work to making the relational database software feel like it’s at home on Linux, and not just a straight port of the database engine alone. \nAzure App Service is also getting the Linux treatment. Developers building Node.js and PHP applications that run on Linux now have a beta version of Microsoft’s platform-as-a-service offering to try out. It’s designed to help developers build web and mobile apps that easily scale and integrate with other services. \nAll of this is part of a suite of announcements Microsoft made at its Connect conference in New York City on Wednesday. On top of all the Linux news, Google will be joining the .NET Foundation, and Microsoft is releasing a handful of updates to various Visual Studio products. RELATED TOPICS",

      "text": "Users should avoid Microsoft's just-released preview Windows patches Microsoft’s new monthly patching cadence include 'previews' that are not for general consumption, including KB 3197869 More like this Use   Comments \nYesterday Microsoft released eight “preview” patches, in line with its new method of releasing patches on the third Tuesday of every month. They’re optional, which means they won’t get installed unless you specifically check the Windows Update box. If you’re tempted to install them, don’t. \nPreview patches serve a good purpose, but they’re not for general consumption. [ The essentials for Windows 10 installation: Download the Windows 10 Installation Superguide today. | Stay up on key Microsoft technologies with the Windows Report newsletter . ] \nThe two major preview patches: KB 3197869 is the “November 2016 Preview of Monthly Quality Rollup for Windows 7 SP1 and Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1.” In other words, it’s an early look at the non-security patches for Windows 7 that Microsoft expects to roll out for real in December. You can see details of the patch on the Win7 update history page , where you can learn, for example, that this patch updates Belarus’ ISO 4217 code from BYN to BYR. Positively riveting. KB 3197875 is the “November 2016 Preview of Monthly Quality Rollup for Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2”—in other words, another preview of the non-security patches that will appear for real next month. There’s a long list of fixes on the Win8.1 update history page including, you guessed it, a change of Belarus’ ISO 4217 code from BYN to BYR. \nSeveral of you have written to me, confused about the patches. The simple instructions: Unless you know precisely what you’re doing, leave preview patches alone. You don’t need or want them. When they’re fully baked next month, Microsoft will roll them out. \nMicrosoft’s intentions here are noble: It's giving programmers and system administrators a chance to kick the tires on the new non-security patches before the patches get rolled out through the Windows Automatic Update chute. If you write programs for Windows or you control a bunch of Windows machines, you should take a look at the previews. The vast majority of Windows users should look the other way. Unless you specifically hunt down the patches, check them and install them, you’re just fine. \nIn a similar vein, we saw four previews of .Net Framework patch rollups: KB 3195382 , the “November 2016 Preview of Quality Rollup for the .Net Framework 2.0 SP2, 4.5.2, 4.6 on Windows Vista SP2 and Windows Server 2008 SP2” KB 3195383 , the “November 2016 Preview of Quality Rollup for the .Net Framework 3.5, 4.5.2, 4.6, 4.6.1 on Windows Server 2012” KB 3196684 , the “November 2016 Preview of Quality Rollup for .Net Framework 3.5, 4.5.2, 4.6, 4.6.1 on Windows 8.1 and Server 2012 R2” KB 3196686 , the “November 2016 Preview of Quality Rollup for .Net Framework 3.5.1, 4.5.2, 4.6, 4.6.1 on Windows 7 SP1 and Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1” \nThere’s also KB 3197878 , the “November 2016 Preview of Monthly Quality Rollup for Windows Server 2012.” \nThere’s one oddity I’ll be following: The preview monthly rollup for Windows 8.1 includes a fix for a bug introduced by Microsoft in the August security patch MS16-100 . Oddly, that bug isn’t described in the security bulletin, but the Win8.1 update list says the monthly rollup preview “addressed issue with the boot partition appearing in File Explorer after installing MS16-100.” \nThe reason why I’ll be watching – and you should, too: We need to make sure that bugs introduced by Microsoft’s security-only patches are fixed with security-only patches. If Microsoft starts fixing its own bugs willy-nilly, by including security bug fixes only in non-security patches, it won’t be possible to keep your PC upgraded with security-only patches. \nFor those of you accustomed to my patchocalypse terminology , crisscrossing patches will make it impossible to stay in Group B. You’ll be forced into the telemetry-friendly Group A, if only to fix the problems created by patches in Group B. \nThe price of patching liberty is eternal vigilance. RELATED TOPICS",

      "text": "By Rich Woods Neowin LLC @@TheRichWoods · 3 seconds ago with 0 comments \nIt was back in March at Microsoft's Build 2016 developer conference that the company announced Windows Ink , which would be new pen features coming in the Anniversary Update (AU). The firm said that users would be able to draw on maps and pictures via Windows Maps and Microsoft Photos, but while the former was updated in time for the AU , the latter was not. \nAlmost a month ago, Insiders on the Fast ring finally saw Windows Ink support in Photos , and today, the feature is finally rolling out to everyone. The new version number is 16.1111.10000.0, and all Windows 10 devices will receive it, although it seems that you can't use the pen features unless you're on the Anniversary Update. \nWhen drawing on your pictures, you'll be able to choose from a pencil, pen, or marker. After you're done, you'll find that it will playback what you drew as you drew it, so you'll be able to share it as either a finished image, or as a video. \nTo download or update your Microsoft Photos app, click here .",

      "text": "Platform Intel 64 / OS X / Intel 32 Price $9.99 Load more... \nMicrosoft Office 2016 - Unmistakably Office, designed for Mac. \nThe new versions of Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook and OneNote provide the best of both worlds for Mac users - the familiar Office experience paired with the best of Mac. If you already use Office on a PC or iPad, you will find yourself right at home in Office 2016 for Mac. It works the way you expect, with the familiar ribbon interface and powerful task panes. Mac users will appreciate the modernized Office experience and the integration of Mac capabilities like Full Screen view and Multi-TouchTM gestures. With full Retina display support, your Office documents look sharper and more vibrant than ever. \nOffice for Mac is cloud-connected, so you can quickly get to the documents you’ve recently used on other devices and pick up where you left off. New, built-in document sharing tools make it easy to invite teammates to work on a document together. When sharing documents, you won’t have to worry about losing content or formatting, as Office for Mac offers unparalleled compatibility with Office on PCs, tablets, phones and online. \nNote: an office365 subscription is required. Version 15.28: \nNote: Although the full download is still 15.19.1, there are updates to the 64-bit versions of 15.28 for the components in Related Links. Note: Subscribers can updated current installations of Office 2016 to 15.28 using Office 365. Note To install this update, you must be running OS X Yosemite 10.10 or a later version, and you must have a valid Microsoft Office 365 subscription. Additionally, see more information about Office 365 Subscription options. If you already have Office 2011 for Mac installed, you can run Office 2011 and Office 2016 side-by-side. Outlook Find and fix accessibility issues that occur when composing messages or invitations by using the Accessibility Checker. Microsoft AutoUpdate 3.8.1 Microsoft AutoUpdate includes a new option to automatically detect, download, and install updates. Fixes an issue where Microsoft AutoUpdate crashes when older versions of Microsoft Silverlight are installed. I'm not a big fan of Microsoft and its products, but this one is really awesome. The thing I like most about Microsoft Office 2016 is its design. It is simple, but at the same time it is very intuitive. Every tool you need is close at hand. The application doesn't freeze, doesn't crash or cause any inconveniences. Looks like Microsoft Office 2016 will become the first Microsoft app I will purchase and recommend to my friends and people on the Internet. I have used Microsoft Office since the very beginning in the early 1990s and it's amazing to me that Microsoft doesn't get more criticism for the way it cripples the version for Apple Macs.Among the most glaring that I have encountered so far is in PowerPoint 2016's complete lack of a Grayscale or Black and White view, a feature that has been present in PowerPoint on Windows since at least Office 2003. This view allows you to see how slides will print on a black & white laser printer and it's utterly missing from PowerPoint 2016. Other missing features on the Mac include Word 2016 hyperlinking of cross-references and table of contents for documents exported as PDF; font embedding in present in Windows PowerPoint but missing for Mac; Windows Excel has more number formats than Excel for Mac.I could go on, but it's obvious that Office for Mac is deliberately crippled by Microsoft.",

      "text": "share \nFormer Microsoft CEO might have labeled Linux \"a cancer\" 15 years ago, but things couldn't be any different this week. Microsoft, the software giant that has built its empire on closed-source proprietary software, is joining the Linux Foundation. 10 years ago that would have seemed unimaginable, but Microsoft has been steadily embracing open source recently, leading it to become the top organization with the most open source contributors on Github . \nAs Ars Technica notes , Microsoft has been contributing to Linux for several years now, and Jim Zemlin, executive director of the Linux Foundation, welcomes the company joining the foundation. \"Microsoft is better able to collaborate with the open source community to deliver transformative mobile and cloud experiences to more people.\" \nMicrosoft has been steadily embracing open source recently \nMicrosoft has truly embraced Satya Nadella's culture change at the company, and the software maker has open sourced PowerShell , Visual Studio Code , and Microsoft Edge's JavaScript engine recently. Microsoft also partnered with Canonical to bring Ubuntu to Windows 10 , and acquired Xamarin to aid mobile app development. Microsoft even open sourced Xamarin's SDKs and developer tools, and brought SQL Server to Linux. \nAlongside Microsoft's Linux Foundation membership, Google is also making its own surprising news. Google is joining the .NET Foundation, Microsoft's major competitor to Java and Android. While Google hasn't shown much interest in supporting .NET or providing apps for Microsoft's new UWP platform, it's planning to support .Net in the Google Cloud Platform. \nMicrosoft's open-source news arrives alongside a Visual Studio for Mac release . Microsoft accidentally revealed the new software earlier this week, and it's built on top of Xamarin Studio that the company acquired earlier this year. Windows and Mac developers will be able to share and contribute to the same projects with the new software. More From The Verge",

      "text": "Microsoft warns for “Criminal case against you fax” ransomware campaign Posted 16 November 2016 18:25 CET by Jan Willem Aldershoff \nMicrosoft warns internet users for a new method of cybercriminals that try to spread ransomware through email attachments. The attachment is a .RAR file pretending to be a fax message that claims there is a criminal case against you. \nBy using this subject the cybercriminals hope you panic and open the attached file immediately with the password provide in the email. The file is password protected for a reason, this way the cybercriminals hope to bypass antivirus scanners. \nWhen the .RAR file is opened it users are left with a .WSF file. This is a malcious obfuscated Windows Script File (WSF) known as Crimace . When the file is opened it shows an error message stating the fax can’t be displayed. In reality the Crimace script installs the WinPlock ransomware in the background. WinPlock is able to encrypt 2620 different kinds of file types. To decrypt files it demands a ransom of 0.55 Bitcoin (about $400). \n“WinPlock is a family of ransomware that has been around since September 2015 but did not have significant activity until recently. The discovery of this new variant signals that it’s back to wreak havoc,” Microsoft writes on its blog. Related Forum:",

      "title": "Microsoft releases SQL Server Preview for Ubuntu and Red Hat Enterprise Linux",
      "text": "Tweet \nMicrosoft is a big proponent of open source, something highlighted by its becoming a Linux Foundation Platinum Member earlier today. The company has been contributing to multiple projects, and back in March, it even announced it was bringing SQL Server to Linux -based operating systems. \nToday, the Windows-maker follows through on its promise and delivers SQL Server Preview packaged for two of the most popular business-used Linux-based operating systems -- Ubuntu and Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). While it is not ready for prime-time, both administrators and developers that prefer those aforementioned operating systems can start testing now. \n\"We are excited to announce the public preview of the next release of SQL Server on Linux and Windows, which brings the power of SQL Server to both Windows -- and for the first time ever -- Linux. SQL Server enables developers and organizations to build intelligent applications with industry-leading performance and security technologies using their preferred language and environment. With the next release of SQL Server, you can develop applications with SQL Server on Linux, Windows, Docker, or macOS (via Docker) and then deploy to Linux, Windows, or Docker, on-premises or in the cloud\", says the SQL Server Team. \nALSO READ: Microsoft PowerShell now open source and available for both macOS and Linux \nThe team further says, \"we have made it easier than ever to get started with SQL Server. You'll find native Linux installations with familiar RPM and APT packages for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Ubuntu Linux, and packages for SUSE Linux Enterprise Server will be coming soon as well. The Windows download is available on the Technet Eval Center. Finally, the public preview on Windows and Linux is also available on Azure Virtual Machines (coming soon) and as images available on Docker Hub, offering a quick and easy installation within minutes\". \nWant to try SQL Server for Linux yourself? Microsoft shares the below links that contain instructions. Install on Ubuntu Linux \nIf you do decide to give it a go, please remember that it is only a preview. You definitely do not want to start setting things up in production as if it were final. Keep in mind that there can be bugs and potential data issues, so it should really be reserved for testing purposes only.",

      "text": "Informed news analysis every weekday 4 no-bull takeaways from Microsoft joining the Linux Foundation This isn't the Linux-hating Microsoft of old, but neither is it the shiny, happy Microsoft we'd like to think. Here are four reasons why   Comments \nLet’s set aside all talk of flying pigs and skating rinks in hell. \nMicrosoft joining the Linux Foundation as a platinum member was an inevitability, given the company’s ongoing embrace of open source, not an aberration. But such a team-up isn’t an endpoint to Microsoft’s adventures in open source. Consider it the end of the beginning—the last of the first necessary steps Microsoft must take. \nHere are four key insights into what this means for Microsoft as an open source company (what a term, right?), in both the short and long term. 1. It isn’t just about Linux \nAnd neither is the Linux Foundation. A lot of the projects Microsoft has been helping out with under the Linux Foundation’s umbrella are infrastructure and developer-oriented projects that Microsoft’s user base is interested in leveraging. \nOne example is the R Consortium. Back in 2015, Microsoft acquired Revolution Analytics , which provides a widely used commercial implementation of the R statistical programming language. Microsoft was wise enough to recognize that R grows best in the wild, and chose to preserve the open source underpinnings of the R language and support the R Consortium that promotes the language and its toolset. \nAnother Linux Foundation project, the Open Container Initiative , is also valuable to Microsoft in a way that simply didn’t exist even a couple of years ago. Microsoft recently reworked the Windows kernel to support Docker-style containers—not as a way to absorb competition, but to avoid being left behind by sea changes in software development methodologies. \nFor Microsoft to be part of the Linux Foundation means being involved in all these efforts as well. It’s up for grabs how much “involvement” means “influence,” but the same applies to anyone of Microsoft’s size that’s a Linux Foundation member (of which there are more than a few). But in Microsoft’s case, criticisms about such things will matter more than they would for anyone else. 2. Microsoft still has a lot of proprietary software, and it’s going to stay that way \nIn no way does this move constitute a signal that Microsoft is preparing to open source its key proprietary products. The Microsoft Windows kernel, Microsoft SQL Server, some crucial parts of the Azure stack, and so on—those are all still strong moneymakers for Microsoft in their current incarnations. You can expect them to remain proprietary for a good long while. \nOther platinum-level members of the Linux Foundation are equally committed to their proprietary bits, despite investments they have made in open source. Case in total point: Oracle is nobody’s idea of an open source innovator investing in Linux for its own sake. Microsoft followed—and is still mostly in—this mold. \nMaybe there’ll come a day where the cloud generates so much revenue for Microsoft it won’t see the need to keep its bits under lock and key. But that day is still nowhere in sight—and it’s not worth waiting for when there’s so much else going on in the near term that’s arguably far more important. 3. This helps Microsoft help itself \nA common theme in discussions about Microsoft’s involvements with Linux and open source is that it’s been a self-serving effort. Over time, though, Microsoft has found more places where its best interests coincide nicely with those of others—but again, in pragmatic and transactional ways. \nWhen Microsoft started contributing to the Linux kernel back in 2008 , it was mainly to ensure that Linux ran well under Hyper-V. Altruism and the “spirit of open source” had little to do with the decision. Having Linux run well in more places was a win for Linux, but Microsoft was hoping it would mean at least as much of a win for Microsoft, too. \nFast-forward to today. Many of the plans under the umbrella of the Linux Foundation mesh with Microsoft’s own efforts, directly or indirectly. Microsoft’s project to run Linux software natively on Windows has the chance to bring users to Windows who would have previously scorned it. Support for containers in Windows means a whole open source ecosystem that was previously confined to Linux is now cross-platform. \nMost people won’t complain if this winds up being good for everyone concerned. But the thing to watch for is whether it’ll be good for Microsoft first and foremost. 4. There’s still a lot of room for change on Microsoft’s part \nDon’t get this wrong, Microsoft joining the Linux Foundation would have been pretty much unthinkable even a short time ago. But it is only one of many possible steps that Microsoft could still take. \nOne step that hasn’t been taken is for Microsoft to also join the Open Invention Network , a consortium intended to neutralize software-patent-based threats against Linux. InfoWorld’s Andrew Oliver has long been skeptical of Microsoft’s attitudes towards open source. He’d like to see Microsoft walk more like it talks—not just by dropping pending lawsuits involving open source patents andy swearing off them in the future \nThere are no signs that this is on the books yet, but one can hope that Microsoft joining the Linux Foundation is a prelude.

      "text": "Elon Musk-Backed AI Startup, Microsoft Ink Cloud Agreement (TSLA, MSFT) By Richard Saintvilus | November 16, 2016 — 8:05 AM EST \nElon Musk's artificial intelligence non-profit continues to work towards its goal of developing and democratizing the technology. \nOn Tuesday, OpenAI, the research firm that Tesla ( TSLA ) CEO Elon Musk co-founded, announced that it has signed an agreement to run most of its large-scale experiments on Microsoft Corporation's ( MSFT ) flagship cloud service Azure. \nOpenAI will use Azure for its experiments in deep learning and AI. Aside from Musk, OpenAI is also backed by venture capitalist Sam Altman, Amazon Web Services, tech investor Peter Thiel and Reid Hoffman, co-founder of LinkedIn Corporation ( LNKD ). \n\"OpenAI chose Microsoft due to our deep learning research and ongoing commitment to AI, along with Azure’s support for open source technologies and its unique combination of high performance computing, big data and intelligence capabilities such as Azure Batch, Azure Machine Learning and the Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (formerly CNTK),\" said Microsoft in a blog post about the agreement. (See also, Microsoft, NVIDIA Collaborate on Enterprise AI ) \nThe cloud-computing services will be powered by graphic chips designed by Nvidia Corporation ( NVDA ). The company says that the chips are designed to support intensive computing workloads, including deep learning and simulations. \"In the coming months we will use thousands to tens of thousands of these machines to increase both the number of experiments we run and the size of the models we train,\" said OpenAI in a blog post. \nEarlier this year, OpenAI unveiled the OpenAI Gym aimed at providing a collaborative testing ground for AI research of all kinds, including those aimed at machine learning trials. Tuesday's announcement with Microsoft underscores how quickly collaboration is taking place. And more importantly, it highlights how critical AI has become for companies who are looking to cement their place in the future world of computing.
