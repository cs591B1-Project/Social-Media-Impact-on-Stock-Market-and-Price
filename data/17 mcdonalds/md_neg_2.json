      "text": "We all know that fast food isn’t exactly the healthiest option but now people claiming to be employees have shared their nasty kitchen secrets.\nFrom boiled chicken to frozen food, their stomach-churning allegations just might make you think twice before blindly ordering again.\nAn anonymous Reddit user kicked off proceedings when they asked: “Fast food workers – What should we never order from you?” They received almost 16,000 replies.\nSome of the first people to reply claimed to be McDonald’s workers.\nCall_Me_Feefer alleged: “Fish fillet from McDonald’s, I’ve seen those things sit there for hours before getting served.”\nAnother user blackjak852 agreed, claiming: “I used to work at McDonald’s. Don’t order our fish patties.”\n“No one ever does and I swear some days we’d make a batch and it would sit there all day until someone ordered some.”\nMcDonald’s Filet-O-Fish Photo: McDonald's Another user named SGkurisu also suggested the fish patty was bad and claimed: “My McDonald’s kept the fish sandwiches in a super dirty cabinet and spent like five seconds cooking it when it actually gets ordered.”\nThere was also advice to late night diners to stay away from McDonald’s altogether.\nUser The Pastry Dragon said: “I wouldn’t order from McDonald’s after ten pm.\n“We had a toilet where the sink was outside of the door.”\n“At night management counts money and does paperwork, so it is pretty much anarchy.”\n“Anyway, several people would use the restroom without washing their hands or putting on gloves and then make food.”\nIt wasn’t just McDonald’s that got a bad rap from ex-workers – users claimed KFC and Subway have some dodgy items too.\nA bucket of KFC Extra Crispy fried. Photo: Getty Images Redditor Hotpotabo alleged that in the Subway branch he worked at the chicken was actually “boiled in a microwave.”\nAnd if you are a KFC fan, ex-employee JoeyBosa advised to stay away from the gravy.\nHe claimed: “It is primarily made of the filthy oil that stores up at the bottom of the cookers over the day and is then served to customers the next day.”\nThe coffee chain Starbucks wasn’t spared either and was slammed for its hot food offerings.\nLikebaker alleged: “All Starbucks food is reheated frozen food.”\n“Ridiculous how little people realize that.\n“Doesn’t mean it doesn’t taste good, its just not fresh at all and incredibly over priced.”\nIf you do want to save some cash on your fast food favorite, social media users are going crazy for the poor man’s Big Mac .\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google WhatsApp Email Copy This article originally appeared on The Sun .\nFiled under fast food ,  kfc ,  mcdonald's ,  reddit ,  restaurants",

      "text": "McDonald's is suing Florence, Italy for preventing them from opening a restaurant 4:28 PM, Nov 10, 2016   \nMcDonald’s is suing the city of Florence, Italy for more than $19 million after the city has denied the chain the right to build a restaurant in a historic plaza. \nIn June, Florence mayor Dario Nardella denied McDonald’s the right to build a restaurant in the Piazza del Duomo, near the city’s historic renaissance-style Cathedral. The BBC reports that the decision was upheld in July by a panel in charge of preserving the city’s history. \nBut McDonald’s says it has changed its plans to fit within the city’s guidelines, and claims it’s being discriminated against. It estimates that it will lose almost a million Euros a year for the next 18 years, and it wants Florence to pay up. \n\"We completely agree that the cultural and artistic heritage and the Italian historical town centres have to be protected and guaranteed, as well as the traditions and the historical small shops, but we cannot accept discriminatory regulations that damage the freedom of private initiative without being advantageous to anyone,\" McDonald’s said in a statement to the BBC. \n“We also have the right to say no,” Nardella told city council. \nThis isn’t the first time McDonald’s has had trouble opening a restaurant in Italy. Earlier this year, the Catholic church voiced its displeasure after the chain tried to open a restaurant just blocks away from the Vatican. \nAlex Hider is a writer for the E.W.

The BBC reports that the decision was upheld in July by a panel in charge of preserving the city’s history. \nBut McDonald’s says it has changed its plans to fit within the city’s guidelines, and claims it’s being discriminated against. It estimates that it will lose almost a million Euros a year for the next 18 years, and it wants Florence to pay up. \n\"We completely agree that the cultural and artistic heritage and the Italian historical town centres have to be protected and guaranteed, as well as the traditions and the historical small shops, but we cannot accept discriminatory regulations that damage the freedom of private initiative without being advantageous to anyone,\" McDonald’s said in a statement to the BBC. \n“We also have the right to say no,” Nardella told city council. \nThis isn’t the first time McDonald’s has had trouble opening a restaurant in Italy. Earlier this year, the Catholic church voiced its displeasure after the chain tried to open a restaurant just blocks away from the Vatican. \nAlex Hider is a writer for the E.W.

      "text": "Leo Burnett Malaysia created a new experience for McDonald’s global icon, Big Mac and threw the Internet into a singing frenzy from 13-31 October 2016 with the return of McDonald’s Malaysia Big Mac Chant Challenge. The Challenge was given local flavor with the participation from Malaysian singers Elizabeth Tan, Siti Nordiana, Fuying & Sam, and KeQing.\nLeveraging on an integrated digital touchpoint platform to engage with the target audience, Leo Burnett Malaysia’s idea synchronised in harmony with McDonald’s Malaysia’s stance on relying in the power of digital platforms.\n\"McDonald’s Malaysia strongly believes in the power of digital and mobile to reach our target audiences effectively. It provides the perfect avenue for customers to interact with the brand, which in return drives business results,” said Eugene Lee, senior manager of McDonald’s Malaysia.\nTaking the cue from the success debut of the Big Mac Dubsmash in 2015, the contest ran for its second year through an exclusive collaboration with Smule, the leading karaoke application in Malaysia which has over two million monthly active users within the country.\nBarry Victor, creative group head of Leo Burnett Malaysia added that the digital campaign was made accessible via other popular social touchpoints such as Facebook Carousel and Canvas, and Instagram in order to engage on a wider range of audience and generate submissions.\nOut of the 1,263 verified videos of Big Mac chanters submissions, 16 were shortlisted in the hopes of being the lucky grand prize winner to walk away with the coveted RM10,000 cash prize among others.\n“In order to engage with the younger audience, we created the Big Mac Chant Challenge whereby ‘chanters’ would sing the famous Big Mac Chant in their most creative manner. This time, through the collaboration with Smule, users are able to sing a duet together with their favourite personalities that has partnered with us for the contest,” said Andrew Low, executive creative director of Leo Burnett Malaysia.\n ",

      "text": "Fast food titan says chilling water and cola syrup makes the taste so great Storing the Coca-Cola syrup in stainless steel cylinders also helps McDonald's also has much wider straw to help drink reach tastebuds faster \nBy Imogen Blake For Mailonline \nPublished: 11:15 EST, 10 November 2016 | Updated: 16:13 EST, 10 November 2016 \nIf you've ever been to McDonald's, chances are you've also bought a coke from one of its machines. \nIt may just be standard Coca-Cola, but some fans claim the drink at McDonald's is better than at any other fast food chain. \nYou may not agree, but the restaurant has now revealed the secret behind its most popular thirst-quencher on its website. \nThe reason for the drinks's success is all to do with the way its chilled, the water purity and how the Coca-Cola syrup is stored. \nMany fans say that McDonald's Coca-Cola tastes better than at other fast food restaurants - and the restaurant has revealed why \nAccording to author Mark Proffitt, who wrote a blog about why McDonald's cola tastes better than at any other fast food chain, most Coke retailers get their syrup in a bag. \nThis is not the case at McDonald's where a number of steps are taken to create the perfect tasting Coke. \nOne of those measures is to pre-chill the water and Coca-Cola syrup before the liquids are put into the drinks dispensers in stores. \nThe syrup is also measured out very precisely to make allowances for melting ice, and the machine itself is also kept very cold. \nAs about 85 per cent of a cola drink is made up of water, if the quality of the water isn't good, then the drink won't taste at its best. \nMcDonald's therefore makes sure it has 'gold standard' filtration methods. \nThe way the fast food titan stores its syrup is also crucial to its resulting taste. \nMost Coke retailers get their syrup in a bag box, according to author Mark Proffitt, who wrote a blog about why McDonald's cola tastes better than at any other fast food chain. \nThe reason for the drinks's success is all to do with the way its chilled, the water purity and how the Coca-Cola syrup is stored \nBut McDonald’s sells so much Coca-Cola that it receives its syrup inside stainless steel cylinders, which keep it fresher. \nIt also is used up very quickly due to the number of sales at McDonald's, which also contributes to its addictive taste. \nThe final straw is in fact all to do with the McDonald's straw. It's much wider than a typical straw at many other restaurants, which the eatery claims makes the drink taste better. \nIt said on its website: 'The water and Coca-Cola syrup are pre-chilled before entering our fountain dispensers with the ratio of syrup set to allow for ice to melt. \n'We also keep our fountain beverage system cold so your drink can always be at the peak of refreshing. \n'In order to ensure our drinks are always meeting a gold standard, we have proper filtration methods in place. \n'There’s also our straw – it’s slightly wider than a typical straw, so all that Coke taste can hit all your tastebuds.' \nIn a statement on its website, McDonald's revealed: ' There are many reasons the Coca-Cola tastes so great at McDonald’s. We simply follow the guidelines set by Coca-Cola and take steps to ensure it tastes the same as when you buy it in a bottle.' \nI",

      "text": "McDonald’s just answered WHY their soda tastes better than anyone else’s. \nMcDonald’s just gave an answer of WHY their soda tastes better than anyone else’s. \nHere are their four reasons…\n1. They keep their machines, syrups, and soda water ice cold. Other places have their syrup and machines at room temperature, and their soda water isn’t quite that cold.\n2. They use special machines that are constantly re-circulating the soda water to keep it the perfect temperature and to make sure it has the exact right level of carbonation.\n3. They invest in expensive water filtration systems, so the water won’t have any aftertaste that could affect the soda.\n4. And their giant, wide straws give you bigger sips so, quote, “the taste can hit all your taste buds.” \nClick Here to see more. ",

And they don’t actually have meat, which is a good thing.\nBut if you take a look at the dish – or as it’s called in Italy, the ‘Sweety con Nutella’ – it essentially looks like bountiful amounts of the hazelnut spread sandwiched between two of the fast food giant’s signature buns.\n(Picture: McDonald’s) McDonald’s Italy announced its new arrival on its Facebook page yesterday, writing: ‘A soft sweetness has arrived that you will not be able to resist.\n‘Try Sweety with Nutella now: soft bread with a creamy, indulgent center!’\nThe post has since received more than 45,000 shares and 30,000 likes, because why wouldn’t it?\nLet’s hope flights to Italy are reasonable at this time of year.\nMORE: Kanye West has written a poem about McDonalds because Kanye \nMORE: The new Nando’s menu is here to make sure you have a very PERi Christmas \nMORE: Eating at posh restaurants makes you fatter than eating at McDonalds, so that’s good ",

      "text": "By Mike Householder, Associated Press \nPOTTERVILLE, Mich. (AP) – Nearly everywhere you look inside one Michigan McDonald’s, there’s an 18-year-old Curtis.\nLeith, Logan and Lucas Curtis work in the kitchen; Lauren Curtis is responsible for the front counter; and Lindsey Curtis handles the lobby and dining area of the restaurant where the quintuplets work in Potterville. Their mother calls the arrangement “McCurtis.”\nIt started about a year ago when boss Renee Draves asked Lucas Curtis a question she often poses to her younger workers: Did he and his co-worker/sister have any siblings looking for a job? She was floored by Lucas’ answer.\n“She wondered if we had any other siblings, and, funny enough, we did,” Lucas said, smiling.\nLucas is the youngest of the quintuplets, born three minutes after older brother Leith. Lucas and his sister Lauren started working at the McDonald’s last fall, and their three siblings followed suit earlier this year.\nYet few customers are aware that the non-identical fivesome, who make up 11 percent of their senior class at Potterville High School, are related. They represent about half the restaurant’s staff on a typical Sunday, but only recently has word spread about their unique relationship.\n“Up until this point, nobody knew,” said their father, Leith Curtis, a police officer in nearby Lansing who himself is a twin.\nLucas noted that he and his siblings get along well, so working together has been easy.\nDraves, who owns four McDonald’s restaurants in the area, said she couldn’t be happier.\n“Being a quintuplet, they know teamwork probably better than anyone else,” she said. “To have quintuplets working collectively, all at the same time, I would go out on a limb and say we are the only McDonald’s that’s ever had quintuplets.”\nPlus, Draves noted, she has a mathematical advantage.\n“If I have a shift that I need covered, I can call their house, and it’s a one-in-five shot that I’m going to get one of them in,” she said.\n© Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

      "text": "Watching This McDonald's Employee Make 4 Big Macs At Once Is Surprisingly Impressive Food News 16 hours ago \nMaking burgers at McDonald's isn't exactly considered an art, but with the way this employee put together these Big Macs, you can at least appreciate the hustle. \nA YouTube channel called How To Work At McDonald's gave a behind the scenes look at how Big Macs are made behind the counter. Whether he was just showing off for the camera, or this is actually how things work back there, the guy made four of them at once and it's fascinating to watch. \nFrom the way he placed the buns, to his form when seasoning the meat, this guy actually looked like he enjoyed what he was doing, which you wouldn't expect from a minimum wage fast food job. \nBig ups to this guy and his technique, and shout out to all those who put in proper effort to make sure our food comes out bangin'. \n*Previous version of this article said he made eight Big Macs, but we're blind, and it was indeed only four. Still impressive.* Get FOOD in your inbox! ",

      "text": "McDonald's Election Day Ad Illustrates Different Types of Fry Eaters By: Laura McQuarrie - Nov 11, 2016 References: mcdonalds & adeevee For the 2016 US Presidential Election, McDonald's created an election day ad that shows how conservative, moderate and liberal individuals might choose to eat their fast food fries with or without condiments. The humorous fast food ad shows each type of fry eater with a different level of ketchup on their fried potatoes and noted that on election day, people should \"vote with taste.\" The US Presidential Election provided ample opportunity for brands to step up with a variety of political-themed marketing stunts, campaigns and print ads, leaving them the chance to get as involved as they'd like in the sensitive subject of politics. This McDonald's ad is a perfect example of content that fans of the brand will find both relevant, tasteful and humorous.",

      "text": "On her lunch break in Chicago’s Loop, Erica Kelley often strolls by McDonald’s, which beckons with some newer items straight out of a hipster cafe: antibiotic-free chicken, kale salads and whole-wheat muffins.\nThe 33-year-old jewelry designer, who has a passion for animal welfare, would seem a natural customer for the new, more eco-friendly Golden Arches. But she still favors Peach & Green, a local cafe that advertises “all natural, locally sourced, wholesome food” like steel-cut, dairy-free oatmeal.\n“It’s just a gimmick,” Kelley said of offerings such as McDonald’s antibiotic-free buttermilk crispy chicken sandwich. “I still think it’s gross.”\nFast-food chains are shelling out millions to purge preservatives, artificial ingredients and other unmentionables. But they are learning that health nuts are tough to crack and other customers don’t seem to mind that McDonald’s special sauce may contain -- whatever. For their part, diet experts say the revamped items may not be all that good for you.\nIn October, McDonald’s Corp. Chief Executive Officer Steve Easterbrook told analysts that Chicken McNugget sales rose 10 percent two months after one clean-food announcement. The company had declared all its poultry was now free of antibiotics considered important for human medicine, reducing the chance of superbugs developing resistance to human antibiotics. By 2025, McDonald’s pledged, all its eggs would be from cage-free chickens.\n‘Progressive’ Burgers Easterbrook called the efforts long-term investments, key to transforming its image into “a modern, progressive burger company.”\nThe world’s largest restaurant company also said it plans to rid McNuggets of artificial preservatives; its buns, of high-fructose corn syrup. Last fall, in Germany, McDonald’s, in a limited-time experiment, sold its first-ever organic burgers.\nRead More: Organic Foods’ Premium Prices and Uncertain Benefits: QuickTake\nIn October, Papa John’s International Inc. said that it had nixed 14 “unwanted ingredients,” including caramel color, vanillin and maltodextrin, a white powder often used to thicken or preserve foods.\nTo spruce up its food, the pizza chain is spending $100 million a year, 6 percent of its annual revenue. Chief Ingredient Officer Sean Muldoon said the company wants to appeal to moms and millennials.\nHealth Flops Closely held Subway Restaurants, long known for its bleach-white baguettes, is selling a multi-grain flatbread. Earlier this year, it introduced rotisserie-style chicken raised without antibiotics\nThe industry’s previous health kicks have fizzled, however. McDonald’s has said its once heavily promoted salads make up just 2 to 3 percent of sales. Wendy’s Co., the burger chain, even ripped out its ill-fated salad bars in 2006.\nThese flops suggest fast-food diners may care little about healthier options, according to W. Douglas Evans, professor of prevention and community health at George Washington University.\n“Most of the people at McDonald’s aren’t there to get a salad,” Evans said. “It’s probably going to follow the same pattern.”\nFast-food companies are trying to compete with restaurants such as Panera Bread Co., which began selling antibiotic-free meat 13 years ago. Last year, sales at such “fast-casual” restaurant chains jumped 12 percent, compared with 4.4 percent for fast food, according to industry researcher Technomic.\nMcDonald’s and its ilk “don’t have a choice,” said Bill Chidley, co-founder and partner at ChangeUp, a brand consultant in Dayton, Ohio. “They have to respond in some way.\"\nBro Food Maybe not. Burger King is skipping the healthy claims. Instead, it is sticking with bro-friendly fare like the “Whopperito”: the ingredients of its flagship quarter-pound Whopper burger, plus queso sauce, rolled into a burrito.\nIn September, Burger King, owned by Oakville, Ontario-based Restaurant Brands International Inc., doubled down, introducing Cheetos-flavored chicken fries. Customers seem quite sated. Last year, Burger King’s same-store sales rose 5.4 percent, more than three times the increase at McDonald’s.\nThen, there’s the cost. This year, global food prices fell to a seven-year low. So chains can afford to experiment with pricier items – like antibiotic-free chicken -- but the trend could reverse.\nMichael Halen, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst, said restaurants may eventually be forced to raise prices or the more-expensive fare may cut into profit.\n“The customer’s got to pay for it,” Halen said. “How much will they accept?”\nConsider that, in Chicago, near McDonald’s headquarters in Oak Brook, Illinois, the company charges $4.99 for a chicken sandwich sans antibiotics, about the same as Burger King asks for their conventional version.\n‘Deceptive’ Marketing There’s also a dirty little secret about cleaner-sounding options. They often aren’t, according to Jessica Almy, deputy director of nutrition policy at the nonprofit Center for Science in the Public Interest. “Marketing can be deceptive,” she said.\nMcDonald’s “big breakfast” platter, which has real butter and preservative-free scrambled eggs and sausage, contains 750 calories. Panera’s antibiotic-free Chipotle Chicken Avocado Melt has 800 calories and about 80 percent of a day’s salt intake. Panera said its wholesome-sounding choices are more about dining pleasure.\n“We know clean food tastes better,” said Sara Burnett, director of wellness and food policy.\nConsider again Erica Kelley, the jewelry designer who avoided McDonald’s. For a recent weekday lunch, she picked Pret A Manger -- owned by the private equity firm Bridgepoint Capital and in which McDonald’s once held a 33 percent stake.\nPret sells antibiotic-free chicken, turkey and roast beef, as well as cage-free eggs. Its coffee is organic. Kelley bought an $8.49 roast beef and horseradish cream baguette. It may have been drug-free, but it packed 580 calories and half a day’s worth of sodium -- more than a Big Mac.",

      "text": "By Tom Victor Is McDonald's introducing delicious food everywhere aside from the UK just to spite us? It certainly feels like it. \nJapan has a katsu burger with cheese running through the middle, America has all-day breakfasts, and now Italy has a Nutella 'burger' on the menu. \nIt's called the 'Sweety con Nutella' and it looks like a burger bun stuffed until bursting with hazelnutty, chocolatey goodness. Lancement de Sweety en Italie. Une innovation gourmande issue d'une collaboration entre @McDonalds et @Nutella_Italia pic.twitter.com/sl6qFyCfeN \n— Paus' Marketing (@paus_marketing) November 11, 2016 \nNow, we're not saying you should all book yourselves on the next available flight to Italy just for this bastardized doughnut, but bear this in mind - freedom of movement across the European Union is not a long-term guarantee after the Brexit vote, and we can't promise that the supply of Sweety con Nutella will last forever. \nCan you make it at home? Maybe. Does it look and feel better to eat sickly-sweet food outside an Italian cafe with a top-quality espresso or cappuccino? We're not sure why we even need to ask the question. \nI mean, just look at James Richardson here. Would you get the same amount of cool in a flat in the UK? That's what we thought. “ @90sfootball : James Richardson presenting on Gazzetta Football Italia, 1995. pic.twitter.com/XH7mIAwQPT ” Sat mornings haven't been the same. \n— Rob C (@RobC081090) April 10, 2015 Advertisement \nOh, and it gets better. We've had a little look at the McDonald's Italy website, to see what other goodies you can get out there. \nThere's a sandwich with *pecorino* cheese instead of the...well we're not even sure what cheese you get in McDonald's sandwiches here. \nThere's something called the Crispy McBacon, which sounds like the name of an everyman hero in a sandwich-based children's movie. \nThere's only fucking tiramisu, you guys. \nOh, and the best part? You'll be in Italy, so you can do other stuff like get a really good pizza and not have to speak to the people in England who you hate. Folks abusing you in the street? You won't know because you don't even speak Italian. Ignorance is bliss. \nWe're just off to book those flights. See you in one Nutella-filled week. Read more about: ",

      "text": "McDonald’s soda is known for tasting better than soda from anywhere else! Didn’t you assume they just dumped extra sugar in it, even the Diet Coke? I mean, isn’t that McDonald’s answer to everything? Apparently not! Read on!\nMcDonald’s just gave the answer in The Sun as to WHY their soda tastes better than anyone else’s!!\nHere are their four reasons:\n1. They keep their machines, syrups, and soda water ice cold. Other places have their syrup and machines at room temperature, and their soda water isn’t quite that cold.\n2. They use special machines that are constantly re-circulating the soda water to keep it the perfect temperature and to make sure it has the exact right level of carbonation.\n3. They invest in expensive water filtration systems, so the water won’t have any aftertaste that could affect the soda.\n4. Finally, their giant, wide straws give you bigger sips so, quote, “the taste can hit all your taste buds.”\nHats off to McDonald’s for keeping it the same for years despite everyone else cutting costs to save a buck! Keep on keeping on, Mikki D’s!",

      "text": "McDonald's is suing Florence, Italy for preventing them from opening a restaurant 2:28 PM, Nov 10, 2016 15 mins ago Previous Next \nMcDonald’s is suing the city of Florence, Italy for more than $19 million after the city has denied the chain the right to build a restaurant in a historic plaza. \nIn June, Florence mayor Dario Nardella denied McDonald’s the right to build a restaurant in the Piazza del Duomo, near the city’s historic renaissance-style Cathedral. The BBC reports that the decision was upheld in July by a panel in charge of preserving the city’s history. \nBut McDonald’s says it has changed its plans to fit within the city’s guidelines, and claims it’s being discriminated against. It estimates that it will lose almost a million Euros a year for the next 18 years, and it wants Florence to pay up. \n\"We completely agree that the cultural and artistic heritage and the Italian historical town centres have to be protected and guaranteed, as well as the traditions and the historical small shops, but we cannot accept discriminatory regulations that damage the freedom of private initiative without being advantageous to anyone,\" McDonald’s said in a statement to the BBC. \n“We also have the right to say no,” Nardella told city council. \nThis isn’t the first time McDonald’s has had trouble opening a restaurant in Italy. Earlier this year, the Catholic church voiced its displeasure after the chain tried to open a restaurant just blocks away from the Vatican. \nAlex Hider is a writer for the E.W.

      "text": "4 hours ago Ms. Bea Haven : Admittedly I don't go to MCD's very often, but there are times when I just crave one of their fishwiches. We have a Long John Silver's closer to me, which everyone says has much better fish, but the perfect simplicity of nothing but a bun and fish just can't be beat. I used to like their quarter pounders with cheese, but anymore, the buns for that are always stale.I worked at a fast food place during the school term in high school, though not a national chain, and even back then there were all these horror stories about what not to order there, but everything was fresh. We'd make up a lot of burgers and fries around the major lunch, dinner, and bar-closing times, but not so much that they sat for more than 15 minutes. Chicken, fish, pizza, and onion rings were cooked to order. We did make chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry shakes in advance, but all the other flavors were made to order, and I know for a fact that everything was sanitized at the end of the day. On the other hand, I worked summers at the zoo and there's no way I would ever have eaten anything from their concession stand. All of the frozen meats were stored in the same freezer as animal carcasses awaiting necropsies and frozen mice and rats to feed to the birds of prey. Someone once found a fly mixed in with their ice cream, and neither the ice cream machine or the slushie machine was ever cleaned. I actually am not sure they even had a license to sell food. Thankfully, I fed the animals and not the people! I think that single-location private locations are much more likely to have true horror stories than large-chain franchises .Corporate will yank the franchise pretty quick for bad shiat.",

      "text": "CBS/AP  52 AM More cities pass soda taxes on sugary drinks \nA 32-ounce soda is filled at a McDonald’s in New York City. Mario Tama, Getty Images Stumble \nSAN FRANCISCO -- Voters in four U.S. cities approved or appeared likely to approve special taxes on sugary drinks, energizing advocates who say the victories are indicative of growing momentum for measures that discourage people from guzzling calories. \nThe penny-per-ounce taxes in three San Francisco Bay Area cities will apply to energy, sweetened tea and sports drinks, but not to diet sodas or naturally sweetened drinks. On Tuesday, measures in San Francisco and Oakland, California, captured about 60 percent of the vote, with approval higher in neighboring Albany. \nIn Boulder, Colorado, a 2-cent per ounce tax was headed toward victory, although ballots were still being counted on Wednesday. \n“This is a very strong message to the soda industry, and this will lead to the introduction of new proposals all across the country,” said Dr. John Maa, secretary of the San Francisco Medical Society. The Philadelphia city council is expected to vote Wednesday on a \"sugar tax\" on soft drinks. The mayor wants to add three cents an ounce to the p... \nThe four cities join Berkeley, California , which passed a penny-per-ounce tax on sugary drinks in 2014, and Philadelphia , which passed a similar tax this summer. The campaigns had financial backing from billionaire Michael Bloomberg, who tried unsuccessfully to limit the size of sugary drinks as mayor of New York. \nPhilanthropists Laura and John Arnold, who made his fortune as a hedge funder, also donated to the campaigns for sugary drink taxes. \nSusan Neely, president of the American Beverage Association, which represents Coke, Pepsi and others, has said the proposals are being pushed in places more likely to pass them. \nBefore Berkeley, dozens of similar efforts were defeated or failed to gain traction, in part because they were outmatched by well-financed campaigns by the beverage association. In a statement Wednesday, the industry group said it respects the decision of voters and that it remains focused on working with community and public health organizations to change behaviors. \nThe industry had said such taxes unfairly single out beverages for fueling obesity, and that grocers would be forced to raise prices on other items to cover the cost. The tax is levied on distributors, rather than on customers at the register. \nCoca-Cola Co., which also makes Sprite, Powerade and Fanta, said it believes there are better ways to encourage moderation in consumption of sugary beverages. The Atlanta-based company has touted its mini-cans of sodas as alternatives. PepsiCo Inc., based in Purchase, New York, said last month that it would work to have at least two-thirds of its global beverage volume have 100 calories or less from added sugars per serving by 2025. \nBloomberg Philanthropies said the soda taxes, now in six cities, will help reduce obesity and diabetes. \n“The tide has clearly turned on this issue, and momentum has swung in our favor,” said Howard Wolfson of Bloomberg Philanthropies in a statement. “I am confident in the months ahead more municipalities will seek to implement soda taxes to help their citizens, and we will be willing to help them as they do.” \nCBS San Francisco reports that in the year since the Berkeley tax took effect, there’s evidence that it has made a difference in residents’ habits. A study published in the American Journal of Public Health found that overall consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages declined 21 percent in Berkeley, even while it increased slightly in surrounding communities. \nThe survey of almost 3,000 low-income Berkeley residents found they drank 36 percent fewer sports drinks, 29 percent fewer energy drinks and 26 percent less regular soda. \nIn the Bay Area, spending by tax proponents and opponents of the measures was expected to top $50 million, fueled by heavy contributions from dueling interests. It was by far the costliest proposition in San Francisco history. \nA similar proposal in San Francisco failed in 2014 to get enough votes for a dedicated tax, which requires two-thirds approval. This year, backers went for a general tax, which requires a simple majority and doesn’t stipulate how the revenue is spent. © 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

      "text": "If you’ve ever had the fountain drinks at McDonald’s you can probably attest that they just taste better than most fountain drinks. If I am at a McDonald’s, I can’t help but sneak in a couple of sips of Coke (although I am truly a diet soda drinker, with Diet Pepsi being the favorite). The Coke on tap at McDonald’s just tastes SO GOOD. It’s sweet, cold, tasty and totally refreshing.\nBut what is it that makes the Coca-Cola at McDonald’s taste so darn good? McDonald’s has the answer to that question right on their website !\n1) It’s important to McDonald’s that they follow the guidelines set forth by Coca-Cola and work to ensure that the Coke you drink at McDonald’s tastes the same as it would if you were buying it bottled.\n2) Both the water AND the Coke syrup are pre-chilled before they hit the fountain dispensers with the precise ratio of syrup set to allow for the melting of the ice.\n3) The fountain system also remains constantly cold with proper filtration methods in place.\n4) It’s all about the straw! The McDonald’s straw is slightly wider than the average straw, which in turn allows for the Coke to hit ALL your tastebuds!\n ",

      "text": "- - Everyone knows the Big Mac is the signature sandwich of McDonald's . But not too many people know it has some mighty savory cousins. \nThis Monday, November 14, Miami will be introduced to the burger's family when the Mac Jr. and Grand Mac will launch. South Florida will be one of first regions to try these new offerings before the nationwide launch in early 2017. \nThe burgers in the Big Mac family include the Mac Jr.: a single-layer Big Mac that proffers a single, larger beef patty and forgoes the extra middle bun. The Grand Mac is made with two beef patties that are larger than those on the classic sandwich to total one-third pound of meat. Each burger includes lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, and the chain's special sauce. The seeded buns are baked daily at Turano Bakery in Orlando. The Big Mac, introduced in 1967, is the anchor of the collection. Related Stories Japanese McDonald's Introduces \"Miami Burger\" Which is Actually a Taco Burger \nMcDonald's corporate chef Mike Haracz worked on the new sandwiches with a team of other toques, along with McDonald's owner-operators, to give customers several riffs on the well-known sandwich. The fast-food megagiant is especially interested in tapping into the millennial market — many of whom have never experienced a Big Mac. \nHaracz, a magna cum laude graduate of Johnson & Wales University in Providence, Rhode Island, with an associate degree in culinary arts and a bachelor’s degree in culinary nutrition, describes the two new McDonld's offerings. \"The Grand Mac is a hearty, beef-forward experience, and with the Mac Jr., you get more of the sauce and cheese.\" \nHaracz also shares some insight into how long it takes for a giant restaurant company to introduce a new product. \"Depending on what the project is, it could take anywhere from six months to years to make sure it's correct and right. There have been instances that if something is not right, we have to make it right. We have test kitchens and a variety of chefs. We're always working together to come up with cool items.\" \nThe chef, who works out of McDonald's headquarters in Oak Brook, Illinois, says that even with chains such as Shake Shack and In and Out Burger, McDonald's is the standard-bearer of burgers for a reason. \"When people think of McDonald's, it brings them back to a delicious experience. There's so much history and consistency of flavor. Whether you go to California or Florida, you're eating the same burger every time. We can offer guests a familiar flavor. That's what keeps us great going forward — that and introducing fun new items.\" \nThe chef also explains how South Florida was chosen to get a first taste of the new Mac family. \"It depends on the product we're doing. If we're doing a fried chicken project, people down South are more passionate. We did a lot of work, and you guys in Miami are very passionate about what you like and dislike. Florida is upfront and honest.\" \nThe Mac family will be available at all South Florida McDonald's locations beginning Monday, November 14 (prices are not yet available). In addition, a Big Mac food truck will roam Miami at the end of November and early December (a schedule is being worked out); a kickoff at the Burger Beast Museum will take place with a grand-opening friends-and-family night Thursday, December 1. \nLet the world know what you think with the hashtag \"#MacTrio.\"",

      "text": "Nearly everywhere you look inside one Michigan McDonald's, there's an 18-year-old Curtis.\nLeith, Logan and Lucas Curtis work in the kitchen; Lauren Curtis is responsible for the front counter; and Lindsey Curtis handles the lobby and dining area of the restaurant where the quintuplets work in Potterville. Their mother calls the arrangement \"McCurtis.\"\nIt started about a year ago when boss Renee Draves asked Lucas Curtis a question she often poses to her younger workers: Did he and his co-worker/sister have any siblings looking for a job? She was floored by Lucas' answer.\n\"She wondered if we had any other siblings, and, funny enough, we did,\" Lucas said, smiling.\nLucas is the youngest of the quintuplets, born three minutes after older brother Leith. Lucas and his sister Lauren started working at the McDonald's last fall, and their three siblings followed suit earlier this year.\nLauren Curtis Mike Householder / AP Lauren Curtis waits on a customer at the front counter of a McDonald's in Potterville, Mich., in October. Curtis, 18, and her four siblings are non-identical quintuplets, all of whom work at the Lansing-area restaurant.\nLauren Curtis waits on a customer at the front counter of a McDonald's in Potterville, Mich., in October. Curtis, 18, and her four siblings are non-identical quintuplets, all of whom work at the Lansing-area restaurant.\n(Mike Householder / AP) Yet few customers are aware that the non-identical fivesome, who make up 11 percent of their senior class at Potterville High School, are related. They represent about half the restaurant's staff on a typical Sunday, but only recently has word spread about their unique relationship.\n\"Up until this point, nobody knew,\" said their father, Leith Curtis, a police officer in nearby Lansing who himself is a twin.\nLucas noted that he and his siblings get along well, so working together has been easy.\nDraves, who owns four McDonald's restaurants in the area, said she couldn't be happier.\n\"Being a quintuplet, they know teamwork probably better than anyone else,\" she said. \"To have quintuplets working collectively, all at the same time, I would go out on a limb and say we are the only McDonald's that's ever had quintuplets.\"\nPlus, Draves noted, she has a mathematical advantage.\n\"If I have a shift that I need covered, I can call their house, and it's a one-in-five shot that I'm going to get one of them in,\" she said.\nAssociated Press\n ",

It's this Nutella 'burger.'\n\nThe 'Sweety with Nutella' is basically a 'burger' made up of two of McDonald's signature buns stuffed with insane amounts of the hazelnut spread. \nMcDonald’s Italy announced the new arrival on Facebook yesterday. \"Get a soft sweetness which you cannot resist,\" the description reads. \"Try sweety with Nutella: soft bread with a heart of creamy sweet nutella!\"\nAnd unsurprisingly, people are pretty hyped to try this monstrosity. \"Ciao dieta,\" one user wrote, which you probably don't need translating. \nBut after revealing that it's an Italian exclusive (for now) it's been met with a fair amount of jealousy online.\n@JOEdotie @dornansscotsfan omg it's a burger for me !!!! this is my fav quote ?? i'm miss nutella as daniel said ! pic.twitter.com/XGcJTLSRGr \n— christelle (@lovelygreyeyes) November 11, 2016  \nWhy did I ever leave #Italy ?

But she still favors Peach & Green, a local cafe advertising \"all natural, locally sourced, wholesome food\" like steel-cut, dairy-free oatmeal.\n\"It's just a gimmick,\" Kelley said of offerings such as McDonald's antibiotic-free buttermilk crispy chicken sandwich. \"I still think it's gross.\"\nBig Food's biggest trend?

Just below are leaves and spices that Chipotle...\n(Tribune news services) Fast-food chains are shelling out millions to purge preservatives, artificial ingredients and other unmentionables. But they are learning that health nuts are tough to crack and other customers don't seem to mind that McDonald's special sauce may contain -- whatever. For their part, diet experts say the revamped items may not be all that good for you.\nIn October, McDonald's Chief Executive Officer Steve Easterbrook told analysts that Chicken McNugget sales rose 10 percent two months after one clean-food announcement. The company had declared all its poultry was now free of antibiotics considered important for human medicine, reducing the chance of superbugs developing resistance to human antibiotics. By 2025, McDonald's pledged, all its eggs would be from cage-free chickens.\nEasterbrook called the efforts long-term investments, key to transforming its image into \"a modern, progressive burger company.\"\nThe world's largest restaurant company also said it plans to rid McNuggets of artificial preservatives; its buns, of high-fructose corn syrup. Last fall, in Germany, McDonald's, in a limited-time experiment, sold its first-ever organic burgers.\nMcDonald's is moving to sustainable coffee in latest menu change Leslie Patton McDonald's Corp. plans to buy all of its coffee from sustainable sources by 2020, the latest salvo in a restaurant-industry battle for consumers who are increasingly concerned about the origins of their food.\nThe world's largest restaurant company is partnering with Conservation International,...\nMcDonald's Corp. plans to buy all of its coffee from sustainable sources by 2020, the latest salvo in a restaurant-industry battle for consumers who are increasingly concerned about the origins of their food.\nThe world's largest restaurant company is partnering with Conservation International,...\n(Leslie Patton) In October, Papa John's International Inc. said that it had nixed 14 \"unwanted ingredients,\" including caramel color, vanillin and maltodextrin, a white powder often used to thicken or preserve foods.\nTo spruce up its food, the pizza chain is spending $100 million a year, 6 percent of its annual revenue. Chief Ingredient Officer Sean Muldoon said the company wants to appeal to moms and millennials.\nClosely held Subway Restaurants, long known for its bleach-white baguettes, is selling a multi-grain flatbread. Earlier this year, it introduced rotisserie-style chicken raised without antibiotics\nThe industry's previous health kicks have fizzled, however. McDonald's has said its once heavily promoted salads make up just 2 to 3 percent of sales. Wendy's Co., the burger chain, even ripped out its ill-fated salad bars in 2006.\nThese flops suggest fast-food diners may care little about healthier options, according to W. Douglas Evans, professor of prevention and community health at George Washington University.\n\"Most of the people at McDonald's aren't there to get a salad,\" Evans said. \"It's probably going to follow the same pattern.\"\nFast-food companies are trying to compete with restaurants such as Panera Bread Co., which began selling antibiotic-free meat 13 years ago. Last year, sales at such \"fast-casual\" restaurant chains jumped 12 percent, compared with 4.4 percent for fast food, according to industry researcher Technomic.\nMcDonald's and its kind \"don't have a choice,\" said Bill Chidley, co-founder and partner at ChangeUp, a brand consultant in Dayton, Ohio. \"They have to respond in some way.\"\nMaybe not. Burger King is skipping the healthy claims. Instead, it is sticking with bro-friendly fare like the \"Whopperito\": the ingredients of its flagship quarter-pound Whopper burger, plus queso sauce, rolled into a burrito.\nWhich fast-food chains served the meat, held the antibiotics? Geoffrey Mohan Panera Bread and Chipotle Mexican Grill passed with flying colors, but KFC and Olive Garden were among the laggards in commitments to eliminate medically important antibiotics from their meat and poultry supply chains, according to a new report. Strong progress nonetheless was made across the top... Panera Bread and Chipotle Mexican Grill passed with flying colors, but KFC and Olive Garden were among the laggards in commitments to eliminate medically important antibiotics from their meat and poultry supply chains, according to a new report. Strong progress nonetheless was made across the top... (Geoffrey Mohan) In September, Burger King, owned by Oakville, Ontario-based Restaurant Brands International Inc., doubled down, introducing Cheetos-flavored chicken fries. Customers seem quite sated. Last year, Burger King's same-store sales rose 5.4 percent, more than three times the increase at McDonald's.\nThen, there's the cost. This year, global food prices fell to a seven-year low. So chains can afford to experiment with pricier items - like antibiotic-free chicken -- but the trend could reverse.\nMichael Halen, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst, said restaurants may eventually be forced to raise prices or the more-expensive fare may cut into profit.\n\"The customer's got to pay for it,\" Halen said. \"How much will they accept?\"\nConsider that, in Chicago, near McDonald's headquarters in Oak Brook, Illinois, the company charges $4.99 for a chicken sandwich sans antibiotics, about the same as Burger King asks for their conventional version.\nThere's also a dirty little secret about cleaner-sounding options: They often aren't, according to Jessica Almy, deputy director of nutrition policy at the nonprofit Center for Science in the Public Interest. \"Marketing can be deceptive,\" she said.\nMcDonald's \"big breakfast\" platter, which has real butter and preservative-free scrambled eggs and sausage, contains 750 calories. Panera's antibiotic-free Chipotle Chicken Avocado Melt has 800 calories and about 80 percent of a day's salt intake. Panera said its wholesome-sounding choices are more about dining pleasure.\n\"We know clean food tastes better,\" said Sara Burnett, director of wellness and food policy.\nConsider Kelley, the jewelry designer who avoided McDonald's. For a recent weekday lunch, she picked Pret A Manger -- owned by the private equity firm Bridgepoint Capital and in which McDonald's once held a 33 percent stake.\nPret sells antibiotic-free chicken, turkey and roast beef, as well as cage-free eggs. Its coffee is organic. Kelley bought an $8.49 roast beef and horseradish cream baguette. It may have been drug-free, but it packed 580 calories and half a day's worth of sodium -- more than a Big Mac.",

And for the first time, the world's largest burger chain has created a way for fans to find the popular sandwiches from their phones.\nMcDonald's new iMessage app, which one can bring up when texting between Apple devices, allows fans to find participating McDonald's restaurants in their area, and invite friends to a particular restaurant that serves them.\nThe McRib, which has a cult-like following, was once available in all U.S. stores during the limited time offers, but since 2012 has only been offered by the restaurant operators who ask for it. The sandwich's most ardent fans have since developed locater maps based on customer \"sightings.\" McDonald's has not sponsored a way to find the sandwiches until this year.\nWant fries with that kale?

Only about half of U.S. locations are expected to carry the McRib this year, according to McDonald's spokeswoman Terri Hickey.\nThe sandwich is expected to remain available until the end of December.\nMcDonald's has been investing heavily in digital offerings and its stand-alone phone application in an effort to draw in younger customers who tend to favor \"better burger\" rivals like Five Guys and Shake Shack. It has offered significant discounts and special offers since the app's launch in an effort to spur downloads and use, but it has fallen behind competitors that already offer mobile ordering and payment.\nMcDonald's said its app will offer order and pay capabilities in the U.S. starting early next year.\nsbomkamp@chicagotribune.com \nTwitter @SamWillTravel",

      "text": "AP November 11, 2016, 2:06 PM Michigan quintuplets work at same McDonald's restaurant \nLucas, Lauren, Lindsey, Leith and Logan Curtis, left to right, pose in the lobby of a McDonald’s in Potterville, Mich., Oct. 6, 2016. The 18-year-old non-identical quintuplets all work at the Lansing-area restaurant. AP Photo/Mike Householder Stumble \nPOTTERVILLE, Mich. -- Nearly everywhere you look inside one Michigan McDonald’s , there’s an 18-year-old Curtis. \nLeith, Logan and Lucas Curtis work in the kitchen; Lauren Curtis is responsible for the front counter; and Lindsey Curtis handles the lobby and dining area of the restaurant where the quintuplets work in Potterville. Their mother calls the arrangement “McCurtis.” \nIt started about a year ago when boss Renee Draves asked Lucas Curtis a question she often poses to her younger workers: Did he and his co-worker/sister have any siblings looking for a job? She was floored by Lucas’ answer. \n“She wondered if we had any other siblings, and, funny enough, we did,” Lucas said, smiling. \nLucas is the youngest of the quintuplets, born three minutes after older brother Leith. Lucas and his sister Lauren started working at the McDonald’s last fall, and their three siblings followed suit earlier this year. \nYet few customers are aware that the non-identical fivesome, who make up 11 percent of their senior class at Potterville High School, are related. They represent about half the restaurant’s staff on a typical Sunday, but only recently has word spread about their unique relationship. \n“Up until this point, nobody knew,” said their father, Leith Curtis, a police officer in nearby Lansing who himself is a twin. \nLucas noted that he and his siblings get along well, so working together has been easy. \nDraves, who owns four McDonald’s restaurants in the area, said she couldn’t be happier. \n“Being a quintuplet, they know teamwork probably better than anyone else,” she said. “To have quintuplets working collectively, all at the same time, I would go out on a limb and say we are the only McDonald’s that’s ever had quintuplets.” \nPlus, Draves noted, she has a mathematical advantage. \n“If I have a shift that I need covered, I can call their house, and it’s a one-in-five shot that I’m going to get one of them in,” she said. © 2016 The Associated Press.

      "text": "Fast-Food Chains Find Some Health Nuts Too Tough to Crack November 11, 2016 01:10 PM McDonald’s and rivals spend millions overhauling their menus © Farm Journal By Bloomberg \nOn her lunch break in Chicago’s Loop, Erica Kelley often strolls by McDonald’s, which beckons with some newer items straight out of a hipster cafe: antibiotic-free chicken, kale salads and whole-wheat muffins. \nThe 33-year-old jewelry designer, who has a passion for animal welfare, would seem a natural customer for the new, more eco-friendly Golden Arches. But she still favors Peach & Green, a local cafe that advertises “all natural, locally sourced, wholesome food” like steel-cut, dairy-free oatmeal. \n“It’s just a gimmick,” Kelley said of offerings such as McDonald’s antibiotic-free buttermilk crispy chicken sandwich. “I still think it’s gross.” \nFast-food chains are shelling out millions to purge preservatives, artificial ingredients and other unmentionables. But they are learning that health nuts are tough to crack and other customers don’t seem to mind that McDonald’s special sauce may contain -- whatever. For their part, diet experts say the revamped items may not be all that good for you. \nIn October, McDonald’s Corp. Chief Executive Officer Steve Easterbrook told analysts that Chicken McNugget sales rose 10 percent two months after one clean-food announcement. The company had declared all its poultry was now free of antibiotics considered important for human medicine, reducing the chance of superbugs developing resistance to human antibiotics. By 2025, McDonald’s pledged, all its eggs would be from cage-free chickens. ‘Progressive’ Burgers \nEasterbrook called the efforts long-term investments, key to transforming its image into “a modern, progressive burger company.” \nThe world’s largest restaurant company also said it plans to rid McNuggets of artificial preservatives; its buns, of high-fructose corn syrup. Last fall, in Germany, McDonald’s, in a limited-time experiment, sold its first-ever organic burgers. \nIn October, Papa John’s International Inc. said that it had nixed 14 “unwanted ingredients,” including caramel color, vanillin and maltodextrin, a white powder often used to thicken or preserve foods. \nTo spruce up its food, the pizza chain is spending $100 million a year, 6 percent of its annual revenue. Chief Ingredient Officer Sean Muldoon said the company wants to appeal to moms and millennials. Health Flops \nClosely held Subway Restaurants, long known for its bleach-white baguettes, is selling a multi-grain flatbread. Earlier this year, it introduced rotisserie-style chicken raised without antibiotics \nThe industry’s previous health kicks have fizzled, however. McDonald’s has said its once heavily promoted salads make up just 2 to 3 percent of sales. Wendy’s Co., the burger chain, even ripped out its ill-fated salad bars in 2006. \nThese flops suggest fast-food diners may care little about healthier options, according to W. Douglas Evans, professor of prevention and community health at George Washington University. \n“Most of the people at McDonald’s aren’t there to get a salad,” Evans said. “It’s probably going to follow the same pattern.” \n\nFast-casual restaurants are outpacing conventional fast food. \n© Bloomberg \nFast-food companies are trying to compete with restaurants such as Panera Bread Co., which began selling antibiotic-free meat 13 years ago. Last year, sales at such “fast-casual” restaurant chains jumped 12 percent, compared with 4.4 percent for fast food, according to industry researcher Technomic. \nMcDonald’s and its ilk “don’t have a choice,” said Bill Chidley, co-founder and partner at ChangeUp, a brand consultant in Dayton, Ohio. “They have to respond in some way.\" Bro Food \nMaybe not. Burger King is skipping the healthy claims. Instead, it is sticking with bro-friendly fare like the “Whopperito”: the ingredients of its flagship quarter-pound Whopper burger, plus queso sauce, rolled into a burrito. \nIn September, Burger King, owned by Oakville, Ontario-based Restaurant Brands International Inc., doubled down, introducing Cheetos-flavored chicken fries. Customers seem quite sated. Last year, Burger King’s same-store sales rose 5.4 percent, more than three times the increase at McDonald’s. \nThen, there’s the cost. This year, global food prices fell to a seven-year low. So chains can afford to experiment with pricier items – like antibiotic-free chicken -- but the trend could reverse. \nMichael Halen, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst, said restaurants may eventually be forced to raise prices or the more-expensive fare may cut into profit. \n“The customer’s got to pay for it,” Halen said. “How much will they accept?” \nConsider that, in Chicago, near McDonald’s headquarters in Oak Brook, Illinois, the company charges $4.99 for a chicken sandwich sans antibiotics, about the same as Burger King asks for their conventional version. ‘Deceptive’ Marketing \nThere’s also a dirty little secret about cleaner-sounding options. They often aren’t, according to Jessica Almy, deputy director of nutrition policy at the nonprofit Center for Science in the Public Interest. “Marketing can be deceptive,” she said. \nMcDonald’s “big breakfast” platter, which has real butter and preservative-free scrambled eggs and sausage, contains 750 calories. Panera’s antibiotic-free Chipotle Chicken Avocado Melt has 800 calories and about 80 percent of a day’s salt intake. Panera said its wholesome-sounding choices are more about dining pleasure. \n“We know clean food tastes better,” said Sara Burnett, director of wellness and food policy. \nConsider again Erica Kelley, the jewelry designer who avoided McDonald’s. For a recent weekday lunch, she picked Pret A Manger -- owned by the private equity firm Bridgepoint Capital and in which McDonald’s once held a 33 percent stake. \nPret sells antibiotic-free chicken, turkey and roast beef, as well as cage-free eggs. Its coffee is organic. Kelley bought an $8.49 roast beef and horseradish cream baguette. It may have been drug-free, but it packed 580 calories and half a day’s worth of sodium -- more than a Big Mac.",

      "text": "TORONTO — Look out, Mickey D’s: Burger King has ambitious plans for expansion in Canada.\nTwo years have passed since Burger King’s blockbuster takeover of Tim Hortons, and the fast food giant is now setting its sights on growing its own brand in Canada as it continues to take Tims international, said new Burger King Canada president Eric Hirschhorn.\n“We as a company are now ready to take advantage of (and) to fulfil the potential of what Canada could be for our business,” he said in an interview.\n“And certainly, now that we’re so entrenched in Canada with Tim Hortons, we have a much deeper understanding of how big and how important Canada can be for us,” said Burger King’s former chief marketing officer.\nBoth Tims and the burger chain have operated under the Restaurant Brands International banner — whose majority shareholder is Brazilian private equity firm 3G Capital Partners — since the $12.5-billion takeover deal was completed in December 2014.\nThough Burger King has just 281 locations in Canada, Hirschhorn said the company has the potential to be as big as McDonald’s is north of the border — where it’s the largest burger player by far with 1,400 restaurants.\n“It’s certainly not out of the question,” said Hirschhorn, who worked with Restaurant Brands’ chief executive Daniel Schwartz at 3G Capital Partners back when it acquired Burger King in 2010.\n“We’re pretty ambitious people and we’re not all that patient. Our goals and ambitions are very large. We believe this business can be as big as some of our peers,” he said.\nTo that end, Hirschhorn says he has set up a team to work on the expansion and focus on the business in Canada, though he stayed mum on exactly where and how fast the chain’s growth would happen.\nHe did say that a more modern store redesign similar to locations in the U.S. and in some Asian countries would roll out by the end of the year, and that Burger King will introduce more new products to the Canadian market like the Jalapeno Chicken Fries launched this week after runaway success in the U.S.\nThere’s no word yet on whether Burger King hotdogs or the burger-burrito mash-up known as the Whopperrito will also migrate north. But he said there are plans for more breakfast food items in a market virtually owned by McDonald’s, Tims and Starbucks due to their popular coffees.\nAfter five years learning all aspects of the burger business at the company’s Miami headquarters, Hirschhorn says he jumped at the chance to run the chain in Canada. After all, Restaurant Brands International is headquartered in Oakville.\n“It was a no-brainer for me. It’s a gem of a market, of a country, of a business opportunity,” he said.\nHe compared Canada to China, Russia, Brazil and India as “equally primed to take off and grow as a major market for us around the world.”\nAnd while he acknowledged stiff competition from bigger burger joints including A&W and Wendy’s, he said there’s still room for more.\n“People in Canada love fast food similarly, if not more, than people in the U.S. even,” Hirschhorn said, noting the demand for hamburgers has outpaced the growth overall in fast food in Canada.\n“We’re not fighting a headwind here,” he said.\nDoug Fisher, president of food consultancy FHG International in Toronto, doesn’t see it that way. “Burger King is not so Canadian. It’s not relevant except that it bought Tim Hortons,” he said.\n“There are much better quality products out there. Burger King is a second-rate player when compared to McDonald’s and A&W,” Fisher added.\nIndeed, as A&W and McDonald’s waded into the antibiotic-free meat market at a higher price point and self-serve kiosks, Burger King went after value-seeking customers with two-for-$5 sandwiches and 10 chicken nuggets for $1.99.\n“Their big innovation in the last year was hotdogs in the U.S. I don’t see anything great coming from them,” said Fisher.\nToronto Star",

Try Sweety with Nutella now: soft bread with a creamy, indulgent center!”\nI personally like to eat Nutella on toasted bread, but never on a hamburger bun, let alone TWO.\nDo you hope to see this “burger” in America?\n \n ",

      "title": "McDonald’s Just Released A New Nutella Burger And I’ve Honestly Never Been More Disgusted By Anything In My Life",
      "text": "  Favorite \nListen, I’m no snob when it comes to fast food. Starbucks knows who I am by my frequent mobile order, and I might as well apply at Chick-fil-A for the corporate discount. When the CFA line is too long, I’ve been known to swing through the McDonald’s drive-thru for some all-day breakfast sandwiches and those delicious, greasy fries that are completely worth breaking out over. With that said, there are a few places even I won’t touch when it comes to my fake, processed fast food order. Fish sandwiches get a pass, as well as any eggs that come in the shape of a square. However, there’s now one new item that you couldn’t pay me to touch with a ten-foot pole, and that’s the new Nutella burger at McDonald’s. \nNow available at McDonald’s Italy locations is the “Sweety con Nutella” which is literally just a giant wad of Nutella sandwiched between a hamburger bun, and no, I’m not kidding. If the photo of this menu item doesn’t turn your stomach, I’m honestly not sure what will. Eating a giant gob of Nutella by itself is bad enough, but spreading it on a hamburger bun so you can shovel it down faster? I’m not sure why they’re testing this in Italy instead of in the States because that’s probably one of the most American things I’ve ever heard. \nThe strangest part about all of this is that my repulsion is apparently not the most common response when told about the Nutella burger. McDonald’s Facebook post announcing its arrival has over 50,000 shares, and when I pitched this to the PGP writing staff, they all seemed unbelievably enthusiastic about it as well. While I could maybe see myself ordering this in a seriously drunk and/or hungover state, I doubt I’d ever willingly place this order in a state of fully functioning mental capacity. For now, I’ll be glad this isn’t a menu item at my disposal at the moment, but for my friends across the pond, pick one of these up the next time you want to consume 10000% of your daily fat in 30 seconds, and let us know how it goes, ok?",

      "text": "in Trending \nSometimes, when you really need it, the universe sends you a gift — and, if you’re lucky, that gift comes in the form of delicious carbs. \nCase in point: Today, McDonald’s announced that they will be releasing a new kind of burger at their Italian chains, called the “Sweety con Nutella.” And, before you start having heart palpitations, never fear: there’s no actual meat involved. \nIt’s literally just an inordinately large amount of Nutella sandwiched between two buns. \nWHAT COULD POSSIBLY BE WRONG WITH THIS?? (Aside from every single thing?) \nWhile there’s nothing terribly objectionable about the burger, I’m honestly not sure why you would pay actual money for this fast food menu item — like, do you not have bread and Nutella in your pantry at this exact moment? Are you so lazy that you refuse to spread some damn chocolate-hazelnut spread on two slices of bread? \nIt’s fine, I’m not trying to judge anybody … I’m just concerned about your spending habits. \nEither way, it’s sort of a moot point at the moment, since the burger is currently only available in Italy (though McDonald’s has not ruled out the possibility that the “Sweety con Nutella” could make its way overseas). \nWhile there have been some optimistically-curious reactions to the unusual culinary creation, many Twitter users are declaring the burger an abomination: \"McDonalds Italy launches Nutella burger\" \nI hate you too.",

      "text": "I seriously was having THIS EXACT conversation LAST NIGHT with Pauly… I know, we have really interesting conversations when we’re not on the air, but The Sun UK has finally figured out why soda is just better when you get it from McDonald’s. Pauly and I just assumed the reason was they dumped extra sugar in it, even the Diet Coke.\nBut it turns out that’s not it. McDonald’s just gave an answer of WHY their soda tastes better than anyone else’s.\nHere are their four reasons:\n1. They keep their machines, syrups, and soda water ice cold. Other places have their syrup and machines at room temperature, and their soda water isn’t quite that cold.\n2. They use special machines that are constantly re-circulating the soda water to keep it the perfect temperature . . . and to make sure it has the exact right level of carbonation.\n3. They invest in expensive water filtration systems, so the water won’t have any aftertaste that could affect the soda.\n4. And their giant, wide straws give you bigger sips so, quote, “the taste can hit all your taste buds.” That one sounds made up. But I’ll buy the other three.\n( The Sun ) ",

      "text": "1:50pm PT by Scott Feinberg Oscars: Michael Keaton Back in the Hunt for Under-the-Radar McDonald's Movie 'The Founder' Courtesy of The Weinstein Company Michael Keaton in 'The Founder' The Weinstein Co. movie about Ray Kroc, which shares a director with 'The Blind Side,' will receive an Oscar-qualifying run starting Dec. 16. \nOne could be forgiven for assuming that something must be wrong with John Lee Hancock 's The Founder . On paper, the Weinstein Co. film about the late McDonald's mastermind Ray Kroc sounded like Oscar bait, but its release date has bounced all over the calendar. The movie originally was set for Nov. 25. But then back in March, it was moved up to Aug. 4. \nSeveral months later, in July, it was pushed back to Dec. 16, for a limited awards-qualifying run, and Jan. 20 for a wide release. In the meantime, TWC was hit with box-office setbacks and staff departures, leading some to wonder if the Kroc film — in which Michael Keaton stars as the struggling salesman who became \"an overnight success\" at 52 — would ever see the light of day. \nWhile one could be forgiven for that assumption, one also would be sorely mistaken. I finally was shown The Founder this week — as were a number of other awards pundits and two audiences of SAG Awards nominating-committee members. That suggests the Weinstein Co. has confidence in the film's prospects, and I can report that it's not only not bad, but is so good that it may be a serious contender, after all. \nThat's largely because of Keaton. Coming off of his performances in 2014's Birdman and 2015's Spotlight , he gives a performance in the same league as the ones he gave in those films (he personally was nominated for the former but snubbed for the latter). He has plenty of screen time, too, appearing in every scene, and convincingly capturing the sheer force-of-will that propelled Kroc, so TWC should be able to make a strong case for him in what's looking like a weak year for the best actor Oscar. Indeed, if Keaton were to get nominated alongside the category's two presumptive frontrunners — Fences ' Denzel Washington , who already has two Oscar statuettes on his shelf, and Manchester by the Sea 's Casey Affleck , a young buck still early in his career — I would say all bets are off. \nThe Founder 's script, written by Robert D. Siegel , clearly was inspired by Kroc's 1977 bestselling McMemoir Grinding It Out , which I recently read. And the resulting film, like Hancock's 2009 film version of Michael Lewis ' The Blind Side , impeccably captures the tone and tenor of the source material. The RottenTomatoes.com rating of The Blind Side was an abysmal 66 percent, but the movie, which told an inspirational story about a plain-spoken underdog finding success, spoke to middle-America (like a recent presidential candidate you might recall), grossed more than $250 million domestically, was nominated for the best picture Oscar and garnered a lead acting Oscar (for Sandra Bullock ). \nThat same description also applies to The Founder , so TWC would be wise not to place all of its chips on Lion this season.",

      "text": "Kyle Schwarber defied expectations by playing in the World Series just seven months after tearing ligaments in his left knee, but he said he's still at least a month away from regaining full range of motion.\n\"It's going to be a lot of knee strengthening,\" the Cubs outfielder said Monday night. \"My knee is strong already. We got to get the quick movements down, cutting, obviously, the unexpected cutting, things like that. It usually takes like four weeks before you're going to be ready to go back to it. So I'm really looking forward to it.\"\nSchwarber's leadoff single in the 10th inning of Game 7 set the table for two runs that eventually earned the Cubs their first championship since 1908. Albert Almora Jr. replaced him as a pinch runner, but Schwarber said he wasn't in pain.\n\"No discomfort at all,\" he told Chicago Inc. \"You want to feel as good as possible. Obviously you know you're not there yet. Obviously there's still more work to go, but I felt really good overall.\"\nNow that Schwarber can concentrate on regaining flexibility in his knee, he has designs on playing left field and catcher next season. \"I still feel like I have things to offer at the catcher position,\" he said.\nEarlier in the night, he acknowledged he has some conditioning work ahead. \"No more eating late-night McDonald's. No more late-night Taco Bell. It's going to be a big process for me\" preparing for spring training .\nFour Cubs named as finalists for baseball writers' year-end awards Paul Sullivan Kris Bryant , Jon Lester , Kyle Hendricks and manager Joe Maddon are finalists for the Baseball Writers' Association of America's year-end awards, one year after the Cubs won three of the four National League categories.\nBryant is up for Most Valuable Player against Nationals second baseman Daniel...\nKris Bryant , Jon Lester , Kyle Hendricks and manager Joe Maddon are finalists for the Baseball Writers' Association of America's year-end awards, one year after the Cubs won three of the four National League categories.\nBryant is up for Most Valuable Player against Nationals second baseman Daniel...\n(Paul Sullivan) Own a page of Chicago history! Order back issues and newspaper reprints Open link Schwarber told an audience of Cubs fans at the Nike store on Michigan Avenue that he appreciated the encouragement from peers and fans throughout his rehabilitation but also has been able to commiserate with former Indiana University roommate Sam Travis, a Red Sox prospect who also tore his ACL this spring. \"That was a really good person to talk to when you're going through it all.\"\nSchwarber tackled a number of topics during his Nike appearance, fielding questions from the crowd and reporters. (And speaking of appearances, Schwarber's scheduled to visit \"Live with Kelly\" with Kelly Ripa and guest co-host Alex Rodriguez on Thursday).\nOn demands on his schedule\nThat is going to be a little bit difficult, but obviously the rehab's going to come first and you're going to try to work it into your schedule.\nOn fans' \"trust falls\" from light posts during the victory rally\nYou're an idiot. (Laughs). Like, what if someone drops you? I saw some people jumping from the bridge into the water.\nOn convincing Cubs President Theo Epstein he was healthy enough to play in the World Series\nI said, \"I'd really just like a chance to try to come back and help.\" That's all I could ask for. Deep down inside if you're a competitor ... if someone told you you could do something and you don't try it, wouldn't that kill you deep down inside?\nOn Jason Heyward 's speech to rally his teammates during the rain delay after the Indians tied Game 7 6-6\nThat was probably one of the best timing talks that we had. We got so many young guys on this team and a lot of first-time World Series experiences. And for him just to come up in his first World Series, to be a leader in that situation, was big. Because this guy works his butt off. He's my favorite teammate. He's a guy who I want to go in a foxhole with if I was in a fight.\nChicago celebrates the Chicago Cubs winning the World Series with a parade from Wrigley Field to Grant Park on Nov. 4, 2016.\nOn his pivotal 10th-inning single\nWhen I went up there I had the edge. It's like the \"Rocky\" movie. You know (Anthony) Rizzo with the \"Rocky\" stuff? You just have this edge: When you come up to the plate, \"I'm not going to get out,\" you just know you're not going to get out. Obviously I faced that (pitcher) plenty of times before, so I wanted to back off the plate. ... I made sure I was going to get the head (of the bat) to it. And then what do you know? I hit a hard hit. ... Then the rest is history: Albert with the great tag from first to second base on Kris' (Bryant) deep ball; (Ben) Zobrist with the double; Miggy (Montero) with the big hit to put the insurance run on. Unbelievable.\nOn whether the World Series trophy will \"travel\" like the Stanley Cup\nThis one's a little bit more important than the other ones. This is 108 years. This thing's going to be put away where we can't get to it unless there's multiple supervision with it.\nWhen he finally got home after celebrating the title\nI was drained and hung over, so I went to bed. We got in at 11 in the morning. I'm like, \"I'm done. I need to go to bed.\"\nOn his favorite memory from the postseason\nThe whole Game 7. Just that whole battle. Like I said, it's going to be a movie one day.\nWho would play Schwarber?\nWho's the guy who plays Champ Kind in \"Anchorman\"? (He asked the audience, trying to think of actor David Koechner .) ... What about Zach Galifianakis? There you go.\n Kyle Schwarber World Series Chicago Cubs Alex Rodriguez Jason Heyward Albert Almora David Koechner",

The translated Facebook post reads, “A soft sweetness has arrived that you will not be able to resist.

      "text": "ELECTION 2016: McDonald defeats Vecchi, re-elected Plymouth County Sheriff   3:21 PM Nov 11, 2016 at 3:21 PM Plymouth County Sheriff Joseph McDonald won a second six-year term in office Tuesday despite losing Brockton, the countys only city, in his first contested race since winning the office 12 years ago. Neal Simpson The Patriot Ledger @nsimpson_ledger \nPlymouth County Sheriff Joseph McDonald won a second six-year term in office Tuesday, Nov. 8 despite losing Brockton, the countys only city, in his first contested race since winning the office 12 years ago. \nMcDonald, a Republican from Kingston who has served as sheriff since 2004, defeated Plymouth police Sergeant and Democrat Scott Vecchi 56.6 percent to 43.4 percent, while losing Brockton by a margin of more than 26 percentage points. Vecchi, who was running his second campaign after losing a bid for Plymouth County commissioner, earned a total of 109,253 votes but failed to win a majority of votes in any town in the county except Hull. \nAt the end of the day, he had way more money than me and way more foot soldiers, said Vecchi, whose campaign spent less than $50,000 this year, compared to the more than $220,000 spent by McDonalds campaign. Considering the resources we had, the fact that we pulled in 109,000 votes I think was pretty impressive. \nMcDonald had highlighted what he described as 12 years of stability and progress in his office as he sought to find off the challenge from Vecchi, who had accused McDonald of failing to do enough to help inmates succeed after being released. The sheriffs office is primarily concerned with operating the county jail, though it also operates programs aimed at assisting local police departments. \nThe campaign leading up to Tuesdays election had become personal at times, with both sides accusing the other of negative campaigning and underhanded tactics. But on Wednesday morning, Vecchi said he had no ill will toward the sheriff. \nI wish Joe McDonald well, and hopefully some of things that I brought up in the campaign can change, said Vecchi, who also attributed his loss to a wave of Republican support in parts of Plymouth County for Republican presidential candidates Donald Trump. Some of the programs I proposed and some of the internal changes  maybe some of those will be adopted. \nMcDonald, who had not faced a serious challenge since he barely eked out a victory against incumbent Joseph F. McDonough by less than a percentage point in 2004, said the election results showed that voters were supportive of his work in the countys correctional system over the last 12 years. He said he thought the fact that he lost Brockton, a Democratic stronghold, had more to do with party politics that his record as sheriff. \nI certainly like to think that that people understand and appreciate what were up to, he said. It certainly doesnt mean its perfect  nothing ever is  and were going to strive in the next six years to be as forward thinking and innovative as we have been in the last 12. \nReach Neal Simpson at nsimpson@ledger.com.",

      "text": "ELECTION 2016: McDonald defeats Vecchi, re-elected Plymouth County Sheriff Friday Nov 11, 2016 at 3:21 PM Nov 11, 2016 at 3:21 PM Plymouth County Sheriff Joseph McDonald won a second six-year term in office Tuesday despite losing Brockton, the countys only city, in his first contested race since winning the office 12 years ago. Neal Simpson The Patriot Ledger @nsimpson_ledger \nPlymouth County Sheriff Joseph McDonald won a second six-year term in office Tuesday, Nov. 8 despite losing Brockton, the countys only city, in his first contested race since winning the office 12 years ago. \nMcDonald, a Republican from Kingston who has served as sheriff since 2004, defeated Plymouth police Sergeant and Democrat Scott Vecchi 56.6 percent to 43.4 percent, while losing Brockton by a margin of more than 26 percentage points. Vecchi, who was running his second campaign after losing a bid for Plymouth County commissioner, earned a total of 109,253 votes but failed to win a majority of votes in any town in the county except Hull. \nAt the end of the day, he had way more money than me and way more foot soldiers, said Vecchi, whose campaign spent less than $50,000 this year, compared to the more than $220,000 spent by McDonalds campaign. Considering the resources we had, the fact that we pulled in 109,000 votes I think was pretty impressive. \nMcDonald had highlighted what he described as 12 years of stability and progress in his office as he sought to find off the challenge from Vecchi, who had accused McDonald of failing to do enough to help inmates succeed after being released. The sheriffs office is primarily concerned with operating the county jail, though it also operates programs aimed at assisting local police departments. \nThe campaign leading up to Tuesdays election had become personal at times, with both sides accusing the other of negative campaigning and underhanded tactics. But on Wednesday morning, Vecchi said he had no ill will toward the sheriff. \nI wish Joe McDonald well, and hopefully some of things that I brought up in the campaign can change, said Vecchi, who also attributed his loss to a wave of Republican support in parts of Plymouth County for Republican presidential candidates Donald Trump. Some of the programs I proposed and some of the internal changes  maybe some of those will be adopted. \nMcDonald, who had not faced a serious challenge since he barely eked out a victory against incumbent Joseph F. McDonough by less than a percentage point in 2004, said the election results showed that voters were supportive of his work in the countys correctional system over the last 12 years. He said he thought the fact that he lost Brockton, a Democratic stronghold, had more to do with party politics that his record as sheriff. \nI certainly like to think that that people understand and appreciate what were up to, he said. It certainly doesnt mean its perfect  nothing ever is  and were going to strive in the next six years to be as forward thinking and innovative as we have been in the last 12. \nReach Neal Simpson at nsimpson@ledger.com.",

      "text": "\nThe Curtis quintuplets at work. AP \nNearly everywhere you look inside this McDonald's in Michigan, America, there's an 18-year-old Curtis. \nLeith, Logan and Lucas Curtis work in the kitchen; Lauren Curtis is responsible for the front counter; and Lindsey Curtis handles the lobby and dining area of the restaurant where the quintuplets work in Potterville. Their mother calls the arrangement \"McCurtis.\" \nIt started about a year ago when boss Renee Draves asked Lucas Curtis a question she often poses to her younger workers: Did he and his co-worker/sister have any siblings looking for a job? She was floored by Lucas' answer. \n\"She wondered if we had any other siblings, and, funny enough, we did,\" Lucas said, smiling. \nLucas is the youngest of the quintuplets, born three minutes after older brother Leith. Lucas and his sister Lauren started working at the McDonald's last fall, and their three siblings followed suit earlier this year. \nYet few customers are aware that the non-identical fivesome, who make up 11 percent of their senior class at Potterville High School, are related. They represent about half the restaurant's staff on a typical Sunday, but only recently has word spread about their unique relationship. \n\"Up until this point, nobody knew,\" said their father, Leith Curtis, a police officer in nearby Lansing who himself is a twin. \nLucas noted that he and his siblings get along well, so working together has been easy. \nDraves, who owns four McDonald's restaurants in the area, said she couldn't be happier. \n\"Being a quintuplet, they know teamwork probably better than anyone else,\" she said. \"To have quintuplets working collectively, all at the same time, I would go out on a limb and say we are the only McDonald's that's ever had quintuplets.\" \nPlus, Draves noted, she has a mathematical advantage. \"If I have a shift that I need covered, I can call their house, and it's a one-in-five shot that I'm going to get one of them in,\" she said. \n",

Neal Simpson The Patriot Ledger @nsimpson_ledger \nPlymouth County Sheriff Joseph McDonald won a second six-year term in office Tuesday, Nov. 8 despite losing Brockton, the countys only city, in his first contested race since winning the office 12 years ago. \nMcDonald, a Republican from Kingston who has served as sheriff since 2004, defeated Plymouth police Sergeant and Democrat Scott Vecchi 56.6 percent to 43.4 percent, while losing Brockton by a margin of more than 26 percentage points. Vecchi, who was running his second campaign after losing a bid for Plymouth County commissioner, earned a total of 109,253 votes but failed to win a majority of votes in any town in the county except Hull. \nAt the end of the day, he had way more money than me and way more foot soldiers, said Vecchi, whose campaign spent less than $50,000 this year, compared to the more than $220,000 spent by McDonalds campaign. Considering the resources we had, the fact that we pulled in 109,000 votes I think was pretty impressive. \nMcDonald had highlighted what he described as 12 years of stability and progress in his office as he sought to find off the challenge from Vecchi, who had accused McDonald of failing to do enough to help inmates succeed after being released. The sheriffs office is primarily concerned with operating the county jail, though it also operates programs aimed at assisting local police departments. \nThe campaign leading up to Tuesdays election had become personal at times, with both sides accusing the other of negative campaigning and underhanded tactics. But on Wednesday morning, Vecchi said he had no ill will toward the sheriff. \nI wish Joe McDonald well, and hopefully some of things that I brought up in the campaign can change, said Vecchi, who also attributed his loss to a wave of Republican support in parts of Plymouth County for Republican presidential candidates Donald Trump. Some of the programs I proposed and some of the internal changes  maybe some of those will be adopted. \nMcDonald, who had not faced a serious challenge since he barely eked out a victory against incumbent Joseph F. McDonough by less than a percentage point in 2004, said the election results showed that voters were supportive of his work in the countys correctional system over the last 12 years. He said he thought the fact that he lost Brockton, a Democratic stronghold, had more to do with party politics that his record as sheriff. \nI certainly like to think that that people understand and appreciate what were up to, he said. It certainly doesnt mean its perfect  nothing ever is  and were going to strive in the next six years to be as forward thinking and innovative as we have been in the last 12. \nReach Neal Simpson at nsimpson@ledger.com.",

It's called the Sweet con Nutella. \nNow before you get excited, no, it's not available in the U.S. You can only get it at McCafés in Italy. And no, it's not made with beef. It's just a generous schmear of Nutella between two buns. Image: McDonald's \nI know what you're thinking right now. I can make that! We have the technology. I could go to McDonald's and order a hamburger without the beef. \n\"Welcome to McDonald's. May I take your order?\" \n\"Yes, I'd like a regular hamburger. But with nothing in it. No beef or toppings.\" \n\"... Ssso, just the buns?\" \n\"That's $1.29. Please pull up to the window.\" \n\"Wait! Make that five regular hamburgers with nothing in them.\" \nI mean, you're just having one? Please. Have it your way. Sweetie. \nBefore you go, check out our slideshow below. Image: SheKnows",

      "text": "ELECTION 2016: McDonald defeats Vecchi, re-elected Plymouth County Sheriff   3:21 PM Nov 11, 2016 at 3:21 PM Plymouth County Sheriff Joseph McDonald won a second six-year term in office Tuesday despite losing Brockton, the countys only city, in his first contested race since winning the office 12 years ago. Neal Simpson The Patriot Ledger @nsimpson_ledger \nPlymouth County Sheriff Joseph McDonald won a second six-year term in office Tuesday, Nov. 8 despite losing Brockton, the countys only city, in his first contested race since winning the office 12 years ago. \nMcDonald, a Republican from Kingston who has served as sheriff since 2004, defeated Plymouth police Sergeant and Democrat Scott Vecchi 56.6 percent to 43.4 percent, while losing Brockton by a margin of more than 26 percentage points. Vecchi, who was running his second campaign after losing a bid for Plymouth County commissioner, earned a total of 109,253 votes but failed to win a majority of votes in any town in the county except Hull. \nAt the end of the day, he had way more money than me and way more foot soldiers, said Vecchi, whose campaign spent less than $50,000 this year, compared to the more than $220,000 spent by McDonalds campaign. Considering the resources we had, the fact that we pulled in 109,000 votes I think was pretty impressive. \nMcDonald had highlighted what he described as 12 years of stability and progress in his office as he sought to find off the challenge from Vecchi, who had accused McDonald of failing to do enough to help inmates succeed after being released. The sheriffs office is primarily concerned with operating the county jail, though it also operates programs aimed at assisting local police departments. \nThe campaign leading up to Tuesdays election had become personal at times, with both sides accusing the other of negative campaigning and underhanded tactics. But on Wednesday morning, Vecchi said he had no ill will toward the sheriff. \nI wish Joe McDonald well, and hopefully some of things that I brought up in the campaign can change, said Vecchi, who also attributed his loss to a wave of Republican support in parts of Plymouth County for Republican presidential candidates Donald Trump. Some of the programs I proposed and some of the internal changes  maybe some of those will be adopted. \nMcDonald, who had not faced a serious challenge since he barely eked out a victory against incumbent Joseph F. McDonough by less than a percentage point in 2004, said the election results showed that voters were supportive of his work in the countys correctional system over the last 12 years. He said he thought the fact that he lost Brockton, a Democratic stronghold, had more to do with party politics that his record as sheriff. \nI certainly like to think that that people understand and appreciate what were up to, he said. It certainly doesnt mean its perfect  nothing ever is  and were going to strive in the next six years to be as forward thinking and innovative as we have been in the last 12. \nReach Neal Simpson at nsimpson@ledger.com.",

It is just hamburger buns and Nutella (from what I can tell). Which is a meal I already eat... Might as well try the McDonald's version!

      "text": "Farah Harith | November 12, 2016 McDonald's launches a local breakfast promotion with 'cakoi' while their counterparts in Italy inject Nutella into their menu. Pic credit McDonald’s Malaysia \nPETALING JAYA: For the longest time, global fast food chains have always injected local flavours into their menu based on countries. \nWe’ve seen Kentucky Fried Chicken do it when they added our staple food rice into their menu. You can also get nasi lemak for breakfast at A&W, while Pizza Hut localised their menu with their sambal pizzas. \nMcDonald’s has done it many times, ranging from their Mata Kucing sundae to the all-time favourite bubur ayam. \nNow it’s infusing another much-loved local favourite into their breakfast menu. \nWould you ever have thought you could order ‘cakoi’ at McDonald’s one day? \nThat day has come. Crispy cakoi, or deep-fried dough, is now available from 4am to 11am every day, with a choice of three dips: chocolate, strawberry or kaya. \nMcDonald’s fans and netizens have taken to Facebook to share their thoughts on this localisation attempt, being promoted as Cuba-Cuba Cakoi. \nFacebook user EeQuin Chow felt disappointed, tagging a photograph of cakoi with phrases such as ‘overrated’ and ‘so expensive and not worth it’. \nAnother user Angeline Yee however said that it was not the taste that mattered, but the memories. \n“Thank you McDonald’s for the new breakfast set of Cakoi – one of our favorite traditional ways to enjoy our breakfast. It is not the taste that matters but the memories that come into your mind while having the breakfast! I’m loving it,” she said. \nIn Italy, however, something different entirely is being served – a taste of heaven, according to some comments. Pic credit Facebook McDonald’s Italia \nIt’s a Nutella burger called ‘Sweety con Nutella’ or “soft bread with a creamy, indulgent centre!” \nThe announcement on McDonald’s Italia’s Facebook page has now garnered more than 72,000 shares. \nPerhaps we could start petitioning to McDonald’s Malaysia to introduce the Nutella Burger here as well. But for now, make a breakfast date tomorrow morning and load up on some cakoi.",

      "text": "a A Font Size \nFAYETTEVILLE -- A Bentonville McDonald's franchisee has settled a lawsuit filed by a man who claimed he was fired because he has HIV. \nMathews Management and the affiliated company Peach Orchard Inc. agreed to pay the unidentified man $103,000, clarify its policies about employees' health and make other changes, according to a consent decree accepted by both sides and filed in federal court Wednesday. \nThe companies specifically deny any wrongdoing and maintain they are fair to employees, the decree states. Instead they agreed to the decree \"to avoid the disruption, costs, delay and expense of litigation.\" \nThe lawsuit filed in July accused the companies of firing the man after learning his HIV status and of requiring employees in general to divulge their prescription medications. \nBoth would violate the federal Americans with Disabilities Act, according to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which filed the lawsuit on the former employee's behalf. \nThe Americans with Disabilities Act prohibits employers and companies providing services to the public from discriminating against people because of physical or mental impairments, including conditions such as HIV, a disease that weakens the immune system. The law protects employees who can perform their jobs with \"reasonable accommodation\" that isn't an \"undue hardship\" on the employer. \nMathews Management oversees about three dozen McDonald's locations in and around Benton and Washington counties. \nIt and Peach Orchard are both led by Bill and Walter Mathews, according to Arkansas secretary of state records. \nThe former employee worked at a register and the drive-thru and cleaned and helped open and close the McDonald's restaurant just west of Interstate 49 for several months starting in late 2014. \nIn February 2015, the restaurant's general manager asked the man if he was in a relationship with another employee, according to the lawsuit. \nThe employee revealed he was HIV-positive and claimed the manager then said the employee's HIV status meant he had to be let go. \nThe companies immediately denied the claims, and in September court filings said the man didn't fall under the federal disabilities protection for a variety of reasons. \nIn this week's decree, the companies agreed to revise the medication-reporting policy to remove any \"ambiguities,\" according to the decree. \nThey also agreed to provide education and training on the disabilities act to all employees and to provide a neutral job reference for the former employee, including only his dates of employment and job title. \n\"We're happy with the results,\" said Josh Bailey, the former employee's attorney, adding that all attorneys involved acted professionally. \nThe employment commission and attorney for Mathews Management didn't return phone messages requesting comment Thursday afternoon. \nMetro on 11/12/2016 Print Headline: McDonald's owners, ex-worker settle suit on HIV for $103,000 ADVERTISEMENT",

      "text": "Hollis Johnson \nEgg, cheese, and bacon or sausage: the classic breakfast sandwich.\nIt's ubiquitous, yet the simple breakfast sandwich enjoys eternal popularity.\nAnd with breakfast habits changing , breakfast sandwiches on-the-go have become all the more popular. \nBut of all the national chains, who makes the classic sandwich best?\nI tried the egg, cheese, and meat iterations from three major fast-food chains — Burger King, McDonald's, and Wendy's — to see which one comes out on top.\nThe Big Three all serve some version of the sandwich; at first glance the only difference seems to be the bread. Hollis Johnson \n\nLet's dive into Burger King's Supreme breakfast sandwich. It's a breakfast limousine wreck of two eggs, two sausages, and two servings of bacon topped with cheese and served in a \"toasted hoagie bun\" which appears to be crushed in a car compactor before serving. Hollis Johnson \nSource: Burger King \n\n\nIf this is a toasted hoagie bun, I don't know what a hoagie is. It's an elongated hamburger bun with all the sogginess and disappointment that buns are heir to — a bun to be wished away. The sickly yellow egg is gelatinous and tastes of complete nothingness. With fast-food sausage and bacon all in one sandwich, the entire thing comes off as incredibly salty. I didn't finish this one. Hollis Johnson \n\nSee the rest of the story at Business Insider ",

By Michael Harthorne , Newser Staff Posted Nov 12, 2016 11:53 AM CST 12 comments Comments (AP Photo/Alan Diaz) (AP Photo/Alan Diaz) (Newser) – McDonald's is currently fighting for its right to serve Big Macs near two Italian landmarks, but the Telegraph reports that 10 countries have already won their burger battle against Mickey D's. A sampling: Bermuda: The island prohibits non-local fast-food restaurants, though there was a McDonald's on a US Naval Air Station there for 10 years. Iran: The only Iranian McDonald's shut down after the 1979 revolution. There is, however, a knock-off restaurant called Mash Donald's. Iceland: McDonald's left after the financial crash. The final McDonald's burger served in Iceland is preserved in a glass case for some reason. North Korea: Obviously. But North Korean rulers may be smuggling McDonald's in from South Korea. Jamaica: Every McDonald's location in the country closed on Oct. 14, 2005, due in part to a lack of investment. Barbados: The only McDonald's in the country closed after a year. Residents apparently aren't big beef fans. Ghana: The country inexplicably has no McDonald's location despite having a KFC.",

Mr. Willie has been preparing food at this location for over 20 years. \nLast week, the staff and management gathered at the store to celebrate Calhoun’s 73rd birthday, and to acknowledge his long career with the company. Maj Andalibi and Mary Portalatin, the store’s husband-and-wife owners, have worked with ­­­Mr. Willie since they bought the restaurant 16 years ago, and they say he’s one of their most reliable employees. \n“His responsibility is cooking anything there is to be cooked. He does everything,” said Andalibi. READ RELATED STORY: Burger King Proposes to McDonalds … in the Name of Peace From (L): Mr. Willie with store owner Maj Andalibi.

He’s a wonderful guy. He’s got a great attitude back there, a wonderful sense of humor. We’d be working, and we would have heavy business up front … it’s incredible how he can do the work, be cheerful at the same time, and sort of get everybody around him in a good mood. He just puts his heart and soul in everything he does.” Celebrating Mr. Willie’s 73rd Birthday and 59 years of service. Photo: Karla Ibarra \nCalhoun says he enjoys working at McDonald’s, and appreciates the owners and management for never telling him that he’s too old to continue working. “This is a very special day for me,” he said during the celebration. \nGenie Sanders, another long-time McDonald’s employee at various locations, worked alongside Willie for nearly 30 years. She once teased that he had been at the restaurant far too long. \nHe joked, “Well I guess I’ve been here so long, I’ll just die here.” \nWatch:",

      "text": "November 12, 2016 , 7:45 PM Attention, Nutella lovers! Those wanting to take their hazelnut-and-chocolate devotion to the next level should hightail it to Italy. On Thursday, Italian McDonald's debuted the Nutella burger, which it's calling the \"Sweety con Nutella.\" Describing it as \"soft bread with a creamy, indulgent center,\" the meatless wonder will be exclusively offered at McCafé locations in Italy. Mi dispiace, Americans. But will Italians be lovin' it? Since Nutella-filled brioche is already a staple on Italian breakfast tables, the fast-food version could very well be a hit. Nutella fans short on travel funds can taste test a \"Sweety\" without leaving home. PopSugar'sNutella burger recipe looks even tastier than Mickey D's confection, consisting of little more than Nutella, donuts, and fruit. Whether DIY or drive-through, this fake burger might be the dessert sandwich we never knew we've been waiting for. Advertisement",

This ungodly creation has entered the worlds via McDonald's Italia, which recently announced the news on Facebook. \n\"A soft sweetness has arrived that you will not be able to resist,\" the brand wrote. \"Try Sweety with Nutella now: soft bread with a creamy, indulgent center!\" \nTo be fair, based on the photo, this basically just looks like Nutella on bread. Nutella on bread is good, because Nutella on pretty much anything is good. Anything, that is, except hamburgers.

      "text": "On her lunch break in Chicago's Loop, Erica Kelley often strolls by McDonald's, which beckons with some newer items straight out of a hipster cafe: antibiotic-free chicken, kale salads and whole-wheat muffins.\nKelley, 33, a jewelry designer with a passion for animal welfare, would seem a natural customer for the new, more eco-friendly Golden Arches. But she still favors Peach & Green, a local cafe advertising \"all natural, locally sourced, wholesome food\" like steel-cut, dairy-free oatmeal.\n\"It's just a gimmick,\" Kelley said of offerings such as McDonald's antibiotic-free buttermilk crispy chicken sandwich. \"I still think it's gross.\"\nFast-food chains are shelling out millions to purge preservatives, artificial ingredients and other unmentionables. But they are learning that health nuts are tough to crack and other customers don't seem to mind that McDonald's special sauce may contain -- whatever. For their part, diet experts say the revamped items may not be all that good for you.\nVIDEOS TOP JOBS In October, McDonald's Chief Executive Officer Steve Easterbrook told analysts that Chicken McNugget sales rose 10 percent two months after one clean-food announcement. The company had declared all its poultry was now free of antibiotics considered important for human medicine, reducing the chance of superbugs developing resistance to human antibiotics. By 2025, McDonald's pledged, all its eggs would be from cage-free chickens.\nEasterbrook called the efforts long-term investments, key to transforming its image into \"a modern, progressive burger company.\"\nThe world's largest restaurant company also said it plans to rid McNuggets of artificial preservatives; its buns, of high-fructose corn syrup. Last fall, in Germany, McDonald's, in a limited-time experiment, sold its first-ever organic burgers.\nIn October, Papa John's International Inc. said that it had nixed 14 \"unwanted ingredients,\" including caramel color, vanillin and maltodextrin, a white powder often used to thicken or preserve foods.\nTo spruce up its food, the pizza chain is spending $100 million a year, 6 percent of its annual revenue. Chief Ingredient Officer Sean Muldoon said the company wants to appeal to moms and millennials.\nClosely held Subway Restaurants, long known for its bleach-white baguettes, is selling a multi-grain flatbread. Earlier this year, it introduced rotisserie-style chicken raised without antibiotics\nThe industry's previous health kicks have fizzled, however. McDonald's has said its once heavily promoted salads make up just 2 to 3 percent of sales. Wendy's Co., the burger chain, even ripped out its ill-fated salad bars in 2006.\nThese flops suggest fast-food diners may care little about healthier options, according to W. Douglas Evans, professor of prevention and community health at George Washington University.\n\"Most of the people at McDonald's aren't there to get a salad,\" Evans said. \"It's probably going to follow the same pattern.\"\nFast-food companies are trying to compete with restaurants such as Panera Bread Co., which began selling antibiotic-free meat 13 years ago. Last year, sales at such \"fast-casual\" restaurant chains jumped 12 percent, compared with 4.4 percent for fast food, according to industry researcher Technomic.\nMcDonald's and its kind \"don't have a choice,\" said Bill Chidley, co-founder and partner at ChangeUp, a brand consultant in Dayton, Ohio. \"They have to respond in some way.\"\nMaybe not. Burger King is skipping the healthy claims. Instead, it is sticking with bro-friendly fare like the \"Whopperito\": the ingredients of its flagship quarter-pound Whopper burger, plus queso sauce, rolled into a burrito.\nIn September, Burger King, owned by Oakville, Ontario-based Restaurant Brands International Inc., doubled down, introducing Cheetos-flavored chicken fries. Customers seem quite sated. Last year, Burger King's same-store sales rose 5.4 percent, more than three times the increase at McDonald's.\nThen, there's the cost. This year, global food prices fell to a seven-year low. So chains can afford to experiment with pricier items - like antibiotic-free chicken -- but the trend could reverse. » Next page...

      "text": "ELECTION 2016: McDonald defeats Vecchi, re-elected Plymouth County Sheriff Friday Nov 11, 2016 at 3:21 PM Nov 11, 2016 at 3:21 PM Plymouth County Sheriff Joseph McDonald won a second six-year term in office Tuesday despite losing Brockton, the countys only city, in his first contested race since winning the office 12 years ago. Neal Simpson The Patriot Ledger @nsimpson_ledger \nPlymouth County Sheriff Joseph McDonald won a second six-year term in office Tuesday, Nov. 8 despite losing Brockton, the countys only city, in his first contested race since winning the office 12 years ago. \nMcDonald, a Republican from Kingston who has served as sheriff since 2004, defeated Plymouth police Sergeant and Democrat Scott Vecchi 56.6 percent to 43.4 percent, while losing Brockton by a margin of more than 26 percentage points. Vecchi, who was running his second campaign after losing a bid for Plymouth County commissioner, earned a total of 109,253 votes but failed to win a majority of votes in any town in the county except Hull. \nAt the end of the day, he had way more money than me and way more foot soldiers, said Vecchi, whose campaign spent less than $50,000 this year, compared to the more than $220,000 spent by McDonalds campaign. Considering the resources we had, the fact that we pulled in 109,000 votes I think was pretty impressive. \nMcDonald had highlighted what he described as 12 years of stability and progress in his office as he sought to find off the challenge from Vecchi, who had accused McDonald of failing to do enough to help inmates succeed after being released. The sheriffs office is primarily concerned with operating the county jail, though it also operates programs aimed at assisting local police departments. \nThe campaign leading up to Tuesdays election had become personal at times, with both sides accusing the other of negative campaigning and underhanded tactics. But on Wednesday morning, Vecchi said he had no ill will toward the sheriff. \nI wish Joe McDonald well, and hopefully some of things that I brought up in the campaign can change, said Vecchi, who also attributed his loss to a wave of Republican support in parts of Plymouth County for Republican presidential candidates Donald Trump. Some of the programs I proposed and some of the internal changes  maybe some of those will be adopted. \nMcDonald, who had not faced a serious challenge since he barely eked out a victory against incumbent Joseph F. McDonough by less than a percentage point in 2004, said the election results showed that voters were supportive of his work in the countys correctional system over the last 12 years. He said he thought the fact that he lost Brockton, a Democratic stronghold, had more to do with party politics that his record as sheriff. \nI certainly like to think that that people understand and appreciate what were up to, he said. It certainly doesnt mean its perfect  nothing ever is  and were going to strive in the next six years to be as forward thinking and innovative as we have been in the last 12. \nReach Neal Simpson at nsimpson@ledger.com.",

      "text": "McDonald\nThe Mac Tonight spawning laboratory that is McDonald’s has gotten into a nice groove of experimentation of late. New menu ideas , new dining approaches and new techniques for getting customers not to look at hardcore sex while eating McNuggets . Tweaking and tinkering has become the new norm for wherever on the globe the Golden Arches happen to be standing and now the Italian branch of this clown farm is diving deep into the world of spread decadence.\nAccording to Brand Eating ( by way of Eater ), Italy’s McDonald’s locations carry the curious menu item that is the Nutella burger. Presented as a dessert option, the “Sweety con Nutella” is a pretty straightforward offering. It’s a bun, Nutella and the way of the ancients. There’s no meat in the bun which is (presumably) good news for vegetarians down to gorge and who’s going to tell on you if you sneak a beef party in your McDonald’s treat? Grimace? He’s not the boss of you!\nThis Instagram video nestled below should serve as a worthwhile visual aid and Katy Perry ‘s “Firework” playing the background adds to the big reveal drama.\n\nWould you scarf down a Nutella burger or twelve? Give your verdict in the comments. Or say it into a bullhorn. You’re empowered to make your own novelty burger discussion choices.\n(Via Brand Eating & Eater )\n",

Try Sweety with Nutella now: soft bread with a creamy, indulgent center!” \nThe product hasn’t been released in North America, but who’s to say it won’t make its way here. \nThe post has received more than 53,000 shares, 53,000 likes and 47,000 comments.

Instead, it's a hearty helping of hazelnut spread sandwiched between two glistening buns. Sweet!\nSEE ALSO: Eat your election feelings with this Golden Gaytime ice cream burger \n\nFor now, the treat is only available in Italy. But if you want to create your own, just put some Nutella between some buns. Delicious, no?.\n\nBONUS: When the office snacks run out and things get desperate",
