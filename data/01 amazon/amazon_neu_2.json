      "text": "(Before It's News) 1888PressRelease – FBA China Sourcing is a full service sourcing company for Amazon FBA sellers, based in Hong Kong. We have 25 years of hands-on experience in China-based manufacturing, specializing in custom-made electronics and accessories for the health, fitness and weight loss industries. Sourcing in China can be challenging for many Amazon FBA sellers, but with us as your professional sourcing specialist, it won’t be. We understand the business of being an Amazon seller, leaving the client free to focus on marketing & finding new best-selling products. Our FBA Sourcing service allows the client to sit back and let us do all the work from finding manufacturers to delivering the product directly to the chosen Amazon warehouse. We take care of everything; from sample management to packing, labelling, certification, to the final shipment. Once the client has decided on a product and approved the sample, we will negotiate to get the very best price. We approach multiple suppliers of the same product to ensure the best quality and price. If the client has an existing supplier or a preferred supplier, we can enter into negotiations with them on its behalf to lower the MOQ and price. We personally carry out Dupro inspections on all products. We also arrange for third party final random inspections. Using certified inspection services means that the final product matches the approved samples and that all of the FBA-specific requirements are met. Shipment can be made to the client or directly to Amazon US/UK/CE fulfilment centres: Whether ex-factory, FOB or a full door to Amazon Fulfilment Centres Service is required, we have the expertise, using sea freight, air freight or couriers. For shipment to the Amazon warehouses we need to be provided with the Amazon shipping labels PDF. Through our freight forwarders we can also advise on the most suitable duty rates applicable to the destination country. http://www.fbachinasourcing.com",

      "title": "How to ensure you never miss a bargain at Amazon",
      "text": "1 comment 1407 Views \nAmazon is a great place to buy LEGO, often at a reduced price. However, the best reductions are often short-lived, not always easy to find at Amazon itself, and may not necessarily be at your local Amazon site. \nSo, we have provided a number of features here at Brickset to help you identify the best prices and to ensure you never miss a bargain. \nRead on to find out about our RSS and Twitter feeds, the Buy pages and the Amazon price comparator. \nAt the heart of all our tools is the Amazon API which provides a programmatic method to gather information about items for sale at Amazon. Every few hours we use it to get prices from seven Amazon sites: USA, Canada, UK, France, Germany, Spain and Italy. \nBy comparing prices with those obtained earlier in the day we can identify new price reductions and by comparing them to retail prices we can identify percentage discounts. Looking for a bargain? \nWhen we find new reductions of over 25% below RRP, several things occur: A 'Discounts at Amazon.xxx' news article is posted. It lists the latest over 25% reductions and also all of this year's sets that are reduced by 33% or more. By default, articles pertaining to your local Amazon will be shown to you. If you want to see others you can add them (see the tutorial How to change your news preferences ). The RSS feed is updated. There's a RSS feed for each of the seven Amazon sites. The entire text of the article is posted into the appropriate one. Here's a list of the feeds . We'll post a tweet. If the new discount is at a UK/European Amazon we'll tweet it from @BargainwatchEU ; if it's from USA/Canada, from @BargainwatchNA . The tweets contain the top discounts a link to the full list of them. If you prefer, the same information can can be received via RSS: see the bottom of the RSS feed list . Looking for something that isn't discounted? \nIf you're looking to find out how much a set is at Amazon that doesn't appear in the discounts lists you will find it in three places: In the Buy listings . These lists show everything that's available at a particular Amazon, and can be sorted and filtered. You'll find a link to the one for you local Amazon in the green Buy menu, and for other countries below. In the Amazon price comparator . This powerful tool shows you, at a glance, the prices of sets at every Amazon. It highlights the cheapest and deepest discounts. It packs in a lot of information so be sure to read the notes at the top of the page so you get the most out of it. On set details pages . Click on the Buy tab at the bottom to see prices of the set at each Amazon site. Handy links",

Amazon's 'Good Girls Revolt' explores workplace sexism By YvonneVillarreal Los Angeles Times (TNS) 10 hrs ago Amazon Studios photo \nAnna Camp plays Jane Hollander in 'Good Girls Revolt' on Amazon Prime. \n\"Good Girls Revolt,\" a late '60s-set newsroom drama on Amazon Prime, shows that a woman's place in creating the first draft of history was as a \"researcher\" - doing most of the grunt work (and serving the coffee, to boot) while the male reporters got all the credit. \nBut early in Season 1, which is now available, an edifying question is asked that spurs a group of young women to buck tradition and demand equal standing in journalism. \n\"Is that the role that you want - being of service to men?\" \nThe query is posed by a young Eleanor Holmes Norton, the real-life and still-living luminary of the American Civil Liberties Union (played by Joy Bryant) at an informal gathering of women. \nThe period drama, created by Dana Calvo (\"Narcos\"), is inspired by Lynn Povich's 2012 book, \"The Good Girls Revolt: How the Women of Newsweek Sued their Bosses and Changed the Workplace.\" For the show, Newsweek is changed to the fictional News of the Week. \nThe series brings Calvo back to her roots. Before becoming a screenwriter, the New Jersey native got her start as a journalist, including a stint as a reporter for the Los Angeles Times. \nWe spoke to Calvo about the new series, the inevitable \"Mad Men\" comparison, and why men can appreciate the show too. \nQ: When did you first come upon Povich's book? Did you immediately feel a yearning to adapt it into something bigger? \nA: I spent 11 years all over the country, and I was very passionate about being a newspaper writer. I never heard of this lawsuit. And here I am going around Hollywood in my second career trying to get a show off the ground about journalism. And I was always met with the same response from Hollywood executives, which is: \"We love journalists, and we love the vibe of the newsroom, but journalism shows don't work because their reporting is reactive, they're not heroic.\" And I would always say, \"Well, no, good reporters don't just wait for the phone to ring.\" And so it was never an easy sell. \nBut then an executive I know at Sony, who knew I was a former reporter, knows that I always liked to write strong women leads. I was running the room at \"Narcos\" for Netflix two summers ago, and I got an email from him. He said, \"You know, we have the rights to this book, and I just feel like this is something that you might really like.\" And I read the press coverage on it, and I was so excited about it but also pretty embarrassed that I never heard of it. \nQ: How was it to return to your newsroom roots? \nA: I'm a reporter, so I do like research. I did research on the part I just ordered to fix my dryer. I'm just a nerd about that stuff. And I'm always convinced that someone is going to try to rip me off. You know that reporter instinct, like, I'm going to get the story behind this. So, yeah, I did research, but I have to say biographies are my favorite thing to read. I've read so many biographies of great journalists and great nonfiction events as told by great journalists. And then Lynn Povich's book - the show is inspired by Lynn's book not based on it. The characters are fictitious and the events are fictitious. \nWe could be nerd reporters and be absolutely just strict about getting things right. And what I also wanted to get right - and I'm sure you can relate to this - was that you can have the best story of your career and without a doubt you're walking out the door and some grumpy editor will say, \"You've got to come in tomorrow and do it all over again.\" So your victory lasts about a moment. \nQ: Most write-ups of \"Good Girls Revolt\" compare it to \"Mad Men\" because it's a period drama and also because \"Mad Men,\" too, explored gender dynamics to some degree. But for your show, it really is the focus. \nA: Right. I loved \"Mad Men,\" and I think Matthew Weiner is a visionary and he's a genius and he did for this period drama what no one had really done before. \"Mad Men\" was from the point of view of a man, and if you shift that gaze (to a woman's perspective) and move through a similar period a little later, it's just a whole different story. \nQ: Did working on the show get you thinking about sexism you faced in your own career? \nA: Yeah, and as weird as it sounds, in doing the show and articulating my vision in calls to executives and explaining it, I feel like here I am 46, and I finally found my voice. I didn't think anyone was asking Matthew Weiner to defend his vision as much as sometimes the women in charge were asked to explain or defend theirs. TRENDING VIDEOS",

      "text": "Will the Internet of Things be bigger than the Industrial Revolution? \nThis story was delivered to BI Intelligence IoT Briefing subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here . \nAmazon is increasingly positioning its popular Echo product line to be utilized throughout the home, rather than simply in one central location. \nTwo recent moves reinforce this market strategy by the online retail giant: The Echo Dot is now available in a three-pack bundle, giving buyers a $20 discount off the retail price. Upon releasing the revamped Echo Dot earlier this year, the company announced the Dot would be available in six- and twelve-pack bundles for slight discounts, so this falls in line with these earlier offerings. The company will be discounting the original Echo and the Dot as a centerpiece of its Black Friday sales, according to Mashable . The original device will have its price lowered from $179.99 to $139.99, while the Dot will be priced at $39.99 for the day, down from $49.99. The discount of the Echos will begin November 20 , several days before Black Friday . The company likely hopes to allow consumers to use their newly purchased Echo devices to increase their spending in the holiday season. \nAmazon is lowering the price of these products in part to incentivize consumers to place Echos around their home. When Amazon first released the Echo in 2014, the company positioned it as a portable device that could be transported throughout the home. Without a built-in battery, however, it seems consumers haven't adapted to this usage model. Now, though, it appears that the company is trying to leverage the revamped Dot to encourage Echo users to integrate the Alexa voice assistant that powers the devices throughout the home. \nThe retail giant is counting on its Echo Spatial Perception (ESP) to allow these duplicate devices to coexist. The ESP system allows multiple Echo devices to be in contact with one another, so that when a user starts talking to the device, the nearest Echo unit activates and responds, rather than multiple units reacting simultaneously. With this technology in place, Amazon can move to take advantage of it through Echo Dot multipacks. \nBI Intelligence expects that companies will follow Amazon’s lead, eventually offering voice control as a platform within the smart home space. The popularity of the Echo prompted Alphabet to release the Google Home earlier this year, while Samsung and Apple are also reportedly working on competing devices. Apple, through its recent revamp of HomeKit, already offers voice control throughout the home, though it's through its mobile devices rather than through a speaker. While voice control throughout the home will not likely represent a huge monetization opportunity for Amazon in itself, it gives the company a way to enhance its existing revenue streams, namely selling goods. \nThe U.S. smart home market has yet to truly take off. At its current state, we believe the smart home market is stuck in the 'chasm' of the technology adoption curve, in which it is struggling to surpass the early-adopter phase and move to the mass-market phase of adoption. \nThere are many barriers preventing mass-market smart home adoption: high device prices, limited consumer demand and long device replacement cycles. However, the largest barrier is the technological fragmentation of the smart home ecosystem, in which consumers need multiple networking devices, apps and more to build and run their smart home. \nJohn Greenough, senior research analyst for BI Intelligence , Business Insider's premium research service, has compiled a detailed report on the U.S. smart home market that analyzes current consumer demand for the smart home and barriers to widespread adoption. It also analyzes and determines areas of growth and ways to overcome barriers. \nHere are some key takeaways from the report: Smart home devices are becoming more prevalent throughout the US. We define a smart home device as any stand-alone object found in the home that is connected to the internet, can be either monitored or controlled from a remote location, and has a noncomputing primary function. Multiple smart home devices within a single home form the basis of a smart home ecosystem. Currently, the US smart home market as a whole is in the \"chasm\" of the tech adoption curve. The chasm is the crucial stage between the early-adopter phase and the mass-market phase, in which manufacturers need to prove a need for their devices. High prices, coupled with limited consumer demand and long device replacement cycles, are three of the four top barriers preventing the smart home market from moving from the early-adopter stage to the mass-market stage. For example, mass-market consumers will likely wait until their device is broken to replace it. Then they will compare a nonconnected and connected product to see if the benefits make up for the price differential. The largest barrier is technological fragmentation within the connected home ecosystem. Currently, there are many networks, standards, and devices being used to connect the smart home, creating interoperability problems and making it confusing for the consumer to set up and control multiple devices. Until interoperability is solved, consumers will have difficulty choosing smart home devices and systems. \"Closed ecosystems\" are the short-term solution to technological fragmentation. Closed ecosystems are composed of devices that are compatible with each other and which can be controlled through a single point. \nIn full, the report: Analyzes the demand of US consumers, based off of survey results Forecasts out smart home device growth until 2020 Determines the current leaders in the market Explains how the connected home ecosystem works Examines how Apple and Google will play a major role in the development of the smart home Some of the companies mentioned in this report include Apple, Google, Nest, August, ADT, Comcast, AT&T, Time Warner Cable, Lowe's, and Honeywell. \nTo get your copy of this invaluable guide, choose one of these options: Subscribe to an ALL-ACCESS Membership with BI Intelligence and gain immediate access to this report AND over 100 other expertly researched deep-dive reports, subscriptions to all of our daily newsletters, and much more. >> START A MEMBERSHIP Purchase the report and download it immediately from our research store. >> BUY THE REPORT \nThe choice is yours.

In comparison, Dow Jones hit a record intraday of 18,873.6 in the same period . \n(Trump on Bezos and Amazon, Screenshot from GeekWire ) \nAfter being engaged in some tough blows and being called out by now President-elect Donald Trump in the months leading to the election, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos congratulated Trump on his triumph . \n(Jeff Bezos on Trump, screenshot from TheVerge ) \nAmazon reported losses in both fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2014 operations, which may have allowed it not to report taxes. GuruFocus data revealed the company paid a 12% tax rate, on average, for the past five years. Without the 2014 tax rate outlier, Amazon paid a tax rate of 52.76%. \nMarket performance \nAmazon has been widely observed as the future of ecommerce business and has surpassed several traditional brick-and-mortar stalwarts because of its promising business outlook . \nIn the past five years, Amazon had a total return of 27.7% while the broader Standard & Poor 500 index returned 13.78% (1). Year to date Amazon returned 9.34% while the index provided 7.9%. \nValuations \nAmazon had a trailing 12-month price-earnings (P/E) ratio of 169 times (industry median: 21), price-book (P/B) value multiple of 20 times (industry median: 1.6) and price-sales (P/S) ratio of 2.78 times (industry median: 0.7) (2). \nThe tech company did not provide any dividends or perform any buybacks recently, except for $960 million and $277 million buybacks in fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011 (1). \nEarnings performance \nOn Oct. 27, the $351 billion ecommerce giant delivered its third quarter and nine months fiscal 2016 results. Three quarters into the year, Amazon delivered 29.5% sales growth to $92.2 billion and a whopping 1,322% profit growth to $1.6 billion. These figures are well above Amazon’s five-year historical growth figures of 25.6% and -12.35% (1). \nAmazon’s shares closed up 0.3% the following Monday while the broader market index closed up 0.52%. \n“Alexa may be Amazon’s most loved invention yet — literally — with over 250,000 marriage proposals from customers and counting. And she’s just getting better. Because Alexa’s brain is in the cloud, we can easily and continuously add to her capabilities and make her more useful — wait until you see some of the surprises the team is working on now.”– Jeff Bezos, founder and CEO of Amazon. \nVideo: Alexa vs. Google Home by Wall Street Journal \nAmazon \nThe ecommerce giant was founded in 1995 and is seeking to be the world’s most customer-centric company, as per filing. The company has three reportable segments: North America, International and Amazon Web Services (AWS). \n(Sales per segment, annual and quarterly filings) \nNorth America segment \nAccording to Amazon, its North America segment consists primarily of amounts earned from retail sales of consumer products (including from sellers) and subscriptions through North America-focused websites such as www.amazon.com, www.amazon.ca and www.amazon.com.mx. The segment includes export sales from these websites. \nIn fiscal 2015, the North America segment contributed 60% to total sales of $107 billion while growing at a 25% pace and delivering a 4.3% operating margin — highest in the past three years. \nNine months into the year, the segment delivered 26.9% sales growth to $53.5 billion and a 2.9% operating margin. \nInternational segment \nThe International segment consists primarily of amounts earned from retail sales of consumer products (including from sellers) and subscriptions through internationally focused websites such as www.amazon.com.au, www.amazon.com.br, www.amazon.cn, www.amazon.fr, www.amazon.de, www.amazon.in, www.amazon.it, www.amazon.co.jp, www.amazon.nl, www.amazon.es, and www.amazon.co.uk (3). \nThe segment includes export sales from these internationally focused websites (including export sales from these sites to customers in the U.S., Mexico and Canada) but excludes export sales from Amazon’s North American websites. \nIn fiscal 2015, the International segment contributed 33% to overall sales, while growing 6% and having a -0.3% margin. Observably, the segment contributed less to overall sales in fiscal 2015 compared to 40.2% in fiscal 2013. \nThree quarters into this year, the segment grew 27.3% and delivered a -2.7% operating margin. \nAWS segment \nThe AWS segment consists of amounts earned from global sales of compute, storage, database and other AWS service offerings for startups, enterprises, government agencies, and academic institutions (3). \nThe AWS segment contributed 7.4% to overall fiscal 2015 sales, while growing an amazing 70% and delivering a 23.6% operating margin — highest among the three segments. \nThree quarters into 2016, AWS segment grew by 58.6% and had a 25.1% operating margin. \nCash, debt and cash flow \nUnaudited statements as of Sept. 30 indicated that Amazon had $18.3 billion in cash and $8.2 billion in long-term debt with debt-equity of 0.46. The tech giant also had 5.4% of $70.9 billion assets in goodwill with a book value of $17.8 billion. \nCash flow \n(Cash flow, quarterly filing (4)) \nIn a one-year time frame ending in September, Amazon’s cash flow operations demonstrated a remarkable 48.7% growth to $14.6 billion brought by its outstanding profit growth rate. Capital expenditure allocation reached $6.04 billion compared to $4.4 billion last year, leaving the company with $8.56 billion in free cash flow. \nAmazon also reduced its debt by $1.2 billion and allocated another $3.58 billion in capital lease obligations. \n(Cash flow, annual filing (4)) \nNine months into 2016, Amazon allocated $271 million in debt repayments, compared to $1.665 billion last year. Meanwhile, the company allocated $2.9 billion in capital lease obligations. \nConclusion \nAmazon demonstrated an outstanding and ever-growing business segments. Observably, its AWS business has been growing so fast that the segment can probably overtake the company’s International segment in five- or six-year time. \nIn a recent survey , Amazon Web Services is further believed to grow and maintain its dominance in the cloud service. This is promising as Amazon achieved good margins in the segment in recent years. \n(Google Finance) \nA month ago, Goldman Sachs ( NYSE:GS ) and Credit Suisse ( NYSE:CS ) ranked Amazon shares as a buy and outperform, with a same price target of $1,050. Using its jagged five-year historical earnings multiple and a five-year growth rate gave me a value of $887 per share. \nNeglecting what the traditional valuations indicated (that Amazon is widely overpriced), Amazon would be a speculative buy at a target price of $900 per share. \nNotes",

      "text": "He Made 21,078% Buying Amazon. Heres His New Pick \nFor any investor looking to give his portfolio a boost from a dividend stock, a decent dividend yield is likely a requirement. Fortunately, Apple's stock's dividend yield, or annual dividend payments as a percentage of the stock price, has moved higher in the past 30 days thanks to the stock's 10% pullback during this time. \nContinue Reading Below \nAAPL data by YCharts . \nToday, Apple's dividend yield is about 2.1%, a meaningful jump from a 1.9% dividend yield just one month ago. Dividend growth potential \nWhile some investors may gloss over Apple's 2.1% dividend yield, which is about in line with the average dividend yield of stocks in the S&P 500, it starts to get interesting when investors look at the dividend's growth potential. \nThe prospects for Apple's dividend growth are evident both by the dividend's recent growth history and a look at the cash flow supporting the tech giant's dividend payments. \nApple's recent annual dividend increases, along with management's admission that it plans to continue to increase the dividend every year, highlight a rapid growth trajectory for dividend payouts. Since 2012, for instance, Apple's quarterly dividend payments have increased by about 51%, or a compound annual growth rate of 10.8%. Further, Apple's most recent dividend increases remain robust, with 10.6% and 9.6% hikes in 2015 and 2016, respectively. \nAAPL Dividend data by YCharts . \nAnd perhaps making an even stronger case for Apple dividend's growth potential is the company's strong free cash flow. In the trailing 12 months, Apple generated an incredible $52.3 billion in free cash flow, yet paid out only $12.2 billion in dividends. Clearly, the company has plenty of room to maintain its annual dividend hikes. \nAnother way to look at Apple's room for further dividend increases is with the payout ratio, or dividend payments as a percentage of earnings. Apple's payout ratio is just 24.8%. For comparison, dividend stocks McDonald 's, IBM , and Microsoft have payout ratios of about 67%, 44%, and 69%, respectively. An undervalued stock \nFinally, one of the best reasons to buy this dividend investment is that the stock is arguably undervalued. Trading at about 13 times earnings, Apple stock looks considerably cheaper than the average P/E ratio of companies in the S&P 500 of approximately 24. \nSure, Apple's earnings per share is down 10% in the trailing 12 months, suggesting there may be some merit to a conservative valuation. But with the tech giant's pricing power intact and customers as loyal as ever, Apple is likely to return to EPS growth over the long haul, making today's low P/E multiple irrational. \nInvestors who buy Apple stock today get a meaningful dividend, dividend growth, and a low-risk stock. Opportunities like this don't surface every day. \nForget the 2016 Election: 10 stocks we like better than Apple Donald Trump was just elected president, and volatility is up. But here's why you should ignore the election: \nInvesting geniuses Tom and David Gardner have spent a long time beating the market no matter who's in the White House.

      "text": "share this \nTurns out that Amazon may not always be cheaper (for buyers or sellers). \nResearch out from 360pi reveals that Google Shopping offered a lower price than Amazon on a sample of Amazon’s own Best Sellers 59% of the time relative to Amazon proper and 58% relative to Amazon marketplace sellers. In fact, Amazon was found to out-price Google Shopping only 25% of the time on the sampled assortment. This is based on 360pi’s price comparison of 750 Amazon self-reported Best Seller products to the same items advertised on Google Shopping across numerous categories, as sampled October 13, 2016*. SUBSCRIBE to Website Magazine & Accelerate 'Net Success \nThe e-commerce industry is very vocal about claiming marketplaces are the next retail battleground. Google Shopping is in effect one big marketplace and 96.5% of Amazon’s assortment is offered by their marketplace sellers. The size and breadth of Amazon’s marketplace community is arguably one of the giant’s biggest competitive weapons and with 84% of shoppers anticipated to start their shopping on Amazon this holiday, the window for other retailers to catch up is closing fast. Walmart knows this and just spent $3.3 billion US to acquire Jet.com, largely for its marketplace. And, it would seem with Google Shopping’s price aggressive position against Amazon’s own Best Sellers that Google is staking its own claim for retail dominance. \n“When someone wants to research something they start on Google, when they want to buy something they start on Amazon. Google knows this and needs Google Shopping to succeed – as much from an opportunity as a threat perspective,” said Jenn Markey, VP Marketing, 360pi. “With endless opportunities for product placement in its core search business, Google is upping the ante with aggressive pricing on Google Shopping and hoping shoppers take notice.”",

One that jumped out at us was a Pioneer 7.2-channel receiver marked down to $450 from its $700 list price. Log in or register to post comments Displays",

      "text": "He Made 21,078% Buying Amazon. Heres His New Pick \nThe Blue Oval's smallest crossover SUV has been a staple of its lineup in Europe, South America, and Asia for a few years now. Now the EcoSport, which shares some of its underpinnings with the subcompact Fiesta, will make its U.S. debut in L.A. \nThe U.S. version of the EcoSport may get a new face, but it's otherwise expected to be similar to the European version, shown. Image source: Ford Motor Company. \nContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT A new global Jeep to replace two current models \nFCA gave us a preview of the all-new 2017 Jeep Compass in September, including the photos you see below (and not much else). FCA hasn't shared a lot of details yet, but we know that the Compass will replace both the current Compass and its brawnier (but similarly sized) sibling, the Jeep Patriot, when it arrives in the U.S. early next year. It's expected that FCA will build the all-new Compass in Mexico . \nThe all-new 2017 Jeep Compass will replace Jeep's current Compass and Patriot models.

Toyota gears up to take on Honda's HR-V \nToyota is jumping into the small-crossover fray with its all-new C-HR, a model that was originally planned for the discontinued Scion brand. The C-HR is built on the highly flexible Toyota New Global Architecture that also underpins the new-for-2016 Prius. \nIn U.S. trim, the C-HR is expected to come with Toyota's mainstay 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine. \nToyota showed off the all-new C-HR crossover at the Paris Motor Show in October. The U.S. version is expected to be similar. Image source: Toyota. Something brand-new: A big Subaru \nFuji Heavy Industries ' (NASDAQOTH: FUJHY) quirky-but-beloved Subaru brand is expected to launch a \"three-row\" 7-passenger crossover SUV in L.A. This new Subaru will replace the Tribeca, a model that never quite caught on with brand loyalists. Being a Subaru, standard all-wheel drive is a safe bet, as is a choice between the brand's mainstay 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine and its larger 3.6-liter six-cylinder engine. Will Volkswagen bring a new electric car to Los Angeles? \nVolkswagen (NASDAQOTH: VLKAY) took the wraps off its overhauled Golf lineup in Germany earlier this month. But it didn't show an expected battery-electric version of the compact hatchback, leading your humble Fool (among others) to speculate that VW was saving its electric Golf for the L.A. show. \nAlong with (maybe!) the battery-operated Golf, VW will surely show off its new 2018 Atlas crossover . The Atlas was designed specifically for the U.S. market as a direct competitor to rivals like Toyota's Highlander and Ford's Explorer. \nThe all-new 2018 VolkswagenAtlas. Image source: Volkswagen. \nThe Atlas will be built at VW's factory in Chattanooga, Tennessee, starting next spring. \nForget the 2016 Election: 10 stocks we like better than Ford Donald Trump was just elected president, and volatility is up. But here's why you should ignore the election: \nInvesting geniuses Tom and David Gardner have spent a long time beating the market no matter who's in the White House.

(Don't Waste Your Money) - \nIf you want to save money on household products, the best way to do that for years was to join a warehouse club like Sam's Club or Costco. \nBut is it still worth the membership fee? Or has Amazon Prime, with its free shipping, made warehouse clubs as quaint as your old landline phone? \nWe decided to put all three retailers to the test. \nShoppers have their favorites \nFrankie Brinkman, while loading her car outside Costco in Springdale, Ohio, said she won’t buy household items anywhere else. \n\"I am total Costco, love Costco,\" the mom said. \nBut Lauren Geers and her young children prefer Sam’s Club for its house brands, saying \"we buy the Member’s Mark paper towels, toilet paper, diapers and formula.\" \nThen there’s busy mom Ellen Glasgow of Milford, who gets everything she needs, with free shipping, from Amazon Prime. \n\"It’s been a blessing, there’s nothing you can’t order,\" Glasgow said. \nHer smartphone has replaced her car when it comes to shopping for detergent and diapers. \n\"A quick two minutes, I’m set and it’s going to be in my mailbox or at my door the next day,\" she said. \nWarehouse clubs fight back \nWarehouse stores know you can get crock pots, clothing and paper towels easily online these days. So they are fighting back with products that are not so easy to get with a click of the mouse, such as discount tires, installed while you wait. \nDon’t need tires? Then what about prescription drugs? Or hearing aids? Or eyeglasses? \nConsumer Reports Magazine says Sam’s Club and Costco's prices on those services are lower than most other chains. Their pharmacies have come in tops in several recent surveys by the magazine, with only online pharmacies offering lower prices. \nBut what if you just want household goods? \nWe turned to one of the top shopping bloggers in the country, the Krazy Coupon Lady, Joanie Demer. \nDemer, her partner Heather Wheeler and her team recently compared prices on 170 popular items at Costco, Sam's and Amazon. They used Amazon's \"Subscribe and Save\" program, that gives an additional five percent discount on products you order every month. \nSo the survey's winners? Costco came in first place, with the lowest prices overall. \n\"We found much to our surprise that Costco is still twelve percent less in the cost of the items than Amazon Subscribe and Save,\" Demer said. \nSam's Club was in second place, with prices 5 percent higher than Costco in their 170 item comparison. \nBut Demer warns that Costco’s relatively high $55 membership fee (compared with Sam's) means you need to shop more to see those savings. \n\"To make the Costco membership worthwhile you need to spend $600 or more per year to break even,\" she said. \nAmazon Prime was the most expensive in her test (12 percent higher than Sam's and 7 percent higher than Costco) even with free shipping, and the extra discount offered by Subscribe and Save. Plus, it has a $99 annual fee, higher than either warehouse store. \nHowever, with the extra discount provided by Amazon's \"Subscribe and Save\" program, Demer says diapers can actually be cheaper than the warehouse clubs. So she says new moms should consider it. \nPrice isn't everything \nDemer says there's no single winner. Each store has its strengths, and one may be better for you, even if it costs a couple of dollars more. \nCostco is best if you buy a lot, and don't mind the $55 membership fee and like to buy organic produce, which it has a great selection of on its shelves. \nSam’s Club is best for all those extra services, and membership fees as low as $5 to $10, if you grab one of their many promotions. \nAmazon Prime is best for convenience. Plus with Amazon, you don't have the risk of buying stuff you don't need, simply because it is staring at you from an end cap or they have a free tasty sample in the store. \n\"The biggest danger with warehouse stores are impulse buys,\" Demer said, explaining that it is easy to spend another $20 per visit on stuff you never intended to buy. \nAmazon Prime: Worth the convenience? \nEllen Glasgow knows she’s paying a bit more with Amazon Prime than with a warehouse membership, but is fine with that. \nShe said, \"it’s worth the extra money. If you think about it, you’ve got to consider the gas, your car, your time. I can now budget a lot more time for my family and my husband.\" \nSo which of the two warehouse clubs is best? When it comes to Costco versus Sam's Club, where you live may make the decision for you. \nIf one warehouse club is 10 minutes away and the other is 45 minutes....the closer club will almost always make sense, even if it has higher membership fees or does not have all the items you want. That way you don't waste your money. \n\nDon't Waste Your Money is a registered trademark of the EW Scripps Co.\"Like\" John Matarese on Facebook Follow John on Twitter ",

Specifically aimed at providing a unique experience for the various members of the Kindle Fire family, it allows developers to optimize apps for screen size, resolution, API version, and more. With multiple models in the Kindle Fire lineup, developers can tailor-build something that looks better on larger, higher resolution screens. \nAs to why Amazon is opting to go this route, well there are multiple reasons, including better search relevancy and reduced consumer confusion. \nFor more information, head to Amazon’s Developer blog .",

      "text": "Monday morning brought good news for a number of new television series on various networks.\nCBS announced that it was giving full-season orders to the new sitcoms “Man With a Plan” and “The Great Indoors,” which means five of the network’s newcomers will endure through the fall. \n“The Great Indoors” stars Joel McHale in a workplace comedy that mines the generational divide between Generation X and millennials, and “Man With a Plan” marked the much-publicized return of Matt LeBlanc from “Friends” to a network sitcom. Both shows debuted in late October and have earned respectable ratings. “The Great Indoors” was touted by CBS as the No. 2 new comedy of the season, averaging more than 8 million viewers. \nThe new CBS shows “Bull,” “MacGyver” and “Kevin Can Wait,” which stars Kevin James in the season’s top-rated new sitcom, were also given full orders by the network early in the fall. \nThe network also ordered three additional episodes of the medical drama “Code Black,” which is in its second season.\nHBO announced Monday that it was renewing its three fall series for second seasons.\n“Westworld,” a futuristic drama that explores sin and the complexities of consciousness, has proved a ratings hit for HBO, averaging a gross audience of 11.7 million viewers through its first seven episodes.\nThe renewal also includes critically acclaimed comedy series “Insecure.” Created by and starring Issa Rae, “Insecure” examines the difficulties of navigating the modern world as a young black woman. \nAlso scoring a second season is “Divorce,” the series that brought “Sex and the City” star Sarah Jessica Parker back to the network and digs into a marriage as it falls apart. \nCompleting the renewal trifecta was Amazon, which announced Monday a second season renewal for Tig Notaro’s semi-autobiographical series “One Mississippi,” a dark comedy about the intricacies of family and making peace with the past.\nThe second season of “One Mississippi” will air exclusively on Amazon in 2017.\nSee the most-read stories in Entertainment this hour » \nCaption 'Arrival' movie review by Kenneth Turan Kenneth Turan reviews 'Arrival' directed by Denis Villeneuve, starring Amy Adams, Jeremy Renner, Forest Whitaker, Michael Stuhlbarg, Tzi Ma, and Mark O’Brien.

      "title": "5 steps from the 'Good Girls Revolt' cast on mobilizing for women's rights",
      "text": "Amazon’s Good Girls Revolt begins in 1969 as the “girls” of the fictitious News of the Week start their fight against workplace discrimination, based on real events at Newsweek . Though 47 years have passed, many of the scenes and messages ring true for a new generation of women worried about equal rights.\nAs people across the country have openly fretted about everything from access to birth control to sexual assault in the wake of Donald Trump’s presidential win Tuesday night, the overlap in conversations being had today and in the show came into focus for the Good Girls cast .\nAnna Camp, Lena Hall and Genevieve Angelson star in 'Good Girls Revolt.' (Photo: Jessica Miglio)\nWe caught up with Anna Camp (who plays Jane Hollander), Joy Bryant (Eleanor Holmes Norton), Genevieve Angelson (Patti Robinson), Erin Darke (Cindy Reston) and Lynn Povich, who wrote the book that inspired the series, at a screening and panel discussion hosted by NPR in Washington, D.C., Saturday.\nSo what does the women's movement actually look like in 2016? The group shared some insight for the Good Girls of today.\nTwitter is only the beginning Facebook and Twitter can be great tools for activists, but there can be an outsized reliance on the platforms as vehicles of change.\n\"Things like social media make you feel like you’re doing something when you’re not, me totally included in that,\" says Darke. \"You retweet something you feel like you’ve put it out there but sometimes you have to act.\"\nPovich agrees: \"You’re very good online, organizing online, particularly around tech issues and misogyny on the web,\" she said of young women. \"But there’s something about doing it in person and showing real force that’s part of it.\"\n\"Yes, there is bringing attention to it,\" Bryant agrees. \"But the people who are reading those tweets, they can’t change that pay scale.\"\nHost or join a consciousness meeting Darke is one of several taking a cue from the show and holding her own consciousness meeting, though today's versions are a bit different than the salons of the late '60s and '70s.\n\"I think it’s safe to say at this point our consciousnesses are pretty raised,\" Darke laughs. \"We’re pretty aware of what’s happening at the moment but now is the time to form a community and come up with practical ideas of what to do.\"\nFrom left: Joy Bryant, Genevieve Angelson, Lynn Povich, Rep. Eleanor Holmes Norton, Anna Camp, Erin Darke and Linda Holmes. (Photo: Courtesy of Amazon)\nOne strong voice can create an opening As Bryant notes, reflecting on Viola Davis' Emmy acceptance speech in 2015, the pay and opportunity discrepancy for actresses of color is particularly stark, but has become part of the conversation thanks to a few fearless voices.\n\"We’ve been dealing with that for so long, and no one could say anything. It took somebody who had the power to crack it open, and now it’s like, alright cool, I know basically when I’m negotiating for stuff what I’m not going to accept.\"\nAnd the voice doesn't have to be external, Povich says.\n\"The other thing about Newsweek is we changed the system from within. You need that extra outside pressure, but you know your place best. You know the levers of power. You know the personalities, you can make the changes much more effectively than somebody coming in from the outside.\"\nThere's strength in numbers The women in Good Girls needed nearly the entire team to file suit and effect change. Though it can be uncomfortable to bring up salaries, it's important to know the extent of your bargaining power.\n\"There needs to be solidarity and the only way for that to happen is for all of us to be on the same level,\" Bryant says. \"It's the same thing on the show.\"\nKnow the power of no It's also important to know your limits. As Nora Ephron (played by Grace Gummer in the series) demonstrates by leaving her job, saying no can be a critical tool. Though as Bryant acknowledges, the strategy comes with a good amount of risk, and has to be wielded wisely.\n\"Even before I was famous, I know there were people who accepted certain levels and you didn’t have to because you weren’t starving. But if you say yes to everything, they’re going to keep giving you crumbs,\" she says. \"And I’m not taking crumbs, I just want a slice. All I want is a slice. And we have to fight for that.\"\n\"Then you can tweet about it.\"",

      "text": "Combine a hot technology and the world’s largest online retailer into a single book title and you’ve got a pretty appealing volume. Or so hope author John Rossman and Seattle-area publisher Clyde Hill Publishing, who tomorrow will officially debut “ The Amazon Way on IoT: 10 Principles for Every Leader from the World’s Leading Internet of Things Strategies .”\nRossman, a former Bellevue, Wash., resident who now lives in southern California, spent four years at Amazon, from early 2002 through late 2005. First he launched and built up the third-party sellers’ marketplace. After that he ran the enterprise services business, which handled other large retailers’ e-commerce operations. Now he’s taken his knowledge of the company’s operations and mixed it with observations about the Internet of Things (IoT) to provide principles to guide businesses.\nHis 158-page book, available in paperback, a Kindle eBook or an audiobook, is a sequel to “ The Amazon Way: 14 Leadership Principles Behind the World’s Most Disruptive Company .” That book, published in May 2016, has sold more than 50,000 copies and in June went into its second edition.\nRossman spent a few minutes last week telling us about his latest work. The interview has been edited for style and clarity.\nQ: What led you to write this book? \nRossman: For the past 11 years I’ve been a partner for consultancy Alvarez & Marsal. Talking to clients and doing research, I realized there was a lot being written about IoT but nothing targeting a businessperson trying to figure out how to use it in business, in a simple way that explained the technology, the rationales and the models you need to think through.\nI know Amazon is leading the way in every one of those ideas, I’m an authentic Amazon interpreter, and I thought, “There’s a great story here.” My goal was to tell a simple story, to give the business user a framework to think through how IoT can affect their business. I tell it through the lens of Amazon and some other leading companies.\nQ: Who is the book for? \nRossman: It’s for leaders, not necessarily in the C-suite, at midsize to large companies that want to know how either how IoT can affect their business or how they can become tool providers selling IoT-related offerings.\nQ: What was your time at Amazon like? \nRossman: It was a great and demanding place to work, and we were able to get some amazing things done. The reason I wrote about the Amazon leadership principles is that they were real. We used them in everyday decisions and in everyday meetings. When I was there, they hadn’t been codified, but you still saw them in play.\nJohn Rossman Q: I get the “Amazon Way” part of the title, because you were there and it’s a follow-on to your first book. But why IoT? Why not something Amazon is famous for, like its sorting and shipping operation? \nRossman: The impact IoT will have on business and society is progressing extremely fast. It is the biggest thing out there, in terms of technology. It will lead to the next wave of automation, efficiency and new customer experiences. IoT’s promise is that things that seem magic today will be just everyday occurrences, and you won’t know how you ever lived without them. Take the voice interface. It’s going to be commonplace in 10 years. One of the biggest challenges is going to be how to do operating partnerships, like the one among Amazon, DHL and Audi . A lot of companies are going to need to build new skills in those areas.\nQ: Is IoT something every business needs to think about, or is it more appropriate for some than others? For example, service providers versus goods manufacturers. \nRossman: Every business needs to think it through. A big part of the opportunity is in every-day operational improvement — making your processes more streamlined, shortening cycle times, decreasing costs, improving quality. The biggest challenge in process improvement is first getting data and then making improvements based on that data. IoT can take operational improvement to a whole new level in terms of collecting data and making real-time adjustments. And that’s a play for every company out there.\nQ: What sort of timeframe is realistic for companies to implement IoT processes and strategies? \nRossman: It’s a journey, and it could completely change an organization’s trajectory. Don’t wait until it’s mission critical. And don’t think of it as a one-and-done thing. Amazon makes lots of small bets, where many companies think of things as investments rather than bets. One nice thing about IoT is that its costs (of IoT as a service, from Amazon Web Services and other cloud providers) have come way down, so companies can trial things a lot more easily.\nQ: Let’s zoom out a bit. Do you see AWS’s huge lead in the cloud as unassailable? \nRossman: I doubt anyone sees it as unassailable. Other companies have assets that make them viable. But the pace at which AWS adds new features and the scale of what they’re doing is very exciting. They’re making IoT easier for people to access. That’s core plumbing that’s really hard for developers to do, but Amazon is making it pretty easy for everyone to have those capabilities.\nQ: How about Azure, and IBM’s Watson? Is there a leader emerging in terms of IoT as a service? \nRossman: I haven’t studied them all. You need to do due diligence on where each provider is and where they’re going. For example, Microsoft is centering on hybrid cloud. Depending on your situation, that could be an important consideration.\nQ: What has to happen for you to think of this book as a success? \nRossman: I don’t even think about how many units it might sell. I think about whether it will change someone’s thinking and perspective. The best part of doing the first book is that I get emails every week saying, “That book has changed my view of how I lead my team and what I can do.”",

      "text": "  08:28 AM EST Bella Vino Champagne Flutes Now Available to Buy on Amazon Crystal Champagne Flutes by Bella Vino are available to buy on Amazon.com. The glasses are made from lightweight yet durable lead-free crystal and have a short stem design, which makes them stable and easy to handle. The flutes are perfect for champagne and any occasion. \nBella Vino Crystal Champagne Flutes have four main selling points. First, the glasses are of high quality and have an elegant design, which demonstrates the craftsmanship in the manufacture of the product. They are also quite stable and have an easy grip design making it perfect for toasts for any occasion or celebration. \nSecond, the champagne flutes feel easy and pleasant to hold. Unlike many other glasses, Bella Vino’s champagne flutes have shorter stems so they are more stable to hold or when placed on tables, which mean they cannot be easily tipped over. \nThird, the glasses are made from premier clear crystal and are completely free from lead. This makes the product lightweight and durable, and also allows buyers to see and taste the wine, not the glass. \nFinally, Bella Vino’s crystal champagne glasses are dishwasher safe. Again, this is because the flutes are not too heavy and not too fragile. Their short stems also allow them to fit in any dishwasher. The products are also scratch resistant. \nIn addition, Bella Vino is so confident in the quality of the champagne flutes that they offer a 100% money guarantee with the product. Customers who feel unhappy with the product can return the items and obtain a full refund. \nBella Vino has achieved an overall star rating of 4.5 for their champagne flutes. The glasses have received many positive customer reviews. For example, Nidia Doherty says, “The glasses are light, but not cheap feeling. The rims are smooth, and I couldn’t find any defects in the workmanship. I made a batch of mimosa sangria and had to use these gorgeous glasses to enjoy my drink! I think these would compliment any bubbly drink and work well with a lot of china place settings or at cocktail parties.” \nBella Vino’s Crystal Champagne Flutes can be purchased on Amazon at https://www.amazon.com/Crystal-Champagne-Flutes-Bella-Vino/dp/B01B16EXFE \nMedia Contact Company Name: Bella Vino Crystal Champagne Flutes Contact Person: Ira Membrit",

      "text": "Amazon Music Unlimited now available in the UK By 0 \nAmazon isn’t slowing down these days. Yup, the top e-commerce company is always busy announcing new products, services, and integrations. Alexa is a current superstar in the smart home game and we believe it will only expand to more gadgets. It’s not only the Echo that is taking advantage of the voice assistant. Alexa is also found on smartphones via Lexa and on other devices like the Pebble Core, Triby , Fire TV , and August Home door lock among others. \nThere’s also the Nucleus Anywhere intercom , Fabriq speaker , and the Rise Carbon Fiber and Yumi robot from Omate . This time, Alexa will be utilized more frequently as the Amazon Music Unlimited comes to the United Kingdom with over 40 million songs and thousands of stations and playlists. \nAmazon Music Unlimited is a premium service that is offered for £79 per year or £7.99 every month. The service is now available in the UK for Prime and even non-Prime customers but with a £9.99/month premium. \nIf you currently have an Echo subscription plan, you only need to pay £3.99 every month for one Echo device which will give you full access to Amazon Music Unlimited. It can be accessed right on the recently updated Amazon Music app with Alexa voice controls. In the UK, Amazon will prioritize featuring those British musicians and artists but of course, other international artists are also presented. \nPrime Members can take advantage of Amazon Music streaming without any extra fee. It’s best enjoyed on the Amazon Echo so if you don’t have one yet, it’s time to get the device for your home or office.",

      "text": "\"Alexa, what are you wearing?\"\"Alexa, are you horny?\" \"Alexa, how much do you weigh?\"Alexa — Amazon's freestanding virtual assistant — doesn't wear or own any clothes, she can't (physically) feel horny, and she doesn't weigh a single pound. Nevertheless, some people find it normal, and even funny , to pose questions like the above (and other Easter Eggs ) to the popular voice-controlled helper. (Alexa started out as the machine-learned voice behind the brand's plain black speaker, Amazon Echo, and has since expanded to a full range of products.) Would we be asking a virtual assistant the same questions if the voice were male?Amazon's Alexa, Apple’s Siri, and Microsoft’s Cortana are some of today’s most well known virtual assistants. All are female, and all elicit an image of an assistant who is not just a woman, but a woman people can boss around, flirt with, and act inappropriately towards. Compound that with portrayals in the media — like this 2015 magazine cover showing female robots sitting at typewriters — and it all starts to feel like a big step backwards rather than one towards the future. “If we want the computers to behave differently, we have to actually pay attention to how we build them so we don't just create mirrors of what society does,” says Rada Milhacea, a professor of computer science at the University of Michigan, who signed an open letter against that stereotype-enforcing magazine cover.As the line between our technology and “the real world” blurs, how we create, portray, and treat our virtual assistants is a very real issue that needs to be addressed — now. And if we’re going to make a change, we need to start with how we build these AI in the first place. A World Of Fembots Why do our most frequently used virtual assistants have female voices to begin with? Reasoning ranges from research that says our brains like female voices to those who contend that it's a precedent that was set during World War II, when women's voices were used in cockpits. An Amazon Alexa spokesperson told us that when they tested Alexa, both men and women preferred a female voice. In iOS, you actually can switch Siri from her female default to a male voice (but do you know anyone who’s actually done that?).Pop culture, per usual, has reinforced the stereotype of the sexy woman behind the screen, through movies such as 2004's I, Robot and 2013's Her . And even though Siri and Alexa can fend off certain lines of questioning (ask Alexa if she's horny and she'll tell you, \"This isn't a conversation I'm capable of having\"), early marketing didn't help. In one Apple ad from 2012 — a few months after Siri launched on the iPhone 4s — Samuel L. Jackson goes through a series of commands, before telling Siri, at the end of the ad, that she can take the night off. Her response is submissive: \"If you say so.\" \"We're basically training our kids that they can bark commands at a female and she will respond,\" says Ben Parr, the cofounder of chatbot company Octane AI, of our voice-controlled assistants. \" Even if these commands seem harmless on the surface — Siri and Alexa are not human beings — how we talk to them subconsciously affects how we talk to other people, Parr says. Advertisement No Gender, No Problem So, why don’t we just make our AIs genderless? That’s exactly what the creators of newer virtual assistants, such as KAI , are doing. Despite its male name, KAI, a financial assistant, is one of the only truly genderless bots in existence. It is an \"it.\" \"We wanted to do a genderless bot, not an assistant that was a continuation of what was already out there,\" says Dror Oren, the co-founder and VP of Product at Kasisto, the financial tech startup that created KAI. \"As a company, we had a choice here. We could have KAI respond with flirts and funny jokes, or we could choose to answer with a funny joke, but not a flirt.\"KAI is funny in a geeky, know-it-all way. It won't take any bullshit, and hates when people try to waste its time. Insult it, and it will treat you like a parent might treat a petulant child: \"I'm picturing white sand and a hammock. Try me again when you're ready.\"But KAI has an advantage over some of its gendered AI counterparts: It doesn't have a voice. It converses with you via text only. ( Google's personal assistant , which is technically genderless, still has a decidedly female voice.)Still, KAI is being regarded as one of the first truly feminist forms of artificial intelligence. It isn't alone in its genderless distinction — of the more than 11,000 chatbots Facebook Messenger supports, many, including Assist and the Kayak bot, lack \"he\" or \"she\" attribution. But many of those skip having a personality altogether. In this respect, KAI stands out — and that's largely due to who's working behind the scenes. \"I noticed that many AIs had female names and [did things like] apologize for their presence, behave demurely and passively, and sometimes agree and apologize when insulted by users,\" says Jacque Feldman (below), the woman who is writing KAI. \"AI designers have been using women as a shorthand for service and helpfulness. I'm a woman and I can be very helpful but that's not all I am.\" Writing A Woman? You Need A Woman As research has pointed out , people prefer the tonality of a female voice. That’s okay: We can still have female assistants, we just need to ensure gender bias issues don’t creep in. And to do that, you need women to write those bots. Melinda Gates has been one of the most outspoken proponents of the need for larger numbers of women working in artificial intelligence.\"AI is already transforming healthcare, transportation, education, and the way we live our everyday lives,\" Gates told us. \"​That’s why it’s so important that we have diverse talent building it. If the people behind it all look the same and have similar experiences and perspectives, the technologies they are creating will be built to serve only a small group of people rather than our complex and diverse world. For technology and AI to benefit us all, we all need to have a role in creating it.\" Advertisement “ \"For technology and AI to benefit us all, we all need to have a role in creating it.\" Melinda Gates ” It's well known that we have a \"women in tech\" problem — there are aren't enough women in tech to begin with. But women in AI, specifically, is an even bigger problem. At a large tech conference this summer, Gates said that only 17% of computer science graduates are women. And, according to Bloomberg , only 13.7% of the attendees at one of 2015's biggest conferences on artificial intelligence were female. Researchers in the field have referred to artificial intelligence as having both a \"Sea of Dudes\" problem and a \"White Guy Problem.\" If we only have men writing the code behind female virtual assistants that hundreds of thousands of people use on a daily basis, there is no way that those assistants are going to accurately represent a female voice. Shatter The Ceiling Unfortunately, the AI field isn’t going to suddenly be populated with an influx of women overnight. Until then, it’s up to us to give the companies that develop AI feedback when it crosses the line into gender stereotypes and sexism.\"We do a lot of tweaking of how Alexa responds to a variety of questions, both culturally and factually, as time goes on,\" said the Amazon's spokesperson. \"To do this, we use a combination of customer feedback, and overall research on how Alexa is received by customers.\" You can similarly give Apple and Microsoft feedback on their AIs. KAI, too, is constantly changing and adopting language to answer the inevitable non-banking queries, like those about the election.This year, we didn't get our first woman in the White House. But as we continue to make strides, it’s time we ensure our virtual assistants evolve beyond the role of the tech-savvy, 1960s secretary. We need to do this by putting more women in the driver’s seat, giving feedback ourselves, or removing gender from the AI equation altogether. If you’re barking commands at your phone, it doesn’t need to be a woman who leaps to do your bidding. But if it is, she should be a 21st-century woman. Advertisement",

      "text": "Alexa, Can You Charge My Sonata PHEV? Amazon's Smart Speaker Can Now Do Things With Your Hyundai | By Share Starting today, certain owners of new Hyundais will be able to lock, unlock, remote charge and remote start their cars from the comfort of their own house using nothing but voice commands. The company's new Blue Link skill for Amazon Alexa is available across Alexa-enabled devices and Hyundai vehicles equipped with the second-generation Blue Link system. \"Our customers increasingly want more ways to interact with their vehicles, especially when they are hustling to get out the door,\" said Hyundai tech exec Barry Ratzlaff. \"Linking smart devices like the Amazon Echo and Apple Watch to vehicles via Blue Link continues to fill that desire. Allowing consumers to send commands to their car is just the beginning.\" Now, owners of the all-new Ioniq EV and PHEV models are able to start and stop the charge of their cars simply by using voice commands with the Blue Link skill. Furthermore, Blue Link can be accessed from the buttons on the rearview mirror, from the web or simply via your smartphone app - with some features being controllable through the latest Android Wear and Apple Watch. As previously stated, Blue Link skill for Amazon Alexa is only compatible with 2nd-gen Blue Link equipped vehicles, such as all 2017 models , but also the 2016 Genesis, Azera, Tucson, Sonata, Sonata Hybrid, Veloster, Elantra GT. The 2015 Genesis, Sonata and Azera are compatible as well. According to Hyundai, owners can request various functions of their car including: Remote start and stop charging of the Hyundai IONIQ Electric, IONIQ Plug-in and Sonata Plug-in Remote engine start with climate control across all supported Hyundai models Remote door lock/unlock across all Hyundai models Remote horn/lights across all Hyundai models equipped At home, a Hyundai owner can experience interactions like these: Owner: “Alexa, ask Blue Link to start charging my IONIQ.” Alexa: “Request for remote charging your IONIQ has been sent.” Owner: “Alexa, tell Blue Link to start my car at 80 degrees.” Alexa: “Request for remote starting your car with climate control has been sent.” Owner: “Alexa, ask Blue Link to lock my Santa Fe.” Alexa: “Request for remote locking your Santa Fe has been sent.” PHOTO GALLERY",

      "text": "Andre da Loba A The Amazon series Good Girls Revolt , centered on a landmark 1970 gender discrimination case at Newsweek , is the kind of period drama that's more interested in commenting on the present than re-creating the past. The storyline about professional journalists plays fast and loose with the facts, and creator Dana Calvo ( Made in Jersey ) employs the designation \"inspired by\" to characterize her drama's relationship with Lynn Povich's 2012 nonfiction book, The Good Girls Revolt: How the Women of Newsweek Sued Their Bosses and Changed the Workplace . Calvo portrays the bad old days of an openly sexist workplace in a post-feminist glow, as if the only problem for women's advancement was the lack of opportunity.\nThe events of Good Girls Revolt take place from December 1969 to March 1970, and characters at the fictional News of the Week magazine report on real events. This approach can mean embracing the source material — as in an arc detailing a controversial Black Panthers cover story, a reference to the February 23, 1970, issue of Newsweek (\"The Panthers and the Law\") — or disregarding it, as in the pilot episode, built around Altamont as an epitaph for the peace-and-love counterculture. Real-life editor Oswald \"Oz\" Elliott didn't cover that event at all in the newsmagazine he cultivated as the daring liberal alternative to staid, conservative Time .\nAll the promise and problems of Good Girls Revolt are in that pilot. It uses institutionalized gender discrimination to highlight the hurdles working women still encounter, while oversimplifying both the newsroom environment and the real people folded into this historical fiction. Written by Calvo and directed by Liza Johnson ( Elvis & Nixon ), it plays more like frenetic His Girl Friday than methodical All the President's Men , but still effectively introduces the central characters: flame-haired hippie Patti Robinson (Genevieve Angelson), icy upper-crust blonde Jane Hollander (Anna Camp), and endearingly nerdy brunette Cindy Reston (Erin Darke).\nThe smart, ambitious women of News of the Week are researchers, which means doing the legwork of journalism (gathering, organizing, and finding a narrative for relevant facts) and providing it to their male reporters, who do the final write-up and get the byline. They're literally looked-down upon: The women's desks are located on a lower level in the newsroom, known as \"the pit.\" (At the time of the real lawsuit, women at Newsweek were also mail girls, clippers, and fact-checkers. There was one female New York Bureau reporter, and Povich herself was a junior Life & Leisure writer.)\nPatti pushes at the restrictions, developing her own sources and contributing crucial information that can make or break a story. She's in a relationship with her partner, golden boy Douglas Rhodes (Hunter Parrish), who resembles Robert Redford's Bob Woodward, and their sexual attraction is fueled by a competitive desire to produce work that gets the cover.\nJane's WASP parents disapprove of the Jewish reporter she's assigned to, Sam Rosenberg (Daniel Eric Gold), but she uses all her well-bred charm and sharp intellect to make him a rising star. She models herself as the perfect work wife, providing Sam with unwavering support and unquestioning loyalty, even finding a source for a piece on returning Vietnam veterans by digging through his high school yearbook.\nWhile Jane maintains a proper distance from smitten Sam, married Cindy enjoys her flirtatious relationship with photo editor Ned (Michael Oberholtzer), often ducking into his secluded office. Chafing at the timeline imposed by her husband, a year of work before having their first child, she subsumes her desire to write a novel in the routine task of captioning photos. (A mouse that roared, Darke's Cindy is the show's breakout Peggy Olson character.)\nA fourth woman looms large in the pilot: Nora Ephron (Grace Gummer). She's the magical feminist of Good Girls Revolt , waking up her sisters to injustice. Nora emboldens and empowers, providing every woman with the precise piece of information she needs to get on the path of enlightenment. She's the consummate New Yorker, a live-your-best-life advice dispenser, and the lone brave voice directly challenging the status quo. This Nora is also a fabrication. Ephron did work for Newsweek after graduating from Wellesley in 1962, and considered herself lucky to be the \"Elliott girl,\" handling the editor's mail and reading stories from first draft to final copy.\nBut by imposing such an inspirational figure as the instigator of the action, Calvo diminishes her characters. Nora gets Patti and Cindy to the consciousness-raising meeting where they encounter lawyer Eleanor Holmes Norton (Joy Bryant), the real ACLU attorney who handled the Newsweek case. Calvo's women, otherwise portrayed as intelligent and ambitious, need to be led by a strong leader with all the answers, be it Ephron or Norton. The real women organized themselves and sought out Norton, joining together to shatter the image of \"the good girl\" who's grateful for an opportunity to work outside the home and accepting her second-class status. Their fictional counterparts demonstrate little of that initiative — they succeed despite themselves.\nCalvo and her writing staff also blunt the confrontational attitudes of 1970 with the inclusive language of 2016. There's barely any era-appropriate slang, and even the most charged encounters play out tamely. The Black Panther who challenges Doug about his white privilege can't come up with an insult more biting than calling him \"Sundance.\" Discussions of police profiling and racism sound as if they're lifted from contemporary news programs, and the deferential respect shown to returning veterans is more attuned to today than the contentious Vietnam War, when anti-war sentiments translated into an open hostility to the drafted young men who fought it.\nThe overall timidity of Good Girls Revolt results in a soft misogyny of low expectations. Calvo hesitates to show central male characters (including imperious editor-in-chief \"Finn\" Woodhouse, played with blithe authority by Chris Diamantopoulos) being overtly sexist. So it's other reporters who treat the hiring of a new researcher as if they were selecting a mail-order bride, and a different editor who encourages a woman to share her opinions about a story and then flashes his penis. What's missing is the virulent sexism of even today, much less what emerged during the 2016 presidential campaign, aimed at female journalists and Hillary Clinton.\nIn 1970, abortion was still illegal, birth control was restricted, and women were more financially dependent on men (one episode details a researcher who needs a signed approval from her husband serving in Vietnam despite using her own money for a real estate transaction). But Calvo shows men who actually had state-sanctioned power over women acting with more restraint than the average internet troll.\nEven with the questionable choices, this well-intentioned and female-positive (women directed six of the 10 episodes) series is thoughtful entertainment. But right now, after an election when women's rights, women's dignity, and women's abilities were summarily dismissed, that's just not enough.\nGood Girls Revolt streams on Amazon.\nWith an Interior Epic, Ang Lee Gets Too Real for His Medium PREVIOUS Going Dutch: Suss Out the Subversion in the Work of the Man Behind 'Showgirls' NEXT Contact: Serena Donadoni Follow: Village Voice Village Voice Film &amp TV Film Film and TV",

(Don't Waste Your Money) - \nIf you want to save money on household products, the best way to do that for years was to join a warehouse club like Sam's Club or Costco. \nBut is it still worth the membership fee? Or has Amazon Prime, with its free shipping, made warehouse clubs as quaint as your old landline phone? \nWe decided to put all three retailers to the test. \nShoppers have their favorites \nFrankie Brinkman, while loading her car outside Costco in Springdale, Ohio, said she won’t buy household items anywhere else. \n\"I am total Costco, love Costco,\" the mom said. \nBut Lauren Geers and her young children prefer Sam’s Club for its house brands, saying \"we buy the Member’s Mark paper towels, toilet paper, diapers and formula.\" \nThen there’s busy mom Ellen Glasgow of Milford, who gets everything she needs, with free shipping, from Amazon Prime. \n\"It’s been a blessing, there’s nothing you can’t order,\" Glasgow said. \nHer smartphone has replaced her car when it comes to shopping for detergent and diapers. \n\"A quick two minutes, I’m set and it’s going to be in my mailbox or at my door the next day,\" she said. \nWarehouse clubs fight back \nWarehouse stores know you can get crock pots, clothing and paper towels easily online these days. So they are fighting back with products that are not so easy to get with a click of the mouse, such as discount tires, installed while you wait. \nDon’t need tires? Then what about prescription drugs? Or hearing aids? Or eyeglasses? \nConsumer Reports Magazine says Sam’s Club and Costco's prices on those services are lower than most other chains. Their pharmacies have come in tops in several recent surveys by the magazine, with only online pharmacies offering lower prices. \nBut what if you just want household goods? \nWe turned to one of the top shopping bloggers in the country, the Krazy Coupon Lady, Joanie Demer. \nDemer, her partner Heather Wheeler and her team recently compared prices on 170 popular items at Costco, Sam's and Amazon. They used Amazon's \"Subscribe and Save\" program, that gives an additional five percent discount on products you order every month. \nSo the survey's winners? Costco came in first place, with the lowest prices overall. \n\"We found much to our surprise that Costco is still twelve percent less in the cost of the items than Amazon Subscribe and Save,\" Demer said. \nSam's Club was in second place, with prices 5 percent higher than Costco in their 170 item comparison. \nBut Demer warns that Costco’s relatively high $55 membership fee (compared with Sam's) means you need to shop more to see those savings. \n\"To make the Costco membership worthwhile you need to spend $600 or more per year to break even,\" she said. \nAmazon Prime was the most expensive in her test (12 percent higher than Sam's and 7 percent higher than Costco) even with free shipping, and the extra discount offered by Subscribe and Save. Plus, it has a $99 annual fee, higher than either warehouse store. \nHowever, with the extra discount provided by Amazon's \"Subscribe and Save\" program, Demer says diapers can actually be cheaper than the warehouse clubs. So she says new moms should consider it. \nPrice isn't everything \nDemer says there's no single winner. Each store has its strengths, and one may be better for you, even if it costs a couple of dollars more. \nCostco is best if you buy a lot, and don't mind the $55 membership fee and like to buy organic produce, which it has a great selection of on its shelves. \nSam’s Club is best for all those extra services, and membership fees as low as $5 to $10, if you grab one of their many promotions. \nAmazon Prime is best for convenience. Plus with Amazon, you don't have the risk of buying stuff you don't need, simply because it is staring at you from an end cap or they have a free tasty sample in the store. \n\"The biggest danger with warehouse stores are impulse buys,\" Demer said, explaining that it is easy to spend another $20 per visit on stuff you never intended to buy. \nAmazon Prime: Worth the convenience? \nEllen Glasgow knows she’s paying a bit more with Amazon Prime than with a warehouse membership, but is fine with that. \nShe said, \"it’s worth the extra money. If you think about it, you’ve got to consider the gas, your car, your time. I can now budget a lot more time for my family and my husband.\" \nSo which of the two warehouse clubs is best? When it comes to Costco versus Sam's Club, where you live may make the decision for you. \nIf one warehouse club is 10 minutes away and the other is 45 minutes....the closer club will almost always make sense, even if it has higher membership fees or does not have all the items you want. That way you don't waste your money. \n\nDon't Waste Your Money is a registered trademark of the EW Scripps Co.\"Like\" John Matarese on Facebook Follow John on Twitter ",

      "title": "'Black Friday 2016' Amazon, PS4, Xbox One sales latest news: Amazon launches 'Countdown to Black Friday;' PS4 and Xbox One bundles offered at around $250",
      "text": "  \n(Reuters/Shannon Stapleton) Retailers are already enticing customers with discounts and bundled deals. \nNow that all the Halloween candy has been consumed, it's time to start preparing for Thanksgiving and Black Friday. And this year, consumers are raring to get their hands on the best deals. \nAmazon is trying to get a head start on its competitors with the launch of its Countdown to Black Friday deals on Nov. 14. With internet sales expected to be higher this year than in 2015, it's understandable why the online retailer wants to take full advantage of the month. \nThe company's Countdown to Black Friday will offer consumers with new deals on select products daily. Customers should also be on the lookout for Amazon's Lightning Deals, a half hour event where special deals on apparel, beauty products, electronics, travel accessories, and others are offered. However, they should remember that these deals are only available while supplies last. \nSome of the more interesting deals that Amazon is offering are the discounted Amazon Echo, the Echo Dot, the Fire Stick wth Alexa Voice Remote, the Fire, and the Fire HD tablets. Customers can expect to get US$10âUS$40 knocked off from some of these devices. Advertisement \nBlack Friday is also the best time for serious gamers and gadget enthusiasts to add to their video game collection, get a new console, or snag some new accessories. According to reports , stores like Best Buy, GameStop, Kohl's, Target, Toys R Us, and Walmart will be offering the 500 GB PS4 Slim and \"Uncharted 4\" at a bundled price of $249.99. \nConsumers can expect these retailers to add a little something to sweeten the pot. For instance, Best Buy will reportedly add in \"The Last of Us: Remastered\" and \"Ratchet & Clank\" to the offer, while GameStop will include just one of the two games. Meanwhile, customers who plan on shopping at Walmart will get a $30 gift card, while Kohl's regulars will get a $75 Kohl's Cash. \nThere are also some great discounts being offered on the Xbox One, but most appear to center on the 500 GB white Xbox One S with either \"Battlefield 1\" or \"Minecraft Favorites\" thrown in. The bundle will reportedly come in at just $249.99. \nGamers can get a $40 gift card from Target if they purchase the \"Battlefield 1\" bundle, while Kohl's will be adding a $75 Kohl's Cash with the \"Minecraft\" bundle. Meanwhile, Dell is offering online customers a bundled Xbox One package that includes the console, \"Battlefield 1,\" \"Gears of War 4,\" and a second controller for only $249.99. \nIt's so easy to get overwhelmed with so many discounts being offered. Consumers should do some research first and check out where they can get the best deals before heading out on Nov. 25. Copyright ÂŠ   Like Us",

      "text": "Is Amazon Echo Dot Bringing Echo Back? By Pets Torrefranca  48 pm Echo Dot, Amazon's newest innovation in Smart Speaker techology(Photo : YouTube/Amazon) \nTheEcho Dot is Amazon's latest gadget in the smart speaker market. An alternative to the previously launched Echo, the Echo Dot is cheaper and smaller than its predecessor. Advertisement \nAmazon's Echo Dot comes from Amazon's range of innovative products designed to make life easier thru voice commands. The Echo Dot's predecessor Echo introduced Alexa, which is Amazon's virtual assistant. \nThe name Alexa is derived from Alexa Internet, which is an independent internet indexing company founded in 1996 and acquired by Amazon in 1999. Alexa is the very first virtual assistant with its own dedicated device. Compared to other virtual assistants like Apple's Siri, Microsoft's Cortana or Google Assistant, Alexa makes the conversation more natural, like the user is actually talking to a human assistant. \nSpecs wise the Echo Dot is the closest thing to the Echo. Although the Echo Dot cannot perform all tasks the Echo can do, this tiny device is equipped with new features like Bluetooth and a 3.5mm output, which is not present in the Echo device, making the Echo Dot the most innovative among the two. Having the Bluetooth feature really makes a huge difference since both the Echo and Echo Dot's speakers do not perform well when used in music streaming. Another noticeable feature of the Echo Dot is the light ring on top which indicates if Alexa is listening or not. \nWhen it comes to price, Echo Dot's price tag is at $50, which is $130 less than the Echo's $179.99 price tag. The Echo Dot is currently enjoying an almost perfect review from tech experts around the web. This tiny device is highly recommended for people who want to experience talking to an AI or simply those who wants to have an assistant to boss around but could not afford a real one. To sum it all up, the Amazon Echo Dot is the best $50 you'll ever spend, according to a review by KnowTechie .  ",

      "text": "Tip : Use comma (,) to separate multiple quotes. Learn more... \nWed, Nov 16, 2016, 12:54 GMT - UK Markets close in 3 hrs 36 mins Is Morrisons’ Amazon deal a death blow to Ocado Group plc? By Ian Pierce | Fool.co.uk – 41 minutes ago 264.00 -18.20 \nShares of online grocer Ocado (LSE: OCDO) are down 4% in early trading on the news that Morrisons (LSE: MRW) is deepening its relationship with Amazon to include free two-hour delivery to Amazon Prime members. Morrisons already supplies the food for Amazon Pantry, so this next step caught few by surprise, but it's still a big blow to Ocado's hopes for several reasons. \nFor one, the deal adds extra competition to an already crowded sector that Ocado can't afford. The entry of Amazon, a deep-pocketed competitor willing to sacrifice margins for volume, signals further price cuts in the market to attract customers. For Ocado, whose operating margins in H1 were a paltry 2.1%, there isn't much room to attract customers by cutting prices while also investing heavily in expansion efforts. \nCompetition from Amazon will also be particularly difficult for Ocado because the two companies target the same relatively wealthy customer base. Ocado's average customer spends roughly £110 per shop, and there's likely to be significant overlap between these shoppers and those who dish out £79 a year for Amazon Prime. The tie-up between Morrisons and Amazon Prime will also begin rolling out in London and Hertfordshire, Ocado's geographic heartland. \nThe end of Ocado? \nIs this an immediate deathblow for Ocado? No. The company is still consistently growing sales in double-digits and it has strong competitive advantages in its distribution network and logistics knowledge. But the problem is that these are the same strengths that Amazon is famous for. If Amazon follows its traditional game plan of ignoring margins in order to bring in new customers, Ocado's relatively weak balance sheet and small size will prove little challenge for the American giant. \nWhat hope does that leave for Ocado? Well, the company desperately needs to land a long-promised contract with an international grocer. Putting its logistics knowhow, tech platform and distribution-related intellectual property to good use overseas in order to escape price wars and low margins at home could be a means of reversing the downward spiral share prices are stuck in. Otherwise, we could be looking at a buyout as Ocado's best hope of rewarding shareholders. \nFor Morrisons this deal is a net positive as it expands on the company's strength in wholesale foods and broadens its geographic reach into areas of the country where it has little presence. It also nicely complements the current turnaround programme that's focusing on closing non-performing stores and refitting the entire estate by 2018. \nThis plan drove overall revenue down 1.2% year-on-year in Q3 due to fewer stores but like-for-like sales at retained locations improved a healthy 1.6%. This means the additional sales from the Amazon deal will be very welcome as a way to balance out lower revenue from fewer locations. \nNow, this doesn't mean Morrisons has escaped the increased competition and subsequent price wars that have battered the industry. H1 operating margins remained low at 2.7% and net debt, which is expected to be £1.2bn at year-end, is still worryingly high. The deal with Amazon will be a boost to sales, but price deflation and continued competition from discounters will be constant headwinds going forward for Morrisons. \nOcado is turning out to not be the vaunted growth darling it was long held up as. But growth investors needn't fret because the Motley Fool has recommended one company that has consistently grown sales every single year since going public in 1997 . \nAnd the market hasn't ignored this success as share prices are up over 200% in the past five years alone. \nTo discover why the Fool's analysts believe the company could triple again in the coming decade, simply follow this link for your free, no obligation copy of the report. \nIan Pierce has no position in any shares mentioned.

      "text": "Monday morning brought good news for a number of new television series on various networks.\nCBS announced that it was giving full-season orders to the new sitcoms “Man With a Plan” and “The Great Indoors,” which means five of the network’s newcomers will endure through the fall.\n“The Great Indoors” stars Joel McHale in a workplace comedy that mines the generational divide between Generation X and millennials, and “Man With a Plan” marked the much-publicized return of Matt LeBlanc from “Friends” to a network sitcom. Both shows debuted in late October and have earned respectable ratings. “The Great Indoors” was touted by CBS as the No. 2 new comedy of the season, averaging more than 8 million viewers.\nThe new CBS shows “Bull,” “MacGyver” and “Kevin Can Wait,” which stars Kevin James in the season’s top-rated new sitcom, were also given full orders by the network early in the fall.\nThe network also ordered three additional episodes of the medical drama “Code Black,” which is in its second season.\nHBO announced Monday that it was renewing its three fall series for second seasons.\n“Westworld,” a futuristic drama that explores sin and the complexities of consciousness, has proved a ratings hit for HBO, averaging a gross audience of 11.7 million viewers through its first seven episodes.\nThe renewal also includes critically acclaimed comedy series “Insecure.” Created by and starring Issa Rae, “Insecure” examines the difficulties of navigating the modern world as a young black woman.\nAlso scoring a second season is “Divorce,” the series that brought “Sex and the City” star Sarah Jessica Parker back to the network and digs into a marriage as it falls apart.\nCompleting the renewal trifecta was Amazon, which announced Monday a second season renewal for Tig Notaro’s semi-autobiographical series “One Mississippi,” a dark comedy about the intricacies of family and making peace with the past.\nThe second season of “One Mississippi” will air exclusively on Amazon in 2017.\nSee the most-read stories in Entertainment this hour »\nCaption 'Arrival' movie review by Kenneth Turan Kenneth Turan reviews 'Arrival' directed by Denis Villeneuve, starring Amy Adams, Jeremy Renner, Forest Whitaker, Michael Stuhlbarg, Tzi Ma, and Mark O’Brien.

      "text": "Better Buy: Amazon.com, Inc. vs. Facebook Inc newsfeedback@fool.com (Adam Levy) Image source: Amazon.com . \nTwo of the most-visited websites on the planet are Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) . Each has produced user and revenue growth over the past several years that led the companies to outpace the overall growth of the stock market. They now each have a market capitalization over $350 billion. \nInvesting in either company is an investment in its leadership, which in each case is the founder of the company. Jeff Bezos, Amazon's CEO, is notorious for sacrificing short-term profits for a larger piece of the pie in the long term. Mark Zuckerberg, who heads Facebook, commonly talks about his vision for the company 10 years into the future, even though tech is extremely difficult to predict that far out. \nEach company saw its stock price fall after reporting third-quarter earnings recently, which may present a buying opportunity for investors. Let's look at the futures of each company and try to determine which is the better buy right now. Margins under pressure \nAmazon and Facebook are facing similar problems, which led to the market pushing down their stocks. Each company gave commentary indicating their profit margins will come under pressure over the next year. \nAmazon CFO Brian Olsavsky told investors Amazon is making a step up in investments. It's spending twice as much on Prime Video content in the back half of 2016, expanding the number of fulfillment centers its opening, and spending heavily to support Prime's expansion to India. All of these expenses weighed heavily on its third-quarter profit margin and outlook for the fourth quarter. \nAmazon is forecasting an operating profit between $0 and $1.25 billion in the fourth quarter. It generated $1.1 billion in operating profit last year. Olsavsky wouldn't provide guidance on operating income or expenses into 2017, but he noted that it takes over a year for fulfillment centers to ramp up to full operating capacity, putting additional pressure on margins. \nFacebook, meanwhile, is preparing to experience slower revenue growth and higher expenses over the next year. During the company's third-quarter earnings call, CFO Dave Wehner told investors that it's nearing ad load saturation and expects revenue growth to slow meaningfully after the second quarter next year as a result. On top of that, he said Facebook plans to invest aggressively in 2017, resulting in significant growth in operating expenses -- particularly R&D expenses tied to acquiring top engineering talent. \nWehner wouldn't provide specifics around whether he expects expense growth to outpace revenue growth going into next year, but analysts generally interpreted his comments as a forecast for margin compression. Growth and valuation \nAs mentioned, both companies are all about growth. Looking at their respective valuations makes that abundantly clear. Amazon stock is priced at 180 times its trailing earnings, and Facebook shares cost 58 times the company's trailing earnings per share. Looking at their price-to-sales ratio provides a slightly better picture, with Amazon trading for 2.9 times sales, and Facebook priced at 15.8 times sales. \nBoth are well above their industry averages, but both companies should be considered well above average. \nAmazon is growing sales consistently in the mid-20s year after year, even as competitors move aggressively into e-commerce. Even large competitors with lower online sales bases, such as Wal-Mart and Target , can't match its online sales growth. Both brick-and-mortar competitors garner P/S ratios around 0.5, but analysts expect Wal-Mart to grow its revenue just 1% this year and for Target to see a nearly 6% sales decline. \nMeanwhile, analysts forecast 52% revenue growth from Facebook this year and 35% next year. Its earnings are also exploding, with expectations for 77% growth in non-GAAP EPS this year, and another 28% growth next year. That's even factoring in some margin compression. \nFacebook is trading for less than 24 times its 2017 earnings expectations despite 28% growth, making the stock look fairly valued based on its price/earnings-to-growth ratio. Interestingly, Amazon is trading for just 87 times its 2017 earnings expectation, and analysts expect its earnings per share to grow 89% year over year. As such, both have a PEG under 1. \nBoth companies are growing fast enough to support their monstrous valuations. While there are some question marks surrounding the margins of both companies, they're both well-positioned for long-term growth. But where Facebook's earnings and revenue growth are starting to slow meaningfully, Amazon's sales continue moving steadily higher and are expected to continue. That consistency makes it a better buy -- if only slightly -- in my book. \n10 stocks we like better than Amazon.com \nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

      "text": "Amazon has announced the availability of its new family plan for Amazon Music Unlimited . This plan is priced at $14.99/month for Amazon Prime and non-Prime customers. Amazon Prime customers can also take advantage of a special savings with the option to purchase an annual package for $149. The plan accommodates six members, and each one gets unlimited streaming and personalized recommendations based on their own listening history.\nAmazon introduced Music Unlimited in October with the mission of creating a service that could compete with services such as Spotify and Google Play Music. While Amazon is late to the market, the company is distinguishing its service with plan options and voice controls. Customers can purchase less expensive plans for a single Amazon device, such as the Amazon Echo. Music Unlimited is also integrated with Alexa, Amazon’s voice assistant, which enables a range of available options for interacting with the service.\nFor more information on Music Unlimited and the plans available, follow the source link below.",

      "text": "Here's How Amazon is Making Their Fulfillment Businesses More Valuable Third party sellers and those who dropship will have to make changes. Image credit: Bloomberg | Getty Images Watch Now November 16, 2016 \nAmazon stores are very hot at the moment . It makes sense, given that they are the biggest marketplace on the internet with a huge in-built customer base. Just on Cyber Monday 2015 alone, there were 23 million orders. If you are an online seller, it makes perfect sense for you to have a presence there. \nBut anytime you place your revenues in the hands of another company, you subject yourself to both the positive and negative consequences of their actions. Ecommerce store owners who rely on strong rankings in Google could one day find that Google no longer favors their website. In the same vein, businesses that sell through Amazon’s marketplace benefit from their massive customer draw, but are also subject to Amazon’s policies. \nRecently Amazon changed some of these policies, and some of their sellers will feel a pinch as a result. FBA vs. third-party sellers. \nTwo of the most common business models on Amazon for sellers are their Fulfilled by Amazon (FBA) program and their third party seller program. Many of the businesses who participate in the third party seller program are arbitrageurs who utilize dropshipping to turn a quick profit. \nRelated: Here's How to Find Growth Opportunities Within Your Amazon-FBA Business \nFulfilled By Amazon is as it says. You manufacture or source your products yourself, send them to Amazon, and they will send them out for you when you receive an order -- for a fee obviously. Third-party sellers, however, opt out of Amazon’s warehousing and fulfillment services. There can be several good reasons to opt-out of the FBA program, especially if a business has fulfillment operations already established. \nHowever, there is a significant portion of Amazon’s third party sellers who dropship. These sellers never touch the product. Their role is to generate orders. Order fulfillment and returns are handled by the company that makes the product, or by a distributor of that product. In the most simplistic terms, a dropshipper acts as a front-end marketing arm for certain products. \nRecently, Amazon informed third party sellers that they’ll need to adopt Amazon’s return policies for any orders received through the Amazon marketplace. For these third party sellers, and especially for dropshippers, this could represent a significant financial pinch. Amazon’s push for a more uniform experience. \nWhile many Amazon sellers are upset over this change -- due to the added cost and process of shipping prepaid return labels -- Amazon is certainly doing this to improve consumers experiences. \nFor the consumer, there is little difference in experience if you order a product that is sold directly by Amazon vs. a product that is sold from a company utilizing Amazon’s FBA service. Both products will be eligible for Prime. Both products will share the same return policy. Both products will be held to the same standards, and both products will come directly from Amazon. \nHowever, in the past, a consumer who ordered from a third party seller may have a different experience. The delivery times may not be as reliable, the quality of the product may not be as high, and the return policies may differ depending on the seller. \nAmazon’s recent change to require that all sellers provide a prepaid return slip appears to be aimed at improving their customer’s experience when ordering from a third party seller. Clamping down on dropshippers. \nRegular FBA sellers should be thrilled over Amazon’s recent changes to their return policy and also ratings systems. In effect, Amazon is removing low-quality competition. \nFor third party sellers who manage their own fulfillment, however, they have a legitimate complaint. Not only will this likely impact margins, but it will also add a new step in their fulfillment processes. \nBut the entrepreneurs who this hurts the most are the dropship arbitrageurs. These sellers are entrepreneurs who saw an opportunity to push products through Amazon’s massive marketplace without being involved in handling a physical product. In many of these cases, the company that is actually receiving the orders has no idea that their dropshipper is selling their product through Amazon (and may actually prohibit selling through Amazon). \nRelated: 3 Strategies to Make Your Product the Best Before It Comes Out of the Shadows \nJames Thomson, CEO of Buy Box Experts , an Amazon consultantancy firm, sees Amazon as focusing on lower-quality dropshippers. \n“Amazon is definitely clamping down on drop shippers. [They are] definitely clamping down on retail arbitrage (buying stuff in bulk for low prices and then reselling for a profit). It's not that they're bad things. It’s that the performance metrics are nowhere near as good as they are through FBA. So at the end of the day if Prime and FBA are really what Amazon wants, that's the level of performance Amazon wants its sellers to deliver on.” \nAmazon is effectively making retail arbitrage much more difficult to sustain. Ultimately, this makes FBA businesses more valuable. \nThere have been some questions about the long-term viability of Amazon-based businesses. At Quiet Light Brokerage, while we have seen a strong uptick in the number of Amazon businesses for sale, we have also heard strong feedback from seasoned acquisition experts who wonder about the viability of a business built on Amazon’s marketplace. \nIf anything, though, Amazon business owners who are already on the FBA program should be encouraged. By focusing on the end user experience, Amazon will progressively weed out those companies that previously have been able to compete head-to-head with higher quality businesses and higher-quality products. \nRelated: Ecommerce Is Growing, But Customers Still Prefer Shopping in Stores \nThat’s not to suggest that this change alone will eliminate the problems of retail arbitrage, nor will it eliminate some of the competitive issues on the Amazon marketplace. But this, along with a number of changed policies, does seem to be a step in the right direction. \nThe end result for business owners who use Amazon to fuel a revenue stream is that their business becomes more valuable, more defensible and more sustainable. And, for the consumers, a better experience. Mark Daoust Mark Daoust’s passion for creating sales agreements that benefit both sides of the table led him to create Quiet Light Brokerage in 2007.

      "text": "Image source: Amazon. What happened? \nFollowing Amazon.com 's (NASDAQ: AMZN) launch of Music Unlimited last month, a new on-demand streaming service that is much broader than the previous Prime Music offering, the company has made good on its promise to launch a family plan. The price for a family plan is $15 per month and will include access for up to six family members, each of whom need a separate Amazon account in order to create personalized recommendations. \nThe individual plan includes a generous $2 per month discount for Prime members, which brings the monthly cost to $8. The family plan pricing for Prime members is less generous, and the only discount is $149 per year, which translates into two months free. Does it matter? \nUnlike Prime Music, which is a benefit that's included at no additional cost but more limited in scope, Music Unlimited is mostly a separate service that only receives discounts from having a Prime membership. Amazon is also forgoing its typical strategy of aggressively undercutting on price, as family plans from competing services Apple Music and Spotify are also $15 per month (those services do not offer discounts for annual subscriptions, though). \nAmazon Music Unlimited doesn't appear to be particularly differentiated, and it's quite late to the market. It's hard to imagine the service garnering a large number of subscribers or moving the needle in any meaningful way for the e-commerce giant. In addition, the Music Unlimited discounts that a Prime membership gets are modest, so are unlikely to drive Prime membership adoption, either. \nForget the 2016 Election: 10 stocks we like better than Amazon.com \nDonald Trump was just elected president, and volatility is up. But here's why you should ignore the election: \nInvesting geniuses Tom and David Gardner have spent a long time beating the market no matter who's in the White House. In fact, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, Motley Fool Stock Advisor , has tripled the market.*",

      "text": "Builder Connected GE Kitchen Appliances Now Answer to Voice Commands Homeowners can ask Amazon's Alexa and her new GE counterpart \"Geneva\" to set the oven timer or start the dishwasher. By Lauren Shanesy GE Appliances has added new skills in time for Thanksgiving, including tailored turkey oven temperatures and meat probe settings. \nThanksgiving is coming up next week, and kitchens are about to get hectic as families pile in to cook a myriad of stuffing dishes, sweet potato casseroles, pumpkin pies, and roasted turkeys for the holiday meal. Just in time, GE appliances now give homeowners an on-hand sous chef to tame the kitchen chaos. \nGE Appliances has partnered with Amazon to add Alexa skill sets to its WiFi connected appliances. Homeowners working in the kitchen can now ask Alexa, the voice who \"lives\" inside the automated Amazon Echo system, to assist with tasks around the kitchen, such as preheating the oven, checking the internal temperature of a meat while cooking with an integrated meat probe, or starting the dishwasher, all with a simple voice command. \nBut Alexa isn't acting alone. Meet Geneva, the unique character created by GE Appliances and Monogram for the built-in Alexa skill set. Geneva launched in September of this year and is the first Alexa skill set from the company to control a broad range of kitchen appliances, including refrigerators, dishwashers, wall ovens, ranges, laundry and more. Homeowners can say things like, \"Alexa, tell Geneva to preheat my oven for turkey,\" \"Alexa, tell Geneva to set the oven timer for 10 minutes,\" or \"Alexa, ask Geneva when the dishwasher will be finished.\" \nFor a fun added holiday perk, Geneva is also designed to get into the holiday spirit. When speaking with her on Thanksgiving day, she may reply to users with a \"Happy Turkey Day\" or a \"Gobble Gobble\". \nThis isn't GE's first collaboration with the web services company. In October, GE added Amazon's Dash buttons to their dishwashers , which provide homeowners with a built-in push button that orders more detergent through their online account and has it delivered right to their door.

      "text": "Tasha The Amazon Debuts Fresh & Fiery \"Die Every Day\" EP November 16, 2016 | 11:10 PM 0 \nTasha The Amazon continues her climb as one of the more exciting artists coming out of Toronto right now with her new “Die Every Day” EP. \nProduced by herself and Danthrax (who together go by the name Bass & Bakery), the album features previously released singles “ Picasso Leaning ” and “ Prayer ” as well as several unheard cuts. \nSpeaking with HipHopDX this past summer , Tasha said the quality of her music had improved dramatically over the past year, and this new project proves that she was right. The sound she presents on it is darker and more hard-edged than what’s typically coming out of Toronto, filled with heavy bass and fierceness. \nTasha will be performing with YG at The Wiltern in Los Angeles on November 29 as part of Redbull’s 30 Days In LA 2016. \nCheck out Tasha The Amazon’s Die Every Day stream, cover art and tracklist below. \n1.

      "text": "InStyle November 16, 2016 Each year, Amazon gives the gift that keeps on giving for those who didn't quite meet their book-a-week New Year's resolution: a digestible list of the retailer's favorite books released in the past year. Okay, so it's not actually that digestible--there's a ton of different categories, but for our purposes we've whittled it down to the site's top 10 picks from 2016. Last year's top 10 included major titles like Paula Hawkins's recently adapted The Girl on the Train, Lauren Groff's wildly popular dual-narrative Fates and Furies, and Ta-Nehisi Coates's game-changing Between the World and Me. This year's list includes a good mix of memoir and fiction, thriller and historical drama--though it may be a bit less flashy than its 2015 predecessor. Among the top titles sits an account of growing up in middle class America, a historical tale of twin Holocaust survivors, and a coming-of-age story set in '70s-era Brooklyn.

      "text": "Tweet \nIt’s no secret that Amazon reigns as the leading online e-commerce site. Amazon has given rise to today’s consumer shopping norm – a long way from the online bookstore it originally started. \nOn a given month, it can receive up to 2.3 billion visits , which is roughly 23% of the total traffic of the shopping category . In fact, in September 2016, Amazon.com was ranked the number 1 shopping site across 59 countries, as shown in the map below. \n\nSimlarWeb’s recent report, the Complete Amazon Factbook covers Amazon’s digital market share and the channels that it utilizes to dominate the e-commerce and retail market. \nSome of the points covered in the report include a breakdown of Amazon’s traffic sources and how the percentage of direct traffic contributes to its brand. \nAn analysis of Amazon’s shopping season from October 2015 through January 2016 reveals the busiest and least trafficked shopping days, while anyone interested in the most popular consumer products, refer to the index listing Amazon’s most searched for products (Hint: The most popular one begins with the letter “K”).",
