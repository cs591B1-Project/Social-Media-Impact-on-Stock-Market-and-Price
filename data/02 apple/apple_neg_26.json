      "text": "  Nachdem schon Google und Apple in die Entwicklung von selbstfahrenden Autos investieren, reiht sich nun auch Intel in die Reihe der Konzerne ein, die auf diesem Gebiet tätig werden. Der CEO von Intel, Brian Krzanich, kündigte auf der LA Auto Show's AutoMobility conference an, 250 Mio. Dollar in die Entwicklung von selbstfahrenden Autos zu investieren. Diese Investitionen sollen den Weg für eine neue Generation der Konnektivität, Kommunikation, Sicherheit, Deep Learning etc. bereiten. Einen besonderen Fokus hat Krzanich dabei auf das sogenannte Internet der Dinge gelegt, welches dabei helfen soll, das Fahren sicherer und effizienter zu machen. Der CEO wies auch darauf hin, dass sich die Autofirmen, die in diese Richtung forschen, darauf einstellen sollen, in Zukunft bis zu 4000 GB Daten pro Auto pro Tag zu empfangen und zu verarbeiten. Die Ankündigung ist Teil von Intels Kooperationen mit Auto- und Systemherstellern, um moderne Technologien weiter in Autos zu integrieren. Tests",

      "text": "Apple is Throttling Performance of the Qualcomm iPhone 7 [Report] LIKE MORE Posted 20 minutes ago by iClarified · 628 views · Translate A new report from Re/code says sources within Apple confirm that the company is throttling the Qualcomm LTE modem in the Verizon iPhone 7.As soon as the iPhone 7 was released users began notice a difference in download speeds between the Verizon iPhone 7 which features a Qualcomm MDM9645M LTE modem and the AT&T version which has an Intel XMM7360 modem.Cellular Insights performed tests which concluded that the average performance delta between the two is in the 30% range in favor of the Qualcomm variant.Recently, Bloomberg reported on testing by Twin Prime which determined that although the Verizon model is faster than the Intel model, it still is not as fast as it could be. The Samsung Galaxy S7 which also uses the Qualcomm X12 was about twice as fast as the iPhone 7 running on the same network with the same modem chip.“The data indicates that the iPhone 7 is not taking advantage of all of Verizon’s network capabilities,” said Gabriel Tavridis, head of product at Twin Prime. “I doubt that Apple is throttling each bit on the Verizon iPhone, but it could have chosen to not enable certain features of the network chip.”Now, sources tell Re/code that it's true, Apple has limited the speed of the Qualcomm modem in the Verizon iPhone 7 to make it perform at about the same speed as the Intel modem. Apple supposedly did this for a simple reason: It wanted the cost savings and flexibility of having two chip sources but also wanted the different versions of the phone to be as similar as possible (to avoid angering AT&T and T-Mobile and their customers in the U.S., for example). Apple's official comment on the matter: “Every iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus meets or exceeds all of Apple’s wireless performance standards, quality metrics, and reliability testing,” Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller said. “In all of our rigorous lab tests based on wireless industry standards, in thousands of hours of real-world field testing, and in extensive carrier partner testing, the data shows there is no discernible difference in the wireless performance of any of the models.\"",

They are damaging customer good will, something that they were once known for. That could hurt them in the long run. Brand loyalty is for fools and stock holders. To any large corporation, loyalty is something to be abused. They cultivate it when they can do so cheaply, then spend it to increase profit, knowing that once people have picked as side their tolerance for abuse increases exponentially. With adopt rates slowing, the battle lines have been drawn, and Apple can reap the benefits of customer loyalty with less risk.

You can argue it is a design flaw, but don't expect to behave badly to your phone and expect someone else to take responsibility for your misbehave. It's a phone, not a crystal wine flute. The ability to withstand a fair degree of rough handling should be a given. Quote: You mean like anyone else would? Yes.",

      "text": "Reprints Loading the player... \nHere's your weekly Investing Action Plan: what you need to know as an investor for the coming week. \nThe start of the holiday shopping season headlines a shortened trading week, though a few highly rated companies like Palo Alto Networks ( PANW ) and Veeva Systems ( VEEV ) report, as well as Chinese internet leaders Sina ( SINA ) and Weibo ( WB ). And keep an eye on Apple ( AAPL ) and Facebook ( FB ) shares as U.S. tech heavyweights look to regroup after a sharp postelection sell-off. Stocks To Watch \nApple, Applied Materials ( AMAT ) and Texas Instruments ( TXN ) are flirting near buy points while Facebook is hitting resistance at its 200-day line. \nDespite some notable swings lately, Apple shares haven't risen high enough or fallen low enough to invalidate their 110.33 buy point. The stock closed Friday at 110.06. \nIBD 50 chip equipment maker Applied Materials is just 1.4% below a 31.17 buy point after Friday's fractional gain. The move came after the company reported mixed results with strong guidance late Thursday. \nMeanwhile, semiconductor maker Texas Instruments has broken out of a nearly four-month long flat base with a 72.28 buy point. Shares closed Friday up 0.7% at 72.60. Late last month, the company reported view-topping earnings but the midpoint of its revenue guidance was below views. \nThe social networking giant breached its 200-day line for the first time in nearly nine months on Nov. 10. Last Monday, the stock hit a four-month low, and it has been hitting resistance below the key 200-day line ever since. It retook that level intraday Friday but closed below it. The stock is now 12% below its late October high. Most tech stocks have been rebounding after getting hit after the election, but Facebook is notably struggling. Facebook warned in its last quarterly report of slowing ad revenue growth in 2017. \nRELATED : \nFacebook Will Buy Back $6 Billion In Shares As Stock Slide Continues Holiday Cheer \nBlack Friday sales will be the \"biggest ever,\" said Adobe in a late October data insights report, predicting 11.3% year-over-year growth to $3.05 billion in sales the day after Thanksgiving. Many retailers — including department stores Macy's ( M ), Kohl's ( KSS ) and J.C. Penney ( JCP ) — are optimistic about the broader holiday season, said Retail Metrics, highlighting positive holiday-quarter guidance from stores such as Target ( TGT ), Best Buy ( BBY ) and Lowe's ( LOW ). \nRELATED: \nTarget's Strong Digital Sales Add To Bullish Q3, Holiday Guidance Sina, Weibo, YY \nLeading Chinese internet companies report as the sector turns to more services and e-commerce to meet robust growth in mobile use. Web portal Sina reports Q3 results late Monday, and Wall Street sees EPS falling 10% to 35 cents, with revenue down 19% to $265.3 million. China's Twitter like ( TWTR ) microblogging site Weibo, which is majority-owned by Sina, reports Q3 earnings late Monday, and analysts see EPS doubling to 20 cents with revenue jumping 39% to $173.2 million. Also early Monday, social media platform YY ( YY ) is seen growing Q3 earnings by 10% in local currency and revenue by 30%. The reports come a week after Chinese internet giant Tencent ( TCEHY ) reported mixed results , though smartphone gaming revenue surged. \nRELATED: \nThe Tough Go Shopping: China Online Retail Shows Some Chart Strength Vips Slowdown? \nThe Chinese online discount retailer reports Q3 results after the market close Monday, and Wall Street sees EPS jumping 30% to 14 cents as revenue pops 41% in local currency to about $1.78 billion. A research note from M Science said data checks indicate that total order volume on Vips in Q3 \"showed a modest improvement\" from Q2. Vips ' ( VIPS ) report comes a week after Chinese e-commerce rival JD.com ( JD ) topped Q3 estimates . IBD'S TAKE: China has a number of internet giants, but if you want to take a measured approach in investing in those far-flung companies, a good idea is to check out Asian ETFs . Palo Alto Networks \nThe cybersecurity company reports fiscal Q1 earnings Monday, with analysts estimating profit will rise 51% to 53 cents per share, with revenue climbing 34% to $400 million. In fiscal Q1, analysts say higher spending by federal government customers could provide a lift. One earnings-call topic could be growing competition in the corporate firewall market with Cisco Systems ( CSCO ). \nIn August, Palo Alto's revenue guidance missed views, pressuring software security stocks. Palo Alto has also forecast a pickup in the software security market by April 2017. \nShares hit a new 10-month high on Thursday, solidly entering buy range from a flat base with a 163.11 buy point. But the stock dipped back below that level on Friday, dropping 1.7% to 161.35. The upcoming earnings report could fuel shares back into the buy zone, or past it, if it beats. \nRELATED: \nPalo Alto Networks Breaks Out Ahead Of Earnings, Price-Target Hiked Medtronic, Veeva \nMedical device company Medtronic ( MDT ) and life-sciences cloud-software developer Veeva Systems are slated to report quarterly earnings on Tuesday. Before the open, Medtronic is expected to report a 7.8% EPS increase to $1.11 on a 5.7% sale gain to $7.46 billion for its fiscal Q2 ended Oct. 31. In its report late Tuesday, analysts expect Veeva Systems to see EPS of 16 cents for its Q3, up 33%. Sales are expected to come in at $135.67 million, up 27%. \nVeeva shares are nearing a 42.68 buy point and it closed Friday at 41.55. \nRELATED: \nWill Earnings Options Trades Work Out For 3 Top-Rated Growth Names? Hewlett-Packard's Offspring \nThe two companies created by the breakup of tech giant Hewlett-Packard just over a year ago are scheduled to report fiscal Q4 earnings late Tuesday. Analysts expect HP Inc. ( HPQ ), which makes PCs and printers, to earn 36 cents a share excluding items, up 20%, on sales of $11.88 billion, down 3%. Meanwhile, enterprise information technology firm Hewlett Packard Enterprise ( HPE ) is seen earning 60 cents a share minus items, up 15%, on sales of $12.84 billion, down 5%. \nRELATED : \nHewlett Packard Enterprises Keeps Slimming, But Where's The Beef? Deere \nThe farm equipment giant reports fiscal Q4 results early Wednesday, and analysts see EPS plunging 63% to 40 cents, with revenue tumbling 40% to $3.58 billion as weak prices for top crops continue to weigh on demand for Deere 's ( DE ) products. The strong dollar and turmoil in Brazil have also hit its exports. But a pickup in the energy sector could lift its construction and forestry equipment unit. Still, the company has been able to make the most of its situation, and the stock is in buying territory. Jack in the Box, Cracker Barrel \nBurger chain Jack in the Box ( JACK ) reports fiscal Q4 results on Monday, and analysts expect EPS to grow by 42% to 88 cents with revenue up 13% to $398.71 million, amid growing consumer preference for higher-quality ingredients and falling grocery prices that have given diners more of a reason to eat in. Analysts have praised the company's mix of value offerings and menu shake-ups, but have also worried that competition from Yum Brands ' ( YUM ) Taco Bell and fast-casual restaurants could make its prospects more difficult. Shares of Jack in the Box are nearing a 102.78 buy point and closed Friday at 101.67. \nCracker Barrel ( CBRL ) reports fiscal Q1 results on Tuesday. Wall Street expects EPS of $1.84, up 8%, with revenue creeping up 1.6% to $713.73 million. \nRELATED: \nAre Fund Managers Set To Press 'Play' On This Restaurant Stock? Meaty Earnings \nTyson Foods ( TSN ) will announce earnings on Monday, and analysts expect the poultry producer's EPS to jump 41% to $1.17 but revenue to fall 3.7% to $9.4 billion. Tyson's shares fell off earlier this month after a New York Times report said consumers are overpaying for chicken. Hormel Foods ( HRL ) is on tap for Tuesday. The maker of Spam and Dinty Moore is seen earning 46 cents a share, up 24.3%, with sales rising 10% to $2.64 billion. \nRELATED: \nTyson, Chicken Stocks Broiled Over Price Collusion Lawsuit Retailers \nTeen retailer Urban Outfitters ( URBN ) and off-price store operator Burlington ( BURL ) will announce quarterly results Tuesday. Analysts see Urban Outfitters' earnings rising 4.8% to 44 cents with sales up 5.3% to $869.07 million. In a research note, Morgan Stanley downgraded Urban Outfitters and said it was cautious on the specialty retail industry due to apparel-price deflation and increased online competition. Burlington's EPS is expected to jump 32% to 33 cents with revenue up 7.5% to $1.32 billion. Economic Indicators \nOn Tuesday, October existing-home sales will come out, and on Wednesday, October durable goods and new home sales are due, along with consumer sentiment for November, and the minutes of the Federal Reserve's Nov. 1-2 policy meeting. On Friday, October import and export data will be released. Share this: Related news",

      "text": "– A + McLaren CEO admits to talks with Apple, but no bid was made By Neil Hughes\nSaturday, November 19, 2016, 12:57 pm PT (03:57 pm ET)\nOfficials from Apple met with premium automaker McLaren, but the discussions never went as far as a bid, the CEO of the sports car company has revealed in a new interview.\nMcLaren Chief Executive Mike Flewitt disclosed to Reuters that his company has received a number of bids, but none from Apple. Word first surfaced in September suggesting Apple was in talks to buy the high-performance car builder.\n\"They visited, we talked,\" Flewitt said. \"We talked about what they did. We talked about what we did. They toured. It never matured to a definitive proposition.\"\nThe comments would seem to refute earlier rumors, suggesting Apple started negotiations to purchase McLaren for between £1 billion and £1.5 billion ($1.3 billion to $2 billion). At the time, it was claimed that discussions had been ongoing for months.\nMcLaren is known for custom luxury sports car builds, and runs an advanced technologies group that feeds designs to its own Formula One racing team. The company built 1654 vehicles in 2015, and generated £450m ($585 million) in revenue from the sales.\nMcLaren Automotive is headquartered in the McLaren Production Centre at the McLaren Technology Campus in Woking, Surrey. All of its products are built by hand, with little or no automation involved in the process.\nThe existence of Apple's automotive project dubbed \"Project Titan\" first began to surface in early 2015 . Soon after, AppleInsider discovered the automotive project was being run out of a top-secret facility in Sunnyvale, Calif.\nThe Titan team was at one time said to number above 1,000 , including workers pulled in from other departments and specialists poached from automotive industry heavyweights.\nIn early September , Apple was said to have laid off dozens of workers from the as-yet unannounced Apple Car project. The layoffs were said to be because of a shift away from a whole-car approach, and towards a more specific software and control focus.\nSince then, Apple is said to have set an internal deadline for late 2017 to assess the progress of its in-house self-driving technology. At that point, the company is expected to decide whether to pursue building its own vehicle, or to partner with an existing automaker.",

      "text": "iPhone \"Touch Disease\" Is Real Apple Admitted Touch Disease Is Real, But In The Worst Way November 19, 2016 , 9:15 PM Photographed by Erin Yamagata. Few things are more frustrating than an iPhone on the fritz. Case in point: the dreaded touch disease, which generally manifests as a flickering gray bar atop the screen and ultimately renders the device's touchscreen useless. The issue is widely reported by iPhone 6 Plus owners and often presents itself gradually, becoming worse over time until, eventually, the screen loses responsiveness altogether. Cue rage-filled scream .Despite widespread customer complaints and a class-action lawsuit , Apple has not acknowledged the problem — until now. The company, which previously refused to help iPhone owners affected by \"touch disease\" unless the affected phone in question was still under warranty — a rarity for devices that are now two generations old — has launched a new repair program for the widely reported issue. But that doesn't mean Apple is taking responsibility for it. According to Apple, which will now fix your infected phone for a service price of $149 through its Multi-Touch Repair Program , \"touch disease\" is not a design flaw, but rather a result of \"being dropped multiple times on a hard surface and then incurring further stress.\" However, the folks over at The Next Web and iFixit couldn't disagree more and argue that the problem stems from a shoddy controller chip attachment.

      "text": "November 19, 2016 AT 6:21 pm Apple to offer free ‘Hour of Code’ workshops for full week @codeorg @AppleStore \nApple to offer free ‘Hour of Code’ workshops for full week . \nApple has opened up registration for its Hour of Code workshops in partnership with Code.org. This year, Apple will host Hour of Code workshops every day for one week — in conjunction with Computer Science Education Week — from December 5 to December 11 at all of its nearly 500 Apple retail stores across the world. In the past, Apple offered just one day’s worth of workshops. \nApple’s workshops will teach the basics of CS, as well as offer an introduction to Swift Playgrounds, an iPad app for learning how to write Swift code. Apple has also created some tools for educators to help them bring Hour of Code into schools and community centers, including a guide with coding lesson ideas and group activities. \n“Hour of Code embodies our vision for Apple stores as a place for the community to gather, learn and be entertained,” Apple SVP of Retail Angela Ahrendts said in a press release. “We’re proud to introduce the Swift Playgrounds app into the workshops and honored to again work side-by-side with Code.org on this incredibly important initiative. Hour of Code is one of the absolute highlights of the year for both our teams and the families that visit our stores.” \n… \nAs part of Apple’s $100 million commitment to provide underserved schools with technology, Apple is also making it possible for ConnectED schools to host their own Hour of Code workshops. \nIn the past year, Apple has stepped up its commitment to education. In June, Apple launched coding camps for kids in its stores and donated 54,500 iPads to students and teachers in September. \nApple has participated in Code.org’s Hour of Code since 2014, but it’s not the only one participating in Hour of Code. Earlier this week, Microsoft announced its Minecraft-inspired coding tutorial for students and teachers.",

I thought it was a good idea, it's fun to see what people ask and the different answers--you can do anything, really.So, here is the idea... I will ask a question, the next person who posts answers that question, then asks a question of their own. The more people who get involved, the more interesting it will get.(you don't answer all the questions--unless you really want to, of course--just the most recent one. If two people post at the same time (so one question gets two answers and one none, feel free to edit to answer the latest, and the unanswered one, before posting your own question ) ETA: or just go with the flow, we're doing good getting all the questions answered eventually!Really hope that makes sense (if not, keep reading, you'll get the hang of it)Question: Do you have any pets?",

      "text": "  \n(Apple) Apple AirPods are expected to come out in November or December. \nApple previously announced that its flagship smartphone, iPhone 7, will no longer support the standard 3.5-mm headphone jack as it will start to introduce its wireless headphones, the AirPods. New reports reveal that the highly anticipated headphones will come out before this month ends. \nAccording to reports , Apple Airpods may be purchased sooner than expected. Apparently, French retailer Fnac has started the pre-orders for the wireless headset and has listed its shipping and release date on Nov. 30. \nDuring the Apple September event, it can be noted that the tech giant is still making sure that the AirPods will be ready for the users. An Apple spokesperson even told TechCrunch, \"The early response to AirPods has been incredible. We don't believe in shipping a product before it's ready, and we need a little more time before AirPods are ready for our customers.\" \nWhile the French retailer has already listed the upcoming headset for a release this month, according to other sources , a retailer called Alza from Czech Republic has scheduled the launch of AirPods in December 2016. However, the site has since removed the post, but it still currently accepts pre-orders. Advertisement \nHowever, there have been numerous speculations and predictions that the Apple Airpods will most likely begin mass production in December and will go on sale in January next year. \nAccording to Apple , the wireless headsets will be priced at $159. The AirPods are a must-have for those who are using or are considering to purchase the iPhone 7. The headset uses the Apple W1 chip, which contains optical sensors and a motion accelerometer. Through its wireless technology, the chip automatically routes the audio and microphone when you put one or both AirPods in your ears. \nSince it is wireless, it has to be charged. Apple claims that in one charge, the headset could last for 5 hours. More details on the upcoming Apple AirPods will be announced soon. Copyright © 2016 Ecumenical News",

      "text": "Apple has a problem, and they are trying to make it ours.\nThe touch displays on a large number of iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus models have stopped working reliably and exhibit a flickering gray bar across the top of the screen. Dubbed “Touch Disease,” it’s the number one complaint at the Apple Stores, representing about 11% of all iPhone issues. It’s also been detected by independent repair shops. Currently, it’s only been an issue that effects the 2-year old line, the iPhone 6 and 6+, and not the 6S or 6S+.\nAccording to iFixit , one New Orleans repair shop found that up to 100 units a month exhibit this touch issue, and another repair shop owner in Missouri thinks that this is a ticking time bomb that will eventually effect most of this generation of iPhones.\nAfter a prolonged silence, Apple responded this week to the growing number of complaints and blamed the problem on their customers. They claim that it’s caused by an excessive number of times that the phone is dropped on a hard surface by its owner. They have offered to repair the defective iPhone 6+ phones for $149. They have not yet addressed the iPhone 6.\nAs one who has developed many hardware products, including Apple products, I find Apple’s explanation almost laughable. During development, consumer electronic products go through a battery of industry-standard tests to ensure their product will perform reliably for many years, typically five years or more. Products need to pass testing that drops, vibrates, and exposes them to a range of extreme temperatures and heavy physical abuse. All moving parts are exercised, such as buttons and switches, to simulate many years of use. This is standard practice used by all reputable companies.\nFor a failure to occur on a 2-year-old product in such a large number of units, it’s caused by a manufacturing defect, a design defect or a bad part, not by the customer. Such a defect might take a long time to show up, induced perhaps by heavy use, but it should not be blamed on the customer for using the phone in a normal manner.\nhttps://pjmedia.com/lifestyle/2016/11/19/apple-offers-program-to-fix-iphones-with-touch-disease-class-action-suit-follows/\nprevious Page 1 of 2 next View as single page",

      "text": "Apple's Ive and Newson unveil unadorned fir trees for Claridge's Christmas installation By Saturday, November 19, 2016, 05:34 pm PT (08:34 pm ET) Apple CDO Jony Ive and part time company collaborator Marc Newson on Saturday unveiled their awaited interpretation of Claridge's Christmas tree in London. The installation, which is quite literally a small grove of completely bare fir trees, once again prove the pair of industrial designers to be masters of austerity. Source: Wallpaper Clairdge's Christmas tree installation is something of a tradition in London, and for many marks the start of the holiday season. Every year the swanky hotel commissions a world-renowned designer to reimagine the festive arboreal symbol in their own style. Last year it was Christopher Bailey from Burberry, and before that Claridge's called on Dolce & Gabbana, Christian Dior, Dalian and others. For 2016, Ive and Newson had their turn and delivered not one, but a thicket of unadorned fir trees , reports Wallpaper . Just as Apple's spartan device designs are supported and enhanced by powerful hardware and software, so are the trees augmented by a technologically advanced set design. Ive and Newson collaborated with British set designer Michael Howells to create a winter wonderland. Large 12-foot tall light boxes light black-and-white images of birch trees, creating a sense of depth. Cast models of Scots pine intermingle and give way to a ceiling of natural green pine. Strategically placed lighting choreographed to an acoustic showcase of forest sounds filters through the branches, cycling from \\sunrise to moon-filled night, while faux snow covers the floor and the odd tree stump. \"Our aim was to create an all-enveloping magical experience that celebrates our enormous respect for tradition while recognizing our excitement about the future and things to come,\" the pair said. \"There are few things more pure and beautiful than nature, so that was our starting point, layering various iterations of organic forms with technology.\" Set off among the grove of real, fake and imagined trees is a small sapling, bathed in pure light from above. The startling juxtaposition is intentional, the designers said, as the growing fir represents the future. Topics:",

      "text": "If your iPhone 6 Plus suffers from a flickering screen that's become unresponsive to your touch, Apple has a fix for you. But it'll cost you $149.\n\nApple today (Nov. 17) launched a repair program for iPhone 6 Plus models that have flickering displays or problems registering multi-touch inputs. If your phone is otherwise in working order without a cracked or broken screen, Apple says it will repair affect iPhone 6 Pluses for $149.\n\nThis iFixit image shows the gray flicker that's a sympton of Touch Disease. The problem with flickering screens has been a source of internet speculation for some time now. Back in August, iFixit reported that it was seeing a rise in the number of iPhone 6 and 6 Plus devices suffering from a gray flicker at the top of the display and an unresponsive tuouchscreen. This iFixit image shows the gray flicker that's a sympton of Touch Disease. More MORE: 23 Essential iPhone 7 Tips and Tricks \nAt the time, iFixit blamed what it called the \"Touch Disease\" problem on pair of touchscreen controller chips found on the logic board of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. As you may recall, those models were prone to bending, and iPhone repair specialists suggested that the added stress on the logic board was causing problems with the affected sensors.\n\nApple, it seems, does not entirely agree with that diagnosis. In its notice announcing the Multi-Touch repair program, the company said the iPhone 6 Plus might exhibit these problems \"after being dropped multiple times on a hard surface and then incurring further stress on the device.\" In other words, Apple thinks wear-and-tear is the culprit and not a design flaw, which is probably why you'll have to pay that $149 repair cost.\n\nThe repair program only covers the iPhone 6 Plus, though some users have reported problems with the smaller iPhone 6 as well. (In its August report on the problem, iFixit said the problem occured more frequently in Plus models, since it was more prone to bending.)\n\nIf you already paid to have your iPhone 6 Plus fixed, Apple says it will reimburse you for any costs you incurred above $149. Apple says affected iPhone 6 Plus owners should contact an authorized Apple service provider or go to the Apple Store for the repair.\n\nThree iPhone owners filed a class-action suit against Apple over their phone's touchscreens in August.\nSee also : Worst Gadget Recalls of All Time Here Are the 10 Best Smartphones Available Upgrading to the iPhone 7?

In many cases, iPhone users have complained the touchscreen will entirely stop working for several months. \nSAN FRANCISCO — Apple is recognizing that “Touch Disease” is a thing. \nThe tech company is rolling out a repair program to fix iPhone 6 Plus devices with unresponsive touchscreen features. \nThe term “Touch Disease” refers to the touchscreen issues that surface after the phone undergoes stress, like being dropped on the floor several times. In many cases, iPhone users have complained the touchscreen will entirely stop working for several months. \nIn August, repair site iFixit discovered that the issue stemmed from faulty chips inside the devices. When the phone is dropped or bent, the chips become loose. At the time, iFixit called the issue “Touch Disease”— and it was quickly adopted by the internet. \nNow, the company is willing to repair affected devices for $149 — as long as your screen isn’t cracked and the phone is in working order. \nApple said on its website it “determined that some iPhone 6 Plus devices may exhibit display flickering or multi-touch issues after being dropped multiple times on a hard surface and then incurring further stress on the device.” \nAlthough some iPhone 6 users have also reported the issue, Apple’s fix only applies to the larger-sized iPhone 6 Plus. \nThe company added it will reimburse people if they already fixed devices through Apple service providers for more than $149. \nFollowing widespread reports of the problem, “Touch Disease”— on both sizes of the iPhone 6 — has accounted for up to 22% of repairs at Apple Stores, according to tech site Apple Insider. \nApple is facing class action lawsuits in California, Utah, and Canada over “Touch Disease.” The complaints allege Apple knew about the faulty touchscreens ",

      "text": "This 4-in-1 MicroSD Card Reader is What Every Apple User Needs – Really   19, 2016 \nNow that Apple has made it clear what they think of ports and SD cards (they’re not fans), we’re left to figure out how to get files from storage cards to MacBooks and iPhones through other means. Here’s the best kind of other means — a company called iDragon has made a 4-in-1 card reader that will work with just about any mobile device. \nThe star-shaped accessory has a USB Type-C connector, of the sort required by the new MacBook and MacBook Pro, plus most premium Android phones released in 2016. There’s a Lightning connector for iPhones, too, plus a Micro USB connector to suit older Android devices. Finally, there’s a USB 2.0 port — slow, but we’ll take it. The card reader is right above the USB port. \nIt’s a simple little accessory that can be used with almost every mobile device released in the past few years. If you love taking pictures with a fully featured DSLR camera and like to free up those SD cards by offloading pictures to your mobile device or cloud storage, something like this could be pretty handy — it helps that this card reader is small and slim, too. The transfer speeds will be pretty slow no matter which connector you use, but if you’re not in a rush, it looks like a handy little gadget. \niDragon is a wholesaler, so while you can’t get this card reader directly from them, we should start seeing it available from resellers soon. It’s also a fairly new company based out of China — for now, we’re mostly seeing eBay shops stock iDragon products, and while that doesn’t exactly inspire confidence, we are seeing mostly positive ratings for those eBay sellers. We’re not seeing this reader for sale anywhere yet, but hopefully that changes soon!",

      "text": "BERKELEY (KPIX 5) — A group of fast-moving thieves have robbed the Apple store in Berkeley for the third time in less than 2 weeks.\nPolice say the group is in their late teens or early 20s. \nThe last incident was on Wednesday morning. They rushed into the store on Fourth Street and stole about $100,000 worth of merchandise.\nAuthorities are working with other agencies in the area to see if the thefts are part of a larger pattern.\n“They’re not there for very long, it’s a property crime focused theft and we know what they’re there for,” said Sergeant Andrew Frankel. “We are working with Apple as well as the business district on Fourth street to see what we can do to stem that type of crime.”\nNo one was hurt in any of the robberies.\nThe city now has additional officers out patrolling Fourth Street, as well as the holiday-related events going on around the city.\n",

      "title": "McLaren Confirms Talks With Apple 'Never Matured to Definitive Proposition'",
      "text": "In late September, the Financial Times reported Apple was considering a full takeover of McLaren Automotive or a strategic investment in the British supercar maker.\n\nThe New York Times and Bloomberg separately reported talks were underway as well, noting Apple was more likely to make a large investment in McLaren rather than buy it.\n\nTwo months later, it now turns out those reports were accurate. In an interview with Reuters, McLaren Automotive CEO Mike Flewitt confirmed McLaren was in discussions with Apple, but he said the talks never progressed towards a definitive proposition. He also ruled out a takeover bid from Apple.\n\n\"There wasn't a bid from Apple,\" said Flewitt. \"They visited. We talked. We talked about what they did. We talked about what we did. They toured. It never matured to a definitive proposition,\" he said.\n\nMcLaren previously said it was \"not in discussion with Apple in respect of any potential investment,\" a seemingly purposefully vague statement that did not rule out discussions between the companies entirely. Financial Times reporter Tim Bradshaw rightly stood by his story despite McLaren's statement.\n\nApple's interest in McLaren may have diminished as the iPhone maker's ambitions reportedly no longer include building its own car \"for now.\" Under the leadership of Bob Mansfield, Apple's automotive team has reportedly shifted its focus towards developing an underlying system and technologies for autonomous vehicles.\n\nMcLaren, headquartered in Woking, Surrey, manufactures high-performance sports cars, including the P1 and F1 models commonly used for Formula One racing. The carmaker produced just 1,654 vehicles last year, some costing as much as $1 million apiece. Apple marketing chief Phil Schiller is said to own a McLaren.\n\nMcLaren has a Formula One team itself that competes under the name McLaren Honda, winning more F1 Grand Prix races than any other team since 1966. Formula One itself was sold to U.S.-based Liberty Media for $4.4 billion in August. McLaren Automotive and McLaren Racing are subsidiaries of McLaren Technology Group.\n\n(Thanks, OllyW!)Related Roundup: Apple Car\nTag: McLaren\n\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

Well, that’s a good way to hedge your bet. When we’re all dead, we’ll look back on this and laugh.\n\n\n\nThe deal makes so much sense you have to wonder why Apple didn't buy Harman.\n\nTo read this article in full or to leave a comment, please click here",

      "text": "Two months after launch, select models of Apple 's ( AAPL ) 10th-generation smartphone, the iPhone 7, are still hard to find at retail, Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster said in a report Friday.\n\"We checked 134 Apple Stores in the U.S. for in-store iPhone 7 availability (and) 47% of (specific models) that we checked were available for in-store pickup compared to 40% a month ago,\" Munster said in a report. \"By comparison, last year the iPhone 6S was at 100% availability at this time. The vast majority of available devices remained iPhone 7 vs. iPhone 7 Plus.\"\nThe situation is much worse in China, with just 16% iPhone 7 availability vs. 12% a month ago, based on data from 96 China Unicom ( CHU ) stores, Munster said.\nIBD'S TAKE: Apple stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 46, meaning it has been outperformed by 54% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months. Apple stock has formed a flat base with a possible buy point of 118.79.\n\"At this point, we believe it's unlikely iPhone reaches supply-demand equilibrium by the end of the December quarter, consistent with Apple's comments on the September-quarter earnings call,\" he said. \"We remain comfortable with our estimate of 3% iPhone growth in the December quarter, and expect tight supply to be a slight positive for March-quarter guidance as demand shifts from December to March.\"\nPiper's survey of U.S. Apple stores found that 91% of iPhone 7 models were available, but just 3% of iPhone 7 Plus models. A month ago, 67% of iPhone 7 models were available and 10% of iPhone 7 Plus models were available, Munster said.\nThe iPhone 7 series comes in two versions: the standard iPhone 7 with a 4.7-inch screen and the iPhone 7 Plus with a 5.5-inch screen. Each version comes in four colors with three possible data storage configurations: 32, 128 and 256 gigabytes. Premium versions of the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus are available in a fifth color, \"jet black,\" with two storage options: 128 and 256 GB.\nApple stock rose a fraction to 110.04 on the stock market today .",

      "text": "Nov 16, 2016 Worldwide iOS App Store App Removals Increased 238% in October \nWhen Apple announced what many considered a long-overdue culling of broken and unsupported apps from the App Store two months ago, the September 7 deadline to shape up or face removal came and went without any apparent action on the platform holder’s part. While it may have taken a few more weeks to be felt, Sensor Tower research has revealed that app removals from the store increased approximately 238 percent in October over the monthly average for 2016 through last month. Read on for more on how this compared to previous months, and to learn which categories were most affected by what may be just the first round of removals. Games Led Removed Apps Considerably \nAs illustrated by the chart below, there were approximately 47,300 apps removed from the App Store last month . This was 3.4 times the monthly average of 14,000 for January through September . All of these figures include apps removed by Apple and their publishers, but the dramatic increase in removals just weeks after the deadline passed can only be the result of Cupertino’s custodians dropping the axe on what they determined to be faulty abandonware. \nBreaking down our 47,300 figure by category, we found that the App Store’s largest group of apps, Games, was unsurprisingly the most affected at approximately 28 percent of apps removed last month. Entertainment and Books were nearly tied for a distant second at 8.99 and 8.96 percent, respectively. Rounding out the top five most-affected categories were Education at 7 percent and Lifestyle at 6 percent. \nWe don’t suspect this is the end of Apple’s fall cleaning, something that comes after years of complaints from users regarding broken and sometimes deceptive apps. In fact, as the App Store continues its growth to more than five million apps by 2020 , we may very well see this become a yearly—if not ongoing—part of app publishing within the iOS ecosystem. \nSensor Tower’s Store Intelligence platform is an Enterprise level offering.

One source told the newspaper that production costs would more than double. \nApple and Foxconn did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \nIn 2011, Steve Jobs reportedly scoffed at the idea of bringing iPhone production to the US when asked by President Obama what it would take to make that happen. \n\"Those jobs aren't coming back,\" Jobs said at the time. Related Articles Report: Fire Breaks Out at Foxconn's iPhone Manufacturing Facility \nThe following year, Apple CEO Tim Cook announced plans to bring some parts of Mac production to the US ; Apple reportedly invested more than $100 million as part of that effort. \nThis isn't the first time Foxconn has considered setting up shop in the US. The manufacturing giant in 2012 confirmed that it was looking to expand operations in North America , but that has not yet happened. \n\"We are looking at doing more manufacturing in the US because, in general, customers want more to be done there,\" Louis Woo, a Foxconn spokesman, told Bloomberg Businessweek at the time.",

The concept smartphone was unveiled in China early this month. By: Tech Desk | Published:November 20, 2016 2:16 pm Xiaomi’s Mi Mix, a concept smartphone was unveiled in China early this month and comes with a 91.3 per cent screen-to-body ratio. \nThe concept of edge-to-edge display has taken the smartphone industry by storm with big names such as Apple and Samsung working on the same for their next flagship devices. Apple’s iPhone 8 which is set to launch in 2017 is rumoured to sport a bezel-free design, while the Galaxy S8 is said to come with a bezel-less display and no home button in the front. However, the first smartphone to be launched with an edge-to-edge display is Xiaomi ’s Mi Mix. The concept smartphone was unveiled in China early this month and comes with a 91.3 per cent screen-to-body ratio. Mi Mix has a 6.4-inch display which is edge-to-edge, and Xiaomi says this will come with a custom 17:9 ratio aspect. If reports are anything to be believed, Huawei and Meizu are working on smartphones with bezel-less design as well.

Its got extremely thin bezels and features a screen-to-body ratio of 91.3 per cent screen. Xiaomi claims the company is using high-grade ceramic for the smartphone. Xiaomi is using “seamless connectors to fuse Mi Mix’s body without any external adhesives”. The front camera in Mi Mix is placed at the bottom, which will rotate on its own when a user wants to take selfies. Xiaomi Mi Mix looks straight out of the future with edge-to-edge display. \nHowever, the device didn’t prove to be durable when a user in China accidentally dropped a testing unit of Mi Mix. The smartphone met the same fate as expected from any other smartphone with a ceramic body. The ceramic frame of the smartphone simply came off and the display got visible cracks on it. The user posted a picture of the damaged unit, which shows the device has a dent on upper left corner suggesting Mi Mix fell diagonally. Going by the picture, Mi Mix scores on style, but compromises on a sturdy build. \nMust Read: Xiaomi Mi Mix breaks easy, and this picture proves it \nSpecifications of Mi Mix include: a 6.4-inch edgeless display, full ceramic body, and Snapdragon 821 processor with 4GB RAM + 128GB storage.

It is available at 3,499 yuan. \nApple iPhone 8 Apple iPhone 8 is highly-anticipated given the Cupertino giant went ahead with only minor upgrades for its latest iPhone 7 series. \nThe year 2017 is supposed to mark the 10th anniversary of iPhone (the first iPhone was introduced by Steve Jobs in 2007) and Apple is expected to bring about a radical change in the design of its next iPhone. According to a report from the Barclays Research analysts, the iPhone 8 will sport a curved, bezel-free design next year in 2017. \nThe Barclays Research analysts note iPhone 8’s borderless design will mean these phones will sport the same size as the current generation iPhones. However, Apple will introduce a 5-inch and 5.8-inch display version, which is bigger than the current 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus series. The iPhone 8 Plus version will come with an OLED display, and Apple is relying on Samsung and LG, along with Foxconn -owned Sharp for this in 2018. \nApple iPhone 8 is said to sport a new design and will come in all-glass body.

Related Content The iPhone design flaw which leads to screen paralysis \nTo qualify, however, the device needs to be in \"working order\" with a screen that is \"not cracked or broken\". \n\"Apple has determined that some iPhone 6 Plus devices may exhibit display flickering or Multi-Touch issues after being dropped multiple times on a hard surface and then incurring further stress on the device,\" the company said. Advertisement \nThe company has also agreed to reimburse iPhone 6 Plus owners who paid for repairs related to the issue using Apple or Apple Authorised Service Providers. \niFixit co-founder Kyle Wiens​ previously told Fairfax Media that because of a design flaw in the iPhone 6 Plus, it was likely that many of the popular devices would eventually succumb to the condition. A grey flickering bar across the top of the iPhone screen is a symptom of the so-called \"touch disease\". Photo: iFixit \nThe issue was caused by what Mr Wiens called \"design anorexia\" - the imperative to make smartphones ever thinner and lighter. \nIt relates to the 2014 \"bend-gate\" incident , when some iPhone 6 Plus owners found that their devices had been bent out of shape after carrying them in their back pockets. iFixit's co-founder and repair advocate, Kyle Wiens. Photo: iFixit \nBending or frequent dropping of the phone can cause the touch-screen controller chips to be dislodged from their mounts on the phone's logic board. \nApple subsequently upgraded the quality of the aluminium used for the casing on the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus in what was seen as a tacit admission that the material used in the earlier model was too flimsy. \n​Earlier this year, a number of aggrieved iPhone 6 Plus owners in the US filed a class action suit , accusing Apple of fraud and violating California consumer protection laws and seeking unspecified damages.

      "text": "Claridge Hotel Reveals Festive Installation by Apple's Jony Ive Sunday November 20, 2016 3:54 AM PST by Tim Hardwick Apple design chief Jony Ive and longtime collaborator Marc Newson's take on the London hotel Claridge Christmas tree has been revealed – and perhaps not surprisingly, there's not a bauble in sight. The Mayfair festive landmark has been drawing crowds since 2009, when notable designers began creating the seasonal decoration each year. But Ive and Newson's interpretation takes the tradition to another level – albeit a minimalist one – by transforming the hotel's lobby into a natural grove of unadorned birch trees as part of a cycling light and sound installation. The designers had this to say: Our aim was to create an all-enveloping magical experience that celebrates our enormous respect for tradition while recognising our excitement about the future and things to come. There are few things more pure and beautiful than nature, so that was our starting point, layering various iterations of organic forms with technology. Design and style magazine Wallpaper described a scene in which a series of vast four meter-high light boxes line the walls, illuminating black-and-white images of snow-capped silver birch trees, against which \"towering cast models of Scots pine rise to a canopy of natural green pine\". The accompanying forest soundscape begins with a dawn chorus and features owls, nightingales, sparrows, and foxes. Synced to the audio is specially choreographed lighting that cycles from sunrise to nighttime, creating a dappled effect in the installation space. At the center of the grove, a smaller sapling tree appears to grow in the transitions of light, which the designers describe as a symbol of the future. The installation is open to the public and free to enter, and will remain in London's Claridge hotel throughout the festive season.",

      "text": "Aside from the election of Donald Trump, the silliest thing that happened this month might have been the unveiling of Apple’s photo book, titled “Designed by Apple in California.” Featuring 450 high-quality images of Apple’s own products, the book can be yours for a measly $299 (or $199 for the small edition).\nSEE ALSO: The best TV deals to watch for on Black Friday 2016\nSilly things are Stephen Colbert’s speciality, so you probably won’t be surprised to learn that The Late Show had a short sketch about the ultra-expensive Apple book on Thursday night, lampooning both its content and its price:\nLike any great Apple reveal video, The Late Show’s parody highlights the unique features of the Apple book, such as “touch page technology,” which allows you to swipe your finger on a page to turn it, and sequential numbering, which means that… the pages are in order. Page 3 comes after 4, which comes before 5.\nOh, and in case you think this is a bit over the top, here’s an actual Quote: on Apple’s website from chief design officer Jony Ive about the book:\n“The idea of genuinely trying to make something great for humanity was Steve’s motivation from the beginning, and it remains both our ideal and our goal as Apple looks to the future. This archive is intended to be a gentle gathering of many of the products the team has designed over the years. We hope it brings some understanding to how and why they exist, while serving as a resource for students of all design disciplines.”\n“Gentle gathering.” What a world we live in.\nTrending right now:\nAmazon is actually going to sell cars online Today’s your last chance to get a NES Classic 9 paid iPhone apps on sale for free for a limited time See the original version of this article on BGR.com",

      "title": "Nov 20 - iPhone Secretly Sends Your Call History to Apple",
      "text": "Nov 20 - iPhone Secretly Sends Your Call History to Apple In the f!ght against encryption, Apple has positioned itself as a staunch defender of its user privacy by refusing the federal officials to provide encryption backdoors into its products, as well as implementing better encryption for its products. However, a new report from a security firm suggests Apple's online syncing service iCloud secretly stores logs of its users' private information for as long as four months  even when iCloud backup is switched off. Russian digital forensics firm Elcomsoft discovered that Apple's mobile devices automatically send its users' call history to the company's servers if iCloud is enabled, and stored that data for up to four months. And it turns out that there is no way for iCloud users to stop this phone call syncing service unless they completely disable the cloud synchronization feature. Elcomsoft, which sells software to extract data from Apple's iCloud backups and works with police and intelligence agencies, says the company should tell its customers exactly what personal data it is backing upand should give users an easy option to turn it off. If you own an iPhone or iPad, your device automatically collects and transmits private information  including call history, phone numbers, dates, the length of calls, missed calls, FaceTime calls  to iCloud if it is enabled. Not just this, your iPhone also send information collected from other third-party applications that use VoIP service, including WhatsApp, Skype, Viber, and Facebook Messenger.\"We discovered that yet another piece of data is stored in the cloud for no apparent reason,\" Elcomsoft's Oleg Afonin writes. \"Using an iPhone and have an active iCloud account? Your calls will sync with iCloud whether you want it or not.\" Apple stores this information for as long as 4 months, and while the company encrypts everything, Privacy buffs note that Apple could become an easy target for law enforcement seeking access to user data. The security firm also raised doubts over possible government surveillance that could be performed. What's more? Elcomsoft says that the logs are uploaded from any iPhone which has iCloud Drive enabled and that this effectively allows spying on you \"without you even knowing.\"\"Syncing call logs happens almost in real time, though sometimes only in a few hours,\" says Elcomsoft CEO Vladimir Katalov. \"But all you need to have is just iCloud Drive enabled, and there is no way to turn that syncing off, apart from just disabling iCloud Drive completely. In that case, many applications will stop working or lose iCloud-related features completely.\" However, Apple says there is no reason to worry. Yes, the company says there is nothing wrong with its feature, as it is simply part of its iCloud service that allows its users to access their calls from any of their devices that use an Apple ID. Moreover, Apple guarantees that all of its customers' data is encrypted and two-factor authentication provides an extra layer of security for blocking any hacking attempts from hackers or law enforcement. Here's what the company said in the statement:\"We offer call history syncing as a convenience to our customers so that they can return calls from any of their devices. Apple is deeply committed to safeguarding our customers' data. That is why we give our customers the ability to keep their data private. Device data is encrypted with a user's passcode, and access to iCloud data including backups requires the user's Apple ID and password. Apple recommends all customers select strong passwords and use two-factor authentication.\" So, as long as you keep your Apple ID to yourself and use a strong password, you do not need to freak out over this report of your call logs being \"secretly\" sent to Apple. The solution? At the time, the only way to prevent Apple from logging your call history is to simply disable iCloud Drive altogether. Besides this, you can also manually delete every call entry from your iPhone or iPad, and this will automatically remove the data from iCloud on the next backup. Apple is not the only company that syncs its users' call logs to the cloud. Android smartphones also sync its users' call logs to the cloud as part of backups. Windows 10 mobile devices also sync call logs by default with other Windows 10 devices that use the same Microsoft account.",

      "text": "If your iPhone 6 Plus suffers from a flickering screen that's become unresponsive to your touch, Apple has a fix for you. But it'll cost you $149.\nApple today (Nov. 17) launched a repair program for iPhone 6 Plus models that have flickering displays or problems registering multi-touch inputs. If your phone is otherwise in working order without a cracked or broken screen, Apple says it will repair affect iPhone 6 Pluses for $149.\nThis iFixit image shows the gray flicker that's a sympton of Touch Disease. The problem with flickering screens has been a source of internet speculation for some time now. Back in August, iFixit reported that it was seeing a rise in the number of iPhone 6 and 6 Plus devices suffering from a gray flicker at the top of the display and an unresponsive tuouchscreen.\nView photos\nThis iFixit image shows the gray flicker that's a sympton of Touch Disease. More MORE: 23 Essential iPhone 7 Tips and Tricks\nAt the time, iFixit blamed what it called the \"Touch Disease\" problem on pair of touchscreen controller chips found on the logic board of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. As you may recall, those models were prone to bending, and iPhone repair specialists suggested that the added stress on the logic board was causing problems with the affected sensors.\nApple, it seems, does not entirely agree with that diagnosis. In its notice announcing the Multi-Touch repair program, the company said the iPhone 6 Plus might exhibit these problems \"after being dropped multiple times on a hard surface and then incurring further stress on the device.\" In other words, Apple thinks wear-and-tear is the culprit and not a design flaw, which is probably why you'll have to pay that $149 repair cost.\nThe repair program only covers the iPhone 6 Plus, though some users have reported problems with the smaller iPhone 6 as well. (In its August report on the problem, iFixit said the problem occured more frequently in Plus models, since it was more prone to bending.)\nIf you already paid to have your iPhone 6 Plus fixed, Apple says it will reimburse you for any costs you incurred above $149. Apple says affected iPhone 6 Plus owners should contact an authorized Apple service provider or go to the Apple Store for the repair.\nThree iPhone owners filed a class-action suit against Apple over their phone's touchscreens in August.\nSee also : Worst Gadget Recalls of All Time Here Are the 10 Best Smartphones Available Upgrading to the iPhone 7?

      "text": "Apple Safari \nThe Apple Watch is a smartwatch that operates as a small wearable computing device worn on a user's wrist. The Apple Watch was officially announced on September 9th, 2014, with availability of the new device expected in early 2015. \nPricing for the Apple Watch will start at $349. While most analysts expected the device to be released under the Apple iWatch moniker, Apple surprised many by deviating from the \"i\" pattern of naming its new devices like the iPod , iPhone and iPad . How Does the Apple Watch Work? \nThe Apple Watch is designed to pair, or connect, with another Apple iOS device like the iPhone to push Apple Watch-specific content to the device. In fact, users will need to have an iPhone 5 or later connected to the smartwatch in order to access Apple Watch's full set of features. \nThere are three styles of the initial Apple Watch available: a stainless steel standard version, an Apple Watch Sport model, and an 18K gold Apple Watch Edition. Each style comes in one of two sizes: 38mm (1.49 inches) or 42mm (1.65 inches). Features in the Apple Watch \nThe Apple Watch sports a Retina display protected by a Sapphire screen, and it utilizes both a touch screen and a Digital Crown wheel for operating the interface. \nAs far as features, the Apple Watch has the ability to make phone calls, check caller ID and access visual voicemail, send and receive text messages, access stock and weather updates, provide fitness capabilities via heart rate and other health monitoring sensors, offer map coordinates and directions, and more. The Apple Watch also offers support for popular Apple iOS functionality such as the Siri voice assistant and Apple Pay mobile payments service.",

PlayStation Vue just launched on Apple TV, bringing Sony's streaming video package to the latest version of Apple's set-top box.\nAimed at cord cutters who are tired of paying big monthly cable TV bills when they only watch a handful of channels, PlayStation Vue bundles up the likes of ESPN, AMC, FX, HBO, Showtime and the major broadcast networks, letting viewers stream both live programming and record programs to watch on their own schedule. PlayStation Vue packages currently start at $39.99 a month, a $10 discount off their normal price.\nView photos\nMORE: PlayStation Vue vs. Sling TV: Face-Off\nSony says the Apple TV had the most requests for support among PlayStation Vue subscribers. It joins rival streaming services such as Sling TV, Netflix and others that already had apps on the fourth-generation Apple TV .\nExisting PlayStation Vue subscribers will be able to link their accounts to the Apple TV to stream live TV through the set-top box. If you're just joining the service, you'll have to sign up through the PlayStation Vue website first before streaming from your Apple TV.\nSee also : The Best Google Chromecast Apps With No Viacom Channels, Is PlayStation Vue Worth It?

      "text": "Update 11/19: Sources tell Recode that Apple purposely limited the LTE capability of the iPhone 7 on Verizon in order to make the handset similar across carriers. If you're looking for the fastest phone on Verizon, you may want to steer clear of the iPhone 7. According to researchers at Twin Prime Inc and Cellular Insights, Apple may be throttling its flagship phone on that network.\nCredit: Sam Rutherford More Credit: Sam Rutherford \nThe researchers shared their results with Bloomberg , reporting that the Galaxy S7 was twice as fast as the iPhone 7 on Verizon after collecting data from more than 100,000 phones that downloaded a large image. This huge delta exists despite the fact that the iPhone 7 and Galaxy S7 use the same advanced Qualcomm X12 modem.\nMORE: Why You Might Want to Skip iPhone 7 and Wait for 8 \nWhy would Apple possibly throttle its own phone? Perhaps to make the device's performance more consistent across carriers. The iPhone 7 for AT&T uses a slower Intel LTE modem that's capable of 450 megabits per second speeds, while the X12 modem on the Verizon model has a theoretical max of 600 Mbps.\nApple didn't deny that it might be throttling its own phone, telling Bloomberg only that the \"iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus meets or exceeds all of Apple's wireless performance standards.\" The spokesperson added that \"there is no discernible difference in the wireless performance of any of the models.\"\nThat may well be true, but it's important to note that Apple is comparing only iPhones to iPhones across networks and not handsets from other manufacturers.\nIn a follow-up story, sources told Recode that Apple did in fact throttle the Qualcomm modem on the Verizon iPhone 7 in order keep the different versions of the phone \"as similar as possible.\" Apple has another motive: to realize the cost savings of having two chip suppliers.\nRecode went on to say that it would be difficult to know how well the iPhone 7 would perform if the Qualcomm modem was used to its full potential because one doesn't exist. But the Galaxy S7's much better performance on the same network seems like a pretty good clue.\n\nA phone's 4G LTE throughput is only one aspect of a its performance. The overall speed, camera quality and battery life are all important. But consumers should be able to get the most out of Verizon's network, especially given that its plans tend to cost more than that of the competition.\nSee also : The Best iOS Apps You're Not Using (But Should Be) Best iOS Games - Top Rated Games by Category 29 Hidden iOS 10 Features You Need to Try 11 Weirdly Awesome (and Useful) Gifts",

Apple \nDespite some notable swings lately, Apple shares didn't rise or fall enough to invalidate their 110.33 buy point. The stock closed Friday at 110.06. \nThe sell-off of major consumer tech stocks since the election of Donald Trump as U.S. president has created a buying opportunity for investors , investment bank Piper Jaffray said in a research report Thursday, naming Apple, Facebook, Alphabet ( GOOGL ), Amazon ( AMZN ) and Netflix ( NFLX ). Applied Materials \nIBD 50 chip equipment maker Applied Materials is just 1.4% below a 31.17 buy point after Friday's fractional gain. Applied Materials actually rose as high as 31.25 intraday Friday, but settled for a 1-cent gain.

      "text": "Rumors regarding Apple’s 2017 flagship smartphone – likely to be called iPhone 8 – have been heating up over the last few months. The device is expected to come with an entirely new design and many other improvements to mark the 10th anniversary of Apple’s iconic product. Even though the phone is still several months away, concept designers have started imagining what the device could look like.\nImage Credit: iDropNews All-glass iPhone 8 with iris scanner Folks at iDropNews have come up with a dazzling iPhone 8 concept with all-glass design and no physical home button. Apple will reportedly ditch the home button and embed the fingerprint sensor in the display itself. The concept iPhone 8 boasts of a bezel-less OLED display and a new white color option. It also features an iris scanner for enhanced security.\nImage Credit: iDropNews An all-glass design certainly looks exciting. But there are so many technical challenges involved in designing such a device that it is unlikely to happen in 2017. Apple already owns patents related to all-glass display technology, but refining these technologies, adding them into a device, and then managing the supply chain is a whole different story.\nOnly one model of iPhone 8 to have OLED display KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said in a research note earlier this week that Apple would launch three different models of the iPhone 8. The 4.7-inch version will have an LCD screen and a single-lens camera. The 5.5-inch Plus model will also have an LCD display, but with a dual-camera setup. Only the third version, likely with a 5.8-inch display, will get an OLED screen with the dual-camera system on the back.\nApple was planning to use OLED displays in all variants of the iPhone 8. But most of its suppliers are not ready to ship OLED screens in large volumes by late 2017. So, the company is said to use it only in the most expensive variant. Supply constraints may continue well into 2018. Samsung is said to be the sole supplier of OLED displays for the iPhone 8, but it could not make enough units due to increasing iPhone demand and low yield rates.\n50-50 split between OLED and LCD? Japan Display and Sharp are still working on test procedures for OLED displays. They are unlikely to achieve full potential until 2018. Japan Display president Shuji Aruga recently said that there could be a 50-50 split between OLED and LCD displays for 2017 iPhones.\nThis is not the first time Apple has run into supply problems. The Cupertino company was once planning to use sapphire display in its 2014 iPhone 6. Apple financed GT Advanced Technologies to boost production of sapphire displays. But GT Advanced Technologies failed to deliver high-quality sapphire glass in volumes. So, Apple had to abandon the plan .\n \nThe post iPhone 8 Concept: Will Apple Be Bold Enough To Make Such A Phone? appeared first on ValueWalk .\n",

It’s Friday and I made you a warm and flavorFUL and melty grilled cheese sandwich today! Also known as * th * sandwich that I will serve leading up to AND in between the Holidays. Also, after school and sometimes during lunch… dinner, too. \nI think we’ve already talked about this, but my favorite thing in life, during this time of year, is flavorful and quick, but comforting and delicious, quick snacks and meals.

Tell me in the comments section below for a chance to win a $50 Sam’s Club gift card! \nI’ve been trying to come up with something that I might be able to serve the day before we feast on that turkey, or even the day after. Something easy, something quick, and something good.

Didn’t take too long for me to pick up a few packages and place ’em in my cart. #EatGoodCleanFun \nSo when I came back home, I was inspired to make a sandwich with my newfound ham, some crusty Italian bread, lots o’ cheese, apple slices, and apricot jam.

      "text": "Dave Greenbaum | November 20, 2016 in deals \nThis week’s free app is the freehand drawing app Tayasui Sketches Pro . Normally it’s $5 for the pro version, but you can get it free from iTunes until Thursday, November 24th. What Is It? \nSketches Pro is a painting program that gives you a ton of tools and brushes. Since my artistic skills are stuck in the stick figure stage, I couldn’t do much testing here. I wasn’t even about sure the difference between the tools. \nDespite my limitations, I still had some fun just doodling with it. I generally use Penultimate for the iPad for stuff like this. Unlike Penultimate, Sketches Pro works on both the iPad and iPhone. Who Is It Good For? \nObviously someone with some artistic leanings! Unfortunately, I’m an artistic black hole. There is a such a vacuum of skills in me, I suck out all the skills around me. Self-deprecation aside, I think this app is great for kids. When you can’t give them a piece of paper and some crayons to work with, this app is an acceptable substitute. Should You Download It? \nThe app loads fine on my iPhone 5s. Reading the reviews, some older versions of the program ran too slow on older devices. For this latest free version, looks like they fixed that. \nThe app takes up just about 125MB. I’m keeping it on my iPhone and iPad. It will keep the kids busy while waiting for their food. Should I bang my head and suddenly develop art skills, this app will definitely help me take advantage of that moment of brilliance!

      "text": "Search for: Home » Technology » Apple iPhone 8 update: iPhone 7 successor tipped to come with more advanced camera hardware Apple iPhone 8 update: iPhone 7 successor tipped to come with more advanced camera hardware   7:07   Apple is planning to bump up the iPhone 8 series camera hardware to enrich the photography experience, says the new report. One of the most loved feature of the Apple’s 2016 series iPhone 7 Plus was the camera. It housed boasts dual cameras, one a 12MP camera featuring OIS (Optical Image Stabiliser), ƒ/1.8 aperture, 6-element lens, Quad-LED True Tone flash and a tele-photo lens-base snapper to capture depth of field information to bring out Bokeh effect. Now, the KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, known for his accuracy in predictions on un-released Apple products, in his latest note to his investor client, has claimed that Apple will take the iPhone 8 series camera by a notch up over the iPhone 7 series. As per Kuo (courtesy, Mac Rumors), Apple is expected to incorporate OIS (Optical Image Stabilisation) feature to the telephoto CCM (Compact Camera Module) in the two of three iPhone 8 series models to improve the photo quality and optical zoom range. It is believed that iPhone 8 models — 5.1-inch (or 5.2-inch) OLED screen and 5.5-inch LCD screen will have dual-lens camera, while the smaller 4.7-inch LCD display will have single-lens camera with OIS feature. It is also believed that Apple will integrate AR (Augmented Reality) features in to the dual-camera in the iPhone 8 series and release an SDK for developers soon after the unveiling, to create AR-compatible apps for the device. This report comes close on the heels of the speculation on Apple testing smart glass with AR-capability. Other expected features of Apple iPhone 8: Besides the camera, Apple is working to come with fully revamped design language along with powerful Apple 11 Fusion processor with sumptuous RAM and battery capacity in the iPhone 8 series. Rumour has it that iPhone 8 series will have bezel-less display, and lose the physical home button, which used to house the fingerprint sensor on the front display panel in current and older models. The new iPhone 8 series is also expected to come with 3D touch sensor integrated right into the screen and also boast Always On Display (AOD), like we see in the flagship Moto series and the recently-released Samsung Galaxy S7 series. Keep an eye on this space for more updates on Apple iPhone 8 series.",

      "text": "Apple’s finally admitting some iPhone 6 Pluses get ‘Touch Disease’  05 pm \nAfter months of turning a blind eye to “Touch Disease”, Apple has created a worldwide repair program to address the issue on iPhone 6 Plus devices. \nTo recap: “Touch Disease,” discovered by third-party repair specialists, is a defect that causes an iPhone’s display to flicker and touchscreens to become unresponsive. According to repair specialists, Touch Disease is caused by faulty touchscreen controller chips that aren’t properly bonded to the iPhone’s logic board. Over time the the controller chips can get loose and, thus, malfunction. \nAs part of the repair program, Apple’s offering repairs for affected iPhone 6 Pluses for $149 as long as the screen’s not cracked or damaged. \nParticipating service centers include Apple Stores, Apple Authorized Service Providers and Apple Technical Support. Wireless carriers are not participating, so don’t bother bringing your busted iPhone over to AT&T, Verizon, etc. \nApple says it’ll contact customers who paid out of pocket to fix their iPhone 6 Plus either through Apple or an Apple Authorized Service Provider (if the repair place isn’t authorized by Apple, you’re out of luck) for a reimbursement. \n“The reimbursement amount will equal the difference between the price you paid for the original service to your iPhone 6 Plus and the $149 service price,” states Apple’s repair website. \nIt’s great to see Apple finally acknowledge the issue, but it’s unclear why the repair program is limited to iPhone 6 Plus devices and not iPhone 6 as well. According to iFixit, iPhone 6 can also be affected by Touch Disease, although the problem is more prevalent on iPhone 6 Pluses. \nAt the very least, following a lawsuit filed in August, Apple might finally be able to put Touch Disease to bed. –",

      "text": "Editors' pick: Originally published Nov. 15.\nThe China Consumers Association (CCA) has asked Apple ( AAPL ) to investigate into a sudden shutdown problem associated with iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s in China.\nA statement released by the consumer protection organization said it has received a considerable number of complaints from users of both devices reporting that the smartphones have been shutting off automatically without being able to be turned back on.\nThe stated problem involves models of 6 and 6s iPhones shutting down automatically while on a 50%-60% battery level. The sudden shutdown often happens after a system upgrade and when in a room temperature or colder environment. What particularly frustrates users is that the devices often cannot be turned back on after the involuntary shutdown despite continuous battery charging.\nIn an official statement issued to Apple, the CCA asked the company to find out whether the problem has anything to do with the cellphone batteries and Apple's planned measures if the problem escalates. The CCA demands an answer from Apple within 10 days.\nAccording to its latest 10k filing, Apple's overall sales declined by 30% year over year in the Greater China region for its fiscal 2016 fourth quarter ended Sept. 24, 2016. The decrease during 2016 compared to 2015 is primarily due to lower net sales and unit sales of iPhones and the effect of the depreciation of the Chinese currency against the U.S. dollar.\nThe Cupertino, Calif., company also guided to fiscal-first-quarter gross margins of 38% to 38.5% verses 39% consensus.",

Wolfe November 20, 2016 \nThe calendar says November 2016, but all of the attention of late has turned to the next iPhone, which won’t arrive until next September. Meanwhile, there was plenty of chatter about this week’s release of a very expensive “iBook.” \nHere’s a look back at the week that was in technology. Top News Stories Top News Stories \nDrip, Drip: More “iPhone 8” news \nNew iPhones aren’t expected to arrive until September 2017. Nonetheless, the iPhone 8 rumor mill continues to operate at full speed. This week, we’ve gotten more indications that Apple is poised to unveil three new iPhone models in the new year. \nHere’s what we think we know about each handset: \nThe 4.7-inch iPhone 8 and 5.5-inch iPhone 8 Plus will each have a new glass design with an LCD screen. The third new model, let’s call this the iPhone 8 Max, will measure 5.8-inches diagonally and include an edge-to-edge OLED screen. However, this model will have a smaller “ active display area ” than the iPhone 8 Plus, somewhere in the neighborhood of 5.1- to 5.2-inches. \nConfused yet? Don’t be. We’re sure that many more months of iPhone 8 rumors should clear everything up — at some point. \nBecause everyone was waiting for an actual iBook \nCupertino has announced a new hardbound book chronicling 20 years of design. \n“Designed by Apple in California” features 450 photographs of past and current Apple products, covering products from the 1998 iMac to the 2015 Apple Pencil. \nThe price of the book is $199 or $299 depending on the size, which is something Aldrin Calimlim mentions in his detailed op-ed . \nLuckily, you don’t have to spend the money to experience “Designed by Apple in California.” Just watch this walkthrough: \nDo you find it ridiculous that Apple has released a $300 book while we’re still waiting for the $159 AirPods ?

Today’s GeekWire Deals offer innovated that design so successfully that it received a glowing review from Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak and raised almost double its goal on Kickstarter.\nThe Pocket Tripod PRO uses durable plastics with easy adjustability to hold smartphones at any orientation and any angle. Sit it horizontally to watch videos, move it upright to make a call, and fix the angle to maximize lighting and readability.\nIt’s incredibly useful for working hands-free, but the tripod opens up for more than easier video chats or quick recipe references while cooking. Stabilizing carbon fiber legs keep your smartphone firmly in place to allow for steady long-exposure photography and time-lapse video. In its collapsed state, the tripod sits flat at just 3” x 2” x .01”, but it folds and fits into whatever shape or angle you need.\nUse it with your Apple or Android device—even with a case or screen protector. Just pick the size you want, or use the Fit Card to determine the right fit.\nOpen up new possibilities for your smartphone with the new and improved Pocket Tripod PRO. Pre-order for just $19.99. ",

      "title": "Apple Reportedly Throttling iPhone 7 Models With Qualcomm Modems To Match Versions With Intel Modems",
      "text": "by Rob Williams — Sunday, November 20, 2016 Apple Reportedly Throttling iPhone 7 Models With Qualcomm Modems To Match Versions With Intel Modems \nThis week, a report ousted Apple's decision to throttle the Qualcomm modem found in most of its iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus models to match the performance of the Intel modem found in other versions. Now, according to sources close to Recode , it's absolutely true and not just rumor but is there a real issue? The issue involves Apple's decision to dual-source the iPhone 7's modem block with either a Qualcomm X12 LTE modem or an Intel XMM 3360 chip. \nAs a company that sells millions upon millions of smartphones , Apple needs to plan every launch and production roll-out very strategically and supply chain consistency is critical, hence the need for multiple sources of key components. Further, even if the same model lineup uses two different chips in a key area of the design, keeping them as close in spec performance-wise to one another means that every iPhone 7 customer will enjoy the same experience. Regardless, from the user perspective, it's not ideal to have a performance area in our devices hamstrung or untapped. \nIf Apple were able to reliably stick to one vendor - in this case, Qualcomm - then every iPhone 7 owner would be able to enjoy slightly improved wireless performance. However, that \"slightly\" is the operative word. Apple is adamant about the fact that there is no \"discernible\" difference between any one of the iPhone 7s, but that only tells us that their performance is set to be equal. It doesn't tell us, however, what the Qualcomm chip could be delivering if it were left wide open to perform to its fullest potential. \nNonetheless, as nice as it would be to have the option to \"unlock\" the Qualcomm chip, Apple has to go this route to keep things fair amongst not only consumers, but carriers, too. If Verizon's iPhones performed better wirelessly than AT&T's , it wouldn't sit well with the big T that has been saddled with what some might consider a slightly inferior communications engine.

Apple says it will reimburse users if they already fixed their devices through Apple service providers.\nThe fix does not apply to the smaller iPhone 6.\nClass-action lawsuits have been filed in California, Utah, and Canada over \"Touch Disease.\" They allege Apple didn't do anything about a problem officials were aware of for some time.\nThe Apple 6 was released more than two years ago. It's standard warranty is 90 days.\nWireless carriers are not participating in the new Apple repair program.\n Samsung to acquire Harman, leader in auto technology Google responds to EU antitrust charges, says Android hasn't hurt competition Broadcom to acquire Brocade Communications for $5.5B Apple event: New MacBook Pros with Touch Bar, TV app unveiled",

      "text": "apple call log storage icloud store More Adrianhancu/123RF\nThe iPhone is known around the world for its security, and Apple has become somewhat of a champion of user privacy. Turns out, however, the device may not be as privacy aware as previously thought.\nAccording to Russian digital forensics firm Elcomsoft, the iPhone is sending near real-time call logs to Apple’s servers whether iCloud backup is switched on or off. Not only that, but those call logs are stored for up to four months. It’s not just traditional call logs either — Elcomsoft CEO Vladimir Katalov says that logs from FaceTime are also being stored.\nMore: Homeland Security contractor says Chinese software secretly infected Blu phones\n“Syncing call logs happens almost in real time, though sometimes only in a few hours,” said Katalov in an interview with Forbes . “But all you need to have is just iCloud Drive enabled, and there is no way to turn that syncing off, apart from just disabling iCloud Drive completely. In that case, many applications will stop working or lose iCloud-related features completely.”\nWhile it would be easy to start pointing fingers, there’s a chance that it was simply an oversight by Apple. That’s what iOS forensics expert Jonathan Zdziarski told Forbes, saying it was more likely than not due to an engineering issue that had something to do with how Apple handles handoffs of calls between the iPhone and a desktop computer.\nApple has indicated in the past that it plans on implementing full end-to-end encryption for iCloud backups. Currently, backups are encrypted, but Apple is able to access them — with end-to-end encryption, not even Apple would have access to personal data. That would also prevent law enforcement from being able to order Apple to hand over data. Apple is very open about the fact that it currently allows law enforcement to access iCloud backups if they have a court order.\nMacBook Pro with Touch Bar's SSD soldered to logic board, preventing upgrades After a slow start last month, iOS 10 now being run on a majority of Apple devices Apple appears to be storing a log of the numbers you enter into iMessages",

      "text": "iphone plus repair program touch disease More Three months after iFixit coined the term “touch disease” for a defect discovered with some iPhone 6 Plus devices, Apple has finally responded with the launch on Thursday of a new repair program.\nIt’s not clear how many units of this older version of Apple’s largest phone are affected by the glitch, which causes some displays to show a gray bar at the top or in some cases becomes totally unresponsive.\nThe issue was deemed so serious by some users that they launched a lawsuit against the tech giant in the summer.\nIn a message posted on its site on Thursday announcing the repair program , Apple puts the issue down to some serious user mishandling rather than a manufacturing error.\n“Apple has determined that some iPhone 6 Plus devices may exhibit display flickering or multi-touch issues after being dropped multiple times on a hard surface and then incurring further stress on the device,” the Cupertino-based company said.\nBut the fix doesn’t come free. Apple says it’ll repair affected phones for $149, though anyone who’s already paid more to repair it through Apple or an Apple authorized service provider can make a claim to have the difference refunded.\nAnyone with an iPhone 6 Plus experiencing touch disease can take it to an Apple Store for repair charged at the new set rate of $149. Alternatively, they can take it to an authorized service provider, where the same fee will be charged. Apple notes that wireless carrier partners are not participating in the new program, and that it’s only eligible for the larger, 6 Plus device.\nFollowing a growing number of complaints from iPhone 6 Plus owners earlier in the year, device repair website iFixit decided to take a closer look at the matter. After speaking to experts and examining the phone’s interior, it put the problem down to an issue with the chip-board where a crack could occur and grow gradually over weeks and months, causing increasing trouble for the user over time.\n“At first, there may be no defect at all,” iFixit said in August. “Later you might notice that the screen is sometimes unresponsive, but it is quick to come back with a hard reset. As the crack deepens into a full separation of the chip-board bond, the periods of no touch become more frequent.”\nMore: 30 useful tricks and tips for the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus\nFor many customers experiencing the problem, Apple’s repair program will be considered a step in the right direction. However, it’s unlikely to satisfy any users who can’t recall ever dropping their device “multiple times on a hard surface,” instead believing it’s a manufacturing issue for which no repair fee should be charged.\nWe may not have heard the last of this so-called touch disease.\niPhone 7 and 7 Plus: Our take on Apple’s latest and greatest Google Pixel and Pixel XL: Hands on with Google’s latest and Android 7.1 Apple slapped with class action lawsuit over iPhone ‘Touch Disease’ defect",

      "text": "Darien Cavanaugh \nA Russian software and digital forensics company is claiming that Apple has been secretly uploading data from iPhone users through its iCloud service. If true, it could be seen as a potential security risk and breach of privacy by some users. \n“ElcomSoft Co. Ltd. discovers another privacy issue with Apple cloud services, releases tool to extract iPhone call logs from iCloud,” Moscow-based ElcomSoft announced in a press release. \n“Apple automatically uploads iPhone call logs to Apple’s remote servers,” the press release continues. “Call logs can be stored on Apple servers for months, and there is no option for the end user to disable this sync without disabling iCloud entirely on their device.” \nSo, um, when your iPhone has iCloud turned on, it sends your call records to Apple. Just so you know. https://t.co/TmTfikJFqk \n— consumerist (@consumerist) November 19, 2016 \nThe press release heavily promoted ElcomSoft’s new Phone Breaker 6.2 data extraction tool, which raises some questions about the motives and legitimacy of the company’s accusations against Apple. However, several major news outlets and respected tech sites have since reported on the iCloud data uploads as factual. Investigative reporting site The Intercept recently reported on the issue as well. \n“Apple emerged as a guardian of user privacy this year after fighting FBI demands to help crack into San Bernardino shooter Syed Rizwan Farook’s iPhone,” Kim Zetter writes for The Intercept . “The company has gone to great lengths to secure customer data in recent years, by implementing better encryption for all phones and refusing to undermine that encryption. But private information still escapes from Apple products under some circumstances. The latest involves the company’s online syncing service iCloud.” \nOne of the main problems with iCloud uploading data to Apple’s servers is that there’s no convenient way to stop it from doing so if you have iCloud activated on a device, and deactivating iCloud to avoid the data upload will, of course, deny access to all of iCloud’s functions. \n“The ability to store call logs (information about incoming and outgoing calls, including missed or rejected calls) on Apple servers is available on devices running iOS 9.x and 10.x,” the ElcomSoft press release explains. “There is no official way to disable this feature for the end user other than switching off the iCloud Drive functionality completely… Since iOS delivers a number of services via iCloud Drive, disabling it would greatly affect its usability.” \nCalls made directly through your iPhone are not the only ones being logged either. FaceTime calls are also synced through iCloud. All third-party VoIP applications such as Apple CallKit, Skype, Viber, and WhatsApp are synced to iCloud in the iOS 10 operating system as well, Zetter explains in the Intercept article. \niCloud stores your iPhone’s call history for four months https://t.co/brw4MUFDOH \n— TechCrunch (@TechCrunch) November 18, 2016 \nQuestions about how photos are synced and stored on Apple’s servers still remain. \n“In recent months, ElcomSoft has discovered that Apple may keep photos deleted from the user’s iCloud Photos for much longer than the advertised period of 30 days,” the ElcomSoft press release notes. “While Apple has seemingly fixed the issue, it is not yet known whether the photos are actually removed from Apple servers or are kept elsewhere.” \nApple has recently faced other security issues, perhaps most notably when it was reported that spyware was targeting three zero-day vulnerabilities in the iOS 9.3.5 operating system. \nThose vulnerabilities made headlines when the iPhone of United Arab Emirates dissident Ahmed Mansoor was targeted by a “highly expensive spyware that exploits flaws in the mobile operating system for iPhones and iPads,” USA Today reported in August. \nApple quickly issued an update to address that threat and “beefed up” its security efforts by offering awards of up to $200,000 for researchers who discover any bug or vulnerability that poses a threat to Apple operating systems, according to USA Today . \nApple could, of course, update iCloud so that it no longer automatically uploads data to Apple servers. Doing so would offer a greater sense of security to users with privacy concerns.",

      "title": "Young Woman Uses Defunct “Flappy Bird” to Teach Engineering",
      "text": "Tamar Melike Tegün \nIn 2013, Apple made the shocking announcement that Flappy Bird would be taken off the App Store. Devastated fan Fawn Qiu made a real version of Flappy Bird that nobody could take it away. \nSince 2013, she’s used that game and similar projects to teach countless students and communities the benefits of engineering. \nQiu designs engineering projects for middle and high school students. She takes inspiration from problems in her daily life to create new projects. She also uses her own skills to solve problems for herself. \nQiu said she was addicted to playing Flappy Bird , the viral app from 2013. After she heard that the game would be taken off the App Store, she -like millions of others- became frustrated. She’d either never update her smartphone or never play Flappy Bird again. \nFellow gamers will understand her frustration. However, problems normally breed creativity. Instead of quitting playing the game or updating her cell phone, she used her engineering skills to make a physical version of the game. \n“So a few of my friends were also pretty addicted to the game, and I invited them to play as well. And they told me that it was just as infuriating as the original game.” \nAfter positive feedback and attention, Qiu uploaded a demo video of her project on Youtube. It went viral and had over two million views in a few days. She says that the comments were more interesting than the view count. \n“A lot of people wanted to make it their own or asked me how it was made. So this kind of confirmed my idea that through a creative project, we can teach people about engineering.” \nAccording to her, the money she made from Youtube let her help students with programming and engineering to make their own game in a box. Surprisingly, the students were all keen to build their own and enjoy the game. This is inspired her to find more easy DIY projects to interest students, particularly underrepresented groups, in engineering. \n“Since I didn’t find anything, I decided to make something on my own. I started with paper and fabric. And I prototyped a project where students can create a light-up creature using fabric and googly eyes. They were all helping each other in classrooms and were laughing and discussing the project. And most importantly, they were able to insert their own creativity into the project.” \nAfter the successes of her projects, she created more engineering-based projects to challenge her students. She even held workshops with adults as well. \nQiu’s projects cost considerably less than most engineering beginner’s kits for schools. She uses simple materials, making the learning tools affordable yet giving quality projects for her students.",

      "text": "I have a Mac desktop. Until recently I belonged to Apple's \"insider\" program, by which updates were tried out and all was for free including OS updates. Recently I was advised that Apple no longer supports this computer. It was built in 2008. Currently I am running El Capitan 10.11.6. Hence I no longer have the free updates. Can I manually update my OS? If I go to the App Store and click on the free upgrade, a message appears telling me \"We could not complete your purchase. This version of macOS 10.12.1 cannot be installed on this computer.\"\nThis is certainly a good way to make me think that I should buy a new computer, but I'm not biting! Is there any way around this? If I bought macOS Sierra on a disc, would it install or would I have thrown my money away? ",
