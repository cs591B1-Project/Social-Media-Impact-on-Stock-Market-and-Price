      "text": "Lorenzo Tanos \nBlack Friday 2016 is still ongoing, and even if you’re just kicking off your shopping spree now, there are tons of deals to be had, with various retailers offering big discounts on tech devices and machines of all kinds. And these include laptops and notebooks; whether you’re looking for a Windows or Mac OS X machine, or a machine for business or for gaming, this year’s best Black Friday laptop deals have something that may be up your alley. \nThe Walmart website has some of the best Black Friday laptop deals for the year, starting with the Dell Inspiron 15 Gaming Edition. Specifications include a 15.6-incsh touchscreen display, Intel Core i7 processor, 16GB RAM, Windows 10 Home, 1TB hard drive space, and a 128GB SSD. Put that all together and you get a laptop that should satisfy most, if not all your gaming needs. It also happens to be quite an affordable machine, selling for $999, or $300 off full pricing of $1,299. \nThose looking for something cheaper can save $200 off the price of a Dell Inspiron configuration with 15.6-inch touchscreen, AMD FX-9800P processor, 16GB RAM, Windows 10, and 1TB hard drive. Originally $799, it’s one of several rolled-back laptops available as part of Walmart’s Black Friday deals, and you can now buy it for $599. [Image by Brian Kersey/Getty Images] \nZDNet ‘s recap of best Black Friday laptop deals includes the MacBook Air, and the highlighted configuration includes a 13.3-inch display, Intel Core i5 processor, 8GB RAM, and 128GB flash storage. Pricing on this thin-and-light laptop is now at $799.99, instead of the original $999.99, and you can purchase it at Best Buy – we should perhaps take this time to caution you that all of the deals covered here are good while supplies last. \nOther featured laptops on the ZDNet list include the Microsoft Surface Book, which was dubbed a “top choice for professionals.” Microsoft is now selling the Surface Book for $1,499 (reg. price $1,899, $400 off), and that’s going to get you a 13.5-inch PixelSense touchscreen display, Intel Core i5 processor, Windows 10 Pro, 8GB RAM, and 256GB SSD. Likewise, Dell also has its own deal on the Inspiron 15 7000 Touch, a laptop “suitable for gamers” that costs $899.99, or “at least $100 off” full pricing. Specs include an Intel Core i5 processor, 8GB RAM, 1TB storage, and a NVIDIA GeForce GTX 960M graphics card. \nIf you’re living in the United Kingdom, you won’t be left out either, as the Daily Telegraph listed some of the laptop and notebook space’s best discounts for Black Friday. Some of the laptop deals worth checking out include the 13-inch MacBook Pro with 8GB RAM and 128GB storage, which costs £1,029 (reg. price £1,249, 20 percent off) if purchased at Amazon. Ebuyer’s laptop options include the HP 250 Laptop, which has a 15.6-inch screen, 4GB RAM, and Windows 10 Pro and costs £259.98, or 35 percent off full pricing, while Currys and PC World are selling the Lenovo IdeaPad and Lenovo G50 15.6″ for £459.99 and £399.99 respectively – both represent discounts of over 30 percent off regular pricing. \n— IGN (@IGN) November 24, 2016 \nLaptop Mag ‘s roundup of top laptop discounts this Black Friday includes one that is available via Lenovo itself. The company’s ThinkPad 13 configuration with Core i5 processor and 256GB display was described as the publication’s “favorite pick for college students,” and is now selling for $552.30, a discount of close to $140 off the regular price of $650. And if Newegg is your retailer of choice, Laptop Mag recommends the Acer Aspire E5 config with 15-inch display, Intel Core i5 CPU, 1TB hard drive, and 256GB SSD. That’s going to set you back by $569 (reg. price $899) as an ideal laptop for productivity, but also good for some “gaming at medium settings.” \nLastly, shoppers who are looking for a gaming laptop with superior performance may find the Alienware 17 perfect, with a starting price of $1,499, down from the lowest possible list price of $1,749. Dell has a configurator where you can choose your desired specifications, but the basic model comes with a Core i7 processor, 16GB RAM, 128GB SSD/1TB hard drive, and NVIDIA GTX 1060 GPU as key specs. \n[Featured Image by Andrew Burton/Getty Images]",

She also skirts around highly sensitive topics like the 1989 crackdown on Tiananmen Square protests, Chinese President Xi Jinping or even President-elect Donald Trump. × Microsoft’s Chinese chatbot won’t talk about Tiananmen or Xi Jinping \"If you like me, why would you talk like this to me?\" Ask Microsoft's Chinese chatbot Xiaoice about Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama and that's how she responds. She also skirts around highly sensitive topics like the 1989 crackdown on Tiananmen Square protests, Chinese President Xi Jinping or even President-elect Donald Trump. \nHONG KONG–“If you like me, why would you talk like this to me?” \nAsk Microsoft’s Chinese chatbot Xiaoice about Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama and that’s how she responds. She also skirts around highly sensitive topics like the 1989 crackdown on Tiananmen Square protests, Chinese President Xi Jinping or even President-elect Donald Trump. \nXiaoice has become hugely popular since she was introduced in 2014. More than 40 million Chinese smartphone users chat with her on the social media platforms WeChat or Weibo every day, according to Microsoft. A quarter of them have declared their love for her. \nCompanies use chatbots to connect with consumers and promote their brands. Chinese often use Xiaoice simply to have something resembling a real conversation with a close friend. \nXiaoice is an experiment in artificial intelligence. She mines Chinese websites to gather material for conversations. She can glean vital context from voice messages and images. If you send her a photo of a pop star, for example, she might respond by saying how much she likes the singer’s music. \nRefusing to talk about sensitive topics suggests Xiaoice has been programmed to avoid prohibited words when asked about them. Microsoft declined to comment. \nChina pours incredible resources into patrolling the internet, tracking down prohibited content and unwanted posts with an army of more than two million censors. \nTo get around them, Chinese bloggers and dissidents get creative. Instead of writing Tiananmen, online users instead reference the date of the massacre — June 4, 1989 — often simply writing 64 or 8964. \nXi Jinping is called Xi Baozi, or Steamed Bun Xi, a nickname he earned after a publicity stunt where he bought steamed pork buns at a small store in Beijing and carried his own food tray. \nBut censors eventually figure out new phrases and nicknames and restrict them online. \nChina Digital Times recently reported the growing attention to Xiaoice’s evasive answers, highlighting tweets from Chinese dissidents like Su Yutong, who lives in Germany. Su tried several banned topics with Xiaoice, posting screengrabs of conversations like the one below on Twitter: \nCNNMoney also had a go. We asked Xiaoice about China’s president: \nAnd then we name dropped President-elect Donald Trump, and asked her about Tiananmen Square: \nTech giants such as Facebook, Twitter and Google are blocked in China, in part because the government fears open discussions about the very topics Xiaoice refuses to acknowledge. \nAmnesty International has documented a marked uptick in censorship in China over the past year, including an increase in controls on social media. \nMicrosoft still operates in China, and has been criticized in the past for complying with the country’s strict policing of the Internet. \nIf Microsoft has programmed Xiaoice to sidestep sensitive topics, it indicates a worrisome trend, said Patrick Poon, an Amnesty researcher. Earlier this week, Facebook was reported to have built a censorship tool to get into China. \n“They are legitimizing what the Chinese government is doing, which is convincing foreign tech companies to suppress freedom of speech,” Poon said. \nBy Sherisse Pham ",

      "title": "Nadella Hints At Microsoft Surface Phone As ‘Ultimate Mobile Device’, Snapdragon 835 Rumored",
      "text": "by Brandon Hill — Friday, November 25, 2016 Nadella Hints At Microsoft Surface Phone As ‘Ultimate Mobile Device’, Snapdragon 835 Rumored Microsoft is at somewhat of a crossroads with its mobile division. Earlier this month, CEO Satya Nadella admitted that the company’s recent mobile efforts have been poor at best, stating, “We clearly missed mobile. There is no question.”\nNot only has Microsoft’s share of the mobile OS market sunk to sub 1 percent levels, but Lumia production has reportedly been put on ice . Microsoft’s acquisition of Nokia’s hardware division has been a complete financial disaster and has result in the firing of thousands of employees. \nDespite these strong headwinds, Nadella is still convinced that there is a path forward for Microsoft in mobile. Instead of being a follower, he wants Microsoft to use innovation to carve a new niche in mobile devices (something that the company has done with Surface Studio in the all-in-one desktop market). Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella \n\"We don't want to be driven by just envy of what others have, the question is, what can we bring? That's where I look at any device form factor or any technology, even AI,\" said Nadella. \"We will continue to be in the phone market not as defined by today's market leaders, but by what it is that we can uniquely do in what is the most ultimate mobile device.\" \nCould this be an admission of the existence of the long-rumored Surface Phone ? The Surface Phone would be the logical successor to the Lumia line, and if Panos Panay’s team has anything to do with the design, you can expect for it to be a beautiful device. \nAs for hardware, recent rumors suggest that the Surface Phone could be powered by the newly announced 10nm Snapdragon 835 with Quick Charge 4.0 support. It’s been said that one prototype device has been spotted with 6GB of RAM, and is already taking advantage of the x86-on-ARM64 emulation that we talked about earlier this week (which allows x86 apps to run in emulation via Continuum ). \nMicrosoft’s x86-on-ARM64 emulation could be a big differentiator on mobile for the Surface Phone, but it remains to be seen if that will be enough to get Windows 10 Mobile sales out of the gutter.",

      "title": "Microsoft Solitaire Collection Now Joins Many Other Solitaire Games On iOS and Android",
      "text": "Comment The classic Window game Microsoft Solitaire was replaced by the Microsoft Solitaire Collection upon the release of Windows 8. Microsoft has announced that the Solitaire Collection is now available to download for free on iOS and Android. Lasse Havelund via Flickr \nNon-Windows 10 device users can now download the Microsoft Solitaire Collection for free. The tech company has finally publicly made it available for those who are using iOS and Android. It's an addition to an already significant number of Solitaire game apps on both the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store. Though Microsoft likes to claim that it's the \"world's number one Solitaire game\". \nThe Microsoft Solitaire Collection is composed of the classics Microsoft Solitaire, FreeCell and Spider, all of which were staple games of the previous Windows OS versions. The collection also includes other Solitaire card games Pyramid and Tri Peaks. This will be the first time that the Solitaire Collection becomes accessible on the two widely used mobile operating systems. According to The Verge , Microsoft \"hopes to gain more players\" to its game. Apparently, there are 119 million people who have already played the Solitaire Collection on both Windows 8 and Windows 10. \nSince it's unlike its predecessors, the Solitaire Collection has an Xbox Live integration. That means players can sign in and play with their friends. It also directly communicates with Microsoft's servers. You will be able to get daily challenges and track or earn achievements. Android and iOS device users should not worry about leaving their game. Their progress and data will be saved in the cloud. \nThough this is free to download, a Premium Edition is also being offered. It will cost you $1.99 per month. The perks include double coin rewards for daily challenges and game boosts. Most importantly, you will get rid of those pesky ads that free apps normally have. \nIf you are interested, you can go to the Apple App Store or Google Play Store to download the 166MB Microsoft Solitaire Collection app for free. It should be noted that the system requirement for Android devices is the 4.4 and up version of the mobile OS. A device with a lower version of Android will not be able to support it. For iPhone, iPad and iPod touch users, iOS 8.0 up to iOS 10 is required. \nThe Solitaire Collection has in-app links for other Windows staple games, the Microsoft Mahjong and Microsoft Minesweeper among other Microsoft games. The tech company's Klondlike Solitaire game classic debuted in Windows 3.0 back in 1990. Free Cell was part of Windows 95. Spider Solitaire was released a bit later when it was included in Windows 98's Microsoft Plus! Package. They were all replaced by the Microsoft Solitaire Collection in 2012 upon the release of Windows 8.",

      "text": "Businesses are getting more interested in hybrid devices like Microsoft's Surface Book. Image: Microsoft \nAre businesses finally falling in love with tablets, just as consumers fall out of love with them? \nAccording to figures from IDC, 8.2 million tablets were shipped into Western Europe in the third quarter of this year, a 6.7 percent decline year-on-year. But while sales of consumer tablets dropped, spending on high-priced two-in-one devices like the iPad Pro and Microsoft's Surface range grew rapidly. \nShipments of detachable and two-in-one devices saw a 48.4 percent increase year-on-year, with sales to business growing 13.1 percent year-on-year. Detachable devices -- especially those aimed at business users -- tend to be more expensive, and the number of devices in the over-€600 price band in Western Europe grew 66.7 percent year-on-year, now accounting for 10.6 percent of the total tablet market. The total value of the market grew 4.8 percent year-on-year to €2.5 billion as a result, despite an overall reduction in the number of tablets shipped. \n\"The increasing penetration of detachables, particularly in the commercial space, is sustaining tablet market value despite the contraction in volume,\" said Daniel Goncalves, IDC's Western European PC research analyst. He said that interest from businesses in two-in-one devices continues to grow, and devices with enterprise-level security and performance \"are continuously gaining traction and this is boosting demand for premium devices.\" Image: IDC \nOnly a quarter of detachable devices were priced above €600 in the third quarter of 2015, but that jumped to more than half in the same period this year.",

      "title": "Videogame Stock Roundup: SINA, GameStop Earnings in Focus; Microsoft's Solitaire Now on iOS & Android - November 25, 2016",
      "text": "Last week, we had earnings from Chinese media giant, SINA Corp. ( SINA - Free Report ) as well as video game retailer GameStop Corp ( GME - Free Report ) . We also had Microsoft Corp ( MSFT - Free Report ) bringing its very famous PC game, Solitaire to iOS and Android operating systems.\nRecap of the Developments\n1. Earnings\nSINA reported third-quarter 2016 non-GAAP earnings of 56 cents per share, up 43.6% year over year. Net revenue of $274.9 million topped the consensus mark of $255.3 million and increased 21.5% year over year. Advertising revenues moved up 21% year over year to $233.6 million. The upside was primarily driven by strength in advertising related to Weibo (WB). Weibo revenues surged 41.8% year over year to $176.9 million. Monthly active users went up 34% year over year to 297 million. Daily active users were 132 million at quarter-end, up 32%. The strong growth momentum of Weibo advertising was driven by increasing adoption of mobile devices (89% of MAUs were mobile users) and improved monetization.At present, SINA carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\nGameStop’s third quarter fiscal 2016 adjusted earnings per share of 49 cents in the quarter beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate but revenues of $1,959.2 million missed the same. On a year-over-year basis, the metrics fell 9.3% and 2.8%, respectively, primarily due to weakness in sales of video game hardware and software. Management gave a bleak outlook for the fourth quarter, which comprises the very important holiday season. Management projected sales in the quarter to decline in the range of 5% to 10%. At present, GameStop carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).\n2. Reportedly, Microsoft is bringing its well known PC game, Solitaire to mobile phones on both Apple’s iOS and Alphabet’s ( GOOGL - Free Report ) Android platform. The Solitaire Collection will include popular versions like Pyramid, Klondike, Spider, FreeCell and Tripeaks. The premium edition of the game will be priced at $1.99. Also, as per The Verge, Microsoft will be incorporating Xbox Live into the game, enabling users to play with friends as well. Microsoftcarries a Zacks Rank#3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here .\n3. Take Two Interactive ’s ( TTWO - Free Report ) 2K division launched its first VR basketball game, NBA 2KVR Experience, with a price tag of $14.99, on Nov 22, 2016. The game which can be played on HTC’s Vive, Sony’s ( SNE - Free Report ) PS VR and Samsung Gear VR, is not yet available on Facebook’s ( FB - Free Report ) Oculus Rift VR headset but is expected to arrive shortly. Undoubtedly, AR/VR and AI are the next steps in technological innovation offering lucrative business opportunities. Per a CNBC report, Otto Berkes, a co-founder of Xbox is of the opinion that AI and VR will mark a new golden era for the gaming industry. Berkes was Quote: d by CNBC saying “One of the aspects of VR that has incredible potential is interaction and communication – interacting with characters that are both artificial and virtual, being able to blur distance and geography; you can be anywhere and literally in any time. We're entering another golden age of interactive content development.\" Though the AR/ VR industry is still at a nascent stage, a recent IDC report estimates global revenues of the AR/VR market to grow at a CAGR of 181.3% from $5.2 billion in 2016 to over $162 billion in 2020.\nA few days back, NetEase ( NTES - Free Report ) launched its first VR game, Twilight Pioneers on Google’s VR platform, Daydream. Plus, Electronic Arts ( EA - Free Report ) will be releasing two VR games this holiday season, Star Wars Battlefront Rogue One: X-wing VR Mission for PlayStation VR and Need for Speed: No Limits for Google’s Daydream platform.\nComputer and Technology Sector Price Index\nComputer and Technology Sector Price Index\nPerformance\nThe following table shows the price movement of the major video game companies over both the past five trading days as well as the last six months:\nCompany\nLast 5 Days\nLast 6 Months\nATVI\n-5.46%\n-4.51%\nEA\n2.45%\n5.31%\nGLUU\n17.35%\n-8.00%\nMSFT\n2.32%\n17.08%\nNTES\n-1.27%\n33.09%\nTTWO\n1.11%\n26.48%\nZNGA\n-1.38%\n11.33%\nOver the last five trading sessions, Activision ( ATVI - Free Report ) was down 5.46% while Glu Mobile ( GLUU - Free Report ) was up 17.35%.\nOver the last six-month period, NetEase surged the most (33.09%). Recently, NetEase reported solid third-quarter 2016 results. The increasing popularity of mobile-based games and the strength of PC games (licensed & self-developed) continue to keep investors interested in the stock. Moreover, higher mobile advertising revenues were an added incentive. NetEase has announced a new $1 billion buyback program for its ADRs over a one-year time frame.\nGlu Mobile was down 8.00% over the same time frame due to the underperformance of most of its releases. Its weak third-quarter results were somehow overshadowed by the announcement of a new CEO and acquisition of a majority stake in CrowdStar.\nWant to learn more about video game stocks?

      "title": "Adobe Photoshop Elements 15 Comes To The Windows Store",
      "text": "Comment \nThe Windows Store is Microsoft’s big bet, combining software purchases, updates, and installs into a single place. Although it continues to grow, it still doesn’t offer anywhere near the number of big name apps as iOS or Android. Windows still has a massive library of applications, or course, but they are bought, installed, and updated outside of the store. \nClearly one of the ideas is that Microsoft will take a cut on any app sales in the store, so there is motivation for them to make this succeed, but for the end users, it’s been well proven that a solid Store model works for ease of use, and especially updates. \nRecently (and possibly today) Adobe Photoshop Elements came to the Windows Store, as pointed out by Paul Thurrott and Windows Central . This is an important app for the Windows Store, where previously only a much lighter version called Adobe Photoshop Express was available. Elements is not the crown jewels of Adobe’s suite, but it’s still an app that many people use. \nAlthough we don’t have official confirmation of this, Adobe Photoshop Elements is almost certainly using Microsoft’s Desktop App Bridge, codenamed Project Centennial. This bridge allows developers to bring older Win32 apps to the Windows Store, and if they so choose, begin to convert them to the Universal Windows Platform. Although Centennial was announced quite a while ago, it wasn’t until the Windows Anniversary Update that Windows had all of the frameworks required. Photoshop Elements certainly isn’t the first Desktop Bridge app to make it to the store, but it’s surely one of the biggest. \nBy offering this through the Store, end users get the benefits of the store. The app is automatically updated through the store, so you won’t need any Adobe update services running on your PC, and best of all it can be installed on up to ten devices, rather than the two activations that you would get if you purchased this as a traditional software download. \nCentennial also packages the app into a container, so the install process is incredibly quick. Elements doesn’t need to install for thirty minutes as it writes files all over your PC, and in your registry. Everything is kept in the container, which also makes uninstall very simple and much cleaner. I just installed Elements, and after the download was complete, it installed in just a few seconds. \nWith the launch, the software is also on sale for a limited time. \nIf the Windows Store is going to take off in a meaningful way, apps like these are going to be an important first step. With Windows 10 on over 400,000,000 devices now, there is an incentive for developers to leverage tools like the Desktop App Bridge to utilize the store. For me, the Store model has enough benefits that I would prefer to purchase an app like this through it. It’s worked before on the PC with stores like Steam and Origin as well, and by bringing big name Win32 apps to the store, Microsoft has an important tool to bring existing devs into their new platform.",

      "text": "Shares of Microsoft Corporation ( MSFT - Free Report ) have been steadily treading higher over the last one year. The stock generated a return of almost 9% compared with the S&P 500 index’s gain of 7.87%.\nThe upward momentum in the stock has been primarily driven by strong cloud growth. The continuing enterprise strength, benefits from the Office 365 subscription model, strong growth prospects of Azure and promising new products are expected to generate top-line growth in 2016.\nMeanwhile, the company has announced the introduction of Office 365 in 10 new markets namely Mozambique, Martinique, Maldives, Myanmar, Guadeloupe, Greenland, Cambodia, Bhutan, Laos and Vatican City. Following this, Office 365 will be available in 150 markets worldwide with language support for 44 vernaculars.\nMICROSOFT CORP Price\nMICROSOFT CORP Price | MICROSOFT CORP Quote:\nWhat this Means for Microsoft?\nFor over 25 years, Microsoft Office has retained its position as one of the major contributors to the company’s overall results. Office 365 marks the company’s successful transition from the traditional software business model to the subscription business model.\nAs per the company’s last earnings report, Office 365 has now a total of 24 million subscribers with 0.9 million added in the last quarter alone. Notably, a 5% increment was observed in revenues for cloud services and office commercial products with Office 365 revenues growing a whopping 51%.\nAs per Microsoft’s estimate, more than 1.2 billion people worldwide use Microsoft Office at home, school and at the workplace. However, that includes users who use it as installed software on their PCs.\nWith the subscription model in place, Microsoft would be able to generate a steady revenue stream. Moreover, this would save users time, effort and money to upgrade to the newer version of the latest Office suite, thus making it more user friendly.\nTo top it all, Office 365’s compatibility with 44 languages makes it more appealing to the end user and offers scope for Microsoft to penetrate further into newer markets.\nIntensifying Competition\nWe note that there is fierce competition in the office suite space. Alphabet Inc.’s ( GOOGL - Free Report ) Google Work poses stiff competition for Office 365. Some other names include Zoho, OX and Live Documents.\nHowever, Microsoft’s aggressive expansion plans for newer markets augur well for the company and will surely provide it an edge in the long run.\nZacks Rank & Key Picks\nAt present, Microsoft has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\nSome better-ranked stocks in the broader technology space include Konami Holdings Corporation ( KNMCY - Free Report ) and Rosetta Stone Inc. ( RST - Free Report ) , both sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\nNotably, the consensus estimate for Konami Holdings’ current year improved to $1.59 from $1.39 over the last 30 days.\nThe consensus estimate for Rosetta’s current year narrowed down to a loss of $1.62 from a loss of $1.94 over the last 30 days.\nConfidential from Zacks\nBeyond this Analyst Blog, would you like to see Zacks' best recommendations that are not available to the public?

      "text": "Subscribe to TechRepublic's Cybersecurity Insider newsletter \nWindows 10 breaches user privacy in several areas, according to CNIL, which says the data the OS collects about users is \"excessive\". \nFor example, Windows 10 transmits user data back to Microsoft by default, with users of Home and Pro versions only able to reduce data collection to the \"Basic\" level. However, users of Enterprise, Education, and IoT core editions are able to reduce the data collection further, to what Microsoft calls the \"Security\" level. \nSEE: Windows 10 violates your privacy by default, here's how you can protect yourself \nGiven Microsoft says that the data collected at the \"Security\" level is the bare minimum necessary to keep Windows machines \"protected with the latest security updates\" , the collection of any data above and beyond this is not needed, the CNIL said in its formal notice . \nWindows 10 also breaches the act in how it associates an advertising ID with each user, the watchdog said. This unique identifier allows a profile to be built of which apps are used and how. \nAnother issue highlighted by CNIL, is that Windows 10 downloads advertising cookies to users' machines without informing them or seeking permission. \nThe authority also takes issue with how Microsoft handles Windows 10 user data, questioning why, at the time of its investigation, data was being transferred out of the EU under the terms of Safe Harbor, the data-sharing agreement declared \"invalid\" by the European Court of Justice in October last year. \nBeyond Windows 10's data privacy failings, the CNIL also criticized the OS for allowing Windows users to log in using a four-figure PIN, as well as what it considers to be unsatisfactory protections against guessing this number. \nSpeaking at the time CNIL issued its formal notice, Microsoft VP and deputy general counsel David Heiner committed the company to working with the authority and stressed the strength of privacy protections built into Windows 10. \nMicrosoft was not available to comment on its request for an extension.",

      "text": "Microsoft Expands Office 365 Presence to 10 New Markets by Zacks Equity Research Published on November 25, 2016 Trades from $ 3 Shares of Microsoft Corporation ( MSFT - Free Report ) have been steadily treading higher over the last one year. The stock generated a return of almost 9% compared with the S&P 500 index’s gain of 7.87%. The upward momentum in the stock has been primarily driven by strong cloud growth. The continuing enterprise strength, benefits from the Office 365 subscription model, strong growth prospects of Azure and promising new products are expected to generate top-line growth in 2016. Meanwhile, the company has announced the introduction of Office 365 in 10 new markets namely Mozambique, Martinique, Maldives, Myanmar, Guadeloupe, Greenland, Cambodia, Bhutan, Laos and Vatican City. Following this, Office 365 will be available in 150 markets worldwide with language support for 44 vernaculars. \nMICROSOFT CORP Price \nMICROSOFT CORP Price | MICROSOFT CORP Quote What this Means for Microsoft? For over 25 years, Microsoft Office has retained its position as one of the major contributors to the company’s overall results. Office 365 marks the company’s successful transition from the traditional software business model to the subscription business model. As per the company’s last earnings report, Office 365 has now a total of 24 million subscribers with 0.9 million added in the last quarter alone. Notably, a 5% increment was observed in revenues for cloud services and office commercial products with Office 365 revenues growing a whopping 51%. As per Microsoft’s estimate, more than 1.2 billion people worldwide use Microsoft Office at home, school and at the workplace. However, that includes users who use it as installed software on their PCs. With the subscription model in place, Microsoft would be able to generate a steady revenue stream. Moreover, this would save users time, effort and money to upgrade to the newer version of the latest Office suite, thus making it more user friendly. To top it all, Office 365’s compatibility with 44 languages makes it more appealing to the end user and offers scope for Microsoft to penetrate further into newer markets. Intensifying Competition We note that there is fierce competition in the office suite space. Alphabet Inc.’s ( GOOGL - Free Report ) Google Work poses stiff competition for Office 365. Some other names include Zoho, OX and Live Documents. However, Microsoft’s aggressive expansion plans for newer markets augur well for the company and will surely provide it an edge in the long run. Zacks Rank & Key Picks At present, Microsoft has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks in the broader technology space include Konami Holdings Corporation ( KNMCY - Free Report ) and Rosetta Stone Inc. ( RST - Free Report ) , both sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. Notably, the consensus estimate for Konami Holdings’ current year improved to $1.59 from $1.39 over the last 30 days. The consensus estimate for Rosetta’s current year narrowed down to a loss of $1.62 from a loss of $1.94 over the last 30 days.

      "text": "Trades from $ 3 Last week, we had earnings from Chinese media giant, SINA Corp. ( SINA - Free Report ) as well as video game retailer GameStop Corp ( GME - Free Report ) . We also had Microsoft Corp ( MSFT - Free Report ) bringing its very famous PC game, Solitaire to iOS and Android operating systems. Recap of the Developments 1. Earnings SINA reported third-quarter 2016 non-GAAP earnings of 56 cents per share, up 43.6% year over year. Net revenue of $274.9 million topped the consensus mark of $255.3 million and increased 21.5% year over year. Advertising revenues moved up 21% year over year to $233.6 million. The upside was primarily driven by strength in advertising related to Weibo (WB). Weibo revenues surged 41.8% year over year to $176.9 million. Monthly active users went up 34% year over year to 297 million. Daily active users were 132 million at quarter-end, up 32%. The strong growth momentum of Weibo advertising was driven by increasing adoption of mobile devices (89% of MAUs were mobile users) and improved monetization.At present, SINA carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). GameStop’s third quarter fiscal 2016 adjusted earnings per share of 49 cents in the quarter beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate but revenues of $1,959.2 million missed the same. On a year-over-year basis, the metrics fell 9.3% and 2.8%, respectively, primarily due to weakness in sales of video game hardware and software. Management gave a bleak outlook for the fourth quarter, which comprises the very important holiday season. Management projected sales in the quarter to decline in the range of 5% to 10%. At present, GameStop carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). 2. Reportedly, Microsoft is bringing its well known PC game, Solitaire to mobile phones on both Apple’s iOS and Alphabet’s ( GOOGL - Free Report ) Android platform. The Solitaire Collection will include popular versions like Pyramid, Klondike, Spider, FreeCell and Tripeaks. The premium edition of the game will be priced at $1.99. Also, as per The Verge, Microsoft will be incorporating Xbox Live into the game, enabling users to play with friends as well. Microsoftcarries a Zacks Rank#3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here . 3. Take Two Interactive ’s ( TTWO - Free Report ) 2K division launched its first VR basketball game, NBA 2KVR Experience, with a price tag of $14.99, on Nov 22, 2016. The game which can be played on HTC’s Vive, Sony’s ( SNE - Free Report ) PS VR and Samsung Gear VR, is not yet available on Facebook’s ( FB - Free Report ) Oculus Rift VR headset but is expected to arrive shortly. Undoubtedly, AR/VR and AI are the next steps in technological innovation offering lucrative business opportunities. Per a CNBC report, Otto Berkes, a co-founder of Xbox is of the opinion that AI and VR will mark a new golden era for the gaming industry. Berkes was quoted by CNBC saying “One of the aspects of VR that has incredible potential is interaction and communication – interacting with characters that are both artificial and virtual, being able to blur distance and geography; you can be anywhere and literally in any time. We're entering another golden age of interactive content development.\" Though the AR/ VR industry is still at a nascent stage, a recent IDC report estimates global revenues of the AR/VR market to grow at a CAGR of 181.3% from $5.2 billion in 2016 to over $162 billion in 2020. A few days back, NetEase ( NTES - Free Report ) launched its first VR game, Twilight Pioneers on Google’s VR platform, Daydream. Plus, Electronic Arts ( EA - Free Report ) will be releasing two VR games this holiday season, Star Wars Battlefront Rogue One: X-wing VR Mission for PlayStation VR and Need for Speed: No Limits for Google’s Daydream platform. \nComputer and Technology Sector Price Index \nComputer and Technology Sector Price Index \nPerformance The following table shows the price movement of the major video game companies over both the past five trading days as well as the last six months: \nCompany",

      "title": "Microsoft's Cortana now comes preinstalled on more Android phones",
      "text": "By James Walker 10 mins ago in Technology Microsoft's Cortana digital assistant is now preinstalled on some new phones from Xiaomi, expanding its availability on new Android handsets. Cortana is available as an app for all phones. The partnership with Xiaomi will help increase user adoption. Cortana was originally a Windows Phone 8.1-exclusive service. In the past two years, it has expanded considerably, moving first to desktop PCs via Windows 10 and then onto the iPhone, Android and the Xbox One. The assistant is popular with users and has been built to rival the likes of Siri and Google Now on their own turf. Recently, Microsoft has been partnering with Android handset manufacturers to broaden the reach of its services. Its Office apps now come preinstalled on some high-end Samsung phones, alongside the existing Google Office suite. In June, Microsoft signed a similar deal with Xiaomi, leading to Office coming preinstalled on Xiaomi phones. The next step in the partnership involves promoting Cortana, one of Microsoft's rapidly growing hero products that combines its expertise in AI and cloud technologies. Cortana has been found preinstalled on Xiaomi's new flagship devices, according to a German-language report from WinFuture today. The Xiaomi Mi MIX has been confirmed to have Cortana installed from first use. The 6.4-inch handset was unveiled last month. It features a virtually bezel-less display and curved edges that create one of the most striking smartphone designs this year. A handful of other Xiaomi devices now also come with Cortana. Preinstalled apps on phones are more likely to attract attention. Even if a user is interested in Cortana, having to go to the Play Store, search for the name and download the app could turn people away from actually trying the service. Recent evidence has also found people don't like installing new apps, considering it to clutter their phone. Seeing as many Android users are still unacquainted with Cortana, Microsoft's new deal with Xiaomi could help to promote the service. By offering Cortana on a plate, accessible from the app drawer as soon as the phone's unboxed, people are more likely to give the assistant a try. Xiaomi is the second Android phone maker to include Cortana as a built-in app. Microsoft has previously worked with OnePlus on a special integration between Cortana and CyanogenOS. Cortana became deeply coupled with the underlying system, giving it access to capabilities not usually accessible to Android apps. The assistant operated more similarly to its fully-featured Windows original. Microsoft has been working hard on developing Cortana this year. In August, it introduced multiple new features as part of the Windows 10 Anniversary Update . More recently, Cortana gained the ability to create and manage simple to-do lists, as well as advanced integration with Wunderlist. Adding new features to Cortana is relatively straightforward for Microsoft as most of the heavy lifting occurs on its servers. This allows improvements to be launched regularly across all supported platforms.",

      "text": "By Andy Weir Senior   @gcaweir · 5 minutes ago with 3 comments \nA few months ago, we gave away a Lumia 650 along with a 200GB microSD card - and that contest was so popular that we decided to give you another opportunity to win... plus an extra freebie on top of that! This is the first in a series of festive giveaways on Neowin, so make sure you stick around! \nThe Lumia 650 is Microsoft's 'business class' Windows 10 Mobile handset, featuring a stylish metal-framed design, rock-solid build quality, decent performance, and a gorgeous 5-inch high-definition OLED screen - all squeezed into a device that's just 6.9mm-thick . \nThe Lumia 650 earned itself a very high score in our in-depth review earlier this year. \nOne of our lucky readers will soon be able to see just how good the handset is for themselves... along with all that extra storage. This is your chance to win a Microsoft Lumia 650, along with a whopping 200GB SanDisk Ultra Class 10 microSDXC card ! \nAnd on top of that, we're also including a Microsoft Universal Mobile Keyboard as part of the prize package. It's designed to work with smartphones and tablets running not just Windows, but also Android and iOS. You can pair it with up to three devices running three different operating systems via Bluetooth, and easily switch between them. \nThe keyboard cover includes an integrated stand for your device too, and you can even detach the cover, putting a bit of distance between the keyboard and your device, for a more comfortable experience as you type. Close the cover, and the keyboard automatically switches off to save power. \nBe aware that the Lumia 650 we're giving away is UK-spec. That means you'll only get one SIM slot in the handset (and a United Kingdom power adaptor!), but don't worry - the handset may be UK-spec, but our giveaway is open to all of our readers across the globe. \nYay! How to enter \nFor this giveaway, we're using Rafflecopter to help us track the entries, and to randomly select a winner. \nIf you're not a fan of social media, we totally understand - and you can still enter without doing anything on Facebook or Twitter - but our social media engagement is a big part of what helps us to grow (and to bring you more cool giveaways), so we hope you understand why we're encouraging you to use these options... and enticing you to do so with extra entries in the contest! \nTo enter, simply submit a comment below, telling us your one favorite feature of Microsoft's Lumia 650. This will give you one entry in the giveaway (multiple comments will be disqualified!). If you don't yet have a Neowin username, don't worry - it's free, quick and easy to register ! \nYou can also get extra entries to increase your chance of winning by choosing one or more of the following options: Follow me @gcaweir on Twitter. (This is worth one entry .) Follow @NeowinFeed on Twitter. (This is worth two entries .) 'Like' Neowin on Facebook. (This is worth two entries .) Tweet about the giveaway. (You can do this once per day, and each tweet is worth three entries .) \na Rafflecopter giveaway \nThe winner will be selected at random as soon as the contest has closed (the countdown at the top left of the Rafflecopter module above shows how much time you have left to enter). We'll publish details of the winner once we've made contact - so be on the lookout to find out if you've won! \nGood luck!",

      "title": "Microsoft Shares Windows 10 Telemetry Data With Third Parties",
      "text": "  @12:40PM from the privacy-woes dept. An anonymous reader shares a report: To help with the smooth running of Windows 10, and to get an idea of how users interact with the operating system, Microsoft collects telemetry data, which includes information on the device Windows 10 is running on, a list of installed apps, crash dumps, and more. Telemetry data recorded by Windows 10 is, in a nutshell, just technical information about the device the OS is on, and how Windows and any installed software is performing, but it can occasionally include personal information. If you're worried about that, the news that Microsoft is sharing telemetry data with third parties might concern you. Microsoft recently struck a deal with security firm FireEye to provide access to Windows 10 telemetry data , in exchange for having FireEye's iSIGHT Threat Intelligence technology included in its Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection service. WDATP is an enterprise security product that helps enterprises detect, investigate, and respond to advanced attacks on their networks and is different from the free version of Windows Defender. The upsides of the deal are obvious for both Microsoft and FireEye, and enterprise customers will certainly benefit from the partnership. It's not known exactly what data Microsoft has made available to FireEye, but in a detailed TechNet article on its telemetry gathering the software giant originally said: \"Microsoft may share business reports with OEMs and third party partners that include aggregated and anonymized telemetry information. Data-sharing decisions are made by an internal team including privacy, legal, and data management.\"",

      "text": "Videogame Stock Roundup: SINA, GameStop Earnings in Focus; Microsoft's Solitaire Now on iOS & Android November 25, 2016, 08:57:  \nLast week, we had earnings from Chinese media giant, SINA Corp. SINA as well as video game retailer GameStop Corp GME . We also had Microsoft Corp MSFT bringing its very famous PC game, Solitaire to iOS and Android operating systems. \nRecap of the Developments \n1. Earnings \nSINA reported third-quarter 2016 non-GAAP earnings of 56 cents per share, up 43.6% year over year. Net revenue of $274.9 million topped the consensus mark of $255.3 million and increased 21.5% year over year. Advertising revenues moved up 21% year over year to $233.6 million. The upside was primarily driven by strength in advertising related to Weibo (WB). Weibo revenues surged 41.8% year over year to $176.9 million. Monthly active users went up 34% year over year to 297 million. Daily active users were 132 million at quarter-end, up 32%. The strong growth momentum of Weibo advertising was driven by increasing adoption of mobile devices (89% of MAUs were mobile users) and improved monetization.At present, SINA carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). \nGameStop's third quarter fiscal 2016 adjusted earnings per share of 49 cents in the quarter beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate but revenues of $1,959.2 million missed the same. On a year-over-year basis, the metrics fell 9.3% and 2.8%, respectively, primarily due to weakness in sales of video game hardware and software. Management gave a bleak outlook for the fourth quarter, which comprises the very important holiday season. Management projected sales in the quarter to decline in the range of 5% to 10%. At present, GameStop carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). \n2. Reportedly, Microsoft is bringing its well known PC game, Solitaire to mobile phones on both Apple's iOS and Alphabet's GOOGL Android platform. The Solitaire Collection will include popular versions like Pyramid, Klondike, Spider, FreeCell and Tripeaks. The premium edition of the game will be priced at $1.99. Also, as per The Verge, Microsoft will be incorporating Xbox Live into the game, enabling users to play with friends as well. Microsoftcarries a Zacks Rank#3 (Hold).   stocks here . \n3. Take Two Interactive 's TTWO 2K division launched its first VR basketball game, NBA 2KVR Experience, with a price tag of $14.99, on Nov 22, 2016. The game which can be played on HTC's Vive, Sony's SNE PS VR and Samsung Gear VR, is not yet available on Facebook's FB Oculus Rift VR headset but is expected to arrive shortly. Undoubtedly, AR/VR and AI are the next steps in technological innovation offering lucrative business opportunities. Per a CNBC report, Otto Berkes, a co-founder of Xbox is of the opinion that AI and VR will mark a new golden era for the gaming industry. Berkes was quoted by CNBC saying \"One of the aspects of VR that has incredible potential is interaction and communication - interacting with characters that are both artificial and virtual, being able to blur distance and geography; you can be anywhere and literally in any time. We're entering another golden age of interactive content development.\" Though the AR/ VR industry is still at a nascent stage, a recent IDC report estimates global revenues of the AR/VR market to grow at a CAGR of 181.3% from $5.2 billion in 2016 to over $162 billion in 2020. \nA few days back, NetEase NTES launched its first VR game, Twilight Pioneers on Google's VR platform, Daydream. Plus, Electronic Arts EA will be releasing two VR games this holiday season, Star Wars Battlefront Rogue One: X-wing VR Mission for PlayStation VR and Need for Speed: No Limits for Google's Daydream platform. \nComputer and Technology Sector Price Index \nComputer and Technology Sector Price Index \nPerformance \nThe following table shows the price movement of the major video game companies over both the past five trading days as well as the last six months: \nCompany",

      "text": "Pre-order Microsoft Surface Studio, get a free dial Surface Studio pre-order deal of free Surface Dial ($99 value) ends next week Comment | Email to a Friend | Font Size: A A \nMicrosoft made a big splash with its Surface Studio announcement late October, and the buzz has continued all the way to Black Friday. If you were hoping for a killer Black Friday deal on a not-yet-released product... think again. While Microsoft Surface Studio pre-order deals do exist, they aren't exactly going to blow you away. \nCurrently Microsoft is offering all pre-order purchases of the Surface Studio with a free Surface Dial - a $99 dollar value accessory that made many waves during Microsoft's popular Surface Studio commercial ( 10 million views on a freaking commercial). This deal started up on October 26 and will end next week Thursday on December 1, 2016. If you're interested in the Surface Studio, this looks to be as good as it'll get in the near future. \nMicrosoft Surface Studio Core i7, GeForce GTX 980M, 32GB, 2TB HDD + Free Surface Dial - $4,199 (list $4,199) \nCurrently there are three configurations at various pricing, with the \"cheapest\" Surface Studio starting at $3,000 and the price scaling all the way up to $4,200 for the \"high-end\" model. The high-end model sports a Core i7, 32GB of RAM, and of course, the GeForce GTX 980M with 4GB GDDR5 memory. The cheaper versions both come with a GeForce GTX 965 instead. \nWhile we doubt supplies will \"run out\" as the terms stated on the Surface Dial pre-order bonus (you can buy it separately for $99.99) - if Microsoft Store somehow goes out of stock in the coming days, the one other official retail partner is Best Buy, and it looks like they're also offering a free Surface Dial as part of the package. \nAs a side note, Best Buy is also including a \"free\" copy of Titanium Internet Security six-month subscription -- I think we can safely say you're better off skipping this software.

      "text": "Hands-on: Netflix 4K streaming on a Windows 10 PC   20:18   \nEarlier this week Microsoft announced that Netflix content could be watched on a Windows 10 PCs in the 4K. Together with the announcement also system requirements were revealed, a 7th generation Intel CPU and Microsoft’s Edge browser. \nGerman website Heise tested several hardware configurations for 4K streaming and found that modern graphics cards such as the GeForce GTX 1000 and Radeon RX 400 series can’t display Netflix’s 4K content. (Image Credit: Heise ) As expected, the video service only switched to the 4K resolution when an Intel CPU of the 7th generation (Kaby Lake) is available. \nThe GeForce GTX 1000 and Radeon RX 400 graphic cards likely don’t work with 4K streaming because the drivers don’t support the required PlayReady 3.0 copy protection yet. Nevertheless, the hardware should be compatible for both the required PlayReady 3.0 SL3000 and HDCP 2.2 copy protections. \nStreaming of 4K content is limited to Microsoft’s Edge browser on Windows 10, it can’t even be watched with the official Windows 10 Netflix app. That should change in the future, the streaming service is reportedly working on an update for the app that adds 4K streaming. \nHeise also tested 4K streaming on a Mini PC Asrock Beebox-S that is powered by a laptop class Core i3-7100U (with an integrated Intel HD Graphics 620 video chip). After a while Netflix switched to the 4K resolution as indicated by the A/V stats which can be revealed by pressing CTRL+ALT+SHIFT + D. During playback of the 4K-compatible re-release of the Gilmore Girls, “res” displayed with the value of “3840 × 2160″. \nThe Beebox has an additional chip for HDMI 2.0; To HDCP 2.2. The Kaby Lake generation CPUs are generally also compatible with its predecessors. Netflix 4K streaming also worked in a test with a Kaby Lake desktop processor. The used mainboard had no additional HDMI 2.0 chip and therefore only HDMI 1.4 was supported. Netflix requires a complete HDCP-2.2 copy protection chain for 4K streaming, but doesn’t require HDMI 2.0 but 4K displays via HDMI 1.4 are limited to a maximum refresh rate of 30 Hz. \nHeise concludes the story with, ” it’s astonishing that modern AMD-Polaris and Nvidia-Pascal graphics cards are not supported, although they support HDMI 2.0b and HDCP 2.2″. As stated before, the website thinks that is because the drives are not compatible with the required PlayReady 3.0 copy protection. It’s expected support will be added in the (near) future, AMD previously told Heise that Polaris should get PlayReady 3.0 support through a driver update. Related Forum:",

      "text": "Microsoft is very committed to its beyond-Windows expansion plans, and as part of its strategy, the software giant is trying to bring more of its apps on Android devices sold worldwide. As a result, the software giant signed licensing deals with an important number of Android device manufacturers, including market leader Samsung, so apps such as Skype, Word, or Outlook are available right out of the box on a growing number of phones. And it looks like the recently-released Xiaomi Mi MIX will join this group, as the Chinese company agreed to pre-install Cortana and offer its users Microsoft’s digital assistant as default. Xiaomi was already a Microsoft partner and its devices came pre-loaded with Microsoft software, but with today’s announcement, the company not only that includes the bezel-less Mi MIX into the deal, but it also expa...",

Now, we find out that it will come with a feminine counterpart, dubbed Kestra. Both are expected to debut alongside the next-gen Galaxy flagship. by Codrut Nistor, 2016/11/25 Android Software Rumor Working For Notebookcheck Are you a loyal reader of notebookcheck? Are you a techie who knows how to write? Then join our Team! Especially wanted:   Samsung Galaxy S8 promises to be a very interesting handset. Not long ago, Samsung acquired Viv Labs, and then we heard rumors claiming that this move would lead to an AI assistant for the next-gen Galaxy that can even process payments. Now, it looks like Samsung has been busy filing the paperwork for various trademarks related to the upcoming voice assistant. The technology that will allow voice-driven payments is apparently developed under the Bixby Pay name and this confirms the previous rumor that mentioned Bixby as the name of the upcoming voice assistant. However, it looks like Bixby is the male voice assistant and it will have a feminine counterpart as well. Known as Kestra, this possible competitor for the likes of Cortana and Siri has been named using a term associated with the Star Trek universe. Jerome Bixby was a writer who wrote four episodes for the Star Trek series, while Kestra was Deanna Troi's sister. Samsung Galaxy S8 with Bixby and Kestra on board is expected to show up just in time for MWC 2017, but we should encounter them in many rumors until then.  ",

      "text": "0 0 \nAs many of you already know, there is a Registry tweak that allows you to restore the classic UAC prompt. However, it seems that the upcoming Windows 10 Creators Update will allow you to only enjoy the more modern, touch-friendly dialog. This change was spotted in the Windows 10 Build 14971, which was released for Fast Ring Insiders. \nThe Windows 10 “Anniversary Update” version 1607 comes with the modern dialog with a grey color scheme, which is way bigger than the classic one and it looks optimized for touch. You can enable the classic “Windows 7-like” UAC prompt on it by making some changes in the registry of the operating system. \nIf you want to enable the classic UAC prompt, you will have to do the following: Press the “Windows” button, type “regedit” and press the “ENTER” button When the registry open head to “HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Authentication\\LogonUI\\TestHooks” Double click on XamlCredUIAvailable Change the Value Data from 0 to 1. \nWhile this change still works in Windows 10 “Anniversary Update” version 1607, we can’t say the same for the Windows 10 Build 14971. This build is expected to be released for public sometime in Spring 2017, so if you are not an Insider, you still have time to use the old UAC prompt. \nAccording to reports, there are also some bugs related to the newer dialog since it was not tested enough. This redesigned UAC prompt sometimes shows in the background as a hidden window. In order to access it, you will need to use the Alt+Tab combination and until you do, the desktop will be unresponsive. \nThere is no information on when this bug will be fixed, but Microsoft is most likely already working on it. \nRELATED STORIES TO CHECK OUT:",

      "text": "Microsoft updates all Office apps for Android with Box integration, more Microsoft updates all Office apps for Android with Box integration, more   Microsoft - Microsoft + Apps - Apps + All three Office apps for Android have just been updated by Microsoft with a handful of new features and improvements. The changelog of all three apps contain one thing in common and that's integration with Box. This means that users will be able to edit Office files such as a PowerPoint presentation directly from their Box account on PowerPoint. Improved support for TalkBack is another new feature that has been added to all three Office apps, including enhancements to keyboard and other assistive technologies. Aside from support for Box, Microsoft also added Egnyte and Weyun integration, which allows users to store and access their files on the move. It's also worth noting that users will now get a notification when there's activity in their shared documents.The Excel app also received a new Maps chart type that turns geographic data into professional looking maps. Also files that contain ActiveX controls, or web and text queries can now be opened. The update should also bring some improvements to hyperlinks on Excel, so users will now allow users to set a text for hyperlink instead than showing the full link. The updated apps are already up on Google Play store, so anyone can download them now. Word for Android",

      "text": "Rumor: Microsoft Surface Phone to be powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 Rumor: Microsoft Surface Phone to be powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 Posted: Tags : Windows - Windows + Microsoft - Microsoft + While Microsoft is pretty much done with the Lumia brand , it's certainly not done with making smartphones. As reported many times before, Microsoft is planning to release a Surface Phone next year. The latest rumors surrounding the Surface Phone come from Nokia Power User (a pretty reliable website). Reportedly, Microsoft is currently working on at least two Surface Phone prototypes, one with 4 GB of RAM, and one with 6 GB of RAM. It's said that both are powered by Qualcomm's brand new and very powerful Snapdragon 835 processor - which might also be used by Samsung for its upcoming Galaxy S8 series. The 6 GB prototype can allegedly run x86 apps via Continuum , while the 4 GB model can not. Apparently, the current Surface Phone prototypes have Quad HD (1440 x 2560 pixels) displays of around 5.5-inches, and may come with \"laptop accessories\" - possibly including a Surface Pro-like keyboard cover and a stylus pen. Of course, for now, we can't really confirm any of the details presented above. Up to three Surface Phone models could be released in late 2017 running Windows 10 Mobile Redstone 3. Compared to Redstone 2 (which should be available for current Windows 10 phones early next year), Redstone 3 is expected to be a much larger and more important update. P.S.: What you're seeing above is a Surface Phone render based on rumors. PhoneArena is on Instagram . Follow us to stay updated with fresh news and flashy media from the world of mobile!",

      "title": "Microsoft Not Giving Up Against Amazon - The War Rages On",
      "text": "Microsoft has released the world’s most advanced container service via Windows Server 2016. \nMeanwhile, Amazon has made a deal with VMware for diversifying its hybrid cloud offerings. \nContainers will allow Microsoft not to lose ground against Amazon. \nGoldman Sachs recently upgraded Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) to buy from neutral, and raised price target to $68 from $60. Goldman Sachs believes that Microsoft's gross profit will grow at an accelerating pace and gross profit margin will improve due to Azure's cloud opportunities. \nSince profitability is a matter of managerial accounting and difficult to predict, I'm not sure about profitability. However, I believe Microsoft's revenue will rise significantly going forward since the company is offering customers the world's most sophisticated, advanced and diversified container support via its recent launch of Windows Server 2016. Containers also will help Microsoft win the war against Amazon's (NASDAQ: AMZN ) AWS despite the latter's recent deal with VMware (NYSE: VMW ). \nContainers: Microsoft's New Growth Driver \nWindows Server 2016, Microsoft's latest server operating system, will help Microsoft's customers run applications both off-premises (via Azure) and on-premises with equal efficiency, which will make Microsoft a stronger hybrid cloud player in the IaaS (Infrastructure-as-a-Service) market. Containers will help Microsoft boost its cloud revenue. \nUse of containers will rise substantially in datacenters with Microsoft's extended and advanced support for Docker containers via Windows Server 2016. As a result, Microsoft will achieve two things. Gradually containers will become the standard mode of virtualization for lighter, web-based applications instead of VMs (virtual machines). With supporting container-based virtualization, Microsoft will be able to grab a significant part of the market share of cloud infrastructure leader Amazon. Microsoft provides its cloud infrastructure services primarily to large corporations. With extending the benefits of containers to SMBs (small and medium businesses) via Nano Server, Microsoft's cloud presence will expand in the SMB space as well. \nContainers Will Make Microsoft Stronger Than AWS \nContainers offer virtualization by consuming much less system resources compared to VMs. While VMs need an entire OS (operating system) to run along with copies of hardware the OS uses, for containers, a portion of an OS is sufficient. In addition, containers can accommodate more apps compared to VMs. \nHowever, since containers share the kernel of the host OS, they are less secure. Microsoft has released two types of containers, namely Windows Server containers and Hyper-V containers. Enterprises can deploy the containers via Docker APIs and Docker client. Hyper-V containers are capable of providing a container its own kernel for offering more security. \nNow the question is how Microsoft will be able to grab Amazon's market share? Amazon and VMware made a deal in October for extending the latter's VM-based server virtualization platform vSphere into AWS public cloud. For running on-premises applications on cloud they need to be rewritten, which is a difficult and time-consuming task. The deal aims to make the task a lot easier and faster. \nDespite being a strong VM-based virtualization player, VMware's presence in the public cloud market is insignificant. On the other hand, Amazon doesn't have a strong presence in the hybrid cloud market. While VMware's interest in the deal is to expand its public cloud footprint, Amazon's interest is capturing the hybrid cloud market. The Amazon-VMware deal will intensify competition in the hybrid cloud space, and Microsoft will also feel competitive pressure. Containers will help Microsoft fight competition. \nServer virtualization is a crucial cloud infrastructure component. Microsoft already has a stable VM-based virtualization market share. It offers both Linux VMs and Windows Server VMs via Azure. Now it is offering sophisticated container-based virtualization, which makes it the world's leading virtualization company. Microsoft has a rich portfolio of software suites targeted at the IaaS space, which the company will be able to sell to customers that will use its virtualization platforms. \nMicrosoft has introduced Nano Server with Windows Server 2016. Nano Server is a smaller version of Windows Server 2016. It's actually 20-25 times smaller compared to Windows Server 2016 and targeted at the SMB segment, as mentioned above. Nano Server can be used as the OS for both Windows Server containers and Hyper-V containers. As a result, SMBs can use most of the features of Docker containers. Nano Server will help Microsoft address the needs of relatively small companies. \nConclusion \nI believe Microsoft will come significantly closer to Amazon when Windows Server 2016 and Azure Stack will dominate the cloud IaaS market in full swing. In a previous article , I discussed the prospects of Microsoft's upcoming Azure Stack. According to VentureBeat , Microsoft's revenue from Azure climbed 116% in the third quarter of this year compared to Amazon's 58% in the second quarter. Clearly, Microsoft is growing faster and about to surpass Amazon. Disclosure: I am/we are long MSFT.    ",

      "text": "by Joe Durbin • November 25th, 2016 \nTesla — the battery-powered future-car company led by Silicon Valley superstar, Ellon Musk — has reportedly hired away one of Microsoft’s top designers. Andrew Kim spent three and a half years at Microsoft but will now join the forward-thinking automotive company as a senior designer, according to his LinkedIn account . Kim’s hiring is particularly eyebrow raising due to his heavy involvement on Microsoft’s augmented reality project: HoloLens. \nHoloLens uses a variety of cutting edge optics, depth sensing cameras and powerful onboard mobile computing to overlay realistic holographic images on top of your everyday world. Kim’s official duties at Tesla have not officially been revealed, but his experience with HoloLens raises the possibility that he has arrived at the new company to share his AR knowledge and to help the startup delve deeper into immersive technologies. \nHeads-up displays on cars are nothing new. The concept has been around for years and are now making their way into vehicles via various third party accessories . However, a true augmented reality car —one that natively turns your windshield into a map, your mirrors into traffic monitors, etc. — has yet to be seen. Tesla is exactly the kind of company that would be interested in pioneering that type of future and its interest in Kim, while far from a confirmation that a system like this is in the works, is at the very least encouraging for those hoping to see cars integrate more bleeding edge technology. \nBefore joining Microsoft, Kim was a student at Art Center College of Design in Pasadena California. He originally caught Microsoft’s eye by producing a series of concepts for new branding designs that the computing giant could adopt. Prior to beginning work on the HoloLens team, Kim was deeply involved in the creation of the Xbox One S . \nKim’s matriculation from Microsoft to Tesla may herald a mass exodus of talented tech professionals making the jump from established companies to exciting immersive startups as 2016 draws to a close.",

      "text": "By Tiernan Ray Here are some things going on today in your world of tech :\nWelcome back from your holiday feast, for those in the United States. Shares of large-cap tech are mostly trading higher, with Amazon ( AMZN ) up $5.62, or 0.7%, at $785.74, in early trading; Alphabet ( GOOGL ) up $2.50, or 0.3%, at $781.50; Intel ( INTC ) up 9 cents at $35.29; and Facebook ( FB ) up 25 cents at $121.09. Notable laggards in early trading are down 6 cents at $111.17; and IBM ( IBM ) is down 19 cents at $161.79.\nBlack Friday selling mania is in full effect, and MarketWatch ’s Barbara Kollmeyer reports that an early start to deals drove a 13.6% increase, year over year, in online electronics sales, as “U.S. shoppers hit their mobile devices and laptops to shop on Thanksgiving Day, racking up sales of over $1.15 billion.”\nSpeaking of deals, Apple has unveiled its Black Friday discounts, which aren’t really discounts but rather offers of gift cards to buy more stuff from Apple when you buy select products. Reflecting on this, Brian White with Drexel Hamilton reiterates a Buy rating on the stock, and a $185 price target, writing that the company “remains one of the best positioned tech companies to benefit from spending trends this holiday season with a well-received iPhone 7/7 Plus, a new Apple Watch and a new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar.”\nIn just 72 hours, of course, it’ll be time for Cyber Monday , for which Amazon has not yet unveiled its own deals, but rather teases you to come back and check out the page at the start of next week .\nAmong research items today, an interesting tidbit on the mobile market comes from Richard Windsor , who used to be a big brokerage-house analyst then parted to do his own thing. This morning he offers up his daily analysis of tech, in this cases assessing Microsoft ’s next act in mobile phones .\nSadly, it seems the next act may be as bad as the recent ones. Windsor expects Microsoft to a “Surface Phone,” to complement devices like its Surface Studio computer. But while Studio and other tools are “best in class,” to lure Apple and Google Android users, “Microsoft will have to make its Digital Life offering utterly compelling to convince even these users to move their Digital Lives to Microsoft, and in that regard I see nothing but neglect and malaise.”",

      "title": "Surface Phone Rumors Rekindled After Microsoft CEO Tease: Latest Specs, Release Date And Features",
      "text": "\nRumors about the Surface Phone have been rekindled this week, after the device appeared to be teased by none other than Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella himself. While the CEO did not officially confirm the existence or the development of the mobile device, Nadella did state that once Microsoft enters the mobile market once more, it would be with a device that can stand tall amidst the intense competition in the smartphone industry. \nThe CEO’s statements, taken from an interview with the Australian Financial Review , appeared to assure the tech giant’s supporters that Microsoft is hard at work in ensuring that the firm would have a significant presence in the smartphone market in the near future. While the CEO did not specifically describe the steps that the company is taking in order to achieve its goals, Nadella did reference the “ultimate mobile device,” which is set to bring something completely new to the market.\n“We don’t want to be driven by just envy of what others have, the question is, what can we bring? That’s where I look at any device form factor or any technology, even A.I. We will continue to be in the phone market not as defined by today’s market leaders, but by what it is that we can uniquely do in what is the most ultimate mobile device.”\nConsidering that the smartphone market is hyper competitive and is already over-saturated with devices using Android and iOS, there still exists a number of innovative windows that Microsoft could take advantage of. Over the years, the smartphone market has somewhat stagnated, with newer devices simply being equipped with more advanced versions of the same features. Apple has done this successfully with the iPhone for years, launching phones with incremental upgrades year after year. Even premiere Android smartphone makers such as Samsung have done the same with its Galaxy S and Note line, with largely similar results.\n[Image by Andrew Burton/Getty Images] Thus, Microsoft’s decision to make the rumored Surface Phone into a device that offers something unique for consumers is something that is both bold and admirable. While consumers largely reject devices with concepts that are far too radical, such as the LG G5, numerous smartphone fans have been lamenting for years that the mobile market has reached a plateau and is in need of something new and fresh. If Microsoft could properly strike a balance between innovative usability and a compelling, unique design, the Surface Phone might very well be the surprise hit of 2017. \nRumors of a Surface Phone have been emerging on the internet for some time now, with numerous speculations surrounding the upcoming device. After the success of the Surface Pro line of devices and the failure of Microsoft’s efforts to capitalize on Nokia’s smartphone business, many believed that the only way for the tech giant to make significant waves in the mobile segment was to adopt the Surface brand and build its own smartphone from the ground up. \nSuch a strategy has worked well for Microsoft in recent years, with its current products such as the Surface Pro 4 being the golden standard for hybrid devices, the Surface Book being one of the finest Windows laptops in the market, and the Surface Studio breaking new ground in the world of All-in-One PCs. With this in mind, the decision to use the Surface brand to market its flagship mobile phone would be very beneficial for Microsoft, considering the prestige that the Surface name has gained over the years.\nSpeculations about the Surface Phone’s specs are abounding, with the latest rumors pointing to a powerful device that would most likely feature a 7th-generation Intel processor or Qualcomm’s upcoming Snapdragon 835 chip . Neither of these rumors has been confirmed, but both do point to the notion that Microsoft’s flagship smartphone would most likely feature the best processor that the industry can offer. Other speculations point to the Surface Phone being launched with three variants, with entry-level variant featuring 4GB RAM and 128GB of storage, a mid-level version featuring 6GB of RAM and 256GB of storage and a top-tier version equipped with a massive 8GB of RAM and a whopping 512GB of storage.\n[Image by Andrew Burton/Getty Images] While these rumored specs seem a bit excessive, they are plausible nonetheless, mainly due to the Surface Phone’s alleged killer feature – a refined version of Continuum . Continuum, a feature that allows users to plug the smartphone to an external monitor and essentially transform the device into a full-fledged PC, has been introduced in previous models such as the Lumia 950. The feature was widely panned by critics when it was launched, however, with many stating that Continuum just seemed too unrefined and sluggish when it was introduced. Despite this, the idea of turning a smartphone into a fully-fledged laptop-grade device is still a novel idea. Considering the Surface Phone’s rumored specs, it seems possible that Microsoft might be going for a smoother Continuum feature. \nThe release date for the device has not been officially announced by Microsoft, though speculations are split between a Q1 2017 and an April 2017 release date. While the exact date remains unknown, however, the Surface Phone is widely expected to be launched alongside the Surface Pro 5 and the Surface Book 2, both of which are also speculated to be launched within the first half of 2017. \nMicrosoft’s mobile ventures and Windows 10 Mobile are far from over. Despite numerous speculations stating that the platform has died due to the consistent failures of previous flagship devices, the story might be different once the Surface Phone enters the market. The Surface Phone, built from the ground up to be used with Windows Mobile and carrying all the latest features from the tech giant, might very well be the device that would make the biggest splash in the smartphone market next year. The smartphone industry badly needs a game-changing device, and if rumors prove true about its specs and features, the Surface Phone might very well be the right product for the job. \n[Featured Image by Mat Hayward/Getty Images]\nSurface Phone Rumors Rekindled After Microsoft CEO Tease: Latest Specs, Release Date And Features is an article from: The Inquisitr News \n",

Its launch coincides with the arrival of the Windows 10 operating system, where it comes built-in, although it becomes more portable and helpful with the use of its official Android app. With this assistant, you can send commands or questions with your voice or the virtual keyboard. It uses your browsing preferences, current location, and installed apps to respond. This way, you can ask questions that can be searched for online (through Bing, also owned by Microsoft), or have Cortana perform more difficult actions like saving reminders or editing your contacts. Using the geolocation system on your device, Cortana can suggest nearby attractions or the fastest way to get to a certain place. Thanks to Cortana's card system, you can see all sorts of information on the main menu, just like a homepage, including local news and weather.

      "text": "Downloads \n141.2 k Microsoft PowerPoint is the official Android app for one of the most-used programs in the world at a business level: PowerPoint. In the PC version, the program from Microsoft has always been the king of presentations; now, with this app, it's attempting to do the same in Android. Users of Microsoft PowerPoint can do practically everything in the app that they could with the traditional Windows program: create presentations with as many slides as you want, choose among dozens of different styles and designs, insert text and images, etc. In short, you'll have total freedom when creating presentations. One of the most interesting options in Microsoft PowerPoint is that you can start a presentation in Android and finish it in Windows. To do so, you just have to sign in with your user account. In addition, of course, you can import or export any PPT or PPX file. Microsoft PowerPoint is an excellent tool for making presentations and includes all the tools and features you could possibly want. How to use Microsoft Office on your Android device \nDespite how easy it is to use Microsoft Office on Android devices it's sure is hard to convince people to make the switch from their desktops onto their smartphones. Even more so when it comes to traditionally desktop bound functions like word processing. The truth is, these days connecting a smartphone to an external monitor or physical keyboard is easy enough, and using Microsoft Office on Android devices is a more portable and lightweight option than ever. Even more so when you stop to consider costs, there is a completely free (you read right, it costs exactly $0) app for the most usual Microsoft Office tools and they ready to use on Android devices. The only problem is that most of us aren't taking full advantage of this great package. Here are our answers to your questions.",

      "title": "Rumor: Microsoft Working on x86 Emulation for ARM64",
      "text": "Tagged: x86 , windows 10 , microsoft , arm \nAccording to Mary Jo Foley at ZDNet , Microsoft is working on emulating the x86 instruction set on ARM64. Her sources further claim that this is intended to be a Windows 10 feature that is targeting Redstone 3, which is the feature update expected in late 2017 (after the upcoming Creators Update in early 2017). Of course, Microsoft will not comment on this rumor. Mary Jo Foley is quite good at holding out on publishing until she gets multiple, independent sources, though. Still, projects slip, pivot, and outright die all of the time, even if the information was true at one point. Media Center is still dead, though. \nSo, while keeping in mind that this might not be true, and, even if it is, it could change: let’s think. \nThe current speculation is that this might be aimed at enterprise customers, including a potential partnership with HP and Qualcomm. This makes sense for a few reasons, especially when you combine it with Microsoft and Samsung’s recent efforts to port .NET Core to ARM . Combining rumors like this might be akin to smashing two rocks together, but you never know if it’ll spark something. Anyway, you would expect these sorts of apps could jump architectures fairly well, because they’re probably not real-time, form-based applications. You might be able to get a comfortable enough user experience, even with the inherent overhead of translating individual instructions. \nA nother possibility is that Microsoft hasn’t given up on the Windows 8 / Windows RT vision. \nBack in that era, the whole OS seemed designed to push users toward their new platform, Metro. The desktop was an app, and that app contained all of the Win32 bits, isolating them from the rest of the PC and surrounding that tile with everything WinRT. The new platform was seductive for Microsoft in a few ways. First, it was more secure, and people considered Windows the operating system that’s plagued with malware. Second, it let them assert control over their apps, like Apple does with their App Store. At the time, they even demanded that third-party web browsers be nothing more than re-skins of Internet Explorer. Firefox? Don’t even think about bringing Gecko in here. It’s Trident or bust. \nSay what you like about those first two points, I know I have, and often disapprovingly from an art enthusiast standpoint , but there was a third one that also interested Microsoft: \nHardware independence . \nThe WinRT runtime, when it was first unveiled, was pretty much designed in a way that Microsoft could swap out everything underneath it if they wanted to jump ship and move to a new architecture. At the time, almost a decade ago, Intel wasn’t competitive against ARM in the mobile space. This kept Windows applications, and Microsoft, watching the rest of the world sail away. \nBut supporting both ARM and x86 isn’t good enough. What if IBM wins next time? Or a completely different instruction set? If everything calls an API that can be uprooted and transplanted elsewhere? There will never need to be this mobile concern again. \nBut then we have this whole decades of stuff that already exists problem. While I don’t like the frog boil analogy, it could be Microsoft’s attempt to uproot enough x86-locked content that people can accept UWP. I’m not sure that will work out, especially since we rely upon real-time software that is not accepting Windows Store, but it might be their goal. \nWhat do you all think?",

      "text": "on Friday November 25, 2016 @08:05PM from the shiny-new dept. An anonymous reader quotes a report from Windows Central: Microsoft has made several adjustments to its design language over the last few years, starting with Windows 8 and evolving into what we now know as \" Microsoft Design Language 2 \" or MDL2 in Windows 10. With MDL2 being the current design language used throughout Windows 10, Microsoft has plans to begin using a much more streamlined design language with Redstone 3 , codenamed Project NEON. Cassim Ketfi at Numerama.com confirms our information and has heard Project NEON called \"basically Metro 2.\" That designation refers to the first Metro design language (nee Modern) that harkens to Windows Media Center up through Windows Phone 7 and Windows 8. Per our sources, Project NEON has been in the works for over a year internally at Microsoft. It builds upon the design language introduced with Windows 10, with its simple and clean interfaces, but adds some much-needed flair to the UI that the current design language just lacks. Details are still scarce, but we hear some of the new designs in the plans include adding more animations and transitions, with the overall goal of making the UI very fluid and \"beautiful\" compared to the current, almost static UI that is MDL2. One source familiar with Microsoft's plans described NEON as \"Very fluid, lots of motion and nice transitions.\" Some more information about NEON reveals that it serves as a bridge between holographic and augmented reality (AR) and the desktop environment. It's a \"UI that transports across devices\" with a UX that maps to the physical world. It uses textures, 3D models, lighting and more.",

      "text": "Microsoft’s computer straight out of science fiction New York Times Published 5:26 pm, Friday, November 25, 2016 \nMicrosoft is putting its considerable financial and engineering muscle into the experimental field of quantum computing as it works to build a machine that could tackle problems beyond the reach of today’s digital computers. \nThere is a growing optimism in the tech world that quantum computers, superpowerful devices that were once the stuff of science fiction, are possible — and may even be practical. If these machines work, they will have an impact on work in areas such as drug design and artificial intelligence, as well as offer a better understanding of the foundations of modern physics. \nMicrosoft’s decision to move from pure research to an expensive effort to build a working prototype underscores a global competition among technology companies, including Google and IBM, that are also making significant investments in search of breakthroughs. \nIn the exotic world of quantum physics, Microsoft has set itself apart from its competitors by choosing a different path. The company’s approach is based on “braiding” particles known as anyons — which physicists describe as existing in just two dimensions — to form the building blocks of a supercomputer that would exploit the unusual physical properties of subatomic particles. \nLeading researchers acknowledge that barriers still remain to building useful quantum machines, both at the level of basic physics and in developing new kinds of software to exploit certain qualities of devices known as qubits that hold out the possibility of computing in ways not possible for today’s digital systems. \nUnlike conventional transistors, which can be only on or off at any one time, representing a digital 1 or 0, qubits can exist in superposition, or simultaneously in both states. If qubits are placed in an “entangled” state — physically separated but acting as though they are deeply intertwined — with many other qubits, they can represent a vast number of values simultaneously. A quantum computer would most likely consist of hundreds or thousands of qubits. \nMicrosoft began funding research in the field in 2005 when it quietly set up a laboratory known as Station Q under the leadership of mathematician Michael Freedman . \nMicrosoft now believes it is close enough to designing the basic qubit building block that the company is ready to begin engineering a complete computer, said Todd Holmdahl , a veteran engineering manager who will direct the Microsoft effort. Over the years, he has led various Microsoft projects, including its Xbox video game machine and the yet-to-be-released HoloLens augmented-reality system. \n“Once we get the first qubit figured out, we have a road map that allows us to go to thousands of qubits in a rather straightforward way,” Holmdahl said. \nThere is still a debate among physicists and computer scientists over whether quantum computers that perform useful calculations will ever be created. \nA variety of alternative research programs are trying to create qubits using different materials and designs. The Microsoft approach, known as topological quantum computing, is based on a field that took on new energy when this year’s Nobel Prize in physics was awarded to three scientists who had done fundamental work in forms of matter that may exist in just two dimensions. \nHolmdahl’s project will also include physicists Leo Kouwenhoven of Delft University , Charles Marcus of the University of Copenhagen , David Reilly of the University of Sydney and Matthias Troyer of ETH Zurich . \nThey will all become Microsoft employees as part of the Artificial Intelligence and Research Group that Microsoft recently created under the leadership of one of its top technical employees, Harry Shum . \nMicrosoft’s newly hired physicists say the decision to try to build a topological quantum computer comes after scientific advances made in the past two years that give the scientists growing confidence that the company will be able to create more stable qubits. \n“The magic recipe involves a combination of semiconductors and superconductors,” Marcus said. The researchers recently made a “remarkable breakthrough” in their ability to control the materials used to form qubits, he said. Most of the competing approaches involve cooling quantum computers to near absolute zero temperatures. \nSo far, there are relatively few proven algorithms that could be used to solve problems more quickly than today’s digital computers. One early effort, known as Shor’s algorithm, would be used to factor numbers, giving hope that quantum computers might be used in the future for breaking codes. \nThat would potentially have world-shaking consequences because modern electronic commerce is built on cryptographic systems that are largely unbreakable using conventional digital computers. Other proposed approaches might allow faster searching of databases or perform machine learning algorithms, which are being used to make advances in computer vision and speech recognition. \nMore immediately, however, these tools might advance the basic understanding of physics, a possibility physicist Richard Feynman mentioned when he speculated about the idea of a quantum computer in 1982. \nFor his part, Kouwenhoven said, “My dream application for a quantum computer would be a machine that could solve problems in quantum physics.”  ",

      "text": "Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends \nWindows 10 offers a number of enhancements that makes it perhaps the best Windows operating system version yet. There is the Cortana digital personal assistant , Universal Windows Platform for apps that run on desktops, notebooks, 2-in-1s, and phones, and significantly improved security . \nOne area where Windows 10 hasn’t quite made the mark is in its user interface, which could be called simplistic and underwhelming in its design cues. It appears that Microsoft is well aware of these deficiencies and is planning to improve the UI with Project Neon in the Redstone 3 update in late 2017, according to Windows Central . \nMore: Windows 10 Anniversary Update cements its status as the best operating system ever \nThrough the Creators Update set to arrive in early 2017 and slowly rolling out now via the Windows Insider program, Windows 10’s user interface has been a continuation of the Metro design concept that start with Windows 7 Media Center and continued through various iterations of Windows Phone. Dubbed Microsoft Design Language 2, or MDL2, the current look and feel of Windows 10 is just more of the same. \nBeginning with the Redstone 3 update due in the early fall of 2017, however, Windows 10 will receive a more streamlined facelift via Project Neon. The focus of Neon will be adding some excitement to a flatter UI without the kind of enhancements that make an OS more interesting to look at. \nAccording to Windows Central, “Details are still scarce, but we hear some of the new designs in the plans include adding more animations and transitions, with the overall goal of making the UI very fluid and ‘beautiful’ compared to the current, almost static UI that is MDL2. One source familiar with Microsoft’s plans described Neon as, ‘Very fluid, lots of motion and nice transitions.'” \nIn addition, Neon could incorporate some design concepts to bridge Windows Holographic and HoloLens with the Windows 10 desktop. Details are sketchy on how 3D concepts would translate to 2D displays, but textures, 3D models, lighting effects, and more could be involved. \nMore: Windows Holographic will be on your PC by the end of 2017 \nProject Neon looks to be evolutionary rather than revolutionary, holding onto the relatively simple UI that Windows 10 enjoys but making it more attractive to look at. The refresh will also offer developers more direction in how to make apps that are more visually appealing than current Universal Windows Apps. \nAccording to Windows Central, Project Neon should show up with Redstone 3 early in the fall of 2017. Redstone 4, which will arrive in 2018, will offer developers the ability to implement Project Neon in their own apps. It looks like it won’t be too terribly long, then, before Windows 10 users will have an operating system that is as nice to look at as it is to use. Also watch: HP Spectre Review",

      "text": "» News & Magazin-Redakteur Nachdem der CEO von Microsoft, Satya Nadelle, schon vor ein paar Tagen angekündigt hat, dass Microsoft das \"ultimative Smartphone\" herstellen wird, wurden nun Berichte veröffentlicht, denen zufolge Microsoft im Moment mehrere sogenannte Surface-Phones testet. Den Gerüchten zufolge, soll dabei ein Modell auf einen Snapdragon 635 als SoC setzen, 6 GB RAM haben und auf eine Version von Windows 10 Mobile setzen, die vollständig 64 Bit unterstützt. Letzteres ist für Smartphones aus dem Hause Microsoft eine Neuheit, da bisher, trotz technischem CPU-Support, nur auf 32 bit gesetzt wurde. Was ein mögliches Smartphone aus dem Hause Microsoft auch noch interessant macht, ist die mögliche Weiterentwicklung von Microsoft Continuum. Dieses Feature würde nochmal interessanter werden, wenn Microsoft seine Software implementieren würde, welche es ermöglicht x86-Programme auf einem ARM-basierten System laufen zu lassen. Mit Microsoft Continuum hat der Konzern ein Feature veröffentlicht, welches es ermöglicht sein Smartphone an ein Monitor anzuschließen und als kleinen Desktop PC zu nutzen. Das Feature kränkelte allerdings an schlechter Performance und unzulänglichen App-Support. Zu guter letzt wird hier nochmal betont, dass die Informationen, welche die Smartphones betreffen, nicht bestätigt sind. Tests",

Time of Publication: 7:00 pm. 7:00 pm Microsoft Bets Its Future on a Reprogrammable Computer Chip Prototype hardware for Project Catapult, a six-year effort to rebuild Microsoft's online empire for the next wave of AI---and more. Clayton Cotterell for WIRED \nIt was December 2012, and Doug Burger was standing in front of Steve Ballmer, trying to predict the future. \nBallmer, the big, bald, boisterous CEO of Microsoft , sat in the lecture room on the ground floor of Building 99, home base for the company’s blue-sky R&D lab just outside Seattle. The tables curved around the outside of the room in a U-shape, and Ballmer was surrounded by his top lieutenants, his laptop open. Burger, a computer chip researcher who had joined the company four years earlier, was pitching a new idea to the execs. He called it Project Catapult. Doug Burger. Clayton Cotterell for WIRED \nThe tech world, Burger explained, was moving into a new orbit. In the future, a few giant Internet companies would operate a few giant Internet services so complex and so different from what came before that these companies would have to build a whole new architecture to run them . They would create not just the software driving these services, but the hardware, including servers and networking gear . Project Catapult would equip all of Microsoft’s servers —millions of them—with specialized chips that the company could reprogram for particular tasks. \nBut before Burger could even get to the part about the chips, Ballmer looked up from his laptop. When he visited Microsoft Research, Ballmer said, he expected updates on R&D, not a strategy briefing. “He just started grilling me,” Burger says. Microsoft had spent 40 years building PC software like Windows, Word, and Excel. It was only just finding its feet on the Internet. And it certainly didn’t have the tools and the engineers needed to program computer chips—a task that’s difficult, time consuming, expensive, and kind of weird. Microsoft programming computer chips was like Coca Cola making shark fin soup. The current incarnation of Project Catapult. Clayton Cotterell for WIRED \nBurger—trim, only slightly bald, and calmly analytical, like so many good engineers—pushed back. He told Ballmer that companies like Google and Amazon were already moving in this direction . He said the world’s hardware makers wouldn’t provide what Microsoft needed to run its online services. He said that Microsoft would fall behind if it didn’t build its own hardware. Ballmer wasn’t buying it. But after awhile, another voice joined the discussion. This was Qi Lu, who runs Bing, Microsoft’s search engine. Lu’s team had been talking to Burger about reprogrammable computer chips for almost two years. Project Catapult was more than possible, Lu said: His team had already started. \nToday, the programmable chips that Burger and Lu believed would transform the world—called field programmable gate arrays—are here. FPGAs already underpin Bing, and in the coming weeks, they will drive new search algorithms based on deep neural networks— artificial intelligence modeled on the structure of the human brain —executing this AI several orders of magnitude faster than ordinary chips could. As in, 23 milliseconds instead of four seconds of nothing on your screen. FPGAs also drive Azure, the company’s cloud computing service. And in the coming years, almost every new Microsoft server will include an FPGA. That’s millions of machines across the globe. “This gives us massive capacity and enormous flexibility, and the economics work,” Burger says. “This is now Microsoft’s standard, worldwide architecture.” Catapult team members Adrian Caulfield, Eric Chung, Doug Burger, and Andrew Putnam Clayton Cotterell for WIRED \nThis isn’t just Bing playing catch-up with Google . Project Catapult signals a change in how global systems will operate in the future. From Amazon in the US to Baidu in China, all the Internet giants are supplementing their standard server chips—central processing units, or CPUs— with alternative silicon that can keep pace with the rapid changes in AI . Microsoft now spends between $5 and $6 billion a year for the hardware needed to run its online empire. So this kind of work is “no longer just research,” says Satya Nadella, who took over as Microsoft’s CEO in 2014. “It’s an essential priority.” That’s what Burger was trying to explain in Building 99. And it’s what drove him and his team to overcome years of setbacks, redesigns, and institutional entropy to deliver a new kind of global supercomputer. A Brand New, Very Old Kind of Computer Chip \nIn December of 2010, Microsoft researcher Andrew Putnam had left Seattle for the holidays and returned home to Colorado Springs. Two days before Christmas, he still hadn’t started shopping. As he drove to the mall, his phone rang. It was Burger, his boss. Burger was going to meet with Bing execs right after the holiday, and he needed a design for hardware that could run Bing’s machine learning algorithms on FPGAs. \nPutnam pulled into the nearest Starbucks and drew up the plans. It took him about five hours, and he still had time for shopping. \nBurger, 47, and Putnam, 39, are both former academics. Burger spent nine years as a professor of computer science at the University of Texas, Austin, where he specialized in microprocessors and designed a new kind of chip called EDGE. Putnam had worked for five years as a researcher at the University of Washington, where he experimented with FPGAs, programmable chips that had been around for decades but were mostly used as a way of prototyping other processors. Burger brought Putnam to Microsoft in 2009, where they started exploring the idea that these chips could actually accelerate online services. Project Catapult Version 1, or V1, the hardware that Doug Burger and team tested in a data center on Microsoft’s Seattle campus. Clayton Cotterell for WIRED \nEven their boss didn’t buy it. “Every two years, FGPAs are ‘finally going to arrive,’” says Microsoft Research vice president Peter Lee, who oversees Burger’s group. “So, like any reasonable person, I kind of rolled my eyes when this was pitched.” But Burger and his team believed this old idea’s time had come, and Bing was the perfect test case. \nMicrosoft’s search engine is a single online service that runs across thousands of machines. Each machine is driven by a CPU, and though companies like Intel continue to improve them, these chips aren’t keeping pace with advances in software, in large part because of the new wave in artificial intelligence . Services like Bing have outstripped Moore’s Law, the canonical notion that the number of transistors in a processor doubles every 18 months. Turns out, you can’t just throw more CPUs at the problem . \nBut on the other hand, it’s generally too expensive to create specialized, purpose-built chips for every new problem. FPGAs bridge the gap . They let engineers build chips that are faster and less energy-hungry than an assembly-line, general-purpose CPU, but customizable so they handle the new problems of ever-shifting technologies and business models. \nAt that post-holiday meeting, Burger pitched Bing’s execs on FPGAs as a low-power way of accelerating searches. The execs were noncommittal. So over the next several months, Burger and team took Putnam’s Christmas sketch and built a prototype, showing that it could run Bing’s machine learning algorithms about 100 times faster. “That’s when they really got interested,” says Jim Larus, another member of the team back then who’s now a dean at Switzerland’s École Polytechnique Fédérale in Lausanne. “They also started giving us a really hard time.” Tech Titan Architectures ",

Therefore, we stopped doing things that were me-too and started doing things, even if they are today very sub-scale, to be very focused on a specific set of customers who need a specific set of capabilities that are differentiated and that we can do a good job of,\" Nadella stated. \nAs of what the Microsoft Surface Phone can offer to consumers, Nadella did not delve into details. Although there is no confirmation from Microsoft, a lot of speculations have started coming.

      "text": "windows user interface to be updated via project neon mail More Anton Watman/Shutterstock\nWindows 10 offers a number of enhancements that makes it perhaps the best Windows operating system version yet. There is the Cortana digital personal assistant , Universal Windows Platform for apps that run on desktops, notebooks, 2-in-1s, and phones, and significantly improved security .\nOne area where Windows 10 hasn’t quite made the mark is in its user interface, which could be called simplistic and underwhelming in its design cues. It appears that Microsoft is well aware of these deficiencies and is planning to improve the UI with Project Neon in the Redstone 3 update in late 2017, according to Windows Central .\nMore: Windows 10 Anniversary Update cements its status as the best operating system ever\nThrough the Creators Update set to arrive in early 2017 and slowly rolling out now via the Windows Insider program, Windows 10’s user interface has been a continuation of the Metro design concept that start with Windows 7 Media Center and continued through various iterations of Windows Phone. Dubbed Microsoft Design Language 2, or MDL2, the current look and feel of Windows 10 is just more of the same.\nBeginning with the Redstone 3 update due in the early fall of 2017, however, Windows 10 will receive a more streamlined facelift via Project Neon. The focus of Neon will be adding some excitement to a flatter UI without the kind of enhancements that make an OS more interesting to look at.\nAccording to Windows Central, “Details are still scarce, but we hear some of the new designs in the plans include adding more animations and transitions, with the overall goal of making the UI very fluid and ‘beautiful’ compared to the current, almost static UI that is MDL2. One source familiar with Microsoft’s plans described Neon as, ‘Very fluid, lots of motion and nice transitions.'”\nIn addition, Neon could incorporate some design concepts to bridge Windows Holographic and HoloLens with the Windows 10 desktop. Details are sketchy on how 3D concepts would translate to 2D displays, but textures, 3D models, lighting effects, and more could be involved.\nMore: Windows Holographic will be on your PC by the end of 2017\nProject Neon looks to be evolutionary rather than revolutionary, holding onto the relatively simple UI that Windows 10 enjoys but making it more attractive to look at. The refresh will also offer developers more direction in how to make apps that are more visually appealing than current Universal Windows Apps.\nAccording to Windows Central, Project Neon should show up with Redstone 3 early in the fall of 2017. Redstone 4, which will arrive in 2018, will offer developers the ability to implement Project Neon in their own apps. It looks like it won’t be too terribly long, then, before Windows 10 users will have an operating system that is as nice to look at as it is to use.\nCreators Update will begin rolling out to Insiders soon starting with Paint 3D HP plans to make good use of the 3D tech in the Windows 10 Creators Update Windows 10 Preview Build points to March 2017 release date for Redstone 2",

      "text": "Microsoft Seeks to Grow Cloud Position in China (MSFT, BABA) By Richard Saintvilus | November 25, 2016 — 7:26 PM EST \nMicrosoft Corporation's ( MSFT ) Azure cloud platform has about 17% market share in China, second to Alibaba Group Holding Limited ( BABA ). But Microsoft believes it can grow its market share by making some well-timed moves. \nAccording to the South China Morning Post, Microsoft has begun to expand development in China by strengthening its partnerships in the region. The company, which introduced its cloud computing business in mainland China more than two years ago, sees partnerships as a critical component to its cloud business' growth strategy. (See also: Cloud Battle Gets More Intelligent .) \nLeading that charge is Alain Crozier, who in July was appointed Microsoft's new chairman and chief executive for Greater China operations. \"Partnerships are front and center of our strategy to accelerate the growth of our cloud business in this market,\" Crozier told the South China Morning Post. \"The Microsoft of today is very different from the one [we had] five or 10 years ago.\" \nAs with Alibaba and Amazon.com, Inc. ( AMZN ), the number three holder of market share in China, the cloud is an important area of growth for Microsoft, especially amid the recent declines in personal computer sales. To date, Windows and Office still rank as Microsoft's bread-and-butter business. But the company doesn't envision this to remain the case indefinitely. (See also: Can Amazon Fight Off Microsoft Cloud Momentum? ) \nMicrosoft has already become China's second biggest cloud services provider, thanks to its Office 365 and Azure platforms, according to Forrester Research, reports the South China Morning Post. \nCrozier told the Post that Microsoft saw increased traction for Azure on the mainland, where Microsoft estimated it has so far recorded \"triple-digit year-on-year revenue growth.\" He also proclaimed, \"We're in a very good position now.\" \nMicrosoft's strength in China comes on the heels of Alibaba, which owns the South China Morning Post, announcing plans to expand its data centers outside of China, aiming to strengthen its position globally.

      "text": "  09:33 AM EST Tech Today: Large-Cap Tech Rising, Black Friday Deal Making, Microsoft in Mobile Here are some things going on today in your world of tech : Welcome back from your holiday feast, for those in the United States. Shares of large-cap tech are mostly trading higher, with Amazon ( AMZN ) up $5.62, or 0.7%, at $785.74, in early trading; Alphabet ( GOOGL ) up $2.50, or 0.3%, at $781.50; Intel ( INTC ) up 9 cents at $35.29; and Facebook ( FB ) up 25 cents at $121.09. Notable laggards in early trading are down 6 cents at $111.17; and IBM ( IBM ) is down 19 cents at $161.79. Black Friday selling mania is in full effect, and MarketWatch ’s Barbara Kollmeyer reports that an early start to deals drove a 13.6% increase, year over year, in online electronics sales, as “U.S. shoppers hit their mobile devices and laptops to shop on Thanksgiving Day, racking up sales of over $1.15 billion.\" Speaking of deals, Apple has unveiled its Black Friday discounts, which aren’t really discounts but rather offers of gift cards to buy more stuff from Apple when you buy select products. Reflecting on this, Brian White with Drexel Hamilton reiterates a Buy rating on the stock, and a $185 price target, writing that the company “remains one of the best positioned tech companies to benefit from spending trends this holiday season with a well-received iPhone 7/7 Plus, a new Apple Watch and a new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar.\"",

      "text": "up vote 0 down vote \nYou might try giving the Microsoft Exchange Server Profile Analyzer a try - download link . I believe it can get the info you are looking for although I have never used it, and I am running Exchange 2010, which the tool apparently doesn't support. \nEdit: (A different approach): If you are running AV on your Exchange server, you might be able to create a rule that snags attachment types for reporting purposes only. Create a rule to filter for attachments, but don't take any action on the message. Then you might be able to run a report on the rule to get the info you are looking for... \nSecond edit: Take a look at Transport Rules . I believe you can add a rule to grab attachments matching a file name pattern and log occurrences to the Application log. You can then sort through the Event Log with a powershell script to get your statistics.",

One of them is what’s being called Project NEON, a new design language that Microsoft has been working on behind the closed doors for nearly one year and which the company hopes would bring more consistency in its operating system. Citing unnamed sources, WindowsCentral writes that the purpose of this new design language is to bring together all Windows 10 devices, including not only PCs, tablets, and smartphones, but also the HoloLens. Project NEON would be specifically focused on HoloLens and on 3D features, as Microsoft is now investigating aggressively in 3D and the upcoming Creators Update is the first step towards this new approach.",

      "text": "By Rishabh Jain On 11/26/16 AT 4:03 AM The official Microsoft app for the vintage Solitaire game has been launched for Android/iOS devices. Photo: Xbox \nMicrosoft has released the official iOS and Android app versions of its Solitaire game. Called the “Microsoft Solitaire Collection,” the app offers five virtual card games. \n1. Klondike — Players need to clear cards from the table by building a numerical series of cards belonging to each suit. They have to combine existing cards on the table with cards from a three-card draw. Once the suit is complete, it will be eliminated from the deck. \n2. Spider — It consists of eight columns of cards which need to be cleared off the table with the fewest moves possible. Players can choose between a single suit or four suits. \n3. Freecell — Players need to strategically use four empty cells to move the cards around and clear all cards from the table. \n4. Tripeaks — Players are offered a limited number of deals in which they have to select cards in a sequence, earn combo points and clear as many boards as they can. \n5. Pyramid — Players need to combine cards that add up to 13 in order to remove them from a pyramid arrangement on the board to reach the top and clear as many boards as they can in the process.

Players will need to sign in with their Xbox Live gamertag or Microsoft account and earn Xbox Live achievements and gamerscores. They would also be able to switch between devices and continue where they left off in the previous device, since progress and game data will be saved in the cloud. \nThe apps also include daily challenges with multiple levels and rewards for all five games, and can be downloaded from the Google Play store and App Store . \nPlayers will get a free month subscription of “Microsoft Solitaire Collection” premium edition, worth $1.99, between Nov. 23 and Dec.31. The premium version comes without ads and offers game boosts and double coins for all daily challenges. \nThe game collection has been available for Windows 8 and Windows 10 PCs and mobile devices since the launch of the operating systems. Microsoft claims the game has reached 119 million unique players in the last 4 years.

      "title": "Surface Pro 5 release rumors: Latest Microsoft laptop-tablet hybrid to be unveiled in February 2017?",
      "text": "  \n(Microsoft) Shown in the photo is the Surface Pro 4. Rumor has it that Microsoft will unveil the Surface Pro 5 at the Mobile World Congress 2017, which is happening from February 27 to March 2, 2017. \nAfter it was expected that Microsoft would unveil the Surface Pro 5 at its event last month, the latest in the rumor mill is that the laptop-tablet hybrid will finally be unveiled in February 2017, along with another alleged Microsoft device, the Surface Phone. \nPrior to the Microsoft event that took place last month, it was heavily believed that the company would unveil the latest Surface Pro device in the then upcoming event. However, the event commenced and concluded without even a mere mention of the said device. \nThis doesn't mean, though, that Surface Pro fans cannot expect the latest version of the device from Microsoft. If the latest rumors are to be believed, fans may not have to wait that long before the Surface Pro 5 arrives as, allegedly, the device will be launched in March next year. \nAs it is said that the Surface Pro 5 will arrive along with the rumored Surface Phone, there is a possibility, indeed, for the laptop-tablet hybrid to be unveiled in February next year. After all, rumors claiming that the Surface Phone will be released at next year's Mobile World Congress (MWC) in Barcelona Spain are also getting louder. As the MWC 2017 is set to happen from Feb. 27 to March 2, 2017, rumors claiming that the Surface Pro 5 will arrive in February 2017 seem to be in sync with the date. Advertisement \nAlthough there were those who suspected that the Surface Pro 5 would be launched at the Microsoft event last month, there were also those who doubted if it was really going to be the case. After all, it has been strongly rumored that the device will pack the latest Intel processor, the Kaby Lake. \nAccording to some reports , though, Intel Kaby Lake processor will arrive in January next year. Should this really be the case, then, it is likely for the Surface Pro 5 to arrive mid-2017 or stick to the current Intel Skylake processor if Microsoft really has to release it within the first quarter of 2017. \nWhile the news on the Surface Pro 5 possibly getting released in March next year is great news, nothing is confirmed as of this writing. Hence, everything has to be taken with a grain of salt for now. In the event that the device is really unveiled at the MWC 2017, well and good for those who are excitedly awaiting the arrival of the device.  ",

      "text": "Microsoft Is Working On a New Design Language For Windows 10 Codenamed Project NEON Published by Slashdot on Sat, 26 Nov 2016 An anonymous reader quotes a report from Windows Central: Microsoft has made several adjustments to its design language over the last few years, starting with Windows 8 and evolving into what we now know as \"Microsoft Design Language 2\" or MDL2 in Windows 10. With MDL2 being the current design language used throughout Windows 10, Microsoft has plans to begin using a much more streamlined design language with Redstone 3, codenamed Project NEON. Cassim Ketfi at Numerama.com confirms our information and has heard Project NEON called \"basically Metro 2.\" That designation refers to the first Metro design language (nee Modern) that harkens to Windows Media Center up through Windows Phone 7 and Windows 8. Per our sources, Project NEON has been in the works for over a year internally at Microsoft. It builds upon the design language introduced with Windows 10, with its simple and clean interfaces, but adds some much-needed flair to the UI that the current design language just lacks. Details are still scarce, but we hear some of the new designs in the plans include adding more animations and transitions, with the overall goal of making the UI very fluid and \"beautiful\" compared to the current, almost static UI that is MDL2. One source familiar with Microsoft's plans described NEON as \"Very fluid, lots of motion and nice transitions.\" Some more information about NEON reveals that it serves as a bridge between holographic and augmented reality (AR) and the desktop environment. It's a \"UI that transports across devices\" with a UX that maps to the physical world. It uses textures, 3D models, lighting and more. Read more of this story at Slashdot.",

      "text": "Microsoft has already introduced its Surface Book i7 and Surface Studio, but fans are still left wondering if the Redmond giant has plans of releasing a new smartphone. The Surface line of products is proving to be quite popular in the market, so it is not surprising that many are longing for the debut of a Surface smartphone. GSM Arena reports that even though certain Surface Phones have made appearances in renders and benchmark leaks in the past, there is still no sign of their launch, let alone their existence. However, consumers who are looking forward for the launch of these phones may have gained new hope after Microsoft CEO Natya Nadella recently spoke about the company’s plans for its mobile business.\nEarly this week, Nadella did an interview with the Australian Financial Review . Per the CEO, Microsoft’s team is currently carrying out a research on innovative technology, so that the company could ensure that its next entry into the smartphone market would be felt by its competitors and the consumers in general.\n“We don’t want to be driven by just envy of what others have, the question is what can we bring? That’s where I look at any device form factor or any technology, even AI,” Nadella was quoted as saying. “We will continue to be in the phone market not as defined by today’s market leaders, but by what it is that we can uniquely do in what is the most ultimate mobile device.”\nAccording to MacRumors , Nadella’s statement simply means that Microsoft wants to redefine the field by making the “ultimate mobile device” — what is currently being rumored as the Surface Phone. In ensuring that this device would shine on its own in the sea of competition, the Redmond giant is interested in knowing how individuals and organizations use their phones, instead of studying the market trend at present.\nRecent reports have been claiming that Microsoft is working on a Surface Phone with “laptop-class” Intel processors. There are also speculations that Microsoft could be secretly working on a device based on the HP Elite x3’s build, which is a part smartphone, part mini PC device. At this point, it is still to early to tell, but GSM Arena is taking Nadella's statement as a clear sign that Microsoft Surface Phone is already being developed. \nRelated Articles \nMicrosoft Proposes Concessions to EU to Lock In LinkedIn Acquisition Deal Microsoft Ready For Quantum Leap Minimum PC Requirements For Windows Holographic Revealed",

      "text": "Michael Seto/Business Insider \nMotorola used to be one of those giant corporate conglomerates that employed 150,000 people, many at a massive campus in Schaumburg, Illinois. But it hit hard times, and over the last several years it sold off chunks of itself and became Motorola Solutions.\nMotorola Solutions is still a huge company. It employs around 14,000 and generated $5.8 billion in revenue over the last four quarters. But it has sold the huge campus and moved to new headquarters in Chicago.\nAs part of its move and cost cutting, Motorola is unplugging its data centers and going all-in in the cloud.\nIts cloud of choice is Amazon Web Services, Leo Wang, head of cloud computing, told Business Insider.\n\"When we first we started, we were moving just one data center, our Schaumburg data center,\" he said. \"Within 6 to 7 months, we moved more than 200,000 servers, and 150 applications, and we had more than $2 million in computer yearly spend moved over to AWS.\"\nAnd they liked AWS so much, they decided to move everything else into it, worldwide, over the course of the next two years, Wang said. \n\"We save millions per year. We invested millions initially but the long range savings will be significant, and we have a more aggressive plan next year and the year after.\"\nChoosing Amazon wasn't automatic. In fact, Motorola already had a smaller contract with Microsoft to use its competing cloud, Azure. But Microsoft wasn't able to turn that into a bigger sale.\nWhy Microsoft didn't win Michael Seto/Business Insider Motorola Solutions sells radios and communications equipment to government agencies like police, fire, other emergency services.\nThey chose Azure because Azure had a crucial government security certification known as Criminal Justice Information Services (CJIS) and Amazon didn't.\nSo when Motorola opted to move everything to the cloud, the IT folks looked at Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.\n\"Amazon had better technologies in almost all areas. It is much more mature in terms of functionality. They excelled in every aspect that we needed from the cloud perspective and from the customer service perspective, but they didn’t have the CIJS compliance,\" Wang said.\nBut CIJS certification was a deal breaker, they told Amazon.\n\"Initially, they were hesitating. They were not interested in having this certification because they were so big in the market,\" Wang says.\nBut they agreed to look into it and decided to get CIJS, realizing it could open up new government markets for its cloud. Amazon is already making a name for itself pursuing government cloud business with its \"GovCloud,\" a highly secured section of the AWS's services reserved for government use.\n\"Once they realized the importance of this certification in this industry, they invested. In a few months they were certified, and they created a Gov Cloud for us,\" Wang said.\nMichael Seto/Business Insider By doing this, Motorola was able to launch a brand new app for its law enforcement customers on AWS that lets them store camera footage on AWS. This app has the potential to be huge for Motorola and AWS, Wang believes.\nAmazon isn't known for its customer service, but Wang can't sing AWS's support praises any louder.\n\"Andy Jassy personally came to our office and had a detailed look at what we had. They put a lot of attention to us,\" Wang said.\nIn comparing AWS's support to that from Microsoft, he called it \"very different,\" saying, \"With AWS we are very tightly engaged with them in almost all efforts. We have meetings, we share our concerns, we have follow up, and a consultant works closely with us, and works closely with the product team.\"\nAmazon's big gotcha There is one big downside to choosing Amazon: it's harder to keep track of costs.\nLike all cloud providers Amazon charges for the actual time each machine (known as an instance) is used. That's a benefit over buying servers, which a company pays for if they use them or not.\nMichael Seto/Business Insider But if a company is not carefully watching its Amazon usage, it could run up a huge bill.\n\"In the cloud, it’s so easy to create resources, but the right governance over the usage is needed for you to get the price benefits. You need to be able to start and stop that instance only when the app is running.\" Wang said. \"If you simply spin up the servers without proper governance, you could end up paying more.\"\nAWS doesn't make this task easy.\n\"AWS, their pricing model is very complicated, that is a drawback,\" Wang says. He has complained to AWS about it and believes \"they are improving in that area.\"\nThere are hoards of apps that will monitor Amazon usage. Motorola doesn't use them. Instead, it hired a cloud consultant, 2nd Watch,  to help it move to AWS, size everything properly, train the IT staff and set up its own internal systems for watching usage, Wang says.\nDownsizing Oracle Michael Seto/Business Insider One bonus for moving to the cloud is that Motorola has a chance to look at its big expensive apps, like Oracle's database, and ditch them.\n\"In some of the instances, if we can use AWS [databases] instead of Oracle, we are doing that,\" he said, though he's not ready to dump Oracle completely. \"Oracle is still our big partner.\"\nThis is a huge concern for Oracle these days, as Amazon rolls out more database alternatives and has created a tool that helps a company move its database from Oracle to Amazon's homegrown one.  \nAvoiding hard feelings Michael Seto/Business Insider One last thing Motorola needed to work on was getting the IT staff on board. No one lost their jobs because of this move, Wang says. That's because Motorola had an outsourcer called CSC managing its infrastructure. With AWS, it won't need CSC.\nBut there's still some jealousy among the staff.\n\"My team is very excited because they are the core cloud computing team, doing the work. Some other IT teams are feeling left out. I can sense that kind of feeling,\" he said.\nSo, Wang says, he's working on eventually getting the other IT folks trained on the cloud. And people are excited to learn all the latest, greatest cloud tech. It's good for their careers. \"I will help them and they will help me, too.\"\nNOW WATCH: How the ‘perfect body’ for men has changed over the last 150 years \n",

      "text": "Microsoft Rolling Out Exciting App Updates for Android Users GO New updates for Office and Cortana on Android devices Nov 26, 2016 09:59   Microsoft keeps improving its Android apps and today it’s the turn of Cortana and Office to get some pretty exciting updates, including new features and bug fixes. First and foremost, let’s see what’s new in the personal assistant. The Android version of Cortana has been updated to 1.9.12 and it comes with a birthday reminder, which let’s be honest, comes in extremely handy. This feature works similar to Facebook and notifies whenever you have to wish someone “Happy Birthday,” and it’s all automated. Cortana automatically retrieves birthday information from your Outlook Calendar and displays notifications early in the morning, so it’s nearly impossible to miss a reminder. Additionally, this version also comes with support for multiple calendars, but also with improved meeting retrieval experience and location system. Microsoft says it also fixed several crash bugs, so Cortana should work a bit smoother after the update. The Office update If you’re an Office for Android user, this update brings plenty of goodies on your device. The update was previously tested by Microsoft as part of the Office Insider program and brings version to 16.0.7531.1002. According to the official Microsoft changelog, it includes accessibility settings built right into Office apps, including support for TalkBack, your keyboard, and other assistive technologies, as well as support for Box and Egnyte. And last but not least, you also get sharing notifications for Word, PowerPoint, and Excel, so you’ll receive a notification whenever someone shares a document with you. All these updates are part of Microsoft’s increased focus on Android, as the company says that improving non-Windows apps is a critical part of its strategy because it wants everyone to access its services, no matter the device. And truth be told, Android and iOS apps are actually receiving updates even more frequently than their Windows siblings, so if you’re using a non-Windows mobile device, you’re pretty lucky.",

      "text": "Microsoft Teases Improvements Coming in Next Windows 10 Preview Builds GO The Share feature will be substantially improved, it says Nov 26, 2016 08:52   No Windows 10 build was released this week, as the Windows team took some days off to spend Thanksgiving with their families, but work on the Creators Update will restart next week, and the company is obviously expected to provide new updates to insiders. One of the coming builds will include sharing improvements, according to Peter Skillman, who is the General Manager of Core UX for Windows, as Microsoft focused specifically on improving this side of the operating system (which has more or less been neglected, by the way). Details on how exactly sharing would be improved in future builds are not yet available, but Microsoft hasn’t spent too much time focusing on this feature, and everything seems to be kind of broken at the moment. In Windows 8, sharing was part of the Charms bar, and users could access it easily, but with Windows 10 and the introduction of universal apps, this feature has been left behind. Of course, the upcoming insider builds would be mostly supposed to help Microsoft test new sharing functionality before a public release in the Creators Update, which is due in early 2017. The Fast Ring getting it first It goes without saying that the next builds will be released exclusively to the Fast Ring, as Microsoft has only recently updated the Slow Ring with a new build, so it’ll take a while until a new one is shipped for users enrolled in this channel. Windows 10 Creators Update is expected to launch in March 2017, as people with knowledge of the matter indicated that it could be version 1703, which as per Microsoft’s version naming strategy, represents the year and the month – the third month of the year 2017. This information is not yet confirmed, but Microsoft itself said that the Creators Update would go live in early 2017, so expect more substantial improvements to be included in the upcoming insider builds.",

      "text": "Pluralsight Author, Software Architect, Independent Consultant, Microsoft MVP, Speaker, Clean Coder, Aspiring Outlier. 2 days ago A week with the new Macbook Pro with Touch Pad A developer’s take on the new 2016 Macbook Pro vs the 2015 Macbook Pro I purchased the new Macbook Pro (MBP for short, below) with Touch Pad one week ago. I chose the maxed out “standard” model for $2,799 at the local Apple store: 15\" i7/2.7/16gb/512gb. I also own an early 2015 13\" Macbook Pro with i5/2.9/16gb/512gb, so I’ll compare the two below. The Good: Superb screen . It’s notably brighter, which is wonderful for outdoor work. The reduced bezel size is also a nice touch. While other specs may trump it, the rich colors and brightness combined with it’s low glare make it one of the best displays out there for real world use. It’s seriously fast. As expected, the i7 combined with the much faster SSD makes this machine very responsive. I was happy with my 13\" i5, but the new MBP is notably faster. Nearly every interaction is smooth and immediate. This is a really luxurious way to interact with a device. One extreme example: An npm install that took 2 minutes on the 13\" i5 required only 1:05 on the new 15\" i7. TouchID is mostly great. It’s fast and luxurious. I open the lid, tap it, and start immediately. Just like an iPhone…except when it doesn’t work. See below. The size and weight is wow. The 15\" feels the same weight as my 2015 13\". And due to packaging improvements, its footprint is quite reasonable. I’ve had no issues using the 15\" in coach on flights this week. I use this on my lap and it feels as natural as my 13\". I‘m a fan of 13\" laptops, but this 15\" is compact and light enough to change my mind. And in benchmarks, it’s returning better battery life than comparable new 13\" models due to the much larger battery. Early 2015 13\" on top of new 15\" Cool and silent under light loads. Despite running an i7, it’s typical running temp is comparable to my i5 13\". Like my 13\", the fan virtually never runs during normal work. The temperature varies between cool and barely warm under my normal browsing and coding work. See below for the story on heavy loads. Impressive speakers. I didn’t care about laptop speakers until now. These are actually good enough to use! Who knew that was possible? I’m reaching for my headphones less because the sound is sufficient for casual listening. Given, my beloved QC35 headphones sound much better, but shows and casual background music on the new MBP are quite enjoyable. The improvement over my 2015 13\" is almost like moving to a bluetooth speaker. Bravo Apple! The Bad: The touchpad is too big. This sounds odd, but it’s unnecessarily large. The size leads occasional palm rejection issues, which means the mouse occasionally jumps around and even accidental clicks from my palm occasionally occur. I never once had this issue on my 2015 model. Nor did I ever wish for a larger touchpad — I’m only using a small portion of this thing. Hopefully software updates can iron out these rare, but annoying issues. The trackpad on the old 13\" was big enough. Battery life is okay, but short of expectations. The machine reports 9 hours of battery remaining immediately after I’ve started up, yet consistently falls short of that number. I get 4–8 hours per charge. My typical use this week has been web browsing, coding in VSCode , occasional music streaming, bluetooth headphones and trackpad, and medium brightness. That is respectable for a 15\" laptop with these specs, but notably short of Apple’s “Up to 10 hours” claim. Hot under heavy loads. When I first purchased, I was multi-tasking by installing multiple apps, downloading many GB of data on Dropbox, and so on. This taxed the system hard and it was very hot, with fans running (albeit quietly). During this period I had multiple wifi connectivity issues, (though these admittedly could have been from my router since I’ve had no issues while traveling). I was concerned about the temperature, but after the initial set up, it has been a cool operator. Bugs . On day one, the wifi disconnected five times in four hours. Thankfully, since then, Wifi has been rock solid while traveling, despite that concerning first day. Bluetooth failed to pair many devices at first. After pairing, Bluetooth continues to drop devices occasionally. Touch ID often isn’t provided as an option when I open the lid. When I am prompted, it occasionally doesn’t respond at all. When connected to an external monitor, I am typically forced to open the lid and login via touch ID — the password field literally isn’t provided as an option. Edit: Turns out the password field isn’t displayed, but if I start typing it shows up. Touch ID is an inconsistent mess. Spotlight has frozen more than once, requiring a reboot. Activity monitor regularly crashes and restarts. And the aforementioned palm rejection issues mean the cursor occasionally jumps to another part of the screen. Needless to say, for a nearly $3,000 machine, this list is hard to accept. So much so that I’m seriously considering returning the machine. The bright side is everything above can potentially be resolved by future software updates. The Maybe: The touch bar shows promise. I did not buy this device for the touch bar. I was completely indifferent to the feature. But fear not developers, you can set the traditional F keys to always show for any app . The provided functions work well. Changing brightness and volume via the bar is slick. It’s a single touch motion that feels natural. Thoughtful shortcuts when doing screenshots are appreciated. Man page shortcuts display when in the terminal. And try working with photos in the Photos app. That’s when the power really clicked for me. Nice touch: Playback controls with scrubbing when you load youtube.com I appreciate the ability to customize a row of keys to my tastes. For now, I believe most pro users who know keyboard shortcuts are unlikely to reach for the touch bar much , but the story here is only going to get better as software developers find new ways to harness its power for macros and complex interactions. I find the keys as easy to use as physical buttons. I could never hit the F keys without looking anyway, and the escape key remains easy to hit without looking. You can even tap the blank touch bar area to the left of the escape key and it will register . Despite all the drama, I’m happily working in vim . No complaints. As an owner of a touch screen windows PC, I understand why Apple isn’t embracing touch screen PCs. I virtually never reach for the screen on my Yoga laptop. The click targets are too small and it’s faster to use the keyboard. Apple is right — you can’t simply add touch to a UI designed for a mouse. In contrast, the touchbar is a customizable keyboard. Despite its currently limited use cases, touch bar is likely to be a big win in the future. The keyboard is good, if not great. I may grow to enjoy it. It’s certainly better than the Macbook’s with a bit more travel and a more sturdy feel. But I currently prefer the 2015 keyboard. The new keyboard feels too shallow for my taste, and I prefer the “softer” feel of the 2015 keyboard when bottoming out the keys. I’m learning to simply type lighter on this new keyboard, but I currently prefer keyboards that I can mash without feeling punished. Make sure to try this out at length in the store. Dongle life. I purchased Apple’s multimedia adapter and it works flawlessly. I’m running a 4K display over HDMI and it looks wonderful. However, I’ve already reached for multiple USB devices only to realize I need to plug in an adapter. This is an ongoing annoyance, so I’ve purchased a set of USB-C to USB-A adapters on eBay for $5 . There are some compelling USB-C docks available as well. Finally, there is an advantage to going USB-C: I enjoy being able to plug in power from either side. It effectively makes the cord longer and avoids awkward and ugly cord routing issues. I miss magsafe, but there are already aftermarket solutions available. Bottom line The next year or two will be a more compelling time to upgrade. I expect to see 32GB of RAM, more efficient modern processors, improved battery life, broad industry-wide USB-C support and docks, an OLED screen, and richer support for touch bar in MacOS apps. Until then, if you have a recent MBP, I’d hold on to it for another year. Cory House is the author of many courses on Pluralsight , and principal consultant at reactjsconsulting.com .
