Duffin ruled in August that investigators tricked Dassey into confessing he helped his uncle, Steven Avery, rape, kill and mutilate photographer Teresa Halbach in 2005. The state has appealed that ruling.\nDassey’s supervised release was not immediate and is contingent upon him meeting multiple conditions. He has until noon Tuesday to provide the federal probation and parole office with the address of where he planned to live.\nDassey was 16 when Halbach died. He’s now 27.\n",

The judge said he could be released within 90 days, unless the State wanted to retry him. They did not, so here we are.\nWhat do you think? Good or bad news?\nFollow Cody on Twitter. \nFollow Cody on Instagram. \nFollow Cody on Facebook. ",

      "text": "tweet AP \nIn this Aug. 2, 2007 file photo, Brendan Dassey is escorted into court for his sentencing in Manitowoc, Wis. (Herald Times Reporter/Eric Young via AP, Pool) AP   02:17PM A man whose homicide conviction was overturned in a case profiled in the Netflix series \"Making a Murderer\" was ordered released Monday from federal prison while prosecutors appeal.U.S. Magistrate Judge William Duffin ordered Dassey's release contingent upon him meeting multiple conditions. The judge ruled in August that investigators tricked Dassey into confessing he helped his uncle, Steven Avery, rape, kill and mutilate photographer Teresa Halbach in 2005. The state has appealed that ruling.Dassey's attorney, Steve Drizin, said he had not spoken yet with Dassey, but he hoped to have him out of prison in time to spend Thanksgiving with his family.\"That's what I'm focused on right now, getting him home, getting him with his family and then helping him to re-integrate back into society while his appeal plays out,\" Drizin said.A spokesman for Wisconsin Attorney General Brad Schimel, who had asked that Dassey not be released from prison pending the appeal, had no immediate response.Dassey's supervised release was not immediate. He had until noon Tuesday to provide the federal probation and parole office with the address of where he planned to live.Drizin would not say where Dassey plans to live.Dassey was 16 when Halbach died. He's now 27.Duffin ruled in August that investigators made specific promises of leniency to Dassey and that no \"fair-minded jurists could disagree.\" He cited one investigator's comment early in the interview that \"you don't have to worry about things,\" plus repeated comments like \"it's OK\" and that they already knew what happened.Schimel, in his appeal, said investigators didn't promise leniency and they specifically told Dassey that no promises could be made.Halbach was killed on Halloween 2005, after she visited the Avery family's salvage yard in Manitowoc County. Investigators allege Avery lured her there by asking her to take photos of a minivan. Dassey was sentenced to life in prison in 2007. Court documents describe him as a slow learner who had poor grades and has difficulty understanding language and speaking. Avery was convicted in a separate trial and was also sentenced to life in prison. He's pursuing his own appeal.Their cases gained national attention after Netflix aired \"Making a Murderer\" last year. The series spawned widespread conjecture about the pair's innocence. Authorities who worked on the cases said the series was biased, but it generated calls from the public to free both men. Related Topics:",

      "title": "UN-Making A Murderer! Subject Of Netflix Documentary Freed From Prison",
      "text": "Brendan Dassey , focus of the Netflix documentary Making a Murderer , has been sprung from prison pending his appeal.\nA judge in Milwaukee ordered Dassey, who was convicted in 2007 and sent to prison for allegedly helping his uncle, Steven Avery , murder photographer Teresa Halbach , be freed pending the outcome of his appeal in the case.\nA judge had previously overturned 26-year-old Dassey’s conviction in August, basing the decision on how officials obtained his confession, which his lawyers now say was false and a result of his low IQ.\nPHOTOS: The 10 Most Sensational Celebrity Murder Cases \n“The court’s decision rests on a fundamental principle that is too often forgotten by courts and law enforcement officers: Interrogation tactics which may not be coercive when used on adults are coercive when used on juveniles, particularly young people like Brendan with disabilities, ” explained Dassey’s lawyers at the time, Steven A. Drizin and Laura Nirider .\nThe judge warned prosecutors that they would have a total of 90 days — which has now passed — to retry Dassey on the charges or he would be freed from custody.\nAs part of his temporary release, court documents show that Dassey is forbidden from having any contact with his co-defendant, Avery, or with Halbach’s family.\nStory developing.\nWe pay for juicy info!

      "text": "A man whose homicide conviction was overturned in a case profiled in the Netflix series \"Making a Murderer\" was ordered released Monday from federal prison while prosecutors appeal.\nU.S. Magistrate Judge William Duffin ordered Dassey's release contingent upon him meeting multiple conditions. The judge ruled in August that investigators tricked Dassey into confessing he helped his uncle, Steven Avery, rape, kill and mutilate photographer Teresa Halbach in 2005. The state has appealed that ruling.\nDassey's attorney, Steve Drizin, said he had not spoken yet with Dassey, but he hoped to have him out of prison in time to spend Thanksgiving with his family.\n\"That's what I'm focused on right now, getting him home, getting him with his family and then helping him to re-integrate back into society while his appeal plays out,\" Drizin said.\nA spokesman for Wisconsin Attorney General Brad Schimel, who had asked that Dassey not be released from prison pending the appeal, had no immediate response.\nDassey's supervised release was not immediate. He had until noon Tuesday to provide the federal probation and parole office with the address of where he planned to live.\nWisconsin AG appeals overturned conviction of 'Making a Murderer' nephew Tribune news services Wisconsin's attorney general on Friday appealed the overturned conviction of a man accused of helping his uncle kill a woman in a case profiled in the popular Netflix series \"Making a Murderer.\"\nA federal magistrate judge ruled in August that investigators tricked Brendan Dassey into confessing...\nWisconsin's attorney general on Friday appealed the overturned conviction of a man accused of helping his uncle kill a woman in a case profiled in the popular Netflix series \"Making a Murderer.\"\nA federal magistrate judge ruled in August that investigators tricked Brendan Dassey into confessing...\n(Tribune news services) Drizin would not say where Dassey plans to live.\nDassey was 16 when Halbach died. He's now 27.\nDuffin ruled in August that investigators made specific promises of leniency to Dassey and that no \"fair-minded jurists could disagree.\" He cited one investigator's comment early in the interview that \"you don't have to worry about things,\" plus repeated comments like \"it's OK\" and that they already knew what happened.\nSchimel, in his appeal, said investigators didn't promise leniency and they specifically told Dassey that no promises could be made.\nHalbach was killed on Halloween 2005, after she visited the Avery family's salvage yard in Manitowoc County. Investigators allege Avery lured her there by asking her to take photos of a minivan. Dassey was sentenced to life in prison in 2007. Court documents describe him as a slow learner who had poor grades and has difficulty understanding language and speaking. Avery was convicted in a separate trial and was also sentenced to life in prison. He's pursuing his own appeal.\nTheir cases gained national attention after Netflix aired \"Making a Murderer\" last year. The series spawned widespread conjecture about the pair's innocence. Authorities who worked on the cases said the series was biased, but it generated calls from the public to free both men.\nAssociated Press \nCopyright © 2016, Hartford Courant",

      "text": "\nSo if you have seen the most recent season of Black Mirror on Netflix than you know, it is some other level stuff. Though this (formerly British and now Netflix produced) show has always been well ahead of the curve on the way it views technology and how much this tech is separating us from our actual humanity, the season has been just as good as the last two, which many fans were scared about. The idea of the Black Mirror is your own reflection in a computer monitor or phone screen. A “black” mirror that shows us the ugliest aspects of ourselves. And though I did a thorough review of the first episode of this spectacular new season, I also wanted to touch on the second episode, Playtest. As I am sure you can tell from the name of the episode, it was aimed directly at our demographic, which is why I am talking about it. By the way, if you have not seen the show, do not read this yet. It will be very light on spoilers but regardless, it is a much more engrossing experience if you go at it blind.\nFor those who have seen it or want to know a wee bit more, read on.\nPlaytest \nWhere is gaming going next? I have asked many people this exact question over the last three months and no one has been able to give me an answer. seriously, where is gaming going next!!? I personally think it hit its peak in the seventh generation (360, Ps3). From the way the games looked to the stories, it was the apex of good gaming. I will still stand Bioshock Infinite up against ANY 8th generation game and will win that argument. Same can be said for the amazing Last of Us. NOTHING in current systems touches either of those two games. That is why all they are making now for 8th gen consoles are all reboots and HD remakes OF THOSE VERY GAMES we loved from the last gen. So really, where is gaming going? Don’t even try to tell me VR because no one seems to be aware of how violently ill you get playing those games long term. It so SO BAD, in fact, the sickness has already been given an actual name:\nVR sickness. \nOn top of that, the VR games that have dropped thus far have been underwhelming at best. So it makes sense that augmented reality will be something more and more developers and tech geniuses are going to try to play with. This third episode of season three of Black Mirror aptly named Playtest is about just that. A man signs up for a playtest at a very progressive game developer for a new horror game they are working on. The main difference here being that they use a sort of Matrix beck-of-the-neck implant to link you up with a system so you can actually experience the game (as in, no graphics but rather, a physical world you are inside of). Now judging solely on the popularity of games like Amnesia and Outlast, I think you can immediately understand why being placed into an actual horror game and not knowing the difference between the game and reality would be a wholly unnerving experience. but it is the way that Black Mirror pulls it off that is genius. I won’t give away any more info than that about Playtest, but I will tell you, if you are a gamer, a geek, fan of scifi, or a fan of horror (or really, all of the above) you NEED to watch episode 2 of Black Mirror season three.\nBecause if they are right and this is the direction gaming will inevitably go (which Sony hinted at in the commercial below) than I am smashing my consoles right now.\n\nThe post Black Mirror Season 3 Episode 2: Playtest (Spoiler Free) Review appeared first on Geeks are Sexy Technology News .\n",

      "text": "Pop-up Share this article \nIn celebration of the Netflix revival of Gilmore Girls , coffee shops across the country transformed for one day into Luke's Diner, the iconic eatery featured on the show. I asked Her Campus writer Alexa Iniquez all about her experience visiting Luke’s Diner when it popped up in Orlando at The Coffee Garden! \nN: You must really love Gilmore Girls if you decided to visit Luke’s Diner! What’s your favorite thing about the show? \nA: There's so many things I truly adore about the show, but the one that really takes the cake is the fact that the characters seem so real! They're witty, and Lorelai and Rory remind me of my mom and I. \nN: So what was it like taking a step into the show and “visiting” one of its most iconic locations? \nA: Being able to \"visit\" Luke's Diner when it popped up at Coffee Garden in Orlando was definitely something I will never forget. Although it wasn't exactly like the show's diner, it was more than enough! They had Luke's sign and they had Gilmore Girls playing in the background, it was really nice. It was also fabulous to see all the fans! It's nice knowing you're not insane for being so obsessed with a show because other people are too. \nN: What was your favorite part about The Coffee Garden's version of Luke’s Diner? A: My favorite part was seeing the sign and getting a coffee cup and sleeve -and the free coffee was great too! The baristas were dressed just like Luke and I thought the experience was really thought-out and well done. \nN: Did you take any photos you’d like to share? \nN: What are you hoping to see in the Netflix revival? \nA: For the next season, I don't want to be too hopeful because I don't know what to expect, and after all it's only 4 episodes. But, I really hope that Rory is still herself and that Luke and Lorelai are still together! I can't wait to see how everyone comes back together and I'm excited to really be able to see Stars Hollow again! Hearing the theme song will most likely make me happy sob! \n\nImages: 1 , all other images in the article were taken by Alexa Iniguez. You Might Also Enjoy",

      "text": "Netflix Users Now Spend 600+ Hours a Year Streaming Shows (NFLX) By Rakesh Sharma | November 14, 2016 — 2:00 PM EST \nNetflix Inc. ( NFLX ) subscribers are watching 12 days worth more of the streaming service today as compared to five years ago. According to cordcutting.com, Netflix subscribers streamed 300 hours more of the streaming service in 2016 than they did back in 2011. The site arrived at this data point by dividing the number of content hours with the total site subscribers. In 2011, the site streaming 7.3 billion hours of content and 23.53 million subscribers. By 2015, the number of subscribers had grown to 74.76 million subscribers and the number of content hours had increased to 42.5 billion hours. \nCordcutting.com extrapolated these figures to arrive at a figure of 600 hours of content for 2016. “Netflix appears to have become more efficient in some important way, and it’s doing a great job of fending off new rivals, growing its subscriber base, and getting more about of each subscriber,” the site writes. \nTheir conclusion, however, is not entirely correct. Netflix has not grown more efficient. It has simply grown bigger. The Los Gatos-based company has expanded at a rapid clip and was present in 190 countries, as of the beginning of this year. The expansion has bumped up its subscriber numbers. To maintain pace with its geographic expansion, Netflix has invested in original content as well as licensed programming from a wide array of entities. (See also: How Netflix Pays For Movie And TV Licensing ). \nNumbers from Netflix’s annual report make this clear. It spent $1.8 billion, a 55.1% increase from the previous year, on content acquisition costs in 2011. The Wall Street Journal quoted an RBC Capital Markets analyst, who estimated last year that the company spent $3.3 billion for the same metric. The company’s annual report for last year also stated that its cost of revenues, which includes marketing and technology costs, was $4.5 billion, a jump of 45% from 2013 figures. At the same time, contribution margins from domestic streaming increased by 6% to 33% even as the same metric for international streaming declined to -17% from -12% in 2015. (See also: Assessing Netflix's Post-Earnings Valuation ). \nThat said, the company’s focus on original programming as well as licensing will eventually make it more efficient. It has forecast a domestic streaming segment contribution margin of 40% for 2020. Learn how to invest by subscribing to the Investing Basics newsletter Thanks for signing up to Investing Basics.",

      "title": "Making a Murderer’s Brendan Dassey’s Release Was Ordered Today",
      "text": "Winston Cook-Wilson   CREDIT: ABC News/YouTube \nThe focus of Netflix’s true-crime epic Making a Murderer was Steven Avery, the 54-year-old Wisconsin man convicted of the murder of Theresa Halbach in 2007. But his nephew Brendan Dassey’s simultaneous murder case was just as crucial to the show. Filmmakers Laura Ricciardi and Moira Demos included long sections of footage from the questionable, coercive interrogation which led to Dassey being convicted of assisting Avery in killing Halbach. The show’s case for Dassey’s innocence was convincing, and today, it seems that Dassey may finally walk free any day now. \nIn a Milwaukee court in August, Dassey’s original conviction was overturned. As reported by the New York Times, U.S. Magistrate William Duffin wrote in a statement that the Manitwoc Police Department’s investigators did not sufficiently inform Dassey of the consequences of his confession and testimony. \n“These repeated false promises, when considered in conjunction with all relevant factors, most especially Dassey’s age, intellectual deficits, and the absence of a supportive adult, rendered Dassey’s confession involuntary under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments,” Duffin wrote. The August ruling declared that if the state did not refile the case within 90 days after the hearing, then Dassey could walk free. \nAccording to Milwaukee’s WTMJ-TV , the judge approved Dassey’s release today. The station claimed in an update to their original story that State Attorney General Brad Schimel will likely attempt to file a stay on that release order, and appeal the decision after Dassey has been released. One of the stipulations of Dassey’s release is that he will not be able to leave the Eastern District of Wisconsin for a designated period of time. \nRead the new court order here . This summer, Netflix greenlit another season of Making a Murderer dealing with the post-conviction fallout of the Dassey and Avery cases. It seems safe to assume these developments in the Dassey case will be a big part of the next set of episodes. No premiere date or concrete details about the second season of the show has yet been confirmed by Netflix or the filmmakers.",

      "text": "By Johanna Bennett Omega Advisors has rid itself of Netflix ( NFLX ) and continued to cut its stake in Facebook ( FB ) and Chimera Investments ( CIM ), while adding a stake in Chesapeake Energy ( CHK ) to its portfolio.\nBloomberg News/Landov The hedge fund run by Leon Cooperman , which was charged by the SEC in September with insider trading , disclosed in its quarterly 13F filing released today that it sold the 372,500 shares of Netflix it owned as of June 30 , while also slashing its position in Chimera by 47% to 2.4 million shares as of Sept. 30, cutting Dish Network ( DISH ) to 810,157 shares from just over 1.09 million shares and reducing its Facebook position to 278,100 shares form 322,400 . It also continued to cut its exposure to Dow Chemical ( DOW ) and American International Group ( AIG ).\nBut the filing showed that bought 1.14 million shares of Cliffs Natural Resources ( CLF ) and 273,650 shares of Chesapeake Energy, both new positions. It also took a 2.7 million share stake in Pandora Media ( P ).\nToday marks the deadline for big money managers to reveal holdings as of June 30 in 13F reports filed with the SEC. Requirement for investors managing more than $100 million, the quarterly filings disclose indicate the number of shares held and the value of each stake at the end of the quarter.\nJournalists and investors like to scrutinize â and in some cases copy â the portfolio moves of Wall Street titans like Warren Buffett and hedge fund gurus like Bill Ackman and Carl Icahn. For that reasons, the quarterly 13F filings are closely watched.",

      "text": "<iframe width=\"476\" height=\"267\" src=\"http://abc13.com/video/embed/?pid=1606730\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \nNephew in \"Making a Murderer\" ordered released (KTRK) AP Monday, November 14, 2016 04:08PM A man whose homicide conviction was overturned in a case profiled in the Netflix series \"Making a Murderer\" was ordered released Monday from federal prison while prosecutors appeal.U.S. Magistrate Judge William Duffin ordered Dassey's release contingent upon him meeting multiple conditions. The judge ruled in August that investigators tricked Dassey into confessing he helped his uncle, Steven Avery, rape, kill and mutilate photographer Teresa Halbach in 2005. The state has appealed that ruling.Dassey's attorney, Steve Drizin, said he had not spoken yet with Dassey, but he hoped to have him out of prison in time to spend Thanksgiving with his family.\"That's what I'm focused on right now, getting him home, getting him with his family and then helping him to re-integrate back into society while his appeal plays out,\" Drizin said.A spokesman for Wisconsin Attorney General Brad Schimel, who had asked that Dassey not be released from prison pending the appeal, had no immediate response.Dassey's supervised release was not immediate. He had until noon Tuesday to provide the federal probation and parole office with the address of where he planned to live.Drizin would not say where Dassey plans to live.Dassey was 16 when Halbach died. He's now 27.Duffin ruled in August that investigators made specific promises of leniency to Dassey and that no \"fair-minded jurists could disagree.\" He cited one investigator's comment early in the interview that \"you don't have to worry about things,\" plus repeated comments like \"it's OK\" and that they already knew what happened.Schimel, in his appeal, said investigators didn't promise leniency and they specifically told Dassey that no promises could be made.Halbach was killed on Halloween 2005, after she visited the Avery family's salvage yard in Manitowoc County. Investigators allege Avery lured her there by asking her to take photos of a minivan. Dassey was sentenced to life in prison in 2007. Court documents describe him as a slow learner who had poor grades and has difficulty understanding language and speaking. Avery was convicted in a separate trial and was also sentenced to life in prison. He's pursuing his own appeal.Their cases gained national attention after Netflix aired \"Making a Murderer\" last year. The series spawned widespread conjecture about the pair's innocence. Authorities who worked on the cases said the series was biased, but it generated calls from the public to free both men. Related Topics:",

      "text": "VUDU version 5.0 now available, movie rental downloads for your Android By 0 \nAfter Netflix, Hulu and Amazon Prime, you’d find a gaggle of movie and video streaming services and apps trying to catch up to the big three up there. Netflix and video streaming are practically synonymous already, and it will take a lot to battle them for “king of the hill” honors. That said, VUDU is still alive and putting out a new version of its movie streaming service and app, with a couple of new features you may appreciate. \nVUDU is owned by Walmart, and it is one of those services where you can either rent or buy movies either in standard or in high definition. Much like Google Play Movies, it will allow you to watch your movies on any supported device. VUDU version 5.0 brings new features that you may like, including offline rentals and downloads. \nIf you’re traveling for the holidays, you might want to have a movie or three on your tablet or phone to help you pass the time on that plane or train ride. VUDU’s new offline download feature allows you to save on data charges and watch your movies offline. You can download either rented movies or ones that you already purchased, and take it with you on your trip. \nLastly, there’s a new VUDU-exclusive “Extras+” feature, where you can access bonus clips, behind the scenes content, storyline extras, filming locations, and all that stuff made for movie fans like you and me. Download or update your version of the app via the Google Play Store .",

Photo: Netflix \nAfter having his murder conviction overturned in August , Brendan Dassey, one of the subjects of Netflix's Making a Murderer , has been granted a release  from prison under supervision. Dassey has been in prison since 2007 after being sentenced for the 2005 murder of Teresa Halbach. His uncle, Steven Avery, is serving a life sentence for the same crime. Per the judge's order, Dassey may not travel beyond the Eastern District of Wisconsin, obtain a passport, or possess a gun or any controlled substances. He also may not contact Avery or Halbach's family. It isn't clear at the moment whether Dassey will be released immediately, or if his release could be delayed if the state appeals the judge's order.",

Michael Che Matters, streaming Nov. 25. pic.twitter.com/lvhHcXgZZe \n— Netflix US (@netflix) November 14, 2016 While Michael Che's stand-up special for Netflix, Michael Che Matters , was likely in the can before the election results, that doesn't mean that it's still not horribly topical! In fact, it's probably even more topical now, as the Weekend Update anchor talks about Black Lives Matter, pot legalization, and gun rights. You know, relaxing conversations that aren't tearing our nation apart. Michael Che Matters is available for streaming on Netflix the day after Thanksgiving on November 25, just in time to offer you cathartic relief from the previous night's dinner conversations with your extended family.",

      "text": "Netflix to Keep Spending as \"The Crown\" Wins Raves   6:10 PM EST \nIf the data is to believed, Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) is going to be on the hook for a few hundred million more in content costs -- and that's just for The Crown , its historical drama centering on the early reign of Britain's Queen Elizabeth II. \nAs with its other forays into original series, The Crown stretches over 10 one-hour episodes designed for binging. And if the media coverage and critical reviews are to be believed, there are plenty who've taken to consuming the series in big chunks. On Rotten Tomatoes, 91% of the 43 critics weighing in rated the series \"fresh\" -- 92% of audience agreed. Even more impressive: IMDB's calculations place The Crown as television's most popular show. Ahead of The Walking Dead , Westworld , and the latest season of Black Mirror , which, at least in the U.S., also calls Netflix home. If viewership is the standard the standard for whether content investments are worthwhile, it's difficult to fault Netflix for any of its choices. \nThe Crown is a particularly interesting bet in that it appears to be a cross-national draw in both the U.S. and the U.K. A report in The Telegraph out of London says Netflix and creator Peter Morgan are aiming for six seasons and 60 episodes. Morgan, for his part, has yet to confirm there will be a third season. And yet, given the renewed popularity of Britain's royal family, there can be little doubt Netflix would want to order as many episodes as Morgan and his team are willing to write. \nInternational expansion is also a priority for the streaming king. In his third-quarter letter to shareholders, CEO Reed Hastings forecast 40.15 million paid members from overseas markets, accounting for $947 million in revenue. That would be year-over-year growth of 46.3% and 67.3%, respectively, for which The Crown could be materially responsible. Long live the queen. \nTim Beyers owns shares of Netflix.

But with more time for his thoughts and no need for a filter, Che takes his act to a new level for his Netflix comedy special, Michael Che Matters , out Nov. 25. \n“There’s a lot of tension in this country that needs to be addressed,” Che tells an enthusiastic audience in the trailer, which dropped Monday. “Let’s do it right now. Blacks and cops aren’t getting along. I don’t know if you’ve seen the news in the past 400 years. My brother’s a cop, actually. I only see him at Thanksgiving, and even then, I’m like, ‘I’m reaching for the potatoes!’” \nChe goes on to riff on everything from guns and drugs to Hitler in the special, which was filmed at the Greenpoint Terminal Warehouse in Brooklyn. He also doesn’t shy away from the Black Lives Matter movement. \n“We can’t even agree on Black Lives Matter,” says the former Daily Show correspondent. “ ‘All Lives Matter’? That would be like if your wife came up to you and was like, ‘Do you love me?’ And you were like, ‘Baby, I love everybody, what are you talking about?’” \nWatch the trailer below. ",

Lemony Snicket, author of the A Series of Unfortunate Events books — revealed first looks at two characters from the upcoming Netflix adaptation on Monday. Take a peek at Strauss (Joan Cusack) and Dr. Georgina Orwell (Catherine O’Hara). \nThe series stars Neil Patrick Harris as Count Olaf, the sinister guardian of the orphaned Baudelaire children. Justice Strauss (Cusack) is Olaf’s neighbor; the character debuts in the first book, The Bad Beginning, and instantly becomes a favorite of young Violet, Klaus, and Sunny. \nMeanwhile, Dr. Orwell (O’Hara) does more harm than good to the orphans. The optometrist, who debuts in The Miserable Mill (the fourth book), has several tricks up her sleeve, even hypnotizing one of the children to aid in Olaf’s endeavors. \nThere’s a knowing nod to the A Series of Unfortunate Events film with these two reveals: O’Hara played Justice Strauss in the 2004 movie, which encompassed the first three books of Snicket’s 13-installment series. \nA Series of Unfortunate Events season 1 will be released Jan. 13, 2017 on Netflix. A first look at Justice Strauss and Dr. Orwell. Later this week, the @Unfortunate trailer. pic.twitter.com/8ynBSs6Y52 ",

      "text": "After Netflix, Hulu and Amazon Prime, you’d find a gaggle of movie and video streaming services and apps trying to catch up to the big three up there. Netflix and video streaming are practically synonymous already, and it will take a lot to battle them for “king of the hill” honors. That said, VUDU is still alive and putting out a new version of its movie streaming service and app, with a couple of new features you may appreciate.\nVUDU is owned by Walmart, and it is one of those services where you can either rent or buy movies either in standard or in high definition. Much like Google Play Movies, it will allow you to watch your movies on any supported device. VUDU version 5.0 brings new features that you may like, including offline rentals and downloads.\nIf you’re traveling for the holidays, you might want to have a movie or three on your tablet or phone to help you pass the time on that plane or train ride. VUDU’s new offline download feature allows you to save on data charges and watch your movies offline. You can download either rented movies or ones that you already purchased, and take it with you on your trip.\nLastly, there’s a new VUDU-exclusive “Extras+” feature, where you can access bonus clips, behind the scenes content, storyline extras, filming locations, and all that stuff made for movie fans like you and me. Download or update your version of the app via the Google Play Store .\nSOURCE: VUDU\nStory Timeline Walmart's VUDU Spark set to challenge streaming dongles VUDU Movies & TV app brings big update to Android app NVIDIA SHIELD Android TV console gets update, VUDU, 4K60 now available",

      "title": "True Memoirs Of An International Assassin Review",
      "text": "Wait – an original Netflix comedy that doesn’t star Adam Sandler? It’s real! True Memoirs Of An International Assassin only mines from Sandler’s comedian crew for lead actor Kevin James, with no cameos in sight. I mean, you try pitching a movie as “ Spy, but starring a guy!” without James’ name immediately thrown into the mix. That’s what you’re getting here. A Venezuelan spy thriller about some random Joe obsessed with tactical espionage training, who finds out that being a secret agent is even harder than it looks. Fish-out-of-water comedy with deadly consequences – and not a whole lot of substance.\nJames stars as Sam Larson, a hopeful writer whose first book – Memoirs Of An International Assassin – gets marketed as non-fiction by an ambitious publicist (played by Kelen Coleman). Book sales take off, which brings a lot of attention to Sam. He gets as far as a live Yahoo interview with Katie Couric before being outed, but there are still those who believe Sam is actually character Mason Carter, also known as “The Ghost.” One particular individual – a Venezuelan revolutionary known as El Toro (Andy Garcia) – decides he needs The Ghost’s help, so he has Sam kidnapped and shipped overseas. He’s given a mission – kill President Miguel Cueto (Kim Coates), and help start a revolution. Sam obviously has absolutely no experience in the profession of assassinations, but there doesn’t appear to be much of an option. With the help of DEA agent Rosa Bolivar (Zulay Henao), maybe Sam won’t get himself killed in the line of duty – unless gangster Anton Masovich ( Andrew Howard) intervenes. \nLet me start by saying True Memoirs Of An International Assassin is comparatively better than Netflix’s previous original comedies ( The Ridiculous Six / The Do-Over) , which shouldn’t shock many. Kevin James has a certain skillset, adeptly bumbling around as a character who’s always outmatched and never shy about it. Sam Larson is nothing but an author who takes research very seriously, showing cowardice 9-times-out-of-10 in the field. You’ve seen Kevin James stammer and backpedal with nervous energy before, but those of you who watch James’ primetime network sitcoms for the same lovable goofiness will have no problem taking to Sam Larson’s hapless hitman.\nAlthough, James does impress during a tactical siege that brings Mason Carter to life. Sam pictures himself as The Ghost, and when he writes vicious action sequences, imagines himself throwing knives and sniping headshots with ease. James – as Mason Carter – is quick with his reactions and carries the confident bravado of an action star, contrasting his meek, awkward writer reality. Mason Carter always has a catchy line when he saves the girl, while Sam Larson chases women out of elevators with creepy jokes. Plus, we get the added bonus of comical interludes during Sam’s daydreams whenever he suffers from writer’s block, where Mason essentially twiddles his thumbs mid-fight as Sam plots Mason’s next move. James’ performance and Jeff Morris’ momentarily-witty script make for some expendable laughs, giving director Jeff Wadlow more to work with than middling action set pieces. \nThat said, Wadlow’s line-of-fire sensibilities ( Kick-Ass 2/Never Back Down ) never get to fully explode, even with bloodier bullet frenzies than expected. Comedy comes first, yet James’ military superfan can’t sell each exchange that could end with his whole “Ghost” cover being blown. Other attempts at humor include Masovich’s obsession with drinking Zima while wearing banana hammocks, Rosa’s playful out-of-his-league romantic banter and El Toro’s inability to sniff out Sam’s bullshit. Real eccentric movie-quality randomness. Morris’ story squanders jokes and overcomplicates details in unnecessary manner, like how President Miguel Cueto is actually just some dude named Mike from San Diego the CIA implanted. It’s telling that a friend looked over at me and said “How is this movie still going?” as another case of backstabbing buys three more wrap-up scenes.\nTrue Memoirs Of An International Assassin scores a few lucky shots, but ultimately overstays its welcome. That’s not Kevin James’ fault, yet frustration becomes a byproduct of slapstick silliness nowhere near Paul Feig’s satirical (and far superior) Spy . Sam Larson is like a poor man’s James Bond, guzzling beers instead of sipping martinis while accomplishing mission objects using blind luck. You’ll get your James Frey references (remember that Oprah interview?), dance floor fight sequences and a bearded Andy Garcia, so life isn’t all that bad – it’s just not very good, either.\n",

      "text": "Khloé’s   Netflix Is Creating An Actual Stars Hollow For You To Visit   Nice Move \nLiterally nowhere else on the entire planet looks as cute and as charming as the fictional “Stars Hollow” from Gilmore Girls . I mean, c’mon even the name is adorable. It makes you want to live in your winter coat with a coffee cup in your hand with Luckily, for all of us freaks out there Netflix is building up the set for all of us. \nYes, you read right. Netflix will build the set of cute New England town on UCLA in Dickson Court for “The Festival of the Four Seasons”— a nod to the reunion’s four-part seasonal special. In order to honor the new reunion mini-series, the whole shindig starts off Saturday, November 19th from 12-6pm and will continues through the next day. \nEntry is NOT guaranteed, but if you register for the event on Eventbrite , you just might get a chance to tour some of the town’s landmarks like Luke’s Coffee, your favorite gazebo, Kim’s antiques, a seasonal photo booth and much more. Some unnamed Stars Hollow residents will also be making appearances in order to honor the show’s well-anticipated reunion, and the lack of name-dropping suggests it probably won’t be any actual Gilmore girls, but that still sounds pretty cool. So, uhh, do it for the ‘gram. .",

      "text": "Comments Lemony Snicket posted on Twitter a first look at Joan Cusack as Justice Strauss and Catherine O'hara as Dr. Orwell. \nLemony Snicket, the pen name of author Daniel Handler, has revealed the first look at two characters on Netflix's \" A Series of Unfortunate Events \". They are Justice Strauss, portrayed by Joan Cusack , and Dr. Georgina Orwell, who is played by Catherine O'hara . Justice Strauss is Olaf's neighbor. The character debuts in the first book of Snicket's \"A Series of Unfortunate Events\", \"The Bad Beginning\", and instantly becomes a favorite of young Violet, Klaus and Sunny Baudelaire. Meanwhile, Dr. Orwell does more harm than good to the Baudelaire orphans. The character debuts in the fourth book \"The Miserable Mill\". She has several tricks up her sleeve, even hypnotizing one of the children to aid in Olaf's endeavor. A first look at Justice Strauss and Dr. Orwell. Later this week, the @Unfortunate trailer. pic.twitter.com/8ynBSs6Y52 — Daniel Handler (@DanielHandler) 14 November 2016 Netflix's \"A Series of Unfortunate Events\" recounts the tragic tale of the Baudelaire orphans - Violet, Klaus and Sunny - whose evil guardian Count Olaf will stop at nothing to get his hands on their inheritance.

      "text": "0 \"Stranger Things\" Season 2 is scheduled to return to Netflix within the first half of 2017. Facebook/Stranger Things \nThere may not be a lot of leaked details on “Stranger Things” season 2 going around, but Netflix has confirmed an additional three characters for the series. The roles of Linnea Berthelsen, Sean Astin (\"Lord Of The Rings\") and Paul Reiser (\"Whiplash\") are expected to add to the mystery and overall charm of the show. \nREAD: 'Stranger Things' season 2 spoilers: Producer Shawn Levy discusses the cast's first table read \nBerthelsen is a Danish actress who plays the role of Roman. Her official character description illustrates her as “an emotionally damaged, magnetic young woman who suffered a great loss as a child. Although she does not live in Hawkins, she is mysteriously connected to the supernatural events at the lab.” As Entertainment Weekly noted, Berthelsen’s character reads a lot like an older Eleven. \nAustin’s character, named Bob Newby, is described as a little more average. Newby knows Joyce and Hopper, played by Winona Ryder and David Harbour respectively, from high school and currently manages Hawkins RadioShack. His actual role in the story was not provided, but it is estimated that his job will somehow help the “Stranger Things” kids, who more often than not have a gadget with them. \nMeanwhile, Reiser’s Dr. Owens is described as a “a high-ranking member within the Department of Energy on a ‘clean-up’ assignment, tasked with containing the events of last year.” What exactly happened to Dr. Brenner, portrayed by Matthew Modine, in season 1 of “Stranger Things” is still unclear, so it is possible that Dr. Owens will stir up some trouble for Hawkins-residents and non-residents alike. \nREAD: 'Stranger Things' season 2 spoilers: Millie Bobby Brown confirms the return of Eleven \nIt was also earlier confirmed that Dacre Montgomery (“Power Rangers”) and Sadie Sink (“Blue Bloods”) will play a role in the upcoming season. The two play a pair of mysterious siblings, who round up the younger half of the cast. \nMontgomery, 21, will play the role of Billy, a egotistic bad boy. However, his pride and courage is likely to be his downfall as he is also described as aggressive and unpredictable. Meanwhile, 14-year-old Sink will portray the role of Billy’s younger sister, Max. Much like Billy, Max has a tough exterior, but is said to have a complicated past. \n\"Stranger Things\" season 2 is expected to return to Netflix within the first half of 2017.",

      "text": "Ced Kurtz's Techman Texts: Netflix’s limited number of movies is decreasing  00 AM \nTechMan was browsing the shelves of the local library when he spotted a guide to science fiction movies. \nAlways looking for new diversions, he took the book home with the idea of picking out some classic sci-fi films (an maybe some classically bad ones) to look up on Netflix and stream to his computer. \nBut as the title character says in that old action thriller Hamlet, there’s the rub. \nAs I looked up the sci-fi movies tending toward the older ones, I found very few on Netflix. Many were available on DVD but few were there for streaming. \nNetflix does have a lot of movies bur the number is decreasing. According to a report by AllFlicks, Netflix had 6,494 movies and 1,609 TV shows in its U.S. catalog in January 2014. In March of this year, it had 4,335 movies and 1,197 shows. That’s a 33 percent dip in films and a 26 percent drop in television shows. \nThe New York Times pointed out in an article about Netflix’s shrinking library that the service’s original TV series, “Stranger Things,” draws on many cinematic influences including “E.T. The Extraterrestrial,” the first two movies of the “Alien” franchise, John Carpenter’s “The Thing,”“Firestarter” and more — none of which is currently streaming on Netflix. Matt Zoller Seitz, a TV and film critic for New York Magazine said on Twitter that he worries that Netflix no longer cares about older films. \nTo be fair, Netflix is putting out a lot of original content, some of it excellent. \nOf course, there are other movie services. Entertainment sheet Variety reported that Amazon Prime has four times as many movies as Netflix, But I pay for Netflix. My problem is not quantity. I probably won’t watch 4,000 movies in the remainder of my life. The issue is quality. As I browse Netflix, it is getting harder and harder to find something I want to watch. \nDon’t blame us. Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg defended the social network's role in the U.S. presidential election. False news stories that were shared hundreds of thousands of times, including claims that the Pope had endorsed Donald Trump and that Hillary Clinton would be arrested \"surely had no impact\" on the election, he said. He later claimed Facebook will do more to tackle fake news. \nSpeaking of Donald Trump. Tom Wheeler, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, has been a strong proponent of net neutrality, a guarantee that all Internet users are treated the same by Internet providers. But Mr. Trump does not support net neutrality and is not likely to reappoint Mr. Wheeler. \nOn the lighter side. A robot from Infeon Technologies set a new record for solving the Rubik’s Cube — 0.637 second, The Verge reported. \nSend comments, contributions, corrections and condemnations to pgtechtexts@gmail.com.",

      "text": "By Johanna Bennett Omega Advisors has rid itself of Netflix ( NFLX ) and continued to cut its stake in Facebook ( FB ) and Chimera Investments ( CIM ), while adding a stake in Chesapeake Energy ( CHK ) to its portfolio.\nBloomberg News/Landov The hedge fund run by Leon Cooperman , which was charged by the SEC in September with insider trading , disclosed in its quarterly 13F filing released today that it sold the 372,500 shares of Netflix it owned as of June 30 , while also slashing its position in Chimera by 47% to 2.4 million shares as of Sept. 30, cutting Dish Network ( DISH ) to 810,157 shares from just over 1.09 million shares and reducing its Facebook position to 278,100 shares form 322,400 . It also continued to cut its exposure to Dow Chemical ( DOW ) and American International Group ( AIG ).\nBut the filing showed that bought 1.14 million shares of Cliffs Natural Resources ( CLF ) and 273,650 shares of Chesapeake Energy, both new positions. It also took a 2.7 million share stake in Pandora Media ( P ).\nToday marks the deadline for big money managers to reveal holdings as of June 30 in 13F reports filed with the SEC. Requirement for investors managing more than $100 million, the quarterly filings disclose indicate the number of shares held and the value of each stake at the end of the quarter.\nJournalists and investors like to scrutinize — and in some cases copy – the portfolio moves of Wall Street titans like Warren Buffett and hedge fund gurus like Bill Ackman and Carl Icahn. For that reasons, the quarterly 13F filings are closely watched.",

      "text": "Netflix's “Series of Unfortunate Events” unveils 1st look at characters  21   Lemony Snicket, the pen name of author Daniel Handler, has revealed the first look at two characters on Netflix's \"A Series of Unfortunate Events\" . They are Justice Strauss, portrayed by Joan Cusack , and Dr. Georgina Orwell, who is played by Catherine O'hara, AceShowbiz said. \nJustice Strauss is Olaf's neighbor. The character debuts in the first book of Snicket's \"A Series of Unfortunate Events\", \"The Bad Beginning\", and instantly becomes a favorite of young Violet, Klaus and Sunny Baudelaire. \nMeanwhile, Dr. Orwell does more harm than good to the Baudelaire orphans. The character debuts in the fourth book \"The Miserable Mill\". She has several tricks up her sleeve, even hypnotizing one of the children to aid in Olaf's endeavor. \nNetflix's \"A Series of Unfortunate Events\" recounts the tragic tale of the Baudelaire orphans - Violet, Klaus and Sunny - whose evil guardian Count Olaf will stop at nothing to get his hands on their inheritance. The siblings must outsmart Olaf at every turn, foiling his many devious plans and disguises, in order to discover clues to their parents' mysterious death. \nThe eight-episode series is a Netflix original production, executive produced by Emmy Award winner Barry Sonnenfeld and Daniel Handler. The series stars Neil Patrick Harris as Count Olaf, Patrick Warburton as Lemony Snicket, Malina Weissmann as Violet Baudelaire and Louis Hynes as Klaus Baudelaire and many others. \nThe series premieres January 13, 2017 on Netflix.

      "text": "NextUp is Netflix for UK stand-up comedy It costs £3.50 a month and is available on iOS, Android, Roku and Chromecast. Share Save \nWith huge catalogs of movies and TV shows, of which an increasing share are now original, Netflix and Amazon do a good job of catering for most subscribers' tastes. However, their broad focus means that some customers quickly consume the content that is most interesting to them and are left wanting more. This opens the door for streaming providers that focus on a niche or a specific genre, like comedy, which is exactly what UK company NextUp intends to do. \nNextUp brings together dozens of stand-up specials from established and up-and-coming comedians in a Netflix-like package focused on delivering the best in British comedy. Richard Herring, Simon Munnery, Stewart Lee, Miles Jupp, Luisa Omielan and Sean Hughes are all available on the service, offering shows that go beyond the traditional DVD special. \nUnlike Netflix, which either licences content via a major producer or commissions content itself, NextUp aims to give back to comedians. It splits viewing revenue 50/50 with acts, provides links to each comedian's gigs, provides rehearsal space in its London office and includes comedians' older works, preserving them for streamers who want to trawl through a specific act's back catalog. \nOver the last year, there's been a steady rise in comedy-centric streaming services. US TV network NBC launched Seeso , an on-demand platform that centres on TV comedy shows than stand-up, and Laugh.ly took its catalog of big-name US comedians worldwide. \nNextUp costs £3.50 a month following a free 30-day trial and is supported on the web, iPhone (AirPlay compatible), Android, Roku and Chromecast. Videos can be streamed on demand or downloaded and viewed offline.",

      "text": "SHARE 0 \nReady to meet “the ulll-timate dad”? Fans of Lemony Snicket’s A Series of Unfortunate Events recently got their first look at Neil Patrick Harris , starring as Count Olaf, but the first legitimate trailer will be landing this week on Thursday. The actor made the announcement today, while both he and the book’s original author, Daniel Handler , revealed new photos. \nHarris revealed Olaf’s more nautical disguise of Captain Sham, the character’s disguise from the third book, The Wide Window . Handler also revealed the first look at Joan Cusack as Justice Strauss and Catherine O’Hara as Dr. Georgina Orwell. The former becomes an instant favorite of the two objects of Olaf’s nefarious affections, Violet ( Malina Weissman ) and Klaus Baudelaire ( Louis Hynes ), while the latter used some of her medical tricks to aid in Olaf’s plans. \nHarris promised more new looks at the series leading up to the trailer reveal. See the photos below. A first look at Justice Strauss and Dr. Orwell. Later this week, the @Unfortunate trailer. pic.twitter.com/8ynBSs6Y52 \n— Daniel Handler (@DanielHandler) November 14, 2016 \n\nI’m giving you sneaks peeks all week counting down to the @Unfortunate trailer release on Thursday. Prepare to swoon: Here’s Captain Sham. pic.twitter.com/SNvyzb1sFW \n— Neil Patrick Harris (@ActuallyNPH) November 14, 2016 \nSo far, Netflix released a brief teaser trailer with the first look at Olaf, as well as a video of Patrick Warburton (played the story’s narrator, Lemony Snicket) advising us to not “make the same mistake that Netflix has, and look away before this dire tale is even filmed, and avoid the cruel whimsy and whimsical cruelty of what’s to come.” Related Content",

      "text": "\nOne of the major reasons that Netflix’s hit sci-fi series Stranger Things works so well is because it feels like a mash-up of several different sci-fi classics from the 1980s. But easily one of the largest influences on the series from The Duffer Brothers is director Steven Spielberg.\nThe visual style of the director of E.T. The Extra Terrestrial, Close Encounters of the Third Kind , and some would say Poltergeist , (which Spielberg didn’t officially direct) is all over every episode of Stranger Things , and now a video shows us a bunch of the similarities between the work of Steven Spielberg and Stranger Things . \nHere’s the Stranger Things Steven Spielberg influences video created by Really Dim on Vimeo:\n\nLots of these comparisons are rather obvious, though there were some that I wouldn’t have necessarily pieced together, such as E.T. dressing up like a woman and Eleven making herself look more like a typical schoolgirl. But with most of the story focuses on what the kids are doing, the flares of Spielberg are rather obvious in that regard.\nHowever, where Stranger Things departs from Steven Spielberg’s usual style is in just how dark and twisted the story is. Spielberg goes for mystery, but the titles that influenced Stranger Things are a little lighter and more whimsical in a way, especially with regards to their endings. While Stranger Things does have a mostly happy ending, it’s left with some unsolved darkness as well. Next year we’ll find out how the story continues when the series returns for a second season on Netflix.\nThe post VOTD: See The Visual Influences of Steven Spielberg in Netflix’s ‘Stranger Things’ appeared first on /Film .\n",

      "text": "\nSee Full Gallery Here \nA Series of Unfortunate Events unfold in the latest pair of photos for Netflix’s forthcoming series, introducing us to both the distraught Baudelaire orphans and their conniving guardian, Count Olaf.\nHow I Met Your Mother stalwart Neil Patrick Harris is on board to portray the latter, even sporting a sinister-looking nose and ghastly monobrow to boot. Promising cruel whimsy and whimsical cruelty, A Series of Unfortunate Events is a new spin on the novel series by Lemony Snicket (AKA Daniel Handler) and bears no affiliation to the 2004 movie that had Jim Carrey in the role of Olaf. It’s still the same tragic tale, of course, with Violet (Malina Weissman), Sunny and Klaus Baudelaire (Louis Hynes) struggling to catch a break after the untimely – and downright mysterious – death of their parents. Things go from bad to worse when they’re introduced to their newfound guardian, Olaf, who will stop at nothing to get his claws on the family inheritance.\nCurious to get a glimpse of Netflix’s series in motion? Worry not, for today’s new photos are designed to ramp up excitement ahead of Thursday’s trailer reveal. In the meantime, we now have our first look at Justice Strauss and Dr. Orwell, courtesy of Handler himself.\nA first look at Justice Strauss and Dr. Orwell. Later this week, the @Unfortunate trailer. pic.twitter.com/8ynBSs6Y52 \n— Daniel Handler (@DanielHandler) November 14, 2016 \n\nThere’s also word of the official synopsis, which you can find below.\nBased on the internationally best-selling series of books by Lemony Snicket (aka Daniel Handler) and starring Emmy and Tony Award winner Neil Patrick Harris, A Series of Unfortunate Events recounts the tragic tale of the Baudelaire orphans — Violet, Klaus, and Sunny – whose evil guardian Count Olaf will stop at nothing to get his hands on their inheritance. The siblings must outsmart Olaf at every turn, foiling his many devious plans and disguises, in order to discover clues to their parents’ mysterious death.\nStrap in, folks; Netflix is poised to kick start A Series of Unfortunate Events on January 13, 2017. The inaugural season will run for eight episodes in total, and you can get a peek at Harris’ dastardly Count Olaf via the teaser trailer below. Don’t forget as well that the all-new trailer is due to drop on Thursday, so be sure to check back to We Got This Covered as we’ll have full coverage.\n",

      "text": "Tweet Netflix’s Millie Bobby Brown wants a role on The Walking Dead. \nStranger Things ‘ Millie Bobby Brown is one of the most popular child actors in Hollywood right now and is perhaps destined for super stardom. \nDuring a panel discussion at Rhode Island Comic Con, not only did Brown express interest in the hit Walking Dead TV series but, she revealed that she’s interested in joining the cast of The Walking Dead or playing the iconic Princess Leia in any upcoming Star Wars movies. \nDuring a panel at Rhode Island Comic Con, she revealed she’s been pushing for a part on apocalyptic megahit The Walking Dead . “There’s this one show I just want to be on so badly, I’ve tried everything to get on The Walking Dead. I don’t even care if I’m a zombie,” she said, according to ComicBook , though she also mentioned she’s interested in doing something “calmer and more soft, instead of hardcore.” \nBrown, who played telekinetic, pre-teen heroin Eleven, showed she’s got the acting chops for the Walking Dead. Back in 2014, she starred in U.K. drama The Intruders as a 9-year-old girl overtaken by a murderer’s soul. In Stranger Things, Brown was able to channel a darker, creepier character, even though her goodness trumped even her evil scientist grandfather. \nIn October, she also said she’s intersted in venturing into comedy. “ I’d love to do a project where I’m funny, ” Brown said during a panel at New York Comic Con, as Bustle reported. For now, she’s still very much committed to Stranger Things, which is now filming in Atlanta, Georgia. \nSurprisingly, this could happen as both TV shows filming in Georgia. Someone make this happen! \nWhat do you think? Discuss this story with fellow Project Casting fans on Facebook . On Twitter, follow us at @projectcasting .",

      "text": "\nMarvel TV has a lot on the way in the future, but most of that is on Netflix, leaving Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. to hold down the fort on network television. (We miss you, Agent Carter .) That won’t be the case for much longer, though, as they’ll be bringing an Inhumans show to ABC in the fall of 2017.\nWe still don’t know much about it, though, as Marvel announced the show in a rather odd release that focused more on their cross-platform marketing initiative with IMAX than anything else about the show. Basically, the series, all shot with IMAX cameras, will debut in IMAX theaters in the first two weeks of September 2017 before airing weekly on ABC. This is how the describe the actual content of the show:\n“The Inhumans, a race of superhumans with diverse and singularly unique powers, were first introduced in Marvel Comics by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby in 1965. Since that time, they have grown in prominence and become some of the most popular and iconic characters in the Marvel Universe. Marvel’s The Inhumans will explore the never-before-told epic adventure of Black Bolt and the royal family.”\nWhat’s worth noting is that this is not a S.H.I.E.L.D. spin-off (not directly, anyway), nor is it the planned Inhumans movie that Marvel pulled from its schedule, according to The Hollywood Reporter . This will be a separate group of Inhumans in their own storyline. But, like, who cares about the story or creative team or actors or anything. Are you all excited for this “first-of-its-kind multi-platform production”!?\n(via Jill Pantozzi on Twitter , image via Marvel Entertainment)\nWant more stories like this?

      "title": "Donald Trump Supporters Boycott Pepsi, Macy’s, Dreamworks and Netflix",
      "text": "11/15/16 AT 11:35 AM Close \nIn a campaign to \"drain the swamp\" and shrink the wallets of government elites, supporters of President-elect Donald Trump urged one another Monday to boycott a variety of corporate behemoths in support of Hillary Clinton and general liberal ideals. The list posted on Reddit included PepsiCo, Macy’s, Dell, Dreamworks and Netflix, and also featured companies to support, such as several mass-market breweries and fast food restaurants, the National Rifle Association, Nascar, World Wrestling Entertainment and “cars made in America.\" \nSome business leaders were critical of Trump before and after Election Day. PepsiCo, which owns Mountain Dew, Lipton, Lays, Ruffles and Doritos, among other popular snacks, angered some conservatives after CEO Indra Nooyi said Trump's victory had made people feel unsafe because of his stances against Muslims, immigrants and LGBT rights. Macy's dumped Trump brand merchandise last year after he called immigrants from Mexico and other countries \"killers and rapists.\" \nIt’s not clear what impact the right-wing Redditors will have on these large companies, but a few smaller businesses may actually stand to benefit because of their size and the demographics of their surrounding area. \nFricano’s Pizza in Grand Rapids, Michigan, which sits right under Coors on the pro-Trump Redditors’ list of favored institutions, made headlines in late October when owner Doug Fricano posted a rant to Facebook calling Clinton “the most evil corrupt dishonest lying person on the planet [sic].” As for a leaked audio where Trump bragged about sexually assaulting women , the pizza shop owner added, “At least he was saying it to another man and not a woman.” \nGrand Rapids is in the heart of right-leaning Kent County, where 147,959 voters chose Trump over 138,567 who chose Clinton. After the controversies, Fricano reported an uptick in sales. Related Stories Trump’s Tax Plan Could Create More Donald Trumps \n“They’re here because they support me,” he told local broadcaster Fox 17 . “They support that I said what I believe in.” \nIn Pennsylvania, Maple Donuts in York County featured prominent flags reading “Make America Great Again” in June, local Fox 43 reported . At least one of its stores sells a cherry-filled, white frosting-coated doughnut called “the Trump,” according to the York Daily Record . The pastry shop appears on the pro-Trump Reddit list of “Organizations to Support.” York County backed Trump over Clinton. \nIn Wilmington, Massachusetts, Benevento Asphalt Corp. won a spot on the Trump fans’ list after the company painting the Trump campaign logo, along with the slogan “Make America Great Again” on its trucks. \n“The Benevento Companies have survived all these years because we believe in the fundamental values that are the birthright of every American,” Charles Benevento, who inherited the business from his father and grandfather, told the Wilmington Apple . “Something happened over the past several years that has steered the country away from these basic values and I believe in the message that we need to ‘Make America Great Again’ and move the country in a different direction.” Join the Discussion Everything You Need To Know, Right Now. \nThe IBT Pulse Newsletter keeps you connected to the biggest stories unfolding in the global economy.

      "text": " Netflix’s ‘The Little Prince’ Behind the Scenes Footage Reveals the Magic of Animation (Exclusive Video) Now streaming on Netflix, a behind the scenes glimpse at “The Little Prince” released on Tuesday shows how the film uniquely fused together four different types of animation: hand drawn 2D animation, CG animation, paper cutout animation and stop-motion animation.\nThe film flawlessly weaves together CG animation to show the world of the main character, The Little Girl, while stop-motion animation was used to bring the pages of the beloved book to life.\nDirected by Mark Osborne, “The Little Prince” was inspired by the popular French novella “Le Petit Prince” by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry. The story resonated with people of all ages because of its universal themes of friendship, love and loss. The film is voiced by an all star cast including Jeff Bridges, Rachel McAdams, James Franco, Marion Cotillard and Mackenzie Foy.\nAlso Read: 'The Little Prince' Director on Why He Strayed From Classic Children's Book\n“Some of my favorite shots in the film took up to nine days to animate,” Osborne said in the video. “Computer animation really helped us to create a groundbreaking, believable world. I felt that stop motion was the best way to tap into that childlike universe.”\n“The Little Prince,” tells the story of a little girl and her overly organized, type-A mother who move in next door to an old aviator who lives in a ramshackle house. The aviator, voiced by Bridges, tells (and draws) the story of his encounter with the little prince, and that encounter with the story in Saint-Exupery’s book changes the life of the little girl.\n Netflix is campaigning the film in all categories including Best Animated Feature, Best Production Design (Lou Romano and Alexander Juhasz), Best Adapted Screenplay (Irena Brignull and Bob Persichetti) and Best Original Score (Hans Zimmer and Richard Harvey).\nRead original story Netflix’s ‘The Little Prince’ Behind the Scenes Footage Reveals the Magic of Animation (Exclusive Video) At TheWrap",

      "text": "http://www.thewrap.com/netflix-the-little-prince-featurette/ Netflix’s ‘The Little Prince’ Behind the Scenes Footage Reveals the Magic of Animation (Exclusive Video) Since it debuted at the Cannes Film Festival in 2015, “The Little Prince” has made more than $100 million around the world Umberto Gonzalez, provided by Published 9:00 am, Tuesday, November 15, 2016 Image 1 of / 1 Close Image 1 of 1 Netflix’s ‘The Little Prince’ Behind the Scenes Footage Reveals the Magic of Animation (Exclusive Video)   \nNow streaming on Netflix, a behind the scenes glimpse at “The Little Prince” released on Tuesday shows how the film uniquely fused together four different types of animation: hand drawn 2D animation, CG animation, paper cutout animation and stop-motion animation. \nThe film flawlessly weaves together CG animation to show the world of the main character, The Little Girl, while stop-motion animation was used to bring the pages of the beloved book to life. \nDirected by Mark Osborne, “The Little Prince” was inspired by the popular French novella “Le Petit Prince” by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry. The story resonated with people of all ages because of its universal themes of friendship, love and loss. The film is voiced by an all star cast including Jeff Bridges, Rachel McAdams, James Franco, Marion Cotillard and Mackenzie Foy. Also Read: 'The Little Prince' Director on Why He Strayed From Classic Children's Book \n“Some of my favorite shots in the film took up to nine days to animate,” Osborne said in the video. “Computer animation really helped us to create a groundbreaking, believable world. I felt that stop motion was the best way to tap into that childlike universe.” \n“The Little Prince,” tells the story of a little girl and her overly organized, type-A mother who move in next door to an old aviator who lives in a ramshackle house. The aviator, voiced by Bridges, tells (and draws) the story of his encounter with the little prince, and that encounter with the story in Saint-Exupery’s book changes the life of the little girl. var googletag = googletag || {}; googletag.cmd = googletag.cmd || []; googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.defineOutOfPageSlot('/30981161/TheWrapRemnantOOP', 'div-gpt-ad-1470167200293-0').addService(googletag.pubads()); googletag.pubads().enableSingleRequest(); googletag.enableServices(); }); googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1470167200293-0'); }); \nNetflix is campaigning the film in all categories including Best Animated Feature, Best Production Design (Lou Romano and Alexander Juhasz), Best Adapted Screenplay (Irena Brignull and Bob Persichetti) and Best Original Score (Hans Zimmer and Richard Harvey). \nRead original story Netflix’s ‘The Little Prince’ Behind the Scenes Footage Reveals the Magic of Animation (Exclusive Video) At TheWrap Latest from the SFGATE homepage: Click below for the top news from around the Bay Area and beyond.

      "text": "Despite the ease of streaming films on services such as Netflix and Hulu and the prevalence of home video libraries, with films available on DVD and Blu-ray, catching an older film on the big screen remains a popular pursuit.\nAnd it’s not just at revival houses in bigger cities: The Michael Jordan/animated classic “Space Jam” received a two-day nationwide rerelease on Nov. 13 and 16 in celebration of its 20th anniversary.\nAfter Prince died unexpectedly in late April, AMC Theatres did a limited run of the music icon’s 1984 “Purple Rain” motion picture debut at 87 of its multiplexes.\nRecommended: Famous movie lines: How well do you know them? Movie studios digitally restore the films prior to their rerelease on video, so exhibitors can usually show versions of classics that are more vibrant than the prints that were originally screened.\nTest your knowledge Famous movie lines: How well do you know them? “There is a niche – but it’s a broad niche – of cinephiles who are willing and able to see these films in the best shape that they’ve been able to,” Tom Lucas, vice president of Studio Relations at Fathom Events, says.\nFounded in 2002 and based in a suburb of Denver, Fathom Events is a distributor of self-described “cinematic events” such as live opera, theater, and music performances; BBC television programs, including “Sherlock” and “Dr. Who”; and faith-based films. Theatrical rereleases of feature films constitute about 20 percent of its offerings.\n“People come out in the hundreds of thousands to celebrate key anniversaries and see restored or remastered films,” says John Rubey, chief executive officer of Fathom Events. “This despite the fact that they already own what they’re seeing on VHS, DVD, Blu-ray, and through Vudu or UltraViolet.\n“The big screen just can’t be replicated,” Mr. Lucas adds.\nWhile advancements in consumer video and audio equipment make the at-home experience more comparable to the cinematic one, the communal aspect continues to be appealing to fans. “They’ve got to see it with everyone else,” Mr. Rubey notes.\nSocial media has helped to foster the mini-revival trend. Trailers for the rereleases are uploaded online (as well as played in movie theaters) and shared among friends and followers.\n“As a business, Fathom would not exist on the scale that we do without that,” Rubey says. “Trailers create new awareness, and social media allows everyone to share and engage.”",

      "text": "If you’ve been binge-watching Gilmore Girls on Netflix in the run-up to its revival — maybe for the first time, maybe for the seventeenth, who’s counting — you may have noticed something weird. The main thumbnail image for the show, which appears on the browser and also as a placeholder while each new episode is loading, does not feature either of the show’s main characters, Lorelai and Rory Gilmore.\nInstead, Netflix seems to think that the show Gilmore Girls is mostly about Milo Ventimiglia as Stars Hollow’s resident rebel without a cause Jess Mariano. Jess doesn’t even appear until the second season, which must make things especially confusing for first-time viewers (to Quote: one Gilmore newbie on the Cosmo staff: “Why the f**k is this guy the thumbnail pic?”)\n Here’s how Gilmore Girls shows up on my Netflix account…\nOne of these things is not like the others. Let’s scroll along to the next panel of my Continue Watching list.\nFrom this, you can glean two things: a) I start a lot of TV episodes without finishing them because I am fickle AF and also have seen most of them before, and b) there is no other show in which a minor character is used as the index image. Buffy the Vampire Slayer ? That’s a picture of Buffy Summers. Jessica Jones? Krysten Ritter’s Jessica. Grey’s Anatomy ? Meredith Grey. But for Gilmore Girls ? Let’s use a picture of this dude who ain’t a Gilmore, or a Girl, and also appears in less than a third of the show’s total episodes (37 out of 154, not including the upcoming ones).\n…WTF? Even Dean would have made more sense in terms of total screen time in the show (63 out of 154), and I hate Dean . I actually lean towards Jess if forced to pick between Rory’s three not-that-great boyfriends (mostly because I’m a sucker for unresolved tension) — but even for the most diehard Team Jess fans, he makes absolutely no sense as the show’s defining image. A cursory glance at Twitter confirmed that I am not alone in my confusion.\n. @netflix why is the cover photo for Gilmore girls a picture of Jess and not Rory and/or lorelai? It's called Gilmore GIRLS & is about them!\n— Hannah Frank (@HanFran195) November 6, 2016 #WeNeedFeminism because why the fuck is Jess on the Netflix pic for Gilmore Girls and not Lorelai and Rory pic.twitter.com/SDqzjmMPQb\n— Ryan Chang (@Ryan2Changz) October 27, 2016 It makes me mad that the picture of Gilmore Girls on Netflix is of Jess... Like no this is not about Jess this is about Rory and Lorelai bye\n— Haylie McLinn (@hayliemclinn) October 27, 2016 There’s a lot more where those came from. I reached out to Netflix to ask what’s up, and while they politely declined to comment on this specific instance, they pointed me towards a blog post about how they choose index images. Unsurprisingly, they put a lot of thought into it, and thumbnails go through an extensive testing process to determine which gets most users to click through.\n“We now have the unique ability to understand how to most effectively tell our members why a story is right for them — all through a single image,” writes Nick Nelson in the blog post. Which is awesome — except that it makes no sense in this instance. Like this image of a handsome dude in a denim jacket standing in front of indistinct greenery? Then you’ll love this show about the nuanced relationship between a single mom and her teenage daughter!\nThis is no shade on Milo Ventimiglia or his excellent face, which under ordinary circumstances I’d be happy to look at whenever. But it’s not as if he’s a huge name with star power, and Gilmore Girls is a show that shines specifically because of its focus on relationships between women — not just Lorelai and Rory’s endlessly engaging bond, but Lorelai’s wary, occasionally heartbreaking dynamic with her own mother Emily, or Rory’s delightfully spiky and weird friendship with Paris Geller .\nIs Jess really the image that inspired most Netflix users to watch Gilmore Girls ? Did Netflix test numerous thumbnail options including the more obvious shots of Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel, only to discover that what you really need to sell a show about women is a picture of a dude? This is just plain sad to contemplate — and it also doesn’t seem to make sense, given that Buffy, Jessica, Meredith etc. are front and center in the thumbnails for their own shows.\nThe other possibility, of course, is that Netflix is doing some not-all-that-subtle subliminal messaging to try and steer us all onto the Jess path in the run-up to A Year In The Life , because Rory is going to end up with Jess. I’m choosing to go with that theory, at least until November 25.\nFollow Emma on Twitter .\n ",

      "text": "Sign up for our Newsletters . Daily Edition A Fireworks Artist's 20-Year Path to Making a 2-Minute Explosion for Netflix's 'Sky Ladder' 10:00 AM PST 11/15/2016 by Jordan Riefe Lin Yi/Courtesy of Cai Studio/Netflix Cai Guo-Qiang's \"Elegy: Explosion Event\" took place in 2014 in Shanghai. The documentary follows Cai Guo-Qiang's quest to create a 1,650-foot combustible ladder in China: \"The sound was majestic.\" \nFireworks artist Cai Guo-Qiang first met Wendi Murdoch in 2002 at the Royal Academy in London during one of his explosion events called \"Money Net.\" Both New Yorkers, they kept in touch, with Murdoch attending his openings and purchasing some of his nonexplosive works. \"When my studio staff proposed a documentary film, we immediately went to Wendi, who assembled the team and the director,\" Cai says of the origins of the Netflix film Sky Ladder: The Art of Cai Guo-Qiang , directed by Kevin Macdonald and produced by Murdoch, with Bennett Miller executive producing. \nThe son of a painter and calligrapher, Cai came of age during the artistic awakening in China following the death of Mao in 1976. He appeared in two martial arts movies and studied theater in Shanghai before decamping for Japan, where he developed the process that would lead to the massive explosive events he's known for today, like \"Footprints of History\" for the 2008 Beijing Olympics and \"Mystery Circle\" at L.A.'s MOCA Geffen in 2012. \nThe climax of the film centers on \"Sky Ladder,\" a 1,650-foot ladder made of explosives suspended from a balloon. It combusts in an upward path, illuminating one fiery rung at a time. Since 1994, Cai has gone through several fizzled attempts — in cities from Shanghai to L.A. — to realize the work, which the 58-year-old artist dedicated to his 100-year-old grandmother. She wasn't able to attend when \"Sky Ladder\" finally rose above Huiyu Island Harbour in Quanzhou, China. But thanks to technology that didn't exist when Cai first conceived the work in the 1990s, she still was able to see it. \nOver 20 years and hundreds of thousands of your own money, you never gave up on \"Sky Ladder.\" How does it feel now that it's done? \nFirst, it was beautiful. The sound was majestic, and overall it was quite moving. Secondly, I was able to dedicate this work to my grandma, even though two days before the realization of the piece I had to come to terms with the fact that she was too frail to see it in person. I was so grateful she was able to see it from an iPad. My mother and my wife's parents were able to see it in person. It was important for me, after doing pieces all over the world, to be able to bring one piece and present it to my family in person. \nIn the film, filmmaker Zhang Yimou says that in some ways the '80s was a freer time for Chinese artists. \nBack in the '80s we had a dream, a pursuit, more of a spiritual pursuit of something better and higher. And now we face restraints to freedom not only from political censorship but also from an overly commercialized climate. Even though the market for art is larger than ever before, and the capital available is also more, the power in the artwork and its ability to say something deeper about humanity, or offer philosophical or political reflection, is, in general, weaker. \nWhat about the 2008 Beijing Olympics? Artist Ai Weiwei has criticized it as a success for the government at the expense of common citizens. \nThe artworks I contributed helped the people and the country become more international, more modern and more artistic. Even though back then not all of my concepts and goals were realized, I insisted and I persisted in going on this difficult and slow process of offering my contributions. I've always emphasized the individual values, voice and creativity, which in itself is political. \nThis story first appeared in a November standalone issue of The Hollywood Reporter magazine.

      "text": "Comment Brendan Dassey is pictured in this undated booking photo obtained by Reuters January 29, 2016. The television documentary \"Making a Murderer,\" -- from the case against Steven Avery and Dassey, who were convicted of killing freelance photographer Teresa Halbach in 2005 -- has put Manitowoc on the map. REUTERS/Manitowoc County Sheriff's Department/Handout via Reuters \nBrendan Dassey, whose conviction was profiled in the Netflix series \"Making A Murderer\", has been ordered for release from prison. US Magistrate Judge William Duffin already overturned the conviction in August against Dassey, ordering his release within 90 days unless an appeal is made by the prosecution. \nThe appeal was made by the attorney general of Wisconsin, but the defense asked for him to be released, claiming that he does not pose a threat to society should he be released from prison. On Monday, the judge approved the immediate release of Dassey, NPR reported. \nBrendan Dassey's date of release was not given, and he has until Tuesday to indicate which home he will stay in, given that federal officers will need to inspect it first. But Wisconsin Attorney General Brad Schimel states that they will file a motion in the Court of Appeals to ensure that Dassey will not get out of prison. \nDassey is not allowed to contact any family member of Teresa Halbach, whose murder he is convicted of, nor his uncle Steve Avery, who is still in prison for the crime. \nBrenday Dassey, along with his uncle Steve Avery, were convicted of the murder of photographer Teresa Halbach in October 2005. He was charged with first-degree intentional homicide, second-degree sexual assault and mutilating a corpse. But in August of this year, Judge Duffin proclaimed that Dassey was tricked by the investigators of the crime. He was coerced into confessing that he helped his uncle kill Halbachand and was assured that he had nothing to worry about. \nBrenda Dassey was then a 16-year old who was enrolled in special education classes. He was described in court documents as someone who had a hard time understanding language and even speaking. \nThe case of the murder of Teresa Halbach and the subsequent conviction of Steve Avery and his nephew Brendan Dassey received nationwide and international attention when the Netflix aired the \"Making a Murderer\" docu-series. \nThe docu-series garnered negative reaction from citizens who feel that the two were wrongfully convicted. The filmmakers feel that the conduct of the law officials involved in the investigation was not right. Steven Avery was already imprisoned for the assault of a Penny Beerntsen, even though he had an alibi during the time of the crime. He then spent 18 years, after he was exonerated, filed a lawsuit against Maniwotoc County. \nThe docu-series \"Making A Murderer\" explored the conflict of interest in the handling of the Halbach Murder. Avery maintained his position that it was a frame up and he was innocent. \nTelegraph reports that Brenday Dassey's lawyer, Steve Drizin, stated that he hopes that Dassey, now 27, will be able to spend Thanksgiving out of prison.",

      "text": "Channel 4 responds to rise of Netflix and Amazon with heavy investment in online programming By Jessica Goodfellow - 15 November 2016 17:30pm All4 new look \nChannel 4 is revitalising its on-demand platform All4, expanding into new content areas and pumping a multi-million pound investment into original and acquired online content as the broadcaster hopes to capitalise on the growth of connected TV viewing and compete with the giants in this space: Netflix and Amazon. \nAt its Upfronts today (15 November), the broadcaster unveiled a bold new interface for its on-demand platform to stand out in the connected TV space, and has designed the user experience to be tailored to each platform including iOS, Android and All4.com. \nThe new home screens herald greater personalisation, combining human curation with data-driven recommendations tailored for each user. \nChannel 4 also announced a multi-million pound increase in investment of original and acquired online content for All 4 in 2017. The broadcaster will also increase its brand-funded series, Shorts, which launched in 2014 and has so far produced 18 original series for 12 advertisers on the All 4 platform. \nFurthermore, the All 4 commissioning team revealed eight new thematic strands reminiscent of the kind of content commissioned by youth brands like Vice as it looks to better serve its millennial audience, currently reaching over half of all 16-34 year olds in the UK. \nThese include ‘New Romantics’, which will explore modern love in all its forms; ‘Rich Kids’, an examination of what it means to have a rich life; ‘Ballsy’, a home for those pushing life to the limits; and ‘Freaks & Uniques’, a look at extraordinary people living unbelievable lives. There are also strands for leading edge music and culture, gaming and the internet, topical series and mid-form millennial drama and comedy. \nRichard Davidson-Houston, head of All 4 and digital content at Channel 4, said: “This phase in All 4’s evolution sees us yank it out of the world of catch-up TV and into the expanding OTT space. In all aspects of the user experience from editorial to design and functionality, All 4 is becoming more personal and intuitive to use. Time is precious and our mission is to ensure that All 4 always hits the spot.”",

      "text": "Netflix had a dismal second quarter, followed by a resurgent third quarter. \nNetflix's partnership with Disney places it in the vanguard of streaming services. \nRumors are floating around that Disney is considering purchasing Netflix. \nNetflix looks like a good buy. For the most part, tech stocks are down across the board. Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple and Facebook are taking hits. Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ), however, is catching its second breath. A breath perhaps fueled by rumors that Disney is contemplating purchasing Netflix. Ostensibly, Disney dreams of becoming a streaming colossus. Some analysts assert it won't happen because Netflix is not for sale. Others think it could happen, but would ruin the movie industry. Netflix had a bad second quarter report, but then things tilted the right way in the third quarter. Netflix added almost 18 million subscribers. In October, the company's third quarter report signified earnings per share of $.12, double the $.06 analysts expected, up 71% over the previous year's third quarter. During September, Netflix's content partnership with Disney became reality, which meant that Netflix was no longer beating the bushes and spending way too much money for content. Netflix's partnership with Disney indicates Netflix now has direct access to the mega-hits its viewers want, movie s from Pixar, Marvel Entertainment and LucasFilm. For example, Zootopia is already streaming on Netflix. The common perception is that Netflix's stock price is tied to subscribers. If the number of subscribers increases, the stock goes up. If subscribers go down, so does the stock. This is pretty much axiomatic. Netflix's business model is not complicated. Right now, Netflix has 89 million international and domestic subscribers. After the dismal second quarter, the company's stock dropped to $100. When the third quarter report came out, the stock leapfrogged to $116 and topped out at $133. The election results sent the stock tumbling to $111. At the present juncture, the stock sits at $114, more than likely because of the Disney rumor. In other words, Netflix is now in the cat-bird seat. The same thing that caused a lousy second quarter - lack of new subscribers - has pulled a U-turn and is propelling the company forward. With more and better content from Disney, Netflix is now positioned to raise prices , while simultaneously adding subscribers. Along with its existing Disney content, Netflix will be releasing proprietary movies in theaters owned and operated by iPic Entertainment, and is looking to increase original content available to subscribers. A gaggle of analysts currently project Netflix's median price at $130, with a high of $160. If the Disney rumor evaporates, there might be a pullback. And if Disney does opt to make a move, Netflix's prospects will go from excellent to grandiose. Either way, regardless of what Disney does, this is a great time to buy Netflix. Hold it for three months and sell, reaping around 20%, or settle in for the long-term. Netflix is on the brink of taking off and the flight should last through 2017. Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.    ",

      "title": "A Fireworks Artist's 20-Year Path to Making a 2-Minute Explosion for Netflix's 'Sky Ladder'",
      "text": "Fireworks artist Cai Guo-Qiang first met Wendi Murdoch in 2002 at the Royal Academy in London during one of his explosion events called \"Money Net.\" Both New Yorkers, they kept in touch, with Murdoch attending his openings and purchasing some of his nonexplosive works. \"When my studio staff proposed a documentary film, we immediately went to Wendi, who assembled the team and the director,\" Cai says of the origins of the Netflix film Sky Ladder: The Art of Cai Guo-Qiang, directed by Kevin Macdonald and produced by Murdoch, with Bennett Miller executive producing.\nThe son of a painter and calligrapher, Cai came of age during the artistic awakening in China following the death of Mao in 1976. He appeared in two martial arts movies and studied theater in Shanghai before decamping for Japan, where he developed the process that would lead to the massive explosive events he's known for today, like \"Footprints of History\" for the 2008 Beijing Olympics and \"Mystery Circle\" at L.A.'s MOCA Geffen in 2012.\nWen-You Cai/Netflix\nThe climax of the film centers on \"Sky Ladder,\" a 1,650-foot ladder made of explosives suspended from a balloon. It combusts in an upward path, illuminating one fiery rung at a time. Since 1994, Cai has gone through several fizzled attempts - in cities from Shanghai to L.A. - to realize the work, which the 58-year-old artist dedicated to his 100-year-old grandmother. She wasn't able to attend when \"Sky Ladder\" finally rose above Huiyu Island Harbour in Quanzhou, China. But thanks to technology that didn't exist when Cai first conceived the work in the 1990s, she still was able to see it.\nRead more: Oscars: 10 Doc Shorts That Go to Great Lengths\nOver 20 years and hundreds of thousands of your own money, you never gave up on \"Sky Ladder.\" How does it feel now that it's done?\nFirst, it was beautiful. The sound was majestic, and overall it was quite moving. Secondly, I was able to dedicate this work to my grandma, even though two days before the realization of the piece I had to come to terms with the fact that she was too frail to see it in person. I was so grateful she was able to see it from an iPad. My mother and my wife's parents were able to see it in person. It was important for me, after doing pieces all over the world, to be able to bring one piece and present it to my family in person.\nIn the film, filmmaker Zhang Yimou says that in some ways the '80s was a freer time for Chinese artists.\nBack in the '80s we had a dream, a pursuit, more of a spiritual pursuit of something better and higher. And now we face restraints to freedom not only from political censorship but also from an overly commercialized climate. Even though the market for art is larger than ever before, and the capital available is also more, the power in the artwork and its ability to say something deeper about humanity, or offer philosophical or political reflection, is, in general, weaker.\nRead More Cai Studio/Netflix\nWhat about the 2008 Beijing Olympics? Artist Ai Weiwei has criticized it as a success for the government at the expense of common citizens.\nThe artworks I contributed helped the people and the country become more international, more modern and more artistic. Even though back then not all of my concepts and goals were realized, I insisted and I persisted in going on this difficult and slow process of offering my contributions. I've always emphasized the individual values, voice and creativity, which in itself is political.\nThis story first appeared in a November standalone issue of The Hollywood Reporter magazine.

      "text": "Expect more collaboration between cable giants and Netflix, potentially using joint billing to reduce customer churn, the billionaire media mogul John Malone, chairman of Liberty Media and Liberty Global, among others, said Thursday.\nSpeaking to a Liberty Media investor day, Malone also forecast a stronger American dollar, accelerated growth, higher interest rates and some inflation under a Donald Trump administration. \"I think the deregulatory aspects of a Republican administration will be favorable. I think the likelihood you will see government intervening to support one particular industry's goals, relative to another's, is probably less risky today that it would have been two days ago,\" he told investors.\nOn Netflix, Malone said industry cooperation on technologies and the sharing of video streaming revenue was a needed response to cable unbundling and cord-cutting. \"When it comes to working together, the core of your question on bundling is really about unbundling,\" he told analysts when asked about Netflix showing up on more cable schedules after Liberty Global welcomed the video streaming giant onto its TV set-top boxes in more than 30 countries.\nThat's just the beginning of cross-industry collaboration to combat cord-cutting as bringing Netflix inside Liberty Global's walled garden involved revenue splits, joint marketing and potentially combined billing.\n\"I think the evidence is pretty good that that structure will dramatically reduce Netflix's churn, which is important to them, and enhance marketing,\" said Malone. He pointed to the cost benefits of cable and wireless giants signing up subscribers to new content services and offerings like Netflix as a better business model than starting up or acquiring new content businesses and running up development and marketing costs.\n\"That's the beginning of what will happen, as a ton of a la carte and mini services will be offered to the consumer as an adjunct to the broadband connection, as opposed to the large bundle,\" Malone explained. \"The evolution will see the distributors participating in video revenue streams on the one side, as margins and penetration of the big bundle slowly declines, and it will all balance out,\" he added.\nThe exec argued industry collaboration will inevitably involve wireless providers as consumers embrace a so-called quad play. \"And clearly what's evolving now with AT&T will push the industry to move in that direction more quickly,\" he added.\nAsked about his company's recent acquisition of Formula One, which will involve team owners as stakeholders, Malone likened TV sports to an illicit drug. \"Sports is a little bit of cocaine,\" he said. \"It's very powerful. And if you're in the right markets, it can really move shares, it can really move a business. But the risk with it is who really ends up owning the money. Frequently, it's not even the team owners, it's the players.\"\nRead more: Liberty Global CEO Talks Netflix Integration, Content Acquisitions",

By Nov. 15, 2016 4:10 p.m. ET Text Size ENLARGE Photo: Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg \nStocks can make big moves during earnings season. Better-than-expected results, or a rosier outlook for the coming months, may send shares soaring. And of course, disappointing figures, slowing growth, or a gloomy outlook for the future can deliver a real blow. \nThese aren’t hard-and-fast rules, but we saw them generally hold true among the biggest movers in the Barron’s Next 50 , our index of companies that are of interest to millennials. Forty-five of them reported earnings recently. The stocks that did well, in many cases, saw big growth in metrics unique to their industries, such as subscriber growth or ad sales. Of those stocks that fell, many offered less-than-inspiring inklings about future performance, or showed signs that their revenues and profit might not be able to keep pace with recent growth. \nAmong the big winners were Netflix (NFLX) and PayPal (PYPL), while Fitbit (FIT) and Under Armour (UA) took it on the chin. Here’s our roundup of the Next 50 stocks that moved the most: Big Winners \n• Netflix tends to rise and fall based on how much its subscriber base grows each quarter. Shareholders got good news this time around. Netflix added way more subscribers than analysts expected, and that sent the stock up 19%. It was the big winner among the Next 50. \n• It didn’t matter than Shake Shack ’s earnings were just a hair above estimates. Investors cheered the company’s robust sales growth. Of course, a lot of this growth came from the company’s opening of new stores , but in a tough environment for restaurants these days, Shake Shack proved that not all is gloomy. Shares were up 11%. \n• Paypal Holdings is growing up and growing fast. The company split from eBay a year ago, and it’s doing just fine on its own. It processed 25% more in payments than it did a year ago, and shares rose 10% on the news. \n• Yelp released strong numbers related to its sales of local ads . Investors cheered that as well as the news that the company would be winding down its struggling international business. The stock was up 10%. \n• T-Mobile is benefiting as other carriers lose customers. T-Mobile added 850,000 subscribers last quarter, and that news sent the stock up 10%. Big Losers \n• Fitbit doesn’t think its holiday season will be stellar this year. Investors panicked, and the stock fell a whopping 34% after the company’s announcement. \n• TripAdvisor may need to start asking for better advice. The company has struggled to reconfigure its business around smartphones, and its revenue fell short of analysts’ estimates. This sent the stock down 17%. \n• Under Armour reported strong earnings, but the shares fell nonetheless. Some of the company’s long-term investments have stoked near-term concerns. Under Armour stock fell 13% . \n• More people are buying crafts on Etsy , the company announced, but investors see growth slowing. Plus the company’s CFO is stepping down soon. All this sent the stock down 13%. \n• Investors didn’t like the taste of Grubhub ’s third-quarter earnings. Even though earnings beat estimates, the fear of slowing growth hurt this stock as well. Shares of Grubhub tumbled 13%. The shares took another hit late last week after the CEO sent an e-mail to employees that suggested anyone who agrees with Donald Trump’s tendency to insult minorities should resign . \nMore from Barron's Next",

      "text": "11/15/16 AT 8:29 PM Close \nNetflix is one of the largest and most successful streaming services worldwide, and now it looks like it could be acquired by something bigger. The latest rumor going around is that Disney is considering buying the streaming giant. \nDisney has its sights on Netflix because its current ESPN subscriber numbers are declining and more people are now cutting cable subscriptions in favor of VOD streaming and other online subscription services. Another reason why Disney is considering to get Netflix is due to the $85 billion merger of AT&T and Time Warner, according to TechCrunch . \nNetflix surpassed Wall Street’s expectations when it reported that it has passed $2 billion in quarterly sales last month. The streaming giant also currently has a total of 3.57 million subscribers worldwide beating its 2.3 million forecast. Despite its huge success this year, its subscription-based business model might simply not be enough to sustain the company long term, and this is why it needs a buyer as of the moment, according to The Independent . Related Stories Why US Won't Get Netflix's Offline Viewing Mode \nIf Disney decides to buy the streaming service, it would help Netflix better compete with other companies that are able to generate revenue from multiple business models like AT&T, Amazon, Google, Verizon and Apple. Disney would also be able to gain a solid foothold on the over-the-top content market and gain access to Netflix’s invaluable data platform. \nA Disney acquisition would also open up the huge possibility that Netflix will become the only streaming service to exclusively deliver Disney-owned content. After all, Netflix already has exclusive Disney content thanks to the Marvel television series “Daredevil,” “Jessica Jones,” “Luke Cage” and the upcoming “Iron Fist” and “The Defenders.” \nThe addition of all of Disney’s content, including its library of animated films and “Star Wars,” would make Netflix far more appealing to customers. This would also help in combating AT&T's planned $35 a month DirectTV subscription service which will be able to offer live television channels. \nThe possible acquisition is also considered to be at the opportune time, given that Disney’s current CEO, Bob Iger, will be retiring in 2018. Disney has no current candidate to replace Iger yet, and it’s quite possible that the media giant is also eyeing Netflix CEO Reed Hastings for the job.

      "text": "\nGlitch only just recently arrived as a Netflix original series, but, already, viewers are asking when Season 2 will be released. So, here’s absolutely everything we know already about Season 2 of Glitch , its production details and when a trailer might be released.\nGlitch aired in Australia on their ABC network in 2015 and became a huge success locally. Then Netflix picked it up as one of their original series and now the world wants to know when Season 2 of Glitch will air on Netflix.\nFor those of you who haven’t seen Glitch already, the official synopsis for Season 1 is below.\n“When Sergeant Hayes is called to Yoorana cemetery in the middle of the night, he makes a discovery that turns his world upside down — six people with no memory of their identities. Who are they and what has happened to them?”\n[Image by ABC] Some are comparing Glitch to shows like Stranger Things with its supernatural theme. Others have added it to the zombie genre on account it deals with several dead characters who rise up from their graves. But Glitch is more detailed than that with an Australian flavor added into the mix.\nIt has just been recently confirmed by The Australian that Season 2 of Glitch will return to the ABC in Australia as well as being partnered as a Netflix original series in worldwide distribution. While no air date has been confirmed, NetflixLife has confirmed a 2017 release date is to be expected on Netflix. They also speculate that Season 2 of Glitch will air late in 2017 in much the same way Season 1 aired late in 2016.\nCurrently, production is underway for Season 2 of Glitch , which is being filmed in Australia across several locations. According to Deadline , Glitch will, once again , air on Australia’s ABC network and as a Netflix original series in 2017.\n[Image by ABC] Thanks to the collaboration between Netflix and Australia’s ABC network, a larger budget will be available for Season 2 of Glitch . Netflix traditionally finds around 15 percent of a television project in exchange for global subscription video-on-demand rights according to The Australian .\nSome Australian television executives and politicians are angered by Netflix’s involvement in the Australian production, citing the fact Netflix will not have to pay tax or employ locals. However, a spokesperson for the ABC issued the following statement in regard to Season 2 of Glitch .\n“As a result of Netflix’s involvement, there is more money being invested in Glitch to fully realise the creative aspiration of [Season] 2. The contribution from the ABC is lower, making the taxpayer dollar go further. Importantly, we also get to export great Australian drama to many countries around the world.”\nNetflix will be able to air each episode of Season 2 of Glitch globally as airs in Australia. However, in an effort to maintain the local success of Glitch in Australia, it will not be able to broadcast Glitch on the Australian version of Netflix until 12 months after it has aired on the ABC.\nCurrently, no trailer has been released yet for Season 2 of Glitch . However, with production currently underway, it is likely viewers will get to see a glimpse into Season 2 via a trailer before too long. In the meantime, here’s the official extended trailer for Season 1 of Glitch to remind you of why the series is so great.\nGlitch stars Patrick Brammall, Rodger Corser, Emma Booth, Emily Barclay, Genevieve O’Reilly, Andrew McFarlane, Daniela Farinacci, Sean Keenan and Ned Dennehy. Glitch was created by Tony Ayres and Louise Fox.\nThe series was filmed on location in Mt Alexander and Castlemaine, Australia. Glitch is a collaboration between ABC, Matchbox Pictures (which is a division of NBC Universal International Studios), and in association with Netflix’s original series.\nHave you watched Glitch yet? Are you looking forward to Season 2? Let us know your thoughts by commenting below.\nSeason 1 of Glitch on is currently airing worldwide on Netflix.\n[Featured Image by ABC]\nNetflix Original ‘Glitch’ Confirmed For Season 2, No Trailer Yet, But Production Is Currently Underway is an article from: The Inquisitr News \n",

      "text": "A man whose homicide conviction was overturned in a case profiled in the Netflix series \"Making a Murderer\" could be celebrating Thanksgiving at home with his family in Wisconsin after a judge Monday ordered him released from prison.\nBrendan Dassey's release was ordered by U.S. Magistrate Judge William Duffin even as prosecutors appeal the judge's earlier ruling overturning Dassey's conviction. It's not clear how quickly Dassey will be released. He faces a Tuesday deadline to provide information on where he will live and federal probation officers must also inspect the site before he is released. Wisconsin Attorney General Brad Schimel promised to file an emergency motion in the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to keep Dassey behind bars.\nDuffin ruled in August that investigators tricked Dassey into confessing he helped his uncle, Steven Avery, rape, kill and mutilate photographer Teresa Halbach at the Avery family salvage yard in Manitowoc County in 2005. Investigators allege Avery lured her there by asking her to take photos of a minivan.\nThe state has appealed that ruling and argued Dassey should remain in prison while it was pending.\nDassey was convicted of first-degree intentional homicide, second-degree sexual assault and mutilating a corpse. He was sentenced to life in prison in 2007. Court documents describe Dassey as a slow learner who had poor grades and has difficulty understanding language and speaking.\nIn his August ruling, Duffin said investigators made specific promises of leniency to Dassey and that no \"fair-minded jurists could disagree.\" Schimel, in his appeal, said investigators didn't promise leniency and they specifically told Dassey that no promises could be made.\nAttorneys are in the process of filing legal briefs in the appeal, which is expected to be argued sometime next year.\nWisconsin AG appeals overturned conviction of 'Making a Murderer' nephew Tribune news services Wisconsin's attorney general on Friday appealed the overturned conviction of a man accused of helping his uncle kill a woman in a case profiled in the popular Netflix series \"Making a Murderer.\"\nA federal magistrate judge ruled in August that investigators tricked Brendan Dassey into confessing...\nWisconsin's attorney general on Friday appealed the overturned conviction of a man accused of helping his uncle kill a woman in a case profiled in the popular Netflix series \"Making a Murderer.\"\nA federal magistrate judge ruled in August that investigators tricked Brendan Dassey into confessing...\n(Tribune news services) State prosecutors argued that in the meantime, Dassey should remain in prison because he's a serious threat to public safety. But Duffin in ordering Dassey set free cited his \"exceedingly benign\" prison disciplinary record and the fact that he had no convictions before the Halbach case.\nDassey, now 27, was 16 when Halbach was killed.\nThe judge ordered Dassey released as soon as the federal probation office approved where he was going to live and \"completed whatever additional investigation it deems necessary.\" Dassey's attorney, Steve Drizin, said he didn't know how long that would take but he hoped Dassey would be free by Thanksgiving, which was just 10 days away.\n\"That's what I'm focused on right now, getting him home, getting him with his family and then helping him to re-integrate back into society while his appeal plays out,\" Drizin said.\nDassey had until noon Tuesday to provide the federal probation and parole office with the address of where he plans to live. Drizin would not say exactly where Dassey would be living.\nGiven that his family lives in northeast Wisconsin, there is little chance Dassey will try to flee, the judge said. Under the judge's order, Dassey would be forbidden from having contact with Avery or Halbach's family.\nDassey's attorneys filed a motion seeking his release in September after Duffin overturned his conviction. That filing said Dassey had developed a plan with a social worker that calls for him to live initially with his mother in a family-owned trailer in rural northeastern Wisconsin about 100 miles from Manitowoc, arguing that would minimize the disruption for the community, Dassey and the Halbach family.\nThe plan calls for Dassey to later relocate to an apartment in Brown County that his mother and stepfather would rent for him. He would then start participating in educational and job training.\nMike Halbach, Teresa's brother, and Barb Janda, Dassey's mother, did not return calls for comment.\nDassey would have to meet numerous other conditions, including reporting to a probation officer, not owning a gun or other weapon, being available for home visits and getting approval before moving. Any travel outside of eastern Wisconsin would have to be approved by the court and Dassey could not get a passport.\nAvery was convicted in a separate trial and was also sentenced to life in prison. He's pursuing his own appeal.\nTheir cases gained national attention after Netflix aired \"Making a Murderer\" last year. The series spawned widespread conjecture about the pair's innocence. Authorities who worked on the cases said the series was biased, but it generated calls from the public to free both men.\nAssociated Press\n Trials and Arbitration Homicide Crime",

      "text": "Chelsea Handler hosted an emotional post-election episode of her Netflix show Chelsea on Wednesday.\n\"Obviously the result is not what I was hoping for,\" said Handler. \"Like a lot of people in this country, I'm sad, I'm disappointed and I'm confused. But if Hillary [Clinton] can make it through a concession speech, then I can make it through a stupid television show.\"\nHandler interviewed Sen. Barbara Boxer, who got choked up when talking about how she hasn't spoken to Clinton yet about her loss. Handler got emotional in response, saying, \"I know for a woman, as a woman it feels so sexist.\"\nShe started crying and said, \"I guess the message that I want to spread out to other women is exactly what you're saying, is not to give up. Sorry, I hate f - ing crying on camera.\"\nHandler continued, \"It's so easy to say throw in the towel and that we're going to leave or I'm going to move to Spain, because I want to move to Spain. I really, really want to move to Spain right now.\"\nBefore Trump's win, Handler had repeatedly talked about moving to her house in Spain should he become president. \"I did buy a house in another country just in case, so all of these people that threaten to leave the country and then don't - I will leave the country,\" she said this past May.\nHandler said that her co-workers have spoken to her about staying and using her platform instead. \"Everyone in my office is like, 'You have a responsibility, you have a voice and you need to use it, and you have to be here,'\" she said.\nThrough their disappointment, Handler and Boxer shared a message of hope and resilience. \"My heart is on the floor,\" admitted Boxer, but she said it's important to remember that a person is not defined by how he or she acts when in despair.\n\"It's not where you are when you're high and doing great; it's when you fall down,\" said Boxer, adding, \"A lot of us are on the ground right now.\"\nBoxer pointed out that Clinton won the popular vote and spoke about the complexity of the electoral college and what it would take to change it. She also Quote: d Martin Luther King Jr.'s words about the arc of history bending toward justice and the preamble to the Constitution discussing finding a more perfect union.\n\"When you say, 'I want to leave. I want to go,' of course - it's the flight syndrome,\" Boxer told Handler. \"That's just what the people who gave this hateful message want us to do, and we're not going to do it.\"\nRead more: Hillary Clinton Delivers Emotional, Inspiring Concession Speech: \"I'm Sorry\"",

      "text": "Netflix’s ‘The Crown’ Debut Ratings: Worse Than ‘Longmire,’ Better Than ‘Bloodline’ (Exclusive) More Netflix’s “The Crown” didn’t draw viewership worthy of a king, despite its reported palatial price tag.\nThe original series debuted to just 496,000 total viewers over its opening weekend, according to Symphony Advanced Media data that was provided exclusively to TheWrap. That places the premiere 26th out of the 35 originals measured by Symphony AM since the inception of its VideoPulse technology last year. “The Crown” fared better than “Bloodline” Season 2, but was worse than the fifth season of “Longmire” on Netflix.\nDue to the recent release of “The Crown,” Symphony’s Live + 3 day data is not completely stable yet and is subject to change slightly.\nAlso Read: 'Amanda Knox' Ratings Are No Killer on Netflix, Firm Says\nThe Season 1 debut of “Fuller House” (7.33 million) remains atop Symphony’s list, with runner-up “Orange Is the New Black” Season 4 (5.84 million) quite a ways behind it.\nIn third and fourth are two Marvel shows: “Luke Cage” and “Daredevil.” “Stranger Things” rounds out the top five.\nSymphony measures viewership through audio recognition software found in a panelist’s cell phone. The list also includes Hulu and Amazon series. Hulu first appears at No. 9 for the premiere of “11.22.63,” while Amazon’s “The Man in the High Castle” tops that platform at No. 22 overall.\nAlso Read: Meet the Man Who Thinks He Knows Netflix's Secret Ratings\nHere are some more unpopular debuts against which “The Crown” did worse: “The Ranch,” “The Path” and “Haters Back Off,” for example. It did, however, top “The Mindy Project” Seasons 4 and 5, and “Marco Polo,” among a handful of others.\nReaders are probably wondering which show measured by Symphony AM had the worst debut viewership. That unfortunate distinction belongs to Amazon’s “Catastrophe,” which only attracted 274,000 viewers over its first few days.\nCheck out the full Symphony rankings below. Netflix does not reveal viewership data. Executives at the streaming giant have denounced Symphony’s data as “remarkably inaccurate” in the past .\nAlso Read: Netflix Boss Ted Sarandos Still Insists Ratings Have 'No Relevance for Us'\n“The Crown” reportedly had a $130 million production budget, which would make it the most expensive TV show ever. Clearly, the returns on that investment have not been worthy of such royal treatment.\nWithout further adieu, here are the streaming originals’ viewership, ranked in descending order…\nRelated stories from TheWrap:\n'The Crown' Characters, Ranked From Worst to Best (Photos)\nNetflix's 'The Crown' Teaser Shows Claire Foy as Young Queen Elizabeth II (Video)\nMatt Smith, John Lithgow Officially Cast in Netflix Series 'The Crown'\nNetflix Orders Queen Elizabeth II Drama 'The Crown' from Peter Morgan, Stephen Daldry",

      "text": "Scripps Networks Interactive is ending its distribution deal with Netflix for shows like Food Network ’s “Cutthroat Kitchen” and HGTV ’s “House Hunters.”\nThe programmer “made the strategic decision not to extend our SVOD agreement with Netflix past the end of this year,” Scripps Networks Interactive COO Burton Jablin\nsaid on the company’s earnings call Monday. “In the end, it really is not the kind of dual-revenue model that best monetizes our content over the long term.”\nCEO Kenneth Lowe also on the call indicated that SNI felt it was forgoing advertising dollars with the Netflix deal: “We have such compelling content for advertisers that we just don’t want to really cut ourselves off from any opportunity.” But, Lowe added, “we gained a lot of internal knowledge on the digital side and on the best way to monetize this content, including the further expansion and development of our digital sales team.”\nNetflix declined to comment.\nNetflix currently offers U.S. subs access to past seasons of Food Network’s “Diners, Drive-ins and Dives,” “Food Network Star,” “Cupcake Wars,” “Chopped” and “Cutthroat Kitchen” (pictured above); HGTV’s “House Hunters,” “Property Brothers,” “Flip or Flop,” “Fixer Upper” and “Love it or List It”; Travel Channel’s “Man v. Food” and “Expedition Unknown”; and DIY Network’s “Kitchen Crashers.”\nSNI inked its pact with Netflix in the fall of 2014, after the programmer’s previous SVOD deal with Amazon Prime Video ended in March 2014 .\nScripps Networks Interactive has been active in licensing its programming to over-the-top players, including AT&T’s soon-to-launch DirecTV Now, Dish Network’s Sling TV, Sony’s PlayStation Vue and Verizon’s G090.\nRelated stories\nNetflix Acquires Global Rights to Korean Nuclear Disaster Film 'Pandora'\nNetflix Picks Up Israeli Political Thriller 'Fauda'\nNetflix Grabs SVOD Rights to 'Bellas de Noche'\nGet more from Variety and Variety411 : Follow us on Twitter , Facebook , Newsletter",

If we could bathe in the stuff like Cleopatra, we would ... and now we can . The Yunesson Spa Resort of Hakone, Japan offers the stuff of dreams — and by that, I obviously mean a giant outdoor pool filled with Merlot.\nRather than ask, um, why? the real question is: How do they get that much wine in a pool? By pouring it from a 12-foot-tall bottle, of course...\nGetty While there's definitely the novelty of diving head first into gallons of merlot, red wine also has a slew of anti-aging skin benefits — especially because it contains resveratrol, an antioxidant that stimulates cell proteins known as sirtuins, which promotes longer cell life in the body.\nGetty But if wine isn't your cup of tea, the Japanese spa theme park has a pool filled with that too, along with hot tubs of sake, ramen noodles, and coffee for your swimming pleasure.\nNow, ladies, if this doesn't warrant a girls' trip or a destination bachelorette party, I truly don't know what does...\nGetty\nFrom: Marie Claire\n ",

      "text": "Twitter questions Image via Netflix \nDuring a Q & A at a Real Steel IMAX screening, director Shawn Levy spoke to Collider’s Steve Weintraub about Stranger Things season two . Levy told the audience that he’ll be directing episodes 3 & 4 of season two, just like he directed episodes 3 & 4 of season one. Levy also said that season 2 will debut in 2017 as promised, but probably not until the end of the year. Levy added that season 2 will try and focus on a return to normalcy. \nIn an interview with ComicBook.com, actor Gabriel Luna who plays Robbie Reyes, aka Ghost Rider on Marvel’s Agents of SHIELD , told the site that there have been talks about a possible solo spinoff series . The actor said that there is definitely potential for this to actually happen. \nFormer boyband members, Donnie Wahlberg of New Kids on the Block and Nick Lachey of 98 Degrees are teaming up to produce Encore at CBS. The single-camera comedy revolves around a former boy band member and his life 20 years later with a family, real life and possibly reuniting the band. \nSUPERHERO RUNDOWN",

(Photo: Saeed Adyani, Netflix) \nIt’s not often you get a second chance to make a last impression. \nWell, if you assume this Netflix revival is the last we see of Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life (Nov. 25, *** 1/2 out of four), which these days in general — and with this show in particular — is probably unwise. \nWhen WB's cult hit ended in 2007, after one last, unsatisfying season on CW produced without creator Amy Sherman-Palladino and writer Daniel Palladino, most fans feared they'd seen the last of Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel as Lorelai and Rory Gilmore. Compounding the agony was a predominant — though hardly universal — feeling that the ending was unsatisfactory, a belief that has hardened with time into immutable truth. \nNow the show is back with four 90-minute episodes, each named for one of the seasons, and all of them written by the Palladinos. You get the same stars (for the most part) and the same rapid-fire, pop-culture-infused dialogue, in a more concise package that actually serves the show well. The pace and the arch theatricality of all that chatter could grow exhausting over 22 hours — a problem clearly lessened when you only have to listen for six. \nBrevity, however, is not the only advantage Girls has this time around. It benefits from having been gone long enough for many of us to miss it. And it returns, in all its dreamy, slightly loopy, generally optimistic lightness, at a time when many of us could use an escape, and TV could undoubtedly use a break from the grim, violent, conspiracy-laden dramas that currently dominate the landscape. \nGilmore Girls (Photo: Saeed Adyani, Netflix) \nOnce again, you’re following the Gilmores and their extended family — led by Lorelai’s on-again/off-again lover Luke (Scott Patterson) and her mother Emily (the always fabulous Kelly Bishop) — as they talk their way around the tourist trap that is Stars Hollow. Time has passed, and relationships have changed, but there’s nothing or no one fans won’t recognize and newcomers won’t be able to figure out. \nNot everyone was able to return, of course: the late Edward Herrmann is much missed, though his character, Richard, remains a heartwarming presence. A few other actors are either under- or overused: You get much less of Melissa McCarthy’s Sookie than most would like, and much more of Sean Gunn’s Kirk than some will like. But overall, the balance feels about right. \nAs always, Gilmore is not without its frustrations, which means that those who always found the constant babble and the flights of fancy unbearably twee will continue to do so. There are plots that just peter out, abruptly change course, or get lost in some eye-roll-inducing diversion. Even the combined gifts of Christian Borle and Sutton Foster can't quite excuse a musical sequence that defies belief and owes far too much to Christopher Guest's parody Waiting for Guffman and Borle’s own Something Rotten . \nYet for every misstep, there’s a moment from Graham or Bledel that makes you laugh or breaks your heart, or that cuts through the cuteness to ring absolutely true. And even at its most exasperating (as with those infamous “final four words”), there is so much talent and charm on display, you’re likely to be in a forgiving mood. \nSo welcome back, Girls . Here's hoping the wait for the next last episode is a shorter one. Facebook",

      "text": "Courtesy of U.S. Department of Defense November 16, 2016 | 12:51AM PT \nTOKYO — Netflix and Japan ’s public broadcaster NHK are partnering on a four-part historical drama to be broadcast next month. \nNHK will broadcast “ Tokyo Trials ” about the post-WWII court hearings of Japanese war criminals, on its terrestrial channel, while Netflix will stream it abroad. Then, after the NHK On-Demand VoD service has aired the series for a period, Netflix will also offer it to users in Japan. \nBoth companies contributed to the production costs, with NHK concluding co-production deals with L.A.- and Toronto-based Don Carmody Television and Amsterdam-based FATT Productions. Pieter Verhoeff and Rob King are the drama’s co-directors. \nAfter launching in Japan in the fall of 2015, Netflix has made shows with Japanese with broadcaster Fuji TV, talent agency Yoshimoto Kogyo, and ad agency Dentsu. For NHK, however, this sort of production and broadcast arrangement with Netflix is a first. Filed Under:",

      "text": "Jovi Figueroa \nReady for some new heavy Netflix binge watching? Here are the newest Netflix Original Series that will premiere this November. \nEver since the success of Netflix’ first original series, House of Cards, in 2013, Netflix has started to introduce a steady stream of phenomenal films and TV series. Orange is the New Black in 2013 has become quite a legend, too, as well as more recent Netflix Original Series Daredevil, Narcos, and Stranger Things. To date, Neflix reported to have over 86 millions paying subscribers in 190 countries. \nUnder the Netflix Originals, this year, The Hollywood Reporter reports that Netflix is releasing around 126 original film and television content. If you’re planning to start on something new this month, here is a list of Netflix Original Series that will premiere their first season this November. \nThe Crown \nThe Crown is Netflix’ new American-British original television series, which premiered its first season last November 4. The Crown, in 60 preliminary episodes over a span of six seasons, will follow the life of 25-year-old Queen Elizabeth II from her wedding in 1947 up to the present-day Queen Elizabeth. Just two weeks ago, the first ten episodes of the first season was released on Netflix for subscribers to check out and it’s looking quite a promising series. \n“No man should be punished for love…” #TheCrown pic.twitter.com/XFTLGgqUCR \n— The Crown (@TheCrownNetflix) November 8, 2016 \nIn fact, Inquisitr reported that Matt Smith, who plays Prince Phillip and Claire Foy, who plays a young Queen Elizabeth II, both confirmed that they have already been commissioned for a second season. Telegraph reported that the acquisition of The Crown’ s first 20 episodes alone has cost Netflix £100 million so the streaming service must have some immense amount of faith in the series. \nThe Crown is created and written by award-winning British film writer and playwright Peter Morgan, who has a extensive history in creating films and television series surrounding royalties such as King Ralph, The Queen, The Other Boleyn Girl, and Henry VIII. <noscript><iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/JWtnJjn6ng0?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></noscript> \n3% \n3% is a sci-fi thriller set in a dystopian world where only 3 percent of the current populace will be able to leave the devastated world and cross into the “better side.” The world is divided into to zones: Inland, where the majority of the populace reside and experience an extreme drought of energy, food, and water; and Mar Alto, the world of abundance (sounding like Hunger Games already?). When a person reaches the age of 20 in Inland, they get a chance to apply for the Process, where only 3 percent of the applicants pass and are transferred to Mar Alto. \nThe first season of Brazilian series 3% that will encompass eight episodes is coming to Netflix Original library on November 25. 3% is set on a fictional dystopian world [Image by Netflix] \nAcadamy Award-nominated Cesar Charlone, alongside Daina Giannecchini, Dani Libardi and Jotagá Crema are on top of the Netflix original 3% and have casted Bianca Comparato, João Miguel, and Mel Fronckowiak to play the roles of Michele, Ezequiel, and Julia. Netflix may be gambling a lot on this series as 3% is Netflix’ first series produced entirely in Brazil. While 3% only started filming earlier this year, The Verge reports, it’s amazing that the series is already shipping this November. <noscript><iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8yyzNQfaQR8?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></noscript> \nEstocolmo \nIf we’re talking countries represent, Netflix is also bringing this month Spanish series Estocolmo, which translates to English as “Stockholm.” Estocolmo revolves around the three characters Luciano, a prosecutor following a case of white trafficking; Estaban, an undercover agent; and Juana, a journalist that comes from a very influential family who tries to investigate and bring down the human trafficking ring. \nThe cast below shares a snapshot of the team watching the first season of Estocolmo. A photo posted by Esteban Lamothe (@estebanlamothe) on Nov 11, 2016 at 9:09pm PST \nEstocolmo started streaming on Netflix last November 11. \nTales by Light \nA collaborative effort by Canon Australia and National Geographic, new Netflix original entitled Tales by Light is a beautiful, photographic series that follows Art Wolfe, a nature and cultural photographer; Darren Jew, a nature and underwater photographer; Krystle Wright, an adventure sports photographer; Richard I’Anson, a travel photographer; and Peter Eastway, a landscape photographer. Tales by Light showcases the rich and stunning visual storytelling of these renowned Australian photographers and what goes on behind some of their biggest and most daunting projects. \nShot entirely in 4K, Tales by Light debuted its six-part season 1 last November 11 via Netflix. Digital Trends reports that a second season of Tales by Light is already in the works, however, Netflix has yet to announce a date. <noscript><iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/zmegZSlJX0M?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></noscript> \nParanoid \nIf you’re a fan of Sherlock Holmes, CSI, or True Detective, among many crime television series, you’ll be glad to know that Netflix, Deadline reports, is coming out with their own crime show entitled Paranoid. With season 1 streaming on Netflix this November 17, Paranoid will follow the investigation of a murder of a female doctor that happens right in front of her son. Dr. Angela Benton is gruesomely stabbed in the middle of the playground as she watches of over her son Luke and the investigation of the events will be led by seasoned detectives Bobby Day and Nina Suresh. And as the investigation deepens, Day and Suresh find themselves entangled in a larger scheme by bigger, global-scale enemy. \nAlready oozing with potential, Netflix original Paranoid is written by Bill Gallagher ( The Paradise ) and will star Kevin Doyle ( Downton Abbey ), Indira Varma ( Game Of Thrones ), and Robert Glenister ( The Musketeers ). <noscript><iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/VlbpSReb1ek?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></noscript> \nOther Netflix Original television series that premiered their season 1 on Netflix this November are World of Winx (November 4), Case (November 11), and Roman Empire: Reign of Blood (November 11). \nFor the full list of Netflix original television series and films streaming on Netflix this November, check out N4BB’ s list here . \n[Featured image by Netflix]",

      "text": "\nAnd that’s pretty much my sole criticism of Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life . \nI’ve seen all four 90-minute episodes of Netflix’s revival (which begins streaming on Friday, Nov. 25) and I’m here to assure you— one Gilmore acolyte to another — that it delivers. Holy hell , does it ever deliver. VIDEOS Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel Contemplate a Second Gilmore Revival \nSave for the aforementioned, somewhat bloated Stars Hollow: The Musical interlude in the third chapter, “Summer,” series creator Amy Sherman-Palladino and executive producer Daniel Palladino have given this grateful, longtime fan the satisfying conclusion he’s been waiting nearly a decade for. \nI’m sure you’re thinking: “Well, of course you’re going to say that. Not only are you in the thing , but you have the entire cast and crew on speed dial!” And to that I say, “You’re wrong. I do not have Sally Struthers’ telephone number.” (But I have a pending Facebook friend request I feel really good about.) Launch Gallery \nBut I get why one might call my journalistic objectivity into question. It’s one of the reasons I assigned TVLine’s formal revival review to my colleague Dave Nemetz. (Look for that later today.) \nHere’s the thing: I went into A Year in the Life with tempered expectations. After being burned by a number of recent revivals that should’ve been slam-dunks ( The X-Files , Arrested Development ), I was ready to have my heart shattered. And if that happened, I would find a way to break the news to you gently. But it didn’t. My expectations were wildly exceeded. And I believe yours will be, too. \nIf it’s mildly spoilery, semi-specifics you’re looking for, activate the gallery above — or click here for direct access — to read my breakdown of the 10 ways Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life delivered the proverbial goods.

      "text": "Why is Netflix Blocking VPN? Tuomas | November 11, 2016 0 Comment(s) \nSince this spring, online streaming service Netflix has actively started blocking users of all major VPN providers from watching their content. This blanket ban was met with an understandably negative backlash from customers, many pointing out that Netflix was now forcing them to put their security and privacy at risk to use their service. The question is, why are they doing this? \nNetflix simply caved under pressure from copyright holders (U.S TV networks and Hollywood studios), who operate with an outdated business model of selling distribution rights. Back in the day, only a handful of U.S networks and movie studios had the budgets and capability to make and market blockbuster entertainment. What made a successful show a goldmine for a network was not only domestic revenue, but the fact that it could be sold separately to TV networks in almost every country in the world. \nThis is because the market was fragmented, and people could only watch the show or movie on the one channel in their country that bought exclusive rights to it. Fast forward into the age of broadband, all this seems like ancient history. The change has been fast, as TV viewing among the age group 16-26 has dropped 25% since 2010. Even older generation X viewers aged 35-44 showed a 17% drop in watching traditional television. It’s clear that consumers of today want to watch their entertainment online, and they aren’t too happy about artificial borders being built on the internet. \nMajor industries reacting slowly to the digital revolution is nothing new, but content owners trying to get the best of both the golden age of TV (being able to sell content many times to different markets) and the convenience of an online streaming service is a just them having their cake and eating it too. It just doesn’t compute to watch your favorite TV show online, and then hop over a border and suddenly being blocked from seeing it. \nBeing kind of a jerk to your customers is one thing, but forcing them to risk their privacy and security to watch a TV show is unacceptable. Netflix has seemingly forgotten that a VPN is so much more than a way to appear as if you were in another country. \nFor instance, our own Freedome VPN encrypts your connection, blocks advertisers from tracking you as well as protects you from malicious websites. Blocking VPN on your service because it also lets people get around geo-blocks is like banning sunblock on a beach because there will be stains on your sand. \nThere are many players who share responsibility over this mess, but sadly it’s the privacy of end users that suffers. Netflix is between a rock and a hard place, but forcing their users to give up privacy to please those who produce their content should not be the way to go. \n",

      "text": "  07:35 AM EST Gundlach: Avoid Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google At All Costs \nIn his first webcast following last week’s shocking presidential election, fund manager Jeffrey Gundlach of DoubleLine Capital made a very bearish call on the group of so-called “FANG” stocks. \nIn case you’re unfamiliar, FANG is an acronym coined by TheStreet’s Jim Cramer a few years back that stands for Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, and Google — four of the biggest and best performing technology stocks over the past five years or so. Analysts and pundits like to group these companies together, despite the fact that they operate mostly in different businesses and their share prices aren’t really correlated. \nAnyway, Gundlach first noted that FANGs seemed to have predicted the result of the presidential election, rolling over about a week ahead of Donald Trump’s historic victory. Their downward slide has continued since the election as well, although yesterday saw a nice-sized bounce in all four names. \nAs for the future, Gundlach wouldn’t touch any of those names, echoing his comments to CNBC a few days ago: \nOn what to avoid on Trump’s election: “One thing about Trump’s win, there’s something about it [where] people just want something real. They want to see things being made. They want to see policies being changed … which means the financial engineering stocks and the momentum stocks, the FANGs, I would stay away from them in a big way.” \nLater he added, “I think the FANGs [stocks] are a bubble frankly.” \nGundlach believes the FANG names are still too expensive right now, and noted that the “fundamental machine” helping the companies disappeared over a week ago. \nOn what to avoid on Trump’s election: “One thing about Trump’s win, there’s something about it [where] people just want something real. They want to see things being made. They want to see policies being changed … which means the financial engineering stocks and the momentum stocks, the FANGs, I would stay away from them in a big way.” \nFacebook Inc ( NASDAQ:FB ) shares fell $0.42 (-0.36%) to $116.78 per share in premarket trading Wednesday. Year-to-date, FB has still gained 11.98%, but the stock is down more than 10% since the start of November. You are viewing an abbreviated republication of ETF Daily News content.

      "text": "'Gilmore Girls': Ranking the Townies \nRevival TV has been a dead-end affair in 2016. The X-Files was far from extraordinary. Fuller House was half-assed. But the report I bring you from the quirky-idyllic, speed-banter land of Stars Hollow is that the return of Gilmore Girls is winsome and riotous. It’s a better, bolder, more fulfilling capper to a beloved series that finished just-okay back in 2007, produced without creator Amy Sherman-Palladino and husband Daniel Palladino. But they’re back for this “special event series.” Listening to the rhythm, lilt, and inspired language of their dialogue is music to the ears — and in one hilarious passage, expresses in the form of an actual musical. It provides a welcome dose of hilarious and humane escapism that satisfies like a nostalgia trip even while subverting it. It tells a story about grief and change, rootlessness and restlessness. The show is basically a reboot about the struggle of rebooting. \nInspired by the Sherlock approach of mini-movies and taking a cue from the Carole King-penned theme song, Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life presents four super-sized, seasonally-themed installments: “Winter,” “Spring,” “Summer,” and “Fall.” I wouldn’t want to spoil much of the story even if I could: The Netflix spoiler guidelines are extensive and ridiculously severe. The surprising twists and turns of a meandering journey toward renewal are worth protecting and your discovery. I’d give a B+ to the collective whole, but I had distinct reactions to each installment: ‘Winter’ \nThe first episode, written and directed by Sherman-Palladino, reintroduces and resets Lorelai (Lauren Graham) and daughter Rory (Alexis Bledel) with a smartly staged sequence that allows the actors to yak their way back into their parts and find their legs. Literally. A conversation that begins at the gazebo in the town square turns into a long walk-and-talk, which allows Sherman-Palladino’s camera to roam and survey Stars Hollow with leisurely one-shot takes. The story is three-stage rocket blast. After 30 minutes of reorientation with Lorelai and Rory, “Winter” goes next-level with the arrival of Kelly Bishop — effortlessly reconnecting with Lorelai’s imperious mother Emily Gilmore — and then goes stratospheric when Liza Weil’s Paris shows up in the final act. She’s a firecracker. Sample line: “Don’t stand there shaking! Apologize to your parents. Tell them you’ll pay them back for the two semesters you spent studying Buffy the Vampire Slayer’s effect on the Feminist agenda!” \nThe fate of Richard Gilmore (Edward Herrmann, who died in 2014) catalyzes much of the plot. There’s a flashback sequence in “Winter” that’s quite poignant, and it also effectively recharges the testy, resentment-packed Emily-Lorelai relationship. The story honors Herrmann without sentimentalizing Richard, a complicated figure to Lorelai; a portrait of Richard that’s a beautiful gesture and hilarious sight gag symbolizes an attempt to do many things at once. \n“Winter” finds Lorelai and true love Luke (Scott Patterson) — yep, still together — fighting losing battles with changing times and adapting to them, or not. The Dragonfly Inn is at a crossroads, and Lorelai resents it, but her resistance to make decisions about how to move forward is stressing out everyone, especially Michel (Yanic Truesdale). Over at the diner, Luke scraps with a new generation of customer: malingerers with laptops looking to mooch free Wi-Fi. He tries to chase them away with bogus, insulting passwords. And at home, Lorelai and Luke, binge TV watchers like the rest of us, find themselves unable to keep up with #PeakTV. \nRELATED: Gilmore Girls Revival: See Stars’ Photos From the Set \nRory might be the most difficult character to set up, per spoiler rules. She’s trying to build her career as a journalist, and she’s makes a risky choice to live rootless and with few attachments that complicates her pursuits of personal and professional happiness. She’s depicted as being extremely talented at what she does, yet weirdly unable to make a living at it given that talent. I can tell fans that Rory’s three major love interests all return (Jared Padalecki’s Dean, Milo Ventimiglia’s Jess, Matt Czuchry’s Logan), and that Rory’s situation with Logan, which the revival hits first, is unconventional and complex. Does he represent the future, or is he baggage from the past that must be dropped? \nGilmore Girls has a wealth of supporting and minor players, and the episodes use all of them very well, though not all at once, and not all the time. “Winter” dotes on Kirk (Sean Gunn) and Taylor (Michael Winters) in particular. (Get ready for Kirk’s latest nutty scheme: a car service called “Ooober.” I’ll let him explain how it’s different from Uber.) And as usual, there’s an abundance of entertaining references and sly pop commentary in the writing. Here’s Lorelai on one of Rory’s friends: “He’s like a superhero, but his power is that you can’t remember him no matter how much time you spend with him, kind of like every Marvel movie ever.” “Winter” grade: B+ \nRELATED: Gilmore Girls : Exclusive First Look Inside Stars Hollow ‘Spring’ \nWritten and directed by Daniel Palladino, “Spring” is perhaps the least of the four. Lorelai and Emily begin seeing a therapist together – a storyline that produces some fun individual moments but doesn’t add up to much. It’s most entertaining when Rory and Paris make a return visit to their elite high school, Chilton Preparatory Academy. A scene in which Paris melts down in a bathroom is one of the highlights of the entire series. One flaw of each 90-minute (or so) installment: a tendency to let scenes go on too long. Still, many choices pay off with marvelously zany set pieces. In “Spring,” Stars Hollow gathers to watch Kirk’s second film, a hilariously bad, pretentiously arty, self-indulgent mess that pays homage to David Lynch’s Eraserhead , a cult classic considered by some to be a masterpiece and considered by others to be… well, a hilariously bad, pretentiously art, self-indulgent mess. \n“Spring” also pushes the revival’s least successful satirical gambit, skewering those damn millennials and their phones, media, and entitled, touchy attitudes. Rory is used to reflect and judge her generation, to mixed results. She makes a choice at the end of “Spring” that serves the drama, as it keeps her in Stars Hollow, but I’m not sure it makes sense for her character. In general, I think the revival could have been smarter about dramatizing her life stage issues and the travails of the 21st century thirty-something. “Spring” grade: B ‘Summer’ \nThis is the one with the musical, and it’s a showstopper in two ways: it’s hilarious; and it goes on for awhile. I was massively entertained, but it turns the characters into spectators, and it struggles to integrate Lorelai’s negative reaction to the production, which I didn’t buy. This episode escalates what you might call a midlife crisis for Lorelai, a wrestle with identity I found credible but not all that compelling. What I loved about this “Summer” — and the musical nurtures this — is how every character, every location, and every little detail contributes to a vivid sense of place; in truth, Stars Hollow might be the revival’s best character, and I love the effort to explore every nook and cranny of it, from a scene involving an after-hours secret to a sequence in which Lorelai and Rory deliver newspapers. More #PeakTV shout-outs in this episode: The Returned, Halt and Catch Fire . And the moment when Carole King, who plays Sophie Bloom, launches into “I Feel The Earth Move” — and no one recognizes the tune — left me giggling and alarmed. Does Carole King not exist in the GilmoreGirlsVerse? I never realized that. This is terrible! “Summer” grade: B+ ‘Fall’ \nWritten and directed by Sherman-Palladino, “Fall” is the episode that I enjoyed the least while watching but admired the most in retrospect. The first half sends Lorelai and Rory on separate solo adventures to address crucial issues that are nagging at them. The tales are offbeat (one of them is inspired by the Cheryl Strayed book/Reese Witherspoon movie Wild and involves multiple, somewhat distracting star cameos) and the storytelling is slightly surreal. One of them might even be a dream sequence. But once the story settles back into Stars Hollow, the episode begins gathering power toward satisfying conclusions that feel totally correct for everyone. It gives you an eagerly anticipated character moment in a sweet scene that affirms the incredible talent of [SPOILER DELETED]. And you get the legendary final four words . They might inspire want for another set of episodes ASAP, but as I imagined what that story might be, I found myself content with letting that story be just that: something that unspools only in our imagination. Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life feels like a summary statement about the characters and their relationship to each other, even as it ends on a note that says nothing ever ends or fully resolves, not really. Life goes on, circumstances will change (or won’t), and we all have to figure out how to keep loving each other better, no matter what happens next. I don’t need another Year in the Life to know if the Gilmore girls and the good people of Stars Hollow will rise to that challenge. But if Sherman-Palladino leads with more, I will follow. “Fall” grade: B \nSeries grade: B+ ",

      "text": "November 16, 2016 at 09:00 AM EST Netflix And...Mom? \nBEVERLY HILLS, Calif. , Nov. 16, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- With the return of Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life, Netflix is giving mothers and daughters another way to bond. A recent survey revealed more than half of women (53%) wish they spoke to their mother more often. On November 25 , fans all over the world can reconnect through the mother of all TV shows...because even reading this release will make you realize how much you want to call your mom. \nMore than half of mother-daughter duos surveyed (59%) report that post-show discussions are the best part of sharing a show together. In fact, watching together is so important that despite the distance, almost half of moms and daughters (41%) think watching together brings them closer. Even though one third of moms and daughters surveyed live thirty or more minutes apart, over half have gone out of their way to physically watch together on many occasions. \nThe ultimate mother-daughter pair, Rory and Lorelai, know the benefits of sharing show-inspired inside jokes and witty one-liners. Whether you and mom are die-hard fans or looking for your next binge together, Netflix is letting you send an invite for Date Night with Mom . \nNo matter what kind of mother-daughter relationship it is, Gilmore has something for you. The survey found that globally, almost equal portions of mother-daughter relationships fall into the following three groups: 39% of respondents say they're two peas in a pod, and are BFFs like Rory and Lorelai . 31% say they may be polar opposites like Lane and Mrs. Kim , but they just want what's best for each other. 30% know it can be complicated like Lorelai and Emily , but they can't imagine life without each other. \nAbout Netflix Netflix ( NASDAQ:NFLX ) is the world's leading Internet television network with over 86 million members in over 190 countries enjoying more than 125 million hours of TV shows and movies per day, including original series, documentaries and feature films.
