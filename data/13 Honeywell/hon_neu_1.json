      "text": "E-Compass Market - Analysis, Technologies & Forecasts to 2022 - Key Players are Honeywell, Bosch & Oceanserver Technologies - Research and Markets November 10, 2016 12:27 PM Eastern Standard Time \nDUBLIN--( BUSINESS WIRE )-- Research and Markets has announced the addition of the \"E-Compass Market - Global Forecast to 2022\" report to their offering. \nThe adoption of e-compass sensors in the consumer electronics products such as smartphones, tablets and wearables would drive the e-compass market. \nThe e-compass sensors are a ready fit to the navigation systems installed in the portable electronic products. The miniaturization of the sensor packages to be efficiently integrated into the portable electronics products has significantly boosted the market growth in the recent times. The growth in consumption of wearable electronic devices would drive the market in coming years. \nThe major restraint for e-compass is the presence of GPS technology as a substitute for the similar applications related with navigation. Large number of equipment these days have integrated GPS technology and as GPS technology can also be used as a navigating compass wherever the GPS signals are present, many device makers do not see the need to add additional hardware for e-compass. \nAPAC market for e-compass sensors to grow at the highest rate during the forecast period. The APAC region is expected to grow at the highest CAGR for e-compass market. A number of major consumer electronics manufactures are based out of the region. Moreover, the demand for directional sensors in consumer electronics is increasing steadily. These factors collude to make APAC a fast growing market for e-compass sensors. \nCompanies Mentioned:",

      "text": "News Feed Item E-Compass Market - Analysis, Technologies & Forecasts to 2022 - Key Players are Honeywell, Bosch & Oceanserver Technologies - Research and Markets November 10, 2016 12:27 PM EST Blog This \nResearch and Markets has announced the addition of the \"E-Compass Market - Global Forecast to 2022\" report to their offering. \nThe adoption of e-compass sensors in the consumer electronics products such as smartphones, tablets and wearables would drive the e-compass market. \nThe e-compass sensors are a ready fit to the navigation systems installed in the portable electronic products. The miniaturization of the sensor packages to be efficiently integrated into the portable electronics products has significantly boosted the market growth in the recent times. The growth in consumption of wearable electronic devices would drive the market in coming years. \nThe major restraint for e-compass is the presence of GPS technology as a substitute for the similar applications related with navigation. Large number of equipment these days have integrated GPS technology and as GPS technology can also be used as a navigating compass wherever the GPS signals are present, many device makers do not see the need to add additional hardware for e-compass. \nAPAC market for e-compass sensors to grow at the highest rate during the forecast period. The APAC region is expected to grow at the highest CAGR for e-compass market. A number of major consumer electronics manufactures are based out of the region. Moreover, the demand for directional sensors in consumer electronics is increasing steadily. These factors collude to make APAC a fast growing market for e-compass sensors. \nCompanies Mentioned:",

      "text": "Buy Now Robert Franklin, South Bend Tribune \nMembers of United Auto Workers Local 9 hold signs earlier this year to protest a labor dispute at the Honeywell Aerospace plant in South Bend. Tribune File Photo featured Union workers vote to reject Honeywell contract 6-month lockout, negotiations continue Buy Now Robert Franklin, South Bend Tribune \nMembers of United Auto Workers Local 9 hold signs earlier this year to protest a labor dispute at the Honeywell Aerospace plant in South Bend. Tribune File Photo \nMembers of the United Auto Workers Local 9 union will still not be returning to work at Honeywell Aerospace. Saturday, union members voted not to accept a new five-year contract proposed by Honeywell. \nThis move continues a six-month lockout, which began in May after union members rejected the original contract. The rejection of this revised contract was expected. Union members have been vocal about their concerns and many said last week they would likely vote against it. \nFor the contract to be approved, a majority vote was needed from the Local 9’s members, as well as UAW members from Honeywell’s plant in Green Island, N.Y., who are also covered under the contract. Local union members had from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. Saturday to vote, and a vote was also held in Green Island. \nAt the Local 9, 184 members voted not to accept the contract with 82 voting in approval. In Green Island, six voted against the contract with 30 in support, brining the total to 190-112. \n“We’ve been out here for too long to cave for something like this,” said UAW member Tom Simpson, who was at a picket post this week outside the South Bend plant. \nChanges in the new proposal were health-care related. It would have guaranteed weekly premiums for health and dental insurance would not increase by more than 15 percent per year. Honeywell would also have contributed more to employees’ health savings accounts to offset health care costs. \nDuring negotiations, though, Honeywell said these changes would be rescinded if the union rejected the contract. \n“We are disappointed UAW members rejected our contract proposal. It included wage increases over the term of the contract and would have aligned them with benefits other U.S. unions within Honeywell have currently,” Scott Sayres, a spokesman for Honeywell, said in a statement. \nBut UAW members were too concerned about other parts of the proposal that included changes to overtime eligibility, the removal of paid absence allowance days to curb absenteeism, and the freezing of contributions to a long-standing “legacy” pension plan. \n“If they really want us back to work, I think they could have come up with more than they did and helped us in other areas of the contract to offset costs,” Todd Treder, vice president of Local 9, said. \nTreder said the vote could have been blocked, but the members deserved the right to vote. Because unemployment insurance will expire later this month, he said, members should have the option to decide what happens. \nIn the statement from Honeywell, Sayres said contract negotiations will continue, but no further sessions have been scheduled at this time. \n“We listened to the union and made substantial moves on healthcare to try and reach an agreement,” Sayres said in the statement. “We want our employees back at work and we will continue to bargain in good faith to reach a comprehensive agreement to make that happen.” \nTribune staff writer Ted Booker contributed to this report. \n574-235-6324",

      "text": "honeywell vector occupant app More Anyone who works in a shared office space knows all too well the small challenges that comes with large complex spaces. From maintaining the perfect temperature in your workspace to accessing various secure portions of said workspace, a lot of otherwise productive time can be spent finding ways to mitigate these tasks.\nImagine the hassle of coming to work only to discover you have forgotten your personalized security access card. You then must either return home to retrieve the card or seek out someone who can replace it.\nHoneywell, a leader in innovative smart technologies, has come up with a quick solution. The Honeywell Vector Occupant app syncs with a building’s smart systems so that occupants can simply use their smart phone.\nJohn Rajchert, the president of Honeywell Building Solutions, stated, “Smartphones and apps continue to enhance our lives. Buildings are alive and teeming with opportunities for users to interact with them — if you can make the right connections.”\nMore: Smart home cost of entry dipped with Honeywell Lyric T5 Smart Thermostat\ndigital-id-and-access-control-13-hr More Its new app is making just those connections. It allows for individualized identification which eliminates the need for special badges or fobs to move about the building. Because everything is digital, management can easily oversee credentials of all the buildings occupants. Imagine never needing to replace a security card again.\nFinally, since the app is intended to interface directly with the building, maintenance staff can monitor occupants comfort levels in real time. Employees can quickly and easily report a problem with the temperature of their workspace directly through the app.\nThe app works independently of the buildings underlying systems which makes it widely accessible and easy to adapt to your current system. The entire program is backed by a cloud-based architecture and enabled by HID Global’s Seos credential technology. All users must be invited by an administrator before downloading and using the app.\nThe Honeywell Vector Occupant app is designed to make buildings more secure and more comfortable for the people who work and visit them. The company is always expanding and improving so who knows what’s in store next for building connectivity.\nThe best smart thermostat you can buy The best biking gear of 2016 Smart home cost of entry dipped with Honeywell Lyric T5 Smart Thermostat",

We expect, Asia-Pacific will hold major share in the market followed by North America and Europe. \nComposite Metal Finishing, is mixture of inorganic and organic metal finishing techniques. The prime advantage of this metal finishing technique is that it enhances the functional properties such as corrosion resistance, wear resistance, and tensile strength. This type of coating is applied by spraying the mixture over base metal. \nIn terms of technology, electroless plating dominated the market in 2015, as it helps in saving electricity, ensures flexibility in plating thickness, and aids in coating blind holes. In terms of fillers used in the metal finishing process, boron nitride and PTFE dominated the market in terms of volume. \nThe growing popularity of the electroless nickel composite coating is one of the major driver boosting the growth of the market. The technique offers various advantages such as cost and energy savings, automatic monitoring of chemical replenishment, semi-bright, matte, and bright finishing can be attained, and aids in plating blind holes with stable thickness. \nIn terms of geography, Asia-Pacific dominated the market in 2015, followed by North America. Some of the major players dominating the market are namely, Abakan Inc., Honeywell International Inc., Surface Technology, and Micro Plating Inc. \nReport Structure: \n2.

The report forecasts the global knee pad market to grow at a CAGR of 4.55% during the period 2016-2020. Vendors are now focusing on developing self-adjusting knee pads, which do not dislocate with change in activities, nor do they require frequent manual adjustments. In addition, the efficacy of these knee pads is not affected by factors such as sweat or movement. According to the report, rise in demand for neoprene knee pads to drive growth in the global knee pad market. Neoprene is a synthetic rubber composed of polymerized chloroprene, which possesses good chemical stability and sustains flexibility over a wide temperature range. In addition, neoprene is a breathable material that also enables easy evaporation of sweat, making it comfortable. In terms of physical composition, neoprene offers strength and durability. Further, the report states that industrial end-users such as construction workers, carpenters, welders, flooring workers, and railroad workers require knee pads for long periods of kneeling activities. However, usage of knee pads for different tasks can change their positioning, leading to inefficiency of the worker as it would require continuous adjustments. Moreover, the clips and straps provided with the knee pads become loose after long use, which can also affect the positioning and therefore the effectiveness of knee pads. Key vendors:",

      "text": " Research and Markets\nDUBLIN , Dec\nResearch and Markets has announced the addition of the \"Global Knee Pad Market 2016-2020\" report to their offering.\nThe report forecasts the global knee pad market to grow at a CAGR of 4.55% during the period 2016-2020.\nVendors are now focusing on developing self-adjusting knee pads, which do not dislocate with change in activities, nor do they require frequent manual adjustments. In addition, the efficacy of these knee pads is not affected by factors such as sweat or movement.\nAccording to the report, rise in demand for neoprene knee pads to drive growth in the global knee pad market. Neoprene is a synthetic rubber composed of polymerized chloroprene, which possesses good chemical stability and sustains flexibility over a wide temperature range. In addition, neoprene is a breathable material that also enables easy evaporation of sweat, making it comfortable. In terms of physical composition, neoprene offers strength and durability.\nFurther, the report states that industrial end-users such as construction workers, carpenters, welders, flooring workers, and railroad workers require knee pads for long periods of kneeling activities. However, usage of knee pads for different tasks can change their positioning, leading to inefficiency of the worker as it would require continuous adjustments. Moreover, the clips and straps provided with the knee pads become loose after long use, which can also affect the positioning and therefore the effectiveness of knee pads.\nKey vendors:\nHoneywell Ergodyne Nike McDavid Key Topics Covered:\nPart 01: Executive summary\nPart 02: Scope of the report\nPart 03: Market research methodology\nPart 04: Introduction\nPart 05: Global knee pad market\nPart 06: Market segmentation by end-user\nPart 07: Geographical segmentation\nPart 08: Market drivers\nPart 09: Impact of drivers\nPart 10: Market challenges\nPart 11: Impact of drivers and challenges\nPart 12: Market trends\nPart 13: Vendor landscape\nPart 14: Key vendor analysis\nPart 15: Appendix\nFor more information about this report visit http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/gm29c5/global_knee_pad\nMedia Contact:\nResearch and Markets\nLaura Wood , Senior Manager\npress@researchandmarkets.com\nFor E.S.T Office Hours Call +1-917-300-0470\nFor U.S./CAN Toll Free Call +1-800-526-8630\nFor GMT Office Hours Call +353-1-416-8900\nU.S. Fax: 646-607-1907\nFax (outside U.S.): +353-1-481-1716\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/research-and-markets---global-knee-pad-market-growth-of-4-cagr---analysis-technologies--forecasts-to-2020---key-vendors-are-honeywell-ergodyne--nike-300374424.html\n ",
