LIKE MORE Posted 9 minutes ago by iClarified · 534 views · Translate Apple is planning to release new models of the iPhone next year that have the same design as the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, according to a new Macotakara report.The new models will allegedly use the A11 chip, will not have wireless charging, and will come in red. According to the information source in the supplier in Taiwan, they said the new model of iPhone launched in 2017 would be iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus which are the updated version of iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. They say that the basic design remains the same, and that the update is only the change of the CPU to A11 chip, and it does not seem to come together with either the wireless charge or glass chassis. And, it would highly probably that the color in Red would be added in the color line up. It's been widely rumored that Apple plans to release three new iPhone models next year, one of which is said to be a massive redesign to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the iPhone. However, earlier reports suggested that the other two models would have wireless charging and an all glass casing .",

      "text": "Mobile payments just can’t catch a break.\nAt first, a long lag was created when Apple held off adopting near field communication technology until its later models, when it finally introduced Apple Pay.\nThen the market had to wait for retailers to purchase and install checkout terminals that could handle mobile payments, both from Apple and Android phones.\nThe eventual implementation of EMV terminals to handle new credit card with embedded hips in the U.S. helped that along, since those new terminals generally also are capable of accepting mobile payments.\nThe long-awaited mega-mobile payments venture, promising its own mobile payment scheme for major retail members including Walmart, Target, Best Buy and pretty much every other major retail brand, finally gave up, shutting down back in May.\nRetailers then started to go-it-alone, incorporating payment capabilities inside their own apps.\nThis year, 38 million Americans will have used their mobile phones to pay at the point of sale at least once, according to eMarketer. While a big number, it’s far from mass adoption.\nNow a new study by Capital One suggests that mobile wallet adoption may be gaining a little speed.\nAbout a quarter (24%) of consumers are now using mobile wallets in some capacity, based on the Capital One wallet survey of 1,800 consumers.\nBut it’s not like this has become a totally ingrained behavior, since most (63%) have been using mobile wallets for less than a year.\nOn the plus side, nearly half (49%) of mobile wallet users plan to make at least one gift purchase on mobile during the holiday shopping season. This despite that more than half (54%) of those mobile wallet consumers are concerned about credit card fraud.\nThey should have reason to be concerned: more than 43% of them have at one point or another had a charge come through that surprised them or was for the wrong amount. This is hardly a good thing to push mobile payments along.\nMobile payments aren’t restricted to retail stores, though that is the most frequently tapped location, based on the survey. Here’s where consumers use mobile payments:\n49% -- Retail stores 41% -- Grocery stores 37% -- Fast food 27% -- Drug stores or for travel-related purchases It’s not only consumer attitudes or behaviors holding mobile payments back. More than two thirds (70%) of those who use mobile wallets said they would use them more if more merchants were equipped to let them pay that way.\nAnd just as mobile payments seem to get a slight bit of steam, Amazon comes along with a new way to get in and out of a store without needing any point-of-sale terminal to interact with on the way out.\nThe new Amazon Go being launched involves a system that detects when items are taken off a shelf by a shopper with the person’s Amazon account being charged as soon as they leave the store.\nIn that case, mobile payment essentially vanishes, since the transaction is all handled behind the scenes, just like in Amazon’s one-touch purchasing.\nSo much for mobile payments evolving from point A to B to C.",

      "text": "print The iPhone 7. AP \nWhen it was first rumored that Apple would omit the headphone jack from the iPhone 7 , it kicked off a months-long wave of online furor. \nWhen Apple actually went and did it , citing “courage” as the big reason for its decision, that outrage only intensified, and more words were written about dongles than have probably been written in years. \nAfter a few months of the iPhone 7 being on the market, though, it turns out all that anger didn’t really mean much. \nAt least, that’s according to market research firm Kantar Worldpanel, whose latest quarterly report says “the lack of the headphone jack has proved to be a non-issue for US iPhone consumers,” given that the iPhone 7 was the top-selling phone in the country in the three months ending October 2016. That was reportedly good for 10.6% of US phone sales over that time. \nThe iPhone 7 Plus, meanwhile, is said to have been the fourth highest-selling phone in the US over the period, with 5.3% of sales. The iPhone 6s and Samsung Galaxy S7 were second and third, respectively. \nHollis Johnson/Business Insider In general, Kantar says the iPhone’s market share rose from 33.5% to 40.5% in the US year-over-year. That 7% raise is said to put iOS at its highest point in the US since January 2015.\nWorldwide, Kantar says that iOS saw yearly gains in most regions — save Germany and Urban China — but that Android, unsurprisingly, remains the dominant platform overall, with its only significant declines coming in the US, where premium phone sales are more prevalent. \nOther noteworthy findings include Google’s Pixel phones grabbing 0.5% of the US market, bringing it in line with the likes of Huawei and Microsoft, despite releasing at the tail end of October. \nThe iPhone 7 (left) and iPhone 6s (right). Austin Evans/YouTube \nThough Kantar doesn’t explicitly say why the iPhone saw such gains in the US, the debacle with Samsung's Galaxy Note 7 likely left a big gap for Apple to fill. \nIn any case, while those who railed against the removal of the headphone jack aren’t necessarily wrong — Bluetooth headphones tend to cost more and sound worse — it seems like most people are loyal enough to the iPhone brand to live with an adapter, or pay for a newer type of technology.",

      "text": "It might not be tomorrow. It might not even be five years from now. But some day, Apple's iOS platform will support home screen widgets. Apple's unique iOS widget implementation is thought of by some as offering the best of both worlds. Widget support is there and it's somewhat versatile, but widgets are buried off screen, forcing users to swipe to the right on either the lock screen or the first home screen in order to access the widget pane. On one hand, this allows iOS to support widgets without causing a big drain on the battery. On the other, it means zero-touch access to information, which is arguably the best thing about mobile widgets, is not possible.\nSince iOS 10 widgets are hidden off screen, many people don't even both using the feature. But we're here to tell you that it's time to give widgets another shot on your iPhone — and in this post, we'll show you 10 iOS 10 widgets that should be installed on every iPhone.\nContinue reading... \nTrending right now: \nPokemon Go just got a new update, but it’s not the exciting release you wanted Amazon’s 15 best daily deals: COD Infinite Warfare, Fitbit Alta, waterproof wireless earbuds, more Trump might move iPhone manufacturing to America after all ",

      "text": "While Apple is busy bragging about the relatively rapid US retail expansion of its proprietary digital wallet solution, and Samsung inexplicably continues to struggle convincing even British banks to support its NFC and MST-enabled mobile payment service, Google quietly ramps up Android Pay’s global reach.\nAvailable exclusively on American shores until not that long ago, the universal Android 4.4 and up-compatible e-money app very quickly expanded to the UK , Singapore , Australia , Poland , Hong Kong , New Zealand and today, Ireland.\nYes, the same Ireland where neither Apple Pay, nor Samsung Pay are accessible at the moment. And yes, one major local financial institution (AIB), and a smaller Irish banking player (KBC) are already in Big G’s corner when it comes to blazing fast, perfectly secure smartphone shopping.\nYou can use both Mastercard and Visa credit and debit cards issued by the aforementioned companies at physical stores and restaurants including Boots, Eason, KFC, McDonald’s and SPAR locations, plus in apps like Adverts.ie, Deliveroo and Uber, with “many more” obviously to come. More banks, more shops, and more apps. Maybe even crackers , freebies and other incentives.\nOne thing Android Pay doesn’t need to drive adoption in Ireland and the world over is convenience. Just tap and pay. What could be more convenient?\nThe post Google beats both Apple and Samsung to the Ireland punch with local Android Pay debut appeared first on Pocketnow .\n",

      "text": "Music (Shutterstock photo)\nThink about the last time you actually bought a DVD or a Blu-Ray. Chances are, those purchases are in decline, if you haven't already stopped buying them altogether. For example, you can stream movies on Netflix ( NFLX ), Prime Instant Video, or HBO Go. If you wanted to buy/rent a specific movie, you can download it from Amazon, iTunes, or Google Play.\nBuying and owning CDs and most other physical kinds of music (with the exception of records, which have been making a comeback in niche groups) are the also way of the past and streaming is the way of the future. Technology has changed the way we listen to music. For Apple ( AAPL ), Amazon ( AMZN ), and Spotify, it's become a big business and it's poised to get even bigger.\nApple Music announced on Tuesday it surpassed 20 million paying subscribers, up 15% over the past months. That's a huge increase for such a short period of time, and shows that Apple's latest efforts are working, including providing exclusive content from artists such as Frank Ocean and redesigning its interface, making it easier to use.\nAs part of Apple's Services business, Apple Music is helping the company diversify its revenue streams away from being hardware-centric. It's the fastest-growing part of Apple's business, growing 24% year over year to $6.3 billion in the most recent quarter .\nMeanwhile, Spotify now has over 40 million subscribers, and is working its way towards going public next year, based solely off a streaming business. While we don't have the exact figures yet on just how profitable and healthy the company is, it's a good bet the company wouldn't be thinking about going public if it didn't believe in the future of streaming.\nFor Amazon, it's another hook to keep people spending $99 a year on Prime. There are an estimated 50 million Prime users, and they spend roughly three to four times more shopping on Amazon than non-Prime users do, so it's important that Amazon continue to invest in building out Prime. Amazon also recently launched Amazon Music Unlimited as a separate service outside of Prime, showing just how important streaming music is not just as a business, but as a medium.\nThere's still a huge opportunity for these companies, as the combined 100 million or so subscribers of various music streaming services is just a small fraction of people listening to music around the world. With that, it's a big opportunity for investors as well, particularly for those who are looking for tech companies to deliver strong revenue growth. A service like streaming music might just do that for those companies.\nIt's easier now than ever to listen to your favorite songs and artists on a number of devices, from your phone to your smart TV to your smart speakers, and these companies hope to profit off that experience.\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.",

      "text": "iPhones are catching fire, Apple responds Is Apple facing some sort of Galaxy Note 7 situation of its own? The BBC said this week that as many as eight different reports have suggested iPhones are spontaneously catching fire in China. The iPhone 6 appears to be the problem device, suggesting that battery issues related to the iPhone 6s arent the only problem Apple is facing right now. Apple acknowledged the issue in China and said that external factors are responsible for the iPhone 6 fires. In other words, unlike the Galaxy Note 7, Apple believes that its iPhones arent the units at fault but, instead, its something else causing the problem. It could be that the iPhone owners accidentally dropped their devices, causing some sort of internal malfunction, or are using dangerous parts like third-party chargers that are causing the fires. We treat safety as a top priority and have found no cause for concern with these products, Apple said. Still, the issues have caused enough problems that the Shanghai Consumer Council is getting involved and looking for answers. Additionally, it appears that Apples iPhone 6s woes have spread to China, too, where users are also complaining of problems related to the device shutting down when the battery still shows a 30 percent charge. Apple responded to that problem last week, noting that it, too, isnt a safety concern and is indeed a feature of the iPhone meant to automatically shut it down. Apple says there is a small batch of iPhone 6s units experiencing the issue, though it appears to be widespread enough that its now planning to roll out diagnostic tools in an update due sometime next week to help it better identify the problem. Users affected by that issue can have their batteries replaced at no charge.",

      "text": "Apple acknowledges Apple Music now includes ‘all the benefits of iTunes Match’ By Jesse Hollington @jhollington ● 41   quietly made a change to its Apple Music Membership FAQ , explaining that Apple Music members no longer need to subscribe separately to iTunes Match. The FAQ appears to have been updated within the last three to four weeks, and unequivocally states that users who subscribe to Apple Music do not need to also subscribe to iTunes Match, as “Apple Music includes all the benefits of iTunes Match to make all of your music available on all of your devices.” \nPreviously, the Apple Music Membership page explained that users with iTunes Match could use it together with Apple Music, and directed users to an Apple support article on understanding differences between Apple Music and iTunes Match , with the most notable difference being that iTunes Match subscribers were able to download DRM-free 256kbps AAC versions of any tracks matched from their own library, whereas Apple Music customers were only able to access the DRM-encumbered Apple Music versions. \nEarlier this year, Jim Dalrymple of The Loop reported that Apple was working on gradually bringing full iTunes Match capabilities to Apple Music subscribers. This recent change to the Apple Music Membership FAQ suggests that Apple has completed this process and Apple Music subscribers will no longer need to maintain a separate subscription to iTunes Match to benefit from features such as improved matching algorithms and DRM-free downloads, although iTunes Match remains an option for non-Apple Music subscribers.",

      "text": "12/07/16 AT 12:23 PM Close \nSpotify had a considerable head start on Apple when it came to its subscriber base, but the music service from the Cupertino company is closing in on its competition. Apple Music now has more than 20 million subscribers, according to a report from Billboard . \nApple’s streaming music service reached the new milestone just 18 months after its initial launch. The company saw a significant jump in subscribers in the last three months, increasing its paying members by 15 percent since it reached 17 million subscribers in September. \nAccording to the company, 60 percent of customers streaming on Apple Music have not bought content from the iTunes Music Store in the last 12 months—a statistic that is likely exciting for Apple and disappointing for artists who get a larger profit from purchases than from streams . \nMuch of Apple’s success has been driven by its exclusive content. During 2016, the platform got the initial launch of chart-topping albums including Drake’s Views , Frank Ocean’s Blonde , Major Key from DJ Khaled, Birds in the Trap Sing McKnight from Travis Scott, and Chance the Rapper’s Coloring Book , among others. \nMany of those titles hit milestones on Apple Music. Drake’s Views was the first album to achieve one billion streams on the platform, while Chance’s album reached the top 10 of the Billboard charts on streams alone—a feat Apple's senior vice president of internet software and services Eddie Cue told Billboard he “can't recall that being done before.” \nApple has made up significant ground in the streaming market since launching at essentially zero in 2015, but it’s still trailing Spotify. In fact, it’s trailing by about as much as it was at launch. Related Stories",

      "text": "Will Samsung's Galaxy S8 gamble backfire in 2017? Samsung takes a page from Apple's book this time. December 7, 2016 19:56 IST No 3.5mm headphone jack, Home button, microUSB port in Samsung Galaxy S8 Reuters file \nIt has been a tough year for Samsung due to the Galaxy Note 7 debacle. But the company is planning to bounce back next year by making it up with its Galaxy S8 launch. \nIf the rumours are to be believed, Samsung is raising the stakes for its upcoming flagship. According an exclusive report from SamMobile, the Korean tech titan is going to ditch the standard audio jack, also known as the 3.5mm headphone jack, from the Galaxy S8 – a move similar to what Apple did with the iPhone 7 series. \nTo fill the void, users will need an adapter to connect their existing headphones. The report also revealed that the Galaxy S8 will finally let go of the microUSB port in favour of a USB Type-C, which is a much-needed upgrade considering companies like OnePlus and LeEco have already adopted the latest tech. The USB Type-C port not only brings convenience to the table, but also makes charging and data transfer faster. \nRead : Samsung Galaxy S8, S8 edge release date: 3 features that may stand out in next-gen smartphone \nOn the downside, users will not be able to use both headphones and charger at the same time. But it is a bold move for Samsung to win over consumers it may have lost due to the Galaxy Note 7 fiasco. \nBy removing the headphone jack, the company will be able to make the Galaxy S8 slimmer and also give room for a bigger battery. SamMobile also suggests the company will use the extra space to add stereo speakers, mostly in collaboration with Harman, to make audio better and louder. But the rumours do not mention anything about wireless headphones to accompany the Galaxy S8, something like Apple's AirPods. \nWhile this change might be too hard to digest at once, another report suggests Samsung might also ditch the physical Home Button it has offered in all of its smartphones. In case you are wondering about the fingerprint scanner integration, Samsung will place it under the display. The company might also use a pressure-sensitive display technology that will work just like Apple's 3D Touch. \nBy removing the home button, Samsung Galaxy S8 will likely have a higher screen-to-body ratio. As for rest of the specs, the 2017 flagship will come with a 2K display, Snapdragon 835 chipset, upgraded camera on both sides , 256GB storage and 6GB RAM. With these upgrades, the Galaxy S8 is going to be one of the top anticipated phones of next year. If the tradition follows, the launch will happen around MWC 2017 in February. Also read ",

      "text": "When Apple rolled out tvOS 10 in September we couldn’t help but notice that single sign-on—a feature that lets you enter your cable provider details once and then use them across multiple apps—didn’t make the cut. Apple promised that the new feature would land on Apple TV in December, and recently the company made good on its word.\n\nAs first noticed by MacRumors, single sign-on is now available on the fourth-generation Apple TV and iOS 10 devices. The feature is only available for U.S. users, which is where the bulk of cable provider hassles exist anyway. At launch, only 10 cable providers support single sign-on including CenturyLink Prism, DirecTV, Dish, GVTC, GVA, Hawaiian Telecom, Hotwire, MetroCast, and Sling.\n\nTo read this article in full or to leave a comment, please click here",

      "title": "Few iOS apps in enterprises meet Apple’s new security mandate",
      "text": "  \nOnly 3% of the top 200 iOS apps installed on enterprise devices worldwide have fully implemented Apple’s coming data encryption requirements, research shows.   \nFind out what are the most appropriate threat intelligence systems and services for your organisation   \nIn June 2016, Apple announced that App Transport Security (ATS) will become a requirement for new App Store apps from 1 January 2017. \nATS, which was introduced in iOS 9, forces an app to connect to web services over an HTTPS connection rather than HTTP to keep data secure while in transit by encrypting it. \nWith less than a month to go before ATS becomes a requirement, researchers at enterprise threat protection firm Appthority found just six of the 200 top enterprise iOS apps conform to ATS. \n“Appthority researchers found that the majority of apps in the enterprise don’t fully utilise the best practices encryption standard, which should be a concern to enterprises,” said Robbie Forkish, vice-president of engineering at Appthority. \n“The new ATS mandate only applies to new submissions to the App Store, and Apple will be allowing exceptions to ATS, so, while the requirement should strengthen data security, there will still be iOS apps not using data encryption in enterprise environments, even after 1 January 2017. \n“For this reason, it’s incredibly important that businesses have visibility into, and management of, the risks related to apps with these exceptions, as they can put enterprise data at risk,” he said. \nThe research also revealed 55% of apps in use by enterprises allow the use of HTTP, instead of requiring HTTPS, while 83% had ATS disabled for all network connections and 26% had ATS disabled at a global level, with specific exceptions set up for domains. Read more about mobile security Nearly one-third of Android devices in enterprises today are running version 4.0 or older of the operating system, leaving them highly susceptible to vulnerabilities , a study shows. Experts told the CW500 Security Club how mobility brings new challenges to security departments and an opportunity to go beyond building walls around the enterprise. For all the benefits of supporting mobility in the enterprise , it has also introduced one of the biggest challenges for IT pros today: safeguarding the flow of confidential data. Traditional security does not always work for mobile as mobile operating systems are different to those on PCs , says MobileIron’s Mike Raggo. \nAccording to Appthority, existing apps that do not comply with the ATS mandate will not be removed from the App Store, which means enterprises will have to continue to be vigilant about apps in their environments. \nThe research is aimed at explaining the technical requirements of ATS, the mechanisms Apple is providing for acceptable exceptions, and what ATS does and does not do to help app security. \nJames Lyne, global head of security research at Sophos, has warned that insecure commercial and internal mobile app coding practices leave the door wide open to cyber attackers. \nA lot of emphasis is placed on the millions of mobile malware samples being detected, but he said insecure apps could represent an even greater threat. \n“Programming practices are pretty bad, despite there being ready-made security functionality available to consumers, but this is just not being used,” he told Computer Weekly in February 2016. \nLyne, who conducted an analysis of 1,000 top apps focusing on encryption, data transmission, authentication and data storage, said it was “quite shocking” how many applications, including large brands, fail to make use of the security features available on mobile devices.

      "text": "0 Comments How do you become a famous author? Step 1: Start publishing to iBooks! \nApple's iBooks Author makes it easy for you to write your bestselling novel, textbook, cook book, or story book, complete with illustrations, cover art, and even interactive content. You can even sell your digital books right in the iBooks Store! Write your book \nOf course, there is no reason to get excited about winning the Nobel Prize for Literature until you've actually written a book. If you've already got the backbone of your content written thanks to a little help from NaNoWriMo , you can use the iBooks Author app for Mac or another EPUB creator tool. Keep in mind that your book has to be published as either a .ibooks or .epub file. \nIf you don't know how to create a book in EPUB or iBooks format, Apple has partnered with a number of book publishing experts that can help you correctly format your book and make sure it meets the iBooks Store requirements. Sign up with iTunes Connect \nSo, you've already got a book ready to publish. Good. Now it's time to get registered as an iBooks author so you can start selling. You'll need to enable your Apple ID for iTunes Connect first. Your Apple ID needs to be verified and you must have a valid credit card on file. \nYou can use the same Apple ID that you use to purchase content in the App Store or iTunes, but you can't use the same Apple ID that you use to sell other types of content in iTunes (like apps, music, or movies). So, if you are already an app developer selling in iTunes, you'll need to create a new iTunes Connect account with a different Apple ID. \nOnce you have enabled iTunes Connect with your Apple ID, you will need to sign an iBooks agreement. There are two different types of agreements; \"Offer Your Books for Free\" and \"Offer Your Books for Free and Sell Your Books.\" The former is the agreement you want if you never intend to sell content in the iBooks Store and will only, ever give it away. If you think there will every be a chance that you might want to sell books in the iBooks Store, you might as well select the latter. \nIf you do select \"Offer Your Books for Free and Sell Your Books,\" you'll also have to fill out a secondary contract and provide banking and tax information to Apple. If you live in the U.S., you'll need a U.S. Tax ID (EIN) , so you may want to apply for that right away, since it might take a few weeks for the IRS to update your records. Get the iTunes Producer app on your Mac \nOnce you've written your book and formatted it as an iBook, are registered with iTunes Connect, and have signed the requisite agreements, you're ready to upload your ebook to the iBooks Store. That's where the iTunes Producer app comes in. It is a resource tool for publishing. It's different than the iBooks Author. \nYou can get iTunes Producer from the Resources and Help section of iTunes Connect. It is only compatible with the Mac. If you don't have a Mac, you can get one of those Apple partners to publish your book for you. \nThe iTunes Producer will help you build your iBooks Store summary page, complete with samples, cover art, category, title, author name, and price tag. You can also select which countries your book is available in. Sell your books in the iBooks Store \nAfter you've uploaded your content, created your summary page and included details, cover art, and a sample, you can submit your ebook for publication. While in the iTunes Producer app, you'll hit the Submit button to send it to iTunes for authentication. After the book is authenticated, you'll be able to check the status of your book in iTunes Connect. If you ever want to change the price of your book, or even remove it from the iBooks Store completely, you can do so from your My Books dashboard. Good luck and happy selling! Like us! ",

      "text": "Apple says iPhones safe despite flaming China handsets \n  12:58 PM Tweet \nSHANGHAI, China (AFP) — Apple has blamed \"external physical damage\" for causing a handful of iPhones to explode or catch fire in China and insisted that its handsets posed no safety problem. \nFresh on the heels of Samsung's worldwide Galaxy Note 7 safety fiasco, a Shanghai consumer watchdog said last Friday it had received eight recent reports of iPhones that spontaneously combusted while being used or charged. \nIn a statement to AFP late Tuesday, the US tech giant said it had retrieved units for analysis and conducted thorough tests on phones which had experienced \"thermal events\", but brushed off safety concerns. \n\"The units we’ve analysed so far have clearly shown that external physical damage happened to them which led to the thermal event,\" the statement said. \n\"We treat safety as a top priority and have found no cause for concern with these products.\" \nThe company also denied being slow to respond, after the state-run Shanghai Consumer Council had urged it to address consumer complaints. \nThe watchdog's report quoted one woman as saying her iPhone 6s Plus exploded in August, shattering the screen and leaving the battery and back of the phone blackened. \nThe council said it had received a sixfold surge in total complaints against Apple in the past two months, including sudden shutdowns of the iPhone 6 and 6s even though batteries still had enough power. \nThe council did not say where the complaining iPhone users were located. \nApple last month offered to change iPhone 6s batteries for Chinese users who complained of the sudden shutdowns, but said the problem did not constitute a safety issue. \nSamsung suffered a severe blow over its Galaxy Note 7's woes, recalling some 2.5 million units after reports of the product catching fire.

      "text": "The Washington Post Apple said in talks with film studios for early movie rental Apple is pressing Hollywood studios for earlier access to movies, according to people with knowledge of the matter, a move that would bolster the company’s iTunes business 7 de diciembre de 2016 (cultofmac) 21st Century Fox Inc., Warner Bros. and Universal Pictures all confirmed over the past week that they are looking to offer high-priced, home-video rentals of new movies shortly after they open in theaters. Some studio executives have been pushing to allow home rentals as early as two weeks after theatrical debuts and are considering a deal with iTunes as one option, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the discussions are private. The most recent talks are part of longer-running efforts by Cupertino, California-based Apple to get new movies sooner, two of the people said. Such an arrangement could help iTunes stand out in a crowded online market for movies, TV shows and music. While the iTunes store helped Apple build a dominant role in music retailing, the company hasn't carved out a similar role in music and video streaming. Christine Monaghan, a company spokeswoman, declined to comment. The studios could end up choosing another technology platform instead of Apple to deliver movies more quickly to households. (Business Insider) Hollywood studios typically give theaters exclusive rights to new movies for 90 days or more before issuing them on DVD or making them available for online purchase. With cinema attendance mostly stagnant and home-video revenue flat in recent years, film companies are under pressure to find new areas of growth. Shares of movie-theater chains fell. AMC Entertainment Holdings dropped as much as 2.8 percent, while Regal Entertainment Group slid as much as 1.9 percent. Cinemark fell as much as 1.1 percent. Earlier availability of new movies could satisfy a growing consumer appetite and deter piracy, Warner Bros. chief Kevin Tsujihara said last week. One option is a premium-priced online rental for new movies, at prices of $25 to $50, a possibility under consideration at the studios, according to people with knowledge of the matter. READ MORE: Want a job in Silicon Valley? Keep away from coding schools Theater chains have battled to keep their exclusive hold over new movies, in some cases boycotting films that were released too soon for home viewing. But Cinemark Holdings Inc., the No. 3 U.S. exhibitor, said recently it's looking for solutions that would benefit both sides and held preliminary talks about creating a so-called premium window for home entertainment. Such a service is likely within the next 18 months, one of the people said. Those talks may have gained momentum after Sean Parker, the founder of Napster, said in March he was trying to create a new home-video service, called Screening Room, that would offer viewers movies on the same day they were released in theaters. The company has also discussed offering movies at home after 14 days in theaters, two of the people said. A spokeswoman for Screening Room declined to comment. One of the concerns about iTunes is whether it will be a secure platform for delivering movies that are still in theaters, the people said. While Apple encrypts iTunes video files so they can't easily be duplicated, it's possible to use a camera to record a movie playing on a TV screen. A leak of picture that's still in theaters would jeopardize returns for the studios and cinema owners. (MacRumors) Screening Room uses a watermarking technology that's supposed to prevent piracy by making it possible to track down the source of a leak. To compete with popular music streaming services such as Spotify, Apple acquired Beats Music in 2014 and built its own streaming music service. Yet the maker of iPhones and Mac computers wasn't part of the surge in streaming video propelled by Netflix and Amazon.com. Eddy Cue, Apple's senior vice president for software and services, has taken small steps toward developing video content with a series of app- and music-based shows, while efforts to obtain streaming rights to films and TV shows have thus far been unfruitful. This month Apple will release a new app, dubbed simply TV, that will serve as a hub for users to watch content from a number of different apps. Netflix is notably absent. Authors Anousha Sakoui",

      "title": "Apple Music Is Already a $2.4 Billion Business",
      "text": "Image source: Apple.\nIt's been just over a year since Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) started charging for Apple Music, and the music streaming service is already a $2.4 billion business. Apple Music launched in summer 2016 with a free three-month trial, and billing kicked in that September. The Mac maker doesn't provide regular scheduled updates on Apple Music's performance, but does occasionally tout how many paid subscribers it has. The last official update was at Apple's September event, when CEO Tim Cook said the service had garnered 17 million subscribers.\nThe latest data point comes from Billboard , which recently interviewed services chief Eddy Cue and Beats 1 DJ Zane Lowe. Apple Music has now hit 20 million subscribers, according to the report. At $120 per year, we're now talking about an annual run rate of $2.4 billion for Apple Music.\nData source: Apple and various media reports. Chart by author.\nSo far, so good.\nRight on Cue Apple's services chief also shared some additional data points regarding this subscriber base. Cue notes that roughly 60% of Apple Music subscribers haven't purchased any content from the iTunes Music Store over the past month, which makes sense since Apple Music grants access to a comprehensive catalog and artists rarely withhold their collections from Apple Music. There's very little reason for Apple Music subscribers to purchase content a la carte. Most of these subscribers are new customers, Cue adds. Over half of Apple Music's subscriber base is located internationally.\nApple Music is also seeing some success with exclusive releases, which helps explain why the company is also seemingly fascinated with original video content that it could use to market Apple Music.\nThe executive also points out that there's still plenty of growth opportunities in music streaming, noting that as an industry there are collectively still less than 100 million subscribers. At last count, Spotify had about 40 million paid subscribers. Note that Cue is only referring to paid subscribers; there are countless more ad-supported free users that don't pay anything out of pocket. Naturally, the music industry would highly prefer people pay for content directly instead of relying on ads to subsidize and monetize music. Unsurprisingly, YouTube thinks ad-revenue is a viable model that can complement paid subscriptions, pointing out just yesterday that it has paid out $1 billion in ad revenue to the music industry over the past year.\nApple is catching up to Spotify To put the annualized $2.4 billion into context, consider the fact that Apple's services business has generated $24.3 billion in revenue on a trailing-12-month (TTM) basis. That means that over the next year at current subscriber levels, Apple Music is already around 10% of how much revenue services have brought in over the past year. This is an important transition as Apple is doing its best to shift investor focus on recurring revenue sources, while the vast majority of services revenue comes from ongoing purchases that, while regular, aren't technically recurring (much like iPhone upgrades).\nIt's also worth noting that Apple Music is catching up to Spotify in terms of paid subscribers. Earlier this year, Apple Music had about a third as many subscribers (11 million compared to 30 million), and it now has half as many subscribers (20 million compared to 40 million). Unlike video services that aren't necessarily mutually exclusive due to little overlap in content, music services are very much mutually exclusive since the catalogs are extremely similar, if not identical. No one subscribes to both Spotify Premium and Apple Music.\nLed by Apple and Spotify, the paid music streaming sector is growing, and that's music to the industry's ears.\n10 stocks we like better than Apple\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

      "text": "Apple in talks to bring new movies to iTunes while they’re still in theaters Yoni Heisler Pin it Share As Apple seeks to navigate a rapidly shifting media landscape where original programming is becoming more and more important, the Cupertino-based company is reportedly hoping to lure users back over to the lovely confines of iTunes by focusing on movies. DON’T MISS: 10 great iOS 10 widgets that should be on every iPhone According to a new report from Bloomberg , Apple is extremely interested in inking deals with Hollywood studios that would allow the company to release new movies on iTunes much earlier than normal. As it stands today, new releases don’t make their way to iTunes until about 3 months after their initial theatrical release. Looking to turn that dynamic on its head, movie studios and Apple are reportedly entertaining the idea of narrowing that gap down to two weeks. \nThe most recent talks are part of longer-running efforts by Cupertino, California-based Apple to get new movies sooner, two of the people said. Such an arrangement could help iTunes stand out in a crowded online market for movies, TV shows and music. While the iTunes store helped Apple build a dominant role in music retailing, the company hasn’t carved out a similar role in music and video streaming. Of particular interest here is that such a deal would be mutually beneficial for all parties involved. In addition to making iTunes a more appealing destination for media consumption, it would also provide Hollywood studios with another revenue stream. Of course, the ability to rent a movie so shortly after its theatrical release would come with a hefty price, with some movie studios reportedly toying with the idea of charging consumers anywhere from $25 to $50 for a single rental.

In a decision that upsets a long-standing rule for calculating damages for design patent infringement, the Court held that damages can be based on profits from individual components of the smartphones. Before yesterday's decision, the plaintiff in a design patent infringement case could recover the entire profits from the sale of an infringing device, even if the design patent only covered a small portion of the device. The Supreme Court's decision opens the door for a rule that could significantly reduce exposure in design patent infringement cases. \nThe Court did not, however, provide a rule for determining whether damages should be based on the whole device or some smaller portion of the device. Instead, the Court remanded the case to the Federal Circuit to craft a rule and apply it to the case at hand. In essence, then, the Court kicked the can down the road on providing a specific test for determining design patent damages, both in Samsung v. Apple , and in all future design patent infringement cases. \nKey to the decision is 35 U.S.C. § 289, the statutory provision for design patent damages. It allows for profit disgorgement based on a defendant's use of a patented \"article of manufacture.\" Section 289 also states that the infringer \"shall be liable to the owner to the extent of his total profit.\" Thus, a determination of damages for design patent infringement involves a two-part analysis—identify the \"article of manufacture\" to which the infringed design applies, and determine the total profits the infringer made selling that article of manufacture. \nThe Supreme Court partially addressed the first part of the analysis and asked \"whether, in the case of a multi-component product, the relevant 'article of manufacture' must always be the end product sold to the consumer or whether it can also be a component of that product.\" Based on the text of the statute, the Court concluded that \"the term 'article of manufacture' is broad enough to embrace both a product sold to a consumer and a component of that product, whether sold separately or not. Thus, reading 'article of manufacture' in Section 289 to cover only an end product sold to a consumer gives too narrow a meaning to the phrase.\" The Court thus reversed the Federal Circuit's ruling that components of the infringing smartphones could not be the relevant article of manufacture because consumers could not purchase those components separately from the smartphones. However, the Supreme Court declined to state a test for the first step of the Section 289 damages inquiry and remanded that issue to the Federal Circuit. Yesterday's decision did not identify the correct \"article of manufacture\" in the case, and left that question open for another day. \nGoing forward, it will be critical to identify the relevant \"article of manufacture\" in developing design patent prosecution and litigation strategies. At the moment, there is significant uncertainty in the law, and that uncertainty highlights the advantages of obtaining and asserting multiple design patents of varying scope for a given product. For example, a strategy involving multiple design patents that cover both the entire product and individual components of that product provides a hedge against changes in the law that will be developing over the coming years. Filing of design patent applications of varying scope can maximize the scope of patent coverage while also maximizing potential damage awards. \nDISCLAIMER: Because of the generality of this update, the information provided herein may not be applicable in all situations and should not be acted upon without specific legal advice based on particular situations. \nBallard Spahr LLP \"My best business intelligence, in one easy email\" » * - hide Privacy Policy \nJD Supra provides users with access to its legal industry publishing services (the \"Service\") through (the \"Website\") as well as through other sources.

Learn more... \nWed, Dec 7, 2016, 20:51 GMT - UK Markets closed Apple is the \"big test case\" for Trump offshoring policy By Aaron Coleman | CNBC – 22 minutes ago Print Inside.com CEO Jason Calacanis told CNBC on Wednesday that Donald Trump's negotiations with Apple will prove whether the president-elect can actually return offshored jobs back to the United States. \nBeyond tweets and public appearances, the real estate mogul is yet to establish a clear, consistent strategy addressing U.S. companies that hire abroad. \"Trump obviously likes to negotiate,\" Calacanis said referring to the recent Carrier deal. \"He likes to bully you, then brings you to the lobby, take a selfie and then have some victory laps with you.\" \nHowever, Calacanis contends that if the president-elect wants to lure wealthier companies like Apple, he will need to use more creative financial incentives. Calacanis said that Trump could offer tax amnesty to a firm like Apple to spur domestic hiring and wage increases. \n\"Trump wants to be a hero to the people, and he's got a little bit of negotiating room with the repatriation of taxes,\" Calacanis said. \"I can see him using it as a real big carrot and stick to companies.\" \nYet, it remains to be seen if these tactics could work. \"Apple is going to be the big test case,\" Calacanis continued. \"Apple under Steve Jobs said, 'Listen: These jobs are never coming back.' Can these jobs come back?\" Calacanis asked. \"It's a big question.\" \nCurrently, Calacanis believes that Apple would not move back to the United States to avoid the high production costs. However, Calacanis said that if Trump combined tariffs on Apple products made in China with tax breaks for Apple products made in the U.S., it might improve the U.S. employment situation. Calacanis also thought that such heavy interference with Apple's operations \"could be a disaster.\" \n\"That's I think the danger of Trump. It's all fun right now to have everybody going to Trump Tower. It's great theater,\" Calacanis said. \"What if Trump, who is answerable to no one, puts a $50 tariff on iPhones coming from China?\" \n\"The guy is complete loose cannon,\" Calacanis said. \"I think this is what the American people wanted. They wanted to clean house. And you know what, it's going to be an interesting experiment.\" The pope says spreading fake news is like a fetish for �� Quartz - 1 hour 52 minutes ago Pope Francis said today that spreading false news and trying to smear politicians was “probably the greatest damage that the media can do.” Using exceptionally strong language, he used the word “coprophilia”, which means arousal from excrement, and … More » Fitbit is acquiring Kickstarter darling Pebble to keep afloat Quartz - 2 hours 36 minutes ago Just like its users, Fitbit is trying to stay healthy.

      "title": "10 great iOS 10 widgets that should be on every iPhone",
      "text": "It might not be tomorrow. It might not even be five years from now. But some day, Apple’s iOS platform will support home screen widgets. Apple’s unique iOS widget implementation is thought of by some as offering the best of both worlds. Widget support is there and it’s somewhat versatile, but widgets are buried off screen, forcing users to swipe to the right on either the lock screen or the first home screen in order to access the widget pane. On one hand, this allows iOS to support widgets without causing a big drain on the battery. On the other, it means zero-touch access to information, which is arguably the best thing about mobile widgets, is not possible. Since iOS 10 widgets are hidden off screen, many people don’t even both using the feature. But we’re here to tell you that it’s time to give widgets another shot on your iPhone — and in this post, we’ll show you 10 iOS 10 widgets that should be installed on every iPhone.\nDON’T MISS:  How to enable the secret emoticon keyboard hiding in your iPhone \nA recent thread on Reddit made me realize how often I actually do use widgets. I was pretty skeptical of how useful iOS widgets would be when Apple first introduced them, considering how limited their utility was (and still is). Though they are indeed limited compared to Android widgets, iOS 10 widgets can still be incredibly useful.\nWhether or not you currently use any widgets on your iPhone, you’ll find links to 10 different iOS 10 widgets that you should definitely check out below.\nAirLaunch Pro This is easily one of my favorite iOS 10 widgets. It allows you to create a wide range of custom actions that are all accessible with a single tap from within an AirLaunch widget. Examples of how I use the widget include accessing the iPhone’s hotspot and VPN features each with a single touch, and copying my address to the clipboard so I can quickly and easily paste it into an email or elsewhere. Of course, that’s just the tip of the iceberg with this nifty app.\nDownload AirLaunch Pro \nNearby Traffic Everyone uses the Google Maps app, but did you know there are a bunch of useful iOS 10 widgets baked in? The Nearby Traffic widget gives you instant access to information about traffic around your current location.\nDownload Google Maps \nNearby Transit Another great iOS 10 widget baked into Google Maps is the Nearby Transit widget, which makes it insanely easy to find public transit nearby.\nDownload Google Maps \nFantastical 2 The best calendar widget in the App Store, hands down.\nDownload Fantastical 2 \nCopied Copied is a great clipboard manager that saves things you copy to your clipboard so you can access more than just the last text you copied.\nDownload Copied \nWorkflow Workflow is an endlessly useful automation app, and the widget is just as endlessly useful as the app itself.\nDownload Workflow \nDeliveries This app makes it incredibly simple to track all of the packages en route to your home or office, and now you don’t even have to open the app to get updates.\nDownload Deliveries \nStocks Widget This free widget lets you see what your entire portfolio is doing in near real time with a single swipe to your widget panel.\nDownload Stocks Widget \nMiniStats This nifty widget shows you information such as how much cellular data you’ve used in your current billing cycle.\nDownload MiniStats \nDark Sky The best iOS weather app also packs one of the best iOS 10 weather widgets. Instead of blasting you with all kinds of weather data you don’t need, Dak Sky shows you the current weather conditions, the day’s high and low, and the likelihood of precipitation for the next hour.\nDownload Dark Sky \nBONUS I didn’t list this among the 10 widgets above since not everyone has an August Smart Lock, but if you do have one, you absolutely must check out the widget. Instead of having to fumble with the app on your phone or your Apple Watch, the August widget lets you either lock or unlock your Smart Lock with a single tap.\nDownload August Home \nTrending right now: \nPokemon Go just got a new update, but it’s not the exciting release you wanted Amazon’s 15 best daily deals: COD Infinite Warfare, Fitbit Alta, waterproof wireless earbuds, more Trump might move iPhone manufacturing to America after all See the original version of this article on BGR.com",

      "text": "The makers of Pokemon Go should have seen this coming. According to Apple, the augmented reality-based app is not the best game of the year on the iPhone, according to Venture Beat . Apple recently revealed the list of its official Game of the Year awards for the iPhone, iPad and other devices. The iPhone Game of the Year is arguably the biggest category given the popularity of the smartphone.\nImage Source: geralt /Pixabay.com Pokemon Go not among the top ten iPhone games Developer Supercell’s Clash Royale won the title of Game of the Year for the iPhone, while Severed received the award for iPad Game of the Year. The Apple Watch and Apple TV Game of the Year were won by Field Day and Riptide GP , respectively, says VentureBeat.\nIn the game Clash Royale, players face each other by dropping cards from their deck onto a battlefield. Those cards transform into units with multiple capabilities. The mobile game is free for download, but players can spend money on cards to improve their deck. According to Apple, it is a vicious cycle and the best mobile game that came out for the iPhone in 2016.\n“It has one of the best presentations on mobile platforms, and it is incredibly playable,” says VentureBeat.\nThe augmented reality-based app Pokemon Go could not even make it onto the list of the top ten games on the iPhone. The top ten games were Clash Royale , Reigns, Inks, FIFA Mobile Football, Klocki, Rodeo Stampede: Sky Zoo Safari, Pktball, Snakebird, Twofold Inc., and The Trail. \nThe top ten iPhone games surely deserve recognition, especially Reigns, from developer Nerial and publisher Devolver Digital, says VentureBeat. This mobile game turns the simple act of swiping on profile pictures from matchmaking applications into a gameplay mechanic. Every profile picture comes with new choices, and those choices have consequences.\nSprint to tie in with Pokemon Go In other Pokemon Go -related news, Sprint CEO Marcelo Claure has hinted about a possible tie-in of the carrier with the game. In a recent tweet, Claure said Sprint will have a special announcement for Pokemon Go trainers soon.\nAccording to Phone Arena, all Sprint store managers were asked to update their GPS coordinates on November 29 because of a new promotion that the carrier will be running with the augmented reality-based game, a source reportedly told Phone Arena. Sprint could tie in with the next huge update to the mobile game. The big update will possibly add the ability to make trades, plus 100 new Pokemon and player vs. player battles, among features.\nThe post Not Pokemon Go, But Clash Royale Is iPhone Game Of The Year appeared first on ValueWalk .\n",

      "text": "Apple set up a smart home to demo Home app Stringing lights on Christmas trees is a standard practice for the holidays, but there's a lot you can do to decorate beyond plugging something into an extension cord. Now that smart home products are more affordable and ubiquitous, 2016 is ready to deliver a next-level celebration. \nWhether you plan on impressing guests at a party or just want to make sure your house is warm before you get home after vacation, let's take a look at how smart home devices can automate the season. \nGetting started \nFirst, you'll need to decide which ecosystem you want to be a part of, such as the Samsung ( SSNLF ) SmartThings or Apple ( AAPL , Tech30 ) HomeKit platform. Not all devices work within the same ecosystems, so you'll want to buy smart home products that run on the platform you choose or you'll have to switch between apps. \nNext, ensure the products you buy are secure. Change the default log-in name and password on all new devices before installing them. In October, the cyberattack that took parts of the internet offline , including sites such as Twitter, Netflix and Spotify, were carried out by products connected to the home that were infected with malware. \nRelated: Your Hackable House \nThe good news is more companies are building security directly into products. For instance, Apple requires HomeKit-capable smart products to meet security and technical specifications. Set up is typically easy, too -- you add the gadget to the system by plugging in the device and entering a special code within the HomeKit app. \nAnd if you're using HomeKit, Siri can handle your requests. You can ask the voice assistant to lock the doors doors, turn the lights on or off or set the mood for a movie night. \nConnected lights \nLights are a great entry-point into the smart home space. Automate your home's ambiance with Philips Hue light bulbs , with kits that start at $130, and create a different environment in each room. If you're having a movie night, you can dim the bulbs from the couch via the smartphone app, or turn the room a festive green when unwrapping gifts. You can also sync Hue lights with the Amazon Echo and Siri, as well as platforms like Google Home, SmartThings and Nest. \nThese lights also work with third-party apps such as the Hue Disco to create fun light shows for a holiday party. While there shouldn't be any security issues, researchers found a flaw in the Hue system earlier this year that could have allowed attackers to remotely take control of the lights from afar. Philips has since patched the flaw. \nOutlets \nApp-connected outlets , such as those from Incipio and ConnectSense (at $40 and $60, respectively), plug into your home's regular outlets to control small appliances and lights. Add one behind the Christmas to avoid climbing under the branches; you can control it via your phone instead. It also works for outdoor lights, so you don't need to freeze when you turn them off late at night. \nWeb cams \nTo capture Santa delivering gifts, cameras like Nest Cam ($200) or Blink ($100) can be placed throughout the home. It's easy to check in while you're away to see if pets or kids are peeking into presents before Christmas morning. \nRelated: These Christmas lights don't need to be wrapped around the tree \nSmart thermostats \nSmart thermostats like Nest or Ecobee , both cost $250, let you set and adjust temperatures from afar. This means you can return from a holiday trip to a toasty home. \nSmart speakers \nThe Amazon ( AMZN , Tech30 ) Echo smart speaker, at $180, works with hundreds of smart home gadgets -- many of which are highlighted above. You can also ask Alexa, its built-in voice assistant, to play music, tell you the weather and ask for Santa's location. It'll also add and buy presents directly via the Echo , or set timers when baking holiday cookies. \nOutside of the box \nIf you'd rather keep your home offline but still have decorations with a tech flare, consider the Tree Dazzler , a quirky curtain of lights that hang over your tree. There's also the Star Shower , an As Seen on TV laser device that projects thousands of tiny stars onto the front of your house. Both cost about $40. \nCNNMoney (San Francisco)   4:14 PM ET",

      "text": "Apple wants to high-priced early movie rentals to its users, reports Bloomberg , and is in talks with film studios to make that happen. Sources say that the company is pushing to make movies that are still in theaters available for on iTunes. The move would seriously disrupt the already tense relationship studios have with theater chains, but it’s clear at this point that this is the direction the industry will go in years ahead.\nMovies could hit home audiences after just two weeks According to Bloomberg , Apple has met with 20th Century Fox, Warner Bros., and Universal Pictures to bring movies that have just entered theaters to home audiences in as early as two weeks . The move would help iTunes a more unique one-stop shop from content, and further stand out against such competitors as Netflix and Amazon. Though Apple Music is growing swiftly, having just hit 20 million subscribers , its TV and movie offerings have lagged behind its streaming competitors. Having early access to movies from three of the biggest studios in Hollywood may help change its standing.\nOf course, it can’t be understated how big this move would be for the industry. Studios currently give theater chains like AMC and Regal Entertainment exclusive rights to new films for 90 days. However, with theater attendance stagnant and trending downward, they’ve already been searching for new strategies to increase revenue. Sean Parker of Napster fame revealed one such strategy at CinemaCon earlier this year: called Screening Room , the streaming service would offer users first-run movies on their TVs for $50 a pop. A solution like that would necessarily mean that theaters would be less essential to a movie’s life.\nNaturally, theater chains aren’t thrilled about that prospect, and have fought studios finding alternative routes to audiences. Chains boycotted Paranormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension when Paramount decided to release the film to Video on Demand after just 17 days. And Netflix could only release its critical darling Beasts of No Nation in indie theaters after it opted for a same-day streaming release, bucking theater companies completely, though that didn’t stop it from being viewed 3 million times in just 10 days.\nThe one unresolved issue, however, is piracy. The hope is that earlier access to films would help deter pirates from stealing content, and iTunes already encrypts its content, but it’s not certain if enterprising thieves can find a way around the service’s security features.\nTheaters are fighting this trend, but it’s clearly the future Still, this is the future. Release windows will certainly shrink and movies will be made available to audiences sooner, so Apple is smart to position itself in the middle of that shift. That such directors as James Cameron and J.J. Abrams already back Screening Room speaks to the industry’s overall attitude toward home streaming. It’s just a matter of theaters finding a way to get on board.",

Sources say that the company is pushing to make movies that are still in theaters available for on iTunes. The move would seriously disrupt the already tense relationship studios have with theater chains, but it’s clear at this point that this is the direction the industry will go in years ahead.\n\n\"Movies could hit home audiences after just two weeks\"\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, Apple has met with 20th Century Fox, Warner Bros., and Universal Pictures to bring movies that have just entered theaters to home audiences in as early as two weeks. The move would help iTunes a more unique one-stop shop from content,...",

      "text": "Red could be the new jet black if the latest rumor about a bright new color for Apple's 2017 iPhone turns out to be true.\nEnlarge Image Could the next iPhone come in red?\nPhoto by César Salza/CNET Apple's lineup of flagship phones typically plays it safe, with white, blacks and mellow metallics. Adding red to the lineup would echo the phone giant's cheerier, bolder palette with the iPhone 5C , which also came in the peppy hue way back when. Apple is also known for its affinity for the color due to its involvement with the (RED) charity, which raises money to combat AIDS . The partnership between the two has resulted in a handful of red products in the past.\nWhile a red iPhone flagship would be a huge change, the rumor's source told Japanese Apple blog Macotakara that 2017's 10th anniversary iPhone will be called the iPhone 7S, which would be Apple's convention for odd-numbered years.\nFurthermore, Macotakara reported that the iPhone 7S and 7S Plus might not be the overhaul that many in the industry expect, suggesting that the phone will have a new chip (the A11) with a faster processor, though still no wireless charging .\nThese last two claims contradict earlier reports, but there is a third option (and this is where the plot thickens). Apple could release three new iPhones in 2017 , according to prominent Apple speculator Ming-Chi Kuo, an analyst with KGI Securities. Similar to how Apple released the iPhone SE and the iPhone 7 in the same year, 2017 could bring us a (red) iPhone 7S in addition to a more groundbreaking iPhone 8 .\nApple did not immediately respond to CNET's request for comment.\n ",

Post to Facebook Report: Apple wants movies on iTunes earlier Apple wants a happy ending to its continuing pursuit of Hollywood studios for early access to movies on iTunes.  //usat.ly/2gWuRxo   Join the Nation's Conversation   Report: Apple wants movies on iTunes earlier Jon Swartz , USA TODAY 6:01 p.m. EST December 7, 2016 itunes-logo \nSAN FRANCISCO — Apple wants a happy ending to its continuing pursuit of Hollywood studios for early access to movies on iTunes. \nThe Silicon Valley company is beseeching Universal Pictures, Warner Bros. and 21st Century Fox, all of whom intend to make new movies available for home-video rental as soon as two weeks after they open in theaters, to use iTunes, according to a Bloomberg . The report cited unnamed people familiar with the talks. \nApple declined comment on the report. \nTypically, studios have given theaters a 90-day window of exclusivity before selling them online or issuing them on DVDs. Theater chains have been firm in retaining their exclusive rights. \nShould Apple land the deal, it would be a boon for iTunes, which faces heavy competition in a crowded market for movies, TV shows and music. Apple acquired Beats Music for $3 billion in 2014 to create a music-streaming service as an alternative to Spotify. \nFollow USA TODAY San Francisco Bureau Chief Jon Swartz @jswartz on Twitter.

      "text": "CURBED 's Barbara Eldredge shares Apple's latest initiative for improving Apple Maps: amassing a flock of sensor-equipped drones to fly around cities and provide instant updates on street signs, road changes, and construction projects.\nAccording to Bloomberg, the company has already received special exemption from the Federal Aviation Administration to fly drones commercially. However, the company still must comply with new rules passed in August requiring operators to have a pilot’s license, fly during daylight hours, and always keep drones visible.\nJamie Condliffe at MIT Technology Review speculates that this new drone-mapping initiative is part of Apple’s grand plan to get into the self-driving car business, arguing that drones would be able to provide highly valuable 3D scans of terrain to help navigate autonomous vehicles. Uber is already purportedly working on beefing up their own mapping system with a fleet of camera-topped cars in Mexico. Stay tuned, the competition is stiff.\nRead more >",

      "text": "US paid Apple at least $600M on foreign cash held as bonds since 2012 By Wednesday, December 07, 2016, 03:35 pm PT (06:35 pm ET) Although technically refusing to repatriate its international revenue to avoid taxes, Apple is actually keeping much of it in the U.S. in the form of bonds —and generating interest in the process, a report pointed out on Wednesday. The U.S. Treasury Department has paid Apple at least $600 million in interest during the past five years and possibly far more, according to regulatory filings seen by Bloomberg . The company is taking advantage of an exemption which lets corporations dodge or delay repatriation taxes by buying treasuries, in this case pulling in taxpayer money instead of paying liabilities. The interest is taxable, however, and Apple would also owe money if it sold the bonds. Apple is believed to be one of the biggest corporate recipients of interest from the U.S. Treasury. Cisco, for instance, has pulled in $430 million since 2012, but one of Apple's main rivals —Google —has taken in a comparatively small $150-160 million. Some companies, like Microsoft and Coca-Cola, don't provide enough detailed accounting to track these figures. Over 90 percent of Apple's $238 billion in cash reserves has been classified as \"overseas.\" The company holds $41.7 billion in U.S. bonds —while much of the rest is officially attached to its Irish subsidiaries, in reality it's being held custodial accounts with U.S. banks like J.P. Morgan Chase and State Street, simply unable to be spent unless Apple is willing to pay the taxes owed. During his election campaign, President-Elect Donald Trump promised a one-time tax holiday of 10 percent —down from the nominal 35 percent —as a way of encouraging U.S. multinationals to repatriate cash. It remains to be seen if Trump will follow through on that pledge, and critics have worried that businesses will simply direct the money to shareholders and executives, rather than spending on jobs and expansion —as happened after a 2004 tax holiday created by President George W. Bush. Topics:",

While the new additions have yet to be reflected on Apple's Support Pages document compatible single sign-on apps, tvOS and iOS versions of Watch Disney and Watch ABC now support the feature, reports The Verge . After announcing single sign-on earlier this year , and opening the service to beta testers in November , Apple launched the streaming app authentication solution on Tuesday . Currently available in the U.S., single sign-on allows pay TV subscribers to log in to multiple pay TV streaming apps on Apple TV and iOS using one set of credentials.

Just a little company from out in California somewhere. \nAnyway out of every podcast on the internet they narrowed it down to the twelve best, and only one of them was sports – Barstool’s very own Pardon My Take. Yup Big Cat and PFT Commenter and Hank and their award winning listeners have officially been recognized as the best sports podcast on the planet. Not bad. \n10 months and over 70 million downloads…over 100K Twitter followers and guests/fans from every corner of the sports and celebrity world…from the self-described “shitty” first episode featuring approximately 1,000 sound effects to the flawlessly produced 3x a week sports satire show it is today. \nUnreal what these two lunatics have been able to accomplish.

      "text": "Home / News / Mobile Phone News / Exploding iPhones in China? Not our fault, says Apple Exploding iPhones in China? Not our fault, says Apple \nby Sean Keach Read Comments \nApple has shut down rumours of exploding iPhones , blaming “external physical damage” for fires experienced by a handful of users in China. \nYesterday, a Shanghai consumer watchdog issued a report that highlighted complaints from a number of iPhone owners who claimed that their handsets had spontaneously combusted. One woman was quoted as saying that her iPhone 6S Plus exploded four months ago, shattering the screen and leaving the phone blackened. The report said: “Apple should be responsible for consumers. A large amount of consumer complaints are not solved effectively.” \nBut in a statement given to Agence France Presse, Apple says that the iPhones aren’t spontaneously combusting after all, explaining away the fires as a product of damage to the handsets. The statement reads: “The units we’ve analysed so far have clearly shown that external physical damage happened to them, which led to the thermal event.” \nIt continued: “We treat safety as a top priority and have found no cause for concern with these products.” \nApple also denied that it had been slow to respond to complaints, after the state-run Shanghai Consumer Council suggested that Apple wasn’t doing enough to address user’s concerns. The Council said that it had received a “sixfold surge” in total complaints against Apple over the past two months, according to the AFP (via Yahoo ) – although it’s not clear if all the complainants were based in China. \nIt’s no surprise that Apple has issued a statement that appears to clear the company’s name. Samsung faced a similar (but far more significant) problem this autumn, when it was forced to recall the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 just one month after it was launched. An internal investigation uncovered a battery flaw that was causing some users’ handsets to catch fire. After seemingly fixing the issue, it turned out that even repaired handsets were combusting, leading to a second and final recall. Samsung no longer manufactures the Note 7, and urges all owners of the phone to turn their devices off indefinitely. \nWatch: iPhone 7 Plus review \nHave you experienced any problems with your iPhone?

      "text": "  @08:25PM from the comfort-of-your-home dept. Apple is talking with Hollywood studios to try and get iTunes rentals of movies that are still playing on the big screen . According to a report from Bloomberg, \"some studio executives have been pushing to allow home rentals as early as two weeks after theatrical debuts and are considering a deal with iTunes as one option.\" Bloomberg reports: The most recent talks are part of longer-running efforts by Cupertino, California-based Apple to get new movies sooner, two of the people said. Such an arrangement could help iTunes stand out in a crowded online market for movies, TV shows and music. While the iTunes store helped Apple build a dominant role in music retailing, the company hasn't carved out a similar role in music and video streaming. Hollywood studios typically give theaters exclusive rights to new movies for 90 days or more before issuing them on DVD or making them available for online purchase. One of the concerns about iTunes is whether it will be a secure platform for delivering movies that are still in theaters, the people said. While Apple encrypts iTunes video files so they can't easily be duplicated, it's possible to use a camera to record a movie playing on a TV screen. A leak of picture that's still in theaters would jeopardize returns for the studios and cinema owners.",

      "text": "\nAccording to reports by Bloomberg , Apple wants to start providing high-priced early movie rentals to its users. Already in talks with 20th Century Fox, Warner Bros., and Universal Picture, Apple could be bringing movies to iTunes as soon as two weeks after being released into theaters at a charge of $25 USD to $50 USD. Though the move will disrupt the already tense relationship studios have with theater chains, Apple hopes this will push them further ahead from the likes of Netflix and Amazon.\nStudios currently give theater chains exclusive rights to new films for 90 days. However, with theater attendance trending downwards, this new strategy could help to increase revenue. Also, studios hope that the earlier access to films will stop pirating of content since iTunes already encrypts its content. As release windows shrink, movies will eventually be made available to audiences sooner, so Apple is smart to be jumping in.\nClick here to view full gallery at Hypebeast.com \n\n",

      "text": "A trial over a patent dispute between Apple and a Chinese phone maker opened Wednesday in Beijing.\nApple and Beijing-based phone retailer Zoomflight are suing the Beijing Intellectual Property Bureau and Chinese phone maker Baili after the bureau demanded Apple and Zoomflight stop sales of Apple’s iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus models for alleged patent infringement, Xinhua cited the Beijing Intellectual Property Court as saying.\nPreviously, Baili accused Zoomflight of selling the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus models, which Baili claimed had infringed on the patent of its 100C phone models.\nThe bureau ruled in favour of Baili in May but Apple and Zoomflight appealed against the ruling.\nDuring the Wednesday trial, the plaintiffs and defendants debated about whether the bureau had gone against legal procedures in the process leading up to the ruling.\nThe trial lasted about seven hours. The court will announce its verdict at a later date.\nIANS \nThe post Apple sues Chinese phone maker Baili, after Beijing IP bureau demands stopping iPhone sales appeared first on Tech2 .",
