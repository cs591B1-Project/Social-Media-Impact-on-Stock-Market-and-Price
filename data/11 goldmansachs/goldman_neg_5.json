      "text": "Donald Trump's Treasury Secretary Pick Is A Hedge Funder And 2nd-Generation Goldman Sachs Partner He's topping off the swamp. 11/29/2016 06:40 pm ET | Updated 2 hours ago 1.9k Ben Walsh Business Reporter, The Huffington Post \nDonald Trump said the system is rigged. He said hedge fund managers are “ getting away with murder .” He said that he’d “ tax Wall Street .” He called Washington D.C. corrupt and promised to “drain the swamp.” He said his opponent Hillary Clinton was too cozy with the banks, as epitomized by her closed-door paid speeches. He said Clinton’s vice presidential nominee, Tim Kaine, was “owned by the banks” and that he, Trump, would break them up. Trump closed his campaign with an ad bashing Goldman Sachs and George Soros, using classically anti-Semitic phrases. \nAnd now, according to The New York Times , ABC and CBS, the president-elect has chosen a second-generation Goldman Sachs partner who worked for George Soros before starting a hedge fund and buying IndyMac, a failing California bank that made billions while foreclosing on homeowners after the financial crisis. \nSteven Mnuchin’s takeover of IndyMac is a story about everything Americans have come to hate about how the financial crisis was allowed to unfold ― ordinary people panicking, savvy investors pouncing, a government guarantee that saved a bank but didn’t even try to keep people in their homes, a clever rebranding, rampant foreclosures, billions of dollars in profits. And now, the cruel punchline: The man behind it is being nominated for treasury secretary by a self-proclaimed billionaire populist. \nMnuchin got the idea to invest in IndyMac when he saw TV news footage of panicked customers at ATMs, Bloomberg’s Max Abelson and Zachary Mider reported . “ This bank is going to end up failing, and we need to figure out how to buy it. … I’ve seen this game before,” Mnuchin said at the time, according to Abelson and Mider. \nAnd so, i n 2008, during the depths of the financial crisis, Mnuchin’s fund ― along with Soros, Trump-supporting hedge fund billionaire John Paulson and other investors ― scooped up IndyMac for $1.6 billion. After renaming it One West and foreclosing on thousands of homeowners it had written bad loans to, Mnuchin and his partners sold the bank for $3.4 billion in 2015. (Mnuchin now sits on the board of the company that acquired OneWest, CIT.) \nOneWest played a particularly large role foreclosing on reverse mortgages, in which generally elderly homeowners slowly sell off the equity they’ve built in their homes to fund their retirements. It made up just 17 percent of the market for these contracts, but accounted for a whopping 39 percent of all reverse mortgage foreclosures in the years following the financial crisis. \nOneWest has been accused of racist lending and business practices by housing advocacy groups. It failed to locate bank branches in minority neighborhoods, loaned money to “very few or no” people of color and did a better job maintaining and marketing foreclosed homes in mostly white neighborhoods, according to a complaint filed by two housing advocacy groups with the Department of Housing and Urban Development on Nov. 16. \nSuch discrimination, called “redlining,” keeps people of color in poverty by making it harder for them to buy homes. It was banned in 1968 under the Fair Housing Act. \nAs treasury secretary, Mnuchin would have sweeping authority over the industry he was born into and made millions working in, as well as a central role in economic policies like Trump’s proposed sweeping tax cuts. \nHe would also have to liquidate his holdings in his hedge fund in order to avoid conflicts of interest. As is also the case for the president he would serve, simply putting the fund’s current assets under a new manager is not sufficient because Mnuchin has detailed knowledge of those assets. \nHowever, it won’t be all sacrifice. Like then-Goldman Sachs CEO Hank Paulson before him, selling his assets to comply with conflict of interest rules would enable Mnuchin to defer paying capital gains taxes. \nTrump has also reportedly chosen Wilbur Ross , a billionaire private equity investor, as commerce secretary.

      "text": "Skip Ad Ad Loading... x Embed\nx Share\nSteven Mnuchin, a hedge fund manager and former Goldman Sachs executive, is President-elect Donald Trump's choice for Treasury secretary, a source told USA TODAY. Here is what we know about the 53-year-old. USA TODAY NETWORK\nBusinessman Steven Mnuchin shown arriving at Trump Tower in New York City for meetings with President-elect Donald Trump on November 17, 2016. (Photo: EDUARDO MUNOZ ALVAREZ, AFP/Getty Images)\nFrom buying a failed bank during the U.S. financial crisis to producing major movies and serving as national finance chairman for Donald Trump's presidential campaign, Steven Mnuchin has a record of winning risky bets.\nNow the former Wall Street banker is poised for what could be his biggest challenge yet: Trump's nominee for U.S. Treasury secretary.\nTrump is expected to officially name Mnuchin, 53, as his choice for the nation's top financial policy job as soon as Wednesday, a source close to Trump's transition team told USA TODAY Tuesday. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because officials were not authorized to speak publicly about selections.\nTo associates and friends who were surprised when accepted Trump's invitation to serve as lead campaign fundraiser after the New York presidential primary, Mnuchin offered a potentially prescient explanation.\n“Nobody’s going to be like, ‘Well, why did he do this?’ if I end up in the administration,\" he told Bloomberg Businessweek in August.\nThe news that Mnuchin is Trump's pick came as reports swirled that Trump would nominate billionaire Wilbur Ross, also considered a risk taker, to serve as Commerce secretary. Ross, 79, made a career out of buying ailing companies in sometimes troubled sectors on the cheap, restructuring them and then selling them for billions of dollars. Ross, too, could be announced as early as Wednesday, the source close to the transition team said.\nTrump has praised Mnuchin, who with the Republican National Committee helped raise tens of millions of dollars for the billionaire businessman's winning campaign over Hillary Clinton. However, they weren't always the best of friends.\nIn a 2008 lawsuit, Trump targeted one of Mnuchin's companies in a lawsuit that alleged Deutsche Bank and other investors improperly balked at extending multi-million dollar construction loans on the Trump International Hotel and Tower in Chicago. The case was ultimately settled.\nMnuchin, a twice-married father of three, is a Yale College graduate who followed his father to renowned U.S. investment bank Goldman Sachs. He started at the financial powerhouse in the 1980s and spent 17 years there, amassing a fortune and becoming an executive vice president of the New York City-based company before his 2003 departure.\nHis next stop was ESL International, the hedge fund founded by Edward Lampert, one of Mnuchin's Yale roommates and another Goldman alumnus who is now the CEO and chairman of Sears Holdings. Lampert tapped him for a board seat on Sears Holdings-owned retail chain Kmart in 2003. However, Mnuchin left soon afterward to become chief executive of SFM Capital Managment, a fund backed by international financier and investor George Soros.\nMnuchin's SFM tenure was similarly brief. In 2004, he co-founded private hedge fund Dune Capital Management with Daniel Neidich, another former Goldman executive. The fund invested in equities and real estate — including some Trump projects.\nAdditionally, the fund invested in the U.S. movie industry. Starting in 2006, Mnuchin reached a three-year deal in which an entity called Dune Entertainment agreed to invest $500 million in a string of 20th Century Fox movies, according to multiple media reports.\nThe transaction launched a deeper Mnuchin dive into entertainment investments and co-producing that ultimately included the Hollywood blockbuster success Avatar , The X-Men franchise, American Sniper , Gravity and The Lego Movie . Those films scored box office wins. Yet other movies that involved Mnuchin, such as Our Brand is Crisis , a fictional account of American campaign strategists involved in a Bolivian election, flopped.\nIn 2013, Mnuchin, filmmaker Brett Ratner and Australian businessman James Packer joined in an entity called RatPac-Dune Entertainment that agreed to $300 million in co-financing for as many as 75 films by Warner Bros. Pictures, according to the movie company and media reports.\nThe following year, Mnuchin partnered with Ryan Kavanaugh and an investment group to buy debt and an equity stake in Kavanaugh's Relativity Media. He also took a seat on the Relativity board of directors, becoming the company's non-executive chairman.\n\"Steven has been a trusted advisor for years, and I personally recruited him to join our board,\" Kavanaugh said in a statement at the time. \"he brings an unrivaled perspective on the every-increasing value of content in Hollywood and Wall Street.\"\nThe move also ended up snarling Mnuchin in controversy.\nFive years before taking the Relativity post, he led an investor group that bought California-based IndyMac Bank, which had collapsed in a more than $7 billion implosion during the financial crisis. The investor group, which paid the FDIC roughly $1.55 billion to take the bank off the FDIC's hands, was backed by Soros, hedge fund manager John Paulson, computer manufacturer Michael Dell, private equity investor Christopher Flowers and others.\nIndyMac became OneWest Bank, with Mnuchin as its chairman. The deal drew criticism because it was finalized before FDIC Chair Sheila Bair managed to institute a change that would require private equity buyers like the Mnuchin-led group to maintain a 10% leverage ratio at newly-resurrected banks and hold the investments for at least three years.\nBair, now the president of Washington College, declined to comment for this story. However, recounting the IndyMac collapse and sale in Bull By the Horns , her 2012 book about her FDIC tenure, Bair characterized the regulator as boxed in.\n\"The reality is that those who are brave enough to buy distressed companies in a down market — whether banks or any other type of company — expect to make a return commensurate with the risks they are taking,\" wrote Bair. \"The FDIC, as seller, had no good options.\"\nFile photo taken in 2009 shows a New York City building bearing the logo of the CIT Group. (Photo: Seth Wenig, AP)\nNew criticism — and lawsuits — came after Relativity Media sought federal bankruptcy court protection in July 2015. By then, Mnuchin had left the movie company's board. And he was weeks away from selling OneWest Bank to CIT Group at a price that produced a hefty profit for him and fellow investors — $3.4 billion in cash and stock, more than doubling their investment.\nOne of Relativity Media's creditors, RKA Film Financing, took a cynical view of Mnuchin's dual involvement with the movie company and the bank — which was also owed millions by Relativity.\nIn a 2016 New York Supreme Court lawsuit, RKA said Relativity's collapse \"amounted to a classic Ponzi scheme,\" and labeled its CEO Kavanaugh \"a con man.\"\nMnuchin had held \"a unique position,\" the lawsuit alleged, \"affording him knowledge of both Relativity's precarious financial position and the ability to ensure certain creditors — namely OneWest Bank — were able to siphon away funds that had been commingled\" with RKA's investments.\nThe lawsuit also charged that OneWest swept approximately $50 million from Relativity's bank accounts before the collapse.\nA bankruptcy court declaration by Timothy Coleman, a Blackstone expert who worked with Relativity on restructuring plans, said the OneWest transfers \"further strained\" the movie company's \"already problematic liquidity situation,\" and also forced postponement of some film projects.\nThe movies included Masterminds , which features Zach Galifianakis, Kristen Wiig and other actors in a comedy based on an actual bank robbery. The film ultimately opened on Sept. 30 this year.\nA Mnuchin court filing called his inclusion in RKA's lawsuit \"not just baseless, but sanctionable.\" He moved to throw out the case, as did Kavanaugh. Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Charles Ramos dismissed the lawsuit in an October decision that left the door open for the complaint to be updated and refiled.\nBenjamin Naftalis, an attorney for RKA, said the company \"plans to file an amended complaint that will continue to include Mr. Mnuchin.\"\nThough Mnuchin is best known publicly for his business dealings, he and his family also became known as some of the thousands of investors caught up in the aftermath of Bernard Madoff's notorious Ponzi scheme.\nMore than $3 million that Mnuchin and his brother inherited from their deceased mother's estate represented fictitious profits from Madoff's estimated $20 billion scam, court-appointed trustee Irving Picard alleged in a 2010 bankruptcy court filing. But a court decision said the family's withdrawals, and similar Madoff payouts to other investors, had occurred more than two years before the scheme collapsed.\nAs a result, the money could not legally be recovered to help repay the disgraced financier's less fortunate customers, the court ruled.\nAlthough Mnuchin so far has emerged relatively unscathed from several court challenges, a new federal complaint filed after Trump's win potentially could become a factor in Senate confirmation hearings for the Treasury post.\nOneWest was criticized by some housing advocates over a wave of foreclosures filed amid the financial crisis.\nAdditionally, the bank, its successor, CIT Bank, and CIT Group were targeted this month with a new federal complaint that alleged they engaged in redlining and other discrimination against minorities. Two groups that advocate for fair housing and equal access to credit filed the complaint with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.\nUSA TODAY\nBank tied to Trump adviser accused of discrimination\n\"Our analysis of OneWest suggests the bank has no significant branch presence in communities of color, and not surprisingly, its home loans to borrowers and communities of color are low in absolute terms, low compared to its peer banks, and low when compared to what one would expect given the size of the Asian-American, African-American and Latino populations in California,\" said Kevin Stein, a deputy director for the California Reinvestment Coalition, one of the groups that filed the complaint.\nIn response, CIT Group said it is \"committed to fair lending and works hard to meet the credit needs of all communities and neighborhoods we serve.\"\nMnuchin did not respond to USA TODAY interview requests submitted to a company spokesman. However, Trump's presidential transition staff provided a statement in which former OneWest chief executive Joseph Otting said the bank \"remained committed to fair lending and meeting the credit needs of all borrowers in its communities, including those in distress.\"\nStein said the allegations submitted to HUD should be examined during Mnuchin's expected confirmation hearings.\n\"It was not our intent in filing the case. But it should be considered,\" said Stein. \"The American people would want a Treasury secretary who understands the lives of ordinary people and how they interact with major financial institutions.\"\nRay Locker and Paul Davidson contributed.\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Kevin McCoy on Twitter: @kmccoynyc\nSkip Ad Ad Loading... x Embed\nx Share\nTRUMP IN TRANSITION Mnuchin: What we know about Trump's pick for Treasury | 0:52 Steven Mnuchin, a hedge fund manager and former Goldman Sachs executive, is President-elect Donald Trump's choice for Treasury secretary, a source told USA TODAY.

      "text": "By Liz Hoffman\nHeading into the 2016 presidential election, most executives on Wall Street would have said one thing was certain no matter who won: The next Treasury secretary wouldn't come from Goldman Sachs Group Inc.\nThat reflected the view that Goldman was so tainted in the public mind by the financial crisis that none of its alumni could be floated, much less confirmed, to top government positions.\nLike so much other conventional wisdom, that has now proved to be wrong. President-elect Donald Trump is set to name Steven Mnuchin , a Goldman alum, as Treasury secretary.\nMr. Mnuchin worked at the company for 17 years. Most of his time was spent in Goldman's mortgage-trading business in the early 1990s, though he also oversaw its internet strategy, which resulted in a flopped online wealth-brokerage effort in the early 2000s.\nMr. Mnuchin made partner in 1994, the same class that produced Goldman's current No. 2, Gary Cohn. Mr. Cohn met with Mr. Trump Tuesday.\nIf Mr. Mnuchin is confirmed as Treasury secretary, he will be the third former Goldman banker to hold the position in less than 25 years. Robert Rubin served in this role in President Bill Clinton's second term and Henry Paulson Jr. occupied the spot in President George W. Bush's second term and brought Goldman banker Robert Steel along as his deputy.\nWhile the firm's critics have pointed to its extensive ties to government as a sign of Wall Street's outsize influence, Goldman partners have long viewed public service as an important coda to a finance career.\nAnd the firm's government ties extend well beyond the Treasury.\nWilliam Dudley, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, spent a decade as a Goldman's chief economist. Joshua Bolten, a legal- and regulatory-affairs executive at Goldman in the 1990s, served as President George W. Bush's chief of staff, and Steve Friedman, who was among the Goldman partners who rang the New York Stock Exchange bell at the bank's 1999 debut, served as a senior economic counselor in that administration. Gary Gensler, head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission under President Barack Obama, was one of the youngest bankers ever named a partner at Goldman.\nGoldman's government reach isn't confined to the U.S. Bank of England Gov. Mark Carney, who was previously head of Canada's central bank, was a Goldman banker for 13 years in its London, Tokyo, New York and Toronto offices.\nEuropean Central Bank President Mario Draghi was a vice chairman and managing director in the firm's international business from 2002 to 2005.Goldman advisers and former employees have served as governors of the central banks of Australia, Greece and South Africa.\nThe funnel that has sent Goldman executives to Washington dates to the bank's longtime leader, Sidney Weinberg. Mr. Weinberg, who ran Goldman for more than three decades and oversaw its rise from scrappy second-tier firm to the investment-banking elite, was a supporter and close friend of President Lyndon Johnson, to whom he recommended several men to key cabinet posts.\nHis influence in the White House elevated Goldman's status in Washington, a position it solidified during the 1990s and early 2000s.\nThat Goldman is again back at the pinnacle of the U.S. government is a stunning turnaround from the drubbing its image took during the financial crisis. Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein and other executives were hauled before Congress over trades involving complex financial instruments that were believed to have fueled the financial meltdown.\nIn 2010, Goldman became the face of Wall Street and the crisis thanks to a damning article in Rolling Stone. The magazine called Goldman \"a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like money.\"\nIn the wake of that, Goldman, which long focused only on its reputation with clients, undertook steps to burnish its public image. It boosted its philanthropic efforts, which now support women entrepreneurs and small businesses. Today, Goldman has a consumer bank and weekly podcasts.\n\"We try not to be tone-deaf and we listen closely,\" Mr. Blankfein said recently when asked about his firm's reputation. \"It's not in as low ebb as it was in the heart of the financial crisis [but] it's still low ebb. We have to work on that and we know that.\"\n 29, 2016 20:48 ET (01:48 ",

      "text": "President-elect Donald Trump will name longtime banker and former Goldman Sachs executive Steven Mnuchin as Treasury secretary, turning to a campaign loyalist and fundraiser for the incoming administration's top economic cabinet post, a transition official said Tuesday.\nMr. Mnuchin built his career sniffing out undervalued assets and converting them into massive profits. But perhaps his greatest trade just came in the political arena.\nMr. Mnuchin, 53, a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. banker turned Hollywood financier, parlayed a six-month stint as Donald Trump's campaign finance chair into the president-elect's pick to be Treasury secretary.\nMr. Mnuchin's Wall Street pedigree presents a contrast with the populist themes Mr. Trump struck in his campaign, railing against big banks and vowing to close tax loopholes that benefit hedge funds. Mr. Trump also repeatedly attacked his rivals in the primary and general elections for their Wall Street ties, especially those connected to Goldman Sachs.\nMr. Mnuchin's links to the world of high finance, in particular Goldman, go back to before he was born. His father, Robert Mnuchin, started at Goldman in 1957 and spent his entire Wall Street career at the firm. The elder Mr. Mnuchin was among those who pioneered block trading, the buying or selling of large numbers of shares at once. Steven's brother Alan also worked at Goldman.\n\"He's a person of great integrity,\" the elder Mr. Mnuchin said of his son. \"[We] expect he will do a good job in this very exciting and demanding position.\"\nIf confirmed by the Senate as Treasury secretary, Mr. Mnuchin will join a list of prominent bankers who made similar moves from Wall Street to Washington, including two of his former bosses at Goldman, Henry Paulson and Robert Rubin, who were both top Goldman executives before running Treasury.\nDespite his successful Wall Street career, Mr. Mnuchin has no experience running a massive organization—the Treasury Department has 86,000 employees—or in economic or financial policy-making. The biggest entity Mr. Mnuchin has run was the technology division of Goldman, which had over 5,000 employees.\nMr. Mnuchin's acquaintances describe him as smart, with several people calling him \"nerdy.\" He regularly attends New York philanthropic galas. He has long held high-profile positions on charity boards and is a former director of the Whitney Museum of American Art. At an event for New York charity City Harvest in 2006, Mr. Mnuchin and his ex-wife were photographed with Mr. Trump. Mr. Mnuchin is now engaged to Scottish actress Louise Linton.\nMr. Mnuchin joined Goldman in 1985. He worked in the fixed-income department, eventually overseeing trading in mortgages, U.S. government, money market and municipal bonds. He made partner in 1994. Mr. Mnuchin later became the firm's chief information officer.\nWhen Goldman converted into a publicly traded company in 1999, Mr. Mnuchin, like other partners, made millions. He later bought a 6,500-square-foot apartment in 740 Park Avenue, a storied Manhattan co-op built by Jackie Kennedy's grandfather that is known as the \"billionaires' building.\"\nAt a recent conference, Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein called Mr. Mnuchin a \"highflier, a partner at a young age. He did very well. He is a smart, smart guy.\"\nIn 2002, Mr. Mnuchin left Goldman and later was hired to run a credit fund set up by billionaire George Soros.\nIn 2004, Mr. Mnuchin and two former Goldman colleagues founded hedge fund Dune Capital Management LP with financial backing from Mr. Soros. Dune soon expanded into the entertainment business, striking up a film-financing deal with a unit of 21st Century Fox. Among the films Dune financed was \"Avatar,\" one of the all-time box office hits.\n21st Century Fox and News Corp, parent company of The Wall Street Journal, share common ownership.\nIn 2008, IndyMac Bank in Pasadena, Calif., collapsed in one of the largest bank failures in U.S. history. Mr. Mnuchin led a group of investors, including funds run by Mr. Soros and other hedge-fund and private-equity titans, who bought it from the government for about $1.5 billion. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation agreed to cover a portion of any future loan losses, a lucrative arrangement for Mr. Mnuchin and his partners. Regulators who negotiated with Mr. Mnuchin found him to be the kind of detail-oriented person who would \"know the cost of every pencil,\" according to a person familiar with their thinking.\nMr. Mnuchin, who became chairman of the renamed OneWest Bank and CEO of its parent company, relocated to Los Angeles and bought a mansion in the Bel Air neighborhood.\nThe deal soon became controversial. In 2011, community activists descended on Mr. Mnuchin's Bel Air home to protest over the possible eviction of a homeowner who was behind on her mortgage payments to OneWest.\nIn 2014, OneWest was sold to CIT Group Inc., earning Mr. Mnuchin and Dune hundreds of millions of dollars in profits, according to a person familiar with the matter. He later pocketed $10.9 million in severance payouts when he left the company.\nDespite the huge profits, OneWest's legacy continues to trail Mr. Mnuchin, who now sits on CIT's board and owns more than 1% of its shares.\nA portion of OneWest's mortgage business is under investigation by the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Last July, CIT said it was forced to take a $230 million charge as it cleaned up accounting problems at OneWest. And two California housing groups this month accused OneWest of discriminating against minorities by not putting branches in their communities.\nMeanwhile, 14 years after leaving Goldman, Mr. Mnuchin remains in the firm's orbit, showing up at alumni events and involving other ex-Goldman executives in his finance deals.\nHe has continued to work those angles as Mr. Trump's finance chairman, a post he assumed in May. Mr. Mnuchin negotiated a joint fundraising agreement with the Republican National Committee, easing the way for major donors to give both to the party and to Mr. Trump. The committee's chairman, Lewis Eisenberg, is a Goldman veteran and contemporary of Mr. Mnuchin's father.\nWrite to Anupreeta Das at anupreeta.das@wsj.com and Rachel Louise Ensign at rachel.ensign@wsj.com\n 29, 2016 18:55 ET (23:55 ",

By Lauren Stephenson | November 29, 2016 \nPresident-elect Donald Trump is expected to nominate former Goldman Sachs executive Steven Mnuchin to become secretary of the treasury. \nMnuchin also served as the Trump campaign's finance chairman. \nWhile the pick has been expected, it might come as a surprise to some of Trump's supporters who liked the president-elect's populist messaging and attacks on Hillary Clinton's ties to Wall Street.

Mnuchin spent 17 years at Goldman Sachs before leaving the bank, eventually co-founding hedge fund Dune Capital Management, which has financed numerous films. He has a cameo in the recently released Warren Beatty film \" Rules Don't Apply ,\" which he also produced . Dune Capital has also done several real estate deals with Trump. Trump even sued Dune Capital in 2008, according to Bloomberg . The Senate will need to confirm Mnuchin, and pointed questions about at least one of his ventures will likely come up.

      "text": "By Caroline Baum, MarketWatch\nExpectations for faster growth have tightened money, but that's not a bad thing\nEver since Donald Trump's surprise election victory on Nov. 8, financial markets have been telegraphing a collective sense of optimism about future economic growth. The major U.S. stock indexes set new records, the dollar soared and the yield on Treasury securities rose across the curve.\nBefore you get too excited about the prospect for the economy to reach escape velocity after seven and one-half years of 2% growth, the financial press is warning that such optimism may contain the seeds of its own destruction.\n\"Higher rates and a stronger dollar are making money tighter,\" according to the Nov. 15 edition of the Wall Street Journal (http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2016/11/15/money-is-getting-tighter-in-elections-wake/).\n\"Financial conditions are tightening at an alarming pace,\" warned a Nov. 15 headline on the popular ZeroHedge blog (http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-11-15/market-wrong-financial-conditions-are-tightening-alarming-pace).\nPfff! Just like that, those Masters of the Universe deal a blow to any anticipated stimulative effect from Trump's proposed reduction in tax rates and regulations, and increased spending on infrastructure and defense. Both articles cite a sudden rise, or tightening, in the Goldman Sachs Financial Conditions Index, which has been at the forefront of the economics profession's we-can-index-it craze.\nThe idea of a financial conditions index makes perfect sense on the surface. The central bank tightens or loosens monetary policy, which in turn affects an array of financial variables, which then act to transmit policy changes to the real economy. So far so good.\nThe problem lies with the interpretation: imputing a fixed meaning to a change in price. (Trigger warning: Get ready for a brief economics lesson.)\nThe price of any good, service or financial asset may vary because of a change in demand or a change in supply, (https://13ecohghs.wikispaces.com/file/view/demand.gif/140485877/demand.gif) with very different implications. Yet in the GSFCI, all changes are created equal. Lower long-term interest rates equate to easier financial conditions; higher long rates represent a tightening.\nConsider the case where long-term interest rates, a proxy for the price of credit, rise because the public decides to save less and spend more. Demand for credit pushes up the price (https://13ecohghs.wikispaces.com/file/view/demand.gif/140485877/demand.gif) of credit, which, as reflected in the GSFCI, constitutes tighter financial conditions and a harbinger of weaker demand in the future! If that were really the case, bond traders would be Masters of the Universe -- and not only in a work of fiction.\nAlternatively, higher prices may be the result of a reduction in supply (http://www.economicsonline.co.uk/How%20markets%20work%20graphs/S-shifts-to-L.png), in which case the effect would be negative.\nThis is one of the most basic, important and widely misunderstood concepts in economics. Only a handful of economists understand the application of microeconomic theory to the real world. One of them is Scott Sumner, director of the program on monetary policy at George Mason University's Mercatus Center, who expresses what I've been talking about as a simple rule: \"Never reason from a price change.\"\n\"Reflexively, I am not opposed to indexes: leading indicators, a yield spread -- as long as they are properly constructed,\" Sumner says. \"Anything involving interest rates or exchange rates would be very problematic in terms of price change.\"\nTherein lies the rub. An index or a rule removes discretion from decision-making. In some cases, such as the conduct of monetary policy, this may be a good thing. But when the components of an index require judgment to determine whether a change in the price will have a positive or negative effect, it defeats the purpose of an index.\nGoldman's economics team has retooled its FCI over the years in an effort to improve its predictive powers. In its latest reincarnation, the weighting for the long-term Treasury yield has been increased to 45.1%, the biggest among the five GSFCI components. So it matters a great deal whether the Treasury yield enters the index with a positive or negative sign. (The other four components are the federal funds rate, the trade-weighted dollar, the S&P 500 Index and an investment-grade credit spread.)\nGoldman confirmed in a note to clients this week that the main drivers of the recent tightening in the GSFCI have been rising Treasury yields and a stronger dollar, both of which appear to signal expectations for stronger economic growth. Yet both moves constitute tighter financial conditions, as calculated by the GSFCI.\nAs to Goldman's claim that the GSFCI has \"substantial predictive power for growth,\" the evidence doesn't seem to support it.\nThe GSFCI set an all-time high (higher = tighter financial conditions) in June 1982, shortly before the end of a 16-month recession in November of that year. The economy was about to take off. Real growth a (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.png?g=bWYH)veraged 6.4% in the next two years, including four quarters of growth in excess of 8%. Predictive? Hardly.\nThe GSFCI shot up again in 1984, coming close to the previous high. Growth averaged 3.7% in the four quarters following that peak.\nThe GSFCI registered an all-time low in December 1999, coincident with the peak of the tech bubble. The index was still accommodative (below 100) when the economy fell into recession in March 2001. The yield curve had been inverted for almost a year, a sure sign that policy was tight. Yet in mid-2000, based on the GSFCI, Goldman economists expected the Federal Reserve to raise the funds rate by an additional 100 basis points from its 6.5% level at the time.\nInstead, the Fed started slashing its benchmark rate aggressively in January 2001, lowering it to 1.75% by year-end.\nOne more observation: The GSFCI set another cycle peak in October 2002, again just as the economy was set to take off. Economic growth in the ensuring four quarters averaged 4.4%.\nGoldman economists were unavailable to comment on the seeming contradiction between their claims about the index's predictive powers and the data. At a neutral reading of 100.13 this week, the GSFCI is hardly emitting the kind of red alerts reflected in the financial press.\nThen again, the historical performance of the GSFCI taken in conjunction with the large weighting for Treasury yields and the flawed methodology of reasoning from a price change (see Sumner Rule above) tell me a yellow, cautionary warning is in order. Not because of the current tightening of financial conditions, but because the index suffers from some incurable flaws.\n-Caroline Baum; 1751ET\n ",

      "text": "By Anupreeta Das\nPresident-elect will name longtime banker and former Goldman Sachs executive Steven Mnuchin as Treasury secretary, turning to a campaign loyalist and fundraiser for the incoming administration's top economic cabinet post, a transition official said Tuesday.\nMnuchin built his career sniffing out undervalued assets and converting them into massive profits. But perhaps his greatest trade just came in the political arena.\nSee also: What to expect from Tom Price, President-elect Trump's pick for HHS Secretary (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/what-to-expect-from-tom-price-president-elect-trumps-pick-for-hhs-secretary-2016-11-29)\nMnuchin, 53, a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. banker turned Hollywood financier, parlayed a six-month stint as Donald Trump's campaign finance chair into the president-elect's pick to be Treasury secretary.\nSee also: Trump to name Wilbur Ross as commerce secretary (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/trump-to-name-wilbur-ross-as-commerce-secretary-2016-11-29)\nMnuchin's Wall Street pedigree presents a contrast with the populist themes Mr. Trump struck in his campaign, railing against big banks and vowing to close tax loopholes that benefit hedge funds. Mr. Trump also repeatedly attacked his rivals in the primary and general elections for their Wall Street ties, especially those connected to Goldman Sachs.\nMnuchin's links to the world of high finance, in particular Goldman, go back to before he was born. His father, Robert Mnuchin, started at Goldman in 1957 and spent his entire Wall Street career at the firm. The elder Mnuchin was among those who pioneered block trading, the buying or selling of large numbers of shares at once. Steven's brother Alan also worked at Goldman.\n\"He's a person of great integrity,\" the elder Mnuchin said of his son. \"[We] expect he will do a good job in this very exciting and demanding position.\"\nAn expanded version of this report appears at WSJ.com (http://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-plans-to-name-steven-mnuchin-as-treasury-secretary-1480459950?Mod=MKTW).\n-Anupreeta Das; 415-439-6400; AskNewswires@dowjones.com\nRELATED: CNN buys Casey Neistat's video app Beme (http://www.wsj.com/articles/cnn-buys-casey-neistats-video-app-beme-1480353128?mod=trending_now_1)\nRELATED: Donald Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner could face his own conflict-of-interest questions (http://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trump-son-in-law-could-face-his-own-conflict-of-interest-questions-1480377903?mod=trending_now_5)\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n11-29-16 1847ET\n ",

      "title": "Goldman Sachs at Center of Politics, Money and Public Furor Once Again",
      "text": "By Liz Hoffman\nHeading into the 2016 presidential election, most executives on Wall Street would have said one thing was certain no matter who won: The next Treasury secretary wouldn't come from Goldman Sachs Group Inc.\nThat reflected the view that Goldman was so tainted in the public mind by the financial crisis that none of its alumni could be floated, much less confirmed, to top government positions.\nLike so much other conventional wisdom, that has now proved to be wrong. President-elect Donald Trump is set to name Steven Mnuchin , a Goldman alum, as Treasury secretary.\nMr. Mnuchin worked at the company for 17 years. Most of his time was spent in Goldman's mortgage-trading business in the early 1990s, though he also oversaw its internet strategy, which resulted in a flopped online wealth-brokerage effort in the early 2000s.\nMr. Mnuchin made partner in 1994, the same class that produced Goldman's current No. 2, Gary Cohn. Mr. Cohn met with Mr. Trump Tuesday.\nIf Mr. Mnuchin is confirmed as Treasury secretary, he will be the third former Goldman banker to hold the position in less than 25 years. Robert Rubin served in this role in President Bill Clinton's second term and Henry Paulson Jr. occupied the spot in President George W. Bush's second term and brought Goldman banker Robert Steel along as his deputy.\nWhile the firm's critics have pointed to its extensive ties to government as a sign of Wall Street's outsize influence, Goldman partners have long viewed public service as an important coda to a finance career.\nAnd the firm's government ties extend well beyond the Treasury.\nWilliam Dudley, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, spent a decade as a Goldman's chief economist. Joshua Bolten, a legal- and regulatory-affairs executive at Goldman in the 1990s, served as President George W. Bush's chief of staff, and Steve Friedman, who was among the Goldman partners who rang the New York Stock Exchange bell at the bank's 1999 debut, served as a senior economic counselor in that administration. Gary Gensler, head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission under President Barack Obama, was one of the youngest bankers ever named a partner at Goldman.\nGoldman's government reach isn't confined to the U.S. Bank of England Gov. Mark Carney, who was previously head of Canada's central bank, was a Goldman banker for 13 years in its London, Tokyo, New York and Toronto offices.\nEuropean Central Bank President Mario Draghi was a vice chairman and managing director in the firm's international business from 2002 to 2005.Goldman advisers and former employees have served as governors of the central banks of Australia, Greece and South Africa.\nThe funnel that has sent Goldman executives to Washington dates to the bank's longtime leader, Sidney Weinberg. Mr. Weinberg, who ran Goldman for more than three decades and oversaw its rise from scrappy second-tier firm to the investment-banking elite, was a supporter and close friend of President Lyndon Johnson, to whom he recommended several men to key cabinet posts.\nHis influence in the White House elevated Goldman's status in Washington, a position it solidified during the 1990s and early 2000s.\nThat Goldman is again back at the pinnacle of the U.S. government is a stunning turnaround from the drubbing its image took during the financial crisis. Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein and other executives were hauled before Congress over trades involving complex financial instruments that were believed to have fueled the financial meltdown.\nIn 2010, Goldman became the face of Wall Street and the crisis thanks to a damning article in Rolling Stone. The magazine called Goldman \"a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like money.\"\nIn the wake of that, Goldman, which long focused only on its reputation with clients, undertook steps to burnish its public image. It boosted its philanthropic efforts, which now support women entrepreneurs and small businesses. Today, Goldman has a consumer bank and weekly podcasts.\n\"We try not to be tone-deaf and we listen closely,\" Mr. Blankfein said recently when asked about his firm's reputation. \"It's not in as low ebb as it was in the heart of the financial crisis [but] it's still low ebb. We have to work on that and we know that.\"\n 20:48 ET (01:48 ",

      "text": "  Steve Holland NEW YORK   on Tuesday chose a former Goldman Sachs banker and a billionaire investor to steer economic policy in his administration and a fierce Obamacare critic to dismantle President Barack Obama’s signature heathcare program. Trump, a Republican, is expected to name Steven Mnuchin, a former   financier,   said, putting     2002 to launch a hedge fund, served as Trump’s campaign finance chairman. Billionaire investor Wilbur Ross, known for his investments in distressed industries, is expected to be named commerce secretary, a source said. The announcements could come as early as Wednesday. The flurry of picks showed Trump, a real estate tycoon with no governing experience, rewarding loyalists and established Washington veterans as he rounds out his circle of top advisers. Republican U.S. Representative Tom Price, an orthopedic surgeon from Georgia, will be Trump’s health and human services secretary, and Seema Verma, the founder of a health policy consulting company, will lead the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which is part of Health and Human Services and oversees government health programs for the poor and the elderly and insurance standards. Trump also announced his choice of Elaine Chao, labor secretary under President George W. Bush, to serve as secretary of transportation, saying in a statement that her expertise would be an asset “in our mission to rebuild our infrastructure.” While Trump made decisions on his economic team, he continued to mull over who should serve as his top diplomat. He dined with former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, a one-time critic, at a French restaurant in New York on Tuesday night. DISMANTLING OBAMACARE Trump cast Price and Verma as a “dream team” to help him once he takes office on Jan. 20 with his campaign pledge to repeal Obamacare, the health law formally known as the Affordable Care Act. Since its enactment in 2010, it has been a target of Republican attacks. Price has characterized Obamacare as “doing real harm to American families” and has co-sponsored legislation to replace it. Verma helped Pence, the Indiana governor, add conservative pieces to Medicaid coverage for the state’s poor by requiring beneficiaries to make contributions to health savings accounts. She also worked on Medicaid programs in Iowa, Ohio, Kentucky and Tennessee. Chuck Schumer, the incoming Senate Democratic leader, was among the defenders of Obamacare who criticized Price’s selection. “Nominating Congressman Price to be the HHS secretary is akin to asking the fox to guard the hen house,” Schumer said. The 2010 healthcare overhaul, aimed at expanding insurance coverage to millions more Americans, triggered a long, bitter fight between the White House and congressional Republicans, who said it created unwarranted government intervention in personal healthcare and private industry. Trump has said he will replace Obamacare with a plan to give states more control over Medicaid and allow insurers to sell plans nationally. Both Price and Verma will need Senate confirmation. Congressional approval will be needed to repeal and change the health law. White House spokesman Josh Earnest defended Obamacare on Tuesday, saying it had expanded coverage to millions of Americans, boosted consumer protections and shored up the finances of the Medicare program for the elderly. “We’ll see if Trump care measures up,” he said. Trump said after meeting with Obama following his Nov. 8 election victory that he would consider keeping the provisions of the healthcare law that let parents keep adult children up to age 26 on their insurance policies and that bar insurers from denying coverage to people with pre-existing medical conditions. Price, an early Trump supporter in the U.S. House of Representatives who leads the budget committee, has proposed a plan that would create age-based tax credits for people who buy insurance coverage on their own. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said on Tuesday the eventual congressional plan to replace Obamacare would likely have much in common with Price’s ideas. Price’s plan would also roll back the 2010 law’s expansion of Medicaid for low-income people, a change that helped Obamacare cut the number of uninsured Americans to 29 million in 2015 from 49 million in 2010. Trump vowed on the campaign trail to “save” Medicare, but Democrats said Price’s plans could amount to privatizing the government program for the elderly. Price has endorsed converting Medicare from a program that covers set benefits to a voucher-style program to help people buy coverage. “We say to Republicans who want to privatize Medicare: Go try it. Make our day,” Schumer said on Tuesday, saying the change would be unpopular with the public. Democrats also criticized the pick because Price has supported barring federal funds for Planned Parenthood, which provides some abortions in addition to birth control, health exams and other services. Trump has met with about 70 people as he looks to shape his White House and Cabinet team. Chao, his pick for transportation secretary, was the first Asian-American woman to hold a Cabinet position, as labor secretary. She is married to Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Trump saw retired General David Petraeus, a potential candidate for the State Department or the Pentagon, on Monday. On Tuesday, he met with Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Corker and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, as well as Romney, are in the running for secretary of state. Trump is set to launch a “thank you tour” to states he won in the election, starting with a rally on Thursday in Cincinnati, aides said.

      "text": "President-elect Donald Trump will name longtime banker and former Goldman Sachs executive Steven Mnuchin as Treasury secretary, turning to a campaign loyalist and fundraiser for the incoming administration's top economic cabinet post, a transition official said Tuesday.\nMr. Mnuchin built his career sniffing out undervalued assets and converting them into massive profits. But perhaps his greatest trade just came in the political arena.\nMr. Mnuchin, 53, a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. banker turned Hollywood financier, parlayed a six-month stint as Donald Trump's campaign finance chair into the president-elect's pick to be Treasury secretary.\nMr. Mnuchin's Wall Street pedigree presents a contrast with the populist themes Mr. Trump struck in his campaign, railing against big banks and vowing to close tax loopholes that benefit hedge funds. Mr. Trump also repeatedly attacked his rivals in the primary and general elections for their Wall Street ties, especially those connected to Goldman Sachs.\nMr. Mnuchin's links to the world of high finance, in particular Goldman, go back to before he was born. His father, Robert Mnuchin, started at Goldman in 1957 and spent his entire Wall Street career at the firm. The elder Mr. Mnuchin was among those who pioneered block trading, the buying or selling of large numbers of shares at once. Steven's brother Alan also worked at Goldman.\n\"He's a person of great integrity,\" the elder Mr. Mnuchin said of his son. \"[We] expect he will do a good job in this very exciting and demanding position.\"\nIf confirmed by the Senate as Treasury secretary, Mr. Mnuchin will join a list of prominent bankers who made similar moves from Wall Street to Washington, including two of his former bosses at Goldman, Henry Paulson and Robert Rubin, who were both top Goldman executives before running Treasury.\nDespite his successful Wall Street career, Mr. Mnuchin has no experience running a massive organization—the Treasury Department has 86,000 employees—or in economic or financial policy-making. The biggest entity Mr. Mnuchin has run was the technology division of Goldman, which had over 5,000 employees.\nMr. Mnuchin's acquaintances describe him as smart, with several people calling him \"nerdy.\" He regularly attends New York philanthropic galas. He has long held high-profile positions on charity boards and is a former director of the Whitney Museum of American Art. At an event for New York charity City Harvest in 2006, Mr. Mnuchin and his ex-wife were photographed with Mr. Trump. Mr. Mnuchin is now engaged to Scottish actress Louise Linton.\nMr. Mnuchin joined Goldman in 1985. He worked in the fixed-income department, eventually overseeing trading in mortgages, U.S. government, money market and municipal bonds. He made partner in 1994. Mr. Mnuchin later became the firm's chief information officer.\nWhen Goldman converted into a publicly traded company in 1999, Mr. Mnuchin, like other partners, made millions. He later bought a 6,500-square-foot apartment in 740 Park Avenue, a storied Manhattan co-op built by Jackie Kennedy's grandfather that is known as the \"billionaires' building.\"\nAt a recent conference, Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein called Mr. Mnuchin a \"highflier, a partner at a young age. He did very well. He is a smart, smart guy.\"\nIn 2002, Mr. Mnuchin left Goldman and later was hired to run a credit fund set up by billionaire George Soros.\nIn 2004, Mr. Mnuchin and two former Goldman colleagues founded hedge fund Dune Capital Management LP with financial backing from Mr. Soros. Dune soon expanded into the entertainment business, striking up a film-financing deal with a unit of 21st Century Fox. Among the films Dune financed was \"Avatar,\" one of the all-time box office hits.\n21st Century Fox and News Corp, parent company of The Wall Street Journal, share common ownership.\nIn 2008, IndyMac Bank in Pasadena, Calif., collapsed in one of the largest bank failures in U.S. history. Mr. Mnuchin led a group of investors, including funds run by Mr. Soros and other hedge-fund and private-equity titans, who bought it from the government for about $1.5 billion. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation agreed to cover a portion of any future loan losses, a lucrative arrangement for Mr. Mnuchin and his partners. Regulators who negotiated with Mr. Mnuchin found him to be the kind of detail-oriented person who would \"know the cost of every pencil,\" according to a person familiar with their thinking.\nMr. Mnuchin, who became chairman of the renamed OneWest Bank and CEO of its parent company, relocated to Los Angeles and bought a mansion in the Bel Air neighborhood.\nThe deal soon became controversial. In 2011, community activists descended on Mr. Mnuchin's Bel Air home to protest over the possible eviction of a homeowner who was behind on her mortgage payments to OneWest.\nIn 2014, OneWest was sold to CIT Group Inc., earning Mr. Mnuchin and Dune hundreds of millions of dollars in profits, according to a person familiar with the matter. He later pocketed $10.9 million in severance payouts when he left the company.\nDespite the huge profits, OneWest's legacy continues to trail Mr. Mnuchin, who now sits on CIT's board and owns more than 1% of its shares.\nA portion of OneWest's mortgage business is under investigation by the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Last July, CIT said it was forced to take a $230 million charge as it cleaned up accounting problems at OneWest. And two California housing groups this month accused OneWest of discriminating against minorities by not putting branches in their communities.\nMeanwhile, 14 years after leaving Goldman, Mr. Mnuchin remains in the firm's orbit, showing up at alumni events and involving other ex-Goldman executives in his finance deals.\nHe has continued to work those angles as Mr. Trump's finance chairman, a post he assumed in May. Mr. Mnuchin negotiated a joint fundraising agreement with the Republican National Committee, easing the way for major donors to give both to the party and to Mr. Trump. The committee's chairman, Lewis Eisenberg, is a Goldman veteran and contemporary of Mr. Mnuchin's father.\nWrite to Anupreeta Das at anupreeta.das@wsj.com and Rachel Louise Ensign at rachel.ensign@wsj.com\n 18:55 ET (23:55 ",

      "text": "Steven Mnuchin is the first person with extensive Wall Street experience to head the Treasury since his former boss, Henry Paulson (Reuters) President-elect Donald Trump is expected to name former Goldman Sachs partner and Hollywood financier Steven Mnuchin as his nominee for Treasury secretary, a source said on Tuesday, putting a Wall Street veteran in the top U.S. economic Cabinet post.\nMnuchin, who was Trump’s presidential campaign finance chairman, could be named as early as Wednesday, said a Republican source close to the decision.\nMnuchin was chosen over several high-profile candidates, including JPMorgan Chase Chairman Jamie Dimon and Republican US Representative Jeb Hensarling, chairman of the powerful House Financial Services Committee.\nMnuchin is the first person with extensive Wall Street experience to head the Treasury since his former boss, Henry Paulson, the former Goldman Sachs chief executive who served under President George W. Bush and steered Treasury through the chaotic initial stages of the 2008-2009 financial crisis.\nThe current Treasury secretary, Jack Lew, worked for two years at Citigroup but has spent most of his career in government or academia.\nThe selection of Mnuchin was first reported by The New York Times.\nA relatively little-known but successful private equity investor and hedge fund manager, Mnuchin spent 17 years at Goldman Sachs before leaving in 2002, when he launched Dune Capital Management.\nWith Dune, Mnuchin has invested in movies produced by Rupert Murdoch’s 20th Century Fox and Time Warner Inc’s Warner Bros, including blockbusters “Avatar,” “Mad Max: Fury Road” and “Suicide Squad.”\nACQUIRED FAILED BANK\nThe son of a Goldman Sachs partner who became an art dealer, Mnuchin worked hard to step outside his father’s shadow and make a name for himself, former colleagues said, rising to become the firm’s chief information officer in 1999.\n“He wanted to prove that he was there on the merits,” said a former Goldman colleague, who spoke on condition of anonymity.\nMnuchin’s experience running Goldman’s mortgage-backed bond trading desk would later prove valuable when an opportunity arose in 2009 to buy the deeply discounted assets of failed California mortgage lender IndyMac Bank from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation during the financial crisis.\nHe assembled an investor group that included hedge fund manager John Paulson to buy the assets for $1.55 billion, and moved to Los Angeles.\nAfter rebranding the operation OneWest Bank, Mnuchin built it with other assets and professional sports team sponsorships into Southern California’s largest bank, with 73 branches and $23 billion in assets. His group sold OneWest to CIT Group Inc last year for $3.4 billion.\nThe bank came under fire for its foreclosure practices as housing advocacy groups accused it of being too quick to foreclose on struggling homeowners. In 2011, dozens of demonstrators descended on Mnuchin’s $26.5 million home in the wealthy Bel Air neighborhood to protest OneWest’s eviction tactics, according to the Los Angeles Times.\nThis month, two housing groups filed a complaint asking the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to investigate complaints that OneWest engaged in discriminatory “redlining” practices against black and Latino communities.\nMnuchin must be confirmed by the Senate and the top Democrat on the chamber’s Finance Committee signaled he may be in for tough questioning.\n“Given Mr. Mnuchin’s history of profiting off the victims of predatory lending, I look forward to asking him how his Treasury Department would work for Americans who are still waiting for the economic recovery to show up in their communities,” Democratic Senator Ron Wyden said in a statement.\nAlthough Mnuchin has a reputation for being a behind-the-scenes player in Hollywood, he appears on screen in the 2016 film “Rules Don’t Apply,” according to the IMDB movie database. The drama, which opened in theaters on Nov. 23, stars Warren Beatty, who also wrote and directed the film.",

      "text": "The OPEC meeting at Vienna is seeing some bumps. Here are some targets from Goldman Sachs, regardless of the results: \nHere is their view, courtesy of eFXnews: \nOPEC members will meet in Vienna on Wednesday, November 30 to discuss a potential output cut. The latest headlines suggest that, while there is a broad agreement on the rationale for a cut, political considerations and country level quota negotiations are so far preventing a deal from being reached. As a result, it will likely take intense negotiations on Wednesday before a decision is made. Subject to the usual modelling caveats, our work suggests that, as of Monday’s close, Brent futures are reflecting a 30% chance of a deal being reached, with Brent near-dated implied volatility pricing in a $6/bbl move on Wednesday, five times the daily implied moves for other trading days. \nIf an OPEC production cut to 32.5 mb/d deal is reached, we would expect prices to rally to the low $50s/bbl , with observed implementation required to push prices further. At the historical compliance to announced production cuts, this would be the equivalent of realized 1H2017 OPEC production of 33.0 mb/d and a Russia freeze, which would warrant $55/bbl oil prices in 1H2017 and backwardation by 2Q2017. \nIf no deal is reached, our expectation of rising inventories through 1H2017 would warrant prices averaging $45/bbl through next summer . Of course, the absence of a deal would likely exacerbate the initial sell-off given the unwind of net speculative positioning and with a large option open interest around the $40/bbl strike potentially exacerbating a move below that level. However, with the market in our view only pricing in a 30% probability of a deal being reached and the option market pricing in a $6/bbl move, we believe that a move to below $40/bbl would be difficult to sustain. \nThis suggests that price risk is likely skewed to the upside heading into Wednesday. \nFor lots more FX trades from major banks, sign up to eFXplus \nBy signing up to eFXplus via the link above, you are directly supporting Forex Crunch.",

      "text": "Shutterstock photo\nPresident-elect Donald Trump will name longtime banker and former Goldman Sachs executive Steven Mnuchin as Treasury secretary, turning to a campaign loyalist and fundraiser for the incoming administration's top economic cabinet post, a transition official said Tuesday.\nMr. Mnuchin, 53, played a behind-the-scenes role in Mr. Trump's election, helping oversee the creation of a network of small donors that let the campaign compete successfully against the better-funded Hillary Clinton operation.\nMr. Mnuchin's longtime Wall Street ties—his father spent his entire career at Goldman—make him a traditional pick for the Treasury spot. But the choice is at odds with Mr. Trump's message that economic and political elites have left the country damaged. Still, his establishment profile may sit more comfortably with the Republicans in the Senate, which decides whether to confirm the nominee.\nThe president-elect also is expected to name Wilbur Ross Jr. as his Commerce secretary nominee, a transition official said Tuesday, selecting a fellow businessman.\nAlso on Tuesday, Mr. Trump selected candidates for two other cabinet agencies: former Labor Secretary\nElaine Chao at Transportation, and Rep. Tom Price (R., Ga.) as Health and Human Services secretary.\nThe choice of Mr. Mnuchin is a contrast to another figure who had been considered, Rep. Jeb Hensarling, a tea-party favorite. He's a free-market Republican from Texas who is chairman of the House Financial Services Committee and has been a key advocate of overturning the Dodd-Frank financial-overhaul law.\nMr. Trump, who has mostly populated his administration with supporters, would be getting in Mr. Mnuchin someone with a history of donating more money to Democrats than Republicans. He nonetheless signed onto Mr. Trump's campaign and took the post of national finance chairman, to the chagrin of some top Clinton fundraisers.\nIf confirmed by the Senate, Mr. Mnuchin will join a list of prominent bankers who made similar moves from Wall Street to Washington, including two of his former bosses at Goldman, Henry Paulson and Robert Rubin, who were both top Goldman executives before joining the department.\nThe Treasury secretary is the chief navigator of the nation's economy, overseeing the collection of taxes, the imposition of foreign sanctions, managing the public debt and serving as the chief connection between the administration and the financial markets and the business community.\nIn a sense, Mr. Mnuchin and Mr. Trump have now both taken chances on each other.\nWhen Mr. Mnuchin signed on to the Trump campaign, some of Hillary Clinton's major fundraisers said they were stunned and annoyed.\nMr. Mnuchin has given mostly to Democrats in recent years. He gave the maximum $2,300 to Mrs. Clinton's presidential primary bid in 2007. When her campaign failed, he donated the maximum to then-Sen. Barack Obama's presidential run. Mr. Mnuchin also has given to several other Democratic presidential campaigns over the years, including those of John Edwards, John Kerry and Al Gore.\nMr. Trump elevated Mr. Mnuchin to national finance chairman and has leaned heavily on him during the transition. Now Mr. Trump is taking his loyalty to Mr. Mnuchin a giant step further, giving him control over broad swaths of the nation's economy. When Mr. Trump is sworn in Jan. 20, the success of his presidency will rest as much in Mr. Mnuchin's hands as those of any other presidential appointee.\nUncertainty still surrounds the most prestigious cabinet post: secretary of state. Filling the position has become a high-drama affair that has left Mr. Trump's team divided. A pair of top candidates met privately with Mr. Trump on Tuesday: U.S. Sen. Bob Corker, a Tennessee Republican who is chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee; and Mitt Romney, a former Republican presidential nominee who feuded with Mr. Trump during the GOP primaries this year.\nSome Trump aides have said Mr. Romney's outspoken opposition during the race should disqualify him from getting a plum cabinet post, but Mr. Trump has kept Mr. Romney under active consideration. The two met for dinner together on Tuesday night at the Trump International Hotel & Tower in Mr. Romney's second meeting with the president-elect.\nAfter the dinner, Mr. Romney sounded a note of contrition, saying he thinks \"you're going to see America continue to lead the world in this century. What I've seen through these discussions I've had with President-elect Trump, as well as what we've seen in his speech the night of his victory, as well as the people he's selected as part of his transition, all of those things combined give me increasing hope that President-elect Trump is the very man who can lead us to that better future.\"\nA former Massachusetts governor, Mr. Romney made an ill-fated foreign trip during his unsuccessful presidential bid in 2012. He met with leaders in the U.K., Israel and Poland and spoke publicly about top foreign-policy concerns such as Iran and Israeli-Palestinian peace.\nThe most memorable moment of his trip, however, was his statement in London suggesting the city wasn't ready to host the Olympics. The comment from Mr. Romney, who rescued the financially troubled 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, drew a searing rebuke from the city's then-mayor, Boris Johnson. Mr. Johnson is now the U.K.'s foreign minister and would be Mr. Romney's counterpart if he becomes secretary of state.\nYet Mr. Romney is now seen as pinpointing early on one of the biggest looming collisions on the world stage: the U.S. and Russia.\nDuring the 2012 campaign Mr. Romney said Russia was the biggest geopolitical threat facing the U.S. President Barack Obama and his aides laughed at the GOP nominee, saying his remark showed how little he understood about the world.\nMr. Corker, meantime, said his meeting with Mr. Trump Tuesday was \"an honor.\"\n\"We had a very wide ranging meeting, actually a couple meetings and his instincts on foreign policy are obviously very, very good,\" he said.\nHe added: \"I know he has a number of outstanding individuals that he's talking with. I was glad to be here and glad to see more fully some of what his views about the world are.\"\nTwo weeks after the election, Mr. Trump is making appointments at a swifter pace than prior administrations.\nMany candidates have been arriving at Trump Tower in full view of the news media, disappearing into the gold elevators for their interviews with Mr. Trump, and then reappearing in the lobby to offer their views to the media.\nPassing through the lobby Tuesday afternoon was Vice President-elect Mike Pence, who told reporters to \"stay tuned\" for more appointments. \"It's going to be a busy week,\" Mr. Pence said.\nHe added: \"I think the American people are seeing the leadership and the energy that our president-elect is going to bring to the White House.\"\nThe picks announced Tuesday extend an olive branch from Trump Tower to Capitol Hill. Mr. Price is a close ally—and friend—of House Speaker Paul Ryan (R., Wis.) Ms. Chao, who served as labor secretary for all eight years of Republican President George W. Bush's administration, is married to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.).\nMr. Price, if confirmed by the Senate, will preside over an agency that likely would try to dismantle President Barack Obama's signature health-care overhaul assuming congressional Republicans repeal the law.\nAfter a postelection period holed up at various Trump properties in New York, New Jersey and Florida, Mr. Trump is about to embark on a campaign-style \"thank you\" tour of states that were crucial to his victory.\nHis first stop will be a sports arena in Cincinnati on Thursday, his transition team said. He will be joined at the rally by Mr. Pence, who is also scheduled to hold an event in New Orleans on Saturday.\nMichael C. Bender, Carol E.

The data issued Tuesday by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. showed strength in the banking industry more than eight years after the financial crisis struck. However, the impact of low oil prices on energy companies led banks to continue to post bigger losses on commercial and industrial loans. Some energy companies have struggled to repay loans, causing distress for banks in oil and gas producing regions. The FDIC reported that U.S. banks earned $45.6 billion in the third quarter, up from $40.4 billion a year earlier. Almost 61 percent of banks reported an increase in profit from a year earlier. Only 4.6 percent of banks were unprofitable, down from 5.2 percent in the third quarter of 2015 and the lowest percentage since the third quarter of 1997. The FDIC said net interest income increased by $10 billion, or 9.2 percent, from a year earlier. As a sign of a healthy banking industry, the interest income earnings were boosted by a $112 billion, or 1.2 percent, increase in lending in the third quarter. The largest increases came in mortgage lending and credit cards. FindTheCompany | Graphiq The volume of commercial and industrial loans that were written off in the third quarter jumped by $946 million, or 82.7 percent. Despite the relatively strong quarter, the banking industry \"faces continued challenges,\" FDIC Chairman Martin Gruenberg said at a news conference. He noted the sustained period of low interest rates in recent years which has crimped banks' profit margins on loans. Gruenberg added that \"banks must position themselves for rising interest rates going forward.\" Since the surprise election of Donald Trump , long-term interest rates have climbed, propelled largely by investors' belief that his plan to cut taxes and spend massively on roads, bridges, airports and other infrastructure could ignite inflation. When they foresee rising inflation, bond investors demand higher long-term rates and pay lower prices for bonds. Banks could earn more interest on loans. On Wall Street, the anticipation of higher rates has helped push up prices of bank stocks — in some cases, to their loftiest levels in years. Also stoking the rise are expectations that regulations affecting the banking industry will be eased in a Trump administration. More immediately, Federal Reserve policymakers are expected to raise the central bank's benchmark rate at their Dec. 13-14 meeting for the first time in nearly a year. Fed Chair Janet Yellen recently told Congress that the case for a rate boost has \"continued to strengthen.\" She also indicated that the election of Trump hasn't changed Fed thinking on the timing of the next rate increase. Gruenberg has said that higher interest rates could be \"a double-edged sword\" for the banking industry. While bringing in more interest on loans, it also could increase the cost for banks to borrow to fund the loans they make. The number of banks on the FDIC's confidential \"problem list\" fell to 132 from 147 in the second quarter. The 132 banks requiring special monitoring by the agency's examiners is the smallest number in more than seven years and is down sharply from the peak of 888 problem banks in the first quarter of 2011. The number of bank failures continues to slow. So far this year, five banks have failed. Eight had been shuttered by this time last year. Failures declined from 24 in 2013 to 18 in 2014 and only eight last year. They are down sharply from 157 in 2010 — the most in one year since the height of the savings and loan crisis in 1992. Normally in a strong economy, an average of four or five banks closes annually. The decline in bank failures has allowed the deposit insurance fund to strengthen. The fund, which turned from deficit to positive in the second quarter of 2011, had an $80.7 billion balance at the end of September, according to the FDIC. That was up from $77.9 billion at the end of June. The FDIC was created during the Great Depression to insure bank deposits. It monitors and examines the financial condition of U.S. banks. The agency guarantees deposits up to $250,000 per account. Gruenberg, who was appointed by President Barack Obama , said Tuesday he intends to remain as chairman of the independent agency in the Trump administration, to complete his term that expires in November 2017. Other federal financial regulators are likely to be replaced by people chosen by Trump. The chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Mary Jo White , already has said that she will leave office at the end of the Obama administration in January. The new officials appointed by Trump are likely to lean toward softer regulation of Wall Street and the financial industry. Latest News Video ",

      "text": "President-elect Donald Trump is expected to name former Goldman Sachs partner and Hollywood financier Steven Mnuchin as his nominee for Treasury secretary, a source said on Tuesday, putting a Wall Street veteran in the top U.S. economic Cabinet post. \nMnuchin, who is Jewish and was Trump's presidential campaign finance chairman , could be named as early as Wednesday, said a Republican source close to the decision. \nMnuchin was chosen over several high-profile candidates, including JPMorgan Chase Chairman Jamie Dimon and Republican U.S.\nRepresentative Jeb Hensarling, chairman of the powerful House Financial Services Committee. \nMnuchin is the first person with extensive Wall Street experience to head the Treasury since his former boss, Henry Paulson, the former Goldman Sachs chief executive who served under President George W. Bush and steered Treasury through the chaotic initial stages of the 2008-2009 financial crisis. \nThe current Treasury secretary, Jack Lew, worked for two years at Citigroup but has spent most of his career in government or academia. \nThe selection of Mnuchin was first reported by The New York Times. \nA relatively little-known but successful private equity investor and hedge fund manager, Mnuchin spent 17 years at Goldman Sachs before leaving in 2002, when he launched Dune Capital Management. \nWith Dune, Mnuchin has invested in movies produced by Rupert Murdoch's 20th Century Fox and Time Warner Inc's Warner Bros, including blockbusters \"Avatar,\" \"Mad Max: Fury Road\" and \"Suicide Squad.\" \n\n'Predatory loans'  \nThe son of a Goldman Sachs partner who became an art dealer, Mnuchin worked hard to step outside his father's shadow and make a name for himself, former colleagues said, rising to become the firm's chief information officer in 1999. \n\"He wanted to prove that he was there on the merits,\" said a former Goldman colleague, who spoke on condition of anonymity. \nMnuchin's experience running Goldman's mortgage-backed bond trading desk would later prove valuable when an opportunity arose in 2009 to buy the deeply discounted assets of failed California mortgage lender IndyMac Bank from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation during the financial crisis. \nHe assembled an investor group that included hedge fund manager John Paulson to buy the assets for $1.55 billion, and moved to Los Angeles. \nAfter rebranding the operation OneWest Bank, Mnuchin built it with other assets and professional sports team sponsorships into Southern California's largest bank, with 73 branches and $23 billion in assets. His group sold OneWest to CIT Group Inc last year for $3.4 billion. \nThe bank came under fire for its foreclosure practices as housing advocacy groups accused it of being too quick to foreclose on struggling homeowners. In 2011, dozens of demonstrators descended on Mnuchin's $26.5 million home in the wealthy Bel Air neighborhood to protest OneWest's eviction tactics, according to the Los Angeles Times. \nThis month, two housing groups filed a complaint asking the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to investigate complaints that OneWest engaged in discriminatory \"redlining\" practices against black and Latino communities. \nMnuchin must be confirmed by the Senate and the top Democrat on the chamber's Finance Committee signaled he may be in for tough questioning. \n\"Given Mr. Mnuchin's history of profiting off the victims of predatory lending, I look forward to asking him how his Treasury Department would work for Americans who are still waiting for the economic recovery to show up in their communities,\" Democratic Senator Ron Wyden said in a statement. \nAlthough Mnuchin has a reputation for being a behind-the-scenes player in Hollywood, he appears on screen in the 2016 film \"Rules Don't Apply,\" according to the IMDB movie database. The drama, which opened in theaters on Nov. 23, stars Warren Beatty, who also wrote and directed the film. \nReuters\n\nReuters   Reuters   Reuters\n  NEW!    Reuters \nSend me email alerts Want  ",

At 0632 GMT, Brent was trading at 47.80 per barrel.\nAt an assumed cut to 32.5 million barrels per day, Goldman Sachs told clients in the note the Brent market was pricing in a 30 percent probability of a deal being reached, with a $6 per barrel move the implied volatility on Wednesday.\nIn the absence of a deal, the bank warned, rising inventories through the first half of next year would mean prices averaging $45 per barrel through next summer.\nSource: Reuters (Reporting by Apeksha Nair in BENGALURU; Editing by Kenneth Maxwell)",

      "text": "U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is expected to name former Goldman Sachs partner and Hollywood financier Steven Mnuchin as his nominee for Treasury secretary and billionaire investor Wilbur Ross to head the Commerce Department, according to Republican sources.\nThe following is a list of Republican Trump’s selections for top jobs in his administration:\nTreasury Secretary: Steven Mnuchin \nMnuchin, 53, is a relatively little-known but successful private equity investor, hedge fund manager and Hollywood financier who spent 17 years at Goldman Sachs before leaving in 2002. He assembled an investor group to buy a failed California mortgage lender in 2009, rebranded it as OneWest Bank and built it into Southern California’s largest bank. The bank came under fire for its foreclosure practices as housing advocacy groups accused it of being too quick to foreclose on struggling homeowners.\nCommerce Secretary: Wilbur Ross \nRoss, 78, heads the private equity firm, W.L. Ross & Co. His net worth was pegged by Forbes at about $2.9 billion. A staunch supporter of Trump and an economic adviser, Ross has helped shape the Trump campaign’s views on trade policy, blaming the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico and the 2001 entry of China into the World Trade Organization for causing massive U.S. factory job losses.\nTransportation Secretary: Elaine Chao \nChao, 63, was labor secretary under President George W. Bush for eight years and the first Asian-American woman to hold a Cabinet position. Chao is a director at Ingersoll Rand, News Corp and Vulcan Materials Company. She is married to U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican from Kentucky.\n \nHealth and Human Services Secretary: U.S. Representative Tom Price \nPrice, 62, is an orthopedic surgeon who heads the House of Representatives’ Budget Committee. A representative from Georgia since 2005, Price has criticized Obamacare and has championed a plan of tax credits, expanded health savings accounts and lawsuit reforms to replace it. He is opposed to abortion.\nU.S. Ambassador to the United Nations: Governor Nikki Haley \nHaley, a 44-year-old Republican, has been governor of South Carolina since 2011 and has little experience in foreign policy or the federal government. The daughter of Indian immigrants, Haley led a successful push last year to remove the Confederate battle flag from the grounds of the South Carolina state capitol after the killing of nine black churchgoers in Charleston by a white gunman.\nEducation Secretary: Betsy DeVos \nDeVos, 58, is a billionaire Republican donor, a former chair of the Michigan Republican Party and an advocate for the privatization of education. As chair of the American Federation for Children, she has pushed at the state level for vouchers that families can use to send their children to private schools and for the expansion of charter schools.\nU.S. Attorney General: U.S. Senator Jeff Sessions \nSessions, 69, was the first U.S. senator to endorse Trump’s presidential bid and has been a close ally since. The son of a country-store owner, the senator from Alabama and former federal prosecutor has long taken a tough stance on illegal immigration, opposing any path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.\nNational Security Adviser: Retired Lieutenant General Michael Flynn \nFlynn, 57, was an early supporter of Trump and serves as vice chairman on his transition team. He began his U.S. Army career in 1981 and served deployments in Afghanistan and Iraq. Flynn became head of the Defense Intelligence Agency in 2012 under President Barack Obama, but retired a year earlier than expected, according to media reports, and became a fierce critic of Obama’s foreign policy.\nCIA Director: U.S. Representative Mike Pompeo \nPompeo, 52, is a third-term congressman from Kansas who serves on the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee, which oversees the CIA, National Security Agency and cyber security. A retired Army officer and Harvard Law School graduate, Pompeo supports the U.S. government’s sweeping collection of Americans’ communications data and wants to scrap the nuclear deal with Iran.",

Handgun license sold separately.\nFor his gym bag Birddogs For the first time, I’ve decided to recycle a gift idea from last year’s list, mostly because I’ve never had so much positive feedback on any recommendation before. An investment banker / HBS alum poached Lululemon’s head of men’s design and started Birddogs ($55), the most comfortable shorts I’ve ever experienced.

Throw in this La Mer Skincare Set ($140), some sweat-resistant, wireless JLab Epic2 Earbuds ($99), and a Survival & Cross jump rope ($10).\nFor his library Amazon Barnes & Noble blamed poor earnings on the election, but it’s time that we make reading great again. Book of the year for me is “ Diary of an Oxygen Thief ” ($9), an anonymously self-published dark satire that became a bestseller from word-of-mouth alone. Other notable picks include Liam Vaughan and Gavin Finch’s “ The Fix: How Bankers Lied, Cheated and Colluded to Rig the World's Most Important Number ” ($33), Richard Betts’ “ The Essential Scratch and Sniff Guide to Becoming a Wine Expert ” ($13), Bronwen Dickey’s “ Pit Bull: The Battle over an American Icon ” ($18), and the book that, to the chagrin of literary elite, will be a #1 bestseller, Tim Ferriss’s “ Tools of Titans ” ($17).\nFor his closet Instagram Men hate receiving clothes as gifts; we hate the obligation of having to wear something we probably don’t like. But, there are some things that never occur to us to buy, like quality undershirts! Go with NVSBL ($27) - they’re longer (stay tucked), more comfortable, sweat and odor fighting, and totally invisible. Hygiene and aesthetics aside, they also significantly prolong the life of a dress shirt. And swim trunks! Because board shorts are simply not acceptable after college. These Thorsun Fan ($275) shorts provide an injection of American-made European elegance in the pool. Finally, a James Perse bathrobe ($395), because I’m still using the robe I stole from a hotel five years ago.\nFor his competitive spirit Pickett Rich people and poor people love the same things: cheese as a meal, taxidermy, getting married at home, day drinking, eating pigeons and rabbits, having too many kids, living in a hotel, taking financial handouts from the government, and of course, drinking games. Every man needs this Jaques Of London croquet set ($5,000), a Pickett lizard skin backgammon board ($2,485), and an Asprey lambskin Scrabble set ($11,950). If not, no sweat, the Hasbro sets ($14) from your local Walmart work just as well.\nFor his dreams Down & Feather Co. Why do people always talk about splurging on an expensive mattress and sheets, and then forget about the lowly pillow? Considering 30% of the average pillow’s weight is dead skin cells and dust mites, it’s time to for all of us upgrade with some Snuggle Soft goose down pillows ($500) or the more affordable, and highly-rated Miracle Bamboo Pillow ($53).\nFor his midlife crisis Bonhams I’ll put up with the “small hands” jokes to be behind the wheel of any of these classics hitting the auction block in December: A 1973 Porsche 911S Targa ($200,000), 1988 Ferrari 328 GTS ($180,000), 1971 Maserati Ghibli Coupé ($300,000), 1957 Mercedes-Benz 300SL Roadster ($1,400,000), or the more affordable modern classic, the 2011 Mercedes-Benz SLS ($140,000).\nFor his kitchen Sertodo Copper Next to fly fishing and golf, cooking is the best therapy I know, provided that drinking is involved and that I don’t have to clean up after. Here are a few things most men would appreciate, but not otherwise think of: slick Cutipol Goa cutlery ($1,600) or a Sertodo hammered copper ice bucket ($255). And while there’s a waiting list for Bob Kramer’s forged meteorite knives, the Kramer 10” Damascus Chef’s knife ($450) paired with a John Boos butcher’s block cutting board ($464) is almost as nice.\nFor his conscience Linley Order some Berry Bros. & Rudd Bordeaux blend ($510). Proceeds from each case will support five children in the Room to Read literacy program for an entire year. And since it is Christmas, you might as well add an Asprey crystal wine decanter ($1,600) or the David Linley Girih spirit decanter ($810).\nFor his inner child Amazon Donald Trump won. Men don’t have to hide their childish propensities and politically incorrect humor anymore. Load up his stocking with Liquid Ass ($8), an NSFW egg mold ($8), a cat-shaped magnet ($13), or a Russian roulette water balloon ($17)\nSEE ALSO: The unofficial Goldman Sachs holiday gift guide for 2015 More: Features GSElevator Holidays",

The confirmations came on CNBC’s “Squawk Box.” \nMnuchin is a 17-year-veteran of Goldman Sachs and was an early supporter of Trump.“I did this because I believed in him,” Mnuchin said Wednesday morning. Story Continued Below \nRoss is a billionaire who earned his fortune in private equity and is known for r estructuring companies in struggling industries . \n“Wilbur and I are going to work very closely together,” Mnuchin said. \nIncoming White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus said Wednesday morning that both men are going to be \"in lockstep\" with Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence's vision. \n\"I mean, there’s just no question about it,\" Priebus said on MSNBC. \"They wouldn't be offered a position if they didn't follow suit with the exact things that President Trump wanted. In fact, Steve Mnuchin was part of writing that hundred-day plan and that speech that Donald Trump gave a few weeks ago about what the first 100 days would be like.”",

      "text": "Goldman Sachs at Center of Politics, Money and Public Furor Once Again (WSJ) \nHeading into the 2016 presidential election, most executives on Wall Street would have said one thing was certain no matter who won: The next Treasury secretary wouldn’t come from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Like so much other conventional wisdom, that has now proved to be wrong. President-elect Donald Trump is set to name Steven Mnuchin, a Goldman alum, as Treasury secretary. \nTrump to Outline Plans for ‘Leaving My Great Business’ Dec. 15 (BBG) \nHe’ll leave his business “in total,” he said in a series of tweets. “While I am not mandated to do this under the law, I feel it is visually important, as President, to in no way have a conflict of interest with my various businesses.” \nSteven Mnuchin, Expected Treasury Pick, Is an Outsider to Public Policy (NYT) \nUp until the last several weeks, Mr. Mnuchin — an entrepreneur, a Wall Street investor and a Hollywood producer — would have appeared an unlikely choice for the position made famous by Alexander Hamilton. Over his business career, he was never particularly involved in politics, nor did he publicly express an interest in public policy. He never ran a large organization or showed himself to be an accomplished economist. \n\nSleazy treasurer left Westchester Trump Tower a financial mess: suit (NYP) \nFrank Palazzolo, a real estate investor who was named one of the city’s 10 worst landlords by a former city housing commissioner, used the condo’s funds as his own personal “piggy bank” and covered his tracks with fake account statements, according to a suit brought by the condo board on Monday. \nEurope’s share of investment bank fees falls to all-time low (FT) \nThomson Reuters’ data shows that Europe, the Middle East and Asia (EMEA) accounts for just 24 per cent of the global fees for M&A deals, syndicated loans and underwriting paid so far this year. That’s the lowest since Thomson Reuters began collecting the data in 2000 and just a shade ahead of the 23 per cent of fees generated in Asia so far in 2016. \nThis Activist Built One of the Foundations of Passive Investing (BBG) \nArt Lipson couldn’t have picked two more distinct ways to shake up the bond market. Back in 1973, Lipson first made a name for himself by creating the bond index that grew into the Lehman Brothers Family of Indices. Now the Bloomberg Barclays Indices, they’re the benchmarks for many of the world’s largest fixed-income mutual funds. Among the funds that track them are those of Vanguard Group, the pioneer of low-cost indexing as an alternative to higher-fee active strategies. \nRBS Must Add $2.5 Billion in Capital After Failing BOE Stress Test (WSJ) \nRBS, still 73%-government owned since bailouts in 2008 and 2009, will outline a new strategic plan early next year as it continues to face headwinds from low interest rates and potentially vast fines from U.S. authorities over the sale of toxic mortgage-backed securities. The plan should raise more than the £2 billion capital shortfall identified by the Bank of England. \nHunter S Thompson’s widow plans to clone and sell his marijuana stash (CNBC) \nAnita Thompson, who married Hunter in 2003 two years before his suicide, said in a post on her Facebook page that she had found a legal method to extract the DNA from the author’s personal marijuana and hashish stash that she had saved for 12 to 15 years.

      "text": "Source: courtesy of Jon Ogg Monday’s small stock market sell-off was followed by small gains on Tuesday, and the markets were indicated higher on Wednesday morning before the opening bell. This week we have seen stronger GDP revisions and stronger consumer confidence in the United States, and now we have the highest euro area inflation (just 0.6%) seen in two years. Investors have proven at every opportunity that they will buy stocks on any real pullbacks, and those same investors are also looking for new ideas to generate gains or income.\n24/7 Wall St. reviews dozens of analyst reports each day of the week to find new investing and trading ideas for its readers. Some of these analyst research reports cover stocks to buy, and other calls cover stocks to sell or avoid.\nThese are the top analyst upgrades, downgrades and initiations seen on Wednesday morning:\nArrowhead Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ: ARWR) just imploded, as shares are down a whopping 61% at $1.70 after a $4.39 close on news that it is halting some core drug development to focuses its resources on subcutaneous and extra-hepatic RNAi therapeutics. The stock was downgraded to Hold from Buy at Cantor Fitzgerald and to Neutral at Piper Jaffray.\nCognizant Technology Solutions Corp. (NASDAQ: CTSH) was reiterated as Buy with a $63 price target (versus a $55.63 prior close) at Jefferies. The call is after Elliott took a 4% stake and is calling with a plan for Cognizant to get to $80 to $90 per share, which Jefferies feels is too optimistic but should still put in a floor.\nI'm interested in the Newsletter Get Newsletter \nterms and conditions   Conagra Brands Inc. (NYSE: CAG) was reiterated as Buy and the price target was reintroduced as $43 (versus a $37.72 close). The old target was $56, prior to its LW spin-off. The 52-week trading range is $29.55 to $38.02. and the consensus analyst price target is $43.06.\nGoldman Sachs Group Inc. (NYSE: GS) was raised to Buy from Hold at Deutsche Bank, but the big part of this call is the price target being raised to $255 from $180 (versus a $211.75 close). Shares have a 52-week range of $138.20 to $213.41, and the stock had a consensus target price of $194.50 prior to the call. What should stand out is that the highest price target was $240 before this.\nHP Inc. (NYSE: HPQ) was reiterated as Buy with a $19 price target (versus a $15.15 close) at Argus. The 52-week range is $8.91 to $16.19, and the consensus price target is $16.27. The firm noted that HP shares sold off after management issued below consensus guidance for its first quarter, despite a turnaround in formerly troubled core markets. Argus believes that HP is managing through secular transitions and cyclical challenges while also boosting margins at an impressive pace.\nSplunk Inc. (NASDAQ: SPLK) was last trading up 6.5% at $61.10 after another strong quarterly report. The stock was reiterated as Outperform at Wedbush Securities and the price target was raised to $75 from $72 (versus a $57.38 close). Merrill Lynch reiterated its Buy rating and raised its price objective to $88 from $67. Splunk has a 52-week range of $29.85 to $65.75 and a consensus price target of $69.57.\nUnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE: UNH) was raised to Buy from Neutral with a $178 price target (versus a $157.59 close) at Mizuho. Credit Suisse reiterated its Outperform rating and raised its price target to $179 from $168. The 52-week range is $107.51 to $158.12. The consensus analyst target is $164.05.\nFollow @Jonogg on Twitter to receive the daily analyst calls and research updates directly on your Twitter feed. \nOther key analyst upgrades and downgrades seen on Wednesday were in shares of the following companies:",

      "text": "Topics: draintheswamp , From the Wires , Goldman Sachs , president donald trump , Steven Mnuchin , Elections News , News , Politics News Steven Mnuchin, national finance chairman of President-elect Donald Trump's campaign, walks to lunch at Trump Tower, Tuesday, Nov. 29, 2016, in New York. (Credit: AP) \nSteven Mnuchin, President-elect Donald Trump’s expected choice to be the nation’s 77th treasury secretary, has had a long history as a successful financial executive and a shorter but significant period in a job that ushered him into Trump’s inner circle: head of Trump’s campaign finance operation. \nWhen Mnuchin, 53, was chosen by Trump as his national finance director in May, he told The Associated Press that the two men had been friends for 15 years. Through his work as finance chairman, Mnuchin (pronounced meh’NEW’-chen) is close to Trump’s children and son-in-law, Jared Kushner — a top adviser to Trump — and worked with them on fundraising events. \nThe campaign raised at least $169 million, in addition to the $66 million that Trump spent out of his own pocket. Though that was far short of what Hillary Clinton raised, it represented an impressive haul given that Trump didn’t begin fundraising in earnest until the end of May. A person familiar with Trump’s decision said Tuesday that the president-elect will nominate Mnuchin to the Treasury position. The person would only discuss the nomination on condition of anonymity because the person was not authorized to reveal it ahead of the official announcement. \nIf approved by the Senate, Mnuchin would follow in the tradition of two previous treasury secretaries — Robert Rubin in the Clinton administration and Henry Paulson in George W. Bush’s. All had vast Wall Street experience gained from years spent working at powerhouse Goldman Sachs. \nYet unlike Rubin and Paulson and unlike President Barack Obama’s two treasury secretaries, Timothy Geithner and Jacob Lew, Mnuchin would bring no government experience to Treasury, something that could prove a hurdle in navigating the tricky politics of Washington. \nAfter graduating from Yale in 1985. Mnuchin worked for Goldman Sachs for 17 years. His father, Robert Mnuchin, had himself worked for Goldman for three decades, becoming a partner in charge of equity trading. \nThe younger Mnuchin amassed his own fortune at the firm and then left in 2002. He worked briefly for Soros Fund Management, a hedge fund led by George Soros, before starting his own investment firm, Dune Capital Management. \nAs head of this firm, Mnuchin and other investors participated in the purchase of failed mortgage lender IndyMac in 2009 and renamed it OneWest. The failure of IndyMac in 2008 with $32 billion in assets was one of the biggest casualties of the housing bust. \nMnuchin became chairman of OneWest, which was sold to CIT Group in 2015. Before the sale, OneWest faced a string of lawsuits over its home foreclosure practices. \nThis month, housing advocates filed a complaint asking the Department of Housing and Urban Development to investigate OneWest for possible violations of the Fair Housing Act. The lender failed to place branches in minority communities, provided few mortgages to black homebuyers and preserved foreclosed properties in white neighborhoods while allowing similar homes in minority communities to fall into disrepair, according to the California Reinvestment Coalition and Fair Housing Advocates of Northern California. \nCIT declined to respond directly to the complaint but stressed in a statement that it is “committed to fair lending and works hard to meet the credit needs of all communities and neighborhoods we serve.” \nMnuchin also became a major investor in Hollywood, helping finance a number of movies, including the 2009 blockbuster “Avatar.” \nAs treasury secretary, Mnuchin would be the administration’s chief economic spokesman, serving as a liaison not only to Wall Street but also to global investors, a critical role given the trillions of dollars in treasury bonds owned by foreigners. In addition, it would be his job to sell the new administration’s economic program to Congress. \nMnuchin will also oversee a sprawling bureaucracy that includes the Internal Revenue Service and the agency that issues millions of Social Security and other benefit checks each month. Treasury also runs the agency that wages the financial war on terrorism. \nEven before his nomination was announced, he was being attacked for his ties to Wall Street. \n“It’s difficult to think of a nominee who better embodies the culture of Wall Street greed than the former Goldman Sachs partner,” the Communications Workers of America, a labor union, said in a statement. “Naming Mnuchin as treasury secretary would be a slap in the face of millions of working families who will be victimized by this Wall Street-rigged economy.” \nDuring the campaign, Trump complained about the Dodd-Frank Act, passed in 2010 in response to the 2008 financial crisis and intended to prevent another crisis by tightening financial regulations. He called the increased regulations on banks a “disaster.” \nMnuchin, in an interview with CNBC in July, said he thought Dodd-Frank “needs to be looked at.” But he has not spelled out what changes he would like to see. Yet if Trump decides to back Republican attempts to rewrite the law, Mnuchin could be expected to lead the administration’s effort. \nAnalysts said Mnuchin’s years of experience on Wall Street and in managing an investment firm gave him real-world skills that likely appealed to Trump, a business executive who also has never served in government. \n“Mr. Mnuchin is highly successful, and he’s well-known in financial circles here,” said Sung Won Sohn, an economics professor at California State University, Channel Islands. \nSohn and other economists, however, suggested that Mnuchin’s lack of government experience could prove to be a drawback in selling the administration’s economic policies to Congress. \n“People who come from Wall Street quickly find that they can’t just make a decision and have it happen,” said Stanley Collender, a longtime staffer on House and Senate budget committees and now an executive vice president at Qorvis communications. “It’s not like being a CEO. There is a lot more compromise involved.”",

(Photo: Carolyn Kaster, AP)\nWASHINGTON — While preparing to announce his economic team, Donald Trump said Wednesday that he and his children will hold a \"major news conference\" on Dec. 15 to discuss separation from his various business interests.\nHe plans to \"discuss the fact that I will be leaving my great business in total in order to fully focus on running the country in order to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" Trump said during an early morning tweet storm.\nCritics said his business interests run afoul of conflict of interest laws, but Trump said he is not \"mandated\" to dis-invest. \"I feel it is visually important, as President, to in no way have a conflict of interest with my various businesses,\" he tweeted.\nThe New York real estate mogul did not provide details about how his new business arrangement might work, and how his children might operate his empire moving forward. He tweeted that \"legal documents are being crafted which take me completely out of business operations. The Presidency is a far more important task!\"\nTrump made the announcement the same day he is expected to name key members of his economic team, tapping hedge fund manager and campaign aide Steve Mnuchin as secretary of the Treasury and billionaire investor Wilbur Ross as secretary of Commerce.\nConfirming his appointment in an interview with CNBC, Mnuchin said his priority is cutting taxes, particularly corporate taxes.\n\"By cutting corporate taxes, we're going to create huge economic growth and we'll have huge personal income,\" Mnuchin asid.\nMnuchin, 53, a former Goldman Sachs executive, worked this year as Trump's national campaign finance chairman.\nIf confirmed by the Senate, the Treasury secretary nominee would shepherd economic plans that include a reduction in government regulations and stepped-up infrastructure projects.\nRoss, the nominee for Commerce secretary, co-authored an infrastructure plan that Trump aides are studying.\nAlso discussing his appointment on CNBC, Ross said the Obama administration will pursue bi-lateral trade agreements with individual countries, as opposed to regional pacts like the now-stalled Trans-Pacific Partnership.\nUSA TODAY\nEthics watchdogs call on Donald Trump to sever business ties\nThe economy will also be front and center as Trump plans his first public appearance since the election more than three weeks ago: A trip to Indiana to celebrate Carrier's decision to keep 1,000 manufacturing jobs at its air conditioning plant in the state rather than move them to Mexico.\nCarrier's decision came after negotiations with Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence, the governor of Indiana, that included new tax breaks for the company.\n\"Big day on Thursday for Indiana and the great workers of that wonderful state,\" Trump tweeted. \"We will keep our companies and jobs in the U.S. Thanks Carrier.\"\nTrump also plans to kick off a \"thank you\" tour of states that provided his margin of victory in the Electoral College, a series of rallies set to begin Thursday in Cincinnati, Ohio.\nIn recent days, congressional Democrats and government analysts have questioned how Trump could conduct the presidency without violating conflict of interest guidelines involving his various global businesses.\nEthics watchdogs have urged Trump to abandon any plans to let his children run his real estate empire, and instead put all of his assets into a blind trust.\nSen. Ben Cardin, D-Md. , plans to ask the Senate to pass a resolution that would require Trump to hand over control of his businesses.\n“The American public has a right to know that the President of the United States is acting in their best interest, and not because he or she has received some benefit or gift from a foreign government like Russia or China or any other foreign entity,” Cardin said.\nUSA TODAY\nSen.

      "text": "November 30, 2016, 10:01 PM \nBy AP \nWashington– Steven Mnuchin, President-elect Donald Trump’s expected choice to be the nation’s 77th treasury secretary, has had a long history as a successful financial executive and a shorter but significant period in a job that ushered him into Trump’s inner circle: Head of Trump’s campaign finance operation. Steven Mnuchin \nWhen Mnuchin, 53, was chosen by Trump as his national finance director in May, he told The Associated Press that the two men had been friends for 15 years. Through his work as finance chairman, Mnuchin grew close to Trump’s children and son-in-law, Jared Kushner – a top adviser to Trump – and worked with them on fundraising events. \nThe campaign raised at least $169 million, in addition to the $66 million Trump spent out of his own pocket. Though that was far short of what Hillary Clinton raised, it represented an impressive haul given that Trump didn’t begin fundraising in earnest until the end of May. \nA person familiar with Trump’s decision said Tuesday that the president-elect will nominate Mnuchin to the Treasury position. The person would only discuss the nomination on condition of anonymity because the person was not authorized to reveal it ahead of the official announcement. \nIf approved by the Senate, Mnuchin would follow in the tradition of two previous treasury secretaries – Robert Rubin in the Clinton administration and Henry Paulson in George W. Bush’s. All had vast Wall Street experience gained from years spent working at powerhouse Goldman Sachs. \nYet unlike Rubin and Paulson and unlike President Barack Obama’s two treasury secretaries, Timothy Geithner and Jacob Lew, Mnuchin would bring no government experience to Treasury, something that could prove a hurdle in navigating the tricky politics of Washington. \nAfter graduating from Yale in 1985. Mnuchin worked for Goldman Sachs for 17 years. His father, Robert Mnuchin, had himself worked for Goldman for three decades, becoming a partner in charge of equity trading. \nThe younger Mnuchin amassed his own fortune at the firm and then left in 2002. He worked briefly for Soros Fund Management, a hedge fund led by George Soros, before starting his own investment firm, Dune Capital Management.",

      "text": "By Teresa Rivas On Tuesday, Keefe, Bruyette, and Woods upgraded Goldman Sachs ( GS ) (along with Bank of America ( BAC )), and today Deutsche Bank has also come out bullish on the stock.\nGetty Images Analyst Matt O-Connor and his team boosted their rating on the stock from Hold to Buy Wednesday, naming it one of their new top picks, and increased their price target from $180 to $255.\nThe move comes as O-Connor raised estimates for much of the banking sector in general, as he expects about 25% to 30% upside in EPS, thanks to stronger economic growth, higher interest rates, lower taxes, and less regulation.\nDetails from his note:\nGS seems well positioned for a stronger macro environment given revenue upside, good cost control and a valuation below peers (despite similar/higher current and expected returns). A stronger economy should benefit many capital market businesses—incl advisory, equity capital markets, and both fixed and equity trading (all areas of strength at GS). This should also be a positive backdrop for investing and lending (even assuming no regulatory changes). Separately, we expect the recent rollout of consumer lending to build momentum (we est. $400m in post credit revenues in 2019). On our 2018e, GS trades at a 10% discount to peers (at 9.1x vs. 10x). \nElsewhere in the industry, O-Connor names Huntington Bancshares ( HBAN ) and Wells Fargo ( WFC ) as his top large regional picks.\nGoldman Sachs was up 3.2% in recent trading.",

      "title": "Trump to Nominate Mnuchin as Treasury Secretary, Ross as Commerce Secretary",
      "text": "President-elect Donald Trump will nominate former Goldman Sachs partner Steve Mnuchin as U.S. Secretary of the Treasury, he announced on Wednesday morning. The pick may be broadly positive for regional bank stocks and some big insurance companies, analysts said.\nTrump confirmed plans to nominate Mnuchin as well as billionaire investor Wilbur Ross as Secretary of Commerce and Chicago Cubs co-owner Todd Ricketts as Deputy Secretary of Commerce. In a statement, his camp said the team \"will be instrumental in implementing the President-elect's America First economic plan.\"\nMnuchin, who served as Trump's campaign finance chairman, had confirmed his nomination and Ross' in a joint appearance on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" earlier in the day. Various outlets reported the picks on Tuesday evening.\nMnuchin, 53, who has no history of public service, would be the third former Goldman Sachs executive to become Treasury Secretary, following in the footsteps of Henry Paulson, a George W. Bush appointee, and Robert Rubin, a Clinton nominee. In the announcement statement, Trump called Mnuchin a \"world-class financier, banker and businessman\" who played a key role in his economic plan.\nMnuchin co-founded hedge fund Dune Capital Management after leaving Goldman Sachs in 2002. He joined a collection of other investors including billionaire John Paulson, to acquire IndyMac, a California-based bank that failed in 2008 during the financial crisis and was seized by regulators. The institution was renamed OneWest and later sold to CIT Group Inc. ( ( CIT ) ) in a $3.4 billion deal was approved by regulators to create a \"systemically important\" financial institution, despite opposition to the deal by a number of Californians.\nJaret Seiberg, analyst at Cowen Washington Research Group, said Mnuchin's experience at OneWest and CIT Group suggests he understands the challenges regional banks are confronting. \"We believe this choice should be broadly positive for regional banks,\" Seiberg said.\nMnuchin could quickly get behind Republican-backed legislation to raise a $50 billion threshold at which a big bank automatically becomes designated a \"Systemically Important Financial Institution.\" Banks designated as SIFIs are subject to tougher liquidity requirements as well as an obligation to draft living wills explaining how they would unwind themselves in bankruptcy. The move would be a positive for a number of regional bank SIFIs, including Zions Bancorp ( ( ZION ) ), Comerica ( ( CMA ) ) and Huntington Bancshares Inc. ( ( HBAN ) ), which would find themselves below the threshold.\nMnuchin would need to quit a couple corporate board positions if he was confirmed by the Senate to take the position, according to a review by relationship mapping company BoardEx, a service of The Deal's parent, TheStreet.\nIf chosen, Mnuchin would need to resign from the boards of both Sears Holdings Corp. ( ( SHLD ) ) and CIT Group. Mnuchin would also need to resign from his position as chairman and CEO of Dune Capital.\nIn addition, before taking on the new role, Mnuchin would need to either sell investments or place them into a blind trust. Mnuchin owns about $100 million in CIT Group stock, according to pay research firm Equilar, which he would need to sell or put into a blind trust.\nAs Treasury Secretary, Mnuchin would become chairman of the Financial Stability Oversight Council, a panel of regulators charged with identifying future risks to the economy. One of the council's main obligations is to designate financial institutions outside of the mainstream banking sector as SIFIs. The post-2008-crisis Dodd-Frank Act set up the FSOC and its designation authority after the near-failure and tax-payer-backed bailout of American International Group Inc. ( ( AIG ) ), a mega-insurance company that escaped serious regulatory oversight in the build-up to the financial crisis. One regulatory analyst in Washington told TheStreet that he believed Mnuchin would effectively end the council's efforts to designate new financial institutions as systemically important. He added, however, that the it is unlikely he will eliminate the FSOC altogether.\nThe prospect of Mnuchin as Treasury Secretary is likely a boon for the remaining non-bank SIFIs, AIG and Prudential Financial ( ( PRU ) ). Isaac Boltansky, analyst at Compass Point in Washington agreed that FSOC will be far less active under Trump. \"From a practical perspective, we believe the odds of additional SIFI designations under the current framework are extremely low and that the existing SIFI insurers are likely to be de-designated in the years ahead,\" he said.\nDemocrats had already put out statements in anticipation of Mnuchin's installation into the position. They derided the choice, arguing that Mnuchin's appointment is another example of Washington's revolving door between government and Wall Street that helps ensure that the largest financial institutions remain too-big-to-fail.\n\"Candidate Trump pledged to tame Wall Street and drain the swamp in Washington, D.C.,\" said Bart Naylor, Financial Policy Advocate, at Public Citizen. \"Instead, President-elect Trump spent last week pouring more sludge in the swamp by naming K Street lobbyists.\"\nThe Communications Workers of America, a labor union, said in a statement that it is difficult to think of a nominee who \"better embodies the culture of Wall Street greed than the former Goldman Sachs partner.\"\nRoss, the 78-year-old private equity billionaire at the helm W.L. Ross & Co. known best for restructuring failed companies in industries including steel, has been speculated as Trump's Commerce Secretary pick for some time. His appointment would require him to step down from a number of public and private company boards , including ArcelorMittal ( MT ) , the Bank of Cyprus, Exco Resources ( XCO ) , Sun National Bank ( SNBC ) and Nexeo Solutions ( NXEO ) . It will also require him to sell his investments or place them into blind trusts.\nTrump in a statement called Ross \"a champion of American manufacturing\" and \"one of the greatest negotiators I have ever met.\"\nThe president elect said Ross' second-in-command, Ricketts, will help the administration cut waste and streamline government, touting the \"incredible job he and the Ricketts family did in the purchase and turnaround of the Chicago Cubs.\" The complement marks quite a turnaround from Trump, who on the campaign trail attacked the Ricketts following reports the family had donated to an anti-Trump super PAC .",

      "text": "President-elect Donald Trump will name longtime banker and former Goldman Sachs executive Steven Mnuchin as Treasury secretary, turning to a campaign loyalist and fundraiser for the incoming administration's top economic cabinet post, a transition official said Tuesday.\nMr. Mnuchin built his career sniffing out undervalued assets and converting them into massive profits. But perhaps his greatest trade just came in the political arena.\nMr. Mnuchin, 53, a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. banker turned Hollywood financier, parlayed a six-month stint as Donald Trump's campaign finance chair into the president-elect's pick to be Treasury secretary.\nMr. Mnuchin's Wall Street pedigree presents a contrast with the populist themes Mr. Trump struck in his campaign, railing against big banks and vowing to close tax loopholes that benefit hedge funds. Mr. Trump also repeatedly attacked his rivals in the primary and general elections for their Wall Street ties, especially those connected to Goldman Sachs.\nMr. Mnuchin's links to the world of high finance, in particular Goldman, go back to before he was born. His father, Robert Mnuchin, started at Goldman in 1957 and spent his entire Wall Street career at the firm. The elder Mr. Mnuchin was among those who pioneered block trading, the buying or selling of large numbers of shares at once. Steven's brother Alan also worked at Goldman.\n\"He's a person of great integrity,\" the elder Mr. Mnuchin said of his son. \"[We] expect he will do a good job in this very exciting and demanding position.\"\nIf confirmed by the Senate as Treasury secretary, Mr. Mnuchin will join a list of prominent bankers who made similar moves from Wall Street to Washington, including two of his former bosses at Goldman, Henry Paulson and Robert Rubin, who were both top Goldman executives before running Treasury.\nDespite his successful Wall Street career, Mr. Mnuchin has no experience running a massive organization—the Treasury Department has 86,000 employees—or in economic or financial policy-making. The biggest entity Mr. Mnuchin has run was the technology division of Goldman, which had over 5,000 employees.\nMr. Mnuchin's acquaintances describe him as smart, with several people calling him \"nerdy.\" He regularly attends New York philanthropic galas. He has long held high-profile positions on charity boards and is a former director of the Whitney Museum of American Art. At an event for New York charity City Harvest in 2006, Mr. Mnuchin and his ex-wife were photographed with Mr. Trump. Mr. Mnuchin is now engaged to Scottish actress Louise Linton.\nMr. Mnuchin joined Goldman in 1985. He worked in the fixed-income department, eventually overseeing trading in mortgages, U.S. government, money market and municipal bonds. He made partner in 1994. Mr. Mnuchin later became the firm's chief information officer.\nWhen Goldman converted into a publicly traded company in 1999, Mr. Mnuchin, like other partners, made millions. He later bought a 6,500-square-foot apartment in 740 Park Avenue, a storied Manhattan co-op built by Jackie Kennedy's grandfather that is known as the \"billionaires' building.\"\nAt a recent conference, Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein called Mr. Mnuchin a \"highflier, a partner at a young age. He did very well. He is a smart, smart guy.\"\nIn 2002, Mr. Mnuchin left Goldman and later was hired to run a credit fund set up by billionaire George Soros.\nIn 2004, Mr. Mnuchin and two former Goldman colleagues founded hedge fund Dune Capital Management LP with financial backing from Mr. Soros. Dune soon expanded into the entertainment business, striking up a film-financing deal with a unit of 21st Century Fox. Among the films Dune financed was \"Avatar,\" one of the all-time box office hits.\n21st Century Fox and News Corp, parent company of The Wall Street Journal, share common ownership.\nIn 2008, IndyMac Bank in Pasadena, Calif., collapsed in one of the largest bank failures in U.S. history. Mr. Mnuchin led a group of investors, including funds run by Mr. Soros and other hedge-fund and private-equity titans, who bought it from the government for about $1.5 billion. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation agreed to cover a portion of any future loan losses, a lucrative arrangement for Mr. Mnuchin and his partners. Regulators who negotiated with Mr. Mnuchin found him to be the kind of detail-oriented person who would \"know the cost of every pencil,\" according to a person familiar with their thinking.\nMr. Mnuchin, who became chairman of the renamed OneWest Bank and CEO of its parent company, relocated to Los Angeles and bought a mansion in the Bel Air neighborhood.\nThe deal soon became controversial. In 2011, community activists descended on Mr. Mnuchin's Bel Air home to protest over the possible eviction of a homeowner who was behind on her mortgage payments to OneWest.\nIn 2014, OneWest was sold to CIT Group Inc., earning Mr. Mnuchin and Dune hundreds of millions of dollars in profits, according to a person familiar with the matter. He later pocketed $10.9 million in severance payouts when he left the company.\nDespite the huge profits, OneWest's legacy continues to trail Mr. Mnuchin, who now sits on CIT's board and owns more than 1% of its shares.\nA portion of OneWest's mortgage business is under investigation by the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Last July, CIT said it was forced to take a $230 million charge as it cleaned up accounting problems at OneWest. And two California housing groups this month accused OneWest of discriminating against minorities by not putting branches in their communities.\nMeanwhile, 14 years after leaving Goldman, Mr. Mnuchin remains in the firm's orbit, showing up at alumni events and involving other ex-Goldman executives in his finance deals.\nHe has continued to work those angles as Mr. Trump's finance chairman, a post he assumed in May. Mr. Mnuchin negotiated a joint fundraising agreement with the Republican National Committee, easing the way for major donors to give both to the party and to Mr. Trump. The committee's chairman, Lewis Eisenberg, is a Goldman veteran and contemporary of Mr. Mnuchin's father.\nWrite to Anupreeta Das at anupreeta.das@wsj.com and Rachel Louise Ensign at rachel.ensign@wsj.com\n 29, 2016 18:55 ET (23:55 GMT)\n ",

People familiar with the matter say Cohn's meeting with Trump on Tuesday included talks about a potential job in the new administration, possibly to run OMB, a sprawling office that will handle much of Trump's budget policy after he takes office in January.\nCohn, who is friendly with both Republicans and Democrats in Washington, is a longtime commodities trader who became Goldman's president and co-chief operating officer in 2006. He has long been the heir apparent to Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein. But with Blankfein showing no inclination to leave after battling cancer, Cohn may be looking to take on a new challenge. He is friendly with Trump's powerful son-in-law, Jared Kushner.\nCohn would add yet another Goldman name to a roster already filled with former executives from the influential bank, including Treasury pick Steven Mnuchin and incoming top White House adviser Steve Bannon.\nPeople close to Cohn, an aggressive and imposing trading veteran, note that he has a reputation for attracting and managing top talent, a key attribute for any OMB chief.",

      "text": "Reuters/ Ueslei Marcelino \nPresident-elect Donald Trump is thinking about naming Goldman Sachs COO and President Gary Cohn to a role in his administration, Politico's Ben White and Jake Sherman reported Wednesday.\nThe role could be director of the Office of Management and Budget, according to the report. That office handles the government's budget policy.\nTrump on Tuesday met with Cohn , who is the No. 2 executive at Goldman Sachs behind CEO Lloyd Blankfein.\nThe president-elect on Wednesday nominated former Goldman Sachs banker Steven Mnuchin as Treasury secretary. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon had also reportedly been in the running for that role. \nSteve Bannon, Trump's incoming chief strategist, is also a Goldman Sachs alum.\nTrump was highly critical of Goldman Sachs and other Wall Street banks throughout his campaign.\nHe condemned Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton for her ties to the investment bank and other Wall Street firms — and for earning hundreds of thousands of dollars for speeches given to the bank and its clients.\nTrump said in October that Clinton \"meets in secret with international banks to plot the destruction of US sovereignty in order to enrich these global financial powers, her special interest friends and her donors.\"\nTo that, Goldman CEO Blankfein said in an October CNBC interview that \"if there's some secret international cabal, I've been left out of the party.\"\nRead the full Politico story » \nNOW WATCH: Richard Branson: Entrepreneurs need to fill the gap where government is lacking \n",

      "text": "Tip : Use comma (,) to separate multiple quotes. Learn more... \nWed, Nov 30, 2016, 16:21 GMT - UK Markets close in 9 mins. Goldman Sachs says the Trump rally will spike, then fade in 2017 as the Fed hikes 4 times By Jeff Cox | CNBC – 43 minutes ago 2,210.50 +5.84 The Trump rally will continue into the early part of 2017, then drop off as the Fed hikes interest rates more than the market expects and sentiment shifts, Goldman Sachs predicts in its forecast for the coming year. \nAt its core, the outlook sees a tale of two trades: \"Hope\" that dominates in the first half, then \"fear\" that takes over the rest of the way. \nThe good news it that even with a second-half pullback, Goldman has raised its full-year forecast. When all is said and done, the S&P 500 will close at 2,300, a gain of nearly 5 percent from the current level and 100 points higher than the initial 2017 call, the bank's strategists said. \nThe bad news is that will be a 100-point drop from the high achieved in the first half. \n\"U.S. equity investors have focused 'more on hope than fear' since Donald Trump 's election. Ironically, many commentators believe his campaign rhetoric focused 'more on fear than hope,'\" David Kostin, Goldman's chief U.S. equity strategist, and others wrote in a report. \"In 2017, we expect the stock market will be animated by competing views of whether economic policies and actions of President Trump and a Republican Congress instill hope or fear.\" \nHope will be buoyed by a flurry of activity in the first 100 days that will include proposals for lower corporate taxes , repatriation of overseas corporate cash , a pullback in regulations and government spending stimulus aimed at lifting the U.S. off its tepid post-recovery growth rate, according to Kostin. \nFear, on the other hand, would come into play when inflation starts jumping, labor costs accelerate and the Fed jumps into action. While the U.S. central bank's current forecast is for two rate hikes next year , Goldman's forecast calls for the Fed's short-term rate target to rise by 100 basis points, or a full percentage point — the equivalent of four quarter-point hikes. \nThere could be other problems as well when Trump tries to implement some of the more controversial portions of his agenda. \n\"Congressional deficit hawks may constrain Mr. Trump's tax reform plans, and the (earnings) boost investors expect may not materialize,\" Kostin said. \"Potential tariffs and uncertainty around other policy positions may raise the equity risk premium and lead to lower stock valuations in\" the second half. \nOne thing that could mitigate the second-half pessimism is a shift in investor cash. \nGoldman sees a possibility of investors losing money on bonds as inflation picks up, pushing them into stock funds. Actively managed mutual funds in particular have witnessed huge outflows despite the seven-year bull market, with U.S. outflows of more than $236 billion in the past year alone, according to Morningstar. If bond yields rise and prices go down, that could swing money from fixed income into equities. \n\"Policy uncertainty introduces a degree of instability to our 2017 forecast that has been absent in recent years,\" Kostin wrote. \"Uncertainty always exists when forecasting, but our projections for next year have more elements of instability than usual.\" \nAs for how the trade plays out, Kostin believes that in the first half, \"cyclical\" stocks will beat out defensive shares, with companies having high domestic sales and high tax doing well on the expectation for lower tax rates. As both inflation and rates rise, the second half will be better for companies that have low labor costs and strong balance sheets.

      "text": "By Steve Holland \nNEW YORK – U.S. President-elect Donald Trump chose a former Goldman Sachs banker and a billionaire investor on Tuesday to steer economic policy in his administration and a fierce Obamacare critic to dismantle President Barack Obama’s signature healthcare programme.\nRepublican Trump is expected to name Steven Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs partner and Hollywood financier, as his nominee for Treasury secretary, a source said, putting a Wall Street veteran in the top U.S. economic Cabinet post.\nMnuchin, who spent 17 years at Goldman Sachs before leaving in 2002 to launch a hedge fund, served as Trump’s campaign finance chairman.\nBillionaire investor Wilbur Ross, known for his investments in distressed industries, is expected to be named commerce secretary, a source said.\nThe announcements could come as early as Wednesday.\nThe flurry of picks showed Trump, a real estate tycoon with no governing experience, rewarding loyalists and established Washington veterans as he rounds out his circle of top advisers.\nRepublican U.S. Representative Tom Price, an orthopaedic surgeon from Georgia, will be Trump’s health and human services secretary. Seema Verma, the founder of a health policy consulting company, will lead the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which is part of Health and Human Services and oversees government health programs for the poor and the elderly and insurance standards.\nTrump also announced his choice of Elaine Chao, labor secretary under President George W. Bush, to serve as secretary of transportation, saying in a statement that her expertise would be an asset “in our mission to rebuild our infrastructure.”\nWhile Trump made decisions on his economic team, he continued to mull over who should serve as his top diplomat. \nHe dined with former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, a one-time critic and the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, at a French restaurant in New York on Tuesday night.\nRomney sharply criticized Trump during the presidential campaign but he offered praise after their dinner.\n“He continues with a message of inclusion, of bringing people together,” Romney told reporters. He said Trump’s Cabinet choices so far and speech on Election Night were encouraging.\nDISMANTLING OBAMACARE\nTrump cast Price and Verma as a “dream team” to help him once he takes office on Jan. 20 with his campaign pledge to repeal Obamacare, the health law formally known as the Affordable Care Act. It has been a target of Republican attacks since its enactment in 2010.\nPrice has characterized Obamacare as “doing real harm to American families” and has co-sponsored legislation to replace it.\nVerma helped Pence, the Indiana governor, add conservative pieces to Medicaid coverage for the state’s poor by requiring beneficiaries to make contributions to health savings accounts. She also worked on Medicaid programs in Iowa, Ohio, Kentucky and Tennessee.\nChuck Schumer, the incoming Senate Democratic leader, was among the defenders of Obamacare who criticized Price’s selection. “Nominating Congressman Price to be the HHS secretary is akin to asking the fox to guard the hen house,” Schumer said. \nThe 2010 healthcare overhaul, aimed at expanding insurance coverage to millions more Americans, triggered a long, bitter fight between the White House and congressional Republicans, who said it created unwarranted government intervention in personal healthcare and private industry.\nTrump has said he will replace Obamacare with a plan to give states more control over Medicaid and allow insurers to sell plans nationally.\nPrice and Verma will both need Senate confirmation. Congressional approval will be needed to repeal and change the health law.\nWhite House spokesman Josh Earnest defended Obamacare on Tuesday, saying it had expanded coverage to millions of Americans, boosted consumer protections and shored up the finances of the Medicare program for the elderly.\n“We’ll see if Trump care measures up,” he said.\nTrump said after meeting Obama following his Nov. 8 election victory that he would consider keeping the provisions of the healthcare law that let parents keep adult children up to age 26 on their insurance policies and that bar insurers from denying coverage to people with pre-existing medical conditions.\nPrice, an early Trump supporter in the U.S. House of Representatives who leads the budget committee, has proposed a plan that would create age-based tax credits for people who buy insurance coverage on their own.\nHouse Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said on Tuesday the eventual congressional plan to replace Obamacare would likely have much in common with Price’s ideas.\nPrice’s plan would also roll back the 2010 law’s expansion of Medicaid for low-income people, a change that helped Obamacare cut the number of uninsured Americans to 29 million in 2015 from 49 million in 2010. \nTrump vowed on the campaign trail to “save” Medicare, but Democrats said Price’s plans could amount to privatising the government program for the elderly. Price has endorsed converting Medicare from a program that covers set benefits to a voucher-style program to help people buy coverage.\n“We say to Republicans who want to privatise Medicare: Go try it. Make our day,” Schumer said on Tuesday, saying the change would be unpopular with the public.\nDemocrats also criticized the pick because Price has supported barring federal funds for Planned Parenthood, which provides some abortions in addition to birth control, health exams and other services.\nTrump has met about 70 people as he looks to shape his White House and Cabinet team. Chao, his pick for transportation secretary, was the first Asian-American woman to hold a Cabinet position, as labor secretary. She is married to Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.\nTrump saw retired General David Petraeus, a potential candidate for the State Department or the Pentagon, on Monday. On Tuesday, he met Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\nCorker and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, as well as Romney, are in the running for secretary of state.\nTrump is set to launch a “thank you tour” of states he won in the election, starting with a rally on Thursday in Cincinnati, aides said.(Reuters)\n \n",

      "text": "print \nGary Cohn. Reuters/ Ueslei Marcelino \nPresident-elect Donald Trump is thinking about naming Goldman Sachs COO and President Gary Cohn to a role in his administration, Politico's Ben White and Jake Sherman reported Wednesday. \nThe role could be director of the Office of Management and Budget, according to the report. That office handles the government's budget policy. \nTrump on Tuesday met with Cohn , who is the No. 2 executive at Goldman Sachs behind CEO Lloyd Blankfein. \nThe president-elect on Wednesday nominated former Goldman Sachs banker Steven Mnuchin as Treasury secretary. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon had also reportedly been in the running for that role. \nSteve Bannon, Trump's incoming chief strategist, is also a Goldman Sachs alum. \nTrump was highly critical of Goldman Sachs and other Wall Street banks throughout his campaign. \nHe condemned Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton for her ties to the investment bank and other Wall Street firms — and for earning hundreds of thousands of dollars for speeches given to the bank and its clients. \nTrump said in October that Clinton \"meets in secret with international banks to plot the destruction of US sovereignty in order to enrich these global financial powers, her special interest friends and her donors.\" \nTo that, Goldman CEO Blankfein said in an October CNBC interview that \"if there's some secret international cabal, I've been left out of the party.\"",

      "text": "Goldman Sachs Will Do 'More Business Than We Thought': More Squawk From Jim Cramer Goldman Sachs stock is trading up, driven by anticipation for GDP growth and a reworked Dodd-Frank Act. Natalie Walters Nov30,201611:01AMEST \nNEW YORK ( TheStreet ) -- Shares of Goldman Sachs ( GS ) and other big banks were higher in mid-morning trading on Wednesday, after former Goldman Sachs banker Steven Mnuchin confirmed that he was chosen to head the Treasury Department for President-elect Donald Trump's administration. \n\"I think you listen to Mnuchin and you think more business is going to get done, earnings per share go up,\" TheStreet's Jim Cramer said on CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street\" on Wednesday morning. \nTrump had been expected to roll back regulations in the banking sector, and Mnuchin confirmed that this morning in an interview on CNBC's \"Squawk Box.\" Mnuchin said, \"We want to strip back parts of Dodd-Frank and that will be the No. 1 priority on the regulatory side.\" \nMnuchin also said that tax reform and fair trade will help the administration with its most important task -- to boost the economy. \n\"I think we can absolutely get to sustained 3% to 4% GDP, and that is absolutely critical for the country,\" Mnuchin said. \"We're going to cut corporate taxes, which will bring huge amounts of jobs back to the United States.\" \nA number of analysts downgraded big banks recently because they thought there wouldn't be a lot of growth, Cramer noted. However, if GDP grows and Dodd-Frank strictures on lending are repealed, then we could have loan growth. \n\"All we've been trying to get is interest margin growth. Imagine loan growth on top of net interest margin growth and then suddenly these companies are trading at eight, nine times earnings,\" Cramer commented.

      "text": "NEW YORK — Government Sachs is returning to Washington. After a decade in the wilderness, Wall Street’s most powerful firm, Goldman Sachs, is dominating the early days of the incoming Trump administration. The newly picked Treasury Secretary, Steven Mnuchin, spent 17 years at Goldman. Trump’s top incoming White House adviser, Steve Bannon, spent his early career at the bank. So did Anthony Scaramucci, one of Trump’s top transition advisers.\nGoldman’s president, Gary Cohn, spent an hour schmoozing with President-elect Donald Trump on Tuesday and could be up for an administration job, possibly as director of the Office of Management and Budget, people close to Cohn and the transition said. Cohn, a long-time commodities trader, is friendly with Trump’s powerful son-in-law, Jared Kushner.\nIt’s a stunning reversal of fortune for Goldman, a long-time Washington power that fell out of favor following the financial crisis. CEO Lloyd Blankfein got hauled before Congress along with other Wall Street executives to account for their behavior. And Trump, who ran as a populist and bashed Wall Street on the campaign trail, featured Blankfein as a shady and dangerous character in his final campaign ad.\nRolling Stone’s Matt Taibbi famously labeled Goldman the “great Vampire Squid” on the face of America.\nHad Hillary Clinton won the White House, Goldman faced a virtual lock-out from Washington with Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders poised to block and major picks from the bank or any other firm on Wall Street.\nNow Goldman, whose proximity to the levers of power dates to the early 20th Century and the creation of the Federal Reserve, stands to return to a level of influence unmatched by any other company in America. And Warren and her allies are left throwing darts from the sidelines.\nTrump considering Goldman Sachs president for top post By Ben White and Jake Sherman\n“We are talking about a massive change in tone in literally just three weeks,” said William Cohan a former banker and author of “Money and Power: How Goldman Sachs Came to Run the World. “If this had gone as the cognoscenti thought it was going to go we would be hearing Elizabeth Warren with her megaphone saying no one with a Wall Street background is getting anywhere near a Washington job.”\nThe rise of Goldman is also filled with ironies for Trump, even beyond his recent bashing of Blankfein.\nLike many Wall Street banks, Goldman stopped doing business with the real estate mogul years ago, scared off by his bankruptcy filings. Many of the firm’s top executives made it clear they preferred Clinton for president.\nNow Mnuchin, whose father was also a powerful Goldman banker, will be Trump’s top economic adviser, and he is already promising an agenda that thrills Wall Street and terrifies many Democrats.\n“Our number one priority will be tax reform. This will be the largest tax change since Reagan,” Mnuchin said on CNBC’s “Squawk Box” on Wednesday, flanked by Wilbur Ross, the billionaire investor tapped by Trump to serve as Commerce secretary. “We’re going to cut corporate taxes … we’re going to get to 15 percent,” said Mnuchin, who also argued for changing parts of the Dodd-Frank financial reform law that curtailed many of Wall Street’s swashbuckling ways.\n“The number one problem with Dodd-Frank is it’s way too complicated and it cuts back on lending,” Mnuchin said. “So we want to strip back parts of Dodd-Frank that prevent banks from lending. And that will be the number one priority on the regulatory side.”\nThose kinds of comments and the rise of Goldman and Wall Street influence in Trump’s Washington is sending progressive Democrats into a panic. Liberals fear an agenda that will slash tax rates for the wealthy and corporations and gut regulations while allowing Wall Street to go back to the kind of trading practices that helped fuel the financial crisis.\nEven many reform-minded conservatives wanted Trump to pick a different Treasury Secretary, someone like House Financial Services Chairman Jeb Hensarling or former BB&T CEO John Allison for the job. Both have strong views on increasing bank capital requirements and fighting so-called “Too Big to Fail” institutions. It’s much less clear that Mnuchin will do anything to make life difficult for large banks.\nWarren came out firing against Mnuchin on Tuesday night. And Democrats plan to hammer the Treasury nominee’s record as head of OneWest, a California bank derided as a “foreclosure machine” during the depths of the crisis.\n“Steve Mnuchin is the Forrest Gump of the financial crisis — he managed to participate in all the worst practices on Wall Street,” Warren said in a statement on Tuesday night. “He spent two decades at Goldman Sachs helping the bank peddle the same kind of mortgage products that blew up the economy and sucked down billions in taxpayer bailout money before he moved on to run a bank that was infamous for aggressively foreclosing on families.”\nSen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, which will consider Mnuchin’s nomination, promised thorough hearings including a focus on Mnuchin’s time at OneWest. The attacks may not be enough to derail Mnuchin, but they will add to a developing Democratic strategy of undercutting Trump’s blue-collar credentials by portraying him as a billionaire plutocrat governing with the interests of his rich friends in mind.\n“There are a number of serious problems raised by populating the most senior positions in government from a single bank and from a single industry,” said Dennis Kelleher, CEO of financial reform group Better Markets. “Whether it’s true or not, Goldman Sachs will be perceived as having privileged access and influence throughout the government. What we need most, and Candidate Trump seemed to understand this, is a view that prioritizes what’s good for Main Street and the real economy.”\nGoldman defenders say a negative focus on Mnuchin’s time at the bank is unfair and that he has the economic and markets expertise to help create faster economic growth that lifts wages across the board.\nTrump nominates Steve Mnuchin, Wilbur Ross for Cabinet positions By Matthew Nussbaum\n“I commend President-elect Trump on his outstanding selection of Steven Mnuchin to be Secretary of the Treasury,” former Goldman CEO and George W. Bush Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson said in a statement on Wednesday. “Steven embodies the characteristics necessary to be a very good Treasury secretary. He is a doer with the analytic and political skills to get things done in a complex environment.”\nGoldman supporters also note that had Clinton won, the left would have pushed for Gary Gensler, former head of the CFTC and himself a long-time Goldman banker, to be Treasury secretary or take some other high-profile post.\n“Throughout its 147-year history, Goldman Sachs has encouraged its employees to give back to the community while they are working here and after they leave,” said Jake Siewert, communications director at Goldman. “We are proud that many have gone on to serve their country and their communities after they have left.”\nThe return of Goldman to prominence in Washington restores a tradition that waned in recent years. The relationship dates to back at least to 1913 when one of the firm’s founding partners, Henry Goldman, helped create the Federal Reserve.\nThe influence declined during the Depression only to rise again with Goldman head Sidney Weinberg’s close relationship with President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. More recently, Goldman held sway in President Bill Clinton’s White House with the elevation of former co-chairman Robert Rubin to Treasury secretary during a period that saw significant deregulation of the banking industry and the repeal of the Depression-era Glass-Steagall law separating the activities of retail and investment banking.\nAnd when the financial crisis hit in 2008, then-president Bush turned to Paulson to help design a Wall Street bailout package that pumped hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars into the financial industry.\nDefenders of the bailout say it saved the economy from potential ruin and most banks including Goldman quickly paid back all federal funds. But Wall Street critics worry that the return of Goldman to such levels of power will ensure friendly treatment of the industry that could spark more crises in the future.\n“My real issue with Mnuchin is that it really is a start the countdown clock moment to the next crash,” said Kelleher. “That is the inevitability if the Wall Street view of the world once again becomes policy.”",

      "text": "34.37 CAD \nCongratulations to one of 2016’s most successful traders: Tom Malafronte of Goldman Sachs. \nThis New York-based junk-bond trader generated about $250 million in revenue this year through the start of October, according to a Bloomberg News article on Tuesday by Dakin Campbell and Sridhar Natarajan. That's a lot of money for any trader but especially one at a Wall Street bank that limits traders' risk-taking. \nHow did he do it? Malafronte began buying beaten-up bonds in January, taking risks on mining companies such as Freeport-McMoran and Teck Resources as well as troubled retailers such as Toys \"R\" Us and Gymboree Corp., according to the Wall Street Journal in October. He held onto some positions for just hours, some for weeks. Massive Recovery Bonds of Teck Resources, a mining company, have more than doubled in value since their lows this year Source: Bloomberg \nOf course, his huge profit raised many eyebrows, even within Goldman. After closely examining Malafronte’s trades, compliance officers found that everything was satisfactory. They rebuffed the idea that Malafronte’s activities violated the so-called Volcker Rule , which was crafted as part of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act to prevent banks from speculating with their own money. \nStill, a big question remains: How does a trader clearly follow these new rules while crushing competitors and taking risks? \nTo answer that, let’s first look at the provisions of the rather fuzzy Volcker Rule , which generally prohibits proprietary trading but has an enormous caveat known as the underwriting and market-making exemption. Basically, Wall Street traders can buy and sell securities with their banks’ money as long as they can show that their activities ultimately helped facilitate trading more broadly among customers. \nThis brings us back to Malafronte. Without knowing for certain, here’s one theory of how he delivered huge gains while demonstrating he was doing so for the good of clients. \nEarlier this year, energy junk bonds were trading at their lowest prices on record and the lowest-rated high-yield notes were sinking the most since the 2008 financial crisis. Some asset managers were liquidating their holdings because of client withdrawals. \nAt that point, several big asset managers, including Carlyle Group , Blackstone and Apollo Global Management, were starting to see good value in these bonds. \nLet’s say Malafronte asked around, realized the scope of interest and then proceeded to buy these highly distressed bonds whenever he encountered them. He could then market the securities among the group of opportunistic buyers, seeing who was willing to offer the highest price.He also possibly kept some for his trading account at Goldman Sachs given his understanding of how much demand there was for the notes. If someone questioned his motivation, he could simply say that he was warehousing the bonds for prospective clients. \nEnergy junk bonds have gained more than 63 percent since their nadir in February, while the riskiest junk bonds generally have returned almost 45 percent. Round Trip The energy junk-bond market has recovered tens of billions of dollars in value since February Source: Bloomberg \nSpecific bonds have gained even more, such as those of Teck Resources, which have gained more than 91 percent, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data. Big Bucks Bond traders who wagered on certain distressed companies earlier this year won big returns Source: The BofA Merrill Lynch US High Yield Index \nAll the while, it's easy to see how Malafronte could demonstrate he was working in his clients' interest to capitalize on opportunities and fostering trade in debt that was recently left for dead. Indeed, on some days Malafronte accounted for more than a third of all trading in some bonds, according to the Wall Street Journal article. \nMalafronte will go down as one of the big winners of 2016. But in doing so, he disproved the myth of the neutered, Wall Street debt-trading desk in the wake of post-crisis regulations. While big banks aren’t harboring internal hedge funds anymore, they’re still able to take advantage of dislocations in credit markets. And that's before any potential rollbacks of new regulations.

      "text": "by Paul Clarke 2 hours ago \nGoldman Sachs has been building its electronic trading business, but this MD has just switched to the buy-side.  en/266782/tom-middleton-credit-suisse/ \nA managing director in Goldman Sachs’ electronic trading group has left the bank to join a New York hedge fund as a quant consultant. Charles Reyl, who was a managing director in Goldman Sachs’ equities electronic trading unit, has just joined hedge fund Select Equity Group in New York as a quant consultant. Reyl was responsible for the business development of Goldman’s Marquee Trader execution services tool for its equities business and a key driver of expansion within its execution analytics platform.He worked at Goldman Sachs for two years, joining as a managing director in November 2014. Before this, he was the founder and CEO of Parity Energy, a firm which developed and electronic trading platform for over the counter derivatives in the commodities sector.\nReyl left investment banking in 2001, after spending four years at Credit Suisse where he was a vice president in its global modelling and analytics group. He joined Kiodex, an division of tech vendor Sunguard, where he worked as chief product officer. He started Parity Energy in 2006 and stayed until he joined Goldman Sachs two years’ ago. \nSelect Equity Group is a long-only and long-short equity hedge fund with $18bn in assets under management. It says that it was founded under the premise that “rigorous fundamental research and disciplined investing will generate superior investment returns”. \nGoldman Sachs has been building its electronic trading business in the past few months, with a particular focus on equities. Most recently, it hired John Cosenza , who was previously head of electronic trading at Cowen Group, in September.",

      "text": "Let’s say that a bank such as Goldman Sachs publishes a recommendation to “Buy Stock X”.\nIt’s hard to ignore a bet by a powerful investment bank such as Goldman. We are mere mortals in the pecking order, and they are supposed to be the all-knowing smart money from Wall Street.\nDo we buy the stock, or is it simply wiser to pass?\nBank Performance Overall The folks at InterTrader have done considerable legwork to dive deep into the data on investment bank recommendations made in 2015. They looked at every bet made by the 16 top banks throughout the year to assess both potential returns and accuracy.\nThe results are pretty underwhelming. \nIf you bought every stock recommended and held until the end of the year, here’s what your performance would look like:\n\nOverall, when holding the stock picks for the year, banks were only 43% accurate with their predictions.\nThat’s right – flipping a coin would have been potentially more effective than buying bank stock picks, which ended up down -4.79% on the year. The S&P 500 finished down only -0.69%, but simply just making any interest in a savings account would have been more effective as well.\nA Closer Look at Individual Banks While banks as a whole struggled with picks in 2015, it’s also important to look at banks on a more micro level to see how they performed. \nHere’s a look at the recommendations by Deutsche Bank , and how they did:\n\nDeutsche Bank nailed 41% of their predictions, and had a -8.93% return if picks were held throughout the year. \nAs you can see, some of their picks such as Microsoft and Wix.com gained double digits. On the other hand, recommendations such as Whiting Petroleum got absolutely crushed throughout the year, dropping -70.1%.\nOverall, Deutsche Bank’s performance here definitely didn’t do much to help the struggling company get out of its rut.\nWhich Banks Were Most Accurate? Here are the banks, from best to worst, based on accuracy of their calls:\n\nNomura, Credit Suisse, BAML, and Barclays all batted above .500 if stocks were held throughout the year, while 10 banks all did worse than a coin flip. \nCitigroup had an off year, only nailing 14% of its picks.\nWhich Banks Had the Best Returns? Here are the banks, from best to worst, based on the performance of these recommendations:\n\nJust two banks, Credit Suisse and Nomura, had positive returns if stocks were held through the year. Meanwhile, Canaccord Genuity’s picks were knocked down -16% over the course of 2015.\nAn Important Caveat Throughout the above article, we are showing the results if stock picks were held from when they were made until the end of the year. \nHowever, it is worth noting that the investment banks actually did slightly better if picks were held for shorter durations of time:\nTime Accuracy Gains % 30 Days 55% 0.80% 90 Days 49% -1.48% 180 Days 42% -3.66% End of Year 43% -4.79% In other words – if you sold all stock recommendations exactly 30 days after buying, you would have actually made a 0.8% return throughout the year. This is still a lower return than a savings account, but it is an improvement on losing -4.79%!\nFor a more in-depth dive into the data, we highly recommend checking out InterTrader’s interactive version of the results.\n\n\n\nThe post Most Banks Are Screwing Up On Their Stock Picks appeared first on Visual Capitalist .\n",

      "text": "Talk Carolyn Kaster/AP/REX/Shutterstock Steven Mnuchin , film producer, Goldman Sachs veteran and hedge fund manager, has been named President-elect Donald Trump ’s Treasury Secretary. Reports of his appointment surfaced on Tuesday, with Mnuchin confirming the news on CNBC Wednesday morning. Mnuchin was Trump’s finance chairman during his presidential campaign and is said to have impressed him since he joined the team in May. In the entertainment industry, he’s known as co-founder of Dune Capital Management and chairman of Dune Entertainment Partners, which funded films like “Mad Max: Fury Road,” “Suicide Squad” and “Avatar.” He founded Dune Capital Management in 2004 and invested in films by Twentieth Century Fox. He then went on to merge Dune Entertainment with Brett Ratner and James Packer’s RatPac to create Rat-Pac Dune Entertainment, which co-produced films like “American Sniper,” “The LEGO Movie” and “Sully.” In 2008, he and a few investors bought IndyMac, a California bank, and renamed it OneWest, for which he served as chairman before it was sold last year. READ MORE: Mark Hamill Slams Trump’s ‘Despicable’ Cabinet Picks His controversy stems from becoming co-chairman of Relativity Media in 2014 and his “quiet departure” two months before Relativity’s bankruptcy filing. Mnuchin invested around $80 million in Relativity and then the company started to run out of money. A Variety article examined how, in the weeks before the bankruptcy, Relativity paid $50 million to OneWest bank, draining the accounts. “Two individuals who had studied the $50 million in payments to OneWest Bank argue that the lender was given a clear preference when it drained two of the few flush accounts Relativity controlled, as others went unpaid,” the article stated. “‘This is an obvious case of a preference,’ said an attorney for one creditor owed millions by Relativity. Mnuchin was ‘chairman of the company that is now bankrupt. And at the end of the day, the bank he is affiliated with sweeps up every dime from these two accounts. That is money the company could have used to preserve itself.’” Relativity chairman Ryan Kavanaugh, who considered Mnuchin one of his “best friends,” then blamed him for “violating bankruptcy procedures,” according to a New York Post article. “Relativity explicitly blames the bank, founded by Steve Mnuchin, who until recently was one of studio founder Ryan Kavanaugh’s best friends and a company director, for violating bankruptcy procedures and for delaying the release of a movie recently considered to be the studio’s savior, a letter and an email from the company obtained by The Post reveal.” READ MORE: Francis Ford Coppola Takes Shot at Donald Trump in Letter to the New York Times His appointment as Treasury Secretary doesn’t sit well with the Democratic National Committee, who released a statement after the news was confirmed: “So much for draining the swamp. Nominating Steve Mnuchin to be Treasury Secretary — a billionaire hedge fund manager and Goldman Sachs alumnus who preyed on homeowners struggling during the recession — is a slap in the face to voters who hoped he would shake up Washington. Trump is already heading into office as the most corrupt, conflicted, and unpopular president-elect in history, and now he’s breaking his signature promise to the voters who elected him.” \nThis Article is related to: Film and tagged Donald Trump , Steven Mnuchin More From IndieWire",

      "text": "Goldman Sachs President Eyed by Trump for Top Administration Job Posted at 1:30 pm on November 30, 2016 by Susan Wright Share on Facebook \nWas that “drain the swamp” or “strain the swamp”? \nIt’s getting hard to tell. \nFor all of his bluster, Trump really doesn’t seem all that turned off by the big banks and power players from Wall Street. \nTake for instance, Gary Cohn. \nCohn is the president of Goldman Sachs. \nHe’s also reportedly being considered for a top job in the Trump administration. \nCohn, the president and chief operating officer at the bank, met with Trump on Tuesday. The two discussed several possible positions, including director of the Office of Management and Budget, multiple sources told Politico . \nTrump was a vocal critic of Wall Street banks on the campaign trail and repeatedly called on Hillary Clinton to release the transcripts of the paid speeches she delivered to Goldman Sachs. Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein said in October that he was backing Clinton for president. \nBut the businessman has already tapped a former Wall Street executive to his Cabinet. He named Steven Mnuchin, the national finance chairman of his campaign, to serve as his Treasury secretary. Mnuchin is a former partner at Goldman Sachs. \nDrain. The. Swamp.",

And he’s going to make rich people even richer. \n“Our No. 1 priority is gonna be the economy,” Mnuchin told reporters in the Trump Tower lobby. \nThe former Goldman Sachs investment banker said his Treasury Department would aim for a “very sustainable” 3 percent to 4 percent economic growth. He also promised to “focus on things for the American worker,” adding, “That’s absolutely our priority.” \nMnuchin kept ambiguous the exact “things for the American worker” that he’d “focus on,” but later promised “the most significant middle-income tax cut since [former president Ronald] Reagan.” \nCorporations will also see a tax cut, he said. Among his aims: “Lowering corporate taxes so we make U.S. companies the most competitive in the world, making sure we repatriate trillions of dollars back to the United States.” \nAsked how his experience on Wall Street and in Hollywood has prepared him for a role in government, Mnuchin noted his prior experience as a regional banker “for the last eight years.” \n“I know what it takes to make sure we can make loans to small- and mid-market companies,” he said. “That’s gonna be our big focus — making sure we scale back regulation so that we make sure the banks are lending.” \nWatch below as he discusses the new administration’s priorities: Steven Mnuchin, Pres-elect Trump's pick for Treasury secretary: “Our number one priority is going to be the economy” https://t.co/hhm6kQDpTZ pic.twitter.com/NzMqCb8sQd",

      "text": "Cancel President-elect Donald Trump confirmed Wednesday that Goldman Sachs alum Steven Mnuchin will head the Treasury Department as part of the incoming administration. Richard Drew/AP \nPresident-elect Donald Trump tapped two billionaires and a former Goldman Sachs executive for three key government positions Wednesday, as the incoming administration's economic team begins to take shape. \nAs expected, Goldman Sachs alum Steven Mnuchin was selected to head the Treasury Department. Mnuchin served as the Trump campaign's finance chairman during election season and has helped shape the president-elect's tax and economic policies. \nBillionaire investor Wilbur Ross, the chairman of WL Ross & Co. and a longtime distressed debt investor who also advised Trump during his run for the White House, was named secretary of commerce. Ross has a long history of doing business with Trump: He reportedly was a bondholder for the Trump Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey, when its finances were on the rocks in 1990, and helped Trump structure a related bankruptcy filing in 1991, according to The New York Times .

      "text": "Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein. Jemal Countess/Getty Images \nGoldman Sachs shares are trading at their highest levels since 2007. \nShares were trading at $218.90 around 12:15 p.m. ET on Wednesday after increasing steadily from $161.27 on August 31. \nAnalysts from both Deutsche Bank and KBW upgraded the global investment bank on Tuesday. \n\"For GS, we believe we are moving to a better trading environment for FICC\" — fixed income, currencies, and commodities — \"trading and GS should benefit more than peers given the company's reliance on trading results and the greater contribution from FICC revenues toward total revenues,\" KBW's Frederick Cannon, Brian Kleinhanzl, and Allyson Boyd wrote. \n\"In general, we are more confident in rising rates and better trading versus wide-sweeping regulatory changes, and we believe BAC and GS offer the best exposure to both at still reasonable valuations.\" \nDeutsche Bank's Matt O'Connor upgraded the bank to a \"buy\" rating, saying it seems well positioned for a stronger macro environment given its revenue upside, good cost control, and valuation below peers. \n\"A stronger economy should benefit many capital market businesses — incl advisory, equity capital markets, and both fixed and equity trading (all areas of strength at GS),\" he wrote. \"This should also be a positive backdrop for investing and lending (even assuming no regulatory changes).\" \nHe also said he expects the firm's recent rollout of its consumer lending platform, Marcus, to build momentum. \nYahoo! Finance \nMost Wall Street banks have been performing strongly since President-elect Donald Trump's election win earlier this month. The BKX index of bank stocks is up about 15% since the election, versus a 3% rise in the S&P 500. \nTrump on Wednesday appointed the former Goldman Sachs banker Steven Mnuchin Treasury secretary. Steve Bannon, Trump's incoming chief strategist, is also a Goldman Sachs alum.",

      "text": "Email \nNEW YORK — President-elect Donald Trump has tapped Steven Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs banker who profited from the housing meltdown, as his Treasury secretary, according to an official briefed on the decision. \nMnuchin’s career has been full of contradictions. He started as a Wall Street insider working for old-line firms before running a series of eclectic businesses — including his own hedge fund and a West Coast consumer bank. In recent years, he has been a Hollywood movie producer. \nHe served as finance chairman of Trump’s presidential campaign and has been one of Trump’s closest economic advisers. His nomination will be announced as soon as Wednesday, the official said. \nAs Treasury secretary, the 53-year-old Mnuchin would be the face of the American economy around the world. The Treasury Department has expansive responsibility over business and oversees banking regulations, financial markets and the IRS. It has about 100,000 employees, an estimated 91,000 of them at the IRS. \nBesides co-signing the currency, the Treasury secretary is Uncle Sam’s banker, paying the bills, collecting taxes, managing the federal government debt and selling billions of dollars a year in Treasury bonds. \nMnuchin, like his father before him, was a partner at Goldman. He worked for the firm for 17 years, joining at age 22 and leaving just before his 40th birthday, in 2002. \nHe briefly joined the hedge fund of his former college roommate Eddie Lampert. Mnuchin still serves as a director of Sears Holdings, of which Lampert is chairman and CEO. \nAfter less than a year, he left Lampert to work as a portfolio manager for the hedge fund of George Soros, the billionaire financier who has bankrolled liberal candidates and causes — and who was depicted as a villain in Trump’s last campaign ad. \nHe only stayed a year, leaving in September 2004 to start his own hedge fund, Dune Capital Management. \nAs a producer, he has put out films including “American Sniper,”“The Lego Movie” and this summer’s “Suicide Squad.” His latest film, which opened right before Thanksgiving, is called “Rules Don’t Apply.” \nMnuchin joined the Trump campaign as finance chairman in May, and sources tell CNN he made it clear early that he wanted the Treasury job. He recruited deputies before he was tapped for the job. \nMnuchin has contributed to both Republican and Democratic candidates, including Hillary Clinton’s Senate campaigns and 2008 presidential run. He gave to Barack Obama’s Senate and presidential campaigns and to Charles Schumer, the new Democratic leader in the Senate. \nMnuchin and his brother were sued by the trustee trying to recover money for Bernard Madoff’s victims after his Ponzi scheme unraveled in 2008. They were executors of their mother’s estate, and had withdrawn her investment with Madoff shortly after she died in 2005. \nA court eventually blocked the trustee, Irving Picard, from collecting his mother’s $3.2 million in profits withdrawn from the Madoff fund that long before its collapse. \nMnuchin led the group that bought failed subprime lender IndyMac for pennies on the dollar in 2009, about a year after the FDIC took over the California bank following a run on deposits by customers. \nIndyMac had become a poster child for the risky home loans that brought on the housing crisis and the meltdown in financial markets. The FDIC agreed to assume much of the losses as part of its sale to Mnuchin, who renamed it OneWest. \nBut regulators soon questioned OneWest’s foreclosure practices, which included so-called robo-signings that pushed homeowners into foreclosure without proper review or due process. \nThe bank was one of many that agreed to pay millions in fines to compensate customers. Occupy Los Angeles protesters showed up at Mnuchin’s Bel Air mansion. And this month two fair housing groups in California filed a complaint with the Department of Housing and Urban Development, accusing the bank of discriminating against minority borrowers during his tenure there. \nMnuchin eventually sold OneWest to CIT Group in 2014 for $3.4 billion and joined CIT as part of the deal. When he left CIT less than two years later, he received a $10.9 million severance package. 40.712784 -74.005941 ",

Cohn did not take questions from reporters after his meeting with the president-elect.\nCohn, who also serves as chief operating officer of Goldman Sachs, is one of several Wall Street executives who are under consideration, or have been chosen to play a role in the Trump administration. Trump on Wednesday announced his appointment of former Goldman Sachs partner Steve Mnuchin to serve as his treasury secretary, and billionaire investor Wilbur Ross to lead the Commerce Department.\nNaming Cohn to a top position in the next administration would likely amplify the criticism Trump has already faced for including Wall Street veterans in his transition process and giving Mnuchin a Cabinet-level position, despite promising to \"drain the swamp.\"\nStay abreast of the latest developments from nation's capital and beyond with curated News Alerts   news desk and delivered to your inbox.\nSorry, there was a problem processing your email signup.

A stronger economy should benefit many capital market businesses—incl advisory, equity capital markets, and both fixed and equity trading (all areas of strength at GS).

      "title": "Trump Plans to Name Steven Mnuchin as Treasury Secretary",
      "text": "President-elect Donald Trump will name longtime banker and former Goldman Sachs executive Steven Mnuchin as Treasury secretary, turning to a campaign loyalist and fundraiser for the incoming administration's top economic cabinet post, a transition official said Tuesday.\nMr. Mnuchin built his career sniffing out undervalued assets and converting them into massive profits. But perhaps his greatest trade just came in the political arena.\nMr. Mnuchin, 53, a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. banker turned Hollywood financier, parlayed a six-month stint as Donald Trump's campaign finance chair into the president-elect's pick to be Treasury secretary.\nMr. Mnuchin's Wall Street pedigree presents a contrast with the populist themes Mr. Trump struck in his campaign, railing against big banks and vowing to close tax loopholes that benefit hedge funds. Mr. Trump also repeatedly attacked his rivals in the primary and general elections for their Wall Street ties, especially those connected to Goldman Sachs.\nMr. Mnuchin's links to the world of high finance, in particular Goldman, go back to before he was born. His father, Robert Mnuchin, started at Goldman in 1957 and spent his entire Wall Street career at the firm. The elder Mr. Mnuchin was among those who pioneered block trading, the buying or selling of large numbers of shares at once. Steven's brother Alan also worked at Goldman.\n\"He's a person of great integrity,\" the elder Mr. Mnuchin said of his son. \"[We] expect he will do a good job in this very exciting and demanding position.\"\nIf confirmed by the Senate as Treasury secretary, Mr. Mnuchin will join a list of prominent bankers who made similar moves from Wall Street to Washington, including two of his former bosses at Goldman, Henry Paulson and Robert Rubin, who were both top Goldman executives before running Treasury.\nDespite his successful Wall Street career, Mr. Mnuchin has no experience running a massive organization—the Treasury Department has 86,000 employees—or in economic or financial policy-making. The biggest entity Mr. Mnuchin has run was the technology division of Goldman, which had over 5,000 employees.\nMr. Mnuchin's acquaintances describe him as smart, with several people calling him \"nerdy.\" He regularly attends New York philanthropic galas. He has long held high-profile positions on charity boards and is a former director of the Whitney Museum of American Art. At an event for New York charity City Harvest in 2006, Mr. Mnuchin and his ex-wife were photographed with Mr. Trump. Mr. Mnuchin is now engaged to Scottish actress Louise Linton.\nMr. Mnuchin joined Goldman in 1985. He worked in the fixed-income department, eventually overseeing trading in mortgages, U.S. government, money market and municipal bonds. He made partner in 1994. Mr. Mnuchin later became the firm's chief information officer.\nWhen Goldman converted into a publicly traded company in 1999, Mr. Mnuchin, like other partners, made millions. He later bought a 6,500-square-foot apartment in 740 Park Avenue, a storied Manhattan co-op built by Jackie Kennedy's grandfather that is known as the \"billionaires' building.\"\nAt a recent conference, Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein called Mr. Mnuchin a \"highflier, a partner at a young age. He did very well. He is a smart, smart guy.\"\nIn 2002, Mr. Mnuchin left Goldman and later was hired to run a credit fund set up by billionaire George Soros.\nIn 2004, Mr. Mnuchin and two former Goldman colleagues founded hedge fund Dune Capital Management LP with financial backing from Mr. Soros. Dune soon expanded into the entertainment business, striking up a film-financing deal with a unit of 21st Century Fox. Among the films Dune financed was \"Avatar,\" one of the all-time box office hits.\n21st Century Fox and News Corp, parent company of The Wall Street Journal, share common ownership.\nIn 2008, IndyMac Bank in Pasadena, Calif., collapsed in one of the largest bank failures in U.S. history. Mr. Mnuchin led a group of investors, including funds run by Mr. Soros and other hedge-fund and private-equity titans, who bought it from the government for about $1.5 billion. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation agreed to cover a portion of any future loan losses, a lucrative arrangement for Mr. Mnuchin and his partners. Regulators who negotiated with Mr. Mnuchin found him to be the kind of detail-oriented person who would \"know the cost of every pencil,\" according to a person familiar with their thinking.\nMr. Mnuchin, who became chairman of the renamed OneWest Bank and CEO of its parent company, relocated to Los Angeles and bought a mansion in the Bel Air neighborhood.\nThe deal soon became controversial. In 2011, community activists descended on Mr. Mnuchin's Bel Air home to protest over the possible eviction of a homeowner who was behind on her mortgage payments to OneWest.\nIn 2014, OneWest was sold to CIT Group Inc., earning Mr. Mnuchin and Dune hundreds of millions of dollars in profits, according to a person familiar with the matter. He later pocketed $10.9 million in severance payouts when he left the company.\nDespite the huge profits, OneWest's legacy continues to trail Mr. Mnuchin, who now sits on CIT's board and owns more than 1% of its shares.\nA portion of OneWest's mortgage business is under investigation by the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Last July, CIT said it was forced to take a $230 million charge as it cleaned up accounting problems at OneWest. And two California housing groups this month accused OneWest of discriminating against minorities by not putting branches in their communities.\nMeanwhile, 14 years after leaving Goldman, Mr. Mnuchin remains in the firm's orbit, showing up at alumni events and involving other ex-Goldman executives in his finance deals.\nHe has continued to work those angles as Mr. Trump's finance chairman, a post he assumed in May. Mr. Mnuchin negotiated a joint fundraising agreement with the Republican National Committee, easing the way for major donors to give both to the party and to Mr. Trump. The committee's chairman, Lewis Eisenberg, is a Goldman veteran and contemporary of Mr. Mnuchin's father.\nWrite to Anupreeta Das at anupreeta.das@wsj.com and Rachel Louise Ensign at rachel.ensign@wsj.com\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\nNovember 29, 2016 18:55 ET (23:55 ",

      "title": "Goldman Sachs at Center of Politics, Money and Public Furor Once Again",
      "text": "By Liz Hoffman\nHeading into the 2016 presidential election, most executives on Wall Street would have said one thing was certain no matter who won: The next Treasury secretary wouldn't come from Goldman Sachs Group Inc.\nThat reflected the view that Goldman was so tainted in the public mind by the financial crisis that none of its alumni could be floated, much less confirmed, to top government positions.\nLike so much other conventional wisdom, that has now proved to be wrong. President-elect Donald Trump is set to name Steven Mnuchin , a Goldman alum, as Treasury secretary.\nMr. Mnuchin worked at the company for 17 years. Most of his time was spent in Goldman's mortgage-trading business in the early 1990s, though he also oversaw its internet strategy, which resulted in a flopped online wealth-brokerage effort in the early 2000s.\nMr. Mnuchin made partner in 1994, the same class that produced Goldman's current No. 2, Gary Cohn. Mr. Cohn met with Mr. Trump Tuesday.\nIf Mr. Mnuchin is confirmed as Treasury secretary, he will be the third former Goldman banker to hold the position in less than 25 years. Robert Rubin served in this role in President Bill Clinton's second term and Henry Paulson Jr. occupied the spot in President George W. Bush's second term and brought Goldman banker Robert Steel along as his deputy.\nWhile the firm's critics have pointed to its extensive ties to government as a sign of Wall Street's outsize influence, Goldman partners have long viewed public service as an important coda to a finance career.\nAnd the firm's government ties extend well beyond the Treasury.\nWilliam Dudley, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, spent a decade as a Goldman's chief economist. Joshua Bolten, a legal- and regulatory-affairs executive at Goldman in the 1990s, served as President George W. Bush's chief of staff, and Steve Friedman, who was among the Goldman partners who rang the New York Stock Exchange bell at the bank's 1999 debut, served as a senior economic counselor in that administration. Gary Gensler, head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission under President Barack Obama, was one of the youngest bankers ever named a partner at Goldman.\nGoldman's government reach isn't confined to the U.S. Bank of England Gov. Mark Carney, who was previously head of Canada's central bank, was a Goldman banker for 13 years in its London, Tokyo, New York and Toronto offices.\nEuropean Central Bank President Mario Draghi was a vice chairman and managing director in the firm's international business from 2002 to 2005.Goldman advisers and former employees have served as governors of the central banks of Australia, Greece and South Africa.\nThe funnel that has sent Goldman executives to Washington dates to the bank's longtime leader, Sidney Weinberg. Mr. Weinberg, who ran Goldman for more than three decades and oversaw its rise from scrappy second-tier firm to the investment-banking elite, was a supporter and close friend of President Lyndon Johnson, to whom he recommended several men to key cabinet posts.\nHis influence in the White House elevated Goldman's status in Washington, a position it solidified during the 1990s and early 2000s.\nThat Goldman is again back at the pinnacle of the U.S. government is a stunning turnaround from the drubbing its image took during the financial crisis. Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein and other executives were hauled before Congress over trades involving complex financial instruments that were believed to have fueled the financial meltdown.\nIn 2010, Goldman became the face of Wall Street and the crisis thanks to a damning article in Rolling Stone. The magazine called Goldman \"a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like money.\"\nIn the wake of that, Goldman, which long focused only on its reputation with clients, undertook steps to burnish its public image. It boosted its philanthropic efforts, which now support women entrepreneurs and small businesses. Today, Goldman has a consumer bank and weekly podcasts.\n\"We try not to be tone-deaf and we listen closely,\" Mr. Blankfein said recently when asked about his firm's reputation. \"It's not in as low ebb as it was in the heart of the financial crisis [but] it's still low ebb. We have to work on that and we know that.\"\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\nNovember 29, 2016 20:48 ET (01:48 ",

      "text": "Source: Thinkstock November 30 2016: Markets opened higher again Wednesday as oil prices started the day trading up on expectations that OPEC would reach an agreement on cutting back oil production. The EIA’s inventory report also came out today but not many people even noticed. Energy sector stocks traded up 5% late in the afternoon and utilities led the laggards, down about 2.7%. WTI crude oil for January delivery settled at $49.44 a barrel, up 9.3% on the day. February gold lost 1.4% on the day to settle at $1,173.90. Equities were headed for a mixed close before the bell as the DJIA traded up 0.27% for the day, the S&P 500 traded down 0.05%, and the Nasdaq Composite traded down 0.86%.\nThe DJIA stock posting the largest daily percentage gain ahead of the close Wednesday was The Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (NYSE: GS) which traded up 3.73% at $219.65. The stock’s 52-week range is $138.20 to $220.75. Volume was about 65% higher than the daily average of around 3.2 million shares. The investment bank had no specific news Tuesday, but former traded Steve Mnuchin has been named to be the new Secretary of the Treasury in the Trump administration. Mnuchin has said he favors rolling back parts of the Dodd-Frank legislation.\nE. I. du Pont de Nemours and Co. (NYSE: DD) traded up 3.40% at $73.62. The stock’s 52-week range is $50.71 to $75.72. Volume was about 10% higher than the daily average of around 2.7 million shares. The company had no specific news Wednesday.\nChevron Corp. (NYSE: CVX) traded up 2.46% at $112.03. The stock’s 52-week range is $75.33 to $112.98, and the high was set around noon today. Volume was about 40% above the daily average of around 10.8 million shares. A 9% jump in crude oil prices is nothing to ignore.\nExxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE: XOM) traded up 2.24% at $87.82. The stock’s 52-week range is $71.55 to $95.55. Trading volume was about 40% above the daily average of around 10.8 million. Can’t beat a big jump in crude prices for putting some air under a share price. .\nOf the Dow 30 stocks 11 are on track to close higher Wednesday and 19 are set to close lower.\nI'm interested in the Newsletter Get Newsletter \nterms and conditions   ",

      "title": "Goldman Sachs: Trump Will Spur Massive Rally In Nearly All Sectors",
      "text": "  11:07 AM EST Goldman Sachs: Trump Will Spur Massive Rally In Nearly All Sectors \nThe post-Trump euphoria just keeps growing and growing on Wall Street, with Goldman Sachs today publishing findings from a survey of analysts indicating near universal bullishness across almost all stock sectors. \nThe just-published Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Analyst Index is used to take the temperature of various analysts’ growth expectations for different sectors within the S&P 500. This month, Goldman included a question about Trump in there, and the results were remarkably bullish. From Bloomberg : \n“This month, we asked analysts to comment on how the results of the U.S. election will affect companies in their respective sectors,” the team led by Avisha Thakkar writes in the new note. “While their responses suggest that there is still uncertainty about the sector-level impact, the majority of sectors are anticipating favorable effects,” they say, adding that expectations of lower tax rates and economic stimulus are among key reasons for the favorable outlook. \nThe few concerns unveiled by the survey centered on “potentially more restrictive trade policy, notably for clean energy and agricultural industries, and higher inflationary pressures,” the report noted. \nWhile shorter-term sentiment remains incredibly bullish, as the time horizon expands, Goldman expects the Trump rally to fade in the second half of 2017. In a separate note, the firm sees a big rally to start next year, but then most of those gains to be erased as 2017 draws to a close. \nThe SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust ( NYSE:SPY ) rose $0.32 (+0.15%) to $221.24 per share in Wednesday morning trading. Year-to-date, the largest exchange traded fund tied to the benchmark S&P 500 index has gained 8.52%.   Related Stocks:",
