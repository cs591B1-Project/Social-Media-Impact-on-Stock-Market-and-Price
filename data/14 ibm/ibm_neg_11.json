      "text": "IBM and AIGA partner on design leadership November 14, 2016 Filed Under: AIGA news , Press release   \nNew York, NY, November 14, 2016 —AIGA, the professional association for design, with 26,000 practicing designers in 70 chapters across the U.S., announced a partnership with IBM today. \nIBM will serve as the first Official AIGA Sponsor for Design Leadership. Over the next year, IBM will strengthen its relationship with AIGA’s creative communities by engaging IBM leaders to deploy their expertise across AIGA’s network. \nThe partnership will integrate leadership development skills and experience design across AIGA’s activities, including the organization’s 26,000 members and the 260,000 professional graphic designers working in the U.S. (source: Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2014) who look to AIGA as an authority and resource. \n“We are thrilled to be entering into this multi-faceted partnership with IBM,” says Julie Anixter, AIGA executive director. “Today designers are being called upon for their design and problem-solving skills to help organizations of all kinds imagine their futures. IBM has the ability to help us advance our   offering through thought leadership, strategy, and training for our chapter leaders.” \n“Our goal is to help AIGA scale its leadership capabilities so that design can make a bigger impact in the world, and help address the complex problems we face today, according to Doug Powell, IBM Distinguished Designer. “Together, AIGA and IBM have the power to advance the design profession, and amplify the intrinsic value of design across sectors.” \nIBM will offer quarterly design leader training summits to AIGA at key locations throughout the country. They will be attended in-person and virtually, and are designed to help the broader AIGA community scale their design leadership across sectors. The partnership will be activated across AIGA’s programs including: AIGA Design Leadership",

      "text": "A Closer Look at IBM’s Growth-Chasing Strategy PART 12 OF 14 Why IBM’s Rise in Data Center Capacity Holds Importance By Anne Shields | Nov 29, 2016 2:07 pm EST IBM targets the United Kingdom to increase its data center capacity \nEarlier, we learned that IBM’s ( IBM ) initiatives and strategic acquisitions to strengthen its presence in the IoT (Internet of Things) space have started to pay off. The company was named a leader in the IoT space by Forrester and IDC (International Data Corporation). \nRecently, IBM announced its plans to add four new cloud data centers integrated with cognitive intelligence in the United Kingdom ( EWU ). Through its data centers, IBM intends to provide Bluemix, Watson Analytics, blockchain offerings, and backend and analytics platforms for IoT. \nIBM isn’t the only player to open new data centers in the cloud space. By 2017, Amazon plans to have an AWS (Amazon Web Services) “region,” which will include different AWS data centers. In September 2016, Microsoft ( MSFT ) opened its first two UK data centers. \nIn late 2015, Oracle’s ( ORCL ) management shared that it had increased its data center delivery capacity from 0.5 megawatts to 45 megawatts, a whopping 90x rise. Investment in data centers enhances competitiveness in the cloud space \nThe SMAC (social, mobile, analytics, and cloud) revolution has given rise to data center requirements. According to a combined study done by Cisco Systems ( CSCO ), IDC, and Gartner, by 2018, ~78% of workloads are likely to be processed by cloud data centers, whereas traditional data centers will process the remaining 22%. \nAccording to Jeremy Duke, Synergy Research Group’s founder and chief analyst, “While total spending on data center infrastructure remains relatively flat, cloud share of that spending continues to rise as an ever-increasing portion of computer workloads migrate to either public or private clouds.” \nIt’s Amazon’s ( AMZN ), Microsoft’s, IBM’s, and Google’s ( GOOG ) investments in data centers that set them apart from their peers. \nJohn Dinsdale, research director at Synergy Research Group, said, “What marks them out as different is their global presence, marketing muscle, ability to fund huge investments in hyperscale data centers and, in most cases, a determination to succeed in the market. “ \nIn early 2016, RBC Capital reported that Amazon, Microsoft, and Google collectively spent ~$26 billion in capital expenditure in 2015. Google alone invested ~$10 billion to build its cloud operations in 2015. The majority of this capital went toward cloud and data centers. According to Data Center Knowledge, cloud service providers consistently say that spending on data centers forms the biggest portion of their budgets. {\"metrics\":[\"Open\"],\"tickers\":[\"IBM\",\"GOOG\",\"AMZN\",\"MSFT\",\"ORCL\"],\"ticker_names\":[\"International Business Machines Corp.\",\"Google Inc\",\"Amazon.com, Inc.\",\"Microsoft Corporation\",\"Oracle Corporation\"]} X",

      "text": "A Closer Look at IBM’s Growth-Chasing Strategy PART 10 OF 14 Why IBM’s Leadership in the IoT Space Bodes Well for Investors By Anne Shields | Nov 29, 2016 2:07 pm EST IBM is a leader in IoT space \nEarlier in the series, we discussed the contribution of the Expert Personal Shopper (or XPS) platform to IBM’s ( IBM ) Interactive Experience (or iX) division. \nLast week, IBM announced that it had been named as a leader in Forrester’s Wave report on IoT (Internet of Things) software platforms. The report also named IBM as a leader in the IDC (International Data Corporation) MarketScape for IoT consulting and global systems integration services. AI expected to be an innovation accelerator in the technology space \nWe know that cognitive computing, cloud computing, mobile, and IoT are technologies that will shape the future of IT (information technology). This explains why IBM has invested billions of dollars into machine learning and AI (artificial intelligence) through partnerships and acquisitions to develop its Watson platform. \nTaking this initiative further, in October 2016, IBM announced an investment of $200 million to develop its Watson IoT headquarters centered on blockchain and security in Munich ( EWG ). IBM’s $200 million IoT investment is part of the company’s overall $3 billion investment in IoT, with a focus on Europe. \nLast week, the company launched the IBM Watson IoT Consulting Solutions practice, which encompasses 1,500 experts across its headquarters in Munich and eight other companies’ IoT centers across Asia, Europe ( EFA ), and the Americas. \nIn October 2016, IBM announced its acquisition of Promontory Financial Group to boost its recently created Watson Financial Services. Promontory is a consulting company with expertise in financial regulation and compliance. \nLynne Parker, director of the Division of Information and Intelligent Systems for the National Science Foundation, stated that cognitive computing “is often a complete architecture of multiple AI subsystems that work together.” \nIDC considers cognitive computing to be “one of six Innovation Accelerators that will drive digital transformation by opening new revenue streams, creating information-based organizations, and changing the way work is performed.” \nMicrosoft ( MSFT ) is also interested in the AI space, which is evident from its recent acquisitions of Genee and SwiftKey . Microsoft has also shown an interest in blockchain technology. In April 2016, it partnered with R3CV to develop this technology. Before finalizing the partnership with Microsoft, R3CV was in talks with IBM and Amazon ( AMZN ). {\"metrics\":[\"Open\"],\"tickers\":[\"IBM\",\"AMZN\",\"MSFT\",\"EFA\",\"EWG\"],\"ticker_names\":[\"International Business Machines Corp.\",\"Amazon.com, Inc.\",\"Microsoft Corporation\",\"iShares MSCI EAFE Index Fund (ETF)\",\"iShares MSCI Germany Index Fund (ETF)\"]} X",

      "text": "\nhttps://www.ibm.com/blogs/insights-on-business/retail/cybermonday/ So how was 2016 BlackFriday? \nThis past Friday I made my annual Black Friday Retail Rounds. OK, I was only in 5 or 6 stores in 1 city, but the results were consistent and also seem to align with nationally reported results. Here’s what I saw: Traffic was light. \nParking lots were pretty empty. Store traffic was light. Lines at checkout were short. Not very good sign. Associates in stores told me that traffic on Thursday was also light. Sales were light. \nI already mentioned that checkout lines seemed short. Additionally, those people checking out didn’t have full carts. They seemed to only be buying 1 or 2 sale items, and did not add other items to the cart. Since most of the BlackFriday sales are “Loss Leaders” (sold at a loss to get customers into the store), it’s crucial that retailers get consumers to buy non-deal items. It doesn’t look like that happened this year. \nThere were some examples of very poor merchandising. One retailer that will go nameless had all of its sale merchandise displayed in their central aisle that goes around their entire store. The merchandise was blocking entry into the “normal” pads of the store, which is where the standard non-sale merchandise is on display. As a result, they hurt the sale of ”normal merchandise” and thereby hurt their sales and even worse their margin. \nThese BlackFriday results did translate nationally. BlackFriday sales slid 10.4% for Bricks & Mortar chains, according to RetailNext. 2 day (Thursday and Friday) Bricks & Mortar sales were down 5%, and BlackFriday Transactions down 7.9%. Sale merchandise didn’t sell. \nMany stores have “Door Buster” deals. These are a limited number of items that are on sale at deep discounts, like 50% off. Usually retailers sell out of these items within an hour. This year I found many deals available at 10:00 AM. People didn’t line up and didn’t buy them. Omni-Channel was alive and well. \nI was visiting family in New Jersey, and I live in Nashville. While walking around in Best Buy I saw some really nice tower speakers at 50% off. I mentioned to an associate that I would have loved to buy them, but I couldn’t because I was flying home. He said he’d be happy to ship them home for me for free. Great price and free shipping. They made the sale, even though I really didn’t plan to buy anything. Even on Black Friday, Omni Channel is alive and well. On-Line Retails. \nBlackFriday On-Line advertising was very heavy this year, and many people opted not to buy in-store. Consumers spent $3.34 billion shopping online on Friday, a 21.6 percent increase from the same day last year, according to Adobe, which tracks online retail transactions. Additionally, shoppers used their mobile devices on BlackFriday more than ever, as mobile purchases surged 33 percent on Black Friday to $1.2 billion. \nThe trend also suggests that consumers are less willing to hold out for potential online deals traditionally found on CyberMonday, which is the Monday after Thanksgiving and has traditionally been the busiest day of the year for online shopping. \nWill this be a Merry Christmas Season? \nSo how will Sales be this Holiday Season? According to the National Retail Federation, total holiday season sales are expected to jump 3.6 percent to $655.8 billion this year. There are many reasons for this, from a strong post-election stock market to a better job market and general optimism. I’d feel better about this prediction if Black Friday Sales had been stronger, but given the low profit level of Black Friday, lower Black Friday Sales could help the holiday season’s profitability. \nAre you curious how This holiday season will affect business and future Holiday season sales? Reach out to me. I’d be happy to discuss it! \n\n\nThe postings on this site are my own and don’t necessarily represent IBM’s positions, strategies or opinions. \nIf you’d like to read more of my CPG Blogs, Look here.

      "text": "Printed Page Length: 6 pages Number of Figures : 1 By: David Schubmehl , Stewart Bond , Greg Girard , Maureen Fleming , Carrie Solinger , Dan Vesset Abstract \nThis IDC Perspective summarizes some of IDC's key overall takeaways from the second World of Watson conference, which took place October 24–27 in Las Vegas, and how this conference is now indicative of the transformation of the cognitive/AI industry from research only to commercialization. It also provides a series of recommendations that CTOs and CIOs should be thinking about as they begin to incorporate cognitive/AI systems into their organizations. \nAccording to Dave Schubmehl, research director and lead analyst for IDC's Cognitive Systems and Content Analytics research, \"Intelligent applications based on cognitive computing, artificial intelligence, and deep learning are the next wave of technology transforming how consumers and enterprises work, learn, and play. The latest World of Watson conference demonstrated that the cognitive/AI industry is transforming from research only to commercialization, and IBM's Watson technologies have emerged as a series of commercially available products and services that are now ready for prime time. IDC recommends that organizations actively evaluate cognitive/AI tools like Watson Conversation for suitability and feasibility in areas such as customer service, product recommendations, and automated advisors.\" Executive Snapshot | Situation Overview | Advice for the Technology Buyer | Learn More Subscriptions Covered",

Subscribe Forbes CMO Interview: Calvin Klein’s Melisa Goldie \nElizabeth Wood used to work at IBM. She recently resigned from her position as senior content strategist, a job she held for the previous two years. People resign all the time from roles, so that is nothing new. What is different about Ms. Wood’s resignation is a) why we she did it and b) what she did next. \nOn November 15, 2016, Ginni Rometty, chairman, president and CEO of IBM, unleashed an open letter that—among other things—offered President-elect Donald Trump suggestions to help America. In her note, Rometty wrote, “I know that you are committed to help America’s economy grow in ways that are good for all its people.” IBM Chairman, President and CEO Ginni Rometty (Photo by Ethan Miller/Getty Images) \nGiven the divisive and at times vitriolic rhetoric that Trump spoke of during his campaign in an attempt to attract voters, Rometty’s letter has surprised some. Perhaps it was due to the neutral tone and matter-of-fact propositions. Others were downright shocked. A few were quite dismayed. \nYou can add Elizabeth Wood’s name to the column of dismayed. \nWhen I caught up with Elizabeth to ask why she had resigned from IBM, she said, “Ms. Rometty’s letter was the reason entirely.” She first found out about Rometty’s letter via Twitter. “I found it terrifying,” she continued. “Not only was IBM choosing to legitimize the president-elect, they were choosing to be so loud and public about it. No job is perfect, but her letter made me take a look at the work I was doing and say, ‘Why? What am I contributing to?’” \nAfter reading the letter, Elizabeth did some soul searching. One might argue she was questioning both her personal purpose (what am I here for, who am I, and how am I going to show up every day at work?) as well as her organization’s purpose. She went probing, wondering if IBM’s most senior leader’s alignment with Trump was something she could live with, be it at work or in life. Ultimately, Elizabeth began to question IBM’s purpose. \nThat very day, after reading Ms. Rometty’s letter in support of Trump, Elizabeth scheduled a meeting with her supervisor and put in her notice. \nShe quit. Elizabeth had nowhere to go. There was no job waiting for her afterward. \nPrevious to the letter, she was relatively engaged in her role and with IBM on the whole. “Working for a company as massive as IBM has its challenges,” she suggested, “but also its rewards.” Elizabeth alluded to frustrations, but many benefits as well. She also saw a long-term future. \n“I was in talks with my manager to potentially relocate to London, which would have had me with IBM for some time. However, after seeing the letter and what it promised, I knew a paycheck is not a reason to compromise your principles. The threat is too dangerous for too many people to stay silent.” \nElizabeth took action. Not only did she resign from her role, she took it upon herself to write her own open letter . One line stuck out for me, which led me to hunting down Elizabeth for an interview: \n“The choice to leave IBM did not come lightly. I am not leaving for another offer, nor do I have a safety net to fall back on.” \nThere is much to glean from Elizabeth and her actions. Her bravery ought to be commended. With student loans to pay and the living expenses of New York City nipping at her heels, she was resolute that a paycheck was not going to keep her shackled to a role—or an organization—she could no longer support. Elizabeth looked in her personal purpose mirror and asked if she had fallen out of the ‘sweet spot.’ \n“I think in this country,” she emphasized during our interview, “we feel we have to make choices and concessions often when it comes to work. How else will we feed our families and put a roof over our heads? How else will we have access to healthcare when we’re sick? But that doesn’t mean we are forced to ignore our conscience when we feel we are contributing to something that is dangerous and wrong.” \nElizabeth has become a shining example of what organizations need: employees with purpose. More of them in fact. \nWork is not merely a paycheck; it needs to be part of one’s overarching sense of meaning. If the organization we are employed by behaves in ways that run counter to our own personal purpose, we should be taking action, not sitting on the sidelines and pretending everything is fine. Apathy is the path toward disengagement. Put differently, purpose first starts with you. \nOn the topic of the workplace itself, Elizabeth said, “There is a lot of talk lately about work, especially in tech, about this idea that you should appeal to your people though perks, free food, etc. Nobody truly cares about that and if they do it’s because they’re looking for a distraction from their work. People want to be respected and valued for their worthwhile contributions to a company.” \nAre you distracted by the perquisites at work? Are you ignoring the signs that you may be in a “job mindset” at work, one where your role has simply become a paycheck, devoid of any value or higher purpose? Are you sitting around waiting for the pension to kick in or for your stock options to vest? \nHas your CEO or direct boss behaved in a way that has left you questioning why you are there in the first place? \n“Everyone deserves to work for a place that demonstrates consistent and unflinching respect for human decency,” Elizabeth concluded. “Everyone needs an awareness of their role in society and the world at large, especially when it comes for speaking on behalf of their workforce.” \nImagine what some of the employees at Wells Fargo or Volkswagen are going through these days. \nI applaud Elizabeth for taking a stand. She not only has demonstrated courage, Elizabeth will go places in this world based on her “North Star” of purpose. \nThe underlying lesson via Elizabeth is to look in that mirror every day and ask yourself: “Am I living my life—and working in an organization—that fuels my personal purpose?” \nIf not, like Elizabeth, be brave and make a change. Don’t wait for it to magically appear. ",

      "text": "Share By Jennifer Wagner \nDo you remember IBM's Watson computer that played against two of the top Jeopardy champions in 2011 and won? That wasn't the end of Watson. In addition to other uses, IBM created the Watson Mobile Developer Challenge . This competition encouraged developers and entrepreneurs to create consumer and business apps made with IBM's Watson cognitive computing capabilities. One of the 2014 winners, Elemental Path , has created CogniToys, an interactive toy that talks and has a personality, and that will learn and grow with your child. \nDon't get too excited yet. CogniToys is a KickStarter project and won't be shipping until November. But on the bright side, think of what a great holiday gift this will make. If you pledge to support an item, such as this, on KickStarter, you get the item at a cost either less than or at retail, and you receive yours before anyone else. And CogniToys has already reached its goal, so it should go through. \nThere have been talking toys before, but never one that could have an intelligent conversation with your child. \ncontinue reading below our video 5 Packable School Lunches All Kids Love This first CogniToy is a colorful Dinosaur that learns from its owner and therefore brings a personalized experience to each child. Even the dinosaurs personality will change over time. It is a cloud-based Internet connected smart toy. \nThe features of this lovable intelligent dinosaur CogniToy are : \nSpeech \nA child needs only to press the belly of the dinosaur to have a conversation with it. Your child can then ask questions and receive age-appropriate answers. The toy will tell you child stories and they can create stories together. They can even tell each other jokes. And your child can tell the toy to do things and see what it can and can not do. And the longer they are together, just as in real life, the better they will get to know each other. \nEducational \nThere are educational play modules built into the CogniToy experience. Your kids will have fun learning rhyming, spelling, vocabulary, mathematics and more, and the content will get more challenging as they learn. Parents can observe and moderate through a parent panel. \n\nWe have created the first truly \"connected\" toy that is able to reach out to our cloud platform and give back an age appropriate, personalized response to each utterance. \nIf it seems unbelievable that this can work, you should check out the book that was written about the creation of Watson by IBM for Jeopardy . Not only did I read it, but I interviewed the author and wrote about it. It is a fascinating story. \nIf you are very excited about product and want to be one of the first to get one, go to the CogniToys KickStarter page and become a supporter. If you aren't sure, check it out and see more details. It looks like the initial price, at least for supporters, will be $99. Not bad for an intelligent buddy for your child.",

      "text": "on Saturday December 03, 2016 @03:39PM from the rise-of-the-virtual-machines dept. An anonymous reader writes: This week saw the first proof of concept for Node.js API (or NAPI for short), \"making module maintainers' lives easier by defining a stable module API that is independent from changes in [Google's JavaScript engine] V8 and allowing modules to run against newer versions of Node.js without recompilation .\" Their announcement cites both the efforts of the Node.js API working group and of ChakraCore, the core part of the Chakra Javascript engine that powers Microsoft Edge. And there was also a second announcement -- that the Node.js build system \"will start producing nightly node-chakracore builds , enabling Node.js to be used with the ChakraCore JavaScript engine. \"These initial efforts are stepping stones to make Node.js VM-neutral, which would allow more opportunities for Node.js in IoT and mobile use cases as well as a variety of different systems.\" One IBM runtime developer called it \"a concrete step toward the strategic end goal of VM neutrality,\" and the Node.js Foundation believes that the API will ultimately result in \"more modules to choose from, and more stability with modules without the need to continually upgrade.\" ",

      "text": "In a new report from The Intercept , 8 out of 9 major technology firms either gave no reply or took no position when asked if they would cooperate with the incoming Trump administration in building a national registry of Muslims. Only a spokesperson for Twitter made clear the company would not cooperate.\nMicrosoft said it was \"not going to talk about hypotheticals at this point,\" while pointing to company statements on security collaboration between government and the tech industry.\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune 's technology newsletter.\nBooz Allen Hamilton declined to answer the question. IBM , Apple , Google , Facebook, SRA International, and Canada's CGI did not respond to The Intercept's inquiry.\nThe Intercept says it sought answers for two weeks, reaching out to companies via phone and email.\nPresident-Elect Donald Trump and his transition team have waffled on several of his campaign promises, but they seem to still be considering a registry of immigrants from Muslim countries, and possibly of Muslim Americans. Under such a system, immigrants or citizens in a database could be subject to interrogations and other forms of monitoring.\nHow exactly such a system would work is still unclear, but it's easy to imagine information harvested from social media, big data analytics, and large-scale database infrastructure being attractive tools for anyone trying to build it.\nFor more on privacy and security, watch our video. \nIt's a bit surprising to see that Apple did not provide a reply to the inquiry, considering the months-long legal battle it waged against the FBI over providing tools to access an iPhone used by a terrorist attacker. The same could be said for Google, whose longtime motto \"Don't Be Evil\" was often interpreted as a promise to act responsibly with users' data.\nAs The Intercept's Sam Biddle made clear, providing no answer isn't the same as \"tacitly endorsing\" a Muslim registry. But the hesitancy of normally pro-privacy companies to take a position could be seen as an index of a political landscape that has shifted massively.",

      "text": "\n© 2016 Time Inc. All rights reserved. Facebook, Google, Microsoft, IBM, and Apple Don’t Rule Out Helping Track Muslims \nIn a new report from The Intercept , 8 out of 9 major technology firms either gave no reply or took no position when asked if they would cooperate with the incoming Trump administration in building a national registry of Muslims. Only a spokesperson for Twitter made clear the company would not cooperate. \nMicrosoft said it was “not going to talk about hypotheticals at this point,” while pointing to company statements on security collaboration between government and the tech industry. Get Data Sheet , Fortune ’s technology newsletter. \nBooz Allen Hamilton declined to answer the question. IBM , Apple , Google , Facebook, SRA International, and Canada’s CGI did not respond to The Intercept’s inquiry. \nThe Intercept says it sought answers for two weeks, reaching out to companies via phone and email. \nPresident-Elect Donald Trump and his transition team have waffled on several of his campaign promises, but they seem to still be considering a registry of immigrants from Muslim countries, and possibly of Muslim Americans. Under such a system, immigrants or citizens in a database could be subject to interrogations and other forms of monitoring. \nHow exactly such a system would work is still unclear, but it’s easy to imagine information harvested from social media, big data analytics, and large-scale database infrastructure being attractive tools for anyone trying to build it. For more on privacy and security, watch our video. \nIt’s a bit surprising to see that Apple did not provide a reply to the inquiry, considering the months-long legal battle it waged against the FBI over providing tools to access an iPhone used by a terrorist attacker. The same could be said for Google, whose longtime motto “Don’t Be Evil” was often interpreted as a promise to act responsibly with users’ data. \nAs The Intercept’s Sam Biddle made clear, providing no answer isn’t the same as “tacitly endorsing” a Muslim registry. But the hesitancy of normally pro-privacy companies to take a position could be seen as an index of a political landscape that has shifted massively. ",

      "text": "Blocked Unblock Follow Following Node.js Foundation is a collaborative open source project dedicated to building and supporting the Node.js platform. https://nodejs.org/en/ 4 days ago IBM, Intel, Microsoft, Mozilla and NodeSource Join Forces on Node.js API; Node.js Build System will Start Producing Nightly node-chakracore Builds Part of Node.js Foundation’s mission is growing Node.js everywhere. The Node.js platform is already available on a variety of VMs, like Samsung’s JerryScript , a lightweight JavaScript engine for the Internet of Things. While many steps are needed to allow Node.js to work in VM environments outside of V8, the work the Node.js API working group and ChakraCore are doing are important steps to offer greater choice. Today, we are excited to announce several initial milestones in these efforts. The first is centered around Node.js API (ABI Stable Module API or NAPI for short), which is focused on defining a stable module API that is independent from changes in V8. Today, the first proof of concept in these efforts will be on display at Node.js Interactive North America . Arunesh Chandra, senior program manager for ChakraCore at Microsoft, is demoing the NAPI during his talk at 4:10 pm CT in Salon 6. All talks recorded at Node.js Interactive will be available after the event on our YouTube page . The second milestone, outside of the Node.js API work, is with ChakraCore. The Node.js build system will start producing nightly node-chakracore builds, enabling Node.js to be used with the ChakraCore JavaScript engine. Arunesh Chandra will also discuss the progress of this work in his presentation. These initial efforts are stepping stones to make Node.js VM-neutral, which would allow more opportunities for Node.js in IoT and mobile use cases as well as a variety of different systems. NAPI: Creating a Stable API for the Module Ecosystem The Node.js module community is massive with more than a billion weekly package downloads. The initial work from the Node.js API group is focused on making module maintainers’ lives easier by defining a stable module API that is independent from changes in V8 and allowing modules to run against newer version of Node.js without recompilation. These initiatives will also drastically help the experience of those using Node.js as they will have more modules to choose from and more stability with modules without the need to continually upgrade. This will all result in more choice and a more vibrant ecosystem to drive future innovation. “This work on the Node API is exciting for the community because it will lead to greater stability in the module ecosystem due to independence from Node.js version changes, giving the developer greater flexibility as new Node.js versions are introduced,” said Michael Dawson, runtime developer at IBM, “Furthermore, this enhancement is a concrete step toward the strategic end goal of VM neutrality. Together these provide significant value and expanded choice to the enterprise by allowing them to more easily leverage the broad range of capabilities available through the module ecosystem.” “A large part of the Foundation’s work is focused on improving versatility and confidence in Node.js,” said Mikeal Rogers, community manager of the Node.js Foundation. “Node.js API efforts support our mission of spreading Node.js to as many different environments as possible. This is the beginning of a big community web project that will give VMs the same type of competition and innovation that you see within the browser space.” A more detailed roadmap for the work on the Node.js API is available here . We encourage you to be a part of this project by experimenting with this new API, testing it with your environments and reporting back any fixes or improvements you need. Node.js and ChakraCore The Node.js build system will start producing nightly node-chakracore builds, enabling Node.js to be used with the ChakraCore JavaScript engine. “Allowing Node.js to work on multiple engines enables Node.js to run on a variety of different systems in a highly optimized way — including the IoT systems,” said Arunesh Chandra, senior program manager for ChakraCore at Microsoft. “We are working closely with the open source community and contributors from many companies, and believe this collaboration allows for more innovation and creates more choice for Node.js developers, which will spur new use cases in the future.” “Huge strides have been made in improving the technical state of how Node.js interacts and manages expectations with the underlying JavaScript VM,” said Dan Shaw, CTO and Co-Founder of NodeSource. “The fully open source nature of ChakraCore makes testing new features extremely easy. We look forward to continuing our efforts with both of these initiatives.” Node-ChakraCore also is continuing to improve debugging in Node.js with Time-Travel debugging, which allows developers to easily capture traces for post mortem debugging and step back in time using a supported debugger. All of these technologies and topics will also be discussed during Arunesh’s presentation. More information can be found here on Microsoft’s blog. What is VM Neutrality? What is the benefit of VM Neutrality? VM neutrality describes a state of Node.js where Node Core is neutral to the JS Engine that is powering it via open standards and open APIs. The idea is to create a more formal interface between Node.js and its VM. In a VM-neutral world, the Node.js ecosystem, especially the native modules, continues to seamlessly work on different JS VMs on a variety of different devices and workloads. With VM neutrality, Node.js will be able take advantage of new devices and workloads; give developers the ability to extend the reach of the Node.js ecosystem, so they can reuse code to target more devices and workloads; and standardize multi-VM efforts from already existing forks. Boost to Node.js As The Platform for IoT IoT is a high-growth market with the spend growing from $591.7 billion in 2014 to $1.3 trillion in 2019. The install base of IoT endpoints is expected to grow to more than 25.6 billion in 2019, hitting 30 billion in 2020, according to Verizon’s recent Internet of Things report . Node.js has increasingly become the platform of choice for IoT applications and embedded devices, and VM neutrality will encourage even more Node.js growth in this area, according to Rogers. With many VM vendors optimized for different hardware profiles, Node.js will be able to extend to various VM platforms giving JavaScript and Node.js users alike the flexibility to use this language and platform anywhere and everywhere. Developers will also be able to use the smaller, focused runtime of Node.js without a full VM, which will drastically improve performance in this environment. VM Neutrality To Benefit Mobile App Developers Once Node.js is untethered from a specific VM, developers will be able to pair it with different VMs for the particular needs of mobile applications, extending the benefits of Node.js (ease of use, higher density coding, performance) to more mobile app developers. How Can I Get Involved? If you want to get more involved with the Node.js API efforts, please: Convert a native module to use ABI stable APIs and report issues on conversion and performance; Port ABI stable APIs to your fork of Node and let us know if there are gaps; Review the roadmap and see how can you can help accelerate this project.

(NYSE: PFE) today announced a collaboration that will utilize IBM Watson for Drug Discovery to help accelerate Pfizer's research in immuno-oncology, an approach to cancer treatment that uses the body's immune system to help fight cancer. Pfizer is one of the first organizations worldwide to deploy Watson for Drug Discovery, and the first to customize the cloud-based cognitive tool – tapping in to Watson's machine learning, natural language processing, and other cognitive reasoning technologies to support the identification of new drug targets, combination therapies for study, and patient selection strategies in immuno-oncology. Immunotherapies, which modify a patient's immune system to recognize and target cancer cells using a combination of vaccines, immunomodulators, and small/large molecules, are reshaping the field of oncology. Oncology researchers at Pfizer will use Watson for Drug Discovery to analyze massive volumes of disparate data sources, including licensed and publicly available data as well as Pfizer's proprietary data. With this new tool, Pfizer researchers will analyze and test hypotheses to generate evidence-based insights for real-time interaction. The customized technology can also support efficient safety assessments. Cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, and is arguably one of the most complex diseases known to mankind.1 Many researchers believe that the future of immuno-oncology lies in combinations tailored to unique tumor characteristics, which could transform the cancer treatment paradigm and enable more oncology patients to be treated. \"Pfizer remains committed to staying at the forefront of immuno-oncology research,\" said Mikael Dolsten, President, Pfizer Worldwide Research & Development. \"With the incredible volume of data and literature available in this complex field, we believe that tapping into advanced technologies can help our scientific experts more rapidly identify novel combinations of immune-modulating agents. We are hopeful that by leveraging Watson's cognitive capabilities in our drug discovery efforts, we will be able to bring promising new immuno-oncology therapeutics to patients more quickly.\" Laurie Olson, Executive Vice President, Strategy, Portfolio and Commercial Operations, Pfizer, said, \"At Pfizer, we are entering a new frontier in data innovation in which we are investing in a range of new technologies and digital solutions to help us dynamically mine both internal and external data sources to find new connections in science, as well as help us better understand how diseases progress and how they could potentially be treated. Applying the power of cognitive computing to an area that is a core part of our DNA – discovering new medicines – is helping Pfizer to learn how we can most efficiently discover those immuno-oncology therapies that have the best chance of successful outcomes for patients.\" The newly launched Watson for Drug Discovery is a cloud-based offering that aims to help life sciences researchers discover new drug targets and alternative drug indications. The average researcher reads between 200 and 300 articles in a given year2, while Watson for Drug Discovery has ingested 25 million Medline abstracts, more than 1 million full-text medical journal articles, 4 million patents and is regularly updated. Watson for Drug Discovery can be augmented with an organization's private data such as lab reports and can help researchers look across disparate data sets to surface relationships and reveal hidden patterns through dynamic visualizations. \"We believe that the next great medical innovations will emerge as researchers and scientists find new patterns in existing bodies of knowledge. In order to do this, they need access to R&D tools that can help them efficiently navigate the opportunities and challenges presented by the explosion of data globally,\" said Lauren O'Donnell, Vice President of Life Sciences, IBM Watson Health. \"IBM is honored to collaborate with Pfizer, and put Watson for Drug Discovery to work to support efforts in bringing life-saving immunotherapies to doctors and patients worldwide.\" About IBM Watson Health Watson is the first commercially available cognitive computing capability representing a new era in computing. The system, delivered through the cloud, analyzes high volumes of data, understands complex questions posed in natural language, and proposes evidence-based answers. Watson continuously learns, gaining in value and knowledge over time, from previous interactions. In April 2015, the company launched IBM Watson Health and the Watson Health Cloud platform.

      "text": "VM-Neutral Node.js API Unveiled, As NodeSource Collaborates With Microsoft, Mozilla, Intel and IBM Published by Slashdot on Sun, 04 Dec 2016 An anonymous reader writes:This week saw the first proof of concept for Node.js API (or NAPI for short), \"making module maintainers' lives easier by defining a stable module API that is independent from changes in [Google's JavaScript engine] V8 and allowing modules to run against newer versions of Node.js without recompilation.\" Their announcement cites both the efforts of the Node.js API working group and of ChakraCore, the core part of the Chakra Javascript engine that powers Microsoft Edge. And there was also a second announcement -- that the Node.js build system \"will start producing nightly node-chakracore builds, enabling Node.js to be used with the ChakraCore JavaScript engine. \"These initial efforts are stepping stones to make Node.js VM-neutral, which would allow more opportunities for Node.js in IoT and mobile use cases as well as a variety of different systems.\" One IBM runtime developer called it \"a concrete step toward the strategic end goal of VM neutrality,\" and the Node.js Foundation believes that the API will ultimately result in \"more modules to choose from, and more stability with modules without the need to continually upgrade.\" Read more of this story at Slashdot.",

      "text": "Report on IBM Aspera experience on IBM Power High Speed Data Transfer with IBM Aspera on IBM Power Overview Skill Level: Any Skill Level \nBy combining Aspera with IBM Power and IBM cloud, customers have a practical way to transport massive data files to and from the cloud. Showcase the differences between Aspera FASP with that of the standard AIX scp command in transfer performance. Ingredients \nSystem requirements for IBM Aspera Enterprise Server \nSSH Server. Version 5.2 or higher is recommended and OpenSSH 4.4 or newer Verify that the machine's host’s file has an entry for \"127.0.0.1 localhost.\" Check /etc/hosts Verify that SELINUX is disabled If you have a local firewall on your server, then need to allow the UDP port (55001, by default) for multicast traffic To standardize the port for use in Aspera transfers, Aspera recommends using TCP/33001 and turn off Port 22. Secure SSH settings (Follow Aspera-Enterprise / Client Documentation) Aspera transfer products use system accounts for connection authentication, and these accounts require additional configuration for Aspera transfers. You can specify user-based settings, such as bandwidth, document root (docroot) and file handling rules in aspera.conf (Aspera transfer product's configuration file) file located at /opt/aspera/etc/ aspera.conf. An example of aspera.conf in the following location at /opt/aspera/etc/samples/aspera-everything.conf Step-by-step Introduction & Recipe Objective \nBy combining Aspera with IBM Power and IBM cloud, customers have a practical way to transport massive data files to and from the cloud. Aspera makes cloud computing even faster, more predictable and more cost effective for big data transfers such as enterprise storage backup, sharing virtual images or bursting to the cloud for increased computing capacity. \nWhat is Aspera? \nAspera solutions enable organizations to move, share and synchronize large files and data sets, digital assets and media quickly and securely. These highly scalable solutions are built to handle the largest data requirements at maximum speed, regardless of data size, type, and distance or network conditions. \nWhat are the benefits of Aspera? \nAt the core of the Aspera solutions is the patented Aspera Fast, Adaptive, and Secure Protocol (FASP®), a breakthrough transfer protocol that uses existing wide area network (WAN) infrastructure and commodity hardware to achieve speeds up to hundreds of times faster than FTP and HTTP. FASP transport technology provides enterprise-grade security and exceptional reliability and bandwidth control. \nFASP (Fast, Adaptive and Secure Protocol) \nIt provides reliable data delivery under ideal conditions, but has an inherent throughput bottleneck that becomes obvious, and severe, with increased packet loss and latency found on long-distance WANs. \nAdding more bandwidth does not change the effective throughput. File transfer speeds do not improve and expensive bandwidth is underutilized. \nTCP’s security and monitoring are also insufficient for today’s business concerns about security of their digital assets. \nIt uses the mechanism that identifies and retransmits precisely the real packet loss on the channel. At 10% packet loss, FASP achieves 90% bandwidth utilization with less than 1% redundant data overhead. \nThe FASP protocol provides complete built-in security without compromising transfer speed. The security model, based solely on open standards cryptography, consists of SSH authentication, on-the-fly data encryption using strong cryptography (AES-128) for privacy of the transferred data, and integrity verification per data block, to safeguard against man-in-the-middle and anonymous UDP attacks. \nAspera Enterprise Server \nFor businesses that cannot afford the delays and risks of shipping physical media across the world, or the slow, unreliable and insecure FTP transfers, Aspera transfer servers such as Aspera Enterprise Server offers solutions that guarantees results regardless of transfer distances, file sizes or network conditions. Combining patented FASP® technology, optimized cloud I/O for cloud deployments, and comprehensive transfer and user management, our transfer servers move large data sets over the WAN with unrivaled speed (100X faster than FTP or HTTP), flexible bandwidth control, 100% reliability and bullet-proof security. \nObjective: \nOur aim was to compare Aspera FASP with that of the standard AIX scp command to see the differences in transfer performance and processor load on Power systems. We wished to see if Aspera FASP could provide performance improvement not just in a WAN configuration but also in a LAN environment as well. In addition we wanted to characterize how performance changed when multiple simultaneous transfers were taking place. Methodology \nThis documents is focused on to showcases the performance gain when using the Aspera FASP protocol in environments with high round-trip time, packet loss and when large files are transferred over networks. We have configured Aspera Enterprise Server and Aspera Client in two environments. Below are the details of two main server configurations. \nConfiguration-1: Pair of servers within the same lab, local network connection. \n\nNetwork Configuration \nLPAR statistics \nAspera License Cap on Server & Client: All Licensed Aspera Clients and Servers have a bandwidth capacity limit. \nConfiguration-2: Pair of servers located in different locations (India and Austin TX) \nInstall Aspera Enterprise Server & Aspera Client \nInstall Aspera Enterprise Server & Aspera Client. Run it as root using the following command: \nbash aspera-entsrv-3.6.0.120993-aix-6.1-ppc32.sh \nbash aspera-scp-client-3.6.0.120993-aix-6.1-ppc32.sh \nThings to be considered for using Aspera FASP transfer solution with ascp cli are as below: Aspera ascp is a fasp transfer program that is used to transfer data at the rate that fulfills the maximum bandwidth capacity. The transfer policy specified along with maximum and minimum transfer, determines the utilization of network resource by fasp transfer. Aspera Target Rate: Aspera Clients always request a target rate. Aspera servers will either allow the client to transfer at the rate requested, or will throttle the client to a rate which is set by the server. \nEx: ascp -P 33001 -QT -l 1000M -m 1M root@destination_host:tmp/1GB /tmp \n-T: Disable Encryption \n-P: Port used to Transfer \n-l: Set the target transfer rate (1000Mbps) \n-m: Set the minimum transfer rate (1Mbps) Currently the ascp process is not multithreaded, so if you have multiple concurrent transfers, it is important to have multiple CPU or multi core system, so you can spread the CPU load. To improve the transfer speed, you need to look into components- physical bandwidth, CPU and I/O resources. The bandwidth is one of the most common limitations on transfer performance; CPU can be a bottleneck, especially when encryption is enabled. The I/O limitation is more common with high concurrency or high packet loss. The network bandwidth capacity can be determined by isolating it from other performance limiting factors using the ascp cli options: –no-write & –no-read. These options simulate reading and writing. In addition to this, you can enable or disable encryption to see the impact of it on bandwidth. \nEx: ascp -QT -l 500M –no-read –no-write bigfile user@destination:/ \n§ The –-no-read –-no-write testing is only for the network and not the storage \n§ To test the CPU speed of the end systems (enabled encryption – remove “T”) \n§ To test the endpoints' write speed, you the give option –-no-write \n§ To test the receiving side's ability to write to storage, you mention –-no-read Test Cases \nWe performed data transfer testing with standard SCP and Aspera FASP transfer solution on IBM Power Systems located in same lab where RTT: 0ms and in environment that has high RTT: 262ms where the IBM Power systems are located at Austin and India. The tests show that there is a significant higher throughput achieved when using Aspera FASP than with standard SCP transfers. List of Test Cases performed in the two server configurations: \nCase 1: Transfer speed of large files (10GB, 5GB, 500MB, 200MB) using Aspera FASP and SCP \nCase 2: Performance test runs to test the bottleneck using ascp (without reading and writing to disk) \nCase 3: To test the parallel functioning of TCP and FASP over the same network. Case 4: Test with Aspera Demo Server Results \nTest Case 1: Transfer of data between pair of servers within the same lab \nTo test the download transfer rate, data of 39GB that comprises of various files of size -100MB, 200MB, 500MB, 1GB, 5GB and 10GB; was downloaded from Aspera Enterprise Server to Aspera Client using the fasp program transfer: ascp cli. In this case, the servers are in same lab that are of 1Gbps network with RTT: 0ms. \nObservations: It is observed that Aspera transfer rate was 700Mbps and the download completed in 9.4min, whereas using the secure copy SCP, it took 22min to complete the download. \n\nTest Case 2: Transfer of data between pair of servers located in India (Aspera Client) and Austin (Aspera Enterprise Server) \nTo test the download transfer rate, small data set of 28GB that comprises of various files of size -100MB, 200MB, 500MB, 1GB, 5GB and 10GB and large data set of 500GB; was downloaded from Aspera Enterprise Server(Austin-TX) to Aspera Client(India) using the fasp program transfer: ascp cli. In this case, the servers are dispersed geographically and are of 1Gbps network with RTT: 262ms. \nObservations/Recommendations: With Aspera transfer, it took 12 min to transfer small data set of 28GB and for large data set of 500GB, it took 3 hours to complete, at a rate of 350Mbps – 450Mbps, whereas with standard SCP, at transfer rate 400KB/s it took almost 14hrs for download a 28GB file. The bandwidth is too low than that of the target rate as the transfer was over intranet bound with firewall. As firewall implements QOS (Quality of Service) and performs deep packet inspection (IDS/IPS), this is likely to cause slow transfers. As an Aspera best practice, disable the power saving feature to ensure it does not interfere with optimal performance on Aspera Client and Enterprise Server. \n\nTest Case3: Performance test for transfer data at target rate 1000Mbps \nThe Aspera transfer options (–no-read –no-write), eliminates either the reading from or writing to disk, as part of a transfer. \nObservations/Recommendations The Aspera transfer options –no-read –no-write shows that the network capacity, independent of storage throughput. (Note: Encryption is disabled). If the transfer rate is less than the target rate, then the transfer is either limited by network congestion, or endpoint CPU speed. \n§ Pair of servers within the same lab: Transfer rate achieved is 800Mbps with no packet loss. \n§ Pair of servers located at India & Austin: Transfer rate achieved is 414Mbps With encryption enabled, if the transfer rate is noticeably slower than that attained with disabled encryption, then it is for sure that the CPU will be a bottleneck with encrypted transfers. \n§ Pair of servers within the same lab: Transfer rate is 280Mbps \n§ Pair of servers located at India & Austin: 340Mbps Enabling write allows testing the receiving side's ability to write to storage. If the transfer rate is less than the target rate 1000Mbps, then it could be due to storage write speed limitation, which needs to be improving with some tuning. \n§ Pair of servers within the same lab: Transfer rate achieved is 650Mbps \n§ Pair of servers located at India & Austin: 320 Mbps Enabling reading allows you to test the endpoints' read/write speed. If the transfer rate is close to the target rate (1000Mbps), then there is no sender side storage limitation. But, if the transfer rate is considerably slower, then you do have a sender side storage limitation, which may be responsive to tuning. \n§ Pair of servers within the same lab: Transfer rate is 840Mbps -870Mbps \n§ Pair of servers located at India & Austin: 410Mbps \n\nTest Case 4: Parallel transfer \nThis is to test the parallel functioning of FASP, where multiple ascp processes runs and with TCP, where scp and ascp traffic compete each other. \nObservations/Recommendations Aspera FASP works well in mixed environments where standard scp and ascp run parallel over the same network. With multiple ascp processes, it is observed that the CPU utilization on Aspera Client and Enterprise Server is about 50% and the transfer rate achieved is about 425Mbps in case of servers in the same lab, whereas the same in the servers located at different locations, it is observed that the CPU utilization is 20-40% and the transfer rate is 270Mbps. The same in case of multiple standard scp processes, it is observed that the ssh and scp processes together consume 70% of CPU and the transfer rate achieved is 21MB/s on the servers within the same lab. In case of pair of servers located at India and Austin, the CPU utilization is 2-4% with transfer rate 430KB/s. In case of cross traffic where ascp and ssh and scp process run, it is observed that in case of servers in same lab, the CPU utilization is 65% with transfer rate 500Mbps for ascp and 20MB/s for SCP, whereas in the case of servers located at different locations, the CPU utilization is about 17-25% with transfer rate of 315Mbps with aspera and 450KB/s with standard scp. In case of parallel transfer on a dual-core system, you can configure to use multiple UDP ports say: 33001 & 33002 along with transfer rate(ensure that together the transfer rate is less or equal to the target rate). The two commands need to be executed in different terminal windows: \n> ascp -C 1:2 -O 33001 -l 100m /file root@10.0.0.2:/remote-dir \n> ascp -C 2:2 -O 33002 -l 100m /file root@10.0.0.2:/remote-dir \n\nTest Case 5: Download & upload Test from Aspera Demo Server: To make sure the software is working properly download and upload transfers between your system and the Aspera Demo Server. \nhttps://demo.asperasoft.com/aspera/user/ \nUsername / Password: aspera/demoaspera \nTested downloading a 10GB file from demo.asperasoft.com to Aspera Enterprise Server RTT is 69ms – 71ms. It took ~2min to download 10GB file. \nEx: ascp -P 33001 -QT -l 1000M -m 1M aspera@demo.asperasoft.com:aspera-test-dir-large/10GB /tmp \nThe general syntax for testing ascp connectivity is the following: \n[ASPERA_SCP_PASS=remote_password] ascp -wf -P ssh_port remote_user@remote_host:/ aspera processes do log with syslog and facility local2. To redirect aspera logs to a file, configure syslog accordingly. \necho 'local2.info /var/log/aspera.log'>> /etc/syslog.conf (give tab instead of space) touch /var/log/aspera.log refresh -s syslogd Conclusion \nIBM® Aspera Enterprise Server is an innovator in moving the world’s secure data at maximum speed. It delivers maximum transfer speed and optimal bandwidth utilization—regardless of file/data set size, network condition, or deployment model. It overcomes the limitations of TCP and reduces transmission times. In case of multiple concurrent transfers, CPU can be a bottleneck, especially when encryption is enabled, but with Aspera configured Power System, you can spread the CPU load. \n",

      "text": "3 of the Most Undervalued Tech Stocks Today EPAM Systems, MercadoLibre, and IBM are stocks that should be on value investors' radar. Keith Noonan Dec 4, 2016 at 1:02PM Image source: Getty Images. \nThe technology sector is known as the place to go for stocks with explosive growth potential, but expectations for significant and sustained performance increases can also come with big downsides. Many of tech's biggest names and promising upstarts are priced for high-flying earnings growth, and when that doesn't pan out, investors can be left holding the bag rather than holding a multibagger. However, not all tech stocks have lofty valuations that carry substantial risk. \nTo help investors generate leads for stocks with more upside than their current prices indicate, we asked three Motley Fool contributors to single out one of the most undervalued companies in tech. Read on to learn why they selected EPAM Systems ( NYSE:EPAM ) , MercadoLibre ( NASDAQ:MELI ) , and IBM ( NYSE:IBM ) . \nBrian Feroldi (EPAM Systems) : This year's surprise Brexit vote has cast a long shadow over many companies that do business in Europe. Included in that list is Pennsylvania-based EPAM Systems, a leading provider of product development and software engineering services. While this company is headquartered in the U.S. and has offices around the globe, the majority of its workforce is based out of Eastern Europe countries such as Belarus, Ukraine, and Russia. Combine that fact with the recent departure of its CFO and a few small downward revisions to earnings and it is no surprise to see that shares have trailed the market year-to-date. EPAM data by YCharts . \nThe company's waning share price has pulled its trailing price-to-earnings ratio all the way down to 35, which on the surface still looks like an \"overalued\" stock. However, I'd argue that investors who buy today are actually getting a bargain. \nMy reasoning is that the company is still projecting strong double-digit growth. For 2016, management is forecasting revenue growth of more than 26%. Over the next five years, analysts see profits growing in excess of 17% annually. Those are terrific growth rates, and since more than 90% of the company's revenue is recurring, I have high confidence that management can meet or exceed those figures. \nWhen companies are growing fast, it can be far more useful to look at forward estimates to get a better sense of value. Right now, EPAM stock is trading for less than 20 times next year's earnings estimates, which represents a tiny premium over the S&P 500 in general. I think that makes no sense since EPAM is growing much faster, is founder-led, and has a recurring revenue business model. Add it all up and I believe that EPAM Systems' stock is undervalued today, which is why I think it is a great stock to consider buying. \nBrian Stoffel (MercadoLibre) : It might sound odd to call a stock that's advanced 43% year-to-date \"undervalued,\" but in the case of MercadoLibre, I think that's exactly the case. \nThe key thing to understand about this Latin American e-commerce company is that it does business in local currency -- with Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, and Venezuela being the four largest markets. However, it reports revenue and earnings in U.S. dollars. With the strength of the dollar -- and the volatility of many Latin American currencies lately -- reported results look much worse than they really are. \nTake Brazil as a case in point. During 2015, MercadoLibre reported that Marketplace revenue shrank 9.1% -- not a promising sign. But in local currencies, business actually grew 23%. Of course, some of this was due to inflation, but the underlying trend is undeniable: MercadoLibre's growth is far from over. \nTrading at 58 times trailing earnings, it might be tough to call this stock \"cheap.\" But again, those figures are based on U.S. dollars, and it hides the underlying strength of MercadoLibre's platform. The company is becoming a mix of PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL), eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) , and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) . And the network effect that this ecosystem creates will be a force as the Latin American middle class continues to grow. \nIf you have a long enough time frame to allow currency fluctuations to smooth out, I believe you'll look back on today's prices and realize just how undervalued MercadoLibre really is. \nKeith Noonan (IBM) : Between its low price-to-earnings ratio, hefty dividend, and potential to shape and benefit from some of tech's most influential trends, there's a strong case to be made that International Business Machines is one of the most undervalued technology stocks around. \nIBM trades at roughly 12 times forward earnings estimates, which is well below the S&P 500 average forward earnings multiple of 18. The company's sales and earnings have been depressed due to continued erosion of its legacy software and hardware businesses, but it's making substantial progress in its efforts to transition to a cloud-focused model. \nIts last quarterly report saw revenue from its combined strategic imperatives segment (which includes cloud computing, analytics, artificial intelligence, and security) grow 16% year-over-year to reach $8 billion and 40% of sales. This was offset by a 21% sales decline in the company's systems segment, and overall revenues were down 0.3% even with sales added from acquisitions. So, IBM's cheap valuation reflects some justifiable uncertainty about its turnaround, but evidence is building that the company can reinvent itself and the surrounding concerns present a big opportunity for long-term investors. \nIBM also offers an attractive dividend. At current prices, its yield sits at 3.4%, and the company has boosted its annual payout for 16 years running. The company is a cash machine with $14.47 billion free cash flow generated over the trailing-12-month period, and the annual adjusted cost of distributing its current quarterly dividend represents just 36.8% of that figure. That leaves room for payout growth even if margins and sales continue to be challenged and capital expenditures rise as a result of the transformation process. \nWith a beaten-down valuation, the stock has substantial room to run if its turnaround gains ground, and its dividend component provides a buffer for riding the transition. \n\nBrian Feroldi owns shares of AMZN and MELI. Brian Feroldi has the following options: long January 2017 $195 calls on IBM, short January 2019 $185 puts on IBM, short January 2019 $180 puts on IBM, long January 2018 $175 calls on IBM, and short January 2018 $175 puts on IBM.

      "text": "IBM opens 'cyber-range' to practice security battles \nHave you ever handed your phone over to someone you didn’t know so that he or she could verify data you have saved in an app? A minister and his wife did and their story is a disturbing cautionary tale as to why you shouldn’t hand your phone over to anyone. \nThe following information comes from a lawsuit ( pdf ) against Toyota and a specific dealership as well as a Dallas Morning News report. \nPastor Tim Gautreaux and his wife, Claire, were interested in buying a Prius from Texas Toyota of Grapevine. They had taken the dealership’s advice and used an app to get pre-approved for financing via Capital One Financial Corporation. An internet car salesman claimed he needed to show the pre-approved financing information in the app to his manager. The pastor unlocked his phone and handed it over. \nGautreaux claimed the phone was out of his sight for about five minutes before it was returned. When the finance manager had questions, the pastor checked his phone; instead of the pre-approved info in the app being open, a photo of his wife “in a compromising stage of undress appeared on the screen.” \nThe pastor checked an app “that tracks and saves deleted emails” and discovered that a screenshot of the pre-approved financing had been emailed to the work email address as well as the personal email address of Grapevine Toyota’s new car sales director Matthew Thomas. Additionally, the pastor claimed there were two more emails containing “two different compromising photographs” of his wife sent to an email address “associated with a swingers’ website.” \nBeing a pastor, Gautreaux was “greatly concerned about the personal and professional ramifications of the dissemination of this personal information.” He took his concerns to a different Grapevine Toyota sales director who promised to investigate and fire the person responsible. Yet six hours later, the dealership had not found the person responsible “for the gross invasions of their privacy.” \nThe Grapevine police were told by the dealership’s owner that Thomas had the phone during the time the emails were sent. Eventually, Thomas was arrested and charged with a breaching a computer’s security, a class B misdemeanor. The lawsuit alleges that the Toyota dealership knew of “Thomas’ past improprieties” at the workplace and still employed him. \nThe lawsuit also claims that the pastor “had a reasonable expectation of privacy” – it didn’t occur to him that the private photos of his wife getting into and out of the bathtub would be accessed and made public on a swinger site. The intrusion was called something that “would be highly offensive to a reasonable person.” \nTheir attorney is Gloria Allred ; Dallas Morning News reported that “her past clients include women who accused celebrities such as Bill Cosby and Donald Trump of sexual assault.” \nThe lawsuit, which claims Toyota Motor North America and Texas Toyota of Grapevine are guilty of breach of contract, deceptive trade practices, negligence and public disclosure of private facts – seeks more than $1 million in damages. \nTexas Toyota told the Dallas Observer that it didn’t know about the lawsuit until December 1, the day it was filed. \nToyota North America told CBS 11: \nWhile we cannot comment on the allegations in the suit, it is important to note that Toyota of Grapevine is an independently owned dealership. Toyota Motor North America does not own, operate or manage Toyota of Grapevine; it does not hire, fire or direct the day-to-day activities of the dealership’s personnel; and it is not involved in matters concerning employees of independent dealers. \nBefore you hand your phone over to anyone, keep in mind that some police have the ability to suck all the data out of a phone in their possession in less than two minutes, which seems like a valid reason not to have your car insurance via an app that would require you to hand over your phone if you were ever pulled over. Some sketchy cops were stealing nude photos from female DUI suspects’ phones and making a “game” of it by forwarding the nude snaps in text messages to other cops. Potential snooping is one of the reasons why I didn’t want a Walmart employee to walk off with my smartphone while checking a price. \nIt remains to be seen what will happen with this lawsuit, but this case does serve as a sad reminder that you shouldn’t hand your phone over to anyone for any reason and believe your privacy will remain intact.

      "text": "INTI International University & Colleges is partnering with IBM Malaysia to introduce the IBM Innovation Center for Education (ICE) program.\nTaught by IBM certified experts, IBM ICE is a series of Undergraduate Programs and Academic courses for the Computing & IT and Business verticals. Devised in consultation with INTI and local industry experts, the IBM ICE program differentiates itself through a courseware developed by IBM Labs, its Learning Services Team, and several partners. The courseware is tailored according to the area of specialisation chosen, with the inclusion of links to reference materials, further study and Self-Assessment Questions.\nEarlier in October, INTI announced the findings of its landmark survey called the “Dichotomy of expectations among employers and new graduates” which revealed several gaps in expectations between employers and new graduates in terms of competency deemed essential to excel at a job. The most pressing dichotomy in expectations concerned digital literacy, where 30% of employers regarded it as the most essential competency needed for job performance. Meanwhile, most graduates rated it as the least important competency at only 4%.\nMalaysia’s rapid expansion of regional IT hubs in recent years has engendered an acute demand for talent in key positions, particularly in the field of big data, cloud services, and social computing.\nA study commissioned by Malaysian Digital Economy Corporation (MDeC) echoes the gap, noting that Malaysia needs more Big Data and Analytics (BDA) professionals to maintain a global competitive edge. The severity of the situation is made clearer when we factor in Malaysia’s goal to raise 2,000 data scientists and 16,000 data professionals by 2020. Currently, there are only 300 data scientists in Malaysia – both local and foreign . \nTim Bulow, CEO of INTI International University & Colleges said, “As a progressive mover in higher education, INTI is taking the initiative to address the IT talent void that is confronting Malaysia. Given the dire situation, we have activated a solution we think most effective, which is to collaborate with an industry leader like IBM in delivering the most updated and industry-relevant education to our students – equipping them with cutting-edge skills that will prepare them to not only bridge the gap in IT expertise but to be a leader in the field.”\nIBM has also been actively involved as a member of INTI’s Industry Advisory Board, lending their professional expertise to ensure our curriculum continues to meet market expectations. With its support and that of over 400 industry partners, INTI has recorded incredible graduate employability outcomes which has been validated by BDO Governance Advisory. This includes the fact that 98% of INTI graduates securing jobs within six months of graduation, 82% receiving higher salaries than the market average and 25% receiving job offers even before they graduate, explained Bulow.\nChong Chye Neo, managing director of IBM Malaysia said, “In a practice as dynamic as IT, it is imperative that students are updated with the latest knowledge and direction of the industry in order to continue in their abilities to be active contributors in the cognitive era. The ICE program is underscored with elements like the Subject Matter Experts sessions and the Teach the Teacher workshops to keep everyone industry-relevant.”\n \n ",

CEO Ginni Rometty is one of 16 business leaders who will advise President- elect Donald Trump as members of the President's Strategic and Policy Forum, Mr. Trump said Friday.\nThe group will meet with Mr. Trump to consult as he implements his plan to stem the flow of U.S. jobs to other countries. IBM is one of the technology companies he has criticized for offshoring jobs and manufacturing products abroad.\nMr. Trump's impending presidency has raised concerns among some tech CEOs who rely on manufacturing or inexpensive labor abroad. The president-elect, in a Nov. 6 campaign speech in Minnesota, noted that IBM had laid off 500 workers in Minneapolis and moved their jobs to India and other countries. He said he would impose a 35% tax on imports by companies that move U.S.-based operations outside the country.\nHe reiterated that message on Sunday morning in a series of Twitter messages.\n\"The U.S. is going to substantially reduce taxes and regulations on businesses, but any business that leaves our country for another country, fires its employees, builds a new factory or plant in the other country and then thinks it will sell its product back into the U.S. without retribution or consequence is WRONG!\" he wrote in a series of Twitter messages.\nLast month Ms. Rometty sent Mr. Trump a letter saying her company will support efforts to pass tax reform early in 2017.\n\"Many billions of dollars of American companies' earnings do not come home because of an outdated and punitive tax system,\" she wrote.\nIBM declined to comment beyond Ms. Rometty's letter.\nMs. Rometty hasn't publicly supported candidates of either party, nor has she made any political donations, according to databases maintained by the Federal Election Commission.\nThe advisory group also includes the chief executives of General Motors Co., J.P.

      "text": "Around twenty-one hospitals across China plan to adopt Watson for Oncology through an IBM partnership with Hangzhou Cognitive Care of China. (Representational image) Bengaluru: A forty-page printout was enough for Keerthi (suffering from bilateral breast cancer) to inform herself about the full details of her treatment, after which she left for Delhi. The printout gave her information about the antibody therapy which helped her. Ever since Manipal Hospital adopted IBM Watson for Oncology for individualised and evidence-based cancer care, some 1,300 patients have benefited from the cognitive computing platform.\n\"We did a study post the launch, on a thousand people. Apart from the study, we have also applied the technology on more than two hundred patients. This platform has proved to be helpful for many patients, reducing the standard amount of time which is generally taken,\" said Dr S.P. Somashekar, (Chairman and HoD, surgical oncologist, Manipal Comprehensive Cancer Centre).\n\"With a click of a mouse, the patient gets a full page printout. Healthcare and medical data is generated at a record pace from medical devices, health monitors, patient records as well as medical research. This data can be of immense help in several ways, ranging from large-scale population health management to highly personalized medical decision support,\" Dr Somashekar said.\nAccording to a study by The National Cancer Institute (NCI), every 13th new cancer patient in the world is an Indian. This growing number has made it essential for healthcare experts to integrate technology into treatment.\nGlobally too, IBM Watson for Oncology has been adopted at Bumrungrad International Hospital in Thailand and Gachon University Gil Medical Centre in Korea. Around twenty-one hospitals across China plan to adopt Watson for Oncology through an IBM partnership with Hangzhou Cognitive Care of China.\n\"A team of 12 oncologists from Manipal Hospitals have been trained to use this solution to help the patients with the exact diagnosis and administer treatment accordingly. Watson can understand the case and highlight a list of potential treatments with a percentage rank of certitude. The doctor then reviews the list and makes his decision on the final treatment in consultation with the patient,\" Dr Somashekhar said.",

      "text": "By Rachael King\nInternational Business Machines Corp. CEO Ginni Rometty is one of 16 business leaders who will advise President-elect Donald Trump as members of the President's Strategic and Policy Forum, Mr. Trump said Friday.\nThe group will meet with Mr. Trump to consult as he implements his plan to stem the flow of U.S. jobs to other countries. IBM is one of the technology companies he has criticized for offshoring jobs and manufacturing products abroad.\nMs. Rometty is the only technology CEO to take part.\nMr. Trump's impending presidency has raised concerns among some tech CEOs who rely on manufacturing or inexpensive labor abroad. The president-elect, in a Nov. 6 campaign speech in Minnesota, noted that IBM had laid off 500 workers in Minneapolis and moved their jobs to India and other countries. He said he would impose a 35% tax on imports by companies that move U.S.-based operations outside the country.\nHe reiterated that message on Sunday morning in a series of Twitter messages.\n\"The U.S. is going to substantially reduce taxes and regulations on businesses, but any business that leaves our country for another country, fires its employees, builds a new factory or plant in the other country and then thinks it will sell its product back into the U.S. without retribution or consequence is WRONG!\" he wrote in a series of Twitter messages.\nLast month Ms. Rometty sent Mr. Trump a letter saying her company will support efforts to pass tax reform early in 2017.\n\"Many billions of dollars of American companies' earnings do not come home because of an outdated and punitive tax system,\" she wrote.\nIBM declined to comment beyond Ms. Rometty's letter.\nMs. Rometty hasn't publicly supported candidates of either party, nor has she made any political donations, according to databases maintained by the Federal Election Commission.\nThe advisory group also includes the chief executives of General Motors Co., J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., Wal-Mart Stores Inc., and The Walt Disney Co., and the former chief executive of Boeing Co.\nWrite to Rachael King at rachael.king@wsj.com\n 05, 2016 00:31 ET (05:31 GMT)\n ",

      "text": "Part of a ZDNet Special Feature: How to Implement AI and Machine Learning Should IBM be your AI and machine learning platform? Here's how IBM got its start in artificial intelligence, and what it brings to the table for your business or organization. \nIBM CEO Ginni Rometty and IBM Watson Group Senior VP Mike Rhodin. Image: IBM \nOf all the tech giants throwing their weight behind artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, few receive the kind of attention garnered by IBM. After its seminal Jeopardy win in 2011, IBM Watson became synonymous with technologies such as cognitive computing and AI. \nUpon losing to Watson, former Jeopardy champion Ken Jennings famously wrote \"I, for one, welcome our new computer overlords\" under one of his responses. All of a sudden, Watson was a household name, igniting conversations about what could be accomplished with AI. \nSEE: IBM Watson: The smart person's guide (TechRepublic) \nWhile Watson is a major part of IBM's approach to AI solutions, it's only a piece of the puzzle. Here's a deeper look at the bigger picture, so businesses can determine if IBM is the right AI vendor for their needs. The history Read More \nIBM Research, the company's research division, dates back to 1945, when it opened the Watson Scientific Computing Laboratory at Columbia University. IBM's work in AI began in the 1950s, according to its website . Around that time, an IBM employee named Arthur Samuel wrote a self-learning program for playing checkers, and would later be recognized as a pioneer in AI and machine learning. \nIn the 1970s, IBM built its first robot, and advanced its work in the field in the 1980s with the IBM RS 1 . In the 1990s, IBM Researcher Gerry Tesauro used reinforcement learning (RL) to create a self-learning game of backgammon. Then, in 1997, IBM's Deep Blue computer famously beat World Chess Champion Garry Kasparov at chess. \nThe company's development of actual AI products began more recently. Mike Gualtieri , of Forrester Research, said that IBM's journey toward AI solutions began in 2009, when it acquired two companies: ILOG and SPSS. ILOG is a business rules engine, Gualtieri said, which used to be called an expert system, while SPSS provides advanced analytics. Both of these purchases helped jumpstart IBM's work on AI solutions for businesses. \nToday, IBM's AI initiatives are centered around the Watson platform. IBM has Watson solutions for analytics and machine learning, data search and discovery, and conversation tools like chat bots. The vision \nIBM views AI as \"augmented intelligence,\" said Guru Banavar , vice president and chief science officer for cognitive computing at IBM Research. To take that concept a little further, 451 Research analyst Nick Patience explained augmented intelligence as \"AI -- and machine learning in particular -- acting as a force multiplier for humans.\" \nCurrently, Banavar said, there are \"thousands\" of engineers working on the Watson platform. On a high level, the team is split into two very distinctive camps. One on end of the spectrum is a group working on \"very concrete, commercial development and deployment,\" which happens usually on a weekly, monthly, or quarterly basis. \n\"Then, at the other end of the spectrum, we have teams of people that are working on advanced new technologies -- some of which are being invented -- all the way up to mathematicians who are developing the underlying techniques for them,\" Banavar said. \nAfter Watson won Jeopardy, Banavar said the team at IBM was focused on building custom systems for specific clients or industry niches. However, they recently had to make a conscious strategic decision to move away from that model to focus on APIs. \nBanavar said that IBM realized it wouldn't be possible to build out all of the applications they wanted to with their existing strategy. So, they turned some of their capabilities into a platform with open APIs, \"in order to attract and nurture a larger ecosystem of developers that can build many applications that IBM cannot build by ourselves,\" Banavar said. \nThose APIs are being put to use in areas like retail, finance, law, and even fantasy football. But healthcare is one of the primary focuses for Watson solutions. \n\"I could see a vision where every hospital, every clinical group, had this Watson service. It becomes as essential as an X-ray, as essential as an MRI,\" Gualtieri said. \"So, I think that's their vision. They're putting a lot against that.\" Strengths \nTo understand whether or not IBM would be a good fit for your organization, you must weigh your company's needs against IBM's strengths. On the technical side of things, Banavar said, these strengths start with Watson's language capabilities. \n\"Watson has image processing capabilities, speech processing capabilities, regular numerical data analytics capabilities across the board -- we have the entire spectrum,\" Banavar said. \"But, if you ask me what is a really unique, and probably the most advanced, capability in Watson, it is language processing.\" \nWhen it comes to business, IBM's AI strength comes from three key elements: IBM Research, its acquisition prowess, and its consultants. \nIBM Research may not always produce a breakthrough, but it does give the company a distinctive edge, said Gualtieri. \"The advantage of that is that the largest companies in the world -- who IBM wants to sell to -- want that edge,\" he added. \nSEE: IT leader's guide to the future of artificial intelligence (Tech Pro Research) \nThe ability to acquire the right companies to broaden its portfolio of offerings is a key differentiator for IBM. Banavar noted that the company has also been leveraging open-source libraries and toolkits to make use of new techniques in neural networking, word embedding, and more. \nIn addition to its research prowess and acquisition budget, IBM has a large network of consultants. According to Patience, that is key, \"because a lot of the early machine learning opportunities involve taking enabling technologies such as machine learning algorithms and turning them into enhanced business processes and applications; something IBM understands well.\" Challenges \nOne of the biggest challenges facing IBM is managing the expectations that come from terms like cognitive computing and AI. This is further compounded by the public-facing nature of Watson, especially in the wake of its Jeopardy win, and confusion around the capabilities of AI as well. \n\"Everyone thinks that we're on the verge of Star Trek , like next week,\" Gualtieri said. So, IBM must have a grand and transformative vision about the future of AI, but they also have to keep the expectations in check so customers don't regret moving forward, Gualtieri noted. \nOn the question of safety and ethics, many would share Gualtieri's view that the technology \"is not even close to getting to the point where ethical issues are really a serious concern.\" However, Banavar said that ethical challenges are still something the IBM team must consider. \nThe first crucial issue that must be addressed, Banavar said, is the idea of explainability. If a doctor or financial advisor uses Watson to make a decision, for example, they must be able to understand why Watson chose a particular solution or set of options. \nThe other ethical consideration is bias . With machine learning systems, the models are built with training data -- but the data has to faithfully represent what you're trying to model, or it could be biased, Banavar said. Because of that, selecting the proper training data set is an ethical decision of the utmost importance. This is made even more important by how broad a potential impact Banavar sees for AI technologies. \n\"At the end of the day, I do think that cognitive computing is necessary for us to solve the world's big problems,\" Banavar said.

      "text": "Microsoft, Intel, and IBM are three of the most vocal companies that opposed China’s plans to access proprietary source code of software and technology products in order to make sure that they’re hackerproof or do not include backdoors. In particular, Microsoft explains that providing access to source code contradicts the idea of boosting security, with the other tech companies also adding that such a thing would only expose their products to rivals or cybercriminals. “Sharing source code in itself can’t prove the capability to be secure and controllable. It only proves there is source code,” Microsoft said in comments submitted to the Technical Committee 260, which is the national cybersecurity standards body that’s pushing new laws requiring companies to share their source codes. Intel, in its turn, explains that providing access to proprietary source code “would hurt technological innovation and decrease the security level of products,” according to",

      "text": "Can computers help doctors reduce diagnostic errors?   Todd Shryock If an advanced computer like IBM’s Watson can go on Jeopardy and win, can a computer start diagnosing patients better than a human doctor? The possibility could mean a reduction in a diagnostic error rate that the Institute of Medicine estimates may be as high as 15%. The concept of how computers would fare against humans in diagnosing patients was the genesis of a recent research study from the American Medical Association that compared the accuracy of common online symptom checkers available on sites like WebMD to doctors. “Our thought was, if there is such a high level of inaccuracy, can computers do better?” says Ateev Mehrotra, MD, MPH, senior author of the study. Further reading: Should your practice have a blog? The research revealed two things: doctors easily outperformed the machines , getting the correct diagnosis 72% of the time compared to 34% for the online symptom checkers, and that the diagnostic error rate for doctors was high. “The doctors outperformed the symptom checkers; I expected that. By what magnitude was the only question,” says Mehrotra, who is also an associate professor at Harvard Medical School. But he was also surprised by the misdiagnosis rate for doctors, who missed the best diagnosis 28% of the time. The online symptom checkers did far worse, but are they the best measure of what computers are capable of? True artificial intelligence The next step in computer-assisted diagnostics is harnessing the power of artificial intelligence (AI). Online symptom checkers are based on traditional computer programs and don’t utilize AI, which can greatly boost performance. Artificial intelligence differs from traditional computer software, which use data and a program to create an output, while AI uses data and outputs to create the program. To differentiate the two, consider the question, “How many cats are sold in Pittsburgh?” Blog: Staying connected to patients beyond the office visit A traditional program would query a database of cat sales to return an answer. An AI-powered program might approximate how many cats are sold in Pittsburgh based on the number of cat food packages sold, says Ervin Sejdic, Ph.D., assistant professor at the University of Pittsburgh, who has worked on AI in healthcare for the last eight years. Whether AI is ready to compete with human doctors on something as complex as a diagnosis is up for debate. “I’m 100% certain that AI can do better than a doctor,” says Akli Adjaoute, Ph.D., CEO of Brighterion, a technology company specializing in artificial intelligence and machine learning.",

      "text": "Mahindra, IBM to develop blockchain based supply chain applications Published: December 05, 2016 Share International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) in collaboration with the Mahindra Group will develop blockchain-based supply chain applications, which the companies claim has the potential to reinvent supply chain finance across India by enhancing security, transparency and operational processes. This cloud-based application, one of the first projects of its kind in India outside of traditional banking, is designed to transform supplier-to-manufacturer trade finance transactions, Mahindra said in a statement. The partnership will see the two firms working on a prototype tool for tracking supply chain transactions via blockchain. “This proof of concept represents a significant step forward in making blockchain, still a new technology, a more compelling and efficient supply chain solution for Mahindra Finance’s small and mid-sized enterprises loans business. Working with IBM, we will work to build, test, scale and refine this solution over time,” said Anish Shah, group president (strategy), Mahindra Group. The blockchain-based supply chain finance solution will enable all parties involved in the transaction to act on the same shared ledger, with each party updating only its part of the process, ensuring efficiency, consistency, trust and transparency, while safeguarding sensitive information. The collaboration comes as India’s business and finance sectors continue exploring the technology. Various banks in the country have been testing blockchain for use in cross-border payments and transaction settlement. Other firms, including IT consultancy services of Tata, have pursued various proofs-of-concept, while startups working in the bitcoin space have continued to develop products. Mahindra group has been testing blockchain internally as part of a broader push to investigate new technologies.",

      "text": "DUBLIN- Research and Markets has announced the addition of the \"Global In-memory OLAP Database Market 2016-2020\" report to their offering.\nThe global in-memory OLAP database market to grow at a CAGR of 24.95% during the period 2016-2020.\nGlobal In-Memory OLAP Database Market 2016-2020, has been prepared based on an in-depth market analysis with inputs from industry experts. The report covers the market landscape and its growth prospects over the coming years. The report also includes a discussion of the key vendors operating in this market.\nThe in-memory database is one of the subcomponents of IMDM, the other subcomponent being in-memory data grid (IMDG). IMDM and in-memory application platform (IMAP) are the components of in-memory computing (IMC), which form the base of this technology. The primary purpose of in-memory processing technology is to enable real-time analyses and allow organizations to store data in RAM rather than in traditional disk storages, which reduces their operational costs.\nIncreasing demand for memory devices will be a key trend for market growth. The availability of in-memory processing with the help of online analytical processing (OLAP) tool at a lower price when compared with other BI tools, has increased the demand for this technology. As it can be easily deployed and maintained, the adoption of in-memory technology has progressed over traditional BI among data warehouse vendors.\nWith the demand for the in-memory database, new providers of this technology are entering the market with features that can have an advantage over their competitors. For example, after SAP and Oracle, IBM and Microsoft have built in-memory technology into DB2 and SQL Server. With organizations preferring to store a large amount of data in the memory for faster computing, the demand for in-memory databases have increased.\nKey vendors\nAltibase IBM Microsoft Oracle SAP SE Other prominent vendors\nExasol Jedox AG Kognitio Mcobject MemSQL MicroStrategy SAS Institute Teradata Terracotta VoltDB Key Topics Covered:\nPart 01: Executive summary\nPart 02: Scope of the report\nPart 03: Market research methodology\nPart 04: Introduction\nPart 05: Market landscape\nPart 06: Market segmentation by application\nPart 07: Geographical segmentation\nPart 08: Market drivers\nPart 09: Impact of drivers\nPart 10: Market challenges\nPart 11: Impact of drivers and challenges\nPart 12: Market trends\nPart 13: Five forces model\nPart 14: Vendor landscape\nPart 15: Vendor matrix\nPart 16: Key vendor analysis\nPart 17: Appendix\nFor more information about this report visit http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/jlk82b/global_inmemory\nContacts Research and Markets\nLaura Wood, Senior Manager\npress@researchandmarkets.com\nFor E.S.T Office Hours Call 1-917-300-0470\nFor U.S./CAN Toll Free Call 1-800-526-8630\nFor GMT Office Hours Call +353-1-416-8900\nU.S. Fax: 646-607-1907\nFax (outside U.S.): +353-1-481-1716\nRelated Topics: Data Storage and Management",

      "text": "Amazon's splashy video for Amazon Go — an all-seeing, all-knowing store where customers can grab items, toss 'em in a bag or pocket and just walk out without ever waiting in line — has obvious appeal. So obvious, in fact, that another tech company proposed the exact same concept more than 10 years ago.\nSEE ALSO: Amazon's new app will 'see' inside your packages\nAn IBM ad showcasing a smart store got major circulation on the airwaves in 2006 (when YouTube was nascent). It features a nefarious-looking character in a trench coat wandering the aisles of a supermarket, stuffing his pockets with items as other patrons and security guards shoot him looks of suspicion. As he exits the store through what looks like a security gate that \"flashes\" him, the guard calls out, \"Excuse me, sir!\"\nThe man stops and turns. The guard grabs a piece of paper dispensed from the gate: \"You forgot your receipt.\"\nThe ad is more than a decade old, so it likely wasn't predicting the same technologies that make Amazon Go possible, those being AI, machine learning and computer vision, mainly. Instead IBM was showing \"future store\" vision powered by RFID, a tech in widespread use today. An IBM white paper from March 2009 discusses, among other things, how RFID readers positioned throughout a store could detect movements of products within it.\nRFID is used in retail, but its presence is all but invisible to the customer, and most stores today still have a traditional checkout. We'll see in 2017 if the new technologies that power Amazon Go can finally bring IBM's vision of a \"smart store\" to reality.",

      "text": "By James Kobielus , IBM. Join industry experts for a live crowdchat on December 8 at 1:00pm EST: #MakeDataSimple As we move into the new year, here are my core predictions for the data science community: Data scientists will have the survival of their companies riding on their success : In 2017, more enterprises will task data science teams with building their most strategic do-or-die applications. By the end of the coming year, every CEO who hopes to keep their job will boast of at least one strategic data science-driven application--incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) , machine learning, and cognitive computing—upon which their firm’s survival, profitability, or future relevance will depend. Data scientists will command the coolest R&D projects in every industry : In 2017, data scientists will be the prime movers behind the most attention-grabbing, prestigious R&D in business, industry and the consumer world—most notably, those projects focusing on streaming media analytics , embedded deep learning , cognitive IoT , cognitive chatbots , embodied robotic cognition , autonomous vehicles , computer vision , and autocaptioning . A year from now, no R&D project in the business world will be funded if it doesn’t include a substantial amount of data science. Data scientists will drive enterprise business process management : In 2017, more data scientists will add business process management to their core operational responsibilities . Their primary focus within BPM teams will be as the designers and managers of the predictive analytics, machine learning, and stream-computing algorithms that drive 24x7 real-world experiments and A/B testing within all business processes, both customer-facing and internal. As 2017 rolls into 2018, every BPM team in the e-commerce world will include at least one data scientist who is tasked with continual monitoring and tweaking of a never-ending stream of incremental process changes. Data scientists will radically shift their development organizations toward open ecosystems : In 2017, data scientists’ open-source tools and platforms will become the foundation of all enterprise application development. During the year, data scientists will adopt integrated, open, cloud-based development environments . These will, at the very least, incorporate R , Spark , and Hadoop;provide access to a wide range of off-the-shelf and pluggable algorithm libraries; enable API-driven development of composable containerized microservices ; automate more machine-learning development pipeline functions; present a notebook-oriented collaboration and sharing paradigm; maintain auditable project logs for algorithmic transparency , and enforce robust tracking and governance of data, models, and other development artifacts. Within increasingly federated data-science development teams, more training data curation will be sourced from open crowdsourcing environments and more fresh data-science talent will come from open communities such as Kaggle and TopCoder . As 2017 fades away and the end of the decade comes into clearer focus, lone-wolf disconnected data scientists will find their careers dead-ended and productivity flatlining unless they plug into increasingly open, federated development ecosystems. The data science skills gap will diminish rapidly : In 2017, more traditional programmers and business analysts of all types will enter the data-science field. They’ll do so in recognition of the fact that acquiring data science skills and repositioning their careers in this direction is absolutely essential for them to remain relevant, effective, and employable. These non-traditional and new data scientists will only be allowed to participate in mainstream enterprise data-science programs after a clear “apprenticeship” or “probationary” period of supervision by established data scientist. By the end of 2017, the developers and analysts who make this transition to full-fledged data scientists effectively will find their coding skills and domain expertise in hot demand in businesses around the world. b// Want to share your predictions for big data, analytics, cloud data services, data science, and cognitive computing in 2017?

      "text": "Summary \nOnce an iconic company is now on a thorny way of restructuring its business - with limited success. \nHigh degree of uncertainty on the company's future competitiveness and declining financial metrics does not let us to recommend it as a suitable buy for stable income-seeking investors. \nThe dividend yield is only moderate and does not compensate for the risks mentioned. Once an iconic company, International Business Machines (NYSE: IBM ) is now on a thorny way of restructuring its business - with limited success. Key reasons that don't let us recommend it as a suitable buy for a stable income-seeking investor are: High degree of uncertainty on the company's future competitiveness; financial metrics have been declining for the last several years; stock price volatility is relatively high; and the dividend yield is only moderate and does not compensate for the above. As most of the hi-tech companies, IBM is currently suffering from stagnation on its traditional markets of on-premises hardware and thick-client software. Although the company is profitable, it has been demonstrating negative dynamics recently. Income from continuous operations before taxes has been declining steadily - from $15.8bn in 2014, it fell to $13.4bn in 2015. For 9m2016 the decline continued, and the metric amounted just $7.3bn - 32% down YoY. A key reason for declining profitability is decreasing revenue, and it has been falling since 2013. Total sales exhibited the most significant drop in 2015. For nine months, they were down by 13.1% due to the divestiture of x86 server business to Lenovo ( OTCPK:LNVGY ) that led to a 4% decline. This drop was boosted by US dollar appreciation to emerging countries' currencies which resulted in another 8% loss of sales. IBM is affected by the shocks in developing markets because less than 44% of sales are from the stable Americas markets, and revenues from the BRIC countries dropped by 29%. In 2016, no significant volatility on currency markets was present, but for 9m2016, IBM's total revenue showed a further reduction of 2.6%. The company sees its future in services with higher added value. IBM calls its key targets - cloud services, Software-as-a-Service (SAAS), Internet-of-Things - \"strategic imperatives\", and in 2015, the management set an objective to receive 40% of total revenue and sales amounting $40bn from these product lines by 2018. IBM was indeed trying to restructure its business lines, but didn't succeed yet. It is even more surprising given the fact that IBM was one of the largest IT vendors in the world and possessed a significant advantage. It is always easier to switch your existing customers to a new form of product (e.g. cloud server infrastructure vs. the on-site one) than to attract new clients. We cannot say the revenue from new services is not growing at all. In fact, it is, and even in double digits. For instance, in 9m2016, \"strategic imperatives\" revenue increased by 15% and cloud computing revenue increased by an impressive 64% (YoY), but they are still quite small as a share of total revenues. Moreover, a decline in legacy solutions revenue base drives profitability back. Now the situation is that IBM has lost the majority of its positions as a vendor of highly reliable hardware (e.g. it has only 14.1% market share in server equipment) and hasn't obtained a significant share in cloud services and related products it is so striving to succeed in. We see two main reasons for this. The first is that while pursuing short-term objectives of efficiency improvement, IBM fell into the trap of \"cost cutting at any cost\". This led to questionable decisions on laying off skilled workforce in the US and moving labor to countries with a lower cost which deprived the company of its ability to solve complex problems for clients. Management incentives tied up to earnings per share encouraged such short-term approach. Negative publicity related to the dismissal of staff in the US also harms the company's ability to compete for employees in a highly competitive market. Another reason for the currently poor situation is that such a massive product line shift requires vast research, development, and engineering expense. In 9m2016, this cost already amounted $4.3bn (16% of gross profit). The other means for business expansion is extensive acquisition activity. Both these actions require substantial investments, but IBM is already highly leveraged, and its borrowing capacity is therefore constrained. The company's \"Net Debt/EBITDA\" ratio exceeded 4.0x for 9m2016 with some decline from 4.3x YoY. IBM is still highly rated (e.g. \"Aa3\" by Moody's), but the rating outlook has been made negative in 2016. Rating agencies' concerns are also mostly related to risks of product line change - whether the company will be able to achieve this goal. High payout ratio (53% in 9m2016) is offset by the current level of stock prices. IBM's shares are currently about to break through the 52-week high. The dividend yield is constrained by this fact although it's above average (3.4%). From a portfolio perspective, it should be noted that IBM can hardly bring any diversification benefit. It is highly correlated with the market having the beta of 0.86. Even though in the last 12 months, the stock price grew by 18%, outperforming the S&P 500 index by far (increased by 6% only), IBM's shares are much more volatile with the maximum drawdown in 2016; -27% compared to -16% for S&P 500.

      "text": "Tweet LAKE WALES, Fla. — IBM will demonstrate heat-maps of nanoscale devices at the IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting 2016 (IEDM, December 3-7) using a new method made more accurate for the nanoscale age of sub-14 nanometer transistors. By first measuring the thermal resistance of the point, then the heat flux, it can more accurately generate heat maps of tiny devices like transistors and memory cells. \nMeasuring the temperature of hot spots for newly designed sub-14 nanometer transistors and memories was very difficult until now, according to researcher Bernd Gotsmann at the IBM Lab in Zurich. Hotspot Illustration of one of the teams experiments with a VO2 phase-change resistor on a TiO2 substrate with Au/Cr contacts, showing self-heating around current filaments. (Source: IBM) \n\"The problem is similar to the difference between touching wood and metal with your hand,\" Gotsmann told EE Times in an exclusive interview. \"They can be the same temperature, but will feel different temperatures because of their different thermal resistance.\" \nTo solve that problem, IBM outfits the tip of an atomic force microscope with both a heat injector and a scanning probe thermometer to measure heat flux. \nFirst a known temperature in injected into the device — say a transistor that is turned offthen its returned heat flux is measured by the probe's thermometer. This step discerns the material's thermal resistance, analogous to whether its temperature feels like wood or metal. \nIn the second step, the device-under-test is turned on and the probe's thermometer measures its active thermal flux compensating for its thermal resistance, thus more accurately measuring the temperature of devices — especially at the sub-14 nanometers scale of today' advanced devices. \nBy repeating the process while the AFM scans across the device'e surface a heat map can readily identify hot-spots, which can then be remedied by redesigning its details and trying again. The group is developing sub-nanometer resolution for the heat maps of sub-14 nanometer transistors and other devices like memory cells and hopes to license the technology to semiconductor designers. And entire device heat map can be generated in about two minutes, according to IBM. \nIBM is personally using the technique to characterize heat maps for its sub-10 nanometer transistors and memory devices. \n— R.

      "text": "How IBM's Watson will change cybersecurity Should Linux Mint be discontinued? \nLinux Mint has been quite popular with many users for a very long time. But changes to Linux Mint in recent years have one redditor wondering exactly what the point of using it is these days. Distributions like Fedora, Ubuntu and others have also stolen some of Linux Mint's thunder with notable improvements and popular spins. \nShould Linux Mint be discontinued or is it still worth keeping around? [ InfoWorld celebrates Linux at 25: A pictorial history . | How Linux changed the world . | Linus Torvalds on the evolution and future of Linux . | Containers and unikernels prove less is more . | Quick guide to Linux admin essentials . | Stay up on open source with the InfoWorld Linux report . ] \nPointiestStick started the thread with these comments: \nIt seems to me that the Linux Mint people have a really good thing going with Cinnamon, which is rapidly becoming the GNOME 2.0 replacement. But Linux Mint as a distro is nothing to write home about. I used Mint for several years and found the overall experience to be frustrating. \nBeing based on LTS Ubuntu releases meant waiting ages for hardware support or updated packages. There was no good way to upgrade from one major version to another. PPAs and repos would randomly break, especially after updates. \nI'm using Fedora these days and I have none of these problems. Having media codecs pre-installed was always nice but that's not even true anymore. So what's the point? Most of the things people like about Linux Mint are actually part of a desktop environment or could be (e.g. mintupdate, mintdrivers). \nWhy don't the Linux Mint guys focus all their energy on Cinnamon and supported apps? As a desktop environment, Cinnamon is awesome. But as a distro, Linux Mint seems like a dead end to me, especially as the Ubuntu and GNOME/GTK folks move in divergent directions and lose interest in supporting downstream derivatives. \nMore at Reddit \nHis fellow Linux redditors responded with their thoughts: \nPassionate_coder : “The reason why Mint initially grew in popularity is because a lot of Ubuntu users (including me) were tired of Canonical making undesirable changes to Ubuntu. They seemed out of touch with their user base, and this gave way to Linux Mint. \nI like Mint because I like the developers. They regularly seek feedback from users, develop new features fairly quickly, answer questions on every blog post, respond to bug reports, and haven't forced any features which the community doesn't want. \nI agree that Mint isn't perfect, but I'm happy to stick with the community because I like the developers more than Canonical.” \nYdna_eissua : “Mint also now has some pretty hefty competition from Ubuntu flavours like Ubuntu Mate. Which gives you a polished traditional desktop experience without tying you to the Mint release schedule.” \nCbmuser : “The Canonical and Debian developers actually do all the work. If it wasn't for us, Linux Mint wouldn't exist in the first place. \nThe real work is done in Debian and Ubuntu, like improving the base infrastructure and the toolchain.” \nShimiC : “I don't think that's entirely fair. By the same logic, your upstream projects (GNU, Linux, X11, systemd, GTK, KDE...) do \"all the work\", and if wasn't for them, there wouldn't be a Debian or an Ubuntu to exist in the first place.” \nSillyvictorians : “I'd say the reason for Mint's popularity predates Shuttleworth's \"different for difference's sake\" take on things, which did also happen around when GNOME 2.32 was deprecated in favor of 3. \nMint worked for people who wanted to use Linux but wanted a friendlier and more familiar experience but didn't want to get very deep into free vs non-free issues, like drivers and multimedia. Why couldn't things just be ready to run right out of the box, consarnit? \nLicensing was (and still is) a very big issue, and Ubuntu's primary goal was an operating system that would be usable worldwide and wholly free from restrictive or licensed code. How else could you create \"ubuntu\" if your free OS was not legal for trade in every country? \nThis meant if you wanted to play non-free media like DVDs (it was the early 2000s), you had to manually enable libdvdcss and agree to use of a \"restricted codec\". MP3s were the same way and required users to enable extra repositories before they could install gstreamer-bad/ugly to get all of the popular but non-free codecs. \nThen Mint rolled up and said, \"Hey, we include all of that handy non-free stuff by default and also provide separate No Codec images.\" And lo, everyone who wanted to use Linux but couldn't get past not being able to use Youtube (Flash isn't free) or other stuff they could do on Windows or Mac easily tried it, and they found that it was good and stayed with it. \nIt wasn't for a few more years that the Canonical and GNOME Foundation shenanigans happened, and Mint putting out Cinnamon and Mate after that certainly solidified their popularity, but I think that Ubuntu was just a little too free (in more than one way) for many early users to wrap their heads around. Mint won share for its convenience, and Ubuntu's original message and mission were more or less lost to time, and perhaps a little megalomania, for the detriment of FOSS.” \nEspero : “Evetything works out of the box \nI install it and get on with my life, and most importanly get back to being productive. My OS tweaking days are way past me, it is not something I want to waste time doing. \nAlso, even my mum can use it. There has been no support requests at all, and it's been 3 years now!” \nn30p1r4t3 : “I just don't think Linux Mint is meant for you (based on your issues with it). Linux Mint to me is a set and forget distribution, which I have no problem using for machines that just need to work (I.e. my grandparents).” \nDrDoctor13 : “Mint is working towards becoming self-sufficient. With the x-apps and Cinnamon, they don't have to rely on constantly changing technologies anymore. \nPeople in this thread already said Mint works out of the box and that the developers are very connected with the community, which is true and I couldn't ask for a better dev team running the show at Mint, but I like Mint because it's no-nonsense. Ubuntu already had a working software updater, I don't see why they have to use GNOME Software to handle updates. In every VM and old computer I've tested Ubuntu 16.04 on, Software always crashes when updating. I don't have this problem with Mint. The updater is verbose, detailed, and gives me an idea of how severe the update is. Mint's software installer is fantastic, too. GDebi for handling .debs, and mintinstall for browsing the repos. Both work fantastic and are much snappier than Software. \nNot to mention other utilities that make most tasks a breeze. Adding PPAs? There's GUI for that. Tasks that may seem daunting because they're usually done by CLI have GUI interfaces provided by Mint. People look at Mint as the next big thing, and as much as I wish it was, it isn't. It's a stable, robust distro that knows exactly what it wants to be and doesn't shove in features no one wants. I used it in my first time starting out on Linux, I recommend it to Linux newcomers, and I even install it on servers that need to be stable/frozen for long periods of time. It perfectly balances the \"noob-friendly\" concept while allowing power users to still have their fun.” \nPointiestStick : “Wow, this blew up overnight. I appreciate everyone's views! \nI agree that the Mint folks' strongest asset is their focus on the community, and I applaud them for it. I remember talking to Clem in comment threads and that was a really rewarding experience. \nClem is a diplomatic fellow but if you read between the lines, a lot of his posts are about working around deficiencies in Ubuntu or GNOME. The point of an upstream package base is to inherit their work so you don't have to do that stuff yourself. When your upstream becomes unreliable for this purpose and you wind up having to re-do the work anyway, what's the point? \nThe only reason for Linux Mint's stability is because it has really old upstream packages. Part of this is inherited from Ubuntu and Debian's release cycles, and part of it is because they need to evaluate, patch, and replace a whole lot of upstream work. \nThere is also an extreme anti-upgrade mentality that is at odds with their equally extreme innovation. They push the envelope and then discourage most of their users from taking advantage of it simply because being based on Ubuntu means that upgrades are a risky and dangerous affair. Upgrades in Linux mint are just terrible. Something always irreparably broke every time I upgraded from one major version to another (e.g. 15 -> 16, 16 -> 17). I wound up doing clean installs which got really tiresome and jarring given the focus on user-friendliness. User-friendliness includes having a sane upgrade path! It's why their current approach seems to be to incrementally iterate off a stable base, which allows safe in-place package upgrades. But that stable base gets older and older over time. 18.1 still ships with the 4.4 kernel. If I tried to install that on my laptop, I would be fiddling with drivers for ages. In Fedora, everything worked out of the box. \nI keep wondering if one day The Linux Mint folks are going to re-focus everything on the LMDE version. That way they would be Debian-based, not Ubuntu-based, and they could be decoupled from the upstream Canonical and GNOME shenanigans. They could do the work they want without having to patch or replace anything and have a saner upgrade path.” \nMore at Reddit DistroWatch reviews Fedora 25 \nFedora 25 has been out for a little while now, and reviews have begun to appear on various Linux sites. DistroWatch has a new review of Fedora 25 this week, and was mostly pleased with it. \nJoshua Allen Holm reports for DistroWatch: \nI will be honest, Fedora 25 is a very boring release. Everything is newer, but there are not a lot of new features. The biggest change is the switch to Wayland as the default display server (which I cover in more detail below), but just about everything else is just a version number bump. GNOME is now version 3.22. Firefox 49 is what came on the ISO, but the update to Firefox 50 is already available. Evolution, also version 3.22, serves as the default e-mail client. LibreOffice 5.2 rounds out the major software included by default. \nThe most significant change in Fedora 25 is the use of Wayland as the default display server. This change has been long promised, but the implementation has been frequently pushed back. Fedora 25 now defaults to using Wayland and, while perfectly usable, it is not perfect. After using Fedora daily since release, I have yet to find any issues that completely disrupt my work-flow, or make doing something important impossible, but there are a handful of issues that I ran across all the time. \nOther things that I have noticed are the fact that Files displays an extra blank line at the bottom of its right-click context menu that does not appear under Xorg and that LibreOffice messes up when returning from full screen mode. Under Xorg, when LibreOffice exits full screen mode, it properly restores to the size it was before, but under Wayland it reduces to a small window and, while this small window can be resized, it will no longer correctly maximize to use the full screen; it leaves a small gap on the right side of the screen. \nWhat is really nice about Fedora 25 is just how many programming languages are well supported by the distribution with up-to-date releases. I was able to easily set up support for C, C++, D, Java, Node.js, Python, Perl, R, Ruby, and Rust, with Rust being a new addition in Fedora 25. While I was certainly excited to see Rust packages included, I was disappointed that GnuCOBOL does not seem to be packaged for Fedora anymore. \nEven when dealing with the various Wayland oddities and issues, Fedora 25 is a great distribution. Everything is reasonably polished and the default software provides a functional desktop for those looking for a basic web browsing, e-mail, and word processing environment. The additional packages available can easily turn Fedora into an excellent development workstation customized for a developer's specific needs. If you are programming in most of the current major programming languages, Fedora provides you the tools to easily do so. Overall, I am very pleased using Fedora 25, but I am even more excited for future releases of Fedora as the various minor Wayland issues get cleaned up. \nMore at DistroWatch 8 Linux gifts for Christmas \nChristmas is not far away now, and many people are thinking about gifts for their friends and family.

      "text": "3 ways IoT will change smart meters for utilities December 1, 2016 | Written by: Matt Bellias \nCategorized: Energy and Utilities \nThe concept of a smart grid, and the smart meters that are used to measure it, predated the Internet of Things. If we think about IoT as simply the networking of physical devices to allow them to exchange data, then energy & utilities companies building smart grids could be considered leaders of the early IoT movement. \nBut I’d argue that the IoT hasn’t fully delivered value in the utilities industry yet. Most smart grid and meter projects have focused on the meter-to-cash process (M2C). To summarize, this process is the utility industry’s version of a standard order-to-cash process, and includes reading and collecting meter data, analyzing meter data, and then billing and collecting from customers based on this information. \nMany utility companies have already optimized these processes as prior to growing interest and investments in IoT. So how do we see IoT impacting utilities companies and their smart meter initiatives moving forward? Here are three possible ways: Smart meters will reduce consumption \nMost smart meter initiatives have centered around capturing operational savings first, and are now moving into providing customers with data and transparency on energy consumption. This by itself should reduce consumption, but we predict that combining smart meters with IoT innovations in the home will magnify energy efficiency. For example, smart thermostats are becoming ubiquitous but there is no consistent IoT platform for connecting these devices with smart meters. \nCan you imagine if your Nest thermostat could make heating decisions based on fluctuating energy costs? Cognitive systems such as Watson, when combined with open IoT platforms to capture data, could revolutionize how consumers consume energy. An added benefit – this could help stabilize grids for peak use and provide more reliable service. Smart meters will enable renewable energy and micro-grids \nCustomer demand for renewable energy is strong, as evidenced by rapid growth and innovation in solar rooftop technology and adoption. However, most experts believe that grid-scale solar or wind energy projects are more efficient than renewal projects undertaken by consumers. \nSmart meters, feeding into smart grids, will allow utilities companies to better manage bi-directional power flows into and out of their grids, and give customers the insights needed to understand their own energy infrastructure investments. But more importantly, smart grids will enable larger-scale renewable projects led by utilities companies. \nBut managing this data is difficult, especially when utilities try to provide customers with individual grid management. This is where cognitive solutions can help enable smart grids. Cognitive solutions can help make better decisions by understanding grid conditions in real-time via the IoT, and then can give each client the mass customization they’re looking for to drive renewal adoption, however the client wishes. Edge analytics will make meters truly smart \nEarlier this year IBM and Cisco announced a partnership on edge analytics and while this has clear applications for utilities companies managing complex and geographically distributed infrastructure, edge analytics might also help increase the intelligence of smart meters. \nMost homes have wifi connectivity but this isn’t accessible to utilities companies. By using edge analytics to embed cognitive capabilities into meters, their power and usefulness could increase tremendously. This clearly requires infrastructure investments by utilities around connectivity, but this could be more cost-effective than upgrading physical infrastructure and would also provide substantial operational savings (ex: field service management savings) in addition to a unique and personalized customer experience. \nTake a look at other ways the IoT is impacting energy .

      "text": "A Closer Look at IBM’s Growth-Chasing Strategy PART 14 OF 14 Understanding IBM’s Value Proposition in the US Software Space By Anne Shields | Nov 29, 2016 2:07 pm EST IBM’s scale in the systems software space \nIn this series, we’ve had a look at IBM’s ( IBM ) acquisitions, partnerships, and segment-by-segment performances in 3Q16. Despite 3Q16 being the company’s 18th consecutive quarter with no revenue growth, IBM’s Strategic Imperatives segment continued to post growth in 3Q16, indicating the success of the company’s initiatives and strategy. \nIBM has continued its strategy of acquisitions and partnerships to chase growth. Now let’s look at the company’s value proposition among select US software companies. Let’s start with IBM’s size. \nAs of November 25, 2016, Microsoft ( MSFT ) continues to be the largest software player in the world by market capitalization. It’s followed by Oracle ( ORCL ) and IBM. SAP ( SAP ) is also a leading player in this space. Enterprise value multiples \nNow let’s look at IBM’s EV-to-EBITDA (enterprise value to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization) multiple. We’ll also look at the multiples of other US software players. \nIBM was trading at a forward EV-to-EBITDA multiple of ~9.13x on November 25, 2016. This metric was lower than Microsoft’s and Oracle’s multiples of ~10.39x and ~8.4x, respectively. The metric for SAP was 12.87x. Dividend yields \nIBM’s forward annual dividend yield was ~3.4% on November 25, 2016. This was higher than Microsoft’s and Oracle’s forward dividend yields of ~2.6% and ~1.5%, respectively, on November 25, 2016. SAP’s forward yield was 1.5% as of the same date. \nIf you’re interested in gaining exposure to IBM, you can consider investing in the SPDR S&P 500 ETF ( SPY ), which has 8.7% exposure to the application software space and invests ~0.70% of its holdings in IBM. {\"metrics\":[\"Open\"],\"tickers\":[\"IBM\",\"SPY\",\"ORCL\",\"MSFT\",\"SAP\"],\"ticker_names\":[\"International Business Machines Corp.\",\"SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust\",\"Oracle Corporation\",\"Microsoft Corporation\",null]} X",

The demand for IT in the private and public sectors, and optimistic economic scenario and huge support from government have encouraged many businesses to invest in IT.

      "text": "Shutterstock photo\nBy Rachael King\nInternational Business Machines Corp. CEO Ginni Rometty is one of 16 business leaders who will advise President- elect Donald Trump as members of the President's Strategic and Policy Forum, Mr. Trump said Friday.\nThe group will meet with Mr. Trump to consult as he implements his plan to stem the flow of U.S. jobs to other countries. IBM is one of the technology companies he has criticized for offshoring jobs and manufacturing products abroad.\nMr. Trump's impending presidency has raised concerns among some tech CEOs who rely on manufacturing or inexpensive labor abroad. The president-elect, in a Nov. 6 campaign speech in Minnesota, noted that IBM had laid off 500 workers in Minneapolis and moved their jobs to India and other countries. He said he would impose a 35% tax on imports by companies that move U.S.-based operations outside the country.\nHe reiterated that message on Sunday morning in a series of Twitter messages.\n\"The U.S. is going to substantially reduce taxes and regulations on businesses, but any business that leaves our country for another country, fires its employees, builds a new factory or plant in the other country and then thinks it will sell its product back into the U.S. without retribution or consequence is WRONG!\" he wrote in a series of Twitter messages.\nLast month Ms. Rometty sent Mr. Trump a letter saying her company will support efforts to pass tax reform early in 2017.\n\"Many billions of dollars of American companies' earnings do not come home because of an outdated and punitive tax system,\" she wrote.\nIBM declined to comment beyond Ms. Rometty's letter.\nMs. Rometty hasn't publicly supported candidates of either party, nor has she made any political donations, according to databases maintained by the Federal Election Commission.\nThe advisory group also includes the chief executives of General Motors Co., J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., Wal-Mart Stores Inc., and The Walt Disney Co., and the former chief executive of Boeing Co.\nWrite to Rachael King at rachael.king@wsj.com\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires 12-06-160247ET Copyright (c) 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.",

Sun Life Financial, University of Rochester Medical Center, Avnet, SCANA Corporation, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, California Polytechnic State University, University of New Brunswick and Smarttech   will be amongst 40 organizations testing Watson's ability to assist in the battle against cybercrime.\nToday's increasingly challenging security environment has created the need for more intelligence to identify and prioritize threats, which is in turn increasing the workload of security analysts with more alerts and anomalies to process than ever. Watson for Cyber Security uses intelligent technologies like machine learning and natural language processing, which can help security analysts make better, faster decisions from vast amounts of data. \nA recent study from the IBM Institute for Business Value shows that nearly 60 percent of security professionals believe emerging cognitive technologies will be a critical part of changing the tides in the war on cybercrime. 1 \n\"Customers are in the early stages of implementing cognitive security technologies,\" said Sandy Bird , Chief Technology Officer, IBM Security. \"Our research suggests this adoption will increase three fold over the next three years, as tools like Watson for Cyber Security mature and become pervasive in security operations centers. Currently, only seven percent of security professionals claim to be using cognitive solutions.\"\nIBM Watson for Cyber Security Beta Program Underway \nWatson for Cyber Security takes advantage of IBM's leading cognitive technology, which is being trained to understand the unique language of security. By applying intelligent technologies like machine learning and natural language processing, Watson can help security analysts make better decisions from structured data, as well as the massive amount of unstructured data that has been dark to an organization's defenses until now.\nFortune 500 companies and organizations spanning industries such as finance, travel, energy, automotive and education are currently working with Watson for Cyber Security, helping to refine Watson's cyber security capabilities and pilot real-world use cases. Avnet, California Polytechnic State University, SCANA Corporation, Smarttech, Sun Life Financial, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, University of New Brunswick and University of Rochester Medical Center are amongst the first set of customers already working with Watson for Cyber Security as part of the initial beta program. The beta program will increase to 40 companies in coming weeks.\nThese beta customers are leveraging Watson in their current security environments to bring additional context to their cyber security data, with new use cases such as:\nDetermining whether or not a current security \"offense\" is associated with a known malware or cybercrime campaign; if so, Watson can provide background on the malware employed, vulnerabilities exploited and scope of the threat, among other insights. Better identifying suspicious behavior; Watson provides additional context to user activity outside of the primary suspicious behavior, which can provide better guidance to whether or not an activity is malicious. Working with these beta customers, IBM is continuing to enhance Watson's understanding of the cyber security data and refine how Watson can seamlessly integrate into day to day security operations. \nStudy Shows Cognitive Security on the Rise \nThe IBM Institute for Business Value recently surveyed over 700 security professionals to gauge perspectives on the challenges, benefits and opportunities for cognitive security technologies. \nNearly 60 percent of those surveyed believe that cognitive technologies will mature soon enough to significantly slow down cybercriminals in the near future. While only 7 percent said their organizations are currently in the process of implementing cognitive security solutions, 21 percent said they will implement these solutions over the next 2-3 years, representing a 3x increase in adoption. \nSecurity professionals also said that the top benefit they expect to see from cognitive technologies is improved detection and incident response decision-making capabilities, which was indicated by 40 percent of respondents. Currently, the average data breach takes organizations an average of 201 days to identify and an average of 70 days to contain. 2 Security professionals expect cognitive to play a big part in reducing this time by providing them with better data to make fast decisions. \nTo download the full report, visit: ibm.biz/cyberimmunity \nExpanding Cognitive and Intelligence across IBM Security Portfolio; Investing in World-class Skills \nAs development of Watson for Cyber Security continues, IBM continues to build more advanced analytics and cognitive capabilities into other areas of its security portfolio, as well as its deep bench of world-class security professionals, including the following:\nApplying behavioral analytics to better understand the usage patterns of insiders—employees, contractors and partners—and to determine if their credentials have been compromised, via IBM QRadar User Behavior Analytics .

      "text": "FREDERICTON - The University of New Brunswick is part of an international group of institutions set to begin testing IBM's cognitive technology in the battle against cybercrime.\nIBM's question-answering computer system, known as Watson, was originally designed to compete on the TV quiz show Jeopardy, but the technology has since been used on other problem solving projects from clothing design to cancer — and now cybercrime.\nCaleb Barlow, vice-president of IBM Security, says 40 organizations will begin beta testing of the cognitive technology.\n\"The learning process is going well. Part of this is getting it out there to several beta customers including the University of New Brunswick, California Polytechnic State, Sun Life Financial, University of Rochester Medical Centres, and others,\" Barlow said in an interview.\nBarlow says by teaching Watson to track reports, blogs and other information on emerging threats they'll be able to assist companies facing cyber attacks.\n\"It's not just about learning the language of security. We want it to learn the language of security in the context of real world environments and the context of a diverse set of industries,\" he said.\nNew Brunswick has been aiming to enhance Fredericton's role as a \"centre of excellence\" for cybersecurity.\nAli Ghorbani, UNB's dean of computer science, said the beta testing will provide valuable experience for his students.\n\"They'll be amongst the very first ones to actually work with IBM to gain real world experience in this area,\" Ghorbani said.\n\"Our students will be teaching Watson and then testing and validating the training,\" he said.\nBarlow said cognitive technology will help security teams find and detect cyber threats, but it won't replace humans.\n\"The amount of structured data that is coming in is really astounding. On average now, a good sized security operation centre will see 200,000 pieces of data a day — security related incidents or events,\" he said.\nHe said by 2020 there will be two million unfilled cybersecurity jobs.\n\"We have to be able to come up with tooling to allow you to augment your workforce. We can't solve this with people alone. We need to be able to mine and access these large data environments to be able to figure out what the priority tasks are to work on,\" Barlow said.\nFor now, Watson won't take action against any cyber threat. Instead it will offer advice on what to do.\nBarlow said it's unclear how much beta testing Watson will need before it's ready to take on the job of combating cyber threats. He said it all depends on how fast Watson learns.\n\"We are in completely unchartered territory here. No one has ever done this before. No one has ever had a system of this level of sophistication or this level of scale. We are excited to see how long it takes,\" Barlow said.\n ",

      "text": "Read More \nA total of 40 organisations are taking part in the IBM Watson for Cyber Security beta program in order to test Watson's ability to fight cybercrime. Participants include Sun Life Financial, University of Rochester Medical Center, SCANA Corporation, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, California Polytechnic State University, University of New Brunswick, Avnet, and Smarttech. \nBy using Watson to shore up cybersecurity defences, IBM hopes to demonstrate new use cases for the cognitive system, such as determining whether a cyberattack is associated with known variants of malware or particular cybercrime campaigns. If so, IBM Watson Security is designed to provide information on the malware employed and the level of threat posed. \nWatson is also built to aid organisations in identifying suspicious behaviour, by applying behavioural biometrics and using context to establish whether user activity is malicious or just different to normal. By working with beta customers, IBM hopes to enhance Watson's understanding of cybersecurity data and operations and better integrate it into everyday processes. \nIBM believes that cognitive technology will play a critical role in the war against cybercrime as the technology matures. According to the company's own research , seven percent of organisations currently use cognitive technology in this way and that figure is set to grow. \n\"Customers are in the early stages of implementing cognitive technologies,\" said Sandy Bird, CTO with IBM Security. \"Our research suggests this adoption will increase three fold over the next three years, as tools like Watson for Cyber Security mature and become pervasive in security operations centres.\" \nIBM Watson's cognitive systems are also being deployed to aid in healthcare and help re-imagine the services industry .

      "text": "Search: Better Buy: Cisco Systems vs. IBM Both tech giants are in the midst of reinventing themselves, but one holds a slight edge. Tim Brugger ( timbrugger ) Dec 6, 2016 at 7:30AM \nThe question of which tech behemoth's stock is the better buy, Cisco 's ( NASDAQ:CSCO ) or IBM 's ( NYSE:IBM ) , poses a nice dilemma. Both are transitioning away from traditional, enterprise-centric hardware and other outdated solutions, and are laser-focused on the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud, data centers, and technology that secures the growing amount of information collected in today's digital world. \nThat said, Cisco and IBM are taking different tacks to dominate their respective markets. At Cisco, an all-out push into the cloud, smart cities, and other IoT-related opportunities still entails selling its switches and routers, though CEO Chuck Robbins is focused on software and other solutions to drive a more stable, long-term recurring-revenue model. \nIBM's fast-growing cloud and IoT units have it near the front of the pack in both areas, but its emphasis is less about its SoftLayer cloud-hosting platform and more about offering advanced cognitive-computing solutions so its clients can interpret and ultimately utilize all that data. Image source: Cisco. The case for Cisco \nInvestors were less than enthusiastic when Cisco announced in August that it was laying off 5,500 employees, equal to 7% of its global workforce. But it's the right move, for a couple of reasons. As Cisco said when the news was shared, the decision to cut jobs allows it to \"move with greater speed,\" a necessity in the early-stage markets it's focused on. \nSecondly, Cisco said the expenses saved from its restructuring will be used to fund innovations,\" though with cash and investments totaling nearly $71 billion on the balance sheet as of last quarter, funding research and development won't be a problem. Cisco's expense management is already taking hold as the company cut cost of sales by 8% in its fiscal 2017 first quarter compared to the year-ago period. \nBetter still, Cisco's cost-saving efforts didn't prevent it from increasing total revenue by 1% last quarter after accounting for the divestiture of its SP Video business, to $12.4 billion. However, both its revenue gain and belt-tightening took a back seat to the recurring-revenue improvement. Consistent ongoing revenue is a key metric in how successful Cisco is in transforming its business, and last quarter was nothing short of spectacular. \nDeferred revenue specific to Cisco's recurring and subscription sales climbed to an impressive $3.8 billion, up a whopping 48% from a year ago. That's more recurring revenue than the entire unit reported in the quarter -- that figure increased 7.5%, to $3 billion. Image source: IBM. The case for IBM \nWhen IBM CEO Ginni Rometty first announced her plans to move away from a reliance on legacy enterprise sales and focus on \"strategic imperatives\" consisting of cloud, IoT, data analytics, and security, the plan was to reach 40% of total sales from the initiative on a trailing annual basis. An indication that IBM's transformation is succeeding came last quarter when that 40% was reached over a year ahead of schedule. \nIn fact, last quarter's 16% gain in strategic imperative sales, to $8 billion, equaled 42% of IBM's $19.2 billion in revenue. Not surprisingly, cloud sales led the way, and an annual run rate of $12.7 billion positions IBM near the top of the heap. And that's not even the best news IBM shared in its third-quarter earnings announcement. \nIBM's \"cloud as a service,\" which includes its software, analytics, and similar business process offerings, climbed 66% year over year, to an annual run rate of $7.5 billion in the third quarter. That's a critical component of total cloud sales, and a metric worth monitoring because of the endless possibilities those markets represent. \nAccording to one forecast, the software and business process markets combined are expected to drive $80.3 billion in revenue this year, far and away the cloud's biggest segments outside of ad spend. And IBM is leading the charge. The better buy? \nIn addition to both Cisco's and IBM's early success in up-and-coming hyper-growth markets, each stock offers shareholders an impressive 3.5% dividend yield. So, which is the better buy? Either one should treat long-term investors well over time, but IBM is slightly ahead of Cisco in its transition, earning it the nod in this showdown. \nTim Brugger has no position in any stocks mentioned.

      "text": "FREDERICTON - Just seven months after IBM announced it would begin teaching its Watson computer system to fight cybercrime, the company is graduating Watson to the next level of instruction.\nCaleb Barlow, vice-president of IBM Security, says 40 organizations will begin beta testing of the cognitive technology.\nThis Jan. 13, 2011 photo provided by IBM shows the IBM computer system known as Watson at IBM's T.J. Watson research center in Yorktown Heights, N.Y. Just seven months after IBM announced it would begin teaching its Watson computer system to fight cybercrime, the company is graduating Watson to the next level of instruction. THE CANADIAN PRESS/AP, IBM\n\"The learning process is going well. Part of this is getting it out there to several beta customers including the University of New Brunswick, California State Polytechnic, Sun Life Financial, University of Rochester Medical Centres and others,\" Barlow said in an interview.\nWatson — IBM's question answering computer system — was originally designed to compete (and win) on the television quiz show Jeopardy, but the technology has since been used on other problem-solving projects, from clothing design to cancer.\nBarlow says by teaching Watson to track reports, blogs and other information on emerging threats they'll be able to assist companies facing cyber attacks.\n\"It's not just about learning the language of security. We want it to learn the language of security in the context of real world environments and the context of a diverse set of industries,\" he said. \"The language of security in a health-care company like University of Rochester Medical Centre is probably going to be a little different than what we're going to see for example at an energy company.\"\nAli Ghorbani, UNB's dean of computer science, said the beta testing will provide valuable experience for his students.\n\"They'll be amongst the very first ones to actually work with IBM to gain real world experience in this area,\" Ghorbani said.\n\"Our students will be teaching Watson and then testing and validating the training,\" he said.\nBarlow said cognitive technology will help security teams find and detect cyber threats, but it won't replace humans.\n\"The amount of structured data that is coming in is really astounding. On average now, a good sized security operation centre will see 200,000 pieces of data a day — security related incidents or events,\" he said.\nHe said by 2020, there will be two million unfilled cybersecurity jobs.\n\"We have to be able to come up with tooling to allow you to augment your workforce. We can't solve this with people alone. We need to be able to mine and access these large data environments to be able to figure out what the priority tasks are to work on,\" Barlow said.\nFor now, Watson won't take action against any cyber threat. Instead it will offer advice on what to do.\nBarlow said it's unclear how much beta testing Watson will need before it's ready to take on the job of combating cyber threats. He said it all depends on how fast Watson learns.\n\"We are in completely unchartered territory here. No one has ever done this before. No one has ever had a system of this level of sophistication or this level of scale. We are excited to see how long it takes,\" Barlow said.\n ",

      "text": "Share: Video ad platform Innovid will integrate with marketing clouds from IBM, Adobe and Oracle, the companies said Tuesday, allowing video and TV planners to use CRM data to inform video ads served by Innovid.\nConversely, those marketing cloud customers can apply intent data from their mobile, desktop and OTT video campaigns to their broader marketing mixes. One side benefit? Marketers can improve their message sequencing. \nIt’s a relatively new phenomenon for marketing clouds to connect with video ad tech ( see : Adobe buying TubeMogul). Typically, marketing automation and video planning were separate, with media agencies focusing on the latter. \n“What’s driving more convergence is brands are looking at all their spend and saying, ‘How can we use our data better in TV planning?’” said Zvika Netter, co-founder and CEO of Innovid. “The initial point of integration [for advertising and marketing] was the DMP, which drove all of the consolidation we saw, and now it’s the marketing automation system.” \nNetter says this convergence will lead to better video creative. (Innovid released a programmatic creative tool last year.) \nBecause ad delivery systems don’t always connect seamlessly with CRM systems (read: marketing clouds), it creates disjointed or repetitive experiences, like a set-top box continuously looping the same video ad for a wide swath of consumers. \nAnd Innovid’s technology also serves interactive video, which is a more intricate format. \n“With interactive video, you also ingest a lot of new data exhaust you’ve never had access to before,” Netter said. \nFor instance, a financial services advertiser might embed a credit calculator into an interactive video ad while an auto advertiser might know a consumer selected an SUV instead of a sedan in a car-comparison feature within an interactive video ad. \nBoth pieces of information could prove useful for marketers but didn't always make it into advertisers’ databases in the past. \n“That information used to vaporize,” he said. “In the past, it would go in a [post-campaign analysis] report, but now it can flow right back to the DMP or CRM system and change who the marketer sends a follow-up email to or the experience of their website.” \nThe connection between video ad platforms and marketing clouds also enables better content sequencing. \nBrands like Kimberly-Clark don’t care where they reach a consumer; they prefer to know how often they’ve delivered that ad, and where the consumer is in the purchase funnel. \nAnd that requires stronger integration of first-party data at the ad server level. \n“There are amazing DCO (dynamic content optimization) platforms that allow you to connect first- and third-party data sets, but how do you automate the rules to capitalize on it from a delivery standpoint?” said Cameron Friedlander, director of marketing technology for Kimberly-Clark, which owns consumer packaged-goods brands like Huggies, Kotex and Cottonelle. “That’s the trickiest part no one’s talking about.” \nBut Friedlander noted connecting these systems is also an organizational challenge at the planning level. \n“It completely flips the way the agency has to think about these ads,” he said. “It’s one thing to say you can hustle out 1,000 different personalized ads, but you need to be able to then deliver on that from an execution standpoint.” \nIf brands like Kimberly-Clark and outdoor lifestyle retailer REI, which also uses Innovid, can combine video viewership data with first-party data more easily, another benefit is increased personalization. \nFor example, if a consumer has identified themselves as a trail runner, “We can serve them a trail running video, along with articles that complement the video, classes in their area and expert advice,” said Amy Ball, senior program manager of advertising for REI. “Another benefit is that we can follow up with them later when we have new trail running product they may be interested in.”",

      "text": "Re-Thinking Aging Through IBM Design Thinking December 6, 2016 | Written by: Luke Goh \nCategorized: IBM Impact Grants \nAging is a growing concern in Singapore. According to the Ministry of Health , in 2030, one in four Singaporeans will be above the age of 65. That is equivalent to 900,000 seniors, or approximately double of the 440,000 seniors today. As part of IBM’s way to contribute back to the society, IBM Corporate Citizenship & Corporate Affairs – in partnership with the Ministry of Health – hosted a two-day IBM Impact Grant Design Thinking Workshop on November 15 th and 16 th , with the aim to develop appropriate solutions to help tackle issues related to aging in Singapore. Workshop introduction by the IBM team \nPresent at the two-day IBM Design Thinking Workshop were more than 20 influencers from both the government and private sectors, in addition to IBM Design Thinking practitioners from Singapore and across the globe. At the workshop, participants were introduced to several IBM Design Thinking elements to help them empathize with four preselected elderly personae. Ideation tools that are commonly used in IBM Design Thinking workshops were also introduced to participants during the creative process. \nAt the end of the two-day workshop, the group shortlisted more than a dozen ideas for further development. While IBM aims to bring the shortlisted ideas to the Ministry of Health for further discussions and to explore the possibilities of implementing them, participants from both private and public sectors who have shown keen interest in some of these ideas have also endorsed their viability as real-world solutions. Workshop participant doing a playback of an AS-IS scenario \nThe IBM Design Thinking Workshop was a great way to help Singapore’s Ministry of Health look at community challenges related to an aging society. As a demonstration of IBM’s innovative problem-solving capabilities, the workshop has also helped engage the government, NGOs and like-minded members of the private sector in using technology to help manage social challenges that no single entity can overcome alone. \nLuke Goh is a Service Designer with IBM Global Services in Singapore. \nRelated Resources:",

      "text": "FREDERICTON — Just seven months after IBM announced it would begin teaching its Watson computer system to fight cybercrime, the company is graduating Watson to the next level of instruction. Caleb Barlow, vice-president of IBM Security, says 40 organizations will begin beta testing of the cognitive technology.\n\"The learning process is going well. Part of this is getting it out there to several beta customers including the University of New Brunswick, California State Polytechnic, Sun Life Financial, University of Rochester Medical Centres and others,\" Barlow said in an interview.  \nWatson — IBM's question answering computer system — was originally designed to compete (and win) on the television quiz show Jeopardy, but the technology has since been used on other problem-solving projects, from clothing design to cancer.\nBarlow says by teaching Watson to track reports, blogs and other information on emerging threats they'll be able to assist companies facing cyber attacks.\n\"It's not just about learning the language of security. We want it to learn the language of security in the context of real world environments and the context of a diverse set of industries,\" he said. \"The language of security in a health-care company like University of Rochester Medical Centre is probably going to be a little different than what we're going to see for example at an energy company.\"\nAli Ghorbani, UNB's dean of computer science, said the beta testing will provide valuable experience for his students.\n\"They'll be amongst the very first ones to actually work with IBM to gain real world experience in this area,\" Ghorbani said.\n\"Our students will be teaching Watson and then testing and validating the training,\" he said.\nBarlow said cognitive technology will help security teams find and detect cyber threats, but it won't replace humans.\n\"The amount of structured data that is coming in is really astounding. On average now, a good sized security operation centre will see 200,000 pieces of data a day — security related incidents or events,\" he said. \nHe said by 2020, there will be two million unfilled cybersecurity jobs.\n\"We have to be able to come up with tooling to allow you to augment your workforce. We can't solve this with people alone. We need to be able to mine and access these large data environments to be able to figure out what the priority tasks are to work on,\" Barlow said. \nFor now, Watson won't take action against any cyber threat. Instead it will offer advice on what to do.\nBarlow said it's unclear how much beta testing Watson will need before it's ready to take on the job of combating cyber threats. He said it all depends on how fast Watson learns.\n\"We are in completely unchartered territory here. No one has ever done this before. No one has ever had a system of this level of sophistication or this level of scale. We are excited to see how long it takes,\" Barlow said.  \nKevin Bissett, The Canadian Press",

      "text": "Related resources \nARMONK, N.Y. - 06 Dec 2016: IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced new Bluemix services designed to simplify and speed app development in the cloud. With these new services, developers can now access and construct preconfigured toolchains using popular DevOps tools, including GitHub and Slack. Toolchains, an integrated set of DevOps tools that support app development, deployment and operations tasks, are integral to the app development process. However, because they are typically comprised of a variety of tools from multiple vendors as well as open source solutions, integration, maintenance and deployment of these toolchains can be an arduous task that can take days or even weeks to complete. \nTo address this challenge, IBM Bluemix Continuous Delivery provides DevOps teams with a central hub to create, manage and scale toolchains. In addition, the Delivery Pipeline service automates builds, tests and deployments and can detect issues before applications go live, which can save developers time and effort and potentially reduce time to value. \nThe new service also provides toolchain templates designed to be provisioned enterprise-wide with a few mouse clicks and help make it faster and easier to scale toolchains, and potentially reduce cost and time to value for DevOps solutions. Templates available now include toolchains to help build microservices, containers, or cloud-native applications, with integrations to popular solutions such as GitHub, Slack, PagerDuty and Sauce Labs. \n\"Millions of developers use GitHub to build personal projects, support their businesses, and work together on open source technologies,\" said GitHub's Todd Berman, VP of Engineering. “GitHub is a powerful addition to IBM’s Bluemix Continuous Delivery service that builds on our strategic partnership to dramatically advance the development of next generation cloud applications for enterprise customers.” \nBy giving an organization the ability to create and share custom toolchain templates across their business, IBM Bluemix Continuous Delivery helps automate a wide variety of common DevOps tasks for a range of application types, to help developers get working instead of spinning up new toolchains for each project. \nIn addition to integration with popular tools like GitHub, PagerDuty, Sauce Labs and Slack, Bluemix Continuous Delivery taps into IBM’s new Availability Monitoring service to help ensure applications are available and meeting user expectations as developers roll out updates. This service runs simulated user tests from around the world, 24/7, to help detect problems in web applications and REST architecture APIs. When integrated into toolchains, it is designed to provide quick insights to the root cause of problems so teams can make sure their applications are running efficiently. \n“One of the biggest challenges developers face in today’s cloud-led world is efficiently building and deploying applications to stay competitive,” said Dave Lindquist, IBM Fellow and Vice President of Development, IBM Cloud DevOps and Analytics. “With the introduction of Bluemix Continuous Delivery, developers can not only create, integrate and share DevOps toolchains using their favorite tools, but also add optional pay-as-you-go powerful services like cognitive computing with Watson or data and analytics services from The Weather Company.\" \nDevOps users can also benefit from the IBM and Slack partnership announced in October to bring Watson to Slack’s global community of developers and enterprise users. IBM and Slack intend to develop new and improved communications tools for users of the Slack platform, including an updated Slackbot to be powered by Watson, and an IBM Watson-enabled bot for IT and network operational incidents, so enterprise devops teams can more efficiently identify, address and fix these issues. \nBluemix, IBM’s cloud platform, has grown rapidly to become one of the largest open, public cloud deployments in the world. Based in open standards, it features over 150 advanced technologies and services, including cognitive computing, blockchain, Internet of Things, cloud data services, DevOps and security. \nFor more information on IBM Cloud, visit www.ibm.com/cloud . \nTo try Bluemix Continuous Delivery and Bluemix Availability Monitoring today, visit: https://bluemix.net/devops .

      "text": "Tong Li / December 6, 2016 / 0 comments \nVirtualBox is a freely available hardware virtualization software from Oracle that is widely used for creating virtual computers. With cloud computing getting more attention by both companies and individual developers, VirtualBox has become a de facto standard tool for cloud computing development. As a developer, if you only need to occasionally create a virtual machine, the graphical user interface provided by the software is very easy to use and gives you a great deal of options for you to change the characteristics of a virtual machine (VM). However, when you try to create a cluster of multiple VirtualBox virtual machines and utilize the various features of the networks provided by the software, the task of setting up the many machines by hand can be very time consuming and error prone. In this blog, I will first go over the types of networks VirtualBox provides, then introduce a set of vagrant scripts to show how you can quickly automate the process of creating a cluster of many VMs for your cloud needs such as setting up a multi-node OpenStack cloud. \nVirtualBox allows a VM to have up to four network adapters, that is, a virtual computer can have up to four network interfaces, and each network interface can connect to the same or different network. The following two screenshots show the four available adapters and possible types for each adapter. \nThe type of an adapter determines the behavior of that network interface. The types of the adapter provided by VirtualBox are Host-only, NAT, NAT Network, Bridged and Internal Network. Host-only adapter allows the host (the physical computer running VirtualBox) and the VM to communicate with each other but a VM with a Host-only adapter will not be able to connect to outside of the host such as internet. NAT adapter allows the VM to access the internet but no one can access the virtual machine unless port forwarding is setup. NAT network adapter is very similar to NAT but virtual machines on the same NAT network will be able to see each other and can access the internet but cannot be accessed by other machines including the host. Bridged adapter is like an adapter directly hooked up to the network that the host is hooked up to, the adapter will get the IP address in the same segment as the host network adapter, the host and the VM can access each other and can access the internet, the VM behaves just like another physical computer on the same network. The internal network adapter is similar to a NAT network adapter but those networks can only see each other, the VMs using the internal network adapter will not have access to any machines which are not on the same internal network. Because of all these types of network adapters, selecting right network adapters for your VMs can be confusing, having the wrong types of adapters for VMs can make your VMs not behave well, but may also produce security issues. To help make all of this easier, I have created a vagrant project to help with the task. At the bottom of the blog you can find the link to the project. \nTo use the project, you can simply download it from the link and make a few changes to the configuration file to meet your needs, then you can run a vagrant command to create the VMs that are defined in the configuration file. The project includes the typical Vagrantfile, as well as a configuration and a README file. The Vagrantfile contains code for VM creation and removal according to the configuration file. You will not need to make any changes to the Vagrantfile. All you have to do to create your own desired VMs is to make some changes to the configuration file. The configuration file is named nodes.conf.yml and it is a yaml file. All the VMs to be created should have an entry in this file. \nThe file nodes.conf.yml file has two sections: \n1. Node section: this section defines virtual machine characteristics or types. 2. Machine section: this section defines what types of virtual machines should be actually created, you can have as many types of virtual machines defined in the Node section, but you may choose to only create one type of virtual machine to quickly test if the definition is correct. \nHere is the content of the nodes.conf.yml file, the file was created to show various network options. --- nodes.conf.yml # The following defines server specifics controller: quantity: 2 cpus: 2 customize: ['--nic2', 'natnetwork', '--nat-network2', 'NatNetwork1', '--nic3', 'natnetwork', '--nat-network3', 'NatNetwork2'] balancer: memory: 4096 cpus: 1 networks: - nettype: 'private_network' ip: '192.168.56.11' virtualbox__hostonly: 'vboxnet0' netmask: '255.255.255.0' adapter: 2 - nettype: 'private_network' ip: '10.5.2.11' virtualbox__intnet: 'myintnet' netmask: '255.255.255.0' adapter: 3 compute: quantity: 3 memory: 4096 cpus: 2 networks: - nettype: 'public_network' bridge: 'en4: Thunderbolt Ethernet' adapter: 2 # The following list defines the sequence to provision servers machines: - controller - balancer - compute \nIn the example above, the node section defines a total of three VM types, a controller, balancer and computer. The controller type of VMs will have two CPUs, 2GB of memory by default since the memory field is missing, and two additional network cards both using a NAT network adapter. The quantity field indicates that there will be two instances of this type of VM created, the first will be named controller-0, and the second will be named controller-1. The balancer type of VMs should have 4GB of memory, one CPU and two additional network adapters, one network is Host-only and one network is defined as an Internal network. Only one instance of the balancer VM will be created. That instance will be named balancer-0. The compute type of VMs should have 4 GB of memory, 2 CPUs and one additional network adapter using the bridged network. The quantity of 3 indicates that there will be three instances of compute VM created. The type name of the VMs are important since that name will be used as part of the virtual machine hostname, and when you look for VMs in your file system, these names will be the folder names which represent each VM. \nThe machine section controls the virtual machine creation sequence. The above example shows that VMs of the controller type will be created first, then balancer VM, lastly the compute VMs. If you would only want to create compute VMs, you can simply comment out the line – controller and – balancer in the machine section, run the vagrant script, only compute VMs will be created even though this configuration file has more types defined. \nWith the project, you can define many virtual machine types with many different configuration options, then specify how many instances for each type by using the quantity field in the configuration file, you can create many virtual machines with very little work. \nTo create VMs, simply run the following command: vagrant up \nTo destroy all the VMs, simply run the following command: vagrant destroy \nMore information can be found in the README file of the project. The project is hosted by github.com as an open source project, it can be found by following the below link: ",

      "text": "ZDNet Japan IBM unveils BlueMix Continuous Delivery, a central hub for DevOps The new service automatically integrates with third party, open source and IBM tools, allowing developers to quickly build and access preconfigured toolchains. | Topic: Cloud IBM \nIBM on December 6 rolled out a new Bluemix cloud service that will help developers quickly build, monitor, and scale out the toolchains needed to drive app development. What's Hot on ZDNet IBM Watson AI: These firms are fighting cybercrime using cognitive computing \nThe service, Bluemix Continuous Delivery, automatically integrates with tools from third parties like GitHub and Slack, as well as open source and IBM tools. Manually integrating tools together can take hours or days. \nWith the new service, developers can also exploit toolchain templates to scale toolchains across their enterprise with just a few mouse clicks. Some templates already available include toolchains for building microservices, containers, and cloud-native applications. \nContinuous Delivery also offers a Delivery Pipeline, which automates builds, tests, and deployments. Additionally, it taps into IBM's Availability Monitoring service to ensure applications are always available and performing as expected as developers roll out updates. \n\"One of the biggest challenges developers face In today's cloud-led world is quickly building and deploying applications to stay competitive,\" IBM vice president Dave Lindquist said in a statement. \"With the introduction of BlueMix Continuous Delivery, developers can not only rapidly create, integrate and share DevOps toolchains using their favorite tools, but also quickly add powerful new services like cognitive computing with Watson or data and analytics services from The Weather Company.\" \nA recent survey of IT executives found that DevOps is moving beyond the bounds of IT departments and is now embraced across the enterprise. At the Amazon Web Services re:Invent conference last week, AWS unveiled its own series of DevOps tools , and Amazon CTO Werner Vogels stressed that development and testing is the key to building a fast-moving, agile business.

      "text": "TSMC, IBM Detail 7-nm Work Separate talks upbeat on EUV lithography Tweet SAN FRANCISCO — Like presents under a Christmas tree, separate papers on 7-nm process technology from TSMC and IBM energized a packed ballroom on the first day of the International Electron Devices Meeting ( IEDM ). They showed results nudging forward both Moore’s law and extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV). \nTSMC reported the smallest 6T SRAM to date in a process that it aims to put into risk production by April. IBM described the smallest FinFET made to date in a research device made with EUV. \nConference organizers highlighted the papers in October as late-news headliners for the event. Nevertheless, both companies surprised some attendees with more upbeat results than expected. \nIBM showed FinFETs with contacted poly pitch of 44/48 nm, a metallization pitch of 36 nm, and a fin pitch of 27 nm. One device included a source-to-drain contact opening of about 10 nm and a gate length of about 15 nm. TSMC detailed its 7-nm advances over its 16FF+ process (Images: IEDM). \nTSMC described a 256-Mbit SRAM test chip with the cell density of 0.027 mm 2 with full read/write capabilities down to 0.5 V. The node should provide up to a 40% speed gain, a 65% power reduction, and a 3.3x routed gate density increase compared to TSMC’s 16FF+ process now in volume production, said Michael Shien-Yang Wu, a senior director of N7 development at TSMC. \nAlthough it was not part of his formal paper, Wu also commented on work using the 7-nm process to validate EUV. The next generation lithography provided “comparable patterning fidelity” and “comparable yield” to the conventional immersion steppers it will use in the commercial 7-nm process next year. \nThe EUV systems from ASML are still in a pre-production release. TSMC already announced its plans to start using EUV in its 5-nm node. \nWu declined to give details of how the 7-nm process compares to its 10-nm node or nodes from rivals such as Samsung. He also declined to give aspect ratios of his 7-nm FinFETs, details about a “novel strain technology” the node uses or figures for yields of a test chip that included a GPU and ARM Cortex A-72 core, except that they were in “double digits.” \nThe paper gave no indication of what range of voltages that TSMC will support at 7 nm, noted David Kanter, analyst with Real World Technologies. In addition, the paper contained no micrographs which could have revealed whether the node supports air gaps. \nWu did say TSMC had reached 50% yields on its 7nm SRAM. That suggests it is on a path to have volume manufacturing in the process by late 2017, Kanter said.

      "text": "Cloud IBM announces new Bluemix tools to accelerate cloud app development IBM recently made its Bluemix Continuous Delivery product available on Bluemix Dedicated private cloud and upgraded some of its integrated services. By Conner Forrest | December 6, 2016, 7:34 AM PST Google Plus Image: iStockphoto/eugenesergeev \nOn Tuesday, IBM announced that it was making its Bluemix Continuous Delivery generally available on the Bluemix Dedicated virtual private cloud, and that it was adding more integrated toolchains to make it faster and easier for developers to build apps in the cloud. \nBluemix Continuous Delivery became generally available on Bluemix Public on November 18, 2016. However, the addition of Bluemix Dedicated adds another option for companies and development teams that may not be completely sold on the idea of public cloud. \nFor those unfamiliar, Continuous Delivery is a DevOps hub that allows users to automate builds, run unit tests, and more. It relies on bundled toolchains that add additional management capabilities, and it also offers insights into security, quality, and build status, according to the website . \nSEE: Job description: Cloud engineer (Tech Pro Research) \nIn addition to offering Continuous Delivery on Bluemix Dedicated, IBM also announced new toolchain templates that can help developers and operations more effectively build out toolchains for microservices, containers, or cloud-native apps, the release said. It also includes improved integrations with GitHub, Slack, PagerDuty, and Sauce Labs. Must-Read Cloud Subscribe to TechRepublic's Cloud Insights newsletter \n\"Millions of developers use GitHub to build personal projects, support their businesses, and work together on open source technologies,\" Todd Berman, vice president of engineering for GitHub, said in the press release. \"GitHub is a powerful addition to IBM's Bluemix Continuous Delivery service that builds on our strategic partnership to dramatically advance the development of next generation cloud applications for enterprise customers.\" \nThe goal of these new templates is to broaden the number of DevOps tasks and processes that can be automated, with the hopes that it will save developers time without having to recreate toolchains for each new project, the release said. \nAdditionally, Bluemix Continuous Delivery also leverages IBM's new Availability Monitoring service, which runs simulated user tests to look for problems that may exist in an app or API, which can then be fed to developers through toolchains. This is to \"help ensure applications are available and meeting user expectations as developers roll out updates,\" the release stated. \nIf effective, IBM Bluemix Continuous Delivery could help solve the problem of quickly and efficiently deploying applications—a problem that IBM's Dave Lindquist said, in the press release, is \"one of the biggest challenges developers face in today's cloud-led world.\" The 3 big takeaways for TechRepublic readers IBM Bluemix Continuous Delivery is now available on Bluemix Dedicated private cloud, along with new toolchain templates. Developers can use the toolchain templates to save time on DevOps projects without having to keep recreating certain templates. Overall, Bluemix Continuous Delivery's main goal is to increase the speed and efficiency of continuously releasing new apps so companies can stay competitive.
