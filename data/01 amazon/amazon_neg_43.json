      "text": "\nThumb Score: +4 Staples BF pricing just went live within the hour and they have the Amazon Echo for $139.99 like everywhere else. They also have the $25 off a $100 or more purchase when you checkout with Visa Checkout. Combine the sale and the Visa Checkout promo and the Echo comes out to $114.99. \n\nThe Visa Checkout promo ends 11/27 or while supplies last, so probably sooner.\n\nAlso, if you are lucky enough to have the Amex offer for $20 off $100 at Staples, use your Amex card through Visa Checkout and you'll get an extra $20 off, bringing the price down to $94.99 before applicable tax (this is what I did).\n",

      "text": "Credit: Amazon, NewSouth Books , Pelagic Publishing Advertisement | Report Ad \nFlying Dinosaurs: How Fearsome Reptiles Became Birds , by John Pickrell. Readers of this blog will be familiar with the robust body of fossil evidence which shows that birds are theropod dinosaurs, that features long regarded as unique to birds actually evolved deep within Theropoda, and that there is no longer any clear demarcation between birds and bird-like non-birds. It’s all shades of grey. My copy of the book does not have that quote from Tim Flannery at top right. Credit: NewSouth Books . \nFlying Dinosaurs reviews our current understanding of bird origins, focusing in particular on recent fossil discoveries and newly proposed ideas. I will admit that I initially suspected this book to be another retelling of all the things we’ve learnt about bird origins and bird-like non-bird theropods since the mid-1990s – in other words, an updated version of Pat Shipman’s 1999 Taking Wing: Archaeopteryx and the Evolution of Bird Flight . But that’s not a fair characterisation. Flying Dinosaurs is less analytical than Shipman’s book – my recollection of that work is that a great part of it was devoted to a weighing up of the two primary schools of thought on bird origins (the Feducciaries vs the Ostromids) – and more of a popular run-through of the modern state of our knowledge. It pretty much succeeds, and is very well written. \nIt covers a bit more than the topic of bird origins and recently discovered near-bird fossils alone: chapters also cover the international trade in fossils, the reproductive strategies likely used by extinct dinosaurs, the preservation of colour in dinosaur fossils, the evolution of feathers, Jack Horner’s ontogenetic morphing hypothesis and chickensaurus project, and the end-Cretaceous extinction event. A lot of this is great and carries the story right up to the minute, but some of it does feel a bit out of place. Yay chickensaurus, such a fine idea. Credit: Darren Naish. \nA colour plate section features numerous handsome reconstructions and colour images of spectacular fossils. I will admit that one thing I don’t like is the frequent use of quoted sections of text – I much prefer to see an author describe things in their own words – but this is a minor quibble. I’m likewise not personally too keen on that subtitle (“ How Fearsome Reptiles Became Birds ”)… Anyway, Flying Dinosaurs is a great, easily absorbed read that covers a huge range of subjects. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to be brought up to speed on our knowledge of the ‘bird-theropod’ transition. \nJohn Pickrell. 2015. Flying Dinosaurs: How Fearsome Reptiles Became Birds .

The literature on birds – the historical literature, the technical literature, the popular literature – is renowned for the phenomenal artwork so often produced to accompany it. Colour plates, depicting bird species in life, have been a mainstay of monographs for as long as such works have existed, and woodcuts and other illustrations have accompanied encyclopaedias and other works for even longer. So attractive (and often famous) are these sorts of illustrations – and such is the popularity of birds and imagery depicting them – that there has long been a tradition of removing them from their original works and selling them as stand-alone prints. Wouldn’t it be a great idea if someone were to produce a work in which a wide selection of such artworks were available in this very form? This is exactly what has happened. \nExtraordinary Birds is not a book, but a boxed collection of replica plates and a book, compiled and written by Paul Sweet and utilising originals housed in the collections of the American Museum of Natural History Library. The 40 prints comprise examples from the works of Audubon, Gould, Lear, Wolf, Keulemans, Fuertes and others. They’re printed on high quality paper, faithfully reproduce the colours of the originals, and are ready for framing. I don’t have a spare wall big enough for 40 framed prints, but I wish I did. It’s a spectacularly good idea. The look of the book itself, and of some of the prints. Credit: The Birder's Library . \nThe accompanying softback book is an excellent and extremely well illustrated introduction to ornithology and specifically to the history of birds in art. Essays accompany each of the 40 plates, each one providing biographical information on the artist and on the scientific relevance of the art. Those well versed in the history of ornithology and the artists, naturalists and explorers who have contributed to ornithological discovery will find some of the details here familiar; such readers will very much be in the minority, however, and there is a huge amount here not readily available elsewhere. \nAs both a review of ornithological history and a collection of fine artworks, Extraordinary Birds is exceptionally recommended and those seriously interested in the history of ornithology should obtain it. \nPaul Sweet. 2013. Extraordinary Birds: Rare Book Selections from the American Museum of Natural History Library . American Museum of Natural History, New York, pp. 134, ISBN 978-1-4549-0659-9. Here on amazon.

Remote cameras, triggered by movement, designed to automatically take still or moving images of animals that pass in front of them, and popularly termed ‘camera traps’, have become an integral part of 21st century wildlife research worldwide. Technically speaking, camera trapping is not new – it’s been around since the 1890s. But the number of camera trap studies has increased exponentially since about 2006, and those who keep tabs on the conservation, wildlife management and behavioural literature will know that camera trap use has allowed the photographic documentation of many species for the first time, or at least in areas or environments where they were not documented before. As technology has improved and as prices have come down, use of the cameras concerned has spread outside of the scientific research community and into the recreational hunting and animal-seeking industry (yeah, bigfoot, British big cats, Loch Ness monsters…). \nFrancesco Rovero and Fridolin Zimmerman’s new multi-authored volume is therefore very timely and certainly provides an excellent introduction to both the camera trap literature and on how camera trap data can be utilised. I feel duty bound to mention that there are other books with the term ‘Camera Trapping’ in the title. This is Meek & Fleming’s 2014 book. Credit: CSIRO . \nMost of the book’s 11 chapters review the use of camera trap data in calculating the abundance of a species in a given area and its use in monitoring studies. Much of this is, admittedly, heavy going to those not involved or especially interested in such studies. The book leads with an introduction to camera trapping in general by Rovero and Zimmermann: this is where we hear about recent discoveries made via the use of camera traps (Golden jackals Canis aureus in Switzerland, that kind of thing). The same authors also provide a chapter reviewing camera trap design and function and on how to use them. \nOf the other contributions, I particularly liked Zimmerman et al .’s chapter on camera trap data as it pertains to behavioural studies. I also found Paul Meek and Zimmerman’s chapter on camera trapping and public engagement interesting. We are all quite used to camera trap images that show humans passing by and engaging in assorted behaviours. Well, there are parts of the world where those images really should not have been shared: they sometimes represent privacy violations, and camera-users need to make themselves aware of local policy and feelings towards non-consensual photography before doing anything with the images concerned. \nGraphs, tables and digital maps appear throughout the volume; in addition there are images of in-situ camera traps in Rovero and Zimmermann’s chapter. Images of camera-trapped animals themselves appear in a few places: I know that the appearance of such images was not the raison d’etre of the book but I would still like to have seen more of them. Each chapter is fully referenced. Camera trap image of a bear. Not a bigfoot. Bigfoot is able to avoid camera traps. Credit: Bureau of Land Management Oregon and Washington , wikipedia . \nAs implied above, this is a sometimes heavy, technical work – more like the collected results of a technical symposium than the ‘how to’ guide I was initially expecting. It should definitely be obtained by technical researchers pursuing the application of camera trap data in their research but, more broadly, it includes at least something of interest to anyone curious about the technique and the results it can obtain. \nIt does not include a section on bigfoot. \nFrancesco Rovero and Fridolin Zimmerman. 2016.

They include Henry Nicholls’s The Galápagos: A Natural History (2014, Basic Books), Hannah Bonner’s Dining With Dinosaurs: A Tasty Guide to Mesozoic Munching (National Geographic Kids, 2016), Matt Wilkinson’s Restless Creatures: the Story of Life in Ten Movements (2016, Basic Books), Williams et al .’s The Future of Phylogenetic Systematics: the Legacy of Willi Henning (2016, Cambridge University Press) and Darin Croft’s Horned Armadillos and Rafting Monkeys: the Fascinating Fossil Mammals of South America (2016, Indiana University Press). I am especially excited about the last of those listed titles. All I will say for now is that… hell yes, it does deliver! \nFor other recent Tet Zoo book reviews, see...",

The newspaper reports many of the comments came from a link from a pro-Trump Reddit forum.\nSeattle-based Amazon removed some reviews from users it couldn't verify had purchased the book.\nCompany spokeswoman Angie Newman says in a statement that \"Amazon Customer Reviews must be product reviews and are designed to help customers make purchase decisions.\"\nKelly and Republican President-elect Donald Trump had a contentious relationship during the campaign.\nPublisher HarperCollins tells the Times it alerted Amazon to the reviews.",

The newspaper reports many of the comments came from a link from a pro-Trump Reddit forum. \nSeattle-based Amazon removed some reviews from users it couldn't verify had purchased the book. \nCompany spokeswoman Angie Newman says in a statement that \"Amazon Customer Reviews must be product reviews and are designed to help customers make purchase decisions.\" \nKelly and Republican President-elect Donald Trump had a contentious relationship during the campaign. \nPublisher HarperCollins tells the Times it alerted Amazon to the reviews.

      "text": "Dubai , Retail   Staff writer \nAmazon is mulling a bid to acquire the entire site, according to a report \nGlobal online retailer Amazon.com is reportedly in talks to purchase Dubai-based e-commerce platform Souq.com in a deal valued at $1bn, Bloomberg reported on Thursday. \nAmazon is mulling a bid to acquire the entire site, but no final agreement has been reached so far, unnamed sources told Bloomberg . \nIt was previously reported that Souq was seeking a buyer for a 30 per cent stake to support its regional expansion plans. \nSpeaking earlier this month to reporters, Souq co-founder and CEO Ronaldo Mouchawar confirmed that the company had hired investment bank Goldman Sachs to assist in its growth but disclosed few other details. \n“It’s just looking at what other options we have as a company as we grow.” \nThe company had grown 30 to 40 per cent year-on-year across its footprint covering the Gulf countries and Egypt and 50 per cent in Saudi Arabia, he said. \nHowever, Mouchawar suggested a listing was some way off. \n“We’re not there yet, we have work to do.” Mouchawar added. \nAlso read: Souq CEO not worried by $1bn rival Noon.com \nIn February, Souq.com announced it had raised more than Dhs1bn ($275m) in funding from existing investors Tiger Global Management and Naspers, new entrants Standard Chartered Private Equity, World Bank member IFC, Baillie Gifford and several regional and tech-focused financial institutions. \nThe round is believed to have made the company the Middle East’s first unicorn – a start-up company valued at more than $1bn.",

One or two days tops, after which we fully expect the 5.2-inch flagship Android handheld to go back up to $650 or so.\nFirst sold stateside for $700 unlocked , the expert cameraphone currently costs just $581.98 in a “Platinum”, aka silver, coat of paint, $589.19 in “Mineral Black”, or $599.99 if you prefer the “Forest Blue” shade.\nBest Buy has the same three colors on sale for a limited time both on and offline, charging however 600 bucks across the board, with GSM LTE connectivity covered by all authorized American retailers.\nAn evolved version of the underwhelming Xperia X Performance , the Sony Xperia XZ mainly stands out in the photography department, courtesy of a triple image sensing 23MP rear shooter and 13MP wide-angle lens selfie cam.\nBut you have to also commend the phone’s super-sharp Triluminos display, premium metal build with curved glass, water resistance, Snapdragon 820 processor, USB Type-C port, 3.5mm headphone jack, and microSD support.\nStill, it’s hard to recommend this over the unlocked Samsung Galaxy S7 , once again available from Best Buy at $550, free fast wireless charger included.\nThe post Unlocked Sony Xperia XZ available as low as $582 ($118 off) right now on Amazon appeared first on Pocketnow .\n",

      "text": "Amazon.com Inc. is in talks to acquire Dubai-based online retailer Souq.com FZ for about $1 billion in a deal that will give the e-commerce giant a footprint in the high-growth Middle East market, according to people familiar with the matter.\nSeattle-based Amazon is considering a bid for all of the site, which had initially planned to sell a stake of at least 30 percent, the people said, asking not to be identified as the information is private. No final agreements have been reached and negotiations could still falter, the people said.\nA spokesman for Souq.com declined to comment. A representative for Amazon didn’t respond to calls and an e-mail seeking comment.\nSouq.com appointed Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to find buyers for a share of the company, people familiar with the matter said in September. The company’s existing investors -- Tiger Global Management and South Africa’s Naspers Ltd. -- were also weighing selling their holdings, the people had said.\nSouq.com sells more than 1.5 million products online to customers in the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Saudi Arabia, according to its website. The company secured $275 million from investors after Tiger Global and Naspers, among others, boosted their investments in February. Chief Executive Officer Ronaldo Mouchawar said in an interview at the time that the company would be open to selling shares to the public in the future.",

(Photo by Victoria Will/Invision/AP, File) \nSEATTLE (AP) — Amazon has suppressed a number of negative reviews of Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly's new memoir. \nThe Los Angeles Times reports more than 100 negative reviews of Kelly's \"Settle For More\" appeared on the online retail giant's site within hours of its release Nov. 15. The newspaper reports many of the comments came from a link from a pro-Trump Reddit forum. \nSeattle-based Amazon removed some reviews from users it couldn't verify had purchased the book. \nCompany spokeswoman Angie Newman says in a statement that \"Amazon Customer Reviews must be product reviews and are designed to help customers make purchase decisions.\" \nKelly and Republican President-elect Donald Trump had a contentious relationship during the campaign. \nPublisher HarperCollins tells the Times it alerted Amazon to the reviews.

      "text": "Sender E-mail Crucial MX300 (Source: Amazon) Want to write and access your data faster. Then look no further than this Crucial MX300 Internal Solid State Drive. It is fast, reliable and comes in 275Gb all the way up to 2TB of storage. Solid State Drives write and access data much faster than traditional hard drives. The problem has been the cost comparison to hard drives. It is a fact that hard drives (HDs) are much less expensive than solid state drive (SSDs). However, the benefits of SSDs for outweigh the cost. Photo Source: Amazon The Crucial MX300 is rated at over 90X more energy efficient than a traditional hard drive. What does that mean? Well, because of its energy efficient technology, the MX300 uses 0.075W of power compared to the 6.8W of power used by a standard hard drive. This reduction in power consumption directly results in longer battery life. Your system also remains cooler due to Crucial’s Adaptive Thermal Protection technology. Why is that important? The Crucial MX300 has fast read speeds of up to 530 MB/s and write speeds up to 510 MB/s. Your files boot up almost instantly resulting is very short load times. Photo Source: Amazon Adaptive Thermal Protection technology dynamically adjusts storage component activity which is essential to keeping your system cool and minimize the risk of overheating. Security as issue? The MX300 protects your data with AES 256-bit hardware-based encryption, RAN technology and Exclusive Data Defense technology. This drive has an endurance rating of up to 220TB total bytes of written data. What does this mean? Basically, if you wrote 50GB of data per day every day to your SSD, it would take you about 12 years to wear it out. As this technology improves overtime, SSDs will have even better endurance ratings. Usually, the larger the drive, the higher the endurance. The Crucial MX300 comes in five configurations, and is currently on sale today. See Prices below: Crucial MX300 2TB SATA 2.5 Inch Internal Solid State Drive 275GB",

      "text": "The LingLong DingDong is China's version of the Amazon Echo The smart home speaker could help Amazon in Asia too Thursday November 24, 2016 @sophiecharara \nWhen Google wanted to solve its Android Wear problem of voice and services in China, it turned to the homegrown company Mobvoi. With Google blocked and Alexa not yet supporting Chinese, Amazon now has a chance to do the same for the Echo or it could sit this game out and let the DingDong take all those smart home hub sales. \nThe lost-in-translation, rhyming LingLong DingDong A3 isn't to be laughed at. It's a 698 yuan ($118) Echo rival that has just been announced by voice recognition company iFlytek and the big deal Chinese retailer JD.com. So, yes, an Amazon-style success. \nRead this: We're living in the age of voice input so why do I feel silly? \nThe voice controlled gadget shares much of the same features too: playing music and audiobooks, checking news, weather and the internet, controlling smart home gadgets, dealing with your calendar and giving you directions. Right now, there's 10 third party services that work with its voice controls. \nThe A3 comes in Mandarin and Cantonese versions - you can't get both at once - and works with three command phrases. It also understands basic English but this isn't the primary concern what with analysts suggesting China's smart home market could be worth $22.8 billion by 2018. \nWhat's more interesting is that LingLong execs are actively floating the idea of collaborating with Amazon in China. So most likely is that Amazon could sell the Echo with the localised Chinese voice recognition tech and services. Also there's the chance the DingDong could join the club of Alexa-powered smart home devices. \nAvailable in white, black, red and purple, the DingDong A3 isn't an identical cylinder to the Echo - it's circular at the top and square at the bottom. There's also a bigger, metal DingDong A1 for 798 yuan and a Q1 range of colourful, voice controlled Bluetooth speakers.",

Recent Posts About About Jen My passion (and obsession!) for travel deals and points started over nine years ago the day I graduated college and took a job in management consulting. I’d spend every Monday through Thursday hotel hoping and embarking on long plane rides just to earn the extra points and miles. Since I was traveling all the time I decided that I was really going to take advantage of the points and miles game...

      "text": "The LingLong DingDong is China's version of the Amazon Echo The smart home speaker could help Amazon in Asia too   \nWhen Google wanted to solve its Android Wear problem of voice and services in China, it turned to the homegrown company Mobvoi. With Google blocked and Alexa not yet supporting Chinese, Amazon now has a chance to do the same for the Echo or it could sit this game out and let the DingDong take all those smart home hub sales. \nThe lost-in-translation, rhyming LingLong DingDong A3 isn't to be laughed at. It's a 698 yuan ($118) Echo rival that has just been announced by voice recognition company iFlytek and the big deal Chinese retailer JD.com. So, yes, an Amazon-style success. \nRead this: We're living in the age of voice input so why do I feel silly? \nThe voice controlled gadget shares much of the same features too: playing music and audiobooks, checking news, weather and the internet, controlling smart home gadgets, dealing with your calendar and giving you directions. Right now, there's 10 third party services that work with its voice controls. \nThe A3 comes in Mandarin and Cantonese versions - you can't get both at once - and works with three command phrases. It also understands basic English but this isn't the primary concern what with analysts suggesting China's smart home market could be worth $22.8 billion by 2018. \nWhat's more interesting is that LingLong execs are actively floating the idea of collaborating with Amazon in China. So most likely is that Amazon could sell the Echo with the localised Chinese voice recognition tech and services. Also there's the chance the DingDong could join the club of Alexa-powered smart home devices. \nAvailable in white, black, red and purple, the DingDong A3 isn't an identical cylinder to the Echo - it's circular at the top and square at the bottom. There's also a bigger, metal DingDong A1 for 798 yuan and a Q1 range of colourful, voice controlled Bluetooth speakers.",

      "text": "Spectacular images of an uncontacted tribe in the Amazon have emerged, but conservationists and indigenous populations fear that the villagers are in grave danger. Image credits: Guilherme Gnipper Trevisan/Hutukara \nThe Yanomami tribe are a group of approximately 35,000 indigenous people who live in some 200–250 villages in the Amazon rainforest, close to the border of Venezuela and Brazil. Covering over 9.6 million hectares, the Yanomami territory in Brazil is twice the size of Switzerland. They’re scattered in autonomous groups, many of which remain uncontacted and isolated from modern life to this day. The Moxihatetema, inhabitants of this particular village, have refused contact with outsiders – even other Yanomami communities. Good news… \nThe new airborne pictures depict people in a communal “yano” structure, the round structure you can see here in which they all live. According to National Geographic , the pictures were taken in mid-September by officials from Brazil’s indigenous affairs agency, Fundação Nacional do Índio (FUNAI) on a surveillance flight over the reserve in the run-up to a joint operation with army troops and police agents to clear out thousands of wildcat gold miners. Initially, there was good news emerging with the photos. \n“It’s incredible that they appear to be doing so well,” Guilherme Gnipper, the FUNAI agent who took the photographs, told National Geographic by phone from his home in Boa Vista. “Their gardens are huge, the people appeared to be healthy. But the gold strike is getting closer and closer.” \nVillagers showed no fear of the aircraft, making no effort to hide or attack it. Their isolation is clearly visible in their lack of any industrial goods – they are devoid of even cloth, pots, or machetes. \n“We saw no manufactured products whatsoever,” says Gnipper. “Nothing made of metal. They are living well—in complete isolation. It was like time travel.” Image credits: Guilherme Gnipper Trevisan/Hutukara \nSurvival International, a human rights organisation formed in 1969 that campaigns for the rights of indigenous tribal peoples and uncontacted peoples, opposes the prospect of any contact with the community. They feel that these images show just how successful these populations can be, despite the isolation. Survival’s Director Stephen Corry said: \n“These extraordinary images are further proof of the existence of still more uncontacted tribes. They’re not savages but complex and contemporary societies whose rights must be respected. It’s obvious that they’re perfectly capable of living successfully without the need for outside notions of ‘progress’ and ‘development’.” … and bad news Advertisement \nThe same village had been observed a few years ago, but in a different location. They have moved, and unfortunately, they’ve moved closer than ever to mining operations. This is giving reason for serious concern. \n“I am very concerned about my brothers, the Moxihatetema,” says Davi Kopenawa, a tribal shaman and president of the Hutukara Yanomami Association , which represents the estimated 22,000 Yanomami who live within the boundaries of the Brazilian reserve. “The place where the uncontacted Indians live, fish, hunt and plant must be protected. The whole world must know that they are there in their forest and that the authorities must respect their right to live there,” he said. \nIllegal mining operations of various scales abound in the area, and miners aren’t shy of bullying, beating, or killing locals. As the Independent reports, in 1993, a year after the Yanomami territory was officially recognized, 16 indigenous people, including a baby were killed by miners, and their village was burned to the ground. Image credits: Guilherme Gnipper Trevisan/Hutukara \nAccording to Kopenawa, we may see the same thing happening again. He sais that miners “are like termites – they keep coming back and they don’t leave us in peace”. According to him, groups of prospectors are already discussing a violent raid on the village. “I’m afraid the miners are going to seek out the village and kill everyone,” he told Nat Geo. Mix that with diminishing funds for indigenous protection, and you might end up with a recipe for disaster. \n“Funai closed its field base in this region last year, effectively abandoning the Moxihatetema to their own fate,” Fiona Watson of Survival International told Jonathan Watts at The Guardian. \nThis is why, with these photos, researchers hope to raise more awareness about these populations and the struggles they are facing. Not internal struggles, but threats brought from the exterior. Aside from physical violence, intruders can also bring numerous diseases to locals. \nCorry concludes: \n“All uncontacted tribal peoples face catastrophe unless their land is protected. We’re doing everything we can to secure their land for them, and to give them the chance to determine their own futures.” Advertisement",

      "text": "View photos\nGetty Image\nFox News personality Megyn Kelly has spent the better part of November promoting her new book, Settle for More , on television talk shows covering just about every major channel. Some aspects of this tour — like her on-again-off-again war of words with fellow Fox News-er Bill O’Reilly — haven’t been the most positive thing this side of the election, but they’ve at least somewhat distracted viewers from the orange elephant who’s soon to occupy the White House. Then again, this doesn’t mean that President-elect Donald Trump, or some of his most ardent followers, have forgotten about Kelly’s well known critiques of the Republican nominee.\nAccording to USA Today , Amazon has apparently removed hundreds of one-star reviews from the book’s entry on its website . An official confirmation or statement from the company wasn’t given at the time of publication, but the removal efforts seem genuine considering the number of people who’ve commented on their disappearance in more recent ratings:\nSome commenters picked up on the removal of the negative reviews. “Tim from MD.,” for example, wrote a post titled “Over 120 1 star reviews have been deleted. Are we living in a free country anymore?”\n“Trump is president, but she wrote the book certain Clinton would win,” Tim from MD. wrote. “Now the book and her shows advertisers are getting boycotted. So apparently her attorneys have called to get negative reviews deleted. And they succeeded. I’m shocked.”\nSlate reported on Monday that nearly 76% of the total reviews given for Settle for More were one star. By Wednesday morning, USA Today determined this number had dropped down to around 17%, though additional one-star assessments were coming in — especially since reviewers behind the concerted effort knew about Amazon’s apparent actions against them. As a user named Brianna put it , “I have written many thoughtful reviews as to why this book is horrible! They have all been removed even though I am a reputable Amazon customer/reviewer.”\nMost of the bad reviews were linked by the Los Angeles Times to a pro-Trump forum on Reddit called “The_Donald” and its desire to troll Kelly’s new book:\nThe forum instructed users to trash “Settle for More.” One post said: “Megyn Kelly’s new book on Amazon (link included). It would be a shame if her biased reporting was reflected in the customer reviews!”\nThe Times article Quote: d Tina Andreadis, senior vice president and director of publicity for HarperCollins, who claimed the massive influx of low ratings “[had] the hallmarks of an orchestrated effort to discredit the book and our author Megyn Kelly.” The publisher “brought it to the attention of Amazon.”\nUPDATE: Amazon has issued the following statement — “Amazon Customer Reviews must be product reviews and are designed to help customers make purchase decisions. There are many other forums available across the internet to discuss topics of interest which are not product reviews.”\n(Via USA Today )",

      "text": "Culture Seven Shows, Films to Stream This Thanksgiving Weekend on Netflix, Amazon and Hulu Post-turkey watching could include the highly anticipated \"Gilmore Girls\" reboot, Rocky movies or comedy specials from Michael Che and Patton Oswalt. By Stav Ziv On 11/24/16 at 12:10 PM Close Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life (Official Trailer) \nAh, it’s here: the annual four-day weekend that includes a whole lot of family and copious amounts of food. Whether you’re excited to see your relatives or terrified of the polarized political debates that will be hard to stomach—especially this year—some screen time is likely in order. And if you want to avoid spending hours watching professional and/or college football just as badly as you want to hide from discussions with an uncle about Donald Trump, there are plenty of recently added films and shows on Netflix, Amazon and Hulu to keep you occupied and sane. \nLet out some frustration vicariously through Rocky Balboa’s boxing gloves with five Rocky films and Creed ; escape the real world and opt to see it through the lenses of top photographers with Tales by Light ; or spend six glorious hours with old (fictional) friends from Stars Hollow with Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life . Sign up Sign up to our daily newsletter for up to date global news and features. <p>Your browser does not support iframes.</p> \nHere are some suggestions for streaming this weekend: Rocky and most of the sequels (Amazon, November 1) \nThere are plenty of Rocky movies, including the original and sequels II through V, now available on Amazon for nearly eight hours of viewing. That should be enough for the duration of even the severest of food comas. Tales by Light (Netflix, November 11) \nExit real life and travel all over the world without leaving your couch to see people, nature and animals from the perspective of top world photographers. Scott & Bailey : Season 5 (Hulu, November 15) \nThe most recent, and reportedly the last, season of this British detective show has joined the previous four on Hulu. It follows two female detectives, Janet Scott (Lesley Sharp) and Rachel Bailey (Suranne Jones), who work for the Syndicate Nine Major Incident Team of the fictional Manchester Metropolitan Police. Patton Oswalt: Tragedy Plus Comedy Equals Time (Hulu and Amazon, November 17) \nHere’s the first of two standup comedy suggestions for this weekend. Can you really have too much humor two and a half weeks after the presidential election and as you prepare to eat turkey with a side of salty political discourse? (No.) Creed (Amazon, November 19) \nFor those who’ve watched all five Rocky films and still want more, there’s Creed , starring Michael B. Jordan as Adonis Creed, a young boxer who seeks advice and training from retired champion Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone). Stallone was nominated for an Oscar and won a Golden Globe for his reprisal in the Rocky role, among other nominations and wins for both him and Jordan. Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life (Netflix, November 25) \nDuh. Lorelai, Rory and the whole gang are back in this highly anticipated reboot of the Gilmore Girls series, which aired from 2000 to 2007. \nRelated: Why ‘Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life’ will be bingeworthy Michael Che Matters (Netflix, November 25) \nEase the political- and familial-tension hangover with a comedy special from Michael Che coming out on Friday. It’s still political and familial and tense, but at least it comes with laughs. \nRead more from Newsweek.com:",

      "text": "  $50 Amazon Fire tablet has been one of the best bargains for folks looking for a cheap tablet since it launched in 2015. But every now and again you can pick one up for an even better price… and right now is one of those times. \nAmazon is selling the Fire Tablet for just $33.33 as one of its Black Friday week specials. \nThere are also deep discounts on other Amazon tablets, eReaders, media streamers and other devices. \nWhat you get for $33.33 is a tablet with a 7 inch, 1024 x 600 pixel display, a 1.3 GHz quad-core processor, 8GB of storage, a microSD card slot, and tight integration with Amazon’s app, eBook, music, and movie ecosystems. It also supports Amazon’s Alexa voice service. \nWhile the entry-level price gets you a version with “special offers,” or ads on the lock screen, you can pay extra to disable them. You can also pay extra for a model with 16GB of storage. \nThe tablet runs a highly customized version of Google Android and it doesn’t support the Google Play Store out of the box. But people have been finding ways to hack Amazon’s Fire tablet since it first launched last year, and you can find some of the latest tips and tricks in the 2016 edition of Liliputing’s Hacking the Fire tablet roundup . \nOr you could just buy B&N’s new $50 NOOK tablet . It already has the Play Store enabled. \nHere are some other deals Amazon is offering on its own devices starting today: \nFire tablets",

      "text": "  @12:02PM from the fixing-things dept. Amazon is making good on its promise to ban \"incentivized\" reviews from its website, according to a new analysis of over 32,000 products and around 65 million reviews. From a TechCrunch article: The ban was meant to address the growing problem of less trustworthy reviews that had been plaguing the retailerâ(TM)s site, leading to products with higher ratings than they would otherwise deserve. Incentivized reviews are those where the vendor offers free or discounted products to reviewers, in exchange for recipients writing their \"honest opinion\" of the item in an Amazon review. However, data has shown that these reviewers tend to write more positive reviews overall , with products earning an average of 4.74 stars out of five, compared with an average rating of 4.36 for non-incentivized reviews. Over time, these reviews proliferated on Amazon, and damaged consumers' trust in the review system as a whole. And that can impact consumers' purchase decisions.",

It sounds like they didn't know how to properly use this tool. You are supposed to reset it for each time you measure. $10.99 for a digital caliper is a steal.\n\nFree shipping with Amazon Prime or an order of $49 or more, as usual.\n\nProduct: Vastar 6\"Electronic Digital Caliper with LCD Screen [ amazon.com ] \n",

      "title": "Amazon Offers Black Friday Discounts on PS4 Slim and Xbox One S",
      "text": "The popular online retailer Amazon offers different Black Friday deals on Sony’s PlayStation 4 Slim, Microsoft’s Xbox One S, gaming accessories, and more. Holiday shopping is officially underway, and it’s safe to say that there are plenty of gaming fans out in the marketplace right now looking for the best Black Friday video game deals that won’t break the bank. Thankfully, for those of us currently in need of a brand new PlayStation 4 Slim or Xbox One S, the online retailer Amazon is offering discounts on both the Sony and Microsoft console to help consumers save money for Black Friday 2016.\nNot only is Amazon offering Black Friday discounts on the aforementioned consoles, but also new video game releases, PC hardware, and gaming accessories have been included in the online retailer’s plethora of price reductions for this year’s shopping event.\nOf course, with Amazon putting forth so many deals to sift through, it might be difficult for consumers to find some of the better sales that went live this morning. With this being the case, shoppers can get a solid idea of the best price cuts from the online retail giant in the list of items found below. However, it’s important to note that some of these offers won’t be too different from other outlets like Target or Walmart’s discounts , but Amazon Prime members’ free shipping option will certainly be beneficial.\n\nHARDWARE PlayStation 4 Slim bundle with Uncharted 4 A Thief’s End is listed at $249.99 . Get $50 off all Xbox One bundles, such as the 1 TB Xbox One S with Gears of War 4 for $299.99 . DualShock 4 controllers are selling for $39.00 . Xbox wireless controllers have been discounted by 20% . SOFTWARE Gears of War 4 is priced at $34.99 . ReCore is priced at $19.99 . The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim Special Edition is priced at $32.39 . Sid Meier’s Civilization 6 is priced at $50.39 . Tales from the Borderlands is priced at $14.79 for all five episodes on disc . ACCESSORIES Get $100 off the Astro A50 Xbox One Wireless Headphones Halo Edition . Turtle Beach Stealth 520 wireless gaming headset for PS3 and PS4 has been discounted to $100.06 . The Razer Naga Chroma Mouse is $20 cheaper at $59.99 . \nWhile Amazon’s choices for Black Friday are definitely enticing, there are obviously plenty of other avenues out there when it comes to shopping. One example out of many is the American retailer Kohl’s own Xbox One and PS4 deals with significant discounts on the PlayStation 4 Slim and Xbox One S.\nBeyond Sony and Microsoft’s more condensed versions of its respective consoles, the former company also has a more powerful version of its current generation system with the PlayStation 4 Pro . Although Amazon isn’t running a deal on the more potent console, fans looking to upgrade should wait until eBay’s Cyber Monday deal where it will bundle PlayStation 4 Pro with Watch Dogs 2 and Street Fighter 5 for $399.99.\nOf course, there could be gaming fans out there who are pleased with their primary system of choice despite Amazon’s solid deals on the PS4 Slim and Xbox One S, and they are just looking for other online sales. For those in that camp, companies like Sony have announced its own digital deals. As a matter of fact, the tech firm promoted Black Friday sales for its PlayStation Store with a rather weird ad just recently, and there are likely going to be plenty more strange commercials to come as it gets closer to the other holidays.\nAmazon ‘s Black Friday 2016 sales are going on now.\nSource: Polygon \n",
