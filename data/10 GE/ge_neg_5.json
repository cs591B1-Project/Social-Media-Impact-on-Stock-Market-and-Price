      "text": "When companies talk about digitizing business, they are often referring to intellectual processes — making them more efficient through collecting, organizing and disseminating information digitally. They don’t mean taking physical assets and actually making them digital. But digital twin technology offers companies a way to conceptually do just that — some experts say the industry is just beginning to discover the business value of virtualized machines.\nDimitri Volkmann , Digital Twin thought leader at GE Digital, said that digital twin technology is ripe for democratization. He spoke to Jeff Frick ( @JeffFrick ), host of theCUBE*, from the SiliconANGLE Media team, during the GE Minds + Machines event, noting the distinction in digital twin roles. First, there are the digital twin builders who need great expertise in the ins and outs of the asset in question. Then there are digital twin consumers, which would include the end users.\n“As a developer, if I want to do a nice app to optimize the usage of my […] engine in my business, I don’t need to be an expert on spark plugs,”Volkmann said. It’s his desire to open the digital twin world to a broader demographic to allow for experimentation.\n“We’re in the process of releasing a toolkit if you want, so that anybody can build a digital twin on our platform and they don’t necessarily need to be GE assets,” he said. Using the models and their intelligence, he said that users can find ways to reinvent their businesses.\nBest use case scenarios Volkman believes one of the most groundbreaking uses of twins will be in their feedback loops with the asset.\n“A human will make the final decision,” he said, but operations can be piloted by the twin, because it works two ways. “It uses data but can also receive information and act on the machine,” he explained.\n*Disclosure: GE and other companies sponsor some GE Minds + Machines segments on SiliconANGLE Media’s theCUBE. Neither GE nor other sponsors have editorial control over content on theCUBE or SiliconANGLE. \nWatch the complete video interview below, and be sure to check out more of SiliconANGLE and theCUBE’s coverage of GE Minds + Machines .\nPhoto by SiliconANGLE ",

So, this is a guy that's a competitor. He wants to win. I always found him in one on one sessions to be a listener and a guy that wanted to do good work.\"\nStay abreast of the latest developments from nation's capital and beyond with curated News Alerts from the Washington Examiner news desk and delivered to your inbox.\n  Washington Examiner News Alerts.   alert soon! Speaking on with Carl Quintanilla on CNBC's \"Squawk Alley,\" Immelt talked up Trump's trade plans and role as the nation's chief negotiator.\n\"I've traveled the world, Carl, for 35 years. People care about safety. They care about growth. If the president of the United States travels around the world and has nothing to offer from a standpoint of economic connection, you lose half of your negotiating power. This guy is a negotiator, a deal maker,\" said Immelt, hopeful Trump can spark better trade.\n\"What President Trump will learn is that as he travels the world, trade deals give him power. The ability to trade as an economic, let's say, negotiating technique, makes him more powerful,\" added Immelt.\n  \nAlso from the Washington Examiner Trump win makes lame duck even lamer Republicans are eager to end the 114th session so they can get to work on the 115th Congress.\nBy Susan Ferrechio • 11/19/16 12:01 AM Top  ",

Essentially a big satellite dish sitting atop a power source, ADS is a directed-energy weapon that fires microwave beams that excite water molecules in a target's skin. This creates a sensation of intense heat (without causing any actual damage) that causes the target to instinctively flee the source in panic. And as it turns out, Raytheon has not been resting on its laurels since inventing ADS. Instead, it's refined and advanced the use of microwaves to tackle a new target:\nDrones.\nContinue reading ",

      "text": "SOURCE EcoWatch TAGS GE crops GMOs pesticides superweeds U.S. Court of Appeals The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit issued its decisions Friday on whether federal and Hawai’i state laws preempt Hawai’i counties’ authority to regulate genetically engineered (GE) crops and pesticide use. Of significance to state and local communities throughout the U.S., the Ninth Circuit ruled that federal law—specifically, the Plant Protection Act—does not prohibit states and counties from passing local laws to regulate and ban commercially-grown GE crops.\n“Today’s decision to allow states and counties to ban or regulate GE crops is an important victory for GE-free seed sanctuaries and small communities and farmers around the country,” George Kimbrell, senior attorney for the Center for Food Safety , said.\nIn granting its decision the court recognized potential harm to farmers and environment from the widespread planting of GE crops, asserting, “the cultivation and testing of GE plants raise several well-documented concerns.” Notably, the court affirmed, “transgenic contamination has previously caused significant economic impacts on farmers of conventional, non-GE crops.” The court acknowledged as well that “the cultivation of GE crops also may raise environmental concerns, such as harm to beneficial plants and animals caused by the increased use of pesticides sometimes associated with testing and growing GE crops, the proliferation of ‘ superweeds ‘ and other pests resistant to pesticides, and the reduction of biodiversity.” The court went on to declare: “The regulation of commercialized crops, both of GE and traditional varieties, remains within the authority of state and local governments.”\nAt the same time, however, the court ruled that under Hawai’i law, counties and municipalities do not have the authority to regulate GE crops (as some in other states do), and that Hawai’i state law places such authority in the hands of the State alone.\n“We’re disappointed that the court misinterpreted Hawai’i law and concluded the Hawai’i legislature decided Hawai’i counties lack any such authority,” Earthjustice attorney Paul Achitoff said. “The legislature did not, and the decision leaves Hawai’i unprotected from the harms the Ninth Circuit acknowledged. We believe that when Hawai’i’s state courts have an opportunity, they will reject the Ninth Circuit’s conclusion on this point and allow Hawai’i’s people to protect themselves, since the State certainly hasn’t protected them.”\nThe court also ruled that the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) alone has the authority to regulate field trials and experimental GE crops; neither states nor local governments can ban or approve. This is particularly troubling to communities in Hawai’i, since the many field trials and associated pesticide use in Hawai’i pose significant risks to local citizens and the environment\n“We are extremely disappointed with the ruling that some experimental GE field trials can only be regulated by USDA, and are considering all legal options. Most importantly, we continue to stand and fight with the people of Hawaiʻi against these chemical companies,” Kimbrell said.\nAttorneys with Center for Food Safety and Earthjustice, who represented local residents, conservation groups, and Hawai’i County in the proceedings, are analyzing the full scope of the court’s decisions and will be considering options that would protect Hawai’i’s people, farms and the environment.\n“As a mother and a resident of Kekaha, Kauaʻi, I will continue to stand up and protect my family and my community,” said Malia Kahale’ina Chun, a mother, educator and Native Hawaiian cultural practitioner. “It is our responsibility to ensure that our keiki have access to clean air, clean water and to ‘āina that sustains them.”\n ",

      "text": "my sister flew in to FLL from the Caribbean this morning. She has global entry and has come through customs at that airport. She must have had her head in the cloud because she called to tell me that she asked someone where is the luggage area and apparently was shown the wrong way out which was the exit door. Once she rwalized what took place she found someone who called the custom office as well as a Jet blue representative. Her luggage was brought out to her but was told that they will have to make a note of this in their system. She then asked and \"what happens after that\"-the rep said they may just let it go or maybe she will get a letter in the mail. Now she is afraid she is going to lose her Global Entry card. Anyone have any idea what can happen? I told her to take a wait and see what happens approach. ",

      "text": "Press Release Related News \nKaduna State and global corporate giant, General Electric, Thursday, flagged-off a programme to equip 278 health care facilities in Kaduna State. \nThis is the biggest ever refit of the public healthcare infrastructure in the state. \nIt represents the Kaduna State Government’s effort to provide a comprehensive solution to the healthcare challenges in the state, including maternal and infant mortality, communicable illnesses and the problems caused by the growth of chronic conditions like diabetes, heart disease and cancer. \nAt its first health summit held last year, Nasir El-Rufai, governor of the state, announced the determination of the government to the perils that pregnant mothers and infants face. \nHe said it is a priority to improve health outcomes for ordinary people. \nTo achieve these goals, Kaduna State is striving to improve primary healthcare for all people, while at the same time, improving the quality and readiness of health service delivery by ramping up the supply and quality of health professionals. \nUnder the partnership between GE and Kaduna State, 255 primary health centres will be equipped along with 23 general hospitals across the state. The programme also includes a package of training for the healthcare professionals and a three-year maintenance agreement for the equipment. The project will deliver at least one refitted hospital in each of the 255 wards in the state. \nNasir El-Rufai, Governor of Kaduna State, welcomed the flag- off of the partnership with GE. \n“The Kaduna State Government is seeking better health outcomes for its people. This partnership with GE will accelerate the development of our health facilities and equip them to deliver better services. The equipment, technologies and training our state is getting under this partnership will help to improve standards of maternal and infant care, implant safer surgical standards and raise our capacity for disease prevention and infection control.” \nHe added that “As one of the largest states in Nigeria, with a growing population many of whom live in the rural areas, Kaduna is innovating through comprehensive approaches that improve health facilities and equipment, service delivery, clinical protocols and patient referrals. Given its track record, we are delighted to be working with GE in deploying this first-of-a-kind programme.” \nFarid Fezoua, CEO of GE Healthcare Africa, said that “GE applauds the Kaduna State Government for its vision to improve health care for the citizens”. \nKaduna State is putting units of relevant medical technology including ultrasound, heart monitors, neonatal incubators and anaesthesia machines – into the hands of our health workers. Ultrasounds are used to detect a range of conditions. It improves the accuracy of tests conducted on the foetus when pregnant women undertake ante-natal visits and can aid early detection of and referral of pregnancy complications. V-Scan Access assists primary healthcare workers – such as midwives, general practitioners, paramedics and clinical officers – in low-resource settings to provide information to the user during pregnancy assessments. \nThe heart monitoring devices will address cardiovascular screening issues and improve the management of high blood pressure, cholesterol or high blood glucose. GE’s basic cardiac screening device connect hearts to digital ECG, helping clinicians test more patients in less time. \nThe multi-year partnership between Kaduna State and GE will increase access to essential technologies for better maternal and infant care, heart screenings to tackle the rise of cardiovascular illnesses and improved care during surgeries. \nThis combination of new technology, maintenance and training will improve healthcare outcomes in Kaduna State.",

      "text": "  57 AM IST Sign me up, says GE’s Jeffrey Immelt to India GE CEO Jeffrey Immelt on why he thinks the Narendra Modi govt is ‘higher on the say-do ratio’ and how his firm can navigate a world with more protectionism better than others   R. Sukumar Amrit Raj GE went to Silicon Valley because that is where the talent is, not because it wants to hang out with VCs, says chairman and CEO Jeffrey Immelt. New Delhi: General Electric Co. chairman Jeffrey R. Immelt said India is becoming a better place for business—he cited the government’s focus on infrastructure, the potential inherent in the unified goods and services tax that India is moving to, and increasing transparency as reasons for this. \nThe current government is “higher on the say-do ratio”, Immelt, 60, said in an interview on Friday. \nIn 2014, GE opened a first-of-its kind multimodal factory in India (located in Pune, it has manufacturing lines that can switch between a variety of complex products across the various businesses in which the conglomerate operates) and the success of that shows that “manufacturing can happen here and be much bigger for us than what it is today”, Immelt said. \"I think PM Modi has been a good leader. I think you guys decide on your politics, we have got our own challenges in the US. If you look at somebody that is forceful, hardworking, honest and transparent, I would say sign me up\" - GE’s Jeffrey Immelt \nToday, “making things in India is as productive as making things in China”, he added. \nIndia’s big opportunity is to get its “micro—a strong entrepreneurial class” meet the “macro—governance” and he is increasingly seeing that, Immelt said. \nDescribing Prime Minister Narendra Modi as “honest and hardworking”, Immelt said these are qualities that increase his confidence in doing business in India. “I don’t judge policies. It is not up to me to judge policies. But, if you look at somebody that is forceful, hardworking, honest and transparent, I would say sign me up.” \nEdited excerpts from the interview: How do you feel about India right now? \nGood. I think business results are strong. There is a sense of confidence in the country. I think economic growth... higher on the say: do ratio—things that have been talked about are actually happening, things like GST (goods and services tax). So, I feel really good about India. How about the rest of the world—Europe and the US? \nI think we are on a slow growth, volatility, populism, uncertainty... I think that’s just the nature of the world today. Things in the US are a little bit better. Things in the Europe are a little bit better. Things in China are a little bit better. There are points of volatility when oil prices are down and they put strain on places like Nigeria and Brazil. I think there is enough growth out there for GE to accomplish what we need to accomplish. It’s not robust, but it is okay. India is good. With Brexit and the US election, there is clearly an indication that people are not happy with the status quo. The numbers show that their incomes have not gone up since 2008. So, there is a reason for their unhappiness. Do you think this will have a medium-term impact on business in some way? \nThis is on everybody’s mind. Globalization has changed the way world works. Technology has changed the way world works in terms of productivity. If you think about a company like us, in the US context, we are a huge net exporter. We are the second-biggest exporter after Boeing. From the US standpoint, we are doing exactly what our country wants us to do. But, that does not mean that every factory in GE has been a winner. Some have closed, some have grown and that’s the nature of globalization, and at the same time, there is technology, productivity. Our output per employee has grown. So, even while our manufacturing jobs have expanded, our output has expanded more than that. So, those are things that factor into the way people feel. In certain industries in the US, such as coal, steel, the impact that you felt has been huge. Same way in Europe. \"‘GE can navigate a world with more protectionism better than others’\" - Jeffrey Immelt \nI think my job is to run GE, make it productive and to grow it. We have 330,000 employees around the world. We probably take that number and multiply it with 8, if we think about our suppliers. So, we probably have around 2 million people around the world who depend on GE. I will have to think mainly about them. \nI think what every CEO has to understand is that jobs matter. When you are adding jobs, you are a good guy, and when you are taking jobs, you are a bad guy. If you go back 20 years, may be business sometimes lost sight of the fact. It does not mean we don’t have to make tough decisions; we do. But, we have to prepare a sense of context and listen to what people are thinking and saying. In some ways, GE set the trend in terms of globalization and you have been in charge for 15 years, which coincides with the most turbulent period for globalization because people have started to question whether it works. What is that one learning, one piece of wisdom about globalization that you have to share? \nI think resiliency. So, the first thing I would say that I joined GE in 1982. When I first started with GE, in the 1980s, globalization in GE context meant moving factories for the purpose of selling in the US. Seventy-eighty per cent of the revenues were still in the US. Today, at least 70% of the revenues are outside of the US. It is about planning, building local teams and things like that. The first thing is people think about globalization as one moment of time or one idea. I am in my fifth idea for globalization. I still have people talking about outsourcing and that’s the farthest thing in my mind today. Now, resiliency. You have to see countries through cycles. You have to continue to stretch your brain in terms of what the country can be. I first came to India in the 1980s because my predecessor thought that it can be a great consumer market for GE; we used to sell refrigerators in India. That turned out to be a horrible idea. It did not even come close to working. While we were doing it, we discovered that talent here was huge and you could build laboratories here. \"I think what every CEO has to understand is that jobs matter. When you are adding jobs, you are a good guy, and when you are taking jobs, you are a bad guy... may be business sometimes lost sight of the fact\" - \nIn the 1990s, we were trying to build GE Capital in India. It was brutal and horrible. But, we did business process outsourcing as part of GE Capital, which became Genpact. So, it’s amazing. We have made an incredibly successful enterprise in India. Our team here is great and nothing ever worked the way we thought it would work. So, one door would close and another would open. Around 10-15 years ago, we thought China would be the most productive in terms of manufacturing in the world; now, we find making things in India is as productive as making things in China or in other places. We would not have thought about that 10 years ago. \nI think this notion of resiliency, creativity, don’t get too set in terms of way of working and that’s what makes us a great company. You have built a multi-modal facility in Pune. Do you think it is a model that can be replicated widely in the country? \nI do. This is a country that thinks productivity every day. It had to because infrastructure has not been good. Other things have failed. So, you have this inherent DNA for productivity, access to materials and workforce. The challenges remain in infrastructure. How do you export until you get better ports, better roads, etc? But, this can happen here. It can be much bigger than what it is today, for us. Has it become easier to do business here? \nWe opened this facility in Pune in 2014. That has been two years and it is amazing how quickly it is gone. I think the focus on infrastructure, GST, more transparency... step by step, India is becoming a better place for business and more straightforward place for business. It has still got some unique challenges, but the progress has been substantial. This is the country where if the micro ever meets macro or, in other words, strong entrepreneurial class and governance... If the government ever matches the entrepreneurial class in India, there is no stopping this country. I have seen more general progress on macro today than I can remember seeing in days gone by. That’s also the function of leadership. Right? \nI think PM (Narendra) Modi has been a good leader. I think you guys decide on your politics, we have got our own challenges in the US. I think as a world traveller, you admire leaders who are hardworking and honest. I don’t judge policies. It is not up to me to judge policies. But, if you look at somebody that is forceful, hardworking, honest and transparent, I would say sign me up. So, I see that in India today. I see a different pace of governance today. For a business person, that’s all you can ask for. Governments are not put in place to do favours for GE. Their job is to serve the country. The period between 2012 and 2015 was one of rapid technological change. Solar, which was hugely expensive, has now become very inexpensive. Artificial intelligence has become a reality. 3D manufacturing is real. Desktop CNC machines are not being ruled out. Our kids could probably live until 100. How are you taking advantage of that? \nFirst thing that I will say, which I say inside my company, is that the change will find you. In other words, no one is safe; no country is safe; no company is safe. So, you have to find your way in the world. When it comes to future technologies, the place where GE wants to play and win is this intersection between the physical world and analytical world and so there are two places where we are placing huge bets today. One is what we call industrial Internet or Internet of Things (IoT) right—a massive bet because we believe that our foundational asset is a huge strength and that we can recruit talent to do the analytics on the software side. \"The first thing is people think about globalization as one moment of time or one idea. I am in my fifth idea for globalization. I still have people talking about outsourcing and that’s the farthest thing in my mind today\" - \nAnd the other place is manufacturing, because we have a kind of a generational strength in material science and we can add to that the laser technology, the systems integration, the part design to do manufacturing. So, when I say what’s the GE technical spot of ownership in the future? It’s at this intersection of the physical and the analytical. We want to be the company that the other people are looking at, not the other way around. How has your whole Silicon Valley experiment worked out? \nThat is what we call industrial Internet; you know we have kind of been focused there for 5-6 years. We have got a business that is about $6-7 billion in revenue. Our aspiration is to be a top 10 software company by 2020. That would basically mean $15 billion of revenue by 2020, so we are halfway there. It wasn’t really about GE trying to think we were Microsoft or something like that. Our vision was that a good industrial company had to own analytical layer around their products and the only way to get there was through software. We went to Silicon Valley because that is where the talent is; not because we want to hang out with VCs or because I wanted to wear a blue jeans, a sweatshirt and a hoodie. You gotta go where the talent is. And you know if you want to build a space, the place to start was California, Silicon Valley and then go to Bangalore and then go to Munich and there are probably 15 cities around the world that you have to be based in if you want to win there. \nSo, when we first planned that in 2010, we couldn’t get A-level talent come to work for GE. They would think you are a lightbulb company, you are something else. Now, we get people from Google, Facebook or Amazon come to work for GE because they like the technology, they are attracted by, in some ways, we are the platform on which they can work on their next-generational skills. And even while you do this, clearly you have not taken your eyes off traditional; this whole Baker Hughes (GE’s deal with Baker Hughes to create the world’s No. 2 oilfield services business)... What’s the logic? Why would you do something like that? \nYou know, we kind of define our business set around high-tech system engineering products in essential industries. So, when you think about essential industries, oil, gas, healthcare, transportation, that’s our set. We had our core oil & gas business and like every business we are in, it has been through cycles. Our aviation business has been through cycles, our healthcare business has been through cycles. Our power business, our renewable business. So, in businesses you like, the downcycle is the moment... \nI always tell people when oil’s at $100/barrel, that’s a bad time to be buying oil & gas companies. When oil’s $40/barrel, that’s a great time. And so, in many ways, Baker Hughes was a great fit for our portfolio. The one piece we didn’t have was oilfield services. We really thought that the combination of oilfield services and analytics was critical; so, for us to drive our industrial platform in oil & gas, we needed what Baker Hughes brought to be successful. We did it in a unique structure mainly because we wanted to do it, we thought it is a good time in the cycle, Baker Hughes wanted to do it and I didn’t want to… we have so many investment opportunities right now, we didn’t want to put all of our capital in just one industry. So, we tried to create a unique structure that would allow for their investors to benefit, for us to get the synergies of an acquisition, but did it in a way that created a public float because we did not want to take all our capital in just oil & gas. \nI think we can manage and navigate the complexity, but the strategic opportunity was too good to pass up. It was the only moment we could do this deal, so the door opened and we went through. If you look at the entire portfolio of things that you do—and you do a lot of things—what are the three things that excite you the most? \nIt’s always hard to answer such questions because they are all like your children, so I love each business for its context. So, let me just take one that I have already talked about—increasing the stack from analytics to add to manufacturing. It’s as big as anything I have ever worked on and I find it to be massively, massively exciting. And it is a horizontal trend... \nIt is, it is a horizontal trend inside the company. Then, you know, there’s always a human element in business and in some ways, the human element of GE always gets brought out more in the healthcare business than in any other. I could go through a variety of different technologies we are working with on our healthcare businesses—from cell therapy to finding ways to serve markets like India or Africa—which are hugely important. If I had to pick a third one, I would have to say it’s taking a big, well-known company and navigating it around the world at a time when everybody hates globalization. I find things like that interesting, challenging, fascinating. And if you were to put yourself in my shoes, we don’t have to be perfect; we only have to be better than everybody else. \nThe world is not perfect today, people don’t like globablization today. So I don’t have to convince everyone that globalization is great. All I have to do is navigate the world better than our competitors and we are confident we can do that. US president-elect Donald Trump has spoken about protectionism, and the majority of your business comes outside of the US. So, in the current scenario, is there going to be a change in strategy when you think about doing your business, especially in the context of India? \nWe have a big footprint in the US and we are a big exporter from the US. In some ways, I think his initial, at least in the speeches and things like that, targets are more people who manufacture things in other places and ship them into the US, car companies and things like that. But we need to see; he’s been president-elect for a week. Long before president-elect Trump, protectionism has been on the rise, in Europe, China, everywhere. We probably very judiciously over the last decade have localized the company, so we have a very local face everywhere. So, we can navigate a world with no trade deals, with more protectionism, we can navigate that better than anyone else because we can make almost anything almost anyplace we want to and I think that’s a big competitive advantage. \nI think we are a good American company. We are exporters, we create a lot of jobs in the US, but we have also earned the right to do business in India and China or other places in the world, and I think to a certain extent, we can do that on our own. \nSee, I believe in trade deals, in NAFTA (North American Free Trade Agreement), in TPP (Trans-Pacific Partnership), but if they all went away, we would be okay, we would be just fine. Our job is to make our strategy fit where the people and governments are going to go. \nWe believe in globalization, we have teams across the world and I’m not going to turn my back on my team in India, or in Mexico, so we are not going to change what we believe in necessarily because elections change. So, we remain committed to India and our Indian team; I’m not going to turn my back on my team in India, I’m not going to run away from everything we have built here in India. I’m not going to treat this team any differently because we have a new president in the US. \"I believe in trade deals, in NAFTA, in TPP... but if they all went away, we would be okay, wewould be just fine. Our job is to make our strategy fit where the people and governments are going to go\" - \nAnd you know why I feel that way? Because it’s un-American! (laughs) In other words, this is what I was taught—Sunday school and things like that. I think he’s a shrewd businessman, what he’s done is amazing and it’s up to us to fit our strategy into the context that he creates for the US. How has your move to Boston been—how do you feel about it? I’m told you have a really nice... \nCrappy little office? (laughs) I have gone backwards in my career, I can tell you that much! (laughs) \nWe had kind of a classic conglomerate compound in the county in Connecticut and it was a nice community and things like that. But I thought it was important for the company to be in a city, to be around ideas, entrepreneurs. So, we moved into what’s called the Seaport—the entrepreneurial part of Boston. We are going to build a new building, but we are in a temporary office and the office is very open. My office was substantially bigger... but now I have this office with glass windows—and people can watch me work, first time in 15 years. It’s horrible because I can’t sleep at my desk or anything like that! (laughs) \nALSO READ | GE: The 124-year-old software start-up \nBut the advantage is that everything is visual, I can meet with my CFO (chief financial officer) and we can meet openly and we just become faster. It’s given us a chance to reinvent what corporate should. How do we eliminate bureaucracy? How do we become faster and more purposeful as a company? So, I think it’s accomplishing all those things. In India, to set the context, I am sure you have noticed this messy battle that has been going on in a large conglomerate. It is largely the case of succession planning gone wrong, and one of the finest case studies of succession planning is how you got the top job. Can you tell us how it works in your company? \nI think we spend a lot of time around people thinking about people at different jobs. I spend a lot of time on developing talent, succession planning and things like that. I was a product of the system and in some ways, we always try to prepare ourselves for the change of leadership and how it works... Look, I know the Indian context. I have immense admiration for the company that you mentioned and the leaders involved. I think, the most important thing about how we do business is that the company always comes first and nobody is above the company. This is the place where I am a steward. That’s it. I am in a relay race. Somebody handed me the baton. I hand it to somebody else. So, GE is above everything else you do. Have you thought about your successor? \nWe will do it in a different way. There is always a right time to do it. We want to make sure we have a great list of people.",

      "text": "UVa Women's Soccer Falls 2-0 at Georgetown in NCAA Tournament R   UVa Women's Soccer Falls 2-0 at Georgetown in NCAA Tournament Round of 16 Posted: UVa senior Alexis Shaffer \nUVA ATHLETICS MEDIA RELEASE: \nWASHINGTON D.C. – The season came to an end for the Cavaliers on Sunday (Nov. 20) as No. 15 Virginia (15-5-2) fell at No. 5 Georgetown (19-2-3) by a score of 2-0 in the third round of the NCAA Tournament. \nAn own goal and a goal off a free kick proved to be the difference as Virginia out-shot Georgetown 9-to-3 for the match, but the home-standing Hoyas capitalized on the few opportunities allowed to pick up the victory. \n“With weather like this you knew it was going to come down to one or two plays, and at the end there it didn’t happen our way,” said Virginia head coach Steve Swanson. “I’m proud of our team and thought we played a good second half, it just wasn’t enough today. We were playing our best soccer of the year at the end, and that’s why it was disappointing for both teams that you couldn’t really play soccer on a day like today with the wind like it was. \n“Georgetown is a tough team and they finish; they don’t need many chances to convert goals. On a day like this it can be a difference maker and it was today. Credit Georgetown for the way they defended as well. Full marks to them for the way they played, they deserved to win, but I’d have liked to see a game where the weather wasn’t as impactful on both teams as it was today.” \nThe wind wreaked havoc on the game, making it difficult for both teams to find a rhythm offensively. The Cavaliers got the first shot of the match from Betsy Brandon (Littleton, Colo.) in the 16th minute, but it was scooped up by the Hoya keeper without much trouble. \nThe defense for both teams was key, adjusting to the conditions and turning back the few chances each offense could put together. Virginia had the only two shots of the first half as the match was scoreless at the break. \nThe Hoyas took the lead in the 47th minute when an own goal by the Cavaliers put the home team on the board. A short corner by Georgetown led to a service along the end line. A Virginia player attempted to clear the ball, but the clearance attempt by the Cavaliers deflected back and into the net for the Georgetown lead. \nThe Cavaliers got a chance for the equalizer in the 67th minute as Alissa Gorzak (Naperville, Ill.) sliced through the defense, taking the ball down the middle of the Hoya back line and into the box. The freshman fired the shot in front of the keeper, but it hit the post and was cleared as Georgetown maintained the lead. \nThe Hoyas extended the lead in the 77th minute off a free kick from 20 yards out just past the far corner of the box. Rachel Corboz took the free kick, sending the ball over the wall and in to the net for the 2-0 Georgetown lead. \nThe two-goal differential held for the duration as Virginia fell 2-0 to the Hoyas.

      "text": "Beth Comstock, Vice Chair of GE, kicked off Minds + Machines on Tuesday underscoring the speed of the change. The world is moving faster, driving change with the light speed exchange of information creating complex networks of connected machines—and GE will be there to guide this evolution.\n“We’re going to see the same kind of disruption and spontaneous restructuring that digital brought to music, to shopping, to media at an even more fundamental level,” she said.\nGE CEO Jeff Immelt followed , issuing a stark challenge to industry: “We’ve got to reboot productivity.”\nOnly through the merger of the digital and the industrial can we reverse the trend of slumping productivity, which saw minuscule 0.5% growth from 2011-2015.\nThis digital transformation has been going on at GE for the last five years, Immelt explained. It started with the company driving productivity for its own operations, then expanded to driving the transformation for its own customers. Increasingly, GE is bringing it to the world.\nMinds + Machines is an annual showcase for what GE and its partners have learned in the course of their digital transformation. A sell-out crowd of more than 2,700 attendees from 50 countries came to learn how to start realizing the gains of the digital industrial revolution. It’s not just about gathering data and eliminating downtime for machines; the revolution is also about evolving culture, finding new revenue streams, and even creating entirely new markets.\nUltimately, it’s about change.\n“I encourage you to embrace this,” Immelt said. “Because change will find you.”\nIndustry seems to have gotten the message, according to GE Chief Digital Officer and CEO of GE Digital, Bill Ruh.\n“Today, as I talk to customers, it’s clear a digital-industrial movement is underway,” Ruh said. “What everyone wants to now know is the how?” How can companies get started?\nThe advantage that all industrial businesses enjoy, Ruh noted, is they can start transforming their own operations. They can gather data, optimize their machines, and start reducing costs. Once they get experience, they can take digital solutions to their customers and create new markets.\nGE customers offered their own stories on the main stage.\nAhmed Hashmi, the global head of upstream technology at multinational oil and gas company BP, said the biggest lever his industry has for change is digital. The industry has invested heavily in digital over the years, upgrading its seismic capabilities for example, but there’s still a long way to go. For instance only 5% of data coming from BP’s oil platforms is being used towards anything meaningful, he said.\n“That’s the data that’s got hidden value in it; that’s the data we want to get at,” Hasmi said of the remaining 95%.  After seeing what GE was doing, BP started a pilot with GE Digital’s Asset Performance Management (APM)  with an asset in the Gulf of Mexico. Now the company plans to scale it across the company’s portfolio, he said.\nThe lesson for industry? “You have to go after something that’s big,” Hashmi said.\nCatch a replay of the November 15 keynotes here:",

      "text": "World News | Mon Nov 21, 2016 | 6:39am EST Netanyahu hit by conflict of interest allegations over German submarines Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attends the weekly cabinet meeting in Jerusalem November 13, 2016. REUTERS/Ronen Zvulun By Jeffrey Heller | JERUSALEM \nJERUSALEM A deal to buy three German-made submarines has come under public scrutiny in Israel after Israeli media discovered Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's personal lawyer represents the local agent of the German conglomerate set to build the vessels. \nBoth Netanyahu and his attorney, David Shimron, have denied any impropriety, and the shipbuilder, ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems, said it has no contractual connection with the lawyer. \nOpposition legislators have called for a parliamentary inquiry and the Justice Ministry said late on Sunday that the attorney-general is looking into whether there had been any conflict of interest. \nIn a statement, the ministry said evidence collected so far did not warrant opening a criminal investigation by police. \nShimron represents Miki Ganor, an Israeli businessman described by the Kiel-based shipyards as its sales partner. A Shimron spokesman told Army Radio on Monday that the lawyer did not discuss the submarine purchase with Netanyahu and looks after a wide range of Ganor's legal interests. \nThe three submarines, costing about $1.5 billion, are due to replace aging vessels, with delivery only in about another 10 years. Israel currently has a fleet of five German submarines, with a sixth due to go in service around 2018. \nWith the Israeli media largely focused on Shimron and whether his representation of both Netanyahu and Ganor was ethical, the prime minister, now in his fourth term, did not appear to be in any immediate political danger. \nNor has there been any indication that the deal itself, which Netanyahu, 67, defended in public remarks to his cabinet on Sunday, is in any jeopardy. \nThe German-supplied submarines are widely believed to be capable of carrying missiles with nuclear warheads and serve as a second-strike deterrent against Iran, should it ever build atomic weapons. Iran has denied ever seeking nuclear arms and Israel has never acknowledged that it has any of its own. \n\"These are strategic weapons systems that ensure the future, and I tell you, the very existence of the state of Israel for decades to come,\" Netanyahu told the cabinet at its weekly meeting. \n\"Increasing the security and strength of the state of Israel is the only consideration that guided me in acquiring the submarines,\" he said. \nAmos Harel, military affairs commentator for the left-wing Haaretz daily, wrote on Monday that even if Netanyahu and Shimron never discussed the submarine issue, there should have been \"a Great Wall of China\" between the attorney as the prime minister's lawyer and as Ganor's representative. \nFirst elected to Israel's top office two decades ago, Netanyahu has weathered several scandals, including a police investigation and state audits into his family's spending. \nA former defense minister, Moshe Yaalon, who was removed by Netanyahu and is now a political rival, has said that the new submarines are surplus to requirements. \n(Reporting by Jeffrey Heller; editing by Mark Heinrich) Next In World News Suicide bomber kills dozens at Shi'ite mosque in Kabul: police \nKABUL A suicide bomber killed at least 27 people and wounded dozens on Monday in an explosion at a crowded Shi'ite mosque in the Afghan capital Kabul, officials said, the third major attack on minority Shi'ites in the city since July.",

Petillo said “We are experiencing remarkable growth and the need for state of the art facilities. And frankly, the one thing they don’t make more of is land. \n“The proximity and quality of the facilities is something we were unable to resist,’’ Petillo said. \nThe down payment and agreement were signed and paid on Monday and Sacred Heart will own the property as of Dec. 16. \nThe university plans to relocate its College of Education and computer science program to the GE property beginning in 2017. \nSHU plans to use the property as an innovation campus, to expand its new School of Computing , which is focused on computer engineering, computer gaming and cybersecurity, and to develop programs in STEM fields such as health and life sciences, science and technology, university spokewoman Tracy Deer-Mirek said. \nThe university will also move certain elements of its Jack Welch College of Business to the new campus, including its new hospitality management program that will make use of facilities both at the GE site and SHU’s recently acquired Great River Golf Club in Milford.

(AP) — Sacred Heart University has purchased General Electric Co.'s former world headquarters campus in Connecticut for $31.5 million. John Petillo , the president of the Roman Catholic university in Fairfield, says the school is growing rapidly and the 66-acre property was too good to pass up. GE is moving its corporate headquarters to Boston. Sacred Heart says it plans on turning the GE property into an \"innovation campus,\" by moving its School of Computing to the site and developing programs in the health and life sciences and technology fields. The university's education school and business office will also move to the site by early next year. Elements of the Jack Welch College of Business , named after the former GE chief executive, will also move to the property. Long-term plans include performing arts and athletic facilities.

The university's education school and business office will also move to the site by early next year. \nElements of the Jack Welch College of Business, named after the former GE chief executive, will also move to the property. \nLong-term plans include performing arts and athletic facilities.

      "text": "General Electric (GE) Stock Fails to Impress General Electric (GE) stock can't seem to break out much above $30. Natalie Walters Nov21,201612:02PMEST \nNEW YORK ( TheStreet ) -- Shares of General Electric ( GE ) were up slightly in early afternoon trading on Monday, as the stock fails to impress investors, Money Map Press CIS Keith Fitz-Gerald said on Fox Business' \"Varney & Company\" this morning. \n\"You know nobody really knows what GE is anymore. It's a household name, but what is it?\" Fitz-Gerald asked on the show. \nPeople are confused about whether the company is focused on technology, manufacturing, inventory or industrial processing. \"That's I think what's holding it back more than anything. It's a broadly held stock and there's no real impetus to go higher because nobody knows what it is anymore,\" Fitz-Gerald noted. \nMost people invested in a mutual fund probably own a piece of General Electric, noted Fox Business' Stuart Varney. \"Great stock of the 80s and early 90s and then, not so much,\" he added. \n(GE is held in Jim Cramer's charitable trust Action Alerts PLUS. See all of Cramer's holdings with a free trial .) \nSeparately, TheStreet Ratings objectively rated this stock according to its \"risk-adjusted\" total return prospect over a 12-month investment horizon. Not based on the news in any given day, the rating may differ from Jim Cramer's view or that of this articles's author. \nTheStreet Ratings team rates General Electric as a Buy with a ratings score of B. This is driven by a number of strengths, which the team believes should have a greater impact than any weaknesses, and should give investors a better performance opportunity than most stocks the team covers.

      "text": "Tweet Share FAIRFIELD, Conn. (AP) -- Sacred Heart University has purchased General Electric Co.'s former world headquarters campus in Connecticut for $31.5 million. John Petillo, the president of the Roman Catholic university in Fairfield, says the school is growing rapidly and the 66-acre property was too good to pass up. GE is moving its corporate headquarters to Boston. Sacred Heart says it plans on turning the GE property into an \"innovation campus,\" by moving its School of Computing to the site and developing programs in the health and life sciences and technology fields. The university's education school and business office will also move to the site by early next year. Elements of the Jack Welch College of Business, named after the former GE chief executive, will also move to the property. Long-term plans include performing arts and athletic facilities. Reblog",

      "text": "View All Posts \nThe so-called “Trump Bump” was good to General Electric Company (NYSE: GE ) shareholders. In fact, General Electric stock was shaken out of its doldrums and rallied more than 7.8% off its early November lows. But shares appear to have once again hit a technical hurdle in the $31 region, and with GE stock near overbought levels, there appears to be little left in the thank. \nBut hey! There’s always a way to trade stagnating shares like General Electric stock, especially if you know the right options to play. GE Stock: Sentiment and Technicals \nAs with all options trades, its important to review potential drivers and bumps in the road before diving into a new position. Let’s start with a look at the brokerage community. \nAccording to Zacks, sentiment has shifted on General Electric stock in the past two months. In September, GE was sitting on five buy ratings, six holds and no sells. According to the most recent data, however, GE is now facing six buys, four holds and one strong sell rating. Meanwhile, the 12-month consensus price target has fallen from $33.71 in September to its current perch at $32.29. \nWhile there is room for upgrades and target increases, General Electric stock has provided little in the way of drivers for any sort of bullish move. \nClick to Enlarge Options activity, meanwhile, has largely held its ground. The December put/call open interest ratio has ticked higher to 0.77 from its September/October perch at 0.76. \nWhile calls still maintain their grip on GE’s sentiment backdrop, that hold appears to be slipping, especially with resistance in the $31 region gaining traction. \nOverall, Dec. 16 series implieds are pricing in a modest move for General Electric stock, with the shares expected to more about 2.3% ahead of expiration. This places the upper bound at $31.20, with the lower bound at $29.80. 2 Trades for General Electric Stock \nBear Put Spread: With the path of least resistance likely downward at this point, traders might want to consider a GE Dec $29/$30 bear put spread. At last check, this spread was offered at 20 cents, or $20 per pair of contracts. Breakeven lies at $29.80. A maximum profit of 80 cents, or $80 per pair of contracts, is possible if General Electric stock closes at or below $29 when December options expire. \nCall Spread: On the other hand, a breakout above $31 would be a huge move for GE stock. If shares can find the buying power to push past this technical hurdle, it could bring more sideline money to the table. Traders looking to take a risk on a General Electric rally might consider a December $31/$32 call spread. At last check, this spread was offered at 26 cents, or $26 per pair of contracts. Breakeven lies at $31.26. A maximum profit of 74 cents, or $74 per pair of contracts, is possible if General Electric stock closes at or above $32 when December options expire. \nAs of this writing, Joseph Hargett did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities. \nArticle printed from InvestorPlace Media, http://investorplace.com/2016/11/will-general-electric-ge-stock-extend-trump-bump-rally/. \n©2016 InvestorPlace Media, LLC",

      "title": "GE lines up $31.5M deal to sell its Fairfield campus to Sacred Heart University",
      "text": " Google+\nGE has sold its previous headquarters in Fairfield, Conn.\nBy Jon Chesto Globe Staff November 21, 2016\nGeneral Electric Co. didn’t need to go far to find a buyer for the nearly 67-acre Fairfield campus that served as its headquarters since 1974. In fact, the company didn’t need to leave the neighborhood.\nGE has inked a deal with Sacred Heart University, located across Route 59 in Fairfield, to sell the property for $31.5 million. The site includes two office buildings totaling about 500,000 square feet, 800 parking spaces, a 28-room hotel, and a helicopter landing pad. Sacred Heart is expected to complete its purchase by the end of the year.\nAdvertisement\nGE put the property on the market after deciding in January that it would relocate its corporate office to Boston. At the time, 800 people worked at the headquarters.\nAbout 150 GE employees made the move to a temporary office in Boston’s Fort Point section over the summer. Most of the others transferred to an office in Norwalk, through a series of moves that wrapped up in October.\nGet Business Headlines in your inbox: The Globe's latest business headlines delivered every morning, Monday through Friday. Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here Bishop said more than 25 interested buyers toured the campus after it was put on the market in June. The company didn’t set a sale price.\n“We just wanted to see what the market would accept, knowing it was a very unique ... type of property,” Bishop said. “We’re quite pleased with both the price and the speed in which it sold.”\nIn a statement, Sacred Heart officials said they planned to use the property as “an innovation campus,” to expand its computing school and to develop programs in science- and math-oriented fields such as health, life sciences and technology.\nAdvertisement\nThe university has longstanding ties with GE; its business college is named after former CEO Jack Welch. Elements of the business school will move to the former GE campus, including its hospitality management program. The university will also move its college of education, art and design program, and its business office to the site. The school said its long-term plans could include a performing arts facility and a swimming pool.\nIn total, the purchase will bring Sacred Heart’s campus to nearly 200 acres in size, not including the Great River Golf Club in Milford, Conn., that the university bought last year.\nKleban Properties, a real estate developer and manager based in Fairfield, had publicly discussed working with Fairfield University to make a bid for the GE property. A spokeswoman for Kleban declined to comment on Monday, citing the terms of a non-disclosure agreement.\nMeanwhile, GE is moving ahead with plans for a $200 million headquarters project in Fort Point, a few blocks away from its temporary offices. GE will acquire land from Procter & Gamble’s Gillette campus, a deal that’s expected to close by the end of the year. The 2.4-acre campus will include two older brick buildings that will be renovated for GE’s use and owned by state agency MassDevelopment, as well as a new 12-story structure that will be owned by GE. Together, the three buildings will total about 390,000 square feet.\nThe Baker administration has promised to contribute as much as $125 million in state grant funds to the acquisition and development of the GE campus.\nJon Chesto can be reached at jon.chesto@globe.com .

      "text": "General Electric Co. on Monday said it sold its former global headquarters in Fairfield, Conn., to Sacred Heart University for $31.5 million.\nThe move allows Sacred Heart, a Roman Catholic school with about 8,500 students, to expand, but it will result in significantly lower tax revenue for the Connecticut town, where GE opened its suburban office park in 1974.\nGE, citing Connecticut's rising taxes, said in January that it would move to Boston. It said it was pleased to sell its campus, which spans more than 60 acres, to Sacred Heart, calling it \"a world-class local university.\"\nSacred Heart's existing campus isn't far from the old GE site, and the university's president, John Petillo, said the purchase lined up with its expansion plans.\n\"It's literally walking distance from our campus,\" he said. \"We've had tremendous growth in the last five years. And the one thing they don't make more of is land.\"\nMr. Petillo said the university would keep and refurbish the old GE buildings. Sacred Heart can add about 450 students and up to 60 jobs over the next four years with the new space.\nThe university plans on expanding its new computing school, which it opened this year, at the site. It will also move part of its Jack Welch College of Business, named after GE's former chief executive, there as well.\nThe deal is a mixed bag for Fairfield, said Michael Tetreau, the town's first selectman.\nGE paid the town $1.6 million a year in property taxes on an assessed value of about $80 million, Mr. Tetreau said. The town stands to lose most of that, he said, because as an educational institution Sacred Heart won't have to pay property taxes.\nHe estimated that Connecticut would reimburse Fairfield for about $400,000 in lost property taxes.\n\"On the one hand, I see the benefits to Sacred Heart for their future growth and expansion, and that's a good thing for our community,\" Mr. Tetreau said. \"On the other hand, from a pure financial standpoint, we are losing over $1 million in tax revenue, and that causes serious concerns going forward.\"\nMr. Tetreau said Fairfield would likely have to attract new business, cut spending and raise property taxes to offset the loss.\nMr. Petillo said Sacred Heart paid the current market rate for the property. The university's expansion will drive new business to the town, expanding economic growth there, he added.\nWrite to Joseph De Avila at joseph.deavila@wsj.com\nMore from MarketWatch The Task of Securing President-Elect Donald Trump Social Media Companies Tackle Fake News and Abuse Shop Like a Holiday Bot",

(AP) — Sacred Heart University has purchased General Electric Co.'s former world headquarters campus in Connecticut for $31.5 million. \nJohn Petillo, the president of the Roman Catholic university in Fairfield, says the school is growing rapidly and the 66-acre property was too good to pass up. \nGE is moving its corporate headquarters to Boston. \nSacred Heart plans on turning the GE property into an \"innovation campus,\" by moving its School of Computing to the site and developing programs in the health and life sciences and technology fields. The university's education school and business office will also move to the site by early next year. \nElements of the Jack Welch College of Business, named after the former GE chief executive, will also move to the property. \nLong-term plans include performing arts and athletic facilities.

(AP) — Sacred Heart University has purchased General Electric Co.'s former world headquarters campus in Connecticut for $31.5 million. John Petillo , the president of the Roman Catholic university in Fairfield, says the school is growing rapidly and the 66-acre property was too good to pass up. GE is moving its corporate headquarters to Boston. Sacred Heart says it plans on turning the GE property into an \"innovation campus,\" by moving its School of Computing to the site and developing programs in the health and life sciences and technology fields. The university's education school and business office will also move to the site by early next year. Elements of the Jack Welch College of Business , named after the former GE chief executive, will also move to the property. Long-term plans include performing arts and athletic facilities.

      "text": "Exelon is GE's latest marquee customer for Predix , the company's analytics system for powering the industrial Internet. Exelon has installed Predix at each of its electricity generating facilities, supporting a wide variety of equipment, and will rely on the software to supply it with machine learning for its facilities' future operations.\nExelon is one of the largest electricity suppliers in the US and the largest so far to adopt the Predix analytics system. It's planning to use Predix to collect data on nuclear, coal-fired, natural gas and hydroelectric generating plants, as well as wind-turbine farms, said Brian Hoff, director of corporate innovation at the firm, in an interview with InformationWeek.\nAs the largest operator of nuclear power plants in the country, the firm generates a total of 32,700 megawatts of power through all its sources; 59% of the total comes from nuclear facilities. They include 23 nuclear reactors at 14 different sites.\n\"All the operational data goes directly into Predix,\" said Hoff, along with six years of pre-existing data on the nuclear power plants. Exelon's generating equipment was already instrumented and has been generating data on its operations. By collecting all the data in the GE hosted Predix cloud -- instead of spread across many systems -- it can be brought together for analysis and machine learning. Machine learning accumulates repetitive data from machine operations to establish a norm, then detects conditions that give rise to anomalies signaling operational trouble or potential failures.\nGE model of nuclear, coal-fired, wind turbine power plants at Minds & Machines 2016 in San Francisco. Source: Charles Babcock.\nExelon was an early adopter of Predix on an experimental basis and has accumulated a year's worth of wind farm data the system. But Exelon appeared at GE's annual Minds & Machines event in San Francisco last week to declare that it's all-in with Predix for all types of generating equipment. It will take two more years to get \"the entire fleet (of generation units) up and running\" and feeding data into Predix systems, Hoff predicted in the interview.\n[Want to see how machine learning restored a power plant to operations? Read GE Uses Machine Learning To Restore Italian Power Plant. ]\nIn doing so, Exelon's first goal is to implement better performance management of its generating plants. The longer range goal is to better assess the state of the equipment and maintain it in such a way as to prevent unscheduled outages, Hoff said.\n\"We want to improve equipment reliability,\" he noted. And Exelon believes it can do so by improving the collaboration between its existing, physical plant monitoring stations and the data analyzed by Predix. Generating turbines and related equipment usually produce vibrations and temperature variations that show up as anomalies in the operating data long before the equipment actually fails, he noted.\nIn addition, the Predix system has access to data on turbines run by Exelon as well as many other GE customers, said Hoff. Conditions that preceded failures at other customer sites can be isolated and used as alerts for operators in Exelon facilities.\nIt's not a matter of spotting one potential, isolated failure, Hoff continued. \"It's more a process of continuous learning. We can look across the entire fleet, plus GE can ask whether a condition is normal or not\" across its entire customer base, he said.\nIn addition, the use of Predix brings the analytics closer to real time as opposed to taking detailed looks at historical data. Algorithms are run against the data flow as it comes into Predix, giving those responsible for operations the alerts and information they need to avert slowdowns and outages.\nCharles Babcock is an editor-at-large for InformationWeek and author of Management Strategies for the Cloud Revolution, a McGraw-Hill book.

      "text": "Sacred Heart amps up its future with GE property buy 1 / 11 Back to Gallery \nFAIRFIELD — Some may have been surprised by Sacred Heart University ’s sudden acquisition of the former General Electric world headquarters a mile away. \nNot James Henderson , 20, of Norwalk. \n“They are really making a name for themselves,” Henderson said, still sporting the suit and tie from an internship interview as he worked to finish off a project on his laptop. \nSacred Heart, which bought the GE property Monday for $31.5 million, has been evolving ever since Henderson stepped foot on campus, the accounting major pointed out. The second floor balcony of the Martire Business & Communications Center where he worked was a mere construction site when he arrived on campus as a freshman. \nNow a junior, Henderson deemed Sacred Heart smart to seize an opportunity that will help its footprint and reputation grow. \nJ. Craig Goebel , a higher education consultant from Baltimore whose firm works to help colleges develop strategic initiatives, thinks Henderson may be right. More Information \nSecond largest Catholic university in New England \nEnrollment: 8,532 students, including 4,794 full time undergraduates, 634 part-time students and 3,104 graduate students. \nWhere are they from: While most students come from the tri-state area and Massachusetts, all 50 states and 34 countries are now represented among the student body. \nNo longer a commuter school: 90 percent of freshmen live on campus. \nSource: Sacred Heart University \n“For a lot of institutions, in an age of decreased revenues and challenging demographics, growth is one of the best strategies to fulfill its mission,” said Goebel, a principal at Art & Science, a group that works with colleges across the country. \nTo stay ahead of the game, Goebel said colleges have to stay attractive, cutting edge and be what students are looking for. \n“Sacred Heart has been growing their enrollment over the years, so it could very well make sense for them,” Goebel said. \nFew, however, saw this kind of growth coming. Not even Sacred Heart officials. \n“At the time that we created our current five-year plan, which runs through 2017, we never would have dreamed that GE would leave its corporate headquarters,” said Deborah Noack , a university spokeswoman. \nThe plan did call for new construction and increasing academic distinctiveness at what is now billed as the second largest Catholic university in the Northeast. \nEnda McGovern , an associate professor of marketing and president of Sacred Heart’s faculty senate, said he anticipated that growth would mean sacrificing precious parking spaces on the land-locked campus. \nSacred Heart has already acquired every bit of real estate surrounding its campus on Park Avenue in Fairfield. \nGrabbing the GE site, McGovern said, is not only a bold move, but fits right into the university’s DNA. \nNot only is the GE campus well-equipped, it will provide a “corporate” feel for students. \nThe acquisition is expected to provide traction not only to the Welch College of Business —named after the former GE chairman — but others as well. \nThe plan is to begin relocating some programs now in Trumbull to the GE campus in 2017. \n“(It) will certainly mean that the theater major will continue its expansion,” said Jerry Goehring , director of the SHU theater arts program. “The performing arts department will have the chance to create new paths toward excellence in dance, voice and instrumental.” \nCarrie Leach , 21, a senior marketing major from New Jersey, called the purchase awesome. \n”Everyone knows GE,” she said. \n“I think it will boost name recognition,” added Anthony Dapice , a junior sports management major from Westchester County, N.Y. \nDapice said his uncle came to Sacred Heart during the 1980s. It was still a commuter college then. \nIts upward trajectory since has been pretty steady; now 90 percent of students live on campus. \nJohn Reilly , a double major in finance and economics from Long Island sees it as increasing the university’s reach. \nTuition could go higher but “some students like a bigger school,” Reilly said. “I think it’s great.” Today's Deals",

      "text": "Sacred Heart University buys GE's former Fairfield headquarters Updated comments + - The university's president says the school is growing rapidly and the property was too good to pass up. (6:41 PM) \nFAIRFIELD - Sacred Heart University in Fairfield announced Monday that it will pay $31.5 million for the former General Electric headquarters property in town. \nThe school says it plans on using the 66-acre campus for engineering, cybersecurity and business programs. It plans on moving its School of Computing to the site and developing programs in the health, life sciences and technology fields. \nLocal leaders say they are worried about the loss of tax dollars, since none of that land will be taxable anymore. The town of Fairfield will lose a million and a half dollars a year in tax money. Video Watch News 12 Connecticut Live Trending Most-Viewed News 12 Connecticut Articles \nFirst Selectman Mike Tetreau says he's meeting with Sacred Heart next week to see if the university can help make up some of that loss. \nHowever, some are excited about the property turning into an innovation center, and say that it could bring new companies and new jobs to town. \n\"I know there's a real concern about tax revenue base, but with that said, we can generate enthusiasm, momentum and at the end of the day, it's going to be great success for our community,” says Republican state Sen. Tony Hwang. \nSacred Heart University's president says the school is growing rapidly and the property was too good to pass up. The school says elements of the Jack Welch College of Business, named after the former GE chief executive, will also move there. \nThe campus had been GE's global headquarters for about 40 years before the company's decision to move to Boston. Most of the 800 workers have already moved out, with the company transferring some of them to other local divisions. ",

      "text": "Related Content View Photo Boeing's logo is seen on its KC-46 Aerial refuelling operator's station demonstrator during Japan Aerospace …\nBy Alwyn Scott\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - Boeing Co (BA.N) on Monday named a senior General Electric Co (GE.N) executive to head its commercial airplanes division and announced a new services unit, in moves to capture more of the profitable market for parts and repairs after a jet is sold.\nThe changes are \"a big and important step\" toward Boeing's goal of increasing annual services revenue to about $50 billion in 10 years from about $15 billion currently, Boeing Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg said on a call with journalists.\nThe changes do not alter plans for developing aircraft, but put a new \"emphasis on generating life-cycle value,\" Muilenburg said, referring to building an aircraft with an eye to gaining revenue from servicing the plane during its decades-long life.\n\n\"We've always said growing services is a core part of our strategy, and now you see us emphasizing and investing accordingly,\" Muilenburg said. \nBoeing tapped Kevin McAllister, 53, to lead its $66 billion commercial airplane business, succeeding Ray Conner, 61, effective immediately. \nConner, who started as a Boeing mechanic nearly 40 years ago, will serve as vice chairman through 2017 to help with the transition, the world's biggest planemaker said. \nMcAllister has been with GE's aviation unit for nearly 30 years and knows Boeing and its customers well, Muilenburg said.\nBoeing named Stanley Deal, 52, to head the new services unit, to be known as Global Services. Deal had been senior vice president of Boeing's Commercial Aviation Services business.\nThe Global Services business is due to begin operating in the third quarter of 2017. \nMcAllister has been chief executive of GE's $8 billion aviation services business, a unit that earns much of its revenue from contracts servicing GE aircraft engines. Airlines generally pay a fee for every hour they run the engines, which covers service and maintenance.\n\"Muilenburg is shaking up BCA with a surprise outside appointment which is likely a healthy move given that fresh leadership eyes can create positive movement,\" said analyst Peter Arment from Baird Equity Research. \nLast year, Muilenburg named Leanne Caret head of the defense business. She had run Boeing's defense services business.\nNow, Muilenburg said, \"the leaders of all three of our business...all have depth of understanding of services.”\nMuilenburg said the new division headed by Deal would combine about 20,000 employees from the customer services groups within the company's existing commercial airplanes and defense, space and security businesses. It will have a small headquarters near Dallas, but most of the work will remain where it is, he added.\nSince Muilenburg took over as CEO in July 2015, Boeing has been steadily building up its services business, moves that have irked some of its partners.\nEarlier this year it ended an agreement with one of its largest suppliers, Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc (SPR.N), effectively taking away manufacturing of profitable spare parts used in aircraft repairs.\nIt also began bringing some parts production in-house to gain control over repairs, and sifting its databases to help airlines predict when planes will need service.\nEngine repairs make up nearly half of the service market, but those are largely beyond the reach of Boeing or Airbus. Engine makers such as GE and Pratt & Whitney (UTX.N) locked up their aftermarket more than a decade ago.\nStill Boeing's aftermarket sales growth is outpacing the 4.5 percent growth of the broad aftermarket, Dennis Floyd, vice president of services strategy and business development at Boeing, told Reuters recently.\n\"That means we're taking market share,\" he said.\n\n(Additional reporting by Ankit Ajmera in Bengaluru; Editing by Andrew Hay and Lisa Shumaker)",

      "title": "GE Stock Has Outperformed the Market Since Earnings, the Trend Continue?",
      "text": "A month has gone by   General Electric ( GE   5.5 % in the past month, outperforming the S&P 500 in that time frame.\nWill the recent positive trend continue leading up to their next earnings release, or is the stock due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.\nRecent Earnings \n \nGE Beats Q3 Earnings, Misses Revenues; 2016 View Narrowed \n\nDespite a challenging macroeconomic environment, sustained restructuring initiatives for a leaner firm with a re-focus on core operations enabled General Electric to report relatively healthy third-quarter 2016 results. GAAP net earnings for the reported quarter were $1,994 million or $0.22 a share compared with $2,506 million or $0.25 a share in the year-ago quarter. Including industrial and other verticals, operating earnings were $0.32 per share and improved 10% year over year. The operating earnings (including industrial and other verticals) for the reported quarter marginally beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by $0.01.\n\nRevenues \n\nTotal consolidated revenue for the reported quarter increased 4% year over year to $29,266 million from $28,028 million in the year-earlier quarter, but missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $29,836 million. While the Industrial segment revenue increased 4% year over year to $27,421 million, GE Capital revenues declined 2% to $2,600 million. Organic revenue growth for the Industrial segment improved 1% for the quarter.\n\nTotal orders for the quarter for the Industrial segment increased 16% year over year to $26.9 billion, with significant order improvements from the Renewable Energy and Energy Connections & Lighting segments, partially offset by considerable declines from Transportation and Oil & Gas. Total backlog of equipment and services at quarter-end was $319 billion, up 18% year over year.\n    \n\nMargins, Balance Sheet and Cash Flow \n\nOwing to a highly volatile environment and sluggish growth across the globe, General Electric recorded a decline in margins in the reported quarter despite stringent cost-cutting and simplification initiatives. Industrial segment operating profit decreased 5% (organic growth down 3%) year over year to $4,320 million, with a significant fall in profits in Energy Connections & Lighting (down 84%), Oil & Gas (down 42%) and Transportation (down 18%), partially offset by a rise in profits in Renewable Energy (up 16%) and Power (up 12%). Gross margin for the Industrial segment improved 150 bps to 29.0%, while non-GAAP operating margin remained flat at 17.3%.  \n\nCash generated from operating industrial activities (excluding dividends) for the first nine months of 2016 totaled $3,368 million. Cash and marketable securities at quarter-end aggregated $98.9 billion.\n\nOutlook Narrowed \n\nGeneral Electric aims to build upon the momentum for a healthy rise in operating profit in the next year and narrowed its earlier guidance. The company anticipates operating earnings in 2016 to be within $1.48-$1.52 a share, compared to its earlier range $1.45-$1.55. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2016 is currently pegged at $1.49 and lies comfortably within the predicted range.\n\nOrganic revenue growth in 2016 is currently expected to be 0-2% compared to earlier projections of 2-4%. General Electric intends to return $30 billion to the shareholders in 2016, including $8 billion in dividends and $22 billion in share repurchases. In addition, the company expects to generate in excess of $32 billion in cash flow from operations in 2016, up from $30-$32 billion expected earlier.\n \n  \nFollowing the release and in the last month, investors have witnessed a downward trend for fresh estimates. In the past month, there has been one revision higher for the current quarter compared to three lower. The consensus estimate has edged lower as a result, and now GE is expected to see earnings shrink by over 11.5% this quarter when compared to the year ago period. \nAs you can see in the chart below, this is starting to take a toll on the outlook, both for this year and the next:\n \nGENL ELECTRIC Price and Consensus GENL ELECTRIC Price and Consensus | GENL ELECTRIC Quote \n \nVGM Scores \nAt this time, General Electric's stock has a poor Growth score of 'F', however its momentum is doing a bit better with a 'C'.   'D'   fourth quintile for this investment strategy. \nOverall, from a fundamental perspective, things aren't looking great for GE investors. As we can see, component scores are pretty weak, while the VGM score for this stock is an 'F'. \nOutlook \nWith estimates broadly trending lower and a weak fundamental position, the days of outperformance for GE may be nearing an end. It's no surprise shares of GE have a Zacks Rank # 4 (sell) and we are expecting a sluggish return from GE in the next few months.",

      "text": "Boeing names GE Exec to lead BCA, creates services division Boeing names GE Exec to lead BCA, creates services division 22 November, 2016 BY: Stephen Trimble Washington DC \nBoeing has replaced Ray Conner as head of Boeing Commercial Airplanes with an outsider from GE Aviation and consolidated separate services businesses for commercial and defence into a single unit with marching orders to triple revenues over the next decade to $50 billion. \nThe sweeping changes announced after markets closed in New York on 21 November establish Boeing’s strategic direction for at least a decade under chairman, president and chief executive Dennis Muilenburg, who succeeded Jim McNerney nearly 16 months ago. \nRay Conner, former chief executive of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, will retire after a five year tenure marked by the troubled entry into service of the 787, relatively smooth production ramp-ups and frequent clashes with union leaders over demands for diminishing contributions to retirement and health care benefits. \nTo replace the 40-year veteran, Muilenburg selected president and chief executive of GE Aviation Services Kevin McAllister, who will be the first CEO of BCA with no experience as a Boeing employee since the position was created in 1965. \nMcAllister will now lead a BCA unit with about 80,000 employees and $66 billion in revenues in 2015.He inherits a business managing a steep ramp-up for single-aisle aircraft, a handful of new products to usher into service and critical decisions remaining on addressing a possible gap in the market between the 737 Max 9 and the 787-8. \nAny new product will bear the stamp of a veteran of GE’s services business, which already consolidates commercial and defence offerings under a single corporate leader. Boeing’s next products will be designed with a focus on how the aircraft will be supported over its entire 20-40-year lifecycle, Muilenburg told reporters in a teleconference call on 21 November. \nAlthough McAllister will not have direct authority over Boeing Global Services, he and Leanne Caret, chief executive of Boeing Defense Space and Security, are expected to work closely with the new operating division that will be led by Boeing veteran Stan Deal, who currently leads BCA’s services division. \nFor more than a year, Boeing has signaled its interest in a dramatic expansion of a services business now sized roughly between $15-18 billion a year in revenues. Boeing’s internal analysis forecast a services market with $2.5 trillion in sales over the next decade, whereas the company’s share of that market is currently 6% for BCA and 9% for BDS. \n“So we have ample room to grow,” Muilenburg says. \nThe growth plan will activate when BGS is established in the third quarter of next year with a headquarters in Dallas, the home of Boeing-owned parts manager Aviall. \nDeal’s task will be to put the company on a trajectory to triple revenues over the 10-year period, Muilenburg says, rising to around $50 billion a year by the end of 2027. The growth will include some acquisitions, Muilenburg says, but the company’s focus is to grow organically as much as possible. Advertising",

      "title": "GE inks $31.5m deal to sell Fairfield campus to Sacred Heart University - The Boston Globe",
      "text": "GE has sold its previous headquarters in Fairfield, Conn. By Jon Chesto Globe Staff November 21, 2016 \nGeneral Electric Co. didn’t need to go far to find a buyer for the nearly 67-acre Fairfield campus that served as its headquarters since 1974. In fact, the company didn’t need to leave the neighborhood. \nGE has inked a deal with Sacred Heart University, located across Route 59 in Fairfield, to sell the property for $31.5 million. The site includes two office buildings totaling about 500,000 square feet, 800 parking spaces, a 28-room hotel, and a helicopter landing pad. Sacred Heart is expected to complete its purchase by the end of the year. Advertisement \nThe company put the property on the market after deciding in January that it would relocate its corporate office to Boston. At the time, 800 people worked at the headquarters. \nAbout 150 GE employees made the move to a temporary office in Boston’s Fort Point section over the summer. Most of the others transferred to an office in Norwalk, through a series of moves that wrapped up in October.

Sign up for more newsletters here \nGE spokeswoman Susan Bishop said more than 25 interested buyers toured the campus after it was put on the market in June. The company didn’t set a sale price. \n“We just wanted to see what the market would accept, knowing it was a very unique ... type of property,” Bishop said. “We’re quite pleased with both the price and the speed in which it sold.” \nIn a statement, Sacred Heart officials said they planned to use the property as “an innovation campus,” to expand its computing school and to develop programs in science- and math-oriented fields. Advertisement \nThe university has longstanding ties with GE; its business college is named after former CEO Jack Welch. Elements of the business school will move to the former GE campus, including its hospitality management program. The university will also move its college of education, art and design program, and its business office to the site. \nKleban Properties, a real estate developer and manager based in Fairfield, had publicly discussed working with Fairfield University to make a bid for the GE property. A spokeswoman for Kleban declined to comment on Monday, citing the terms of a non-disclosure agreement. \nMeanwhile, GE is moving ahead with plans for a $200 million headquarters project in Fort Point, a few blocks away from its temporary offices. GE will acquire land from Procter & Gamble’s Gillette campus, a deal that’s expected to close by the end of the year. The 2.4-acre campus will include two older brick buildings that will be renovated for GE’s use and owned by state agency MassDevelopment, as well as a new 12-story structure that will be owned by GE. Together, the three buildings will total about 390,000 square feet. \nThe Baker administration has promised to contribute as much as $125 million in state grant funds to the acquisition and development of the GE campus.

      "text": "Boeing taps GE exec to head airplanes unit as part of services push Stock Markets 1 hour ago (Nov 21, 2016 08:33PM ET) This article has already been saved in your Saved Items © Reuters. Boeing's logo is seen on its KC-46 Aerial refuelling operator's station demonstrator during Japan Aerospace 2016 air show in Tokyo \nBy Alwyn Scott \nNEW YORK (Reuters) - Boeing Co (N: BA ) on Monday named a senior General Electric Co (N: GE ) executive to head its commercial airplanes division and announced a new services unit, in moves to capture more of the profitable market for parts and repairs after a jet is sold. \nThe changes are \"a big and important step\" toward Boeing's goal of increasing annual services revenue to about $50 billion in 10 years from about $15 billion currently, Boeing Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg said on a call with journalists. \nThe changes do not alter plans for developing aircraft, but put a new \"emphasis on generating life-cycle value,\" Muilenburg said, referring to building an aircraft with an eye to gaining revenue from servicing the plane during its decades-long life. \n\"We've always said growing services is a core part of our strategy, and now you see us emphasizing and investing accordingly,\" Muilenburg said. \nBoeing tapped Kevin McAllister, 53, to lead its $66 billion commercial airplane business, succeeding Ray Conner, 61, effective immediately. \nConner, who started as a Boeing mechanic nearly 40 years ago, will serve as vice chairman through 2017 to help with the transition, the world's biggest planemaker said. \nMcAllister has been with GE's aviation unit for nearly 30 years and knows Boeing and its customers well, Muilenburg said. \nBoeing named Stanley Deal, 52, to head the new services unit, to be known as Global Services. Deal had been senior vice president of Boeing's Commercial Aviation Services business. \nThe Global Services business is due to begin operating in the third quarter of 2017. \nMcAllister has been chief executive of GE's $8 billion aviation services business, a unit that earns much of its revenue from contracts servicing GE aircraft engines. Airlines generally pay a fee for every hour they run the engines, which covers service and maintenance. \n\"Muilenburg is shaking up BCA with a surprise outside appointment which is likely a healthy move given that fresh leadership eyes can create positive movement,\" said analyst Peter Arment from Baird Equity Research. \nLast year, Muilenburg named Leanne Caret head of the defense business. She had run Boeing's defense services business. \nNow, Muilenburg said, \"the leaders of all three of our business...all have depth of understanding of services.” \nMuilenburg said the new division headed by Deal would combine about 20,000 employees from the customer services groups within the company's existing commercial airplanes and defense, space and security businesses. It will have a small headquarters near Dallas, but most of the work will remain where it is, he added. \nSince Muilenburg took over as CEO in July 2015, Boeing has been steadily building up its services business, moves that have irked some of its partners. \nEarlier this year it ended an agreement with one of its largest suppliers, Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc (N: SPR ), effectively taking away manufacturing of profitable spare parts used in aircraft repairs. \nIt also began bringing some parts production in-house to gain control over repairs, and sifting its databases to help airlines predict when planes will need service. \nEngine repairs make up nearly half of the service market, but those are largely beyond the reach of Boeing or Airbus. Engine makers such as GE and Pratt & Whitney (N: UTX ) locked up their aftermarket more than a decade ago. \nStill Boeing's aftermarket sales growth is outpacing the 4.5 percent growth of the broad aftermarket, Dennis Floyd, vice president of services strategy and business development at Boeing, told Reuters recently. \n\"That means we're taking market share,\" he said.

REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon \nBy Alwyn Scott \nNEW YORK (Reuters) - Boeing Co (BA.N) on Monday named a senior General Electric Co (GE.N) executive to head its commercial aeroplanes division and announced a new services unit, in moves to capture more of the profitable market for parts and repairs after a jet is sold. \nThe changes are \"a big and important step\" toward Boeing's goal of increasing annual services revenue to about $50 billion (39.97 billion pounds) in 10 years from about $15 billion currently, Boeing Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg said on a call with journalists. \nThe changes do not alter plans for developing aircraft, but put a new \"emphasis on generating life-cycle value,\" Muilenburg said, referring to building an aircraft with an eye to gaining revenue from servicing the plane during its decades-long life. \n\"We've always said growing services is a core part of our strategy, and now you see us emphasizing and investing accordingly,\" Muilenburg said. \nBoeing tapped Kevin McAllister, 53, to lead its $66 billion commercial aeroplane business, succeeding Ray Conner, 61, effective immediately. \nConner, who started as a Boeing mechanic nearly 40 years ago, will serve as vice chairman through 2017 to help with the transition, the world's biggest planemaker said. \nMcAllister has been with GE's aviation unit for nearly 30 years and knows Boeing and its customers well, Muilenburg said. \nBoeing named Stanley Deal, 52, to head the new services unit, to be known as Global Services. Deal had been senior vice president of Boeing's Commercial Aviation Services business. \nThe Global Services business is due to begin operating in the third quarter of 2017. \nMcAllister has been chief executive of GE's $8 billion aviation services business, a unit that earns much of its revenue from contracts servicing GE aircraft engines. Airlines generally pay a fee for every hour they run the engines, which covers service and maintenance. \n\"Muilenburg is shaking up BCA with a surprise outside appointment which is likely a healthy move given that fresh leadership eyes can create positive movement,\" said analyst Peter Arment from Baird Equity Research. \nLast year, Muilenburg named Leanne Caret head of the defence business. She had run Boeing's defence services business. \nNow, Muilenburg said, \"the leaders of all three of our business... all have depth of understanding of services.” \nMuilenburg said the new division headed by Deal would combine about 20,000 employees from the customer services groups within the company's existing commercial airplanes and defence, space and security businesses. It will have a small headquarters near Dallas, but most of the work will remain where it is, he added. \nSince Muilenburg took over as CEO in July 2015, Boeing has been steadily building up its services business, moves that have irked some of its partners. \nEarlier this year it ended an agreement with one of its largest suppliers, Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc (SPR.N), effectively taking away manufacturing of profitable spare parts used in aircraft repairs. \nIt also began bringing some parts production in-house to gain control over repairs, and sifting its databases to help airlines predict when planes will need service. \nEngine repairs make up nearly half of the service market, but those are largely beyond the reach of Boeing or Airbus. Engine makers such as GE and Pratt & Whitney (UTX.N) locked up their aftermarket more than a decade ago. \nStill Boeing's aftermarket sales growth is outpacing the 4.5 percent growth of the broad aftermarket, Dennis Floyd, vice president of services strategy and business development at Boeing, told Reuters recently. \n\"That means we're taking market share,\" he said. \n(Additional reporting by Ankit Ajmera in Bengaluru; Editing by Andrew Hay and Lisa Shumaker) Associated Press - 8 minutes ago Asian shares modestly higher, tracking oil prices, rally on Wall Street … More » Asian shares gain, lifted by oil price rally on Wall Street Associated Press - 10 minutes ago Asian shares rose Tuesday, tracking the rally on Wall Street, as oil prices pushed higher amid hopes of an upcoming production-cut deal from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.

      "text": "(Adds services unit start date paragraph 9, analyst comment paragraph 11) By Alwyn Scott NEW YORK, Nov 21 (Reuters) - Boeing Co on Monday named a senior General Electric Co executive to head its commercial airplanes division and announced a new services unit, in moves to capture more of the profitable market for parts and repairs after a jet is sold. The changes are \"a big and important step\" toward Boeing's goal of increasing annual services revenue to about $50 billion in 10 years from about $15 billion currently, Boeing Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg said on a call with journalists. The changes do not alter plans for developing aircraft, but put a new \"emphasis on generating life-cycle value,\" Muilenburg said, referring to building an aircraft with an eye to gaining revenue from servicing the plane during its decades-long life. \"We've always said growing services is a core part of our strategy, and now you see us emphasizing and investing accordingly,\" Muilenburg said. Boeing tapped Kevin McAllister, 53, to lead its $66 billion commercial airplane business, succeeding Ray Conner, 61, effective immediately. Conner, who started as a Boeing mechanic nearly 40 years ago, will serve as vice chairman through 2017 to help with the transition, the world's biggest planemaker said. McAllister has been with GE's aviation unit for nearly 30 years and knows Boeing and its customers well, Muilenburg said. Boeing named Stanley Deal, 52, to head the new services unit, to be known as Global Services. Deal had been senior vice president of Boeing's Commercial Aviation Services business. The Global Services business is due to begin operating in the third quarter of 2017. McAllister has been chief executive of GE's $8 billion aviation services business, a unit that earns much of its revenue from contracts servicing GE aircraft engines. Airlines generally pay a fee for every hour they run the engines, which covers service and maintenance. \"Muilenburg is shaking up BCA with a surprise outside appointment which is likely a healthy move given that fresh leadership eyes can create positive movement,\" said analyst Peter Arment from Baird Equity Research. Last year, Muilenburg named Leanne Caret head of the defense business. She had run Boeing's defense services business. Now, Muilenburg said, \"the leaders of all three of our business...all have depth of understanding of services.\" Muilenburg said the new division headed by Deal would combine about 20,000 employees from the customer services groups within the company's existing commercial airplanes and defense, space and security businesses. It will have a small headquarters near Dallas, but most of the work will remain where it is, he added. Since Muilenburg took over as CEO in July 2015, Boeing has been steadily building up its services business, moves that have irked some of its partners. Earlier this year it ended an agreement with one of its largest suppliers, Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc, effectively taking away manufacturing of profitable spare parts used in aircraft repairs. It also began bringing some parts production in-house to gain control over repairs, and sifting its databases to help airlines predict when planes will need service. Engine repairs make up nearly half of the service market, but those are largely beyond the reach of Boeing or Airbus. Engine makers such as GE and Pratt & Whitney locked up their aftermarket more than a decade ago. Still Boeing's aftermarket sales growth is outpacing the 4.5 percent growth of the broad aftermarket, Dennis Floyd, vice president of services strategy and business development at Boeing, told Reuters recently. \"That means we're taking market share,\" he said.

      "text": "GE Stock Has Outperformed the Market Since Earnings, Can the Trend Continue? November 21, 2016, 07:28:00 PM EDT By Zacks Equity Research, Zacks.com Shutterstock photo \nA month has gone by since the last earnings report for General Electric (GE). Shares have added about 5.5 % in the past month, outperforming the S&P 500 in that time frame. \nWill the recent positive trend continue leading up to their next earnings release, or is the stock due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers. \nRecent Earnings \nGE Beats Q3 Earnings, Misses Revenues; 2016 View Narrowed Despite a challenging macroeconomic environment, sustained restructuring initiatives for a leaner firm with a re-focus on core operations enabled General Electric to report relatively healthy third-quarter 2016 results. GAAP net earnings for the reported quarter were $1,994 million or $0.22 a share compared with $2,506 million or $0.25 a share in the year-ago quarter. Including industrial and other verticals, operating earnings were $0.32 per share and improved 10% year over year. The operating earnings (including industrial and other verticals) for the reported quarter marginally beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by $0.01. Revenues Total consolidated revenue for the reported quarter increased 4% year over year to $29,266 million from $28,028 million in the year-earlier quarter, but missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $29,836 million. While the Industrial segment revenue increased 4% year over year to $27,421 million, GE Capital revenues declined 2% to $2,600 million. Organic revenue growth for the Industrial segment improved 1% for the quarter. Total orders for the quarter for the Industrial segment increased 16% year over year to $26.9 billion, with significant order improvements from the Renewable Energy and Energy Connections & Lighting segments, partially offset by considerable declines from Transportation and Oil & Gas. Total backlog of equipment and services at quarter-end was $319 billion, up 18% year over year. Margins, Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Owing to a highly volatile environment and sluggish growth across the globe, General Electric recorded a decline in margins in the reported quarter despite stringent cost-cutting and simplification initiatives. Industrial segment operating profit decreased 5% (organic growth down 3%) year over year to $4,320 million, with a significant fall in profits in Energy Connections & Lighting (down 84%), Oil & Gas (down 42%) and Transportation (down 18%), partially offset by a rise in profits in Renewable Energy (up 16%) and Power (up 12%). Gross margin for the Industrial segment improved 150 bps to 29.0%, while non-GAAP operating margin remained flat at 17.3%. Cash generated from operating industrial activities (excluding dividends) for the first nine months of 2016 totaled $3,368 million. Cash and marketable securities at quarter-end aggregated $98.9 billion. Outlook Narrowed General Electric aims to build upon the momentum for a healthy rise in operating profit in the next year and narrowed its earlier guidance. The company anticipates operating earnings in 2016 to be within $1.48-$1.52 a share, compared to its earlier range $1.45-$1.55. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2016 is currently pegged at $1.49 and lies comfortably within the predicted range. Organic revenue growth in 2016 is currently expected to be 0-2% compared to earlier projections of 2-4%. General Electric intends to return $30 billion to the shareholders in 2016, including $8 billion in dividends and $22 billion in share repurchases. In addition, the company expects to generate in excess of $32 billion in cash flow from operations in 2016, up from $30-$32 billion expected earlier.\nHow have estimates been moving since then? \nFollowing the release and in the last month, investors have witnessed a downward trend for fresh estimates. In the past month, there has been one revision higher for the current quarter compared to three lower. The consensus estimate has edged lower as a result, and now GE is expected to see earnings shrink by over 11.5% this quarter when compared to the year ago period. \nAs you can see in the chart below, this is starting to take a toll on the outlook, both for this year and the next: GENL ELECTRIC Price and Consensus \nGENL ELECTRIC Price and Consensus | GENL ELECTRIC Quote \nVGM Scores \nAt this time, General Electric's stock has a poor Growth score of 'F', however its momentum is doing a bit better with a 'C'. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of 'D' on the value side, putting it in the fourth quintile for this investment strategy. \nOverall, from a fundamental perspective, things aren't looking great for GE investors. As we can see, component scores are pretty weak, while the VGM score for this stock is an 'F'. \nOutlook \nWith estimates broadly trending lower and a weak fundamental position, the days of outperformance for GE may be nearing an end. It's no surprise shares of GE have a Zacks Rank # 4 (sell) and we are expecting a sluggish return from GE in the next few months. \nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

PHOTO: AFP Nov 22, 2016 8:52 AM \n[NEW YORK] Boeing Co on Monday named a senior General Electric Co executive to head its commercial airplanes division and announced a new services unit, in moves to capture more of the profitable market for parts and repairs after a jet is sold. \nThe changes are \"a big and important step\" toward Boeing's goal of increasing annual services revenue to about US$50 billion in 10 years from about US$15 billion currently, Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg said on a call with journalists. \n\"We've always said growing services is a core part of our strategy, and now you see us emphasising and investing accordingly,\" Mr Muilenburg said. \nBoeing tapped Kevin McAllister, 53, to lead its US$66 billion commercial airplane business, succeeding Ray Conner, 61, effective immediately. \nMr Conner, who started as a Boeing mechanic nearly 40 years ago, will serve as vice-chairman through 2017 to help with the transition, the world's biggest planemaker said. \nMr McAllister has been with GE's aviation unit for nearly 30 years and knows Boeing and its customers well, Mr Muilenburg said. \nBoeing named Stanley Deal, 52, to head the new services unit, to be known as Global Services. Mr Deal had been senior vice-president of Boeing's Commercial Aviation Services business. \nMr McAllister has been chief executive of GE's US$8 billion aviation services business, a unit that earns much of its revenue from contracts servicing GE aircraft engines. Airlines generally pay a fee for every hour they run the engines, which covers service and maintenance. \nLast year, Mr Muilenburg named Leanne Caret head of the defence business. She had run Boeing's defense services business. \nNow, Mr Muilenburg said, \"the leaders of all three of our business... all have depth of understanding of services.\" \nMr Muilenburg said the new division headed by Mr Deal would combine about 20,000 employees from the customer services groups within the company's existing commercial airplanes and defence, space and security businesses. It will have a small headquarters near Dallas, but most of the work will remain where it is, he added. \nThe changes do not alter plans for developing new aircraft, but there will be \"emphasis on generating life-cycle value,\" Mr Muilenburg said, referring to gaining more revenue throughout the decades-long life of the plane. \nSince Mr Muilenburg took over as CEO in July 2015, Boeing has been steadily building up its services business, moves that have irked some of its partners. \nEarlier this year it ended an agreement with one of its largest suppliers, Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc, effectively taking away manufacturing of profitable spare parts used in aircraft repairs. \nIt also began bringing some parts production in-house to gain control over repairs, and sifting its databases to help airlines predict when planes will need service. \nEngine repairs make up nearly half of the service market, but those are largely beyond the reach of Boeing or Airbus. Engine makers such as GE and Pratt & Whitney locked up their aftermarket more than a decade ago. \nStill Boeing's aftermarket sales growth is outpacing the 4.5 per cent growth of the broad aftermarket, Dennis Floyd, vice-president of services strategy and business development at Boeing, told Reuters recently. \n\"That means we're taking market share,\" he said. \nREUTERS ",

      "text": "Tweet Share Boeing's logo is seen on its KC-46 Aerial refuelling operator's station demonstrator during Japan Aerospace 2016 air show in Tokyo, Japan, October 12, 2016. REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon More By Alwyn Scott NEW YORK (Reuters) - Boeing Co (BA.N) on Monday named a senior General Electric Co (GE.N) executive to head its commercial airplanes division and announced a new services unit, in moves to capture more of the profitable market for parts and repairs after a jet is sold. The changes are \"a big and important step\" toward Boeing's goal of increasing annual services revenue to about $50 billion in 10 years from about $15 billion currently, Boeing Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg said on a call with journalists. The changes do not alter plans for developing aircraft, but put a new \"emphasis on generating life-cycle value,\" Muilenburg said, referring to building an aircraft with an eye to gaining revenue from servicing the plane during its decades-long life. \"We've always said growing services is a core part of our strategy, and now you see us emphasizing and investing accordingly,\" Muilenburg said. Boeing tapped Kevin McAllister, 53, to lead its $66 billion commercial airplane business, succeeding Ray Conner, 61, effective immediately. Conner, who started as a Boeing mechanic nearly 40 years ago, will serve as vice chairman through 2017 to help with the transition, the world's biggest planemaker said. McAllister has been with GE's aviation unit for nearly 30 years and knows Boeing and its customers well, Muilenburg said. Boeing named Stanley Deal, 52, to head the new services unit, to be known as Global Services. Deal had been senior vice president of Boeing's Commercial Aviation Services business. The Global Services business is due to begin operating in the third quarter of 2017. McAllister has been chief executive of GE's $8 billion aviation services business, a unit that earns much of its revenue from contracts servicing GE aircraft engines. Airlines generally pay a fee for every hour they run the engines, which covers service and maintenance. \"Muilenburg is shaking up BCA with a surprise outside appointment which is likely a healthy move given that fresh leadership eyes can create positive movement,\" said analyst Peter Arment from Baird Equity Research. Last year, Muilenburg named Leanne Caret head of the defense business. She had run Boeing's defense services business. Now, Muilenburg said, \"the leaders of all three of our business...all have depth of understanding of services.” Muilenburg said the new division headed by Deal would combine about 20,000 employees from the customer services groups within the company's existing commercial airplanes and defense, space and security businesses. It will have a small headquarters near Dallas, but most of the work will remain where it is, he added. Since Muilenburg took over as CEO in July 2015, Boeing has been steadily building up its services business, moves that have irked some of its partners. Earlier this year it ended an agreement with one of its largest suppliers, Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc (SPR.N), effectively taking away manufacturing of profitable spare parts used in aircraft repairs. It also began bringing some parts production in-house to gain control over repairs, and sifting its databases to help airlines predict when planes will need service. Engine repairs make up nearly half of the service market, but those are largely beyond the reach of Boeing or Airbus. Engine makers such as GE and Pratt & Whitney (UTX.N) locked up their aftermarket more than a decade ago. Still Boeing's aftermarket sales growth is outpacing the 4.5 percent growth of the broad aftermarket, Dennis Floyd, vice president of services strategy and business development at Boeing, told Reuters recently. \"That means we're taking market share,\" he said.

Photo: Reuters Published: 6:50 AM, November 22, 2016 Updated: 9:50 AM, November 22, 2016 \nNEW YORK - Boeing Co <BA.N> on Monday named a senior General Electric Co <GE.N> executive to head its commercial airplanes division and announced a new services unit, in moves to capture more of the profitable market for parts and repairs after a jet is sold. \nThe changes are \"a big and important step\" toward Boeing's goal of increasing annual services revenue to about $50 billion in 10 years from about $15 billion currently, Boeing Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg said on a call with journalists. \nThe changes do not alter plans for developing aircraft, but put a new \"emphasis on generating life-cycle value,\" Muilenburg said, referring to building an aircraft with an eye to gaining revenue from servicing the plane during its decades-long life. \n\"We've always said growing services is a core part of our strategy, and now you see us emphasizing and investing accordingly,\" Muilenburg said. \nBoeing tapped Kevin McAllister, 53, to lead its $66 billion commercial airplane business, succeeding Ray Conner, 61, effective immediately. \nConner, who started as a Boeing mechanic nearly 40 years ago, will serve as vice chairman through 2017 to help with the transition, the world's biggest planemaker said. \nMcAllister has been with GE's aviation unit for nearly 30 years and knows Boeing and its customers well, Muilenburg said. \nBoeing named Stanley Deal, 52, to head the new services unit, to be known as Global Services. Deal had been senior vice president of Boeing's Commercial Aviation Services business. \nThe Global Services business is due to begin operating in the third quarter of 2017. \nMcAllister has been chief executive of GE's $8 billion aviation services business, a unit that earns much of its revenue from contracts servicing GE aircraft engines. Airlines generally pay a fee for every hour they run the engines, which covers service and maintenance. \n\"Muilenburg is shaking up BCA with a surprise outside appointment which is likely a healthy move given that fresh leadership eyes can create positive movement,\" said analyst Peter Arment from Baird Equity Research. \nLast year, Muilenburg named Leanne Caret head of the defense business. She had run Boeing's defense services business. \nNow, Muilenburg said, \"the leaders of all three of our business...all have depth of understanding of services.” \nMuilenburg said the new division headed by Deal would combine about 20,000 employees from the customer services groups within the company's existing commercial airplanes and defense, space and security businesses. It will have a small headquarters near Dallas, but most of the work will remain where it is, he added. \nSince Muilenburg took over as CEO in July 2015, Boeing has been steadily building up its services business, moves that have irked some of its partners. \nEarlier this year it ended an agreement with one of its largest suppliers, Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc <SPR.N>, effectively taking away manufacturing of profitable spare parts used in aircraft repairs. \nIt also began bringing some parts production in-house to gain control over repairs, and sifting its databases to help airlines predict when planes will need service. \nEngine repairs make up nearly half of the service market, but those are largely beyond the reach of Boeing or Airbus. Engine makers such as GE and Pratt & Whitney <UTX.N> locked up their aftermarket more than a decade ago. \nStill Boeing's aftermarket sales growth is outpacing the 4.5 percent growth of the broad aftermarket, Dennis Floyd, vice president of services strategy and business development at Boeing, told Reuters recently. \n\"That means we're taking market share,\" he said.
