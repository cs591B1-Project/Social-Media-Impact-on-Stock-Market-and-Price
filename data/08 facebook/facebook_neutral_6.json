      "text": "Father Frank Pavone’s video appears to have been removed from Facebook. Victory, or deceit?\nAs of 12 November 2016 at 9:15pm, it appears Father Frank Pavone has removed the controversial facebook video that appears on his 6 November segment of “Father Frank, Live!”, wherein the bodily remains of a child were exploited and dignity offended while desecrating an altar in honor of promoting a greater turnout for Donald Trump in the U.S. Presidential Elections. Two problems remain: he also removed his apology video but has not removed a similar offensive video from youtube . \n( Update 13 November 2016, 13:50 pacific time: Father Frank Pavone’s second video that was posted on YouTube is no longer available. This is good news! Unfortunately, we are yet to learn whether the videos are archived for review by the proper authorities, nor do we know the exact reason for the disappearance of all three videos. Also, the screen shots of Father Pavone’s first video and a link to it remain on the social media posts mentioned in this post.) \nThe link to the video is here , and users will find the image above instead of the actual offensive video. (I hope I’m not wrong and if so, please let me know! Viewers beware: Numerous offensive videos may be found on Father Pavone’s website and social media pages.) \nIs this a victory or is this deceit? Father Pavone’s “Father Frank, Live!” video from 6 November, 2016. This video appears to have been removed in accordance with the instruction handed to Father Pavone by the Diocese of Amarillo. We had come to understand that Father Pavone was instructed to remove the Facebook video by the diocese where he has faculties, the Diocese of Amarillo. However, we had not seen Father Pavone remove the video immediately after being instructed to do so – in fact, Father Pavone gave a ‘ sorry, not sorry ‘ and would not accept criticism of his approach. (At the time, the videos were still online.)\nAdditionally, Father Pavone told CNS on 8 November that he was not concerned about what the Diocese of Amarillo had to say on the videos. (We later learned that the Bishop of Amarillo would come to slam Father Pavone ‘s actions in a statement released on the same day.) @frfrankpavone : Desecrated the altar -Offended the dignity of this person -Did not act as Catholic https://t.co/5tN2TKNwN4 / @keithmestrada pic.twitter.com/06Oy3YvVwu \n— Mr. Keith M Estrada (@keithmestrada) November 9, 2016 \nMoreover, after Father Pavone’s preferred candidate for president won the November 8 election, the Priests for Life National Director celebrated the victory for pro-life causes throughout the nation – however immature if not foolish that may have been. \nIs this a victory, or is this deceit? \nWe don’t know if the video were removed by Father Pavone or by Facebook, or if it is some glitch. If it was Father Pavone, why did he remove the Facebook one and not the second one , still on Youtube – and why remove the apology? If Facebook removed, thank God – though this seems less likely as Father Pavone’s apology would violate Facebook’s community standards even less than his original offense. \nDid Father Frank remove it because he was instructed to do so? Would it have been wise for Father Frank to remove the second video, as well? Would it have been deceitful not to delete the Youtube video if he were asked to delete the Facebook one, if his superior did not specify deleting both? \nMore: As of 00:04 pacific time on 13 November, Father Pavone still has a screen shot of his Facebook Live video from 6 November (along with a link) posted onto his Twitter account as a tweet, and on the Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram accounts of Priests for Life – all can be found here , here , here , and here , respectively (graphic/offensive image). If the image/link were posted on Father Frank Pavone’s Instagram account, it is no longer there. \nAs we have learned, some have taken their concerns to Bishop Zurek of Amarillo, the US Conference of Catholic Bishops, and the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. If further investigation is necessary, the video may be useful for review. (If you are looking, or have access to the video in question, please contact us .) \nSome who have been following the development of Father Pavone’s exploitation and desecration in honor of Trump have shared with us that the video was most likely removed the night of 11 November. Maybe Father Frank Pavone deleted the video after noticing – why it took so long, we don’t know – that some have suggested the possibility of Father Frank Pavone of Priests for Life storing, preserving the bodies of children in formaldehyde to perpetually commodify for their political propaganda, and it seems the video may have been removed after this. As we’ve mentioned, we have not heard back from Priests for Life on our request for comment tied to this particular concern. \nWhat about the Youtube video, Father? Whether or not you removed your Facebook video of “Father Frank, Live!”, the episode from 6 November 2016, where you exploit a child’s body, offend the child’s dignity, and desecrate an altar, won’t you consider removing the Youtube video, as well? If you do, will you apologize and make a statement making us aware that you removed it – as well as secure copies of it for the authorities who might need to review it? \nWhile we are on the topic of apologies, why did you remove your half-apology video ? Are you in the process of writing the script to a new apology video that is without qualifications? \nThis may be a victory or it may be an act of deceit – regardless, there was one victory today on this offense, and that was the statement made by the president of Priests for Life in Canada rebuking Father Pavone’s actions. \nOn their Facebook page on the morning of 12 November, Priests for Life said : \nIn recent days, social media has been abuzz regarding a video posted by Fr. Frank Pavone, head of Priests for Life (U.S.A.), in which the body of an aborted child was openly displayed on an altar. Many were rightly disturbed, shocked and horrified by such an action. While Priests for Life Canada would certainly concur with the need for the public to be aware of the stark reality of abortion, we are deeply disturbed by such actions. \nFirst, a child is due the same respect given through adult funeral rites which honour the dignity of the human person and respect for the body of the dead. Catholic funerals do not display the body as an exhibit. Even at wakes, it is rare that a body that had suffered violence would be displayed. This is to avoid reactions of shock or even disgust and would detract from the teachings of the Church to treat the body with respect. Funerals should not be used for sensation but to pray for those affected by the death. \nSecond, it is never allowed that we alter the rite of a Catholic funeral by having the body of the deceased on the altar during Mass or any at any other time. In our day, with so much confusion regarding funeral rites and the proper respect to be shown to the human body, we need to encourage the same respect for all human bodies, born and unborn. \nIn closing, we would like to make it clear that Priests for Life Canada is completely independent of Priests for Life (U.S.A.), and although we, along with many other pro-life organizations, do share common goals and objectives, we cannot concur with all of their actions and the recent actions of Fr. Pavone are not supported by Priests for Life Canada. Priests for Life Canada shares the same concerns as recently issued by Fr. Pavone’s Ordinary, Bishop Patrick Zurek of the Diocese of Amarillo \n“Priests for Life Inc. is not a Catholic institution, but a civil organization and is not under the control or supervision of the Diocese of Amarillo. The Diocese of Amarillo deeply regrets the offense and outrage caused by the video for the faithful and the community at large. The action and presentation of Father Pavone in this video is not consistent with the beliefs of the Catholic Church.” \nPriests for Life Canada supports the investigation around the release of this video that is now being undertaken by the Diocese of Amarillo. We continue to pray for all of the good work done by Priests for Life (U.S.A.) \nFr Thomas Lynch President Priests for Life Canada \nWe look forward to learning more and sharing additional updates as we have them.

      "text": "– “Father Frank, Live!” on Facebook: Using the Dead to Elect Trump? Going too far? (Disturbing images; Update on body, Priests for Life.) * * * Father Frank Pavone by Priests for Life. Public Domain. Update – 12 November, 2016 at 21:50 pacific time: Victory or deceit: Father Frank Pavone Removes 1 of 2 Videos of Dead Baby on Altar for Trump! (Also, Priests for Life Canada Rebukes Pavone!) Click here for more. \nFather Frank Pavone, national director of Priests for Life, released a statement Wednesday morning celebrating Donald J. Trump’s victory. \nThe full statement follows: \nToday is a great day for America and the Church, and a debt of gratitude is owed to all who boldly spoke up, worked, and voted for pro-life candidates, starting with our new President-elect. I am grateful to all of you and our whole team for all the work of this long, contentious election cycle. \nOur nation will now embark on a path to eliminate abortion and to foster the freedom of the Church. We will be able to advance such an agenda because of the pro-life majorities that now exist both in the House of Representatives and in the Senate. \nIn particular, this election victory means the end of the HHS mandate, against which Priests for Life was one of the first groups to launch a challenge in federal court. That challenge, joined by various dioceses and other groups, has gone all the way to the Supreme Court, and is still unresolved. Now, however, we see a bright light at the end of the tunnel. \nPriests for Life will continue to be at the forefront of the pro-life efforts both within and beyond the Church – and by “pro-life” we mean specifically working to end abortion and restore protection to children in the womb. \nWe at Priests for Life – and I personally – welcome all who want join us. We are an open book, and we renew the invitation which we have extended multiple times in the past to all clergy and laity, to come and visit us and learn more about what we do and how we do it. \nFor what we do, we face much opposition and even hostility. We are not concerned about any of the criticism that has been launched against us, whether from within or outside the Church. Such opposition is a way of life for those who actively work to end abortion. Opposition and criticism do not burden me or my team at all, because there is a far greater burden every single day our minds and hearts: the continued slaughter of thousands of children every day by abortion. \nAdded to that burden is the silence of so many laity and clergy, and countless faithful have had enough of that. \nWe have no dispute with anyone who wants to end abortion, but only with those – such as the majority of Democratic politicians – who want to hide it and allow it to continue. For many years, and right up to this Election Day, many of the attacks launched against me and my organization have been motivated by partisan politics, and in particular by Democratic supporters who know the damage our work does to their abortion agenda. We are proud to endure those attacks and, as has happened in this election, we will continue to be victorious. \nPavone said: “We are not concerned about any of the criticism that has been launched against us, whether from within or outside the Church.” \nThis, just days after pretending to be open to people’s concerns and less than 24 hours after the Bishop of Amarillo slammed Fr. Pavone’s recent actions , demonstrates the diabolical nature of the ideology at the center of this movement. \nWhat were those actions? Those actions were sacrilege, the exploitation of a child’s body, offending human dignity, and acting in a manner inconsistent with the demands of the Catholic faith – and basic human decency. All of this was done when Father Pavone placed the bodily remains of a child on an altar in order to compel voters to opt for Trump on election day (2016). \nAs we said in a previous post concerning the storing of children’s bodies: \nFather Frank Pavone, this is amazing: do we have a sort of trafficking of human remains, exploiting a child’s body and denying burial for political purposes while desecrating an altar? Whether or not there are several babies named “Baby Choice”, Snopes and the Catholic Herald both note that Priests for Life stores (either denying burial or having disinterred) children’s bodies in formaldehyde for decades at a time. That’s a harsh bill of (not-)goods. \nFather Pavone told CNS on Tuesday that \nthe bishops have never supported his work, and he was not concerned about repercussions out of Amarillo. \n“I don’t belong in Amarillo, to tell you the truth,” he said. “The bishop (Yanta) invited me. I have no reason to be there.” \nFurther, Father Pavone minimized what it means to be “Pro-Life” by restricting his understanding of the term to “working to end abortion and restore protection to children in the womb”, however inaccurate that may be. Not only are Father Pavone’s political preferences obstacles to ending abortion and protecting children in the womb, defining “Pro-Life” as he does is inconsistent with the basic definitions of “Pro” and “Life” in addition to the understanding of “Pro-Life” by the U.S. Catholic Bishops and what it means to be for live in papal encyclicals. \nUntil next time, \nKME  ",

      "text": "– “Father Frank, Live!” on Facebook: Using the Dead to Elect Trump? Going too far? (Disturbing images; Update on body, Priests for Life.) \nRead what Snopes has uncovered on where this baby came from: \nORIGIN:On 6 November 2016, a Catholic priest posted a live Facebook video in which he placed (what was said to be) an aborted fetus upon an altar, urging fellow Catholics to vote against Democrats and legal abortion. \nA spokeswoman for the Catholic clergy activist group, Priests for Life, confirmed that the fetus was real and was given to the organization by a pathologist under a strict agreement on confidentiality, although she was able to tell us that it was aborted in the second trimester of pregnancy. The group has dubbed the fetus “Baby Choice.” Public Domain – by Priests for Life. \nIn the video, Fr. Pavone has the fetus on an altar, which the spokeswoman said is located in a room that is sometimes used for Mass at the organization’s headquarters in Staten Island, New York. The Priests for Life group originally performed a funeral service for the body, which is preserved in formalin and normally kept in a memorial chapel. \nFather Pavone (Priests for Life): Did you tell Snopes that the baby’s body used in the video was known as “Baby Choice”? \nI’ve been waiting to learn from you the answers to the questions I emailed your organization. Considering the possibility that this is Baby Choice, as you call the child’s body, please tell us more about the child’s body’s origin. \nAlso, do you name every child “Baby Choice”– isn’t each child unique? – or do you simply have this child and one from 2012 named Baby Choice? Or is there only one Baby Choice that you’ve kept – kept from burial – over the years? \nPlease tell us this child – nor any child every entrusted to or received by Priests for Life – has either been stored for political use and show, deprived of burial, or disinterred. \nLet us all remember Baby Choice the First, from July 2012 , also used for political purposes. She was described as a girl – and Father Pavone described this week’s child as a boy (and some say that in other places the same child was described as a girl). \nOn August 3, 2012, the Catholic Herald reported: \nProtestors said “Baby Choice” was a victim of a second-trimester saline abortion, in which a salt solution is injected into the mother’s womb to slowly poison the fetus. The body of the intact Caucasian fetus, at 20-22 weeks’ gestation, was covered with black spots where the salt solution burned off the top layer of her skin. \nThe only information that Father Pavone disclosed about the baby, dubbed “Baby Choice,” was that he had acquired her from outside North Carolina and brought her to town so that her funeral could coincide with the demonstration. \n[…] \nBaby Choice” has been the name given to various fetal remains obtained and displayed by anti-abortion groups including Americans Against Abortion, Operation Rescue/Operation Save America and Priests for Life over the past three decades. \nThe first “Baby Choice” appeared in 1985, and is similar to the baby memorialized in Charlotte last week: a girl at the same gestational age, who died from the same abortion procedure, featuring similar black burn marks on the skin. \nFather Pavone said the baby in Charlotte was not the original 1985 “Baby Choice.” \n[…] \nHowever, two Operation Rescue/ Operation Save America members described the baby as not being recently deceased, saying they have used her in similar demonstrations elsewhere. \nOrganizers insisted that they treat the baby’s remains with dignity and respect as part of their fight to end abortion. \nDr. Patricia McEwen – whom the Priests for Life office referred inquires [sic] to about “Baby Choice” and now serves with Operation Save America, Life Coalition International and Doctors for Life International – said she first met “Baby Choice” in 1991, and that the baby regularly travels around the country in anti-abortion demonstrations. The baby is the victim of “a very old saline abortion,” McEwen said, and is kept in formaldehyde when not being used in demonstrations. \n“We’ve gotten attached to this little one. She’s the evidence of our sins, of our crimes against the little ones,” said evangelist Rusty Lee Thomas of Operation Rescue/Operation Save America, who said he once carried “Baby Choice” on a six- month walk across in America in 2004. \n“It’s not like we want to exploit her or anything like that. Even though ‘Baby Choice’ is dead, she still speaks. We need to weep and mourn and grieve, and ‘Baby Choice’ helps in that process,” Thomas said. \nChurch regulations issued by the Vatican’s Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith in 1987, signed by then-Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger (now Pope Benedict XVI), state that fetal remains – whether fully developed or not, whether aborted or not – “must be respected just as the remains of other human beings.” That includes timely and reverent burial or cremation, and forbids any “commercial trafficking.” “Furthermore, the moral requirements must be safeguarded that there be no complicity in deliberate abortion and that the risk of scandal be avoided.” \n(The paragraph from the CDF document cited reads in full: “The corpses of human embryos and foetuses, whether they have been deliberately aborted or not, must be respected just as the remains of other human beings. In particular, they cannot be subjected to mutilation or to autopsies if their death has not yet been verified and without the consent of the parents or of the mother. Furthermore, the moral requirements must be safeguarded that there be no complicity in deliberate abortion and that the risk of scandal be avoided. Also, in the case of dead foetuses, as for the corpses of adult persons, all commercial trafficking must be considered illicit and should be prohibited.”) \nFather Frank Pavone, this is amazing: do we have a sort of trafficking of human remains, exploiting a child’s body and denying burial for political purposes while desecrating an altar? Whether or not there are several babies named “Baby Choice”, Snopes and the Catholic Herald both note that Priests for Life stores (either denying burial or having disinterred) children’s bodies in formaldehyde for decades at a time. That’s a harsh bill of (not-)goods. \nAs we have stated, we have received no reply from Priests for Life in response to our request for information on these matters. \nBesides the sacrilege, Father Pavone, let’s at least clarify whether or not children’s bodies are ever stored, denied burial beyond a customary amount of time, or disinterred. \nLet’s just start there, Father – your sacrilege, commodification of human bodies, disobedience to your Bishop, and foolish political preference are a separate conversation. \nIt should also be noted that Father Pavone responded to a request for comment from a media organization outside of the USA, the Daily Mail. This afternoon, the Daily Mail published an exclusive email explanation from Father Pavone on the origins of the bodies they receive. Check it out, here . The body was received, entrusted to Priests for Life for burial – but not so fast, dignified creature’s remains: first, you must be used as a tool for his political agenda! \nGod is Love, \nKeith Michael Estrada  ",

      "text": "– “Father Frank, Live!” on Facebook: Using the Dead to Elect Trump? Going too far? (Disturbing images; Update on body, Priests for Life.) Fr. Frank Pavone (Public Domain) via Priests for Life. Pavone identifies himself as prophet and martyr after heavy backlash in response to what he described as honoring a child’s lifeless body on an altar – in promoting Trump’s candidacy. \nAfter a long day of criticism for using the lifeless body of a child on an altar in a last-minute attempt to support Donald Trump’s campaign for President of the United States, Father Frank Pavone, national director of Priests for Life, told Matt C. Abbot at RenewAmerica, “The issue is not how I’m treating a baby.” \nIn an e-mail to Abbot, Pavone explained: \nI’ve been providing funerals and burials for these children for decades, with full legal and canonical counsel, and those concerned about these things would do well to talk to me rather than the media. \nThe issue is how the abortionists, supported by the Democrats, are treating these babies. What’s sacrilegious is abortion, and voting for those who support it. It’s time we get our heads screwed on straight about who the bad guys are. \nWe are living in the midst of a holocaust, and our nation faces a choice on November 8 between electing people, like Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party, who will continue that holocaust and have us pay for it, and Donald Trump and the Republican Party, who are committed to working to bring it to an end. This choice is neither confusing nor difficult. \n[…] \nDonald Trump is ready to defend the unborn and to defend the church. That’s why I’m with him – and all believers should be also. And as he is attacked, so are those who stand with him. So be it. \nAbbot described Pavone’s video message as Pavone “standing behind an altar with an aborted baby in an effort to support Donald Trump.” Pavone’s e-mail to Abbot didn’t seem to contradict that. Sam Rocha, then, wasn’t too far off in writing “ Fr. Pavone Places Human Corpse on Altar, an Offering to the Idol of Trump “. \nWe e-mailed Priests for Life today asking: \nA) has the child had been buried and then disinterred? B) who gave him permission to do this? C) how is this in line with the theology of burial as an act of mercy and a sign of respect (cf. CIC 1176.2, CCC 2300)? \nWe learned that Father Pavone uploaded not one, but two videos – one to Facebook and one to Youtube. \nWe do not know where this child’s body comes from, when Priests for Life received the body, when the body will receive proper burial, etc. \nOne source has told us that the Diocese of Amarillo instructed Father Pavone to remove the video he posted onto Facebook Live, but has refused to do so. We have not been able to confirm this. \nWe are waiting to hear back from the Diocese of Amarillo, the USCCB’s Secretariat for Pro-Life Activities, and the Pontifical Academy for Life – of which, Father Pavone is a member. \nIf Father Pavone will not obey his Bishop, who will he obey? \nWe lamented earlier that the “second video makes it more difficult to avoid the regrettable conclusion that Father Frank commodified the body of a child. This is an act of sacrilege, profanity, and desecration.” \nWe’ll be updating all posts when we learn more. \nFor now, Father Frank points to others as doers of sacrilege – it will be interesting to know if the Bishop of Amarillo agrees that voting for candidates who support abortion is sacrilegious. Does it matter if the Bishop agrees? \nPavone said, “What’s sacrilegious is abortion, and voting for those who support it.” Does Pavone think what he did is not sacrilegious? \nOne Facebook user commented on Father Frank’s video “Let that baby rest in peace!” Father Frank replied, “[name omitted] wake up. WE are the ones honoring this child, who was exploited and killed by the abortion industry. And it is time to show the horror of abortion, not only for people who deny it’s real, but for believers who have forgotten what the prophets did in exposing evil. This is only the beginning of what we are going to do to expose it, so fasten your seat belt.” \nScott Eric Alt wrote today , \nSo Fr. Pavone makes no secret that he put that dead child up on the altar and filmed him and plastered a stillon Facebook in order to lobby for a particular presidential candidate. \nIs that what the altar of sacrifice in a Catholic Church is for?No. Says Canon 1239: \nAn altar, whether fixed or movable, is to be reserved for divine worship alone, to the exclusion of any secular usage. \nThe altar is intended for a sacramental purpose, as the place where the priest celebrates Mass. \nI am going to be, excuse the pun, frank: What Fr. Pavone did was a sacrilege. It is a violation of canon law, which states that the altar is consecrated for one purpose and one purpose only. It is consecrated for the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass. It is not consecrated so that a dead child can be placed there as part of a political stunt to lobby for a favored presidential candidate. \nPavone told Abbot, “The issue is not how I’m treating a baby.” Though, I think, it may be better to have used the verb “using”. As we’ve said, the child’s body is being used – it’s a prop! a stage piece! – for the “Father Frank, Live!” show. How embarrassing. \nPavone told Abbot, “The issue is not how I’m treating a baby.” \n… \nWe’re anxious to learn more. We’re looking forward to an authentic pro-life movement. \nUntil next time, \nKeith Michael Estrada  ",

      "text": "Is This The End Of Fake News On Facebook? Mark Zuckerberg Promises To End Fake News On Facebook November 13, 2016 , 9:15 PM Photo: Mark Schiefelbein/AP Images. In a post on his Facebook profile late on Saturday, Mark Zuckerberg said Facebook is planning to deal with those endless fake stories “soon.\" \"Our goal is to show people the content they will find most meaningful, and people want accurate news,\" the CEO wrote. \"We have already launched work enabling our community to flag hoaxes and fake news, and there is more we can do here. We have made progress, and we will continue to work on this to improve further.\" Advertisement Recently, fake news on Facebook included a widely shared false report just days before the election: The post claimed that an FBI agent investigating Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server had killed himself. The story seemed designed to derail the campaign. Your newsfeed is tailored to show you stories similar to what you and your friends have liked and shared in the past, and a fake story aimed at supporters of either candidate during the contentious election could easily spread — thus helping its creators earn major money from ad revenue. President Barack Obama even called out the platform — which Facebook insists is not a media outlet — in the days leading up to the election. However, Zuckerberg is adamant that fake news posts on Facebook did not alter the election, explaining in his post that only a small amount of posts are fake. \"Of all the content on Facebook, more than 99% of what people see is authentic,\" he writes. \"Only a very small amount is fake news and hoaxes. The hoaxes that do exist are not limited to one partisan view, or even to politics. Overall, this makes it extremely unlikely hoaxes changed the outcome of this election in one direction or the other.\" A recent BuzzFeed investigation found that Zuckerberg's 99% figure might not be accurate. According to the report, 38% of posts shared from three large right-wing politics pages on Facebook included \"false or misleading information\" and three large left-wing pages did the same nearly 20% of the time. Advertisement We also learned something amazing reading Zuckerberg's note. Facebook helped more people register to vote than ever. \"Overall, I am proud of our role giving people a voice in this election,\" he writes. \"We helped more than 2 million people register to vote, and based on our estimates we got a similar number of people to vote who might have stayed home otherwise.\" Advertisement",

The No. 19 Wolves are on a 10-game winning streak . \nWhen looking at the latest Super Region 2 rankings released Sunday evening , Tuskegee is eighth behind West Alabama (7-3), but the Golden Tigers got that seventh and final playoff seed. The Golden Tigers have the same amount of region and overall Division wins (7) as West Alabama (7-4), but have one fewer loss (2 to 3) and one of their wins came against an FCS school, Florida A&M (4-6). \nWest Alabama's other loss came at Steven F. Austin (4-6), which is also an FCS school. Virginia State 45, Tuskegee 35: Special teams spoil Golden Tigers’ finale \nTuskegee is coming off a 45-35 home loss to Virginia State (9-2) in a game it needed to play to qualify for the playoffs. The Golden Tigers came into the season with a nine-game schedule as they lost a game when fellow SIAC West school Stillman dropped football last December. \nSchools must to play 10 games to qualify for the playoffs. \nTuskegee athletic director Curtis Campbell said last month he couldn’t find an opponent to play for that Oct. 15 date because schools are in the middle of conference play. Using that week as a bye, Tuskegee was banking on that 10th game being the SIAC title game, but that didn't happen. \nThe Golden Tigers lost, 10-9, to Kentucky State on homecoming Oct. 22. Tuskegee came into the game with its highest ranking ever in the AFCA D-II poll at fifth, but fell to a team that had a losing record. With the win, Kentucky State clinched the SIAC West to advance to the conference title game it lost to Fort Valley State, 33-30, Saturday at Cramton Bowl in Montgomery. \nThe Monday after Tuskegee lost to Kentucky State, Campbell requested a waiver to the NCAA to qualify for the playoffs with just nine games. The waiver was denied, but Campbell had worked out a deal with Fort Valley State and Albany State in which the loser of their game would play Tuskegee on Saturday. Tuskegee to play Albany State again for 10th game to qualify for NCAA D-II playoffs \nFort Valley State beat Albany State to win the SIAC East, leaving Albany State to play Tuskegee. Two days later, Tuskegee announced Monday that Albany State, which had played and lost to the Golden Tigers earlier this season, had backed out of the agreement. \nScrambling to find that necessary 10th game game, Tuskegee wound up getting Virginia State, coached by former Alabama State coach Reggie Barlow, to play it. The Trojans had a slim outside shot of making the playoffs with a victory over a ranked team, but still didn’t after winning at Tuskegee. \nVirginia State ended up ninth in the Super Region 1 rankings. \nCampbell had said he wanted a 10th game to help Tuskegee’s seeding. Scheduling an eight-win team at the time may have worked in Tuskegee’s favor to get that final spot. Had the Golden Tigers played Albany State, which had only five wins or Fort Valley State, winners of only four games before beating Kentucky State in the SIAC title game, and lost, that would have damaged their playoffs chances. \nTuskegee started out third in the first Super Region 2 rankings last month, but had dropped all the way to sixth in last week’s rankings. So the Golden Tigers weren’t in an ideal spot, are eighth in the latest regional rankings, but still made the playoffs. \nBarely. The NCAA expanded its playoffs from 24 teams to 28 in 2015. Albany St. out, Virginia St. now 10th Tuskegee game \nLast season, Tuskegee advanced to the quarterfinals as a sixth seed before losing at top seed West Georgia. No. 7 North Alabama (8-1) is the top seed in this year's Super Region 2 bracket. The Lions only played nine games, but had a game cancelled at Florida Tech due to the threat of Hurricane Matthew. \nThe NCAA granted North Alabama a waiver to qualify for the playoffs with just nine games. \nThe Tuskegee-Newberry winner will play the Florida Tech-North Greenville winner. Florida Tech (8-2) is a third seed while North Greenville (7-4) is seeded sixth. \nNorth Alabama will play the Valdosta State (8-2)-UNC-Pembroke (9-1) winner. No. 23 Valdosta State is a fourth seed while No. 16 UNC-Pembroke, which fell to Tuskegee for its only loss of the season, is seeded fifth. \nThe Golden Tigers came back from a 16-point deficit in the fourth quarter to beat UNC-Pembroke, 21-16, at home.",

      "text": "tweet now! \nATLANTA (AP) — A wannabe weatherman was jailed for arson after admitting he started a wildfire to draw attention to his selfie videos on Facebook, his town's police chief said Friday. Meanwhile, a Georgia sheriff appealed for help identifying the driver of a dark blue SUV last seen where other wildfires began. And in North Carolina, authorities suspect arson in more than 20 wildfires burning in a national forest. \n\"It's really too bad because he's not a bad kid — he's just misguided,\" said James Stephens, the police chief in Jenkins, Kentucky, where Johnny Mullins, 21, was arrested this week on a second-degree arson charge. \n\"He likes to do Facebook videos and have people follow him on his 'weather forecast,' so that's pretty much why he did what he did,\" the chief said. \"He enjoyed the attention he got from the Facebook stuff.\" \n\"He didn't realize how much danger he was putting other people in,\" Stephens added. \nA teenager in Harlan County, Kentucky also was arrested for arson this week, and in Tennessee, authorities said Friday that Andrew Scott Lewis was charged with setting fires and vandalism causing more than $250,000 in damage and threatening homes outside Chattanooga. \nNo arrests were announced in most of the rest of the suspicious fires, which have been torching forests in and around the southern Appalachian mountains. The relentless drought across much of the South has removed the usual humidity and sucked wells and streams dry, making the woods ripe for fire. \nTens of thousands of acres have burned, about a dozen of the largest fires remain uncontained and many people to evacuate their homes ahead of fast-moving flames. \nLaw officers in Georgia's Rabun County suspect that someone started a series of small roadside fires Wednesday that eventually merged into the much larger blazes firefighters were working to contain on Friday, said Justin Upchurch, the county's assistant fire chief. \nThe Rabun County sheriff's office urged people to be on the look-out, saying the SUV was last seen in the area of the fires. The office was more emphatic in a separate Facebook post, asking residents to spread the word \"and help us lock this criminal up!!!\" \nThe area is less than 50 miles from North Carolina's Nantahala National Forest, where more than 20 wildfires that have burned more than 17,000 acres are all \"being investigated for suspected arson,\" forestry officials announced in a status update. \nThere were 14 other wildfires burning on Cherokee Nation land in North Carolina, all under investigation by local law enforcement. A fire managers' update noted that the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs is seeking information about fires on Indian lands through an arson hotline. \nThe U.S. Forest Service announced Friday that the entire Cohutta Wilderness, which stretches across the Chattahoochee National Forest in Georgia and the Cherokee National Forest in Tennessee, has been closed to the public due to multiple fires there. \nStates of emergency were declared in some of the affected areas to facilitate state and federal spending on the response. \nMore than 5,000 firefighters and support staff from around the nation have joined the effort, said Shardul Raval, director of fire and aviation management for the southern region of the U.S. Forest Service. \nSmoke from the fires has made North Carolina's largest city a Code Orange zone for air quality, meaning anyone with breathing problems could suffer. The Charlotte Observer reports that the heavy haze and smoky conditions should make people limit outdoor activities. \nThat apparently isn't stopping organizers of this weekend's Charlotte Marathon. They said Friday that they do not expect the wildfire smoke to impact Saturday's races, which include a marathon, half-marathon, 5K run/walk, marathon relay and a kids 1-mile fun run. component-story-more_media_horiz-v1-01",

      "text": "Bravo. (Cuomo’s Facebook post .) The state of New York has a proud legacy as the progressive capital of the nation, and that is more important today than ever before. As New Yorkers, we have fundamentally different philosophies than what Donald Trump laid out in his campaign. So let me be absolutely clear: If anyone feels that they are under attack, I want them to know that the state of New York — the state that has the Statue of Liberty in its harbor — is their refuge. Whether you are gay or straight, Muslim or Christian, rich or poor, black or white or brown, we respect all people in the state of New York. It’s the very core of what we believe and who we are. But it’s not just what we say, we passed laws that reflect it, and we will continue to do so, no matter what happens nationally. We won’t allow a federal government that attacks immigrants to do so in our state. We are a state of immigrants. We are the state that raised the minimum wage to $15. We are the state that passed Paid Family Leave. We are the state that passed marriage equality. We are New York, and we will stand up for you. And on that, I will never compromise. Count on it.",

      "text": "Carmen Esmeralda Rivera Nevarez (Source: Facebook)\nCarmen Esmeralda Rivera Nevarez was “a happy child who was full of energy and loved to sing, dance, do her makeup and wear high heels,” her aunt, Marisol Navarro, told the Journal on Sunday. “She was like any other little girl – she wanted to grow up way too fast.”\nCarmen, a 10-year-old fourth-grader at Lavaland Elementary School, died just after midnight Saturday when the SUV she was riding in with her family was struck at high speed from behind by a car. Both vehicles overturned.\nCarmen, who her aunt said had been wearing a seat belt, was ejected and pronounced dead at the scene.\nAccording to the criminal complaint, witnesses told police the vehicle that caused the crash on southbound Interstate 25 near Montaño was weaving in and out of traffic lanes as it raced another vehicle and may have hit speeds up to 110 mph.\nXavier Nelson, 22. (MDC)\nAlbuquerque police named Xavier Arthur Nelson, 22, as the driver of the car that caused the crash. Police say they found a bottle of Alprazolam, a sedative, in his pocket during a search. The pill bottle had no label on it, and Nelson refused to make any statements or answer questions, police said.\nNelson was booked into the Metropolitan Detention Center on charges of vehicular homicide and unlawful means of obtaining drugs. He remained in jail Sunday night on a $52,500 bond.\nPolice were still looking for the driver of the car they believe Nelson was racing, possibly in a blue Mustang, according to the criminal complaint.\nCarmen was in the back seat of the SUV along with her 1½-year-old brother, Navarro said. The child’s mother, Mayra Nevarez, was in the front seat along with her partner, Francisco Almeida, who was driving. The adults had just come from their job cleaning office buildings. They sometimes took the children with them, Navarro said.\n“Our family is not doing too good,” she said, adding that they had just held a viewing for the child in Los Lunas at the home of Carmen’s father, Jorge Rivera. “We are all grieving. It’s really hard to lose someone so young and so full of life. You never expect something like this to happen.”\nAnd it shouldn’t have happened, Navarro said, commenting on police reports of suspected racing prior to the crash.\n“He (Nelson) should have been more responsible,” she said.\nPolice reported that Nelson did not make a statement at the time and did not seem intoxicated at the scene. Nelson’s girlfriend declined to comment when reached by phone Sunday night.\nA GoFundMe page for Esmeralda Rivera Funeral Expenses is available at gofundme.com.\nThe Journal’s news partner KOAT contributed to this report.",

Dado Ruvic, Reuters/Illustration \nSAN FRANCISCO - Facebook on Friday announced it has bought startup CrowdTangle, which specializes in tracking hot content on social networks for media agencies and others. \n\"Publishers around the world turn to CrowdTangle to surface stories that matter, measure their social performance and identify influencers,\" a Facebook spokesperson said in an email statement to AFP. \n\"We are excited to work with CrowdTangle to deliver these, and more insights to more publishers.\" \nCrowdTangle confirmed the acquisition in a message at its website, but neither company disclosed financial terms of the deal. \nCrowdTangle said that its technology helps identify stories picking up traction and influential sources as well as their performance on social networks. \nThe startup claimed that thousands of journalists use its tool daily, with its customers around the world including newspapers, television stations, digital media outlets, nonprofits, and sports teams. \nThe list of users at CrowdTangle included Google, BuzzFeed, Vox, the British BBC, RTL Group in Luxembourg, and Switzerland-based media group Ringier. \nCrowdTangle is also used by non-profit groups such as Greenpeace and Unicef, according to its website. \nThe CrowdTangle platform is tailored to spot news that is catching fire at online venues like Facebook, its subsidiary Instagram, and even competitors such as Google-owned YouTube or Twitter. \nThe US startup also provides tools for media to see how much attention its own stories attract and to identify who is sharing their content, according to its website. \nThe CrowdTangle team will continue to run the operation, and the plan was to go on supporting support integration with Twitter, YouTube and other clients. \nFacebook expected CrowdTangle technology to enable it to provide more meaningful insights to publishers at the social network. \nShare",

      "text": "Australian Taxation Office raids Facebook for evidence of dodgy returns Staff writers, news.com.au November 14, 2016 4:09pm \nTHE flashy lifestyles of Australians who report modest incomes to the tax man are being dissected on social media. \nFacebook and Instagram posts flaunting overseas holidays, private schooling and business-class flights will be used to nab tax cheats as part of a crackdown on dodgy returns that understate income. \nThe Australian Taxation Office aims to recoup billions of dollars worth of taxes on undeclared income, with the social media evidence used to complement intelligence gleaned through data matching, The Australian reports. \nSo if your lifestyle doesn’t match the amount you earn on paper, your affairs could be under the microscope. \nAccording to the latest ATO ­annual report, the tax office collected $9.6 billion from “compliance activities last year, more than two-thirds of it for income tax. \nIt prosecuted more than 1300 individuals and 400 companies for offences ranging from noncompliance with lodgement obligations, to making false or misleading claims and keeping false records. \nThere were 21 people convicted and sentenced for serious criminal matters, with penalties ranging from four to 87 months and reparation orders forcing taxpayers to pay back about $4.5 million. \n“We will continue to use more sources and more sophisticated intelligence to target compliance action on those who warrant such action,” ATO Commissioner Chris Jordan said in the report.

      "text": "The broken-down home installation set up by IKEA tells the story of Rana. (Photo: Facebook) The on-going civil war in Syria has ravaged the country almost beyond repair and caused the biggest refugee crisis in recent times. With different types of news and entertainment vying for attention, it can be easier for those living in peaceful areas to forget about the devastation faced by millions of people in some faraway corner of the planet. That’s why popular furniture brand IKEA decided to build a replica of the average Syrian home in its flagship store to raise awareness.\nThe broken-down home installation tells the story of Rana. She has to live in a small apartment constructed out concrete blocks that she shares with her family of nine. The ‘price tags’ attached to the different house objects actually give out information about the disastrous humanitarian situation in Syria.\nIn just two weeks that the display was up, over 80,000 people visited it. The campaign was successfully able to raise 22 million Euros for the Red Cross in Syria, according to AdFreak .",

      "text": "The unexpected victory of Donald Trump in the U.S. presidential election this week has prompted questions over how much voters were swayed by inaccurate or misleading news items shared on Facebook. Facebook Inc said on Friday it would no longer allow certain advertisers to exclude racial or ethnic groups when placing ads on its service, following criticism that the practice was discriminatory.\nThe move comes amid growing scrutiny of how the world's largest online social media network's policies and algorithms shape what content appears in a user's news feed.\nThe unexpected victory of Donald Trump in the U.S. presidential election this week has prompted questions over how much voters were swayed by inaccurate or misleading news items shared on Facebook, mostly in favor of Trump\nFacebook will disable use of the advertising tool, called 'ethnic affinities,' for ads that offer housing, employment and the extension of credit; areas where certain groups have historically faced discrimination, Facebook said in a blog post.\n\"There are many non-discriminatory uses of our ethnic affinity solution in these areas, but we have decided that we can best guard against discrimination by suspending these types of ads,\" Erin Egan, Facebook's chief privacy officer, wrote.\nFacebook collects vast amounts of data on its users, including photographs, allowing it to demographically categorize them in ways that allow advertisers to precisely target content to those they want to reach.\nThe company said it will now use tools that automatically detect and disable ads offering housing, employment or credit that rely on ethnic affinity marketing, Egan said. It will also update its policies to more explicitly require advertisers to not engage in discriminatory advertising.\nThe changes come two weeks after ProPublica, a non-profit investigative news organization, published an article showing how Facebook allowed advertisers to exclude groups on the basis of ethnic affinities, a practice it said may violate federal housing and civil rights laws passed in the 1960s.\nA group of Facebook users filed a lawsuit against the company after the ProPublica report, claiming such ad targeting violated the Fair Housing Act and Civil Rights Act.\nFacebook has attracted criticism in recent months for how it polices several forms of content for its 1.8 billion users, including extremist propaganda, nudity and misleading or inaccurate political articles, which have become known as 'fake news.'\nThe company has been accused by some reporters, political observers and some in Silicon Valley of helping Trump win Tuesday's election by doing little to limit the spread of such items, many from dubious websites, on its service.\nOn Thursday, Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg rejected those claims.\nI think the idea that fake news on Facebook, (which is) a very small amount of the content, influenced the election in any way, is a pretty crazy idea,\" he said at a technology conference in California.",

      "title": "Here's How To Increase Human Energy According To Nikola Tesla",
      "text": "Share on Facebook The most fundamental principle, the basic program of all life, is energy saving. Whatever you do, whatever you like, whatever feels good for you, it's just a psychological response that shows you how to be more energy efficient. Life craves energy and subconsciously you'll always choose the path of least resistance because of that. That's why high calorie food tastes better, that's why whenever your beliefs are questioned you naturally refuse any arguments, that's why people feel more depressed when there is no sunshine outside. All default responses are just energy saving reactions; ‘more calories’ means more energy, changing the structure of your beliefs requires energy, and it's more efficient to do less when you are lacking the energy of the sun. However, a momentary ‘energy waste’ can result in a more sustainable energy consumption in the future. This requires higher levels of intelligence. For this to be achieved we must apply conscious effort in the right time and place. But what is the source of our energy? How can we gain more energy? How can we raise our consciousness and increase our intelligence? Nikola Tesla perfectly concluded what’s the main, most fundamental source of human energy and how to increase our energy and evolve as species. More energy means higher levels of operating power for our consciousness. If you apply time to this ‘equation’ it means that the longer we sustain higher levels of energy for our consciousness, the more intelligence we download from The Universe, the more intelligence we integrate into our being. So What's The Source Of Our Energy? “First let us ask: Whence comes all the motive power? What is the spring that drives all? We see the ocean rise and fall, the rivers flow, the wind, rain, hail, and snow beat on our windows, the trains and steamers come and go; we here the rattling noise of carriages, the voices from the street; we feel, smell, and taste; and we think of all this. And all this movement, from the surging of the mighty ocean to that subtle movement concerned in our thought, has but one common cause. All this energy emanates from one single center, one single source, the sun. The sun is the spring that drives all. The sun maintains all human life and supplies all human energy.” How To Increase The Human Energy? The following answer will make you understand almost everything about Nikola Tesla's lifestyle; why he was vegan; why he was obsessed with free energy; why he despised ignorance and imbeciles; How to increase human energy? There are actually 3 steps. The First Step Is Increasing The Human Mass: In order to increase the energy we have to think in terms of speed. If, let's say, there is a train and you add one more wagon, 3 things can happen. Either the wagon is of the same velocity as the train; in this case the speed of the train will slightly increase . The wagon is with a smaller velocity; in this case the whole train will decrease its speed . Or the wagon is of higher velocity; in this case the whole train will significantly increase its speed . We can think of it like this: ‘If there is a family with children of the same degree of enlightenment as the parents, that is, mass of the “same velocity,” the energy will simply increase proportionately to the number added. If they are less intelligent or advanced, or mass of “smaller velocity,” there will be a very slight gain in the energy; but if they are further advanced, or mass of “higher velocity,” then the new generation will add very considerably to the sum total of human energy.’ In Nikola Tesla's opinion growing muscles is “equivalent to adding mass of “smaller velocity,” and I would not commend it” but moderate exercise “insuring the right balance between mind and body, and the highest efficiency of performance, is, of course, a prime requirement” Food is one of the most important elements of increasing your mass. What we consider as food is just processed sunlight. Plants, with their photosynthesis, combine carbon, hydrogen and oxygen and bind them through sunlight, forming the CHO molecule (fat) we consume through food and burn for energy. However, the actual energy comes from freeing the photons of light between the chemical bond. That's what produces heat. That's what gives calories, stored photons. We eat sunlight for energy! Fruits, Vegetables, Meat, everything that we eat consumed the CHO molecules that the plants created. The energy that we consume through food is actually the same sunlight that plants used to forge these elements together. If we eat meat, we are consuming already consumed, unused CHO, as the only place that CHO comes is from photosynthesis. It's second hand CHO in a way. Consuming CHO directly from plants, fruits and vegetables is certainly equivalent to adding mass of “higher velocity,” “It is certainly preferable to raise vegetables, and I think, therefore, that vegetarianism is a commendable departure from the established barbarous habit. That we can subsist on plant food and perform our work even to advantage is not a theory, but a well-demonstrated fact. Many races living almost exclusively on vegetables are of superior physique and strength. There is no doubt that some plant food, such as oatmeal, is more economical than meat, and superior to it in regard to both mechanical and mental performance.” Nikola Tesla says. The consumption of second hand food is one of the main limits we put on ourselves for evolving as a race into more intelligent, kind and less animal like species. “To free ourselves from animal instincts and appetites, which keep us down, we should begin at the very root from which we spring: we should effect a radical reform in the character of the food.” Nikola Tesla continues. “Gambling, business rush, and excitement, particularly on the exchanges, are causes of much mass reduction” “Whisky, wine, tea coffee, tobacco, and other such stimulants are responsible for the shortening of the lives of many, and ought to be used with moderation. But I do not think that rigorous measures of suppression of habits followed through many generations are commendable. It is wiser to preach moderation than abstinence.” To conclude: Consume food that's closer to the sun, avoid unnecessary enlargements of your body that'll use more energy, avoid energy wasting habits and unhealthy addictions that serve solely to your ego. Each man who practices these advices adds a ‘wagon’ with higher velocity to the ‘human train’ we all move. The Second Step Is Reducing The Force That's Retarding The Human Mass: “The force which retards the onward movement of man is partly frictional and partly negative. To illustrate this distinction I may name, for example, ignorance, stupidity, and imbecility as some of the purely frictional forces, or resistances devoid of any directive tendency. On the other hand, visionariness, insanity, self-destructive tendency, religious fanaticism, and the like, are all forces of a negative character, acting in definite directions. To reduce or entirely overcome these dissimilar retarding forces, radically different methods must be employed. One knows, for instance, what a fanatic may do, and one can take preventive measures, can enlighten, convince, and, possibly direct him, turn his vice into virtue; but one does not know, and never can know, what a brute or an imbecile may do, and one must deal with him as with a mass, inert, without mind, let loose by the mad elements. A negative force always implies some quality, not infrequently a high one, though badly directed, which it is possible to turn to good advantage; but a directionless, frictional force involves unavoidable loss. Evidently, then, the first and general answer to the above question is: turn all negative force in the right direction and reduce all frictional force. “ Simply said, frictional force is ignorant, directionless, without a quality unlike the negative force which carries high quality but in a wrong direction. Frictional force will, most of the time, result only in energy loss no matter where it is directioned, while negative force can lead to significant increase of human energy if focused towards a proper, strategic direction.“There can be no doubt that, of all the frictional resistances, the one that most retards human movement is ignorance. Not without reason said that man of wisdom, Buddha: “Ignorance is the greatest evil in the world.” The friction which results from ignorance, and which is greatly increased owing to the numerous languages and nationalities, can be reduced only by the spread of knowledge and the unification of the heterogeneous elements of humanity. No effort could be better spent.” Nikola Tesla concludes. Individually, this can be explained as maintaining constructive balance between our talents and flaws; establishing peace between our darkness and light and uniting them towards a mutual, greater goal. This, of course, needs to be accompanied with learning, curiosity and reducing individual ignorance about The Universe around us. Cleansing your chakras is as essential as taking a bath in the context of reducing the force that's retarding your energy. Allowing energy to flow freely through your own body ensures a reduction in friction. It decreases the waste of your energy with fighting the negative emotions that are clogging your energy pools. According to Nikola Tesla war should not be terminated suddenly as this can result in something worse than war. “War is a negative force, and cannot be turned in a positive direction without passing through, the intermediate phases. It is a problem of making a wheel, rotating one way, turn in the opposite direction without slowing it down, stopping it, and speeding it up again the other way.” We shouldn't stop war, but redirect it towards a mutual goal of humanity. For example, instead of fighting ourselves, we can redirect our energy towards exploration of different parts of our galaxy. Of course, gently and gradually, with great maintenance. “It is doubtful whether men who would not be ready to fight for a high principle would be good for anything at all” Nikola Tesla explains why war is not a frictional force but one of a negative character. In his views, the future of war should result in reduction of man power exchanged for machines that will take the hit. To see how this can happen we must see how everything began. It started with the law of the strongest where physically weaker men were thrown completely to the mercy of physically stronger men. However, the weaker men developed intelligence due to their energy efficiency and developed ways to use stones, sticks and make weapons. Today wars are held by men who smoke cigars, sitting in a room, completely controlling physical forces with their intelligence. The future will make the intelligence create machines and control them instead of men, until war is mainly intellectual and the physical factor is completely irrelevant. To conclude: Use your talents to guide your flaws. Find peace and eliminate forces of friction with reason, within you and around yourself. The Third Step Is To Increase The Force Accelerating The Human Mass: “Of the three possible solutions of the main problem of increasing human energy, this is by far the most important to consider, not only because of its intrinsic significance, but also because of its intimate bearing on all the many elements and conditions which determine the movement of humanity.” How do you increase the force that's moving the human mass? Simply, spend more energy and spend it towards the most efficient possible direction. Our world is driven by machinery under a system created by our motive power. The mass of people is not moving chaotically but systematically, following an order like a clockwork. If we decrease our motive power we'll, unintentionally, be imprisoned by the same system we alone have created. That's why increasing the motive power is key in increasing the human energy. Constantly increasing the motive power will result in a constant increase of human energy. “Motive power means work. To increase the force accelerating human movement means, therefore, to perform more work.” says Nikola Tesla. But how can one man increase his energy constantly? Will there not be a point when the man cannot do more work? Will there not be a point when doing more work becomes harmful to the man, even unhealthy? There is a secret. When a man applies his effort so that, when coming into effect it will be in the direction of the collective human movement, the effort becomes most efficient and with less energy more is achieved. This means that as more people do more work towards a mutual goal, as more is achieved with less effort resulting in increase of mutual energy. Think of it like spinning a wheel. At first, for only a fragment of its potential speed you need a lot of effort and energy to even start moving the wheel. As you start moving the wheel and applying effort in the direction of its movement, as less effort it demands and as faster it keeps spinning. In the end, with less effort than it was demanded from you to move the wheel an inch, you spin it countless times faster. The same is with human energy! The secret of energy is that it is eternal in The Universe where almost nothing is. Your energy, no matter where you spent it, will forever stay and spread out if not directioned. That's why it's crucially important to focus your effort. As you spend your energy towards one direction, with time this energy will accumulate and less effort and energy you'll need to achieve a lot more. This is true globally and individually. “Another answer we have now found to the above great question: To increase the force accelerating human movement means to turn to the uses of man more of the sun's energy.” Imagine what we can accomplish if we all focus our efforts toward creating more sustainable ways of generating energy; cleaning the earth; reducing hunger; finding solutions for interstellar travel; educating; To conclude: Focusing your motive power and effort on one goal, towards the right direction of movement, will accelerate the velocity with which you move closer to your goal. With time, you'll spend less effort and achieve more. Conclusion: To gain your energy from the right sources means you gain more energy from less; reducing the retarding factors means you have less friction that wastes your energy; focusing your motive power towards the direction of the collective human movement means you use others' energy to boost your energy. Gain more energy, waste less energy, spend the energy so next time you'll need less to achieve more. Increase human mass, reduce retarding force, and increase the force accelerating the human mass. Follow this process with reason. Gain more, waste less, spend efficiently, learn. That's the secret formula for increasing the collective human energy according to the great mind of Nikola Tesla. That's how we raise our intelligence and evolve as species.",

      "title": "4 Facebook Mobile Ad Techniques That Work",
      "text": "Are you looking for ways to reach people on their mobile devices? \nAre your Facebook mobile ads working? \nFacebook has tools to help you create compelling ads that enhance your mobile marketing efforts. \nIn   four ways to improve results from your mobile Facebook ad campaigns . 4 Facebook Mobile Ad Techniques That Work by Stefan Des   #1: Start a Conversation With Messenger Destination Ads \nFacebook has developed ads that drive people from their news feed to a chat through Messenger. \nThese Messenger destination ads include a call-to-action (CTA) button that links directly to Messenger . The principle is simple: Once people click your ad, they’re redirected to a chatbot that appears with a welcome message through which you can give further instructions. \nIf you sell goods or services that require a long purchasing process, you may find this new ad product useful. In fact, in such cases, people may need to get in touch with you several times before deciding to buy anything. \nFor example, if you offer financial services or run a nurturing campaign, chatting with potential customers may be significant in setting up an appointment or closing a sale. Start a conversation with customers in Messenger with a Facebook destination ad. \nWith every Messenger destination ad campaign, you can target people through interests, behaviors , and more. It may be even more effective to combine these ads with a retargeting strategy . You can create custom audiences for people who have visited a specific page on your website , such as your sales pages, without buying anything. #2: Simplify Signups With Facebook Lead Ads \nFacebook’s lead ads are particularly effective in generating leads, as they allow people to subscribe in just two clicks . \nA traditional Facebook ad campaign redirects users to a landing page on your website, where they can complete a subscription form. In this case, your website’s loading time is crucial, because potential customers could leave before opting in. According to Dynatrace and Akamai surveys, 50% of website visitors expect sites to load within 2 seconds, and if they don’t load within 3 seconds, people will abandon the process. \nFacebook lead ads are specifically designed for mobile traffic and you don’t need a landing page to generate leads. Instead, when people click your ad, Facebook will automatically populate the opt-in form with their data , making the signup process simple and fast. When users click on a lead ad, Facebook autopopulates their information in the form to make the signup process easier. \nThe downside to Facebook lead ads is that any contacts you collect during your advertising campaign are placed in a CSV file inside your Facebook page’s publishing tools . This means that each time you log in, you’ll need to upload this data to your CRM or ESP system. \nIt’s a time-consuming task that can decrease the quality of your leads proportionally with any increased time it takes to contact them back. #3: Create an Immersive Experience With Canvas Ads \nFacebook created canvas ads to help marketers increase engagement on mobile devices. However, when Facebook first rolled them out, many people thought the ads met the needs of only big businesses and enterprises. The reality is that canvas ads can be profitable for small businesses and solopreneurs too. \nFacebook canvas ads provide an in-depth, fast-loading experience for mobile users . You can combine videos, still images, and CTA buttons and create attractive landing pages inside Facebook that load in a fraction of a second. These ads offer a mobile user experience that a website can’t provide. \nHere’s an example of a Facebook canvas ad from TOMS. Note how quickly the landing page opens. . \nThanks to canvas ads, you can propose more effective landing pages to increase brand awareness, generate leads, and boost sales. #4: Target Only Mobile Website Visitors With Ads \nIt doesn’t matter if your website is 100% responsive; when people visit it through their mobile devices, they always miss something, including crucial information or CTAs. \nTo increase your ROI on campaigns, run specific campaigns for people who surf your site through mobile . There’s a technique you can use to convert these users into leads and customers, while reducing your marketing budget and timing: \nWhen creating a new audience on Facebook, click Custom Combination to define a custom audience from website traffic . Then add your URL and select only mobile users . Create a Facebook custom audience to target ads to mobile users who have visited your website. \nFrom here, create a new campaign and ad set, and select your new custom audience as the target for your ads. Thanks to this retargeting tactic, you can set up more effective campaigns that target mobile users who already know you but haven’t completed your desired action. \nConclusion \nWe’re at the beginning of a new advertising age. Facebook’s total expected revenue for 2016 will be around $25 billion, and nearly 80% of Facebook’s revenue already comes from mobile advertising. According to Internet Live Stats , in the time it took you to read this article, 100 smartphones were purchased worldwide in comparison to only 10 personal computers. \nIf you’re running traditional Facebook ad campaigns that drive users to landing pages, it could be a reason why your marketing efforts are getting harder. Fortunately, Facebook is creating new products that can help you optimize marketing campaigns on mobile devices. \nAs Facebook says, mobile is not a technology; it’s a behavior. Rather than simply investing in mobile, you need to create a mobile funnel that fits this behavior. \nWith the tools mentioned above, you can run marketing campaigns that increase leads and sales without even using your website, which is the biggest problem for mobile advertisers right now. \nAs a smart marketer, don’t forget to use split tests, enjoy the new advertising age, and keep an eye on new products Facebook is developing for mobile advertising. \nWhat do you think? Do you use some of these tactics for mobile ads? What tips can you share? Feel free to leave a comment and ask questions concerning these techniques. I’ll be glad to help you apply them to your advertising strategy! 4 Facebook Mobile Ad Techniques That Work by Stefan Des  ",

      "text": "What my Facebook thinks of the new US president A closer look at how millennials reacted to the news of Donald Trump’s presidency Did Donald get a Facebook like from South African millenials? Er, not... \nImage Credits: Pixabay.com / tiburi At 10 am last Wednesday morning the world seemed to stop. Donald Trump, a man famous for his pussy grabbing, wall building and hate baiting rhetoric became president of the United States of America. Facebook was quick to react. It seems that millenial South Africans were either in shock and disbelief, or quick to make light of the situation. I can’t help but wonder if years of our own political scandal has made us immune to the scandals of other nations. Many South Africans were quick to point out that perhaps today isn’t such a bad day to be South African. Communicated under this thin veiled humour was a very real outrage at the election result. It seems that for many people America has made a clear declaration. The American dream is only a dream for those who look, love and think in the same way. Today the many nameless homophobes, racists and sexists are allowed to wear a face. Today it is perfectly okay for a man with no experience to take office instead of a women who has spent her entire life preparing for the job, today many minorities have been told that there safety and their interests is sacrificial in the great American experiment. To many it seemed especially ironic that a country that has taken many real and progressive steps in the last decade could unravel it all within a single year. That the same country who has voted for marriage equality and the election of their first black president could make an almost literal U-turn. And while all of the drama is played out on a stage very far away it seems that many people have begun to ask themselves if this is what the future looks like. For the most part many people have begun to wonder what exactly lead our society to this point at all. Also Read…",

      "text": "Facebook How to Memorialise or Delete Your Facebook Account After Your Die \nFacebook recently “killed off” many of its members as it rolled out a new feature that allows users to determine what happens to their Facebook account after they die. This new feature allows users to set a designated contact that can reach out to Facebook after you pass away to let them know. \nFrom there, the choices you made before you die on what happens to your account will go into effect. Right now, can choose to memorialize your Facebook account or permanently delete it. \nDeath is an undeniable reality and it’s always better to be prepared. This guide essentially answers the question: “What happens to my Facebook Account After I die?” This is equivalent to a digital will that you leave behind. This is one feature that Facebook should have introduced much earlier. \nThere are basicallay 2 things that can be done to a persons Facebook Account after they pass away. Your “legacy contact” (explained below) can either memorialize your Facebook Account or delete it, based on your wishes. Memorializing Your Facebook Profile After You Die \nBy memorializing your Facebook account, you allow it to continue to function to remember you. This allows family and friends to leave messages and tweaks the account in subtle ways. \nOnly those connected with you already on Facebook will be able to comment on the page, the word “Remembering” will be placed next to your name, and all content shared on your page will still be shared with those connected to you. Your profile will no longer show up as a birthday or memory remind to those who have friended you. \nTo setup your account’s profile to be memorialized after you pass, login to Facebook and go to “Settings.” \nThen, click on “Legacy Contact.” \nEnter a family or friend you trust as your Legacy Contact, then click “Add.” This person must be on Facebook for this to work. This person should have access to key documents after you pass away that they will be required to give Facebook to prove you passed away and that memorialization should occur. Deleting Your Facebook Profile After You Die \nBy deleting your Facebook profile after you die, you simply erase yourself from the social network site. Depending on how you used Facebook, you may not want to memorialize yourself or keep your profile standing. That’s where deleting the profile comes into play.",

One count has about 30-million accounts affected. \nIt even affected CEO Mark Zuckerburg, whose page read \"Remembering Mark.\" It didn’t take long after that to get the glitch fixed. \nSocial media users were having a field day with the mistake \n— Alexia Tsotsis (@alexia) November 11, 2016 Listen to us anywhere on iHeartRadio at http://www.iheart.com/live/2073 ",

Unlike the philosophical classic 'if a tree falls in the wood and nobody is around to hear it, does it make a sound?', this has an answer that'll leave you marginally satisfied. Okay, so Samuel was born first, but his twin brother Ronan is older. How? Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Was this some kind of Matrix-style birth? Did these children break the space-time continuum while in the womb? Is anything even real? Well, when you've stopped your mind from swirling, the answer will be waiting for you below. GIF Ah, there you are. Ready for the answer? It's all because the clocks went back. Duh. Samuel Peterson was born on 1.39am on Sunday, November 6. His brother Ronan, meanwhile, was born 31 minutes later, but by then daylight saving hours had ended, and the clock was turned back one hour. So while Ronan was in a sense born at 2.10am on November 6, his official time of birth is actually 1.10am. Cape Cod Healthcare posted the bizarro birth onto their Facebook page, which has been 'liked' over 1,000 times. Seth Peterson, the father, told the hospital: \"I said earlier that night that they were either going to be born on two different days or the time change was going to come into play.\" Apparently Seth over here is some kind of seer, which we'll be sure to keep an eye on, but the biggest question remains: what is time, and will this cosmic concept ever truly stand still?

      "text": "Breitbart ^ | 11/24/16 | CHRISS W. STREET \nPosted on 11/14/2016 7:53:12 AM PST by Enlightened1 After a year of Facebook scandals for bias in its trending “ News Feed ” against conservatives, CEO Mark Zuckerberg is now being attacked by the Left for allowing negative stories to appear that supposedly cost Democrat Hillary Clinton the presidency. \nThe Left is spitting mad that Donald Trump won the presidency. Rather than accept the vote of the people, progressives are lashing out at Facebook for not doing enough to stop the proliferation of what they call “ fake news ” about Hillary Clinton regarding Benghazi, handling of emails and the probability of her being indicted by the FBI. \nLashing out against Facebook got so intense that Zuckerberg in his keynote speech for Techonomy16 that opened the day after the election, responded that Facebook is always trying to improve the quality of the News Feed experience . But he also stated: \n“Personally, I think the idea that fake news on Facebook, of which it’s a very small amount of the content, influenced the election in any way is a pretty crazy idea.” \nFacebook has triumphed in casting its trending News Feed as the main-stream-media for the 21 st Century. According to the Pew Research Center, 66 percent of Facebook’s 156.5 million U.S. users now get the majority of their daily news from the site. \nThe company suffered a major scandal in May, when a former journalist at News Feed, told the Gizmodo web site that he and other Facebook staff members routinely suppressed news stories of interest to conservative readers from the social network’s influential “trending” news feed section.

      "text": "Facebook wants to help improve Messenger bots CNET 5 hrs ago Richard Nieva © Provided by CNET Mark Zuckerberg, el presidente ejecutivo de Facebook, presenta algunos de los 40 socios con bots - los programas de software de inteligencia artificial - actualmente en Messenger. Facebook wants to give the bots a jolt.\nEarlier this year at F8, the social network's most important conference, CEO Mark Zuckerberg detailed a big investment in chatbots, which use artificial intelligence to allow people to text with the software to help them do things like schedule calendar meetings or buy a pair of shoes.\nNow Facebook wants to help software developers who create bots make them better. On Monday, the company said it would bring free analytics tools to its Facebook Messenger platform , where the bots live.\nThe company says businesses have built more than 33,000 bots on Messenger. With the new tools, bot makers will be able to measure the demographics of bot users, like age, gender, education level, relationship status, household income or retail spending. But Facebook emphasized the information is anonymous and in aggregate.\nWhat that means for you, a Facebook Messenger user, is that maybe the bots will get a little smarter, and bot makers may be able to tailor the software better to the people using them.\nFacebook is making a big bet that people would rather text with a bot than call a customer service line when they need help from a business. And recently, more apps, like one called Octane AI and another called Chatfuel , have popped up that offer DIY tools to let anyone make a chatbot on Facebook Messenger.\nFacebook also said Monday that it is accepting bot developers to its FBStart program, which helps early stage mobile startups grow their apps.\nGo to MSN Home",

      "text": "iStock Like us on Facebook \nThe greatest migrations in the animal kingdom now inspire great migrations of people, who travel from all corners of the globe to watch nature’s most spectacular journeys unfold. Here are nine epic treks that every wildlife enthusiast should witness in person. 1. THE MARCH OF THE CARIBOU \nThese antlered mammals really get around. In fact, the longest annual migrations of any land mammal on earth are made by certain caribou herds near the Arctic circle. Every March, 169,000 members of the Porcupine herd, for example, collectively leave their winter homes in the southern parts of the Brooks mountain range and Yukon territory. Over several weeks, they slowly trod up to the Coastal Plain in northeastern Alaska, where females calve from late May to early June. Once autumn arrives, the caribou make an equally amazing return journey southwards. When all is said and done, the herbivores can cover more than 3000 miles per year . \nIf you’d like to witness this miracle of nature for yourself, just know that the experience won’t be cheap. Up there, the terrain is both rough and remote—plus, the caribou don’t always follow the exact same pathways every year. Rather than try and plan out a route all by yourself, it makes sense to find an organized tour group . A handful of companies offer caribou package deals: for a $3000 to $6000 fee, they’ll set you up with some food, camping equipment, basic supplies, and a seasoned guide who will help you navigate the terrain. Most of these tours will last for about a week, although longer ones do exist. By the way, space is usually limited, so you’ll want to reserve your spot ASAP. 2. CRAWLING WITH THE CRABS. \nChristmas Island is a tiny landmass in the Indian Ocean that boasts a human population of around 2500. The Australian territory is also home to some 14 different terrestrial crab species, including fist-sized Christmas Island red crabs. Here, the forest floors are absolutely teeming with the crimson crustaceans, as more than 120 million inhabit the island in total. Unlike many of their seagoing relatives, adult Christmas Island red crabs live exclusively on dry land, where they dine on leaves, fruits, flowers, seedlings, and the occasional dead animal. \nThough they live on land, instinct drives the little animals towards the beaches once a year, where they spawn en masse according to the phases of the moon . The trek coincides with the onset of the wet season in October, November, and December. Visit Christmas Island during those months, and you’re pretty much guaranteed to see millions of red crabs blanketing just about every backyard, train track, and roadway in sight. 3. THE TIMELESS SPECTACLE OF A SALMON RUN. \nBaby Pacific salmon hatch in freshwater streams and then swim out into the ocean. Two to seven years later, the ones that still survive ( usually ) return to their birthplaces as mature adults, swimming against currents as they go. Those who don’t get eaten by some predator along the way will arrive at the final destination and spawn. Once they’ve procreated, the fish die, leaving their decomposing bodies behind to help nourish the next generation. \nFishermen call this return journey a “salmon run.” These mainly occur between the months of September and November. From central Alaska to the San Francisco Bay area , the Pacific Northwest is loaded with streams where visitors can catch a real-life salmon run in all its fishy glory. A few locales, like Piper’s Creek in Seattle, are even patrolled by trained volunteers who field questions from tourists about the tenacious salmon that pass through. Should you find yourself in this region of North America during the crisp autumn months, ask around and see if there’s a spawning stream near you. 4. WILDEBEEST ON THE MOVE. \nOn a continent that includes ancient pyramids and a 19,341-foot dormant volcano, this still manages to be one of the most impressive sights you’ll ever behold. Each year, 1.5 million wildebeest —along with 200,000 zebras and scores of antelopes—embark upon a journey that spans some 150,000 square miles. The trek begins in Tanzania’s Serengeti National Park, where female wildebeest give birth during the wet period that spans from January to March. Around May, the local plains begin to dry up, which prompts huge herds of wildebeest to amble north to their favorite pastures in the Masai Mara National Reserve in Kenya. Here the wildebeest remain until the rains drive them southward, usually at some point in October or November. \nBy no means is the excursion a pleasant one. Roughly 250,000 wildebeest die from illness or sheer fatigue along the way. Lions, leopards, cheetahs, and hyenas relentlessly harass the herds on every leg of their trek. And then there’s the fact that—in order to get from point A to point B—the wildebeest must brave the crocodile-infested Grumeti and Mara Rivers. \nTourists who need a place to stay while they observe the migration can take advantage of the numerous safari lodges available at the Masai Mara National Reserve and Serengeti National Park. Campsites, complete with tents on wooden platforms, are also available for more adventurous individuals. 5. ELEPHANT SEALS FIND LOVE ON CALIFORNIA BEACH. \nNorthern elephant seals are so named because the male of this species produces long-range noises with an inflatable, trunk-like sack on his snout. Yet its strange appearance isn’t the creature’s only claim to fame. Elephant seals are also known for their twice -yearly migrations that span vast distances. \nInterestingly, the two sexes have different starting points. From March to June and from July to November, males hunt for squid and fish off the coasts of the Aleutian Islands. Meanwhile, the females do their hunting up to 800 miles further south. In one calendar year, both sexes will make two trips to the warm, sunny beaches of California and northern Mexico. The first of these takes place between December and March, during which time dominant males stake out their territories before impregnating as many as 50 individual partners. By January, the female seals will have given birth and started mating again. Once the pups are old enough to fend for themselves in April, the adults make their way back to the north Atlantic—for a while anyway. Later in the spring or summer, these fully-grown pinnipeds haul themselves back onto the same warm weather beaches. This time, though, their objective isn’t breeding, but molting [ PDF ]. When all is said and done, males and females will, respectively, spend around 250 and 300 days per year out in the open ocean . \nTo catch the tail end of an elephant seal migration, consider a visit to Point Reyes National Seashore in Marin County, California. From the safety of an overlook, visitors to this admission-free park can observe a newly-assembled breeding colony in December, January, February, and March. Please be sure to keep your distance, however: Walking within 100 feet of a wild elephant seal is strictly prohibited. 6. WAYWARD CRANES TAKE OVER NEBRASKA. \nFor two months out of every year, a 75-mile section of the Platte River in central Nebraska hosts over 500,000 sandhill cranes . To them, it’s a nice pit stop. Although there are a few nonmigratory populations of this species in Mississippi and Florida, most sandhill cranes travel great distances as the seasons change. An estimated 80 percent of those living in North America spend their winters in Mexico and the southern U.S. Then, beginning in mid-February, the cranes make their way up north. During their trip, half a million of these birds collectively touch down on the Platte River’s many sandbars. Famished, the cranes waste little time in plucking unharvested grains from nearby cornfields. By April, the birds have regained enough strength to complete the final leg of their journey. With newfound energy, these broad-winged travelers take off for the species’ traditional breeding grounds in Canada, Alaska, Minnesota, Oregon, Idaho, Wisconsin, and Michigan. \nNaturally, the chance to gaze upon 500,000 cranes is irresistible to birdwatchers. Kearney, Nebraska —the self-proclaimed “sandhill crane capital of the world”—offers many free viewing areas for visiting nature enthusiasts. Those who would like to snag first-rate snapshots can pay a visit to the nearby Ian Nicholson Audubon Center at Rowe Sanctuary, where special “ photographers crane tours ” are offered. 7. LAND OF LINCOLN TURNS INTO A SNAKE-LOVER’S DELIGHT. \nTo anyone who adores reptiles and amphibians, Shawnee National Forest can feel like heaven on earth. Located in southern Illinois, the forest contains gorgeous limestone bluffs which reach heights of up to 150 feet. Every winter, scores of snakes, turtles, frogs, toads, and salamanders find shelter in the rock faces. Once spring arrives with its warmer temperatures, the creatures begin to stir. Abandoning the bluffs, these animals migrate down to the lush swamps that lie elsewhere in the park. However, getting to them involves crossing a stretch of LaRue Road, a clearing that’s normally frequented by cars. \nFor decades, this was a recipe for roadkill. Realizing that vehicular traffic posed a significant threat to Shawnee’s wildlife, the Forest Service took action in 1972 by starting the biannual practice of temporarily closing off a 2.5-mile stretch of LaRue Road [ PDF ]. Nicknamed “Snake Road,” this section is off-limits to vehicles for three weeks every spring and another three weeks in the fall. Since then, it’s gotten even more reptile-friendly. Nowadays, Snake Road is a car-free zone from March 15 to May 15 and again from September 1 to October 30. \nFortunately, the section is always open to foot traffic. Eco-tourists and herpetology buffs from across the country descend on Snake Road during every migration, hoping to encounter 35 of Illinois’s 39 native snake species here, including cottonmouths, copperheads, and ringneck snakes. 8. MONARCH BUTTERFLIES PUT ON A ROYAL DISPLAY. \nOf the roughly 20,000 butterfly species in existence, only one is known to embark upon a two-way migration . Monarch butterflies that reside in Canada and the northern U.S. breed during the summer, then fly south to escape the harsh winters. During the autumn months, butterflies that live east of the Rocky Mountains make their way to central Mexico. Meanwhile, monarchs that breed in the west overwinter down in California. Upon springtime’s return, the butterflies re-migrate northwards. Sadly, they don’t make it all the way back: After arriving in the southern U.S., monarchs lay their eggs on milkweed and die. It’s then up to the resultant offspring to journey north and, eventually, start the whole cycle over again. Each generation travels a bit farther north than the last; it can take three or four generations to reach the northern United States and Canada. \nIf you live west of the Rockies, the best way to see a kaleidoscope of traveling monarchs is to make a beeline for California. From the Coronado Butterfly Preserve in Santa Barbara County to South Beach’s El Dorado Nature Center, the Golden State is chock full of publicly-accessible monarch wintering locations. Meanwhile, the butterflies have become big business in Mexico, where more than a few monarch-themed tours now exist. 9. POLAR BEARS NEGOTIATE SOME THIN ICE. \nAlthough you might not peg them as the migrating type, polar bears do in fact make annual pilgrimages. Each summer, as sea ice melts in bays and near various shorelines, the ursids amble inland. Since they can’t hunt seals or similar prey items very efficiently there, the bears are forced to draw upon their fat reserves until that oceanic ice starts coming back later in the year. \nOn Canada’s Hudson Bay every fall, groups of polar bears gather around a little town called Churchill, where they eagerly await the bay’s returning sea ice. Enter the Tundra Buggy . A kind of white, bus-like vehicle with raised tires, these rigs are utilized by the local wildlife tourism company Frontiers North Adventures. Taking advantage of polar bear migration habits, the organization offers patrons the chance to get a close look at the famous predators in the late fall—from the safety of an essentially bear-proof car.

      "text": "Want to see the latest flight deals as soon as they’re published? Follow The Points Guy on Facebook and Twitter , and subscribe to text message alerts from our deals feed, @ tpg_alerts . \nAirfare deals are typically only available on limited dates. We recommend that you use Google Flights to find dates to fly, then book through an online travel agency, such as Orbitz or Expedia , which allows you to cancel flights without penalty by 11pm Eastern Time within one day of booking. However, if you’re using the American Express Platinum Card , you’ll need to book directly with the airline or through Amex Travel portal to get 5x MR points . Remember: Fares may disappear quickly, so book right away and take advantage of Orbitz or Expedia’s courtesy cancellation if you’re unable to get the time away from work or family. \nLondon and Paris are the quintessential cities for tourists looking for a European getaway, though often it can be very expensive to fly across the Atlantic. Fortunately, Norwegian is offering excellent fares from New York (JFK) to both London (LGW) and Paris (CDG) as well as from Boston (BOS) to London (LGW) starting from just $327 round-trip. There’s decent availability for departures from December through March 2017, but these flights don’t operate on a daily schedule, so you may have to be a bit more flexible with your travel dates. Also note that if you use Google Flights, you’ll have to book using the site’s separate tickets feature to lock in these low prices.\nKeep in mind that Norwegian is a low-cost carrier and will charge you for certain things that are not typically an additional cost on other airlines. However, even with these extra fees , the total cost is still significantly lower than what other carriers are charging for similar flights. These flights are operated by Norwegian’s fantastic 787 Dreamliner .\nAirline: Norwegian\nRoute: BOS, JFK — LGW, CDG\nCost: $327 round-trip in economy\nDates: December — March 2017\nBooking Link: Orbitz or Expedia \nPay With: The Platinum Card from American Express ( 5x on airfare ), Chase Sapphire Reserve , Premier Rewards Gold Card from American Express , Citi Prestige (3x on airfare) or Chase Sapphire Preferred (2x on travel)\nHere are a few examples of what you can book:\nBoston (BOS) to London (LGW) for $327 round-trip in February: \n\n\nNew York (JFK) to London (LGW) for $381 round-trip in March: \n\n\nNew York (JFK) to Paris (CDG) for $369 round-trip over Valentine’s Day: \n\n\nMaximize Your Purchase \nDon’t forget to use a credit card that earns additional points on airfare purchases, such as the American Express Platinum Card ( 5x on flights booked directly with airlines or American Express Travel ), Chase Sapphire Reserve , American Express Premier Rewards Gold or Citi Prestige (3x on airfare) or the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card (2x on all travel purchases).

By the Way, Former BOB 94.9 Staffer, \"Harvey Taylor,\" getting the credit for this post. 6 hours ago share Woke up late and had to rush through the morning routine in order to get to the station on time to catch the train. The boy was not cooperating and missed his morning hug. Standing on the platform, waiting for the train, I was in a grey mood. Not mad, not depressed, just a dull colorless feeling that I could tell was shared by others standing there with me. As it happened, I glanced to my left, northward up the tracks, in the direction that my train would come. The sun had just cleared the horizon. Golden light began to reflect off the trees, most of which still held their leaves. A burst of colors in red, burnt orange, yellow and even green lit up the track as it bended around the corner out of sight. The steel rails reflected the brilliance of it all, with a blue sky illuminating it all from above. That's when it hit me. It's God's world after all. His hand is on everything, including a simple sunrise. A moment that served to remind me that He is in control. I've been chided this past week for saying that everything will be alright. And, I understand why people are upset that I might say it, and why they might call me naive. But I believe it with every fibre of my being. Because God has this. It's not going to be easy, and there will be plenty of evil to contend with, in many forms. And, there will be division and pain before it gets better. But have faith, dear friends. it will get better. As sure as the sun rises. Life is hard. But it remains good today... Contact ",

      "text": "By Taryn Hillin \nApparently women can’t do anything without makeup. While perusing Facebook this past weekend, an ad popped up on my feed for Sweat Cosmetics, a makeup line made specifically for working out. I had never heard of this company or their products, but anyone who tells me to wear makeup while I work out is not my friend. \nSo I did what any annoyed person on the internet does and I googled some s**t. It turns out Sweat was founded by ex-professional soccer players whose dream in life was to show that women could be “ both strong and beautiful. ” I never thought those two concepts were mutually exclusive, but then again, I’ve never felt the need to wear lipstick on a treadmill, either. \nSweat’s promo videos feature the gaggle of blonde women who work for the company powdering their faces while running, snowboarding, weightlifting, and riding a stationary bike. In one video , a soft voice-over says that the modern woman is “brave, powerful and strong, but above all else she is beautiful.” In another , one of the founders says, “We wanna tell every woman that uses our product that we see your struggle.” Um, what struggle is that exactly? The struggle to be beautiful every second of every day, even when I am sweating my ass off? Yeah, I didn’t actually think that was even a thing until I saw your ad, but thanks. \nHere’s why this product is infuriating: If you are a woman ( or man ) and want to wear makeup to the gym, wear makeup to the gym. People have worn makeup and worked out for quite some time: gymnasts, dancers, women hitting the gym on their way home from work, and that chick on the treadmill taking 5 million selfies. It’s cool. Be you. But what I don’t like are companies acting like they are building women up, when really, they’re trying to create a need that never needed to be filled. For decades, beauty companies have told women they are not pretty enough, or skinny enough, or feminine enough, and that they need some product to fix what’s wrong with them. From corsets to diet pills to high heels , these products are supposed to help women look better (for empowerment!) when in reality they keep us in uncomfortable—and often unhealthy—chains. \nNow, that racket is bleeding into the gym, the one place where women can get dirty because they’re supposed to be dirty. The space where bleeding is a sign of strength and not weakness . Indeed, athletics is one of the few spaces where, ideally, being respected has nothing to do with how you look and everything to do with how well you perform. Call me crazy but I don’t want to give that up just yet. \nBefore you roll your eyes at me, I understand that not everyone is as serious about working out (or feminism) as I am. Not everyone goes to the gym for the same reasons I do. I know that some people go there to blow off steam, or find dates, or meet up with friends. And I get that some women just love makeup and want to wear it all the time, like a favorite scarf or necklace. But all of those options are still available. You can wear makeup to the gym already. No one is stopping you. \nBut if “workout makeup” ever becomes a thing the way high heels became a thing, women will start feeling pressure to wear makeup to the gym, which means we’ll have to buy cosmetics for work and for Saturday night and for spin class. What’s next? Makeup for the shower? “Hate how gross your face looks when it’s wet?” the commercials will say. “Yuck! Buy this special shower makeup so no one has to look at your unvarnished face ever again.” It’s too much. \nUnfortunately, that future is actually possible because Sweat isn’t the only company trying to make “workout makeup” happen. Birchbox, a monthly subscription service that mails makeup to your door, now offers a beauty brand called Arrow designed for “ badass women who lead active lifestyles, ” according to a press release. And others have slowly but surely begun popping up, too. The truth is companies call us “badass” and “strong” to grab our attention but, instead of actually trying to empower women, they ask us to spend our cash on even more beauty products. And that hypocrisy comes with a cost. \nResearch compiled by the New York City Girls Project shows that 40% to 70% of girls are dissatisfied with two or more parts of their body by middle school, in large part due to the images they see on magazines and on TV. According to a 2010 study conducted by the Girl Scout Research Institute, although most young girls (63%) think images represented by fashion models are unrealistic, 60% still say they compare their own bodies to those models. The point is that what we say and represent in advertising and marketing seeps into girls’ minds at an early age. If we start sending the message that women need to be pretty while playing sports, we’re doing something wrong. So instead of telling girls they can be strong and beautiful—you know with some magical sweat-proof makeup—we should be saying that strong is beautiful. And that should be enough. Story Tags",

      "text": "Facebook twitter Google November 14, 2016 Sampling the Atmosphere of Europa can provide insight into the composition of ocean beneath the miles of ice and signs of potential life if it exists Twitter A spacecraft flying past Europa may be able to sample its colossal watery plumes – even if they stopped erupting weeks earlier. A new analysis suggests that jets spewing from Jupiter’s icy moon could produce complex, constantly shifting chemical patterns in its atmosphere, which we could use to figure out what is on, and even below, the surface. Europa has an ocean underneath miles of ice. This ocean could be one of the best place to look for life in the solar system. Both NASA and the European Space Agency have missions in the works, targeted for launch in the early 2020s, that will fly past Europa. Europa’s gravity may pull material from the plumes back to the surface, creating a layer of frost. Later, some of those particles would be propelled back off the surface, either by evaporating or by being thrown upwards when charged particles from Jupiter’s magnetosphere hit the surface, much like the splash when a pebble drops into a pond. These particles feed Europa’s atmosphere, and could provide clues about the composition of the surface and the plumes – even if the plumes have already stopped. We could reconstruct a timeline of days or even weeks of previous activity, Teolis says. By calculating where the particles came from, we could begin to draw a map of fresh features on the moon’s surface.• Europa plumes may feed a global exosphere with complex structure and dynamics• Water and organics may be enhanced on the dayside during polar plume activity• Prior plumes or chemically enriched terrain may yield detectable exospheric signs• Model gives species density criteria for plume or enriched terrain detection Abstract A Europa plume source, if present, may produce a global exosphere with complex spatial structure and temporal variability in its density and composition. To investigate this interaction we have integrated a water plume source containing multiple organic and nitrile species into a Europan Monte Carlo exosphere model, considering the effect of Europa's gravity in returning plume ejecta to the surface, and the subsequent spreading of adsorbed and exospheric material by thermal desorption and re-sputtering across the entire body. We consider sputtered, radiolytic and potential plume sources, together with surface adsorption, regolith diffusion, polar cold trapping, and re-sputtering of adsorbed materials, and examine the spatial distribution and temporal evolution of the exospheric density and composition. These models provide a predictive basis for telescopic observations (e.g. HST, JWST) and planned missions to the Jovian system by NASA and ESA. We apply spacecraft trajectories to our model to explore possible exospheric compositions which may be encountered along proposed flybys of Europa to inform the spatial and temporal relationship of spacecraft measurements to surface and plume source compositions. For the present preliminary study, we have considered four cases: Case A: an equatorial flyby through a sputtered only exosphere (no plumes), Case B: a flyby over a localized sputtered ‘macula’ terrain enriched in non-ice species, Case C: a south polar plume with an Enceladus-like composition, equatorial flyby, and Case D: a south polar plume, flyby directly through the plume.

      "text": "Video Transcript Transcript for Facebook Under Fire for Fake News Stories thank you. Now to Facebook boss mark Zuckerberg. He's firing back against accusations that fake stories on the site influenced the election. He insists they did not. Is but is vowing to take action against them. Becky Worley joins us. What types of story are we talking about? Really inflammatory stories. Ones that are outright lies or supermisleading. Headlines. Take this one that said FBI agent suspected in Hillary e-mail leaks found dead. Gnat's fake store pip this one said Donald Trump had lost the support of the police unions when he had merely been chided by a union executive. A study by buzz feed showed top left wing sites published stories about 19% of the time. But right-wing sites published 38%. It's all about social feeds. Critics saying those viral hoaxes could have influenced the election. It has created real soul-searching at Facebook. Mark Zuckerberg is taking it seriously saying Facebook doesn't want hoaxes. They want meaningful info. He claimed 99% of what people see is authentic. He wants more ability to push accurate information to the tops of our feeds. But then, there's a big concern about those judgment calls. In his words, should Facebook itself become the arbiters of truth? Do they want to be fact-checkers? Isbook just a digital platform? Or are they bound by the rules of journalism and editorial responsibility? That's a big issue. And they haven't settled it yet, have they? No, this is an ongoing issue that they say they're going to research, George. Okay, Becky, thank you very much. This transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.

      "text": "Share on Facebook Danny Michel has a history of approaching music with a sense of exploration — his 2012 album Black Birds Are Dancing Over Me was recorded in Belize — and wacky adventure (check out his web video series \"Dan's Space Van\"). But the St. Jacobs, ON-based songwriter has outdone himself by writing and recording his upcoming album in the Canadian Arctic aboard a Russian icebreaker. \"It's kind of the closest thing you can get to leaving the planet, without leaving the planet,\" Michel says. \"We might make the Guinness Book of World Records for most northern record — north of the 80th parallel.\" Earlier this year, Michel's friend, astronaut Chris Hadfield, invited him, along with nine other writers, photographers, bloggers and filmmakers, to participate in Generator Arctic, an 18-day expedition from Greenland to Nunavut aboard the Kapitan Khlebnikov, a massive Russian icebreaker. Their mission was to capture what they experienced and share it with the world, and Michel, the only musician of the group, embraced that idea wholeheartedly. \"I didn't want to just write a song and put it on my next record,\" he says. \"I wanted to write a project all around this — and I was obsessed with the boat. It's like a giant, floating Grand Budapest Hotel. I got on it and was laughing so hard. Every hallway, every room, everything looks exactly like a Wes Anderson film.\" But it wasn't just the ship that was inspiring. The journey took the passengers to remote towns where sled dogs outnumber people, where their arrival doubled the local population; on hair-raising helicopter rides over glaciers; past humpback whales; and to Qilakitsoq, an abandoned Inuit settlement where they witnessed perfectly preserved ice mummies of women and children who died hundreds of years ago. At one point the ship came to a silent standstill — briefly breaking from its constant smashing and crunching noises — to let a polar bear pass. \"We were the first human beings he'd ever seen,\" Michel says. \"He's looking at us confused about what we are, smelling us. It was an amazing moment. I had tears in my eyes when he came up.\" Michel wrote about the mood of the ship, the communities that they visited and the rim of the boat. But when it came time to record, he faced some unique challenges. First of all, there was nowhere to record except for his tiny cabin, #712, which he shared with a roommate. \"Every time I came to do a recording, I'd have to turn the fan off and close the bathroom door — there was a fan you couldn't turn off in there — and close the port hole. It would get so hot that my roommate would come back and go 'it's so hot in here what are you doing!,'\" Michel says. His setup was simple and improvised: just a parlour sized Chris Hadfield model Larivee (the same kind that Hadfield took to the Space Station), two Neumann TLM 102s, a laptop, and, because they had to weigh everything they were bringing with them to meet strict weight and space restrictions, a borrowed camera tripod to use as a mic stand, gaffer tape, and a bunch of hair ties. \"I totally MacGyvered it,\" Michel says. \"I used my bathrobe as a little tent [for soundproofing].\" Michel says that lack of privacy resulted in Khlebnikov being a more intimate-sounding recording. \"I had to sing a little quieter, because there were people all around and I didn't want to be in there screaming,\" says Michel. \"That kind of forced it to be mellow in a neat way. We were right across the hall from a guy who had an office and his door was open all the time, our doors would open to each other.\" Since coming back, Michel has been working with his old friend and bandmate Rob Carli (an award-winning film and TV composer) on string and brass arrangements, to give the songs a symphonic \"Tom Waits meets Tim Burton\" feel; you will also be able to hear sounds from the Khlebnikov's engine room on it. He's also been processing what he refers to as a life-changing experience. \"It's been hard for us,\" he says. \"It took a while to process what we had seen — even Hadfield said that, and he's been to space. \"I was completely unprepared for the size of stuff; how [the ice] made the Grand Canyon look like Cambridge, ON; [we saw] pieces of ice that would go from Toronto to Kingston. These glaciers. And seeing how much they've receded. I'd love to take all the people in the world who don't believe in climate change up there. \"The world I came back to seems so crazy. All I can think about is those little mummies and those men that were harpooning the narwhals from their kayak in the freezing cold water to feed their families in the middle of nowhere, and they're living exactly the same way humans did a hundred years ago. \"It's just making me appreciate life a little more, go a little slower, be constantly amazed and respectful of how beautiful and immense this world is and how much we just kind of wreck stuff.\" Get It",

      "text": "Share on Facebook \nA powerful brand not only has to be extremely relevant to prospects, it has to make itself an invaluable and inextricable part of customers' lives as well. In the recent Forrester report called Navigate Your Brand To Resonance: Four Milestones To Brand Building , I outline a road map for CMOs with four clear stops, from salience to resonance, on the road to building a powerful brand. This journey is a must-take road trip for CMOs looking to assess the state of their brand and craft a strategy for taking it to the next step. The milestones are shown in the figure below: \nThe roadmap traces a deepening connection between brand and consumer built on a foundation of customer-obsessed experience delivery and powerful emotional connections. Good brands succeed in being salient, inducing trial, creating memorable experiences, and forming emotional bonds. Amazing brands do more – they energize the entire brand-consumer relationship in a way that creates a resonant and enduring bond. Brands that achieve this resonance are twice blessed - they reap the rewards of loyalty with existing customers and also set in motion a powerful recommendation engine which feeds the awareness and salience funnel. As Forrester research has consistently shown, word of mouth and recommendations are far more credible than brand-generated paid and earned media. \nIn the report, I provide several best practices of brands on this journey from salience to resonance; here are a few: Kale Is Good For You : JetBlue operates a 24,00 square feet vegetable garden outside Terminal 5 at JFK where they grow potatoes and kale. This commitment to urban green space where school kids will learn about plant life is emblematic of the brand's desire to stand for something bigger than transportation from Point A to B. Child's Play . American Girl crafts richly contextualized multi-dimensional experiences between girl, doll, and parent that create memories lasting a life time. American Girl is part of the American family. Not Just Another Brick In The Wall. The Lego set on the store shelf could be yours – not as in something you could buy, but as in something you've designed . Lego Ideas is empowerment and engagement at its best, allowing its fans to co-create and be vested in the brand. \nStay tuned for my next report that delves into Brand Resonance and explores three themes about community and engagement that define brand vanguards. \nRelevant Research:",

      "text": "Print Tyler Despres of Denver’s Gin Doctors has passed away at age 34. (Facebook) \nOn Saturday, November 12, 2016, the Larimer Lounge hosted a celebration of the life, love and music of Tyler Marchant Despres, who passed away unexpectedly on November 1 . The celebration filled the venerable RiNo venue with a diverse community of musicians, family and friends — a community that Tyler had no small hand in building. \nThe clear message of the event — which included food, photos, speeches from people closest to Tyler and lots of music — was that Tyler Despres was loved. He was loved for his humor, for his warmth, for his compassion, and of course, for his music. He was loved by friends, family, dogs, children, his students, fans — and by me. \nMy friendship with Tyler Despres began when I insulted a band he was in. In 2007, while writing for another Denver publication, I wrote a scathing live review of a Dualistics show. I wasn’t just critical; I was downright unkind . If Tyler held a grudge about it, it never showed. He always seemed happy to see me and was quick with a hug and one of his infamous jokes. \nThough newcomers to Denver music mostly know Tyler as that goofy guy — half mind-blowing musician, half standup comic — who wore costumes and played ’90s cover songs in the Gin Doctors, his contributions run much deeper. While he was, in fact, a very funny guy who fervently and unabashedly loved the music of the ’90s, he also crafted increasingly sophisticated and earnest songs with Dualistics, Science Partner and VWLS. The lushly produced, complexly composed Science Partner album “ Rocky Mountain News ” is easily one of the best Denver albums of the past five years. \nBut as great as it is, his music wasn’t even Tyler’s most important contribution to the world. Since the mid-2000s, Tyler has been one of the hubs of Denver’s fertile, vibrant, interconnected, and interdependent music community. I remember sitting in the dark (and, at that time, often deserted) Meadowlark Bar at 27th and Larimer on many nights in 2009 as Tyler created a welcoming and safe space for artists to gather, create and commune. Sure, I saw some remarkable talents in that intimate setting — I could drop all manner of famous and shoulda-been-famous names here — but I also saw friendships, new bands, and a strong community form, largely thanks to the kind and generous way that Tyler warmed the room. \nTyler brought all those people together once again on Saturday to say farewell to a friend in a manner befitting not only the man, but the community that, in many ways, revolved around him. As their tears hit the already-sticky floors, old friends hugged, laughed at Tyler’s jokes and swapped stories. \n\nJamie Laurie, a.k.a. Johnny 5 of Flobots, got to know Tyler when he joined the Flobots as their touring guitarist. “What I’ll remember about Tyler is his relentless humor,” he said as we stood outside the venue. “I have 11 minutes of recordings of me trying to keep up with his jokes. I was just trying to be like him. But he wasn’t just funny — he also had soul.” \nCharley Hine, Tyler’s longtime friend, roommate, and collaborator, gave a particularly poignant eulogy. “He was my musical soulmate,” Hine said. “He was a lot of people’s musical soulmate.” Reflecting on Tyler’s impact on the community, Hine continued, “If everyone — especially at times like this — was a little more like Tyler, I think the world would be a lot kinder — and we’d be doing a lot of kickflips and wearing dresses sometimes too.” \nIn his tribute, Jonathan Bitz, former talent buyer at the Meadowlark Bar and current proprietor of Syntax Physic Opera, highlighted Tyler’s immense and varied talents, saying, “The gambles he took comedically and musically are not to be underestimated.” \nLuke Mossman, formerly of Science Partner and Achille Lauro, is currently on tour with Nathaniel Rateliff and the Night Sweats, but recorded a message for the community gathering, in which he called Tyler a “beacon of light” and noted the positive impact he had on everyone. “As any great musician would say, you have to leave them wanting more,” said Mossman, “and that’s exactly where we find ourselves.” \nLeigh Ann Marchant, Tyler’s mom, gave a speech that was, like her son, both heartfelt and humorous. She shared a story of an eight-year-old Tyler requesting the Notre Dame fight song as a lullaby and a 21-year-old Tyler working a crowd to win a dance contest in Mexico. “Tyler was taken from us in the prime of his life,” Marchant said. “He was on a trajectory, just going up, up. … I want to thank all of you for helping Tyler become the man that he became.” \nJuliet Lewis, Tyler’s girlfriend, spoke of her beloved’s integrity: “Even when he struggled, he handled himself with grace and strength. He was very honest and authentic to himself. His confidence was magnetic, yet unassuming.” \n<a href=&#8221;http://sciencepartner.bandcamp.com/album/rocky-mountain-news&#8221;>Rocky Mountain News by Science Partner</a> \nLewis also shared with the gathering one of Tyler’s favorite forms of humor: the spoonerism. This is a bit of wordplay in which consonants, vowels, or sounds are swapped between two words for comic effect. For example, “lighting a fire” might become “fighting a liar.” Lewis shared one that will stick with me for a long time: \nWhat’s the difference between a Scandinavian jam band and throwing a baby through a basketball hoop? One’s a Swedish Phish, and the other’s a fetus swish. \nAfter the speeches, there were performances by several of Tyler’s collaborators and friends, including Hine, Carl Sorensen, Seth Evans, Jessica Denicola, Maria Kohler, Jen Korte, Ashley Adams, Tyler Briskie and Kelsey Bowe. \nThe group even debuted two songs from the album Tyler and Science Partner were working on when he passed. Sorensen, Kohler, and Evans are still determining the future of the album. Kohler, also known for her work in Kitty Crimes, calls the album’s songs “f***ing brilliant.” Sorensen, who also currently plays with Dragondeer and Chimney Choir, feels that Tyler would want these songs to be released. \n“On Rocky Mountain News , we had a song called, ‘Finish Where We Started,’ but I always heard it as ‘Finish What We Started,'” he told me. “That’s what I think we should do.” \n“Animal,” the first track on Rocky Mountain News , begins with the following line: “You are alive, thanks to all these different people. You are alive and laughing.” Saturday’s event turned Tyler’s own words around on him. \nHe is alive, thanks to all the different people he touched in the Denver music community and beyond. He is alive and laughing. \nTyler’s family has started a scholarship fund at Metropolitan State University of Denver for students pursuing degrees in education, as Tyler was. You can contribute to the fund here . \nEryc Eyl is a veteran music journalist, critic, former Denver Post columnist, and Colorado native who has been neck-deep in local music for many years. He is also a recognized expert on work-life balance. You can read more of his writings on his website at www.eryceyl.com . 16",

      "text": "Share on Facebook I'm in the bat cave. Like really in the bat cave. It's wetter than I imagined down here below Wayne Manor, with a pair of waterfalls tumbling into an underground river. Bigger, too, I notice as a spiral of flying rodents rises up toward a ground level exit. But the T-Rex is there, behind me over to the left. The giant penny, too. And the bat-computer is there waiting to help me crack some cases. It's hard to stop gaping as my brain tries to compute what my eyes think they are seeing. But the dark, neon-soaked and skyscraper-riddled streets of Gotham await, and Nightwing is in trouble. Rocksteady's one-hour experiential postscript to their iconic Arkham trilogy is a virtually realized dream. It's the most realistic and mind-trickiest world developed for Sony's new PlayStation VR, but the tech is the real superhero here. The term was coined back in 1987 by dreadlocked futurist Jaron Lanier a few years after William Gibson's novel Neuromancer and the Disney film Tron popularized the basic concept of climbing into cyberspace. The technology's possibilities captured filmmaker imaginations in movies ranging from the terrible Lawnmower Man and not-terrible Matrix to the comparatively accurate fin-de-millennium flick Strange Days . Now, after decades of pop culture promises, virtual reality has finally arrived — and it is hard to overstate how impressive the tech is. This is not movie theatre 3D, which is fine enough but really not that different from the red and blue cardboard glasses from the 1950s. With VR, your brain doesn't think a shark is coming out of the screen; it thinks you are inside the screen confronting the shark. In the Ocean Descent level of Sony's VR Worlds — a fantastic tech demo game akin to Wii Sports — you scuba dive down to a shipwreck, past stingrays and jellyfish, through a coral tube and eventually get attacked by a great white. Even though some of the animation comes off cartoonish, it still feels like you are actually underwater. There is definitely the same novelty factor at play as when the Wii got everyone virtual bowling with buddies. The infatuation with the Nintendo console's then-impressive motion-sensing tech eventually wore off, albeit after making the Wii a runaway sales success, but PSVR feels less like a neat toy than the future of entertainment. While it lacks the Wii's party aspect, the PSVR's immersive solo experience is so much fucking cooler — and this is just the technology's tutorial level. Still, the tech has a very large challenge to meet. It's a sleek, futuristic looking helmet that works with the PS4's pre-existing camera, DualShock controller and the Wiimote-inspired, motion-sensing Move controllers. But you can't really move. You're attached via cables and it's easy to go out of the camera view-restricted play area and/or bump into things. Arkham VR , for instance, let's you look down at your utility belt, grab and throw a batarang, scan a dead body for clues or retrieve gear with your trusty grapnel gun. But you can't walk or fight. Part of that is because VR can induce nausea during movement, and part is because the tech just can't handle the character's trademark hand-to-hand combat. So you port around with a button push, which is functional and eliminates potential motion sickness, but takes you out of the moment. Other games take other approaches to addressing this problem. Rez Infinite , an update of the rave-era music shooter, handles your movement on rails as if you were on an amusement park ride where all you do is aim. So does trippy, Tetris -inspired puzzler Super Hypercube and fantastic inside-a-screensaver rhythm game Thumper , while Until Dawn: Rush of Blood seats you in an actual roller coaster. Meanwhile, VR World puts you inside a mech suit while you leap around asteroids, on a luge whooshing down city slopes, or in a post-heist car chase across London where your partner drives while you shoot rivals (and change the music on the car radio) with the Move controller triggers. Now PSVR is not the first VR tech out this year. It was beaten to market by the Facebook-owned Oculus Rift and the Steam-driven HTC Vive, both of which require high-end computer hardware. There's also the entry-level Samsung Gear, a cordless, smartphone-based headset that's cheap and powered by Rift software, but lacks the Oculus's oomph and can't track your body. By owning the space between those options with its relative affordability and processing power, the PSVR is the most commercially viable of the bunch. If VR is to go mainstream, this is ground zero. There are no specs to assess or GPU card to buy, the kit is significantly cheaper than its premium rivals at $550, and the PS4 not only costs way less than a dedicated PC, it's also already owned by 40 million people. The souped-up PS4 Pro is said to offer an even better visual experience thanks to higher frame rates. Plus, it's built for the living room, targets early-adopting gamers and already has motion controls. You just plug in the previously gratuitous PS camera, connect the small PSVR processor unit to your PS4 and the helmet, put it on and you're inside the game. These are early days yet, and the technology is spectacular enough to get by largely on wow factor for some time. But Sony is not taking chances and is offering 30 launch games, ranging from the sci-fi snark of Job Simulator and whimsical adventure-puzzler Wayward Sky to the reimagined racer Driveclub VR and Atari reboot Battlezone to the space combat spectacle of EVE Valkyrie and Sony's sweet-natured minigame collection VR Playroom . Another 20 are due before year's end. These games, to varying degrees of success, show off different aspects of the technology but they are not really games as we currently conceive them. They're predominantly short-form — which is fine because you really can't play VR for hours like you would a normal game due to eye strain — and developers are still trying to figure what works and what the audience wants. Metaphorically, we're still at the Atari stage of this technology, so it's only a matter of time before these problems are solved. This won't displace traditional gaming but it is the logical evolution of the first-person and 3D game design advancements that transformed the medium in the '90s. And after years of incremental improvements, VR finally gives gaming a much-needed technological revolution. Get It",

      "text": "0 November 14, 2016 Facebook’s Conservative Media Outlets Need To ‘Drain The Swamp’: News Bias, Lies, Clickbait, And Yellow Journalism Assassinate Hillary Clinton’s Character For A Fake Trump Crusade Patrick Frye \nThe following article is entirely the opinion of Patrick Frye and does not reflect the views of the Inquisitr. \nDo these crazy headlines by Facebook’s conservative media outlets sound familiar? Hillary Clinton’s indictment just happened! Oh, no, actually… Hillary has been arrested by the FBI! Hillary endorsed Trump as “honest” while Pope Francis forbids Catholics from voting Democrat! A video of Bill Clinton’s sex tape with a 13-year-old girl on Jeffrey Epstein’s “orgy island” was leaked by Anonymous hackers! Even Oprah is getting in on the action, saying, “some white people have to die”! \nDay by day, there have been fake news stories being promoted on Facebook by so-called conservative media outlets which attempt to spin a piece of data in favor of Donald Trump for the sake of clicks. Before the election, there was plenty of false stories being promoted by conservative media and it was difficult to tell fact from fiction. The worst part was that the real information from Wikileaks about Hillary Clinton, the DNC, and the Clinton Foundation about was damning enough that they didn’t need to rely on yellow journalism. Yet, they lied anyway… why? Fake Conservative Media Create Pro-Trump News For Cash \nIt turns out the reason we had so many “conservative” websites lying about the 2016 election is because they are being run by non-Americans who are not actually pro-Trump or pro-Republican. If anything, they’re pro-money and politically they’re probably not conservative in the first place. They’re only writing outrageous headlines simply because they can make money by misleading conservative Americans. \nThis is not a conspiracy theory since the owners of such sites have admitted what they are doing. BuzzFeed News recently reported that Macedonian teenagers have created hundreds of websites designed to “publish aggressively pro-Trump content aimed at conservatives and Trump supporters in the US.” These people “don’t care about Donald Trump” but instead they realized the “best way to generate shares on Facebook is to publish sensationalist and often false content that caters to Trump supporters .” \nWith this strategy, some of these fake news websites have made thousands of dollars a month, with some viral hits generating “$3,000 per day”. \n“Yes, the info in the blogs is bad, false, and misleading but the rationale is that ‘if it gets the people to click on it and engage, then use it,'” admitted an unnamed university student who runs one of these fake conservative media websites. \nTruth matters. I may be a conservative-leaning Libertarian myself, but the conservative media bias has reached the point that they are in desperate need of cleaning house. Trump spoke of “draining the swamp” in Washington D.C., but we also need to drain the swamp among Facebook’s conservative media outlets. Stephen Bannon makes no secret of his anger towards the left and the establishment. His entire Breibart News service is controversial and growing. He’s now part of the last remaining few months of Donald Trump’s campaign. [Image by Danny Moloshok/Invision/AP, File] Real Conservative Media Needs To Be Based Upon Credible Facts, Not Open Bias \nThe hard part with draining the swamp is that the line between fake pro-Trump news and real conservative media websites has blurred. On one hand, some of the major news media corporations have torched their credibility by being so openly biased toward Hillary Clinton. On the other hand, Ben Shapiro is claiming that Steve Brannon, Trump’s future White House Chief Strategist, turned Breitbart .com into a Trump loudspeaker and the “alt-right go-to website”. (To be fair, when Allum Bokhari and Milo Yiannopoulos wrote about the alternative right , they claimed they “do not identify with the alt-right” although Bannon admitted during the summer of 2016 that Breitbart has become “the platform for the alt-right”. According to CNN , Matt Parrott, a spokesman for the openly white nationalist Traditionalist Worker Party, “ Steve Bannon has never been a white nationalist .”) \nIt’s also become extremely difficult to tell whether a conservative media outlet is credible. The fake news stories are one thing, but then you have examples like True Pundit, which broke the story about Hillary allegedly targeting Wikileaks founder Julian Assange with a drone strike. The claim remains unproven to this day but RT and Fox News ‘ Megyn Kelly picked up the story. \nNow, it’s important that conservative media be willing to pick up stories that may otherwise be ignored, but the truth cannot be sacrificed in the process. It’s hard to know where True Pundit stands since even Paul Joseph Watson of InfoWars “ thought this [drone story] was fake story , until Wikileaks tweeted it out.” As another example, before election day True Pundit had an exclusive where they claimed FBI Director James Comey was “preparing to conduct sweeping search warrants in the Clinton Foundation investigation or ready to start arresting suspects. Or both.” \nWe all know how that turned out and the situation after the 2016 election has not improved. Snopes has been having a field day, with some conservative media outlets promoting outright lies like the Donald Trump popular vote conspiracy theory. (In short, a Twitter user generated the numbers out of thin air and the final vote count, although not completed, currently has Hillary winning the popular vote.) [Image by Smash.com ] Clickbait Versus Yellow Journalism \nDraining the conservative media swamp is also difficult because of clickbait headlines. Nowadays, practically every news media outlet uses clickbait on social media since they know it’s necessary to tease the readers in order to generate traffic and thus advertising revenue. If the headline and Facebook post gives away the meat of the story, then why would readers click the link? \nThe problem is that clickbait has become indistinguishable from yellow journalism of old. During the Spanish-American War of 1898, newspapers would create sensationalist headlines in order to generate paper sales. This became known as yellow journalism. Similarly, clickbait headlines on social media can mislead or lie to the reader in order to generate a click. A Facebook headline may claim that Obama is ready to pardon Hillary from the email server scandal but in fact the story is only about how White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest responded to a question on the topic. \nLegitimate clickbait could say something like, “Donald Trump’s Cabinet Choices Announced: Liberals Shocked At Who Trump Picked”. That’s a sensationalist headline that’s also true. Clickbait that strays into the realm of yellow journalism would proclaim, “Donald Trump’s Cabinet Choice Is A White Supremacist!” Yes, it’s true that openly liberal news sites are making this allegation, but it’s also questionable whether it’s true or a lie since Bannon has never self-identified as a white supremacist. Instead, it would it would be true, and almost as equally sensational, to publish a headline that says, “Donald Trump’s Cabinet Choice Alleged To Be A White Supremacist!” \nSuch distinctions matter since many Facebook readers never click the link to the news site. If readers’ views are informed by clickbait lies, how can one ever hope to know what’s real news and what’s fake conservative media? As such, real conservative media should strive to be more careful in how they write their headlines. Facts don't care about your feelings. \n— Ben Shapiro (@benshapiro) February 5, 2016 Can Facebook Drain The Swamp? It’s Up To Conservative Readers \nPast studies have concluded that 44 of Americans rely upon Facebook first for informing them. The owners of the fake conservative media websites openly acknowledge they thrive only because of Facebook’s open policies in regards to news. Thus, it logically follows that Facebook’s management is the gatekeeper for cutting off their money stream. \nThe problem is that Facebook may have already considered this issue and done nothing. According to a report by Gizmodo, the solution is ready but they decided to not pull the drain plug on the swamp due to fear of backlash from conservatives . \n“According to two sources with direct knowledge of the company’s decision-making, Facebook executives conducted a wide-ranging review of products and policies earlier this year, with the goal of eliminating any appearance of political bias. One source said high-ranking officials were briefed on a planned News Feed update that would have identified fake or hoax news stories, but disproportionately impacted right-wing news sites by downgrading or removing that content from people’s feeds. According to the source, the update was shelved and never released to the public. It’s unclear if the update had other deficiencies that caused it to be scrubbed.” \nDo not judge Facebook too harshly since any algorithm-based filter does have the potential for harming legitimate news media, whether conservative or progressive. Facebook users already have the ability to self-report fake news stories on their news feed. In the end, it’s really up to conservative news readers to recognize that there is a problem. The solution is ready, but conservatives simply need to use it. \n[Image by Dan Kitwood/Getty Images]",

Post to Facebook A teen’s guide to becoming president: Your Say Political correctness is so 2012.  //usat.ly/2fs877S   A teen’s guide to becoming president: Your Say   Political correctness is so 2012.     \nLetter to the editor: \nWith the shocking victory of Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton, I thought it would be appropriate to discuss how the political outsider won the votes of the American people. \nIf you happen to be an impressionable teenager like myself, with the lofty goal of someday becoming president of this great nation, follow these guidelines: Be a bigot and a racist. You must have a blatant disregard for racial minorities, sexual orientations, disabilities, genders, ethnic backgrounds and religious faiths. Get those endorsements! The Ku Klux Klan and Sarah Palin are great places to start. Not only must you offend and disrespect everyone who is not a straight, white, uneducated male, you must also advocate an agenda based on xenophobia and anger. It is imperative that you have absolutely no idea what you are doing. It will also be especially beneficial to your campaign if you frequently remind your voters that you are not a politician. Be incredibly wealthy. White America will admire your entrepreneurial triumph over the working class. If people aren’t suing you, are you really winning? \nImportant side note: Political correctness is so 2012. If you really want to win, you’ll understand that American people are sick and tired of respecting each other. It’s simply too much work to use proper pronouns and demonstrate common courtesy. \nAbove all, you must not waste your time on winning the educated vote because they will always be the minority. Appeals to reason do not matter. \nIf you follow these guidelines you will certainly become the leader of the free world. You can sleep well at night knowing you slew that pesky beast of equality, and that the real Americans are now in charge. \nNoah Crabtree; Templeton, Calif.",

      "text": "Mark Zuckerberg: Identifying The \"Truth\" Is Complicated \nMark Zuckerberg took to Facebook this weekend to say that the social network will do its best to get rid of fake news but, at the same time, he also said that identifying the truth is \"complicated.\" \nOur goal is to show people the content they will find most meaningful, and people want accurate news. We have already launched work enabling our community to flag hoaxes and fake news, and there is more we can do here. We have made progress, and we will continue to work on this to improve further. This is an area where I believe we must proceed very carefully though. Identifying the \"truth\" is complicated.",

In the wake of a close contest, some have said Facebook’s lax attitude toward hoaxes swung the election to Donald Trump . The controversy has renewed calls for the company to take its fake news problem more seriously.\n\nToday Gizmodo published a much-discussed story reporting that Facebook had built and abandoned a tool to reduce the spread of fake news stories over fears that the tool would disproportionately affect conservative news sites. Facebook acknowledged that the company has been reconsidering its approach to combating hoaxes, but says the story’s central allegation is false. So what’s really going...",

      "text": "Facebook twitter Google November 14, 2016 India's second domestic aircraft carrier will be nuclear powered and have electromagnetic launchers but will not arrive for about twenty years Twitter When INS Vishal, the Indian Navy’s second indigenous aircraft carrier enters service, it will be a technologically cutting edge warship, on par with the world’s most advanced carriers. The navy’s finalised specifications include nuclear propulsion, a catapult launch system based on the new US “electro-magnetic aircraft launch system” (EMALS) and the capacity to embark 55 combat aircraft. But advanced technologies also mean delay. India's nuclear aircraft carrier will not come into service until the 2030s. The Indian Navy’s latest aircraft carrier, the 65,000-ton supercarrier INS Vishal, the second ship of the Vikrant-class, will be powered by a nuclear reactor, according to anonymous Indian Navy sources. Furthermore, the INS Vishal will be able to accommodate up to 55 aircraft (35 fixed-wing combat aircraft and 20 rotary wing aircraft), launched using a catapult assisted take-off but arrested recovery (CATOBAR) aircraft launch system, incorporating U.S. defense contractor’s General Atomics’ new electromagnetic aircraft launch system (EMALS) technology. Originally, India planned to induct the carrier in the 2020s. There was no mention of delaying it to the 2040s to incorporate nuclear fusion, hypersonic fighter planes, molecular nanotechnology and post-singularity artificial intelligence.

      "text": "Fake content could pose a greater problem for Facebook ( FB ) than simply a public relations nightmare.\nThe Pew Research Center found recently that 44% of Americans get at least some of their news from Facebook. That's a lot of people turning toward the Menlo Park, CA-based social media giant to find out what's going on in the world.\nThe main issue, however, is the prevalence of inaccurate and false news that users spread on Facebook, especially as highlighted in this year's presidential election. A recent analysis by Buzzfeed of more than 1,000 posts shared on Facebook from several news sites showed that 38% of the posts on hyper-right wing sites were either partly or entirely false, as well as 19% of those on hyper-left wing pages. By contrast, 99.3% of the posts on mainstream sites that Buzzfeed analyzed were partly or entirely truthful.\nBut websites pumping out false content generate a higher number of Facebook shares, comments and reactions than traditional mainstream political sites. Buzzfeed found that Occupy Democrats, the hyperpartisan site with the greatest median shares per post, earned 10,931 shares per post while, CNN Politics only garnered a median of 50 shares per post.\nWith lots of inaccurate content swarming news feeds, the New York Times said recently that fake news has become \"media's next challenge.\"\nFacebook is a holding in Jim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS Charitable Trust Portfolio.

      "text": "Following Donald Trump’s appointment as President-elect, Facebook came under fire for its influence on the results. But just how involved was the social media giant?\nCriticism of the company has been growing over the past several days due to its lax efforts to control the fake news shared on its platform. Facebook, on the contrary, has stated that only 1 percent of news is fake on its site.\nNow, we are learning Facebook had a possible fix to correct the fake news problem earlier in the year, but opted not to implement it because it was primarily going to target conservative news.\n“They absolutely have the tools to shut down fakes news,” said a source to Gizmodo . The report also says Facebook had an internal debate about using the fix back as far back as May.\nHigh-ranking officials at Facebook met to discuss a way to even out the news content that was shared across the site with an intent of appearing neutral to both parties. Their search revealed the fix would greatly admonish news from conservative sites and declined to use it.\nWe don’t know to what degree the fix was going to work in filtering out fake news, or how effective it was going to be, but these allegations against Facebook are quite damning. Companies like Facebook and Google, which also got in hot water due to its own problems with fake news , have a responsibility to deliver accurate and trustworthy information.\nThe top news that spread on Facebook focused on the positive towards the Republican nominee, now President-elect, Donald Trump, such as “Pope Francis Shocks World, elects Donald Trump for President,” which he did not, and towards the negative when pertaining to the Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, like “FBI Agent Suspected in Hillary Email Leaks Found Dead in Apparent Murder-Suicide,” which is completely false. Both news stories were widely disseminated across Facebook.\nThe influence of social media has never been more important With over 1.79 billion active users, the power and influence of Facebook has never been stronger or more important. Each user may believe in differing opinions, whether it’d be political or any other factor, but Facebook still has a responsibility to eliminate falsehoods, and if for some reason the company purposefully did not, it is a dangerous precedent to set.\n\n\nSource : Gizmodo \nVia : Engadget ",

      "text": "Wasting Too Much Time on Facebook? How to Kick the Habit   1 Tweet In the years after its 2004 launch, Facebook experienced a massive growth in popularity. While new membership has slowed (after reaching a whopping 1 billion members), still every day hundreds of millions of users frequent the network. A 2014 study suggested 23 percent of Facebook users checked their account five or more times each day. While some users may spend too much time on the network, there is a percentage of people who may be addicted to Facebook . Generally, most people probably are not addicted, but do find they simply spend too much time on the network. This realization may come if they find they are neglecting other things and/or not getting other tasks or responsibilities done. Credit: Freeimages9  //pixabay.com/en/facebook-twitter-browser-wide-www-1555354/ Statistics suggest many people check their Facebook accounts numerous times per day. How many never log off? Facebook can be a huge time waster if a person lets time spent on the network get out of control and/or has difficulty keeping track of time spent while surfing or chatting on the site.   in this pickle, fortunately, there are some relatively easy approaches you can take to cut back on your Facebook habit. Make a Decision The first step is to decide it's time to scale back on Facebook use. Daily habits are often hard to break, and also getting lured into discussions (perhaps especially during an election season ) or activities (i.e. games) are hard to separate from at times . However, once the decision is made that too much time is spent on Facebook and it's time to cut back, it gets a lot easier from there. Keep a Diary Many people use diet diaries when trying to lose weight, identify allergies or simply want to keep track of what foods they eat daily. The same concept can be used for Facebook. Write down each time you log on and when you log off and take a look at the time you’ve spent using the network. This way you can realistically see how much time you are actually spending on the network and decide where and when you need to cut back. It’ll also give you an idea of how much time you actually want to spend on the network. Preset Lengths of Time Budgeting your time from day-to-day can help. Not unlike a financial budget , set up a \"budget\" for Facebook time. First, decide what must get done and then see how logging into the social network fits into the schedule. Pick a set period of time to spend on the network and then log off when time is up. Credit: epicioci  //pixabay.com/en/watch-clock-black-and-white-time-1329210/ Paying attention to the minutes and hours spent on Facebook is a good start to cutting back. You may want to pick either a set time of day to surf the site, or a specified period of time to end a Facebook session. If you find it's too hard to log off or keep track of time, you can set an alarm as a reminder that the budgeted time is up. Consider budgeting enough time in to give yourself one or two snoozes if you think it’ll be too hard to shut down when the alarm goes off or you want to allot yourself a few minutes to finish up your notifications or posts. Carefully Choose Activities Facebook has an incredible number of ways people can spend time on the network. In many ways, Facebook has structured its network where members do not even have to leave the site to engage with others. Instead of trying to do web surfing and information gathering and/or sharing through Facebook, make a commitment to yourself to only engage in certain activities; perhaps your most favorite features or pick one game. If your friend list is huge and you’ve found you’re not interacting with your best friend from the fifth grade or any other people you haven’t talked to in ages, consider unfollowing their posts so you have less streaming through your feed. Disable and/or Block Apps One of the biggest time wasters on Facebook are the games and/or other applications that are offered either by Facebook or a third-party app that runs on the platform. Chances are, if you are an avid Facebook user, you probably have given permission to many apps. If so, go back into your user preferences and uninstall any apps that are not \"necessary\" to what time limits you've set on your Facebook usage. Plus, it’s a good privacy checkup to periodically check what and who has access to your account. Credit: Thomas Breher  //pixabay.com/en/login-password-log-sign-on-turn-on-1203603/ Do you know how many third party apps you've allowed access to? It's a general good practice to give yourself a routine review and revoke privileges to any apps no longer used. Plus, for those drawn to apps, this will remove them out of the equation and give back more time to do other things. Scaling back excess time on Facebook might be difficult, but chances are once you set up a limited daily routine, you won't miss all those extra hours spent on the website at all. The key is to be aware of the minutes ticking away and continue being proactive in knowing when it's time to log off. Once you get going, you’ll probably find you’re much more productive in other areas of your life. Facebook has its value, however, it can cause a true disruption in a person's life if he or she is not careful. That being said, it is entirely possible to enjoy the network's benefits, while minimizing the time-wasting aspect of the site. These are some suggestions and this YouTube video offers some additional tips and approaches that might work for you if you're looking to scale back on your Facebook time: Advertisement",

      "title": "Secrets Of Online Shopping Discrimination",
      "text": "Follow CBSMIAMI.COM: Facebook | Twitter \nMIAMI (CBSMiami) – Most people think you can usually find a better deal when you shop online.\nBut the price you see can be different than what other people see. The type of computer you use, your online search history, even your zip code have all been used by online retailers to determine what price you pay.\nIn a study conducted by researchers at Northeastern University in Boston, nine out of 16 online retailers and travel websites tested showed different prices or difference results for the same searches.\n“I always assumed all the prices would always be the same,” said Liz Owens.\nOwens, a busy mother of two, does a lot of her shopping online and was initially skeptical when she was told the prices she sees are not always what everyone else sees until she participated in a test.\nOwens, along with six other people, were provided a list of items and had to look them up on the same websites and at the same time.\nFor most of the items, everyone’s search resulted in the same price. However, it didn’t happen every time.\nWhen Owens looked up a night’s stay at the Caribe Royale Hotel in Orlando on Travelocity on her laptop, she was shown a price of $132 per night. The same search on Travelocity at the same time on a mobile phone came up with a price of $119.\nA spokesperson for the travel website said it sometime does offer lower prices for people who use smartphones.\nA similar finding was discovered when participants searched Rosetta Stone’s online language software.\nThose in the group who searched on a desktop computer were shown a price of $249 for Levels 1-5 of Mandarin Chinese. Those who used a mobile device were offered the same products for $189 – a $60 difference.\n“I think that is shocking,” Owens said when seeing the price difference. “We did the search at the exact same time and I got a much higher price.”\nHowever, it wasn’t always a case of desktop versus mobile. Sometimes it was where a participant was logged on from that made a difference in price.\nWhen Owens priced a GE 7-foot Christmas tree on HomeDepot.com with free home delivery anywhere in the U.S., her price was $399. When the same item was priced on the site from Boston and Minneapolis the price shown was $438.\nHome Depot said sometimes it does offer different online customers different prices based on the region where they log-on from. The company said it can figure out one’s location from a computer’s IP address.\nResearchers found 9 of 16 online retailers use “price steering” or “price discrimination”\n“You as a consumer are just looking at a website and really have no idea why it’s showing you what it’s showing you,” said Christo Wilson, who along with his team of researchers at Northeastern University collected online shopping search results from more than 300 people.\nBased on their findings, Wilson said they found cases of “price discrimination” and “price steering”\nPrice steering is when two users receive different product results or the same products in different order for the same search.\nPrice discrimination occurs when two users receive different prices for the same search results.\nWilson tested 16 online retailers and travel sites and found on nine of those sites customers saw different results and or prices\nWhen you log onto a website, companies can see your search history, your clicks, the type of computer and browser you use, and even determine your location. All of this, according to Wilson, can be used to personalize prices online.\nWilson said price discrimination is becoming more prevalent and sophisticated, although; he added it can be very difficult for online shoppers to detect.\n“This is a real challenge for us and for consumers because companies are always experimenting with different strategies and algorithms,” he explained.\nWhat can you do to figure out if the price you see is the lowest price?\nThere’s no perfect solution, but here’s a start.\nWhen looking for the best deal look it up on your desktop and using your mobile phone. If you think shopping in “private” or “incognito” mode is going to hide your information from online retailers, it doesn’t.\nComputer security expert says to hide your identity when shopping online use a Virtual Private Network (VPN). You can download some VPN services for free. Better ones will cost around $20-30 a year.",

      "text": "Even Mark Zuckerberg's own employees think their CEO is wrong about News Feed.\nA group of Facebook employees are organizing a \"task force\" to question the social network's involvement with spreading fake news in the run-up to the election, according to BuzzFeed . The group reportedly disagrees with Zuckerberg's public statements on the issue and plans to suggest changes the company can make to improve News Feed.\nSEE ALSO: Zuckerberg claims Facebook hoaxes didn't influence the election. He's wrong.\nThe group is reportedly made up of several dozen employees who are apparently holding secret meetings to discuss their ideas.\nCiting five unnamed members of the group, described as \"an unofficial task force,\" BuzzFeed reports the employees were upset by Zuckerberg's characterization of the idea that fake news and hoaxes affected the election as \"crazy.\"\nMany more employees not directly involved in the task force are also unhappy with Facebook's stance on the issue. The social network has increasingly come under fire in the wake of the presidential election as critics argue that the proliferation of fake news and hoaxes influenced the election — a dynamic the company did little to prevent.\nMany more employees not directly involved in the task force are also unhappy with Facebook's stance\nSunday night Mark Zuckerberg posted a lengthy update on Facebook in which he again dismissed the claims, saying that it was \"extremely unlikely hoaxes changed the outcome of this election in one direction or the other.\"\nFacebook did not immediately respond to Mashable's request for comment.\nIt's unclear if Zuckerberg or other executives will change their position on the matter. Facebook executives also had an internal conversation about the role of News Feed in the election, according to an earlier report in the New York Times .\nNews that Facebook's own employees are actively resisting the company's official line on the matter would seem to make Zuckerberg's stance increasingly untenable. Now that large groups of Facebook employees, including engineers directly involved in its technology, are arguing that the company can and should do more to combat misinformation — and blasting Zuckerberg for repeatedly dismissing the same claims — he will be hard-pressed to make the case that even his own employees don't believe.",

      "text": "Updated 6 hrs ago \nEAST CHICAGO — A Michigan City man, who arranged on Facebook to sell a pair of gym shoes Sunday in East Chicago, arrived in the city and was robbed of the shoes and money, police said. \nThe man told police he arrived about 6:30 p.m. in the 4200 block of Ivy Street, and the person he planned to meet pointed a handgun at him and demanded the shoes, Lt. Marguerite Wilder said. \nThe man handed over the shoes, thinking it might be a joke, and a second person reached into the man's pants pocket and took an undisclosed amount of money, police said. \nIn a separate case, a truck driver was robbed about 11:30 p.m. Sunday after a man jumped on the hood of the driver's cab and demanded his wallet, police said. \nThe driver told police he was at the intersection of Dickey and Riley roads when the man jumped on the hood. He handed over the wallet, and the man took off with another man toward the Marktown area, police said. \nAnyone with information about either robbery is asked to call Detective Luis Semidei at (219) 391-8318. To remain anonymous, call (219) 391-8500. enterprise",

      "text": "Facebook helped Donald Trump win US elections? Mark Zuckerberg opens up November 12, 2016 \nFacebook founder, Mark Zuckerberg has addressed criticisms that fake news on Facebook aided the rise of the United States of America President-elect, Donald Trump. \nZuckerberg absolves Facebook of any blame as regars Trump victory \nZuckerberg who addressed the issue while speaking at a technology conference in California, said Facebook should not be held responsible. \nHis words: “The idea that fake news on Facebook influenced the election in any way is a pretty crazy idea. \n“If you believe that then I don’t think you have internalised the message Trump supporters are trying to send in this election.” \nHe continued: “My goal, and what I care about, is giving people the power to share so we can make the world more open and connected. That requires building a good version of News Feed. We still have work to do on that. We’re going to keep improving it. \n“On the community guidelines, I think as norms change and people want to see more news, I think we’ll have to continue to evolve the guidelines to reflect the value that the community holds.” \nAccording to the BBC, some data has shown that fake stories were being far more widely shared on the platform than follow up stories debunking the claims. \nFor an increasing number of people, particularly Americans, Facebook is becoming the primary source of news coverage. \nThe site’s News Feed is specifically designed to show users content it thinks will be of most interest, creating what some describe as a “filter bubble” that reinforces a person’s view without injecting differences in opinion. READ Davido Enrolls His Daughter, Imade, In A Foreign Creche In Lagos (Photos/Video) \nInterestingly, earlier this year, Facebook was accused of being anti-Trump after it was alleged its human moderators were favouring liberal stories appearing in people’s “trending stories” box. \nWhile denying that claim, the site did sack its human team, instead relying solely on an algorithm to determine which stories were shown to be most popular. \nAs a consequence, stories which were later proved entirely false appeared on the timelines of a large number of users. \nSix months ago, Zuckerberg attacked Trump’s stance on immigration in a speech about Facebook’s future. \nMeanwhile, an upstate New York woman, Margot Gerster bumped into Mrs Hillary Clinton while she was hiking through the woods in New York. \nThe incident happened just a day after Clinton lost to Trump and Gerster shared it on her Facebook page.

The South Side is evolving, changing and growing. Swing by and try some under-the-radar restaurants that hit it out of the park. These must-try spots are listed alphabetically. 1 Café on the Grove \nWhat better way to start your South Side adventure than with a delicious, hearty brunch in the historic Kenwood neighborhood? From standard breakfast fare such as bacon, eggs and pancakes, to some notable favorites like the Jamaican jerk salad and crab cakes.

      "text": "Perhaps one of catchiest memes that made the rounds of the Internet since President-elect Donald J. Trump decided to run was the one in which he’s quoted by People magazine back in 1998 as saying that if he ran for president he’d do it as a Republican. His purported reason: “They are the dumbest group of voters in the country. They believe anything on Fox. I could lie and they’d still eat it up. I bet my numbers would be terrific.”\nIt wasn’t true in the slightest . But the chances are you saw this meme, a number of times, over the last couple of years. Or maybe you heard the totally unfounded and pernicious claims that Hillary Clinton could be the leader of pedophile ring , or that the U.S. putting a man on the moon was a piece of fiction.\nThe information superhighway can be a kind of Wonderland, but one we must navigate carefully. While we wait for Facebook Inc., in the words of the tech media, to “ fix its fake news problem ,” to create algorithms that can determine the difference between truth and fantasy, we might be better served by relying on that old and trusted capacity called “skepticism.”\nGoogle Inc. has just said that it plans to curtail the proliferation of fake news. This announcement came shortly after it was reported that the site that appeared top of Google’s rankings for the search request, “Who won the popular vote?” was a conspiracy site with incorrect information.\nTo make matters worse, it now appears that Facebook was well aware of the problem of fake news but execs in its highest ranks had forestalled doing anything about it, according to a Gizmodo report. “High-ranking officials were briefed on a planned news feed update that would have identified fake or hoax news stories, but disproportionately impacted right-wing news sites by downgrading or removing that content from people’s feeds,” the report said.\nGizmodo’s source said that Facebook could easily shut down fake news. The New York Times also said it had sources inside Facebook and also said that the matter of news fakery was indeed a matter of concern, creating a “ internal culture of fear ” after employees who had been fired from Facebook in May over Trending News issues.\nThe Difficult Truth Yet the truth is not always so black and white. Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, activist and author Chris Hedges , formerly a New York Times correspondent for the Middle East, left the newspaper mostly because of his anti-Iraq war stance, something that wasn’t popular in the public and media sphere back in the day. If you have ever read Hedges’ grim tales of warfare, upcoming environmental catastrophe, inveterate government corruption and the manufacturing of consent of the public partly via the internet, you might only hope he is making some of it up. Echoing Hedge’s worldwide woe is the prolific Noam Chomsky, at once called “America’s greatest intellectual” but also harangued by online detratctors as a fraud out to destroy America.\nContempt and admiration toward both writers can be found all over the Net, on blogs, Facebook posts, and in mainstream media. Their interpretation of war and the environment is often very different from mainstream media, so we might ask which interpretation is true.\nCan we expect Facebook and Google to do that job for us? Some observers believe they cannot, and they shouldn’t be expected to do so. By expecting them to find the truth for us, we may set them up as powerful arbiters of truth, a decision we could come to regret.\nPhoto credit: gfpeck via Flickr ",

      "title": "CEOs look to bring together their divided customers, workers - StarTribune.com",
      "text": "NEW YORK — Apple CEO Tim Cook is telling his employees to \"keep moving forward.\" Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is saying \"progress does not move in a straight line.\" T-Mobile's CEO John Legere tweeted \"let's see what an out of the box, non-typical, non-politician can do for America!\"\nCEOs of major companies are taking stands about the results of the election — a departure from the traditional model of not mixing politics with business that major brands have long espoused.\nSome are using it as an opportunity to bring their employees together following a divisive election campaign. Others are using it as an opportunity to stress their companies' values and mission, or an opportunity to make nice with Trump, who many CEOs were publicly against during the campaign.\nThe men and woman who head the nation's biggest companies know that having a hostile relationship with the Trump administration could make doing business difficult. They also know that they operate in liberal bastions like New York and San Francisco just as much as in Trump-leaning places like Fort Wayne, Indiana, or Charleston, West Virginia.\n\"Neutral is the best policy,\" says John Challenger, CEO of workplace consultant Challenger, Gray & Christmas.\nT-Mobile's Legere, who long was vocally opposed to Trump, congratulated the president-elect on Twitter for his victory, while holding off on judging the president-elect's policies. Meanwhile another telecommunications executive, Sprint CEO Marcelo Claure, himself an immigrant and personally opposed to Trump, sent an email to employees saying that \"it's our obligation to accept the will of our fellow Americans and respect the new leader.\"\nIt's possible that Legere and Claure made nice because the president appoints the chairman and commissioners of the Federal Communications Commission, an agency that holds enormous influence over the telecommunications industry. All five FCC commissioners will see their terms expire during Trump's first term.\nCEOs of automakers, including Ford's Mark Fields, have also struck a conciliatory tone, partly because Trump has called for the repeal or renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which has allowed the automakers to set up shop in Mexico tariff-free.\nMany CEOs publicly expressed hope that the tensions dividing the country will diminish, and that American consumers will set aside their fears and get back to what they do best: shop.\n\"We are hoping that in the postelection we are just going to see people ready to spend,\" said Marvin Ellison, CEO of JCPenney.\nCEOs and companies that try to bring people together are \"going to be the winners,\" says Dr. Larry Chiagouris, a marketing professor at Pace University's Lubin School of Business. \"That always works better from a brand perspective,\" he says.\nWall Street, which donated heavily to Hillary Clinton, also now faces an administration that could provide both profit and peril.\nTrump has said he wants to roll back some of the regulations in the Dodd-Frank law that was passed after the financial crisis, a move that would benefit big Wall Street banks. But the Republican Party's platform also contains a provision calling for the return of the Glass-Steagall Act, a Great Depression-era law that broke up big banks.\nThere's talk of a massive, $1 trillion infrastructure program that could rely on tax credits to private funding sources. Many of those programs will require Wall Street's army of investment bankers and lawyers to help underwrite and finance.\n\"The president-elect's commitment to infrastructure spending, government reform and tax reform — among other things — will be good for growth and, therefore, will be good for our clients and for our firm,\" said Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein, according to a transcript of a voicemail he sent companywide.\nIn an email to his employees, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said the election of Trump shows \"the frustration that so many people have with the lack of economic opportunity and the challenges they face.\"\nTrump's victory drew a range of responses from CEOs in Silicon Valley, where popular sentiment had tilted strongly against Trump because of his statements on immigrants, women, overseas manufacturing and the use of encryption in consumer products like Apple's iPhones.\nIn a postelection email to employees, Apple CEO Cook didn't mention Trump by name but acknowledged that many people had strong feelings about the outcome of the vote. Cook had let it be known during the campaign that he didn't support Trump, although he generally avoided taking a public stance on the candidates. In his email, Cook said Apple would continue to support diversity.\nCook didn't mention encryption, which he has previously argued is essential to protect consumers' privacy. But he added, \"While there is discussion today about uncertainties ahead, you can be confident that Apple's North Star hasn't changed.\"\nMicrosoft's chief executive was more conciliatory. In a post on LinkedIn, the social networking site that Microsoft is buying, Satya Nadella wrote: \"We congratulate the president-elect, and look forward to working with all those elected yesterday.\" But Nadella added that Microsoft is committed to \"fostering a diverse and inclusive culture.\"\nFacebook's Zuckerberg, who had previously criticized Trump's call for building a wall on the Mexican border, sounded subdued in a post on his own social network.\n\"I thought about all the work ahead of us to create the world we want for our children,\" he wrote. \"This work is bigger than any presidency and progress does not move in a straight line.\"\nThe most combative response came from the CEO at Grubhub, an online food delivery service based in Chicago. Matt Maloney said in an email to employees that he rejects Trump's \"nationalist, anti-immigrant and hateful politics,\" adding that anyone who disagrees should immediately resign \"because you have no place here.\"\nMaloney later backtracked in a tweet that said \"Grubhub does not tolerate hate and we are proud of all our employees — even those who voted for Trump.\"\nOther companies have taken the election and its aftermath as a marketing opportunity, most notably airlines. British Airways ran ads on Facebook urging people to visit London, using the tag line \"had enough of this house?\" under a photo of the White House. Air New Zealand ran ads on Instagram and elsewhere highlighting the results of the election and inviting people to visit New Zealand. Spirit Airlines promoted a 75 percent off sale for flights to Canada.",

(Facebook photo) HARWINTON, CT (WFSB) - \nFirefighters in Harwinton rescued a cow that really wanted to take a dip in a swimming pool on Sunday. \nThey said they were called to a home on Locust Road around 6 p.m. \nThe cow apparently wandered onto the swimming pool cover and fell through. \nIt took heavy rope and a dozen people to pull the cow out. \nThe Harwinton Volunteer Fire Department posted a couple of photos to its Facebook page . \nFirefighters said the animal was walking after the ordeal and didn't appear to have suffered any injuries. \nCopyright 2016 WFSB (Meredith Corporation).

I know these posts are meant in solidarity, but right now they just make me feel like I am already being mourned: The worst has happened, the world is ending, and I will not save you—I will just lament the loss of your existence. \nIn two weeks, three months, a year, when these white allies who are outraged and appalled and disgusted realize that a Trump presidency will not significantly impact their day-to-day lives, are they going to abandon us? When these white allies who are outraged and appalled and disgusted realize that a Trump presidency will not significantly impact their day-to-day lives, are they going to abandon us? \nWill they put their bodies between us and the deportations, the bans, the databases, the imprisonment, the torture, the threats to our existence? Or will they post an apology for what has happened, and what is yet to come? \nI am so worried about the normalization and inevitable complacency that will set in. Already, it is happening. And yet, even as I worry about it, I understand. \nI am an anxious person, and all I want in this moment is to be reassured. My desire for comfort has never been this intense. So when I read the headlines saying that Trump is reconsidering repealing Obamacare, and that it will be much harder for him to implement all of his campaign promises than he thinks, I feel a momentary sense of relief. \nIt is hard to worry about all of the things there are to worry about, to maintain a feeling of horror, and I look for signs that my life is not going to change. I have a job; I have financial security; I am Muslim but am not easily identifiable as a Muslim; I live in the Bay Area—I will be okay. \nThis is how it happens. \nComfort is an indulgence we can't seek out now. Because, for so many people, there is no comfort. For many, there never has been. \nA friend posted an article in which Trump said he would absolutely require Muslims to register and a couple of people responded clarifying that the article was actually from 2015. I felt reassured for a moment. But what has become of the world when we can be comforted that the president-elect's demand for a religious group to register came a year ago and not yesterday? A Facebook friend suggested that if Trump actually calls for Muslims to register, everyone in the United States should do so as well to overwhelm the authorities. This is a beautiful sentiment. Would you do it? \nNormalization is happening. Complacency is happening. \nAnother Facebook friend who posted that same article suggested that if Trump actually calls for Muslims to register, everyone in the United States should do so as well to overwhelm the authorities. This is a beautiful sentiment. Would you do it? \nToo often, we let ourselves off the hook. How will we purposefully make ourselves uncomfortable when comfort is within reach? \nI'm reminded of a self-defense class I took back in the summer, when a white woman mentioned feeling guilty about crossing the street when a black man is walking toward her. The instructor said racism is systemic, not something an individual can solve, and she shouldn't feel bad for valuing her personal safety. \nRacism is systemic. Racism is individual. We have to stop letting ourselves off the hook. \nWhen your life is not on the line, and when what's required is sacrificing so many of the comforts you are accustomed to, what will you give up for the rest of us? I am asking myself this too. If I am being honest, the answer so far is very little, if anything at all. \nProtesting is important and donations are important and volunteering is important. But when you know that you can leave the protest whenever you want to return to a safe home and a warm bed and a hot shower, that is privilege, not sacrifice. \nWhat will you sacrifice? What will you give up? \nI hope the answer is a lot. Because we will need it. Get the scoop, straight from Mother Jones.

      "text": "13 What you are suggesting is that Z-Man and Facebook take on the role of social censor if they disagree with your thought process. I believe a good portion of what you already read and hear in the media has already gone this route by what they choose to report a and more importantly what they do not report. It’s called media bias and is very real when you have The Clinton campaign colluding with NYT reporters on questions being asked by feeding them to Hillary in advance. Now You want an open forum platform to openly censor anything he disagrees with. This is what I love about liberal prigressives, YOUR FASCIST TENDENCIES TO RAM YOUR INTOLERANCE at the rest of us to get your way. The reason the “marketing against Hillary” has been going on so long is that most of it consists of self inflicted facts based on her own actions over years of intolerant behavior on her part. She is a target rich environment.",

      "text": "× Facebook shows you what it believes you want to see post-election \nFacebook news feeds around the world look a lot different Wednesday, November 9th — after the election. \nYours might be one of angst and despair, or celebrations and “I told you so’s.” It depends on the people you’re friends with and the online community you’ve created with your clicks, likes and shares. \nFacebook’s algorithm knows what you like based on the videos you watch, people you talk to, and content you interact with. It then shows you more of the same. This creates something called “filter bubbles.” You begin to see only the content you like and agree with, while Facebook hides dissenting points of view. \nThis means news on Facebook comes with confirmation bias — it reinforces what you already think is true — and people are increasingly frustrated. \nFacebook denies it’s a media company, yet almost half of U.S. adults get news from Facebook. \nWhen Facebook fired its human curators and began to rely on algorithms to surface popular stories earlier this year, fake news proliferated. \nViral memes and propaganda spread among people with similar beliefs and interests. It’s cheaper and easier to create and spread ideological disinformation than deeply-researched and reported news. And it comes from all over — teens in Macedonia are responsible for a large portion of fake pro-Trump news, according to a BuzzFeed analysis. \nFilter bubbles became especially problematic during the presidential election. \nHyperpartisan news sites and fake websites distributed false stories about voter fraud, election conspiracies, and the candidates’ pasts that spread like wildfire on Facebook. It was more prevalent on right-leaning Facebook pages. As CNNMoney’s Brian Stelter said in response to the growing number of false viral stories, people should have a “triple check before you share” rule. \nOn Wednesday, many people were shocked by Trump’s victory. Words of fear and sorrow fill their Facebook feeds, and even those with thousands of friends are probably only seeing posts that echo their feelings. \nBut if you voted for Trump, chances are your feed reflects the opposite. You might see a cascade of #MakeAmericaGreatAgain hashtags and friends celebrating. \nFacebook will likely face questions about its responsibility to weed out fake sites and false stories. The company did not respond to questions about whether it plans to modify the news feed algorithms. On an earnings call in July, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg argued that social media sites actually provide more diversity of opinion than traditional news outlets. \nBut Facebook is just the vehicle with which friends and family are sharing news. It’s not necessarily about trusting the news people see on Facebook, but believing and trusting the people who are sharing it. \nThe U.S. presidential election starkly illustrated the problems with filter bubbles and personalized social networks. Almost two billion people use the social media site where friends and family share and nurture similar beliefs and false news snowballs. And it raises questions as to the civic responsibility of the world’s biggest platform — and whether or not automated fact-checking could have changed an election. ",

      "text": "Read Now Facebook and Fake News: How Big a Problem Is It for the Social Media Giant? Despite its efforts to crack down on misinformation, false news was prevalent on Facebook during the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Nov14,20162:45PMEST \nFake content could pose a greater problem for Facebook ( FB ) than simply a public relations nightmare. \nThe Pew Research Center found recently that 44% of Americans get at least some of their news from Facebook. That's a lot of people turning toward the Menlo Park, CA-based social media giant to find out what's going on in the world. \nThe main issue, however, is the prevalence of inaccurate and false news that users spread on Facebook, especially as highlighted in this year's presidential election. A recent analysis by Buzzfeed of more than 1,000 posts shared on Facebook from several news sites showed that 38% of the posts on hyper-right wing sites were either partly or entirely false, as well as 19% of those on hyper-left wing pages. By contrast, 99.3% of the posts on mainstream sites that Buzzfeed analyzed were partly or entirely truthful. \nBut websites pumping out false content generate a higher number of Facebook shares, comments and reactions than traditional mainstream political sites. Buzzfeed found that Occupy Democrats, the hyperpartisan site with the greatest median shares per post, earned 10,931 shares per post while, CNN Politics only garnered a median of 50 shares per post. \nWith lots of inaccurate content swarming news feeds, the New York Times said recently that fake news has become \"media's next challenge.\" Prev 0 of 4 Next If you liked this article you might like ",

      "text": "Writer for NBC Sports. Quasi-Attorney. Columbus, Ohio. 6 mins ago Bubbles, echo chambers, Facebook and connection trumping community We’ve heard much lately about how liberals live in a bubble. About how they fail to understand people different than they are and, to the extent they do have impressions of conservatives, middle Americans and the working class, they come by virtue of caricature and exaggeration via stereotype and pop culture. They are told that they do not understand “Real Americans.” There is truth to that, of course. Not the “Real Americans Part. We’re all “Real Americans.” But If you live in New York, San Francisco or Los Angeles and don’t leave very often there is a whole lot of America you don’t see and a whole lot of the American experience of which you are ignorant. And Lord knows that coastal media and Hollywood are good at portraying rural dwellers and blue collar people as buffoons. I’m a pretty liberal guy myself, and even though I grew up Michigan and West Virginia and even though I live in a conservative part of Ohio, I’ll admit that I place myself in — or find myself in — various bubbles fairly often and find myself shouting into various echo chambers. I’ll also admit that conservative or working class people from Michigan, West Virginia, Ohio and places like them are quite often misrepresented, misunderstood and condescended to by the media and by Hollywood. I’m struggling, however, to understand why conservatives are not called to the same account for placing themselves in the same sorts of bubbles and shouting into the same sorts of echo chambers. When do these people come into substantive contact with people terribly different from themselves? Even the more progressive cities in Red State America are insanely, if informally, segregated. My neighbors don’t make it to New York very often. They don’t know many people of color, gay people or immigrants. They don’t even know many garden variety white liberals. I’ve lived in my conservative suburb for 12 years and most people I meet here are still shocked when I espouse even mild liberal sentiment. And make no mistake, liberals are stereotyped and misunderstood as well. Identified by our (alleged) Volvos, lattes and NPR podcasts just as inaccurately as conservatives and the working class are identified by their (alleged) pickup trucks, guns and Fox News. The fact is, most of us live in reality-distorting bubbles. More so now than we have in close to a century. We’re doing so because, despite the fact that we live in an information-rich age of connection, we are systematically eschewing the idea of community. The great promise of communications technology, the Internet and social media was one of connection. The rush that amateur radio enthusiasts get when coming into contact with someone on the other side of the world conspicuously found its way into the earliest stories and advertisements of the Internet and Information Age. The excitement born of connecting with someone a world away from our own homes. These ideas were emphasized because of the positive connotations surrounding the idea of “connection.” But while we tend to think of the concept of connection as a good thing which implies universal harmony, “connection” is a morally and ethically neutral word with no inherent universal implications. People involved in hand-to-hand combat can be said to be connecting. Factions can connect. One warlord can connect with the troops he rallies in one part of a disputed land while another connects with his in another. Connection is not all holding hands and singing “Kumbaya.” Indeed, the connections fostered by the Information Age are not very Kumbaya-y at all. The reason is not strictly technological, however. It’s become coarser and more adversarial by virtue of the systems and incentives in place to form, or not, form a larger community and the very nature of humanity For all of the advancements of civilization, we’re not too far removed from being just another animal in the animal kingdom. Our nature, as demonstrated by countless psychological studies, is still pretty animal-like. We’re prone to making hard distinctions between friend and foe, resource or threat. If we are sufficiently benefitted or if our very survival is at stake, we will move out of a place of safety. If we are not, we will stay in our safe valley with our preferred tribe. As we evolved, we moved from the savanna to village to city and to nation. For the vast majority of this history, however, our tribalism was still not strongly discouraged. For a long time societies were relatively homogenous, culturally speaking, and dividing the world into “us” and “them” remained pretty simple and useful. Once societies became less homogenous, divisions of race, sex and class and the legal structures used to enforce those divisions continued to encourage tribalism and segregation, forced or chosen, depending upon one’s race, sex or class. While we have never been able to do away with international rivalries or internal divisiveness fostered by racism, sexism and class, we came really far in the past century or so. This is due, obviously, in large part to some great, brave and visionary leaders, thinkers and, in some cases, martyrs, whether they became famous or not. It was also made possible by technological advances which allowed some to spend less time on the business of basic survival and more time on ideas and the promotion of the betterment of humankind. Urbanization has obviously played a role too, in that when people live in closer quarters with their neighbors they tend to either want to or need to get along with them as best they can, whatever their background happens to be. But in addition to all of those things, there is still some of that human animal stuff at work too. A lot of it, actually. That “friend-or-foe” and “fight for survival” stuff. It was a bit of twist on that old idea, though. Rather than stick with our tribes and exhibit hostility toward others, we began to come around to the idea that our very survival depended upon constructive and civil interaction with those different than us which, in turn, was self-beneficial in an almost evolutionary sense. Maybe in a literal evolutionary sense. Though conflict, often bloody conflict, continued, an increasingly shared culture emerged as the 20th century progressed in America. While the civil rights movement and its leaders worked toward and brought about legal and political change, telegraph cables, newswires, motion pictures, radio, television, mass media made segregating ourselves off culturally much harder to do than it had been before. Culturally, we entered the world of the “short tail,” in which the outlets and products weren’t numerous — a small number of networks, publications and shared cultural spaces wielded considerable influence — but in which they served as a stickier bit of social and cultural glue than that which had come before, when everyone was either denied access to the means of social, cultural and informational currency or else cloistered themselves away from the masses. These shared spaces, whatever their faults (and there were many), made the world smaller and fostered connection. Connection, as I noted, is neutral, but connection via these means had at least one positive trait: consensus. Or at least a very rough and loose one. And through consensus, a more civil society and, eventually, community. When you’re only connecting with likeminded people of your own race and social class, you can say all manner of awful things out loud about people who are different than you. Indeed, in that environment, engaging in that kind of awful discourse is not just something you can do, it’s something you should do. It shows you to be a good member of the tribe. It’s good for your social status which, over time and generations, is good for your survival and the survival of your genes. Ask an Ivy League legacy or someone whose lineage made its way through the House of Lords how that works. In the 20th century, that calculus began to change. The cities became bigger, and the dissemination of information, the means of communication and the places of commerce became more robust and more widely shared. National news programs and magazines and common entertainment and commercial outlets developed. With them came a larger shared culture and more universally shared public square, so to speak. In that environment, rather than be rewarded for bolstering the insular values of one’s tribe, there were extreme social costs to advocating divisive ideas or espousing divisive sentiments. If you said on TV what you said in the privacy of the lounge at the Harvard men’s club, you’d cause a scandal. If you shouted about your issues with a given racial minority while at the drug store in a big city, you’d cause a scene. If you spouted off in a profane and obnoxious manner about a given political development while on a first date with someone you met through work or school, you’d not only not get a second date, your name may have been Mudd at work or school afterward. As I said above, there were a lot of negatives to that short tail, pre-Information Age world of (rough) cultural consensus. Superficially speaking It fostered a cultural conformity and homogeneity that was often stifling. More significantly, it was never a perfect consensus in an actually substantive, institutional manner. Just below the superficial surface of that broad cultural consensus the old lines of racism, sexism and classism remained. Just because we could see people of color in public spaces once closed off to them or in programs on television didn’t mean that they had achieved equality. Just because a woman had a newspaper column did not mean that the voice of women was heard. The civil rights movement did not end racism, the women’s rights movement did not end sexism, Stonewall did not end homophobia. But that large national square and shared means of cultural exchange did serve to encourage us to publicly agree that, as Americans, we were part of a larger community than just ourselves. To agree, again, at least publicly, that social progress was a good thing, that getting along with people different than we are was a good thing and that, when it comes right down to it, our fates are interconnected and that that was a good thing. If one did not assent, at least publicly, to these concepts — if one did not agree that, whatever differences we had as to the means of solving our national problems, we had similar, pluralistic ends in mind couched in equality — one risked becoming an outcast or fringe dweller whose political, social or cultural status was at risk. An animal on the savanna without the protection of the herd. While it may seem superficial given that underlying, insidious racism, sexism and classism remained strong, the “publicly” here mattered. Public words make ideas powerful. Repeated enough, they become conventional wisdom and, over time, policy. When the words that are acceptable in public are generally positive it leads, generally, to positive policies and, hopefully, outcomes. When they are toxic and divisive, so too follow the policies and outcomes. When there is a fear of a social cost and isolation attaching to divisive rhetoric, there is less of that rhetoric and less of that policy over time. When toxic and divisive rhetoric is encouraged, there is obviously more. When a consensus rooted in the broad desire for good ends to be met and equality to be fostered, and when that desire is supported by a system of cultural exchange and communication that encourages inclusion and sanctions divisiveness, something akin to a community is formed. We’ve never had a perfect one in this country, but for several decades, we were on our way to forming one, however haltingly we marched. Racism and those other assorted ills were not being eliminated, but we were heading in the right direction as quickly as a country as large and diverse and a political system as resistant to radical change as ours could manage. A 19th century American transported in time to, say, 1985, would rightly note that we, as Americans, had formed a far larger and far more open community than they would ever have envisioned. Which brings us to the Internet and the Information Age. Whatever Facebook’s intentions are — and I believe them to be good ones even if, at the moment, they are being blamed by some for ushering Donald Trump into office  — it and the other digital giants of the Information Age have changed the calculus of connection and community. They have, unwittingly, eliminated the social costs of being divisive and hateful and for rejecting, publicly, the idea of pluralism, equality and community. This is mostly because people are no longer forced to be part of a greater community in order to obtain its social benefits and avoid the social costs. It is now possible to silo ourselves off with likeminded people in ways that would have caused us to be outcasts a mere 30 years ago. To seek out news and information from sources which cater to our tribal urges rather than march out onto that large public square and engage in anywhere near the amount of shared social and cultural experience we once did. Whereas we once feared that, if we act in ways that undermine community, we will be shunned, we now know for certain that there are many who share these views, eliminating the costs of trafficking in them. That we can meet with them from the comfort of our own homes rather than go to a Klan rally is all the better. And, hey, look! They have pictures of their grandchildren! They’re not evil. They’re nice people! And so too am I, then, for thinking as they do. Facebook is not alone in this, of course. Amazon does the same thing with our commercial needs. We need not interact in the greater community to buy all manner of products and can, metaphorically speaking, rant all manner of things while visiting the drug store. Netflix does it with our entertainment needs, preventing us from having to watch television shows which strive to reach a mass audience or attend movies or shows with a diverse cross section of people. Dating sites with an increasingly granular demographic focus keep us from worrying about saying the wrong thing in front of that man or woman who our coworkers set us up with. To the contrary, we can know, beforehand, whether they too believe that this or that racial minority should be put in internment camps. Maybe we even met them on DeplorablesOnly.com. Put simply, there is no longer a social price to pay for being tribal and close-minded and there is little if any incentive to connect with those who would even begin to think differently than we do. To the extent we do still do so it’s at our places of employment, where, for the most part, those sorts of conversations are discouraged or on social media with someone we know from a pre-Information Age time, such as old school friends or family members. And make no mistake: while the examples I’m offering skew heavily toward a certain ideological mindset, the liberal and progressive left fall victim to the same thing, albeit in a different way. On one level it may not be as obviously harmful in that, for the most part, liberals and progressives still believe in social progress and equality in ways that newly emboldened element of the right apparently does not. The bubbles and echo chambers we inhabit have served, however, to impose a pace of progress and a social cost of departing from community consensus about that progress with which many outside of our bubble are simply not comfortable or able to handle at times. I’d argue to the death that our ends are still noble and compatible with community, but there is a case to be made that our self-segregation from the larger community has caused us to become insensitive to those who, in the past, may have come around to our goals due to that social cost and benefit analysis. We should never compromise those ends, but if we are not open to discussing the means in a community context, we make achieving them all the harder. All of us are connecting at a pace and in manner unprecedented in human history. But our sense of community has suffered for it. It is folly to suggest going back in time and to undo technological advancements that are, on the surface, neutral ones. We aren’t un-inventing Facebook. We aren’t getting rid of Amazon, Netflix or the Internet at large. Once millions of people found out that their tribe was much bigger than they thought it was, there was no going back. We all know now that there are countless, seemingly normal people who passionately believe in things that, 30 years ago, they believed were too controversial to repeat in polite society. We likewise know that those who oppose such views possess far less community or moral authority to which they can resort in order to engage those beliefs, to discourage them or to encourage other, more positive behavior. Our nascent collective community of the 20th century has devolved into a high tech tribal existence. Pretending that does not exist and will not be a part of our society for a long, long time is to engage in delusion. But all is not lost. Civilization has almost destroyed itself countless times over, from the times of primitive tribal warfare through the era of World Wars themselves. While tribalism possesses a frighteningly strong attraction, humanity has come too far to succumb to it without a fight. The central challenge of the Information Age is figuring out how to encourage and incentivize communityrather than mere connection. I don’t know exactly how to do that. It’ll likely be a long and complicated process tied up in how we structure our lives and where the social rewards lie. But it’s an essential task. It can start with the way Information Age giants like Facebook set their goals and set out to achieve them. And, as they do so, all of us will play a part.",

      "text": "One of the world’s most popular means of communication, Facebook’s WhatsApp, is adding fully encrypted video calling to its messaging app, a move that comes as privacy advocates worry about the potential for stepped-up government surveillance under a Trump administration. \nWhatsApp, which boasts more than 1 billion users worldwide, adopted end-to-end encryption early this year, making it technically impossible for the company or government authorities to read messages or listen to calls. \nThe new video calling service will thus provide another means for people to communicate without fear of eavesdropping, though WhatsApp does retain other data such as an individual’s list of contacts. \nWhatsApp co-founder Jan Koum said in an interview that video calls would be rolled out to 180 countries within hours after the feature was introduced at an event in India. \n“We obviously try to be in tune with what our users want,” Koum said at the company’s unmarked Mountain View, Calif., headquarters. “We’re obsessed with making sure that voice and video work well even on low-end phones.” \nKoum told Reuters that improvements in phone cameras, battery life and bandwidth had made the service viable for a significant proportion of WhatsApp users, even those using inexpensive smartphones. \nApple aapl offers its FaceTime video calls to iPhone users, and the Microsoft msft Skype app supports video calls on multiple platforms. But WhatsApp has built a massive installed base of mobile customers and has been steadily adding more features to what began as a simple chat application. \nPrice of Allegiance WhatsApp has operated with some autonomy since Facebook fb bought it in 2014. Koum and co-founder Brian Acton, longtime Yahoo engineers who started the company in 2009, now have 200 staff, mostly engineers and customer support, up from 50 when Facebook bought it. \nKoum said Facebook has allowed WhatsApp to use its servers and bandwidth around the world for voice and now video. That support will help spread the souped-up WhatsApp much farther and faster, he said. \nBut the corporate allegiance also has a price. After years of pledging that it would not share information about users with Facebook, which already has digital dossiers on its own 1.7 billion users, WhatsApp revised its privacy statement in August to say it would do exactly that. That means Facebook knows whom WhatsApp users contact and their phone numbers. \nSome users complained, but Koum said that he had not seen a shift in behavior. “In terms of security and privacy, what people care about the most is the privacy of their messages,” he said. \nThe video service is well integrated and adds a few twists. Users can move around the thumbnail video showing what their correspondent sees and flick a video call in progress to the side to minimize it while checking texts or email. \nKoum said WhatsApp remained committed to security after the U.S. election of Donald Trump as president last week heightened fears of increased surveillance. \nTrump, along with some leading congressional Republicans and FBI Director James Comey, has advocated requiring tech companies to turn over customer information in many circumstances, a position which, if put into law, could require companies including WhatsApp to completely redesign their services. \nOther countries including China and the United Kingdom also take a dim view of encryption. \nBut Koum said he not see a major threat to his service, noting that diplomats and officials use WhatsApp in many countries. \n“It would be like them shooting themselves in the foot.” ",

      "text": "Zuckerberg: 'Crazy' to say Facebook influenced election By Barbara Ortutay AP Technology Writer Updated: 11/15/2016 08:02:05 AM EST Click photo to enlarge FILE - In this Tuesday, April 12, 2016, file photo, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg delivers the keynote address at the F8 Facebook Developer Conference, in San Francisco. In an interview Thursday, Nov. 10, 2016, with \"The Facebook Effect\" author David Kirkpatrick, Zuckerberg said the idea that Facebook influenced the outcome of the U.S. election is a \"crazy idea.\" (AP Photo/Eric Risberg, File) « 1 » \nNEW YORK (AP) — Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg says the idea that fake news spread on Facebook influenced the outcome of the U.S. election is \"crazy.\" \nStill, the majority of Americans (six in 10) say they get at least some news from social media , mostly Facebook, according to the Pew Research Center. While a lot of this news comes from established outlets — whether CNN or BuzzFeed News, misinformation spreads on Facebook just as information does, shared by users, recommended by software and amplified by both. \nSources of spurious information have ranged from news articles produced by \"content farms\" for the sole purpose of getting clicks, to \"hyperpartisan\" sites from both sides of the political spectrum, churning out stories that are misleading at best. \nCase in point: \"FBI AGENT SUSPECTED IN HILLARY EMAIL LEAKS FOUND DEAD IN APPARENT MURDER-SUICIDE\" — a fabricated headline from a fake news site called the Denver Guardian, was shared thousands of times in the days leading up to the election. \nIs it possible that voters were swayed for or against a candidate, much like those same people might buy a product after seeing an ad on Facebook? \nZuckerberg says voters deserve more credit. \nDuring an interview Thursday with \"The Facebook Effect\" author David Kirkpatrick, Zuckerberg said idea that people voted the way they did because of bogus information on Facebook shows a \"profound lack of empathy\" for supporters of Donald Trump. Advertisement \n\"Voters make decisions based on their lived experience,\" he said. \nGiven the acerbic political contest from which the country just emerged, when countless longtime friends, even family, were unfriended, many are left to wonder if there would be an alternative American history being written today if it were not for Facebook, Twitter and the like. \nThis, after all, was the first truly social media election, playing out on Twitter and Facebook as much or more than it did on major networks, in living rooms and around watercoolers. \nBut isn't social media just a reflection of our world as it exists? Has Facebook become an easy scapegoat when the answer is far more complex? \nWhile Pew found that many believe political discussions on social media to be \"uniquely angry and disrespectful,\" a comparable number have the same impression of face-to-face conversations when it comes to Democrats, the GOP, or another party. \nFILTER BUBBLE? \nWhen it comes to Facebook users, Zuckerberg said almost everyone has friends on the \"other side.\" Even if 90 percent of your friends are Democrats, for example, 10 percent will be Republican. Still, that's not a very big number, and the idea of a \"filter bubble\" — that social media allows people to surround themselves only with the people and ideas with whom they agree, has been a hot topic this election cycle. \n\"By far the biggest filter in the system is not that the content isn't there, that you don't have friends who support the other candidate or that are of another religion,\" Zuckerberg said. \"But it's that you just don't click on it. You actually tune it out when you see it. I don't know what to do about that.\" \nA DIFFICULT LINE \nFacebook has long denied that it's a publisher or a media company, or that it acts remotely like either. Its cheery slogan — to make the world more \"open and connected\" — seemingly invites a broad range of viewpoints, diverse, lively discussion and the free flow of information, rather than censorship. \nBut it could also make clamping down on fake news difficult. At a time when everyone seems entitled, not just to their own opinions, but to their own facts, one person's misleading headline might be another person's heartfelt truth. \n\"We take misinformation on Facebook very seriously,\" Adam Mosseri, the executive in charge of Facebook's news feed, said in a statement to the tech blog TechCrunch this week. \"We value authentic communication, and hear consistently from those who use Facebook that they prefer not to see misinformation.\" \nFacebook acknowledges that it has more work to do, and it seems to be putting a lot of faith in the power of data, artificial intelligence and algorithms as the solution. \nOver the summer, Facebook fired the small group of journalists in charge of its \"trending\" items and replaced them with an algorithm. The catalyst appeared to be a report in a tech blog, based on an anonymous source, that the editors routinely suppressed conservative viewpoints. \nSubsequently, fake stories ahead of the election began to trend.",

The CEO downplayed the impact on its users, but if Facebook's ads can influence purchase decisions, as it claims, why wouldn't the site similarly influence people's politics? More like this Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry CIO | Nov 15, 2016 6:25 AM PT RELATED TOPICS Comments \nThe leaders of Facebook, the world's largest social network, which reaches 1.18 billion people every day, want to absolve the company from any responsibility for the potential proliferation of misinformation on its platform. As the dust settles following a polarized presidential election, Facebook is trying to defend itself against claims of impropriety and unchecked influence on American politics. \nThe social giant is taking hits from all sides of the political spectrum and CEO Mark Zuckerberg is walking a challenging line as he tries to placate Facebook's critics. In May, he met with a group of conservative leaders to dismiss reports that Facebook's team of curators in charge of its Trending Topics had deliberately suppressed stories from right-leaning news outlets. Then, in a blog post published four days after the election , Zuckerberg defended the social network as a neutral party that doesn't bear the same responsibilities as a news source and said Facebook should be \"extremely cautious about becoming arbiters of truth ourselves.\" Facebook advocates influence, shirks responsibility \nPolitics aside, the contradictions Zuckerberg made about the social network's influence and its potential impact on users could become a glaring problem. If the content, including any misinformation, that Facebook distributes to more than 1.79 billion people every month can't influence the outcome of an election, just how effective are the $6.8 billion in ads it sold during the third quarter of 2016 ? \n[ Related: How social media is shaping the 2016 presidential election ] \nFacebook proudly claims its highly targeted advertising can influence purchase decisions, and it accepts some responsibility for giving a voice to disenfranchised people who have organized uprisings in the Middle East and elsewhere around the world. Back home in the United States, however, Facebook tells a more nuanced story to boost the most important aspect of its success. There's no denying Facebook is the world's largest media platform, but the company is unwilling to deem itself a media company — and accept all the responsibilities that come with that distinction. \nZuckerberg publicly addressed Facebook's latest storm of criticism at a conference last week, but he dug in deeper in the blog post published Saturday. \"Many people are asking whether fake news contributed to the [election] result, and what our responsibility is to prevent fake news from spreading,\" he wrote. \"Of all the content on Facebook, more than 99 percent of what people see is authentic. Only a very small amount is fake news and hoaxes. The hoaxes that do exist are not limited to one partisan view, or even to politics. Overall, this makes it extremely unlikely hoaxes changed the outcome of this election in one direction or the other.\" \nFacebook introduced new controls to flag fake news and admits there is more it can do to this end, but \"identifying the truth is complicated,\" Zuckerberg wrote. \"While some hoaxes can be completely debunked, a greater amount of content, including from mainstream sources, often gets the basic idea right but some details wrong or omitted.\" Facebook can't have it both ways \nFacebook's reluctance to identify itself as a media company has built for the past few years, as its influence grew accordingly. However, Zuckerberg sang a different tune as late as 2013 when the company introduced a News Feed redesign that aimed to reposition Facebook as a legitimate news source. \"What we're trying to do is give everyone in the world the best newspaper we can,\" he said at Facebook headquarters, according to a ClickZ.com report . \"We think there's a really important place for a personalized newspaper like this.\" \n[ Related: Twitter's impact on 2016 presidential election is unmistakable ] \nOne of Facebook's greatest strengths is its capability to connect people and present them with relevant content using its proprietary algorithm. Zuckerberg and his team must now defend the very veracity of the content it distributes while downplaying its significance on culture and politics. \nUltimately, Facebook is not responsible for the outcome of a presidential election — that duty goes to the electorate — but it's a stretch to suggest the company has no significant influence on its users' opinions.

      "text": "NEW YORK (AP) — Apple CEO Tim Cook is telling his employees to \"keep moving forward.\" Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is saying \"progress does not move in a straight line.\" T-Mobile's CEO John Legere tweeted \"let's see what an out of the box, non-typical, non-politician can do for America!\"\nCEOs of major companies are taking stands about the results of the election — a departure from the traditional model of not mixing politics with business that major brands have long espoused.\nSome are using it as an opportunity to bring their employees together following a divisive election campaign. Others are using it as an opportunity to stress their companies' values and mission, or an opportunity to make nice with Trump, who many CEOs were publicly against during the campaign.\nThe men and women who head the nation's biggest companies know that having a hostile relationship with the Trump administration could make doing business difficult. They also know that they operate in liberal bastions like New York and San Francisco just as much as in Trump-leaning places like Fort Wayne, Indiana, or Charleston, West Virginia.\n\"Neutral is the best policy,\" says John Challenger, CEO of workplace consultant Challenger, Gray & Christmas.\nT-Mobile's Legere, who long was vocally opposed to Trump, congratulated the president-elect on Twitter for his victory last week, while holding off on judging the president-elect's policies. Meanwhile another telecommunications executive, Sprint CEO Marcelo Claure, himself an immigrant and personally opposed to Trump, sent an email to employees saying that \"it's our obligation to accept the will of our fellow Americans and respect the new leader.\"\nIt's possible that Legere and Claure made nice because the president appoints the chairman and commissioners of the Federal Communications Commission, an agency that holds enormous influence over the telecommunications industry. All five FCC commissioners will see their terms expire during Trump's first term.\nCEOs of automakers, including Ford's Mark Fields, have also struck a conciliatory tone, partly because Trump has called for the repeal or renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which has allowed the automakers to set up shop in Mexico tariff-free.\nMany CEOs publicly expressed hope that the tensions dividing the country will diminish, and that American consumers will set aside their fears and get back to what they do best: shop.\n\"We are hoping that in the postelection we are just going to see people ready to spend,\" said Marvin Ellison, CEO of JCPenney.\nCEOs and companies that try to bring people together are \"going to be the winners,\" says Dr. Larry Chiagouris, a marketing professor at Pace University's Lubin School of Business. \"That always works better from a brand perspective,\" he says.\nWall Street, which donated heavily to Hillary Clinton, also now faces an administration that could provide both profit and peril.\nTrump has said he wants to roll back some of the regulations in the Dodd-Frank law that was passed after the financial crisis, a move that would benefit big Wall Street banks. But the Republican Party's platform also contains a provision calling for the return of the Glass-Steagall Act, a Great Depression-era law that broke up big banks.\nThere's talk of a massive, $1 trillion infrastructure program that could rely on tax credits to private funding sources. Many of those programs will require Wall Street's army of investment bankers and lawyers to help underwrite and finance.\n\"The president-elect's commitment to infrastructure spending, government reform and tax reform — among other things — will be good for growth and, therefore, will be good for our clients and for our firm,\" said Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein, according to a transcript of a voicemail he sent companywide.\nIn an email to his employees, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said the election of Trump shows \"the frustration that so many people have with the lack of economic opportunity and the challenges they face.\"\nTrump's victory drew a range of responses from CEOs in Silicon Valley, where popular sentiment had tilted strongly against Trump because of his statements on immigrants, women, overseas manufacturing and the use of encryption in consumer products like Apple's iPhones.\nIn a postelection email to employees, Apple CEO Cook didn't mention Trump by name but acknowledged that many people had strong feelings about the outcome of the vote. Cook had let it be known during the campaign that he didn't support Trump, although he generally avoided taking a public stance on the candidates. In his email, Cook said Apple would continue to support diversity.\nCook didn't mention encryption, which he has previously argued is essential to protect consumers' privacy. But he added, \"While there is discussion today about uncertainties ahead, you can be confident that Apple's North Star hasn't changed.\"\nMicrosoft's chief executive was more conciliatory. In a post on LinkedIn, the social networking site that Microsoft is buying, Satya Nadella wrote: \"We congratulate the president-elect, and look forward to working with all those elected yesterday.\" But Nadella added that Microsoft is committed to \"fostering a diverse and inclusive culture.\"\nFacebook's Zuckerberg, who had previously criticized Trump's call for building a wall on the Mexican border, sounded subdued in a post on his own social network.\n\"I thought about all the work ahead of us to create the world we want for our children,\" he wrote. \"This work is bigger than any presidency and progress does not move in a straight line.\"\nThe most combative response came from the CEO at Grubhub, an online food delivery service based in Chicago. Matt Maloney said in an email to employees that he rejects Trump's \"nationalist, anti-immigrant and hateful politics,\" adding that anyone who disagrees should immediately resign \"because you have no place here.\"\nMaloney later backtracked in a tweet that said \"Grubhub does not tolerate hate and we are proud of all our employees — even those who voted for Trump.\"\nOther companies have taken the election and its aftermath as a marketing opportunity, most notably airlines. British Airways ran ads on Facebook urging people to visit London, using the tag line \"had enough of this house?\" under a photo of the White House. Air New Zealand ran ads on Instagram and elsewhere highlighting the results of the election and inviting people to visit New Zealand. Spirit Airlines promoted a 75 percent off sale for flights to Canada.\nAP Technology Writer Brandon Bailey contributed to this report from San Francisco.

Post to Facebook Mic drop: Oreo just released a candy bar Cookie lovers rejoice!  //usat.ly/2fVVIrF   Mic drop: Oreo just released a candy bar USA Today Network Mary Bowerman , USA TODAY Network 11:52 a.m. EST November 15, 2016 Nom! (Photo: OREO) \nCookie lovers rejoice! \nThe maker of Oreo cookies is making waves in the candy aisle with the release of a new Milka Oreo Big Crunch candy bar. \nThat's right, an Oreo candy bar. The new candy is a combination of Oreo cookie pieces and vanilla cream filling encased in Milka European chocolate candy. \nThe bars were released in time for holiday shoppers, and will be a permanent offering, according to a statement from Mondelez International, the maker of Oreo and Milka. \nThe company decided to pair Oreo and Milka chocolate to “diversify the Oreo product portfolio,” Samantha Greenwood, Senior Category Director, Chocolate-North America, said in a statement. \n“The combination of these two global powerhouse brands has led to a product line that is unique and truly differentiated in the U.S. chocolate candy category,” she said. \nThe bars, which have been available overseas, will hit shelves at Wal-Mart, Kroger, ShopRite and Albertsons, this week, and will roll-out nationally in January 2017. \nIt's up to you whether you want to dip them in milk. \nFollow @MaryBowerman on Twitter.",

      "text": "This Friday, REM come to London! Not to play a reunion show, sadly, but to talk about their career and the 25th anniversary of their album Out of Time , which is getting the deluxe reissue treatment, also on Friday.\nOn 18 November, Michael Stipe and Mike Mills from the band will be in conversation with the Guardian’s John Harris, and we will stream the event live on our Facebook page . Stipe and Mills will also be taking your questions. So if there’s something you desperately want to ask them about the contrary career of one of the most unlikely superstar bands in pop history, email your question to: R.E.M.Ques@umusic.com .\nREM on Out of Time at 25: ‘Being the voice of a generation is not a pretty place to be’ Read more \nAs Michael Stipe told our own Michael Hann recently: “You can fuck with people if you’re gonna be contrarian. And we were always contrarian about it. We would go on stage and perform the four songs everyone knew. This was 1987. We would open the set with the four songs everyone knew, then – the real fans, you can stay. Everyone else go home, go drink somewhere else, go flirt somewhere else … But we were always contrarian, and we were always pushing ourselves to do things differently. To not have the same setlist every night, to not allow it to become a job. We were throwing marbles under our feet at every turn to try to trip ourselves, to try to not allow it to become quotidian. Is that the word? Uninteresting, mediocre, boring.”\nThis promises to be a fascinating event – especially because it is their first chance to speak publically about Donald Trump’s America. So tune in on Friday – Stipe and Mills take to the stage at 12.30pm – and see what they have to say about the life of REM and the state of the US.",

      "text": "On Election Day, they showed up wearing pantsuits.\nFor many women, it's already their daily work uniform. Others haven't worn one in years. Still others went out to buy one to mark the occasion. For the first time in American history, a woman was on the ballot as the Democratic candidate for president and, thanks to a movement that spread via social media, many women were adopting Hillary Clinton's penchant for pantsuits as they voted.\nIn Alabama, thousands of women posted photos of themselves, along with stories about what they were wearing, in a place where they could share such often-personal information, where they didn't have to worry than anyone would \"troll\" their post or say anything negative at all.\nIn Alabama, that place was a Facebook group that grew out of a 3-million-strong national group, Pantsuit Nation.\nBy Tuesday, the Alabama group had become a haven for the 7,000-plus women who had joined it in its first four days of existence. Throughout the day, the page was filled with photos of smiling women of all ages, proudly casting their vote for Clinton, sometimes accompanied by their significant others, their children, their friends and even by their late mothers and grandmothers, whose jewelry and other items they wore.\nNot all of them wore pantsuits. Some wore all-white, in honor of the suffragettes who fought for the 19 th Amendment – and that's a big deal in Alabama, where most women know you just don't wear white after Labor Day, even if it's 90 degrees outside.\nLater that evening, though, the excitement and optimism of the Alabama group had turned to shock, sorrow and anger, as the election results indicated that Clinton would not be the first female president after all. Over the next few days, though, the membership continued to grow – in just one week, it hit the 10,000-member mark – as women shared their thoughts and feelings with each other in a supportive environment.\nImmediately, the members vowed to continue working together in the future, in some way.\n\"The best thing to happen as a result of this crazy election: This page,\" wrote one.\n'Part of a community'\nThe secret group was the brainchild of Alabama native Amy LeePard, 36, who lives in Northport and works in higher education technology at the University of Alabama.\nLeePard was inspired to create the group when she saw a member in the larger Pantsuit Nation group refer to herself as \"a single blue dot in Alabama.\"\nAs \"someone more progressive than my state as a whole,\" she said, she knows how \"disenfranchising and silencing\" that can be. \"I know many people in this election have felt very isolated. I wanted to respond to that, to give them an opportunity to connect and know they're part of a community.\"\nAfter she created the group on the Saturday morning before the election on Tuesday, she shared the new Alabama group in the larger Pantsuit Nation and started receiving 100 requests an hour for the rest of the day.\n\"It kept growing and growing,\" she said in an interview the evening of the election. \"It was really amazing and intense to see how significant it's been for some people as a space for solidarity and community.\"\nIn the first few days, LeePard was surprised to read comments from members who \"aren't afraid anymore,\" she said. \"I didn't quite expect that. People are living with a lot more fear than I realized.\"\nShe has enjoyed the powerful stories of families that were shared with the group. \"A sense of family and connection is so important to Southerners,\" she said.\nThe membership covers a lot of ground, she said, from atheists to Southern Baptists, from Republican voters who voted for a Democrat for the first time in this election to former Bernie Sanders supporters – and being female is not a prerequisite.\n\"The unifying thread is an acknowledgement that many of the things this election has emboldened are not okay, not messages we want to pass on to our children,\" she said. \"This election has been very polarizing and distasteful in a way I don't think has been the case for a presidential election before.\"\nThe Facebook group she created \"has been a space of positivity, encouragement, support and empowerment,\" she said. Friendships have been formed, issues discussed – sometimes heatedly – and plans have been made to become more formally organized.\nMeanwhile, LeePard has watched in awe as the members governed themselves, which is exactly what she wanted. \"It's important to me to be a facilitator, but not control what's happening,\" she said.\nMaking communities kinder, safer\nLeePard's long day Tuesday started at the polls early in the morning – she voted at the community park she fought to save about a year ago – and ended when she took her 92-year-old maternal grandmother to vote and then out to dinner. \"My Granny is one of my best friends,\" she said. \"We've gone to vote together many times.\"\nHer grandmother, who lives in Tuscaloosa, once felt disenfranchised herself. She grew up in Louisiana where, when she was a young voter, men would accompany women into the voting booth to make sure they voted the \"right\" way. As a result, she stopped voting for a long time.\n\"It's important to me that she votes, so our tradition is to vote together,\" LeePard said.\nHer grandmother's 95-year-old sister lives in New Orleans. LeePard acknowledged that this could be the sisters' last presidential election, and she lamented the fact that they had to hear \"such disgusting things\" from Clinton's opponent (she doesn't say his name) throughout the campaign.\n\"It's unbelievable to them, and disheartening to me,\" she said. \"It's sad to see their generation exposed\" to such vulgarity and vitriol at the end of their lives.\nPolitical activism runs in her blood. LeePard's paternal grandparents registered minority voters in Birmingham in the 1960s and \"received threats for doing so,\" she said. \"I appreciate what the right to vote means, what social justice means, regardless of who you vote for.\"\nSeveral days after the election, LeePard said that there's been so much activity in the group's first full week of existence that it's difficult for her to keep up with it all. From the statewide group, other groups have been formed in North Alabama, Birmingham, Mobile and other areas. LeePard and other administrators have talked at length about how to move forward to heal communities while minimizing anger and divisiveness.\nIn the meantime, simple things can make a big difference, she said. \"What we can change is how much we do in our communities. We can be kinder. There are many actions that we can take in our everyday lives and communities to create the kind of world we want our children to inherit, a world we want to live in where our friends and family members are safe.\"\nAgain and again in the group that's now \"secret,\" meaning it can't be found by non-members, she said she's seeing \"a lot of hope\" in the members' posts, with \"people wanting to do better.\" \"It's not a matter of Republican or Democrat, it's how we agree to treat each other and take care of our neighbors.\" Making communities kinder and safer, she said, is \"nonpartisan\" and something every American should be working toward.\n\"This is an incredible opportunity to band together, support each other and recognize that action starts very locally.\"",

A lot of factors went into devising these rankings, including, but not limited to, front office competency, coaching longevity and future outlook, the direction of the franchise and whether a team has a franchise quarterback in place. With that said, let's get to the rankings, starting with the most functional team in the league… 1. New England Patriots \nBill Belichick has made some questionable moves in the last year , but this team hasn't missed the postseason with a healthy Tom Brady since 2002. Nothing dysfunctional about that. 2. Seattle Seahawks \nThe Seahawks have a smart general manager, a good head coach, a young franchise quarterback, and a cadre of defensive stars in the their prime and locked up to long-term deals. Seattle is going to be good for a very long time. FACEBOOK 29. San Diego Chargers \nThe Chargers have a pretty good team on the field, but Mike McCoy is likely coaching his last season in San Diego and the team will probably leave the city in the offseason. Things could get ugly in December. 30. Jacksonville Jaguars \nWhere do we start? Blake Bortles is getting called out by teammates . Gus Bradley is statistically one of the worst coaches ever . And now the team is selling their opponents' merchandise at the stadium . Your thoughts, Jaguars fans? View the GIF 31. Indianapolis Colts \nDo you know how incompetent the brain trust of a team has to be to squander Andrew Lucks' career? There's a reason why Colts fans refer to coach Chuck Pagano, GM Ryan Grigson and owner Jim Irsay as \"The Three Stooges.\" 32. New York Jets \nThe quarterback who held out for months is awful. The coach has lost control of the locker room. The best players on the team don't even bother to show up for team meetings , even when there's cake. The highest-paid player on the team is old and doesn't try. And the team's cap situation is troubling. Other than that, the Jets are in pretty good shape.

Steven Ruiz , USATODAY 1:22 p.m. EST November 15, 2016 \n(Photo: for USA TODAY) \nHere's one opinion every football fan in America can agree on: The NFL RedZone channel is pretty awesome. \nIf your favorite team isn't playing, RedZone is the best way watch football on Sundays. Not only do you get to check in on games around the country, but, more importantly, you also miss out on all those annoying commercials. And there are a lot of them. \nAccording to Exstreamist.com , the RedZone channel helps NFL fans avoid nearly 40 hours of commercials per season: \nWe did some calculations and learned that RedZone subscribers are spared from 2,210 minutes of commercials every NFL season, about 37 hours, or 1.5 days. \nThe average NFL game has 63 minutes of advertisements \nNFL RedZone broadcasts two blocks of games each Sunday \n63 minutes * 2 time blocks of games * 17 weeks of football = 1.5 days of commercials \nThose numbers are based on a study by the Wall Street Journal that estimated a typical NFL broadcast features 65 minutes of commercials and only 11 minutes of game time. \nThose are shocking numbers. But, thanks to RedZone, we can avoid all of those advertisements and take in all that sweet game action. Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2fWaj6b Most Popular",

      "text": "Send Message Summary \nWhile Facebook has been doing a great job at monetizing assets over the past year, there are limits to how much the company can milk users. \nAlso, user growth has probably reached a critical peek in markets like the U.S., where almost all internet users are registered Facebook users. \nGiven how expensive the stock is, I think that Facebook will eventually follow the path of Twitter and Pandora . \"There is no great genius without some touch of madness\" - Aristotle Facebook's (NASDAQ: FB ) recent Q3 results were not received with fanfare and fireworks from the market, sending the stock down significantly after earnings were announced on November 2. This despite the fact that total revenue and net income increased 56% and 165% respectively Y/Y. So what gives? To begin with FB is an extremely expensive stock . In my mind, no matter what the results were, eventually one of these quarters the stock was going to tumble, one way or another. Even after the current correction, FB has a market cap of about $335 billion, a trailing Price/Sales ratio of 13.5 and a P/E of about 44. For those of you who follow me, a Price/Sales ratio of above 6 is borderline bubble in my book, and so is a P/E of 44. Second, \"user engagement\" (the talk of the town) is reaching a critical point of saturation. MAUs (monthly active users) were 1.789 billion on average for the quarter, an increase of 16% year-over-year. However, does a 16% increase warrant FB being such an expensive stock? Not in my book. Sure revenue and profits are increasing faster than user growth, however as we now know from two other stocks that were once the talk of the town, user engagement is not the metric to bet on. Before I continue with FB, let me tell you the story of two stocks. Parallel Lives: Twitter - Pandora \" Courage stands halfway between cowardice and rashness, one of which is a lack, the other an excess of courage \" - Plutarch Let's start with Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ). Twitter was the talk of the town when it first went public. Everyone was fixated on user engagement and how revenue might increase, when and if the company found a way to monetize user engagement. However, while everyone was focused on user engagement, they forgot what they were paying for the stock. And when expectations of higher user engagement and higher EPS never fermented, suddenly everyone remembered how expensive TWTR was, and today TWTR is not very far from its all time lows. And personally, in the absence of someone making a bid for the company, I think it has more downside. My fair value target for TWTR is about $14 a share, with the possibility the stock reaching as low as $10 a share. (please consider: Twitter: Forget About User Engagement, This Is Still An Expensive Stock ). The second is Pandora (NYSE: P ), that I once considered to be the bubble of all bubbles (well almost). Similar to TWTR, everyone was fixated on the stock because of \"user engagement\". However when Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) introduced its steaming music product (that today has about 17 million paid subscribers), suddenly increased user engagement evaporated (and has been in decline for several quarters), and then everyone remembered just how much of a bubble the stock was. Pandora reached as high as $40 a share. My fair value for the stock is about $8 a share, with the possibility the stock reaching as low as $5 (please consider: Why Pandora Fell 35% On Friday And Might Fall Even More ). Especially as far as Pandora is concerned, while user engagement is a bit lower, monetization is increasing at the best pace ever. In fact, Pandora is doing a great job at monetizing assets and increasing EPS. So why is the stock tanking? Because similar to FB, Pandora was such a bubble to begin with, that it made no difference. No matter how much EPS would increase, the stock was so far ahead of itself that it was still expensive. And because user engagement at Pandora is at a standstill, the market has understood that eventually increased monetization will also come at a standstill. You can not increase monetization indefinitely without a corresponding increase in user engagement also. So in other words, both TWTR and Pandora were valued based on assumptions of user engagement (current and future), rather than actual earnings. I think the market is pricing FB the same way. If so, then all we have to do is to find a crack in user engagement data before the market does (or before it becomes evident to all), and short the stock beforehand. Because I think what happened to Pandora and TWTR will also happen to FB. How long can user engagement keep increasing? The population of the U.S. and Canada is about 355 million people. According to FB, it has 178 million DAUs (daily active users) from both of these two countries. Click to enlarge This means that about 50% of the population of the U.S. and Canada use FB everyday. At the same time however, internet penetration in both of these countries is a little over 90%, according to multiple sources . So in other words, everyone except newborns are probably online, with a little over half of all Internet users on FB everyday. Please also note that, while DAUs in the U.S. and Canada are still increasing, the rate is in the single digits. So as a proxy for how many DAUs FB can eventually have globally, I will take the U.S. as an example and assume that about 50% of all internet users worldwide are potential daily FB users. Currently the world population is about 7.3 billion people. The current world internet penetration rate is about 50%. So FB's potential DAUs are about 50% of the current global population, which comes out to about 3.65 billion people. However, only about 50% of the online users in the U.S. and Canada use FB on a daily basis. So if we divide 3.65 billion people by 50%, then the Max amount of DAUs that FB might potentially have comes out to about 1.825 billion people. My first question is, based on the valuation of FB's stock, has this been discounted already? I think yes. In fact I think the market is running way ahead of itself. Because guess what folks, if we look at MAUs, then FB is maxed out already. Click to enlarge According to FB folks, about 1.8 billion people have logged in and used FB (desktop or mobile) ay least one a month last quarter. Please recall that the Max amount of people that currently can potentially use FB are about 1.825 billion people (based on my figures above, and based on U.S. and Canada usage data). So basically, even if all those registered people do not use FB on a daily basis, just about everyone on the planet who can potentially use FB is currently a registered user. How about potential future monetization? To be fair FB's revenue has been increasing far above user engagement data. As of the current quarter DAU's and MAUs increased by 17% and 16% respectively, but revenue increased by 56%. So management is doing a lot of right things. However remember that Pandora's revenue has also been rising, but that has not helped the stock at all. Click to enlarge However I think that over the next several quarters, revenue increase will come down by a lot. How so? If we look at the chart below, most of the increase in revenue per user has come from the U.S. and Canada. Click to enlarge If we look at the above data, while on a Y/Y basis FB had a very big increase in revenue per user from Q3'15, when we look at the Q/Q data since the last year, in most cases things are either at a stand still or revenue increase per user is in the single digits. My question is, will FB be able to repeat the almost 50% increase in revenue per user in the U.S. and Canada next year again? I do not know, however I would not bet on it. Please note that revenue per user went from $10.49 in Q3'15 to $15.65 in Q3'16. I don't know about you, but I do not think this will be repeated anytime soon. Something else interesting is revenue by geography. Click to enlarge About 50% of FB's revenue comes from the U.S. and Canada. And since about everyone in this region is already a registered FB user, I doubt very much that FB can continue to grow revenue by much in this region. Sure revenue per user could continue to increase -- even in the absence of engagement growth -- however there are limits how much money FB or any social media company can milk from each user. And while we do not know that limit, the fact that just about everyone who can possibly be a registered FB user already is, is not very comforting if I were a shareholder, given the valuation of FB. Please remember that FB makes $15.65 per user in the U.S. and Canada. Europe, which is the only other geographical region in which FB can expect to milk so much money from users, is only making $4.72 per user. And this figure has been at a standstill for several quarters. And if you think Asia or the rest of the world at some point in time will make for the company as much as the U.S. is making per user, I can tell you it will not happen in this lifetime. Simply put, the per capita income in these regions is too low for FB to be able to make the money they make in North America. Bottom line FB has been doing a very good job at monetizing assets over the past several quarters. However just about anyone that can become a registered user on the entire planet already is. While user growth will continue over the years, the increase will probably be in the low single digits. Revenue has been increasing higher than user growth, primarily because of assets such as Instagram. However please note this is a one time thing. Also, no matter how many other assets such as Instagram FB might have, you can only be at one place at a time. Users can not be on FB, and Instagram and other Social media sites at the same time. As such, at some point monetization growth will also come to a standstill. As such, FB in my eyes is a very expensive stock. Yes it might continue to grow, however growth over the next several quarters will not be what investors think, and the stock's trajectory will not be what investors have seen over the past years. The best case scenario I have for FB is to hover between $100 and $130 a share for a very long time. The worse being that the stock can correct at some point to $50 - $70 a share. However I would not short the stock yet. Sentiment for FB is still very high in investors eyes. I do not like getting in front of locomotive unless it comes to a full stop. However if you see technical weakness on a weekly scale, I would not say no to shorting the stock, if you are talented at shorting. In either case, if you have the stock, I think you should simply sell it. Yes you have made money all these years holding on to it, however there are limits to the market's generosity. And I think that over the next several quarters, investors will discover the market's generosity limits.

      "title": "How Often Do Top Publishers Post On Facebook?",
      "text": "How often should publishers be posting on Facebook? We look at the posting frequency of ten top publishers’ main Facebook pages, and look at the content formats that they tend to get more space.\nHow many Facebook posts is too many?\nMany publishers wonder whether posting too often could adversely affect their visibility in news feeds. On the other hand, not posting enough can reduce engagement rates, and could cause missed opportunities around popular content. There’s also the consideration that the content needs to be different and appealing to different parts of the audience in order to achieve maximum reach and engagement.\nSo, how often are social publishing leaders posting on their pages, and what does the content output look like?\nUsing NewsWhip Analytics, we looked at the posting frequency on the top ten most engaged sites’ main Facebook pages over 24 hours on November 1.\nRemember that here we were looking exclusively at the main Facebook pages of each of these publishers. So on November 1, the Daily Mail’s main Facebook page posted 99 times to their page, followed by Goal.com, with 72 total posts.\nBeyond the top publishers, there’s a lot of discrepancy in posting frequency amongst these pages. BuzzFeed posted just 28 times to its vast audience on the day in question, with Fox News just slightly ahead, with 32 posts. Most of these publishers have worked to split their distribution out using multiple Facebook pages, each targeting a particular topic or subject, rather than presenting general content.\nIt’s interesting to note that not every piece of content produced by the website is posted to the main Facebook page. Each of these publishers use their main page as a strategic way of amplifying the content that’s most likely to do well on Facebook. For instance, the Huffington Post published 664 English language articles on the date in question, and only 37 of those ended up being linked to from the main Facebook page that day. Of the links that they did post, there was a lively mix of opinion pieces, news, and upbeat features.\nOne more thing to remember is that these numbers refer specifically to larger publishers producing large volumes of original content, rather than smaller pages, for whom a less frequent posting schedule is more suitable.\nNext, we looked at how the posts broke down by content format. We split out the posts from the top ten pages by post format, to see if the pages were posting more of a particular type of content. Here’s what that post breakdown looked like for the ten pages over 24 hours:\nHere we see that link posts (which include Instant Articles) make up the vast bulk of posts for the majority of pages. Links to owned web properties remain the number one most popular post format for publishers, who look to drive traffic to their own websites.\nThe Daily Mail is a notable exception, posting 51 videos, out of a total of 99 posts.\nIt’s also interesting to note the relative lack of image posts from the pages we surveyed. Of the ten pages, only ESPN and Goal.com, two sports publishers, were the only two pages to make use of the format. Our research has shown that image posts get higher average engagement rates than link posts.\nHow often to post?\nSo what’s the optimum posting frequency for publishers?\nIf you have a varied output of content, there seems to be no real limit on how often you should be posting. In reality however, your posting frequency will depend on analytics analysis, the content cycle on a particular day, and what your audience is responding to in real time. Instead of agonising about the frequency of your posts, focus on making sure that every post will have to compete with other elements in your audience’s news feeds.\nTo help make your post stand out, make sure that all the associated detail around the post is optimised with a strong image, good post copy, and critically, an interesting story for the reader.\nDownload NewsWhip’s guide to Facebook publishing for more best practice tips .",
