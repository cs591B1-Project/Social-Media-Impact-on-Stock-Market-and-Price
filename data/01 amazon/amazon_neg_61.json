      "text": "Nov 28, 2016 12:30 PM Photo: Visions of America / Getty Photo: Visions of America / Getty Share Tweet \nDonald Trump sells shitty things. He has sold shitty steaks , shitty “college degrees,” shitty real estate. He has sold many shitty Make America Great Again hats, which somehow shuffled from ironic to iconic despite the fact that it is shaped like a collapsed loaf of bread. It is a very bad hat. \nIt makes an even worse Christmas ornament, though, slightly re-shaped somehow to look like a train conductor’s hat as well as a collapsed loaf of bread. The ornament was originally available to people who made a donation on Trump’s website of $149 or more, but soon it started popping up on Amazon , as well, for prices of $200 and up. It is, as noted on Amazon, “made of brass and finished in 14 karat gold” and “sure to make any tree stand out,” which is a difficult claim, conceptually, given that Christmas trees always stand out since they are Christmas trees. \nRegardless, the shitty, overpriced ornament has since received a flood of user reviews, which appear to be both in direct proportion to the shittiness of the actual object on offer as well as a response to Trump’s xenophobic, racist policy proposals and the petulant, childish tone with which he does literally everything. Many of the user reviews take on the memes of the campaign: \nSome seem to be primal screams, earnestly grappling with reality: \nEven the positive reviews are negative reviews. \nEventually, Trump supporters also showed up in the reviews to make jokes about safe spaces and how this ornament is just the sort of change the Christmas tree needs after decades of entrenched, family-insider ornaments clogging up all the space. Everyday, common ornaments, they argue, are looking to this brass-and-gold hat to “drain the tree” and restore good old-fashioned ornaments to their place of prominence. To wit: \nSmart! Snopes is still undetermined on whether the ornament was actually made in China. \nSubmit your Great Job, Internet tips here",

      "text": "  Amazon’s ‘Grand Tour’ Triples ‘Man in the High Castle’ Viewers (Exclusive)   We already knew that “The Grand Tour” debuted as Amazon’s top-watched original series to-date , but now we have a pretty good snapshot of just how badly it beat “The Man in the High Castle.”\nThe former “Top Gear” guys’ new show more than tripled the opening weekend viewership of the revisionist history drama, which previously held Amazon’s record. Per measurement company Symphony Advanced Media, the highly anticipated “The Grand Tour” premiere earned 1.954 million viewers 18-49, the age range coveted by advertisers. Those numbers are inclusive of three days worth of delayed viewing, like all in this post.\nComparatively, the first episode of “MITHC” premiered to 637,000 viewers, according to Symphony AM. That total is more than double Amazon’s now third-biggest original series, “Catastrophe” (274,000 debut demo viewers). Keep in mind, the “Top Gear” alums had a built-in audience, so this wasn’t a typical new series launch.\n\nAlso Read: 'Amanda Knox' Ratings Are No Killer on Netflix, Firm Says \nOf course, Amazon’s internal viewership numbers would be better to have, but the streaming company’s not coughing those up. Symphony utilizes audio recognition software and a panelist’s cell phone microphone to count up tune-in. The Silicon Valley-based measurement company considers its TV Ratings to be stable after eight days of compiling data, though others in the industry have strongly waved off their accuracy .\nThe series stars Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May doing what they do best — traveling the world and discussing anything and everything car-related. Clarkson, who is known for being impulsive and outspoken, got into hot water at “Top Gear” after he punched a producer; he later apologized for the incident and settled a lawsuit over the matter.\n  “The Grand Tour” is releasing one episode at a time, unlike many streaming shows. Further episodes will be released weekly over the next 11 weeks for Prime members in the U.S., U.K., Germany, Austria and Japan, and the show will premiere worldwide for Amazon customers in over 200 countries and territories in December.\nRead original story Amazon’s ‘Grand Tour’ Triples ‘Man in the High Castle’ Viewers (Exclusive) At TheWrap",

      "text": "on Monday November 28, 2016 @03:00PM from the finding-holes dept. Huge numbers of VAT fraudsters are illegally selling goods tax-free to British shoppers on Amazon and eBay, despite new government efforts to crack down on this ballooning 1bn pound VAT evasion crisis , reports the Guardian. From the article: A Guardian investigation found a wide variety of popular goods being illegally sold without VAT on Britain's leading shopping sites. They range from cheap Christmas tree lights, electric toothbrushes and thermal socks to expensive laptops, iPads, music keyboards, violins and pingpong tables. In some cases, VAT fraudsters offer unbeatable prices. Mostly, however, their prices remain in line with law-abiding competitors and the proceeds of evasion disappear overseas, often to China. Guardian investigations found many tax-evading sellers were trading without displaying VAT numbers on Amazon or eBay. Others were showing made up numbers, or numbers cloned, without authorisation, from unsuspecting legitimate businesses.",

      "text": "– A + Amazon plans major crackdown on counterfeit sellers for 2017 By Roger Fingas \nMonday, November 28, 2016, 12:31 pm PT (03:31 pm ET) \nNot long after related Apple efforts, Amazon is about to embark on eliminating counterfeit vendors from its online store —making it a major focus for 2017, a report said on Monday.\n\n\n\n\nTeams in U.S. and Europe are working with major brands to set up a registry of recognized sellers, even if they aren't already on Amazon, according to a Bloomberg source. Allegedly the company began testing the registry earlier this year, signing up brands like Nike, and 2017 will simply see it expand to encompass thousands of firms, assuming outreach efforts are successful.\n\nMerchants wanting to sell brands linked with the registry will have to show proof they're authorized to do so. While this may make it harder for independent sellers to get started —especially after Amazon imposed high fees on resellers for some brands earlier this year —it could deal a blow to counterfeit manufacturers operating out of countries like China, which will often produce poor-quality knockoffs with names and product descriptions designed to confuse shoppers. Some legitimate businesses have reportedly been reluctant to sell on Amazon because of the problem.\n\nApple in particular has been a common target for counterfeiters, given the popularity of its products and the sometimes high cost of its authorized accessories. In October the company launched a lawsuit against a vendor called Mobile Star, which has been selling fake power cables and adapters, though it has long been pushed off of Amazon.\n\nAt the time Apple made the claim that nearly 90 percent of Apple accessories sold as genuine through the \"Fulfillment by Amazon\" program were fake.",

      "text": "Click here to open 10 ways to use Alexa in the kitchen Amazon's Alexa voice assistant is helpful in many places around the house. Here are nine ways Alexa can help make your time cooking easier and more hands-free. Tyler Lizenby/CNET Up Next Amazon could start dropping off packages inside your home \"Alexa, preheat the oven for turkey\" The $2,000 GE PHB920SJSS induction range works with Alexa, Amazon's virtual assistant, so you can use voice commands to control some of the appliance's functions. by Ashlee Clark Thompson Close Drag \nAmazon 's Alexa voice assistant, found in its Echo , Dot and Tap speakers, may be good for flipping on the lights or locking the doors, but she's especially useful in the kitchen, where taking commands hands-free can be particularly helpful. \nHere are 10 reasons you might want to keep your Alexa-housing speaker in the kitchen. Maintain a grocery list \nOut of the box, Alexa can help you maintain lists for shopping and to-dos . All you have to do is tell Alexa what you want to add and specify which list you want to add it to. \nFor example, you can say \"Alexa, add eggs.\" Since eggs is a noun, Alexa understands that it's an item you would like to add to your shopping list. You can also say \"Alexa, add bread to my shopping list\" or \"Alexa, add an item to my shopping list.\" For the latter, Alexa will ask what you want to add and your response will be added as the next line item on your shopping list. \nTo check this list, open the Alexa app on iOS or Android or go to alexa.amazon.com and click Shopping & To-do Lists . If you would like to sync your additions with something like iOS Reminders, Evernote or another note-taking service, you can use IFTTT to create an Applet that will do one-way sync. Convert units \nWhen cooking, you may find yourself needing to convert units of measurement, such as from milliliters to cups. Alexa is capable of doing this out of the box. Just say, \"Alexa, convert 2 cups to milliliters.\" \nYou can also ask how many teaspoons are in a gallon or how much a volumetric measurement of an ingredient weighs. For instance, \"Alexa, how much does a cup of flour weigh?\" Start a timer \nAlexa also works as a timer. Just say, \"Alexa, start a timer for 5 minutes.\" After 5 minutes passes, the speaker will chime until you tell it to stop. \nYou can start multiple timers running, as well, by saying \"Alexa, start a timer for 10 minutes.\" You can check on how much time is left simply by asking, and you can cancel each timer separately in advance if you wish. \nYou can also set an alarm for a specific or relative time with a command such as, \"Alexa, set an alarm for 6:00 p.m.,\" or, \"Alexa, set an alarm for 60 minutes from now.\" Make coffee \nYou can also use an Alexa command to start up a coffee maker . All you need is a Mr. Coffee 10-Cup Smart Optimal Brew -- or a simple drip coffee maker, plus a smart switch . \nNext, create an IFTTT Applet that will turn on the smart switch (or the Smart Optimal Brew coffee maker) with a trigger phrase, and remember to add coffee grounds and water the night before you want to use it. Then, in the morning, say the trigger phrase and watch the magic happen. 41 Here's everything the Amazon Echo can do Control appliances \nIf you own one of the handful of full-size smart appliances integrated with IFTTT, you can control your oven, dishwasher, refrigerator or slow cooker with Alexa. \nYou will just need to create some Applets with these channels using Alexa as the trigger channel to turn your kitchen into a voice-controlled heaven. Recipe ideas \nIf you ask Alexa for recipe ideas, she isn't exactly helpful. However, if you search for \"recipe\" in the Skills section of the Alexa app or alexa.amazon.com , there is no shortage of options. \nOne of my personal favorite Skills (mini apps for Alexa) is Recipe Finder by Ingredients . To use it, say something like, \"Alexa, ask Recipe Finder what I can make with chicken and broccoli.\" You can list up to five ingredients and Alexa will provide any relevant results with a link in the Alexa app. \nThere are tons of recipe Skills available that can help you find something new and interesting to cook. Ask for calorie counts \nIf you're not sure how many calories a food has, just ask Alexa. She may not always have an answer, but it's a great place to start. For example, try saying, \"Alexa, how many calories are there in Greek yoghurt?\" \nShe can provide info on carbohydrates, as well, but only for certain items. It depends on how widely available the nutritional information for a product is and it helps if the food is something generic, such as steak or broccoli. Pair wines with food \nIf you're unsure which wine best pairs with a certain dish, you can ask Alexa. First, you'll need to enable the Wine Buddy Skill by saying, \"Alexa, enable Wine Buddy.\" \nThen begin asking which wine pairs with a certain food item, like halibut or steak. Say, \"Alexa, ask Wine Buddy what I should pair with salmon.\" \nThis Skill isn't perfect. It can't always pair your wines with specific dishes. For example, it couldn't tell me which wine pairs with chicken marsala, but if you keep the requests fairly basic, you can get some basic answers. Cocktail recipe ideas \nWhen having guests over for drinks, if you're not sure where to begin, just ask Alexa to enable Easy Cocktail . \nTo use Easy Cocktail, just say, \"Alexa, ask Easy Cocktail how I can make an old fashioned.\" First, Alexa will list off the ingredients, then she will tell you the steps of making the drink. \nIf you've got a specific liquor in mind, you can ask The Bartender for cocktail recommendations instead. Listening to music or the news \nDon't forget to crank up the volume while you cook. While you may not be able to binge Netflix while you cook, it's one of the best times to catch up on your favorite podcasts . You can also stream music or play your Flash Briefing to hear the latest news. Share your voice",

      "text": "Order Reprint of this Story HASLET \nIt’s not Santa’s workshop, but arguably few places on Earth are as busy this time of year as Amazon fulfillment centers, such as the massive one in Haslet north of Fort Worth. \nSeveral thousand employees were hard at work filling orders in the massive building here near Alliance Airport on Cyber Monday — expected to be the biggest online shopping day of the year. \nThe algorithms tell the associates what box to use, and even what size the tape should be. Amanda Ip, Amazon spokeswoman \nEverything from books to kitchen gadgets to electronics could be seen making their way along several miles of conveyor belts at the facility, which employs more than 3,000 full-time workers plus hundreds of seasonal employees. The building is 1.1 million square feet, or roughly the size of about 19 football fields. \n“Last year, we sold 54 million items just on Cyber Monday and orders were coming in at 629 items per second,” said Amazon spokeswoman Amanda Ip, referring to the company’s worldwide sales. “This year we anticipate sales will be even higher.” \n120,000 Number of seasonal employees Amazon has hired to help with the holiday shopping rush. \nThe global leader in online shopping is known for its high-tech approach. Shelves of goods are moved by wheeled, self-guided robots to areas where human employees can retrieve and place them in packages. \nAn order can be filled seconds after it’s received. \nEmployees use computer algorithms to determine the most efficient way to pack each shipment. \n“The algorithms tell the associates what box to use, and even what size the tape should be,” Ip said. \nOutside, on one side of the giant building an armada of trucks accept the shipments and make deliveries across the Metroplex. On the other side of the building, trucks from major manufacturers of household goods, toys and almost any item imaginable arrive and off-load shipments to be stored in a warehouse area until someone orders them. \nAmazon opened its fulfillment center in Haslet in 2013. The Seattle-based company now operates eight fulfillment centers in Texas, Ip said, with the newest one recently opening in Houston. \nIn North Texas, the Haslet facility is Amazon’s largest but there also are other operations. A second facility near Alliance Airport opened earlier this year, and an Amazon Fresh perishable food fulfillment center opened near Meacham Airport in Fort Worth. \nAmazon also has fulfillment centers in Coppell and Dallas.",

      "text": "| Follow About | \nCloud Chronicles is written by Network World Senior Writer Brandon Butler, who tracks the ins and outs of the cloud computing industry. Matson ships its data centers to Amazon’s cloud Matson is a $2B international shipping company that is going all in on AWS   12:35 PM PT Email   2016 State of The Cloud \nJust two days ahead of the first keynotes at the AWS re:Invent conference, Amazon Web Services announced today that $2 billion international shipping giant Matson plans to close its data centers and go ‘all-in’ on the company's IaaS cloud platform. \nMatson is a 134-year old Hawaii-based publicly traded shipping company with 22 vessels that run routes primarily in the Pacific Ocean. \n“The shipping industry requires advanced IT capabilities to enable precise tracking of assets and customer shipments as they move around the world,” a press release announcing the news reads . \nEquipment including vessels, shipping terminals, containers and trucks will all rely on Amazon’s cloud to provide visibility and analytics. Matson also has a custom built order-to-cash booking and billing system, logistics platform and customer-facing website all hosted in AWS. \nre:Invent is a time when AWS likes to drum up stories of how customers are closing data centers and moving all their operations to the cloud. Netflix is one of the classic examples of this while the University of Notre Dame is another. Other companies, like GE and Capital One are more slowly moving to the cloud. \nExpect more big name customers to pledge allegiance to AWS as re:Invent kicks off in earnest on Wednesday.

      "text": "  eShop , News , Wii U eShop | 0 Likes \nWii U and 3DS eShop cards tend to come in denominations of $10, $20, $35, and $50. However, Amazon now has new digitals options for all of these, plus a few new ones. \nYou can see all of the eShop cash values on Amazon here . The big ones though are $5, $45, and $70. These are codes rather than cards, meaning you’ll be able to redeem credit right away. Some folks are also speculating that we could see $5, $45, and $70 cards in the future, but that’s obviously not confirmed at the moment. \nThanks to Brandon and Arison for the tip. Share this:",

      "text": "Amazon limits unverified customer reviews of products By Emily Price on November 28, 2016 at 1:09 PM Print Amazon is taking another step to make good on a promise to curb fake reviews on the site, enacting several new measures to ensure that customers leaving reviews aren’t people paid to leave positive remarks about a product. Customers will now be limited to leaving five reviews on the site each week for products that they did not purchase from Amazon directly. Verified purchases that were made directly from Amazon have no cap. The restriction also doesn’t apply to books, music, and videos, many of which are often distributed prior to launch by creators in order to drum up reviews. Reviews are often a huge part of the decision-making process for Amazon shoppers. Each product lists reviews for it prominently on the page and products that are more positively reviewed rank higher in search results than those that have not received many reviews or those with lower review rankings. There’s a huge advantage sales-wise to having as many positive reviews as possible on the site, which has led some companies to manufacture those reviews on their own. In an interview with GeekWire , an Amazon representative said reviews are counted from Sunday at midnight through 11:59pm Saturday, with no one customer able to leave more than five reviews during that time period for purchases he or she made outside of Amazon. Over the past year, Amazon has increasingly started cracking down on fraudulent reviews. The company put new restrictions out on reviews written by people who received products either discounted or free, often deleting some of those reviews because the writers might feel pressure to write something positive based on receiving the “deal” on the product and creating an overall ban on incentivized reviews going forward . The company also changed its algorithm this year to give more weight to reviews written by verified buyers. Emily Price",

      "text": "News \nThe Moto Z was Motorola's flagship this year, and was the company's first attempt at a phone with modular add-ons. Unfortunately, the phone didn't get great reviews ( including from us ). The small internal battery, lack of a headphone jack, and the expensive Moto Mods all hurt the phone's success. However, the Moto Z's performance, software experience, and thinness are hard to beat. Now Amazon is selling the phone (for the next 11 hours at the time of writing) for $499, a whopping $200 off the normal unlocked price. \nI'm not sure I would recommend this phone, even at $499, but it's there if you want it. Keep in mind that this unlocked version only works with GSM networks; only the Moto Z Droid is compatible with Verizon's network. If you do want to buy it, at least you can rest easy knowing it will have Android 7.0 Nougat . Source:",

      "text": "By: Research and Markets via PR Newswire  10 PM EST Research and Markets - Global Big Data Market Will Reach $72 Billion by 2021 - Key Vendors are Amazon, Cisco Systems & Deloitte \nDUBLIN , Nov 28, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- \nResearch and Markets has announced the addition of the \"The Big Data Market: Business Case, Market Analysis & Forecasts 2016 - 2021\" report to their offering. \nThe management of unstructured data (e.g. Big Data), the leveraging of analytics tools to derive value, and the integration between Cloud, Internet of Things (IoT), and enterprise operational technology are key focus areas for large companies across virtually every industry vertical. However, Big Data and Analytics tools are not limited to large companies as products and services are emerging that are democratizing data for smaller companies. A new data economy is developing in which the data associated with corporate products and services becomes almost as value as the company offerings themselves. New models are emerging to reduce friction across the value chain including enhanced Big Data as a Service (BDaaS) offerings. BDaaS is anticipated to make cross-industry, cross-company, and even cross-competitor data exchange a reality that adds value across the ecosystem with minimized security and privacy concerns. Key Findings: The global Big Data Market will reach $72B USD by 2021 with a CAGR of 20.8%. Western Europe will be a market leader with $20.9B USD by 2021 with CAGR of 22.2%. Business Intelligence Tools and Analytics Platforms will reach $15.8B USD globally by 2021. Professional Services remains the leading revenue area through 2021 with CAGR of 23.8%. Open development tools and communities are driving innovation in key areas such as Cloud and IoT. \nCompanies Mentioned:",

Some Of The Lowest Prices I’ve Seen This Year \nI own quite a few of these items and really like them. After spending some more time going through Amazon deals today, I found a handful of items that are either in my backpack or on my list of things to buy. Here goes: \nPlantronics Voyager Legend Bluetooth Headset: Normally $100 or more, on sale today for $51.99 \nI need to do a formal review of this headset, but I love it. After years of using a Bose bluetooth headset, but this is cheaper and definitely better. At $50, you can’t go wrong for ease of use, sound quality and battery life. \nAnker PowerLine 10ft Lightning Cable: Normally $15, on sale for $11.89 \nI really enjoy the Anker cables, though I prefer the braided versions which can be a few dollars more unless you find a rocking sale. Only the white cables are on sale today but I’ve never really cared what color my cables are. \nAnker Quick Charge Dual USB Car Charger: Normally $59.99, discounted to $16.99 \nIn practice, I rarely see this priced at $59.99. I think it’s usually about $30, which still makes $16.99 a screaming deal for a USB car charger that will charge 2 iPads at the same time. And, Anker warranties these for 18 months, and actually stands behind that warranty unlike other companies. \nAnker PowerLine+ 10ft MicroUSB Cable: Normally $29.99, on sale for $10.19 \nFor Android folks, the 10 foot version of the Anker braided cable I carry for my iPhone and iPad. These cables are incredibly durable. They pop up on sale from time-to-time, but I don’t recall seeing the 10 foot version this cheaply. Only the red version is this cheap today. \nLonely Planet Cuba Travel Guide: Normally $24.99, on sale for $12.98 \nMore To Come? \nThere may be more items on sale that I’m interested in, so check back later. For now, these are the best ones I’ve seen for things I can recommend. \nThe post More Of My Favorite Things On Sale For Cyber Monday At Amazon was published first on Pizza in Motion",

Cyber Monday is here.\nAt the 1.1 million square foot Amazon Fulfillment Center in Tracy, more than 6,500 workers know not to miss a beat -- especially not today.\n\"We're offering new deals as often as every 5 minutes,\" Amazon spokesperson, Lori Richter said.\nCyber Monday is Amazon's Superbowl.\nLast year, customers ordered 54 million items in one day, or 629 items every second.\nIt is incredibly challenging, but not impossible, thanks to hundreds of Amazon Robots.\n\"You think they're going to crash into each other. But last minute, they stop and take off in another direction,\" Amazon spokesperson, Craig Bergman said. \"Robots are doing all the walking around work. Human beings are still incredibly good at being told pick item X, seeing item X on a shelf, and getting it on a crate.\"\nThis massive operation is something a service small businesses cannot afford to do alone, so they partner with Amazon.\n\"That just enables us to increase our selection and offer a wide variety of products that customers love,\" Richter said.\nAnson Liang launched his San Mateo-based electronics company, Rowkin, last year on Amazon. His new product is the Rowkin Wireless Bluetooth with portable charger.\nHe is one of 2 million business owners who use the \"Fulfillment by Amazon\" program.\n\"For us, as a seller, we are able to reach more customers much quicker and easier than before,\" Liang said.\nRowkin is offering 20 percent off all of their products on Amazon on Cyber Monday. Amazon is also slashing prices on a variety of products all day.\n37.739651 -121.425223 ",

      "text": "Cyber Monday savings are crucial even if you're restocking on boring office necessities. Well, why not make them less boring? You spend the majority of your week at work, make it more palatable with items that show off your personality.  \n\nFor the person with or without a green thumb, succulents that ring in at $2 a pop without a trip to Home Depot are not to be passed up. Theses less needy and uber trendy plants are having a moment right now, and you should take advantage of their non-fussy lifestyle and cool aesthetic. If you're up for something more adventurous that still doesn't take a lot of effort, try out a bonsai tree .  \n\nIf you're decorating your home office and want that corner office look, Herman Miller chairs are kind of a requisite. This Executive Aeron Task Chair is definitely a power move, and if you want something slightly cheaper the Setu Chair should do the trick.  \n\nSuppose you work in a creative office and your coffee mug and notebook are symbols of your individuality in meetings. This lego coffee mug will certainly catch everyone's attention, and can be cathartic when you're in-between projects.  \n\nIf you're one of those people who keeps several pairs of shoes under your desk including gym sneakers and/or heels, then these odor and moisture absorbing capsules might be the courteous move that also extends the life of your footwear. They would be a handy addition to any closet or suitcase as well. If you're heading to the gym after work, then grab a bag that has different zippered compartments for your shoes and assorted gear. This duffel  should make your life easier.  \n\nSuppose you have an office and love dad jokes. Look no further than the \"hi, I'm mat\" mat . People will feel a strange mixture of fear, love and loathing upon encountering it.  \n\nRegularly dealing with clients or just human beings? Having gum on hand is a lifesaver, especially when it's vegan, GMO free and comes in bulk for cheap. Simply Gum is awesome  if you haven't already tried it out.  \n\nNot loving your annual Citibike membership you use to commute to the office (um hello waste of money in the winter) or are thinking of buying a used bike? Amazon's bikes ring in at $163 with free shipping , so you might as well get a new bike for the price of a used one.  \n\nIf you're a coffee fiend, why keep getting up for a cup of brew when you can keep an attractive carafe at your desk? This one can hold both hot and cold liquids, or be used as a wine decanter if you so desire.  \n\nAnd last but not least, a cool looking and inexpensive wireless mouse . Both anti-radiation and sweat-resistant, you'll love its smooth bamboo look and feel.",

      "text": "amazon / istock Like us on Facebook \nIf you're a chef with limited counter and cabinet space, it can be tricky to figure out what items are worthy of that precious culinary real estate. Should you buy a pressure cooker, a slow cooker, or a rice cooker? Luckily, you don't have to choose. The wildly popular Instant Pot IP-DUO60 7-in-1 Multi-Functional Pressure Cooker manages to cram a rice cooker, a pressure cooker, a slow cooker, a yogurt maker, a warmer, a steamer, and a saute/browing pan into one tight package . The device has piled up a stellar 4.7-star Amazon rating with over 12,000 reviews , and it's also been one of the most popular items for Mental Floss shoppers. For anyone with a tight kitchen space, this versatile cooker is a convenient, compact workhorse. \nToday, it's also a great deal! Amazon has cut the price for the six-quart, 1000W Instant Pot IP-DUO60 all the way to $68.95, a savings of over $50 off its list price. It's one of the lowest prices we've seen for one of Amazon's most celebrated kitchen tools . At this price, buying an Instant Pot is a no-brainer, so use that surplus mental energy on deciding what to cook this weekend. \nBuy at Amazon: Instant Pot IP-DUO60 7-in-1 Multi-Functional Pressure Cooker, 6Qt/ 1000W for $68.95 (list price $234.95) \nMental Floss has affiliate relationships with certain retailers, including Amazon, and may receive a small percentage of any sale.

      "title": "Amazon: Everyday Deals Make Black Friday Less Important, Says SunTrust - Tech Trader",
      "text": "By Tiernan Ray As mentioned earlier , Amazon ( AMZN ) is getting some positive feedback today with regards to the holiday shopping season, including Black Friday , but one Wall Street observer thinks you shouldn’t put too much into the holiday numbers.\nRobert Peck of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey , who has a Hold rating on Amazon shares, notes both that discount shopping today, the so-called Cyber Monday shopping frenzy, are above plan, and that it doesn’t matter as much as in prior years.\nFirst, the numbers:\nAdobe predicted Cyber Monday online sales of ~$3.4B, or ~9% YoY growth. However, in the past 3 years, Cyber Monday online sales have grown at ~16%. If online sales grow at the same pace as the past 3 years, Cyber Monday sales could be ~$3.6B, or ~$190M ahead of Adobe’s estimate.\nDespite that upside in Cyber Monday, Amazon and other retailers have been offering so many online deals on a regular basis, in advance of Black Friday, that the shopping event may no longer mean as much:\nIn a recent article, the New York Times highlighted how extended online promotions around Black Friday and the emergence of Millennials (~40% of whom do all or most of their shopping online) is “reshaping one of the country’s biggest shopping days.” Consequently, it is not surprising that Black Friday is becoming “less and less important for the industry over all.” Per a Bankrate (RATE, $11.00, Hold, Andrew Jeffrey) survey, just 23% of adults plan to shop in stores on Black Friday, down from 28% two years ago. Black Friday accounted for 6% of sales during the holiday season a decade ago; this year, it is expected to be only 4.3% per Customer Growth Partners.\nAs far as Amazon, though published estimates for the holiday weekend do tend to support his outlook for Amazon:\nAs we discussed (link), comScore expects 16-19% YoY growth on online sales during the holiday season, which is in line with estimates from other industry commentators, and represents an acceleration from ~11% in 2015 [...] Looking at 4Q estimates, we believe the comScore estimate supports Street expectations for Amazon of 23-24% growth in North America, or 5-7% upside. Note, Prime momentum remains a positive while increasing 3P sales for Amazon (now 50% of units) is a headwind for top line growth.\nAmazon shares today are down $11.57, or 1.5%, at $768.80.",

      "text": "Don't Miss: $149.99 40-inch Sony KDL40R350D 1080p TV Cyber Deal on Amazon \nThe unveiling of an unofficial safe sex emoji is the latest move in Durex's ongoing #CondomEmoji campaign which calls for putting a safe sex emoji on every smartphone in order to help young people communicate about safe sex, the company said in a statement. \n\"We believe the naming of \"Umbrella with Raindrops\" as the unofficial safe sex emoji will be a significant step towards helping young people put safe sex back on the agenda,\" said Volker Sydow, Global Director, Durex. \nThe #CondomEmoji campaign has trended both on Twitter and Facebook with supporters from over 160 countries backing the movement during a survey. \n\"While more than 60 per cent of young people surveyed admitted to being uncomfortable discussing safe sex, 72 percent of respondents admitted that they found it easier to express emotions using emojis and more than three quarters admitted that they use emojis to discuss sex and relationships,\" the survey findings noted. The #CondomEmoji still isn’t part of the ‘safe sex vocabulary’.

      "text": "\"Amazon received the money I was scammed for either way.\" Amazon said never give gift card information directly to someone in exchange for a product or service. @jennycu/Flickr Photo: \n‘Tis the season for holiday shopping and with that comes an increase risk for scammers. \nFraudsters are using Amazon gift cards to steal money from shoppers, according to NJ.com , and the scammed are not finding relief from the retail giant. \nNick Gladis of New Jersey bought a drone as a birthday gift to himself. \n\"It was the biggest purchase I'd made for myself in years,\" he told NJ.com. \nThe ad said to text the seller before placing the order. The seller’s emails looked authentic, Gladis told NJ.com, and instructed him to buy an Amazon gift card to complete the purchase. \nAfter Gladis provided the seller with the gift card information, his drone never arrived. Gladis said he contacted Amazon, but it said the gift card had already been used and there was nothing that could be done. \n\"Amazon simply does not care and has very little to say about it, and wants it brushed under the carpet so that they don't have a sketchy name,\" Gladis told NJ.com. \"Amazon received the money I was scammed for either way.\" \nGladis said the seller posted more items after the scam was reported. \n\"That's absolutely unforgivable,\" he said. \nAn Amazon spokesman told Metro that Amazon gift cards should only be used on Amazon.com and should never be sent directly to a seller. \nThe spokesman also said if anyone thinks they might be the victim of a scam: “they should absolutely contact Amazon Customer Service, where we can research what options are available. We also recommend that they file a report with the police and/or the regional fraud reporting center.” \nMetro also asked Amazon what happens after a buyer makes a complaint against a specific third-party seller, and is still awaiting a response.",

      "text": "Cyber Monday 2016 at Amazon Fulfillment Center in Dupont WA. (GeekWire / Kevin Lisota) Cyber Monday is still under way, but Amazon gave an early indication of its sales results in an update this afternoon — saying the company is “on pace to have our best Cyber Monday in history,” driven in part by increasing mobile orders.\nAmazon’s Echo Dot is the best-selling item on Amazon.com so far this holiday season. Amazon Image. Without disclosing any specific numbers, the company said the best-selling item so far on Amazon.com on Thanksgiving, Black Friday and Cyber Monday is its own Echo Dot smart speaker, which is available for $39.99 as part of the company’s Cyber Monday deal.\nThe early results reinforce Cyber Monday as the most important day of the year for the online retailer. Amazon said orders via its mobile app are on pace to surpass those from Cyber Monday last year. In addition, the company said, “ In the first half of Cyber Monday , Amazon.com customers ordered more than 2 million toys and the Pie Face Showdown Game by Hasbro is our best-selling toy so far.”\nBeyond smartphones and tablets, Amazon is trying to get shoppers to use its Alexa voice assistant to order items, offering Alexa-exclusive deals for people ordering via Echo devices and other Alexa-enabled products. Amazon said Prime members “made more than 30 shopping interactions with Alexa per second” on Black Friday, an all-time high.\nCyber Monday is traditionally the largest online shopping day across the industry, but strong online sales on Black Friday this year have raised the possibility, at least, that it won’t be that way this year. Adobe, which tracks online sales through its retail marketing platform, said earlier today that it expects Cyber Monday online sales in the U.S. to reach $3.36 billion, which would just barely edge out Black Friday, which saw online sales of $3.34 billion this year.\nPREVIOUSLY : Cyber Monday: How mobile shopping and free shipping are shaking up our holiday traditions ",

Of course, in typical Amazon AMZN fashion, the Seattle company did not release any sales figures to back up its claim.\nCyber Monday is expected to hit record online sales of $3.3 billion in the U.S., a figure that’s up nearly 10% from last year.\nAmazon didn’t release much data on what is selling well, but the company did report its best-selling item on Thanksgiving, Black Friday, and Cyber Monday so far is the Echo Dot, the company’s internet-connected home automation device.\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune's technology newsletter. \nOne possible reason for the increased sales could be mobile shopping. Orders through the company’s Amazon’s iPhone and Android app are on pace to surpass app orders compared to Cyber Monday last year. The company also said that Thanksgiving Day became one of its busiest mobile shopping days in history.\nDespite these optimistic reports, Amazon’s stock still dropped just under 2% in trading on Monday. According to Marketwatch, Amazon’s stock has dropped six out of the past 11 Cyber Mondays.\nHoliday season consumers have been spending record amounts online this year, especially on mobile phones. But it's not just e-commerce only companies that are seeing strong levels of spending. Target TGT also reported record online sales for Thanksgiving, as did Kohls.",

      "text": "If you’re one of those people who tends to write a lot of product reviews at Amazon you may find that you’ve got a bit more free time now. The online retail giant may not know anything about “fake news” on social media sites, but they are fed up with fake product reviews in their store. With that in mind, you will be limited in the number of reviews you can submit … unless you buy lots of products, of course . (BBC)\nOnline marketplace Amazon has placed a limit on the number of reviews shoppers can leave on the site.\nIn a bid to put a stop to false feedback, people can now write only five reviews a week of items not bought via the online store.\nThe change applies to most products and is part of efforts to clamp down on people selling positive comments.\nThe change is Amazon’s latest step in its battle to ensure users trust its listings. \nI suppose the problem of paying for reviews is real enough, though it was completely predictable. I still recall the earlier forms of popular review sites and the immediate trouble they generated. The idea itself was great, of course. It would be nice to be able to visit a site where you could find out information about movies, restaurants or products and get the unvarnished opinions of people who had actually tried them rather than relying on advertising. But that immediately opened the floodgates to both positive spin and malicious attacks in a competitive capitalist environment.\nYelp ran into problems right away with business owners, their friends and family members flooding the listings for competitors with bad reviews, often from people who had never even patronized the places they were reviewing. Similarly, with a bit of organized effort you could bump up your own rating with a bunch of five star reviews. That problem became even worse when it at least appeared that Yelp would helpfully allow you to buy your way out of bad reviews for a while. \nThe same problem showed up at sites like Rotten Tomatoes and IMDB, where people would organize to give high marks to films which most actual movie goers found to be real dogs. It’s a great, free way for producers to get some buzz going about their film, but doesn’t do much to help the actual consumers looking for reliable feedback. The fact that it’s been happening at Amazon shouldn’t come as a surprise with those sorts of stories as background.\nThe phenomenon of companies actually paying people to write fake reviews is a bit more recent, but I don’t think the legal codes have caught up with this aspect of modern living so I doubt we’ll see anyone going to jail over it. In the meantime, Amazon is just limiting the damage, not eliminating it. And I wish I had some suggestion to offer as a solution, but there doesn’t seem to be one. When a system is this easy to cheat with little or no consequences, people are going to do it.\n",

      "text": "Browse the book deals, it's worth it.\nPhoto by Amazon I'm a relentless browser of discounted e-books. I peek at Kindle Daily Deals each day, and I get BookBub emailed to me (a nice way to check for sale books, FYI).\nAmazon's biggest Kindle e-book sale of the year tends to be right now, and the sale books offered today are numerous. I bought a handful during last year's sale. This year, here's what draws my eye. Definitely browse the book deals yourself if you have a moment or two... your e-book treasures will differ from mine.\n58 Cyber Monday 2016: The best deals we've found so far \" Seveneves ,\" by Neal Stephenson ($2.99)\nI love Neal Stephenson. His latest novel is an epic spanning thousands of years: The human race tries to survive its own imminent destruction with teamwork, brainpower and luck. I don't want to spoil anything. It's worth it even at full price.\n\" Game of Thrones (A Song of Ice and Fire, Book One) ,\" by George R.R. Martin ($1.99)\nI've never read \"Game of Thrones,\" but I watch the show. I've been tempted, if only because Martin's also a Jets fan. Two dollars would get me in the door.\n\" 1984 ,\" by George Orwell ($1.99)\nThe ultimate parable of surveillance, totalitarianism and Big Brother is worth a reread right now . Get it before it disappears.\n\" The Forever War ,\" by Joe Haldeman ($1.99)\nConsidered one of the greatest war sci-fi novels ever. I apparently bought it last October when it was also on sale, but still haven't read it. Could be a good 2017 read.\n\" How to Clone a Mammoth: The Science of De-Extinction ,\" by Beth Shapiro ($2.99)\nAward-winning nonfiction book discussing the possibilities of resurrecting extinct species. Jurassic Park fans or those looking for great science reads, take the plunge! (I haven't but probably will.)\n\" The Handmaid's Tale ,\" by Margaret Atwood ($1.99)\nI just bought this because, oddly enough, I've never read it. Atwood's a spectacular author, and her MaddAddam trilogy is one of my all-time favorites. An eerily prescient premise gives her most famous classic new relevance.\n\" Cryptonomicon ,\" by Neal Stephenson ($1.99)\nAnother Stephenson epic, this one spanning World War II, cryptography and a lot more. You get your money's worth for two bucks.\n\" Cuckoo's Calling ,\" by Robert Galbraith (J.K. Rowling) ($3.99)\nReady to move beyond Harry Potter? The well-reviewed detective thriller by Rowling, under the pen name Robert Galbraith, is on sale. (I haven't read it.)\n\" The Fireman ,\" by Joe Hill ($3.99)\nAn apocalyptic supernatural tale about spontaneous combustion by a mysterious condition called Dragonscale. Joe Hill's a growing name in horror, and he happens to also be Stephen King's son. I want to read this one very badly.\n\" Tesla: Inventor of the Electrical Age ,\" by W. Bernard Carlson ($3.99)\nA beefy biography of mysterious scientific genius Nikola Tesla that also happens to be a critically celebrated book. A perfect buy-now, read-later for deep in the winter.\n\" Speak ,\" by Louisa Hall ($1.99)\nDescribed as a mix of Margaret Atwood and David Mitchell on Amazon's page (and it was an Amazon top book last July), the description sounds fantastic: episodes spanning time, describing the birth of a line of AI-enabled dolls. Count me in.\n ",

      "text": "Boding well for the broader “smart-speaker” market, Amazon sold 5.1 million Echo devices to U.S. consumers since late 2014, per Consumer Intelligence Research Partners. Better yet, awareness of Amazon Echo among U.S. Amazon customers increased dramatically in the past 12 months, the research firm finds.\nCIRP estimates that for U.S. Amazon customers, awareness of Amazon Echo increased to 69% as of September 30 of this year -- up from 20% as of March 31 of 2015.\n“Amazon continues to expand Echo, introducing two new models this year, the Dot and Tap,” Josh Lowitz, cofounder and partner at CIRP, notes in a new report.\n“Amazon also promotes it heavily, with special pricing on multiple Echo device purchases and Echo devices bundled with compatible speakers and home automation devices. Amazon also offers deals available only to Amazon Prime members exclusively through Echo,” it added.\nCustomers use Amazon Echo for various purposes, with one-third using it as an information provider responding to questions, and over 40% as an audio speaker listening to streaming music.\n“Our research shows that more than half of Echo owners use the device as more than a voice-controlled music speaker,” added Lowitz. “Users report asking about weather and news, and increasingly controlling other connected devices.”\nCIRP bases its findings on surveys of 3,500 U.S. subjects who made a purchase at Amazon.com in the period from January of 2015 through September 2016.",

      "text": "It started out in 2005 as a day of online shopping – from your desk at work – on the Monday following the Thanksgiving weekend. From then, it has grown from a day of hoping the boss doesn’t catch you as you sneak a bargain, to a full week or more of deals on TVs, computers, toys and tech.\nHere are a few of the most popular deals from online and brick-and-mortar stores.\nOverall discounts\n• Kohls is offering a 20 percent discount on in-store and online purchases from Nov. 26-30.

      "text": "November 28, 2016, 4:22 PM Amazon forms teams to target a proliferation of fakes By Bloomberg News Amazon employees in the U.S. and Europe will work with brands to block fakes on its marketplace, a source says. \n(Bloomberg)—Randy Hetrick first noticed counterfeits on Amazon.com Inc. in 2013. He had been selling his TRX Training System—an exercise kit of suspension straps—on the site since 2008. When he began noticing cheap imitations, he had his employees scour Amazon for more, then go through the tedious process of reporting them for removal. But new imposters would pop up right away, and by 2014, \"We realized this was an epidemic,\" said Hetrick, who estimates phonies cost him $100 million a year, twice his annual sales. \nAmazon's Marketplace gives inventors like Hetrick exposure to hundreds of millions of shoppers without the big expense of building and promoting a website from scratch. Merchants give Amazon a commission on each sale. But a hot-selling product on Amazon encourages counterfeiters to make flimsy knockoffs with cheap materials, steal sales and damage a brand with few consequences. \nAmazon, No. 1 in the Internet Retailer 2016 Top 500 Guide , has known the problem is getting worse, according to a source familiar with the matter, but for years, the company has been largely silent about the flourishing fakes. That has frustrated manufacturers and brand owners who bear the cost and responsibility of policing the site, reporting problems and hoping Amazon takes action . Related Articles Amazon sues marketplace sellers for alleged fake goods \nNow, the world's biggest online retailer is getting serious. It has made fighting phonies a major goal for 2017, building teams in the U.S. and Europe to work with major brands on a registry to prevent fakes, according to a person familiar with the initiative, who was not authorized to speak about the matter and requested anonymity. Discussions with Major League Baseball and the National Football League about selling merchandise on Amazon hit a standstill earlier this year due to concerns about Amazon's lack of control over fakes, the person said. \n“Amazon has zero tolerance for the sale of counterfeit items on our site,\" Amazon said in a statement. The company said it was \"aggressively pursuing bad actors.\" In a statement, the MLB said: “It is our responsibility to provide our fans with reliable and secure marketplaces to purchase officially licensed merchandise. Given the rampant growth of online-only retailers supplying counterfeit merchandise, our policies must hold every distribution partner to that same level of commitment.” The NFL declined to comment. \nThe new Amazon teams will encourage brands—even those that don't sell on Amazon—to register with the online store, the person said. Once registered, Amazon requires any marketplace merchants listing those products to prove that they have the brand's permission to sell them online . Amazon began experimenting with the registry earlier this year with Nike and other companies. The bigger push in 2017 will target thousands of large companies, including those that have been reluctant to sell on Amazon because of knock-offs. \nIn addition, this month Amazon teamed up with Hetrick's business to sue three people, accusing them of selling fakes on its site. It filed another similar suit the same day against an alleged counterfeit ring. Moving the battle to a courtroom is an acknowledgment that despite spending tens of millions of dollars a year and employing an army of software engineers, investigators and research scientists tasked with fighting copycats, Amazon is not winning the war against counterfeiters. \n\"The depressing thing about it is, brands that invest the most to innovate and create new products are the ones that lose the most because they are the ones the counterfeiters target,\" said Hetrick, who is encouraged by Amazon's new vigilance. \"You end up becoming the sales and marketing arm for these shysters selling illegal goods.\" \nAmazon is desperately trying to bring order to the Wild West atmosphere on its marketplace, where more than 2 million independent sellers compete for the attention and money of shoppers. About half of the goods purchased on Amazon come from independent merchants, who help Amazon expand its inventory more quickly and with less upfront cost than Amazon could do on its own. It also makes the retailer and its customers more vulnerable to fakes because the simple online registration process currently in place is designed to make it easy for businesses to begin selling immediately. But that also makes it simple for counterfeiters to list fake goods, sell as many as they can before they're detected, and then vanish. \nAmazon’s suits targeting sellers were the first of their kind for the company, a warning to counterfeiters heading into the busy holiday shopping season when the most is at stake. It could be too little, too late. \nThe shift of spending from stores with tight inventory controls to online marketplaces where it's tough to distinguish between fake and authentic is fueling a rise in counterfeiting that shows no signs of slowing. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and eBay Inc. are also grappling with copycat products. Counterfeits made up nearly $500 billion, or 2.5%, of global imports in 2013, a figure expected to grow as more spending shifts online, according to an April report by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. China is the biggest source of phonies. \nDespite efforts to decrease them, complaints about imitations on Amazon have been growing along with its inventory since at least 2014, according to a person familiar with the matter. What Amazon has known internally for years is spilling into the public eye. Birkenstock announced it would cease selling products on Amazon in January due to concerns about counterfeits. And in October, Apple Inc. sued an Amazon supplier claiming the business sold fake Apple products—some of them unsafe—on Amazon . \n\"Online counterfeiting is never going to go down,\" said Stuart Fuller, director of commercial operations at NetNames, which helps brands identify marketplaces and websites where counterfeit products are sold. \"Amazon is the most trusted marketplace in the world. That in and of itself attracts this nefarious element because they know shoppers go there and trust what they are buying is genuine.\" Topics",

See inside an Amazon warehouse in 360 degrees 0 Up Next Buying stuff on your phone still sucks. Here's why \nEver wondered how Amazon gets your order to you? \nIt all starts at a fulfillment center. Inside this Amazon warehouse in Tracy, California, some of the order fulfillment process is automated with machines or robots. Small orange Kiva bots carry shelves of items, while labeling machines scan outgoing boxes to make sure the right address is placed on each one. \nBut the process still needs humans -- over 3,000 of them -- to work alongside the machines. \nThe Kiva bots were first deployed in 2014 to carry shelves of items across the warehouse floor. They deliver them to picking stations where workers choose specific items on the shelves for each order. How Amazon gets your order to you This holiday season, Amazon is trying to fill your orders faster than ever before thanks to robotic technology. Soon, the company hopes drones will cut its current one-hour delivery time in half. by Lexy Savvides Close Drag \nThere are multiple ways to watch our 360-degree video of the tour, found at the top of the page. On a mobile device, use the YouTube app to view the video on a phone and move the screen around to see different angles. Or you can use a VR device like Google Cardboard and watch the video in VR mode . \nYou can also click and drag around the video with a mouse if you're on desktop. Share your voice",

If that's possible, I am seeing TtR and Carcassonne on there.EDIT: I just noticed you're in the UK. The Google Play availability should be the same there too!EDIT2: Carc. and TtR are on the Amazon App Store.

And you can happily use with adult beverages for a paltry $10.99 with free shipping. While we're on the subject of pools, why not adorn yours with a badminton/volleyball net ? At $50 it's not a bad investment for future afternoons that turn into nights.  \n\nSoothe their fears of the dark and yours of having to get up more than necessary with an ambient unicorn light . In a multitude of colors, it's certainly a magical creature at $16.95 with free shipping.  \n\nWhat's more important than an alarm clock? A LEGO Star Wars alarm clock . You'll probably want to steal their Darth Vader, Boba Fett or Yoda when they grow out of it, and then they'll promptly take it back.  \n\nSurprise them with a mug that's got more than hot cocoa beneath the surface. This hidden octopus mug is both amusing and aesthetically pleasing thanks to this porcelain mollusk's silhouette.",

      "text": "By John Bonazzo • 11/28/16 11:58am \nOver the past couple of years, Amazon has had a hard time turning its annual summer Prime Day into anything more than a glorified clearance rack . Today, however, the site had a chance to redeem itself during the Cyber Monday shopping blitz that occurs between Black Friday and Giving Tuesday . \nAnd thankfully, it didn’t waste the opportunity. Amazon is offering discounts of 30 to 50 percent on its own e-readers and tablets, and is also including these items as freebies when customers purchase other products—for example, today anyone who buys Rosetta Stone language software for $149 will get a free Kindle Fire HD 6. \nThis time, however, the deals don’t drop off once you go outside the Amazon family of electronics—there are thousands of other great items on sale (in fact, the retail giant claims it’s offering 75,000 discounts this week). \nThe video game nerd in your family will love the Xbox One S—and if you order the console today, you can bundle it with a full game digital download of the new first person shooter games Battlefield 1 or Gears of War 4 and save almost $100. \nAmazon hasn’t abandoned print books in its quest for Kindle dominance —indeed, one of the day’s best deals is reserved for them. Anyone who orders at least $25 worth of books and then enters the code HOLIDAYBOOK at checkout automatically gets $10 off . \nPrefer movies to video games? Amazon is offering select DVDs three for $13.99, Blu-Rays three for $19.99 and TV seasons three for $29.99 . And unlike in previous years, the items on sale are Oscar and Emmy-winning titles that you’ll actually want to buy. \nFor the reader/science nut on your gift list, there’s no better gift than a one-year subscription to National Geographic for only $19. That works out to $1.58 an issue, which is a 74 percent discount on the normal price— Time , Entertainment Weekly and Fortune , among others, are also discounted . This may be the manliest thing you’ll ever own. Amazon \nNeed some new accessories for your tool belt? He’ll be extra prepared with the DeWalt compact drill set , on sale for 50 percent off and perfect for the gearhead on your gift list. \nWant to make Christmas baking easier? Get her a KitchenAid six-quart Bowl-Lift Stand Mixer for 60 percent off. \nAnd after all that mixing, you deserve a vacation—luckily stylish Tumi Vapor Light Luggage is 50 percent off today as well. \nIf this is all too square for you, however, never fear—there are still some weird Prime Day-style deals, including over 30 percent off the Kickstarter-backed adult board game Exploding Kittens . \nAs the above video notes, Amazon is racing against its own high expectations this year—last year Amazon customers bought 54 million items on Cyber Monday (that’s 629 items per second ). This is also eating into in-store sales—early figures show that 109 million people shopped online on Black Friday, while only 99 million braved the in-store crowds. \n“If you don’t enjoy the festival of going out on Black Friday, you don’t have to,” Yahoo Finance writer Myles Udland says in the video. “You don’t have to talk to anybody.” \nMost of Amazon’s Cyber Monday deals expire at 12 AM PST (9 PM EST) tonight.

      "text": "Amazon's Dash Buttons might seem a bit odd at first, but you'll be shocked at just how quickly they can become a staple in your daily life. Think about how often you think of something you need to replenish in your home, only to completely forget about it 2 minutes later and then get angry when it comes time to use it and you can't. Instead of keeping up this song and dance, you can simply tap a strategically placed Dash Button and Amazon will zip whatever you need right to your door in two days or less.\nRight now for Cyber Monday 2016, Amazon is offering a special Dash deal: pick any single Dash button and get it for $0.99 instead of $4.99. You still get a $4.99 Amazon credit the first time you use it, so Amazon is basically paying you $4 to snag one of these incredibly useful little gadgets.\nContinue reading... \nTrending right now: \n11 paid iPhone apps on sale for free today The 10 best Cyber Monday sales of 2016 Walmart just revealed its 16 best-selling deals of Cyber Monday 2016 so far ",

      "text": "  06:38PM ROBBINSVILLE, N.J. (WPVI) -- Forget the crowds at the mall, today is Cyber Monday which means from the comfort of your couch (or your desk) you can shop till you drop and never have to move more than your mouse. Whether you plan to do your holiday shopping in stores, online or both, use this guide to help you make your battle plan. It's the biggest day of the year for online retailer Amazon.com.Business is booming at the Amazon fulfillment center in Robbinsville, Mercer County, where over 4,000 employees in a warehouse the size of 28 football fields are picking, packing and shipping hundreds of thousands of items.\"It's been crazy here, but everybody's pretty much laid back and keeping the pace up,\" Amazon picker Amanda Miller said.There's a roar inside the warehouse. It's the sound of 12 miles of conveyor belts moving packages from storage to shipping to your front door.\"On Cyber Monday last year customers ordered 54 million items. That is 629 items per second and this year we know we will beat those numbers,\" Amazon spokeswoman Julie Law said.\"I love the aspect of I don't have to use my gas or my car. I can just go right online and order something,\" Jordan Glover of Trenton said.Nationwide Amazon is hiring 120,000 seasonal employees and at the rate people are buying online this Cyber Monday, they'll need the help.

      "text": "Big department stores with healthy online operations and Amazon ( AMZN ) led the way on Black Friday in part by getting a head start by kicking the shopping festivities off on Thanksgiving.\nContinue Reading Below\nDigital Black Friday sales started at most major retailers when the calendar turned from Wednesday to Thursday. That was enough to keep some shoppers at home -- still buying stuff, but not venturing out to stores on either Thursday or Friday.\nOnline sales were the big winner of the two-day period coming in at $5.27 billion, according to Adobe ( ADBE ) Digital Insights . That's a 17.7% year-over-year increase, with Black Friday itself setting a new record by surpassing $3 billion for the first time at $3.34 billion, a 21.6% increase over 2015. Thanksgiving itself came in at $1.93 billion.\n\"The negative impact on online shopping we saw following the election has not been fully made up, but consumers are back online and shopping,\" saidAdobe Digital Insights Director Tamara Gaffney in a statement. \"As spending ramps up on Black Friday, we are back on track. We still expect Cyber Monday to surpass Black Friday and become the largest online sales day in history with $3.36 billion.\"\nMore From Fool.com Motley Fool Founders Issue New Stock Buy Alert Forget GE!

      "text": "Superb deal too since it's already cheaper on Amazon than CSI/MM etc. Just wanted to follow up on this since the sale is still live for a bit.Have gotten Agamemnon to the table three times already since it arrived and it's been a hit with everyone that has tried it. 5 minute rules teach, 3 minute set up, and plays in under 30 minutes. Definitely a keeper! It's a beautiful production and worth every penny of the very reasonable $24 MSRP, a bargain at the Amazon price of $14.xx and an absurdly hot deal using this offer to get it for even less.",

      "text": "Apple ( AAPL - Free Report ) and Amazon ( AMZN - Free Report ) shares were most rewarding in Thanksgiving week as shoppers opened their wallets, but Facebook ( FB - Free Report ) also jumped on news of its first share buyback plan.\nThanksgiving Again\nThe biggest shopping weekend of the year just happened and a ton of data has started pouring in, setting aside fears of weaker consumer spending and confirming that this year will be much bigger than the last.\nAdobe Digital Insights, the National Retail Federation (NRF) and some retailers have started sharing encouraging sales numbers.\nAccording to Adobe, more than $5 billion was spent online, with Black Friday sales topping $3 billion for the first time, up 21.6% from 2015. Thanksgiving sales were 11.5% higher. Mobile accounted for 57% of visits and 40% of sales on Thanksgiving Day and for the first time, accounted for more than a billion dollars in sales on Black Friday, up 33%. Shopper helper sites, email, displays, etc helped drive traffic this year with search ads and direct traffic contributing less than last year but remaining by far the largest drivers.\nThe five top selling toys were Lego Creator Sets, electric scooters from Razor, Nerf Guns, DJI Phantom Drones and Barbie Dreamhouse. The five top selling electronic products on Black Friday were Apple iPads, Samsung 4k TVs, Apple MacBook Air, LG TVs and Microsoft Xbox. Adobe collected anonymous data from 22.6 billion visits to retail websites and measured 80% of all online transactions from the top 100 U.S. retailers.\nAccording to the annual Thanksgiving weekend results survey released by the National Retail Federation and Prosper Insights & Analytics, average spending per person totaled $289.19, down slightly from $299.60 in 2015. Around 74% of spending was on gifts. Online shopping was slightly more popular than in-store with 44% of respondents going online and 40% shopping in-store. 36% shopped online on Thanksgiving Day (36% shopped in-store), 74% on Black Friday (75% in-store), 49% on Saturday (40% in-store) and 34% on Sunday (17% in-store). So it’s apparent that many shopped both online and in-store and probably also made use of omni-channel facilities.\nSignificantly, only 9% of shoppers have completed holiday shopping. 80% of millenials shopped during the weekend, underscoring the importance of the demographic to retailers. According to the survey, 56% of smartphone owners and 53% of tablet owners used their devices. The most popular gifts were clothing or clothing accessories, toys, electronics, books, CDs, DVDs, videos or video games and gift cards.\nComputer and Technology Sector Price Index Computer and Technology Sector Price Index\nCompany\nLast Week\nYTD\nAAPL\n+1.33%\n+6.49%\nFB\n+2.85%\n+16.00%\nGOOGL\n+0.69%\n+2.60%\nMSFT\n+0.09%\n+9.14%\nINTC\n+1.12%\n+3.08%\nCSCO\n-1.03%\n+10.25%\nAMZN\n+3.16%\n+13.61%\nOther stories -\nCorporate\nFacebook Announces Share Buyback : Facebook has announced that it will buy back shares worth $6 billion beginning in the first quarter of 2017. Technology companies usually pay out a lot of share based compensation in order to retain engineering talent. This increases the share count overtime.\nFacebook is one of the few top technology companies that hasn’t done any share repurchasing despite the fact that it has a large number of engineers and sits on a huge cash pile of around $26 billion. This announcement changes things. It’s also good news for investors concerned about its heavy investment plans going forward.\nFacebook CAO Out : According to a recent SEC filing, Facebook’s Chief Accounting Officer Jas Athwal will resign on Feb 17, 2017. Facebook is looking for a replacement and Athwal will help through the transition. The reason for the decision can probably be traced to the repeated errors in presenting advertising metrics to brands. Facebook announced last week that the \"organic reach\" of posts had been inflated and that actual reach might have been as much as 55% lower. While this didn’t affect the billed amount, it’s not a great thing for brands, which might demand more transparency going forward.\nOffice 365 Expands Geographies : Microsoft ( MSFT - Free Report ) has announced the expansion of Office 365 to 10 new geographies, which are Bhutan, Cambodia, Greenland, Guadeloupe, Laos, Maldives, Martinique, Mozambique, Myanmar and Vatican City. The company remains on track to transfer most of its current Office users to the cloud-based Office 365, as this will ensure Microsoft revenues even when users move to devices from competitors. Office 365 subscribers are now up to 24 million with the company adding a million in the last quarter itself. Microsoft expects that the next year will see the addition of 97 more countries.\nGoogle May Remove “In The News” Section : Alphabet’s ( GOOGL - Free Report ) Google will be removing its “in the news” section for desktop search and replacing with the “top news” carousel that it currently displays in mobile search. The company has reportedly been considering the change for some time, but sources are saying the change may be made quicker after people complained about incorrect information displayed in this section. Google’s search results are algorithm-based and the “in the news” section focuses on pulling out hot stories rather than news that have been vetted by approved parties, so the “in the news” section is currently being considered misleading.\nIBM Building UK Data Centers : Brexit has had no negative impact on technology investments in the UK. Following Facebook and Google, which decided to stick with their investment plans in the region, IBM ( IBM - Free Report ) announced that it would build four new data centers in the region and make the most of local talent, universities and Britain’s appreciation of the cloud as revolutionary technology. It currently has two data centers in the region.\nIBM Invests in Cyber Security : IBM is investing $200 million to build out its cyber security capabilities. The plan includes a new global security headquarters in Cambridge, expansion of capabilities and capacity for the global network of its X-Force Command Centers, and the creation of an IBM X-Force Incident Response and Intelligence Systems (IRIS) consulting team. Cyber security has become a burning issue given the number of hacking attacks even as companies of all sizes continue to migrate their operations to the cloud to take advantage of the increased efficiency and lower cost of operation. IBM’s investments come at an opportune time.\nTwitter’s Anthony Noto Assumes Bigger Role : Twitter ( TWTR - Free Report ) has decided that Anthony Noto, the current CFO will do a good job as CEO and its directors have decided that $940K in RSUs and another $325K in restricted RSUs to make a total compensation package of $12 million a year will get him to take the job. Noto replaces Adam Bain and Twitter will look for somebody to fill the vacated CFO position. Noto’s pushing of the video strategy and the resultant streaming of content from sports and news companies have become an important revenue earner for Twitter. In fact it appears to be its only hope of return to growth. This is likely the reason Noto is being brought into a role where he can directly oversee the operation.\nLegal/Regulatory\nIndonesia to Make Facebook Pay : After reaching a settlement with Google the details of which will be announced soon, Indonesia has turned attention to Facebook. Muhammad Haniv, head of the special taxpayers office at the Finance Ministry’s Tax Directorate-General believes that Facebook owes about 2 trillion rupiah ($148 million) to 3 trillion rupiah in unpaid taxes and penalties. The tax authorities have called for a meeting with Facebook and will likely be open to negotiations, just as it was with Google.\nArista Scores Win Over Cisco : U.S. customs have cleared certain Arista products that the ITC had previously banned for their infringement of Cisco patents. Arista says that the products have since been modified while Cisco says that the Arista’s workaround barely covers up for the infringement. The customs clearing is a positive signal for Arista but the fight is likely not over. Cisco, which appears to be losing share to its smaller rival can go to court again. So Arista may continue with its domestic production plans.\nEU Could Approve Microsoft Deal : Microsoft doesn’t have a great record with the EU, having had a fork out over $2 billion for bundling its products in a way that blocked out rivals. This time round, the company wants to make no mistakes. After applying for EU approval last month, the company had a meeting with the body last week, in which it promised concessions.\nUnidentified sources told Reuters that the company has agreed to allow rivals access to Outlook (which will be integrating LinkedIn data) so other social networks/users have access to it. Moreover, hardware makers like HP and Dell will be able to disable the LinkedIn shortcut on some device desktops. A lot of the ruckus is because of Salesforce CEO Mark Benioff, who has made a big protest on anticompetitive considerations after losing out to Microsoft in bidding for LinedIn. The EU is expected to decide on Dec 6.\nGoogle’s Settlement with Indonesia : Muhammad Haniv, head of the tax office’s special-cases unit, said in an interview last week that Google’s tax evasion case would be settled at not more than $73 million, much lower than the amount initially estimated. The tax authorities have said that Google and Facebook together collected 70% of the $830 million of digital advertising revenue generated in 2015 (Google estimates the market was worth $300 million according to the WSJ). The country is trying to collect tax from Internet companies while also deregulating some sectors and lowering the corporate tax rate in order to attract foreign investment.\nNew Technology/Products\nAmazon Dash Expands : Amazon has announced that a number of companies including GeniCan, Honeywell, Nestle and WePlenish have joined its Dash replenishment program. This allows the companies’ devices to automatically reorder items from Amazon when supplies run low.\nM&A and Collaborations\nAmazon-Fiat to Sell Cars : Amazon has tied with Fiat Chrysler to sell Italians their cars with a simply click. The online retailer is selling three models as of now, i.e. the 500, 500L and Panda, but it might sell others if it all goes smoothly. Online car shopping hasn’t happened to date although customers routinely research them online and even order parts. But selling has been impossible because of the agreements auto makers have with car dealers which do everything they can to prevent direct sales. But it’s happening in Italy, so it can happen back home too, albeit after some time.\nSome Numbers\nApple Black Friday Deals : Target and Best Buy are doing all they can to sell more Apple devices this holiday season. For the Black Friday weekend, Target is giving customers a $250 gift card for activating an iPhone 7 or 7 Plus phone. Apple Watch Series 1 is getting a $71 discount to retail for $198. There’s also a $150 discount on the Apple iPad Pro 9.7-inch 32GB Wi-Fi tablet, which is retailing at $449. At Best Buy, the iPhone gift card varies between $100 and $250 depending on the model of iPhone 7 purchased. Both companies are selling iPad Air 2 tablets starting at $274 (a $125 discount). They are also discounting Apple TV set-top boxes.\nSmartphone Profits : Strategy Analytics estimates that Apple’siPhone accounted for 91% of global smartphone profits, leaving Huawei a distant second with a 2.4% share. The third and fourth postions went to Chinese companies Vivo and OPPO, which took a 2.2% share each.\nAWS Price Cuts Can Hurt Amazon Profits : Evercore analyst Ken Sena, who has a buy rating on Amazon shares, said that the company’s latest pricing cuts indicated that it was getting too aggressive. He therefore lowered his revenue and profit outlook for the fourth quarter while recognizing that the price cut is likely included in the guidance.\nFurther, despite the fact that Amazon is expected to see some price elasticity benefit in 2017, he doesn’t expect this to completely offset the hit to revenue and profits. He therefore reduced his estimates for 2017 as well. Accordingly, the Q4AWS revenue estimate moved to $3.71 billion with the CSOI declining 2% to $2.02 billion. His 2017 AWS revenue estimate also moved 2% lower to $17.76 billion.\nHP Reports : HP Inc beat top line expectations while matching on the bottom line and Hewlett Packard Enterprise matched bottom line expectations while missing on the top line.\nWhere Do Zacks' Investment Ideas Come From?\nYou are welcome to download the full, up-to-the-minute list of 220 Zacks Rank #1 \"Strong Buy\" stocks free of charge.
