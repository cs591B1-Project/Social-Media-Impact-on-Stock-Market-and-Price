Pfizer's top-selling product, which requires three doses, brings it some $5 billion a year. \nBritain's GlaxoSmithKline Plc in September reduced the price of its rival Synflorix pneumococcal vaccine to $3.05 per dose for use in humanitarian emergencies.

      "text": "Pfizer lowers cost of Prevnar vaccine for some charity use The Associated Press Updated 10:40 am, Friday, November 11, 2016 Drugmaker Pfizer says it's reducing what it charges humanitarian groups for its blockbuster vaccine against pneumonia, ear and blood infections. Pfizer Inc. 's move to reduce Prevnar 13's price to $3.10 per dose — but only for the groups' use with refugees and in other emergency settings — follows pressure since 2009 by groups such as Doctors Without Borders . \"This is definitely a step in the right direction and will help to protect millions of vulnerable children,\" the charity said. The biggest U.S. drugmaker previously preferred tax-deductible donations, which don't impact Prevnar's much-higher price. Pfizer's top-selling product, which requires three doses, brings it some $5 billion a year. Britain's GlaxoSmithKline Plc in September reduced the price of its rival Synflorix pneumococcal vaccine to $3.05 per dose for use in humanitarian emergencies. Most Popular",

      "text": "Although some big names like AstraZeneca ( AZN - Free Report ) and Mylan ( MYL - Free Report ) reported Q3 results this week, earnings reports were overshadowed by the run-up to the Presidential election and the surprise win of Donald Trump. In fact, the pharma sector responded favorably to Trump’s victory on hopes that there will be fewer drug pricing headwinds considering Trump was not as vocal as Hillary Clinton about rising drug prices and excessive price hikes. Trump’s pro-business stand is also expected to benefit the sector. Major pharma companies should gain from Trump’s proposed tax plan and proposal to repatriate corporate profits held offshore at a one-time tax rate of 10%.\nRecap of the Week’s Most Important Stories\nCrestor Generics Hit AstraZeneca Revenues: AstraZeneca’s third quarter results were mixed with the company beating on earnings but falling short on revenues. In addition to cost management, earnings benefited from a non-recurring inter-government tax agreement as well. Shares were down following the release of Q3 results with sales being impacted by the genericization of Crestor. AstraZeneca also said that it was not likely to seek approval for its experimental immuno-oncology treatment, durvalumab, for second-line head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) based on the phase II HAWK study. The single arm study was initially designed as a potential fast-to-market opportunity for the second line indication but the company’s changed plans were based on the recent changes in the HNSCC landscape including the approval of Merck’s ( MRK - Free Report ) Keytruda for this patient population. Moreover, durvalumab was placed on partial clinical hold by the FDA in late October for HNSCC.\nValeant Q3 Results Disappoint: Valeant ( VRX - Free Report ) reported disappointing Q3 results missing both earnings and revenue estimates. Valeant also slashed its outlook for 2016 (Read more: Valeant Pharma Q3 Earnings Miss, Slashes Guidance ). The company is facing several headwinds apart from the drug pricing issue and ongoing investigations into its pricing policy. Generic competition for some products, soft performance of the dermatology business, a 3-month delay in the FDA action date for brodalumab (severe psoriasis), quality challenges related to manufacturing issues (Valeant got a warning letter for its Rochester, NY site from the FDA), product recalls, and back orders are some of the issues being faced by the company. Moreover, B+L international is facing challenges in Europe due to weakness in Poland and the Middle East, especially Turkey and Egypt. Not surprisingly, earnings estimates for Valeant are seeing downward revisions following the release of Q3 results.\nIs Pfizer Contemplating Sale of Consumer Healthcare Unit? According to a Reuters article, Pfizer ( PFE - Free Report ) is considering the sale or spin-off of its consumer health segment for as much as $14 billion. The company’s consumer healthcare segment, which brought in sales of $2.5 billion in the first nine months of 2016, is known for products like Advil, Centrum and Chapstick among others.\nWe remind investors that earlier this year, Pfizer had decided against splitting up its business. However, on the third quarter call on being asked about the consumer business, CEO Read had said that the company evaluates all its businesses and subjects them to tests to see whether they are worth more inside or outside Pfizer.\nMeanwhile, Pfizer was also in the news for the EU approval of Ibrance for a specific type of breast cancer. This makes Ibrance the first medicine in a new class of anti-cancer treatments, CDK 4/6 inhibitors, to be approved in Europe and also the first new medicine to be approved for the treatment of women with this particular type of metastatic breast cancer in the first-line setting in almost 10 years. Ibrance is one of the most promising new products in Pfizer’s portfolio and EU approval was expected considering the CHMP had issued a positive opinion in September. Ibrance sales were $1.5 billion in the first nine months of 2016.\nPfizer is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here .\nMylan & Partner Biocon File Herceptin Biosimilar: Mylan, which missed Q3 estimates (Read more: Mylan Q3 Earnings & Revenues Miss on EpiPen Woes ), announced the submission of a regulatory application for a biosimilar version of Roche’s ( RHHBY - Free Report ) Herceptin (trastuzumab) in the U.S. This is Mylan’s first FDA biosimilar submission, and the company believes it has the potential to be the first to seek approval for a biosimilar version of Herceptin in the U.S.\nBristol-Myers Provides Updates on Opdivo, Signs Deal with Nitto: Bristol-Myers ( BMY - Free Report ) came out with several updates this week. The company gained FDA approval for its immuno-oncology treatment Opdivo for use in head and neck cancer.\nOpdivo also met the primary endpoint in a late-stage study for unresectable advanced or recurrent gastric cancer refractory to, or intolerant of, standard therapy. This is good news for the company as Opdivo is the first and only immuno-oncology agent to demonstrate overall survival advantage in this patient population.\nThe company also announced a 5-year research collaboration with Johns Hopkins University for the identification of mechanisms of response and resistance in patients whose cancer is being treated with checkpoint inhibitor-based immunotherapies, including Opdivo monotherapy, or Opdivo in combination with Yervoy or other investigational immunotherapies.\nA clinical trial agreement was also signed with Infinity for Opdivo plus Infinity’s IPI-549 in patients with advanced solid tumors.\nThe company has also signed an exclusive worldwide license agreement with Nitto Denko for the development and commercialization of Nitto’s investigational siRNA molecules targeting heat shock protein 47 (HSP47) in vitamin A containing formulations. The collaboration includes Nitto’s lead asset ND-L02-s0201, currently in early-stage development for the treatment of advanced liver fibrosis.\nThe agreement will see Bristol-Myers shelling out $100 million upfront and making subsequent payments in the form of clinical and regulatory milestone payments, royalties, sales based milestone payments as well as option exercise payments for lung and other organ fibrosis. This deal once again shows pharma’s interest in developing treatments for fibrotic diseases and to develop therapies for patients living with advanced non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and cirrhosis due to NASH.\nPerformance\nLarge Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry Price Index\nLarge Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry Price Index\nThe NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index recorded a gain of 7.6% over the last five trading days reflecting a positive response to Trump’s win. Moreover, Proposition 61, California’s ballot measure to ensure that the State of California is able to negotiate with drug companies for drug prices that do not exceed the price paid for the same drugs by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, was shot down by voters.\nAmong major pharma stocks, both Pfizer and Bristol-Myers shot up more than 12% while AstraZeneca was down slightly on Q3 results. Over the last six months, Bristol-Myers declined 20.8% while Merck was up 18.8% (See the last pharma stock roundup here: Pfizer, Allergan Q3 Results Fall Short, Insulin Drugmakers under Pricing Pressure ).\nWhat's Next in the Pharma World?\nCompanies like Bristol-Myers will be showcasing data at the annual meeting of the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and the Association of Rheumatology Health Professionals (ARHP) in the coming days. Bristol-Myers will also be presenting data along with Pfizer on Eliquis at the American Heart Association (AHA) Scientific Sessions 2016.\nNow See Our Private Investment Ideas\nWhile the above ideas are being shared with the public, other trades are hidden from everyone but selected members.

      "text": "Print \nSeeking to defuse a nasty row, Pfizer has lowered the price of its pneumococcal vaccine to non-governmental organizations that supply poor countries. \nThe company will sell the newest version of its Prevnar 13 vaccine for $3.10 a dose, which means the three-dose treatment to vaccinate a child will cost $9.30. This is the same price that Gavi, an international public-private partnership, has paid since last year. Gavi acts as a bridge between drug makers and philanthropic groups in negotiating supplies for 57 poor and developing countries. \nUntil now, though, Pfizer had not made the same offer to non-governmental organizations or civil society groups. And the price drop comes after a protracted dispute with Doctors Without Borders, in particular. The nonprofit has repeatedly criticized Pfizer for failing to lower its price and make it more widely available to humanitarian organizations that work in poor and developing countries. article continues after advertisement \nDoctors Without Borders has aggressively pushed Pfizer to cut its price to $5 per child, arguing the company was overcharging both donors and developing countries for a vaccine that has generated billions of dollars in sales in wealthy nations. In the first nine months of this year, the Prevnar vaccine generated about $4.3 billion in sales. Doctors Without Borders chastises Pfizer for refusing to lower vaccine price \nIn a report issued last year, Doctors Without Borders maintained pneumococcal vaccines were 68 times more expensive than in 2001 and attributed 45 percent of the increased cost to pricing. GlaxoSmithKline also sells a vaccine but recently agreed to lower its price and make it available to humanitarian groups. Pneumococcal disease kills about 1 million children per year, mostly in poor and developing nations. \nLast year, Pfizer offered the vaccine to Doctors Without Borders for $15.60 a dose, but Kate Elder, the group’s vaccines policy adviser, said the offer was refused. Last month, the group rejected a donation of 1 million doses, and Jason Cone, the executive director, penned a blog post in which he argued he had to decline the offer so that he would not “undermine long-term efforts” to obtain a better price. \nHe greeted the Pfizer price cut cautiously. While praising the lower price, Cone continued to chastise the company for not dropping the price more. \n“This is definitely a step in the right direction,” he said in a statement. Subscribe to our Pharmalot newsletter Please enter a valid email address. \nElder added that, “we called for $5 per child for the three needed doses and we still think the price is still too high and should be reduced across the board for all governments that can’t afford it.” Nonetheless, Doctors Without Borders does plan to accept the offer once details are reviewed, such as any stipulations on the amount of vaccine that must be purchased. \nA Pfizer spokeswoman wrote us that the World Health Organization is “establishing a new validation process to identify which organizations and situations should be considered eligible for pricing. Once finalized, which is expected to happen shortly, this process will be used as guidance for identifying eligible parties.” Ed Silverman can be reached at Follow Ed on Twitter @Pharmalot",

Pfizer’s top-selling product, which requires three doses, brings it some $5 billion a year. \nBritain’s GlaxoSmithKline Plc in September reduced the price of its rival Synflorix pneumococcal vaccine to $3.05 per dose for use in humanitarian emergencies. ❯❯ Click the Icon below to share this post...",

They are designed be used in combination with existing drugs in women whose tumors grow in response to oestrogen and whose cancer is not caused by the HER2 protein. \nSales of Ibrance, which was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in February 2015, are forecast by analysts to be some $2.1 billion in 2016, according to Thomson Reuters data. \nNovartis plans to file its rival medicine for approval worldwide this year, following promising clinical trial results. \n(Reporting by Ben Hirschler; Editing by Greg Mahlich) Read the original article on Reuters .

      "text": "Pfizer May Sell Consumer Health Business (PFE) By Shobhit Seth | November 11, 2016 — 6:08 PM EST \nPfizer Inc. ( PFE ) may sell or spin off its consumer health business in a $14 billion deal. The discussions are in the preliminary stages and no details were disclosed, Reuters reported . \nPfizer’s consumer business segment generates $3.5 billion in annual revenues, and includes products like painkiller Advil and lip balm Chapstick. \nLast year, Rakesh Kapoor, the CEO of Reckitt Benckiser Group Plc, expressed interest in buying Pfizer’s consumer unit. \nPfizer CEO Ian Read said during a recent quarterly call that the drug giant was assessing if the segment was better inside or outside the company. There's still a chance Pfizer may opt to retain the operations. Recent M&A Activity \nNew York-based Pfizer has been a frontrunner in a few high-value M&A deals in the pharma segment recently. \nIt acquired Medivation Inc. in a $14 billion deal, which was followed by the acquisition of Anacor Pharmaceuticals for $5.2 billion. (For more, see Pfizer Acquires Medivation for $14 Billion .) \nHowever, Pfizer's recent attempts to purchase Ireland-based drug manufacturer, Allergan Inc. ( AGN ), for a hefty $160 billion fell through. \nDuring the past few years, other major drug companies have successfully sold their consumer care units. For instance, Merck & Co ( MRK ) got $14.2 billion from the sale of its consumer care business to Germany’s Bayer AG. \nSimilarly, GlaxoSmithKline ( GSK ) and Novartis ( NVS ) merged their consumer health business segments in a $20 billion asset swap. The unit is now run by Glaxo. (See also: Pfizer Exits Brazil: Teva Is Suitor .)

      "text": "* Prevenar vaccine at lowest price for emergencies * Pfizer to donate proceeds to refugee support groups * Move follows similar by rival drugmaker GSK By Kate Kelland LONDON, Nov 11 (Reuters) - U.S. pharmaceuticals giant Pfizer is to offer its pneumococcal vaccine at the lowest possible price to non-governmental organisations seeking to protect vulnerable people from illness in humanitarian crises. In what it called a major expansion of its humanitarian assistance work, the drugmaker said its Prevenar 13 shot, which protects babies and children against pneumonia and other diseases, would be offered in a new multi-dose vial at the lowest prevailing global price, currently $3.10 per dose. \"In addition, given the acute need for aid on the ground, Pfizer will donate all sales proceeds for the first year of this program to humanitarian groups undertaking the difficult work of reaching vulnerable populations in emergency settings,\" the company said in a statement. The move follows a similar one by the British drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline, which said in September it would cut the price of its pneumococcal vaccine, Synflorix, to $3.05 when it is used in humanitarian crises. The World Health Organization said last month it was seeking to establish an emergency vaccine supply system aimed at getting vital shots to vulnerable people in crises such as wars or natural disasters.

The Pfizer logo is seen at its world headquarters in New York. Picture: Andrew Kelly. Credit: REUTERS \n“In addition, given the acute need for aid on the ground, Pfizer will donate all sales proceeds for the first year of this program to humanitarian groups undertaking the difficult work of reaching vulnerable populations in emergency settings,” the company said in a statement. \nThe move follows a similar one by the British drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline, which said in September it would cut the price of its pneumococcal vaccine, Synflorix, to $3.05 when it is used in humanitarian crises. \nThe World Health Organisation said last month it was seeking to establish an emergency vaccine supply system aimed at getting vital shots to vulnerable people in crises such as wars or natural disasters.

Pfizer's top-selling product, which requires three doses, brings it some $5 billion a year.\nBritain's GlaxoSmithKline Plc in September reduced the price of its rival Synflorix pneumococcal vaccine to $3.05 per dose for use in humanitarian emergencies.\nCopyright 2016 The Associated Press.

However, these companies took very different paths to adding these drugs to their portfolios. \nPfizer and AbbVie waited until these medicines were already top sellers before they bought their way in, while Astellas and Johnson & Johnson took the risk of licensing them while they were still in clinical trials.

Daniel Acker/Bloomberg via Getty Images hide caption \ntoggle caption Daniel Acker/Bloomberg via Getty Images Pfizer's Celebrex fared well in a safety study that compared the pain reliever with ibuprofen and naproxen.\nDaniel Acker/Bloomberg via Getty Images A large study has produced reassuring evidence about a drug that millions of people use to alleviate pain from arthritis and other ailments.\nThe study found no evidence that the drug Celebrex , or generically celecoxib, poses any greater risk for causing heart attacks and strokes than two other widely used pain relievers.\n\"What we found was surprising,\" says Steven Nissen , a cardiologist at the Cleveland Clinic who reported the results Sunday at an American Heart Association meeting in New Orleans.\nDoctors have been concerned about Celebrex for more than a decade because it is very similar to another pain reliever called Vioxx , which was pulled from the market in 2004 after being linked to heart attacks and strokes\nCelebrex \"didn't share the risks that were seen with Vioxx,\" says Nissen, whose findings were also published online by the New England Journal of Medicine .\nNissen and other heart specialists cautioned that Celebrex can increase the chance of cardiovascular complications. But it doesn't appear to boost those odds nearly as much as Vioxx, or even as much as other painkillers thought to be safer. Both Vioxx and Celebrex are so-called Cox-2 inhibitors, which act by blocking an enzyme involved in inflammation.\n  Moreover, the study suggests Celebrex may be less risky than other so-called nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs , in other ways. For example, Celebrex appears to pose less of a risk of causing kidney problems.\n\"It is very reassuring,\" says Milton Packer , a cardiologist at Baylor University who was not involved in the study. \"I think what we'll see is a greater confidence in the use of drugs like Celebrex. I think people will turn to it now more frequently.\"\nBut others cautioned that all the drugs tested remain risky, especially for people with heart disease. \"It's reassuring that it's not as bad as Vioxx, but it's not a recommendation to take the medication,\" says Dr. Mary Norine Walsh , the president-elect of the American College of Cardiology.\nAfter Vioxx came on the market in 1999, it quickly became a blockbuster used by millions of people because it was designed to cause fewer gastrointestinal complications that existing NSAIDs.\nThe Food and Drug Administration allowed continued sales of Celebrex even though it was very similar. But the agency ordered Pfizer Inc ., the company marketing Celebrex, to study the drug's safety. In 2005, however, Pfizer withdrew Bextra, another Cox-2 inhibitor, at the FDA's request.\nCelebrex is used by an estimated 2 million Americans each year for arthritis, menstrual cramps and other aches and pains.\nThe new study involved 24,081 patients with osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis. One-third of the patients took Celebrex. One-third took prescription doses of ibuprofen. The remaining third took prescription naproxen.\nIbuprofen is sold over the counter in much lower doses as a generic and under a variety of brand names, including Advil and Motrin. Naproxen, also generic, is sold over the counter with various names, like Aleve and Naprosyn.\nHigher, prescription doses of ibuprofen and naproxen were more likely than Celebrex to cause digestive system problems, such as ulcers and bleeding, the researchers found.\nSpecifically, naproxen had a 1.5 percent risk of gastrointestinal complications, ibuprofen had a 1.6 percent risk, and Celebrex had a 1.1 percent risk in a 30-month period.\nThat wasn't a surprise. Celebrex and Vioxx were designed to be easier on the digestive system than the existing NSAIDs. But some other risks were surprising, Nissen says.\nCompared with Celebrex, patients taking ibuprofen were more likely to experience kidney problems, including kidney failure and the need for dialysis.\nSpecifically, there was a 1.1 percent risk of kidney complications among those taking ibuprofen for 30 months, versus a 0.7 percent risk among those taking Celebrex and a 0.9 percent risk among those taking naproxen, the researchers report.\nAll these drugs are known to carry some risks to kidney function, but the risk from ibuprofen was higher than expected, Nissen says.\nThere was also a hint that naproxen and ibuprofen may pose more of a risk of causing cardiovascular complications that Celebrex. Nissen stresses, however, that finding was only borderline statistically significant for ibuprofen.\nIn addition, there was an even weaker hint that naproxen might increase the risk for death for any reason, compared with Celebrex. But that wasn't statistically significant either.\nIt means those risks could have been statistical flukes. But they do warrant further investigation, he says.\n\"What is so surprising about it is that most authorities have believed that if there was a drug that was the safest, it was naproxen,\" Nissen says. \"So we were pretty surprised that there was this borderline significant increase in all-cause mortality with naproxen.\"\nAnd Celebrex turned out to be the least likely of the three drugs to increase the risk for cardiovascular complications. The risk of dying, suffering a stroke or having a heart attack among patients taking Celebrex was 2.3 percent during a 30-month period, compared to 2.5 percent for naproxen and 2.7 percent for ibuprofen.\nNissen stresses that all the patients in the study took doses of these drugs available in the prescription formulation — not the much lower doses most people take when they buy them without a prescription and use them occasionally.\nThe maximum recommended over-the-counter dose of ibuprofen is typically 1,200 milligrams daily. The study used 600 milligrams of ibuprofen three times a day, or 1,800 milligrams daily. Naproxen tablets are sold over the counter at a dose of 220 milligrams, and are taken twice a day. The study used doses between 375 and 500 milligrams taken twice a day.\n\"I don't want the public to think that if you take an occasional ibuprofen or naproxen that you're going to have kidney failure or you're going to die,\" Nissen says. \"We didn't study that. We studied daily doses in arthritis patients [taking] ... high doses of these drugs.\"\nBut the findings should encourage people who need pain relief to take the lowest dose of the drugs for the shortest time possible.\n\"If you twist your knee and you hurt, I want people to take medicines for pain relief,\" Nissen says. \"But when they're better, try to get off the drugs and not take them every day and not take them in very high doses.\"\nOther doctors agreed.\n\"There's probably a risk of all of these drugs, especially at high doses,\" Packer says. \"The question is: If you need these drugs for pain, which is the safest? Right now, based on this study, it appears Celebrex has advantages.\"\nSeveral experts pointed out that the study has some flaws. The dose of Celebrex tested was relatively low, for example, and a significant number of subjects dropped out of the study, which raises questions about the reliability of the findings.",

      "text": "Company News   4:45pm EST Pfizer's Celebrex shown to be as safe as ibuprofen or naproxen -study By Bill Berkrot | NEW ORLEANS \nNEW ORLEANS Nov 13 Pfizer Inc's Celebrex arthritis drug was shown to be at least as safe as the widely used prescription-strength versions of painkillers ibuprofen and naproxen, and does not appear to cause heart problems that spurred the withdrawal of rival Vioxx, according to a large 10-year study presented on Sunday. \nThe study of arthritis sufferers is likely to raise eyebrows, given long-held concerns about Celebrex. Some 100 million prescriptions were written in the United States in 2013 alone for the type of painkiller known as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDS, to which all three drugs belong. \nCelebrex, or celecoxib, belongs to a class of NSAID called Cox-2 inhibitors that were designed to prevent gastrointestinal bleeding common with many NSAIDs. \nThe primary goal of the 24,000-patient trial was to demonstrate that Celebrex did not cause an increased risk of serious heart problems compared with the other two drugs. The main measures of heart attack, stroke or death occurred between 2 percent and 3 percent of patients for all three medicines, a statistically significant result for non-inferiority. \n\"I think it's incontrovertible that celecoxib is not worse than these older NSAIDS,\" said Dr. Steven Nissen, the study's lead investigator. \nU.S. regulators ordered the study after pulling Merck & Co's blockbuster pain drug Vioxx from the market for causing heart attacks and deaths, leading many in the medical community to assume that the entire class of Cox-2 inhibitors was similarly tainted. \nMerck at one point offered the theory that naproxen, to which Vioxx was compared in studies, protected the heart. \n\"Everybody thought: 'Oh, naproxen is the safest; Celebrex is probably like Vioxx,'\" said Nissen, chief of cardiology at the Cleveland Clinic, who presented the data at the American Heart Association's scientific meeting in New Orleans. \"Everybody thought they knew the answer, and the entire world was wrong.\" \nAnnual sales of Celebrex, which is now off patent, have declined to about $775 million for Pfizer. The drug is available as a generic from many companies, including Mylan NV and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. \nCelebrex sales were about $3 billion in 2014 and could have been far higher but for safety concerns. In 2005, U.S. regulators ordered Pfizer to withdraw another Cox-2 pain drug, Bextra, over a host of safety issues and added a safety warning to the Celebrex label. \nNaproxen is the active ingredient in Bayer AG's Aleve, while ibuprofen is the main component of Pfizer's Advil. \nThe older drugs in the study were taken at higher doses and for far longer than the recommendations for the over-the-counter versions. Researchers stressed that safety issues seen in the study should not lead to conclusions about occasional use of the OTC products. \nCardiology researchers also said it was unclear how these results might affect prescribing habits of the primary care doctors who most often treat arthritis patients. \nPatients in the study took the drugs for 20 months on average and were followed for another 14 months. But 27 percent of those enrolled dropped out. Researchers said many chronic pain patients seek additional or alternative therapy. \nOn some secondary measures of the study, Celebrex actually fared better. Death for any reason was 25 percent higher with naproxen than Celebrex, although that did not quite reach statistical significance, while kidney problems were 64 percent higher with ibuprofen than Celebrex. \n\"I was completely surprised at the excess of renal toxicity with ibuprofen,\" Nissen said. \nThere was also a significant excess of gastrointestinal problems with ibuprofen and naproxen, such as severe anemia likely due to internal bleeding. \nDr. Elliott Antman, a past AHA president who critiqued the study, noted several limitations, including that those taking ibuprofen or naproxen were allowed to increase their dosage but not the Celebrex group. He called for a much more detailed analysis of the data. \nDr. Clyde Yancy, another past AHA president who also was not involved in the study, cited a need for better drugs. \n\"Clearly we need an additional therapeutic option for patients who have known cardiovascular disease and a chronic pain syndrome,\" he said. Available therapies have enough limitations \"that we're not where we need to be.\" (Reporting by Bill Berkrot; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn) Next In Company News",

      "text": "Health News   5:13pm EST Pfizer's Celebrex shown to be as safe as ibuprofen or naproxen: study A company logo is seen at a Pfizer office in Dublin, Ireland November 24, 2015. REUTERS/Cathal McNaughton By Bill Berkrot | NEW ORLEANS \nNEW ORLEANS Pfizer Inc's Celebrex arthritis drug was shown to be at least as safe as the widely used prescription-strength versions of painkillers ibuprofen and naproxen, and does not appear to cause heart problems that spurred the withdrawal of rival Vioxx, according to a large 10-year study presented on Sunday. \nThe study of arthritis sufferers is likely to raise eyebrows, given long-held concerns about Celebrex. Some 100 million prescriptions were written in the United States in 2013 alone for the type of painkiller known as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDS, to which all three drugs belong. \nCelebrex, or celecoxib, belongs to a class of NSAID called Cox-2 inhibitors that were designed to prevent gastrointestinal bleeding common with many NSAIDs. \nThe primary goal of the 24,000-patient trial was to demonstrate that Celebrex did not cause an increased risk of serious heart problems compared with the other two drugs. The main measures of heart attack, stroke or death occurred between 2 percent and 3 percent of patients for all three medicines, a statistically significant result for non-inferiority. \n\"I think it's incontrovertible that celecoxib is not worse than these older NSAIDS,\" said Dr. Steven Nissen, the study's lead investigator. \nU.S. regulators ordered the study after pulling Merck & Co's blockbuster pain drug Vioxx from the market for causing heart attacks and deaths, leading many in the medical community to assume that the entire class of Cox-2 inhibitors was similarly tainted. \nMerck at one point offered the theory that naproxen, to which Vioxx was compared in studies, protected the heart. \n\"Everybody thought: 'Oh, naproxen is the safest; Celebrex is probably like Vioxx,'\" said Nissen, chief of cardiology at the Cleveland Clinic, who presented the data at the American Heart Association's scientific meeting in New Orleans. \"Everybody thought they knew the answer, and the entire world was wrong.\" \nAnnual sales of Celebrex, which is now off patent, have declined to about $775 million for Pfizer. The drug is available as a generic from many companies, including Mylan NV and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. \nCelebrex sales were about $3 billion in 2014 and could have been far higher but for safety concerns. In 2005, U.S. regulators ordered Pfizer to withdraw another Cox-2 pain drug, Bextra, over a host of safety issues and added a safety warning to the Celebrex label. \nNaproxen is the active ingredient in Bayer AG's Aleve, while ibuprofen is the main component of Pfizer's Advil. \nThe older drugs in the study were taken at higher doses and for far longer than the recommendations for the over-the-counter versions. Researchers stressed that safety issues seen in the study should not lead to conclusions about occasional use of the OTC products. \nCardiology researchers also said it was unclear how these results might affect prescribing habits of the primary care doctors who most often treat arthritis patients. \nPatients in the study took the drugs for 20 months on average and were followed for another 14 months. But 27 percent of those enrolled dropped out. Researchers said many chronic pain patients seek additional or alternative therapy. \nOn some secondary measures of the study, Celebrex actually fared better. Death for any reason was 25 percent higher with naproxen than Celebrex, although that did not quite reach statistical significance, while kidney problems were 64 percent higher with ibuprofen than Celebrex. \n\"I was completely surprised at the excess of renal toxicity with ibuprofen,\" Nissen said. \nThere was also a significant excess of gastrointestinal problems with ibuprofen and naproxen, such as severe anemia likely due to internal bleeding. \nDr. Elliott Antman, a past AHA president who critiqued the study, noted several limitations, including that those taking ibuprofen or naproxen were allowed to increase their dosage but not the Celebrex group. He called for a much more detailed analysis of the data. \nDr. Clyde Yancy, another past AHA president who also was not involved in the study, cited a need for better drugs. \n\"Clearly we need an additional therapeutic option for patients who have known cardiovascular disease and a chronic pain syndrome,\" he said. Available therapies have enough limitations \"that we're not where we need to be.\" \n(Reporting by Bill Berkrot; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn) Next In Health News",

      "text": "A \nNEW ORLEANS: Pfizer Inc's Celebrex arthritis drug was shown to be at least as safe as the widely used prescription-strength versions of painkillers ibuprofen and naproxen, and does not appear to cause heart problems that spurred the withdrawal of rival Vioxx, according to a large 10-year study presented on Sunday. \nThe study of arthritis sufferers is likely to raise eyebrows, given long-held concerns about Celebrex. Some 100 million prescriptions were written in the United States in 2013 alone for the type of painkiller known as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDS, to which all three drugs belong. \nCelebrex, or celecoxib, belongs to a class of NSAID called Cox-2 inhibitors that were designed to prevent gastrointestinal bleeding common with many NSAIDs. \nThe primary goal of the 24,000-patient trial was to demonstrate that Celebrex did not cause an increased risk of serious heart problems compared with the other two drugs. The main measures of heart attack, stroke or death occurred between 2 percent and 3 percent of patients for all three medicines, a statistically significant result for non-inferiority. \n\"I think it's incontrovertible that celecoxib is not worse than these older NSAIDS,\" said Dr. Steven Nissen, the study's lead investigator. \nU.S. regulators ordered the study after pulling Merck & Co's blockbuster pain drug Vioxx from the market for causing heart attacks and deaths, leading many in the medical community to assume that the entire class of Cox-2 inhibitors was similarly tainted. \nMerck at one point offered the theory that naproxen, to which Vioxx was compared in studies, protected the heart. \n\"Everybody thought: 'Oh, naproxen is the safest; Celebrex is probably like Vioxx,'\" said Nissen, chief of cardiology at the Cleveland Clinic, who presented the data at the American Heart Association's scientific meeting in New Orleans. \"Everybody thought they knew the answer, and the entire world was wrong.\" \nAnnual sales of Celebrex, which is now off patent, have declined to about US$775 million for Pfizer. The drug is available as a generic from many companies, including Mylan NV and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. \nCelebrex sales were about US$3 billion in 2014 and could have been far higher but for safety concerns. In 2005, U.S. regulators ordered Pfizer to withdraw another Cox-2 pain drug, Bextra, over a host of safety issues and added a safety warning to the Celebrex label. \nNaproxen is the active ingredient in Bayer AG's Aleve, while ibuprofen is the main component of Pfizer's Advil. \nThe older drugs in the study were taken at higher doses and for far longer than the recommendations for the over-the-counter versions. Researchers stressed that safety issues seen in the study should not lead to conclusions about occasional use of the OTC products. \nCardiology researchers also said it was unclear how these results might affect prescribing habits of the primary care doctors who most often treat arthritis patients. \nPatients in the study took the drugs for 20 months on average and were followed for another 14 months. But 27 percent of those enrolled dropped out. Researchers said many chronic pain patients seek additional or alternative therapy. \nOn some secondary measures of the study, Celebrex actually fared better. Death for any reason was 25 percent higher with naproxen than Celebrex, although that did not quite reach statistical significance, while kidney problems were 64 percent higher with ibuprofen than Celebrex. \n\"I was completely surprised at the excess of renal toxicity with ibuprofen,\" Nissen said. \nThere was also a significant excess of gastrointestinal problems with ibuprofen and naproxen, such as severe anemia likely due to internal bleeding. \nDr. Elliott Antman, a past AHA president who critiqued the study, noted several limitations, including that those taking ibuprofen or naproxen were allowed to increase their dosage but not the Celebrex group. He called for a much more detailed analysis of the data. \nDr. Clyde Yancy, another past AHA president who also was not involved in the study, cited a need for better drugs. \n\"Clearly we need an additional therapeutic option for patients who have known cardiovascular disease and a chronic pain syndrome,\" he said. Available therapies have enough limitations \"that we're not where we need to be.\" \n(Reporting by Bill Berkrot; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn) - Reuters",

      "text": "Pfizer's Celebrex shown to be as safe as ibuprofen or naproxen: study Reuters Photo: \nBy Bill Berkrot \nNEW ORLEANS (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc's Celebrex arthritis drug was shown to be at least as safe as the widely used prescription-strength versions of painkillers ibuprofen and naproxen, and does not appear to cause heart problems that spurred the withdrawal of rival Vioxx, according to a large 10-year study presented on Sunday. \nThe study of arthritis sufferers is likely to raise eyebrows, given long-held concerns about Celebrex. Some 100 million prescriptions were written in the United States in 2013 alone for the type of painkiller known as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDS, to which all three drugs belong. \nCelebrex, or celecoxib, belongs to a class of NSAID called Cox-2 inhibitors that were designed to prevent gastrointestinal bleeding common with many NSAIDs. \nThe primary goal of the 24,000-patient trial was to demonstrate that Celebrex did not cause an increased risk of serious heart problems compared with the other two drugs. The main measures of heart attack, stroke or death occurred between 2 percent and 3 percent of patients for all three medicines, a statistically significant result for non-inferiority. \n\"I think it's incontrovertible that celecoxib is not worse than these older NSAIDS,\" said Dr. Steven Nissen, the study's lead investigator. \nU.S. regulators ordered the study after pulling Merck & Co's blockbuster pain drug Vioxx from the market for causing heart attacks and deaths, leading many in the medical community to assume that the entire class of Cox-2 inhibitors was similarly tainted. \nMerck at one point offered the theory that naproxen, to which Vioxx was compared in studies, protected the heart. \n\"Everybody thought: 'Oh, naproxen is the safest; Celebrex is probably like Vioxx,'\" said Nissen, chief of cardiology at the Cleveland Clinic, who presented the data at the American Heart Association's scientific meeting in New Orleans. \"Everybody thought they knew the answer, and the entire world was wrong.\" \nAnnual sales of Celebrex, which is now off patent, have declined to about $775 million for Pfizer. The drug is available as a generic from many companies, including Mylan NV and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. \nCelebrex sales were about $3 billion in 2014 and could have been far higher but for safety concerns. In 2005, U.S. regulators ordered Pfizer to withdraw another Cox-2 pain drug, Bextra, over a host of safety issues and added a safety warning to the Celebrex label. \nNaproxen is the active ingredient in Bayer AG's Aleve, while ibuprofen is the main component of Pfizer's Advil. \nThe older drugs in the study were taken at higher doses and for far longer than the recommendations for the over-the-counter versions. Researchers stressed that safety issues seen in the study should not lead to conclusions about occasional use of the OTC products. \nCardiology researchers also said it was unclear how these results might affect prescribing habits of the primary care doctors who most often treat arthritis patients. \nPatients in the study took the drugs for 20 months on average and were followed for another 14 months. But 27 percent of those enrolled dropped out. Researchers said many chronic pain patients seek additional or alternative therapy. \nOn some secondary measures of the study, Celebrex actually fared better. Death for any reason was 25 percent higher with naproxen than Celebrex, although that did not quite reach statistical significance, while kidney problems were 64 percent higher with ibuprofen than Celebrex. \n\"I was completely surprised at the excess of renal toxicity with ibuprofen,\" Nissen said. \nThere was also a significant excess of gastrointestinal problems with ibuprofen and naproxen, such as severe anemia likely due to internal bleeding. \nDr. Elliott Antman, a past AHA president who critiqued the study, noted several limitations, including that those taking ibuprofen or naproxen were allowed to increase their dosage but not the Celebrex group. He called for a much more detailed analysis of the data. \nDr. Clyde Yancy, another past AHA president who also was not involved in the study, cited a need for better drugs. \n\"Clearly we need an additional therapeutic option for patients who have known cardiovascular disease and a chronic pain syndrome,\" he said. Available therapies have enough limitations \"that we're not where we need to be.\" \n(Reporting by Bill Berkrot; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)",

      "text": "Pfizer's Celebrex shown to be as safe as ibuprofen or naproxen: study By Bill Berkrot Pin it Share A company logo is seen at a Pfizer office in Dublin, Ireland November 24, 2015. REUTERS/Cathal McNaughton More By Bill Berkrot NEW ORLEANS (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc's Celebrex arthritis drug was shown to be at least as safe as the widely used prescription-strength versions of painkillers ibuprofen and naproxen, and does not appear to cause heart problems that spurred the withdrawal of rival Vioxx, according to a large 10-year study presented on Sunday. The study of arthritis sufferers is likely to raise eyebrows, given long-held concerns about Celebrex. Some 100 million prescriptions were written in the United States in 2013 alone for the type of painkiller known as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDS, to which all three drugs belong. Celebrex, or celecoxib, belongs to a class of NSAID called Cox-2 inhibitors that were designed to prevent gastrointestinal bleeding common with many NSAIDs. The primary goal of the 24,000-patient trial was to demonstrate that Celebrex did not cause an increased risk of serious heart problems compared with the other two drugs. The main measures of heart attack, stroke or death occurred between 2 percent and 3 percent of patients for all three medicines, a statistically significant result for non-inferiority. \"I think it's incontrovertible that celecoxib is not worse than these older NSAIDS,\" said Dr. Steven Nissen, the study's lead investigator. U.S. regulators ordered the study after pulling Merck & Co's blockbuster pain drug Vioxx from the market for causing heart attacks and deaths, leading many in the medical community to assume that the entire class of Cox-2 inhibitors was similarly tainted. Merck at one point offered the theory that naproxen, to which Vioxx was compared in studies, protected the heart. \"Everybody thought: 'Oh, naproxen is the safest; Celebrex is probably like Vioxx,'\" said Nissen, chief of cardiology at the Cleveland Clinic, who presented the data at the American Heart Association's scientific meeting in New Orleans. \"Everybody thought they knew the answer, and the entire world was wrong.\" Annual sales of Celebrex, which is now off patent, have declined to about $775 million for Pfizer. The drug is available as a generic from many companies, including Mylan NV and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. Celebrex sales were about $3 billion in 2014 and could have been far higher but for safety concerns. In 2005, U.S. regulators ordered Pfizer to withdraw another Cox-2 pain drug, Bextra, over a host of safety issues and added a safety warning to the Celebrex label. Naproxen is the active ingredient in Bayer AG's Aleve, while ibuprofen is the main component of Pfizer's Advil. The older drugs in the study were taken at higher doses and for far longer than the recommendations for the over-the-counter versions. Researchers stressed that safety issues seen in the study should not lead to conclusions about occasional use of the OTC products. Cardiology researchers also said it was unclear how these results might affect prescribing habits of the primary care doctors who most often treat arthritis patients. Patients in the study took the drugs for 20 months on average and were followed for another 14 months. But 27 percent of those enrolled dropped out. Researchers said many chronic pain patients seek additional or alternative therapy. On some secondary measures of the study, Celebrex actually fared better. Death for any reason was 25 percent higher with naproxen than Celebrex, although that did not quite reach statistical significance, while kidney problems were 64 percent higher with ibuprofen than Celebrex. \"I was completely surprised at the excess of renal toxicity with ibuprofen,\" Nissen said. There was also a significant excess of gastrointestinal problems with ibuprofen and naproxen, such as severe anemia likely due to internal bleeding. Dr. Elliott Antman, a past AHA president who critiqued the study, noted several limitations, including that those taking ibuprofen or naproxen were allowed to increase their dosage but not the Celebrex group. He called for a much more detailed analysis of the data. Dr. Clyde Yancy, another past AHA president who also was not involved in the study, cited a need for better drugs. \"Clearly we need an additional therapeutic option for patients who have known cardiovascular disease and a chronic pain syndrome,\" he said. Available therapies have enough limitations \"that we're not where we need to be.\" (Reporting by Bill Berkrot; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn) Reblog",

In addition, patients treated with celecoxib experienced significantly fewer gastrointestinal events as compared with those receiving prescription doses of ibuprofen or naproxen. The PRECISION trial helps to refute the assumption held by many physicians that naproxen treatment results in better cardiovascular outcomes as compared to other NSAIDs, including celecoxib. It is important to note that given the trial’s design – prescription doses and chronic use in patients with cardiovascular risk factors – no inferences are possible regarding the safety of intermittent use of low-dose, over-the-counter NSAIDs.\nThe results of the PRECISION study were presented today at the annual meeting of the American Heart Association in New Orleans by Dr. Steve Nissen, chairman of cardiovascular medicine at the Cleveland Clinic and principal investigator of the PRECISION trial. In addition, the results were published today in the New England Journal of Medicine .\nPRECISION was a prospective, long-term non-inferiority trial of 24,081 patients designed to assess the cardiovascular safety of Celebrex (celecoxib) versus prescription strength doses of ibuprofen and naproxen in patients with chronic pain from OA or RA. The trial, designed in 2005 based on discussions with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, was funded by Pfizer but directed independently by the Cleveland Clinic and governed by an executive committee composed of cardiology, gastroenterology, and rheumatology specialists.\n“We are pleased with the results of this landmark study. Questions about the cardiovascular safety of prescription NSAIDs have persisted since the withdrawal of Vioxx (rofecoxib) from the market in 2004,” said Ian Read, chairman and chief executive officer of Pfizer Inc. “The study demonstrated that patients treated with prescription doses of celecoxib, ibuprofen or naproxen had similar rates of cardiovascular events and dispels the long held perception of excess cardiovascular risk associated with long term use of Celebrex.”\nThe primary objective of PRECISION was to assess the effects of celecoxib (100-200 mg twice daily) compared to prescription strength doses of ibuprofen (600-800 mg three times a day) or naproxen (375-500mg twice a day) on the first occurrence of cardiovascular (CV) death, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) or non-fatal stroke in subjects with OA or RA and who have established cardiovascular disease or risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Pre-specified secondary objectives including assessments of additional cardiovascular endpoints, significant gastrointestinal events, renal events and arthritis pain improvement will be published at a later date. All subjects were provided with esomeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor, to be taken once daily as a gastro-protective agent. Patients also had the option of continuing low-dose aspirin for additional cardio-protective effects regardless of their CV risk.\nTop-Line Results:\nThe final PRECISION trial results provide statistically strong evidence that cardiovascular risk with approved doses of celecoxib is not greater than that of prescription doses of ibuprofen and naproxen. The study showed that patients with chronic arthritic conditions and CV risk factors taking celecoxib experienced numerically fewer cardiovascular events as compared to patients receiving prescription strength doses of ibuprofen and naproxen. More specifically, a primary endpoint occurred in 2.3 percent of patients receiving celecoxib as compared to 2.5 percent for patients receiving naproxen and 2.7 percent for patients receiving ibuprofen.\nIn addition, regarding secondary analyses, significantly fewer GI events occurred among patients treated with celecoxib as compared with those receiving prescription doses of either ibuprofen or naproxen. More specifically, serious gastrointestinal events occurred in 1.1 percent of patients receiving celecoxib as compared to 1.5 percent for patients receiving prescription doses of naproxen and 1.6 percent for patients receiving prescription doses of ibuprofen. The gastrointestinal safety findings were observed despite providing all patients enrolled in the study with a proton pump inhibitor to reduce stomach acids. In addition, the secondary endpoint involving renal events occurred with a lower frequency in patients treated with celecoxib as compared to prescription doses of ibuprofen.\n“NSAIDs are an important treatment option for millions of arthritis patients around the globe. The results of the PRECISION study underscore the cardiovascular and gastrointestinal safety of Celebrex for the long-term treatment of chronic arthritic conditions,” said Freda Lewis-Hall, M.D., chief medical officer and executive vice president of Pfizer Inc.\nAbout Osteoarthritis and Rheumatoid Arthritis:\nArthritis is a chronic, progressive medical condition characterized by inflammation, swelling and pain in and around the joints. The two most common forms of arthritic disorders are OA and RA. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, arthritic conditions affect more than 50 million adults in the US and are a leading cause of disability. Today, more than 80 percent of OA patients have limited mobility and 25 percent of patients are unable to perform daily tasks.\nNSAIDs :\nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDS) are among the most widely prescribed medicines in the world due to their effective anti-inflammatory and pain relieving properties which enable patients to function more normally. However, there have been concerns over the chronic, long-term use of prescription NSAIDs because of potentially serious gastrointestinal (GI) complications such as major and minor bleeding, ulcers, and perforations. GI complications resulting from prescription NSAID use are among the most common drug side effects in the United States due to the use of these medications for chronic pain management in conditions such as OA and RA.\nImportant Celebrex (celecoxib) Safety Information\nAll prescription NSAIDs, like CELEBREX, ibuprofen, naproxen, and meloxicam, increase the risk of heart attack or stroke that can lead to death. This may happen early in treatment and may increase with increasing doses of NSAIDs and with longer use of NSAIDs.\nCELEBREX should never be used right before or after a heart surgery called “coronary artery bypass graft” (CABG).\nAvoid taking NSAIDs after a recent heart attack, unless your healthcare provider tells you to do so. You may have an increased risk of another heart attack if you take NSAIDs after a recent heart attack.\nNSAID medications, like CELEBREX, cause an increased risk of bleeding, ulcers, and tears (perforation) of the esophagus, stomach, and intestines, at any time during treatment, which can occur without warning and may cause death.\nPrescription CELEBREX should be used exactly as prescribed at the lowest dose possible and for the shortest time needed.\nDo not take CELEBREX if you have had an asthma attack, hives, or other allergic reactions to aspirin, any other NSAID medicine, or certain drugs called sulfonamides.\nBefore you take CELEBREX, inform your healthcare provider of any medical conditions you may have and of all of the medications you take, including prescription or over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, or herbal supplements as they may increase the risk for serious side effects.\nTell your doctor about all of your medical conditions, including if you:\nhave liver or kidney problems have a history of ulcers or bleeding in the stomach or intestines have high blood pressure or heart failure have asthma are pregnant or plan to become pregnant—CELEBREX, and other NSAIDs should not be taken in late pregnancy (after 29 weeks) are breastfeeding or plan to breast feed CELEBREX can cause serious side effects, including:\nnew or worse high blood pressure heart failure liver problems including liver failure kidney problems including kidney failure low red blood cells (anemia) life-threatening allergic reactions life-threatening skin reactions Other side effects of NSAIDs, including CELEBREX are stomach pain, constipation, diarrhea, indigestion, heartburn, nausea, vomiting, and dizziness.\nGet emergency help right away if you have any of the following symptoms: shortness of breath or trouble breathing, chest pain, weakness in one part or side of your body, slurred speech, swelling of the face or throat. Discontinue CELEBREX at first sign of skin rash, or blisters with fever.\nClick here for full prescribing information , including BOXED WARNING and Medication Guide.\nWorking together for a healthier world®\nAt Pfizer, we apply science and our global resources to bring therapies to people that extend and significantly improve their lives.

      "text": "Home » News » Pfizer cuts cost of pneumonia vaccine for humanitarian crises Pfizer cuts cost of pneumonia vaccine for humanitarian crises On 12:33 am In Health , News by Tony Comments \nBy Sola Ogundipe \nI n what has been described as a major expansion of its humanitarian assistance work, pharmaceuticals giant Pfizer, has said its pneumococcal vaccine, Prevenar 13, which protects babies and children against pneumonia and other diseases, would be offered in a new multi-dose vial at the lowest prevailing global price, currently $3.10 per dose. \nThe announcement which came on the eve of this year’s World Pneumonia day, November 12, said the vaccine will be offered at the lowest possible price to non-governmental organizations seeking to protect vulnerable people from illness in humanitarian crises. \nIn a statement, the company noted that given the acute need for aid on the ground, all sales proceeds for the first year of the programme would be donated to humanitarian groups undertaking the difficult work of reaching vulnerable populations in emergency settings. This move follows a similar one recently by British drug maker GlaxoSmithKline, which offered to cut the price of its own pneumococcal vaccine, Synflorix, to $3.05 when it is used in humanitarian crises. \nEmergency vaccine supply \nThe World Health Organization is seeking to establish an emergency vaccine supply system aimed at getting vital shots to vulnerable people in crises such as wars or natural disasters. \nPneumonia is a severe infection that affects lungs making it difficult to absorp oxygen. It affects people of all ages and income groups and is one of the top five causes of death among children under 5 years of age, and responsible for 16 per cent of all deaths in this age group. \nThe disease is the number one killer of children under 5 years of age globally. In Nigeria it is one of the top three killers of children, and the country has the highest burden in Africa and second highest overall in the world. \nPneumonia is caused by bacteria, viruses and other microorganisms. Common causes of the fatal pneumonia are pneumococcus and Haemophilus influenza type b (HIB). \nDespite advances in treatment, there are indications that pneumonia could become a bigger problem in the future. \nThe goal of World Pneumonia Day is to raise awareness of the problem and bring together people to find better ways to handle, diagnose, and treat pneumonia.",

The study tested Celebrex against prescription-strength ibuprofen or naproxen in 24,000 people with heart disease or a high risk for it.\nThe drugs proved similar on heart risks and Celebrex caused fewer stomach problems.\nResults were discussed Sunday at an American Heart Association conference and published by the New England Journal of Medicine.\nCopyright 2016 The Associated Press.

      "text": "\nA company logo is seen at a Pfizer office in Dublin Thomson Reuters \nBy Bill Berkrot \nNEW ORLEANS (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc's Celebrex arthritis drug was shown to be at least as safe as the widely used prescription-strength versions of painkillers ibuprofen and naproxen, and does not appear to cause heart problems that spurred the withdrawal of rival Vioxx, according to a large 10-year study presented on Sunday. \nThe study of arthritis sufferers is likely to raise eyebrows, given long-held concerns about Celebrex. Some 100 million prescriptions were written in the United States in 2013 alone for the type of painkiller known as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDS, to which all three drugs belong. \nCelebrex, or celecoxib, belongs to a class of NSAID called Cox-2 inhibitors that were designed to prevent gastrointestinal bleeding common with many NSAIDs. \nThe primary goal of the 24,000-patient trial was to demonstrate that Celebrex did not cause an increased risk of serious heart problems compared with the other two drugs. The main measures of heart attack, stroke or death occurred between 2 percent and 3 percent of patients for all three medicines, a statistically significant result for non-inferiority. \n\"I think it's incontrovertible that celecoxib is not worse than these older NSAIDS,\" said Dr. Steven Nissen, the study's lead investigator. \nU.S. regulators ordered the study after pulling Merck & Co's blockbuster pain drug Vioxx from the market for causing heart attacks and deaths, leading many in the medical community to assume that the entire class of Cox-2 inhibitors was similarly tainted. \nMerck at one point offered the theory that naproxen, to which Vioxx was compared in studies, protected the heart. \n\"Everybody thought: 'Oh, naproxen is the safest; Celebrex is probably like Vioxx,'\" said Nissen, chief of cardiology at the Cleveland Clinic, who presented the data at the American Heart Association's scientific meeting in New Orleans. \"Everybody thought they knew the answer, and the entire world was wrong.\" \nAnnual sales of Celebrex, which is now off patent, have declined to about $775 million for Pfizer. The drug is available as a generic from many companies, including Mylan NV and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. \nCelebrex sales were about $3 billion in 2014 and could have been far higher but for safety concerns. In 2005, U.S. regulators ordered Pfizer to withdraw another Cox-2 pain drug, Bextra, over a host of safety issues and added a safety warning to the Celebrex label. \nNaproxen is the active ingredient in Bayer AG's Aleve, while ibuprofen is the main component of Pfizer's Advil. \nThe older drugs in the study were taken at higher doses and for far longer than the recommendations for the over-the-counter versions. Researchers stressed that safety issues seen in the study should not lead to conclusions about occasional use of the OTC products. \nCardiology researchers also said it was unclear how these results might affect prescribing habits of the primary care doctors who most often treat arthritis patients. \nPatients in the study took the drugs for 20 months on average and were followed for another 14 months. But 27 percent of those enrolled dropped out. Researchers said many chronic pain patients seek additional or alternative therapy. \nOn some secondary measures of the study, Celebrex actually fared better. Death for any reason was 25 percent higher with naproxen than Celebrex, although that did not quite reach statistical significance, while kidney problems were 64 percent higher with ibuprofen than Celebrex. \n\"I was completely surprised at the excess of renal toxicity with ibuprofen,\" Nissen said. \nThere was also a significant excess of gastrointestinal problems with ibuprofen and naproxen, such as severe anemia likely due to internal bleeding. \nDr. Elliott Antman, a past AHA president who critiqued the study, noted several limitations, including that those taking ibuprofen or naproxen were allowed to increase their dosage but not the Celebrex group. He called for a much more detailed analysis of the data. \nDr. Clyde Yancy, another past AHA president who also was not involved in the study, cited a need for better drugs. \n\"Clearly we need an additional therapeutic option for patients who have known cardiovascular disease and a chronic pain syndrome,\" he said. Available therapies have enough limitations \"that we're not where we need to be.\" \n(Reporting by Bill Berkrot; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn) Read the original article on Reuters . Copyright 2016.

      "title": "Pfizer pledges discounted Prevnar 13 in 'major' boost to humanitarian programs",
      "text": "A month after the global charity Médecins Sans Frontières publicly turned its back on Pfizer’s offer for a million free Prevnar 13 doses, the drug giant on Friday announced a “major expansion” to its humanitarian assistance with the vaccine.\nTo help address emergencies, Pfizer will reduce the price of its pneumococcal blocker Prevnar 13 to the “lowest prevailing global” cost of $3.10 per dose in such cases. What’s more, for the first year of the program, it’ll donate all proceeds “to humanitarian groups undertaking the difficult work of reaching vulnerable populations in emergency settings,” according to a statement .\nThe move follows years of public shaming by MSF, which repeatedly asked Pfizer and London pharma giant GlaxoSmithKline to lower their prices.\nBreaking news! #Pfizer lowered the price of the pneumonia vaccine for humanitarian orgs. It's a step in the right direction! #AskPharma pic.twitter.com/m2RTHsc3c0\n— MSF International (@MSF) November 11, 2016 To get the new program started, Pfizer will offer a “short-term” donation of single-dose Prevnar 13 vials. Then, in 2017, the pharma giant will supply a multidose vial that contains four doses in the same size container.\nThe new formulation is “designed to address the unique conditions and challenges experienced in developing world settings and can help health workers in humanitarian emergencies,” Pfizer said in its statement. Back in July, when Pfizer announced WHO backing for the multidose vial, the company said the formulation vial could reduce temperature-controlled supply chain requirements, UNICEF shipping costs and storage requirements, all by 75%.\nPfizer’s surprise announcement on Friday follows an open letter issued in October by MSF U.S. Director Jason Cone, who explained that the charity couldn’t accept the company’s offer to donate 1 million Prevnar 13 doses. Cone said that “free is not always better,” and that the conditions that come with such donations can delay vaccination campaigns and “undermine long-term efforts to increase access.” He pointed out that corporate “goodwill” and donations \"can disappear as quickly as they come.\"\nPfizer’s Prevnar family is the best-selling vaccine franchise in the world, pulling in more than $6 billion in sales last year.\nPfizer's move also follows a decision by Pfizer's Big Pharma peer GlaxoSmithKline to lower the price of its own Synflorix during humanitarian emergencies. Back in September, GSK said it’d offer the pneumococcal vaccine at a price of $3.05 per dose for vaccination during crises.\nFor years, MSF has pushed for both companies to reduce their prices, with little success until recently. The charity used petitions and protests, and even dumped a pile of $17 million in fake money outside of Pfizer’s New York headquarters with the words “drop the price” painted on the bills.",

Some 100 million prescriptions were written in the United States in 2013 alone for the type of painkiller known as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDS, to which all three drugs belong.\nMore on this...

      "text": "by Ben Adams | Nov 14, 2016 8:53am \nPfizer is to team up with scientists from the National Cancer Institute to work on three of its leading pipeline immunotherapy oncology meds against a host of cancer targets. \nThe co-op deal , financial details of which were not published, will see the two assess Pfizer’s ($PFE) OX40 agonist, its utomilumab and the German Merck-partnered avelumab both alone and in various combos with other meds, including chemo, radiation therapy and standard meds. \nPfizer has so far released little detailed info about the mAb OX40 agonist and the 4-1BB-targeting utomilumab, but back in May, Pfizer and Merck KGaA announced they would combine all three of these experimental therapies in an early-stage study and comes as the U.S. giant seeks to play catch-up in the checkpoint inhibitor space dominated by Merck ($MRK), Bristol-Myers ($BMY) and newcomer Roche ($RHHBY). \nThe pact sees both the preclinical and clinical studies to be co-led by Dr. Jeffrey Schlom, chief of the Laboratory of Tumor Immunology and Biology at NCI's Center for Cancer Research; Dr. James Gulley, chief of the Genitourinary Malignancies Branch at CCR; and Dr. Chris Boshoff, senior VP and head of immuno-oncology at Pfizer. \nBoshoff said: “We are looking forward to combining our expertise with those at the NCI to explore agents targeting the immune system in doublet and triplet combinations. Clinical studies focused on translational endpoints will allow us to optimally develop potential rational combinations. The [deal] is an important collaboration for us as we seek to realize the full potential of immunotherapy and hope to ultimately transform the cancer treatment paradigm.” \nBeyond this latest collab, Pfizer is advancing these and other assets from its growing immuno-oncology portfolio with single-agent and novel combination studies, both internally and through other collaborations. \nPfizer has been growing its cancer pipeline over the past five years, with NSCLC treatment Xalkori, aging blockbuster kidney cancer drug Sutent and its follow-up Inlyta, as well as breast cancer drug Ibrance, which is set to hit the $1 billion sales mark this year, all bringing in solid sales for the drugmaker. \nBut Pfizer was not on the original bandwagon for the new cancer class of checkpoint inhibitors and is now playing catch-up with avelumab. The two companies are also testing the experimental therapy in ovarian, gastric, lung and bladder cancer settings. \nAfter the recent collapse of its potential $160 billion deal to buy Ireland’s Allergan ($AGN) to lower its tax bill, the U.S. drugmaker stumped up $14 billion to buy Medivation ($MDVN), its blockbuster prostate cancer drug Xtandi, and its pipeline of mid- to late-stage oncology assets, earlier this year.

      "text": "Per $1,000 principal amount. (2) Hypothetical Tender Offer Consideration calculated on the basis of pricing for the U.S. Treasury Reference Security as of 2:00 p.m., New York City time, on November 10, 2016 and a Settlement Date (as defined below) on November 21, 2016. The actual Tender Offer Consideration (as defined below) payable pursuant to the Tender Offer will be calculated and determined as set forth in the offer to purchase, dated November 14, 2016 (the “ Offer to Purchase ”). \nThe Tender Offer consists of an offer on the terms and conditions set forth in the Offer to Purchase, and the related letter of transmittal and notice of guaranteed delivery (as they may each be amended or supplemented from time to time, the “ Tender Offer Documents ”), to purchase for cash any and all of the Notes. The Company refers investors to the Tender Offer Documents for the complete terms and conditions of the Tender Offer. \nThe Tender Offer will expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on November 18, 2016, unless extended or earlier terminated (such time and date, as the same may be extended, the “ Expiration Date ”). Holders of Notes must validly tender (including by notice of guaranteed delivery) and not validly withdraw their Notes prior to or at the Expiration Date to be eligible to receive the Tender Offer Consideration. \nHolders who validly tender their Notes, may validly withdraw their tendered Notes at any time prior to the earlier of (i) the Expiration Date, and (ii) if the Tender Offer is extended, the 10 th business day after commencement of the Tender Offer. Notes may also be validly withdrawn at any time after the 60 th business day after commencement of the Tender Offer if for any reason the Tender Offer has not been consummated within 60 business days after commencement of the Tender Offer. \nThe “ Tender Offer Consideration ” for each $1,000 principal amount of Notes validly tendered and accepted for purchase pursuant to the Tender Offer will be determined in the manner described in the Tender Offer Documents by reference to a fixed spread specified for the Notes (the “ Fixed Spread ”) specified in the table above plus the yield based on the bid-side price of the U.S. Treasury Reference Security specified in the table above at 2:00 p.m., New York City time, on November 18, 2016, unless extended or earlier terminated. \nHolders will also receive accrued and unpaid interest on Notes validly tendered and accepted for purchase from the last interest payment date up to, but not including, the date the Company initially makes payment for such Notes, which date is anticipated to be November 21, 2016 (the “ Settlement Date ”). Notes tendered by notice of guaranteed delivery and accepted for purchase will be purchased on the third business day after the Expiration Date but payment of accrued interest on such Notes will only be made to, but not including, the Settlement Date. \nPfizer intends to redeem any and all Notes that are not tendered and accepted in the Tender Offer in accordance with the terms of the make-whole provisions under the indenture governing the Notes. \nThe Tender Offer is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions specified in the Tender Offer Documents, but the Tender Offer is not subject to minimum tender conditions. \nInformation Relating to the Tender Offer \nThe Tender Offer Documents for the Notes are being distributed to holders beginning today. Citigroup Global Markets Inc. is the dealer manager for the Tender Offer. Investors with questions regarding the Tender Offer may contact Citigroup Global Markets Inc. at (800) 558-3745 (toll-free) or (212) 723-6106 (collect). Global Bondholder Services Corporation is the depositary and information agent for the Tender Offer and can be contacted at (866) 470-4300 (toll-free) or (212) 430-3774 (collect). \nNone of the Company or its affiliates, their respective boards of directors, the dealer manager, the depositary and information agent or the trustee with respect to the Notes is making any recommendation as to whether holders should tender any Notes in response to the Tender Offer, and neither the Company nor any such other person has authorized any person to make any such recommendation. Holders must make their own decision as to whether to tender any of their Notes, and, if so, the principal amount of Notes to tender. \nThis press release is for informational purposes only and is not an offer to buy, or the solicitation of an offer to sell, any of the Notes and the Tender Offer does not constitute an offer to buy or the solicitation of an offer to sell Notes in any jurisdiction or in any circumstances in which such offer or solicitation are unlawful.

      "text": "Pfizer to Collaborate with National Cancer Institute to Study Three Immunotherapy Agents Targeting Multiple Cancers Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) assesses OX40 agonist, utomilumab and avelumab immuno-oncology assets alone and in various combinations November 14, 2016 08:00 AM Eastern Standard Time \nNEW YORK--( BUSINESS WIRE )--Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) today announced that it has entered into a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with the National Cancer Institute (NCI), part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). As part of the CRADA, Pfizer will collaborate with NCI’s Center for Cancer Research (CCR) to arrange and conduct preclinical and clinical trials to evaluate three investigational immunotherapy agents. These include Pfizer’s proprietary immunotherapy agonistic monoclonal antibodies targeting OX40 (CD134), (also known as PF-04518600); and utomilumab, targeting 4-1BB (CD137), (also known as PF-05082566); as well as avelumab, a fully human anti-PD-L1 IgG1 monoclonal antibody (also known as PF-06834635 and MSB0010718C), which is being developed through an alliance between Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, and Pfizer. \nThe collaborative preclinical and clinical studies will be co-led by Dr. Jeffrey Schlom, chief of the Laboratory of Tumor Immunology and Biology at CCR, Dr. James Gulley, chief of the Genitourinary Malignancies Branch at CCR, and Dr. Chris Boshoff, Senior Vice President and Head of Immuno-oncology, Translational and Early Development, Pfizer Global Product Development. Under the CRADA, the three investigational immunotherapies will be studied alone, in various combinations with each other, and in combination with standard therapies, such as chemotherapy, radiation and targeted therapies across a range of cancers. \n“We are looking forward to combining our expertise with those at the NCI to explore agents targeting the immune system in doublet and triplet combinations. Clinical studies focused on translational endpoints will allow us to optimally develop potential rational combinations,” said Chris Boshoff. “The CRADA is an important collaboration for us as we seek to realize the full potential of immunotherapy and hope to ultimately transform the cancer treatment paradigm.” \nBeyond this collaboration, Pfizer is advancing these and other assets from its growing immuno-oncology portfolio with single agent and novel combination studies, both internally and through other collaborations. \nAbout Pfizer Oncology \nPfizer Oncology is committed to pursuing innovative treatments that have a meaningful impact on those living with cancer. As a leader in oncology speeding cures and accessible breakthrough medicines to patients, Pfizer Oncology is helping to redefine life with cancer.

      "title": "Pfizer’s Celebrex Shown to Be as Safe as Other Painkillers",
      "text": "Pfizer’s Celebrex arthritis drug was shown to be at least as safe as the widely used prescription-strength versions of painkillers ibuprofen and naproxen, and does not appear to cause heart problems that spurred the withdrawal of rival Vioxx, according to a large 10-year study presented on Sunday.\nThe study of arthritis sufferers is likely to raise eyebrows, given long-held concerns about Celebrex. Some 100 million prescriptions were written in the United States in 2013 alone for the type of painkiller known as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDS, to which all three drugs belong.\nCelebrex, or celecoxib, belongs to a class of NSAID called Cox-2 inhibitors that were designed to prevent gastrointestinal bleeding common with many NSAIDs.\n \nThe primary goal of the 24,000-patient trial was to demonstrate that Celebrex did not cause an increased risk of serious heart problems compared with the other two drugs. The main measures of heart attack, stroke or death occurred between 2% and 3% of patients for all three medicines, a statistically significant result for non-inferiority.\n“I think it’s incontrovertible that celecoxib is not worse than these older NSAIDS,” said Dr. Steven Nissen, the study’s lead investigator.\nU.S. regulators ordered the study after pulling Merck & Co’s blockbuster pain drug Vioxx from the market for causing heart attacks and deaths, leading many in the medical community to assume that the entire class of Cox-2 inhibitors was similarly tainted.\nMerck at one point offered the theory that naproxen, to which Vioxx was compared in studies, protected the heart.\n“Everybody thought: ‘Oh, naproxen is the safest; Celebrex is probably like Vioxx,'” said Nissen, chief of cardiology at the Cleveland Clinic, who presented the data at the American Heart Association’s scientific meeting in New Orleans. “Everybody thought they knew the answer, and the entire world was wrong.”\nAnnual sales of Celebrex, which is now off patent, have declined to about $775 million for Pfizer . The drug is available as a generic from many companies, including Mylan NV and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.\nCelebrex sales were about $3 billion in 2014 and could have been far higher but for safety concerns. In 2005, U.S. regulators ordered Pfizer to withdraw another Cox-2 pain drug, Bextra, over a host of safety issues and added a safety warning to the Celebrex label.\nNaproxen is the active ingredient in Bayer AG’s Aleve, while ibuprofen is the main component of Pfizer’s Advil.\nThe older drugs in the study were taken at higher doses and for far longer than the recommendations for the over-the-counter versions. Researchers stressed that safety issues seen in the study should not lead to conclusions about occasional use of the OTC products.\nCardiology researchers also said it was unclear how these results might affect prescribing habits of the primary care doctors who most often treat arthritis patients.\nPatients in the study took the drugs for 20 months on average and were followed for another 14 months. But 27% of those enrolled dropped out. Researchers said many chronic pain patients seek additional or alternative therapy.\nOn some secondary measures of the study, Celebrex actually fared better. Death for any reason was 25% higher with naproxen than Celebrex, although that did not quite reach statistical significance, while kidney problems were 64% higher with ibuprofen than Celebrex.\n“I was completely surprised at the excess of renal toxicity with ibuprofen,” Nissen said.\nThere was also a significant excess of gastrointestinal problems with ibuprofen and naproxen, such as severe anemia likely due to internal bleeding.\nDr. Elliott Antman, a past AHA president who critiqued the study, noted several limitations, including that those taking ibuprofen or naproxen were allowed to increase their dosage but not the Celebrex group. He called for a much more detailed analysis of the data.\nDr. Clyde Yancy, another past AHA president who also was not involved in the study, cited a need for better drugs.\n“Clearly we need an additional therapeutic option for patients who have known cardiovascular disease and a chronic pain syndrome,” he said. Available therapies have enough limitations “that we’re not where we need to be.”",

      "text": "Contact Pfizer Media Relations Pfizer to Collaborate with National Cancer Institute to Study Three Immunotherapy Agents Targeting Multiple Cancers Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) assesses OX40 agonist, utomilumab and avelumab immuno-oncology assets alone and in various combinations Monday, November 14, 2016 8:00 am EST Dateline: US7170811035 \"Forward-Looking Information and Factors That May Affect Future Results\" \nNEW YORK--( BUSINESS WIRE )--Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) today announced that it has entered into a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with the National Cancer Institute (NCI), part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). As part of the CRADA, Pfizer will collaborate with NCI’s Center for Cancer Research (CCR) to arrange and conduct preclinical and clinical trials to evaluate three investigational immunotherapy agents. These include Pfizer’s proprietary immunotherapy agonistic monoclonal antibodies targeting OX40 (CD134), (also known as PF-04518600); and utomilumab, targeting 4-1BB (CD137), (also known as PF-05082566); as well as avelumab, a fully human anti-PD-L1 IgG1 monoclonal antibody (also known as PF-06834635 and MSB0010718C), which is being developed through an alliance between Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, and Pfizer. \nThe collaborative preclinical and clinical studies will be co-led by Dr. Jeffrey Schlom, chief of the Laboratory of Tumor Immunology and Biology at CCR, Dr. James Gulley, chief of the Genitourinary Malignancies Branch at CCR, and Dr. Chris Boshoff, Senior Vice President and Head of Immuno-oncology, Translational and Early Development, Pfizer Global Product Development. Under the CRADA, the three investigational immunotherapies will be studied alone, in various combinations with each other, and in combination with standard therapies, such as chemotherapy, radiation and targeted therapies across a range of cancers. \n“We are looking forward to combining our expertise with those at the NCI to explore agents targeting the immune system in doublet and triplet combinations. Clinical studies focused on translational endpoints will allow us to optimally develop potential rational combinations,” said Chris Boshoff. “The CRADA is an important collaboration for us as we seek to realize the full potential of immunotherapy and hope to ultimately transform the cancer treatment paradigm.” \nBeyond this collaboration, Pfizer is advancing these and other assets from its growing immuno-oncology portfolio with single agent and novel combination studies, both internally and through other collaborations. \nAbout Pfizer Oncology \nPfizer Oncology is committed to pursuing innovative treatments that have a meaningful impact on those living with cancer. As a leader in oncology speeding cures and accessible breakthrough medicines to patients, Pfizer Oncology is helping to redefine life with cancer.

      "text": "Pfizer Cuts Pneumonia Vaccine Price for NGOs (PFE) By Shobhit Seth | November 14, 2016 — 3:17 PM EST \nPfizer Inc. ( PFE ) has reduced the price of its pneumococcal vaccine, Prevenar 13, to the lowest prevailing global price of $3.10 per dose, to meet humanitarian emergency needs in poor countries. \nThe New York-based pharmaceuticals major said the drastically reduced prices will exclusively apply to non-governmental organizations that supply the Prevenar 13 vaccine (which protects children and babies from pneumonia) to poor countries. \nThe drug price is now same as that paid last year by Gavi, a global public-private partnership, which negotiates supplies for 57 poor and developing nations. Pressure from Nonprofit Groups \nPfizer has been under pressure to bring down its drug price from nonprofit organizations, in particular Doctors Without Borders (DWB). \nDoctors Without Borders published a report last year claiming that Prevenar 13 has experienced massive price hikes that have made the pneumonia drug 68 times more expensive than it was in 2001. (See also: Drug Companies May Be Charged by DOJ .) \nPfizer tried to sort the matter out by offering to supply the vaccine to Doctors Without Borders for $15.60 per dose, but that offer was rejected, and DWB demanded Pfizer cut the price to $5 per child. \nA subsequent attempt was made to offer 1 million doses for free as a donation. This too was rejected , as Doctors Without Borders insisted “such a move might undermine long-term efforts to increase access for people in poor countries.” Pneumococcal Drug \nPfizer's latest move to lower the price of Prevenar 13 to its lowest level globally was welcomed by Doctors Without Borders. (See also: Pfizer Sells Infusion Therapy Business .) \nGlaxoSmithKline PLC ( GSK ) did something similar in September, when it reduced the price of its pneumococcal vaccine, Synflorix, to $3.05 per dose to recognized civil society organizations. \nPneumococcal diseases are widespread in poor and developing nations, and lead to an estimated 1 million child deaths each year. \nPrevnar 13 generated $6.2 billion in revenue for Pfizer in 2015, and has garnered $4.3 billion in sales during the first nine months of 2016.

      "text": "Should You Keep an Eye on Pfizer in 2016 and Beyond? PART: Should You Keep an Eye on Pfizer in 2016 and Beyond? PART 1 OF 5 Why Is Pfizer Trading at Discounted Valuation Multiples? By Margaret Patrick | Nov 14, 2016 4:25 pm EST Discounted valuation multiples \nOn November 4, 2016, Pfizer ( PFE ) was trading at a forward price-to-earnings (or PE) multiple of ~10.7x. \nSince January 1, 2015, Pfizer has mostly traded at discounted PE multiples, compared to other oncology players Novartis ( NVS ), Merck & Co. ( MRK ), and Eli Lilly ( LLY ). \nIn 2015, Pfizer was actively involved in multiple small acquisitions worth ~$40 billion. These acquisitions are expected to strengthen Pfizer’s position in high growth markets such as oncology, rheumatology, sterile injectables, and biosimilars. \nIf Pfizer proves successful in leveraging its acquired assets, it could boost its revenue and profit margins in the near term. This could have a positive impact on the company’s share price as well as the price of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF ( SPY ). Pfizer makes up about 1.0% of SPY’s total portfolio holdings. Investor sentiment \nFollowing the release of its 3Q16 earnings, Pfizer’s share price fell ~3.4%, from $31.07 on November 1, 2016, to $30.00 on November 4, 2016. The depressed investor sentiment was mainly the result of Pfizer’s discontinuing its research program for its PCSK9 inhibitor therapy, bococizumab. This decision was based on a holistic view of the results from its six Phase 3 trials for the drug in the context of the evolving cardiovascular landscape. \nIn its Phase 3 trials, including two 52-week studies, Pfizer noted that the efficacy of bococizumab in lowering low-density lipoprotein (or LDL) cholesterol reduced with the passage of time. Additionally, the company noted side effects such as larger-than-expected immunogenicity—or immune response—from the body and reactions at injection sites. \nThere have been significant payer constraints related to reimbursements for this class of drugs. These constraints have already been witnessed by Amgen’s Repatha. Based on these conditions, Pfizer believes that there’s less market potential for bococizumab than it had previously expected. \nInvestors are disappointed because Pfizer had already enrolled subjects in two large ongoing cardiovascular outcome studies, SPIRE-1 and SPIRE-2. In addition to the lost growth opportunity, the discontinuation of this research program is expected to add to Pfizer’s operating expenses in future quarters. \nIn the next article, we’ll analyze analysts’ recommendations for Pfizer and its peers in 2016.

      "text": "Go for It, Pfizer -- Sell Your Consumer Healthcare Business \nBy Keith Speights \nIf at first you don't sell or spin off, try, try again. \nContinue Reading Below \nIn September, Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) announced that it had decided not to split its legacy drug business off from its higher-growth innovative health segment. Now Reuters has reported that the healthcare giant is considering either selling or spinning off its consumer healthcare business. My advice is this: Go for it, Pfizer. \nImage source: Getty Images. He Made 21,078% Buying Amazon. Heres His New Pick \nPfizer ultimately decided against spinning off the legacy essentials health business because the company's management thought staying together would be better for shareholders . The company must now go through the same thought process in determining whether or not to divest the consumer healthcare business. I think moving ahead would be good news for shareholders. \nBased onEuromonitor International's retail sales data, in 2015 Pfizer had the fourth-largest consumer healthcare business in the world. The company claimed two of the 10 biggest-selling global consumer brands with Centrum and Advil. According to Reuters, sources say that Pfizer believes the business could be worth up to $14 billion. \nContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT \nIn the first nine months of this year, Pfizer's consumer healthcare business generated sales of $2.46 billion. However, this reflected a slight decrease from sales in the prior-year period. Pfizer's shareholders need growth to drive the stock higher. Consumer healthcare isn't delivering that needed growth right now. \nMy view is that Pfizer could put the $14 billion or so that it has invested in its consumer healthcare business to better use. That amount coincidentally matches what the company paid to buy Medivation. Now, Medivation's Xtandi is one of Pfizer's key sources for future growth. Unlocking the money currently tied up in the consumer healthcare business could allow Pfizer to make more growth-oriented investments. Spin vs. sell \nMerck (NYSE: MRK) chose to sell its consumer healthcare business back in 2014 rather than spin off the unit as a separate company. The transaction provided over $14 billion to the big drugmaker, making more money available for later acquisitions of Cubist and Afferent Pharmaceuticals. \nWhile Merck hasn't been a stranger to spin-offs, the company chose to sell its consumer healthcare unit. Perhaps one key factor behind Merck's decision was that there was a willing buyer ready to fork over a lot of cash (namely, Bayer ). That could be a consideration for Pfizer, also. \nReckitt Benckiser Group PlcCEO Rakesh Kapoorpublicly stated in late 2015 that his company would be \"very interested\" in potentially buying Pfizer's consumer healthcare business should it become available. Kapoor's comments were made when Pfizer was in the midst of attempting to acquire Allergan . Although that deal ultimately fell through, Reckitt Benckiser could be a ready buyer should Pfizer look to sell. \nOf course, Pfizer will need to thoroughly examine all of the financial pros and cons of spinning off the consumer healthcare business versus selling. There can be tax advantages associated with spin-offs that outright sales don't enjoy. However, if Reckitt Benckiser or another party is primed to buy and offers the right price, a sale could be the better option for Pfizer. What will Pfizer do? \nI had hoped that Pfizer would spin off its established health business earlier this year. The company chose to do otherwise. Reuters reported that inside sources at Pfizer said the evaluation of next steps was in an early stage and that the company might decide to keep its consumer healthcare business. That's similar to language Pfizer used when deliberating about spinning off its established health business. \nAt this point, it's anyone's guess what Pfizer will do. I think, though, that parting ways with its consumer business might be more palatable than spinning off its legacy drugs unit. Selling to consumers requires a different business model and mindset than selling prescription drugs. That could tilt the decision more toward a sales or spin-off of the consumer healthcare business. \nMerck hasn't regretted its consumer healthcare sale. Pfizer wouldn't, either, in my opinion. I'll say it again: Go for it, Pfizer.Your shareholders deserve it. \nForget the 2016 Election: 10 stocks we like better than Pfizer Donald Trump was just elected president, and volatility is up. But here's why you should ignore the election: \nInvesting geniuses Tom and David Gardner have spent a long time beating the market no matter who's in the White House. In fact, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, Motley Fool Stock Advisor , has tripled the market.* \nDavid and Tom just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now... and Pfizer wasn't one of them!

      "text": "  Announces Tender Offer for Any and All of its 6.200% Senior Notes Due March 15, 2019 Pfizer Announces Tender Offer for Any and All of its 6.200% Senior Notes Due March 15, 2019 Monday, November 14, 2016 - 8:47am EST \nPfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) today announced the commencement of a tender offer (the “ Tender Offer ”) to purchase for cash any and all of its outstanding 6.200% Senior Notes due March 15, 2019 (the “ Notes ”). Certain information regarding the Notes and the pricing for the Tender Offer is set forth in the table below. \nHypothetical Tender Offer Consideration (1)(2) 6.200% Senior Notes due March 15, 2019 1.000% UST due November 15, 2019 (2) Hypothetical Tender Offer Consideration calculated on the basis of pricing for the U.S. Treasury Reference Security as of 2:00 p.m., New York City time, on November 10, 2016 and a Settlement Date (as defined below) on November 21, 2016. The actual Tender Offer Consideration (as defined below) payable pursuant to the Tender Offer will be calculated and determined as set forth in the offer to purchase, dated November 14, 2016 (the “ Offer to Purchase ”). The Tender Offer consists of an offer on the terms and conditions set forth in the Offer to Purchase, and the related letter of transmittal and notice of guaranteed delivery (as they may each be amended or supplemented from time to time, the “ Tender Offer Documents ”), to purchase for cash any and all of the Notes. The Company refers investors to the Tender Offer Documents for the complete terms and conditions of the Tender Offer. The Tender Offer will expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on November 18, 2016, unless extended or earlier terminated (such time and date, as the same may be extended, the “ Expiration Date ”). Holders of Notes must validly tender (including by notice of guaranteed delivery) and not validly withdraw their Notes prior to or at the Expiration Date to be eligible to receive the Tender Offer Consideration. Holders who validly tender their Notes, may validly withdraw their tendered Notes at any time prior to the earlier of (i) the Expiration Date, and (ii) if the Tender Offer is extended, the 10 th business day after commencement of the Tender Offer. Notes may also be validly withdrawn at any time after the 60 th business day after commencement of the Tender Offer if for any reason the Tender Offer has not been consummated within 60 business days after commencement of the Tender Offer. The “ Tender Offer Consideration ” for each $1,000 principal amount of Notes validly tendered and accepted for purchase pursuant to the Tender Offer will be determined in the manner described in the Tender Offer Documents by reference to a fixed spread specified for the Notes (the “ Fixed Spread ”) specified in the table above plus the yield based on the bid-side price of the U.S. Treasury Reference Security specified in the table above at 2:00 p.m., New York City time, on November 18, 2016, unless extended or earlier terminated. Holders will also receive accrued and unpaid interest on Notes validly tendered and accepted for purchase from the last interest payment date up to, but not including, the date the Company initially makes payment for such Notes, which date is anticipated to be November 21, 2016 (the “ Settlement Date ”). Notes tendered by notice of guaranteed delivery and accepted for purchase will be purchased on the third business day after the Expiration Date but payment of accrued interest on such Notes will only be made to, but not including, the Settlement Date. Pfizer intends to redeem any and all Notes that are not tendered and accepted in the Tender Offer in accordance with the terms of the make-whole provisions under the indenture governing the Notes. The Tender Offer is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions specified in the Tender Offer Documents, but the Tender Offer is not subject to minimum tender conditions.

      "text": "  to Collaborate with National Cancer Institute to Study Three Immunotherapy Agents Targeting Multiple Cancers Pfizer to Collaborate with National Cancer Institute to Study Three Immunotherapy Agents Targeting Multiple Cancers \nCooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) assesses OX40 agonist, utomilumab and avelumab immuno-oncology assets alone and in various combinations Monday, November 14, 2016 - 8:00am EST \n“We are looking forward to combining our expertise with those at the NCI to explore agents targeting the immune system in doublet and triplet combinations. Clinical studies focused on translational endpoints will allow us to optimally develop potential rational combinations.\" \nPfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) today announced that it has entered into a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with the National Cancer Institute (NCI), part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). As part of the CRADA, Pfizer will collaborate with NCI’s Center for Cancer Research (CCR) to arrange and conduct preclinical and clinical trials to evaluate three investigational immunotherapy agents. These include Pfizer’s proprietary immunotherapy agonistic monoclonal antibodies targeting OX40 (CD134), (also known as PF-04518600); and utomilumab, targeting 4-1BB (CD137), (also known as PF-05082566); as well as avelumab, a fully human anti-PD-L1 IgG1 monoclonal antibody (also known as PF-06834635 and MSB0010718C), which is being developed through an alliance between Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, and Pfizer. \nThe collaborative preclinical and clinical studies will be co-led by Dr. Jeffrey Schlom, chief of the Laboratory of Tumor Immunology and Biology at CCR, Dr. James Gulley, chief of the Genitourinary Malignancies Branch at CCR, and Dr. Chris Boshoff, Senior Vice President and Head of Immuno-oncology, Translational Oncology and Early Development, Pfizer Global Product Development. Under the CRADA, the three investigational immunotherapies will be studied alone, in various combinations with each other, and in combination with standard therapies, such as chemotherapy, radiation and targeted therapies across a range of cancers. \n“We are looking forward to combining our expertise with those at the NCI to explore agents targeting the immune system in doublet and triplet combinations. Clinical studies focused on translational endpoints will allow us to optimally develop potential rational combinations,” said Chris Boshoff. “The CRADA is an important collaboration for us as we seek to realize the full potential of immunotherapy and hope to ultimately transform the cancer treatment paradigm.” \nBeyond this collaboration, Pfizer is advancing these and other assets from its growing immuno-oncology portfolio with single agent and novel combination studies, both internally and through other collaborations. \nAbout Pfizer Oncology \nPfizer Oncology is committed to pursuing innovative treatments that have a meaningful impact on those living with cancer.

      "text": "Per $1,000 principal amount. (2) Hypothetical Tender Offer Consideration calculated on the basis of pricing for the U.S. Treasury Reference Security as of 2:00 p.m., New York City time, on November 10, 2016 and a Settlement Date (as defined below) on November 21, 2016. The actual Tender Offer Consideration (as defined below) payable pursuant to the Tender Offer will be calculated and determined as set forth in the offer to purchase, dated November 14, 2016 (the “ Offer to Purchase ”). \nThe Tender Offer consists of an offer on the terms and conditions set forth in the Offer to Purchase, and the related letter of transmittal and notice of guaranteed delivery (as they may each be amended or supplemented from time to time, the “ Tender Offer Documents ”), to purchase for cash any and all of the Notes. The Company refers investors to the Tender Offer Documents for the complete terms and conditions of the Tender Offer. \nThe Tender Offer will expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on November 18, 2016, unless extended or earlier terminated (such time and date, as the same may be extended, the “ Expiration Date ”). Holders of Notes must validly tender (including by notice of guaranteed delivery) and not validly withdraw their Notes prior to or at the Expiration Date to be eligible to receive the Tender Offer Consideration. \nHolders who validly tender their Notes, may validly withdraw their tendered Notes at any time prior to the earlier of (i) the Expiration Date, and (ii) if the Tender Offer is extended, the 10 th business day after commencement of the Tender Offer. Notes may also be validly withdrawn at any time after the 60 th business day after commencement of the Tender Offer if for any reason the Tender Offer has not been consummated within 60 business days after commencement of the Tender Offer. \nThe “ Tender Offer Consideration ” for each $1,000 principal amount of Notes validly tendered and accepted for purchase pursuant to the Tender Offer will be determined in the manner described in the Tender Offer Documents by reference to a fixed spread specified for the Notes (the “ Fixed Spread ”) specified in the table above plus the yield based on the bid-side price of the U.S. Treasury Reference Security specified in the table above at 2:00 p.m., New York City time, on November 18, 2016, unless extended or earlier terminated. \nHolders will also receive accrued and unpaid interest on Notes validly tendered and accepted for purchase from the last interest payment date up to, but not including, the date the Company initially makes payment for such Notes, which date is anticipated to be November 21, 2016 (the “ Settlement Date ”). Notes tendered by notice of guaranteed delivery and accepted for purchase will be purchased on the third business day after the Expiration Date but payment of accrued interest on such Notes will only be made to, but not including, the Settlement Date. \nPfizer intends to redeem any and all Notes that are not tendered and accepted in the Tender Offer in accordance with the terms of the make-whole provisions under the indenture governing the Notes. \nThe Tender Offer is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions specified in the Tender Offer Documents, but the Tender Offer is not subject to minimum tender conditions. \nInformation Relating to the Tender Offer \nThe Tender Offer Documents for the Notes are being distributed to holders beginning today. Citigroup Global Markets Inc. is the dealer manager for the Tender Offer. Investors with questions regarding the Tender Offer may contact Citigroup Global Markets Inc. at (800) 558-3745 (toll-free) or (212) 723-6106 (collect). Global Bondholder Services Corporation is the depositary and information agent for the Tender Offer and can be contacted at (866) 470-4300 (toll-free) or (212) 430-3774 (collect). \nNone of the Company or its affiliates, their respective boards of directors, the dealer manager, the depositary and information agent or the trustee with respect to the Notes is making any recommendation as to whether holders should tender any Notes in response to the Tender Offer, and neither the Company nor any such other person has authorized any person to make any such recommendation. Holders must make their own decision as to whether to tender any of their Notes, and, if so, the principal amount of Notes to tender. \nThis press release is for informational purposes only and is not an offer to buy, or the solicitation of an offer to sell, any of the Notes and the Tender Offer does not constitute an offer to buy or the solicitation of an offer to sell Notes in any jurisdiction or in any circumstances in which such offer or solicitation are unlawful. The full details of the Tender Offer, including complete instructions on how to tender Notes, are included in the Tender Offer Documents. Holders are strongly encouraged to read carefully the Tender Offer Documents, including materials incorporated by reference therein, because they will contain important information.

For more than 150 years, we have worked to make a difference for all who rely on us. \nForward-Looking Statements \nThis press release contains forward-looking statements made within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Such forward-looking statements involve substantial risks and uncertainties. We have tried, wherever possible, to identify such statements by using words such as “will,” “may,” “could,” “likely,” “ongoing,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “expect,” “project,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “target,” “forecast,” “goal,” “objective,” “aim” and other words and terms of similar meaning or by using future dates in connection with any discussion of, among other things, expectations regarding the completion of the notes offering and the use of proceeds. A list and description of risks, uncertainties and other matters can be found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 and in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly periods ended April 3, 2016, July 3, 2016 and October 2, 2016, in each case including in the sections thereof captioned “Forward-Looking Information and Factors That May Affect Future Results” and “Risk Factors,” in our Current Reports on Form 8-K, and in the prospectus supplement and accompanying prospectus, in each case including in the section thereof captioned “Risk Factors.” You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. Consequently, you should not consider any such list to be a complete set of all potential risks or uncertainties. \nWe cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be realized, although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions. Achievement of anticipated results is subject to substantial risks, uncertainties and inaccurate assumptions. Should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could vary materially from past results and those anticipated, estimated or projected. You should bear this in mind as you consider forward-looking statements, and you are cautioned not to put undue reliance on forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law or by the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). You are advised, however, to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our Form 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports and our other filings with the SEC.

Daniel Acker/Bloomberg via Getty Images hide caption \ntoggle caption Daniel Acker/Bloomberg via Getty Images Pfizer's Celebrex fared well in a safety study that compared the pain reliever with ibuprofen and naproxen.\nDaniel Acker/Bloomberg via Getty Images A large study has produced reassuring evidence about a drug that millions of people use to alleviate pain from arthritis and other ailments.\nThe study found no evidence that the drug Celebrex , or generically, celecoxib, poses any greater risk for causing heart attacks and strokes than two other widely used pain relievers.\n\"What we found was surprising,\" says Steven Nissen , a cardiologist at the Cleveland Clinic who reported the results Sunday at an American Heart Association meeting in New Orleans.\nDoctors have been concerned about Celebrex for more than a decade because it is very similar to another pain reliever, Vioxx , which was pulled from the market in 2004 after being linked to heart attacks and strokes.\nCelebrex \"didn't share the risks that were seen with Vioxx,\" says Nissen, whose findings were also published online by the New England Journal of Medicine .\nNissen and other heart specialists cautioned that Celebrex can increase the chance of cardiovascular complications. But it doesn't appear to boost those odds nearly as much as Vioxx, or even as much as other painkillers thought to be safer. Both Vioxx and Celebrex are so-called Cox-2 inhibitors, which act by blocking an enzyme involved in inflammation.\nArticle continues after sponsorship Moreover, the study suggests Celebrex may be less risky than other so-called nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs , in other ways. For example, Celebrex appears to pose less of a risk of causing kidney problems.\n\"It is very reassuring,\" says Milton Packer , a cardiologist at Baylor University who was not involved in the study. \"I think what we'll see is a greater confidence in the use of drugs like Celebrex. I think people will turn to it now more frequently.\"\nBut others cautioned that all the drugs tested remain risky, especially for people with heart disease. \"It's reassuring that it's not as bad as Vioxx, but it's not a recommendation to take the medication,\" says Dr. Mary Norine Walsh , the president-elect of the American College of Cardiology.\nAfter Vioxx came on the market in 1999, it quickly became a blockbuster used by millions of people because it was designed to cause fewer gastrointestinal complications than existing NSAIDs.\nThe Food and Drug Administration allowed continued sales of Celebrex even though it was very similar. But the agency ordered Pfizer Inc ., the company marketing Celebrex, to study the drug's safety. In 2005, however, Pfizer withdrew Bextra, another Cox-2 inhibitor, at the FDA's request.\nCelebrex is used by an estimated 2 million Americans each year for arthritis, menstrual cramps and other aches and pains.\nThe new study involved 24,081 patients with osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis. One-third of the patients took Celebrex. One-third took prescription doses of ibuprofen. The remaining third took prescription naproxen.\nIbuprofen is sold over the counter in much lower doses as a generic and under a variety of brand names, including Advil and Motrin. Naproxen, also generic, is sold over the counter with various names, like Aleve and Naprosyn.\nHigher, prescription doses of ibuprofen and naproxen were more likely than Celebrex to cause digestive system problems, such as ulcers and bleeding, the researchers found.\nSpecifically, naproxen had a 1.5 percent risk of gastrointestinal complications, ibuprofen had a 1.6 percent risk, and Celebrex had a 1.1 percent risk in a 30-month period.\nThat wasn't a surprise. Celebrex and Vioxx were designed to be easier on the digestive system than the existing NSAIDs. But some other risks were surprising, Nissen says.\nCompared with Celebrex, patients taking ibuprofen were more likely to experience kidney problems, including kidney failure and the need for dialysis.\nSpecifically, there was a 1.1 percent risk of kidney complications among those taking ibuprofen for 30 months, versus a 0.7 percent risk among those taking Celebrex and a 0.9 percent risk among those taking naproxen, the researchers report.\nAll these drugs are known to carry some risks to kidney function, but the risk from ibuprofen was higher than expected, Nissen says.\nThere was also a hint that naproxen and ibuprofen may pose more of a risk of causing cardiovascular complications that Celebrex. Nissen stresses, however, that that finding was only borderline-statistically significant for ibuprofen.\nIn addition, there was an even weaker hint that naproxen might increase the risk for death for any reason, compared with Celebrex. But that wasn't statistically significant either.\nIt means those risks could have been statistical flukes. But they do warrant further investigation, he says.\n\"What is so surprising about it is that most authorities have believed that if there was a drug that was the safest, it was naproxen,\" Nissen says. \"So we were pretty surprised that there was this borderline significant increase in all-cause mortality with naproxen.\"\nCelebrex turned out to be the least likely of the three drugs to increase the risk for cardiovascular complications. The risk of dying, suffering a stroke or having a heart attack among patients taking Celebrex was 2.3 percent during a 30-month period, compared to 2.5 percent for naproxen and 2.7 percent for ibuprofen.\nNissen stresses that all the patients in the study took doses of these drugs available in the prescription formulation — not the much lower doses most people take when they buy them without a prescription and use them occasionally.\nThe maximum recommended over-the-counter dose of ibuprofen is typically 1,200 milligrams daily. The study used 600 milligrams of ibuprofen three times a day, or 1,800 milligrams daily. Naproxen tablets are sold over the counter at a dose of 220 milligrams, and are taken twice a day. The study used doses between 375 and 500 milligrams taken twice a day.\n\"I don't want the public to think that if you take an occasional ibuprofen or naproxen that you're going to have kidney failure or you're going to die,\" Nissen says. \"We didn't study that. We studied daily doses in arthritis patients [taking] ... high doses of these drugs.\"\nBut the findings should encourage people who need pain relief to take the lowest dose of the drugs for the shortest time possible.\n\"If you twist your knee and you hurt, I want people to take medicines for pain relief,\" Nissen says. \"But when they're better, try to get off the drugs and not take them every day and not take them in very high doses.\"\nOther doctors agreed.\n\"There's probably a risk of all of these drugs, especially at high doses,\" Packer says. \"The question is: If you need these drugs for pain, which is the safest? Right now, based on this study, it appears Celebrex has advantages.\"\nSeveral experts pointed out that the study has some flaws. The dose of Celebrex tested was relatively low, for example, and a significant number of subjects dropped out of the study, which raises questions about the reliability of the findings.",

      "text": "MSF welcomes Pfizer's pneumonia vaccine price reduction for children in humanitarian emergencies Report from Médecins Sans Frontières Published on 14 Nov 2016 — View Original \nNEW YORK, 14 November 2016 – MSF welcomes Pfizer's decision to lower the price of its pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) for children caught in humanitarian emergencies. For seven years, MSF urged Pfizer and GSK – the only two manufacturers producing the pneumonia vaccine – to offer the lowest global price to humanitarian organisations, but they refused until September, when GSK announced that it was finally reducing the price of its pneumonia vaccine for humanitarian situations. Now with its announcement on Friday, Pfizer is following in GSK's footsteps. \n\"It’s good to see that Pfizer is now finally reducing the price of its life-saving vaccine for children in emergencies,\" says Dr Joanne Liu, MSF's international president. \"With Pfizer and GSK's price reductions, humanitarian organisations will be better able to protect children against this deadly disease.\" \nPneumonia is the leading cause of child mortality worldwide, killing nearly one million children every year. Crisis-affected children, such as those caught up in conflict or in humanitarian emergencies, are particularly susceptible to pneumonia. MSF medical teams often see the deadly effects of pneumonia – a vaccine-preventable disease – in the vulnerable children treated in our health facilities. \nThe price reductions are a significant step forward in protecting vulnerable children who are reached by humanitarian organisations like MSF. From 2009 to 2014, MSF conducted negotiations with Pfizer and GSK to access a fair and sustainable price for the pneumonia vaccine, before making a notable exception to our policy governing donations from pharmaceutical companies. In agreeing to the limited-term donations, both Pfizer and GSK assured MSF that they would work on a longer-term solution to improve affordability. Since then, in absence of such a solution, MSF   organisations struggled to purchase pneumonia vaccines at an affordable price; earlier this year, MSF paid 60 euros (US$68.10) for one dose of the Pfizer product to vaccinate refugee children in Greece – 20 times more than the lowest price offered by GSK and Pfizer. \nOne third of the world's countries have not been able to introduce PCV because of its high price. Millions of children living in countries such as Jordan, Thailand and the Philippines are left out. In 2015, all 193 countries at the World Health Assembly passed a landmark resolution demanding more affordable vaccines and increased transparency of vaccine prices. \"Both Pfizer and GSK should now redouble their efforts to reduce the price of the vaccine for the many developing countries that still can't afford to protect their children against pneumonia,\" said Dr Liu. \nPfizer's announcement on Friday indicated that the price reduction was a new and specific pricing tier for civil society organisations (CSOs) including MSF. We now hope that Pfizer will extend its price reduction efforts to all developing countries and accelerate the registration process to rapidly increase access to the pneumonia vaccine for all who need it.

      "text": "Pfizer's Celebrex no riskier than competing painkillers, study finds Written by Mackenzie Bean | November 15, 2016 | Print | Email \nA new study published in the New England Journal of Medicine recently dispelled a popular belief that Pfizer's pain medication Celebrex is more risky for patients than rival drugs like ibuprofen or naproxen. \nThe 24,000-patient study of arthritis drugs showed individuals assigned to take Celebrex experienced fewer heart-related deaths, heart attacks and strokes than those taking ibuprofen or naproxen, according to The Wall Street Journal . \nCelebrex, ibuprofen and naproxen represent three of the more than two dozen available medicines known as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Controversy over the safety of Celebrex developed in 2004 when Kenilworth, N.J.-based Merck pulled its drug Vioxx off the market after a study linked theNSAID drug to an increased risk of heart attack. \nWhile Pfizer was forced to remove a similar type of drug from the market, the Food and Drug Administration allowed the New York City-based drugmaker to continue marketing Celebrex as long as it conducted a study of the drug's effect on heart risk, according to the report. \nAfter more than 10 years, the study's results show \"exactly opposite of what everybody thought it would be,\" said Steven Nissen, MD, chief of cardiovascular medicine at the Cleveland Clinic and lead investigator of the study, reported WSJ. \nDespite the study's findings, Dr. Nissen reminded patients any NSAID can harm a patient's heart and said, \"Take the lowest dose you can for the shortest time you can.\" More articles on infection control and clinical quality:",

      "title": "Pfizer's Celebrex as Safe as Ibuprofen, Naproxen: Study",
      "text": "Pfizer’s Celebrex arthritis drug was shown to be at least as safe as the widely used prescription-strength versions of painkillers ibuprofen and naproxen, and does not appear to cause heart problems that spurred the withdrawal of rival Vioxx, according to a large 10-year study presented on Sunday.\nThe study of arthritis sufferers is likely to raise eyebrows, given long-held concerns about Celebrex. Some 100 million prescriptions were written in the United States in 2013 alone for the type of painkiller known as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDS, to which all three drugs belong.\nCelebrex, or celecoxib, belongs to a class of NSAID called Cox-2 inhibitors that were designed to prevent gastrointestinal bleeding common with many NSAIDs.\nThe primary goal of the 24,000-patient trial was to demonstrate that Celebrex did not cause an increased risk of serious heart problems compared with the other two drugs. The main measures of heart attack, stroke or death occurred between 2% and 3% of patients for all three medicines, a statistically significant result for non-inferiority.\n“I think it’s incontrovertible that celecoxib is not worse than these older NSAIDS,” said Dr. Steven Nissen, the study’s lead investigator.\nU.S. regulators ordered the study after pulling Merck & Co’s blockbuster pain drug Vioxx from the market for causing heart attacks and deaths, leading many in the medical community to assume that the entire class of Cox-2 inhibitors was similarly tainted.\nMerck at one point offered the theory that naproxen, to which Vioxx was compared in studies, protected the heart.\n“Everybody thought: ‘Oh, naproxen is the safest; Celebrex is probably like Vioxx,'” said Nissen, chief of cardiology at the Cleveland Clinic, who presented the data at the American Heart Association’s scientific meeting in New Orleans. “Everybody thought they knew the answer, and the entire world was wrong.”\nAnnual sales of Celebrex, which is now off patent, have declined to about $775 million for Pfizer . The drug is available as a generic from many companies, including Mylan NV and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.\nCelebrex sales were about $3 billion in 2014 and could have been far higher but for safety concerns. In 2005, U.S. regulators ordered Pfizer to withdraw another Cox-2 pain drug, Bextra, over a host of safety issues and added a safety warning to the Celebrex label.\nNaproxen is the active ingredient in Bayer AG’s Aleve, while ibuprofen is the main component of Pfizer’s Advil.\nThe older drugs in the study were taken at higher doses and for far longer than the recommendations for the over-the-counter versions. Researchers stressed that safety issues seen in the study should not lead to conclusions about occasional use of the OTC products.\nCardiology researchers also said it was unclear how these results might affect prescribing habits of the primary care doctors who most often treat arthritis patients.\nPatients in the study took the drugs for 20 months on average and were followed for another 14 months. But 27% of those enrolled dropped out. Researchers said many chronic pain patients seek additional or alternative therapy.\nOn some secondary measures of the study, Celebrex actually fared better. Death for any reason was 25% higher with naproxen than Celebrex, although that did not quite reach statistical significance, while kidney problems were 64% higher with ibuprofen than Celebrex.\n“I was completely surprised at the excess of renal toxicity with ibuprofen,” Nissen said.\nThere was also a significant excess of gastrointestinal problems with ibuprofen and naproxen, such as severe anemia likely due to internal bleeding.\nDr. Elliott Antman, a past AHA president who critiqued the study, noted several limitations, including that those taking ibuprofen or naproxen were allowed to increase their dosage but not the Celebrex group. He called for a much more detailed analysis of the data.\nDr. Clyde Yancy, another past AHA president who also was not involved in the study, cited a need for better drugs.\n“Clearly we need an additional therapeutic option for patients who have known cardiovascular disease and a chronic pain syndrome,” he said. Available therapies have enough limitations “that we’re not where we need to be.”",

      "text": "Should You Keep an Eye on Pfizer in 2016 and Beyond? PART 2 OF 5 Analysts’ Recommendations for Pfizer and Its Peers in 2016 By Margaret Patrick | Nov 14, 2016 4:25 pm EST Analysts’ recommendations for Pfizer \nBased on the recommendations of 27 brokerages in a Bloomberg survey, 50.0% of analysts gave Pfizer ( PFE ) “buy” recommendations, and 50.0% of analysts gave it “holds.” No analysts rated Pfizer as a “sell.” \nThe discontinuation of the bococizumab research program affected overall investor confidence. However, Pfizer’s Innovative Health segment has consistently been reporting strong revenue growth in 2016, mainly due to the robust performance of its major drugs Ibrance, Lyrica, Chantix, and Xeljanz in the United States as well as the performance of Eliquis across the world. \nIbrance has managed to become a leader in the first-line hormone receptor positive (or HR+) and human epidermal growth factor negative (or HER-) markets. While its rate of new market share growth has gradually fallen, total prescriptions for Ibrance have continued to rise. Pfizer is also actively involved in reaching out to metastatic breast cancer patients who are currently on chemotherapy or hormone therapy. \nThe consensus 12-month target price for Pfizer is ~$37.75, a rise of 25.8% from the stock’s price of $30.00 on November 4, 2016. If Pfizer’s share price manages to reach this price target, it could boost the Health Care Select Sector SPDR ETF ( XLV ). Pfizer accounts for ~7.3% of XLV’s total portfolio. Peer companies \nBased on a Bloomberg survey of nine brokerages, Novartis ( NVS ) received “buy” recommendations from 62.5% of analysts and “hold” recommendations from 37.5% of analysts. The consensus 12-month target price for Novartis is ~$91.4—a rise of 30.1% from the stock’s price of $70.25 on November 4, 2016. \nAmong the 28 brokerages surveyed by Bloomberg for Eli Lilly ( LLY ), 80.8% of analysts gave it “buy” recommendations, while 19.2% gave it “hold” recommendations. The consensus 12-month target price for Eli Lilly is ~$97.25, a rise of 34.2% from its price of $72.49 on November 4. \nBased on a Bloomberg survey of 27 brokerages, Merck & Co. ( MRK ) received “buy” recommendations from 54.2% of analysts and “hold” recommendations from 45.8% of analysts. The consensus 12-month target price for Merck is ~$68.9, a rise of 17.1% from its closing price of $58.82 on November 4. \nIn the next article, we’ll explore growth prospects for Pfizer’s Ibrance in further detail.

      "text": "November 14, 2016 at 19:00 PM EST Pfizer Lowers Cost of Prevnar 13 Pfizer announced Friday that it would lower the cost of Prevnar 13, its blockbuster pneumococcal vaccine, for humanitarian organizations like Doctors Without Borders. The post Pfizer Lowers Cost of Prevnar 13 appeared first on Investing News Network . \nIn late October, Doctors Without Borders rejected Pfizer’s (NYSE: PFE ) offer of one million free pneumonia vaccines . “Donations of medical products … are not the answer to increasingly high vaccine prices charged by pharmaceutical giants,” Jason Cone, executive director of the humanitarian organization, explained . “I hope to hear soon … that Pfizer is reducing the price of the vaccine for the millions of children who still need it.” \nOn November 11, 2016, Cone received that news. \nPfizer announced Friday that it would lower the cost of Prevnar 13, its blockbuster pneumococcal vaccine, for humanitarian organizations like Doctors Without Borders. Pneumonia remains the world’s deadliest childhood disease, killing close to one million kids each year. According to the World Health Organization, \"the pharmaceutical industry is expected to go from $300billion to $400billion within the next 3 years.\" Click here to download a FREE INN Insider’s Report on the best investment opportunities, trends and strategies for pharmaceutical investing. \nThe vaccine, which is only manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE: GSK , LON:GSK) and Pfizer, has historically been too costly for most developing nations to afford, or for humanitarian organizations to distribute. For years, said groups have lobbied pharmaceutical companies requesting price reductions—and in response, they’ve received donations of free vaccines instead. \nBut as Cone explained in October, donations like these can work as a justification for high prices overall and come with strings attached—strings that can severely impact a humanitarian organization’s ability to provide aid. \nDoctors Without Borders rejected Pfizer’s latest donation, instead calling on CEO Ian Read to reduce the vaccine’s cost. In response, the pharmaceutical giant has announced it will sell Prevnar 13 for $3.10 per dose —”the lowest prevailing global price.” Pfizer has further pledged to donate all proceeds from these sales to humanitarian groups. \nThe move is welcomed by the world’s vulnerable populations and aid organizations, but investors may have some questions: after all, Prevnar 13 has been one of Pfizer’s top-sellers for years. In 2015, it singlehandedly grew Pfizer’s vaccine division’s revenues by 44 percent. \nHow will the price reduction impact returns? \nAs it turns out, Prevnar 13 may not be a top-seller for much longer—even without the price reduction. Third quarter results showed sales from the vaccine are down three percent year-over-year. There was also a 16 percent drop in its revenues for Q2. While still a major earner, Prevnar 13 no longer drives Pfizer’s vaccine business growth. \nAs FiercePharma notes , “Prevnar has been a victim of its own success. Because of a ‘high initial capture rate’ in adults after 2014 … the company is suffering from an ‘expected decline.’” \nThat suggests the price reduction—which is only offered to humanitarian organizations—may have minimal impact, at least in terms of revenue. The positive press, on the other hand, could serve Pfizer’s business well. In a year when pharmaceutical companies have been decried for their pricing strategies , Pfizer’s move may win back some public opinion. \nDon’t forget to follow us @INN_LifeScience for real-time news updates. \nSecurities Disclosure: I, Chelsea Pratt, hold no direct investment interest in any company mentioned in this article.",

The post Pfizer Announces Tender Offer for Any and All of its 6.200% Senior Notes Due March 15, 2019 appeared first on Investing News Network . \nPFIZER ANNOUNCES TENDER OFFER FOR ANY AND ALL OF ITS 6.200% SENIOR \nNOTES DUE MARCH 15, 2019 \nPfizer Inc. ( NYSE:PFE ) today announced the commencement of a tender offer (the “ Tender Offer ”) to purchase for cash any and all of its outstanding 6.200% Senior Notes due March 15, 2019 (the “ Notes ”). Certain information regarding the Notes and the pricing for the Tender Offer is set forth in the table below.

We have tried, wherever possible, to identify such statements by using words such as “will,” “may,” “could,” “likely,” “ongoing,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “expect,” “project,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “target,” “forecast,” “goal,” “objective,” “aim” and other words and terms of similar meaning or by using future dates in connection with any discussion of, among other things, expectations regarding the completion of the Tender Offer. A list and description of risks, uncertainties and other matters can be found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 and in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarterly periods ended April 3, 2016, July 3, 2016 and October 2, 2016, in each case including in the sections thereof captioned “Forward-Looking Information and Factors That May Affect Future Results” and “Risk Factors,” in our Current Reports on Form 8-K, and in the prospectus supplement and accompanying prospectus, in each case including in the section thereof captioned “Risk Factors.” You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. Consequently, you should not consider any such list to be a complete set of all potential risks or uncertainties. \nWe cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be realized, although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions. Achievement of anticipated results is subject to substantial risks, uncertainties and inaccurate assumptions. Should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could vary materially from past results and those anticipated, estimated or projected. You should bear this in mind as you consider forward-looking statements, and you are cautioned not to put undue reliance on forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law or by the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).

      "text": "To promote its product Prevnar 13®, a vaccine to help prevent pneumonia, Pfizer has taken a tongue-in-cheek approach to reach target customers aged 50 or above with their new campaign.\nTeaming up with its creative agency Secret Tour Hong Kong, the pharmaceutical company first took the iconic Hong Kong classic from the 70s, The House of 72 Tenants(七十二家房客), with the original owner's permission, and recreated two trailers with brand messages embedded. At the end of the video, a telephone number is provided for registration for a free movie screening of the original movie to be held on 18 December.\nThe first trailer was released last week on Apple Daily's website and went viral with over 150k views in three days. Some 100 people have registered for the movie screening.\nThe campaign also spans across other social platforms and billboards at Sunbeam Theatre, which shows Cantonese opera.\n(Gallery available on web )\nWhile many seem to think senior people don't \"get\" social, Stephen Chung, creative partner of Secret Tour Hong Kong explained senior citizens are the fastest-growing demographic, and this campaign aims to test if the message could get across on purpose. \"As we can see that many elderly people are using WeChat or WhatsApp, I think we can try to engage them on digital platforms.\"\nThe video also looks to start a new wave for Hong Kong derivative works. While the local creative industry has started to recreate classic works of the olden times by mimicking the tone, costumes and dialogues, some copyright owners regard such acts as a violation of copyright laws and disrespect of original work. \"This campaign demonstrate a success of balancing the interests of both parties with maximum effectiveness to arouse audience’ attention.\"\nCredits \nClient: Pfizer\nAgency: Secret Tour Hong Kong\nCreative director: Jennifer Yip, Stephen Chung\nAssociate account director: Sammi Chan\nAssociate creative director: Shana Choi\nCopywriter: Fizen Yuen, Jay Ng\nArt director: Klif Lin\nAccount executive: Wengi Wong\nVideo editor: Nathan Sham",

      "text": "Pfizer Inc. ( PFE - Free Report ) announced that it has struck a research and development agreement with the National Cancer Institute (NCI) to study three immunotherapy agents targeting multiple cancers.\nThe three immunotherapy agents include Pfizer’s proprietary immunotherapy agonistic monoclonal antibodies targeting OX40, utomilumab targeting 4-1BB, and avelumab an experimental anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody being developed in collaboration with Merck KGaA . These immuno-oncology assets will be studied alone as well as in various combinations.\nThe deal is in sync with Pfizer’s efforts to strengthen its immuno-oncology pipeline. The basic concept of immuno-oncology is to utilize certain parts of the immune system to fight the disease. This can be done by stimulating the immune system to attack cancer cells or by introducing immune system components into the body. While some immuno-oncology treatments have the potential to be effective as monotherapies, others may be more effective when combined with other treatments.\nPFIZER INC Price and Consensus\nPFIZER INC Price and Consensus | PFIZER INC Quote:\nPfizer enjoys a strong cancer franchise which currently consists of products like Ibrance, Xalkori and Sutent. The September acquisition of cancer-focused biopharma company Medivation added the latter’s prostate cancer treatment, Xtandi, to Pfizer’s portfolio.

( PFE ) said that new results from the Phase 3 Oral Psoriatic Arthritis TriaL (OPAL) studies, Broaden and Beyond, will be presented at the 2016 ACR/ARHP Annual Meeting from November 11 to 16 in Washington, DC. \nOPAL Broaden and OPAL Beyond evaluated the efficacy and safety of Xeljanz, or tofacitinib citrate, in adult patients with active psoriatic arthritis or PsA who had an inadequate response (IR) to conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs or to tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, respectively. \nPfizer noted that OPAL Broaden and OPAL Beyond met their primary efficacy endpoints, showing a statistically significant improvement with tofacitinib 5 mg and 10 mg twice daily compared to treatment with placebo at three months as measured by American College of Rheumatology 20 (ACR20) response. \nOPAL Beyond focused exclusively on the TNFi-IR patient population. In both studies, patients who were initially randomized to placebo advanced to tofacitinib 5 or 10 mg BID in a blinded manner at three months. \nMichael Corbo, Chief Development Officer, Inflammation & Immunology, Pfizer Global Product Development said, \"As the only JAK inhibitor being investigated in psoriatic arthritis, tofacitinib, if approved, would provide patients and healthcare professionals the first medicine in a new class to treat this disease. We continue to progress the OPAL clinical development program globally and look forward to possible future regulatory filings.\" \nFor comments and feedback: contact",

      "text": "Pfizer and NCI Ink Research Deal Targeting Multiple Cancers by Zacks Equity Research Published on November 15, 2016 Trades from $ 3 Pfizer Inc. ( PFE - Free Report ) announced that it has struck a research and development agreement with the National Cancer Institute (NCI) to study three immunotherapy agents targeting multiple cancers. The three immunotherapy agents include Pfizer’s proprietary immunotherapy agonistic monoclonal antibodies targeting OX40, utomilumab targeting 4-1BB, and avelumab an experimental anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody being developed in collaboration with Merck KGaA . These immuno-oncology assets will be studied alone as well as in various combinations. The deal is in sync with Pfizer’s efforts to strengthen its immuno-oncology pipeline. The basic concept of immuno-oncology is to utilize certain parts of the immune system to fight the disease. This can be done by stimulating the immune system to attack cancer cells or by introducing immune system components into the body. While some immuno-oncology treatments have the potential to be effective as monotherapies, others may be more effective when combined with other treatments. \nPFIZER INC Price and Consensus \n\nPFIZER INC Price and Consensus | PFIZER INC Quote \nPfizer enjoys a strong cancer franchise which currently consists of products like Ibrance, Xalkori and Sutent. The September acquisition of cancer-focused biopharma company Medivation added the latter’s prostate cancer treatment, Xtandi, to Pfizer’s portfolio. Cancer is the second-leading cause of death in the U.S. and a “Top 10” killer worldwide. In a separate press release, Pfizer announced a tender offer to purchase for cash any and all of its outstanding 6.200% senior notes due March 15, 2019.
