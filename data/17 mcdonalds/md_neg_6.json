      "text": "Are you human?   \nNEW YORK — McDonald's wants to makes its fast-food outlets feel more like restaurants, with plans to eventually expand table service across its U.S. locations. \nThe world's biggest burger chain says it has been testing the service at about 500 of its more than 14,000 domestic stores. Customers in those stores order at the counter or at kiosks and sit down and wait for an employee bring out their food, a change that McDonald's says improves customer satisfaction. \nMcDonald's says it will expand the offering in Boston, Chicago, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, D.C., early next year. Bringing the change to all its stores could take years, as it would require franchisees to invest in remodeling and more training for employees. \nThe push to offer table service like some fast-casual chains do comes as McDonald's tries to stage a comeback after losing customers in recent years, with executives conceding they failed to keep up with changing tastes. Despite a string of announcements intended to drum up excitement — including the introduction of an all-day breakfast menu — customer visits in the U.S. have not increased, the company said. \nCEO Steve Easterbrook said going to McDonald's is supposed to be fun, but \"the initial stages of it can be quite stressful.\" He noted that customers are becoming more demanding, and the company is working on making visits to its restaurants more convenient. Next year, the company also plans to introduce a mobile order and pay option. \nEven though McDonald's Corp. gets a majority of its sales at the drive-thru in the U.S., the company hopes having table service in restaurants helps improve people's perceptions about the overall experience. Table service and kiosks have already been introduced in other parts of the world, including in the United Kingdom. \nThe kiosks are also intended to give customers greater flexibility in customizing their orders with different buns and toppings for burgers, while reducing the chances for inaccurate orders. McDonald's has said it is working on reducing inaccurate orders, such as by asking employees to repeat orders back to customers at the drive-thru. \nIn stores that are remodeled to have the kiosks and table service, the company said it will also be more prominently featuring its McCafe drinks and baked goods. Those are intended to go after the growing snacking habit. Easterbrook said that the traditional three meals are making up less of the opportunity for growth. \n ",

People in those stores order at the counter or kiosks, then sit and wait for an employee to bring them their food. \nEarly next year, McDonald’s says it will expand the offering in Boston, Chicago, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, D.C. \nThe push comes as McDonald’s tries to stage a comeback after losing customers in recent years, with executives conceding they failed to keep up with changing tastes.

      "text": "You deserve a seat today: McDonald’s expanding table service 11/17/16 3:43 PM \nNEW YORK — McDonald’s wants to makes its fast-food outlets feel more like restaurants, with plans to eventually expand table service across its U.S. locations. \nThe world’s biggest burger chain says it has been testing the service at about 500 of its more than 14,000 domestic stores. Customers in those stores order at the counter or at kiosks and sit down and wait for an employee bring out their food, a change that McDonald’s says improves customer satisfaction. \nMcDonald’s says it will expand the offering in Boston, Chicago, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, D.C., early next year. Bringing the change to all its stores could take years, as it would require franchisees to invest in remodeling and more training for employees. \nThe push to offer table service like some fast-casual chains do comes as McDonald’s tries to stage a comeback after losing customers in recent years, with executives conceding they failed to keep up with changing tastes. Despite a string of announcements intended to drum up excitement — including the introduction of an all-day breakfast menu — customer visits in the U.S. have not increased, the company said. \nCEO Steve Easterbrook said going to McDonald’s is supposed to be fun, but “the initial stages of it can be quite stressful.” He noted that customers are becoming more demanding, and the company is working on making visits to its restaurants more convenient. Next year, the company also plans to introduce a mobile order and pay option. \nEven though McDonald’s Corp. gets a majority of its sales at the drive-thru in the U.S., the company hopes having table service in restaurants helps improve people’s perceptions about the overall experience. Table service and kiosks have already been introduced in other parts of the world, including in the United Kingdom. \nThe kiosks are also intended to give customers greater flexibility in customizing their orders with different buns and toppings for burgers, while reducing the chances for inaccurate orders. McDonald’s has said it is working on reducing inaccurate orders, such as by asking employees to repeat orders back to customers at the drive-thru. \nIn stores that are remodeled to have the kiosks and table service, the company said it will also be more prominently featuring its McCafe drinks and baked goods. Those are intended to go after the growing snacking habit. Easterbrook said that the traditional three meals are making up less of the opportunity for growth.",

      "text": "McDonald's Corp. plans to offer table service at all its U.S. restaurants, upending decades of fast-food tradition in a bid to placate pickier customers. Table service is currently in about 500 locations, but will be rolled out to the entire U.S. chain, McDonald's said Thursday at an event in New York. The company also is bringing mobile ordering and payments to the country in 2017, as well as more digital kiosks.\nMcDonald's already has table service at some locations in New York, Florida and Southern California, as well as many places abroad. It's coming soon to markets such as Boston and San Francisco, the company said. New positions will be created at restaurants to serve food and help customers with touch-screen orders.\nThe shift is significant for a company most responsible for popularizing fast food -- along with a more stripped-down approach to restaurant service. But competition and the rise of fast-casual chains have elevated expectations. Customers also are looking to technology to help make restaurants more convenient.\n\"Customers are getting increasingly demanding, and their expectations will only grow,\" Chief Executive Officer Steve Easterbrook said at the event.\nA drop in the cost of groceries has added pressure to fast-food chains this year because it's increasingly cheap for customers to eat at home. Restaurant companies also have blamed anxiety around the presidential election for hurting results. McDonald's shares are up just about 1 per cent in 2016, lagging behind the 7 percent increase for the Standard & Poor's 500 Index.\nThe new approach may bring in the kind of customers who balk at lines, said Ivan Feinseth, analyst at Tigress Financial Partners.\n\"It will make it look less congested at the point of ordering,\" he said. \"Then people feel they won't have to wait that long.\"\nEarlier this month, the world's biggest restaurant chain said it was planning a \"significant\" boost in technology spending. The investment will help fund the new self-serve kiosks and mobile-ordering application. The plan includes expanding a smartphone ordering app across its 14,000 domestic locations, starting next year.\nMcDonald's had fallen behind competitors in technology. Dunkin' Donuts and Taco Bell already allow diners to order via smartphones, and Starbucks Corp. boasts millions of active rewards members. McDonald's, based in Oak Brook, Illinois, is looking to grab some of those consumers with its own faster and more convenient service.\nFor 60 years, McDonald's dictated how customers ordered and got food, Easterbrook said.\n\"That's changing now,\" he said. \"It's a totally different mindset.\"\nBloomberg",

      "text": "Share Tweet \nNEW YORK (AP) — McDonald's wants to makes its fast-food outlets feel more like restaurants, with plans to eventually expand table service across its U.S. locations. \nThe world's biggest burger chain says it has been testing the service at about 500 of its more than 14,000 domestic stores. Customers in those stores order at the counter or at kiosks and sit down and wait for an employee bring out their food, a change that McDonald's says improves customer satisfaction. \nMcDonald's says it will expand the offering in Boston, Chicago, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, D.C., early next year. Bringing the change to all its stores could take years, as it would require franchisees to invest in remodeling and more training for employees. \nThe push to offer table service like some fast-casual chains do comes as McDonald's tries to stage a comeback after losing customers in recent years, with executives conceding they failed to keep up with changing tastes. Despite a string of announcements intended to drum up excitement — including the introduction of an all-day breakfast menu — customer visits in the U.S. have not increased, the company said. \nCEO Steve Easterbrook said going to McDonald's is supposed to be fun, but \"the initial stages of it can be quite stressful.\" He noted that customers are becoming more demanding, and the company is working on making visits to its restaurants more convenient. Next year, the company also plans to introduce a mobile order and pay option. \nEven though McDonald's Corp. gets a majority of its sales at the drive-thru in the U.S., the company hopes having table service in restaurants helps improve people's perceptions about the overall experience. Table service and kiosks have already been introduced in other parts of the world, including in the United Kingdom. \nThe kiosks are also intended to give customers greater flexibility in customizing their orders with different buns and toppings for burgers, while reducing the chances for inaccurate orders. McDonald's has said it is working on reducing inaccurate orders, such as by asking employees to repeat orders back to customers at the drive-thru. \nIn stores that are remodeled to have the kiosks and table service, the company said it will also be more prominently featuring its McCafe drinks and baked goods. Those are intended to go after the growing snacking habit. Easterbrook said that the traditional three meals are making up less of the opportunity for growth.",

      "text": "Hollis Johnson \nMcDonald's announced on Thursday that the fast-food giant plans to roll out table service at all locations across the US. \nThe fast-food giant has begun the process of implementing table service across all 14,000 American locations. With the new system, customers can place orders using a digital kiosk or at the counter, and then choose to either pick up their food to-go or have meals served to them at tables. \n\"For the best part of our 16 years, we've asked customers to work around our business model,\" CEO Steve Easterbrook said in a media event on Thursday. \"But now, customers are more demanding, and we're looking to evolve our business.\" \nCurrently, McDonald's offers table service in more than 500 US locations in New York City, Florida, and Southern California. The company is rolling out table service in Washington DC, Boston, Chicago, San Francisco, and Seattle in early 2017.\nBeyond that, McDonald's does not have a set timeline for the roll out, though McDonald's incoming US president Chris Kempczinski said the chain plans to move as \"quickly as possible\" after collecting data from test markets.\nGlobally, the fast-food chain offers the service in 2,600 locations, in countries including Canada, France, and China. \nHollis Johnson \nIn test markets, McDonald's executives said that table service has been particularly popular with large groups and families. \n\"Taking your kids to McDonald's should be a fundamentally... fun experience,\"Easterbrook said. \"But, the initial stages of it can be quite stressful when you're trying to place the order, you're trying to get it right, you're trying to get the drinks, you're trying to search for a table, and your kids are running around.\" \nMcDonald's table service roll out is part of a wider effort to improve customer experience.\nMcDonald's is introducing mobile ordering next year, testing the service in the first half of 2017 and implementing it nationally in the second half of the year. Along with table service, the chain is also rolling out kiosk service to more locations. \nWhile kiosks and mobile ordering are frequently associated with decreasing labor costs, McDonald's says that its investments in tech do not mean the chain will cut employees. In Canada, where McDonald's has nearly completed its national roll out of kiosks and table service, the company says locations' employee counts have remained roughly stable, with more employees serving food as fewer are needed to take orders. \nHollis Johnson \nMcDonald's is also revamping its menu with an emphasis on higher-quality items like  Signature Crafted burgers  and redesigning locations to look more modern. \n\"This is not about being a different McDonald's, this is about being a better McDonald's,\" Easterbrook said. \nAccording to executives, these changes represent a new \"restless energy,\" and that the chain hopes to accelerate the implementation of new innovation in the future. In October, McDonald's reported a 1.3% growth in US same-store sales in the third quarter, the company's fifth consecutive quarter of growth in the US and globally. \n\"It's a totally different mindset to which we are adapting,\" said Easterbrook. \"This is not one and done.\" \nNOW WATCH: Why McDonald's and Chipotle test new food concepts in Ohio \n",

      "text": "You deserve a seat today: McDonald's expanding table service - FOX Carolina 21 Member Center: You deserve a seat today: McDonald's expanding table service Posted: Updated: \nNEW YORK (AP) - McDonald's wants to makes its fast-food outlets feel more like restaurants, with plans to eventually expand table service across its U.S. locations. \nThe world's biggest burger chain says it has been testing the service at about 500 of its more than 14,000 domestic stores. Customers in those stores order at the counter or at kiosks and sit down and wait for an employee bring out their food, a change that McDonald's says improves customer satisfaction. \nMcDonald's says it will expand the offering in Boston, Chicago, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, D.C., early next year. Bringing the change to all its stores could take years, as it would require franchisees to invest in remodeling and more training for employees. \nThe push to offer table service like some fast-casual chains do comes as McDonald's tries to stage a comeback after losing customers in recent years, with executives conceding they failed to keep up with changing tastes. Despite a string of announcements intended to drum up excitement - including the introduction of an all-day breakfast menu - customer visits in the U.S. have not increased, the company said. \nCEO Steve Easterbrook said going to McDonald's is supposed to be fun, but \"the initial stages of it can be quite stressful.\" He noted that customers are becoming more demanding, and the company is working on making visits to its restaurants more convenient. Next year, the company also plans to introduce a mobile order and pay option. \nEven though McDonald's Corp. gets a majority of its sales at the drive-thru in the U.S., the company hopes having table service in restaurants helps improve people's perceptions about the overall experience. Table service and kiosks have already been introduced in other parts of the world, including in the United Kingdom. \nThe kiosks are also intended to give customers greater flexibility in customizing their orders with different buns and toppings for burgers, while reducing the chances for inaccurate orders. McDonald's has said it is working on reducing inaccurate orders, such as by asking employees to repeat orders back to customers at the drive-thru. \nIn stores that are remodeled to have the kiosks and table service, the company said it will also be more prominently featuring its McCafe drinks and baked goods. Those are intended to go after the growing snacking habit. Easterbrook said that the traditional three meals are making up less of the opportunity for growth.  ",

It's not clear exactly how much the remodels will cost, and the price will vary depending on what technology the restaurant currently offers. An ordering kiosk alone can cost $60,000.\nMcDonald's also didn't reveal how long it would take to redesign all of its restaurants nationwide. It will start the process in Chicago and a handful of other large U.S. cities, including Boston and Washington, D.C.\nThe redesigns will include the option of ordering at a kiosk, though counter service also will be available. A customer takes a number from the kiosk after paying and an employee brings the food to their table. Customers can pay at the kiosks using a credit or debit card, or Apple or Android pay. Separately, the chain plans to roll out mobile ordering nationwide next year.\nSince the mid-1950s, McDonald's has been synonymous with burgers and fries in the U.S. Now it has more than 36,000 stores in 120 countries.

      "text": "McDonald's To Expand Table Service In Break With Tradition LESLIE PATTON, CRAIG GIAMMONA Bloomberg \nMcDonald's Corp. plans to offer table service at all its U.S. restaurants, upending decades of fast-food tradition in a bid to placate pickier customers. \nTable service is currently in about 500 locations, but will be rolled out to the entire U.S. chain, McDonald's said Thursday at an event in New York. The company also is bringing mobile ordering and payments to the country in 2017, as well as more digital kiosks. \nMcDonald's already has table service at some locations in New York, Florida and Southern California, as well as many places abroad. It's coming soon to markets such as Boston and San Francisco, the company said. New positions will be created at restaurants to serve food and help customers with touch-screen orders. \nThe shift is significant for a company most responsible for popularizing fast food — along with a more stripped-down approach to restaurant service. But competition and the rise of fast-casual chains have elevated expectations. Customers also are looking to technology to help make restaurants more convenient. \n\"Customers are getting increasingly demanding, and their expectations will only grow,\" Chief Executive Officer Steve Easterbrook said at the event. \nA drop in the cost of groceries has added pressure to fast-food chains this year because it's increasingly cheaper for customers to eat at home. Restaurant companies also have blamed anxiety around the presidential election for hurting results. McDonald's shares are up just about 1 percent in 2016, lagging behind the 7 percent increase for the Standard & Poor's 500 Index. \nThe new approach may bring in the kind of customers who balk at lines, said Ivan Feinseth, analyst at Tigress Financial Partners. \n\"It will make it look less congested at the point of ordering,\" he said. \"Then people feel they won't have to wait that long.\" \nEarlier this month, the world's biggest restaurant chain said it was planning a \"significant\" boost in technology spending. The investment will help fund the new self-serve kiosks and mobile-ordering application. The plan includes expanding a smartphone ordering app across its 14,000 domestic locations, starting next year. \nMcDonald's had fallen behind competitors in technology. Dunkin' Donuts and Taco Bell already allow diners to order via smartphones, and Starbucks Corp. boasts millions of active rewards members. McDonald's, based in Oak Brook, Ill., is looking to grab some of those consumers with its own faster and more convenient service. \nFor 60 years, McDonald's dictated how customers ordered and got food, Easterbrook said. \n\"That's changing now,\" he said. \"It's a totally different mindset.\"  ",

Customers in those stores order at the counter or at kiosks and sit down and wait for an employee bring out their food, a change that McDonald's says improves customer satisfaction. \nMcDonald's says it will expand the offering in Boston, Chicago, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, D.C., early next year. Bringing the change to all its stores could take years, as it would require franchisees to invest in remodeling and more training for employees. \nThe push to offer table service like some fast-casual chains do comes as McDonald's tries to stage a comeback after losing customers in recent years, with executives conceding they failed to keep up with changing tastes. Despite a string of announcements intended to drum up excitement - including the introduction of an all-day breakfast menu - customer visits in the U.S. have not increased, the company said. \nCEO Steve Easterbrook said going to McDonald's is supposed to be fun, but \"the initial stages of it can be quite stressful.\" He noted that customers are becoming more demanding, and the company is working on making visits to its restaurants more convenient. Next year, the company also plans to introduce a mobile order and pay option. \nEven though McDonald's Corp. gets a majority of its sales at the drive-thru in the U.S., the company hopes having table service in restaurants helps improve people's perceptions about the overall experience. Table service and kiosks have already been introduced in other parts of the world, including in the United Kingdom. \nThe kiosks are also intended to give customers greater flexibility in customizing their orders with different buns and toppings for burgers, while reducing the chances for inaccurate orders. McDonald's has said it is working on reducing inaccurate orders, such as by asking employees to repeat orders back to customers at the drive-thru. \nIn stores that are remodeled to have the kiosks and table service, the company said it will also be more prominently featuring its McCafe drinks and baked goods. Those are intended to go after the growing snacking habit. Easterbrook said that the traditional three meals are making up less of the opportunity for growth. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

      "text": "NEW YORK (AP) - McDonald's wants to makes its fast-food outlets feel more like restaurants, with plans to eventually expand table service across its U.S. locations.\nThe world's biggest burger chain says it has been testing the service at about 500 of its more than 14,000 domestic stores. Customers in those stores order at the counter or at kiosks and sit down and wait for an employee bring out their food, a change that McDonald's says improves customer satisfaction.\nMcDonald's says it will expand the offering in Boston, Chicago, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, D.C., early next year. Bringing the change to all its stores could take years, as it would require franchisees to invest in remodeling and more training for employees.\nThe push to offer table service like some fast-casual chains do comes as McDonald's tries to stage a comeback after losing customers in recent years, with executives conceding they failed to keep up with changing tastes. Despite a string of announcements intended to drum up excitement - including the introduction of an all-day breakfast menu - customer visits in the U.S. have not increased, the company said.\nCEO Steve Easterbrook said going to McDonald's is supposed to be fun, but \"the initial stages of it can be quite stressful.\" He noted that customers are becoming more demanding, and the company is working on making visits to its restaurants more convenient. Next year, the company also plans to introduce a mobile order and pay option.\nEven though McDonald's Corp. gets a majority of its sales at the drive-thru in the U.S., the company hopes having table service in restaurants helps improve people's perceptions about the overall experience. Table service and kiosks have already been introduced in other parts of the world, including in the United Kingdom.\nThe kiosks are also intended to give customers greater flexibility in customizing their orders with different buns and toppings for burgers, while reducing the chances for inaccurate orders. McDonald's has said it is working on reducing inaccurate orders, such as by asking employees to repeat orders back to customers at the drive-thru.\nIn stores that are remodeled to have the kiosks and table service, the company said it will also be more prominently featuring its McCafe drinks and baked goods. Those are intended to go after the growing snacking habit. Easterbrook said that the traditional three meals are making up less of the opportunity for growth.\nCopyright 2016 The Associated Press.

      "text": "You deserve a seat today: McDonald's expanding table service - WNEM TV 5 Member Center: You deserve a seat today: McDonald's expanding table service Posted: Updated: \nNEW YORK (AP) - McDonald's wants to makes its fast-food outlets feel more like restaurants, with plans to eventually expand table service across its U.S. locations. \nThe world's biggest burger chain says it has been testing the service at about 500 of its more than 14,000 domestic stores. Customers in those stores order at the counter or at kiosks and sit down and wait for an employee bring out their food, a change that McDonald's says improves customer satisfaction. \nMcDonald's says it will expand the offering in Boston, Chicago, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, D.C., early next year. Bringing the change to all its stores could take years, as it would require franchisees to invest in remodeling and more training for employees. \nThe push to offer table service like some fast-casual chains do comes as McDonald's tries to stage a comeback after losing customers in recent years, with executives conceding they failed to keep up with changing tastes. Despite a string of announcements intended to drum up excitement - including the introduction of an all-day breakfast menu - customer visits in the U.S. have not increased, the company said. \nCEO Steve Easterbrook said going to McDonald's is supposed to be fun, but \"the initial stages of it can be quite stressful.\" He noted that customers are becoming more demanding, and the company is working on making visits to its restaurants more convenient. Next year, the company also plans to introduce a mobile order and pay option. \nEven though McDonald's Corp. gets a majority of its sales at the drive-thru in the U.S., the company hopes having table service in restaurants helps improve people's perceptions about the overall experience. Table service and kiosks have already been introduced in other parts of the world, including in the United Kingdom. \nThe kiosks are also intended to give customers greater flexibility in customizing their orders with different buns and toppings for burgers, while reducing the chances for inaccurate orders. McDonald's has said it is working on reducing inaccurate orders, such as by asking employees to repeat orders back to customers at the drive-thru. \nIn stores that are remodeled to have the kiosks and table service, the company said it will also be more prominently featuring its McCafe drinks and baked goods. Those are intended to go after the growing snacking habit. Easterbrook said that the traditional three meals are making up less of the opportunity for growth.  ",

      "text": "You deserve a seat today: McDonald's expanding table service   You deserve a seat today: McDonald's expanding table service Posted: Updated: \nNEW YORK (AP) - McDonald's wants to makes its fast-food outlets feel more like restaurants, with plans to eventually expand table service across its U.S. locations. \nThe world's biggest burger chain says it has been testing the service at about 500 of its more than 14,000 domestic stores. Customers in those stores order at the counter or at kiosks and sit down and wait for an employee bring out their food, a change that McDonald's says improves customer satisfaction. \nMcDonald's says it will expand the offering in Boston, Chicago, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, D.C., early next year. Bringing the change to all its stores could take years, as it would require franchisees to invest in remodeling and more training for employees. \nThe push to offer table service like some fast-casual chains do comes as McDonald's tries to stage a comeback after losing customers in recent years, with executives conceding they failed to keep up with changing tastes. Despite a string of announcements intended to drum up excitement - including the introduction of an all-day breakfast menu - customer visits in the U.S. have not increased, the company said. \nCEO Steve Easterbrook said going to McDonald's is supposed to be fun, but \"the initial stages of it can be quite stressful.\" He noted that customers are becoming more demanding, and the company is working on making visits to its restaurants more convenient. Next year, the company also plans to introduce a mobile order and pay option. \nEven though McDonald's Corp. gets a majority of its sales at the drive-thru in the U.S., the company hopes having table service in restaurants helps improve people's perceptions about the overall experience. Table service and kiosks have already been introduced in other parts of the world, including in the United Kingdom. \nThe kiosks are also intended to give customers greater flexibility in customizing their orders with different buns and toppings for burgers, while reducing the chances for inaccurate orders. McDonald's has said it is working on reducing inaccurate orders, such as by asking employees to repeat orders back to customers at the drive-thru. \nIn stores that are remodeled to have the kiosks and table service, the company said it will also be more prominently featuring its McCafe drinks and baked goods. Those are intended to go after the growing snacking habit. Easterbrook said that the traditional three meals are making up less of the opportunity for growth.  ",

      "text": "McDonald's to Expand Table Service in Break With Tradition November 17, 2016 03:00 PM By Bloomberg \nMcDonald’s Corp. plans to offer table service at all its U.S. restaurants, upending decades of fast-food tradition in a bid to placate pickier customers. \nTable service is currently in about 500 locations, but will be rolled out to the entire U.S. chain, McDonald’s said Thursday at an event in New York. The company also is bringing mobile ordering and payments to the country in 2017, as well as more digital kiosks. \nMcDonald’s already has table service at some locations in New York, Florida and Southern California, as well as many places abroad. It’s coming soon to markets such as Boston and San Francisco, the company said. New positions will be created at restaurants to serve food and help customers with touch-screen orders. \nThe shift is significant for a company most responsible for popularizing fast food -- along with a more stripped-down approach to restaurant service. But competition and the rise of fast-casual chains have elevated expectations. Customers also are looking to technology to help make restaurants more convenient. \n“Customers are getting increasingly demanding, and their expectations will only grow,” Chief Executive Officer Steve Easterbrook said at the event. Sluggish Stock \nA drop in the cost of groceries has added pressure to fast-food chains this year because it’s increasingly cheap for customers to eat at home. Restaurant companies also have blamed anxiety around the presidential election for hurting results. McDonald’s shares are up just about 1 percent in 2016, lagging behind the 7 percent increase for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index. \nThe new approach may bring in the kind of customers who balk at lines, said Ivan Feinseth, analyst at Tigress Financial Partners. \n“It will make it look less congested at the point of ordering,” he said. “Then people feel they won’t have to wait that long.” \nEarlier this month, the world’s biggest restaurant chain said it was planning a “significant” boost in technology spending. The investment will help fund the new self-serve kiosks and mobile-ordering application. The plan includes expanding a smartphone ordering app across its 14,000 domestic locations, starting next year. \nMcDonald’s had fallen behind competitors in technology. Dunkin’ Donuts and Taco Bell already allow diners to order via smartphones, and Starbucks Corp. boasts millions of active rewards members. McDonald’s, based in Oak Brook, Illinois, is looking to grab some of those consumers with its own faster and more convenient service. \nFor 60 years, McDonald’s dictated how customers ordered and got food, Easterbrook said. \n“That’s changing now,” he said. “It’s a totally different mindset.”",

The company has already introduced some \"experience of the future\" updates such as self-service kiosk in about 500 restaurants.   \nThe announcement was made in a meeting with journalists on Thursday.

The fun (but crudely named) This is why youre fat used to collate the most outrageous food combinations that humans splice together. McDonalds latest dessert, available only in Italy, is called the Sweety con Nutella, and has the shape and soft buns of a regular burger, but instead of a uniform slab of beef in the middle, it has a big gooey center of Nutella hazelnut and cocoa spread. This carb-heavy feast would surely get a place on the This is why youre fat Reddit, if not the original site. \nLike the regular McDonalds burger, the Sweety con Nutella is smaller than it appears in pictures, though it still finds enough room to fit 256 calories per serving. If you want to look on the positive side of its nutritional info sheet, the treat does provide 1.9 grams of dietary fiber, so if you devour 13.2 Sweetys, youd reach your daily fiber intake goal as determined by the American Heart Association.",

More >> More >> \nNEW YORK (AP) - McDonald's wants to makes its fast-food outlets feel more like restaurants, with plans to eventually expand table service across its U.S. locations. \nThe world's biggest burger chain says it has been testing the service at about 500 of its more than 14,000 domestic stores. Customers in those stores order at the counter or at kiosks and sit down and wait for an employee bring out their food, a change that McDonald's says improves customer satisfaction. \nMcDonald's says it will expand the offering in Boston, Chicago, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, D.C., early next year. Bringing the change to all its stores could take years, as it would require franchisees to invest in remodeling and more training for employees. \nThe push to offer table service like some fast-casual chains do comes as McDonald's tries to stage a comeback after losing customers in recent years, with executives conceding they failed to keep up with changing tastes. Despite a string of announcements intended to drum up excitement - including the introduction of an all-day breakfast menu - customer visits in the U.S. have not increased, the company said. \nCEO Steve Easterbrook said going to McDonald's is supposed to be fun, but \"the initial stages of it can be quite stressful.\" He noted that customers are becoming more demanding, and the company is working on making visits to its restaurants more convenient. Next year, the company also plans to introduce a mobile order and pay option. \nEven though McDonald's Corp. gets a majority of its sales at the drive-thru in the U.S., the company hopes having table service in restaurants helps improve people's perceptions about the overall experience. Table service and kiosks have already been introduced in other parts of the world, including in the United Kingdom. \nThe kiosks are also intended to give customers greater flexibility in customizing their orders with different buns and toppings for burgers, while reducing the chances for inaccurate orders. McDonald's has said it is working on reducing inaccurate orders, such as by asking employees to repeat orders back to customers at the drive-thru. \nIn stores that are remodeled to have the kiosks and table service, the company said it will also be more prominently featuring its McCafe drinks and baked goods. Those are intended to go after the growing snacking habit. Easterbrook said that the traditional three meals are making up less of the opportunity for growth. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

      "text": "NEW YORK (AP/CBS) — McDonald’s wants to make its fast-food outlets feel more like restaurants, with plans to eventually expand the type of table service it features at two Chicago locations here and across the nation.\nThe world’s biggest burger chain says it has been testing the service at about 500 of its more than 14,000 domestic stores. Customers in those stores order at the counter or at kiosks and sit down and wait for an employee bring out their food, a change that McDonald’s says improves customer satisfaction.\nMcDonald’s says it will expand the offering in Boston, Chicago, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, D.C., early next year. Bringing the change to all its stores could take years, as it would require franchisees to invest in remodeling and more training for employees.\nTwo locations in the Chicago region already have the table service: one in downtown Chicago and one in Downers Grove.\nThe push to offer table service like some fast-casual chains do comes as McDonald’s tries to stage a comeback after losing customers in recent years, with executives conceding they failed to keep up with changing tastes. Despite a string of announcements intended to drum up excitement — including the introduction of an all-day breakfast menu — customer visits in the U.S. have not increased, the company said.\nCEO Steve Easterbrook said going to McDonald’s is supposed to be fun, but “the initial stages of it can be quite stressful.”\nHe noted that customers are becoming more demanding, and the company is working on making visits to its restaurants more convenient. Next year, the company also plans to introduce a mobile order and pay option.\nEven though McDonald’s Corp. gets a majority of its sales at the drive-thru in the U.S., the company hopes having table service in restaurants helps improve people’s perceptions about the overall experience. Table service and kiosks have already been introduced in other parts of the world, including in the United Kingdom.\nThe kiosks are also intended to give customers greater flexibility in customizing their orders with different buns and toppings for burgers, while reducing the chances for inaccurate orders. McDonald’s has said it is working on reducing inaccurate orders, such as by asking employees to repeat orders back to customers at the drive-thru.\nIn stores that are remodeled to have the kiosks and table service, the company said it will also be more prominently featuring its McCafe drinks and baked goods. Those are intended to go after the growing snacking habit.

Customers in those stores order at the counter or at kiosks and sit down and wait for an employee bring out their food, a change that McDonald's says improves customer satisfaction.McDonald's says it will expand the offering in Boston, Chicago, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, D.C., early next year. Bringing the change to all its stores could take years, as it would require franchisees to invest in remodeling and more training for employees.The push to offer table service like some fast-casual chains do comes as McDonald's tries to stage a comeback after losing customers in recent years, with executives conceding they failed to keep up with changing tastes. Despite a string of announcements intended to drum up excitement - including the introduction of an all-day breakfast menu - customer visits in the U.S. have not increased, the company said.CEO Steve Easterbrook said going to McDonald's is supposed to be fun, but \"the initial stages of it can be quite stressful.\" He noted that customers are becoming more demanding, and the company is working on making visits to its restaurants more convenient. Next year, the company also plans to introduce a mobile order and pay option.Even though McDonald's Corp. gets a majority of its sales at the drive-thru in the U.S., the company hopes having table service in restaurants helps improve people's perceptions about the overall experience. Table service and kiosks have already been introduced in other parts of the world, including in the United Kingdom.The kiosks are also intended to give customers greater flexibility in customizing their orders with different buns and toppings for burgers, while reducing the chances for inaccurate orders. McDonald's has said it is working on reducing inaccurate orders, such as by asking employees to repeat orders back to customers at the drive-thru.In stores that are remodeled to have the kiosks and table service, the company said it will also be more prominently featuring its McCafe drinks and baked goods. Those are intended to go after the growing snacking habit. Easterbrook said that the traditional three meals are making up less of the opportunity for growth. Related Topics:",

(Source: Pixabay) \nNEW YORK (AP) - McDonald's wants to makes its fast-food outlets feel more like restaurants, with plans to eventually expand table service across its U.S. locations. \nThe world's biggest burger chain says it has been testing the service at about 500 of its more than 14,000 domestic stores. Customers in those stores order at the counter or at kiosks and sit down and wait for an employee bring out their food, a change that McDonald's says improves customer satisfaction. \nMcDonald's says it will expand the offering in Boston, Chicago, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, D.C., early next year. Bringing the change to all its stores could take years, as it would require franchisees to invest in remodeling and more training for employees. \nThe push to offer table service like some fast-casual chains do comes as McDonald's tries to stage a comeback after losing customers in recent years, with executives conceding they failed to keep up with changing tastes. Despite a string of announcements intended to drum up excitement - including the introduction of an all-day breakfast menu - customer visits in the U.S. have not increased, the company said. \nCEO Steve Easterbrook said going to McDonald's is supposed to be fun, but \"the initial stages of it can be quite stressful.\" He noted that customers are becoming more demanding, and the company is working on making visits to its restaurants more convenient. Next year, the company also plans to introduce a mobile order and pay option. \nEven though McDonald's Corp. gets a majority of its sales at the drive-thru in the U.S., the company hopes having table service in restaurants helps improve people's perceptions about the overall experience. Table service and kiosks have already been introduced in other parts of the world, including in the United Kingdom. \nThe kiosks are also intended to give customers greater flexibility in customizing their orders with different buns and toppings for burgers, while reducing the chances for inaccurate orders. McDonald's has said it is working on reducing inaccurate orders, such as by asking employees to repeat orders back to customers at the drive-thru. \nIn stores that are remodeled to have the kiosks and table service, the company said it will also be more prominently featuring its McCafe drinks and baked goods. Those are intended to go after the growing snacking habit. Easterbrook said that the traditional three meals are making up less of the opportunity for growth.  ",

      "text": "You deserve a seat today: McDonald's expanding table service - WFSB 3 Connecticut Member Center: You deserve a seat today: McDonald's expanding table service Posted: Updated: \nNEW YORK (AP) - McDonald's wants to makes its fast-food outlets feel more like restaurants, with plans to eventually expand table service across its U.S. locations. \nThe world's biggest burger chain says it has been testing the service at about 500 of its more than 14,000 domestic stores. Customers in those stores order at the counter or at kiosks and sit down and wait for an employee bring out their food, a change that McDonald's says improves customer satisfaction. \nMcDonald's says it will expand the offering in Boston, Chicago, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, D.C., early next year. Bringing the change to all its stores could take years, as it would require franchisees to invest in remodeling and more training for employees. \nThe push to offer table service like some fast-casual chains do comes as McDonald's tries to stage a comeback after losing customers in recent years, with executives conceding they failed to keep up with changing tastes. Despite a string of announcements intended to drum up excitement - including the introduction of an all-day breakfast menu - customer visits in the U.S. have not increased, the company said. \nCEO Steve Easterbrook said going to McDonald's is supposed to be fun, but \"the initial stages of it can be quite stressful.\" He noted that customers are becoming more demanding, and the company is working on making visits to its restaurants more convenient. Next year, the company also plans to introduce a mobile order and pay option. \nEven though McDonald's Corp. gets a majority of its sales at the drive-thru in the U.S., the company hopes having table service in restaurants helps improve people's perceptions about the overall experience. Table service and kiosks have already been introduced in other parts of the world, including in the United Kingdom. \nThe kiosks are also intended to give customers greater flexibility in customizing their orders with different buns and toppings for burgers, while reducing the chances for inaccurate orders. McDonald's has said it is working on reducing inaccurate orders, such as by asking employees to repeat orders back to customers at the drive-thru. \nIn stores that are remodeled to have the kiosks and table service, the company said it will also be more prominently featuring its McCafe drinks and baked goods. Those are intended to go after the growing snacking habit. Easterbrook said that the traditional three meals are making up less of the opportunity for growth.  ",

Customers in those stores order at the counter or at kiosks and sit down and wait for an employee bring out their food, a change that McDonald's says improves customer satisfaction. \nMcDonald's says it will expand the offering in Boston, Chicago, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, D.C., early next year. Bringing the change to all its stores could take years, as it would require franchisees to invest in remodeling and more training for employees. \nThe push to offer table service like some fast-casual chains do comes as McDonald's tries to stage a comeback after losing customers in recent years, with executives conceding they failed to keep up with changing tastes. Despite a string of announcements intended to drum up excitement — including the introduction of an all-day breakfast menu — customer visits in the U.S. have not increased, the company said. \nCEO Steve Easterbrook said going to McDonald's is supposed to be fun, but \"the initial stages of it can be quite stressful.\" He noted that customers are becoming more demanding, and the company is working on making visits to its restaurants more convenient. Next year, the company also plans to introduce a mobile order and pay option. \nEven though McDonald's Corp. gets a majority of its sales at the drive-thru in the U.S., the company hopes having table service in restaurants helps improve people's perceptions about the overall experience. Table service and kiosks have already been introduced in other parts of the world, including in the United Kingdom. \nThe kiosks are also intended to give customers greater flexibility in customizing their orders with different buns and toppings for burgers, while reducing the chances for inaccurate orders. McDonald's has said it is working on reducing inaccurate orders, such as by asking employees to repeat orders back to customers at the drive-thru. \nIn stores that are remodeled to have the kiosks and table service, the company said it will also be more prominently featuring its McCafe drinks and baked goods. Those are intended to go after the growing snacking habit. Easterbrook said that the traditional three meals are making up less of the opportunity for growth. About Us",

      "text": "You deserve a seat today: McDonald’s expanding table service The Associated Press Published: November 17, 2016, 2:25 pm Updated: Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) \nNEW YORK (AP) — McDonald’s wants to makes its fast-food outlets feel more like restaurants, with plans to eventually expand table service across its U.S. locations. \nThe world’s biggest burger chain says it has been testing the service at about 500 of its more than 14,000 domestic stores. Customers in those stores order at the counter or at kiosks and sit down and wait for an employee bring out their food, a change that McDonald’s says improves customer satisfaction. \nMcDonald’s says it will expand the offering in Boston, Chicago, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, D.C., early next year. Bringing the change to all its stores could take years, as it would require franchisees to invest in remodeling and more training for employees. \nThe push to offer table service like some fast-casual chains do comes as McDonald’s tries to stage a comeback after losing customers in recent years, with executives conceding they failed to keep up with changing tastes. Despite a string of announcements intended to drum up excitement — including the introduction of an all-day breakfast menu — customer visits in the U.S. have not increased, the company said. \nCEO Steve Easterbrook said going to McDonald’s is supposed to be fun, but “the initial stages of it can be quite stressful.” He noted that customers are becoming more demanding, and the company is working on making visits to its restaurants more convenient. Next year, the company also plans to introduce a mobile order and pay option. \nEven though McDonald’s Corp. gets a majority of its sales at the drive-thru in the U.S., the company hopes having table service in restaurants helps improve people’s perceptions about the overall experience. Table service and kiosks have already been introduced in other parts of the world, including in the United Kingdom. \nThe kiosks are also intended to give customers greater flexibility in customizing their orders with different buns and toppings for burgers, while reducing the chances for inaccurate orders. McDonald’s has said it is working on reducing inaccurate orders, such as by asking employees to repeat orders back to customers at the drive-thru. \nIn stores that are remodeled to have the kiosks and table service, the company said it will also be more prominently featuring its McCafe drinks and baked goods. Those are intended to go after the growing snacking habit. Easterbrook said that the traditional three meals are making up less of the opportunity for growth. Share this: ",

Credit: Judann Pollack/Ad Age Most Popular \nWould you like table service with that? \nMcDonald's observers and investors have been looking for signs that the restaurant chain has a plan to continue its momentum after posting five consecutive quarters of growth. The answer appears to be its new table-service restaurant concept, which the chain said has boosted sales and customer satisfaction stores in its initial markets, including parts of California, the U.K., Australia, Canda, Germany and France. \nMcDonald's is now rolling it out to Boston, Washington, D.C., Chicago, Seattle and San Francisco. \nThe stores are being updated with more modern interiors and Wi-Fi, but the biggest change is table service. Customers can order either at the cashiers or on digital kiosks in which they are able to customize their order with, for example, a gourmet maple-bacon burger and an \"artisanal\" bun. Kiosks will accept debit and credit cards, Apple Pay and Android Pay. After they place their order, a crew member will bring the food to them. \nNext year, McDonald's said it will also add mobile ordering and payment. Mobile payment is already available in some of the company's international markets, while the U.S. has lagged behind. \nMcDonald's said that in the U.K. the new restaurants have resulted in 8% sales growth in the stores and 4% in the drive-thru. (\"A Big Mac tastes better in a reimaged restaurant. It just does,\" said U.K. Managing Director Paul Pomroy in a video shown at the event.) \nMcDonald's CEO Steve Easterbook said that historically the company \"asked the customer to fit around our business model.\" He said that while that \"stood us in very good stead\" for 60 years, today consumers expect businesses to adapt to their needs.

      "text": "NEW YORK (AP/MEDIA GENERAL) — McDonald’s wants to makes its fast-food outlets feel more like restaurants, with plans to eventually expand table service across its U.S. locations.\nThe world’s biggest burger chain says it has been testing the service at about 500 of its more than 14,000 domestic stores. Customers in those stores order at the counter or at kiosks and sit down and wait for an employee bring out their food, a change that McDonald’s says improves customer satisfaction.\nMcDonald’s says it will expand the offering in Boston, Chicago, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, D.C., early next year.

They didn’t come in there [to work] thinking that was going to happen that day … and that was the best part about it,” she said. \nOne by one, the stunned and grateful employees walked over to the man to give him a hug or shake his hand to express their appreciation for his kindness. \n“The employees are so incredibly grateful,” Davila explained. “One called him a living angel.” \nBut his generosity didn’t stop with the employees who were in the restaurant that day, as he ended up leaving cash for all 33 workers, even the ones who weren’t there.

      "text": "| by Brian Seay Former judge Patricia Brown Holmes is the special prosecutor who will investigate whether there was a cover up in the October 2014 police shooting of Laquan McDonald. (Photo: Chicago Police Department; DNAinfo/Erica Demarest) \nA grand jury has convened and will start investigating whether there was a police cover-up of the October 2014 shooting death of Laquan McDonald by an officer in Chicago. \nFormer judge Patricia Brown Holmes, the special prosecutor assigned to the case, said the grand jury will start issuing subpoenas in the next month or two, according to the Chicago Tribune . Holmes said the special grand jury has 16 jurors and 10 alternates. They’ll look into whether officers lied to justify Officer Jason Van Dyke’s shooting of McDonald. \nPolice reports filed by officers at the scene noted that McDonald “ swung the knife toward the officers in an aggressive manner” and that McDonald was “attacking Van Dyke with the knife” before Van Dyke opened fire “in defense of his life.” A dashcam video of the shooting shows Van Dyke opening fire as McDonald walked away from officers. \nIn September, a woman who witnessed the shooting filed a lawsuit that alleges officers pressured her to change her story. She was eating at a nearby Burger King when she saw the incident and was adamant that Van Dyke had no reason to shoot McDonald. Then, she says, police held her for six hours, pressuring her to change her story, and demanding she surrender her phone after they saw her taking photos. \n“Sixteen shots and a cover up” has been a popular refrain for protestors, who have held several marches and rallies in the months since the November 2015 release of the dashcam video. \nIn addition to officers, Holmes could investigate police supervisors as part of the case. The grand jury will ask questions and help steer the investigation, but the prosecutor usually determines who will be indicted. \nVan Dyke is set to face trial for first-degree murder. Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson has pushed for the firing of Van Dyke, three other officers and a sergeant he says lied about the McDonald shooting.",

Table service is already offered at 2,600 locations worldwide, including Canada, France and China.\nThe company is hoping the changes in the U.S. will improve customers’ experience.

      "text": "NEW YORK (AP/MEDIA GENERAL) — McDonald’s wants to makes its fast-food outlets feel more like restaurants, with plans to eventually expand table service across its U.S. locations.\nThe world’s biggest burger chain says it has been testing the service at about 500 of its more than 14,000 domestic stores. Customers in those stores order at the counter or at kiosks and sit down and wait for an employee bring out their food, a change that McDonald’s says improves customer satisfaction.\nMcDonald’s says it will expand the offering in Boston, Chicago, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, D.C., early next year. Bringing the change to all its stores could take years, as it would require franchisees to invest in remodeling and more training for employees.\nThis embed is invalid\nThe push to offer table service like some fast-casual chains do comes as McDonald’s tries to stage a comeback after losing customers in recent years, with executives conceding they failed to keep up with changing tastes. Despite a string of announcements intended to drum up excitement – including the introduction of an all-day breakfast menu – customer visits in the U.S. have not increased, the company said.\nCEO Steve Easterbrook said going to McDonald’s is supposed to be fun, but “the initial stages of it can be quite stressful.” He noted that customers are becoming more demanding, and the company is working on making visits to its restaurants more convenient. Next year, the company also plans to introduce a mobile order and pay option.\nEven though McDonald’s Corp. gets a majority of its sales at the drive-thru in the U.S., the company hopes having table service in restaurants helps improve people’s perceptions about the overall experience. Table service and kiosks have already been introduced in other parts of the world, including in the United Kingdom.\nThe kiosks are also intended to give customers greater flexibility in customizing their orders with different buns and toppings for burgers, while reducing the chances for inaccurate orders. McDonald’s has said it is working on reducing inaccurate orders, such as by asking employees to repeat orders back to customers at the drive-thru.\nIn stores that are remodeled to have the kiosks and table service, the company said it will also be more prominently featuring its McCafe drinks and baked goods. Those are intended to go after the growing snacking habit. Easterbrook said that the traditional three meals are making up less of the opportunity for growth.",

      "text": "Omnicom officially launches “Unlimited,” its dedicated McDonald’s agency KO By Kyle O'Brien - 17 November 2016 21:48pm • Pictured Left to Right - Brian Nienhaus, Chief Executive Officer; Chip Knicker, Chief Digital Officer; Graceann Bennett, Chief \nThe Golden Arches are officially getting personal attention as of today. Omnicom has officially launched \"We Are Unlimited,\" the name of its full-service agency dedicated to handling McDonald's US advertising business. \nThe launch comes nearly three months after McDonald's chose Omnicom to handle its creative account in the US following a months-long review that pitted the holding company against rival Publicis. After the win, Omnicom was tasked with creating an \"agency of the future\" for the fast food chain, the result being We Are Unlimited. \nThe agency will be referred to as Unlimited and it will integrate strategic, creative and analytical capabilities to deliver across all communications touch points, from online to mass, in-restaurant and intercompany. The agency also includes embedded teams from The Marketing Store (TMS), Facebook, Google, Twitter, Adobe, the T Brand Studio of The New York Times and others. \nDeborah Wahl, chief marketing officer of McDonald’s, commented: “Whether it’s a social post, an anthemic film or in-restaurant messaging, we are confident that analytically inspired, creatively-driven thinking and work from Unlimited will help shape McDonald’s marketing in completely new ways to break new ground and fuel increased business impact.” \nUnlimited will be led by BBDO’s Brian Nienhaus, who will serve as CEO for the Chicago-based agency of over 200 brand practitioners. He will report directly to Wendy Clark, DDB North America CEO. \n“Brian’s experience leading integrated teams that span digital, social, sponsorships and traditional advertising working across multiple Omnicom sister agencies, many of whom are part of Unlimited, has uniquely qualified him to take the reins as CEO of this agency,” said Clark. \nNienhaus comes to Unlimited from Omnicom’s BBDO New York, where he led the AT&T corporate brand and business solutions accounts. Prior to that, he led Team Sprint, a multi-agency, data-led integrated team devoted to Sprint communications at Digitas Chicago. Earlier in his career, he spent six years with Cramer-Krasselt leading varied accounts, including Hilton, Hyatt, Zantac, Glaxo, Merck and Under Armour. \n“I’m incredibly honored to assume a leadership role in changing the way agencies deliver client solutions. To do so in partnership with McDonald’s, one of the world’s most iconic brands, and the stellar team we’ve brought together, is both exciting and humbling,” said Nienhaus. \nThe leadership team at Unlimited also includes John Hansa, executive creative director; Graceann Bennett, chief strategy officer; Chip Knicker, chief digital officer; Jon Ellis, chief production officer; Linda Poe, chief financial officer; and Ursula Ostrom, senior vice president and group director. \nHansa joins the agency from Leo Burnett Chicago, where he was responsible for running the creative portion of the McDonald's business. He brings over 27 years of award-winning advertising experience on a variety of blue-chip accounts. \nBennett has led brand strategy at four major global advertising agencies, including Ogilvy. She has stewarded successful integrated creative campaigns for Dove, Volkswagen, Guinness, Wonderbra, and even a world religion. \nKnicker joins Unlimited from Accenture, where he managed their North American ecommerce practice. During this time, he managed the ecommerce delivery organization from client delivery, staffing, recruiting, and people management perspectives. \nEllis has over 20 years of experience working in digital, new media, and traditional broadcast production. He joins Unlimited from DDB, where he served as executive integrated producer, creating integrated campaigns for brands including Capital One, State Farm, Wrigley, and McDonald’s. \nPoe spent nine years with Element 79, an Omnicom agency, as the company’s Controller. She joins Unlimited from Fathom Communications, where she has been the agency’s CFO. \nOstrom will be embedded in Unlimited from The Marketing Store (TMS), where she served as senior vice president, account director. Her 15-plus years of expertise has crossed multiple industries with a diverse list of clients including McDonald's, Disney, Bayer and Alberto Culver. \nNienhaus said: “Along with these key executives, we have hired dozens of associates and are well on our way to being fully staffed by January 1, 2017.”",

      "text": "View this image ›\nScott Olson / Getty Images\nID: 10004981 The next step in McDonald’s ongoing evolution — which already all-day breakfast, some upgraded ingredients, and new restaurant designs — is table service.\nFor those wanting to dine in, servers will now bring the burger to the customer at their table. It’s major departure from the bare-bones services that customers associate with fast food — a style shaped in large part by McDonald’s itself.\nMcDonald’s executives announced the new table service option on Thursday, describing it as another step in efforts to reshape the chain into a “modern, progressive burger company.” The company is trying to sustain a domestic sales turnaround which has seen growth return after years of decline.\nIn the new system, customers order via touchscreen kiosk or with a cashier, then take a Bluetooth-enabled, numbered locator to their table. The locator allows servers to detect what general section of the restaurant they are in, spot the table, and deliver the food.\nView this image ›\nVenessa Wong for BuzzFeed News\nID: 10004944 The company did not say when table service would be available in all 14,000 US restaurants. About 500 US stores already offer table service and kiosk ordering, which is coming soon to restaurants in Boston, Washington DC, Chicago, Seattle, and San Francisco — markets that CEO Steve Easterbrook called “opinion-shaping” and “trendsetting.”\nThe shift to ordering via touchscreen kiosks has raised many questions about the future of the low-paid jobs that McDonald’s offers in abundance, with some believing the chain will reduce its labor needs through automation as labor costs rise.\nIn an interview with BuzzFeed News, Easterbrook said the new table service model will not affect restaurants’ headcount or labor costs, as the addition of self-service ordering will shift workers who were behind the counter into new roles delivering orders. He does hope, however, that this additional service will grow sales without increasing labor costs.\nIn the first half of 2017, McDonald’s will also have a limited launch of a mobile order and pay app in several markets, which it plans to make available nationwide by the end of next year.\nEasterbrook said the dine-in experience at McDonald’s hasn’t evolved as quickly as it needed to. The new table service program is about giving customers more options, he said, pointing to the program’s success in European markets where it has already launched.\nBut in America, table service can only play a small part in how the burger chain is experienced by its customers: about 70% of US sales come from the drive-thru. Of the remaining 30% that do walk in, a significant portion takes their food to go.\nFranchise owners, who are responsible for the day-to day management of most McDonald’s restaurants, will need to invest in the new touchscreen ordering kiosks. The size of such investments will vary based on the size of store: the cost for eight screens is about $56,000, according to a spokesperson.",

      "title": "You deserve a seat today: McDonald's expanding table service",
      "text": "You deserve a seat today: McDonald's expanding table service Updated 2 hrs ago ( … ) \nNEW YORK (AP) — McDonald's wants to makes its fast-food outlets feel more like restaurants, with plans to eventually expand table service across its U.S. locations. \nThe world's biggest burger chain says it has been testing the service at about 500 of its more than 14,000 domestic stores. Customers in those stores order at the counter or at kiosks and sit down and wait for an employee bring out their food, a change that McDonald's says improves customer satisfaction. \nMcDonald's says it will expand the offering in Boston, Chicago, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, D.C., early next year. Bringing the change to all its stores could take years, as it would require franchisees to invest in remodeling and more training for employees. \nThe push to offer table service like some fast-casual chains do comes as McDonald's tries to stage a comeback after losing customers in recent years, with executives conceding they failed to keep up with changing tastes. Despite a string of announcements intended to drum up excitement — including the introduction of an all-day breakfast menu — customer visits in the U.S. have not increased, the company said. \nCEO Steve Easterbrook said going to McDonald's is supposed to be fun, but \"the initial stages of it can be quite stressful.\" He noted that customers are becoming more demanding, and the company is working on making visits to its restaurants more convenient. Next year, the company also plans to introduce a mobile order and pay option. \nEven though McDonald's Corp. gets a majority of its sales at the drive-thru in the U.S., the company hopes having table service in restaurants helps improve people's perceptions about the overall experience. Table service and kiosks have already been introduced in other parts of the world, including in the United Kingdom. [ The Daily Progress news app keeps you up-to-date.

McDonald's has said it is working on reducing inaccurate orders, such as by asking employees to repeat orders back to customers at the drive-thru. \nIn stores that are remodeled to have the kiosks and table service, the company said it will also be more prominently featuring its McCafe drinks and baked goods. Those are intended to go after the growing snacking habit. Easterbrook said that the traditional three meals are making up less of the opportunity for growth. Tags",

      "title": "McDonald's Is Rolling Out Table Service Nationwide",
      "text": "McDonald's Is Rolling Out Table Service Nationwide The food will stay mediocre as ever, though share Eater Chicago/Marc Much McDonald’s is doubling down on its “McDonald’s of the Future” stores, which are outfitted with touch-screen kiosks that allow for more customization of orders and, (this is the bigger news) offer table service. Soon, all McDonald’s U.S. stores will fall in line with this model. McDonald’s is taking a page from the fast casual model in terms of service, but can its food quality keep up? Crain’s reports that McDonald's today announced plans “to expand table service and self-serve ordering kiosks across all of its 14,200 U.S. restaurants, hoping the new format will help boost sales the way it did in overseas markets.” The chain has struggled in recent years due to decreasing revenues and traffic, which eventually led it to shutter hundreds of stores. But the advent of all-day breakfast proved a great success, albeit one that critics worried might not be sustainable . Now, the burger chain is relying on a combination of tech and old-fashioned hospitality to (hopefully) sustain success. The Chicago-based company has already expanded its “McDonald’s of the Future” concept to 500 U.S. stores, reports Crain’s, and will now be adding the experiences to five additional markets: Boston, Washington, DC, Chicago, Seattle, and San Francisco. In addition to kiosks, the high-tech stores also rely more on staff, who deliver food directly to the tables (but don’t take orders at the table, like at a traditional restaurant). So, is McDonald’s moving away from fast food and toward fast-casual? It certainly seems that way, though it’s important to note that the chain’s food hasn’t necessarily changed. Fast-casual concepts like Chipotle and Panera are largely defined by the price point per meal ($9-$13, compared to around $5 for fast food) as well as an emphasis on higher-quality ingredients. Though this could be part of a larger overhaul for the largest fast-food chain in the world, which has slowly been rolling out arguably higher-quality, antibiotic-free ingredients, and in some areas, even testing fresh beef . The kiosks were initially offered as a new way for customers to interact with the chain, but also as a way to offer customization. Through select stores’ Create Your Taste menu, customers could personalize their orders by selecting a bun, a protein, and adding different toppings, like maple bacon, Dijon mustard, or grilled onions. But Create Your Taste proved costly for both franchisees and for customers (one Chicago man even created a nearly $900 burger utilizing the kiosks). Earlier this month, McDonald’s announced it would be replacing Create Your Taste with a line of \"Signature Crafted Recipes.” The new line of Signature Crafted Recipes will offer fewer options: Customers can pick a protein (grilled or fried chicken or a burger patty) and a topping style: apple bacon dijon; sweet barbecue bacon; or pico guacamole. On a recent earnings call with investors , CEO Steve Easterbrook noted that the chain would continue adding digital ordering kiosks to its stores, though. As Business Insider reports, franchisees invest roughly $125,000 per location to install the kiosks in their restaurants, an investment that Easterbrook says pays off. \"Literally as soon [as a store is revamped], it sees a sales lift,\" he said on the earnings call.",

McDonald’s announced table service is coming to all US locations, as well as a long list of other tweaks to the restaurant that brought you the Big Mac and the McRib. McDonald’s insists that these changes will streamline its system for customers and incorporate new technology. We like that, because we could always use more ways to keep things simple. And since f ast food hasn’t changed much over the years , maybe it was time for a facelift.\nMcDonald’s announced that the biggest change will be table service in all of its locations. McDonald's / mcdonaldsjustforyou.com McDonalds already has table service locations in Southern California, Florida, and New York City. They plan to roll out table service in other major US cities like San Francisco, Chicago, Boston, Seattle, and Washington, D.C. in 2017.\nThe table service system will be more efficient, because diners will order from electronic kiosks, rather than cashiers. McDonald's / mcdonaldsjustforyou.com McDonald’s CEO Steve Easterbrook told Business Insider that they’re trying to make the experience of dining at McDonald’s more enjoyable.\n“Taking your kids to McDonald’s should be a fundamentally… fun experience. But, the initial stages of it can be quite stressful when you’re trying to place the order, you’re trying to get it right, you’re trying to get the drinks, you’re trying to search for a table, and your kids are running around.” We hope that the ordering system streamlines things, because Easterbrook is right — ordering is definitely the most stressful part.\nMcDonald’s will also makeover their decor as well as their food. McDonald's / mcdonaldsjustforyou.com McDonald’s will update the interior decoration to look more modern. They will also be emphasizing food with higher quality ingredients, like their Signature Crafted burgers.\nIn selected restaurants nationwide, we’ll be freshly preparing each Signature Collection burger!

      "text": "NEW YORK (AP/MEDIA GENERAL) — McDonald’s wants to makes its fast-food outlets feel more like restaurants, with plans to eventually expand table service across its U.S. locations.\nThe world’s biggest burger chain says it has been testing the service at about 500 of its more than 14,000 domestic stores. Customers in those stores order at the counter or at kiosks and sit down and wait for an employee bring out their food, a change that McDonald’s says improves customer satisfaction.\nMcDonald’s says it will expand the offering in Boston, Chicago, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, D.C., early next year. Bringing the change to all its stores could take years, as it would require franchisees to invest in remodeling and more training for employees.\nThis embed is invalid\nThe push to offer table service like some fast-casual chains do comes as McDonald’s tries to stage a comeback after losing customers in recent years, with executives conceding they failed to keep up with changing tastes. Despite a string of announcements intended to drum up excitement – including the introduction of an all-day breakfast menu – customer visits in the U.S. have not increased, the company said.\nCEO Steve Easterbrook said going to McDonald’s is supposed to be fun, but “the initial stages of it can be quite stressful.” He noted that customers are becoming more demanding, and the company is working on making visits to its restaurants more convenient. Next year, the company also plans to introduce a mobile order and pay option.\nEven though McDonald’s Corp. gets a majority of its sales at the drive-thru in the U.S., the company hopes having table service in restaurants helps improve people’s perceptions about the overall experience.

      "text": "(Adds details from meeting, executive comments)\nNEW YORK/LOS ANGELES, Nov 17(Reuters) - McDonald's, aiming to become more modern and nimble, is updating U.S. restaurants with self-service kiosk ordering, mobile payments, \"smart\" menu boards, custom sandwiches and table service, executives said on Thursday.\nThe 61-year-old fast-food company has been overhauling its food with simpler ingredients and selling breakfast items 24-hours a day, but it is playing catch up in the technology realm to early adopters such as Domino's Pizza, Starbucks Corp and Panera Bread.\nAbout 500 of McDonald's more than 14,000 U.S. restaurants have made the changes with Florida, New York and Southern California the first regions to adopt the new format.\nRestaurants in San Francisco, Boston, Chicago and Seattle will start making the switch next year, according to the company, which declined to give a timeline for how long the changes will take to go nationwide.\nMcDonald's will pilot mobile ordering in the United States in the first half of 2017 and do a national rollout in the second half, Chris Kempczinski, a former Kraft Foods executive who will take over as McDonald's USA president on Jan. 1, told journalists at a press event in New York. Mobile ordering and payment will be added to the McDonald's app, which has been downloaded by 16 million people, he said.\nChief Executive Steve Easterbrook said the company was in the early stage of using technology. \"There is nothing more powerful than one-on-one customer experience\" such as smartphone apps, he said to Reuters.\nStill, some of McDonald's U.S. franchisees have chafed at the prospect of making significant investments at a time when labor costs are rising and restaurant sales growth is tepid.\nAnalysts note that just 50 percent of U.S. McDonald's restaurants have been recently renovated, and the company wants new food and tech elements in addition to the restaurant makeovers.\nThe cost of installing kiosks is between $50,000 and $60,000 and the company is willing to help with money or financing, McDonald's executives said. Eastbrook has said that equipment is not expected to reduce the number of workers in restaurants, since traditional order takers would be redeployed to help customers learn to operate kiosks and to deliver food to tables.\nDemonstrating returns is key to convincing franchisees to make the switch, executives said. In a video, one UK executive said sales grew 8 percent in downtown London as a result of the initiative.\n\"People may not always like to change, but people like to make money,\" Kempczinski told Reuters.\nMcDonald's USA draws on results from modernization projects in the United Kingdom, Australia and Canada as it pushes the effort. \"We've worked a lot of the kinks out,\" Easterbrook told Reuters.\nKempczinski said McDonald's may also pick up the pace of its response to consumer demands for simpler, more natural food.\nMcDonald's USA already has switched to chicken raised without antibiotics important to human health, replaced margarine with butter in its Egg McMuffins, and swapped sugar for high-fructose corn syrup in its hamburger buns.\nMost recently, it said it would fully transition to cage-free eggs in the United States and Canada over the next decade.\n(Reporting by Lisa Baertlein in Los Angeles; Editing by Bernard Orr)",

      "text": "Home > Operations > Technology > McDonald’s to roll out mobile ordering, table service in US McDonald’s to roll out mobile ordering, table service in US Company expanding “Experience of the Future” model to more markets \nAiming to change its reputation as a technologically slow company, McDonald's will be introducing mobile ordering, kiosks and table service in the U.S. McDonald's Advertisement \nMcDonald’s Corp. will debut mobile ordering and table service in the U.S. next year as part of a plan to make its restaurants more technologically savvy, the company said Thursday. \nThe chain plans to bring its “Experience of the Future” concept, which features table service and kiosk ordering, to several new markets in 2017 as part of an effort to transform restaurants and improve speed and accuracy. \nMcDonald’s has been testing the concept at 500 locations, mainly in New York, Florida and Southern California. It plans to roll the service out in Seattle, San Francisco, Chicago, Boston and Washington, D.C., next year, according to the company. \nMcDonald’s plans to introduce mobile ordering in the U.S. in 2017. \nMobile ordering, kiosks and table service would be a monumental change for a brand that has long been known for being slow, methodical and even behind the times when it comes to technology. \nBut the chain is intent on changing that image. In 2014, McDonald’s announced plans to bolster its digital staff from about 20 employees to as many as 250 workers. \nMcDonald’s has been aggressively rolling out its Experience of the Future in many European markets and other areas in the past couple of years. About 2,600 restaurants around the globe have already implemented the Experience of the Future. \nMcDonald’s has 36,615 restaurants worldwide, including more than 14,000 units in the U.S. \nThe goal of adding the technology is to improve service and the ordering process in an effort to reduce mistakes and increase efficiency at a brand known for its complexity. \nMcDonald’s said customer satisfaction scores in France jumped as much as 88 percent after it added kiosks and table service there. \nWhile it takes some time to get used to, McDonald’s said more customers ultimately use the kiosks. Kiosk use grew from 18 percent to 25 percent of orders in the 18 months after they were introduced in France. In Australia, sales rose after the model was introduced there, the company said. \nMcDonald’s said restaurants would hire and train new hospitality crew members in the coming years to improve the customer experience. \nAs part of the new restaurant model, McDonald’s said it would offer customers burgers and chicken from its premium Signature Crafted line, which offers diners chicken sandwiches or burgers from three different options: Maple Bacon Dijon, Pico Guacamole or Sweet BBQ Bacon. The line is a toned-down version of its customization program , which was known as Create Your Taste. \nMcDonald’s faces intense competition for consumers’ restaurant dollars. Competitors Burger King and Wendy’s have been generating sales in recent years. Convenience stores have sapped some budget-conscious consumers. And fast-casual chains like Five Guys, Smashburger and The Habit Burger have been stealing some premium customers. \nUnder CEO Steve Easterbrook, McDonald’s has been unafraid of making big changes in a bid to win back customers. For instance, the chain successfully debuted All Day Breakfast a year ago. \nMcDonald’s plans a limited-time offer next year featuring new sizes of its signature Big Mac sandwich, including a smaller Mac Jr. and a larger Grand Mac, with two patties totaling a third of a pound of meat. \nThe chain is also testing a Big Mac flavored with Sriracha in Ohio this month. \nMcDonald’s stock had been trading as high as $131 per share earlier this year, before falling to $111 10 days ago. The stock has rallied along with other restaurant stocks since the election, but it remains down 9 percent since hitting that high. \nContact Jonathan Maze at",

      "text": "Business 11/17/2016, 03:20pm You deserve a seat today: McDonald’s expanding table service \nMcDonald's CEO Steve Easterbrook demonstrates an order kiosk, with cashier Esmirna DeLeon, during a presentation at a McDonald's restaurant in New York. On Thursday, the company said it wants to makes its fast-food outlets feel more like restaurants, with plans to eventually expand table service across its U.S. locations. | Richard Drew/Associated Press Associated Press Sign-Up for our News & Politics Newsletter Sign-Up \nNEW YORK — McDonald’s wants to makes its fast-food outlets feel more like restaurants, with plans to eventually expand table service across its U.S. locations. \nChicago will be among the first cities to get table service when the experiment is expanded. \nThe world’s biggest burger chain says it has been testing table service at about 500 of its more than 14,000 domestic stores. Customers in those stores order at the counter or at kiosks and sit down and wait for an employee bring out their food, a change that McDonald’s says improves customer satisfaction. \nMcDonald’s says it will expand the offering in Chicago, Boston, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, D.C., early next year. Bringing the change to all its stores could take years, as it would require franchisees to invest in remodeling and more training for employees. \nThe push to offer table service like some fast-casual chains do comes as McDonald’s tries to stage a comeback after losing customers in recent years, with executives conceding they failed to keep up with changing tastes. Despite a string of announcements intended to drum up excitement — including the introduction of an all-day breakfast menu — customer visits in the U.S. have not increased, the company said. \nCEO Steve Easterbrook said going to McDonald’s is supposed to be fun, but “the initial stages of it can be quite stressful.” He noted that customers are becoming more demanding, and the company is working on making visits to its restaurants more convenient. Next year, the company also plans to introduce a mobile order and pay option. \nEven though McDonald’s Corp. gets a majority of its sales at the drive-thru in the U.S., the company hopes having table service in restaurants helps improve people’s perceptions about the overall experience. Table service and kiosks have already been introduced in other parts of the world, including in the United Kingdom. \nThe kiosks are also intended to give customers greater flexibility in customizing their orders with different buns and toppings for burgers, while reducing the chances for inaccurate orders. McDonald’s has said it is working on reducing inaccurate orders, such as by asking employees to repeat orders back to customers at the drive-thru. \nIn stores that are remodeled to have the kiosks and table service, the company said it will also be more prominently featuring its McCafe drinks and baked goods. Those are intended to go after the growing snacking habit. Easterbrook said that the traditional three meals are making up less of the opportunity for growth. ",

      "title": "McDonald's Plans Mobile, More Table Service And Kiosks | Stock News & Stock Market Analysis - IBD",
      "text": "Reprints \nMcDonald's ( MCD ) will launch table service nationwide, while introducing mobile ordering and expanding digital kiosks beginning next year, the burger chain said on Thursday. \nThose plans are part of McDonald's efforts to become a \"modern, progressive burger company,\" executives told reporters in New York. \nThey would also appear to be in keeping with the company's apparent intent, announced earlier this year, to find a way for staff and technology to coexist — at least for now — even as labor costs rise industrywide. \nMcDonald's currently offers table service at some 500 locations, and jobs will be added for the table service and kiosk assistance, Bloomberg said Thursday. Reuters reported that mobile ordering will be introduced in the U.S. and 10 \"major markets\" next year. IBD'S TAKE: President-elect Donald Trump has put restaurant stocks back on the menu , with Jack In The Box and Dave & Buster's near buy points, joining Darden Restaurants and Papa John's. \nTechnology has increasingly become a part of the dining experience for younger restaurant consumers. Some of those customers have turned away from McDonald's to eat at a growing list so-called better-burger chains — Shake Shack ( SHAK ), Habit Restaurants ( HABT ), Five Guys, In-N-Out — that emphasize quality over value and have made it more difficult for McDonald's to balance the two. Chipotle Mexican Grill ( CMG ) itself opened its first Tasty Burger location late last month. \nMore restaurants have also eyed technology as a way to compensate for higher wages. Wendy's ( WEN ) this year said it would make self-ordering kiosks available in its restaurants to offset costs. \nMeanwhile, digital ordering platforms have helped to make Domino's Pizza ( DPZ ) and Papa John's ( PZZA ) outliers in a struggling restaurant sector. \nEarlier this month, McDonald's also said it was planning a \"very significant acceleration\" in spending on technology, according to Bloomberg . \nAnd earlier this year, CEO Steve Easterbrook said that technology like self-ordering kiosks was not \" meant as a labor replacement \" and was unlikely to result in job cuts. \n\"It may change the nature of the jobs in the restaurant, because frankly technology is something that our customers are embracing, whether it's through their phone or whether through self-order kiosks — that is a societal trend,\" he said in May. \n\"We want to adapt to that, but it's not actually meant as a labor replacement. We can just reapportion that labor into more service-orientated roles.\" \nRestaurants in recent months have also struggled to grow sales amid consumers' election-related anxieties, and cheaper groceries have given diners more incentive to eat at home. \nAnd McDonald's, which reported strong quarterly results last month , is also approaching some tough comparisons from a year ago, when its launch of All Day Breakfast helped revive lagging sales growth. However, some analysts this year have expressed concern that McDonald's had depended a bit too much on All Day Breakfast to drive sales. \nMcDonald's shares rose 0.2% to 119.45 in the stock market today . Wendy's rose 1.3%, while Shake Shack climbed 0.4%. Habit fell 0.2%, while Chipotle closed flat. \nRELATED: ",

      "text": "McDonald’s says you deserve table service today It's a major change for the restaurant chain that popularized fast food with minimal service. By and Craig Giammona Bloomberg Share Read Article \nMcDonald’s Corp. plans to offer table service at all its U.S. restaurants, upending decades of fast-food tradition in a bid to placate pickier customers. \nTable service is currently in about 500 locations, but will be rolled out to the entire U.S. chain, McDonald’s said Thursday at an event in New York. The company also is bringing mobile ordering and payments to the country in 2017, as well as more digital kiosks. Table service is already available at McDonald's in some areas, including New York City, where company Executive Chef Dan Coudreaut checked an outgoing order Thursday. The restaurant chain plans to roll out the service nationwide. Associated Press/Richard Drew Search photos available for purchase: Photo Store → \nMcDonald’s already has table service at some locations in New York, Florida and Southern California, as well as many places abroad. It’s coming soon to markets such as Boston and San Francisco, the company said. New positions will be created at restaurants to serve food and help customers with touch-screen orders. \nThe shift is significant for a company most responsible for popularizing fast food – along with a more stripped-down approach to restaurant service. But competition and the rise of fast-casual chains have elevated expectations. Customers also are looking to technology to help make restaurants more convenient. \n“Customers are getting increasingly demanding, and their expectations will only grow,” Chief Executive Officer Steve Easterbrook said at the event. \nA drop in the cost of groceries has added pressure on fast-food chains this year because it’s increasingly cheap for customers to eat at home. Restaurant companies also have blamed anxiety around the presidential election for hurting results. McDonald’s shares are up just about 1 percent in 2016, lagging behind the 7 percent increase for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index. \nThe new approach may bring in the kind of customers who balk at lines, said Ivan Feinseth, analyst at Tigress Financial Partners. \n“It will make it look less congested at the point of ordering,” he said. “Then people feel they won’t have to wait that long.” \nEarlier this month, the world’s biggest restaurant chain said it was planning a “significant” boost in technology spending. The investment will help fund the new self-serve kiosks and mobile-ordering application. The plan includes expanding a smartphone ordering app across its 14,000 domestic locations, starting next year. \nMcDonald’s had fallen behind competitors in technology. Dunkin’ Donuts and Taco Bell already allow diners to order via smartphones, and Starbucks Corp. boasts millions of active rewards members. McDonald’s, based in Oak Brook, Illinois, is looking to grab some of those consumers with its own faster and more convenient service. \nFor 60 years, McDonald’s dictated how customers ordered and got food, Easterbrook said. \n“That’s changing now,” he said. “It’s a totally different mindset.” Share",

      "text": "Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) FILE - In this Saturday, Oct. 10, 2015, file photo, the sun sets behind a McDonald's in Ebensburg, Pa. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar, File) NEW YORK (AP/MEDIA GENERAL) — McDonald’s wants to makes its fast-food outlets feel more like restaurants, with plans to eventually expand table service across its U.S. locations. The world’s biggest burger chain says it has been testing the service at about 500 of its more than 14,000 domestic stores. Customers in those stores order at the counter or at kiosks and sit down and wait for an employee bring out their food, a change that McDonald’s says improves customer satisfaction. McDonald’s says it will expand the offering in Boston, Chicago, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, D.C., early next year. Bringing the change to all its stores could take years, as it would require franchisees to invest in remodeling and more training for employees. The push to offer table service like some fast-casual chains do comes as McDonald’s tries to stage a comeback after losing customers in recent years, with executives conceding they failed to keep up with changing tastes. Despite a string of announcements intended to drum up excitement – including the introduction of an all-day breakfast menu – customer visits in the U.S. have not increased, the company said. CEO Steve Easterbrook said going to McDonald’s is supposed to be fun, but “the initial stages of it can be quite stressful.” He noted that customers are becoming more demanding, and the company is working on making visits to its restaurants more convenient. Next year, the company also plans to introduce a mobile order and pay option. Even though McDonald’s Corp. gets a majority of its sales at the drive-thru in the U.S., the company hopes having table service in restaurants helps improve people’s perceptions about the overall experience. Table service and kiosks have already been introduced in other parts of the world, including in the United Kingdom. The kiosks are also intended to give customers greater flexibility in customizing their orders with different buns and toppings for burgers, while reducing the chances for inaccurate orders. McDonald’s has said it is working on reducing inaccurate orders, such as by asking employees to repeat orders back to customers at the drive-thru. In stores that are remodeled to have the kiosks and table service, the company said it will also be more prominently featuring its McCafe drinks and baked goods. Those are intended to go after the growing snacking habit. Easterbrook said that the traditional three meals are making up less of the opportunity for growth.

      "text": "Richard Drew, The Associated Press \nMcDonald's Executive Chef Dan Coudreaut checks an outgoing order in the kitchen at a McDonald's restaurant, during a presentation in New York's Tribeca neighborhood, Thursday. The company said it wants to makes its fast-food outlets feel more like restaurants, with plans to eventually expand table service across its U.S. locations. \nNEW YORK — McDonald's wants to makes its fast-food outlets feel more like restaurants, with plans to eventually expand table service across its U.S. locations. \nThe world's biggest burger chain says it has been testing the service at about 500 of its more than 14,000 domestic stores. Customers in those stores order at the counter or at kiosks and sit down and wait for an employee bring out their food, a change that McDonald's says improves customer satisfaction. \nMcDonald's says it will expand the offering in Boston, Chicago, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, D.C., early next year. Bringing the change to all its stores could take years, as it would require franchisees to invest in remodeling and more training for employees. \nThe push to offer table service like some fast-casual chains comes as McDonald's tries to stage a comeback after losing customers in recent years, with executives conceding they failed to keep up with changing tastes. \nDespite a string of announcements intended to drum up excitement — including the introduction of an all-day breakfast menu — customer visits in the U.S. have not increased, the company said.

      "text": "  Photo Steve Easterbrook, McDonald’s chief executive, demonstrating how ordering is done at a self-service kiosk in New York on Thursday. Credit Shannon Stapleton/Reuters Welcome to McDonald’s! May I take your order — and bring it to your table? McDonald’s on Thursday announced changes that could reshape the diner’s experience, saying that it would expand its digital self-serve ordering stations and table service to all of its 14,000 American restaurants. The company said once people order at one of the stations — sleek, vertical touchscreens — they will get a digital location device and can take a seat. When their burgers and fries are ready, the technology will guide a server to the table to deliver the food with a big smile and a thank you. “Typically, the majority of our crew is behind the counter, and that counter literally has been a barrier between our crew and the customer,” Steve Easterbrook, chief executive of McDonald’s, said at an event Thursday in a newly renovated and outfitted McDonald’s on Chambers Street in New York. Customers will still be able to order food the old-fashioned way, at the counter. But the move to self-order systems and table service is one way to address one of the biggest problems the company’s restaurants have faced in recent years: slower food delivery to customers, caused by more items on the menu. The thinking is that customers will be more willing to wait if they are sitting at a table instead of waiting at a counter. But it also raises some questions for the company: What does it mean for workers, and is the chain up for a change this big? \nAdvertisement Mr. Easterbrook said the new system would not reduce costs. But it would mean that workers might have slightly different jobs. “We’ve not cutting crew; we’re redeploying them,” he said. McDonald’s has tested the order system in 500 revamped restaurants, or what it calls its “just-for-you experience,” in New York, Florida and Southern California and is now introducing them in Washington, D.C., San Francisco, Seattle, Boston and Chicago. Around the globe, the new program is in some 2,600 McDonald’s restaurants. Mr. Easterbrook and other company executives said some 44,000 customers have been served at tables using the new system in the United States. Families and groups have been the biggest users, but the company expects the screens to attract customers of all kinds as they become more widespread. The self-serve stations, the company says, make it easier to customize an order. “This is a huge opportunity for us to personalize and elevate the experience of our customers in the United States,” said Chris Kempczinski, the new president of United States operations. Many of the company’s customers, though, do not enter the restaurant. About 60 to 70 percent of sales come from its drive-through lanes. “A lot of customers are never going to see this technology,” Dick Adams, a restaurant consultant, said. “It’s just not going to be that big a factor for most franchisees outside big cities.” The company also announced that it would roll out a mobile order-and-pay system that would also change the way customers get their orders, including customers ordering from their cars. Much of what is coming to the United States has already been tried in markets like Canada, Australia and Britain, where roughly one-quarter of transactions are done on in-store screens. \nAdvertisement   How quickly the restaurants change remains to be seen. The vast majority of McDonald’s locations are owned by franchisees, and they will be responsible for paying for the changes. Equipment and installation of the eight order screens at the event on Thursday, at a location in the TriBeCa neighborhood of Manhattan, cost $56,000, said Terri Hickey, a spokeswoman for McDonald’s. The costs for a store with lower sales volume would probably be about $28,000. Franchisees may be loath to make such investments at a time when restaurant sales are lackluster at best — same-store sales in McDonald’s American restaurants rose a paltry 1.3 percent in the third quarter of this year. Many of the company’s stores in Britain have already undergone such a reboot, and in a video, Paul Pomroy, the chief executive of the business in Britain, said the investment was worth it. “The customer’s perception of the quality of the food has changed,” Mr. Pomroy said. “A Big Mac tastes better in a reimaged restaurant, it just does.” A version of this article appears in print on November 18, 2016, on page B3 of the New York edition with the headline: At McDonald’s, Order on Screen, Wait at Table.

      "text": "Business McDonald's USA in tech push plans self-serve kiosks, mobile ordering McDonald's incoming U.S. President Chris Kempczinski speaks during a press conference in New York. Photo: Reuters Published: 1:40   Updated: 8:20   \nNEW YORK/LOS ANGELES- McDonald's, aiming to become more modern and nimble, is updating U.S. restaurants with self-service kiosk ordering, mobile payments, \"smart\" menu boards, custom sandwiches and table service, executives said on Thursday. \nThe 61-year-old fast-food company has been overhauling its food with simpler ingredients and selling breakfast items 24-hours a day, but it is playing catch up in the technology realm to early adopters such as Domino's Pizza, Starbucks Corp and Panera Bread. \nAbout 500 of McDonald's more than 14,000 U.S. restaurants have made the changes with Florida, New York and Southern California the first regions to adopt the new format. \nRestaurants in San Francisco, Boston, Chicago and Seattle will start making the switch next year, according to the company, which declined to give a timeline for how long the changes will take to go nationwide. \nMcDonald's will pilot mobile ordering in the United States in the first half of 2017 and do a national rollout in the second half, Chris Kempczinski, a former Kraft Foods executive who will take over as McDonald's USA president on Jan. 1, told journalists at a press event in New York. Mobile ordering and payment will be added to the McDonald's app, which has been downloaded by 16 million people, he said. \nChief Executive Steve Easterbrook said the company was in the early stage of using technology. \"There is nothing more powerful than one-on-one customer experience\" such as smartphone apps, he said to Reuters. \nStill, some of McDonald's U.S. franchisees have chafed at the prospect of making significant investments at a time when labor costs are rising and restaurant sales growth is tepid. \nAnalysts note that just 50 percent of U.S. McDonald's restaurants have been recently renovated, and the company wants new food and tech elements in addition to the restaurant makeovers. \nThe cost of installing kiosks is between $50,000 and $60,000 and the company is willing to help with money or financing, McDonald's executives said. Eastbrook has said that equipment is not expected to reduce the number of workers in restaurants, since traditional order takers would be redeployed to help customers learn to operate kiosks and to deliver food to tables. \nDemonstrating returns is key to convincing franchisees to make the switch, executives said. In a video, one UK executive said sales grew 8 percent in downtown London as a result of the initiative. \n\"People may not always like to change, but people like to make money,\" Kempczinski told Reuters. \nMcDonald's USA draws on results from modernization projects in the United Kingdom, Australia and Canada as it pushes the effort. \"We've worked a lot of the kinks out,\" Easterbrook told Reuters. \nKempczinski said McDonald's may also pick up the pace of its response to consumer demands for simpler, more natural food. \nMcDonald's USA already has switched to chicken raised without antibiotics important to human health, replaced margarine with butter in its Egg McMuffins, and swapped sugar for high-fructose corn syrup in its hamburger buns. \nMost recently, it said it would fully transition to cage-free eggs in the United States and Canada over the next decade.

      "text": "Shared from the Chicago, IL Patch | Business McDonald's to Upgrade Restaurants With Self-Order Kiosks, New Ways to Pay The renovations will begin in 2017, and Chicago is one of the cities that will see the improvements. By Joe Vince (Patch Staff) - November 17, 2016 8:00 pm ET \nCHICAGO, IL — McDonald's customers might soon be able to use touch-screen, self-order kiosks to order a burger and fries and pay for it with Apple or Android Pay. Those changes were unveiled Thursday as part of the fast-food chain's efforts to upgrade its U.S. restaurants. \nMore than 500 locations in Florida, New York and Southern California have already seen some of these improvements, and McDonald's plans to roll out upgrades in Chicago, Boston, Seattle, San Franciso and Washington, D.C., starting in 2017. \nOther ways the Oakbrook-based company is trying to enhance the dining experience for customers include: Table Service: After ordering at the touch-screen kiosks, diners will be able to sit at a table and wait for a McDonald's employee to bring their food. New Food Options: A premium menu will offer guacamole, Sriracha mayonnaise, new desserts and \"Signature Crafted\" recipes. Changes also will be made to the chain's standards, such as using butter instead of margarine for the Egg McMuffin. New Drive-Throughs: McDonald's is experimenting with digital menu boards at the drive-through that would continuously change to show different deals and offers throughout the day. Double-lane drive-throughs also are being rolled out. New Décor: Redesigned restaurants will feature contemporary colors, modern graphics and digital menus. \nMcDonald's also plans to hire and train new employess to better serve customers. \nImprovements would be financed largely by the franchisees with corporate chipping in, according to the Chicago Tribune . A cost on the upgrades was not given. \nAn example of the new design improvements McDonald's plans to roll out in its restaurants starting in 2017. (photo via McDonald's) \nLike What You're Reading?

      "text": "NEW YORK — McDonald’s CEO Steve Easterbrook knows the business of food is changing.\nSo the fast food giant is rolling out self-order kiosks, mobile pay options, an updated interior design, even table service.\nThe changes are already starting to show up at locations in Florida, New York and Southern California, where 500 restaurants have been updated. Restaurants in San Francisco, Boston, Chicago, D.C. and Seattle will get upgrades in early 2017.\nNow, McDonald’s loyalists will be able to place their customized order on a touch screen, take a seat and have their meal brought right over. Next year, they’ll even have the option of mobile ordering.\n“Customers have access to information that gives them much more control over their lives,” Easterbrook said in an interview with CNNMoney’s Cristina Alesci.\n\nThat’s pushing consumers to demand more, he says — especially in the way of personalized eating.\n“They’re expecting us to evolve and offer greater convenience,” Easterbrook said.\nThe move is the company’s latest attempt to win back the customers it’s lost to popular fast-casual joints like Shake Shack. When Easterbrook took the reins in March 2015, McDonald’s was suffering from falling sales and lousy earnings.\nSince then, McDonald’s has launched an all-day breakfast menu. It’s introduced more customizable sandwiches with fancier ingredients, and announced two new sizes of Big Macs. The chain is also trying to be healthier, cutting artificial preservatives from Chicken McNuggets and offering more wraps and salads.\nThe strategy is working. Revenue and profits for the third quarter topped forecasts.\nConsumer tastes aren’t the only thing changing the way companies operate.\nDonald Trump’s victory in the U.S. presidential election has left many business executives wondering what his administration means for employment, trade and economic growth. In the meantime, Easterbrook and McDonald’s are sitting tight.\n“No one likes uncertainty,” he said. “The sooner we get through this period, and there’s some clarity as to the way things are going to go going forward, we’ll be able to make the long term decisions of business.”",

By: anamika sinha | London  35 AM The group also asking the fast-food chain to set global targets and timelines for switching to pork and beef raised without the non-therapeutic use of medically important antibiotics. (Source: Reuters) \nA McDonald’s Corp shareholder is redoubling efforts to convince the fast-food chain to stop all of its global restaurants from serving the meat of animals raised with antibiotics that are vital for fighting human infections. \nMore than 70 percent of medically important antibiotics in the United States are sold for livestock use. Scientists have warned that the routine use of antibiotics to promote growth and prevent illness in healthy farms animals contributes to the rise of dangerous, antibiotic-resistant “superbug” infections, which kill at least 23,000 Americans each year and pose a significant threat to global health. \nThe Congregation of Benedictine Sisters of Boerne, Texas, asked directors at McDonald’s to prohibit the use of medically important antibiotics in its global poultry supply chain. McDonald’s already has adopted that policy for the chicken served in its US restaurants. \nThe group also asking the fast-food chain to set global targets and timelines for switching to pork and beef raised without the non-therapeutic use of medically important antibiotics. \nJust over 20 percent of McDonald’s shareholders voted in favor of a similar proposal at this year’s annual meeting. The sisters pulled a prior resolution after McDonald’s announced its plans to change its policies on chicken in the United States. The sisters aim to have shareholders vote on the new proposal at McDonald’s 2017 annual meeting. \nMcDonald’s told Reuters it continues “to engage with key experts, including some who serve as advisors to the World Health Organization (WHO), to advance progress across the industry.” \nThe company said its current policy “provides guidance to our suppliers in parts of the world where the industry does not yet have systems in place that would allow them to verify compliance throughout the supply chain. “Sister Susan Mika said the resolution is part of an ongoing process. \n“I said we will be back,” Mika said in a phone interview. “We want them to set goals and to be moving in a certain direction. We expect them to be a leader in taking on these questions of our time.” \nThe sisters are part of the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility (ICCR), which along with ShareAction, Farm Animal Investment Risk & Return (FAIRR) Initiative and As You Sow, also are targeting companies such as Sanderson Farms and Yum Brands Inc with similar campaigns aimed at preserving the efficacy of antibiotics.

On Thursday, the ... more Photo: Richard Drew, AP You deserve a seat today: McDonald's expanding table service 1 / 3 Back to Gallery NEW YORK (AP) — McDonald's wants to makes its fast-food outlets feel more like restaurants, with plans to eventually expand table service across its U.S. locations. The world's biggest burger chain says it has been testing the service at about 500 of its more than 14,000 domestic stores. Customers in those stores order at the counter or at kiosks and sit down and wait for an employee bring out their food, a change that McDonald's says improves customer satisfaction. McDonald's says it will expand the offering in Boston, Chicago, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, D.C., early next year. Bringing the change to all its stores could take years, as it would require franchisees to invest in remodeling and more training for employees. The push to offer table service like some fast-casual chains do comes as McDonald's tries to stage a comeback after losing customers in recent years, with executives conceding they failed to keep up with changing tastes. Despite a string of announcements intended to drum up excitement — including the introduction of an all-day breakfast menu — customer visits in the U.S. have not increased, the company said. FindTheCompany | Graphiq CEO Steve Easterbrook said going to McDonald's is supposed to be fun, but \"the initial stages of it can be quite stressful.\" He noted that customers are becoming more demanding, and the company is working on making visits to its restaurants more convenient. Next year, the company also plans to introduce a mobile order and pay option. Even though McDonald's Corp. gets a majority of its sales at the drive-thru in the U.S., the company hopes having table service in restaurants helps improve people's perceptions about the overall experience. Table service and kiosks have already been introduced in other parts of the world, including in the United Kingdom. The kiosks are also intended to give customers greater flexibility in customizing their orders with different buns and toppings for burgers, while reducing the chances for inaccurate orders. McDonald's has said it is working on reducing inaccurate orders, such as by asking employees to repeat orders back to customers at the drive-thru. In stores that are remodeled to have the kiosks and table service, the company said it will also be more prominently featuring its McCafe drinks and baked goods. Those are intended to go after the growing snacking habit. Easterbrook said that the traditional three meals are making up less of the opportunity for growth. Latest News Video ",

      "text": "McDonald's: More touch screens and table service just the beginning of change by @CNNMoney November 17, 2016: 8:11 PM ET McDonald's CEO: We are modernizing your burger experience McDonald's ( MCD ) CEO Steve Easterbrook knows the business of food is changing. \nSo the fast food giant is rolling out self-order kiosks, mobile pay options, an updated interior design, even table service. \nThe changes are already starting to show up at locations in Florida, New York and Southern California, where 500 restaurants have been updated. Restaurants in San Francisco, Boston, Chicago, D.C. and Seattle will get upgrades in early 2017. \nNow, McDonald's loyalists will be able to place their customized order on a touch screen, take a seat and have their meal brought right over. Next year, they'll even have the option of mobile ordering. \n\"Customers have access to information that gives them much more control over their lives,\" Easterbrook said in an interview with CNNMoney's Cristina Alesci. \nThat's pushing consumers to demand more, he says -- especially in the way of personalized eating. \n\"They're expecting us to evolve and offer greater convenience,\" Easterbrook said. \nThe move is the company's latest attempt to win back the customers it's lost to popular fast-casual joints like Shake Shack ( SHAK ) . When Easterbrook took the reins in March 2015, McDonald's was suffering from falling sales and lousy earnings. \nRelated: McYeah! Big comeback for McDonald's continues \nSince then, McDonald's has launched an all-day breakfast menu. It's introduced more customizable sandwiches with fancier ingredients, and announced two new sizes of Big Macs. The chain is also trying to be healthier, cutting artificial preservatives from Chicken McNuggets and offering more wraps and salads. \nThe strategy is working. Revenue and profits for the third quarter topped forecasts. \nConsumer tastes aren't the only thing changing the way companies operate. \nDonald Trump's victory in the U.S. presidential election has left many business executives wondering what his administration means for employment, trade and economic growth. In the meantime, Easterbrook and McDonald's are sitting tight. \n\"No one likes uncertainty,\" he said. \"The sooner we get through this period, and there's some clarity as to the way things are going to go going forward, we'll be able to make the long term decisions of business.\" CNNMoney (New York) First published November 17, 2016: 8:11 PM ET",

Student ticket prices are $2. \nAs in the previous 13 years of the tournament, Thursday's opening day will be rocking with contests near and far. \nIt all gets going at 9 a.m. at 10 sites. \nThe two gyms at the South campus and the North campus site will host a whopping 24 games on Thursday, followed by plenty more contests on Friday. \nDeer Park will compete in three of those games, while a fourth will take place at Pasadena ISD's Phillips Field house at 4:30 where the girls will play district foe Sam Rayburn at that time. \nThe Deer Park boys will play at 9 a.m. on the north campus against Katy Taylor , followed at noon by the girls taking on St. Pius X. \nFans who catch that contest must hurry over to Watkins Gym for a 1:30 tipoff when the boys play their second pool game, meeting Grapevine. \nPhillips Field house and the other nine sites will host eight games by time the first day of action winds down. \nUp first at Phillips will feature College Park against Clear Brook in the first of 24 Division I boys' pool-game contests. \nThen at 10:30, the Phillips floor will pit Houston Westside against Fort Bend Elkins in another Division I contest. \nAt 1:30 at Phillips, the Division I battles continue when Lancaster opposes College Park, ending College Park's pool assignments. \nAt 3, Westside opposes Plano East.

The slate closes with Manvel meeting Mansfield Summit at 3, San Antonio Brennan opposing Cy-Ranch at 4:30, Dawson looking for Cy-Woods at 6 and Cy-Fair trying Clear Springs at 7:30. \nAcross the hallway in the auxiliary gym, Cy Falls opposes Mansfield Summit at 9, Cy-Ranch opposes Pearland at 10:30, Cy-Woods finding Clear Falls at noon, Cedar Ridge opposing Clear Springs at 1:30, barbers Hill taking on Cy-Falls at 3, Pearland meeting North Shore at 4:30, Clear Falls facing Duncanville at 6 and Cedar Ridge landing Katy Seven Lakes at 7:30. \nThe other Division 2 girls contests at high noon will have Cy Creek opposing San Antonio Madison at Memorial, Dobie hosting College Park at noon, San Antonio Jay meeting El Paso Eastwood at South Houston, Sam Rayburn taking on North Crowley at Sam Rayburn, The Woodlands opposing Pasadena at Pasadena and Mansfield Lake Ridge meeting Corpus Christi Memorial at Beverly Hills Intermediate. \nThe other 4:30 Division 2 girls games pits Pasadena Memorial opposite San Antonio Madison, Dobie against Lake Ridge, Cy Creek opposite South Houston, North Crowley taking on St. Pius X, Pasadena finding San Antonio Jay, Corpus Christi Memorial against College Park at the DP North campus and El Paso Eastwood meeting The Woodlands.

      "text": "Privacy policy | More Newsletters Getty Images A sign is posted on the exterior of a McDonald's restaurant on April 22, 2015 in San Francisco, California. McDonald's says it plans to offer table service across its U.S. stores to make the ordering process less stressful, but did not say when the overhaul will be complete. The world's biggest burger chain says about 500 of its more than 14,000 domestic stores have been testing table service and ordering kiosks for people who do not want to wait for the cashier. People in those stores order at the counter or kiosks, then sit and wait for an employee to bring them their food. The Divided House: How to Get Through Thanksgiving This Year Early next year, McDonald's says it will expand the offering in Boston, Chicago, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, D.C. The push comes as McDonald's tries to stage a comeback after losing customers in recent years, with executives conceding they failed to keep up with changing tastes. More Trump Cabinet Candidates Emerge Retired General Michael Flynn returned to Trump Tower on Nov. 17. President-elect Donald Trump's close aide is now reportedly his pick for National Security Advisor. The retired three-star general is controversial, appearing in the past on Russian T.V. and with Vladimir Putin. South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, under consideration for Secretary of State, also paid a visit, and a source reports Trump will talk this weekend to Mitt Romney about that same job.

(Source: Pixabay) \nNEW YORK (AP) - McDonald's wants to makes its fast-food outlets feel more like restaurants, with plans to eventually expand table service across its U.S. locations. \nThe world's biggest burger chain says it has been testing the service at about 500 of its more than 14,000 domestic stores. Customers in those stores order at the counter or at kiosks and sit down and wait for an employee bring out their food, a change that McDonald's says improves customer satisfaction. \nMcDonald's says it will expand the offering in Boston, Chicago, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, D.C., early next year. Bringing the change to all its stores could take years, as it would require franchisees to invest in remodeling and more training for employees. \nThe push to offer table service like some fast-casual chains do comes as McDonald's tries to stage a comeback after losing customers in recent years, with executives conceding they failed to keep up with changing tastes. Despite a string of announcements intended to drum up excitement - including the introduction of an all-day breakfast menu - customer visits in the U.S. have not increased, the company said. \nCEO Steve Easterbrook said going to McDonald's is supposed to be fun, but \"the initial stages of it can be quite stressful.\" He noted that customers are becoming more demanding, and the company is working on making visits to its restaurants more convenient. Next year, the company also plans to introduce a mobile order and pay option. \nEven though McDonald's Corp. gets a majority of its sales at the drive-thru in the U.S., the company hopes having table service in restaurants helps improve people's perceptions about the overall experience. Table service and kiosks have already been introduced in other parts of the world, including in the United Kingdom. \nThe kiosks are also intended to give customers greater flexibility in customizing their orders with different buns and toppings for burgers, while reducing the chances for inaccurate orders. McDonald's has said it is working on reducing inaccurate orders, such as by asking employees to repeat orders back to customers at the drive-thru. \nIn stores that are remodeled to have the kiosks and table service, the company said it will also be more prominently featuring its McCafe drinks and baked goods. Those are intended to go after the growing snacking habit. Easterbrook said that the traditional three meals are making up less of the opportunity for growth. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

      "text": "NEW YORK — McDonald’s CEO Steve Easterbrook knows the business of food is changing.\nSo the fast food giant is rolling out self-order kiosks, mobile pay options, an updated interior design, even table service.\nThe changes are already starting to show up at locations in Florida, New York and Southern California, where 500 restaurants have been updated. Restaurants in San Francisco, Boston, Chicago, D.C. and Seattle will get upgrades in early 2017.\nNow, McDonald’s loyalists will be able to place their customized order on a touch screen, take a seat and have their meal brought right over. Next year, they’ll even have the option of mobile ordering.\n“Customers have access to information that gives them much more control over their lives,” Easterbrook said in an interview with CNNMoney’s Cristina Alesci.\nThat’s pushing consumers to demand more, he says — especially in the way of personalized eating.\n“They’re expecting us to evolve and offer greater convenience,” Easterbrook said.\nThe move is the company’s latest attempt to win back the customers it’s lost to popular fast-casual joints like Shake Shack. When Easterbrook took the reins in March 2015, McDonald’s was suffering from falling sales and lousy earnings.\nSince then, McDonald’s has launched an all-day breakfast menu. It’s introduced more customizable sandwiches with fancier ingredients, and announced two new sizes of Big Macs. The chain is also trying to be healthier, cutting artificial preservatives from Chicken McNuggets and offering more wraps and salads.\nThe strategy is working. Revenue and profits for the third quarter topped forecasts.\nConsumer tastes aren’t the only thing changing the way companies operate.\nDonald Trump’s victory in the U.S. presidential election has left many business executives wondering what his administration means for employment, trade and economic growth. In the meantime, Easterbrook and McDonald’s are sitting tight.\n“No one likes uncertainty,” he said. “The sooner we get through this period, and there’s some clarity as to the way things are going to go going forward, we’ll be able to make the long-term decisions of business.”",

      "text": "Market News | Thu Nov 17, 2016 | 10:30am EST McDonald's investor renews push for antibiotic reduction in all meat By Lisa Baertlein \nNov 17 A McDonald's Corp shareholder is redoubling efforts to convince the fast-food chain to stop all of its global restaurants from serving the meat of animals raised with antibiotics that are vital for fighting human infections. \nMore than 70 percent of medically important antibiotics in the United States are sold for livestock use. Scientists have warned that the routine use of antibiotics to promote growth and prevent illness in healthy farms animals contributes to the rise of dangerous, antibiotic-resistant \"superbug\" infections, which kill at least 23,000 Americans each year and pose a significant threat to global health. \nThe Congregation of Benedictine Sisters of Boerne, Texas, is asking directors at McDonald's to prohibit the use of medically important antibiotics in its global poultry supply chain. McDonald's already has adopted that policy for the chicken served in its U.S. restaurants. \nThe group is also asking the fast-food chain to set global targets and timelines for switching to pork and beef raised without the non-therapeutic use of medically important antibiotics. \nJust over 20 percent of McDonald's shareholders voted in favor of a similar proposal at this year's annual meeting. \nThe sisters aim to have shareholders vote on the new proposal at McDonald's 2017 annual meeting. \nMcDonald's told Reuters it continues \"to engage with key experts, including some who serve as advisors to the World Health Organization (WHO), to advance progress across the industry.\" \nThe company said its current policy \"provides guidance to our suppliers in parts of the world where the industry does not yet have systems in place that would allow them to verify compliance throughout the supply chain.\" \nThe sisters are part of the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility (ICCR), which along with ShareAction, Farm Animal Investment Risk & Return (FAIRR) Initiative and As You Sow, also are targeting companies such as Sanderson Farms and Yum Brands Inc with similar campaigns aimed at preserving the efficacy of antibiotics. \n(Reporting by Lisa Baertlein in Los Angeles; Editing by Bernadette Baum) Next In Market News ",

      "text": "NEW YORK (AP/MEDIA GENERAL) — McDonald’s wants to makes its fast-food outlets feel more like restaurants, with plans to eventually expand table service across its U.S. locations.\nThe world’s biggest burger chain says it has been testing the service at about 500 of its more than 14,000 domestic stores. Customers in those stores order at the counter or at kiosks and sit down and wait for an employee bring out their food, a change that McDonald’s says improves customer satisfaction.\nMcDonald’s says it will expand the offering in Boston, Chicago, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, D.C., early next year. Bringing the change to all its stores could take years, as it would require franchisees to invest in remodeling and more training for employees.\nThis embed is invalid\nThe push to offer table service like some fast-casual chains do comes as McDonald’s tries to stage a comeback after losing customers in recent years, with executives conceding they failed to keep up with changing tastes. Despite a string of announcements intended to drum up excitement – including the introduction of an all-day breakfast menu – customer visits in the U.S. have not increased, the company said.\nCEO Steve Easterbrook said going to McDonald’s is supposed to be fun, but “the initial stages of it can be quite stressful.” He noted that customers are becoming more demanding, and the company is working on making visits to its restaurants more convenient. Next year, the company also plans to introduce a mobile order and pay option.\nEven though McDonald’s Corp. gets a majority of its sales at the drive-thru in the U.S., the company hopes having table service in restaurants helps improve people’s perceptions about the overall experience. Table service and kiosks have already been introduced in other parts of the world, including in the United Kingdom.\nThe kiosks are also intended to give customers greater flexibility in customizing their orders with different buns and toppings for burgers, while reducing the chances for inaccurate orders. McDonald’s has said it is working on reducing inaccurate orders, such as by asking employees to repeat orders back to customers at the drive-thru.\nIn stores that are remodeled to have the kiosks and table service, the company said it will also be more prominently featuring its McCafe drinks and baked goods. Those are intended to go after the growing snacking habit. Easterbrook said that the traditional three meals are making up less of the opportunity for growth.",

      "text": "Next NEW YORK (AP) — McDonald's wants to makes its fast-food outlets feel more like restaurants, with plans to eventually expand table service across its U.S. locations. The world's biggest burger chain says it has been testing the service at about 500 of its more than 14,000 domestic stores. Customers in those stores order at the counter or at kiosks and sit down and wait for an employee bring out their food, a change that McDonald's says improves customer satisfaction. McDonald's says it will expand the offering in Boston, Chicago, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, D.C., early next year. Bringing the change to all its stores could take years, as it would require franchisees to invest in remodeling and more training for employees. The push to offer table service like some fast-casual chains do comes as McDonald's tries to stage a comeback after losing customers in recent years, with executives conceding they failed to keep up with changing tastes. Despite a string of announcements intended to drum up excitement — including the introduction of an all-day breakfast menu — customer visits in the U.S. have not increased, the company said. CEO Steve Easterbrook said going to McDonald's is supposed to be fun, but \"the initial stages of it can be quite stressful.\" He noted that customers are becoming more demanding, and the company is working on making visits to its restaurants more convenient. Next year, the company also plans to introduce a mobile order and pay option. Even though McDonald's Corp. gets a majority of its sales at the drive-thru in the U.S., the company hopes having table service in restaurants helps improve people's perceptions about the overall experience. Table service and kiosks have already been introduced in other parts of the world, including in the United Kingdom. The kiosks are also intended to give customers greater flexibility in customizing their orders with different buns and toppings for burgers, while reducing the chances for inaccurate orders. McDonald's has said it is working on reducing inaccurate orders, such as by asking employees to repeat orders back to customers at the drive-thru. In stores that are remodeled to have the kiosks and table service, the company said it will also be more prominently featuring its McCafe drinks and baked goods. Those are intended to go after the growing snacking habit. Easterbrook said that the traditional three meals are making up less of the opportunity for growth. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

      "text": "NEW YORK - McDonald's announced on Thursday (Nov 17) a bold plan to roll out its \"experience of the future\" concept in the United States, reported the Chicago Tribune.\nThe plans, to be implemented in Chicago and other major US cities, include kiosk ordering and table service, in an effort to better compete with rivals.\nThe Oak Brook-based burger chain has almost 500 redesigned restaurants around the US so far.\nThe world's largest fastfood chain will first focus the rollout in Chicago and a handful of other big US cities, including Boston and Washington DC, the report said.\nBut the company says it will eventually unveil the concept, which has already shown significant success in other countries such as Britain, Australia and Singapore, in all of its 14,000 US restaurants. It did not offer a timeline or overall cost for the project.\n\"Food ordering is one of the most enjoyable moments at restaurants, but at McDonald's that can be one of the most stressful moments,\" CEO Steve Easterbrook said.\n\"The aim is to eliminate that frustration, while also bringing employees out from behind the counter to interact with customers. With the ability to customise, upgrade and add-on items themselves, customers also tend to spend more per visit,\" he added.\nThe plan to eventually redesign and upgrade all US restaurants signals a marked change in the eating experience at McDonald's, and also brings big risks. The ambitious remodelling effort was announced by Mr Easterbrook and other company executives on Thursday morning at a redesigned McDonald's in New York City.\nThe redesigns will provide the option of ordering at a bank of kiosks, though counter service also will be available for those who are paying with cash or prefer not to use the touch-screen machines. After using the kiosk, a customer takes a bluetooth-enabled number placard to a table where an employee will bring the food. Customers are able to pay at the kiosks using a credit or debit card, or Apple or Android pay.\nThe changes will be largely funded by the franchisees that operate McDonald's restaurants, but the company said it will contribute as well. It is not apparent exactly how much the remodels will cost, and the price will also vary depending on what technology the restaurant currently offers. Ordering kiosks alone can possibly cost US$60,000 (S$85,355).\nIncoming US McDonald's president Chris Kempczinski said that while the plan is a big change, he also promised further advancements in food quality and promotions like all-day breakfast, which have been the driver of more than a year of improving sales at the chain.\n\"It's a great start, a significant step forward, but it's also a sign of things to come,\" he said.\nTouch-screen order kiosks were first introduced in Singapore in 2014 and to date, they are available at 25 outlets, including the one at East Coast Park.\nTopics:  FAST FOOD US NEWS  //str.sg/4MY5 Copy",

      "text": "print McDonald's new Signature Crafted burgers represent an effort to convince guest's of McDonald's quality. Hollis Johnson \nMcDonald's announced on Thursday that the fast-food giant plans to roll out table service at all locations across the US. \nThe fast-food giant has begun the process of implementing table service across all 14,000 American locations. With the new system, customers can place orders using a digital kiosk or at the counter, and then choose to either pick up their food to-go or have meals served to them at tables. \n\"For the best part of our 16 years, we've asked customers to work around our business model,\" CEO Steve Easterbrook said in a media event on Thursday. \"But now, customers are more demanding, and we're looking to evolve our business.\" \nCurrently, McDonald's offers table service in more than 500 US locations in New York City, Florida, and Southern California. The company is rolling out table service in Washington DC, Boston, Chicago, San Francisco, and Seattle in early 2017. \nBeyond that, McDonald's does not have a set timeline for the roll out, though McDonald's incoming US president Chris Kempczinski said the chain plans to move as \"quickly as possible\" after collecting data from test markets. \nGlobally, the fast-food chain offers the service in 2,600 locations, in countries including Canada, France, and China. \nWith table service, customers can order at the kiosk, then take a number and have servers deliver their meals to their tables. Kate Taylor \nIn test markets, McDonald's executives said that table service has been particularly popular with large groups and families. \n\"Taking your kids to McDonald's should be a fundamentally... fun experience,\"Easterbrook said. \"But, the initial stages of it can be quite stressful when you're trying to place the order, you're trying to get it right, you're trying to get the drinks, you're trying to search for a table, and your kids are running around.\" \nMcDonald's table service roll out is part of a wider effort to improve customer experience. \nMcDonald's is introducing mobile ordering next year, testing the service in the first half of 2017 and implementing it nationally in the second half of the year. Along with table service, the chain is also rolling out kiosk service to more locations. \nWhile kiosks and mobile ordering are frequently associated with decreasing labor costs, McDonald's says that its investments in tech do not mean the chain will cut employees. In Canada, where McDonald's has nearly completed its national roll out of kiosks and table service, the company says locations' employee counts have remained roughly stable, with more employees serving food as fewer are needed to take orders. \nMcDonald's will be rolling out kiosks at more locations. Hollis Johnson \nMcDonald's is also revamping its menu with an emphasis on higher-quality items like Signature Crafted burgers and redesigning locations to look more modern. \n\"This is not about being a different McDonald's, this is about being a better McDonald's,\" Easterbrook said. \nAccording to executives, these changes represent a new \"restless energy,\" and that the chain hopes to accelerate the implementation of new innovation in the future. In October, McDonald's reported a 1.3% growth in US same-store sales in the third quarter, the company's fifth consecutive quarter of growth in the US and globally. \n\"It's a totally different mindset to which we are adapting,\" said Easterbrook. \"This is not one and done.\"",
