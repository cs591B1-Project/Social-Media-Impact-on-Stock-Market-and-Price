      "text": "By : Chris Bruce , Editor Toyota is still working out how to fix the problem. \nToyota is recalling 744,000 examples of the 2011-2016 Toyota Sienna in the United States because the sliding door could open inadvertently while the minivan is on the road. \nAccording to the automaker’s statement, it’s possible that if the power sliding door is impeded while opening, then the motor circuit could overload and open a fuse. If this happens when the door is unlatched, then the slider could potentially open while the minivan is on the move. This could cause a risk of injury to those inside. \nToyota is still working out a way to repair the problem. The company will notify owners by mail in mid-January. The company won’t currently discuss information about accidents or injuries, according to Automotive News . \nToyota debuted the current generation Sienna for the 2011 model year . The company slightly refreshed the minivan for 2015 with slight revisions to the grille and front fascia. The interior featured better materials and new digital displays. \nThe company has sold 107,369 units of the Sienna in the U.S. through October 2016 – down 6.7 percent from the same period last year. Through all of 2015, Toyota managed to deliver 137,497 examples of the minivan. \nThe Sienna was previously part recall in June for a total of 7,749 examples of 14 models. It was possible for the seat heater to short circuit . If the problem occurred, there could have been a fire. \nOther than Toyota’s ongoing Takata airbag inflator recalls that involve millions of vehicles worldwide, this repair campaign is the automaker’s second largest in the U.S. so far in 2016. The biggest yet happened in February when the company announced repairs for over one million examples of the 2006-2012 Rav4 and 2012-2014 Rav4 EV because the seat cushion frame was able to cut the lap belt in an accident. Dealers installed resin covers for the frames that dulled their edge from slicing the seat belt. Be part of something big 2015 Toyota Sienna unveiled with minor updates [video] Hide press release Show press release \nTOYOTA RECALLS CERTAIN SIENNA VEHICLESPLANO, Texas, November 22, 2016 – Toyota Motor North America, Inc., announced that it is conducting a safety recall of approximately 744,000 Model Year 2011-2016 Toyota Sienna vehicles in the U.S. In the involved vehicles, there is a possibility that, under certain limited conditions, if the sliding door opening operation is impeded, the sliding door motor circuit could be overloaded, opening the fuse for the motor. If this occurs when the door latch is in an unlatched position, the door could open while driving, increasing the risk of injury to a vehicle occupant. Toyota is currently developing the remedy for this condition. All known owners of the involved vehicles will be notified by first class mail by mid-January. Information about automotive recalls, including but not limited to the list of involved vehicles, is subject to change over time. For the most up-to-date Safety Recall information on Lexus, Toyota and Scion customers should check their vehicle’s status by visiting http://www.toyota.com/recall and entering the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN).

A majority of the minivans — 744,000 — were sold in the U.S. \nToyota says the problem happens when the door's opening is impeded and the motor's circuit gets overloaded.

      "text": "Toyota tm is recalling almost 850,000 Sienna minivans in a bid to stamp out a faulty latch system, which can cause the door to slide open while the car is moving.\nIf the Sienna’s sliding doors are “impeded” while opening automatically, CNNMoney reports , it can cause a circuit to overload, which opens a fuse in the car that prevents its latch from fastening correctly.\nA spokesperson for Toyota told Reuters on Tuesday that the recall would affect about 744,000 vehicles in the U.S. and nearly 4,000 in South Korea and Taiwan.\n“Toyota would like to refrain from commenting whether there were any injuries or crashes as a result of the safety flaw,” the spokesperson said.\nSienna minivans in the model year 2011 to 2016 have been affected by the problem. Toyat said it would notify owners mid-January.\nFor more on Toyota recalls, watch Fortune’s video: \n\n \nThis is not the first time Toyota has been hit with safety concerns.\nEarlier this year the Japanese automaker recalled some 5.8 million cars worldwide over faulty air bag inflators made by Takata tktdy . The defective air bag inflators, which used a chemical compound that could explode with excessive force after exposure to hot conditions, were linked to at least 16 deaths globally.",

Toyat said it would notify owners mid-January.\nFor more on Toyota recalls, watch Fortune’s video:\nThis is not the first time Toyota has been hit with safety concerns.\nEarlier this year the Japanese automaker recalled some 5.8 million cars worldwide over faulty air bag inflators made by Takata tktdy . The defective air bag inflators, which used a chemical compound that could explode with excessive force after exposure to hot conditions, were linked to at least 16 deaths globally.",

The recall involves Sienna minivans from the 2011-2016 model years. A majority of the minivans - 744,000 - were sold in the U.S. Toyota says the problem happens when the door's opening is impeded and the motor's circuit gets overloaded. If the door is unlatched, it could open while the minivan is driving. Toyota will repair the doors for free. It is still developing a remedy for the problem. The company said it will notify owners about the fix by mid-January. \n(Copyright   redistributed.)

A majority of the minivans — 744,000 — were sold in the U.S.\nFILE - In this March 30, 2011 file photo, the Toyota logo is shown at Wilsonville Toyota, in Wilsonville, Ore. Toyota Motor Corp. is recalling 834,000 Toyota Sienna minivans in North America because the sliding doors could open while the vehicle is moving. The recall involves Sienna minivans from the 2011-2016 model years. (AP Photo/Rick Bowmer, File)\nToyota says the problem happens when the door's opening is impeded and the motor's circuit gets overloaded. If the door is unlatched, it could open while the minivan is driving.\nToyota will repair the doors for free. It is still developing a remedy for the problem.\nThe company said it will notify owners about the fix by mid-January.\n ",

      "text": "Privacy policy | More Newsletters Getty Images, File A 2016 Toyota Sienna Minivan on display at the Chicago Auto Show on February 19, 2016. (Photo By Raymond Boyd/Getty Images) Nearly three quarters of a million Toyota Siennas are being recalled over the possibility their sliding doors can open while driving, the auto manufacturer announced Tuesday. The recall affects minivans between model years 2011 and 2016, and the company is currently developing a fix. Owners will be notified by mid-January when a remedy for the problem is established for the 744,000 vehicles affected. 'Actual Device' Targets Center City Resident, Explodes: Cops The recall was prompted by a set of conditions that can cause Sienna motor circuits to overload, opening the door if it's latch is in an unlatched position. That only occurs if the sliding door opening operation is impeded, Toyota said. Customers can call 800-331-4331 for more information, or they can look up their vehicle identification number at toyota.com/recall to see if their vehicle is impacted.",

      "text": "11/22/16 11:00 pm EST . \nPLANO, Texas (AP) - Toyota Motor Corp. is recalling 834,000 Toyota Sienna minivans in North America because the sliding doors could open while the vehicle is moving. \nThe recall involves Sienna minivans from the 2011-2016 model years. A majority of the minivans - 744,000 - were sold in the U.S. \nToyota says the problem happens when the door's opening is impeded and the motor's circuit gets overloaded. If the door is unlatched, it could open while the minivan is driving. \nToyota will repair the doors for free. It is still developing a remedy for the problem. \nThe company said it will notify owners about the fix by mid-January. \nCopyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

That can cause the circuit to overload and open a fuse in the car, which prevents the door from latching shut properly.\nToyota is still working on a fix and anticipates notifying owners of the problem in mid-January.\n",

      "text": "Toyota recalling 834,000 Sienna minivans in North America Posted: Follow @KatieLopezKATC Courtesy of MGN Online \nPLANO, Texas (AP) - Toyota Motor Corp. is recalling 834,000 Toyota Sienna minivans in North America because the sliding doors could open while the vehicle is moving. The recall involves Sienna minivans from the 2011-2016 model years. A majority of the minivans - 744,000 - were sold in the U.S. Toyota says the problem happens when the door's opening is impeded and the motor's circuit gets overloaded. If the door is unlatched, it could open while the minivan is driving. Toyota will repair the doors for free. It is still developing a remedy for the problem. The company said it will notify owners about the fix by mid-January. ",

      "text": "Published on November 23rd, 2016 | by Steve Hanley 0 \nNovember 23rd, 2016 by Steve Hanley Originally published on Gas2 . After announcing recently that it is open to the idea of making electric cars , Toyota is putting its money where its mouth is. It has decided to establish an in-house venture company responsible for developing electric vehicles. It will be staffed by four people. How’s that for making a commitment? Hot pink Toyota i-Road charging in Grenoble, France. Credit: Electric Cars Report Toyota’s approach is the ultimate in streamlining the design process. The four will come from Toyota Industries Corporation, Aisin Seiki Company, Ltd, Denso Corporation, and Toyota Motor Company. The organization is a “virtual organization.” Called a “venture company,” it will operate outside of all internal structural organizations within the four participating companies. Kickoff is scheduled for December. The venture company will draw on all the technological resources of the Toyota Group. The small organizational structure is meant to promote unconventional working procedures. That should help the project to move along swiftly and bring products to market in the shortest possible time. Up until now, Toyota has been a steadfast proponent of fuel cell vehicles (aided by a big push from the Japanese government). In terms of cruising range, hydrogen fueling times, and other considerations, Toyota believes FCEV’s offer convenience equal to conventional internal combustion vehicles. That makes them the “ultimate eco-car” as far as Toyota is concerned That’s the theory. The reality is that unless Toyota jumps into the deep end of the electric car pool soon, it risks seeing market share flee to other car companies in the very near future. Commenting on the establishment of the new venture company, Toyota president Akio Toyoda told the press, “Over these past few years, which we have positioned for strengthening our planting of seeds for the future. We have taken such measures as establishing the Toyota Research Institute, made Daihatsu a fully owned subsidiary, and have begun work to established an internal company responsible for compact vehicles for emerging markets. “The new organizational structure for EVs is a part of this effort. As a venture company that will specialize in its field and embrace speed in its approach to work, it is my hope that it will serve as a pulling force for innovation in the work practices of Toyota and the Toyota Group.” The approach is novel and innovative. But will it be too little too late for Toyota? Every other car manufacturer has at least a two year head start. Tesla is now 6 years ahead, based on work on the Model S began. Make haste, Toyada-san. Tempus fugit .",

CNN Previous Next \nPLANO, Texas (AP) -- Toyota Motor Corp. is recalling 834,000 Toyota Sienna minivans in North America because the sliding doors could open while the vehicle is moving. \nRELATED: More recall news \nThe recall involves Sienna minivans from the 2011-2016 model years. A majority of the minivans - 744,000 - were sold in the U.S. \nToyota says the problem happens when the door's opening is impeded and the motor's circuit gets overloaded. If the door is unlatched, it could open while the minivan is driving. \nToyota will repair the doors for free. It is still developing a remedy for the problem. \nThe company said it will notify owners about the fix by mid-January. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

      "text": "Toyota will launch the Prius hybrid for the Indian in January next year. The hybrid car is in its fourth generation now and was showcased at the 2016 Delhi Auto Expo. The car was expected to be introduced this year but now it is reported that the five-door hybrid will make its comeback early next year with an expected pricing of around Rs 40 lakh (ex-showroom).\nThe second generation of the Prius was launched in India in 2010 but saw a dismal sales story as the Indian car market wasn’t ready for the hybrid technology. But now with the Camry hybrid making a name for itself, the Prius may just achieve some decent success.\nThe current generation Prius is based on the Toyota New Global Architecture (TNGA) modular platform. This platform has a lower centre of gravity and an increased structural rigidity, thus improving ride and handling of the hybrid. The new Prius measures 60mm longer, 15mm wider and 20mm lower than the older car.\nThe interiors of this new car are futuristic as well, with things like a digital speedometer, and touchscreen infotainment system compatible withApple Car Play, Android Auto and MirrorLink function. Dual-zone automatic climate control, automatic headlamps, cruise control and automatic climate control, airbags, an electronic stability programme with emergency braking all comes as standard in the Prius.\nThe Prius is powered by a 1.8-litre four cylinder petrol engine that has been paired with an AC synchronous motor. While the setup is same as before, the engine has been tuned for better efficiency. It features improved batteries with higher energy density; smaller electric motors, with higher power density than the previous Prius motors; and the gasoline engine features a 40 per cent more thermal efficiency. The fuel economy has improved on average by about 10 per cent over the previous generation as Toyota expects the Prius to average more than 40kmpl.\nThe new generation Prius will be imported via the CBU route. There is no direct rival for the Prius in India as yet.",

A majority of the minivans – 744,000 – were sold in the U.S.\nToyota says the problem happens when the door’s opening is impeded and the motor’s circuit gets overloaded. If the door is unlatched, it could open while the minivan is driving.\nToyota will repair the doors for free. It is still developing a remedy for the problem.\nThe company said it will notify owners about the fix by mid-January.",

      "text": "I was sitting in the service department of my Toyota dealer, staring at a book without seeing it as I waited for my car. God was next to me, watching \"The Price is Right.\"\n\"Eight-hundred forty-nine dollars and ninety-nine cents,\" he said.\n\"Huh?\" I said.\n\"The retail price of a stainless-steel Kenmore 4.2 cubic foot freestanding gas range,\" said God, pointing to the television.\nOn the screen, an excited young woman blurted, \"Twelve hundred dollars!\"\nDrew Carey looked sad for her as he revealed the price. God shook his head. \"I tried to tell her,\" he said. \"If people would only listen to me ...\"\n\"Oh,\" I said, and returned to the book I wasn't reading.\nGod regarded me a moment. Then he said, \"Transmission?\"\nI looked up. \"What?\"\nGod said, \"I asked if you brought the car in because your transmission went blooey. Obviously, something's got you down.\"\nI sighed and closed the book. \"Trump,\" I said.\n\"Trump?\"\n\"The guy that's going to be our new president,\" I said.\n\"Oh yeah,\" said God. \"With the hair, right?\"\n\"Yeah,\" I said. \"That guy.\"\n\"Well, what about him?\"\nOn the screen above us, some man had Drew Carey in a bear hug. I sighed. \"He's the worst excuse for a leader I've ever seen,\" I said. \"What kind of 'president' spends his time whining about how he's treated on 'Saturday Night Live'? Or has to pay out $25 million to resolve a fraud case en route to inauguration? Not to mention that he's assembling a cabinet only a Klansman could love.\"\n\"Frightening,\" said God.\n\"Yes,\" I said. \"Now here it is Thanksgiving and I find that, well, I'm just not feeling very thankful.\"\nGod was incredulous. \"But look at all I've given you. You've got that great wife, you have a house, you have health and you've got that new granddaughter toddling around.\"\n\"Yeah,\" I said. \"Of course, I'm thankful for all that. But the country...\"\n\"You should thank me for the country, too,\" he said.\n\"How?\" I said. \"Like I just told you, there's nothing to be thankful for.\"\n\"I disagree,\" said God. \"I did some of my better work here.\"\n\"Oh?\" I said. \"Which part? The bigotry, the stupidity or the misogyny?\"\nGod gave me a level look. \"You're angry,\" he said.\n\"Yeah,\" I admitted. \"I probably will be for the next few years.\"\n\"Why?\" asked God.\n\"Why?! Didn't you hear what I said about the dope we elected? About the Masters of Evil he's surrounding himself with? I expect better from this country.\"\n\"You expect better,\" said God. On the screen above, some lady shrieked and bit her fingernails as the Big Wheel spun.\n\"Yeah,\" I said. \"I do.\"\n\"And what gives you this expectation?\"\n\"This is America,\" I said.\nGod laughed. \"You people always say that word like a magic spell,\" he said. \"But there is no magic in it. Certainly no guarantee. You may expect better in America only because here, you have the freedom to demand better -- and to work toward better. That's all 'America' means. You had that freedom before this Trump person was elected, and you have it still. Not everyone does.\"\n\"So you're saying the fight to form a more perfect union is always ongoing? And that even in our current predicament we can draw strength from knowing that? You're saying that God abides even now, and that these are things to be grateful for on Thanksgiving Day?\"\nGod smiled. \"I'm saying thanksgiving is not a day.\"\n\"Wow,\" I said. \"I never thought about it like that.\"\n\"You're welcome,\" said God.\n===",

A majority of the minivans — 744,000 — were sold in the U.S. \nToyota says the problem happens when the door's opening is impeded and the motor's circuit gets overloaded. If the door is unlatched, it could open while the minivan is driving. \nToyota will repair the doors for free. It is still developing a remedy for the problem. \nThe company said it will notify owners about the fix by mid-January. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.   rewritten or redistributed.",

Toyota Sienna recall ordered to keep the sliding doors from opening while driving. \nNovember 22, 2016 — Toyota is recalling about 834,000 Sienna minivans to make sure the sliding doors don't open while the minivans are in motion. \nToyota says about 744,000 of the 2011-2016 Sienna minivans are in the U.S. and the rest are spread out in North America. All need repairs, but the automaker currently doesn't know how to fix the problem. \nThat problem involves sliding doors with motor circuits that can become overloaded, causing the fuse to open. With an open fuse, the door could open while driving if the door latch is in an unlatched position. \nToyota says \"certain limited conditions\" can cause the problem, namely any action that could interfere with the opening of the sliding door. \nToyota hasn't said more about the Sienna recall other than owners will be contacted in January 2017. In addition, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration hasn't released details about the Toyota Sienna sliding door recall. \nIf you own a 2011-2016 Toyota Sienna minivan and have questions, call the automaker at 800-331-4331. \nCarComplaints.com will update this page when safety regulators release details about the recall. \nRead owner-reported complaints about Toyota Sienna minivans:",

      "text": "Cletus Ukpong Related News \nA High Court in Uyo, Akwa Ibom State, Wednesday, seized a Toyota minivan belonging to the University of Uyo over N50,000 costs awarded against the school in an ongoing libel case. \nThe plaintiff, Inih Ebong, an associate professor of theatre arts, is in the court against the university for publishing a disclaimer on him in the Punch Newspaper, after terminating his appointment in 2002 under controversial circumstances. \nHe is challenging the termination in a separate court. \nThe libel case has crawled on for more than 14 years now, and has survived four different judges, mainly because of the university’s effort to frustrate it. \nThe current judge, Okon Okon, awarded N20,000 as cost against the school in August, 2015 for causing unnecessary delay in the proceedings. \nThe judge, again, awarded another cost – N30, 000 – against the school in February 2016, making it N50, 000 altogether. \nMr. Ebong, sensing that the university appeared unwilling to pay him, applied and obtained a writ of attachment from the court which empowered him to impound any of the university’s vehicles until the money was realised. Inih Ebong explaining some point to a sympathetic lawyer outside the courtroom.Photo credit.: CletusUkpong \nEmmanuel Imeh, a deputy registrar and director of personnel in the university, drove the minivan, with the license plate number 50 K-70 FG, into the court premises, unaware of the court order. He was at the court, as usual, to stand in for the school in the libel case. \nThe court bailiffs impounded the vehicle and deflated its tires. \nInside the court room, immediately the case was done with for the day, the university’s lawyer, Ndianabasi Udofia, informed the judge that his client was ready to pay the money. \nMr. Imeh then paid the N50, 000, including extra N2, 000 as charges incurred for executing the order, and got his official vehicle back, while Mr. Ebong left the court room a happy man. \n“With this, I am making a statement,” Mr. Ebong told PREMIUM TIMES at the court premises. “The statement is that University of Uyo has been notorious in disobeying court orders. \n“The vice chancellor of the school is a professor of law and a senior practicing lawyer. He is a minister in the temple of justice. It is people like him who give the judiciary a bad name in this country,” he said. \nThe case was adjourned to December 20 , for continuation of the cross-examination of The Punch. \nMr. Ebong, in his statement of claim, said the disclaimer, which he said was done maliciously, painted him as an impostor, carrying out illegal, unauthorised, and fraudulent business and transactions in the name of the university. \nHe is asking the court to compel Uniuyo to retract the disclaimer, and pay him N800 million as damages, as well as defray his legal expenses of N863,020.00. \nNsikak Effiong of the Toyomfon Chambers, Uyo, represented Mr. Ebong in the case.",

      "text": "CNN \n(CNN Money) — Toyota is recalling more than 700,000 Sienna minivans in the U.S. because of problems with the latch that can cause the sliding doors to open while the car is in motion. \nThe automaker won’t comment on whether it is aware of any deaths or injuries that have occurred as a result of the defect. \nThe problem, which affects the model year 2011 to 2016 Sienna, occurs when the sliding door is “impeded” while opening automatically. That can cause the circuit to overload and open a fuse in the car, which prevents the door from latching shut properly. \nToyota is still working on a fix and anticipates notifying owners of the problem in mid-January. \n\nThe-CNN-Wire™ & © 2016 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Affan , in News | Cars & Vehicles Toyota Recalls 838,000 Sienna over safety issues The minivan was recalled due to safety issues involving the sliding doors. \nAn official safety recall has been made by Toyota due to the safety issues in the Sienna Mini vans. This recall will affect 838,000 units and out of these total units, 744,000 are included in United States of America. Don't Miss: The Best Black Friday 4K HDR TV Deals \nToyota which is a Japanese automaker made an official statement about this recall on their website. The announcement included the fact that the recall will include all Sienna models that have been manufactured from 2011 to 2016. \nThese make a lot of vehicles to count for but the company is all set to inspect them. Toyota said that they are currently developing a fix for the problem that is faced by these vehicles. As soon as they will find something to look for, they will go with the recall and will officially initiate it. \nThe problem arose when a number of complaints were made against the model due to its sliding door opening on its own. It was seen that the sliding door of the minivan could open on its own which can result in deadly accidents. \nAccording to the company it can happen due to a short circuit in the motor that is responsible for sliding the door. Other than that the defect can occur due to the overloading of opening motor’s fuse that can result in failure of the lock while the car is being driven. \nAccording to the company if the door latch remains in un-latched position then it can give way any time and can open while the van is being driven. This can result in the increased risk of injury for the vehicle occupant. There were no reports of accidents of injuries caused by the defect. You May Like",

A majority of the minivans, over 744,000, were sold in the U.S. \nToyota says the problem happens when the door's opening is impeded and the motor's circuit gets overloaded. If the door is unlatched, it could open while the minivan is driving. \nToyota will repair the doors for free. It is still developing a remedy for the problem. \nThe company said it will notify owners about the fix by mid-January. \nIn July, Toyota recalled 3.37 Million vehicles over faulty airbags, emissions control units. \nCustomers can visit the Toyota recall webpage for more information.

      "text": "Technology Toyota aims to sell more hybrid cars in India Toyota Motor Corp expects hybrid cars to make up 20 percent of its total vehicle sales in India by 2020 from less than 2 percent today, a senior company official told Reuters. Posted 24 Nov 2016 01:05 Toyota Motors Corp company logo is pictured on a Hilux pickup at its dealer Toyota Bicutan in Paranaque, Metro Manila, Philippines June 16, 2016. REUTERS/Erik De Castro/Files A \nNEW DELHI: Toyota Motor Corp expects hybrid cars to make up 20 percent of its total vehicle sales in India by 2020 from less than 2 percent today, a senior company official told Reuters. \nToyota, which already sells the Camry hybrid in India, plans to introduce hybrid technology in models like the Corolla and Prius sedans and could introduce it for sport-utility vehicles and multi-purpose vehicles, Akito Tachibana, managing director of Toyota's India business said on Wednesday. \nThe Japanese carmaker also plans to work with its low-cost car-making division, Daihatsu, to develop clean fuel technology vehicles for emerging markets like India, Tachibana said, where affordability is an issue. \nThe development costs of hybrid vehicles means they are out of reach for a vast majority of India's first-time car buyers, which then makes it difficult for carmakers to achieve the volumes needed to bring down the price. \nFor instance, Toyota's Camry hybrid is priced starting at 3.3 million rupees (US$47,932), about 15 times the price of a petrol variant of one of India's top-selling small cars. \nToyota will work to increase the amount of components it sources from the Indian domestic market to bring down the overall cost of manufacturing hybrids, Tachibana said. \nSeveral Indian cities have high levels of air pollution partly caused by automobiles. Earlier this month, New Delhi shut schools, put construction projects on hold and advised people to stay indoors as part of an \"emergency\" plan to deal with dangerous levels of air pollution. \nAuthorities in New Delhi also began revoking licenses for diesel vehicles more than 15 years old which could remove as many as 200,000 cars from the city's roads. Late last year, the country's top court banned the sale of large diesel cars in New Delhi. \n\"We think that hybrid and plug-in hybrid technology is the best solution in India,\" Tachibana said, adding that this clean fuel technology is also needed to meet India's stricter emission and fuel efficiency norms starting in 2017. \nToyota's sales in India rose about 3 percent in the first seven months of the current fiscal year ending March 31, 2017, compared with the same period a year ago, according to India's auto industry body the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers. \nThe number of Toyota vehicles sold for that period was 83,633, according to auto industry body data and Toyota's market share was 5 percent. \nTotal passenger vehicle sales in India rose 11 percent over the same period to 1.77 million. \n(US$1 = 68.8473 Indian rupees) \n(Reporting by Aditi Shah.

      "text": "Technology News | Wed Nov 23, 2016 | 11:56am EST Toyota aims to sell more hybrid cars in India A Toyota logo is seen on media day at the Mondial de l'Automobile, the Paris auto show, in Paris, France, September 29, 2016. REUTERS/Jacky Naegelen/File Photo By Aditi Shah | NEW DELHI \nNEW DELHI Toyota Motor Corp expects hybrid cars to make up 20 percent of its total vehicle sales in India by 2020 from less than 2 percent today, a senior company official told Reuters. \nToyota, which already sells the Camry hybrid in India, plans to introduce hybrid technology in models like the Corolla and Prius sedans and could introduce it for sport-utility vehicles and multi-purpose vehicles, Akito Tachibana, managing director of Toyota's India business said on Wednesday. \nThe Japanese carmaker also plans to work with its low-cost car-making division, Daihatsu, to develop clean fuel technology vehicles for emerging markets like India, Tachibana said, where affordability is an issue. \nThe development costs of hybrid vehicles means they are out of reach for a vast majority of India's first-time car buyers, which then makes it difficult for carmakers to achieve the volumes needed to bring down the price. \nFor instance, Toyota's Camry hybrid is priced starting at 3.3 million rupees ($47,932), about 15 times the price of a petrol variant of one of India's top-selling small cars. \nToyota will work to increase the amount of components it sources from the Indian domestic market to bring down the overall cost of manufacturing hybrids, Tachibana said. \nSeveral Indian cities have high levels of air pollution partly caused by automobiles. Earlier this month, New Delhi shut schools, put construction projects on hold and advised people to stay indoors as part of an \"emergency\" plan to deal with dangerous levels of air pollution. \nAuthorities in New Delhi also began revoking licenses for diesel vehicles more than 15 years old which could remove as many as 200,000 cars from the city's roads. Late last year, the country's top court banned the sale of large diesel cars in New Delhi. \n\"We think that hybrid and plug-in hybrid technology is the best solution in India,\" Tachibana said, adding that this clean fuel technology is also needed to meet India's stricter emission and fuel efficiency norms starting in 2017. \nToyota's sales in India rose about 3 percent in the first seven months of the current fiscal year ending March 31, 2017, compared with the same period a year ago, according to India's auto industry body the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers. \nThe number of Toyota vehicles sold for that period was 83,633, according to auto industry body data and Toyota's market share was 5 percent. \nTotal passenger vehicle sales in India rose 11 percent over the same period to 1.77 million. \n(Reporting by Aditi Shah.

File picture of a Toyota logo at the Mondial de l'Automobile in Paris \nBy Aditi Shah \nNEW DELHI (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp expects hybrid cars to make up 20 percent of its total vehicle sales in India by 2020 from less than 2 percent today, a senior company official told Reuters. \nToyota, which already sells the Camry hybrid in India, plans to introduce hybrid technology in models like the Corolla and Prius sedans and could introduce it for sport-utility vehicles and multi-purpose vehicles, Akito Tachibana, managing director of Toyota's India business said on Wednesday. \nThe Japanese carmaker also plans to work with its low-cost car-making division, Daihatsu, to develop clean fuel technology vehicles for emerging markets like India, Tachibana said, where affordability is an issue. \nThe development costs of hybrid vehicles means they are out of reach for a vast majority of India's first-time car buyers, which then makes it difficult for carmakers to achieve the volumes needed to bring down the price. \nFor instance, Toyota's Camry hybrid is priced starting at 3.3 million rupees ($47,932), about 15 times the price of a petrol variant of one of India's top-selling small cars. \nToyota will work to increase the amount of components it sources from the Indian domestic market to bring down the overall cost of manufacturing hybrids, Tachibana said. \nSeveral Indian cities have high levels of air pollution partly caused by automobiles. Earlier this month, New Delhi shut schools, put construction projects on hold and advised people to stay indoors as part of an \"emergency\" plan to deal with dangerous levels of air pollution. \nAuthorities in New Delhi also began revoking licenses for diesel vehicles more than 15 years old which could remove as many as 200,000 cars from the city's roads. Late last year, the country's top court banned the sale of large diesel cars in New Delhi. \n\"We think that hybrid and plug-in hybrid technology is the best solution in India,\" Tachibana said, adding that this clean fuel technology is also needed to meet India's stricter emission and fuel efficiency norms starting in 2017. \nToyota's sales in India rose about 3 percent in the first seven months of the current fiscal year ending March 31, 2017, compared with the same period a year ago, according to India's auto industry body the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers. \nThe number of Toyota vehicles sold for that period was 83,633, according to auto industry body data and Toyota's market share was 5 percent. \nTotal passenger vehicle sales in India rose 11 percent over the same period to 1.77 million.

      "text": "Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) (AP File Photo/Eugene Hoshiko, File) \nPLANO, Texas (AP) – Toyota Motor Corp. is recalling 834,000 Toyota Sienna minivans in North America because the sliding doors could open while the vehicle is moving. \nThe recall involves Sienna minivans from the 2011-2016 model years. A majority of the minivans – 744,000 – were sold in the U.S. \nToyota says the problem happens when the door’s opening is impeded and the motor’s circuit gets overloaded. If the door is unlatched, it could open while the minivan is driving. \nToyota will repair the doors for free. It is still developing a remedy for the problem. \nThe company said it will notify owners about the fix by mid-January. \n(Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

      "text": "Derani targets further LMP1 outings after Toyota test 817 views By: Sam Smith , Journalist 23/11/2016 04:40 Reigning Daytona and Sebring champion Pipo Derani is targeting further LMP1 tests after completing a successful first run with the Toyota Gazoo Racing team. \nThe Brazilian impressed the team after half a day’s testing in Bahrain last Sunday, clocking in a best time of 1m44.292s during his 32 laps. \nThe 23 year-old, who was chosen by the FIA WEC and ACO to test with Toyota in Bahrain at the ‘Rookie Test’, believes that future opportunities in LMP1 could be possible. \n“The test was really good and I felt right at home in the car and with the team straight away,” he   \n“The Hybrid power boost was obviously the most notable and impressive aspect, but once I was used to this, it really was a car I felt comfortable in.” \nA Brazilian driver is yet to win Le Mans and Derani’s ambition is to add the endurance classic trophy to those already attained at Daytona and Sebring. \n“The LMP1 market has been complicated a lot by Audi’s withdrawal so you have to be realistic and say that a proper chance for 2017 is difficult,” Derani said. \n“However, I now have the knowledge and a little experience and I feel absolutely ready for it. There’s no reason not to deliver a job at the level of the Audi drivers. So, more running in a car is the target. \n\"It all helps with the quest to get there. I am even more focused now that LMP1 is where I want to be in the future. I am absolutely ready for the task if I get the opportunity.” \nDerani, who spent a day at Toyota Motorsport GmbH in Cologne preparing for the test earlier this month, is expected to announce his racing programme shortly. \nThe Toyota Gazoo Racing LMP team was impressed with Derani, who was given several key tasks throughout his three stint run in Bahrain with the #5 Toyota TS 050 HYBRID. \n“We were satisfied with Pipo. He is obviously one of the top quickest LMP2 drivers and we always look and notice who is performing at the top in this class,” Toyota Gazoo Racing’s Deputy Technical Director David Floury   \n“He fitted in well and everything went fine today. Pipo has great potential and will be one to watch in the coming years.”  ",

A majority of the minivans - 744,000 - were sold in the U.S. \nToyota says the problem happens when the door's opening is impeded and the motor's circuit gets overloaded. If the door is unlatched, it could open while the minivan is driving. \nToyota will repair the doors for free. It is still developing a remedy for the problem. \nThe company said it will notify owners about the fix by mid-January.

      "text": "Toyota recalls minivans because doors may open while driving Posted: Updated: \nPLANO, Texas (AP) – Toyota Motor Corp. is recalling 834,000 Toyota Sienna minivans in North America because the sliding doors could open while the vehicle is moving. \nThe recall involves Sienna minivans from the 2011-2016 model years. A majority of the minivans – 744,000 – were sold in the U.S. \nToyota says the problem happens when the door’s opening is impeded and the motor’s circuit gets overloaded. If the door is unlatched, it could open while the minivan is driving. \nToyota will repair the doors for free. It is still developing a remedy for the problem. \nThe company said it will notify owners about the fix by mid-January. \nCopyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

      "text": "Toyota Recalls Over 700,000 Siennas As Doors May Open When Driving | By Share Toyota has announced a recall for over 700,000 of the Sienna minivans due to a rather serious issue with the electric system used for its sliding doors. The Japanese automaker states if one of the doors is impeded when opening, the door’s motor circuit may become overloaded, pulling a fuse. If that were to happen when the door isn’t properly closed, it could open when driving. In total, there are approximately 744,000 Siennas affected by the recall, built between 2011 and 2016. Toyota has yet to announced a remedy for the problem, as it itself is still working on one. Nevertheless, recall notices will be sent out shortly to affected owners. In the meantime, Sienna owners might be wise to be extra careful, as this is not something to be taken lightly. PHOTO GALLERY",

The recall involves Sienna minivans from the 2011-2016 model years. (AP Photo/Rick Bowmer, File) \nPLANO, Texas (AP) — Toyota Motor Corp. is recalling 834,000 Toyota Sienna minivans in North America because the sliding doors could open while the vehicle is moving. \nThe recall involves Sienna minivans from the 2011-2016 model years. A majority of the minivans — 744,000 — were sold in the U.S. \nToyota says the problem happens when the door’s opening is impeded and the motor’s circuit gets overloaded. If the door is unlatched, it could open while the minivan is driving. \nToyota will repair the doors for free. It is still developing a remedy for the problem. \nThe company said it will notify owners about the fix by mid-January. \nGet breaking news, weather and traffic on the go.

By Chris Isidore \nNEW YORK — Toyota is recalling about 744,000 Sienna minivans in the U.S. because of problems with the latch that can cause the sliding doors to open while the car is in motion. \nThe automaker won’t comment on whether it is aware of any deaths or injuries that have occurred as a result of the defect. \nThe problem, which affects the model year 2011 to 2016 Sienna, occurs when the sliding door is “impeded” while opening automatically. That can cause the circuit to overload and open a fuse in the car, which prevents the door from latching shut properly. \nToyota is still working on a fix and anticipates notifying owners of the problem in mid-January.

      "text": "I was sitting in the service department of my Toyota dealer, staring at a book without seeing it as I waited for my car. God was next to me, watching “The Price is Right.” \n“Eight-hundred forty-nine dollars and ninety-nine cents,” he said. \n“Huh?” I said. \n“The retail price of a stainless-steel Kenmore 4.2-cubic-foot freestanding gas range,” said God, pointing to the television. \nOn the screen, an excited young woman blurted, “Twelve hundred dollars!” \nDrew Carey looked sad for her as he revealed the price. God shook his head. “I tried to tell her,” he said. “If people would only listen to me …” \n“Oh,” I said, and returned to the book I wasn’t reading. \nGod regarded me a moment. Then he said, “Transmission?” \nI looked up. “What?” \nGod said, “I asked if you brought the car in because your transmission went blooey. Obviously, something’s got you down.” \nI sighed and closed the book. “Trump,” I said. \n“Trump?” \n“The guy that’s going to be our new president,” I said. \n“Oh yeah,” said God. “With the hair, right?” \n“Yeah,” I said. “That guy.” \n“Well, what about him?” \nOn the screen above us, some man had Drew Carey in a bear hug. I sighed. “He’s the worst excuse for a leader I’ve ever seen,” I said. \n“What kind of ‘president’ spends his time whining about how he’s treated on ‘Saturday Night Live’? Or has to pay out $25 million to resolve a fraud case en route to inauguration? Not to mention that he’s assembling a Cabinet only a Klansman could love.” \n“Frightening,” said God. \n“Yes,” I said. “Now here it is Thanksgiving and I find that, well, I’m just not feeling very thankful.” \nGod was incredulous. “But look at all I’ve given you. You’ve got that great wife, you have a house, you have health and you’ve got that new granddaughter toddling around.” \n“Yeah,” I said. “Of course, I’m thankful for all that. But the country …” \n“You should thank me for the country, too,” he said. \n“How?” I said. “Like I just told you, there’s nothing to be thankful for.” \n“I disagree,” said God. “I did some of my better work here.” \n“Oh?” I said. “Which part? The bigotry, the stupidity or the misogyny?” \nGod gave me a level look. “You’re angry,” he said. \n“Yeah,” I admitted. “I probably will be for the next few years.” \n“Why?” asked God. \n“Why?! Didn’t you hear what I said about the dope we elected? About the Masters of Evil he’s surrounding himself with? I expect better from this country.” \n“You expect better,” said God. On the screen above, some lady shrieked and bit her fingernails as the Big Wheel spun. \n“Yeah,” I said. “I do.” \n“And what gives you this expectation?” \n“This is America,” I said. \nGod laughed. “You people always say that word like a magic spell,” he said. “But there is no magic in it. Certainly no guarantee. You may expect better in America only because here, you have the freedom to demand better – and to work toward better. That’s all ‘America’ means. You had that freedom before this Trump person was elected, and you have it still. Not everyone does.” \n“So you’re saying the fight to form a more perfect union is always ongoing? And that even in our current predicament we can draw strength from knowing that? You’re saying that God abides even now, and that these are things to be grateful for on Thanksgiving Day?” \nGod smiled. “I’m saying thanksgiving is not a day.” \n“Wow,” I said. “I never thought about it like that.” \n“You’re welcome,” said God. \nLeonard Pitts Jr. is a columnist for The Miami Herald.

      "text": "Toyota Recalling 744,000 Sienna Minivans Because Doors Can Open While Driving \nNovember 22, 2016 5:46 pm EST By Chris Morran @themorrancave open air driving toyota recalls total recalls \nUnless you have little regard for your personal safety or the safety of those in your vehicle, you generally want the doors on your minivan to remain closed while it’s in operation. But Toyota says that a defect in its Sienna minivan can result in the doors opening on their own. \nToyota confirmed this afternoon that it is recalling 744,000 2011-2016 Toyota Sienna minivans because there is a possibility that, “under certain limited conditions, if the sliding door opening operation is impeded, the sliding door motor circuit could be overloaded, opening the fuse for the motor. If this occurs when the door latch is in an unlatched position, the door could open while driving, increasing the risk of injury to a vehicle occupant.” \nThe carmaker has not yet developed a fix for the problem, but says it will notify Sienna owners by mail in mid-January. \nToyota does not reference individual incidents in its announcement, but a search of the NHTSA SaferCar.gov database turns up a handful of possibly related reports from Sienna owners. \nOne owner of a 2012 Sienna complained to the agency that “on three separate occasions, my rear sliding doors have spontaneously opened on their own.” The owner claims the dealership told him this was a known issue but since the car hadn’t been recalled it would cost thousands of dollars to repair. \nAnother complaint, filed in 2013, claims that the power sliding doors on their Sienna began to open while the owner was driving with their kids in the back. \n“My kids were safely fastened in their seatbelts but the latch and safety latches both failed and this could have resulted in an accident or injury,” claims the complaint. \nThere are also multiple reports from Sienna owners of being unable to close the minivan doors and sliding doors stuck partially closed.

      "title": "New Toyota Supra and BMW Z5 gear up for 2018 assualt",
      "text": "Joint project creates a 400bhp Toyota coupé and Porsche-rivalling BMW roadster\n\nThe all-new Toyota Supra has now reached a final phase of development and is destined to form the basis of a newly created Toyota performance sub-brand.\n\nLightly veiled prototypes of the sleekly styled coupé are now seen frequently on the roads around the vast R&D operation of Toyota’s project partner, BMW, in Munich, Germany .\n\nThe new Supra is being developed in a joint engineering venture with the upcoming BMW Z5. It will resurrect one of Toyota’s most highly treasured performance models following a 14-year hiatus for the Supra, which was first introduced to the Japanese car maker’s line-up in 1978.\n\nThe upcoming, fifth-generation Supra was first previewed by a pair of Toyota FT-1 concepts designed at the company’s Calty studio in California and unveiled at the 2014 Detroit motor show.\n\nThe new Supra is set to reach UK showrooms during the second half of 2018. It will be offered with the choice of either a traditional petrol or a petrol-electric hybrid drivetrain. The hybrid version is claimed to draw on technology and processes developed for Toyota’s most recent TS050 LMP1 Le Mans race car.\n\nThe production version of the Toyota sports car, depicted above in an exclusive Autocar image, has been influenced by the exaggerated proportions of the earlier FT-1 concepts. It has a short front overhang and long, sweeping nose section, which houses a longitudinally mounted engine. \n\nAs expected, the detailing throughout the new car’s largely aluminium body has been toned down and refined since the appearance of the FT-1, providing the production Supra with a crisper and smoother appearance.\n\nThe two-door layout and liftback-style tailgate of the FT-1 are retained. Inside, the new Supra (pictured on track below) provides accommodation for two in the front, with space in the rear taken up by a shallow parcel shelf and a boot similar in size to that of the current Porsche 718 Cayman.\n\nThe Supra is planned to be sold exclusively as a fixed-roof coupé, whereas the Z5 is set to take a roadster-only bodystyle and act as a replacement for the recently discontinued Z4. The move is intended to ensure that there will be little or no cannibalisation of sales between the new Toyota and its BMW sibling.\n\nThe starting point for the new sports car pairing is a freshly developed platform engineered by BMW. It derives chassis components and engineering solutions from the current 3 Series and its various derivatives, including the rear axle and five-link rear suspension from the M3/M4.\n\nAs stipulated from the start of the project, the new platform has been engineered to support both rear-wheel drive and — crucial to plans to provide both variants with petrol-electric hybrid power — four-wheel drive.\n\nToyota and BMW have also developed a number of lightweight construction processes that will be used within the body structures of the Supra and Z5. Sources suggest the BMW roadster will weigh little more than 1400kg in turbocharged 2.0-litre fourcylinder entry-level guise.\n\nFor its part, Toyota has contributed extensive knowhow about hybrid drive systems to the project. Details remain scarce a little more than 12 months from the planned unveiling of the first of the two sports cars, the Z5. However, sources insist that each car will feature its own, uniquely tuned hybrid drivetrain, with electric boosting for added performance potential.\n\nDespite what one official describes as early work culture and language difficulties that are said to have prematurely stalled the joint venture during its infancy in 2013, both Toyota and BMW say their respective models are now progressing according to plan.\n\nThe BMW, which goes under the internal codename G29, will be pitched more directly than its predecessor at the Porsche 718 Boxster, according to insiders. To keep weight in check, the folding hard-top of the Z4 has been replaced by a lighter and easier to accommodate fabric roof. It is similar in construction to that used by the 2 Series Convertible and supplied by German soft-top specialist Webasto-Edscha.\n\nThe Toyota’s development is being overseen by Tetsuya Tada, the man responsible for the Toyota GT86 and Subaru BRZ joint venture. The new Supra is intended to add a further dimension in performance to the Japanese car maker’s line-up and the likelihood is that it will form the basis of a Gazoo Racing-run performance arm.\n\nThe Z5 (pictured above) will receive BMW’s newest engines. These include the latest evolution of its turbocharged 2.0-litre four-cylinder powerplant, the B48, delivering around 248bhp in the Z5 sDrive30i, and a turbocharged 3.0-litre six-cylinder unit, the B58, in the Z5 M40i M Performance with a similar 335bhp to that of the M240i. Both Z5 models will come with standard rear-wheel drive and an eight-speed ZF automatic gearbox.\n\nRumours that BMW’s M division is already working on a Z5 M flagship model are yet to be acknowledged by the German car maker, although the decision to fit the new car with the M3/M4’s rear axle suggests that it could readily accept either the 365bhp turbocharged 3.0-litre six-cylinder powerplant from the M2 or the 425bhp twin-turbo 3.0-litre straight six from the M3/M4 together with a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic gearbox\n\nA diverging strategy will mean that the Supra is offered with Toyota-developed drivetrains. Kicking off the line-up is a turbocharged 2.0-litre engine in two price-leading rear-drive models. In base form, the four-cylinder unit is expected to offer around 242bhp — the same as the engine used by the IS200 of Toyota luxury brand Lexus. A more highly tuned variant with close to 300bhp is also under development and due to be offered from the outset of sales, according to sources at Toyota’s R&D centre in Nagoya, Japan.\n\nA newly developed twinturbo 3.5-litre V6 petrol unit, which will be shared with various Lexus models over the longer term, will be the performance flagship of the new line-up. It will deliver more than 400bhp in a rear-wheeldrive version of the Supra. This range-topper will be the most powerful Supra to date and have an expected 0-62mph time of less than 4.0sec and a governed 155mph top speed.\n\nSecrecy surrounds the hybrid system to be used by Toyota. Early signs suggested the Supra would employ a similar system to that showcased by the 420bhp Yaris Hybrid R concept, with a turbocharged 1.6-litre four-cylinder petrol engine and three electric motors — two operating on the front axle and a third, integrated into the gearbox housing, providing drive to the rear wheels. However, this is denied by Toyota officials in Japan. Instead, the four-wheel-drive hybrid version of the new Supra is expected to run a 3.5-litre V6 petrol engine in combination with an electric motor housed within a ZF-engineered eightspeed automatic gearbox, delivering upwards of 350bhp.\n\nA similar set-up featuring a 3.0-litre straight six could also feature in the Z5. \n\nThe new Z5 and Supra will be assembled at automotive production specialist Magna Steyr in Graz, Austria — the same company that was responsible for the assembly of the first-generation Mini Countryman, Paceman and Coupé and will soon begin assembly of yet-to-bedisclosed versions of the new BMW 5 Series.\n\nBMW and Toyota are remaining tight-lipped about planned volumes, although supplier sources involved in the tooling up of the Magna Steyr production line suggest they are banking on a capacity of up to 60,000 units during the first full year of production in 2018.\n\nThe sports car project is just one component of a broad-based engineering and technology-sharing collaboration between Toyota and BMW. Other fields include fuel cell systems, lightweight technology and a lithium air battery project aimed at advancing electric car development.\n\n*2018 Toyota Supra and BMW Z5 - too good to be true?*",

      "text": "Toyota Motor Corp expects hybrid cars to make up 20 percent of its total vehicle sales in India by 2020 from less than 2 percent today, a senior company official told Reuters. Toyota, which already sells the Camry hybrid in India, plans to introduce hybrid technology in models like the Corolla and Prius sedans and could introduce it for sport-utility vehicles and multi-purpose vehicles, Akito Tachibana, managing director of Toyota’s India business said on Wednesday.\nThe Japanese carmaker also plans to work with its low-cost car-making division, Daihatsu, to develop clean fuel technology vehicles for emerging markets like India, Tachibana said, where affordability is an issue. The development costs of hybrid vehicles means they are out of reach for a vast majority of India’s first-time car buyers, which then makes it difficult for carmakers to achieve the volumes needed to bring down the price.\nFor instance, Toyota’s Camry hybrid is priced starting at 3.3 million rupees ($47,932), about 15 times the price of a petrol variant of one of India’s top-selling small cars. Toyota will work to increase the amount of components it sources from the Indian domestic market to bring down the overall cost of manufacturing hybrids, Tachibana said.\nSeveral Indian cities have high levels of air pollution partly caused by automobiles. Earlier this month, New Delhi shut schools, put construction projects on hold and advised people to stay indoors as part of an “emergency” plan to deal with dangerous levels of air pollution.\nAuthorities in New Delhi also began revoking licenses for diesel vehicles more than 15 years old which could remove as many as 200,000 cars from the city’s roads. Late last year, the country’s top court banned the sale of large diesel cars in New Delhi. “We think that hybrid and plug-in hybrid technology is the best solution in India,” Tachibana said, adding that this clean fuel technology is also needed to meet India’s stricter emission and fuel efficiency norms starting in 2017.\nToyota’s sales in India rose about 3 percent in the first seven months of the current fiscal year ending March 31, 2017, compared with the same period a year ago, according to India’s auto industry body the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers.\nThe number of Toyota vehicles sold for that period was 83,633, according to auto industry body data and Toyota’s market share was 5 percent. Total passenger vehicle sales in India rose 11 percent over the same period to 1.77 million.\nReuters \nThe post Toyota is planning to sell more hybrid cars in India appeared first on Tech2 .",

Hyundai managed to do this thanks to their Creta crossover which was launched last year in India. \nThanks to Creta, Hyundai India’s UV sales jumped from 31,049 units in April-October 2015 to 56,971 units in April-October 2016. This is a staggering 83% increase in UV sales for Hyundai India. Toyota India on the other hand, posted sales of 56,971 units in the same period this year, which is a growth of 15.7% against last year’s numbers. Below are the numbers- via ET Auto \nHyundai India’s CEO YK Koo has revealed that the Creta compact crossover has helped increase the brand’s average price tag per unit from INR 3-4 lakhs to INR 7 lakhs thereby improving the profit margin per unit. Though the Indian subsidiary is not as profitable as Hyundai’s other leading subsidiaries, over the course of time, the automaker has managed to establish itself as a premium brand in the sub-continent. \nAlso See – Hyundai Creta facelift debuts in Brazil \nThe biggest segment in India is the price-sensitive small car space where the profit margins are pretty thin. So, the Hyundai Creta’s stellar sales performance in the premium segment comes as a huge boost to the automaker’s financial wellness. The Creta also played a major role in Hyundai India’s growth of 16% last year when the industry grew only by 8%. The market share also increased by 1% to 17.3% last year. \nMoving forward, the CEO is confident of the SUV segment’s potential. Last year, 13% of Hyundai India’s sales came from SUVs, this year they are estimating the figure to reach 20% by the end of this year. The newly launched Tucson SUV will help the brand even further.",

      "text": "Toyota’s eco-friendly Prius coming to India in Jan 2017 Posted on by Bharat Iyer \nToyota has been at the forefront of hybrid technology for a long time. The Prius is pretty famously known for being an eco-friendly and tree hugging car. The same was introduced in India a few years back, however at the steep Rs 30 lakh price point, it didn’t see a lot of buyers. Now though, the market has changed with the coming in of the Camry Hybrid and the Accord Hybrid and people are now open to hybrids. \nToyota, in an event yesterday revealed that the all new Prius will be launched in January 2017. The vehicle made its debut at the 2016 Delhi Auto expo. They currently have something called the ‘Toyota Caravan’ going on where they are showcasing and talking talking about vehicle safety and alternative sources of energy (hybrids, etc). \nThe Prius, which is in its forth generation, will be leading that charge. The vehicle was globally unveiled in Japan last year. The new vehicle has been very radically designed and the looks may not be to everyone’s liking. The vehicle is powered by a 1.8 liter Atkinson engine coupled with an electric motor. While the petrol engine churns out only 96 Bhp and 142 Nm, the electric motor produces 71 Bhp and 163 Nm. Where this car shines is in the ‘Kitna Deti Hai’ mind set, returning close to 40 kmpl as per claimed figures. \nOn the inside, the vehicle features very funky interiors with a large 4.2″ digital display, coloured heads up display and a floating C-pillar that improves visibility, something that is unique to the Prius. \nThe Prius, when introduced in India next year will be priced between the Rs 30 and 40 lakh mark. Though it has no outright competitor, the price point will see it compete against its own sibling, the Camry hybrid and the Accord hybrid. While the Camry hybrid appeals more to the rear seat passenger, the Prius will appeal more to those who are looking for an eco-friendly vehicle to drive themselves. The other advantage that the Prius has is that it stands out as a unique offering, something that will bring in people will like.",

Yamashige said there is no change to that overall company policy. Most Read Stories",

REUTERS/Jacky Naegelen/File Photo \nNovember 24, 2016 \nTOKYO (Reuters) – Toyota Motor Corp said it aims to develop a new, more advanced electric-car battery “in a few years” that will allow the Japanese automaker to come up with an electrified vehicle with driving range and battery life enhanced by up to 15 percent. \nSuch performance-enhanced lithium-ion battery technology will likely enable all its electrified vehicles to be improved, Toyota said. \n“Lithium-ion battery is a key technology for electrifying cars, and there is a clear need, going forward, for improving this technology and its performance even more,” Hisao Yamashige, a battery technology researcher at Toyota, told a media briefing in Tokyo on Thursday. \nImproving the performance of lithium-ion battery technology is a pressing issue for traditional automakers such as Toyota and new entrants such as Tesla Motors Inc because of its limiting characteristics. \nProducers of all-electric battery cars, plug-in electric hybrids, as well as conventional gas-electric hybrids are all striving to source or develop more advanced battery technologies to give their electrified cars a better driving range, battery life, and safety. \nToyota, Japan’s biggest automaker by volume, has pioneered gasoline-electric hybrids technology and is gearing up to launch a new, near-all-electric plug-in hybrid car called the Prius Prime. It also has recently said it is aiming to come up with an all-electric battery car by 2020. \n(Reporting By Norihiko Shirouzu; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman)",

REUTERS/Jacky Naegelen/File Photo \nTOKYO Toyota Motor Corp said it aims to develop a new, more advanced electric-car battery \"in a few years\" that will allow the Japanese automaker to come up with an electrified vehicle with driving range and battery life enhanced by up to 15 percent. \nSuch performance-enhanced lithium-ion battery technology will likely enable all its electrified vehicles to be improved, Toyota said. \n“Lithium-ion battery is a key technology for electrifying cars, and there is a clear need, going forward, for improving this technology and its performance even more,” Hisao Yamashige, a battery technology researcher at Toyota, told a media briefing in Tokyo on Thursday. \nImproving the performance of lithium-ion battery technology is a pressing issue for traditional automakers such as Toyota and new entrants such as Tesla Motors Inc because of its limiting characteristics. \nProducers of all-electric battery cars, plug-in electric hybrids, as well as conventional gas-electric hybrids are all striving to source or develop more advanced battery technologies to give their electrified cars a better driving range, battery life, and safety. \nToyota, Japan’s biggest automaker by volume, has pioneered gasoline-electric hybrids technology and is gearing up to launch a new, near-all-electric plug-in hybrid car called the Prius Prime. It also has recently said it is aiming to come up with an all-electric battery car by 2020. \n(Reporting By Norihiko Shirouzu; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman)  ",

It also has recently said it is aiming to come up with an all-electric battery car by 2020.\n\n(Reporting By Norihiko Shirouzu; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman)",

The SUV is one of the nameplates locally made in Latin America that will be put to the test on the Five Continents Drive. Photo credit: HANS GREIMEL \nHave an opinion about this story? Click here to submit a Letter to the Editor , and we may publish it in print. \nEditor's note: Hans Greimel will file daily dispatches from South America through Friday. Come back to this space for updates. Nov. 23: Salta, Argentina. Elevation: 3,780 feet \nI inhale another gritty, bitter coffee, trying to shake off the jetlag as I sit here awaiting the arrival of the Five Continents Drive team to this picturesque Spanish colonial-era town. \nThe convoy of Toyota vehicles -- a motorcade of Fortuner SUVs, RAV4 crossovers and Hilux pickups -- should be rolling in tomorrow from Cafayate, a city further down the lush plains that gradually descend from the rocky rainbow-hued ranges and ravines just outside of Salta. \nThen, we begin our uphill odyssey into the Andes. \nDestination: the sleepy foothills hamlet of Purmamarca. \nThe team, with members swapping in and out for different legs, has been on the road since Aug. 22, when the 2016 trip began at Toyota’s Sao Bernardo plant outside Sao Paulo. \nDays earlier, they dumped the cars -– a Corolla compact and Yaris subcompact, a Prius hybrid and an Etios subcompact built locally for Latin America -- to switch to the all-wheel drives. The stretch ahead is rumored to be among the most rigorous in this year’s Five Continents Drive. \nBut truly, each bit of the trip was specifically chosen because it is challenging in its own way. \nThe South America drive spans everything from mud-bogged jungle roads and dizzying mountain switchbacks to jam-packed urban boulevards and busy cross-country highways. \nToyota’s employees are looking to see how cars perform under a vast array of conditions completely foreign to them as engineers, product planners and marketers back in Japan. \nThey endure air filter-choking dust, window-rattling crosswinds, engine-baking heat, bone-numbing cold, combustion-snuffing rarefied mountain air. The works. \nFor sure, Toyota’s engineers and vehicle evaluators test all their cars in extremes -- both on location from equatorial deserts to the Arctic tundra and at Toyota’s many proving grounds. \nBut the Five Continents Drive isn’t just for the car-testing pros. It’s for all Toyota employees, especially those who rarely get behind the wheel at work. And instead of spending a just few hours on a test course that purports to merely simulate road conditions, these team members do nothing but drive all-day long, for weeks at a time, on the real roads themselves. \nAkio Toyoda wants employees to experience firsthand the reality of the markets they sell to. \nIt's a priority born out of Toyoda’s conviction that “roads make the cars.” One of the Toyota chief’s favorite aphorisms, it means cars must be designed and built to perform on the roads they will run on. And to build better cars, Toyota must know the world’s whole range of roads. \n“Roads have a lot to do with car manufacturing, and the training of staff is necessary to make better cars,” Toyoda told me at a rally race in Japan before I left Tokyo for the drive. “When you compare test drive courses with actual roads or reality, you realize there is a huge difference.” \nParticipants are sent back home, be that Japan, the United States, Australia, Brazil or any of a host of other countries where Toyota does business, as evangelists of the push for ever-better cars. \nDrive organizers wax almost philosophic about the lessons to be learned.  What do we mean when we say, “The roads shape us”?  What is it about a car that makes someone think, “Wow!”?  What kind of cars do people around the world truly want?  What is a car? \nThose are the kinds of questions Five Continents Drive members are urged to contemplate as they wile away the hours on roads, boulevards, byways and highways in faraway lands. \n“First and foremost, it’s important to make better cars,” said Takemitsu Iwata, the Toyota general manager who leads the Five Continents Drive under the wing of Toyota Gazoo Racing, the carmaker’s global motorsports unit. “But it is equally important to make better people. This is a necessary investment to change the mindset of our people.” \nTomorrow, when I finally link with the team, we’ll see just how much that mindset is changing. Nov. 22: Intro to Toyota's Five Continents Drive \nHundreds of drivers, crisscrossing dozens of countries, logging 130,000 miles over seven grueling years. Welcome to the Five Continents Drive. \nIt’s Toyota Motor Corp.’s audacious gambit, devised by CEO Akio Toyoda himself, to reboot the mindset of the world’s biggest auto company toward making ever better cars for a new era. \nThe unprecedented idea is simple: Give everyone from bean counters and desk jockeys to lab rats and sales geeks time behind the wheel on some of the world’s wildest roads. \nFeeling each bump and curve in the seat of their own pants will teach them more about making good cars than twice as many hours cruising a cushy proving ground, the thinking goes. \nThe reality is a tad more complex: Fly hundreds of employees from around the world to some of Earth’s most remote corners to join a continuously rolling convoy of Toyota cars and trucks. \nAutomotive News Asia Editor Hans Greimel has an exclusive front-row seat to the spectacle as the first auto journalist to embed with the Toyota cavalcade. This week, Greimel rides with the Toyota team in the dusty, sun-baked foothills of the Andes mountains in northwest Argentina. \nIt is the third year running for the Five Continents project. Each year, Toyota ticks off another landmass. But the Japanese giant has been low key talking publicly about the bold undertaking. \nIt considers the drive an internal human resources exercise, not a PR stunt. The drive began with teams traversing Australia in 2014, followed by North American coast-to-coast in 2015. \nThis year, it’s South America’s turn, and the tour is tackling some of its biggest challenges yet. \nThe drive culminates in Japan, just in time for the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. And just like the runners relaying the Olympic torch around the world ahead of the games, Toyota’s motorcade will spend the next few years winding its way through Europe, Africa and Asia. \nWhen Tokyo opens the Olympics four years from now -- with Toyota as one of its biggest corporate sponsors -- roughly 1,000 of the automaker’s employees from around the world will have put thousands and thousands miles behind them on the Five Continents Drive, and hopefully learned a lot. \nWatch this space for dispatches from the field, as Toyota and Greimel test their mettle.

      "text": "TOKYO (AP) — Toyota Motor Corp. says it has developed a new way of observing the movements of tiny particles in a battery used to power electric vehicles — an advance it says will help boost their cruise range by 10 percent to 15 percent.\nToyota engineer Hisao Yamashige explained to reporters Thursday at the Japanese automaker's Tokyo office the complex method for tracking the lithium ions, which are tiny particles in lithium-ion batteries, also used in laptops and smartphones.\nIncreasing cruise range is the biggest obstacle for electric vehicles, especially because powering stations aren't as common as gas stations.\nToyota is more bullish about fuel-cell vehicles, which are expensive but can deliver the same cruise range as gas engines. Yamashige said there is no change to that overall company policy.",
