      "text": "Some people have criticized various design choices Apple made with its brand new MacBook Pro, but the company already announced record preorders for the brand new laptop. Phil Schiller addressed some of the MacBook Pro concerns in an interview last week , and said that the cheaper model is already a success. That’s in spite of criticism, or of the fact that it lacks the exciting Touch Bar found on the more expensive models supposed to launch in the coming weeks. Further reinforcing Schiller’s remarks is a report from Asia that says Apple is increasing component orders for the entire Christmas quarter. According to Digitimes , Apple is optimistic about sales in the fourth quarter, and strong shipments are expected to last through the end of the year. \n\n(more…) Trending right now: \nHey Apple, why are you trolling us?

      "text": "See full gallery on TechnoBuffalo Apple has high expectations for its new MacBook Pro computers, introduced just a couple of weeks ago.\nThe computers were met by critics who believe a MacBook Pro should have more port options and an SD card slot, however. Apple even admitted there was some controversy around the launch , which suggested that the MacBook Pro might not be a hot-ticket item after all.\nAccording to DigiTimes , Apple was “not initially very aggressive about placing new MacBook Pro orders,” suggesting that perhaps the company didn’t feel like there was going to be a ton of demand. That may have changed, however, because the same news outlet says Apple has pushed its partners to increase output of the new computers.\n“The sources are seeing an increased shipment proportion of Apple’s new MacBook Pro and they expect Apple and the related revenues and profits to all enjoy growth in 2017,” DigiTimes said, noting Apple feels “‘optimistic” about sales during the holiday fourth quarter.\nI’m still skeptical of the new MacBook Pro I’m still skeptical, though. The MacBook Pro with Touch Bar costs $1,799. The entry-level model will set consumers back at least $1,499 and doesn’t even sport the new Touch Bar technology. Those seem like high prices in a market where low-priced Windows 10 and Chrome OS competitors have flourished over recent years.\nPerhaps Apple and its suppliers have struck a chord with consumers who want more.\n\n\nSource : DigiTimes ",

      "text": "Nearly two months later, Apple's new iPhone 7 Plus continues to blow me away . This sleek new smartphone might look like an iPhone 6 Plus and an iPhone 6s Plus from afar, but anyone who owns an iPhone 7 Plus can tell you that it's an entirely different beast. This phone is fast — insanely fast — and I constantly find myself pausing to appreciate just how much power Apple baked into this handset. The camera is incredible, the display is practically perfect , and the battery life is fantastic as long as you opt for the Plus model and not the smaller iPhone 7. No phone is perfect though, and Apple's latest iPhones certainly have their flaws. Among these flaws are a few problems in particular that are so infuriating and ironic, it feels like Apple is trolling us.\nMUST SEE:  10 hidden iPhone gestures you probably don’t know about \nThere was plenty of positive buzz ahead of Apple's iPhone 7 announcement, but there was also a great deal of negative chatter. On the negative side of things, two complaints were sung far and wide. The first focused on the new phones' design, which recycled uncharacteristically Apple's iPhone 6 design for the second year in a row. Beyond that, rumors that Apple planned to ditch the standard 3.5mm headphone jack were causing quite a stir.\nBoth issues were confirmed when Apple finally unveiled the new iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus this past September, but the complaints slowly died down after the new iPhones were released. Just as we knew they would, of course. The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus design has been explained away by the hotly anticipated tenth-anniversary iPhone redesign expected next year, and there are several workarounds available for the missing 3.5mm headphone jack — you can use the included dongle, you can buy a third-party dongle that lets you charge and listen to music at the same time, and so on.\nUsing Bluetooth headphones with the new iPhone 7 or 7 Plus is the solution Apple seems to be pushing most actively, and it also just so happens to be the best and most convenient solution. At least, it would be the best and most convenient solution if Apple's new iPhones weren't plagued with Bluetooth connectivity issues.\nIt's so, so frustrating.\nIssues with Bluetooth connectivity when connecting to cars bubbled up immediately following the new iPhones' release, and these problems were very common. Thankfully, iOS updates seem to have addressed the in-car problems for most people. But there's another, far more problematic issue that I'm seeing mentioned more and more frequently around the web, and I've been watching for it because it impacts my iPhone 7 Plus as well.\nHere's a thread on Reddit from this past weekend that describes the problem. In a nutshell, audio playing on Bluetooth headphones connected to the iPhone 7 Plus often becomes choppy to the point where it's impossible to endure. We're not just talking about the occasional drop here, the problem is persistent and, at times, incessant.\nMore and more people are complaining about the issue, and I've mentioned it a few times myself.\nhttps://twitter.com/zacharye/status/784192042226384901\nThis problem appears to be linked to other operations on the phone, to a degree. In other words, the choppiness in audio playback is at its worst when the phone is refreshing an app or doing something else that involves moving data. Needless to say, that happens quite often. And there's more bad news: a Redditor in that thread notes that he or she swapped out a phone and the new one is still impacted by the issue. I have also swapped out an affected iPhone 7 Plus unit for a new one, and I can also confirm that the new unit is still affected.\nThe obvious irony here is that these awful Bluetooth connectivity issues are impacting the first generation of iPhone that ditches the standard headphone jack. Bluetooth headphones have grown incredibly popular in recent years and Apple is pushing iPhone users to adopt them... on a phone that has been plagued with horrible Bluetooth problems for many users.\nTrending right now: \nReport says Apple will release the iPhone 7 in a fresh new Jet White color Amazon’s 12 best deals: Lowest price ever on Echo, 4K TVs, Fire TV Stick, Christmas lights, more Amazon Echo drops to lowest price ever in today’s one-day sale See the original version of this article on BGR.com",

Michael Reaves / Getty Images Grabner, Vigneault re-united in Big Apple \nNEW YORK CITY — Michael Grabner laughed when asked to recall the infamous hallway incident when Rogers Arena was known as General Motors Place. \nIt’s funny now because the New York Rangers winger has reason to smile after having his checkered career rejuvenated with the National Hockey League’s version of the Harlem Globetrotters. \nGrabner was leading the club with seven goals and playing on a red-hot line with Kevin Hayes and J.T. Miller that exploded for 23 points in a five-game win streak before facing the struggling Vancouver Canucks on Tuesday night at Madison Square Garden. \nHowever, seven years ago in Vancouver, the speedy winger was making different headlines. \nIn a traditional pre-game soccer warm-up, the Austrian flash fractured his ankle on Nov. 1, 2009. He had been recalled the previous month to replace the injured Daniel Sedin and a week later, scored his first NHL goal. \nHe would spend most of that season with the American Hockey League affiliate Manitoba Moose, but if anything, he has proved to be a survivor. \nMichael Grabner of the New York Rangers competes against the Philadelphia Flyers at Madison Square Garden on Oct. 6, 2016 in New York. (Bruce Bennett photo/Getty Images) \nFrom the Canucks to the Florida Panthers, New York Islanders, Toronto Maple Leafs and the Rangers, there has always been a place in the game for a forward who skates as well as he does and who also has a quick and deceptive release. The Canucks were teased of all that before Alain Vigneault discovered that fateful 2009 night that the kid wouldn’t be playing for a long time. \n“I still play soccer to warm up,” chuckled the 29-year-old Grabner. “I haven’t had anything (injury) since then. That was a bad night. I was playing pretty good at the time and then you break your ankle and I was out for a month-and-a-half. It was unfortunate.” \nIt has been far from a straight-line career ascension. \nGrabber scored a hat trick with the Canucks on April 2, 2010 and added a playoff goal, but wasn’t projected as a future top-six fix. He was traded to the Panthers on June 22, 2010 — along with Steve Bernier and a first-round pick for Keith Ballard and Victor Oreskovich — and then claimed off waivers by the Islanders on Oct. 5, 2010 after a poor training camp and pointless pre-season. \nAfter five seasons with the Islanders, Grabner was traded to the Leafs and had but nine goals in 80 games. To say he’s in the right place at the right time — and with the right coach — is a massive understatement. You see it in his body language and hear it in his confident tone. \n“It’s sometimes how the career goes and sometimes it’s a different path,” he reasoned. “When I signed here (two years, $3.3 million US), I knew how they were playing would benefit my style — a fast-paced game. It’s been perfect from training camp to right now and it helped knowing Vigneault and Arnie (Rangers assistant Scott Arniel) from my days with the Moose. \n“Coming here has been everything I could have dreamed of. Even my billet from junior (Spokane) is from here and is pretty excited. I live outside the city for the schools, but we ride the train in and then take the subway, so I get the whole New York experience.” \nWhat has also kept the 6-1, 187-pound Grabner in the game is how he trains in the off-season. He does a lot of lower-body work — dead lifts, squats, spin bikes — to maintain his explosiveness and has been called a mad scientist for his willingness to try anything that is going to prolong his career. A break from the ice doesn’t hurt either. \n“It definitely takes a lot to keep it up and I do a lot of core work and different speed exercises away from the ice,” added Grabner. “We’ll see how long I can keep it up, but so far it has been working. It’s going to go downhill eventually.” \nBut not now. \nGrabner’s line has clicked from the outset and that nervous acclimation period to a new club never really happened. And when the goals started coming up and down the roster, it brought a sense of calm and lessened the pressure for the 14th overall pick in the 2006 draft to perform instantly. \n“The scoring has been spread out and it’s pretty hard for other teams to defend us,” said Grabner. “With our line, everybody brings something, and everything seems to be going in and it makes such a difference when you have that confidence. You just go out and play.” \nVigneault wasn’t sure what he was going to get when he put the trio together. \n“There’s no doubt that you’ve got a lot of speed with Grabs,” he said. “You’ve got a guy that likes to make plays like Haysey. And you’ve got a guy that loves to pursue the puck, protect the puck, hang onto it, come out of the corners, and J.T. goes to the tough areas. \n“Really, I put those guys together because one game we were short-handed as far as personnel. Didn’t think this is what I was going to get. Sometimes things work out.” ",

      "text": "Ben Kuzma: Ex-Canuck Grabner grabs share of Big Apple spotlight with red-hot start \nDaniel Sedin celebrates his goal. Bruce Bennett / Getty Images \nThe Vancouver Canucks got off to a promising start Monday night in Brooklyn, but in the end it was another disappointing result, as the New York Islanders skated away with a 4-2 victory . \nThe loss pushes the Canucks’ losing streak to nine, one shy of the franchise record as they head to Broadway for a date with the high-flying, division-leading New York Rangers, who just happen to be coached by Vancouver’s former bench boss, Alain Vigneault. That’s embarrassing. It’s like running into your ex and she’s hanging out with celebrities, and you’re alone, and your face is covered in chimney soot and Sriracha mayo, and also your leg is caught in a bear trap and you’re just sitting there, filthy and mewling. \nThe Canucks will need to put their best foot forward on Tuesday. I would suggest the one that’s not caught in the bear trap. \nBut while this game had the same outcome as the eight that preceded it, it didn’t have quite the same feel. For one thing, the Canucks scored first . \nUnfortunately, the Islanders responded just five minutes later, erasing the Canucks’ first lead since October 20th on a Jason Chimera goal midway through the opening period. In the second, New York took the lead, and while the Canucks were able to offer a response of their own, they were unable to do so for the pair the Islanders scored in the third. \nThere’s no need to dwell on the loss. We’ll likely have a fresh one soon enough. Let’s just dive right into tonight’s best thing. Emma Stone, you got this. THE BEST THING: \nDid you see the part where the Canucks led for five whole minutes!? Five minutes and 20 seconds, to be exact. What a treat! Wow! The Canucks had a lead for 5:20! \n— Stephen Hendriks (@Hendy111) November 8, 2016 \nIt all started with Daniel Sedin’s goal, as the Canucks’ backup Sedin caused a turnover at the Islander blueline, then dashed back the other way and beat Jaroslav Halak with a wrister. Here’s another look: Daniel Sedin goal, 1-0 Canucks pic.twitter.com/UpKcBaTngd \n— Stephanie (@myregularface) November 8, 2016 \nI’m not entirely sure how that shot got through Jaroslav Halak, but that’s neither here nor there. The important thing is that it did , allowing the Canucks the rare opportunity to play with the lead. As the rest of the game demonstrated, they need the practice. \nIf you think I’m making too big a deal out of the Canucks briefly being in front, well, you’re right. But this team has lost eight straight. What the heck else am I supposed to highlight? The way they stood up for each other ? They’re a team. That’s what they’re supposed to do. What’s the other option — they turn on one another, and start scoring goals into their own net? It’s been done . \nPlus, this really is rare . The Canucks came into this game having held the lead for just under 30 of the 720 minutes that comprised their first dozen games. Every other team has eclipsed 100 minutes at least. Least time with the lead going into today's game:VAN – 28:50 ",

      "text": "Apple is testing a new way to make emergency calls — this is so important Apple iPhones have long had an emergency call feature on the lock screen, in the event that you need to make a call quickly, or perhaps from someone else’s phone. Now, though, Apple is testing a secret iPhone feature which will allow users to make emergency calls in an even more subtle and expedient way, in case of emergency.\nInstead of swiping and dialing, the new feature will be activated when users press the power button five times in a row. There will be additional precautions to try to prevent accidental calls, but we’re kinda super into this new, protective feature. \nIt’s clearly needed, since it seems like every few days you hear about a new app to help alert loved ones or police discretely from your phone in case of emergency. And by enabling an emergency call with just pressing the button five times, it makes it something one might be able to utilize in the event that you’re not able to actually speak on the phone, or if you need to call for help but don’t want to alert somebody to the fact that you’re doing so. We hope that none of us are ever in a situation to need this, but knowing it could be rolled out is pretty comforting.\nThis function is only available to developers who have the iOS 10.2 Beta 2 update, currently, but hopefully it’ll become part of an official iOS 10 update soon!\nThe post Apple is testing a new way to make emergency calls — this is so important appeared first on HelloGiggles .",

      "text": "Follow About | \nAppleholic, (noun), æp·əl-hɑl·ɪk: An imaginative person who thinks about what Apple is doing, why and where it is going. Delivering popular Apple-related news, advice and entertainment since 1999. Apple’s new iPhone is the best selling smartphone When they can, the people vote iPhone More like this Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry Computerworld | Nov 9, 2016 5:00 AM PT RELATED TOPICS \nIn yet more proof of the disconnect between the Android-loving media and the iPhone-loving public, the latest data claims Apple’s new iPhone 7 models are the best selling smartphones in both the US and UK. The return of the iOS star \nData published today shows a 5.2% percentage point US market share increase for iOS during the third quarter of 2016 to 34.2%. While it remains dominant, Android share declined to 63.4% in the US. \nIn the UK, iPhone 7 and 7 Plus were September’s biggest-selling devices, accounting for 15.1% of sales. iOS accounted for 40.6% of smartphone sales, up 2.4 percentage points from a year ago. The iPhone SE is very popular in the UK, where it accounts for 8.5 percent of sales. In the US, it delivers just 3.5 percent. \n“In the US, the new iPhone 7 and 7 Plus models made an immediate impact, becoming the best-selling smartphones in the month of September at 17.1%,” said Lauren Guenveur, Consumer Insight Director for Kantar Worldpanel ComTech in a statement . \nThe data confirms the iPhone 6S remains the second best-selling device in the US in September. That’s interesting as 47 percent of iPhone users who purchased a new smartphone this year cite screen size as the main reason for their purchase. The Apple smartphone’s excellent camera technologies also drove sales, Patently Apple notes . Europe and China remain weak \nIt’s not all great news. iOS market share posted two significant declines, in Germany from 17.5% to 15% and in Urban China from 18.7% to 14.2%. The Oppo R9 has become the biggest-selling smartphone there. \n“iOS posted yet another year-on-year decline to 14.2% of smartphone sales in the third quarter of 2016,” said Tamsin Timpson, Strategic Insight Director. She sees some signals of recovery for Apple’s fortunes there. “Importantly, this marks a period-on-period return to growth in sales, up from 13.5% in the three months ending in August. Signs of recovery \n“With supply constrained on the iPhone 7, and particularly the 7 Plus, this positive turn for Apple is a good sign, suggesting that as supply grows to meet demand, Apple will be able to turn the tide in Urban China.” \nIt seems clear the last quarter’s seeming decline in Apple’s fortunes in China reflected the traditional pre-iPhone release slump we see each year. However, lack of new Macs and little movement across the company’s other hardware products combined with that slump to create a relatively week quarter, though expectations were, as usual, surpassed. Sayonara, Samsung \nSamsung’s decline continues as it faces the backlash of its exploding smartphones. The company posted a year-on-year decline from 36.9% to 33.8% of US smartphone sales in the third quarter, and is expected to struggle in the crucial holiday sales season. \nThat’s really quite likely, given the company’s other products continue to generate problems, it’s too early to tell how this will impact long-term consumer trust in the brand. Even today, Apple suffers the tarnish of the Maps debacle, this will surely be far worse for a company that created life-threatening devices. \nSamsung also suffered in Europe. While it accounted for 30.4 percent of smartphone sales in the UK on strength of carrier discount deals, its fortunes everywhere else on the continent weren’t so great. Huawei knocked it aside in Italy, for example. Happy holidays \nWhat makes the Android versus iPhone marketshare comparisons so meaningless is that while Apple has built a sustainable and profitable business on iPhone sales, competitors have failed to achieve anything like that . Google, meanwhile, is about to consume the market it helped create. \nIt seems clear that the smoke signals suggest iPhone and MacBook Pro will buoy company fortunes in the current quarter. Coming up next year? Presumably new desktop Macs potentially equipped for VR experience creation; and, of course, the next-generation iPad Pro. Apple’s decision to make refurbished iPhones available for sale via its online channels is also likely to be attractive to consumers, particularly in the event the company does not intend upgrading its still popular iPhone SE. \nGoogle+?

      "text": "Minecraft has transformed from a game into something more akin to a cultural phenomenon. The game has graced just about every platform out there, even making its way to the Raspberry Pi and the Windows Store as a UWP app.\nThe latest news now suggests that this game is finally making its way to the Apple TV. When Tim Cook introduced the new Apple TV last year, we were impressed by its potential as a casual gaming platform.\nPolygon reports that Tim Cook made the announcement at a corporate event. Cook added that the game will be compatible with the Minecraft Pocket Edition on iOS devices and that players can take their worlds on Apple TV and share them with other players on iOS.\nThere haven’t been many noteworthy games on the platform; those killer titles like Super Mario Bros or God of War that transform a platform from an also-ran to a must-have. Maybe Minecraft is that title.\nThe fourth generation Apple TV was unveiled on 15 September 2015. The SoC is an Apple A8 running at 1.5GHz (that’s a little faster than on the iPhone 6) paired with 2GB of LPDDR3 RAM and up to 64GB of storage. You can control the Apple TV via an iOS device or using the bundled remote with its in-built accelerometer.\nIn effect, the hardware can be favourably compared to the iPhone 6, making it a competent, casual gaming platform.\nThe post Minecraft will make its way to Apple TV later this year: Tim Cook appeared first on Tech2 .",

      "text": "Also today: GoPro shows courage in recalling all of their new Karma drones, Apple's new MacBook laptops are off to a hot start. More GoPro’s Karma drone crashes into a recall – but is there hope in the smoke?\nFollowing last week’s financial near-death experience with their stock, now comes news that GoPro is recalling ALL of its recently sold Karma drones . Following reports from users that a small number of the drones have shut off and plummeted to the ground mid-flight, GoPro is telling buyers to return the drones now for a full refund . Additionally, GoPro says that replacement drones are not in the mix – at least, not yet.\nA recall like this could not have come at a worse time: just before the holidays – you know a lot of those drones were going to be gifts – and right after GoPro had a dismal quarter that saw its stock fall by nearly half. Yet, we have to give the company’s leaders due respect for doing the right thing. Following the bungling of the Note 7 recall by Samsung, GoPro’s quick action is a lesson in corporate responsibility no matter the consequences, even if it kills the company.\nIndeed, while the drone recall is another gut-punch for the company, it might help it in the long run in terms of good faith and renewed sales from consumers down the road. GoPro said about 2,500 Karma drones were sold before sales were halted. So far there have been no reports of injuries from malfunctioning Karma drones, and we have a link here to get you started on returning yours.\nA new (but also really old) way to think about charging stuff up\nDespite solid sales of Apple’s new iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, the tech world continues to look forward to the iPhone 8, which will arrive on the 10 th anniversary of the original iPhone and is expected to be a radical departure from current designs, with an OLED screen, possibly top to bottom, a glass back, better cameras and so forth. But BGR is reporting they are seeing solid information that the phone could house a very novel wireless charging ability.\nBGR says Apple has been working with Energous , a tech outfit that is developing a kind of wireless charging system that charges the phone in your pocket while you’re in your house or at work, no matter where you are in the building for the most part. In truth, it’s not new tech or even that complex: genius inventor Nicola Tesla demonstrated such a system over a century ago. But so far, no one has incorporated the tech into a cell phone, and it could be a game changer.\nImagine your phone charging up in your pocket wherever you are: at home, work, on the train, in your car, wherever. More than any fancy new camera or appearance change, it’s a feature that could change the way we think about charging up our phones – or charging anything at all.\nApple’s new Touch Bar MacBook Pro is touching some stellar sales numbers\nMore Apple news now: the new MacBook Pro, with its fancy video Touch Bar, is a certified monster hit, according to Slice Intelligence.\nSlice analyzed data from over 4 million shoppers and says that in just its first five days on sale, it outsold the Microsoft Surface Book sale totals for all of the last year by a factor of four. Apple has also indicated the new laptops are on full hot, with Phil Shiller saying Cupertino is ramping up production to meet demand. Granted, there was a lot of pent-up demand for the new MacBooks after a four-year stretch of no real redesign, but these sales results are unexpected.\nWant one for yourself right now? Good luck! Right now, it’s looking like a four or five week wait for new units to ship.\nGoPro is recalling its Karma drone Returned your Note 7? Good, now steer clear of your Samsung clothes washer GoPro takes off with a new foldable Karma drone, Hero5 cam, and more",

White House making push to rev up charging infrastructure for EVs \nThe Obama administration has just announced comprehensive support for the shift to electric vehicles (EVs).

More > \nThe Obama administration has just announced comprehensive support for the shift to electric vehicles (EVs). In a White House press release the administration committed to steps that will reduce the United States’ dependence on oil, increase access to clean energy, and fight climate change by supporting EV deployment and the necessary charging infrastructure. \nBy Cristian de Looper \nProvided by \nThe tax debate between Apple, Ireland, and the European Union may escalate in the next few months. According to recent reports, the Irish Finance Minister, Michael Noonan, will bring the debate to the EU court, a move that could trigger a years-long court battle. \nThe battle stems from a European Commission finding that Ireland had been giving Apple tax breaks, something that has attracted a number of multinational employers to Ireland. The EU, however, has ordered the practices to change. \nMore: Ireland to appeal $14.5 billion tax penalty imposed on Apple, EU remains adamant \nAfter a three-year probe into Ireland’s relationship with Apple, the European Commission ordered Ireland to collect $14.5 billion in back taxes from the company. That is the largest state-aid payback demand in history. \nThe decision has been the subject of criticism, particularly from this side of the Atlantic. The U.S. Treasury Department says the decision is a threat “to undermine foreign investment, the business climate in Europe, and the important spirit of economic partnership between the U.S. and the EU.” \nApple has also vowed to fight against the EU decision, and those appeals will follow the ones already pending in Luxembourg, where the EU is headquartered. Those pending appeals include cases against Starbucks. \nOf course, Apple and Ireland will face tough competition in the European Commission’s Jean-Claude Juncker, who said that the ruling against Apple is clearly based on facts, arguing that the decision is not one against the U.S., but rather against unfair business practices. \nThe issues stem from the fact that Ireland’s corporate tax rate is currently 12.5 percent, however, Apple was paying far less thanks to a deal between it and Ireland that dates back to the 1990s. The deal essentially allowed Apple to record all sales as being in Ireland rather than other countries where Apple products were sold. In return, Apple brought thousands of jobs to the country. \n\nThis article was originally posted on Digital Trends Content provided by INFORMATIONAL DISCLAIMER The information contained on or provided through this site is intended for general consumer understanding and education only and is not intended to be and is not a substitute for professional financial or accounting advice.

      "text": "By Ben Levisohn The Dow Jones Industrial Average has hit a new high today as it builds on its rally following Donald Trump’s victory in the 2016 U.S. presidential election . The same can’t be said for the Nasdaq Composite or S&P 500 .\nGetty Images The S&P 500 has fallen 0.4% to 2,155.43 at 11:09 a.m. today, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average has risen 67.39 points, or 0.4%, to 18,657.08, above its all-time closing high of 18,636.05. The Nasdaq Composite has tumbled 1.4% to 5,177.57 as big tech stocks like Facebook ( FB ), Amazon.com ( AMZN ), Alphabet ( GOOGL ), Netflix ( NFLX ), and Apple ( APPL ) have dropped 3% or more today.\nInstinet’s Frank Cappelleri marvels at the market’s recent strength:\nThe SPX logged its second 1% rally in three days on Wednesday and rose for the third straight session. Now just imagine if that was the whole story…\nWe brought up some similarities to Brexit yesterday – the most salient being that the futures decline stopped just shy of 6% both then and yesterday. But Wednesday’s reversal was stronger early on, and it lasted all session long. The Brexit positive reversal didn’t fully take hold until two days later. With the S&P 500 up again early on Thursday, it appears this turnaround is indeed a step ahead of the game.\nOverall, the three day move is now +3.74% (through Wednesday). As noted in yesterday’s mid-day piece, this is only the third time in 2016 that the S&P 500 has registered a move greater than 3.5% over three trading sessions. The prior two occasions marked key trading lows (in February and June), which led to even more upside in the weeks that followed.\nYesterday’s advance finally allowed the S&P 500 to puncture that formerly pesky downtrend line drawn from the August highs, as well. And just like that, we’re less than 2% from those highs…\nThe discussion is endless… The bottom line is that we’re witnessing history in a multitude of ways this week. The market seems to have the backing to test its highs again soon…It also has the blue print of taking advantage of large three day moves near support… and positive seasonality.\nRhino Trading’s Michael Block isn’t buying it:\nI am keeping the faith and I am hopeful that Trump is good news for the markets and for the world in general. But this market swing seems like too much too soon. The transition is taking form, and in terms of trade, we are one irrational protectionist comment from Team Trump away from a violent reversal there. He campaigned and won on protectionism. Bringing jobs back. Does anyone remember this? Well and good but thanks to eight years of mollycoddling, our frenemies abroad won’t just sit back and take one sided protectionism from us lying down. This isn’t the WWE where Trump beats McMahon because that’s what’s in the script. There is no script here.\nAlong those lines, markets are assuming a united GOP here. But there WILL be deficit hawks pushing back on all the spending being anticipated. I think it all works but it’s not going to be a linear process. I see bond yields going wider and that has consequences. Of course, if growth doesn’t go back to what everyone seems to be hoping here, yields will come back in and the curve will flatten again. I also say that the Fed is too scared to do anything next month. Political uncertainty is going to be used as the rationale for “waiting for more evidence.” Write it down. That means lower for longer is alive and well and that means bonds look good.\nIn the face of what’s being called a “Trump Tantrum,” that’s being a contrarian.",

      "text": "» This Smart Scale from Qardio Goes Beyond Measuring Weight The smart device integrates with Apple Health (as well as with other Qardio products) and can be enabled to send notifications to a physician or family member Janice O'Leary November 10, 2016 \nThe San Francisco–based firm Qardio has made a practice of creating best-in-class health monitors that are beautifully designed, and their latest offering is no different. The QardioBas e ($150) is an attractive digital scale for modern measurements—not only does it capture weight, it also calculates BMI, lean muscle mass, and body-fat percentage, which are more significant numbers than weight for improving health. The scale greets each user by name with a smiley face and then displays the stats and stores the data in its companion smartphone app, where history can be tracked, goals set, and reminders scheduled. The smart device integrates with Apple Health (as well as with other Qardio products) and can be enabled to send notifications to a physician or family member. ( getqardio.com )",

We honor all the brave men & women who sacrificed for our freedom. #VeteransDay pic.twitter.com/6muFEDAspH \n—Tim Cook (@tim_cook) November 11, 2016 \n\nThe picture depicts the crowd in front of an American flag, and flags from all the branches of the U.S. armed forces.\n\nVeterans day was originally established in the U.S. in 1919 as Armistice Day by President Woodrow Wilson, and is currently celebrated every year on November 11, after a brief shift to the fourth Monday of October. It was modified to become Veterans Day in 1954.\n\nThe holiday coincides with Remembrance Day and remaining Armistice Day observances in other countries intended to mark the anniversary of conclusion of World War I. Veterans day is a holiday celebrating the service of all past, present, alive, and deceased veterans.",

      "text": "5 things that Apple killed and helped technology move forward 5 things that Apple killed and helped technology move forward Posted: Tags : Apple - Apple + Picks - Picks + Whether you like Apple or not, it's hard to argue that the company takes some bold risks and does certain things years before the competition dares to do them. The list of features, ports and drives that Apple is killed is probably longer than similar achievements of all its Windows rivals combined, but since we're a mobile-first website, we were curious to reminisce and look back at the things that seemed like a necessity, an indispensable part of the phone and mobile computing experience that Apple killed. 5 things that were considered inevitable before Apple killed them Of course, that is a walk back further down memory lane, back to the original iPhone in many ways, but also a thing to give you more perspective when you are contemplating whether or not Apple was right to remove the 3.5mm headset jack in modern times. Of course, the particular reason why Apple kills a particular feature differs, but there is one common motif: the company is doing this to advance the future of technology in the way that it imagines it. Here are the five key steps it took in mobile, the 5 technologies that Apple killed for this grand idea. #1: The stylus as a necessity Related dates and products : The original iPhone in 2007 with its multi-touch display and finger-optimized iOS Steve Jobs was an outspoken person. In a world of corporate mumbo-jumbo, he spoke frankly and without meaningless fluff. That's why you should not be surprised that in times when mobile devices featured stylus not for artistic reasons, but to control the everyday experience, he was short and adamant: \"if you see a stylus, they blew it.\" A huge part of the appeal of the original iPhone and then the iPad was the fact that both used a very precise multi-touch display that one could easily navigate with their fingers. Apple did the tough job of also writing iOS in a completely finger-friendly manner. This huge undertaking showed how much more efficient can a smartphone experience be. From there on, it took a couple of years for others to catch up, but eventually they did and the stylus-as-a-necessity concept faded away into history. Good riddance! #2: The 'button phone' Related dates and products: The original iPhone in 2007 with its multi-touch display and finger-optimized iOS Steve Ballmer's reaction to the original iPhone is probably the single most shared moment that represents the old versus new clash, the modern versus outdated. There, Ballmer, chief executive of Microsoft at the time, laughs the iPhone off and says that it will not appeal to business customers because it does not have a keyboard. Mr. Ballmer should have probably first used the iPhone more extensively before making a fool out of himself, but while he could ignore reality at the time, he could not ignore the consequences of reality a few years later. Then, Microsoft was practically forced to enter the market, which it did too late with its Windows Phone platform, with phones that mostly did not have a physical keyboard. These days, the concept of a physical keyboard on a phone feels antique and inadequate, and for most, it's also been a good riddance. #3: Software shipping in physical boxes Related dates and products: Apple App Store launch in 2008 brought the times of centralized, easy online app distribution Most of you, our readers, probably have never in their life bough a piece of software in a box. Ask most cool kids around, and they'd tell you that it makes no sense when you can just press the 'buy' / 'download' buttons on your phone or computer. Just 8 years ago, though, there were no web application stores that would sell popular apps around. Apple first introduced the App Store some 8 years ago, in 2008, and not too long after Android followed suit with the Android Market that eventually was renamed into the Google Play Store. Microsoft was the last to make its app store with the Windows Marketplace. At the end of the day, some 8 years after the original Apple App Store, it's hard to imagine going back to ordering software and shipping it in boxes. It's another thing that Apple killed and that was a great riddance. #4: Forcing users to deal with task managers Related dates and products: iOS released in 2007 signaled a world where task managers are no longer a necessity Computers back in the day were not something for the general public. We probably don't need to tell you, but some ten years ago, the worst thing about buying a computer as a gift to your parents or girlfriend was that you were effectively signing a long-year contract about also becoming their tech support. And this was no surprise: having to deal with task managers, terminals and so on is no easy task and for the computer illiterate was innerving and frustrating. Apple's iPhone bet on simplicity: \"in multitasking, if you see a task manager... they blew it. Users shouldn't ever have to think about it.\" The famous quote belongs to Steve Jobs, and these days is also repeated as a mantra for modern operating systems, including Android. Getting effectively rid of the need for dealing with a task manager is another great achievement of Apple in the mobile space. #5: Floppy disks, CD / DVD disks, etc Related dates and products: iMac in 1997 kills the floppy drive, Macbook Air in 2008 kills the CD / DVD drive Last but not least, Apple is known as the company that killed the floppy disk, the CD / DVD drive, and seems to be aiming towards the death of USB flash drives. The death of the floppy drive started in 1997, when Steve Jobs returned to Apple and unveiled the streamlined new iMac that has a CD / DVD drive, but lacked a standard-for-the-times floppy drive. The next big step came in early 2008 with the introduction of the razor thin Macbook Air, a laptop for the masses that lacked a CD / DVD drive. These days, some laptops still ship with a CD / DVD drive, but that's mostly seen as a thing of the past, a relic that the market has to get over very soon. Having lived in an Apple-driven world of less drives, though, has made us more comfortable with a wireless transfer system that promises to be the staple of future phones.",

      "text": "iPhone 8 Specs, Release Details: Apple works with FoxConn to introduce innovative wireless charging feature By Staff Writer Nov 11, 2016 11:29 AM EST CUPERTINO, CA - MARCH 21: Apple VP Greg Joswiak announces the new iPhone SE during an Apple special event at the Apple headquarters on March 21, 2016 in Cupertino, California. The company is expected to update its iPhone and iPad lines, and introduce new bands for the Apple Watch. Advertisement \nAttention iPhone fans! Apple will introduce a new form of wireless charging technology with iPhone 8. The new invention will let users charge the device up to 15 ft. Hence there is no need for them to place their iPhones on the wireless charging plate. \nNext year will be Apple's 10th year anniversary for the iPhone line and customers, and tech-savvy fans are expecting for the company to bring some biggest updates on their products. One of the greatest introductions that the firm could offer is probably the wireless charging. Advertisement \nFoxconn, iPhone's manufacturer , is currently working on wireless charging modules that would let the device be charged from a distance using a transmitter which is plugged into the socket with a received embedded in iPhone. \nWireless Charging in iPhone 8 \nApple has been doing experiments on its charging connectors since its first iPhone in 2007 that features a 30-pin dock connector to the lighting connector. With the upcoming iPhone 8, Apple is expected to introduce a new and unique way of charging their iPhones wirelessly. \nAccording to the BGR report , the company is working with Energous for the new wireless charging technology. Energous originally developed the technology, and it shows several signs that wireless charging could also work with Apple. Advertisement \nTesting the wireless charging Modules \nWhat Apple is working with its partner Foxconn is testing the wireless modules for the upcoming iPhone 8. With all the reports and rumors about the wireless charging modules, industry analysts, as well as the customers, have high hopes with the upcoming iPhone 8. \nThe wireless charging iPhone 8 will be completely redesigned with a glass back instead of the current design that features aluminum rear. Reports revealed that the rear glass panels would come from China's Biel Crystal Manufactory and Lens Technology. \nOther expectations with iPhone 8 include a new display size which will come in three screen sizes of 4.7-inch, 5-inch and 5.5-inch. © 2016 HNGN , All rights reserved.

      "text": "One Direction’s manger: ‘Spotify is the new Apple now music has moved from sales to streaming’ By Seb Joseph - 13 November 2016 09:20am One Direction's manager shares his view on the state of the music industry. \nThe greatest challenge for marketers in the music industry is breaking songs rather than artists in a “playlist-dominated culture” sparked by Spotify, warned One Direction’s manager Will Bloomfield. \nThere’s a huge shift in how people are engaging with the music they love now playlists are emerging as the frontrunner. Consequently, streaming is fast-becoming the revenue spinner for record label execs as seen by its dominance of the recent financial updates from Universal and Sony Music’s. \nBut that opportunity comes with its own challenges, many of which Bloomfield believes stem from how he and his peers break artists when people are more likely listen to them on a playlist against a myriad of others rather than the focused experience of an album. \nHe likens the paradigm shift to the one the advertising industry is wrestling with around understanding media, calling it a “move from sales to consumption”. \n“Our greatest challenge is breaking artists,” he explained at an event hosted by media consultancy ID Comms. “We’re currently breaking songs in our business world and that’s much harder and it takes much longer [for a potential fan] to buy into the artists proposition, which means we have to look at the trajectory of an artist. It used to be two to three years, whereas now it’s more like four to five years.” \nIt’s great for “discovery and chatter”, he continued but people are no longer “consuming artists in their own eco-system”. For, Bloomfield, its paved the way for “Spotify to become the next Apple” in terms of how its iTunes service irreversibly changed the way people consume music when it arrived in 2001. \n“If you think back to 2002 when iTunes unbundled the album you were in the artist’s eco-system; you were in their page; at least you were there,” he explained in contrast to how artists do not have that luxury anymore. “The industry said it was doom and gloom and how it is was bad for business but now you’re hearing those favourite songs in a playlists. You’re not even in the artist’s eco-systems anymore. You’re in ‘Fresh Hits’ or ‘Spotify Dance’ for example or whatever other playlist you’re listening to. We have to think about how we convert a song in a playlist into the next arena or stadium act.” \nThis article is about: World , Digital , Brand Seb Joseph \nHi, I'm the news editor at The Drum.

Matt Bingham finds five solutions Matt Bingham The Sunday Times Bowers & Wilkins P9 Signature \nYou’re not short of options when linking headphones to the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, despite Apple’s decision to drop the 3.5mm jack in favour of its own Lightning connector. The phone comes with an adaptor that translates Lightning into 3.5mm (don’t lose it: a replacement costs £9), allowing you to use regular headphones. You can also go wireless (remember to keep your cans charged) or use Apple’s bundled EarPods (tinny and leaky, as you will know if you’ve sat next to someone wearing them). If you want better audio quality and to avoid using an adaptor, you’ll need Lightning headphones that plug directly into the port. \nThe latest iPhones pass a high-resolution digital audio signal through the Lightning connector.

      "text": "November 14, 2016 90 \nApple's smart, useful Touch Bar makes it well worth splurging on the step-up version of the streamlined 13-inch MacBook Pro. November 14, 2016 86 \nThere's lots to like about the new MacBook Pro: its slimmed-down design, brighter screen, improved audio, faster graphics and disk speeds. But by doing things like removing full-sized USB ports, the memory card reader and even the Function row, Apple seems to forgotten how many of us actually work. November 14, 2016 76 \nI have little doubt that in a couple years, the technology Apple has been waiting for will arrive and this vision, or something closer to it, will be complete. Apple just released this machine too soon, or was too aggressive in the decisions it made. November 14, 2016 70 \nThe 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar offers a fresh way to interact with apps, as well as more ports and speed than the base model, but the experience doesn't yet justify the premium. November 11, 2016 80 \nThe 13-inch MacBook Pro is the best-designed laptop in the world, without question. But this base-spec model is unbalanced: it costs too much for how fast it is compared to the competition and it has too few ports. Apple will be hoping the version with Touch Bar is a more attractive proposition. November 09, 2016 70 \nAs solid as this entry-level MacBook Pro is compared to the aging MacBook Air I use day-in and day-out, pro users seeking a real MacBook Pro replacement will probably compare this model's specs and price against the Touch Bar versions and find them... November 08, 2016 70 \nWhich should you buy? As solid as this entry-level MacBook Pro is compared to the aging MacBook Air I use day-in and day-out, pro users seeking a real MacBook Pro replacement will probably compare this model's specs and price against the Touch Bar... November 04, 2016 70 \nThe entry-level version of Apple's 2016 MacBook Pro line is impressively slim and solid. But the battery life, keyboard, and (overly) future-looking ports are tricky trade-offs for a bigger touch pad and a brighter, more colorful Retina display. Read... November 01, 2016 80 \nThe redesigned Apple MacBook Pro laptop is undeniably slim and sleek, with a better screen and improved performance over its predecessor. But because of its sole reliance on USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 ports, you'll have to either update all of your old... October 01, 2016 60 \nApple claims 10 hours of battery life, and unlike most PC manufacturers, their claims are generally accurate if not conservative. In a mix of productivity work, photo editing using Adobe Photoshop CC and streaming video with brightness set to 150 nits... By mashable.com on November 14, 2016 \nApple’s redesigned 13-inch MacBook Pro is an excellent portable with power, utility and a one-of-a-kind Touch Bar that will make you the center of attention. By Ars Technica on November 14, 2016 \nIt feels like Apple might have a comprehensive vision for the future of its computers, but that it's only ready to show us a small, expensive peek right now. The sooner the Touch Bar and USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 can spread across the entire lineup and end this awkward transitional phase, the better. By Wired on November 07, 2016 \nEarlier this year, Phil Schiller stepped onto a stage on Apple's campus and threw some sick burns at the PC industry. “As we all know,” he told the crowd, “Windows PCs were originally conceived of before there was an Internet. Before there was social... By NotebookCheck on November 02, 2016 \nLive-Review // Brilliant, even without Touch? The new MacBook Pro laptops have arrived. The most striking new feature: a Touch Bar instead of function keys. Apple still offers a model without this novelty, and wants to target the \"entry-level sector\" –... By Ars Technica on November 02, 2016 \nYou can't fault longtime die-hard Mac users for being a little frustrated with Apple. In the space of just a decade, they've watched their favorite platform go from being the center of the company's attention to a minor line item . The iPhone gets...

By newatlas.com on November 01, 2016 \nThere's one 2016 MacBook Pro feature you're going to hear a lot about for the foreseeable future: the Touch Bar, an iPhone-like touchscreen strip that replaces the Fn keys, living just north of the keyboard. But if you don't want to fork over US$1,800... October 30, 2016 80 \nThe new MacBook Pro is an excellent ultraportable with a brighter display, more compact design, and superb battery life, but it's not the... By thunderbaylive.com on October 29, 2016 \nLisa Gade reviews the updated 13” Apple MacBook Pro that came out in October 2016. This is the base $1,499 model without the new Touch Bar.

      "text": "As part of its effort to expand further into wearable devices, Apple is working on a set of smart glasses , reports Bloomberg. Citing sources familiar with Apple's plans, the site says the smart glasses would connect wirelessly to the iPhone, much like the Apple Watch, and would display \"images and other information\" to the wearer.\n\nApple has contacted potential suppliers about its glasses project and has ordered \"small quantities\" of near-eye displays, suggesting the project is in the exploratory prototyping phase of development. If work on the glasses progresses, they could be released in 2018.Google Glass\n\nApple's glasses sound similar to Google Glass, the head-mounted display that Google first introduced in 2013. Google Glass used augmented reality and voice commands to allow users to do things like check the weather, make phone calls, and capture photographs. Apple's product could be similar in functionality.\n\nThe glasses may be Apple's first hardware product targeted directly at AR, one of the people said. Cook has beefed up AR capabilities through acquisitions. In 2013, Apple bought PrimeSense, which developed motion-sensing technology in Microsoft Corp.'s Kinect gaming system. Purchases of software startups in the field, Metaio Inc. and Flyby Media Inc., followed in 2015 and 2016.\n\nGoogle Glass was highly criticized because of privacy concerns, and as a result, it never really caught on with consumers. Google eventually stopped developing Google Glass in January of 2015.\n\nIt is not clear how Apple would overcome the privacy and safety issues that Google faced, nor if the project will progress, but Apple CEO Tim Cook has expressed Apple's deep interest in augmented reality multiple times over the last few months, suggesting something big is in the works. \"AR can be really great,\" he said in July. \"We have been and continue to invest a lot in this. We're high on AR in the long run.\"\n\nPast rumors have also indicated Apple is exploring a number of virtual and augmented reality projects, including a full VR headset. Apple has a full team dedicated to AR and VR research and how the technologies can be incorporated into future Apple products. Cook recently said that he believes augmented reality would be more useful and interesting to people than virtual reality .Related Roundup: Apple VR Project\n\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

      "text": "\nOne of the biggest rumors leading up to Apple’s October event was the possibility of new Cinema Displays. The event came and went and there were no Cinema Displays in sight, but Apple did team up with LG to create two external displays: the UltraFine 4K and 5K Displays.\nBoth displays come equipped with Thunderbolt 3 and make it an easy fusion with Apple’s new MacBook Pros. We got the 4K version in the office to see if it’s worth the price, or if you’re better off looking elsewhere.\nRight off the bat, let me state that this monitor is not pretty. From the inconsequential base to the boring black color, the design is incredibly bland. Second to its boring looks is its size. The UltraFine 4K display is only 21.5-inches, which is tiny.\nFor all of its shortcoming, the new display is still beautiful. Sure, the casing is boring and is quite small, but the colors pop and the pixels are non-existent. If you choose to pick one of these up, it will compliment the MacBook Pro’s Retina Display quite well.\nCheck out the video above to see a breakdown of the LG UltraFine 4K Display.\nSee full gallery on TechnoBuffalo ",

      "text": "Apple said to explore smart glasses in deeper wearables push Apple said to explore smart glasses in deeper wearables push Apple’s challenge is fitting all the technology needed into a useful pair of internet-connected glasses that are small and sleek. By: Bloomberg | Published:November 15, 2016 9:42 am Apple CEO Tim Cook is under pressure to deliver new products amid slowing sales of the iPhone, which accounts for two-thirds of Apple’s revenue. \nApple Inc. is weighing an expansion into digital glasses, a risky but potentially lucrative area of wearable computing, according to people familiar with the matter. \nWhile still in an exploration phase, the device would connect wirelessly to iPhones, show images and other information in the wearer’s field of vision, and may use augmented reality, the people said. They asked not to be identified speaking about a secret project. \nApple has talked about its glasses project with potential suppliers, according to people familiar with those discussions. The company has ordered small quantities of near-eye displays from one supplier for testing, the people said. Apple hasn’t ordered enough components so far to indicate imminent mass-production, one of the people added. \nShould Apple ultimately decide to proceed with the device, it would be introduced in 2018 at the earliest, another person said. The Cupertino, California-based company tests many different products and is known to pivot, pause, or cancel projects without disclosing them. Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller declined to comment. \nChief Executive Officer Tim Cook is under pressure to deliver new products amid slowing sales of the iPhone, which accounts for two-thirds of Apple’s revenue. In July, he expressed enthusiasm for augmented reality after the rise of Pokemon Go, a location-based game that uses the technology. AR, as it’s known, adds images and other digital information to people’s view of the real world, while virtual reality completely surrounds them with a computer-generated environment. \nThe glasses may be Apple’s first hardware product targeted directly at AR, one of the people said. Cook has beefed up AR capabilities through acquisitions. In 2013, Apple bought PrimeSense, which developed motion-sensing technology in Microsoft Corp.’s Kinect gaming system. Purchases of software startups in the field, Metaio Inc. and Flyby Media Inc., followed in 2015 and 2016. \n“AR can be really great, and we have been and continue to invest a lot in this,” Cook said in a July 26 conference call with analysts. “We are high on AR for the long run. We think there are great things for customers and a great commercial opportunity.” \nApple has AR patents for things like street view in mapping apps. It was also awarded patents for smart glasses that make use of full-fledged virtual reality. Apple is unlikely to leverage VR in a mass-consumer product, Cook suggested in October. \n“I can’t imagine everyone in here getting in an enclosed VR experience while you’re sitting in here with me, but I could imagine everyone in here in an AR experience right now,” he said during an onstage discussion in Utah. \nApple’s challenge is fitting all the technology needed into a useful pair of internet-connected glasses that are small and sleek enough for regular people to wear. Google ’s attempt to develop internet-connected eye wear flopped in part because its tiny battery ran out quickly. Google Glass, as it was called, also suffered a privacy backlash and poor public perception of its external design. \nAfter that disappointment, technology companies largely turned their immediate focus to VR and away from AR. Google recently introduced a VR headset alongside its Pixel smartphone, and Facebook Inc.’s Oculus VR unit has teamed up with Samsung Electronics Co. on a similar headset. Microsoft has the most public AR offering. Its HoloLens product shows holographic images in a user’s field of vision. \nApple’s effort may be more difficult because the chips, batteries and other components that will be available in a year or two may still not be small enough and powerful enough to build slim glasses capable of handling compelling AR experiences. \nHowever, given time, technical challenges may play to Apple’s strengths. The company specializes in turning technology that others have struggled with into easy-to-use devices for the masses. For example, Apple simplified fingerprint technology into an unlocking mechanism for the iPhone and took touch screens mainstream with the original iPhone. \nRead: Apple iPhone 8 could come with never seen before wireless charging technology: Report \nAugmented reality “is going to take a while, because there are some really hard technology challenges there, but it will happen in a big way, and we will wonder when it does, how we ever lived without it,” Cook said last month. “Like we wonder how we lived without our phone today.” ",

      "text": "Youtube Apple tipped to be working on smart glasses \nApple is considering an expansion into smart glasses market, according to a new report from Bloomberg . The pair of digital smart glasses are said to use augmented reality, added the report. \nThe report goes on saying that as per its sources, the smart glasses would connect wirelessly to the iPhone and showcase images and other content on to the glasses. The exact details about price and release date are not known however, it is expected that Apple could launch the smart glasses product as soon as 2018. \nBloomberg reported, \nApple has talked about its glasses project with potential suppliers, according to people familiar with those discussions. The company has ordered small quantities of near-eye displays from one supplier for testing, the people said. \nApple has showed interest in AR since a long time suggesting it is working on some project. In June this year, Apple was granted patent for a transparent AR device and a wrap-around display. The company CEO Tim Cook has also expressed interest in AR and VR many times. It will be interesting to see what Apple has to offer with its own version of smart glasses. Meanwhile, in Septemeber Snapchat unveiled Spectacles with built-in camera for $129.99. \nSource Author: Sneha Bokil Sneha Bokil is a tech enthusiast and is currently using Nexus 5X but she still treasures her Nokia N70 (M).

      "text": "Home / News / VR News / Apple is building a pair of smart glasses, coming 2018 – report Apple is building a pair of smart glasses, coming 2018 – report \nby Sean Keach Read Comments \nApple is considering creating a pair of digital glasses that offer an augmented reality experience, according to a new report. \nThe iPhone maker’s project is still in the “exploration phase” according to Bloomberg, which reports that the mystery wearable device would connect wirelessly to iPhones, as well as showing images and other information in your field of vision. The article cites people familiar with the matter, but doesn’t name a specific source, so we can’t actually verify this information, unfortunately. \nApple has reportedly held talks with potential suppliers, and has even ordered a small number near-eye displays. But order numbers are still low apparently, which would suggest that Apple isn’t ready to kick off production just yet. \nIf Apple does decide to go ahead with a pair of smart glasses, then one Bloomberg source said “it would be introduced in 2018 at the earliest”. But as we know, Apple has no problem shutting down projects even after heavy investment, as is believed to have been the case with the long-rumoured Apple Car . \nRelated: Oculus Rift vs HTC Vive \nThe move to smart glasses may seem like an odd one for Apple, but it’s believed that CEO Tim Cook is under a lot of pressure to deliver new products after iPhone sales slowed last quarter. As the iPhone makes up the lion’s share of Apple’s total revenue, shareholders are increasingly concerned that Apple hasn’t done enough to diversify how it makes its money. \nBut this isn’t the first we’ve heard of an AR pivot from Apple. Speaking to analysts earlier this year, Cook said: “AR can be really great, and we have been and continue to invest a lot in this. We are high on AR for the long run. We think there are great things for customers and a great commercial opportunity.” \nBut Cook seems less keen to shut everyone out in a virtual reality world. In October, Cook is quoted as saying: “I can’t imagine everyone in here getting in an enclosed VR experience while you’re sitting in here with me, but I could imagine everyone in here in an AR experience right now.\" \nAugmented reality is a tricky market to enter, largely because it’s so new. Google made an early stab at AR two years ago, with the introduction of its Google Glass smart glasses. But the ill-fated goggles were quickly shuttered, and Google quietly moved on to the greener pastures of virtual reality, with its recently launched Daydream View VR headset. Apple rival Microsoft has also entered the AR game with its Microsoft Hololens headset. A very different imagining than Google Glass, Hololens has been generally well-received by press on account of its more substantial software backing and high-grade AR. \nUnfortunately, we’re not entirely convinced that Apple will actually make the leap into AR. And even if it does, such a move could be years away. \nWatch The Refresh: The best tech gossip and reviews every week \nWhat would you like to see from an Apple AR headset?

Or you know somehow who hates Apple so much that buying them a design book with 450 pages depicting Apple products is actually the perfect prank. This book is what you need.\nThe book, dedicated to the memory of Steve Jobs and called Designed by Apple in California , showcases 20 years of Apple's product design. It features 450 photographs of Apple products. \nSEE ALSO: Apple’s new TV app is Apple's idea of TV \nFrom the original iMac to the iPhone to the (ouch) Apple Pencil, the book \"documents the materials and techniques used by Apple’s design team over two decades of innovation.\"\n\nImage: apple\nApple's head of design Jony Ive says the book is not focused on the company's design team product development. It is, he said in a statement, \"an objective representation of our work that, ironically, describes who we are. It describes how we work, our values, our preoccupations, and our goals.\"\nOf course, the book itself being an Apple product, it has all the traits of a typical Apple product. It's been designed with special care, printed on \"specially milled, custom-dyed paper with gilded matte silver edges, using eight color separations and low-ghost ink.\" \n\nImage: apple\nAnd it's not cheap — the small version (10.20” x 12.75”) costs $199, while the large one (13” x 16.25”) costs $299 (U.S.). \nThe book will be available starting Wednesday, Nov. 16, at select Apple Stores, as well as on Apple's online store in Australia, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, the UK and the U.S.\nBONUS: We played around with the new MacBook Pro — and here are our 3 favorite features",

The update includes several improvements and new features. You can learn how to join the Apple Beta Software Program here . All you need to join is a supported device and a working Apple ID. Once you have enrolled in the beta program you can easily download all the new iOS features before they're released to the general public. \nHere's what's new in iOS 10.3 beta 3: \niOS 10.2 adds two new screen effects to the Messages app. The second beta brought us the Celebration screen effect , and the third adds a new \"Send with Love\" option that allows you to send a large animated heart to other iOS users. \nThe Settings app now has a TV option that allows you to enable cellular data for playback, and set your purchases and rentals to HD or SD. Some blogs are reporting that the Videos app and widget have been replaced by the TV app, but the Videos app is still accessible on my iPhone 6s. There is also now a TV widget available on the Widgets screen. \nThe TV app has been updated with the \"Up Next\" feature for keeping track of television shows across multiple devices. \nThe SOS feature, which allows iPhone users to contact emergency services, has been removed from devices in the US. \nPrevious versions of iOS 10.2 have included new emojis, new iPhone 7 wallpapers, new Camera settings and more.

      "title": "Best smartwatch of the year",
      "text": "Best smartwatch of the year Apple, Asus, Casio, Fossil, Garmin and Razer share \nThe smartwatch remains a bit of a technological boondoggle for all but the most ardent fans of high-tech timepieces. But that has been slowly changing. \nThe first crop of major smartwatches, which arrived with the Pebble and then the Apple Watch and others, required a lot of fussing and didn’t always deliver the best experience. This year’s entries show a vast improvement in hardware design, software use and sometimes both. Where last year, I warned all but the most dedicated to steer clear of the smartwatch, this year I feel that there are enough choices and enough improvements to recommend the devices to anyone with the interest. Table of Contents Water Resistance \nIn looking across the array of smartwatches on offer this year, I’m struck by several significant things. Apple’s latest smartwatch, the Apple Watch Series 2, doesn’t do nearly enough to stay in front of the competition, though its operating system does. There are a number of fantastic, better-than-Apple Android-driven smartwatches out there, most of which are seriously hindered by Google’s antiquated Android Wear operating system. Hybrids — watches designed to notify and do a little tracking, but which usually can’t install and run new apps — are becoming a serious contender. \nWhat’s that mean for you? \nIt depends on the sort of phone you own and what you’re hoping to achieve with a smartwatch. \nThe Apple Watch remains the best watch for iPhones, though perhaps the belated delivery of an Android Wear update could change that. As much as I hope Google really opens the doors to Android Wear on the iPhone, I don’t see it happening, at least not yet. So that leaves you with the slick WatchOS and the half step forward of Apple Watch Series 2. \nIf you’ve got an Android phone, then you’ve got a lot of watches to choose from, though my current favorite is — and this is as big a surprise to me as it may be to you — the Asus ZenWatch 3. Asus came out of nowhere following last year’s bottom-of-the-barrel economy model to deliver a stellar follow-up that leads the charge in new Android Wear smartwatches. \nBut what if you don’t want a tiny smartphone strapped to your wrist, constantly buzzing, preoccupying your time and generally making you miss out on everything around you? Then you might want to look into a hybrid. I checked out two for this guide and liked both quite a bit. The Razer Nabu Watch, if you’re into the sort of look it delivers, is an odd beast with two LCD screens and lots of battery life. If you’re looking for something more traditional, I’d highly recommend the Fossil Q Nate, though maybe avoid the black-on-black design that made it so hard for me to see anything but the time. \nNo matter which watch you choose, welcome to the wonderful world of smartwatches; it won’t be long until you’re buying your second or third and maybe plunking down way too much cash for a smartwatch designed to mimic something straight out of Escape From New York . Apple Watch Series 2 Apple Watch Series 2 | Apple Price $369 to $1,099 Size 38.6 mm x 33.3 mm x 11.4 mm to 42.5 mm x 36.4 mm x 11.4 mm Weight 28.2 g to 52.4 g depending on case Display 272 x 340 or 312 x 390 Retina display Water Resistance A bit more than a day Sensors heart rate, accelerometer, gyroscope, ambient light sensor, built-in GPS Audio Digital Crown, Force Touch The Apple Watch Series 2 is a completely forgettable piece of tech. That is to say, like the watch, the smartphone, the computer: The Apple Watch’s complete ubiquity blends so innocuously into your everyday life that it’s easy to overlook. That ability to become an integral part of a person’s life without requiring major change is the earmark of a technology’s success. Modest but important changes, like the addition of waterproofing and built-in GPS, were delivered with the latest model of the Apple Watch, helping it to achieve that role of necessary, forgettable technology. Now Apple just needs to focus on design. When the original Apple Watch hit the market, it was easily the most mainstream-ready of all of the smartwatches on the market. To deliver that ease of use, though, it remained firmly planted inside Apple's walled garden of content. There were, and are, no other watches that rely entirely on Apple's operating system, and to get an app onto the Apple Watch a developer still has to go through Apple. Apple sets the limitations of those apps, and of how much of the watch's sensors and other hardware a developer can use. The result, then and now, is a watch that seamlessly integrates with the iPhone. But that’s no longer the exception; most of 2016’s new smartwatches are better integrated into the phones they use, and some are even more mainstream than the Apple Watch. Where the Apple Watch Series 2 refined an already solid experience, most of its competitors reinvented the wheel, catching up with or sometimes even outclassing the Apple Watch. Series 2 (top), Apple Watch Hermes (bottom left), Apple Watch Nike (bottom right) | Apple Apple’s 2016 line of smartwatches includes the Series 1 — which is essentially the original watch upgraded with an ambient light sensor, slightly stronger face and improved processor — and the Series 2. The Apple Watch Series 2 brings with it a much stronger processor, now capable of things like 3D graphics, built-in GPS, brighter display and waterproofing up to 50 meters, meaning you can swim with it. The hardware changes mean that you’re now more likely to keep your Apple Watch on throughout your waking day, including through a workout, a swim, a shower. The built-in GPS makes the watch a much handier device for walks and runs, and that brighter display smooths away any moments of wrist twisting that might have occurred with previous iterations as you tried to see what your watch wanted to tell you. The hardware additions, while useful in removing some of the original Apple Watch’s main downsides, do very little to push the device forward. I was most disappointed by the fact that Apple stuck to its odd little smoothed rectangular design instead of introducing a round body as well. Of course, that’s most likely because the shape and ratio fit neatly into the design ecosystem of Apple’s other mobile products, all of which are rectangles. And introducing a round face would mean having to introduce an entire second line of apps for the watch, something Apple is unlikely to ever do. The hardware, thanks to that faster processor, is definitely much zippier than the original Apple Watch, while retaining the device’s surprising stability. The biggest changes to come to the watch are in software, though — both in the changes Apple delivered with a massive update to the operating system, and in Apple’s tweaks to the rules it sets forth for developers. Developers now have access to much more of the watch’s sensors, and can now do more with complications, the little icons that can deliver information from an app to a specific watch face. Apple Watch faces | Apple The most notable software change comes to the user interface. The Apple Watch features a touchscreen, a push-button dial and a rectangular push button. You can also interact with it through motion. Previously that rectangular button was used to bring up a shortlist of your favorite contacts. It was a neat idea, but also wasted a physical button. With WatchOS 3, that button brings up a collection of what you have decided are your favorite apps. Those apps remain running in the background, so they’ll always be the most responsive of the things you use on the watch. It’s a smart idea that has a major impact on the everyday use of your watch. Other changes to the software include the addition of a \"Breathe\" app to Apple’s \"Stand\" app. I was, I’m sure, among the many Apple Watch owners who originally thought very little of the Stand app. But over the past year, I’ve definitely seen the impact it has had on me with its ability to get me up and moving. We’ll see if Breathe, designed to get you to take a moment to relax during the day, will be as impactful. The built-in workout app now includes more activities like swimming, and allows you to track up to five metrics, such as heart rate and active calories. Apple has also overhauled its Watch messenger, which now supports stickers and one-letter-at-a-time handwriting. Of course, the Apple Watch still includes a base level of notifications, which makes it easier to keep your phone in your pocket. But the watch can also do a few things when you don't have your phone around. If your watch is connected to the same Wi-Fi network as your phone, you can still use all of your apps. And if you're phone-free out of the house, you can use your watch to buy things, track your heart rate or amount of exercise, or even play the music you loaded onto the watch, through Bluetooth headphones. And with the loss of a headphone jack on the iPhone 7, I can see wireless headphones becoming much more common now. While I found the entire experience of the new Apple Watch much faster, more robust and friendlier, I’m still annoyed that Apple continues to block developers from creating their own watch faces. A wide array of custom watch faces is one of the main areas that the Apple Watch lags far behind compared to what you will find on virtually every other smartwatch on the market. Ultimately, though, the Apple Watch Series 2 still remains my smartwatch of choice. That’s chiefly because I own an iPhone. If Google were to create more robust ties between its iOS version of the Wear App and support third-party apps, I could see that changing quickly. Asus ZenWatch 3 Asus ZenWatch 3's eclipse design | Asus Price 45 mm x 45 mm x 9.95 mm Weight 55 g to 60 g Display 400 x 400 AMOLED touch display Water Resistance A bit more than a day Sensors None What a difference a year makes. Last year’s ZenWatch 2 was a smartwatch designed to be a low-cost, just-good-enough option in a market packed with pricey models. This year’s model, coming in at $230, nearly doubles the price of the watch, but also delivers one of the top Android devices on the market. The most obvious change to the new ZenWatch is its shift from a rounded rectangle to a fully round watch. That means the face doesn’t have the flat-tire look that chops off the bottom of the circular display and drives some people, including me, nuts. The new design isn’t just a change in shape, it’s also an obvious change in philosophy. Everything about the previous ZenWatches looked and felt cut-rate; the ZenWatch 3 is pure luxury. The face features a bronze diamond-cut bezel laid inside a stainless steel body, giving the ZenWatch the look of a solar eclipse. An Italian stitched-leather band disappears into two stainless steel cusps molded into the watch body. The watch has three buttons. The top is customizable to provide quick access to a specific feature or app. The bottom switches the watch into a battery-saving Eco mode and the larger middle button, which is bisected by a thin line of copper, is used for a variety of basic functions, like brightness boost and as essentially an enter button. Combined with the fully round 1.3-inch AMOLED display, the luxurious look of the ZenWatch 3 makes it among my favorite of all smartwatches I’ve tested. Fortunately, the guts of this watch hold up to the standards set by its looks. Asus ZenWatch 3 | Asus This time around, Asus’ smartwatch features a Qualcomm Snapdragon 2100 processor — a faster version of what last year’s model used, but more importantly, a processor that uses 25 percent less power. Combined with the watch’s Eco mode, which turns off networking and notifications, this can boost the battery life of the watch by more than 200 percent. That said, I found that the watch still only lasted me about a day of heavy use. As with most modern smartwatches, you’re going to have to get used to removing it every night and charging it. The good news is that the ZenWatch 3 uses something called \"HyperCharge,\" which can give the watch a 60 percent charge in 15 minutes. While the ZenWatch 3 comes with its own free Asus ZenWatch Manager, which delivers six custom themes and more than 50 exclusive watch faces for use on Android phones, the smartwatch mostly relies on Google’s Android Wear. The bad news is that Android Wear hasn’t seen much improvement since last year. The good news is that in theory, the increasingly outdated operating system is getting a major overhaul with Android Wear 2 early next year. Either way, iOS support through Android Wear remains even more behind the times than the base operating system — so much so that I’d say if you’re looking for a smartwatch for your Apple phone, you should steer clear of the Android-based ones for now. But if you own an Android phone, I think the ZenWatch 3 is one of the clear winners for the operating system. Unlike the ZenWatch 2, which was clunky and slow to respond, the ZenWatch 3 is a zippy device that is instantly reactive to your pokes and button presses. Coupled with the slick new design — did I mention it comes in a jewelry box fit for an expensive ring? — the Asus ZenWatch 3 is currently my favorite among the non-Apple-supported watches. Casio Smart Outdoor Watch Casio Smart Outdoor Watch | Casio Price 61.7 mm x 56.4 mm x 15.7 mm Weight Android with limited iOS support Battery Life One day to one month Sensors Other Tide graph, fishing timer, sunrise, sunset timer and direction, activity graph, and military-standard shock resistance Casio, arguably the creator of the smartwatch, finally released its own take on the modern device with a focus on outdoor recreation. Technically, the WSD-F10 isn’t really a smartwatch; it’s a smart outdoor watch, a sign that the company is taking seriously the mandate to focus on one very specific, relatively underserved segment of the smartwatch market. Casio has a long history of developing surprising, intriguing bits of technology; many of those creations end up getting strapped to a wrist. Over the years, Casio developed database watches, remote control watches, fitness trackers, blood pressure monitors, even a watch that helped Muslim owners figure out in which direction they could find Mecca for daily prayers. The company also released a popular line of game watches. Tracking elevation | Casio For its first modern smartwatch, the company decided it wanted to find a specific focus to help set it apart from the growing competition. The result is a chunky, resilient watch designed around ease of use during exercise and active outdoor activities. The watch is built around military-standard endurance tests, which means it can withstand a lot of punishment, from freezing rain and temperature drops to vibrations, humidity and falls. It also means that the watch is one of the bulkier smartwatches on the market, but it embraces that design with a simple aesthetic built around the oversized round watch face. The bezel is held in place with four screws, and it gently, subtly slopes away from the screen to avoid any issues created while swiping across the face of the watch. The microphone is tucked neatly between the watch and the urethane band. Three large buttons on the right side of the watch allow you to return to the watch screen, bring up a designated app or launch the watch’s unique software tools. The left side of the watch houses a round port for the charger and another port for reading barometric pressure. Significantly, this is one of the only smartwatches I’ve tried that makes use of a clever dual-layer display. The watch’s screen includes both a monochrome LCD and a color LCD layered on top of one another; the watch switches between them depending on what is needed. It’s a smart way to accomplish a couple of things. First, and most noticeably, it makes the watch easy to read, even in bright sunlight. The monochromatic display sheds glare in a way that it’s almost unnoticeable. The monochromatic display also cuts down on battery use, extending your battery life from about a day of active color screen use to nearly a month if you’re just using it as a standard watch. It’s an impressive feat backed up by smart design that recognizes that there are times when the only thing you want out of your smartwatch is for it to be a watch. When needed, the color LCD easily stands up to the competition, even outdoing many because of its large size and rich colors. I was disappointed to discover that the monochromatic display doesn’t include any sort of lighting, an odd decision for such a powerful timepiece. Because Casio’s Smart Outdoor Watch is designed with a very specific type of person in mind, the company didn’t stop with the hardware. Casio also designed several pieces of software, apps designed to highlight the watch’s abilities as a support tool for those who love to adventure in the outdoors. The tool button launches a watch face with a number of specific uses including a digital compass, which can also be used to set a bearing; altitude measurements, which can be displayed in a current number or on a graph; atmospheric pressure measurement, which can be shown on a dial or as a graph to track weather changes; sunrise and sunset times; a tide graph; and finally, an activity graph which breaks down the exercise you’ve done during the day by four categories. The tool button and those unique features help to turn your watch into a sort of Swiss Army timepiece, a basic tool that quickly expands to offer up a number of much more specific tools useful in the outdoors. The watch includes two other neat tool sets: activity and moment setter. Tracking weather | Casio Activity is a grouping of three different watch faces and tools that can be used while fishing, cycling or trekking. Each offers unique data for the activity at hand. For instance, the trekking tool shows the current time, elapsed time, traveling speed and altitude remaining until you hit your preset goal. The cycling app includes distance traveled, and fishing measures atmospheric pressure changes. The moment setter is used in conjunction with the activity tools to set up alerts for specific events happening while you’re doing an activity. You can use this to do things like remind yourself to eat or drink, when the sun rises, or the best time for fishing. The tool, activity and moment setter features all rely on a Casio app only available on Google Play for Android phones. That means that while this watch will work on the iPhone with some functionality, the bulk of what sets the Smart Outdoor Watch apart from the competition is only accessible if you own an Android phone and download the free app. Of course, Casio’s watch also supports the slew of third-party apps available through Google’s store, and includes 512 MB of RAM and 4 GB of internal storage. While I like the fit and feel of the watch, I did find it sluggish at times when using Android Wear and third-party apps. I also was surprised to find that while the watch is packed with measurement tools, it doesn’t include GPS. It also manages to, despite a large design and round face, still cut off a bit of the bottom of the display in what many people call the \"flat tire\" design. The saving grace of the Smart Outdoor Watch is that it doesn’t need to be particularly smart to be useful if you’re out and about. Those built-in trekking tools, along with some of the other abilities, like being able to get accurate barometric measurements and graph them, turn this smartwatch into something a little bit different from your standard wrist wearable. Add to that the inclusion of a low, low battery mode and that dual-screen technology, and you have a watch that can live up to your expectations or go to sleep and simply deliver the time. Now if they could work on getting that price down and maybe including a hidden LCD game or two... Fossil Q Marshal 45 mm x 45 mm x 14 mm Weight Android with limited iOS support Battery Life Audio Microphone Fossil is going big this year with wearables, really big. The company announced in March that it hoped to launch 100 wearables across all eight of its brands by the end of the year. The company’s approach to smartwatches, according to Fossil, is to start with the watch design and then work in the technology. It sounds like a smart idea for folks worried about the sometimes ugly look of a smartwatch, but given my time with Fossil’s devices and the latest crop of non-Fossil smartwatches, it appears that is easier said than done. Fossil’s name brand releases smartwatches in two categories: the full, touchscreen sort, and hybrid smartwatches. There are four Fossil smartwatches currently on the market. I checked out what appeared to be the top of the line, the Q Marshal. The loaner Fossil sent me was a gorgeous stainless steel design (you can also get the Marshal in smoke stainless steel, brown leather and black silicone). All of the Marshals feature a neat, easy to use tool-less watch strap system that makes swapping out compatible 22 mm straps as easy as pushing in two pins with your fingers. Sure, this means you need to buy straps that work with Fossil watches, but it does make a person more willing to change straps on a whim. The watch itself is a chunky affair, a timepiece with a surprising amount of weight and heft. The watch face features a rugged bezel, which unfortunately can’t be used to interact with the watch. The stainless steel bezel surrounds a 45 mm face that has a black frame encircling it under glass. The decision to not make the usable screen stretch to the edges of the glass is made worse by the flat-tire design, which cuts off the buttom curve of the round face. While I like the stainless steel look and feel of the watch, I was surprised that it is so thick, coming in at 14 mm, or 4 mm thicker than Asus’ ZenWatch 3. The four designs of the Fossil Q Marshal | Fossil Finally, the design is wrapped up with a single crown on its side, though oddly, while the shape and appearance of the crown makes it look like it will twist, it’s simply a push button. It’s these sorts of design decisions — a single-button, flat-tire screen, unsightly thickness — that ultimately undermine any argument Fossil might be trying to make with design first, technology second. Like the ZenWatch 3, the Marshal uses a Qualcomm Snapdragon 2100 processor, giving it a longer battery life than many of last year’s models, and a much snappier response time. The Marshal includes an array of custom Fossil watch faces, but for the most part relies entirely on Google’s increasingly dated Android Wear. During my time with the watch, I liked its physical design — though it is slightly too thick for my tastes — but found the day-to-day use of the watch acceptable at best. Having to rely on a single button and the touchscreen is disappointing when compared to the array of other input methods other watches offer, from multiple buttons to digital crowns to a rotating bezel. The Marshal also lacks a heart rate sensor and any form of built-in GPS, and you can’t swim with it on. One could certainly argue that’s because it’s a watch obviously not designed for working out, but those are the sorts of features increasingly becoming the norm with smartwatches. There’s just too much missing from a technology point of view for the stylish, yet flawed, aesthetic design of the watch to make up for. If you’re in the market for a smartwatch that doesn’t look like a smartwatch, this isn’t it. If you’re looking for a high end, classy tech-packed smartwatch, this isn’t it either. Fossil Q Nate 55.4 mm x 45 mm x 13.5 mm Weight Other Vibration Fossil delivered two sorts of new smartwatches to the market this year. The more traditional touchscreen smartwatches didn’t quite land for me, but what about the company’s hybrid smartwatches? Hybrid smartwatches are an interesting category. They strive to work and look like traditional watches, delivering days or weeks or months of battery life on a single charge or battery, while still trying to offer some high-tech solutions like notifications from your phone or activity tracking. Fossil’s take on the hybrid is meant to look like a watch and act like a smartwatch. That means, according to Fossil, that it uses standard batteries, which deliver about six months of life, and features built-in activity tracking, some notifications and multiple time zones. Look at that hand go | Fossil The company sent us a Q Nate hybrid black stainless steel smartwatch to test out. The watch features a black stainless steel link bracelet that uses the same easy, tool-less interchangeable straps as the Q Marshal. The body is also black stainless steel with a rugged bezel, two buttons on the right side of the watch and a third functioning crown that can double as a button. Coming in with a larger case than the Marshal and an ever-so-slightly thinner design, the Nate is a much more aesthetically pleasing watch for me. Unfortunately, this particular design has one major flaw. The traditional face of the watch is black with gray numbers, lettering and markers, and it has no light source. That means, with my perhaps aging eyes, I struggle to see much of anything on the watch beyond the current time. This is exacerbated by the fact that the watch has no backlight. Fortunately, the Nate comes in three colors, including a more traditional stainless steel with white lettering and numbers. Fossil Q Nate | Fossil Why does it matter whether I can see anything beyond the big and little hands? Because this is a smartwatch of sorts, and a very cleverly designed one to boot. The Nate has built into its very traditional design just the right amount of tech to keep you informed, but not constantly tinkering with your watch. For instance, it includes the ability to track your steps, general activity and sleep. You can also set the bottom button to one of four actions: ring your phone, take a picture, track a pre-established goal or control your music. Once selected, a press of that button triggers the action. The watch also has a really interesting way of subtly alerting you to notifications from up to six apps and six contacts. When you receive an alert from any of the people or apps you selected, the watch buzzes, and the hands on the watch move to the hour marker you selected. So, if I can only keep straight the fact that my son Tristan is two and my wife is one, I know when the watch buzzes and the hands swing to one, who just texted me. It’s a really neat way to help you filter out your day without reading every single thing that comes your way. Pressing the bottom button shows the date by swinging both hands to the correct number. The crown, also a button, allows you to toggle between time zones, your alarm and the last alert you received. All of this is managed through an app that works equally well on Android and iOS. You use the app to set up the notifications, your extra time zone and — my personal favorite — to create custom goals. You'll need good eyes | Fossil As I mentioned earlier, the bottom button can be tied to one of four different actions. One of those actions allows you to track your progress toward a goal. You go into the app and create a new goal, and then activate it so that a press of the bottom button tracks you having achieved one part of that goal. In my case, I decided to create a goal that I would drink a glass of water eight times a day, which is about the recommended amount. Now, every time I drink a glass of water, I simply press the bottom button and it marks it. When I hit all eight, the app lets me know with a message. It’s super basic stuff, but also the sort of thing you’re pretty likely to use. During my time with the watch, I found myself missing some of the deeper connections that the more powerful smartwatches deliver. That said, the Nate Q is certainly the sort of watch I could see myself wearing out on a night when I’m not interested in being disturbed, but do want to know when someone important, like my son, is trying to reach me. Where Fossil’s design-first philosophy fails in its smartwatches, that approach helped to create a wonderful hybrid device. Garmin Fenix 3 HR Garmin Fenix 3 HR | Garmin Price 51.5 mm x 51.5 mm x 16 mm Weight Android and iOS with Garmin app and store Battery Life 16 hours to two weeks Sensors GPS/GLONASS, barometric, compass, heart rate Audio Other Advanced fitness training features, outdoor navigation features, wide variety of exercise profiles \nGarmin’s Fenix 3 HR smartwatch may be both my favorite and the most frustrating watch I’ve ever tested. \nThe Fenix 3 HR is a chunky, solid piece of tech that looks like the sort of gadget you’d take into the wilderness to increase your odds of survival. And in many ways that’s exactly what it is. Packed with an abundance of sensors (GPS/GLONASS, barometric, compass, heart rate, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, ANT), 10 atm water resistance and a surprisingly long battery life that can squeeze out two weeks, this is the sort of watch you’d want on your wrist when you go camping. \nIts relatively sleek design also means that it looks just as fine on the wrist of someone willing to sport a G-Shock every day. It also runs equally well on Android and iOS, forgoing both app stores for its own modest yet meaningful store of first- and third-party watch creations. \nBut in an attempt to do so much on so small a device, Garmin manages to gum up the experience itself, making even the most basic of tweaks to the watch the sort of lengthy, button-pushing experience that will stop you in your mountain-hiking tracks. Heart rate chart | Garmin \nAs with Casio’s outdoor-centric smartwatch, the Fenix 3 HR features a PVD-stainless steel bezel and buttons encircling a sapphire-lens round watch face. The watch doesn’t support touch controls, but the five buttons give you plenty of ways to interact with it … maybe too many. The screen uses a high-resolution color display with LED backlighting, which makes for great visibility at night, inside or even in bright sunlight. Most noticeable, though, is the watch’s long battery life. With normal settings and the GPS on, it manages 16 or so hours. You can get 40 hours by using a mode that auto-switches the GPS on and off when needed, or two weeks if you’re just using the smartwatch mode. \nUnfortunately, the watch has neither a microphone nor a speaker. The more you dive into the device, the more clear that becomes. The Fenix 3 HR is designed with sports and activity in mind first. That means even with the support of add-on apps, you’re not going to find a lot of the abilities you might have come to expect with less focused smartwatches. \nThere is no way to store music on the watch or check Twitter, Facebook or email, for instance. While there are a number of games, there are very few general apps that aren’t designed around an activity. Instead, you’ll find a wide assortment of robust hiking, swimming, biking, triathlon, skiing, rowing and golfing apps. Because the watch measures heart rate, and can track and graph it right on your watch face, you’ll also find a lot of heart rate data apps. The watch is, in general, very good at saving, presenting and reusing data. \nWhere Casio’s first smartwatch is obviously activity-centric, it still feels like you’re using a watch. The Fenix 3 delivers the sort of performance that you’d expect from a computer or trainer. With the help of an add-on, for instance, it can gauge the degree of bounce in your step, measure your running symmetry and air time, and look at cadence and stride length. It can even track your stress levels while you’re working out and alert you to your lactate threshold (when your muscles are basically exhausted). It’s an impressive array of technology packed into a device that doesn’t stand out much on your wrist. \nThe Fenix 3’s sheer volume of features and apps is also, to some degree, the watch’s downfall. The menu system, all controlled with the watch's five buttons, is contorted, confused and often time-consuming. If, for instance, I want to switch to a new watch face using my watch and not the app, I have to press and hold the middle left button to bring up a menu, press the top right button to select settings, press the bottom left to scroll down to watch faces, and then press the top right button twice to first select that and then select the sort of watch face I want. Then, I use the left middle and left bottom buttons to scroll up and down through the list of faces, and press the top right button to select my choice. From there, I have to either manually back out with several presses of the bottom right button, or just hold the bottom left button to return to the home screen on my watch. Heart rate sensor | Garmin \nI have to confess, I’ve discovered that between switching watches and just my regular busy, often hectic day, I lack the mental acuity, dexterity and memory to not screw this process up at least once almost every single time. That’s a minimum of once. It’s not unusual for me to spend a minute or two staring at my watch in frustration and saying awful things about it as I go through the button pressing like it’s some sort of technological incantation. \nThe complexity of the watch doesn’t stop with navigating its user interface, unfortunately. Everything about this watch seems unnecessarily confusing at times. \nWhere most watches provide downloadable apps, the Fenix 3 lets you download apps, watch faces, widgets and data fields. The distinctions between some of these downloads are still relatively lost on me, but they’re all grabbed using your computer or the smartphone app from Garmin’s Connect IQ Store. \nThe buttons of the device are a bit less than intuitive as well. The top left button is your power and light button. The middle left is your up button, but is also used to bring up the menu with a long press. The bottom left is your down button, but a long press also returns you to the watch’s home screen. The top right is the start/stop/reset button, which also serves as essentially the enter button in a menu. The bottom right is the lap button, and the back button in menus. \nThere is the ability to select what long presses do on the two right buttons, but the options are oddly minimal. For instance, you can’t set either button to bring up the watch faces or apps, which seem like they could be the two most common functions for some types of users. Instead you can choose to, for instance, have a long press on the top button launch a Wi-Fi sync and a long press on the bottom button launch GPS. \nOn the one hand, Garmin makes up for this by offering all of the downloads for the watch for free and even opening up the development software and the store to third parties, who are free to create their own apps. But on the other, the storage on the watch dedicated to apps and watch faces is strikingly low. It offers just 32 MB, compared to, say, the 4 GB found in the Casio. \nDespite all of the negativity I just heaped on the Fenix 3 HR, I remain blown away by its battery efficiency, design and utility in a very focused area. I don’t see this smartwatch becoming my daily device — in fact, I took it on a trip to Italy and hardly used it, because it lacked a lot of the apps I like to use from my wrist when traveling — but I can see it becoming my go-to device for workouts, hiking and the like. \nMy personal love of watches and desire to get the most out of wearable tech leads me to believe that this sort of very focused approach to smartwatches may become more popular as the technology and its popularity broaden. \nPut another way, Garmin seems to have set out to build the perfect activity smartwatch, and the company has come very close with the tech on hand. Garmin also helped push forward the argument for owning not just one smartwatch but several, each designed with specific duties or functions in mind. Razer Nabu Watch",

      "text": "In addition to that new iPhone 7, that new MacBook Pro and that upgraded Apple TV, here’s something else from Cupertino to slip under the Christmas tree this year:\nA $299 coffee table book about Apple design over the decades, jammed with 450 photographs of their biggest and bestest hits. The tome, entitled Designed by Apple in California, was announced today and goes on sale tomorrow at Apple.com and at select Apple Stores.\nShow Caption of\nExpand\nIn its press release, Apple made a point to say that the book is dedicated to the memory of co-founder Steve Jobs. And the work covers many of the products unveiled during his time as CEO, from 1998’s iMac to 2015’s Apple Pencil, and it includes details about the techniques and materials used by Apple’s design team through those years.\n“The idea of genuinely trying to make something great for humanity was Steve’s motivation from the beginning, and it remains both our ideal and our goal as Apple looks to the future,” said Jony Ive, Apple’s chief design officer. “This archive is intended to be a gentle gathering of many of the products the team has designed over the years. We hope it brings some understanding to how and why they exist, while serving as a resource for students of all design disciplines.” Related Articles Apple unveils new Mac notebooks First Edition: iPhone 7 review; Airbnb fights regulations; more Apple launches updated MacBook Pro and iMac\nThe products in this book are the result of a profoundly close collaboration among many different groups. Shot by photographer Andrew Zuckerman in a deliberately spare style, the book’s 450 images illustrate Apple’s design process as well as its finished products.\nIn the book’s foreword, Ive explains:\n“While this is a design book, it is not about the design team, the creative process, or product development. It is an objective representation of our work that, ironically, describes who we are. It describes how we work, our values, our preoccupations, and our goals. We have always hoped to be defined by what we do rather than by what we say.",

      "text": "Best smartwatch of the year Apple, Asus, Casio, Fossil, Garmin and Razer share \nThe smartwatch remains a bit of a technological boondoggle for all but the most ardent fans of high-tech timepieces. But that has been slowly changing. \nThe first crop of major smartwatches, which arrived with the Pebble and then the Apple Watch and others, required a lot of fussing and didn’t always deliver the best experience. This year’s entries show a vast improvement in hardware design, software use and sometimes both. Where last year, I warned all but the most dedicated to steer clear of the smartwatch, this year I feel that there are enough choices and enough improvements to recommend the devices to anyone with the interest. Table of Contents Water Resistance \nIn looking across the array of smartwatches on offer this year, I’m struck by several significant things. Apple’s latest smartwatch, the Apple Watch Series 2, doesn’t do nearly enough to stay in front of the competition, though its operating system does. There are a number of fantastic, better-than-Apple Android-driven smartwatches out there, most of which are seriously hindered by Google’s antiquated Android Wear operating system. Hybrids — watches designed to notify and do a little tracking, but which usually can’t install and run new apps — are becoming a serious contender. \nWhat’s that mean for you? \nIt depends on the sort of phone you own and what you’re hoping to achieve with a smartwatch. \nThe Apple Watch remains the best watch for iPhones, though perhaps the belated delivery of an Android Wear update could change that. As much as I hope Google really opens the doors to Android Wear on the iPhone, I don’t see it happening, at least not yet. So that leaves you with the slick WatchOS and the half step forward of Apple Watch Series 2. \nIf you’ve got an Android phone, then you’ve got a lot of watches to choose from, though my current favorite is — and this is as big a surprise to me as it may be to you — the Asus ZenWatch 3. Asus came out of nowhere following last year’s bottom-of-the-barrel economy model to deliver a stellar follow-up that leads the charge in new Android Wear smartwatches. \nBut what if you don’t want a tiny smartphone strapped to your wrist, constantly buzzing, preoccupying your time and generally making you miss out on everything around you? Then you might want to look into a hybrid. I checked out two for this guide and liked both quite a bit. The Razer Nabu Watch, if you’re into the sort of look it delivers, is an odd beast with two LCD screens and lots of battery life. If you’re looking for something more traditional, I’d highly recommend the Fossil Q Nate, though maybe avoid the black-on-black design that made it so hard for me to see anything but the time. \nNo matter which watch you choose, welcome to the wonderful world of smartwatches; it won’t be long until you’re buying your second or third and maybe plunking down way too much cash for a smartwatch designed to mimic something straight out of Escape From New York . Apple Watch Series 2 Apple Watch Series 2 | Apple Price $369 to $1,099 Size 38.6 mm x 33.3 mm x 11.4 mm to 42.5 mm x 36.4 mm x 11.4 mm Weight 28.2 g to 52.4 g depending on case Display 272 x 340 or 312 x 390 Retina display Water Resistance A bit more than a day Sensors heart rate, accelerometer, gyroscope, ambient light sensor, built-in GPS Audio Digital Crown, Force Touch The Apple Watch Series 2 is a completely forgettable piece of tech. That is to say, like the watch, the smartphone, the computer: The Apple Watch’s complete ubiquity blends so innocuously into your everyday life that it’s easy to overlook. That ability to become an integral part of a person’s life without requiring major change is the earmark of a technology’s success. Modest but important changes, like the addition of waterproofing and built-in GPS, were delivered with the latest model of the Apple Watch, helping it to achieve that role of necessary, forgettable technology. Now Apple just needs to focus on design. When the original Apple Watch hit the market, it was easily the most mainstream-ready of all of the smartwatches on the market. To deliver that ease of use, though, it remained firmly planted inside Apple's walled garden of content. There were, and are, no other watches that rely entirely on Apple's operating system, and to get an app onto the Apple Watch a developer still has to go through Apple. Apple sets the limitations of those apps, and of how much of the watch's sensors and other hardware a developer can use. The result, then and now, is a watch that seamlessly integrates with the iPhone. But that’s no longer the exception; most of 2016’s new smartwatches are better integrated into the phones they use, and some are even more mainstream than the Apple Watch. Where the Apple Watch Series 2 refined an already solid experience, most of its competitors reinvented the wheel, catching up with or sometimes even outclassing the Apple Watch. Series 2 (top), Apple Watch Hermes (bottom left), Apple Watch Nike (bottom right) | Apple Apple’s 2016 line of smartwatches includes the Series 1 — which is essentially the original watch upgraded with an ambient light sensor, slightly stronger face and improved processor — and the Series 2. The Apple Watch Series 2 brings with it a much stronger processor, now capable of things like 3D graphics, built-in GPS, brighter display and waterproofing up to 50 meters, meaning you can swim with it. The hardware changes mean that you’re now more likely to keep your Apple Watch on throughout your waking day, including through a workout, a swim, a shower. The built-in GPS makes the watch a much handier device for walks and runs, and that brighter display smooths away any moments of wrist twisting that might have occurred with previous iterations as you tried to see what your watch wanted to tell you. The hardware additions, while useful in removing some of the original Apple Watch’s main downsides, do very little to push the device forward. I was most disappointed by the fact that Apple stuck to its odd little smoothed rectangular design instead of introducing a round body as well. Of course, that’s most likely because the shape and ratio fit neatly into the design ecosystem of Apple’s other mobile products, all of which are rectangles. And introducing a round face would mean having to introduce an entire second line of apps for the watch, something Apple is unlikely to ever do. The hardware, thanks to that faster processor, is definitely much zippier than the original Apple Watch, while retaining the device’s surprising stability. The biggest changes to come to the watch are in software, though — both in the changes Apple delivered with a massive update to the operating system, and in Apple’s tweaks to the rules it sets forth for developers. Developers now have access to much more of the watch’s sensors, and can now do more with complications, the little icons that can deliver information from an app to a specific watch face. Apple Watch faces | Apple The most notable software change comes to the user interface. The Apple Watch features a touchscreen, a push-button dial and a rectangular push button. You can also interact with it through motion. Previously that rectangular button was used to bring up a shortlist of your favorite contacts. It was a neat idea, but also wasted a physical button. With WatchOS 3, that button brings up a collection of what you have decided are your favorite apps. Those apps remain running in the background, so they’ll always be the most responsive of the things you use on the watch. It’s a smart idea that has a major impact on the everyday use of your watch. Other changes to the software include the addition of a \"Breathe\" app to Apple’s \"Stand\" app. I was, I’m sure, among the many Apple Watch owners who originally thought very little of the Stand app. But over the past year, I’ve definitely seen the impact it has had on me with its ability to get me up and moving. We’ll see if Breathe, designed to get you to take a moment to relax during the day, will be as impactful. The built-in workout app now includes more activities like swimming, and allows you to track up to five metrics, such as heart rate and active calories. Apple has also overhauled its Watch messenger, which now supports stickers and one-letter-at-a-time handwriting. Of course, the Apple Watch still includes a base level of notifications, which makes it easier to keep your phone in your pocket. But the watch can also do a few things when you don't have your phone around. If your watch is connected to the same Wi-Fi network as your phone, you can still use all of your apps. And if you're phone-free out of the house, you can use your watch to buy things, track your heart rate or amount of exercise, or even play the music you loaded onto the watch, through Bluetooth headphones. And with the loss of a headphone jack on the iPhone 7, I can see wireless headphones becoming much more common now. While I found the entire experience of the new Apple Watch much faster, more robust and friendlier, I’m still annoyed that Apple continues to block developers from creating their own watch faces. A wide array of custom watch faces is one of the main areas that the Apple Watch lags far behind compared to what you will find on virtually every other smartwatch on the market. Ultimately, though, the Apple Watch Series 2 still remains my smartwatch of choice. That’s chiefly because I own an iPhone. If Google were to create more robust ties between its iOS version of the Wear App and support third-party apps, I could see that changing quickly. Asus ZenWatch 3 Asus ZenWatch 3's eclipse design | Asus Price 45 mm x 45 mm x 9.95 mm Weight 55 g to 60 g Display 400 x 400 AMOLED touch display Water Resistance A bit more than a day Sensors None What a difference a year makes. Last year’s ZenWatch 2 was a smartwatch designed to be a low-cost, just-good-enough option in a market packed with pricey models. This year’s model, coming in at $230, nearly doubles the price of the watch, but also delivers one of the top Android devices on the market. The most obvious change to the new ZenWatch is its shift from a rounded rectangle to a fully round watch. That means the face doesn’t have the flat-tire look that chops off the bottom of the circular display and drives some people, including me, nuts. The new design isn’t just a change in shape, it’s also an obvious change in philosophy. Everything about the previous ZenWatches looked and felt cut-rate; the ZenWatch 3 is pure luxury. The face features a bronze diamond-cut bezel laid inside a stainless steel body, giving the ZenWatch the look of a solar eclipse. An Italian stitched-leather band disappears into two stainless steel cusps molded into the watch body. The watch has three buttons. The top is customizable to provide quick access to a specific feature or app. The bottom switches the watch into a battery-saving Eco mode and the larger middle button, which is bisected by a thin line of copper, is used for a variety of basic functions, like brightness boost and as essentially an enter button. Combined with the fully round 1.3-inch AMOLED display, the luxurious look of the ZenWatch 3 makes it among my favorite of all smartwatches I’ve tested. Fortunately, the guts of this watch hold up to the standards set by its looks. Asus ZenWatch 3 | Asus This time around, Asus’ smartwatch features a Qualcomm Snapdragon 2100 processor — a faster version of what last year’s model used, but more importantly, a processor that uses 25 percent less power. Combined with the watch’s Eco mode, which turns off networking and notifications, this can boost the battery life of the watch by more than 200 percent. That said, I found that the watch still only lasted me about a day of heavy use. As with most modern smartwatches, you’re going to have to get used to removing it every night and charging it. The good news is that the ZenWatch 3 uses something called \"HyperCharge,\" which can give the watch a 60 percent charge in 15 minutes. While the ZenWatch 3 comes with its own free Asus ZenWatch Manager, which delivers six custom themes and more than 50 exclusive watch faces for use on Android phones, the smartwatch mostly relies on Google’s Android Wear. The bad news is that Android Wear hasn’t seen much improvement since last year. The good news is that in theory, the increasingly outdated operating system is getting a major overhaul with Android Wear 2 early next year. Either way, iOS support through Android Wear remains even more behind the times than the base operating system — so much so that I’d say if you’re looking for a smartwatch for your Apple phone, you should steer clear of the Android-based ones for now. But if you own an Android phone, I think the ZenWatch 3 is one of the clear winners for the operating system. Unlike the ZenWatch 2, which was clunky and slow to respond, the ZenWatch 3 is a zippy device that is instantly reactive to your pokes and button presses. Coupled with the slick new design — did I mention it comes in a jewelry box fit for an expensive ring? — the Asus ZenWatch 3 is currently my favorite among the non-Apple-supported watches. Casio Smart Outdoor Watch Casio Smart Outdoor Watch | Casio Price 61.7 mm x 56.4 mm x 15.7 mm Weight Android with limited iOS support Battery Life One day to one month Sensors Other Tide graph, fishing timer, sunrise, sunset timer and direction, activity graph, and military-standard shock resistance Casio, arguably the creator of the smartwatch, finally released its own take on the modern device with a focus on outdoor recreation. Technically, the WSD-F10 isn’t really a smartwatch; it’s a smart outdoor watch, a sign that the company is taking seriously the mandate to focus on one very specific, relatively underserved segment of the smartwatch market. Casio has a long history of developing surprising, intriguing bits of technology; many of those creations end up getting strapped to a wrist. Over the years, Casio developed database watches, remote control watches, fitness trackers, blood pressure monitors, even a watch that helped Muslim owners figure out in which direction they could find Mecca for daily prayers. The company also released a popular line of game watches. Tracking elevation | Casio For its first modern smartwatch, the company decided it wanted to find a specific focus to help set it apart from the growing competition. The result is a chunky, resilient watch designed around ease of use during exercise and active outdoor activities. The watch is built around military-standard endurance tests, which means it can withstand a lot of punishment, from freezing rain and temperature drops to vibrations, humidity and falls. It also means that the watch is one of the bulkier smartwatches on the market, but it embraces that design with a simple aesthetic built around the oversized round watch face. The bezel is held in place with four screws, and it gently, subtly slopes away from the screen to avoid any issues created while swiping across the face of the watch. The microphone is tucked neatly between the watch and the urethane band. Three large buttons on the right side of the watch allow you to return to the watch screen, bring up a designated app or launch the watch’s unique software tools. The left side of the watch houses a round port for the charger and another port for reading barometric pressure. Significantly, this is one of the only smartwatches I’ve tried that makes use of a clever dual-layer display. The watch’s screen includes both a monochrome LCD and a color LCD layered on top of one another; the watch switches between them depending on what is needed. It’s a smart way to accomplish a couple of things. First, and most noticeably, it makes the watch easy to read, even in bright sunlight. The monochromatic display sheds glare in a way that it’s almost unnoticeable. The monochromatic display also cuts down on battery use, extending your battery life from about a day of active color screen use to nearly a month if you’re just using it as a standard watch. It’s an impressive feat backed up by smart design that recognizes that there are times when the only thing you want out of your smartwatch is for it to be a watch. When needed, the color LCD easily stands up to the competition, even outdoing many because of its large size and rich colors. I was disappointed to discover that the monochromatic display doesn’t include any sort of lighting, an odd decision for such a powerful timepiece. Because Casio’s Smart Outdoor Watch is designed with a very specific type of person in mind, the company didn’t stop with the hardware. Casio also designed several pieces of software, apps designed to highlight the watch’s abilities as a support tool for those who love to adventure in the outdoors. The tool button launches a watch face with a number of specific uses including a digital compass, which can also be used to set a bearing; altitude measurements, which can be displayed in a current number or on a graph; atmospheric pressure measurement, which can be shown on a dial or as a graph to track weather changes; sunrise and sunset times; a tide graph; and finally, an activity graph which breaks down the exercise you’ve done during the day by four categories. The tool button and those unique features help to turn your watch into a sort of Swiss Army timepiece, a basic tool that quickly expands to offer up a number of much more specific tools useful in the outdoors. The watch includes two other neat tool sets: activity and moment setter. Tracking weather | Casio Activity is a grouping of three different watch faces and tools that can be used while fishing, cycling or trekking. Each offers unique data for the activity at hand. For instance, the trekking tool shows the current time, elapsed time, traveling speed and altitude remaining until you hit your preset goal. The cycling app includes distance traveled, and fishing measures atmospheric pressure changes. The moment setter is used in conjunction with the activity tools to set up alerts for specific events happening while you’re doing an activity. You can use this to do things like remind yourself to eat or drink, when the sun rises, or the best time for fishing. The tool, activity and moment setter features all rely on a Casio app only available on Google Play for Android phones. That means that while this watch will work on the iPhone with some functionality, the bulk of what sets the Smart Outdoor Watch apart from the competition is only accessible if you own an Android phone and download the free app. Of course, Casio’s watch also supports the slew of third-party apps available through Google’s store, and includes 512 MB of RAM and 4 GB of internal storage. While I like the fit and feel of the watch, I did find it sluggish at times when using Android Wear and third-party apps. I also was surprised to find that while the watch is packed with measurement tools, it doesn’t include GPS. It also manages to, despite a large design and round face, still cut off a bit of the bottom of the display in what many people call the \"flat tire\" design. The saving grace of the Smart Outdoor Watch is that it doesn’t need to be particularly smart to be useful if you’re out and about. Those built-in trekking tools, along with some of the other abilities, like being able to get accurate barometric measurements and graph them, turn this smartwatch into something a little bit different from your standard wrist wearable. Add to that the inclusion of a low, low battery mode and that dual-screen technology, and you have a watch that can live up to your expectations or go to sleep and simply deliver the time. Now if they could work on getting that price down and maybe including a hidden LCD game or two... Fossil Q Marshal 45 mm x 45 mm x 14 mm Weight Android with limited iOS support Battery Life Audio Microphone Fossil is going big this year with wearables, really big. The company announced in March that it hoped to launch 100 wearables across all eight of its brands by the end of the year. The company’s approach to smartwatches, according to Fossil, is to start with the watch design and then work in the technology. It sounds like a smart idea for folks worried about the sometimes ugly look of a smartwatch, but given my time with Fossil’s devices and the latest crop of non-Fossil smartwatches, it appears that is easier said than done. Fossil’s name brand releases smartwatches in two categories: the full, touchscreen sort, and hybrid smartwatches. There are four Fossil smartwatches currently on the market. I checked out what appeared to be the top of the line, the Q Marshal. The loaner Fossil sent me was a gorgeous stainless steel design (you can also get the Marshal in smoke stainless steel, brown leather and black silicone). All of the Marshals feature a neat, easy to use tool-less watch strap system that makes swapping out compatible 22 mm straps as easy as pushing in two pins with your fingers. Sure, this means you need to buy straps that work with Fossil watches, but it does make a person more willing to change straps on a whim. The watch itself is a chunky affair, a timepiece with a surprising amount of weight and heft. The watch face features a rugged bezel, which unfortunately can’t be used to interact with the watch. The stainless steel bezel surrounds a 45 mm face that has a black frame encircling it under glass. The decision to not make the usable screen stretch to the edges of the glass is made worse by the flat-tire design, which cuts off the buttom curve of the round face. While I like the stainless steel look and feel of the watch, I was surprised that it is so thick, coming in at 14 mm, or 4 mm thicker than Asus’ ZenWatch 3. The four designs of the Fossil Q Marshal | Fossil Finally, the design is wrapped up with a single crown on its side, though oddly, while the shape and appearance of the crown makes it look like it will twist, it’s simply a push button. It’s these sorts of design decisions — a single-button, flat-tire screen, unsightly thickness — that ultimately undermine any argument Fossil might be trying to make with design first, technology second. Like the ZenWatch 3, the Marshal uses a Qualcomm Snapdragon 2100 processor, giving it a longer battery life than many of last year’s models, and a much snappier response time. The Marshal includes an array of custom Fossil watch faces, but for the most part relies entirely on Google’s increasingly dated Android Wear. During my time with the watch, I liked its physical design — though it is slightly too thick for my tastes — but found the day-to-day use of the watch acceptable at best. Having to rely on a single button and the touchscreen is disappointing when compared to the array of other input methods other watches offer, from multiple buttons to digital crowns to a rotating bezel. The Marshal also lacks a heart rate sensor and any form of built-in GPS, and you can’t swim with it on. One could certainly argue that’s because it’s a watch obviously not designed for working out, but those are the sorts of features increasingly becoming the norm with smartwatches. There’s just too much missing from a technology point of view for the stylish, yet flawed, aesthetic design of the watch to make up for. If you’re in the market for a smartwatch that doesn’t look like a smartwatch, this isn’t it. If you’re looking for a high end, classy tech-packed smartwatch, this isn’t it either. Fossil Q Nate 55.4 mm x 45 mm x 13.5 mm Weight Other Vibration Fossil delivered two sorts of new smartwatches to the market this year. The more traditional touchscreen smartwatches didn’t quite land for me, but what about the company’s hybrid smartwatches? Hybrid smartwatches are an interesting category. They strive to work and look like traditional watches, delivering days or weeks or months of battery life on a single charge or battery, while still trying to offer some high-tech solutions like notifications from your phone or activity tracking. Fossil’s take on the hybrid is meant to look like a watch and act like a smartwatch. That means, according to Fossil, that it uses standard batteries, which deliver about six months of life, and features built-in activity tracking, some notifications and multiple time zones. Look at that hand go | Fossil The company sent us a Q Nate hybrid black stainless steel smartwatch to test out. The watch features a black stainless steel link bracelet that uses the same easy, tool-less interchangeable straps as the Q Marshal. The body is also black stainless steel with a rugged bezel, two buttons on the right side of the watch and a third functioning crown that can double as a button. Coming in with a larger case than the Marshal and an ever-so-slightly thinner design, the Nate is a much more aesthetically pleasing watch for me. Unfortunately, this particular design has one major flaw. The traditional face of the watch is black with gray numbers, lettering and markers, and it has no light source. That means, with my perhaps aging eyes, I struggle to see much of anything on the watch beyond the current time. This is exacerbated by the fact that the watch has no backlight. Fortunately, the Nate comes in three colors, including a more traditional stainless steel with white lettering and numbers. Fossil Q Nate | Fossil Why does it matter whether I can see anything beyond the big and little hands? Because this is a smartwatch of sorts, and a very cleverly designed one to boot. The Nate has built into its very traditional design just the right amount of tech to keep you informed, but not constantly tinkering with your watch. For instance, it includes the ability to track your steps, general activity and sleep. You can also set the bottom button to one of four actions: ring your phone, take a picture, track a pre-established goal or control your music. Once selected, a press of that button triggers the action. The watch also has a really interesting way of subtly alerting you to notifications from up to six apps and six contacts. When you receive an alert from any of the people or apps you selected, the watch buzzes, and the hands on the watch move to the hour marker you selected. So, if I can only keep straight the fact that my son Tristan is two and my wife is one, I know when the watch buzzes and the hands swing to one, who just texted me. It’s a really neat way to help you filter out your day without reading every single thing that comes your way. Pressing the bottom button shows the date by swinging both hands to the correct number. The crown, also a button, allows you to toggle between time zones, your alarm and the last alert you received. All of this is managed through an app that works equally well on Android and iOS. You use the app to set up the notifications, your extra time zone and — my personal favorite — to create custom goals. You'll need good eyes | Fossil As I mentioned earlier, the bottom button can be tied to one of four different actions. One of those actions allows you to track your progress toward a goal. You go into the app and create a new goal, and then activate it so that a press of the bottom button tracks you having achieved one part of that goal. In my case, I decided to create a goal that I would drink a glass of water eight times a day, which is about the recommended amount. Now, every time I drink a glass of water, I simply press the bottom button and it marks it. When I hit all eight, the app lets me know with a message. It’s super basic stuff, but also the sort of thing you’re pretty likely to use. During my time with the watch, I found myself missing some of the deeper connections that the more powerful smartwatches deliver. That said, the Nate Q is certainly the sort of watch I could see myself wearing out on a night when I’m not interested in being disturbed, but do want to know when someone important, like my son, is trying to reach me. Where Fossil’s design-first philosophy fails in its smartwatches, that approach helped to create a wonderful hybrid device. Garmin Fenix 3 HR Garmin Fenix 3 HR | Garmin Price 51.5 mm x 51.5 mm x 16 mm Weight Android and iOS with Garmin app and store Battery Life 16 hours to two weeks Sensors GPS/GLONASS, barometric, compass, heart rate Audio Other Advanced fitness training features, outdoor navigation features, wide variety of exercise profiles \nGarmin’s Fenix 3 HR smartwatch may be both my favorite and the most frustrating watch I’ve ever tested. \nThe Fenix 3 HR is a chunky, solid piece of tech that looks like the sort of gadget you’d take into the wilderness to increase your odds of survival. And in many ways that’s exactly what it is. Packed with an abundance of sensors (GPS/GLONASS, barometric, compass, heart rate, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, ANT), 10 atm water resistance and a surprisingly long battery life that can squeeze out two weeks, this is the sort of watch you’d want on your wrist when you go camping. \nIts relatively sleek design also means that it looks just as fine on the wrist of someone willing to sport a G-Shock every day. It also runs equally well on Android and iOS, forgoing both app stores for its own modest yet meaningful store of first- and third-party watch creations. \nBut in an attempt to do so much on so small a device, Garmin manages to gum up the experience itself, making even the most basic of tweaks to the watch the sort of lengthy, button-pushing experience that will stop you in your mountain-hiking tracks. Heart rate chart | Garmin \nAs with Casio’s outdoor-centric smartwatch, the Fenix 3 HR features a PVD-stainless steel bezel and buttons encircling a sapphire-lens round watch face. The watch doesn’t support touch controls, but the five buttons give you plenty of ways to interact with it … maybe too many. The screen uses a high-resolution color display with LED backlighting, which makes for great visibility at night, inside or even in bright sunlight. Most noticeable, though, is the watch’s long battery life. With normal settings and the GPS on, it manages 16 or so hours. You can get 40 hours by using a mode that auto-switches the GPS on and off when needed, or two weeks if you’re just using the smartwatch mode. \nUnfortunately, the watch has neither a microphone nor a speaker. The more you dive into the device, the more clear that becomes. The Fenix 3 HR is designed with sports and activity in mind first. That means even with the support of add-on apps, you’re not going to find a lot of the abilities you might have come to expect with less focused smartwatches. \nThere is no way to store music on the watch or check Twitter, Facebook or email, for instance. While there are a number of games, there are very few general apps that aren’t designed around an activity. Instead, you’ll find a wide assortment of robust hiking, swimming, biking, triathlon, skiing, rowing and golfing apps. Because the watch measures heart rate, and can track and graph it right on your watch face, you’ll also find a lot of heart rate data apps. The watch is, in general, very good at saving, presenting and reusing data. \nWhere Casio’s first smartwatch is obviously activity-centric, it still feels like you’re using a watch. The Fenix 3 delivers the sort of performance that you’d expect from a computer or trainer. With the help of an add-on, for instance, it can gauge the degree of bounce in your step, measure your running symmetry and air time, and look at cadence and stride length. It can even track your stress levels while you’re working out and alert you to your lactate threshold (when your muscles are basically exhausted). It’s an impressive array of technology packed into a device that doesn’t stand out much on your wrist. \nThe Fenix 3’s sheer volume of features and apps is also, to some degree, the watch’s downfall. The menu system, all controlled with the watch's five buttons, is contorted, confused and often time-consuming. If, for instance, I want to switch to a new watch face using my watch and not the app, I have to press and hold the middle left button to bring up a menu, press the top right button to select settings, press the bottom left to scroll down to watch faces, and then press the top right button twice to first select that and then select the sort of watch face I want. Then, I use the left middle and left bottom buttons to scroll up and down through the list of faces, and press the top right button to select my choice. From there, I have to either manually back out with several presses of the bottom right button, or just hold the bottom left button to return to the home screen on my watch. Heart rate sensor | Garmin \nI have to confess, I’ve discovered that between switching watches and just my regular busy, often hectic day, I lack the mental acuity, dexterity and memory to not screw this process up at least once almost every single time. That’s a minimum of once. It’s not unusual for me to spend a minute or two staring at my watch in frustration and saying awful things about it as I go through the button pressing like it’s some sort of technological incantation. \nThe complexity of the watch doesn’t stop with navigating its user interface, unfortunately. Everything about this watch seems unnecessarily confusing at times. \nWhere most watches provide downloadable apps, the Fenix 3 lets you download apps, watch faces, widgets and data fields. The distinctions between some of these downloads are still relatively lost on me, but they’re all grabbed using your computer or the smartphone app from Garmin’s Connect IQ Store. \nThe buttons of the device are a bit less than intuitive as well. The top left button is your power and light button. The middle left is your up button, but is also used to bring up the menu with a long press. The bottom left is your down button, but a long press also returns you to the watch’s home screen. The top right is the start/stop/reset button, which also serves as essentially the enter button in a menu. The bottom right is the lap button, and the back button in menus. \nThere is the ability to select what long presses do on the two right buttons, but the options are oddly minimal. For instance, you can’t set either button to bring up the watch faces or apps, which seem like they could be the two most common functions for some types of users. Instead you can choose to, for instance, have a long press on the top button launch a Wi-Fi sync and a long press on the bottom button launch GPS. \nOn the one hand, Garmin makes up for this by offering all of the downloads for the watch for free and even opening up the development software and the store to third parties, who are free to create their own apps. But on the other, the storage on the watch dedicated to apps and watch faces is strikingly low. It offers just 32 MB, compared to, say, the 4 GB found in the Casio. \nDespite all of the negativity I just heaped on the Fenix 3 HR, I remain blown away by its battery efficiency, design and utility in a very focused area. I don’t see this smartwatch becoming my daily device — in fact, I took it on a trip to Italy and hardly used it, because it lacked a lot of the apps I like to use from my wrist when traveling — but I can see it becoming my go-to device for workouts, hiking and the like. \nMy personal love of watches and desire to get the most out of wearable tech leads me to believe that this sort of very focused approach to smartwatches may become more popular as the technology and its popularity broaden. \nPut another way, Garmin seems to have set out to build the perfect activity smartwatch, and the company has come very close with the tech on hand. Garmin also helped push forward the argument for owning not just one smartwatch but several, each designed with specific duties or functions in mind. Razer Nabu Watch",

With Xeon and Nvidia Quadra video card options on offer, it'll soar much higher if you load it.

      "text": "Apple Inc. is rumored to be exploring an avenue into developing digital glasses, a risky venture into augmented reality that could yield a big payoff for the company if it’s successful.\nPast forays into AR have seen companies come up short and shift their focus to virtual reality projects. While Google has attempted to tackle the technology in 2013 with its own Google Glass, the project ultimately failed, succumbing to low battery life, an unattractive design, and privacy backlash. To succeed in the market, Apple will have to create a sleek design that allows users to access what the company has to offer.\nStepping into the less-charted market of wearable technology isn’t the safest of moves. But if Apple can roll out a product that fills the gaps Google Glass left, it could become a leader in AR.\nRecommended: 40 iPhone tips and tricks everyone should know Still, developing that technology “ is going to take a while , because there are some really hard technology challenges there, but it will happen in a big way, and we will wonder when it does, how we ever lived without it,” Apple chief executive officer Tim Cook said last month, Bloomberg reported. “Like we wonder how we lived without our phone today.\"\n40 iPhone tips and tricks everyone should know Sources close to the project told Bloomberg that the device would connect to iPhones wirelessly to reveal images and information in the glasses’ lenses. The devices, which could also use AR, remain in a developmental and experimental phase, and Apple has not yet ordered enough parts to indicate that they’re ready to begin producing the product for commercial sale.\nEven with a renewed vision for the product, it’s hard to say whether Apple can surpass Google’s clumsy endeavor. Chips, batteries, and other parts needed to build the glasses might still be too large and bulky to create a better design than Google Glass. While VR headsets have entered the market, along with a HoloLens AR product from Microsoft, many companies have hit a wall when it comes to developing sophisticated and practical AR technologies.\nBut another, more surprising company has announced a foray into the field as well : Snap Inc., the creator of Snapchat,. The company debuted “Spectacles,” a pair of sunglasses capable of capturing short videos, in September. The more stylish, and less expensive glasses – with a ticket price of $129.99 compared to Google Glass’s $1,500 – have made the technology more appealing and attainable recently.\nThe soonest Apple could unveil its own glasses would be in 2018, sources say. Still, some don’t believe Apple has the capacity to become a leader in the technology, and question what role the company will play in charting new routes in the future.\n“Apple has a track record of taking not-entirely-original and niche ideas and transforming them into something grander ,” Shira Ovide wrote in an op-ed for Livemint. “We might look back at 2016 as a lull before a storm of ground-breaking product categories. More likely, though, Apple’s days as technology’s unrivaled innovation factory are over.”",

      "title": "Apple Watch 2 and Asus ZenWatch 3: Which should you give to a loved one this Christmas?",
      "text": "  \n(Facebook/Asus Zenwatch) Asus ZenWatch 3 is one sure-hit Christmas 2016 gift. \nWith the holidays fast approaching, smartwatches are some of the most popular items that are being bought as a gift to loved ones. While there is no questioning that Apple Watch is synonymous to the word smartwatch for many people, this doesn't mean that it is the only brand to be considered. With the release of the Asus ZenWatch 3, gadget fans who want to own a piece of the latest trend in watches now have an option to the Apple Watch 2. \nIt was in September when Apple unveiled its Apple Watch 2, along with the highly anticipated iPhone 7. However, because Asus revealed its Asus Zenwatch 3 just a week ahead of the Apple Watch 2's unveiling, it is inevitable for gadget fans to compare the two. While it's true that both brands have their own set of similarities, the Asus Zenwatch 3 and the Apple Watch 2 come with a lot of differences. \nOne of the obvious differences between the Apple Watch 2 and the Asus ZenWatch 3 is their shape. While Apple comes in a rectangular shape, its Asus counterpart comes in round shape. \nWhile the shape of the smartwatch may not be a consideration for some people when purchasing one, the specs of the device are surely factors for many. For one thing, the Apple Watch 2 comes with a 1.65-inch OLED Retina display and boasts of 390 x 312 pixels and 303 ppi, while the Asus ZenWatch 3's screen display is 1.39 inches with an AMOLED screen with 278 ppi pixel density. Advertisement \nHowever, because the Asus ZenWatch 3 comes with a Gorilla Glass 3, it is more resistant to scratches as compared to the Apple Watch 2. Furthermore, as the Asus Zenwatch 3 is only 0.42 inches thick as compared to the Apple Watch 2's 0.45-inch thickness, it goes without saying that the former is more ideal for people who prefer slimmer watches. \nBecause the Asus ZenWatch 3 boasts of 340 mAh battery that can last up to two days of use, which is relatively longer than that of the Apple Watch 2's 18 hours , it is pretty obvious that the Asus Zenfone has the upper hand in this regard as well. \nFinally, as the Apple Watch 2 carries a price tag of $369, at least, while the Asus ZenWatch 3 is available for $229 only, it goes without saying that the latter is ideal for those who are unwilling to spend more than $300 on a smartwatch. \nNonetheless, whatever a consumer chooses in the end, there is no denying that both brands of smartwatches are admirable and will surely be an ideal gift to loved ones this coming holidays.

      "text": "iPhone 8 Expected to Come in 3 Versions And 2 sizes. Twitter \nEach year, Apple continues its quest to pry our hands from our existing iPhones in hopes of inspiring us to upgrade. Next year's models just might do the trick. \nAccording to 9to5Mac , KGI Securities projected that the tech corporation will be releasing three versions of its upcoming iPhone 8 model in two different sizes. The 4.7-inch screen phone is slated to include a single-layer camera and LCD display. One version of the 5.5-inch model will include LDC display, while the other will feature an organic light-emitting diode (OLED) keyboard , which could mean it runs on less battery and boasts a thinner, sleeker look. The double-layer camera popularized by the iPhone 7 will come in both versions of the 5.5-inch model. \nEarlier reports said one model will feature a 5-inch screen and that the phones will come in glass. But take a moment to recall dropping your glass iPhone 4 and 4s on the ground and watching its life flash before your eyes. Apple insiders insist the glass will be stronger this time around. \nThe internet is currently a game of broken telephone (or smartphone, rather), so we'll have to see what the iPhone 8 is really like when it hits shelves next year.",

A large part of the reason that they got to be so successful is due to the impressive design of their products. This book, Designed By Apple In California , is a retrospective on the company’s journey over the past 20 years. \nAccording to Apple, the book is printed on specially milled, custom dyed paper with matte silver gilded edges that are quire intentionally reminiscent of the matte silver on so many products from the brand. 450 photographs in this volume are printed using eight color separations and low ghost ink, and they are all bound in a hardcover volume that comes in either a small (10.20 by 12.75) or large (13×16.25) sizes. Whether a fan of design or just an admirer or Apple as a company, this will make for a fantastic addition to your collection of coffee table books . These will be available in select stores around the world and online. Prices start at $200. [ Purchase ]",

We also believe certain technology companies could actually be aided by Trump’s focus on smarter trade deals and practices. For example, we wonder if European antitrust regulators and Asia semiconductor-related companies will be as aggressive regarding U.S. interests with a President Trump.\nHe notes, too, the rise of smaller tech companies, which might especially benefit from U.S. domestic growth:\nInterestingly, small-cap technology stocks rallied 5.5% (i.e., S&P 600 SmallCap Technology Sector) from Election Day to yesterday, we think reflecting their domestic focus, likely lower tax rates, and less of a likelihood of being targeted by a Trump administration (unlike larger companies). Nonetheless, we see strong U.S. growth and more favorable tax rules significantly aiding U.S. technology companies, and view their recent sell-off as an overreaction.",

According to a Bloomberg report , the Cupertino company has been talking to suppliers and started ordering Near-Eye-Displays for early experiments. The amount ordered suggest that mass production is still far away according to the sources at Apple that talked with Bloomberg. The sources further reported, that the glasses connect with the iPhone wirelessly, acting as an Augmented Reality extension to the iPhone and projecting images or information onto the glasses. Allegedly it would take Apple at least until 2018 to finish development and the project could even be stopped before. Google failed to succeed with their Google Glass project which was first released in 2013 mostly due to technical problems like insufficient battery life but also because of concerns regarding privacy. The glasses were also criticized for their design.  ",

      "text": "By Tiernan Ray Scott Kessler , analyst at CFRA Research (formerly S&P Capital IQ), today pounds the table for tech stocks large and small, arguing that the sell-off in tech that follows the surprise election of Donald Trump to the U.S. presidency a week ago was an “over-reaction.”\nKessler, who has Strong Buy opinions on Apple ( AAPL ) and Alphabet ( GOOGL ), and a Buy on Facebook ( FB ) and Intel ( INTC ), opines Trump’s focus on domestic growth and reduced regulation will be good for tech overall, writing “we see a stronger U.S. economy and less regulation as good for bigger technology companies.”\nEven things like a dismantling of “ Net Neutrality ,” long a favorite of tech, might not be a bad thing, as would forcing European regulators to back down:\nIn particular, we think easing or eliminating net neutrality would favor the biggest and best-capitalized companies able to most easily pay for faster and better access, and provide competitive advantages. We also believe certain technology companies could actually be aided by Trump’s focus on smarter trade deals and practices. For example, we wonder if European antitrust regulators and Asia semiconductor-related companies will be as aggressive regarding U.S. interests with a President Trump. \nHe notes, too, the rise of smaller tech companies, which might especially benefit from U.S. domestic growth:\nInterestingly, small-cap technology stocks rallied 5.5% (i.e., S&P 600 SmallCap Technology Sector) from Election Day to yesterday, we think reflecting their domestic focus, likely lower tax rates, and less of a likelihood of being targeted by a Trump administration (unlike larger companies). Nonetheless, we see strong U.S. growth and more favorable tax rules significantly aiding U.S. technology companies, and view their recent sell-off as an overreaction.",

      "text": "\nIn lieu of going full-on touch, Apple has come up with an alternative solution by ditching the row of function keys. In its place is a slim OLED screen that supports multi-touch and displays application settings, which change dynamically depending on what you’re doing. That’s not the only thing new about Apple’s slim laptop.\nWhile the inclusion of a Touch Bar is notable, perhaps even more notable is what isn’t included. MagSafe is gone, as is an SD card slot. Apple has also opted to include four combination USB-C 3.2 Thunderbolt 3 ports, which means you’ll need new cables and dongles since the old USB ports are gone.\nApple is typically at the forefront of getting the industry to adopt new technology. But with its newest MacBook Pro, it’s unclear if this is really the direction the market is headed. Apple executives have said on more than one occasion the company will not create a touchscreen Mac , so you can kiss your dreams of a Surface Book-type device running macOS goodbye.\nIs this the future of computing? We got the base 15-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, which comes with a 2.6GHz quad-core Intel Core i7 processor, 16GB of RAM, 256GB of, and a Radeon Pro 450 with 2GB of memory. The price for the 15-inch starts at $2,399 and goes all the way up to $4,300 if you customize it .\nWe haven’t had a chance to really play around with Apple’s new MacBook Pro, so we’re reserving judgment for now. But based on our favorable experience with the new Surface Book , Apple may no longer be the most innovative company in tech . What do you think?\nSee full gallery on TechnoBuffalo ",

And just like all other Apple products, this ain’t cheap either. The $299 hardbound book contains 450 photographs of Apple’s rich history in design. It features past and current products made by the Cupertino giant. The book also documents the techniques and materials used by the company’s design team ‘over two decades of innovation’, and is dedicated to the memory of Steve Jobs. \nThe photographs in the book have been shot by photographer Andrew Zuckerman in a ‘deliberately spare style’, and comes in two different sizes – a smaller 10.20″ x 12.75″ version that is priced at $199 and a larger 13″ x 16.25″ version at $299. Apple says that the books are printed on ‘specially milled, custom-dyed paper with gilded matte silver edges, using eight colour separations and low-ghost ink.’ \n“The idea of genuinely trying to make something great for humanity was Steve’s motivation from the beginning, and it remains both our ideal and our goal as Apple looks to the future,” said Jony Ive, Apple’s chief design officer. “This archive is intended to be a gentle gathering of many of the products the team has designed over the years. We hope it brings some understanding to how and why they exist, while serving as a resource for students of all design disciplines.” \nIve explains that the book is ‘an objective representation of our work’. He added the book describes how Apple’s design team works, their values and their goals. \nRead- Apple suppliers to cut production as iPhone 7 sales slow down: Report \nApple its online post said that the book was developed over an eight-year period, and are available exclusively on Apple’s website in Australia, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, the UK and the US, and also at select Apple Stores. © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd Tags:",

      "text": "Why does the iOS 10 lock screen reveal so much? \nOver the last few years, development of and interest in the virtual reality arena has truly begun heating up, but the same can’t yet be said for its close cousin, augmented reality. The most prominent product in the category to date was the much-maligned—perhaps rightly so— Google Glass , which never really cracked the consumer market. \nBut that doesn’t mean that the interest isn’t still there. Microsoft has been investigating the mixed reality concept with its HoloLens visor, a device that seems to actually make a compelling argument for the technology, and Snapchat has garnered some attention with its new Spectacles glasses, which feature built-in cameras and integrate with the popular messaging app. \nAnd now there are rumors that Apple is throwing its hat glasses into the ring. But is this merely the usual wild speculation or is there fire behind the smoke? This is Tim \nPerhaps the most compelling argument that Apple is working seriously on an augmented reality device is none other than Tim Cook himself. The Apple CEO has mentioned several times in the last year or two that augmented reality is positioned to be a big thing, saying during the company’s quarterly financial results call in July that Apple is “high on AR for the long run, we think there’s great things for customers and a great commercial opportunity.” Adam Murray \nMicrosoft HoloLens \nAs recently as last month , Cook has said that AR will become a daily part of people’s lives and compared it to the technological sea change brought about by the smartphone: “It will happen in a big way, and we will wonder when it does, how we ever lived without it. Like we wonder how we lived without our phone today.” \nOther breadcrumbs include Apple apparently hiring the chief engineer of a firm that’s actively building AR glasses, as well as the company’s acquisition of a number of smaller AR-related enterprises. \nAnd, if you needed any more concrete evidence that Apple’s bullish on AR, well, look no further than Tim Cook’s rimless frames. Stylish fashion choice or the perfect look for concealing prototype AR glasses? You decide. The car hole \nLooking at Apple’s rumored pipeline, it’s also not hard to see why the company would suddenly be more bullish on developing augmented reality gear. Signs had pointed to Apple’s heavy investment in the automobile space this year, up until a month or two ago when reports began to suggest that project was in the midst of a sharp change in direction that might refocus on building software for cars, including an autonomous driving system, rather than manufacturing an entire vehicle. BMW \nThe car is a natural place for AR. (Concept illustration by BMW.) \nUnlike the car space, which is full of long-entrenched firms, heavy regulation, and a number of fields in which Apple would have to build expertise from scratch, AR is a logical offshoot of the work the company’s already doing. The upside might be lower, for sure—AR glasses are far less broadly applicable than cars—but Apple hasn’t shied away from smaller markets where it thinks it can make a difference, and it’s certainly less risky than building a car from the ground up. \nThere’s little that’s new about AR devices: displays, sensors, batteries, wireless connections—these are all technologies that Apple has spent plenty of time developing and refining. Moreover, with the Apple Watch and forthcoming AirPods, Cupertino’s already made forays into the wearable space and shown a willingness to explore the possibilities and even to revisit and refine its ideas as the company learns more about how people use those devices. The secret sauce \nOf course, the $64 million question when it comes to Apple’s augmented reality ambitions is what exactly the company wants to do with the technology. It’s been suggested that AR features will find their way into iOS’s Camera app before any piece of hardware appears, but it’s unclear exactly what such a feature would entail. Plenty of companies have been building AR features into iOS apps for years now, the most recent prominent hit being Pokémon Go . \nDespite the success of that game, I’d argue it’s more fluke than compelling proof-of-concept for augmented reality on a smartphone. Most of the time, people don’t want to run around holding their phones in front of their faces. For example, I remember an early iOS app that offered a feature whereby you could pan your camera around and see local businesses like restaurants—it was interesting, to be sure, but it hardly made a compelling case over simply browsing a list on the phone’s screen. \nThat doesn’t mean AR isn’t full of potential: being able to merge the physical and digital worlds would seem to be a logical jumping off point for the next generation of technology. But it may very well take Apple’s classic combination of hardware and software to show us all why exactly we should care.

      "title": "Apple's Hour of Code workshops delight kids... of all ages!",
      "text": "\nApple has announced a whole week of Hour of Code: December 5 - 11, 2016! Sign up at your country's Apple Retail web page . In the meantime, check out Rene's writeup of the 2014 Hour of Code workshop.\nPress the button. Slide to unlock. Tap the icon. The app or game fills your screen — and your senses. But how does that happen? How does that icon get on the screen? How does that bird fly across it? How does that plant obliterate that zombie? How do all these apps and games work? The answer is \"code\". And Apple's free Hour of Code workshops were designed to introduce kids to just that.\nTo get a feeling for the event, Serenity Caldwell went to the Hour of Code at the SoHo Apple Store in New York City. I took my god children, ages 6 and 9, to the Apple Store in Montreal.\nAt both locations, and at Apple Stores around the world, kids and adults alike began filing in a short time before the workshops began, their spaces reserved online over the course of the last week. Parents accompanied the younger children, helping them find stools around the large wooden tables. At one end, a TV set stood with the Hour of Code material displayed for the whole store to see.\nAt each stool were were iPads minis, loaded with the course material and ready to go. The kids took their places and were additionally given headsets so that they could hear sounds and videos above the din of the store. An Apple specialist led the group, supported by several other Apple Store staff members circling around and helping out.\n\nThe one hour workshop consisted of a series of code-based puzzles the kids needed to solve. The puzzles used characters and imagery from popular games like Angry Birds and Plants vs. Zombies . Instead of focusing on the nuts and bolts of coding and forcing kids to write brackets and if statements, however, the children were asked to build pre-created modules, much like an Automator or Workflow module. They simply dragged blocks of code from the Code.org sidebar to the main canvas — code that told their on-screen characters to move or turn, as well as how much or how often.\n\nBetween puzzles, the kids got to see short videos from the likes of Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg, who emphasized the empowerment behind learning to code.\nBy allowing the kids to directly manipulate coding blocks on the iPad mini, it let them build an app without necessarily getting into the nitty-gritty of code writing, and the success of problem-solving a difficult puzzle left the kids excited to move on to the next adventure. The large Apple presence in both the Montreal and New York City stores we visited also meant that the children received a lot of personalized attention; they had to work to progress, but never had to feel like they were being left behind.\n\nThe kids weren't the only ones learning and growing: Many parents became enthralled. The puzzle-based aspect to the coding lessons gave parents a way to help their children, even if they weren't already familiar with code theory. But, at the same time, it gave those untrained in the art of coding a window to potentially learn the fundamentals and encourage growth in their children in the future.\n\nAt the end of the hour, the kids were told that they could keep their headsets, and everyone lined up for a group picture. To a kid, they all wished it could have lasted longer. \"Why couldn't it be two hours of code?!\"\nThe workshop may not have been designed so that they could leave and go program the next Angry Birds or Plants vs. Zombies, but all of them wanted to. Whether or not any of them end up becoming developers, they all learned that — if they put in the work — they could.\n\nIt might have been an hour of code, but the spark it lit could last a lifetime. That's what makes programs like code.org and App Camp for Girls — and tools like Swift playgrounds — so important. They help inspire and enable the next generation of coders.\nFurthermore, these programs open the doors for adult mentors to help guide kids on the path to programming, even if they don't necessarily have high-powered coding backgrounds themselves. In the preface to Carl Sagan's book The Demon-Haunted World , Sagan talks about his parents being his most important teachers in helping him pursuing astronomy: They may not have had backgrounds in astrophysics, but they encouraged him to question the world, and that gave him the drive to push forward, to discover, to explore.\n\nIf programs like Code.org's can help parents translate the importance of coding to their children, they don't need to know how to formulate for loops or understand what variables are useful for. It all comes down to curiosity and problem-solving.\nIf you couldn't get to Hour of Code at your local Apple Store on Thursday, here's a sample of what the workshops covered. There's also lots more to explore on code.org , so you can keep coding for hours and hours to come.\nHour of Code: Angry Birds & Plants vs. Zombies Puzzles Photos by Serenity Caldwell. \n",

      "text": "· Updated November 17, 2016 \nApple manufacturing partner Foxconn has been studying the possibility of moving iPhone production to the United States, according to Japanese website Nikkei Asian Review , leading to hopeful speculation some iPhones could one day be “Made in America” rather than be assembled and imported from China. \nThe report claims Apple asked both Foxconn and rival supplier Pegatron, which denied the request, to look into making iPhones stateside, although Foxconn chairman Terry Gou is said to be less enthusiastic about the idea due to inevitably higher production costs in the United States compared to China. \n“Apple asked both Foxconn and Pegatron, the two iPhone assemblers, in June to look into making iPhones in the U.S.,” a source said. “Foxconn complied, while Pegatron declined to formulate such a plan due to cost concerns.” \nIn a speech at Liberty University in Virginia earlier this year, President-elect Donald Trump said “we’re going to get Apple to start building their damn computers and things in this country instead of in other countries,” while he has also threatened to introduce a 45% tax on products imported from China. \nhttp://www.macrumors.com/2016/11/17/made-in-america-iphones-foxconn/ \nObama sets new record for regulations, 527 pages in just one day \nPresident Obama has just set a new record for rules and regulations, his administration spitting out 527 pages worth in just one day, as he races to put his fingerprint on virtually every corner of American life and business. \nAccording to the Competitive Enterprise Institute, the administration has just shattered the old record for pages of regulations and rules published by the in-house journal, the Federal Register. \nAt 81,640 total pages for 2016, it ranks first and 235 pages more than all of those published in 2010, the previous record.",

      "text": "Apple certainly loved the press it received when the FBI very publicly wasn’t initially able to break into an iPhone owned by one of the San Bernardino shooters. The fact that the FBI had to pay security professionals to crack in suggested that Apple’s security is tight, locked down from all prying eyes. On Thursday, however, The Intercept cited a security firm that says Apple is secretly sending your phone call logs back to its servers where it’s no longer safe from law enforcement or anyone else.\nVladimir Katalov, CEO of Elcomsoft, explained to The Intercept that Apple uploads and stores all sorts of information about first party and third party phone calls, including those placed using apps like Skype, WhatsApp and Viber. Private data such as the length of the call, the time it was placed and how long the call lasted are all stored for up to four months on Apple’s private servers, Katalov explained.\nTypically, this is the sort of data that law enforcement goes after wireless companies to provide, especially if they’re trying to get data on criminals. It’s worrisome, however, in light of programs like PRISM that were revealed by Edward Snowden, proving to the public that there was widespread collaboration between the US government and tech companies that were allowing the NSA to search through private data.\nApple says there’s a reason it stores your phone data Apple actually isn’t shying away from the fact that it’s storing your phone data but doesn’t quite admit the full extent of which it does, and instead, refers to it as “history syncing.”\n“We offer call history syncing as a convenience to our customers so that they can return calls from any of their devices,” an Apple spokesperson told The Intercept . “Device data is encrypted with a user’s passcode, and access to iCloud data including backups requires the user’s Apple ID and password. Apple recommends all customers select strong passwords and use two-factor authentication.”\nThe problem is that I don’t think any of us really knew about it. Perhaps there’s a line deep in Apple’s EULA — The Intercept says there’s no notification or warning — but Apple hasn’t said it stores this data specifically. In fact, here’s what CEO Tim Cook said in 2014 when Edward Snowden and the NSA were making headlines:\n“We believe in telling you up front exactly what’s going to happen to your personal information and asking for your permission before you share it with us,” Cook said . “And if you change your mind later, we make it easy to stop sharing with us. Every Apple product is designed around those principles. When we do ask to use your data, it’s to provide you with a better user experience.”\nIf this is true, where’s the option to use iCloud but opt out of call logging? Perhaps that’s something Apple can add in the future. There’s another problem, though.\nElcomsoft has the tools to crack data from iCloud accounts, so long as it has a user’s credentials. Those are easy to get through phishing scams, but The Intercept explains they aren’t always needed. “In some cases Elcomsoft’s tool can help customers access the iCloud even without account credentials if they can obtain an authentication token for the account from the accountholder’s computer, allowing them to get iCloud data without Apple’s help,” the news outlet explained.\nWorse, Elcomsoft counts law enforcement branches among its customers. In other words, while Apple promotes and promises a super secure experience, iCloud is actually one gaping vulnerability in the whole system. As The Intercept explains, law enforcement could request the data and then use Elcomsoft’s tools to decrypt it, even if Apple promises customers that its data is safe from prying eyes.\nIf law enforcement can do it, then hackers are already two steps ahead. The safest bet would be to turn off iCloud functionality altogether.\n\n\nSource : The Intercept ",

Introducing massive improvements over the first-gen model, the Apple Watch Series 2 is an unquestionable success story for wearable design. \nFitness fanatic and TrustedReviews’ resident lifter-of-heavy-things-only-to-put-them-back-down-again Richard Easton had this to say: \"The Apple Watch Series 2 is right now the best smartwatch you can buy. WatchOS 3 is a marked improvement over previous operating system versions and it finally makes using apps from your wrist more palatable.” \nHe continued: \"With the Series 2, Apple also recognised what users wanted from their wrist-based wearables. It augmented the Apple Watch Series 2 with some serious fitness credentials that make it much more than just a mirror for your iPhone notifications.” \n\"In some respects, it's a fully-fledged fitness tracker with GPS and heart rate monitoring in of itself. Really, the Apple Watch Series 2 could have won this category just for the adorable manner in which it maintains its impressive levels of water resistance by spurting water out of its little speaker,” added Richard. \nWe gave the Apple Watch 2 a 4/5 score in our review, praising its bright, beautiful screen, great fitness tracking, GPS functionality, solid battery life, and snappy performance. Here’s our verdict: \n“The Apple Watch 2 might not look any different, but the refinements that Apple has made are all spot on. If you want a smartwatch that doubles as a solid fitness tracker then this is a fantastic option.” \nWatch: Apple Watch 2 review \nWho do you think should have won this award?

      "text": "Home / News / Mobile Phone News / Apple confirms iPhone 6 and 6 Plus 'touch disease' – offers repair service Apple confirms iPhone 6 and 6 Plus 'touch disease' – offers repair service \nby Joe Roberts Read Comments \nBack in August, destruction specialists iFixit revealed the truth behind the 'touch disease' problem affecting iPhone 6 and 6 Plus owners. \nThe problem starts as a flickering grey bar at the top of the iPhone's screen, before the display starts behaving erratically and eventually becomes unresponsive. \niFixit revealed that the issue was at the hardware level, and was related to the touchscreen controllers, or Touch IC chips, that sit under the handset's display, rendering a screen-change ineffective. \nRelated: iPhone 7 review \nAt the time, there was no word from Apple on the touch disease epidemic, but now the company has published a 'Multi-Touch Repair Program for iPhone 6 Plus' page , officially acknowledging the issue. \nHowever, Apple seems to be saying the problem only arises after users drop or damage their phone, and doesn't accept responsibility for the hardwarse issues. \nThe page reads: \"Apple has determined that some iPhone 6 Plus devices may exhibit display flickering or Multi-Touch issues after being dropped multiple times on a hard surface and then incurring further stress on the device.\" \nAs long as your phone is in working order, and the screen is not cracked or broken, Apple is offering to repair it – but it'll cost you £146.44, while US customers will have to shell out $149. \nCustomers who have already paid for a service repair related to the issue can get a refund of the difference between the $149 service fee and whatever they paid to fix the problem. \nRelated: iPhone 8 \nThe new repair programme will run for five years \"after the first retail sale of the unit\", so anyone affected by touch disease should be able to take advatange of the offer. \niPhone 6S models escaped the screen issue as the newer handsets moved the controller chips from the logic board onto the display itself. \nWATCH: iPhone 7 Review \nLet us know if you've been affected by touch disease in the comments. 0 shares",

      "text": "Mikhail Goldenkov/Strelka Institute/Flickr \nIt really doesn't take all that much to be a good employer to the women in your company.\nTreat them with the same respect you show your male employees, show them that they're a valued resource by  paying them  and promoting them on par with their male counterparts, nix the boys club vibe and foster a more inclusive culture, and you'll be well on your way to gaining their loyalty.\nSadly, lots of companies continue to struggle with this.\nFairygodboss anonymously surveys employees about their overall job satisfaction, perceived gender equality at work, and whether women would recommend their employer to other women. Based on female employees' responses, Fairygodboss scores companies on a scale of 0 to 100.\nNo company has come close to receiving a perfect score — yet. But some are certainly better than others. \nThe following companies are ranked as some of the best and fairest places for women to work : \n17. The Home Depot Joe Raedle/Getty Images \nOverall score:  60\nPercent of employees who say women are treated fairly and equally to men:  49% \nPercent of employees who would recommend the company to other women:  63% \nAverage job satisfaction rating out of five:  3.4 \nWhat an employee said about the company:  \n\"I worked a manual labor job, for which women aren't normally hired for but Home Depot hired me and, even though I heard a lot from customers about my gender my coworkers were always incredibly supportive and even told off a customer or two when it got ridiculous. Great company to work for.\" \n\n\n\n16. KPMG Glassdoor \nOverall score:  60.3\nPercent of employees who say women are treated fairly and equally to men:  53% \nPercent of employees who would recommend the company to other women:  56% \nAverage job satisfaction rating out of five:  3.6 \nWhat an employee said about the company:  \n\"KPMG has a myriad of ways to support all their employees. I found as a woman leader, I have tremendous opportunity and flexibility to achieve the career aspirations I desire. I have witnessed leaders in the firm bending over backwards to make it work for employees. It is a caring, family oriented workplace that will go to the mattresses for their people. \"\n\n\n\n\n15. JP Morgan Chase & Co Courtesy of JPMorgan Chase \nOverall score:  62\nPercent of employees who say women are treated fairly and equally to men:   \nPercent of employees who would recommend the company to other women:   \nAverage job satisfaction rating out of five:   \nWhat an employee said about the company:  \n\"The company offers great opportunities for advancement overall, however many of the best paid functions are still heavily dominated by men.\"\n\n\n\nSee the rest of the story at Business Insider ",

      "title": "2016 Apple Black Friday Ad: These MacBook, iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch Deals Are Worth Checking Out",
      "text": "\nThe Apple Black Friday ad is one of the most anticipated sales of the holiday season and shoppers are hoping to snag a great deal on a new MacBook, iPhone, iPad, or Apple Watch. Whether you are buying a gift for yourself or someone on your list, the Apple Store may not be your best bet if you’re looking for the best price on new tech goodies.\nUnless you love getting a cool Apple Store gift bag, it’s worth checking out this year’s doorbuster deals at authorized Apple resellers including Target, Walmart, Best Buy, Costco, and Sam’s Club.\nBefore you head out to shop on Black Friday, check out this list of the best 2016 Apple Black Friday deals.\nKeep in mind, not all stores will be open on Thanksgiving (November 24) and stores open early Friday (November 25), but Deal News reports that many big box retailers will be offering many of their deals online.\nAlthough previews for many Black Friday ads have already leaked out online, Apple is once again keeping their deals top secret. Their ad is typically released just hours before the sale starts, but, in recent years, their sale prices didn’t even come close to the discounts offered by their resellers.\nAccording to BF Ads , last year’s Apple Store Black Friday sale featured discounts between $10 to $101 off on a variety of Apple products and accessories and it’s expected that their holiday deals won’t be much different this year.\nThis year, it looks like the big box stores will once again be the place to shop, especially if you’re looking for deals on the iPad, an iPhone, or an Apple Watch.\nApple Watch \nApple Watch [Image by Eric Thayer/Getty Images] If you can live with a Series 1 Apple Watch, Deal News states that the lowest price (so far) is at Target where is will be priced at $198 on Black Friday, at least $21 lower than other retailers.\niPad \nApple iPad [Image by Peter Macdiarmid/Getty Images] Target will also be the place to shop for the 32GB Apple iPad Pro (9.7″) — the price for Black Friday shoppers will be $559, but if you need even more memory, the adscan for BJ’s Wholesale Club indicates that you can scoop up the 128GB version for $589.99 (club membership required).\nOther iPad offers worth checking out include the iPad Air 2 for $274 (Target) and the iPad mini 2 32 GB for $199 (Walmart). Deal News states that the Target offer is available online and in-store starting on Thanksgiving, but quantities will be limited. As far as the Walmart iPad offer goes, the iPad mini will also be available in limited quantities starting Thursday, November 24 at 6 p.m. ET, online or in-store.\niPhone \niPhone 7 [Image by Spencer Platt/Getty Images] If you want to buy yourself a new iPhone on Black Friday, a number of retailers will lure you in by offering a store gift card with purchase – great idea if you are going to do more holiday shopping in that store.\nThis year’s gift cards are high in value with the Huffington Post reporting that Target offering a $250 store gift card and $0 down for an iPhone 7 (contract required) and Best Buy is offering a $100 gift card when you upgrade to an iPhone 7 and choose installment billing.\niMac and MacBook \n[Image by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images] So far, Best Buy seems to have the best Black Friday deals on Apple laptops and desktops. Their sale runs throughout the weekend and many items will be available online, although doorbusters may be limited in quantity.\nThe retailers preview ad shows that both the 13.3″ MacBook and the 21.5 iMac will be priced at $999 each. If you have a MacBook Pro, Best Buy is offering a minimum $250 gift card when you trade in select models and a minimum $150 gift card when you trade in select models of the MacBook Air.\nKeep in mind, Apple products are extremely popular and often sell out quickly during the pre-holiday sales — make sure to do your price checking and make a shopping strategy in advance so you don’t end up empty-handed.\n[Featured Image by Eric Thayer/Getty Images]\n2016 Apple Black Friday Ad: These MacBook, iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch Deals Are Worth Checking Out is an article from: The Inquisitr News \n",

      "text": "Print What is the greatest power of the presidency? Is it the power to enact laws? Is it the power to order military attacks? How about the power to pardon criminals and commute prison sentences? All of those are awesome weapons in the chief executive's arsenal. But the most powerful thing the President of the United States can do is send a clear message via the bully pulpit. \nWithout having to sign a bill or use an Executive Order, a president can make things happen simply by saying it's the right thing to do. And even though he's still only President-elect, Donald Trump is using this power and getting results. \nWe learned that last night when Ford finally came out and definitively promised it would not move its Lincoln MKC plant from Louisville, Kentucky to Mexico. Trump happily made the announcement on his Twitter account: Tweet \nSkeptics and Trump detractors jumped all over the tweets, insisting that Ford had never made any solid plans to move the plant in the first place. But as CNBC Auto and Airline Industry Reporter Phil Lebeau explained , Trump can indeed claim a victory here by \"getting Ford to reverse plans to move the MKC out of Louisville at some point in the future.\" \nAnd that's not all, Trump's \"Made in America\" message also seems to have spurred Apple to consider some form of iPhone production in the United States. One report says the company asked its Chinese-based suppliers to start coming up with ideas on how to move some production to America. It's probably no coincidence that June was when even the ever-faulty pre-election polls showed Trump at his strongest levels of the campaign. \nThere could be more announcements and stories like this in the coming months through the first 100 days and even first year of Trump's presidency. And even if none of them individually or even collectively actually make a difference in economic growth, it's important to remember that perception is almost always greater than reality in politics. \nThese kinds of small public relations victories will be helpful for Trump who is coming into office with such high unfavorable ratings and so many Americans actively refusing to accept his election victory. But all you have to do is ask the Clinton campaign and the Democratic Party about how perceptions can change and it's best to have real accomplishments on your side in the long run. \nPresident Obama was able to point to the very slow recovery in the most positive light for most of his two terms in office. It helped him win re-election in 2012 and it seems to be keeping his approval rating above 50 percent as he begins his final two months in office. But Hillary Clinton's happy talk about the economy during the election fell flat because there just wasn't enough economic growth to justify it. Call it bad luck or just bad timing, Clinton found out there is indeed an expiration date on positive political perceptions. \nTrump isn't likely to get the kind of grace period President Obama enjoyed. The best he can probably hope for is the timetable president Reagan faced when he took office in 1981. The nation actually went into recession in 1982 and had not shown much real recovery through most of 1983. \nBy September of '83, Reagan's poll numbers were weak as the period of optimism he initiated was waning. Had the first few months of 1984 not produced the kind of stronger economic numbers that they did, it's arguable even the enormously popular Reagan would have been defeated in November instead of winning a 49-state landslide. \nTrump is going to need solid numbers, starting with some form of sustained GDP growth at or very close to the three percent level to win over more suspicious voters and keep most of his existing base. \nReal wage growth will need to be higher by 2019 or so. And if higher interest rates are coming, they'll have to find a sweet spot that keeps retirees and cash investors happy without destroying the housing market with soaring mortgage rates. Trump and his team believe reducing corporate taxes, repatriating cash held overseas, and creating large amounts of infrastructure and defense manufacturing jobs will do the trick. \nBut with a Republican Congress in tow, Trump will have few excuses in the years to come if his favored economic bills are passed and they don't produce the promised results. For now, and maybe for another year or so, little symbolic victories like the Ford announcement and the Apple story will be fine enough. But at some point, Trump will have to deliver the goods. \nCommentary by Jake Novak, CNBC.com senior columnist.

      "text": "  KGI Securities released a new research report last week, detailing information about the possible development of iPhones in 2017. While some details contradict earlier reports the report does affirm recent reports stating, that Apple might actually release three iPhone models next year. Apart from the regular 4.7 and 5.5 inch models with LCD screens that will continue to be available and will be slightly updated as well, a possible third iPhone is said to get most of the attention of the Apple team next year. According to KGI, this premium model will have an active display area between 5.1 and 5.2 inches but the OLED panel used will actually be 5.8 inch in size, extending over the edges of the iPhone, making it the first wrap-around screen on any iPhone. KGI further specified, that this OLED display will come from Samsung exclusively. The OLED-model will also have the Home Button integrated beneath the display. There simply won't be enough OLED-panels next year, which seems to be the main reason why Apple apparently decided to continue offering the two regular models as well. Those LCD models will be updated with new glass designs and the Plus model will receive optical image stabilization on both lenses next year. Apple may also consider selling the LCD models for a cheaper price next year, to increase market share.  ",

Others were inspired to create memes or tweet about how this book could possibly work without any adapters or that it just might be the best Apple product because it does in fact not need any adapters contrary to every other Apple product of this year. Even Stephen Colbert was inspired to do a short commercial for the Apple Book for the Late Show last week and called the Apple Book the most advanced Book Apple ever made. We have attached the video down below, together with some of the most interesting tweets about the Apple Book. Many more can be found under the Hashtag #AppleBook in case you are bored. Oh and the next version of the Apple Book is rumored to be thinner and lighter, or so we heard ...  ",

      "text": "Cool Yule Tools- Hot Picks \nGiven that the overall design of the iPhone hasn't changed much since the release of the iPhone 6 back in 2014, there's a lot of pressure on Apple to deliver a home run when the company launches the iPhone 8 later next year. \nThough next year's iPhone would ordinarily be called the iPhone 7s, it's widely believed that Apple's next-gen iPhone will represent such a compelling upgrade that Apple will opt to call it the iPhone 8 instead. \nNow as for what Apple has in store for us with the iPhone 8, the company's plans are beginning to crystalize slowly but surely. According to analyst Ming-Chi Kuo ( via Apple Insider ), Apple next year will introduce three distinct iPhone models. \nOf course, we can expect to see a 4.7-inch iPhone 8 and a 5.5-inch iPhone 8 Plus. But the real star of Apple's upcoming iPhone lineup will be a premium version of the Plus that will feature an edgeless display along with a curved OLED panel. In contrast, Apple's non-premium iPhone models will continue to employ LCD panels. At this point, it remains unclear if every new iPhone model will feature a redesigned form factor or if Apple is reserving this special treatment for its top of the line iPhone exclusively. \nAs we've highlighted previously, a number of iPhone 8 rumors point to Apple's next-gen device sporting an edge to edge display with all of the accompanying sensors being embedded beneath the display itself. While some rumors have hinted that the home button itself might be integrated underneath the display, more recent reports suggest that the iPhone 8 will mostly be edgeless, save for a small bezel with the home button located towards the bottom. \nAlso of note are reports that Apple's iPhone 8 models will employ a glass casing strengthened by a stainless steel frame. Apple of course has used glass casings on the iPhone before, but we haven't seen it since the iPhone 4s was released back in 2011. \nAs for other iPhone 8 rumors that have been making the rounds this past week, another note from Ming-Chi Kuo relays that dual cameras on Apple's 5.5-inch iPhone 8 Plus and the premium iPhone 8 model will both feature dual optical image stabilization. As it stands now, only the wide-angle lens on the iPhone 7 Plus supports dual optical image stabilization.

This would allow the new home owner to control the thermostat, lights, locks, fans and more via commands made to Siri or via the Home app.Home owners could set scenes so that a single app on the \"I'm leaving\" box in the Home app automatically turns off the thermostat, locks doors, shuts the fan and does everything you want to lockdown the house in your absence. Scenes can be set for the morning, when you return from being out, and for the evening. You could also arrange to view live webcam of your doorway to see whose been knocking on your door, or ringing your bell (apologies to Men at Work and Paul McCartney and Wings).Apple hasn't officially announced that it has been working with home developers, but this would seem to make too much sense for Apple not to get involved in. One of the test homes for KB Homes' Magnolia complex at Patterson Ranch includes a unit pre-loaded with $30,000 worth of HomeKit products. Considering that these homes start at $900,000, the 3% extra cost might seem like a drop in the bucket to have all of the features offered by the Apple HomeKit accessories. It all means comfort and security. \nOne of the KB Homes at its Magnolia complex at Patterson Ranch that will offer HomeKit pre-installed\"",

Hide Caption 13 of 15 Photos: The cuckoo clock gets a modern makeover Back to the Trees by Clémentine Despocq – Clémentine Despocq's cuckoos have gone back to nature, abandoning their chalets for the simple comforts of the nest. Hide Caption 14 of 15 Photos: The cuckoo clock gets a modern makeover Coucou Time – Instead of just marking the time, Coucou Time celebrates is. The device diffuses the scent of spring time plants, using essential oils from plants gathered early this April. Hide Caption 15 of 15 (CNN) Corny, kitschy, quaint. The humble cuckoo clock can be described a number of different ways, but cool certainly isn't the first word that comes to mind. The best luxury timepieces of 2016 However, students at HEAD - Genève (Geneva University of Art and Design), one of Europe's most prestigious design schools, have tried to change that by giving the 400-year-old folk object a makeover, reimagining it as a stylish contemporary design object in \"24 Hours in the Life of a Swiss Cuckoo Clock.\" Since the designs were unveilved in 2015, the exhibition has popped up at Watches & Wonders 2015 in Hong Kong, the 2016 edition of Salon International de la Haute Horlogerie in Geneva, and this year's Salone del Mobile in Milan. Now the exhibition has landed at Dubai Watch Week. Read More The cuckoo gets chic With the generous support of the Fondation de la Haute Horlogerie, 18 students were tasked with the clock a contemporary makeover without sacrificing the cuckoo clock's two signatures: a clear story and a way to mark the passing of time. The resulting designs are as varied as they are inventive, involving iPads, cameras, ticker tape and, in one particularly conceptual case, a flask of essential oil.

      "text": "\nThe next generation of entry-level smartwatch.\n\nSerenity Caldwell has been writing and talking about and tinkering with Apple products since she was old enough to double-click. Managing editor of iMore, she hosts a number of popular podcasts and speaks frequently at conferences. In past lives she worked at Macworld and Apple Retail.\n\nWhen you're in the market for a smartwatch, you've got a number of factors to weigh before making your decision. Does it have health sensors? What's the battery life? Does it fit on the wrist of a human being? How much is it going to cost me? \nFor some, nothing but the latest and greatest model will do. And if you have an unlimited budget, I consider the Series 2 Apple Watch the best smartwatch you can pick up for your iPhone. But as we approach the holidays, let's be real: Few of us have unlimited budgets when it comes to ourselves or presents for others. And a $369+ starting price — not including extra bands or different case designs — can prove steep for families on a budget.\nWhat to do, then, when price is a concern but you still want a smartwatch for you or a loved one? For most of its other product lines, Apple's answer is usually to serve up the previous model at a discount; that said, much as I praised the promise of my Apple Watch \"Series 0,\" the reality was this: It was slow, and its battery sucked. And the company knew it.\nRather than sell customers a vastly inferior product to its Series 2 smartwatch, Apple decided to nix the Series 0 altogether, presenting customers with a special Series 1 Apple Watch. Unlike its more expensive cousin, the Series 1 is limited to the company's aluminum casing (though that includes all four of its colors) and attached Sport band, lacks a bigger battery, and eschews the improved water resistance, brighter screen, and Series 2 GPS chip.\nWhere the Series 1 triumphs over the original generation, however, is in speed. It has the same snappier processor as the Series 2, though the system-in-a-package is slightly different in its tech specs owing to the lack of GPS add-on. Apple calls it S1P vs. the S1 of the original and the S2 of the Series 2.\nCouple that with watchOS 3 , and the Series 1 has one heck of an engine under its aluminum hood.\nTesting ground \nI originally picked up a Series 1 Apple Watch model to test it against the Series 2 model; as such, I've worn it on and off since mid-September. From mid-October on, however, I wore the Series 1 as my primary Apple Watch. I occasionally did the double-watch-on-a-single-arm trick for certain benchmarks, but by and large I used the Series 1 as if it were my one and only watch.\nIt trained at the gym and attended concerts. It timed boiling water and took Siri dictation. And, as any good smartwatch should, it told me the time.\nDesign \nThe Series 1 watch is nigh-identical to Apple's original Series 0 design, and looks the same as the Series 2, though small details give it away.\nFor one thing, it doesn't have the extra .9mm depth that the Series 2 acquired in its redesign, likely owing to the bigger battery in the higher-end model and the lack of improved water resistance. It also doesn't sport that fancy new water-spitting speaker (my secret favorite feature).\nIn the real world, this doesn't translate to much. The Series 1's on-board speaker is slightly more tinny and softer than the Series 2, though most users may never notice, given the Watch's few options for playing sound. You can probably take it in the shower — Apple CEO, Tim Cook always did with his Series 0, after all — though keep in mind that the Series 1's rubber gaskets may wear over time and expose the internals to water damage.\n\nAnd of course, if you want the entry-level Apple Watch, you give up the option for nicer casings: the Series 1 is limited to just the silver, space grey, gold, and rose gold aluminum with one Sport Band pairing for each. Thankfully, the color choices are all quite nice — I've mostly stuck to the Pink Sand Sport Band with my 38mm rose gold Series 1 watch, from which I've gotten a smattering of compliments over my weeks testing it.\nOutside of those changes, I'm going to refer you almost exclusively to my Series 2 review if you desire more information about the various casings and designs.\nSpeed and battery: The name of the game \nIf you're considering upgrading from a Series 0 this holiday, you're going to do it because of speed. I've tried very hard to produce variations in speed between my various watches, and the Series 1 and 2 are neck and neck in every single test. In some — booting, for instance — the Series 1 was regularly a good :20 to :30 faster than the Series 2 (which regularly boots in ~1:40), and a full minute faster than Series 0 (~2:20). A one minute boot time still isn't great for a smartwatch, but if you're lucky, you'll only ever have to reboot when installing a new update.\nThat's because, like the Series 2, battery life is much improved. But unlike the Series 2, you can't attribute this to a bigger battery; the Series 1 has the exact same size as the original Apple Watch. Instead, the praise can go to watchOS 3 and the S1P's incredible process optimization.\nIt's not really fair to compare a brand new Apple Watch's battery to that of a 17-month old version — wear and tear take their toll on batteries as much as anything else — but even taking the age of my Series 0 watch into account, the Series 1 gets monumentally better battery life. My 38mm original watch is often dead by 4PM after a morning workout; my Series 1 has only given up the ghost once, and that was after wearing it for a full day and night (though, I should note, not having it do much) and then working out the next morning. (And it did make it back home after my work out before dying!)\n\nThe Series 2 battery still bests the Series 1 if you avoid GPS workouts; even when adding GPS-intensive workouts into the mix, the Series 2 still gets an edge, though only an extra hour or two. Either way, if you want the best battery life Apple can offer, the Series 2 is the better bet — but its entry-level smartwatch is still a vast upgrade from the original.\nIf you're a workout fiend, Apple also offers a nice hack for saving battery life: Pairing an external Bluetooth heart rate monitor . I've been testing several in the last week for a separate iMore roundup, and on average, a paired Bluetooth heart monitor saved ~10-15% battery life during an hour workout (compared to an hour workout using the Apple Watch's built-in health sensors).\nNitpicks and grumbles \nI don't have many nits to pick when it comes to the Series 1 in of itself: I do wish you could get it with a Woven Nylon bands rather than the Sport option, but that's a minor complaint in the grand scheme of things. Ultimately, the Series 1 fulfills its reason for existing — to be a usable, low-cost version of last year's model.\nIf you're in the mood for grumbles, however, I'll point you to my small problems with the Apple Watch platform, found in my Series 2 review .\nBottom line \nFor new Apple Watch owners, the Series 1's role is clear: It's the budget Apple Watch, there to offer a reasonable cost of entry to the Apple Watch platform. It's still an excellent product; it just doesn't have the extra bells and whistles the Series 2 offers. If you have the cash to spare, the Series 2 can be a more enticing package, but the Series 1 is no slouch — and makes for a pretty nice present.\nFor existing Series 0 owners, the waters are murkier. The Series 1 replaces their original model with something vastly better in some ways, like battery and speed, but is otherwise largely identical to the version they already own. Whether it's worth the upgrade largely depends on how you use your current Apple Watch.\nAs with my Series 2 review, I'd recommend an upgrade whole-heartedly to 38mm users who got rather short-shrifted on Series 0 battery. But if you're happy with your Apple Watch and watchOS 3, you can probably remain happy with it for another year or so. (Heck, if you manage to hold out until the next upgrade cycle, you'll likely get the perks of Series 2 at a Series 1 price!)\nWhatever your circumstances, it's easier than ever to enter the Apple Watch ecosystem. No, watchOS 3 isn't perfect: But it's useable, fun to use, and a great overall smartwatch system for iOS users.\nApple Watch \nwatchOS 3 review Apple Watch Series 2 review Apple Watch buyers guide Apple Watch users guide Apple Watch news Apple Watch discussion Buy at Apple ",

      "text": "Apple Pay advertising sparks strong rise in contactless payments at vending machines By   18:16   19:32 INSIGHTS: USAT study shows advertising acts as an ‘electronic gateway’ for consumers \nDigital advertising promoting the availability of Apple Pay at unattended vending machines has resulted in a 36.5% increase in overall sales for cashless vending machine technology provider USA Technologies (USAT) as well as a 135.2% increase in NFC mobile payments, a six-month study now available to download from the NFC World Knowledge Centre reveals. \n‘Targeted Advertising Leads to Surge in Sales and Apple Pay Use’ — produced by USAT — also reveals that Apple Pay advertising at machines fitted with the company’s ePort Interactive platform have resulted in a 55.5% increase in revenue through contactless purchases and a 44.6% increase in total transactions. \nThe company also witnessed a 6% increase in total contactless average ticket value — the average sale price of transactions that were made using a mobile wallet. \n“Based on our study, we believe that when businesses and operators present consumers with the option to pay for items with Apple Pay, the number of mobile payments made and the amount spent increases,” says Maeve McKenna Duska, senior vice president of marketing and sales at USAT. \n“The data from this study suggests that call-to-action messages underscoring speed, convenience and security of Apple Pay can act as an electronic gateway for consumers to learn about and use the mobile wallets already installed on their phones. Unattended markets are continuing to drive Apple Pay usage as it offers consumers a simple and convenient way to pay without cash or a credit card.” \nThe study measures the impact of targeted digital advertising screens on consumers’ use of mobile wallets — primarily Apple Pay — across 35 vending machines located in New York and Louisiana over a six-month period from March to August 2016. \nUSAT added support for Apple Pay into 200,000 acceptance points in January 2015. \nThe full research findings are available to download free of charge from the NFC World Knowledge Centre .",

      "text": "Apple makes plea for inclusivity in touching holiday spot By Minda Smiley - 21 November 2016 20:34pm \nLast year, Stevie Wonder was the star of Apple’s holiday ad . This year, the tech giant is featuring a celebrity of a different kind in its holiday campaign – Mary Shelley’s iconic Frankenstein monster. \nThe spot, aptly titled ‘Frankie’s Holiday,’ opens with a shot of Frankenstein’s monster – played by actor Brad Garrett - as he records a music box version of ‘There’s No Place Like Home for the Holidays’ on his iPhone while sitting alone in his hilltop cabin. He then braves the snow to pick up a small package before heading into a nearby village. \nWhen he spots a crowd of villagers who’ve gathered together to see the town’s Christmas tree, he makes his way to the middle and pulls out two red and green Christmas bulbs from the package he’s been carrying. He then screws the bulbs onto his neck, pulls out his iPhone and nervously begins singing ‘There’s No Place Like Home’ to his recorded soundtrack as the crowd of bewildered onlookers watch. \nAfter one of his bulbs burns out and a few people in the crowd begin to jeer, he loses courage and stops his performance – but then regains his confidence after a little girl helps him turn his bulb back on and encourages him to start singing again. The entire town then joins in on the carol, a gesture that brings a tear to the monster’s eye. \nDirected by Park Pictures’ Lance Acord, the whimsical spot ends with the words “open your heart to everyone,” a timely message in light of one of the most divisive and contentious elections in American history. As people prepare for the dreaded but inevitable politically-charged arguments that are likely to take place over Thanksgiving and Christmas this year, Apple’s message of inclusivity reminds people to accept everyone, regardless of their views and backgrounds, this holiday season. \nThis article is about: North America , Apple , holiday , Creative , Advertising , Technology , Brand Minda Smiley \nMinda Smiley is The Drum's US advertising reporter, covering how brands and agencies are using today's platforms, technologies and innovations to connect with consumers.",

Although Apple has become part of the establishment now, they still strive to highlight the innovations, they integrate into their products. \"Ideas push the world forward\" are the words, Apple chose at the end of a series of famous human inventions and innovations, that are briefly shown in Apple's newest promo video for the new MacBook Pro, that was recently introduced integrating a new Touch Bar instead of the more traditional function keys.

      "title": "Apple gets warm and fuzzy for holidays",
      "text": "Apple gets warm and fuzzy for holidays Posted: \nBy Patrick May \npmay@bayareanewsgroup.com \nFirst came Amazon, with its heartwarming if slightly sappy television ad proposing a kumbayah moment for the postelection discord consuming the nation of late. That ad featured an aging priest and an imam enjoying a bit of bromance while ordering cool things for each other on Amazon Prime. \nThis week, as Donald Trump tweets out curious messages in the middle of the night and his vice president-elect gets schooled by the cast of “Hamilton,” we have Apple weighing in with its own why-can’t-we-all-just-get-along pitch. \nApple’s 2016 Christmas ad features Frankenstein’s monster making an awkward attempt to play nice with his fellow villagers in some snowbound hamlet and, in the process, warming the cockles of everyone’s heart, both on-screen and off. The monster is played by “Everybody Loves Raymond” star Brad Garrett, who also did “Pocahontas II: Journey to a New World,”“An Extremely Goofy Movie,” and “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows.” \nIn his Apple role, instead of coming out of the shadows, Garrett’s creepy character comes out of his isolated cabin, bringing with him the gift of song to his startled neighbors. “An unexpected holiday visitor finally receives the warm welcome he’s always yearned for,” the ad’s description on YouTube says. \nWith “No Place Like Home” playing in the background, the monster is embraced by the village, much like Apple apparently wants us all to embrace each other, regardless of which side of the political aisle we sit on, and preferably holding an iPhone 7 while we do it. \nThe two commercials represent a major cheek-turning, as both Apple and Amazon have been stung by election politics. In February, candidate Trump blasted Apple for not cooperating with an FBI request and subsequent court order to help investigators unlock the encrypted iPhone of one of the San Bernardino shooters. \nApple CEO Tim Cook did not support Trump in the election and afterward wrote an internal memo to Apple employees, basically telling them to stand united, regardless of whom they supported in the campaign. \n“We have a very diverse team of employees, including supporters of each of the candidates. Regardless of which candidate each of us supported as individuals, the only way to move forward is to move forward together,” Cook wrote in the memo. \n“I recall something Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. said 50 years ago: ‘If you can’t fly, then run. If you can’t run, then walk. If you can’t walk, then crawl, but whatever you do, you have to keep moving forward.’ This advice is timeless, and a reminder that we only do great work and improve the world by moving forward.” Advertisement \nAmazon CEO Jeff Bezos, who owns the Washington Post, also took heat from Trump during his White House run. Coming on the heels of a report that the Post had put together a team of 20 reporters to dig into Trump’s real estate holdings, the candidate attacked Bezos and accused him of using the newspaper to try to fight against higher taxes for Amazon. \nTrump said the company is “getting away with murder, taxwise. (Bezos is) using the Washington Post for power so that the politicians in Washington don’t tax Amazon like they should be taxed,” Trump told Fox News host Sean Hannity.",

      "text": "– A + Apple patents foldable iPhone with flexible display that can clip onto clothing By Mikey Campbell \nTuesday, November 22, 2016, 12:21 am PT (03:21 am ET) \nAn Apple patent published Tuesday reveals the company has for years been actively investigating a hinged iPhone format, with designs calling for a flexible metal-backed OLED display capable of being folded in half. \n\n\nSource: USPTO \n\nAs granted by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, Apple's U.S. Patent No. 9,504,170 for \"Flexible display devices\" describes an iPhone with a foldable full-screen display. Like clamshell cellphones popularized by Motorola in the 1990s, Apple's proposed design also folds in two when not in use for easy storage.\n\nTo achieve a foldable format, Apple's invention relies on a number of flexible components, the most important being an OLED display and metal support structure. For the latter, the document proposes nitinol, a nickel and titanium alloy known for its elasticity and unique shape memory abilities. Alternative embodiments involve flexible polymers.\n\n\n\n\nIn some examples, the foldable phone incorporates a chassis or device housing split into upper and lower sections, each containing processors, sensors and other typical smartphone circuitry. For example, an upper housing might include cameras, display controllers, speaker modules and light sensors, while the bottom portion holds microphones, CPU and GPU, vibrator and other necessary parts. \n\nThe two pieces are attached via a single- or multi-shaft hinge mechanism supporting rotational motion, allowing the two housing portions to move relative one another. Connections between upper and lower housing are accomplished through flexible printed circuit boards.\n\nInstalled over the two housing structures is the display. Interestingly, Apple's document notes the flexible screen can include extra material to accommodate two or more folding configurations. \n\n\n\n\nIn one example, the proposed smartphone is able to fold the screen onto itself like old clamshell cellphones, offering additional protection from the elements. An opposite configuration describes the display as facing outward for easy operating access. In this second orientation, the device housing can include sawtooth detents at its distal ends for clipping onto a user's clothing.\n\nAlternatively, the display can be made to retract within one or both housings. To alleviate stresses on the sensitive OLED component, Apple suggests tensioning members and rollers be employed for dispensing and retracting the display during hinge rotation. \n\nThe document goes on to detail two-hinge designs, cover glass and viewing angle considerations, and various alternative embodiments.\n\n\n\n\nConsidering iPhone's design progression over nearly ten years, it is unlikely that Apple will release a foldable format smartphone anytime soon. That being said, the technology outlined in today's invention might one day make its way into other product lines like MacBook or iPad. \n\nApple is widely rumored to release an iPhone model with flexible OLED display in 2017, but the form factor is expected to remain faithful to current candy bar style designs. \n\nApple's foldable iPhone patent was first filed for in July 2014 and credits Fletcher R. Rothkopf, Andrew J. M. Janis and Teodor Dabov as its inventors.",

      "title": "Buyers' guide: Choosing the perfect MacBook model from Apple's numerous new offerings",
      "text": "Buyers' guide: Choosing the perfect MacBook model from Apple's numerous new offerings By Tuesday, November 22, 2016, 05:31 am PT (08:31 am ET) Apple has three distinct lines of laptop computers —MacBook Air, MacBook, and MacBook Pro —but the lines between them can be pretty hazy. If you're in the market for yourself, or somebody you know, AppleInsider can help if you know the answers to a few, basic questions. When a business has a need, they decide on what they need to buy not only by looking at the budget first and last, but also honest assessment of use cases for the hardware. We're going to look at it the same way. Part 1 - How much to spend? Everybody wants a supercomputer that will run everything seamlessly for $200 with the best of everything. Everybody also knows that it's not possible. Going into the needs assessment honestly, with that in mind, makes for better choices. Even so, a wide array of Apple gear can be disqualified just based on what you want to spend. Limited to under $1000 and still want new? There's really only one choice —the 13-inch MacBook Air . Different classes of machines are intended for different needs, and different market segments. Just a couple hundred dollars more than that opens up the ultra-slim 12-inch MacBook (2016 models start at $1,199 from authorized resellers). A few hundred more than that allows for a brand-new MacBook Pro purchase, scaling up to over $3,000 depending on configuration and inclusion of a Touch Bar. Part 2 - What's the main job? Different users have different use cases. A 45-year-old parent of four may be seeking something to communicate with, and play \"World of Warcraft\" on after-hours, but a 28-year old novelist may have zero interest in gaming at all. A 35-year old professional could be seeking 3D modeling, illustration, or the like, making the situation more complex. Apple's 13-inch MacBook Air is the entry into the Apple ecosystem. While a very solid machine, and a tried-and-true design, the hardware is the least powerful of Apple's portable array. The MacBook has about the same overall daily performance as the MacBook Air, but adds a 12-inch Retina-class screen, all housed in a thinner case than the MacBook Air. If performance is an issue, or if you need the Wide Color display , the the 2016 MacBook Pro is the only way to go. The 13-inch 2016 MacBook Pro line have dual-core processors, with the heavy-hitter quad-core processors on the 15-inch MacBook Pro. Part 3 - What are specific work needs? Just about anything Apple makes can be used for general purpose web-surfing and communication, so a laptop choice isn't particularly bound by that. Other work tasks, like the aforementioned 3D modeling, or illustration does have requirements which are mostly dictated by the software needed for the application. However, there are some mitigating factors. The MacBook Air is the only remaining new Apple laptop with legacy ports, like the rectangular USB-A connector, Thunderbolt 2, and a SD card reader which keep \"dongle\" purchases to a minimum. The MacBook is the most sparse of the three Apple laptop families, with just the single USB 3.0 type-C port. Nearly any form of wired connectivity requires an adapter, or what is for now a special cable. The MacBook Pro has either two or four Thunderbolt 3 ports , utilizing the USB-C form factor. This cuts down on the need for some form of dock or hub for multiple device connectivity, but amplifies any adapters that might be needed. USB-C is the future, the same as USB was when the original iMac was released. As more companies shift to the new standard, the need for an adapter will lessen, somewhat. Part 4 - What about that \"after hours\" thing? All work and no... you get the idea. In the case of the 45-year-old parent, the MacBook Air or MacBook aren't going to cut it very well with modern titles. However, our novelist will be fine with either the MacBook Air. The MacBook Air utilizes the Intel HD Graphics 6000 chipset. The display is 1440x900, but will support a 4K display externally though Mini DisplayPort. Game titles more than about four years old should play fine on the MacBook Air. The MacBook has a built-in 12-inch Retina display, supported by the Intel HD Graphics 515 chipset. Despite the lower number than the MacBook Air, the GPU on the MacBook is better than the one on the MacBook. Similarly to the MacBook Air, games more than three years old will generally be fine. Moving up to the MacBook Pro doesn't initially help that much. While faster, the 13-inch MacBook Pro line also relies on integrated graphical chipsets. As such, games about two years old will generally be okay. The most modern titles are only practical on the MacBook Pro 15-inch model, and then really only on the Radeon Pro 455 or Radeon Pro 460-equipped systems. There has been talk , and some movement as of late, regarding external GPU solutions for macOS, but nothing is really ready for prime time for general users at this time. Purchasers should make a decision based on an external, affordable, easy-to-use external GPU never becoming available for the mainstream user. Part 5 - What about last year's model, or used? Intel's recent \"tick-tock-tock\" CPU development has guaranteed that the already long-lived Apple hardware keeps its reputation. CPU performance has been relatively flat for the last few years, with the biggest improvements being in battery life and GPU technology both in integrated and discrete offerings. If general communication is the name of the game, then anything Apple's made in the last four years will be just fine —but so will an iPad or iPhone. From a used gear pricing standpoint, while a MacBook Air from 2013 is generally available for around $600 , $400 less than the current MacBook Air , the 2013 15-inch Retina MacBook Pro has legacy ports, and is roughly 75% of the overall performance of the 2016 15-inch Retina MacBook Pro —and can be had for under $1,000 . If you're considering a used or previous year's model, the same evaluation process applies, just across a wider range of hardware. Different classes of machines are intended for different needs, and different market segments. A gamer is still better suited with a discrete GPU —but a new machine with an integrated GPU may perform better than an older one with that separate GPU. Pure number-crunching is still best done on a quad-core machine. Larger screens are generally better for media consumption, and so forth. Buy when you need! Just like there's always something older, there's always something new coming. Apple hasn't updated its MacBook Pro hardware in a while, because there really hasn't been a compelling reason to do so. Selection of hardware has always been complex, and there's no perfect solution for every need, even with a large budget. Additional ways to save No matter the budget, there are easy ways to save on Apple hardware. Many Apple authorized resellers only collect sales tax in certain states and offer steep discounts on previous-gen models. B&H Photo , for instance, collects sales tax in NY only, while Adorama , another authorized Apple reseller, collects tax in NY and NJ. Adorama also offers AI readers exclusive discounts on a variety of Apple product lines, including 2016 MacBook Pros.

      "text": "What Apple needs to get right to make its rumoured smart glasses a success November 22, 2016 by Paul Levy, The Conversation Goggle Glass: what not to do. Credit: Shutterstock \nThe Apple rumour mill is spinning with gossip that the company is reportedly developing and testing a set of augmented reality glasses. There's little we know for certain about the plans, and the firm has reportedly not made a final decision about whether to commit to releasing a \"smart glasses\" product. But Apple has been enthusiastically recruiting engineers with expertise in both augmented and virtual reality . \nThere is strong speculation that any new wearable device from Apple will integrate with an iPhone and need one to operate, just as the Apple Watch does. Another rumour suggests Apple will add augmented reality capabilities to its iPhone camera so that it could recognise objects it filmed, including people's faces. This raises the question of whether Apple would develop an additional wearable device that risked cannibalising a technology built into its flagship product. \nBut if the rumours of Apple's smart glasses are true, there is plenty the company could learn from previous, largely unsuccessful attempts to make a head-mounted augmented reality display. When Google announced it was ceasing sales of its own Google Glass spectacles, some saw it as the start of a new phase of product development while others pronounced it a failure. \nPrivacy problems \nSome of the key reasons why Glass was ultimately unsuccessful related to concerns about privacy and security. And there is little or no evidence those concerns have lessened in the last few years. With increasing numbers of reports about cameras being hijacked by hackers , fraudsters and even blackmailers , any new smart glasses could be seen as a window into our world for criminals. \nThere would certainly be doubts about giving a corporation direct access to what we see with our own eyes. Trust will be a key issue, and is still low between corporations and the public . As even the iPhone is no longer the legendary unhackable device it was once seen as, Apple would need to fundamentally boost consumer trust and confidence for it to win customers over. Microsoft Hololens: who cares how it looks when it works? Credit: Microsoft \nOther reasons cited for the failure of similar products included cost, limited battery life, our attachment to mobile phones and unwearable design. Alongside smartphones, virtual reality headsets , smart watches and so on, smart glasses may be one gadget too many, especially as Apple entry level prices are still high for many consumers. Consumers have also been bruised by under-performing and even dangerous batteries, and smart glasses would be another device that drains the iPhone and needs its own charging. \nIn terms of design, many users ditched Google Glass because it was a long way from being seen as cool. Apple's product will need to be something we actually want to wear when we are on pubic view. The company may do well to root a new spectacle product in the functional minimalism of its smartphone and tablet ranges. Yet while that design ethos has lifted Apple to the number one spot in the last decade, those designs are now also being seen as becoming too safe and repetitive. \nMicrosoft is taking another tack with its HoloLens . In contrast to Google Glass, the device opts for an overtly tech look, an unashamedly prosthetic, even cyborg device. As a result, early reviews of the Hololens look past fashion design towards its potential for radical disruption. \nThere may be another more fundamental difficulty for Apple, however. Some commentators are suggesting current augmented reality technology is still too difficult for us to physically interact with . Apple would have to convince users that their new glasses are easy to use and will not lead us into brick walls or awkward interactions with family, colleagues, friends and strangers. \nAll this is important because Apple has been trading on long-past acts of creativity for years now. Judged by the mixed reaction to the Apple Watch, it's not yet clear that wearables can change this situation or that a new set of smart glasses will represent a genuine disruption. There's a chance that attempting to succeed with augmented reality will be seen as another \"me-too\" behaviour for the company. \nYet if Hololens or other products help augmented reality 's day to arrive sooner, and if Apple gets things right in terms of design, user experience, confidence and trust, it could be a breakthrough for the company.",

      "text": "In a surprise move, Apple might just give tech-happy holiday shoppers an early gift to start the season. The company updated its homepage Tuesday with a bold declaration for its biggest fans: \"Friday can't come soon enough.\"\nSEE ALSO: Apple's holiday ad delivers heartfelt chills\nYou read that right. For the first time since 2014, Apple is once again participating in Black Friday. And unlike its deal two years ago, when the company simply offered iTunes gift cards with certain purchases, Apple is teasing a discount on hardware. The homepage image displays a shiny new Apple Watch.\nDetails are sparse, however. The only thing we know boils down to two sentences: \"Our one-day shopping event will be here before you know it. Come back this Friday to check everyone off your list.\"\nUntil now, we've depended on Apple's retail partners as the only place to find deals on any of the iDevices we're hoping to give (or just straight up buy for ourselves) over the holidays. Just this year, we assumed that the best sale we could expect on the 12.9-inch iPad Pro would either be available at HHGregg or Walmart.\nApple's recent holiday initiatives have been centered less on doorbuster-style deals and more on gestures — promotions for the PRODUCT(RED) AIDS initiative, for example.\nAsked about skipping out on Black Friday at the 2015 Fast Company Innovation Festival, Apple SVP of Retail and Online Stores Angela Ahrendts said \"being good to your employees will always be good for business,\" according to 9to5mac .\nApparently, 2016 is different. While there is no concrete information available on exactly what will be on sale, the homepage touts free two-day delivery on in-stock items before 5 p.m., Apple Store App capabilities and extended in-store hours, which appear to vary by location.\nIf you're planning on going to a brick-and-mortar Apple Store, be sure to call ahead or check online to confirm the hours. And be ready for the massive Black Friday turnout that only Apple can draw. If you think Best Buy and Walmart pull in the crowds, you've got another thing coming.\nBONUS: These self-driving buses could make owning a car totally pointless",

      "text": "Home / News / Internet News / Apple teases Black Friday sales event – best early deals and what to expect Apple teases Black Friday sales event – best early deals and what to expect \nby James Laird Read Comments \nApple has seemingly confirmed it will be staging a rare one-day Black Friday sales event. Here are all the best UK Apple deals, sales and discounts you can look forward to this year. \nThe vaguely festive image you see above landed on the Apple UK website earlier today, inviting shoppers to return to the iPhone 7 , iPad Pro , and Apple Watch 2 maker's digital home on Friday. \nRelated: Best Black Friday deals \nWhy Friday? Well, while Apple may be trying to bill the event as its own special \"shopping event,\" the fact is that it's Black Friday, so it would seem that Apple is trying to grab itself a bigger slice of the Black Friday pie in 2016. \nHistorically, Apple has somewhat poo-pooed the Black Friday shopping bonanza, offering (at best) piddling discounts on some of its products. Could that be set to change in 2016? \nThe inclusion of an Apple Watch render in the teaser image may indicate the company is preparing to offer more significant price slashes on some of its smartwatches, with the older Apple Watch Series 1 the obvious candidate. \nOther products likely to be discounted include the 11-inch MacBook Air , which is now essentially on life support following the new 13-inch MacBook Pro (2016) reveal, and potentially older iPads and iPhones. \nIn fact, we've already spotted a corker of an iPhone deal to get you in the mood. \nRight now over on eBay, you can bag yourself a SIM-free 128GB iPhone 6 for as little as £285 . While it's a couple of years old and the phone in question is a refurbished number, that's still a great price given the high storage capacity – an iPhone 7 with a similar amount of room costs around £700!",

      "text": "Apple is bringing in help to boost its News app.\nApple is going to hand over ad sales for the app to Comcast’s NBCUniversal* in an exclusive deal that starts in January.\nPublishers who put content on the app can still sell their own ads and will keep 100 percent of the revenue from any ads they sell. The new deal means that NBCUniversal, instead of Apple, will sell any remaining ad inventory.\nAs before, publishers will keep 70 percent of those sales . In a note to her staff, NBCUniversal sales boss Linda Yaccarino said her organization would create a dedicated sales group for the app.\nApple News underwhelmed publishers and advertisers when it launched in 2015, and it certainly hasn’t gotten the focus that similar efforts, like Facebook’s Instant Articles or Google’s AMP program, have received.\nBut anecdotal reports indicate that the app, which comes pre-installed on Apple’s mobile devices, is getting more use now that Apple features it more prominently in its newest iOS 10 software.\nApple won’t comment on detailed usage numbers, but says the app now has 70 million unique users.\nThe sales deal is also a reminder that Apple, unlike most of its tech rivals, really doesn’t love the business of selling ads itself.\nApple had previously used its iAd app ad network to backfill unsold inventory for Apple News. But earlier this year Apple shut down iAd , which had never taken off.\nAnd in general, after a brief flirtation with the ad business, Apple has basically conceded that it makes sense for other people to do, but not for Apple. CEO Tim Cook has even used Apple’s lack of an ad business as a tool to criticize ad-based competitors like Google.\nBut Apple still isn’t ad-free. This fall it started selling search-based app advertising in its App Store. And if it gets more serious about breaking into the TV business, it will certainly have to grapple with ads there, since they fuel that industry.\n* NBCUniversal is a minority investor in Vox Media, which owns this site.\nrecode_divider",
