      "text": "Apple exploring glasses wearable with potential AR technology, report says   05:52 pm PT (08:52 pm ET) Adding to rumors that Apple will soon enter the augmented reality market, a report on Monday claims the company is working on a pair of \"digital glasses\" that overlays images and other useful information onto a user's field of vision. Citing sources familiar with the matter, Bloomberg reports Apple is experimenting with a pair of digital glasses that connect wirelessly to an iPhone or other host system to function, akin to the company's Apple Watch wearable. Apple is reportedly exploring its options with the project and no decision has been made as to whether the company will ultimately commit to a glasses style device. However, today's report notes small batch orders of near-eye displays from at least one supplier, suggesting the secret project has advanced to the prototyping phase. It is not clear whether Apple's secret glasses solution will integrate augmented reality features or will simply act as a wearable heads-up display. True AR systems overlay interactive digital information onto the physical world, sometimes with the help of cameras, sensors, transparent displays and complex algorithms. An HUD, on the other hand, is largely a secondary display for a host device. If Apple opts to move forward with mass production, a digital glasses device could see release by 2018 at the earliest, the report said. That timeline meshes with predictions from KGI analyst Ming-Chi Kuo who earlier this month estimated an Apple-branded augmented reality solution to debut within one to two years . Kuo anticipates Apple to test the waters with an iPhone-based AR system before marketing a standalone product. Apple is known to be working on augmented reality solutions, though exactly what form that product will take is unclear. CEO Tim Cook first mentioned Apple's interest in AR during a quarterly investors conference call in July , confirming investments in the space. He has since reiterated the stance on multiple occasions. Apple owns a number of AR/VR patents, the most recent being an AR mapping system for iPhone granted last week . The company is also building out a team of specialists through strategic hires and segment acquisitions, including motion capture specialist Faceshift , machine learning and computer vision startup Perceptio , German AR firm Metaio and former Google collaborator Flyby Media . Bolstering those claims are a multitude of AR patents, the latest covering device localization technology assigned to Apple from recent acquisition Flyby Media. Topics:",

      "text": "0 Customers gather at a store selling Apple products during the launch of the new iPhone 7 sales at the State Department Store, GUM, in central Moscow, Russia September 23, 2016. Reuters/Sergei Karpukhin \nA report has revealed that the Apple iPhone 8 could come with a never-seen-before wireless charging technology. It is believed that the 10th anniversary smartphone from Apple would come with a receiver inside. When the device needs to be charged, the receiver would connect to a transmitter plugged into wall socket. \nThe flagship from Apple is said to have a radical new design. As per latest reports, Apple is working with Energous to introduce the wireless-charging technology for iPhone 8. If rumours are to be believed, the iPhone owner has to be within 15 feet of the transmitter for successful charging, writes BGR . \nNeither Energous nor Apple has confirmed this for iPhone 8 though the very concept of wireless charging has been on the cards for some time. Samsung introduced dual wireless charging for its Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge devices. The circular pads charge the device without the need to connect the device to a cable. \nCharging pads and stands are available that can support up to three devices though the wireless charging devices available currently require connecting to a socket with a cable. The technology being developed by Apple with Energous for iPhone 8 is new and eliminates all use of cables. \nAs per The Indian Express , the Apple iPhone 8 could feature an OLED display and a glass back. The 2017 iPhone may not sport an aluminium back. A Nikkei report has also stated that Apple could release an additional screen size for iPhone 8. The 5-inch variant may have a 2.5D glass. \nOther reports have revealed that the Apple iPhone 8 will remove the physical Home button. A bezel-free curved design is also on the cards. The handset may also have an edgeless design. \nMoving towards a curved design seems like a strong possibility as talks have been there for quite some time now. An edgeless display in the Apple iPhone 8 is also more efficient as it offers quick access to various features. \nThe world is waiting for the iPhone 8 and the wait is worth it.",

      "text": "Apple Inc is considering expanding into wearable glass headsets and has talked about the project with potential suppliers, Bloomberg reported citing people familiar with the matter. The wearable headset would show images, along with other information and may use augmented reality, according to the report.\nChief Executive Tim Cook, who has been struggling with a slowdown in iPhone sales in recent quarters, said earlier this year that the company would continue to invest a lot into augmented reality.\nApple, the world’s largest technology company, has ordered a small number of near-eye displays for testing but has not obtained enough for production on a larger scale, the report added. Apple declined to comment. The move would make Apple the latest tech company to venture into wearable glasses.\nAlphabet Inc’s discontinued its own wearable glass headset, Google Glass, and closed the social media account linked to the device earlier this year, ending its attempt to popularize the expensive devices with consumers. The device received plenty of attention when it was launched in 2012, but quickly ran into problems with its awkward appearance and privacy concerns over video recording. Snap, an $18 billion company which makes the popular messaging app Snapchat, also launched its own video-camera sunglasses last week.\nReuters \nThe post Apple may get into wearable business with glass headsets appeared first on Tech2 .",

      "text": "Apple Inc.'s next hot product category may be...Google's failed Glass project from 2013. \nAnother forerunner Pokemon Go \nThe company is considering glasses that could combine digital information with what a person sees, my Bloomberg News colleagues reported late Monday. If the idea sounds familiar, it's because of the similarity to technology behind Pokemon Go, the hit smartphone game of 2016. It was also the aim of Google Glass, before the company now called Alphabet Inc. put that project on hold for reprogramming. \nApple's possible foray into a similar field isn't immediately inspiring. That's not to say the company needs to be first in digital glasses or augmented reality -- a catch-all term for technology that mixes real-world images with computerized information or digital images -- to be the best. Apple has a track record of taking not-entirely-original and niche ideas and transforming them into something grander. \nApple cribbed the idea for the Macintosh from unused research at Xerox. There were digital music players before the iPod. There were smartphones before the iPhone. Tablet computers preceded the iPad. In each case, however, Apple made technology that was better, easier to use -- even magical. That Apple magic turned fringe products into mainstream ones, and reshaped the trajectory of the technology industry. Changing Face IPods and Macs once dominated Apple revenue; now the iPhone provides 63 percent Source: Bloomberg \nThat was the Steve Jobs version of Apple. After more than five years with Tim Cook at the helm, we're still not sure if this Apple can make the leap from niche idea to world-changing technology. The first major product debut under Cook, the Apple Watch, hasn't yet become an obvious hit . (To be fair, no other companies have found major success with wearable computers.) \nMore ominously for Apple, it's no longer the technology trendsetter. Yes, Apple has brought us better smartphone cameras and fingerprint sensors, but there are more areas where it has whiffed. Cook has been saying for five years that the TV industry is broken and needs an overhaul. He was right. Now the way people watch television is being upended by Netflix Inc., by \"cord cutting\" and by video on smartphones. Apple is barely a participant in that transformation. \nApple is developing technology that could some day become the operating system for driverless cars , but it's not obvious that the company has a clearer vision than Google, Baidu Inc., Uber Technologies Inc., Tesla Motors Inc. or other companies that are further ahead on autonomous driving. Apple bought Siri more than six years ago to bring voice-activated digital helpers to smartphones. Since then, Amazon.com Inc., Google and Microsoft Corp. have surged ahead. \nApple may never make digital glasses, and if it does, it won't happen before 2018. But the technology will progress anyway. Augmented reality is what Microsoft is doing with its HoloLens headset, and that product exists. So does Pokemon Go. The parent company of Snapchat created a specialized camera built into glasses that lets people record snippets of video from what they see. \nSnap Inc.'s Spectacles are no doubt less ambitious than any Apple plan for wearable computers on the face, but the point is that companies other than Apple are illuminating the path for the rest of the industry. Cranking Up R&D Apple's research and development activity cost 4.7 percent of revenue in the most recent fiscal year, the highest level since 2004 Source: Bloomberg Note: Apple's fiscal year ends each September. \nCook has said that the doubling of Apple's research-and-development spending in the past three years was in part devoted to cooking up Apple's next big product. It certainly could use a dose of inspiration. The company just closed its first fiscal year of declining revenue since 2001 . Its major products -- the iPhone, iPad and Mac computers -- may never return to the growth they once had. \nWe might look back at 2016 as a lull before a storm of ground-breaking product categories. More likely, though, Apple's days as technology's unrivaled innovation factory are over. \nGadfly's Tim Culpan contributed to this column. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners. \nThe Apple TV streaming video device is interesting but hardly a trendsetter. Apple a few years ago abandoned a television set it had been developing. \nTo contact the author of this story: Shira Ovide in New York at \nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Paul Sillitoe at Banking On Banks Banking On Banks Indian lenders have outshone the benchmark this year; the recent cash ban may extend the rally Source: Bloomberg",

      "text": "0 A customer tries on a new iPhone 7 Plus in Australian's flagship Apple store in Sydney, September 16, 2016 as the iPhone 7 range goes on sale for the first time. Reuters/Jason Reed \nThe iPhone 7 Plus is Apple’s highest-end offering in the current market. While the device looks largely like its predecessor, the iPhone 6S Plus, the Cupertino-based company did make meaningful changes as well. \nREAD: Apple iPhone 8 release date, news & update: Both iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus to become larger and have no bezel \nApple’s dual lens camera debuted in the iPhone 7 Plus, and the technology definitely shows. The photo-quality is notably better than any of its predecessors especially when taking low-light images. The new camera system also allows users to zoom in to images twice as much, which is more significant in terms of quality rather than actual distance. \nThe iPhone 7 Plus also improves from its predecessors in terms of battery life. In addition, the new A10 processor from Apple and the 3GB of RAM allow it to work quicker than the iPhone 6S Plus. The Cupertino-based company also made improvements to the home button, which provides better feedback, is more responsive and is generally easier to use in the current Apple flagship. \nWater resistancy was also included into the iPhone 7 Plus, which has an IP67 rating. This technically means that the device can be submerged only until a meter of water for a maximum of 30 minutes. It has been speculated that the infamously missing 3.5mm audio jack is a reason for this new feature. \nREAD: Apple iPhone 8: Why Samsung will benefit from the future iPhone \nFor individuals with Optus, C|Net previously reported that the best deal is to purchase the 128GB model, which requires $107 per month. In the span of two years, the entire payout is $2,568. Then there is Vodafone’s deal for the same variant at $113 per month, which will equate to $2,712 at the end of 24 months. On the other hand, Telstra offers the same model at $122 per month, which will set the user back by $2,928 at the end of the contract.",

REUTERS/Thomas Peter Apple Inc is considering expanding into wearable glass headsets and has talked about the project with potential suppliers, Bloomberg reported citing people familiar with the matter. The wearable headset would show images, along with other information and may use augmented reality, according to the report. Chief Executive Tim Cook, who has been struggling with a slowdown in iPhone sales in recent quarters, said earlier this year that the company would continue to invest a lot into augmented reality. Apple, the world's largest technology company, has ordered a small number of near-eye displays for testing but has not obtained enough for production on a larger scale, the report added. Apple declined to comment. The move would make Apple the latest tech company to venture into wearable glasses. Alphabet Inc's discontinued its own wearable glass headset, Google Glass, and closed the social media account linked to the device earlier this year, ending its attempt to popularize the expensive devices with consumers. The device received plenty of attention when it was launched in 2012, but quickly ran into problems with its awkward appearance and privacy concerns over video recording. Snap, an $18 billion company which makes the popular messaging app Snapchat, also launched its own video-camera sunglasses last week.

      "text": "iPhone 8 Wireless Charging Tests Are Underway \nThe response to Apple’s iPhone 7 has been tepid. Any other smartphone maker would be thrilled to sell as many phones, but Apple has not seen the same enthusiasm for this device that it has in the past. Next year will be a defining moment for Apple and the iPhone; it’s the tenth anniversary of the device. What does Apple have in store to mark a decade of iPhones? A really big one , apparently. \nThe current rumor is that Apple could be looking at a larger 5.8-inch OLED panel for the iPhone 8 (presumably a Plus model). The current iPhone 7 Plus has a 5.5-inch 1080p LCD. As far as LCDs go, Apple has always chosen very nice ones. However, OLED technology has come a long way in recent years and is really undeniably better. The colors, black levels, and response time are noticeably better than LCD. \nAs for the size, 5.8-inches sounds like a big phone. Although, it’s worth noting that the current iPhone 7 Plus has rather large bezels. A phone like the Galaxy S7 Edge has extremely small bezels compared to the iPhone. Apple is rumored to be toying with “bezel-less” designs, which could deliver a larger display in the same footprint as the current iPhone 7 Plus. A display of that size is still going to be somewhat uncomfortable to use, so it’s all going to come down to ergonomics and palm rejection (the ability of the display to ignore accidental touches). Reports also suggest that Apple could be looking at using a curved OLED panel, a design pioneered by Samsung. \nWhatever Apple is up to, we’ll find out in fall 2017. Although, with the way recent Apple devices have been leaking, you might not have to wait that long to get a good idea. Share",

      "title": "MacBook Pro with Touch Bar review roundup: This gimmick isn’t for everyone",
      "text": "At the beginning of the month, we rounded up reviews for Apple's 13-inch, Touch Bar-less MacBook Pro . Despite its hefty price and lack of the most intriguing new feature, the reaction was overwhelmingly positive, with most outlets claiming that the MacBook Pro with function keys would be a solid upgrade for anyone that needed to move on from an aging machine. The consensus isn't quite as clear when it comes to the Touch Bar models.\n\nMUST SEE:  Titanfall 2 review: Iron giants \nBelow, we've cobbled together some highlights from 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar reviews from around the internet:\nThe Wall Street Journal The Wall Street Journal's Joanna Stern is as critical as anyone of the new MBP. While she prefers the design and the display of the latest model, the additions aren't nearly enough for her to recommend this model over last year's:\n\n\"So how do you decide? Do you invest in the present—the “old” MacBook Pro with performance, good-enough portability, a keyboard to cherish and lots of ports? Or do you invest in the future—a beautiful, highly portable machine with new tricks? Or maybe you do what I’m doing: Stare down at your three-year-old laptop and wonder if you can tough it out another year or two while this sorts itself out.\"\nRead the full review .\nThe Verge Having already covered the computer itself fairly comprehensively earlier this month, The Verge dedicated most of its review to discussing the Touch Bar:\n\n\"The good news is that the Touch Bar’s interface is all software. It can be updated and refined and improved. I suspect it’ll take a little while before Apple and third-party developers find the best use for each of their specific apps, but I hope they’ll learn quickly that there’s a fine line between presenting helpful options and overwhelming their users. Apple and developers will also have to decide who the Touch Bar is for: pros or amateurs. Many of us are already familiar with keyboard shortcuts in the apps we’re using, and so far I’ve found that forcing myself to use the Touch Bar tends to slow me down.\"\nRead the full review .\nEngadget Much like the WSJ , Engadget is disappointed in the trade-offs a user has to make when deciding whether or not to upgrade to the latest MacBook Pro model:\n\n\"I'm one of many Mac owners out there who has been waiting for Apple to upgrade the MacBook Pro line. Now that it finally has, I find the new laptop isn't quite what I wanted. For me, the ideal MacBook Pro is actually a mashup between this and last year's model. Let me keep my full-size USB ports, and my function keys, and my longer battery life, but stick with this thinner and lighter design. Stick with this improved display, Touch ID sensor, fast disk performance and more robust audio quality. For me, this is both a step forward and a step backward.\"\nRead the full review .\nSlashGear Although many MacBook Pro users have been waiting years for a significant upgrade to the lineup, SlashGear  feels like it still might be worth waiting another year for the MBP that will improve on everything Apple introduced in 2016:\n\n\"I can’t help but imagine a 2017 MacBook Pro with Kaby Lake processors and several months of developers getting to grips with the potential of Touch ID and the Touch Bar. As it stands today, though, the dongle frustration and the fact that you really need to pay $1799 or more – the entry-level 13-inch misses out too much, in my opinion, to be worth considering – are outweighed by the improvements in graphics, the excellent build quality, and the promise its unique hardware coupled with macOS represents.\"\nRead the full review .\nCNNMoney CNNMoney also has plenty of praise to shower on the Touch Bar-equipped MacBook Pro, but as with virtually every other review, has some reservations as well:\n\n\"Overall, the latest version of the MacBook Pro is all about the Touch Bar. Is the novel concept reason enough to purchase the new MacBook Pro? No. But it's a sweet bonus to arguably the best performing laptop on the market.\nIf you're debating whether the extra $300 for the Touch Bar and TouchID is worth it, it depends what kind of user you are. Sure, both features are handy, but they're more of a bonus than a necessity. The pricier model will also give you a faster processor and two more Thunderbolt ports (a plus if you need to connect to more displays).\nThen again, if these qualifications aren't appealing and you're not doing a ton of intensive work, such as video or photo editing, you're probably better off with a cheaper MacBook Air.\"\nRead the full review .\nTrending right now: \nBest Buy and Target have iPhone 7 Black Friday deals you shouldn’t miss Watch Dave Chappelle’s hilarious SNL opening monologue tackle all things Trump Watch a Tesla Model S P100D race against a $265,000 McLaren 650S Spider See the original version of this article on BGR.com",

      "text": "Apple's StoryTime for tvOS Brings Kids' Books to the Television By: Joey Haar - Nov 14, 2016 References: itunes.apple & thenextweb As a medium, children's stories aren't going anywhere, but Apple's new app, StoryTime for tvOS, modernizes stories for today's connected kids. The app, which works in conjunction with AppleTV, plays recordings of various classic children's stories and shows images of the pictures from those same books. StoryTime for tvOS uses a new feature on Apple's iBooks called 'Read-Aloud.' While all the books' narrations are read by actual humans (to reduce the uncanny effect of robotic voices,) Read-Aloud couples the books with subtitles running at the bottom of the screen. The hope is that StoryTime will not only provide a soothing way for parents and kids to read their favorite stories, but it will also help kids to learn to read thanks to the clear fonts.",

      "text": "Apple stock extends losses after China warning about Trump Updated: November 14, 2016 — 4:08 PM EST Share Reuters \nBy Noel Randewich \nSAN FRANCISCO, Nov 14 (Reuters) - Apple's stock extended recent losses on Monday after a warning that iPhone sales could suffer if President-elect Donald Trump follows through on campaign threats to impose new tariffs on China. \nApple is among several major technology stocks, including Amazon.com, Facebook and Alphabet, selling off since Tuesday's election as investors shift funds into financial and public works companies seen benefitting from deregulation and infrastructure spending under President-elect Trump. \nIn a continuation of that trend, the Cupertino, California company's stock fell 2.5 percent on Monday, bringing its loss since Tuesday's election to almost 5 percent, compared to the S&P 500's 1.16 percent advance. \nAdding to concern for Apple investors, an op-ed published in the China government-backed Global Times on Sunday warned of \"tit-for-tat\" retaliation should Trump follow through on a campaign pledge to impose 45-percent tariffs on all imports from China. \n\"A batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus. US auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and US soybean and maize imports will be halted,\" the op-ed said. \nChina has already become a disappointment for Apple, failing to deliver rapid growth that the company hoped would make up for slower iPhone sales in the United States and other mature markets. \nRevenue from China slumped 30 percent in Apple's September quarter, worse than the Americas' 7 percent decline. \nApple's China sales could be hurt by potential trade conflicts as well as the country's weakening currency, said Rosenblatt Securities analyst Jun Zhang by email. He said he believes China iPhone sales fell in October, even after fixing supply issues affecting the iPhone 7 Plus. \nSynovus Trust Company Senior Portfolio Manager Daniel Morgan, who owns $33 million worth of Apple shares, warned not to read too much into Trump's campaign trail threats against China, at least in the near term. \n\"You just don't just jump in and start rewriting trade agreements,\" Morgan said. \n(Reporting by Noel Randewich; Editing by Tom Brown) More Coverage ",

      "text": "Apple Pay expands to charities, Samsung Pay to offer rewards Updated: November 14, 2016 — 2:15 PM EST Share Close icon The Associated Press \nNEW YORK (AP) - Apple is making it easier for people to give to charities by expanding its Apple Pay payments service to nonprofits. \nApple Pay is mostly known for enabling purchases at retail stores with the tap of an iPhone, although the service can also be used for online transactions on apps and websites. Apple had limited this to buying goods and services - until now. \nThe American Red Cross, United Way and 18 other nonprofits will accept Apple Pay starting Monday. Others are coming soon. \nApple Pay can speed transactions because people don't have to re-enter card and contact information, though people need to enable the service first. Apple says that websites and apps accepting Apple Pay report seeing twice as many people complete transactions, compared with other payment methods. \nSeparately, Samsung says a payment service on its phones, Samsung Pay, will start offering points for each transaction, regardless of the amount spent. They will be redeemable for gift cards and Samsung products. \nAmericans are just starting to warm up to mobile payment services such as Apple Pay and Samsung Pay. One of the chief hurdles is the fact that for in-store transactions, it's not that difficult to pull out a plastic card to pay. And many merchants still do not accept such mobile payments. Although usage is growing, mobile payments are still a small portion of overall sales. Published: ",

Alphabet Inc's discontinued its own wearable glass headset, Google Glass , and closed the social media account linked to the device earlier this year, ending its attempt to popularize the expensive devices with consumers. \nThe device received plenty of attention when it was launched in 2012, but quickly ran into problems with its awkward appearance and privacy concerns over video recording. \nSnap, an $18 billion company which makes the popular messaging app Snapchat , also launched its own video-camera sunglasses last week.",

      "text": "Not just expensive toys | Bangkok Post: tech Top sections \nApple MacBook Pro late 2016. Photo courtesy of Apple - + In the days following the announcement of the latest MacBook Pro computers, reports followed the usual pattern. The MacBook Pro misses the boat; Apple is doomed; Tim Cook should be replaced; and there were the usual questions about \"what would Steve Jobs have done/said/thought?\". An Apple product is like an iceberg: only a small part is visible above the surface; most is hidden. \nSome questioned the 16GB maximum memory in these Macs. When asked why 32GB was not an option, Phil Schiller said that this was because it \"wouldn't be power-efficient enough for a notebook\". Many thought this was another example of Schiller-speak, until IT journalists did some research. When Intel releases suitable Kaby Lake processors, things will be different. \nAlthough processor speeds have not changed much, components work faster: bus speeds are improved and sequential read speeds for the solid state drives' read/write speeds are 3.1 and 2.1GB per second. \nMany commented on the provision of USB-C ports only (plus the headphone connector), which means those with older devices will need new adapters or cables. Apple eased the pain a little at the end of last week by reducing prices in the USA of several adapters. There is no information about whether these lower prices will hold here. There are also reports that some older Thunderbolt 3 adapters with Texas Instruments controller chips do not work. Commentators expect this will be fixed with a firmware update. \nApart from the higher prices (I will be mortgaged into the next century by the 13-inch model I want), a surprise for me was the lack of a start-up chime. As these new Macs have instant-on capabilities, this was silenced in case anyone starts the Mac up in a meeting, although I have heard plenty of Macs and PCs being booted up here and no one seems to care. Fortunately, the reliable Christian Zibreg (iDownload Blog) outlined the process to bring the chime back using Terminal. This will be one of my first acts after configuration, when I am able to buy one. \nIf anyone in Thailand wants one of these new computers now, the Buy buttons on the Apple site are still greyed out. Orders in the USA are showing wait times of four or five weeks. I am sort of hoping for a late November release here, but I am not a betting man. \nI am learning more about the Apple Watch Series 2 that I am running, not the least is how to take screen shots. I now hold the watch's side button and immediately press the crown. The iPhone 7 also needs some dexterity with a press to the side (screen off) button, followed by a touch on the Home button. If you press the Home button first, Siri offers to help. \nI am pleased with the improved battery life of the Watch. With the first version I would expect to see around 50-55% of life at the end of the day; but the Series 2 is rarely below 75%. I am the wrong person to ask about battery life as my iPhone is in constant use all day, especially with messaging: as before, the Apple Watch takes some of the slack there when I am travelling (bus, taxi, BTS) allowing me to filter out less important messages, or reply sometimes with an emoji. \nThere are now more apps that run on the Watch, like my Withings app that displays several health monitoring data items. Information is taken from Apple's Health app and from devices such as the blood pressure measurement unit I use. \nI have also added a new maths app, 6284 Calc, by Amit Kalra (@AMITNKALRA), a 16-year-old student from San Francisco who fell behind in class. He built the app to help him, which I think is a greater achievement than unsuitable classroom learning. This is still being developed and it is expected more features will be added. \nAnother neat app is Night Sky 4, which shows stars in the sky from whichever direction the watch is pointed. Remember there are some below the horizon: these are shown too. The display on the iPhone is much clearer of course, but on the watch I can see quickly which stars (and constellations) I am looking at. \nHeart rate, music, phone and calendar are among the apps I have added to the Dock, giving me quick access to these services. I also have Maps directions on the Dock, which can be automatically opened on the iPhone for a better view when I want it. A quick glance at the watch is often enough to help me navigate the streets without constantly looking at the iPhone. Graham K. Rogers of Mahidol University's Engineering Faculty, has OS-X flavoured web pages at www.extensions.in.th/index4.html and he can be followed on Twitter (@extensions_th). \nApple Watch Screen shot - quick access control screen.

      "text": "Apple’s stock extended recent losses on Monday after a warning that iPhone sales could suffer if President-elect Donald Trump follows through on campaign threats to impose new tariffs on China.\nApple is among several major technology stocks, including Amazon.com, Facebook and Alphabet, selling off since Tuesday’s election as investors shift funds into financial and public works companies seen benefiting from deregulation and infrastructure spending under President-elect Trump.\nIn a continuation of that trend, the Cupertino, California company’s stock fell 2.5 percent on Monday, bringing its loss since Tuesday’s election to almost 5 percent, compared to the S&P 500’s .SPX 1.16 percent advance.\nAdding to concern for Apple investors, an op-ed published in the China government-backed Global Times on Sunday warned of “tit-for-tat” retaliation should Trump follow through on a campaign pledge to impose 45-percent tariffs on all imports from China. “A batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus. US auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and US soybean and maize imports will be halted,” the op-ed said. China has already become a disappointment for Apple, failing to deliver rapid growth that the company hoped would make up for slower iPhone sales in the United States and other mature markets.\nRevenue from China slumped 30 percent in Apple’s September quarter, worse than the Americas’ 7 percent decline. Apple’s China sales could be hurt by potential trade conflicts as well as the country’s weakening currency, said Rosenblatt Securities analyst Jun Zhang by email. He said he believes China iPhone sales fell in October, even after fixing supply issues affecting the iPhone 7 Plus.\nSynovus Trust Company Senior Portfolio Manager Daniel Morgan, who owns $33 million worth of Apple shares, warned not to read too much into Trump’s campaign trail threats against China, at least in the near term. “You just don’t just jump in and start rewriting trade agreements,” Morgan said.\nReuters \nThe post Apple continues to register loss after China warns about iPhone sales if Trump imposes new taxes appeared first on Tech2 .",

      "text": "Apple Reportedly Considers Expansion Into Digital Glasses November 14, 2016, 08:06:  Apple Inc. ( AAPL ) is considering an expansion into digital glasses, a risky but potentially lucrative area of wearable computing, Bloomberg reported citing people familiar with the matter. \nWhile still in an exploration phase, the device would connect wirelessly to iPhones, show images and other information in the wearer's field of vision, and may use augmented reality, the report said. \nThe report indicated that Apple has talked about its glasses project with potential suppliers. The company has ordered small quantities of near-eye displays from one supplier for testing. \nPreviously, Google's attempt to develop internet-connected eye wear flopped in part because its tiny battery ran out quickly. Google Glass, as it was called, also suffered a privacy backlash and poor public perception of its external design. \nFor comments and feedback: contact",

      "text": "Jim Cramer's 'Mad Money' Recap: Trump Trade War Could Hit U.S. Car, Apple iPhone Sales We're beginning to see the grimmer side of the 'Trump Rally,' says Jim Cramer. Nov14,20168:28PMEST \nSearch Jim Cramer's \"Mad Money\" trading recommendations using our exclusive \"Mad Money\" Stock Screener . \nIf Trump sticks with his promises, we'll find ourselves in a brave new world, Jim Cramer told his Mad Money viewers Monday, as saber-rattling out of China warned investors that a trade war is not a good thing. \nCramer said it's easy to predict some of the winners with a Trump presidency. \nTrump favors cutting taxes, building infrastructure, boosting defense and getting tough on trade. \nThat's good news for retail and leisure, the materials stocks and, of course, Lockheed Martin ( LMT ) and Northrop Grumman ( NOC ) . But it's the last item -- getting tough on trade -- that cuts both ways. \nToday, news out of China warned that a trade war could see Boeing ( BA ) orders replaced with Airbus, and sales of everything from cars to iPhones getting crimped. That news sent shares of Apple ( AAPL ) , an Action Alerts PLUS holding, down 2.5%, and General Motors ( GM ) down 2%. \nBoeing and Apple may be only just the beginning, Cramer said; many U.S. companies need overseas markets to thrive. With these new risks, the markets become less clear, he concluded, and that takes us into uncharted territory. \nJim Cramer and Jack Mohr are trimming their Panera ( PNRA ) position on strength. Read why and what they're telling their members with a free trial membership to the Action Alerts PLUS investment club . \nExecutive Decision: Harman \nFor his \"Executive Decision\" segment, Cramer sat down with Dinesh Paliwal, chairman and CEO of Harman International ( HAR ) , the auto infotainment maker that today announced it is being acquired by Samsung ( SSNLF ) for $112 a share -- a 25% premium from where shares opened for trading. \nPaliwal said that the technological transformation in cars continues and in today's market, scale matters. When Harman began talking to Samsung, he said, there were so many complementary technologies being developed, from 5G connectivity and high-resolution displays to speech recognition, and there was hardly any overlap. \nUnder the terms of the deal, Harman will retain its headquarters and its management team, acting as a subsidiary of Samsung. This gives Harman deep research and development resources, Paliwal added. \nHarman is not standing still, as the company has doubled down on cyber security, acquiring another company to help keep its products secure. Cyber attacks can happen to your home, your car or your devices, he said, and Harman takes the challenge seriously. \nCramer's bottom line, \"Paliwal saw a lot of things coming and got a lot of things right.\" \nMore from tonight's show recap: \"Executive Decision\" guests include Udi Mokady, CEO of Cyberark ( CYBR ) . Plus, Cramer diagnoses the problems with CVS Health Corp ( CVS ) . Prev 0 of 3 Next If you liked this article you might like",

      "text": "TOMS launches Apple Watch straps featuring woven fabric, leather By Monday, November 14, 2016, 07:54 pm PT (10:54 pm ET) Shoe and accessories boutique TOMS on Monday announced a new line of Apple Watch straps featuring woven fabric and leather accents, with each purchase providing one year of solar light to people in need. Exclusive to TOMS online and physical retail outlets, the new TOMS for Apple Watch straps are split into two series, the $49 Utility Collection and a more expensive $75 leather-clad Artisan Collection. Utility Collection pieces feature grosgrain fabric similar in appearance to Apple's own woven nylon straps, but incorporate leather detailing around a metal buckle and free loop. Designs are limited to solid colors —black and olive for 42mm models, and dusty pink and clay for 38mm Watches —and a light blue band with a white stripe for both Apple Watch sizes. For the Artisan Collection, TOMS incorporates a woven fabric top attached to a full-length leather backing. A single diamond design is available for all four straps, with white-on-black and white-on-red colorways available for 42mm versions, and white-on-black and white-on-royal blue for 38mm models. Buckle and loop hardware sport a silver finish. Each Apple Watch strap sale benefits TOMS' Give Time initiative, a program that partners with SolarAid and Solar Sister to provide solar light access to regions of Africa. To commemorate the partial donation, \"GIVE TIME\" is etched on every TOMS Apple Watch strap buckle. Topics:",

      "text": "Post by Apple in Wonderland on Nov 14, 2016 23:30:36 GMT -5 What are some of your present \"hits\"?If someone says they want something, and it is reasonable, I get it, whether or not it seems \"special\" to me. Just found out recently that a present I bought my brother, 20ish years ago, at his request, when I was a teenager is still one of his favorite things. A broiler pan. He now uses it to roast coffee, and says it's perfect (he also pointed out that he got it from me). When he requested it I just went with it, and I'm now glad I did!For my son, it has been tickets to go see a Broadway musical (on tour). Also, salted licorice (popular in Finland).My teenage niece has asked for duck meat from my sister (her husband hunts ducks). Very simple, but it would make her happy.",

      "text": "By Tiernan Ray Drexel Hamilton ’s Brian White today pounds the table for shares of Apple ( AAPL ), and his Buy rating and $185 price target, declaring it’s a “buying opportunity” in the stock on worries President-elect Donald Trump will impose a 45% tariff on goods from China.\nApple shares today are down $2.98, or almost 3%, at $105.45. The stock is down 5% since Tuesday’s close, before Trump’s upset victory was declared.\nCiting an article this morning in the China paper Global Times , which mentioned the iPhone as one of the goods imported to the U.S. that could be caught up in any Trump tariff act, White views it all as “saber rattling” and argues the rhetoric is unrealistic because Apple can’t really make an iPhone in the U.S.:\nManufacturing the iPhone in volume in the U.S. is unrealistic as many consumers would no longer be able to afford to buy an iPhone due to higher manufacturing costs. This would not just disrupt iPhone sales but also all of the industries/companies that have developed around the mobile Internet over the years. Even if the assembly of an iPhone occurred in the U.S., many of the components necessary to manufacture an iPhone are produced in China or elsewhere in Asia, thus shipment into the U.S. would prove costly. Moreover, we believe finding the workers with the willingness and skill set to assemble an iPhone in the U.S. at the volume levels required by Apple would be an insurmountable task. In China, workers generally are young, live in a dorm on the manufacturing campus and work very long hours. Most workers spend a few years on an assembly line and save money before retiring back to their hometown.\nWhite argues Apple could make a gesture in return for an overseas tax holiday :\nThe U.S. government could tie a lower tax rate on the repatriation of overseas cash (Apple has $237.6 billion in cash and 91% overseas) with investments in the U.S. In 2014, Apple proactively began manufacturing the Mac Pro in Austin, Texas (through an EMS provider) with a commitment through 2021; however, this is a low volume product, thus the impact on Apple was negligible. With the proper incentive, Apple could make a symbolic gesture and manufacture select, low volume programs in the U.S.",

      "text": "Markets Today Samsung's Deal for Harman Shows Some of the Limitations of Apple's Approach Apple owes much of its success to its no-compromise approach to hardware. But this approach can be a problem in markets such as infotainment systems and set-tops. Eric Jhonsa Nov14,20165:03PMEST \nSamsung's $8 billion deal to buy infotainment and audio hardware giant Harman ( HAR ) might not be disastrous for Apple's ( AAPL ) automotive efforts, given Harman's business model. But it does arguably show how Apple's hardware philosophy can be a problem. \nThe acquisition features a 28% premium to Harman's Friday close, but still only involves a moderate valuation of 15 times Harman's expected 2017 earnings. It gives Samsung a company that supplies infotainment systems to automakers such as Audi, Toyota, Jeep, Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Chrysler, as well as popular audio products for homes and cars under brands such as JBL, Bang & Olufsen (automotive only) and Harman Kardon. Parts of the latter business complement Samsung's TV business. \nHarman claims that 30 million cars feature its technology, and that its automotive backlog stands at $24 billion. In addition to its core car and audio businesses, the company provides custom audio and lighting solutions to enterprise and entertainment clients, and IoT and analytics solutions for a variety of customers. \nHarman lowers the dependence of Samsung's consumer electronics business on a smartphone business that has had some issues lately, and for which slowing industry growth and tougher competition from Google are going to be long-term problems. \nIt makes the company a top player in a connected car market seeing healthy if unspectacular growth as consumer interest in advanced entertainment, navigation and connectivity features grows, and also in an audio hardware market where Harman has been taking share.

Photo: Reuters/Mike Segar/File Photo Reuters, San Francisco \nApple's (AAPL.O) stock extended recent losses on Monday after a warning that iPhone sales could suffer if President-elect Donald Trump follows through on campaign threats to impose new tariffs on China. \nApple is among several major technology stocks, including Amazon.com (AMZN.O), Facebook (FB.O) and Alphabet (GOOGL.O), selling off since Tuesday's election as investors shift funds into financial and public works companies seen benefiting from deregulation and infrastructure spending under President-elect Trump. \nIn a continuation of that trend, the Cupertino, California company's stock fell 2.5 percent on Monday, bringing its loss since Tuesday's election to almost 5 percent, compared to the S&P 500's .SPX 1.16 percent advance. \nAdding to concern for Apple investors, an op-ed published in the China government-backed Global Times on Sunday warned of \"tit-for-tat\" retaliation should Trump follow through on a campaign pledge to impose 45-percent tariffs on all imports from China. \n\"A batch of Boeing (BA.N) orders will be replaced by Airbus. US auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and US soybean and maize imports will be halted,\" the op-ed said. \nChina has already become a disappointment for Apple, failing to deliver rapid growth that the company hoped would make up for slower iPhone sales in the United States and other mature markets. \nRevenue from China slumped 30 percent in Apple's September quarter, worse than the Americas' 7 percent decline. \nApple's China sales could be hurt by potential trade conflicts as well as the country's weakening currency, said Rosenblatt Securities analyst Jun Zhang by email. He said he believes China iPhone sales fell in October, even after fixing supply issues affecting the iPhone 7 Plus. \nSynovus Trust Company Senior Portfolio Manager Daniel Morgan, who owns $33 million worth of Apple shares, warned not to read too much into Trump's campaign trail threats against China, at least in the near term.

      "text": "Pinterest \nIt looks like Apple is exploring on the idea of digital glasses similar to Google Glass. According to reports, the Cupertino company is working on augmented reality glasses that could launch as early as 2018. \nAccording to Bloomberg, the device would connect wirelessly to iPhones, and will display images and other information right on the glasses itself, and may use augmented reality too. Citing anonymous sources, Bloomberg says that Apple has ordered small quantities of near-eye displays from a supplier for testing. Google Glass \nIt’s not a surprise that Apple is interested in augmented reality. Over the past few years, Apple has been acquiring various companies that focuses on AR software, 3D mapping and computer vision like PrimeSense , Metaio and Flyby; just two months ago, Apple even hired AR and VR experts. Even Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple, has expressed interest in the technology. “AR can be really great, and we have been and continue to invest a lot in this. We are high on AR for the long run. We think there are great things for customers and great commercial opportunity.” – Tim Cook said in a conference call with analysts back in July. \nDon’t expect to see any products anytime soon though, there are still a lot of things to consider like trying to fit everything into a pair of slim glasses that doesn’t look too dorky.",

By: Reuters | Updated: November 15, 2016 10:45 AM Apple Inc is considering expanding into wearable glass headsets and has talked about the project with potential suppliers, Bloomberg reported citing people familiar with the matter. (Reuters) \nApple Inc is considering expanding into wearable glass headsets and has talked about the project with potential suppliers, Bloomberg reported citing people familiar with the matter. \nThe wearable headset would show images, along with other information and may use augmented reality, according to the report. \nChief Executive Tim Cook, who has been struggling with a slowdown in iPhone sales in recent quarters, said earlier this year that the company would continue to invest a lot into augmented reality. \nApple, the world’s largest technology company, has ordered a small number of near-eye displays for testing but has not obtained enough for production on a larger scale, the report added. \nApple declined to comment. \nThe move would make Apple the latest tech company to venture into wearable glasses. \nAlphabet Inc’s discontinued its own wearable glass headset, Google Glass, and closed the social media account linked to the device earlier this year, ending its attempt to popularize the expensive devices with consumers. \nThe device received plenty of attention when it was launched in 2012, but quickly ran into problems with its awkward appearance and privacy concerns over video recording. \nSnap, an $18 billion company which makes the popular messaging app Snapchat, also launched its own video-camera sunglasses last week.

      "text": "In a bid to help charity organisations get seamless donations, Apple Pay has made it easier and secure to donate to non-profit organisations with just a touch. Apple Pay support for charitable donations kicked off on Tuesday with nonprofits ranging from global organisations such as Unicef and WWF. “We’re making it incredibly easy to give back with Apple Pay,” said Apple Pay’s Vice President Jennifer Bailey.\n“We think offering such a simple and secure way to support the incredible work nonprofits will have a significant impact on the communities they serve,” Bailey added. More nonprofits will offer Apple Pay over the coming months so their supporters can make easy, secure and private payments, the Cupertino-based company said in a statement. “We are thrilled that more people will help WWF tackle urgent conservation issues this holiday season and beyond with their donations via Apple Pay,” said Senior Vice President Terry Macko of Marketing and Communications, WWF.\nDavid Miliband, President and CEO, International Rescue Committee, said: “Apple Pay gives supporters an easier way to help achieve our mission of helping the world’s most vulnerable people.” In the few seconds it takes to use Apple Pay to donate, you can help save a child from hunger and disease or give them clean water to drink, added Caryl M. Stern, CEO and president, the US Fund for Unicef.\nIANS \nThe post Apple pay makes it easy to donate to nonprofits appeared first on Tech2 .",

Credit: HP Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry IDG News Service | Nov 14, 2016 9:05 PM PT RELATED TOPICS Comments \nHP has been hoping that sleek, powerful hardware will lure Apple Mac aficionados to switch to its PCs, and now is aiming the new Z2 Mini mini-desktop at Mac Mini users. \nThe Z2 Mini packs the computing power of a full-size desktop into a box that can be held in one hand. Starting at $699, it will be available worldwide starting in December. \nHP has been excelling in PC design, with innovative desktops like Pavilion Wave , a cylindrical desktop, and Elite Slice , a modular mini-desktop onto which components can be snapped. \n[ Download the State of the CIO 2016 report ] \nThe 2.4-kilogram Z2 Mini can cram an Intel server CPU and discrete Nvidia GPU -- both of which have their own cooling fans -- into a tiny space while delivering screaming performance. \nThe Z2 Mini could be an alternative for those looking to replace the aging Mac Mini, which hasn't received a design or hardware upgrade for years now. \nApple has been abandoning the professional market and for engineers and designers, the Z2 Mini is superior to the Mac Mini, said Jeff Wood, vice president of HP's workstation business, during a briefing. \nThe idea that Apple is stepping away from the professional market was highlighted during the recent release of the MacBook Pro , which has innovative features like the Touch Bar. But it attracted criticism for using old Intel Skylake chips, and was widely considered more of a consumer than a business PC. \nApple also hasn't upgraded its Mac Pro desktop since 2013, and workstations with Windows are filling that void. The new Windows workstations have superior processors, GPUs, memory and SSD storage. \nThe Z2 Mini is targeted at engineers and architects using applications like Autodesk or Solidworks. However, it isn't meant for use with VR headsets like Oculus Rift or HTC Vive, an HP spokesperson said. Nvidia's Quadro M620 GPU isn't designed for VR, and headsets typically need full-powered desktops like the Z840 with cutting-edge GPUs. \nThe Z2 mini-desktop can be configured with Intel's Xeon E3-1200v5 CPU, or Core chips. It supports up to 32GB of memory and up to 1.5TB of storage. \nAn entry-level model will have three DisplayPort ports, two USB 3.0 ports and an Ethernet port. A fully loaded model will have two additional USB Type-C ports. \nBut some features are missing. It doesn't have an HDMI port to attach displays, or a Thunderbolt 3 slot to attach high-speed storage. Workstation users dealing with high-end graphics need more than 1.5TB of storage, and the USB 3.0 port, with its data transfer speed of 10Gbps (bits per second), may not be enough. Storage devices attached to a Thunderbolt 3 port -- which transfers data at 40Gbps -- can be used in real time, much like internal storage. \nThe Z2 can be mounted behind a monitor so it remains hidden.

      "text": "Apple Pay expands to charities, Samsung Pay to offer rewards Associated Press Monday, November 14, 2016 comments NEW YORK — Apple is making it easier for people to give to charities by expanding its Apple Pay payments service to nonprofits.\nApple Pay is mostly known for enabling purchases at retail stores with the tap of an iPhone, although the service can also be used for online transactions on apps and websites. Apple had limited this to buying goods and services — until now.\nThe American Red Cross, United Way and 18 other nonprofits will accept Apple Pay starting Monday. Others are coming soon.\nApple Pay can speed transactions because people don't have to re-enter card and contact information, though people need to enable the service first. Apple says that websites and apps accepting Apple Pay report seeing twice as many people complete transactions, compared with other payment methods.\nSeparately, Samsung says a payment service on its phones, Samsung Pay, will start offering points for each transaction, regardless of the amount spent. They will be redeemable for gift cards and Samsung products.\nAmericans are just starting to warm up to mobile payment services such as Apple Pay and Samsung Pay. One of the chief hurdles is the fact that for in-store transactions, it's not that difficult to pull out a plastic card to pay. And many merchants still do not accept such mobile payments. Although usage is growing, mobile payments are still a small portion of overall sales.",

Credit: HP   PCs \nHP has been hoping that sleek, powerful hardware will lure Apple Mac aficionados to switch to its PCs, and now is aiming the new Z2 Mini mini-desktop at Mac Mini users. \nThe Z2 Mini packs the computing power of a full-size desktop into a box that can be held in one hand. Starting at $699, it will be available worldwide starting in December. \nHP has been excelling in PC design, with innovative desktops like Pavilion Wave , a cylindrical desktop, and Elite Slice , a modular mini-desktop onto which components can be snapped. [ Best Bluetooth speakers: We'll help you find the best wireless speakers for pairing with your smartphone or tablet—whatever your budget, and whatever music floats your boat. ] \nThe 2.4-kilogram Z2 Mini can cram an Intel server CPU and discrete Nvidia GPU -- both of which have their own cooling fans -- into a tiny space while delivering screaming performance. \nThe Z2 Mini could be an alternative for those looking to replace the aging Mac Mini, which hasn't received a design or hardware upgrade for years now. \nApple has been abandoning the professional market and for engineers and designers, the Z2 Mini is superior to the Mac Mini, said Jeff Wood, vice president of HP's workstation business, during a briefing. \nThe idea that Apple is stepping away from the professional market was highlighted during the recent release of the MacBook Pro , which has innovative features like the Touch Bar. But it attracted criticism for using old Intel Skylake chips, and was widely considered more of a consumer than a business PC. \nApple also hasn't upgraded its Mac Pro desktop since 2013, and workstations with Windows are filling that void. The new Windows workstations have superior processors, GPUs, memory and SSD storage. \nThe Z2 Mini is targeted at engineers and architects using applications like Autodesk or Solidworks. However, it isn't meant for use with VR headsets like Oculus Rift or HTC Vive, an HP spokesperson said. Nvidia's Quadro M620 GPU isn't designed for VR, and headsets typically need full-powered desktops like the Z840 with cutting-edge GPUs. \nThe Z2 mini-desktop can be configured with Intel's Xeon E3-1200v5 CPU, or Core chips. It supports up to 32GB of memory and up to 1.5TB of storage. \nAn entry-level model will have three DisplayPort ports, two USB 3.0 ports and an Ethernet port. A fully loaded model will have two additional USB Type-C ports. \nBut some features are missing. It doesn't have an HDMI port to attach displays, or a Thunderbolt 3 slot to attach high-speed storage. Workstation users dealing with high-end graphics need more than 1.5TB of storage, and the USB 3.0 port, with its data transfer speed of 10Gbps (bits per second), may not be enough. Storage devices attached to a Thunderbolt 3 port -- which transfers data at 40Gbps -- can be used in real time, much like internal storage. \nThe Z2 can be mounted behind a monitor so it remains hidden.

      "text": "Some tech companies are now selling solar energy. (© AP Images) Tech giants Apple and Google get into the solar business Nov 15, 2016 37 \nThe next time you turn on the lights, you may have a tech company to thank, instead of a traditional utility. \nApple Inc. and Google rely on solar and other renewable energy to power their big data centers. But they also have the ability to sell their surplus renewable energy directly in the electricity market. \nThe reason is simple: It’s good for the environment and good for these companies’ finances. When tech companies sell excess electricity from solar directly to consumers, they make more money. Meanwhile their customers benefit from cheaper, stable renewable energy prices. “Locking that in at a low price is really critical for them,” said Ash Sharma , a solar energy analyst at IHS Technology. \nFor many companies, electricity is one of their biggest costs. \nBoth Apple and Google won awards for green power leadership from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in October. The EPA’s Janet McCabe said these moves make a difference: “As we continue to act on climate, I encourage them to continue to set a high bar for others to achieve.” Renewable costs plummet \nThe falling cost of certain renewables has attracted more companies’ attention. In the past five years, the price of solar power, for example, has dropped almost 70 percent. And it’s projected to fall still further. \nBefore last year’s landmark climate deal , 154 companies, including Apple, Google, Amazon.com and Wal-mart Stores laid out plans to reduce emissions and support the global climate agreement as part of the American Business Act on Climate Pledge . This year, world leaders are meeting in Morocco to finalize rules for the Paris agreement, as the cost of solar energy continues to set records . \nAt this point, “no politician or citizen, no business manager or investor” can doubt that the world is determined to shift toward a “low-emission, resilient society,” said United Nations climate chief Patricia Espinosa. \nAre companies in your country supporting climate goals?

Beck Diefenbach, Reuters \nApple Inc. is considering expanding into wearable glass headsets and has talked about the project with potential suppliers, Bloomberg reported citing people familiar with the matter. \nThe wearable headset would show images, along with other information and may use augmented reality, according to the report . \nChief Executive Tim Cook, who has been struggling with a slowdown in iPhone sales in recent quarters, said earlier this year that the company would continue to invest a lot into augmented reality. \nApple, the world's largest technology company, has ordered a small number of near-eye displays for testing but has not obtained enough for production on a larger scale, the report added. \nApple declined to comment. \nThe move would make Apple the latest tech company to venture into wearable glasses. \nAlphabet Inc.'s discontinued its own wearable glass headset, Google Glass, and closed the social media account linked to the device earlier this year, ending its attempt to popularize the expensive devices with consumers. \nThe device received plenty of attention when it was launched in 2012, but quickly ran into problems with its awkward appearance and privacy concerns over video recording. \nSnap, an $18 billion company which makes the popular messaging app Snapchat, also launched its own video-camera sunglasses last week. \nShare",

Credit: HP   9:05   \nHP has been hoping that sleek, powerful hardware will lure Apple Mac aficionados to switch to its PCs, and now is aiming the new Z2 Mini mini-desktop at Mac Mini users. \nThe Z2 Mini packs the computing power of a full-size desktop into a box that can be held in one hand. Starting at $699, it will be available worldwide starting in December. \nHP has been excelling in PC design, with innovative desktops like Pavilion Wave , a cylindrical desktop, and Elite Slice , a modular mini-desktop onto which components can be snapped. \nThe 2.4-kilogram Z2 Mini can cram an Intel server CPU and discrete Nvidia GPU -- both of which have their own cooling fans -- into a tiny space while delivering screaming performance. \nThe Z2 Mini could be an alternative for those looking to replace the aging Mac Mini, which hasn't received a design or hardware upgrade for years now. \nApple has been abandoning the professional market and for engineers and designers, the Z2 Mini is superior to the Mac Mini, said Jeff Wood, vice president of HP's workstation business, during a briefing. \nThe idea that Apple is stepping away from the professional market was highlighted during the recent release of the MacBook Pro , which has innovative features like the Touch Bar. But it attracted criticism for using old Intel Skylake chips, and was widely considered more of a consumer than a business PC. \nApple also hasn't upgraded its Mac Pro desktop since 2013, and workstations with Windows are filling that void. The new Windows workstations have superior processors, GPUs, memory and SSD storage. \nThe Z2 Mini is targeted at engineers and architects using applications like Autodesk or Solidworks. However, it isn't meant for use with VR headsets like Oculus Rift or HTC Vive, an HP spokesperson said. Nvidia's Quadro M620 GPU isn't designed for VR, and headsets typically need full-powered desktops like the Z840 with cutting-edge GPUs. \nThe Z2 mini-desktop can be configured with Intel's Xeon E3-1200v5 CPU, or Core chips. It supports up to 32GB of memory and up to 1.5TB of storage. \nAn entry-level model will have three DisplayPort ports, two USB 3.0 ports and an Ethernet port. A fully loaded model will have two additional USB Type-C ports. \nBut some features are missing. It doesn't have an HDMI port to attach displays, or a Thunderbolt 3 slot to attach high-speed storage. Workstation users dealing with high-end graphics need more than 1.5TB of storage, and the USB 3.0 port, with its data transfer speed of 10Gbps (bits per second), may not be enough. Storage devices attached to a Thunderbolt 3 port -- which transfers data at 40Gbps -- can be used in real time, much like internal storage. \nThe Z2 can be mounted behind a monitor so it remains hidden.

In Australia, Melanie Tan Pelaez had her Apple iPhone 7 plugged in while at the same time she had hit the sack. She fell asleep, and when she awoke the next morning, something was wrong. Her right arm was red, and she felt pins and needles up and down the length of it.After taking a trip to the hospital, Doctors told her that she had suffered a second degree burn which had come from a foreign object. At the ER, Melanie was treated and released (by the way, did we tell you that she is pregnant? No damage was done to the fetus). The doctors told Ms. Tan Pelaez to check around her bed to find the source of her burn. When she returned home, she realized that her iPhone 7 had caused the injury. Markings on her arm matched the phone and the charger.Melanie then took her phone to the local Apple Store, where she was told that the unit lacked a certain distinctive smell that would have proved that it was at fault. Still, her phone was packed up and shipped to Cupertino for testing. While Tan Pelaez was offered a new iPhone 7, she refused to take it because she no longer trusts the device even though she has been an iPhone user from the very first model. She has not yet filed a lawsuit against Apple, although that remains a possibility. Meanwhile, the victim has met with a plastic surgeon and some painful surgical procedures appear to be on the horizon.Covering a charging phone with a body or a pillow prevents any air from circulating. That makes the phone extremely hot. If you stream movies while stretched out in bed, make sure that you leave room for your phone to circulate air. And unplug the phone from the charger if you must use your phone in bed. Otherwise, you could find yourself waking up with severe burns on your body, just like Melanie Tan Pelaez did.

But Bloomberg 's anonymous sources tell it that Apple is looking at a glasses-like device, which may be linked t0 - but probably not the same thing as - said TV. \nIt's not been much of a secret that Apple is looking into augmented reality right now, with Tim C0ok's comments on his interest being pretty explicit, not to mention the numerous patents which have surfaced. \nBloomberg says Apple has already been in talks with potential suppliers for components of a glasses-like device and \"has ordered small quantities of near-eye displays from one supplier\" for testing purposes. \nThe device would connect to the iPhone and present images over the wearer's vision - a la Google Glass. \nhe device would connect wirelessly to iPhones, show images and other information in the wearer's field of vision, and may use augmented reality, the people said. They asked not to be identified speaking about a secret project. \nMust-read: An investigation into Apple's AR and VR plans \nThis doesn't mean a product is definitely on its way, and if it is, one of the sources said we shouldn't expect to see anything until 2018 at the earliest. It would be the second major new hardware category launched under Tim Cook, the first being the Apple Watch. Tim Cook: all about the wearables. \nHowever Cook has gently nudged away speculation that Apple would be going first to VR, saying that he sees more value in augmented reality.

      "text": "Apple stock extends losses after China warning on Trump Noel Randewich, Reuters   03:32 PM \nShare Facebook \nSAN FRANCISCO - Apple's stock extended recent losses on Monday after a warning that iPhone sales could suffer if President-elect Donald Trump follows through on campaign threats to impose new tariffs on China. \nApple is among several major technology stocks, including Amazon.com, Facebook and Alphabet, selling off since Tuesday's election as investors shift funds into financial and public works companies seen benefiting from deregulation and infrastructure spending under President-elect Trump. \nIn a continuation of that trend, the Cupertino, California company's stock fell 2.5 percent on Monday, bringing its loss since Tuesday's election to almost 5 percent, compared to the S&P 500's 1.16 percent advance. \nAdding to concern for Apple investors, an op-ed published in the China government-backed Global Times on Sunday warned of \"tit-for-tat\" retaliation should Trump follow through on a campaign pledge to impose 45-percent tariffs on all imports from China. \n\"A batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus. US auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and US soybean and maize imports will be halted,\" the op-ed said. \nChina has already become a disappointment for Apple, failing to deliver rapid growth that the company hoped would make up for slower iPhone sales in the United States and other mature markets. \nRevenue from China slumped 30 percent in Apple's September quarter, worse than the Americas' 7 percent decline. \nApple's China sales could be hurt by potential trade conflicts as well as the country's weakening currency, said Rosenblatt Securities analyst Jun Zhang by email. He said he believes China iPhone sales fell in October, even after fixing supply issues affecting the iPhone 7 Plus. \nSynovus Trust Company Senior Portfolio Manager Daniel Morgan, who owns $33 million worth of Apple shares, warned not to read too much into Trump's campaign trail threats against China, at least in the near term. \n\"You just don't just jump in and start rewriting trade agreements,\" Morgan said. \nShare",

(AP Photo/Eric Risberg) \nNEW YORK • Apple is making it easier for people to give to charities by expanding its Apple Pay payments service to nonprofits. \nApple Pay is mostly known for enabling purchases at retail stores with the tap of an iPhone, although the service can also be used for online transactions on apps and websites. Apple had limited this to buying goods and services — until now. \nThe American Red Cross, United Way and 18 other nonprofits will accept Apple Pay starting Monday. Others are coming soon. \nApple Pay can speed transactions because people don't have to re-enter card and contact information, though people need to enable the service first. Apple says that websites and apps accepting Apple Pay report seeing twice as many people complete transactions, compared with other payment methods.",

According to Bloomberg’s sources, the company has ordered small quantities of near-eye displays to test its concept.

It’s believed that Apple will look to launch these glasses in 2018 at the earliest, if it goes through with it at all. Will…\n\nThis story continues at The Next Web",

      "text": "Apple iPhone 7 Demand to Reportedly Drop In the Coming Months 8:32 am By Hammad Saleem \nIt’s been around two months since Apple unveiled their latest iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus across the globe. \nAccording to KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, Apple iPhone 7 demand has peaked, in line with expectations, and will significantly drop in the coming months. \nThe analyst said the decline in the demand of the iPhone 7 will commence this month and will continue to fall even in December. \nKuo also mentioned that Apple’s overseas suppliers will revise their iPhone shipments down by 5-15 percent in November and December due to weaker demand as there aren’t any significant improvements with the new devices. \nAs the 4.7-inch iPhone 7, which accounts for a higher share of iPhone shipments, is in stock in the main global markets, we believe overall iPhone shipments have peaked. We think iPhone shipment forecasts will be revised down due to: (1) lower-than-expected demand due to a lack of spec surprises in the 4.7-inch iPhone 7; and (2) shorter times for delivering online orders of 5.5-inch iPhone 7 Plus, which implies slowing demand. We note that the out-of-stock phenomenon also results from fixed capacity, and is not only due to robust demand. \nSurprisingly, the analyst also noted that the out-of-stock phenomenon which usually happens in the launch of the new iPhones is due to fixed capacity, and not necessarily due to high demand. Kuo also predicted of a year-over-year iPhone shipment decline in the first quarter of 2017 due to low demand and extreme competition in China.",

      "title": "It looks like the Galaxy S8 will add one of Apple’s core iPhone 7 features",
      "text": "Samsung may still be reeling from the fiasco that was the explosion-prone Galaxy Note 7, but the South Korean tech giant remains focused on releasing new smartphones with compelling features that will, if all goes according to plan, help everyone forget about the company's ill-fated phablet recall.\nSamsung Galaxy S8 rumors have been coming in at a furious clip lately, and the most recent report relays that Samsung's next-gen smartphone will incorporate a pressure sensitive display, similar to what Apple first introduced with its 3D Touch feature on the iPhone 6s last year.\nDON'T MISS: The 5 best new features coming to your iPhone in iOS 10.2\nAccording to an anonymous Samsung supplier who spoke to The Korea Herald , Samsung is considering adding the feature to the S8 and, later on down the line, perhaps to other devices in its product lineup as well.\nPhoneArena adds :\nA Samsung component division exec has also tipped that the Force Touch tech is coming to its flagships \"in the near future,\" though it may take a while to roll down the midrange, so that's a second source to hint at a Galaxy S8 with pressure-sensitive display right there. We've been hearing this story for the Galaxy S7 as well, but the S8 is apparently going to be redesigned completely, so there is a much higher chance for a Force Touch display to happen there.\nThat Samsung is interested in releasing a pressure sensitive display should hardly come as a surprise given that competitors in the smartphone market routinely copy and modify features from rival handset manufacturers. Indeed, rumors of Android manufacturers looking to get on the pressure sensitive display bandwagon first came to light more than a year ago when Synaptics issued a press release touting that its new ClearForce touchscreen display controller that can detect varying levels of pressure.\nNow whether or not anyone will be captivated by a Galaxy S8 with a pressure sensitive display remains to be seen. Recall that 3D Touch was heralded as a great new interface breakthrough when it launched but never really became as widely used as some initially anticipated. If anything, it's taken a good full year of development, both from Apple and from third-parties, to transform 3D Touch into a feature that's more useful than it is just a gimmick.\nAs for other Galaxy S8 features we can expect to see, Samsung last week confirmed that its next-gen smartphone will feature an intelligent personal assistant similar to Siri. Aside from that, the S8 is also rumored to feature a dual-lens camera on the back, an iris-recognition camera on the front, and enhanced wireless charging capabilities.\nTrending right now:\nThe 5 best new features coming to your iPhone in iOS 10.2 Best Buy just released a brand new Black Friday ad: Here’s what changed Best Buy’s Black Friday sale includes a killer deal no other store else has See the original version of this article on BGR.com",

      "text": "President-elect Donald Trump has vowed time and time again to return America to greatness. One of the pillars of that greatness is the US-China economic relationship, which Trump clearly wants to alter. But an editorial piece in one of China’s state-run newspapers can be seen as a warning of what might happen to Trump’s America in the event that a trade war erupts.\nDON’T MISS: The 5 best new features coming to your iPhone in iOS 10.2\nAccording to The Global Times , there’s little Trump can do to keep his promises. But if he does act, and he follows through on his campaign pledge to implement a 45% tariff on Chinese exports to the US, then the population at large may suffer. Even the iPhone, the flagship product of one of the most profitable American companies, will suffer the consequences of Trump’s economic initiatives.\n“Trump's accusations against China for currency manipulation cannot hold water,” the Times noted. “If he does list China as a currency manipulator and slap steep tariffs on Chinese imports, China will take countermeasures.”\n\"China will take a tit-for-tat approach then,\" the paper added. \"A batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus. US auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and US soybean and maize imports will be halted. China can also limit the number of Chinese students studying in the US.\"\nIt continued, \"If Trump wrecks Sino-US trade, a number of US industries will be impaired. Finally the new president will be condemned for his recklessness, ignorance, and incompetence and bear all the consequences.\"\nThe paper calls Trump a “shrewd businessman” who won’t be “so naive” to keep his campaign trail promises. The paper also notes that the president can impose tariffs of up to 15% for up to 150 days on all imported goods, and the limit can be broken only if America is in a state of emergency.\nOn the other hand, if there’s one thing that's certain about Trump, it's that he can take a stand on both sides of an argument, regardless of what it is. Even if it’s about the complex relationship between the US and China.\nWe’ll just have to wait for Trump to be sworn in before we see what effect, if any, his presidency will have on Apple’s iPhone.\nTrending right now:\nThe 5 best new features coming to your iPhone in iOS 10.2\nBest Buy just released a brand new Black Friday ad: Here’s what changed\nBest Buy’s Black Friday sale includes a killer deal no other store else has\nSee the original version of this article on BGR.com",

      "text": "  Laut Kantar Worldpanel ComTech konnte Apple und iOS in den USA im 3. Quartal 2016 den Marktanteil um 5,2 Prozent auf 34,2 Prozent ausbauen. Im Gegenzug verlor Google mit Android in den USA 3,3 Prozent, der Marktanteil sank hier von 66,7 auf 63,4 Prozent. Der Markt für Microsoft und Windows auf dem Smartphone bricht weltweit weiter schnell zusammen. In den USA zuletzt mit minus 2,0 Prozent auf nur noch 1,9 Prozent Marktanteil. In den USA sowie in drei von fünf der in Europa wichtigsten Märkten, die Kantar Worldpanel ComTech mit Deutschland, Frankreich, Großbritannien, Italien und Spanien als EU5-Länder zusammenfasst, konnte sich Apple mit dem iPhone 7 und iPhone 7 Plus als Bestseller im September 2016 einige Marktanteile zurückholen. So machten iPhone 7 und iPhone 7 Plus in UK im September beispielsweise 15,1 Prozent aller Smartphone-Verkäufe aus und verhalf iOS dort zu 40,6 Prozent Marktanteil. Das entspricht einem Plus von 2,4 Prozent im Vergleich zum Vorjahreszeitraum Q3/2015. In Deutschland legte Android im diesjährigen September-Quartal um 7,2 Prozent, von 73,9 auf 81,1 Prozent zu. Apple iOS verlor in Deutschland 2,5 Prozentpunkte, der Marktanteil schrumpfte von 17,5 auf 15,0 Prozent. Für Microsoft und Windows auf dem Smartphone setzte sich die rasante Talfahrt fort. Der Marktanteil von Windows bröckelte hierzulande von 7,6 auf 3,3 Prozent ab. Für China hob Kantar Worldpanel ComTech im Marktbericht das enorme Wachstum von Oppo ( BBK ) besonders hervor. Laut Kantar konnte Oppo in China den Marktanteil um 8,2 Prozent auf stattliche 11,2 Prozent steigern und rangiert damit jetzt auf Platz 4 der größten Smartphone-Labels in China. Gemäß Kantar löste das Oppo R9 in China das iPhone 6s von Apple als Bestseller in Q3/2016 ab. Tests",

Best-selling smartphones in the US: iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. by Ronald Matta Business Smartphone Working For Notebookcheck Are you a loyal reader of notebookcheck? Are you a techie who knows how to write? Then join our Team! Especially wanted:   Kantar Worldpanel ComTech reports a solid US market share increase for iOS during the third quarter of 2016 to 34.2% (plus 5.2%). Both iOS and Android made gains across most of the EU5 countries (Great Britain, Germany, France, Italy, and Spain ). However, Android posted a 3.3 percentage point decline in the US from 66.7% to 63.4%, while iOS share fell in Germany from 17.5% to 15% and in Urban China from 18.7% to 14.2%. Lauren Guenveur, Consumer Insight Director for Kantar Worldpanel ComTech: \"In the US, the new iPhone 7 and 7 Plus models made an immediate impact, becoming the best-selling smartphones in the month of September at 17.1%. Strong sales of the iPhone 7 and the lower-priced iPhone 6s, the second best-selling device in the US in September, contributed to an overall growth of iOS to 34.2% in the third quarter of 2016. Despite some sales from the beleaguered Samsung Galaxy Note 7, still technically available through the month of September, Samsung posted a year-on-year decline from 36.9% to 33.8% of US smartphone sales in the third quarter. The holiday sales season may prove to be more challenging than normal for Samsung, who competes head-to-head with Apple during this crucial time of year.\" Fallout from the Note 7 recall could have an unintended impact on continuing sales of other, similarly-named Samsung devices like the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge , as consumers may not always understand the difference between the model names, Guenveur continues. However, deep holiday discounts, as we saw with the Galaxy S6 last year, may counteract any expected negative impact, as the driving reason for choice among US consumers remains finding a good deal on the price of the phone. In Urban China Oppo ( BBK ) continues to see significant growth, gaining 8.2 percentage points over the past year to become the 4th largest manufacturer with 11.2% of smartphone sales. The Oppo R9 overtook the iPhone 6s as the best-selling device in the third quarter, reported Tamsin Timpson, Strategic Insight Director at Kantar Worldpanel ComTech Asia.  ",

      "text": "By Vlad Dudau News Editor Neowin LLC @avladd · 15 minutes ago with 0 comments \nApple’s next big product may be another wearable, which takes a new spin on a product we’re all highly familiar with: glasses. Yes, despite Google Glass’ massive failure , Apple is reportedly looking to try its hand at the same augmented or mixed reality market. \nTim Cook and Apple’s engineers have been under increasing pressure to deliver a new product that's destined to become a massive hit. Despite still selling in huge volumes, Apple’s iPhones and iPads have seen their numbers continue to fall , and the recently unveiled iPhone 7 models seem to only be having a limited positive impact in the short-term according to data from the markets and analyst Ming-Chi Kuo . Similarly, Apple’s new MacBook Pro was met with a mix of anger and derision by many technology enthusiasts, for its antiquated hardware and reliance on dongles for peripheral support. The company seems to be losing a bit of its luster. \nAs such, Apple - like other major technology companies - is always working and testing new products behind the scenes. And according to unnamed sources, quoted by Bloomberg, the Cupertino-based company is looking at smart glasses as the next big thing. \nThough still at the testing stage, Apple’s smart glasses project has many features that will be familiar to those acquainted with Google Glass. The company’s prototypes are said to offer mapping, contextual information, voice commands, and work by connecting to a nearby iPhone. \nThe entire project revolves around mixed, or augmented, reality. Earlier in the year, Tim Cook expressed his enthusiasm for such technology , saying that he believed it would soon become commonplace, and that we’ll wonder how we ever lived without it. While that may sound like Cook was hinting at a new product line, things may still change, and the device might be cancelled. One of the Google Glass models, that failed to impress \nThe company has only ordered limited components for now, indicating it’s still in the testing phase. Plus, Google came out with a similar project years ago, which eventually failed, in big part due to privacy and battery life concerns. If anything, Apple has proven it doesn’t have a solution yet for that latter problem, possibly putting its own project in a precarious position. \nEven if does come out, one of the sources behind this report said it couldn’t happen before 2018. The company is still waiting for hardware components to become faster, smaller and more power-efficient before they can be properly packaged and sold to consumers in the form of eyewear. \nFinally, it’s very interesting that Apple is looking at this now, because it looks like smart glasses are having a bit of a resurgence. Though Microsoft’s HoloLens is much more complex than 'simple' smart glasses, it does fall into this category. Then there’s Snapchat’s Spectacles , which were unexpectedly introduced, and which have the potential of appealing to younger users and become a hit overnight. \nWhether or not Apple will manage to put out a product in time and compete in this market remains to be seen, but it looks like users may have a number of choices in this department either way.",

      "text": "With tablets pretty much hanging by a thread nowadays, traditional PCs stagnating after a free fall from mainstream popularity, smartphones heading for their first ever decline , and smartwatches still seeking that compelling use case , Apple is left wondering what the industry’s “next big thing” might be.\nSelf-driving cars ? Autonomous virtual reality headsets ? How about AR-based smart glasses? That latter concept is reportedly worth a revisit and second R&D try following Google’s monumental failure of getting it off the ground , sealed just last year.\nGoogle Glass, or Project Glass, was very enthusiastically received by “explorers” back in 2013, but privacy and safety concerns, not to mention battery life shortcomings and, well, a decidedly douchey design ultimately killed the oh-so-full-of-promise wearable initiative.\nSince then, many tech veterans and big fishes showed interest in VR hardware and software rather than AR, including El Goog , Samsung , HTC , Sony and Facebook . Not Microsoft though, which remains invested in mixed reality HoloLens gear powered by the Windows Holographic platform, while Apple is likely still in the early stages of any sort of development in this field.\nDon’t expect an advanced Apple Glass prototype to be outed before 2018 therefore, and like other projects in Cupertino “exploration” and careful consideration, a pivot, pause or altogether cancellation are always possible.\nAs for what the product may do if it ever materializes, all we know is it would probably “connect wirelessly to iPhones, show images and other information in the wearer’s field of vision”, as well as “use augmented reality” technology… somehow. That’s certainly vague but also arguably intriguing.\nThe post Unfazed by the Google Glass flop, Apple is reportedly considering its own AR smart glasses appeared first on Pocketnow .\n",

      "text": "Samsung may still be reeling from the fiasco that was the explosion-prone Galaxy Note 7, but the South Korean tech giant remains focused on releasing new smartphones with compelling features that will, if all goes according to plan, help everyone forget about the company's ill-fated phablet recall. Samsung Galaxy S8 rumors have been coming in at a furious clip lately, and the most recent report relays that Samsung's next-gen smartphone will incorporate a pressure sensitive display, similar to what Apple first introduced with its 3D Touch feature on the iPhone 6s last year.\n\nDON'T MISS:  The 5 best new features coming to your iPhone in iOS 10.2 \nAccording to an anonymous Samsung supplier who spoke to The Korea Herald , Samsung is considering adding the feature to the S8 and, later on down the line, perhaps to other devices in its product lineup as well.\nPhoneArena adds :\n\nA Samsung component division exec has also tipped that the Force Touch tech is coming to its flagships \"in the near future,\" though it may take a while to roll down the midrange, so that's a second source to hint at a Galaxy S8 with pressure-sensitive display right there. We've been hearing this story for the Galaxy S7 as well, but the S8 is apparently going to be redesigned completely, so there is a much higher chance for a Force Touch display to happen there.\nThat Samsung is interested in releasing a pressure sensitive display should hardly come as a surprise given that competitors in the smartphone market routinely copy and modify features from rival handset manufacturers. Indeed, rumors of Android manufacturers looking to get on the pressure sensitive display bandwagon first came to light more than a year ago when Synaptics issued a press release touting that its new ClearForce touchscreen display controller that can detect varying levels of pressure.\nNow whether or not anyone will be captivated by a Galaxy S8 with a pressure sensitive display remains to be seen. Recall that 3D Touch was heralded as a great new interface breakthrough when it launched but never really became as widely used as some initially anticipated. If anything, it's taken a good full year of development, both from Apple and from third-parties, to transform 3D Touch into a feature that's more useful than it is just a gimmick.\nAs for other Galaxy S8 features we can expect to see, Samsung last week confirmed that its next-gen smartphone will feature an intelligent personal assistant similar to Siri. Aside from that, the S8 is also rumored to feature a dual-lens camera on the back, an iris-recognition camera on the front, and enhanced wireless charging capabilities.\nTrending right now: \nThe 5 best new features coming to your iPhone in iOS 10.2 Best Buy just released a brand new Black Friday ad: Here’s what changed Best Buy’s Black Friday sale includes a killer deal no other store else has See the original version of this article on BGR.com",

      "text": "( People's Daily Online ) 16:53, November 15, 2016 (Photo/thepapaer.cn) \nHuawei released its new flagship smartphone Mate 9 in Shanghai on Nov. 14. Aiming to compete with Apple's iPhone, the Mate 9 is Huawei's first mobile phone priced at over 5,000 RMB, said Yu Chengdong, CEO of Huawei's consumer business group, Thepaper.cn reported. \n\"We hope the M9 has a better customer experience performance than Apple [phones do]. Otherwise, consumers will not pay more money to buy the phones,\" reasoned Yu. \nThis attempt to enter the high-end market is a first for Huawei. The company developed its last flagship smartphone, dual-camera P9, with Leica several months ago. At that time, there were three versions of the Mate 9: regular (priced 3,000-4,000 RMB), Mate Pro (4,000-5,000 RMB) and the Porsche version (up to 8,999 RMB). \nThe domestic price is more than 1,000 RMB cheaper than the European version. The Porsche sells in Europe for 1,395 euros, equivalent to about 10,460 RMB. \n\"In addition to independent innovation, Huawei also needs to develop new products with its partners. The new design with Porsche has received good feedback in Europe,\" Yu noted. The price of the Mate 9 is higher than that of Apple's iPhone. \nAccording to Huawei, its overseas mobile phone market share is more than 15 percent in 30 foreign countries, and over 20 percent in 20 countries. \n\"Our sales in European countries doubled this year,\" said Yu. However, in the mid-range domestic mobile phone market, Huawei has been surpassed by OPPO and Vivo. Statistics show that OPPO and Vivo respectively took up 16.6 percent and 16.2 percent of domestic market shares in the first three quarters this year, while Huawei's shares totaled 15 percent. \nAccording to Yu, Huawei is focusing more on long-term competitiveness, to achieve breakthroughs in core fields and key technologies. Huawei's expenditure on research and development is more than the sum of all other domestic mobile phone brands, and the company has zero tolerance for quality issues. \n\"Innovation is always accompanied by risks, so we have a full risk control system,\" Yu explained. \nHuawei has also announced plans to establish an Android green alliance with Alibaba, Baidu, Tencent and Netease. The alliance is committed to jointly building up the Android green application environment and creating a safe, reliable, healthy system of applications.

      "title": "Apple's Phil Schiller: putting touch on Macs is 'absurd'",
      "text": "By Justin Luna Neowin LLC @_justinluna · 9 minutes ago with 2 comments \nTouch screen devices are becoming very prominent today, from smartphones, tablets, and even desktop computers like the Surface Studio .While Microsoft made a touch-enabled user interface with Windows 8, which was improved when Windows 10 came out, its rival, Apple, stuck with its non-touch experience with the Mac, even after introducing the Touch Bar on its new MacBook . \nIn a recent interview with Backchannel , Apple's senior vice president of worldwide marketing Phil Schiller explained that creating a touch experience for the MacBook 'wouldn't be enough,' saying that doing so could create a divide between the MacBook and iMac. \nIn line with the topic, he called touch on the desktop a 'disaster.'“Can you imagine a 27-inch iMac where you have to reach over the air to try to touch and do things? he continued, \"That becomes absurd.” He emphasized that the iMac's main source of interaction relies on the keyboard, and mouse or trackpad. “You can’t optimize for both,” he says. “It’s the lowest common denominator thinking.” \nSchiller admitted that Apple was indeed internally testing out touch capability, but has concluded that it wasn't the right thing to do. \"Our instincts were that it didn't, but, what the heck, we could be wrong—so our teams worked on that for a number of times over the years,” says Schiller. \"Our instincts were correct.” \nTalking about the newly unveiled Touch Bar on the MacBook Pro, he said: \n“Its implementation is pure Mac. The thought and vision from the very beginning was not at all, ‘How do we put iOS in the Mac?’ It was entirely, ‘How to you use the [iOS] technology to make a better Mac experience?’” \nFurthermore, Schiller is optimistic regarding its decision to primarily use USB-C ports. “We’re absolutely more sure than ever that we’ve done the right thing,” he said. Regarding dongles, he said that most people won't need the said accessories. However, those who do can pick up dongles, which recently experienced price cuts . \nMoreover, Schiller defended Apple regarding claims that it has lost its innovative edge. He said: \n“We work hard on these things, and they are the best. We care about the feedback but we know that the fundamental difference on where their opinions are coming is between those who had a chance to use it and those who haven’t. There are people who want us to innovate faster and when we do there’s people who say, ‘Whoa, whoa, you’re going too fast.’ That’s just a balance in the world.” \nHe concludes that their team has made smart choices, and claims that the MacBook Pro is the best notebook that can be made with the greatest technology. With his recent statement that the new device is the ' fastest selling MacBook Pro ever ,' how Apple will innovate further in a growing touch-centric tech world in the future will remain to be seen.",

      "text": "Samsung's Galaxy S8 could borrow from Apple's playbook by introducing a pressure-sensitive technology, sometimes referred to as \"force touch\" or Apple's term \"3D Touch,\" according to Korean news publication The Investor .\n\"Samsung is [looking] to adopt the force touch technology partially from the S8 but the full adoption will come in one or two years,\" anonymous sources told the site.\nApple pioneered 3D Touch in phones.\nPhoto by Patrick Holland/CNET The technology uses a pressure-sensitive display to add an extra level of functionality to touch screens based off of how hard you press on it. Press and hold on an icon, for example, and a submenu could pop up to let you dive right into composing a text message or taking a selfie. Apple has been using the touchy feature since 2015 in products like the iPhone 6S , the original Apple Watch and several MacBooks .\nIt isn't clear what \"partial\" adoption is compared to \"full adoption,\" but this isn't the first time we've heard such a plan. Last year, similar rumors tipped a pressure sensitive display for the Galaxy S7 , which didn't wind up happening in the end.\nThe rumor is one of many coming out about the unannounced phone, joining others that suggest Samsung's forthcoming flagship phone will have two cameras and a dual-curved screen.\nSamsung said it would not comment on rumors or speculation.",

      "text": "TOMS Launches Apple Watch Straps   02:06 PST \nIt is no secret that Apple has long desired to position the Apple Watch as less of a typical gadget, but more like a gadget that fashion forward individuals would not mind sporting on their wrists for all kinds of events, whether it be at the gym, at a fashion show, or at a fancy dinner party. \nThis is why the company has teamed up with the likes of Hermes , and also why we have seen creations from Coach as well as far as Apple Watch straps are concerned. If you’re looking for more fashion-friendly straps, you’ll be pleased to learn that TOMS, a company known for their shoes and accessories has launched their own collection of straps . \nAs you can see in the image above, and if you have ever shopped at TOMS, you’ll realize that these straps are pretty much in line with the company’s image and theme, which is actually not a bad thing if you’re after something casual and not too over the top. They are split into two lineups: the $49 Utility Collection and the more expensive $75 leather-clad Artisan Collection. \nThe utility collection will feature the use of grosgrain fabric, some leather detailing, and a metal buckle and a free loop. They will also play nicely with either the 38mm or 42mm models of the Apple Watch. As for the artisan collection, this will see the use of a woven fabric top that has been attached to a full-length leather backing. Once again it will also play nicely with the 38mm and 42mm versions of the Apple Watch. If you’d like to get your hands on them, hit up TOMS’ website for the details.",

      "text": "Apple is reportedly testing a set of augmented reality glasses \"We are high on AR for the long run,\" Tim Cook said. Save REUTERS/Beck Diefenbach \nAccording to Apple insiders, Cupertino's next foray into the quickly expanding wearables market will be digital, augmented reality glasses. As Bloomberg reports , Apple has discussed a potential competitor to Snapchat's Spectacles and Google's Project Aura with its hardware suppliers and even ordered \"small quantities of near-eye displays\" for testing purposes. \nIf the Apple shades do become a reality, Bloomberg 's sources say they will connect wirelessly to an iPhone and will display information, images and other data directly in the user's field of view. At the earliest, a product like this could be announced sometime in 2018 at the earliest, but Apple is notoriously secretive with its product development, which could change course at any moment. What we do know, however, is that Tim Cook has been infatuated with augmented reality, and even more so after Pokémon Go became a widespread hit. \"We are high on AR for the long run,\" Cook said in an earnings call back in July. \"We think there are great things for customers and a great commercial opportunity.\" \nOverall, Tim Cook has been bullish on augmented reality . Earlier this year Apple hired up a high-profile AR expert from Microsoft's HoloLens team and purchased the pioneering AR and computer vision company Metaio back in 2015 . Although Google Glass flopped hard and Snapchat's offering is more like a wearable camera than an AR device, there's a sense that Apple might actually be able to pull off a can't-live-without-it face computer. On the other hand, we're still waiting for those AirPods to arrive.",

      "text": "Apple is making it easier for people to give to charities by expanding its Apple Pay payments service to nonprofits.\nApple Pay is mostly known for enabling purchases at retail stores with the tap of an iPhone, although the service can also be used for online transactions on apps and websites. Apple had limited this to buying goods and services — until now.\nThe American Red Cross , United Way and 18 other nonprofits will accept Apple Pay starting Monday. Others are coming soon.\nApple Pay can speed transactions because people don't have to re-enter card and contact information, though people need to enable the service first. Apple says that websites and apps accepting Apple Pay report seeing twice as many people complete transactions, compared with other payment methods.\nSeparately, Samsung says a payment service on its phones, Samsung Pay, will start offering points for each transaction, regardless of the amount spent. They will be redeemable for gift cards and Samsung products.\nAmericans are just starting to warm up to mobile payment services such as Apple Pay and Samsung Pay. One of the chief hurdles is the fact that for in-store transactions, it's not that difficult to pull out a plastic card to pay. And many merchants still do not accept such mobile payments. Although usage is growing, mobile payments are still a small portion of overall sales.\nAssociated Press\n American Red Cross United Way",

      "text": "Ian Hardy \nNovember 14, 2016 8:07pm \nApple’s first foray into wearables was in 2015 with the Watch but the next venture for the Cupertino-based company could see it progress to eyewear. \nAccording to a report in Bloomberg , Apple is currently testing a pair of smart glasses that displays “images and other information” and seamlessly connects to your iPhone, which is much like how the Watch operates. \nThis wearable sounds similar to Google Glass, which was released in 2013 and later shelved. \nApple is reportedly in the “exploration phase” and has ordered a small amount of near-eye displays from one of its suppliers. Apple tests several new product ideas and many do not make it to market. However, if this product does come to life the earliest release date will apparently be in 2018. Apple declined to comment on the report. \nApple’s CEO Tim Cook has been hinting the company might make a push into augmented reality and this might be its product. In July, Cook noted, “AR can be really great. We have been and continue to invest a lot in this. We’re high on AR in the long run.” Source Bloomberg The Iceman Cometh \nThis has been done already and Microsoft will be leaps and bounds ahead of them early next year with their VR offerings and the W10 Creators Edition upgrade Marc Palumbo \nI think that this will be a lot simpler than what Microsoft is planning. I would imagine this will be closer to the original Google Glass project. They’ll want it to be fashionable on your face. Also, I can’t see it having a small form factor without sacrificing hardware. Just comparing it to HoloLens, I don’t think they would want to compete with that just yet. But then again, Apple may give you some cheap piece of hardware (which they are not known for).

      "text": "Rob Attrell \nNovember 14, 2016 7:00am \nIn the last year or so, Apple has stepped up service and support efforts in a major way. \nBetween launching several Twitter accounts, including @AppleSupport , which won a prize from Twitter this week as the top customer service provider on the social network. Now, it appears Apple is ready for the global launch of a new support service that has been rumoured for at least a year, an iOS app called Apple Support. \nThe app first appeared in the iOS App Store in the Netherlands, and still hasn’t made it to any other countries yet. The new app shows any Apple products owned by the account holder, and includes help articles, live chat functionality, and the ability to book Genius appointments, with that last bit of functionality previously built in to the Apple Store app. \nIt’s unclear so far exactly when this app will get a global rollout, but assuming nothing goes wrong with the version released in the Netherlands, it will likely hit other markets soon. Many Apple Store visitors have complained that it’s difficult to get an Genius Bar appointment on short notice these days, so hopefully with live chat and the ability to schedule a support phone call from within the app, more people will be able to get the help they need without needing to visit a store. Source iOS App Store thereasoner \nWow! That was fast. This is a blatant rip of a feature exclusive to the new Pixel phones by Google. Usually it takes Apple years to catch up , this is pretty good for them !, if they can ever get it out of beta testing in the Netherlands that is.

      "text": "View Comments Pic: Reuters SAN FRANCISCO : Apple's stock extended recent losses on Monday after a warning that iPhone sales could suffer if President-elect Donald Trump follows through on campaign threats to impose new tariffs on China. Apple is among several major technology stocks, including Amazon.com, Facebook and Alphabet, selling off since Tuesday's election as investors shift funds into financial and public works companies seen benefiting from deregulation and infrastructure spending under President-elect Trump. In a continuation of that trend, the Cupertino, California company's stock fell 2.5 percent on Monday, bringing its loss since Tuesday's election to almost 5 percent, compared to the S&P 500's .SPX 1.16 percent advance. Adding to concern for Apple investors, an op-ed published in the China government-backed Global Times on Sunday warned of \"tit-for-tat\" retaliation should Trump follow through on a campaign pledge to impose 45-percent tariffs on all imports from China. \"A batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus. US auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and US soybean and maize imports will be halted,\" the op-ed said. China has already become a disappointment for Apple, failing to deliver rapid growth that the company hoped would make up for slower iPhone sales in the United States and other mature markets. Revenue from China slumped 30 percent in Apple's September quarter, worse than the Americas' 7 percent decline. Apple's China sales could be hurt by potential trade conflicts as well as the country's weakening currency, said Rosenblatt Securities analyst Jun Zhang by email. He said he believes China iPhone sales fell in October, even after fixing supply issues affecting the iPhone 7 Plus. Synovus Trust Company Senior Portfolio Manager Daniel Morgan, who owns $33 million worth of Apple shares, warned not to read too much into Trump's campaign trail threats against China, at least in the near term. \"You just don't just jump in and start rewriting trade agreements,\" Morgan said. -Reuters ",

      "text": "Designed by Apple in California Chronicles 20 Years of Apple Design \nNew Photo Book Tells the Story of Design at Apple November 15, 2016 07:00   \nCUPERTINO, Calif.- Apple® today announced the release of a new hardbound book chronicling 20 years of Apple’s design, expressed through 450 photographs of past and current Apple products. Designed by Apple in California , which covers products from 1998’s iMac® to 2015’s Apple Pencil®, also documents the materials and techniques used by Apple’s design team over two decades of innovation. \nThe book is dedicated to the memory of Steve Jobs. \n“The idea of genuinely trying to make something great for humanity was Steve’s motivation from the beginning, and it remains both our ideal and our goal as Apple looks to the future,” said Jony Ive, Apple’s chief design officer. “This archive is intended to be a gentle gathering of many of the products the team has designed over the years. We hope it brings some understanding to how and why they exist, while serving as a resource for students of all design disciplines.” \nThe products in this book are the result of a profoundly close collaboration between many different groups. Shot by photographer Andrew Zuckerman in a deliberately spare style, the book’s 450 images illustrate Apple’s design process as well as its finished products. \nIn the book’s foreword, Ive explains: While this is a design book, it is not about the design team, the creative process, or product development. It is an objective representation of our work that, ironically, describes who we are. It describes how we work, our values, our preoccupations, and our goals. We have always hoped to be defined by what we do rather than by what we say. We strive, with varying degrees of success, to define objects that appear effortless. Objects that appear so simple, coherent, and inevitable that there could be no rational alternative. \nDesigned by Apple in California is available in two sizes and printed on specially milled, custom-dyed paper with gilded matte silver edges, using eight color separations and low-ghost ink. This linen-bound, hardcover volume was developed over an eight-year period. It is published by Apple. \nPricing & Availability \nDesigned by Apple in California will be available beginning tomorrow, Wednesday, November 16, in small (10.20” x 12.75”) at $199 (US) and large (13” x 16.25”) at $299 (US) exclusively from Apple.com in Australia, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, the UK and the US, and select Apple Stores.* \nThe book is on display at the Apple Stores where it is sold. \n* Designed by Apple in California is available at the following Apple retail locations: Apple Regent Street and Apple Covent Garden in London; Apple Opera in Paris; Apple Kurfürstendamm in Berlin; Apple ifc mall and Apple Canton Road in Hong Kong; Apple Ginza in Tokyo; and Apple Sydney. \nIn the United States: Apple SoHo, Apple Fifth Avenue, Apple Upper East Side, Apple Williamsburg and Apple World Trade Center in New York; Apple The Grove in Los Angeles and Apple Third Street in Santa Monica; Apple North Michigan Avenue and Apple Lincoln Road in Chicago; Apple Northpark in Dallas; Apple Union Square in San Francisco; Apple Palo Alto and Apple Infinite Loop in Cupertino. \nApple revolutionized personal technology with the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984. Today, Apple leads the world in innovation with iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch and Apple TV. Apple’s four software platforms — iOS, macOS, watchOS and tvOS — provide seamless experiences across all Apple devices and empower people with breakthrough services including the App Store, Apple Music, Apple Pay and iCloud. Apple’s more than 100,000 employees are dedicated to making the best products on earth, and to leaving the world better than we found it. \nNOTE TO EDITORS: For additional information visit Apple’s PR website ( www.apple.com/pr ), or call Apple’s Media Helpline at (408) 974-2042. \n© 2016 Apple Inc.

      "text": "Shutterstock November 15, 2016 | 04:15AM PT \nApple is currently testing wearable augmented-reality glasses that the tech giant could launch as early as 2018, Bloomberg reported . \nThe Apple AR glasses would work with iPhones to display images and other information, and may include other augmented-reality features, according to the report, which cited anonymous sources. The company has ordered a small number of “near-eye displays” from a supplier for testing, per the Bloomberg report. \nApple has not been secretive about its interest in AR technology, which could represent a major new product category. That’s especially urgent for the company since sales of iPhones have slowed in recent quarters . \n“We are high on AR for the long run,” Apple CEO Tim Cook told analysts on the company’s quarterly earnings call in July. “We think there are great things for customers and a great commercial opportunity. And so we’re investing, and the No. 1 thing is to make sure our products work well with other developers’ products like Pokémon (Go).” ( Cook mispronounced it as “PO-keh-man,” instead of “PO-keh-mon.”) Related Apple Has Hired Hundreds for Virtual and Augmented Reality Development: Report \nIn 2013, Apple acquired Israeli motion-sensing startup PrimeSense, which had developed the technology for Microsoft’s Kinect gaming system. Since then Apple has bought augmented-reality startups Metaio and Flyby Media. \nAs a category, smart glasses have failed to take off so far. Google, an early entrant, last year killed off its consumer Google Glass products , which included video-recording features. \nBut Apple has a track record of taking product concepts that haven’t succeeded and turning them into mass-market hits (see: iPhone and iPad). \n“I do think that a significant portion of the population of developed countries, and eventually all countries, will have AR experiences every day, almost like eating three meals a day,” Cook said at the Utah Tech Tour conference in September. Despite some “really hard technology challenges,” he said, augmented reality “will happen in a big way and we will wonder how we ever lived without it, like we wonder how we lived without our phone today.” Related Microsoft’s Plan for Virtual and Augmented Reality Is to Have Headsets Run Windows \nTo date, tech companies have expended more time and money in virtual reality tech, with VR headsets including Facebook’s Oculus Rift, Samsung Gear VR, HTC Vive and Google’s new Daydream View . \nCompanies focusing on AR and “mixed reality” include heavily bankrolled startup Magic Leap and Microsoft, whose HoloLens headset lets users interact with holograms and digital content. In an adjacent move in the wearable computing market, Snap is starting to sell $130 video sunglasses, called Spectacles , designed to capture 10-second videos and upload them to Snapchat.

      "text": "International Business Chinese consumers' body takes up complaints of iPhone shutdowns with Apple The China Consumers Association (CCA) has asked Apple to investigate \"a considerable number\" of reports by users of iPhone 6 and 6s phones that the devices have been shutting off and cannot be turned back on again, it said on Tuesday. Posted 15 Nov 2016 19:50 Updated 15 Nov 2016 20:08 A salesperson cleans next to an iPhone 6 at an Apple store in Beijing, October 17, 2014. REUTERS/Jason Lee A \nREUTERS: The China Consumers Association (CCA) has asked Apple to investigate \"a considerable number\" of reports by users of iPhone 6 and 6s phones that the devices have been shutting off and cannot be turned back on again, it said on Tuesday (Nov 15). \nThe reported problems specifically involve users seeing their iPhones automatically shut off despite 50-60 per cent battery levels, and the involuntary shutting off in room temperature or colder environments, as well as the inability to turn the cellphone back on despite continuous battery charging, the statement said. \n\"In view that Apple iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s series cellphones in China have a considerable number of users, and the number of people who've reported this problem is rather many, China Consumer Association has already made a query with Apple,\" the association said in a statement on its website. \nApple did not respond to a request for comment when contacted outside regular hours on Tuesday. \nIn September Apple's rival phone maker Samsung Electronics Co announced a global recall of at least 2.5 million of its flagship Note 7 smartphones due to faulty batteries causing some phones to catch fire. \n(Reporting by Jess Macy Yu and Sijia Jiang; Editing by Greg Mahlich) - Reuters",

      "text": "Reddit \nApple has announced a new hardbound book, available for $199 or $299 online at Apple.com and Apple retail stores from tomorrow, which charts a 20-year history of Apple design from the iMac in 1998 to the Apple Pencil in 2015. The book features 450 photographs of Apple products new and old, including iPhone, iPod and Apple Watch. The book is called ‘Designed by Apple in California’ and is dedicated to Steve Jobs. \nThe book is available in two sizes and printed on specially milled, custom-dyed paper with silver edges. According to Apple, the book was created over an eight-year period and is published by the company itself, not a third-party. \nThe full-page images inside are shot by photographer Andrew Zuckerman and show off the finished products in addition to the design process. ‘Designed by Apple in California’ features total of 450 images spanning twenty years of Apple product design. \nHere’s how Jony Ive describes the purpose of the book: While this is a design book, it is not about the design team, the creative process or product development. It is an objective representation of our work that, ironically, describes who we are. It describes how we work, our values, our preoccupations and our goals. We have always hoped to be defined by what we do rather than by what we say. We strive, with varying degrees of success, to define objects that appear effortless. Objects that appear so simple, coherent and inevitable that there could be no rational alternative. As a specialist item, the book will only be available from Apple directly. From tomorrow, the book will be available from Apple.com in United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, Taiwan as well as “select” Apple Stores. The book is available in two sizes. The small 10.20 inch by 12.75 inch edition is priced at $199 and the larger 13 inch by 16.25 inch edition is priced at $299.",

      "text": "iPhone 7 Allegedly Burns Woman While Sleeping Woman who was allegedly burnt informed Apple about the incident Woman claims she fell asleep on the phone while it was charging Apple is reportedly yet to take action beyond offering a replacement \nAn Australian woman has alleged that she got severe burns due to a charging iPhone 7. The woman shared the experience in a Facebook post and claimed that her recently bought iPhone 7 was on charging while she fell asleep on it. \n\"I recently purchased an Apple iPhone 7 and accidentally fell asleep with my arm on my phone whilst it was charging. I was woken up by sudden pain, pins and needles, numbness and shortness of breath,\" Melanie Tan Pelaez wrote in her Facebook post . \nNotably, the reported incident occurred last month and Pelaez claims that she informed Apple's \"executive team\" through their website. Apple took the iPhone 7 for its internal testing though Pelaez is yet to hear anything from Apple. \nPelaez told Fairfax Media that she repeatedly wrote to Apple for taking some action in the case though received no response from the Cupertino-based company. The delay in response from Apple forced Pelaez to make the issue public. After the post became viral and was covered by media, Pelaez said Apple contacted her to find out how she was, but added that there were no answers that could be provided yet from the investigation. She added that Apple then offered a replacement phone, however, she refused one. \n\"I have been an iPhone user since the beginning and have never had an issue or concern, so it's really scary and disappointing that something like this happened and can happen to someone else,\" she added in her post. \nOf course, it is not very wise to cover an electronic device - especially when it is charging. Most such devices without active cooling systems like fans are designed to radiate heat into the atmosphere. Also, prolonged exposure to even 'warm' devices can cause burns, making the entire case just an example of what not to do with a charging smartphone. Apple on its own iPhone user guide, in the Important safety information section, notes that sleeping or sitting on iPhone that's in use or charging, or on the Lightning to USB Cable while it is plugged into a power source. \nThis is not the first case where a user has received burns because of iPhone. Earlier this year, a man in New South Wales reportedly sustained severe burns when his iPhone 6 exploded in his back pocket. The burn was so severe that he had to undergo skin graft surgery. In 2014, an eighth-grade student in the US received burn injuries when her iPhone blew and caught fire in her back pocket while she was in her school classroom. \nTo be noted is that these incidents have been isolated, and no conclusive evidence has been provided that show the devices themselves to be at fault. Lithium ion batteries, the most ubiquitous sources of power for portable devices, are certainly not the safest technology. While there are usually multiple fail-safes built in, these batteries have been known to explosively discharge if they malfunction, are misused, or disposed off incorrectly. While the recently reported incident of the Australian woman sustaining burns is not directly attributable to the battery on the iPhone 7, it just serves to highlight that care must always be taken to handle modern electronic devices in manner recommended by the manufacturer.",

      "title": "Discussing design with the man behind your iPhone",
      "text": "Photography Discussing design with the man behind your iPhone Apple’s Chief Design Officer Jony Ive discusses simplicity, Steve Jobs and the company’s new tome ‘Designed by Apple in California’ – peek inside the book here Designed by Apple in California \nThere are very few companies – and certainly none at the scale of Apple for whom design and specifically the culture of design – is such a central tenet of their modus operandi. It’s almost ridiculous to think it’s only been in the short space of 20 years that Apple has revolutionised our lives with its products, fundamentally changing the way we relate to each other and the world around us through their design, function and form. \nAs the chief architect of a product’s future life, Jony Ive has had the role and responsibility of shaping ours since joining the company in 1992. When I was invited to visit the fiercely guarded inner sanctum of the design studio at Infinite Loop in Cupertino for a personal tour by Ive’s right-hand Richard Howarth, I was shocked by the maker culture that existed among the 18 or so designers that shared this convivial, industrial workshop. It was all about the handmade, the crafting, the rapid prototyping of design ideas. \nDesigned by Apple in California is a 450-page visualisation of the output of this studio. Lensed by photographer Andrew Zuckerman, and exquisitely printed on the finest bespoke paper, it is an inspired study of the studio’s output. We witness the evolution of product design, the acceleration of engineering, the inevitable natural selection of materials, the rise of dominant hierarchies of form and technologies as the book unfolds as both a deconstruction and reconstruction of Ive’s own creation mythology; the bringing a sense of order to that which was once chaotic and complex. Alongside the insides and outsides of the products themselves we witness the tools that go into their making; it’s a deliberate attempt to show that design is in every aspect of the process – even in designing the tools that design the tools that design the products. \nThe product descriptions read like concrete poetry, engineering haiku that deftly express the fanatical level of specificity that makes the design process at Apple so legendary. It’s a way of thinking that Ive (who dedicates the book to Steve Jobs) attests to in his introductory text: “I believe that human beings sense care in the same way as we sense carelessness. We sense the people behind the products, people who do more than just make something work, people who care about the smallest unseen details, as well as the big idea, the primary function.” \nRead our interview with Jony Ive below and see an exclusive behind-the-scenes film as well. \nWhy a book, and why now? \nJony Ive: We started the project about eight years ago, with the feeling that we had a responsibility to try and create an archive of what we’ve done. Honestly, it felt more of an obligation than something that we felt really compelled to do. The reason for that, and I guess it’s a fairly obvious one, is that as designers, we are far more interested in and consumed by the future; in what doesn’t exist yet. But we’ve been working together for 20, 25 years, and it felt like the right and appropriate thing to do. You get a sense of what we’ve learned as a team and of how technology is evolving. \nIn the introduction, you talk about always striving to create something simple – could you define your concept of simplicity? \nJony Ive: What we try to do is get to a point where it seems almost undesigned, where it seems so obvious that an alternative would seem contrived and not rational. To get to that point of that ‘perceived inevitability’ is extremely difficult. I think that it’s very easy to make something appear simple; some objects have simplicity as a style, but nothing simple about how they function and how they were conceived in their core architecture. We sense the intrinsic simplicity of an object that starts with the core architecture of the object and the outworking of that. One of our jobs is to try and bring some order to what is chaotic and complex. If you just enforce an aesthetic style onto something, very often you are aware of the designer wagging their tail in your face. I think that it’s the designer’s job to try and solve problems that in their resolution do not allow complexity to become apparent. I think that’s really important. \nYour title at Apple is Chief Design Officer but you also oversee human interface. What does that actually mean? \nJony Ive: I built the industrial design team and that’s been something I’ve done over the last 25 years, but more recently I was asked to help form and lead the human interface design team. That’s a team, it’s clearly not a discipline and practice, which has been a significant part of my past, and I think that there’s the contribution I can make. I’m very aware of the extent of the contribution but what I’ve enjoyed doing and I hope, with a degree of success, has been to build a team that has a strong culture of design. \n“It’s the designer’s job to try and solve problems that in their resolution do not allow complexity to become apparent” – Jony Ive \nA defining characteristic of myself is a hunger to learn, and being hopelessly inquisitive. I think one of the things that is particularly unusual, that many people would say what is actually unique about Apple, is that it has decades and decades of experience and has really defined a culture of both hardware and software. Ultimately we are able to develop hardware and software together to create a singular experience – the iPhone was only possible because of developing hardware and software together. The scariest thing is how a very fragile idea, a very vulnerable idea can become an incredibly powerful, influential and profound product. There were multiple stages while we were working on the phone when solving problems wasn’t inevitable and we really did have concerns that it wasn’t viable, that it wasn’t going to work. \nI’ve read interviews with you where you talked about dialling people with your ear because you couldn’t figure out the interface for the multi-touch. \nJony Ive: For a period of time it seemed that as a product that you pushed up against your ear and face there was a fundamental flaw in the thinking of the product. I think what we found on so many occasions, the only way we can solve the problem is (remembering that) we can’t just rely on hardware and we can’t just rely on software. It’s being able to design and combine and develop them both concurrently. Designed by Apple in California Photography Andrew Zuckerman, courtesy of Apple \nIn the book you really feel the evolutionary jumps – the thinner forms, single extrusions, designs becoming smaller, finer – and then you get the pencil at the end, which is almost like an exclamation mark. The pencil is such an intuitive design object to work with. You’ve used this phrase before I think, ‘strangely familiar’ – it feels so strangely familiar to me when I use it. \nJony Ive: It’s so funny that you used that phrase. Yes I think it’s one of the contributions that design can make, that some physical objects that mark the future can have an ability to seem oddly familiar. \nConversely it feels that with the rate of change in technology, so much more is possible. Do you feel like things are moving too slowly or too quickly in the evolution of material design and technology? \nJony Ive: The problem becomes that things move at different rates. You can have certain technologies which move with such a velocity, that to harness their capability and to turn that performance into something compelling and relevant could mean development in other technologies at a similar rate. My frustration is that they don’t. \nThere can be completely disproportional efforts that are required that make one step forward in one area and require the most extraordinary focus and effort and investment to make what may appear a relatively incremental improvement. Then you can have other areas where there could be extraordinary progress, but yes I think the challenge is that things don’t all share a uniform velocity in their development. \nWhat we have noticed is that there is an increasing appetite. Over the last ten years, I’ve seen an increasing appetite for the new. And what’s sometimes said is that it might not be for something better, just for something new and different. New and different is actually really very easy. We could create something new and different this afternoon, but to actually do something that is materially better is very hard. \n“It’s not a question of this being right, it’s just a question of when it’s right” – Jony Ive \nThe book is dedicated to Steve Jobs – are there any enduring principles that he taught you, that you hope to carry on in the work you do at Apple and pass on to others? \nJony Ive: Somehow it even transcends principle. It’s how we worked together. It’s an entire approach, an entire attitude towards the work. I think it was the all-consuming nature of it being about the product. It begins and ends with the product and if your absolute and complete focus is sincerely to try and make the very best product, then all of the other issues tend to resolve themselves. Steve was an extraordinary man. We got to work together every day for hours and hours. \nDo you still feel like you’re designing the products that you and Steve talked and dreamed about? \nJony Ive: That’s a really good point. It actually goes back to what I was saying earlier – there’s an unseen part of the discipline which is, ‘Okay look there’s a technology here that has this affordance that means we could do this, but we can’t yet because we need technology A, B and C, or we need this new material that doesn’t exist right now’. So we put things to one side, knowing that at some point we will carry on working on them again. There are things that we would partially prototype, that we couldn’t complete. It’s not a question of this being right, it’s just a question of when it’s right. Designed by Apple in California Photography Andrew Zuckerman, courtesy of Apple \nWhat relaxes Jony Ive? When you’re not dreaming of our future. \nJony Ive: I think I go and get a nice cup of tea, put a record on and sit down. There’s a luxury and an indulgence to that. \nVinyl, CD or MP3? \nJony Ive: Vinyl. \nIn the introduction, you don’t use the word ‘emotion’. You used ‘care’ a lot, but not emotion – was that on purpose? \nJony Ive : That was deliberate. I think the issue with designing things to elicit an emotional response, is that it can slip into contrivance very quickly. \nArrogance maybe? \nJony Ive: I think so. I certainly think that your emotional response to what we’ve done is a consequence, and it’s for us to define. In the same way a lot of people have said, our products are iconic. That’s not for us to say. Sometimes a product assumes a sort of cultural significance and describing them as iconic is understandable and accurate in some ways, but it’s not something we could say. In the same way, we don’t design to elicit an emotion, but I hope that people develop a relationship with the products that is substantially emotional. But I never feel comfortable saying that we are designing emotional objects. \nWhose iPhone is it on page 135? The one that you’ve had photographed after ‘years of abuse’. \nJony Ive: That’s Evan Hanke’s iPhone, one of the designers in the studio. Isn’t it cool? She destroys her objects. But I thought there was something so charming about that. I thought it was lovely to put that in. \nDesigned by Apple in California is available in two sizes and printed on specially milled, custom-dyed paper with gilded matte silver edges, using eight color separations and low-ghost ink. This linen-bound, hardcover volume was developed over an eight-year period. It is published by Apple. Designed by Apple in California Courtesy of Apple  ",

      "text": "Reddit \nApple’s new ‘TV’ app has begun rolling out to Apple TV owners in the USA. Apple explained last month that the app is intended to bring together shows from multiple TV apps into a single view. “Using apps on Apple TV, iPhone and iPad has become the primary way for so many of us to watch television,” said Eddy Cue, Apple’s senior vice president of Internet Software and Services. “The TV app shows you what to watch next and easily discover TV shows and movies from many apps in a single place.” \nSeveral readers have reported seeing the app appear … \nReader Tyler made the reports in the comments to a tvOS 10.1 developer beta 3 post yesterday. The TV app just appeared on my Apple TV. You can change the function of the tv button to take you to the TV app or to the home screen in settings under remotes and devices […] I noticed it about 20 minutes ago, it appeared before I updated to beta 3 […] The TV app now appears on beta 2 and beta 3. \nThe rollout appears to be a gradual one, with some reporting it while others are still not seeing it after updating to the latest beta. Tweets are also appearing showing photos. \nOn the iPhone and iPad, Apple appears to be introducing the TV app as a replacement for the built-in Videos app. The old Videos app is seemingly hidden as the new TV app replaces it. It will work with the upcoming single sign-on feature for access to your subscription channels.",

      "text": "PRESS RELEASE November 15, 2016 “Designed by Apple in California” chronicles 20 years of Apple design New Photo Book Tells the Story of Design at Apple Get a closer look at two decades of Apple innovation in this detailed photo archive. Cupertino, California — Apple today announced the release of a new hardbound book chronicling 20 years of Apple’s design, expressed through 450 photographs of past and current Apple products. “Designed by Apple in California,” which covers products from 1998’s iMac to 2015’s Apple Pencil, also documents the materials and techniques used by Apple’s design team over two decades of innovation. The book is dedicated to the memory of Steve Jobs. Dedicated to the memory of Steve Jobs, the book illustrates Apple’s creative inspiration and thinking. “The idea of genuinely trying to make something great for humanity was Steve’s motivation from the beginning, and it remains both our ideal and our goal as Apple looks to the future,” said Jony Ive, Apple’s chief design officer. “This archive is intended to be a gentle gathering of many of the products the team has designed over the years. We hope it brings some understanding to how and why they exist, while serving as a resource for students of all design disciplines.” “Designed by Apple in California” examines 20 years of work by Apple’s design team. The products in this book are the result of a profoundly close collaboration between many different groups. Shot by photographer Andrew Zuckerman in a deliberately spare style, the book’s 450 images illustrate Apple’s design process as well as its finished products. The book features 450 photographs of Apple products, from 1998’s iMac to 2015’s Apple Pencil. In the book’s foreword, Ive explains: While this is a design book, it is not about the design team, the creative process or product development. It is an objective representation of our work that, ironically, describes who we are. It describes how we work, our values, our preoccupations and our goals. We have always hoped to be defined by what we do rather than by what we say. We strive, with varying degrees of success, to define objects that appear effortless. Objects that appear so simple, coherent and inevitable that there could be no rational alternative. The hardbound book was designed and published by Apple and is available in two sizes. “Designed by Apple in California” is available in two sizes and printed on specially milled, custom-dyed paper with gilded matte silver edges, using eight color separations and low-ghost ink.

      "text": "Want Apple’s Touch Bar without buying a new MacBook Pro? Get Red Sweater’s Touché A free app can be used to simulate on your Mac’s screen the new Touch Bar. Senior Editor, Macworld Nov 15, 2016 4:32 AM \nThe new MacBook Pro’s Touch Bar is, as Macworld’s Susie Ochs puts in the video of her review , “pretty slick.” But you don’t have to shell out any money to get a Touch Bar on your Mac. Red Sweater’s Touché is a free app ( donations accepted ) that simulates the Touch Bar on your Mac’s screen. \nTouché setings. \nBefore you install Touché, you need to have you Mac updated to macOS Sierra 10.12.1. Now, it has to be a specific build of macOS 10.12.1, the build with Touch Bar support, which is build 16B2657. I tried to install Touché on a 2014 15-inch MacBook Pro running 10.12.1, but it wasn’t that specific build and it didn’t run. Fortunately, you can download the update and install it . \nTouché runs like any app, and you can use a keyboard shortcut to toggle it on or off the screen. Touché will show the controls for any app written with Touch Bar controls, which means that right now, only a few Apple apps work. \nFor example, if you use Touché with Photos, you can access the Touch Bar controls, as you can see in the video clip below. \nIf you press the fn key on your Mac keyboard, Touché, like the Touch Bar, displays the functions keys (as shown below). \nWhen you use Touché with Messages, you get quick access to emoji. \nYou probably won’t use Touch Bar are a regular user-interface utility. When it’s on-screen, it duplicates controls that are already found on the apps you are using. Mostly, Touché is a tool for software developers, but it can also be used by anyone considering a new MacBook Pro—it gives an idea of how you might use the Touch Bar. It’s also a great way to show the Touch Bar graphically, since you can take screenshots instad of taking pictures with a camera. Related:",

      "text": "Apple aficionados and design nerds alike, adjust your holiday wish lists and set your reminders!\nApple has just announced a new book, titled 'Designed by Apple in California', that highlights 20 years of Apple product design, all in memory of their late co-founder and CEO, Steve Jobs.\n\"The idea of genuinely trying to make something great for humanity was Steve's motivation from the beginning, and it remains both our ideal and our goal as Apple looks to the future,\" said Jony Ive, Apple's chief design officer. \"This archive is intended to be a gentle gathering of many of the products the team has designed over the years. We hope it brings some understanding to how and why they exist, while serving as a resource for students of all design disciplines.\"\nPhotographed by Andrew Zuckerman, the book contains 450 pages covering process and final product for everything from the 1998 iMac to the 2015 Apple Pencil.\n\n\n\n\nWhile this is a design book, it is not about the design team, the creative process or product development. It is an objective representation of our work that, ironically, describes who we are. It describes how we work, our values, our preoccupations and our goals. We have always hoped to be defined by what we do rather than by what we say.\nWe strive, with varying degrees of success, to define objects that appear effortless. Objects that appear so simple, coherent and inevitable that there could be no rational alternative.\nIt's available from Apple.com starting tomorrow in two sizes: small for $199 and large (plus!) for $299.\n",

      "text": "Apple Announces Hardbound Photo Book 'Designed by Apple in California' Tuesday November 15, 2016 4:48 am PST by Mitchel Broussard Apple today announced the release of a new hardbound photo book, called \"Designed by Apple in California,\" that chronicles 20 years of Apple product designs through 450 photographs. The book ranges from the iMac in 1998 to the Apple Pencil in 2015, and \"also documents the materials and techniques used by Apple’s design team over two decades of innovation.\" It is dedicated in the memory of former Apple CEO Steve Jobs. The photographs in the book were shot by Andrew Zuckerman and are said to showcase each product's design process as well as its final form. Apple chief design officer, Jony Ive, gives the foreword for the book, explaining that its purpose is not to illustrate the success of Apple's design team, but to \"describe how we work, our values, our preoccupations, and our goals.\" “The idea of genuinely trying to make something great for humanity was Steve’s motivation from the beginning, and it remains both our ideal and our goal as Apple looks to the future,” said Jony Ive, Apple’s chief design officer. “This archive is intended to be a gentle gathering of many of the products the team has designed over the years. We hope it brings some understanding to how and why they exist, while serving as a resource for students of all design disciplines.” Apple developed the book over an eight-year period, paying close attention to its own design and look. Because of this, the linen-bound, hardcover book is printed on specially milled, custom-dyed paper with gilded matte silver edges, using eight color separations and low-ghost ink. It will be published by Apple itself, and only be available to purchase from the Cupertino company. \"Designed by Apple in California\" will go on sale tomorrow, November 16, in small (10.20\" x 12.75\") and large (13\" x 16.25\") sizes, running $199 and $299, respectively. Fans will be able to order the photo book from Apple.com in Australia, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, and the United States, as well as at select Apple retail stores across the world. You can check out more images of the book here .",

      "text": " 00 AM EST Designed by Apple in California Chronicles 20 Years of Apple Design Apple® today announced the release of a new hardbound book chronicling 20 years of Apple’s design, expressed through 450 photographs of past and current Apple products. Designed by Apple in California, which covers products from 1998’s iMac® to 2015’s Apple Pencil®, also documents the materials and techniques used by Apple’s design team over two decades of innovation. \nApple® today announced the release of a new hardbound book chronicling 20 years of Apple’s design, expressed through 450 photographs of past and current Apple products. Designed by Apple in California , which covers products from 1998’s iMac® to 2015’s Apple Pencil®, also documents the materials and techniques used by Apple’s design team over two decades of innovation. \nThe book is dedicated to the memory of Steve Jobs. \n“The idea of genuinely trying to make something great for humanity was Steve’s motivation from the beginning, and it remains both our ideal and our goal as Apple looks to the future,” said Jony Ive, Apple’s chief design officer. “This archive is intended to be a gentle gathering of many of the products the team has designed over the years. We hope it brings some understanding to how and why they exist, while serving as a resource for students of all design disciplines.” \nThe products in this book are the result of a profoundly close collaboration between many different groups. Shot by photographer Andrew Zuckerman in a deliberately spare style, the book’s 450 images illustrate Apple’s design process as well as its finished products. \nIn the book’s foreword, Ive explains: \nWhile this is a design book, it is not about the design team, the creative process, or product development. It is an objective representation of our work that, ironically, describes who we are. It describes how we work, our values, our preoccupations, and our goals. We have always hoped to be defined by what we do rather than by what we say. \nWe strive, with varying degrees of success, to define objects that appear effortless. Objects that appear so simple, coherent, and inevitable that there could be no rational alternative. \nDesigned by Apple in California is available in two sizes and printed on specially milled, custom-dyed paper with gilded matte silver edges, using eight color separations and low-ghost ink. This linen-bound, hardcover volume was developed over an eight-year period. It is published by Apple. \nPricing & Availability \nDesigned by Apple in California will be available beginning tomorrow, Wednesday, November 16, in small (10.20” x 12.75”) at $199 (US) and large (13” x 16.25”) at $299 (US) exclusively from Apple.com in Australia, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, the UK and the US, and select Apple Stores.* \nThe book is on display at the Apple Stores where it is sold. \n* Designed by Apple in California is available at the following Apple retail locations: Apple Regent Street and Apple Covent Garden in London; Apple Opera in Paris; Apple Kurfürstendamm in Berlin; Apple ifc mall and Apple Canton Road in Hong Kong; Apple Ginza in Tokyo; and Apple Sydney. \nIn the United States: Apple SoHo, Apple Fifth Avenue, Apple Upper East Side, Apple Williamsburg and Apple World Trade Center in New York; Apple The Grove in Los Angeles and Apple Third Street in Santa Monica; Apple North Michigan Avenue and Apple Lincoln Road in Chicago; Apple Northpark in Dallas; Apple Union Square in San Francisco; Apple Palo Alto and Apple Infinite Loop in Cupertino. \nApple revolutionized personal technology with the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984. Today, Apple leads the world in innovation with iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch and Apple TV. Apple’s four software platforms — iOS, macOS, watchOS and tvOS — provide seamless experiences across all Apple devices and empower people with breakthrough services including the App Store, Apple Music, Apple Pay and iCloud. Apple’s more than 100,000 employees are dedicated to making the best products on earth, and to leaving the world better than we found it. \nNOTE TO EDITORS: For additional information visit Apple’s PR website ( www.apple.com/pr ), or call Apple’s Media Helpline at (408) 974-2042. \n© 2016 Apple Inc.

      "text": "Apple Releases Hardbound ‘Designed by Apple in California’ Book Detailing 20 Years of Product Design Posted by Rajesh Pandey on Nov 15, 2016 | No Comments tweet \nApple today announced that it is releasing a new hardbound book detailing 20 years of its design. Titled “Designed by Apple in California,” the book will contain 450 different photographs of Apple’s past and current products. Apple says that the book is dedicated to the memory of Steve Jobs. \nThe photos range from the 1998’s iMac to the 2015 Apple Pencil. Additionally, it will detail the materials and techniques used by Apple’s design team for their various breakthrough in design innovation. \n“The idea of genuinely trying to make something great for humanity was Steve’s motivation from the beginning, and it remains both our ideal and our goal as Apple looks to the future,” said Jony Ive, Apple’s chief design officer. “This archive is intended to be a gentle gathering of many of the products the team has designed over the years. We hope it brings some understanding to how and why they exist, while serving as a resource for students of all design disciplines.” \nApple says that it has worked closely with different groups of people to make this photo book possible. This includes shots by photographer Andrew Zuckerman in a “deliberately spare style.” \nIn the book’s foreword, Ive says: \nWhile this is a design book, it is not about the design team, the creative process, or product development. It is an objective representation of our work that, ironically, describes who we are. It describes how we work, our values, our preoccupations, and our goals. We have always hoped to be defined by what we do rather than by what we say. \nWe strive, with varying degrees of success, to define objects that appear effortless. Objects that appear so simple, coherent, and inevitable that there could be no rational alternative. \nApple will be offering its “Designed by Apple in California” book in two sizes. The book will be printed on “specially milled, custom-dyed paper with gilded matte silver edges, using eight color separations and low-ghost ink.” Apple says that it has developed the linen-bound hardcover of the book over a period of eight years. \nThe book will be available exclusively through Apple’s online store and select Apple Stores from November 16 in Australia, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, the UK, and the United States. The small (10.20” x 12.75”) book is priced at $199, while the larger (13” x 16.25”) one is priced at $299.",
