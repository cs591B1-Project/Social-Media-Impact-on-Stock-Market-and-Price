      "text": "  11:54am CST | by M. Affan , in News | Cars & Vehicles McLaren’s shareholders rejected Apple’s bid to sell out The British automaker confirms their firm was in talks with Apple but did not reach any decision \nOn Friday McLaren’s CEO Mike Flewitt told Reuters they have turned down all offers of selling out to prospective buyers. According to Flewitt, the shareholders of the luxury sports car brand and the Formula One team are more committed to both of the businesses and will keep their stakes intact. How To: Find Nintendo NES Classic In Stock \nPreviously we heard Ron Dennis who used to head the McLaren Technology Group (MTG) was forced out of the position. The MTG is responsible for running the Grand Prix racing team. \nAccording to Sky News the move occurred after Dennis was in favor of a Chinese takeover while the investors were not. After making a name on the race tracks since 1963, the brand sourced into luxury cars in 2010 to rival the likes of Ferrari and Aston Martin. \nMcLaren’s three biggest shareholders include the Bahraini investment fund Mumtalakat, Ron Dennis and TAG. TAG is a company led by Saudi-born businessman Mansour Ojjeh. \nAccording to Flewitt there had been a number of bids but the shareholders are comfortable with where they are currently and want to retain ownership. The statement means Flewitt will have to work out with Dennis how to move forward with the brand name. \nFlewitt also revealed they did have talks with Apple but there was never a bid from the tech giant. The news that Apple was interested in McLaren first broke back in September. \nApple came and toured McLaren’s and both parties talked about the automakers work but there was no definitive proposition. \nAlthough McLaren’s is relatively new in the luxury car making industry and only just made their first car in 2011 they are rapidly growing. McLaren’s is also aiming to double their number of luxury hand-made models to over 3,000 by the end of this year. You May Like",

      "text": "  \nA five-second video circulating the internet has become a real headache for a lot of iPhone users. As demonstrated in a video from The Verge , the snippet causes iPhones to slow down and eventually freeze up. The issue affects devices running iOS 10.1 release, as well as those testing iOS 10.2 beta. \nThe MP4 video wreaking havoc on iPhones everywhere appears harmless enough. And devices even work as normal shortly after the video stops. But, like venom spreading through a person’s veins, handsets soon starts to slow down, until eventually freezing up altogether. \n“It appears that the video is corrupt, generating a loop that causes the iPhone to crash around 10 seconds after watching it,” The Verge said. “It appears to only crash devices when it’s sent as a link rather than simply transferred as a file.” \nAs the video demonstrates, the only way to bring an iPhone back to life is to perform a hard reset (hold down the power button and home button at the same time). Fortunately, iPhones appear to work normally after being rebooted, so it doesn’t sound like the video has any lasting effects. Be wary of unknown links \nNow that this bug is gaining widespread attention, hopefully Apple will roll out a fix sooner rather than later. This isn’t the first time a bug has rendered iPhones useless; last year, there was a particularly mischievous iMessage bug that Apple quickly patched. And who could forget about the infamous 1970 bug ? \nCheck out The Verge’s video below to see how this bug works. And be careful what you click on in messages.

      "text": "Apple creates website ‘teaser’ for Black Friday event INQUIRER.net / 08:55 PM November 22, 2016 It has been a while since Apple did a Black Friday sale, but 2016 could see a change in tone. Image INQUIRER.net \nWith the Black Friday shopping spree coming up soon, announcements of sales from different retailers and companies are starting to make their rounds. Apple unveiled a new website in anticipation of this great American sale, hinting possible discounts. \nThe company has mostly stayed out of Black Friday sales in the past recent years. They would often choose to let retail partners do the price slashing, reports 9T05Mac. \nOn the website are the words “Friday cant’ come soon enough” which is accentuated by an invitation to check out their products come Friday. It is unclear what this “one-day event” will be and what surprises Apple has in store. The last time they participated in Black Friday was in 2014. ADVERTISEMENT \nWhile product discounts are a possibility, the greater likelihood is the offering of gift cards and Apple Music promos. But who knows? A lot of surprising things have already happened this year, and what’s another one from Apple to cap things off? Alfred Bayle",

Patent number 9,504,170 was assigned to Apple for the patent titled Flexible Display Devices . When the phone is not in use, the screen folds up like a clamshell device thanks to a hinge that connects both halves of the screen. The hinge is designed to allow for a front-to front or back-to-back configuration.Apple will use flexible Printed Circuit Boards to connect the inner workings of the two halves. Rollers can be used to help reel in the screen or dispense it out while the hinge is in use. While Apple is expected to offer a premium 10th anniversary iPhone model next year with a flexible OLED display, the thinking is that Apple won't stray from the current design. If Apple does take a risk, it most likely would be with a glass display covering close to 100% of the phone's body. Touch ID would be embedded in the screen. Apple currently has a back up virtual home button on the Apple iPhone 7 and Apple iPhone 7 Plus that works the same way if the regular home button fails.Check out images directly from the USPTO's documentation.

      "text": "Like Us On Facebook Like Us On Facebook \nAlright, guys, I’m not going to make any promises, but by the looks of it, you might be able to score a cheap iPhone 7 on Black Friday this year. \nApple’s website has us convinced they’ve got some kind sale up their sleeve, but the company isn’t giving too many clues away yet. \nAll they’ve displayed so far is a picture of an Apple Watch on their homepage with Friday’s date in device’s screen. Underneath, it reads “Save the date.” \nWhat does that mean , Apple?! We can’t handle this kind of anticipation! \nTo tease us even more, they wrote a compelling note at the bottom right-hand corner of the page. It says, \nFriday can’t come soon enough. \nOur one-day shopping event will be here before you know it. Come back this Friday to check everyone off your list. \nUM… IS IT FRIDAY, YET? Giphy \nThis doesn’t happen often, so get pumped. \nIn fact, Apple hasn’t had a sale on Black Friday that included their devices in years, Time reports. \nApparently, the company has bundled iTunes gift cards with store purchases for Black Friday “sales” throughout previous holidays. \nHowever, Apple didn’t offer any Black Friday sales at all last year. \nBelieve me, it was a bummer. Giphy \nBut after a ratchet 2016, maybe they wanted to treat us with a little surprise. I can confidently say we all need a pick-me-up right now. \nAccording to Time, another potential reason behind Apple’s Black Friday special is to increase their sales around the holidays. \nIt’s been reported by CNBC Apple’s revenue has been declining for three consecutive quarters , and iPhone shipments allegedly fell by 5 percent. \nEven though there’s no solid evidence iPhones and Apple Watches will be included in their advertised Black Friday sale, we can only hope the ad is pointing us in the right direction. \nThere’s also no way of knowing whether the sale will be online or at Apple stores, but I guess we’ll have to wait until Friday to find out. \nSubscribe to Elite Daily's official newsletter, The Edge , for more stories you don't want to miss.

      "text": "Apple Inc. (AAPL) will offer discounts on some products and free two-day delivery on Black Friday. In an ad scant with details posted to its website (http://www.apple.com/shop/gifts/one-day-shopping-event)late Monday, the company announced a \"one-day shopping event\" for Friday, Nov. 25. Apple does not say what products will be included in the daily deals, but the photo on the ad specifically features Apple Watch, while links to other \"holiday gift collections\" range from devices to music and photography. It even offers a slew of games and toys, such as small plastic robots. It's unclear whether the iPhone 7 or iPhone 7S will be included, though the company has offered holiday deals on devices on past Black Friday events. Shares of Apple traded flat around $111.72 on Tuesday morning. They've risen 3% in the past three months, virtually in line with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA), but have underperformed on the year, declining by more than 6% while the index has increased by 6%.

Show More \nIn a novel approach these days, Apple is actually waiting until Black Friday, Nov. 25, until it reveals its Black Friday 2016 shopping deals. A slew of techie Black Friday deals have been touted by others, most of whom aren't waiting for the day after Thanksgiving. \nApple merely teases that \"Black Friday can't come soon enough\" and invites consumers to visit its shopping site on Friday . The promo page, which features an Apple Watch, does mention that there is free two-day delivery on in-stock items ordered by 5pm on Black Friday and that by downloading the Apple Store app you might be privy to early access on items. Note that at least some Apple stores will have extended shopping hours too. \nApple in recent years has ditched direct discounts on its products, and instead bundled gift cards with purchases, to keep future purchases in house. \nApple does lay out a splashy gift guide, divvied up by Apple gifts, music gifts, photography gifts and games/toys. \nMORE: 50-plus Eye-Popping Black Friday 2016 tech deals \nOutside of Apple, deals on its products from partnering retailers have been most plentiful on items such as iPads and iPhones (one series of tempting deals can be found on eBay via AllDayZip , which is selling unlocked iPhone 7 smartphones for between $30 and $50 off retail). Less so on Macs, aside from a few on sale at Best Buy (You can save $200 on an Apple MacBook Air 13.3\" model , for a final price of $800). A smattering of Apple Watch deals are available , too, including from new Apple Watch dealer Kohl's, which offers $105 in Kohl's cash for buyers of the Series 2 watch and $75 in Kohl's cash for buyers of the Series 1.

      "text": "Apple 's iOS software quality is being called into question again this week, following the discovery of a five-second video that will force an iPhone to lock up and freeze. Reddit users discovered the bug yesterday, and all an iPhone user needs to do is click an MP4 file and watch it to experience the problem. The Verge has tested the bug on multiple iPhones running the latest iOS 10.1 updates, and beta copies of iOS 10.2. All of our test phones locked up shortly after playing the video.\nIn our video demonstration of the bug above, you'll see that a link to the video, delivered via iMessage, will make iOS 10 play the file in the default player. It appears that the video is corrupt, generating a loop that causes the iPhone to crash around 10 seconds after watching it. We're not linking to the video for obvious reasons, but it appears to only crash devices when it's sent as a link rather than simply transferred as a file. The only way to recover from the crash is to hold the power button and home button at the same time to perform a hard reset. An iPhone will work as normal once it has rebooted this way.\n\nMore from The Verge:\nApple launches repair program for iPhone 6 Plus 'touch disease' flaw \nApple offers free battery replacements for some iPhone 6S handsets that keep shutting down \nApple won't make routers anymore \nThis isn't the first time that a crash bug has been discovered in iOS. Last year, a string of text disabled Apple's iMessage app on iPhones, and the company addressed the problem with iOS 8.4. Earlier this year, Safari started randomly crashing on iPhones due to a software issue that was quickly resolved. We've reached out to Apple to comment on the crash problem, and we'll update you accordingly. For now, be wary of any links to MP4 files that you receive from friends trying to prank you.",

      "title": "iPhones Are Crashing After Playing 3-Second Prank Video",
      "text": "iPhones are falling victim to a new type of crash bug that renders all of Apple's smartphones unusable after watching a short video. As The Guardian reports , It doesn't seem to matter which model of iPhone you use, watching the video will result in your smartphone grinding to a halt in less than a minute. The older the iPhone, the faster it happens.\nAnyone unaware of the crash bug will have no idea what has happened when their phone ceases to respond to input. They watch the video and carry on using the phone as normal. However, after 10 seconds or so the interface will start to become unresponsive and slow. This will get progressively worse until the phone stops responding completely.\nThe video below shows the crash in action on multiple iPhones:\n\nIt is believed the video is able to crash an iPhone due to the way in which iOS media handling functions deal with corrupt video. The slow crash is most likely down to the 3-second video from Chinese video sharing site Miaopai being corrupt, leading to a memory leak, which eventually overwhelms iOS.",

      "text": "\nThough Apple has had a lukewarm (to say the least) relationship with Black Friday, it looks like the company plans to inject themselves into the shopping frenzy for this year's round. As Fortune notes, Apple has just created a new website in anticipation of potential Black Friday deals. The site is more of a teaser than an actual breakdown of savings, but it does look like Apple fans have reason to be hopeful come Friday. For Apple's approach to Black Friday, the company will host a one-day-only event for online and brick and mortar retailers, though the specifics are currently unknown.\nYou can check out Apple's current website for its Black Friday event here , and stay tuned as more details become available.\nClick here to view full gallery at Hypebeast.com \n\n",

      "text": "Apple tonight updated its website with a brand new page teasing a one-day Black Friday shopping event. Apple didn't offer Black Friday deals last year, opting to allow third-party retailers like Best Buy and Target to offer deals instead.\nFriday can't come soon enough.\n\nOur one-day shopping event will be here before you know it. Come back this Friday to check off everyone on your list.\n\nLast year, Apple SVP of Retail Angela Ahrendts said the company was backing away from Black Friday promotions because \"being good to your employees will always be good for your business .\"\n\nOn its Black Friday website, Apple says that its one-day shopping event will include free shipping on in-stock items ordered by 5 PM. You'll also be able to take part in the event with the Apple Store app and in-store. Those interested in visiting an Apple retail store on Black Friday will need to check their local Apple store's extended holiday hours because there will not be uniform opening and closing times.\n\nApple has also provided easy links to four holiday gift collections curated by the company, including \"Apple gifts,\" \"Music gifts,\" \"Photography gifts\" and \"Games & Toys.\"\n\nIt's unclear what kind of Black Friday promotion the company will use this year. In the past, Apple has offered gift cards worth variable amounts with the purchase of Apple products. For instance, purchasing a Mac would yield a $100 gift card. However, in its European stores Apple has also opted for more traditional discounts.Related Roundup: Black Friday\n\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

If the teaser ends up not being as lucrative as a Best Buy, Target or other retail competitors, I will want to buy the MBA at one of those stores and NOT at Apple.\n\nWith that in mind, do these other retail stores sell AppleCare? Or can I wait and buy AppleCare at a later time?\n\nIf I can hold off on buying AppleCare for a few months, I will especially since it's retroactive. In theory, if something happens or is wrong with the MBA (not my fault), can I buy AppleCare right away and then schedule a Genius Bar appointment? ",

      "text": "Apple is well-known for raising the most ridiculous objections to content sold through its service. It has blocked apps in iTunes for simply mentioning an associated website (Bol.com), forbidden authors from mentioning Amazon, and blocked an app update because one of the screenshots contained the word \"Android\".\nNow, two more authors are caught up in Apple's petty editorial dictates.\nJason Schultz and Aaron Perzanowski's and Jason Schultz's new book The End of Ownership: Personal Property in the Digital Economy ( read an excerpt ) is available everywhere except iBooks, and it won't be available there until they agree to change their text to refer to the ebooks sold by Apple's as \"ebooks from iBooks\" rather than \"iBook.\"\nBooksellers are, and should remain, free to refuse to carry books. That editorial discretion is crucial to their own free speech interests. But how they exercise that discretion should give us cause for concern when the retailer controls a significant portion of the market. For the same reasons we should be troubled when Walmart refuses to sell certain books , we should worry about the implications of Apple's tight control over its marketplace. And since Apple is the only seller for iBooks, the problem is compounded.\nSo why did Apple decline to sell The End of Ownership ? The book is openly critical of Apple in a number of respects. We critique its embrace of DRM, its crackdown on independent repair, its complex and unreadable EULAs, its use of the deceptive Buy Now language to sell digital goods, and its commitment to hermetically-sealed business models.\nBut that criticism is not the reason Apple cited. Instead, the company pointed to its trademark policies. Apple noted passages in the book where we used the term \"iBook\" to refer to ebooks sold by Apple. But according to its iBooks Store Formatting Guidelines, Apple prefers the terms \"iBooks\" or \"iBooks Store\" be used to refer to its software ecosystem, and discourages the use of \"iBook\" to refer to ebooks sold using that platform.\nThe authors use the term \"iBook\" exactly three times in the 264-page book, but even once is apparently a travesty in the mind of Apple's censors.\nI wih I could express surprised that Apple went OCD over this term, but this frankly is not the first time I've herad about this type of nonsense.\nA friend of mine had to revise an ebook after Apple rejected it. His offense? He referred to the iBookstore, rather than the \"iBooks Store\".\nYes, Apple really is that obsessively petty.\nBoing Boing \nimage by Barry Borsboom \nYou just finished reading Apple Continues to be OCD Over Mentions of Its in eBooks which was published on The Digital Reader . If you liked what you read, how about joining the discussion? ",

      "text": "Apple Black Friday Sale 2016 Prepare Your Wallets and Patience For Apple's Black Friday Sale   Ann-Marie Alcántara 3 Shares \nLooking to get one of Apple's newest products? Then head straight to the Apple website on Black Friday , as the company just confirmed that it will hold a sale on Nov. 25. \nThe last time Apple had a Black Friday sale was two years ago and all the company offered were gift cards with purchases of certain products . But, judging by the image on the website and in the email sent out, the Apple Watch might end up on sale — and hopefully other products as well. \nAccording to the website, anything you order by 5 p.m. will receive free two-day delivery . If you buy an iPhone and it's in-stock, you'll receive free next-day delivery. Don't want to miss a single deal? Apple suggests downloading the Apple Store app. Or, you can also go to your nearest Apple store and buy the products in person. \nWe'll update when and if we find out any more specifics on deals but here's hoping Apple lowers the prices on everything — like its new MacBook Pro .

      "text": " Basket\nNew website and Apple and Android mobile applications now feature over 1 Billion current sales and in-store prices on over 900,000 grocery and everyday products nationwide\nARLINGTON, Va. Basket, a community of shoppers dedicated to never over paying for groceries again, today announced the launch of the Basket Shopping Platform. The launch includes brand new releases for its popular mobile applications on Apple iOS and Android as well as, for the first ever website to allow shoppers to search and compare local prices on all of their favorite products. The Basket Shopping Platform, powered by its community of shoppers, delivers on Basket's promise to be the shopping list that tells you where to shop by prioritizing total basket price calculations by store, enhanced map views of availability, and real time shopping list sharing for a more informed, collaborative shopping experience.\n\"Pricing transparency isn't a new idea, but it is for grocery,\" says Basket's founder and CEO Neil Kataria , \"If you look at house hunting, buying cars or booking travel, shoppers have all the relevant information at their fingertips before making their purchase. Billion dollar companies have been built around that kind of data. But now, for the first time ever, the Basket Shopping Platform is offering the same kind of comparison shopping and availability data to shoppers for grocery and everyday products.\"\nThe new features across both web and mobile applications include:\nLocal Product and Price Search Engine: For the first time ever, shoppers can search for products at offline retailers and compare those prices to other offline and online retailers to do a price check before they make their purchasing decisions. Total spend by store: By accessing and evaluating previously elusive offline and online prices, different comparisons, sales and product counts, Basket aggregates sales and coupons for users and shows the total price for everything in the user's basket. Enhanced map views: In addition to this unprecedented level of offline pricing transparency, the Basket applications now allows users see their shopping basket mapped out at all local stores. Not only can users view which nearby stores carry all the items on their shopping list, but also what the total price for that entire basket of goods will be at each store, allowing for easier prioritization of stores based on distance. Real time list sharing : Shoppers can now work together and share their shopping list in real time from within the Basket app. Whether shopping with their spouses, roommates, or co-workers, this allows multiple people to contribute and complete each shopping trip. \"As a single mother of a child with special needs who works long hours and is always on the go, Basket helps me save time and money by showing me where items on our weekly shopping list are the cheapest. I've used lots of apps but this the only one that gives me live pricing data based on location.\" said Cleo Blass of New Jersey , \"I love saving time and money for things that make me happy, and Basket let's me do that.\"\nThe release of the Basket Shopping Platform displays the latest advances in offline retail and continues to reinforce the way Basket is changing shopper expectations for both offline and online commerce. The Basket Shopping Platform, on which both the website and the Basket mobile apps are built, now has more than 900,000 unique products, 145,000 stores, and more than 10,000,000,000 historical prices shared by our community. Basket's exclusive and copious data empowers consumers to make the best decisions for their weekly shopping trips.\nBasket was founded by Neil Kataria , the founder of newBrandAnalytics (sold to Sprinklr) and early Waze employee Andy Ellwood , and is located in Arlington, Virginia . For more information or to download the Basket app: http://www.basketsavings.com\nAbout Basket:\nBasket ensures shoppers never overpay for groceries and everyday items again. Powered by our community, the Basket Shopping Platform searches hundreds of millions of products and prices at local and online stores to bring pricing transparency to every shopping list.\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20161121/441954\nLogo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20161121/441951LOGO\n releases/basket-launches-revolutionary-shopping-platform-to-empower-grocery-shoppers-with-best-values-and-pricing-transparency-300367320.html\n ",

      "text": "Apple's \"Bedtime\" option on iOS devices helps you keep a sleep schedule and tracks how many hour of sleep you get each night. You can set it up for use in just a couple of minutes. Steps 1 Open the Clock app. You can find this on your home screen. Select the \"Bedtime\" tab. It's the third tab from the left at the bottom of the screen. 2 Review the screen with information describing what bedtime is. Press on “Get Started.” 3 Set what time you would like to wake up. Scroll through the hours and minutes and select \"AM\" or \"PM\" to determine if you want your alarm to go off during the day or in the morning. Set your time. Then press “Next.” 4 Set the days you would like the alarm to go off. Then press “Next.” 5 Choose how many hours of sleep you need each night. Most adults need between 7 and 8 hours of sleep. Press “Next” when you've chosen how many hours of sleep you need. 6 Set a bedtime reminder if desired. Choose either at bedtime, 15 minutes before, 30 minutes before, 45 minutes before, or an hour before. Press “Next” when done. 7 Choose the song you would like to hear when you wake up. Then press “Next.” 8 Press “Save” your information. This allows the Apple device can track how many hours you sleep and record the data in the Health App. 9 Scroll down until you see a “Sleep Analysis” heading. Click on that. That will redirect you to the Health App. In there you will find your recorded data. 10 If you need more information, click on the bars on the Health App. It will show you all your recorded data which has what time you went to sleep and what time you woke up at.

      "text": "You are using an outdated browser. Please upgrade your browser to improve your experience. Cord Cutters Have Another Great Choice with PlayStation Vue on the Apple TV A full-featured streaming service by Brent Dirks November 22, 2016 \nWhile previously available for the iPhone and iPad, Sony’s PlayStation Vue streaming TV service landed for the fourth-generation Apple TV last week . Like Sling TV, PlayStation Vue offers a number of live TV channels on the streaming device. Here’s a rundown of what to expect. Welcome home The home screen is a great starting point. After starting up the app, the handy home screen features what your currently watching, recently watched shows, live TV, your saved shows, and featured content. As a nice touch, each family member can create their own profile for a more personalized viewing experience. A traditional guide A guided tour. For those viewers who enjoy a more traditional TV browsing experience, there is a detailed guide that shows upcoming and previous shows from all of your available channels. It's easy to navigate using the touchpad on the Siri Remote. A cloud DVR One of the best features. Instead of a traditional DVR, PlayStation Vue takes a different approach. You can save any program to your My Shows section. Once added, it will save any episodes of the program for 28 days. Wrap-up \nAlong with the Apple TV, you can access PlayStation Vue on an iPhone or iPad with the free, universal app . It’s also available on a Mac or PC. \nMonthly subscriptions start at $29.99 or $39.99 in cities with major live local broadcast stations – New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia, Dallas, San Francisco, and Miami. \nAnyone interested can head to the PlayStation Vue site to look at a list of all the available plans . The top-of-the-line package featuring all 90 channels plus premium content from HBO and Showtime is $74.99 per month. Football fans can also add NFL RedZone for extra. You can sign-up for a free, seven-day trial to start. \nI’ve been using the streaming service for the past few days and have come away extremely impressed. The Apple TV app is well designed and easy to navigate. Add in the cloud DVR feature, and its a true replacement for the cable company – especially if local channels are available in your area. \nDownload the app now",

Post to Facebook Apple CEO Cook called Trump after election Is there a thaw in President-elect Donald Trump's contentious relationship with Apple?  //usat.ly/2fOV8NA   Apple CEO Cook called Trump after election Jon Swartz , USA TODAY 3:07 p.m. EST November 22, 2016 Donald J. Trump (Photo: Charles Rex Arbogast, AP) \nSAN FRANCISCO — Is there a thaw in President-elect Donald Trump's contentious relationship with Apple? \nApple CEO Tim Cook called to congratulate his stunning election victory, Trump said in a meeting with the New York Times today. \nApple could not immediately be reached for comment. \nTrump's disclosure comes days after a report by financial magazine Nikkei Asian Review that Apple asked Asian-based manufacturers Foxconnand Pegatron in June to explore the possibility of manufacturing the popular smartphone in the U.S. The report cited unnamed people familiar with the matter. Report: Apple considering making iPhones in U.S. \nCook, who hosted a fundraiser for Hillary Clinton this summer, and his company have been a frequent target of Trump. \nTrump called for a boycott of Apple when it didn't cave to the FBI's request to hack the iPhone of one of the San Bernardino, Calif., shooters. He chided Apple and others to make hardware in the U.S. instead of China to make \"America first.\" And he threatened the Cupertino, Calif.-based company with taxes on imports from China, where some iPhones and other products are made. Trump's vague plans could reverberate in tech \n“We’re going to get Apple to build their damn computers and things in this country instead of in other countries,” then-candidate Trump told a crowd a Liberty University in Lynchburg, Va., in January. \nFollowing Trump's election Cook, who has been outspoken on a number of social issues, issued a memo to Apple employees about celebrating diversity in an apparent rebuke to Trump's incendiary comments on immigration, the Muslim community, women and other groups. \nFollow USA TODAY San Francisco Bureau Chief Jon Swartz @jswartz on Twitter.

      "text": "| Follow About | \nEye On Apple covers the latest hot news stories, rumors and illuminating discussions about Apple and its products. Product coverage includes Apple Watch, Mac, iPhone, iPad, Apple Pay, Apple TV. Opinion Stupid people and iPhone selfie deaths The iPhone is a fantastic tool, but caution and common sense are in order if you are going to use it to take selfies in exotic locations or potentially dangerous situations. CIO | Nov 22, 2016 9:11 AM PT Email a friend Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry 10 tablets for under $500 \nSometimes you really just have to stand back in awe of the dumb things people do with their iPhones. It never ceases to amaze me when I find out that somebody somewhere has come up with a new and amazingly foolish way of using the iPhone’s camera technology. \nSo imagine the eye-rolling I did when I caught a recent story in the New York Post about people dying when trying to take selfies. The report did not specify which phones people were using, but the iPhone is one obvious tool given it’s popularity around the world. \nJoshua Rhett Miller reports for the New York Post: \nMore people are dying for the perfect selfie. \nA new study – titled, “Me, Myself and My Killfie: Characterizing and Preventing Selfie Deaths” – found that 127 people have died in a 29-month span through last September while trying to get photos of themselves at dangerous or exotic locations. \nThe most common factor behind the so-called “selfie deaths” – defined as a death of an individual or group that could have been avoided had the individual(s) not been taking a selfie – was a fall from an elevated location like buildings or mountains. Deaths involving both elevation and water were next, followed by fatalities involving trains, according to researchers from Carnegie Mellon University in Pennsylvania and two colleges in India. \nResearchers found a total of eight factors behind the deaths, including weapons, vehicles, electricity and animals. The earliest reference to a selfie-involved death was published in March 2014, they found. Since then, a total of 15 deaths were tallied in 2014, followed by 39 last year and 73 deaths through September in 2016, according to the study. \nMore at The New York Post Deaths in Yellowstone National Park \nI suppose that none of this should have surprised me, given how people often do dumb and dangerous things for photos and other reasons. For example, I read an interesting book a while back called “ Death in Yellowstone: Accidents and Foolhardiness in the First National Park .” \nI was shocked at the sheer number of deaths that have occurred in Yellowstone over the years (going all the way back to the very beginning of the park), and the reasons for those deaths. \nEverything from one woman who died trying to get a better photo (this was back before smartphones even existed) by backing up until she fell 400 feet to her death, to people who just can’t resist trying to get close to grouchy bison, to a guy who dove head first into a 200 degree hot spring to save a dog then died himself shortly afterward (and he did it despite people telling him that the pool was dangerous before he dove in). \nThe rangers at the park try their best to make people aware of the dangers, but many visitors either don’t pay attention to them or they simply choose to ignore the rangers, often with fatal consequences. There’s not much the rangers can do, our national parks are not petting zoos or places to walk around with your head in the clouds. \nI can only imagine the stupidity occurring in our national parks now that everybody has a camera in their pocket thanks to smartphones. I would certainly not want to be in the shoes of a ranger trying to inform people about the dangers of the parks as the dingbat visitors ignore them while checking their Facebook and Twitter feeds. \nOne woman was recently gored by a bison while trying to take the perfect selfie by getting too close to the animal. I wonder if that photo was really worth getting attacked by a critter that can weigh up to a ton and who can easily toss an adult human being up into the air with its horns? Selfie deaths and social media \nOne of the biggest reasons why people expose themselves to danger when taking selfies is the desire to gain attention or approval on social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, etc. These narcissists want to outshine their friends or family, or create an adventurous image of themselves by posting selfies of them in exotic places or dangerous situations. \nIn some ways it reminds me of Timothy Treadwell and Steve Irwin . Those guys were doing the same sort of thing for television, they got very close to brown bears and other wildlife and it all went well until it didn’t, and they both died. \nI wrote a blog post about Timothy Treadwell back in 2003 and it still gets traffic. People seem fascinated by other human beings that put themselves at risk of injury and death to get a photo or video, and that interest continues to this very day. \nThe social media addicts who take dangerous selfies are really following in the footsteps of Treadwell and Irwin (albeit for a different medium), and some of them have paid the same price by dying to capture a photo or video. \nCheck out this long list of selfie deaths for some examples of this phenomenon from around the world. The big standout for me was the chinese guy who was drowned by a walrus while trying to take selfies with the critter. Drowned by a walrus? What a way to go, sheesh! Selfie deaths are just a new manifestation of a timeless problem \nThe situation we’re seeing now with selfie deaths via smartphones like the iPhone is really nothing new. It’s just a new manifestation of an age old problem with human beings. Sometimes we just don’t use our common sense and in not doing so we set ourselves up for serious injury or death. \nAs much as I hate to say it, get used to reading about selfie deaths. They aren’t going to stop or go away. You can’t protect people from themselves, no matter how hard you try, and my guess is that we’ll see an increase in these kinds of deaths as people try to outdo each other with their selfies. \nYes, that’s a rather grim way of looking at selfie deaths, but it’s also quite realistic based on patterns of human behavior throughout our history. There are always going to be people that do stupid things in dangerous places and situations in order to show off to their family or friends. \nSelfies are just a new reason for people to die. \nDid you miss a post?

Contents Gameplay [ edit ] \nThe players are at a conveyor with apples and Bob-ombs . They must either press a button, or not press it. If they do, the conveyor will move forward on their behalf and vice versa. The players will either receive an apple (which is one point), triple apples (which is three points), or Bob-ombs (which deducts one point). Once the screen reads \"0\", the players will get whatever they have in front of them. After 7 rounds, the player that has the most points wins the minigame. \nThis minigame has a Reverse Minigame variation. Here, the player with the lowest score wins and earns 20 Mini Stars . \nNormal: \"Vote to go with or to stop with \nReverse: \"Rules are reversed! Aim for last place!\" Names in other languages [ edit ] Language Pun with \"Apple's play\" and \"Palm's game\" (French name of \"Real Tennis\") Portuguese Minigames from Mario Party 10 Free-for-All minigames Balance Ball Brawl • Balloon Blast Bash • Beeline Shrine • Blooper Blast-Off • Bob-omb Bogey • Bob-omb Combo • Bouncy Brawl • Cheep Cheep Leap • Cliffside Crisis • Dice 'n' Dash • Flash Forward • Foo Me Once • Found it?

      "text": "Apple announces a one-day sale for Black Friday That's just about all that's known, though, until the sale is unveiled on Friday, November 25. Executive Editor,  50   There was an error emailing this page. Credit: Apple MacBook Pro review: The Touch Bar bridges the gap between iPad and Mac \nApple doesn’t always get in on Black Friday, the unofficial shopping holiday the day after Thanksgiving. In some previous years, the company has offered modest discounts on some products, or a free gift card with purchase, but last year the company sat Black Friday out all together. \nThis year, Apple’s in. The company announced a “one-day shopping event” with a teaser on its website . We just don’t know much else. \nApple’s online store already suggests gift ideas for various people, like add-on iPhone lenses for photography buffs, microphones and instruments for musicians, and game controllers and high-tech toys for kids. So Apple could organize its sale by the people on your shopping list, or just help you find the perfect accessories for people who own iPhones, iPads, Macs, and Apple TV. \nAnd while buying from Apple is certainly convenient, don’t forget to shop around. Other retailers like Best Buy, Target, and Walmart use Apple products as “doorbusters,” offering deep discounts designed to get you in the store, where they hope you’ll go ahead and polish off the rest of your shopping list too. The problem with doorbusters, though, is that supplies are often constrained, so the Apple store will probably have more devices to sell even if the discount doesn’t wind up being as steep. \nApple is keeping mum about precisely what’s going on sale, and how much you stand to save, until the sale beings this Friday, November 25. We’ll have a listing of other stores’ Black Friday offers on Thursday, and follow up with Apple’s own sale on Friday. Happy Thanksgiving!  ",

      "title": "★ On Jony Ive’s Role at Apple",
      "text": "On Jony Ive’s Role at Apple Tuesday, 22 November 2016 \nAbdel Ibrahim, writing for AppAdvice : \nIn the latest episode of The Talk Show , John Gruber discusses with Six Colors founder, Jason Snell, about Jony Ive’s role in the company and how it’s changed in the years since Steve Jobs’ passing. He specifically makes mention that he’s heard that Ive’s role has changed in a way where he’s not as much involved in the design of physical hardware as he used to be. \nI’ve heard that he has lately been checked out or not as directly involved with product design and that he’s been largely focused on architecture, meaning the spaceship campus and the new stores. And that maybe the other top-level executive who’s been working the most with Ive is Angela Arhendts. \nThe comment comes on the back of Apple releasing a photo book called “Designed by Apple in California” in which the company looks back the last 20 years of products made under Ive and his design team. Many Apple fans see the book as part of Ive’s slow retirement from Apple, some who believe that Ive has been on his way out for a while now. \nThis is what I dislike most about podcasting. With everything I write here at DF, I aim for painstaking precision in my choice of words and phrasing. I try not only to make it easy for my meaning to be understood, but also difficult to be misconstrued. On a podcast, that’s not possible. I have no doubt Ibrahim transcribed my words accurately, but the above excerpt is not an accurate representation of what I tried to convey. I think if you listen to that part of the show , the surrounding context makes that clear. \nThere are definitely people who think Ive might be on his way out. There’s been speculation to that effect ever since his promotion last year to chief design officer and the coinciding promotions of Alan Dye and Richard Howarth to vice presidents of user interface design and industrial design, respectively. The company line is that this new arrangement allows Ive to spend less time on management, and more time directly on, well, design. The skeptic’s take is that this new arrangement allows Ive to be less involved, period, and that the chief design officer title is almost ceremonial. \nIve has also always been a bit of mystery man at Apple. There aren’t many people who work with him directly, and those few who do, don’t talk about it. Almost everything I’ve heard about Ive’s current role is second or third-hand. Nobody has said to me “ Jony Ive has checked out of day-to-day product design. ” What I have heard is from people who’ve said “ I think Jony Ive has checked out of day-to-day product design. ” There is a big difference between those two sentences. The first implies direct knowledge. The second is speculation. That’s what I tried to convey on The Talk Show last week. \nImportantly, I’ve also heard from well-placed sources within Apple that there is nothing to this — that while Ive is devoting much of his time and attention to architecture recently (both for the new campus and Apple retail), every aspect of every new product remains as much under his watchful eye as ever. That his chief design officer title isn’t the least bit ceremonial, and instead is an accurate representation of his increased authority. 1 Some of this I’d heard a while back. Some of this I’ve heard just in the last few days, in the wake of last week’s episode of the show and the ensuing misconstruing of my remarks . [2] \nThe Designed by Apple in California book is fascinating in this regard. It lets you see what you want to see. Steven Troughton-Smith expressed the “this is Ive’s swan song” side succinctly : \nThat it’s only the last 20 years says a lot — this is Ive’s portfolio, not Apple’s. My impression is that his career is drawing to a close. \nI’ll argue the other side: the existence of this book — not just what the book is about, but the extraordinary effort that went into creating and printing it — is evidence that Jony Ive is wholly in charge of product at Apple. Perhaps every bit as much as Steve Jobs was. If Jony Ive wants to make a $300 book of super-high-end product photography, Apple makes that book. (See also: last year’s $20,000 gold Apple Watches.) \nMaybe it’s just wishful thinking on my part, because I don’t want Ive to leave Apple. Confirmation bias can lead one to see what one wants to see. But if I had to bet, I’d bet he’s not going anywhere. Fundamentally I think Jony Ive loves Apple, feels a responsibility to the legacy of his collaboration with Steve Jobs, and that whatever aspirations he has for the remainder of his career, personally, they’re only possible at Apple. I think if you want to argue that Ive is one step out the door at Apple, you also have to argue that he’s one step out the door of being a designer. That doesn’t sound right to me. \nI see why some people think Designed by Apple in California could be Ive’s goodbye to Apple. But it feels to me like Ive’s heartfelt goodbye to his best friend and colleague, five years gone. I don’t think Jony Ive is going anywhere. \nI think if Jony Ive were to be slowly extricating himself from Apple, he could get a ceremonial title, but a C-level corporate officer doesn’t sound ceremonial at all. It would be irresponsible for a publicly-held corporation to claim to have a C-level executive who didn’t actually have C-level responsibilities — and Tim Cook is most certainly not an irresponsible man. It has never made sense to me why so many people took Ive’s promotion to chief design officer as a sign that he’s on the way out. Corporate governance is serious business, and the fact that Tim Cook would not play fast and loose with it is reason to take it at face value. ↩︎ \nWhen I first started seeing these “Gruber thinks Jony Ive is on his way out” stories, I was appalled. It felt like a punch to the gut, because it wasn’t what I meant to convey, and I realize how influential my word is in such regards. But perhaps it was worth it. It shook a few well-placed little birdies out of the tree, all of whom emphasized that Jony Ive is as connected to product design as ever. ↩︎︎ Previous:",

      "text": "0 \nWith just days to go before Black Friday, T-Mobile has announced a few more deals on top of the ones that it revealed last week . \nThe big addition is T-Mobile’s offer of a free flagship smartphone with trade-in. This weekend only, starting November 24, you can get a free flagship smartphone from Apple, Samsung, or LG when you trade in a device that you own in full. You’ll also need to put your new phone on a Simple Choice Unlimited or T-Mobile One plan. \nThe selection of free flagships includes the 32GB iPhone 7, 32GB iPhone 7 Plus, Samsung Galaxy S7, Samsung Galaxy S7 edge, and LG V20. Keep in mind that only select trade-ins will get you one of these flagships for free, though. For example, to get a free iPhone 7, you’ll need to trade in an iPhone 6s or newer, Galaxy S6 or newer, or LG V20 or G5. To get a free Galaxy S7 edge, you’ll need trade in an iPhone 7 Plus or LG V20. \nIf you’ve got an older phone, you can still trade it in, you’ll just need to pay some cash upfront. T-Mobile will also let you upgrade to an iPhone with more storage if you’re willing to pay a little extra. \nYou can find the full trade-in deals for the Apple phones here , the Samsung phones here , and the LG V20 here . \nT-Mobile is also giving out free money to customers that port in a number and take advantage of the above trade-in offer. Specifically, those customers will get a free $200 prepaid MasterCard gift card, up to 12 lines or $2,400. Customers that’d prefer to keep their phone when they switch to T-Mo will get $200 in bill credits spread out over 20 months. \nFinally, T-Mo has a gift for everyone. From today through November 26, everyone will get one hour of free Gogo inflight Wi-Fi on their smartphones. This offer is open to non-T-Mobile customers. \nAll of these offers are in addition to the Black Friday deals that T-Mobile announced last week . Those include a free Gear VR with the purchase of a Galaxy S7 or Galaxy S7 edge and discounts on various accessories. Source:",

(Reuters) Apple has confirmed that there is a flaw in its iPhone 6 Plus that makes the display unresponsive and has launched a new repair programme. The hardware malfunction called “touch disease” exhibits display flickering or multi-touch issues in iPhone 6 Plus after being dropped multiple times on a hard surface and then incurring further stress on the device.\n“If your iPhone 6 Plus is exhibiting the symptoms noted above, is in working order, and the screen is not cracked or broken, Apple or an Apple authorised service provider will repair your device for a manufacturer’s suggested service price of Rs 9,900,” Apple said in a statement.\nPricing offered by Apple authorised service providers may vary.\nApple will contact customers who may have paid for a service repair related to this issue either through Apple or an Apple authorised service provider to arrange reimbursement.\n“In case you are facing multi-touch issue, bring your iPhone 6 Plus to a participating Apple authorised service provider. Your iPhone will be examined prior to any service to verify that it is eligible for this programme and in working order. This programme only applies to iPhone 6 Plus,” the company added.",

      "text": "Getty \nLast fall, Apple Chief Design Officer Jony Ive was asked what he would do if he wasn't designing for Apple. \n\"If I wasn't doing this, I think I would just be drawing or making stuff for friends,\" Ive said during an interview with Charlie Rose. \"Maybe it would just be Christmas tree ornaments, I don't know.\" \nLast Sunday, London hotel Claridge's unveiled its annual Christmas tree installation.\nIt was designed by Ive.\nApple's official company bio says that Ive is \"responsible for all design at Apple, including the look and feel of Apple hardware, user interface, packaging, major architectural projects such as Apple Campus 2 and Apple’s retail stores, as well as new ideas and future initiatives.\" \nBut people who know the company well are starting to suggest that Ive has been taking more of a back-seat role, and may not even be deeply involved in product design anymore, which was where he made his biggest mark on the company. \n\"I've heard that he has lately been checked out or not as directly involved with product design and that he's been largely focused on architecture,\" Apple watcher John Gruber said to Jason Snell , former editor of Macworld, during a podcast last week. Ive is mostly working on the new retail stores and working closely with  head of retail Angela Ahrendts, Snell said he's heard. \n(Gruber later clarified  on his blog that he did not mean to imply Ive was on his way out, and that Apple sources have told him \" every aspect of every new product remains as much under his watchful eye as ever.\") \nGetty There isn't a whole lot of evidence one way or the other. But a new glossy book taking a look back at Ive's best designs is certainly stoking the speculation. \n\"Criticizing execs is unpopular, but Ive seems stretched thin, burnt out, and bored,\" Apple blogger Marco Arment tweeted . \"I’d love to see some fresh design leadership at Apple.\"\nThe history  Getty During Apple's meteoric rise from 2000 to 2011, Ive was at Steve Jobs' side the entire time. \nHe ran Apple's industrial design department, which was empowered to imagine products like the iPhone. Ive often gave concepts to Apple's engineering department, telling them to make the product design possible, which is counter to how industrial design works at other high tech firms. \nIve considered himself to be Jobs' closest friend, and he is still seen as a critical person for the company. His small 20-person design team designed every single one of Apple's iconic products for the last 15 years, from the iPod to the iPhone.\nIf Ive were to retire officially, it could certainly spook investors. \nAfter Jobs' death, it looked as if Ive had received even more responsibility at Apple. He expanded his role from strictly physical industrial design to digital user interface as well.\nThen, in the summer of 2015, Ive received a \"promotion\" to Chief Design Officer. The news was  announced in a British newspaper  on a bank holiday Monday .\nCook explained the move in a memo to employees, which was leaked and published on 9to5Mac :\n\"As Chief Design Officer, Jony will remain responsible for all of our design, focusing entirely on current design projects, new ideas and future initiatives. On July 1, he will hand off his day-to-day managerial responsibilities of ID and UI to Richard Howarth, our new vice president of Industrial Design, and Alan Dye, our new vice president of User Interface Design.\"\nWhen Ive left, his handpicked lab manager and right-hand man, Harper Alexander, left the group, too — he now does corporate recruiting for Apple. \nYoutube Embed:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/embed/IkskY9bL9Bk\nWidth: 640px\nHeight: 360px \nMany analysts, like Above Avalon's Neil Cybart, still believe that Ive is one of the most important people at the company. \"With Jony Ive positioned as overseer of Apple design, his influence on Apple's product direction cannot be overstated,\" he wrote earlier this month.\nBut earlier this spring, Apple's iPhone SE launched without a product explanation from Ive, as most previous Apple products received. And he kept a very low profile at the launch event — only one reporter who attended told us he saw Ive, while many others thought he wasn't there.\nIve did contribute voice-overs to the launch of the iPhone 7 and new MacBook Pro this fall. But as many have observed, he did more press, including two interviews, for his new book than he did Apple's latest products.\nIve is certainly keeping a much lower profile than he did before his promotion.\nImpossible to tell  Getty Despite his clear importance to the company and his role in Apple lore, the company does not list Ive as one of its six most highly compensated executives in SEC documents.\n(Those execs are CEO Tim Cook, CFO Luca Maestri, Ahrendts, online services SVP Eddy Cue, Hardware SP Dan Riccio, and general counsel Bruce Sewell.)\nThe last time Ive was listed on a SEC Form 4, which is required whenever an \"insider\" acquires or disposes of stock, was in 2009 . It said he owned 28,127 shares of Apple stock at the time. (There's been a 7-1 split since then.)\nSimply put, nobody outside Apple knows how much Jony Ive makes — even though we know what the rest of Apple's executive team makes. \nShareholders do not know what Ive makes. It could be massive — or he could already be collecting a nominal salary because he's effectively retired. It's impossible to tell. \nMaking it harder for investors to gain clarity on the situation, Ive has traditionally run a leak-free, extremely secretive ship. Even Snell and Gruber, with their inside Apple sources, realize there is only so much any given Apple employee would know, given that Ive's team has traditionally worked completely apart from the company, especially the software engineering departments. \n(Former Apple exec Scott Forstall, who developed iOS, could not get into Ive's lab with his senior vice president ID card, according to a biography of Ive .)\nThe team was small, at less than 20 members, although it has grown recently and now comprised user interface as well. Few people ever leave the group, although recently Daniel Coster, a long-time member, was wooed to GoPro. \nThis team sits together at lunch, and is fiercely loyal to each other. If anyone knows if Ive is no longer showing up to the shop very often, it's them, and they're not talking — to other Apple employees or the press.\n \nApple did not respond to a request for comment. \nThe future?  Getty Of course, Ive could just be heads down working on Apple's next big thing, the successor to the iPhone that will ensure the company remains the world's most admired for years to come. \nSnell suggests that the now seemingly back-burnered Apple Car was an Ive passion project. That's certainly plausible. One of the reported goals for the Apple Car project was always to retain top talent who might be bored working on incremental iPhone improvements.\nBut it's much harder to see Ive driving the development behind a pair of smart glasses, or augmented reality , like Apple is currently working on. \nIve told the New Yorker that the face \"was the wrong place\" for technology, for a long profile written in the fall of 2014 just before Apple unveiled the Apple Watch. Ive sounded tired: \n\"He was a few days from starting a three-week vacation, the longest of his career. The past year had been 'the most difficult' he’d experienced since joining Apple, he said later that day, explaining that the weariness I’d sometimes seen wasn’t typical. Since our previous meeting, he’d had pneumonia. 'I just burnt myself into not being very well,' he said.\"\nA quote from Steve Jobs' widow in the same profile hinted at a role change as well: \n\"He had discouraged the thought that Newson’s appointment portended his own eventual departure, although when I spoke to Powell Jobs she wondered if 'there might be a way where there’s a slightly different structure that’s a little more sustainable and sustaining.' Comparing the careers of her husband and Ive, she noted that 'very few people ever get to do such things,' but added, 'I do think there’s a toll.'\"\nIve's studio is currently located on the ground floor at 2 Infinite Loop, with a direct passageway to 1 Infinite Loop, where Cook and the rest of his executive team meet weekly. \nWhen Apple moves into its new \"Spaceship\" Campus 2, the industrial design group, which now also includes user interface design, will get the best location on the ring. \nThey'll be on the fourth floor, in a new 30,000 square foot studio. They will have a view across much of Apple's campus. It's a symbol of how important the industrial design group led by Ive has been to Apple.\nWhen the team moves in, will Ive be there, looking at the campus he designed and helped build with them? Or will he be off in England designing retail stores, the Apple car, or Christmas ornaments for friends? \nNOW WATCH: This hidden iPhone feature will boost your reception \n",

      "text": "0 An iPhone 7 is displayed in a store in London, Britain October 4, 2016. Reuters/Stefan Wermuth \nThe iPhone 7 is one of the best mobile phones in the world. The Apple smartphone launched in September and received praises for being an improvement over its predecessor. But there is one thing about the iPhone 7 that is plagued by scrutiny: its battery. \nApple’s latest smartphone equips a non-removable Li-Ion 1960 mAh battery. Although it’s an upgrade compared to that of the iPhone 6s, it’s actually one of the least powerful phone batteries in the industry, especially considering the iPhone 7’s status and its competitors. It’s supposed to provide 14 hours of talk time or 40 hours of music playback. \nThe iPhone 7 lasted about seven and a half hours on Phone Arena ’s custom test before it was completely drained. The battery level reached 100 percent after 2 hours and 20 minutes of charging. In comparison, Google Pixel took 20 minutes faster to be fully charged. \nThe iPhone 7 lacks wireless charging support, a feature which fans expected from Apple. Combined with the A10 Fusion chip, the iPhone 7 battery provides longer performance compared to the iPhone 6s, according to GSMArena . Also, the Low-Power mode, which can be enabled manually, can apparently save the battery from draining quickly once the level drops below 20 percent. \nREAD: Apple iPhone 6s battery issues: How Australians can have their units replaced \nTechRadar pitted the iPhone 7, Samsung Galaxy S7, HTC 10, LG G5, Google Pixel and Sony Xperia XZ against each other in a battery challenge. All flagship phones went through the same performance tests that included web browsing, gaming, YouTube playback and native video playback. Among the six handsets, the iPhone 7 had the lowest battery specs powering the smallest screen. \nAfter an hour and a half of web browsing, the iPhone 7 had the least amount of battery life left at 57 percent. Following another hour and a half of YouTube viewing, all that was left was 20 percent. The iPhone 7 didn’t even finish the third test, which was gaming. It only lasted 44 minutes of gameplay before the battery died. \nThe iPhone 7 was completely drained after only 3 hours and 44 minutes of performance. The Samsung Galaxy S7, meanwhile, lasted 5 hours and 21 minutes doing all four tests. \nApple has big plans for the upcoming iPhone 8. The tech giant needs to step up its battery game on its next release in order to compete with its rivals performance-wise.",

      "title": "Secure URL Transition for Streams & Podcasts",
      "text": "By Kate Faughnan • 48 minutes ago \nAt this year’s Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), Apple announced that they will soon require all apps to pull their content through HTTPS links, and by 2017, will no longer support apps that fail to do so. \nThis requirement is set to go into effect January 1, 2017, and currently, many of our apps include podcast and station stream links from servers without SSL certificates. If we do not act, we run the risk of our apps not being functional, or updates being rejected. Further, if secure links (HTTPS) are not provided by Apple's hard deadline, noncompliant podcast and stream links will need to be removed from all apps to ensure ongoing functionality and updating in 2017. \nWhile we might not have chosen the timing, the work of securing our URLs is a critical project for our entire network to address because: We currently can’t use development platforms that already require HTTPS Secure URLs will allow tighter integration of donation functionality into our apps Secure URLs will improve security for our many users \nTo reach this ambitious goal, NPR will soon require secure URLs for all links included in our apps, and we will stop accepting new insecure (non-HTTPS) links by December 15, 2016 . Among other things, that means that you will not be able to save new insecure streams or podcasts into StationConnect and you will not be able to make changes to your current URLs until they are HTTPS-compliant. \nNew links will pass through a validation script that will check both the prefix of the URL, and the prefix of any embedded URLs, such as live streams listed within playlist (.pls) files or the audio URLs included in your podcast feeds. Our goal is for all URLs in StationConnect to be secure. \nHow this impacts Digital Services products: We’ve begun to both secure Digital Services products themselves, and to facilitate secure URL transition for our partner stations. Both   and StationConnect are products that are already secure. And we are well underway to a secure Composer 2. If you already have transitioned your website to HTTPS, you will soon be able to incorporate Composer 2 seamlessly without browser warnings. \nIn the short term, there are two actions to be taken: Podcast URLs: Contact your podcast provider to get an updated podcast URL. If you are a Core Publisher station who creates podcast URLs in Core Publisher, we will be providing a secure podcast URL for you. Streaming URLs: Contact your streaming provider to get an updated streaming URL. \nOnce you have these updated URLs, populate them in StationConnect. New or updated URLs that are non-HTTPS will not be accepted after December 15, 2016. \nFor those stations with iPhone apps: After January 1, 2017, all of your apps’ network connections will need to be over HTTPS. To allow non-secure links in the meantime, you need to add a new key in an app’s .plist file. Under App Transport Security, add ‘Allow Arbitrary Loads’ and set to YES.This new key will only work for compiling against iOS 9 and will NOT work after Jan 1, 2017. You should also avoid compiling against iOS 10 unless you are HTTPS throughout, as Apple has already begun pushing this requirement on the latest OS update. \nWe'll continue to update you as we work with our partners at Apple to make this migration as smooth and painless as we can.",

      "text": "Reddit \nIf discounts and deals are your thing, Apple seldom satisfies: the Cupertino company is not only reluctant to cut its prices, but generally frowns on those resellers who dare to. That’s going to change this Friday, though, with a rare Apple sale the day after Thanksgiving. Unlike many Black Friday promotions we’re seeing this year, though, Apple’s will really only be just for one day. \nApple calls it a “one-day shopping event” but, beyond the fact that it’s taking place, we have little to go on. The company will be offering two-day delivery on in-stock products as long as they’re ordered before 5pm, it says. You’ll be able to order online as well as through the standalone Apple app on your iPhone or iPad; there’ll also apparently be in-store offers too. \nIn previous years, Apple has offered fairly conservative discounts on select items from its range. That’s included Apple gift cards with the purchase of a product back in 2013, though it switched back to cutting device prices the following year. As for 2015, Apple skipped Black Friday altogether. \nEarlier this week, Apple revealed its holiday 2016 advert . Taking a festive monster theme – no, not a phrase you see often – it makes the iPhone 7 its centerpiece. \nAlthough savings from Apple are rare, better deals can often be found elsewhere during this pre-holiday period. In previous years it has offered around $50 off the cost of a new iPad, for instance, or $25 off a set of Beats headphones. Amazon, in contrast, is already offering more than $126 off the iPad Pro 9.7 . A set of Beats Solo3 headphones that Apple charges $299.95 for, you can save $50 from online. \nWhat remains to be seen is whether brand new products, like the fairly controversial new MacBook Pro, will get a cut come Friday. Apple was criticized from some quarters for just how expensive the new “professional” notebook is, particularly for those models which have the flagship Touch Bar interface strip. Although the range kicks off at $1,499 for the 13-inch version, you’re looking at upwards of $1,799 if you want the OLED touch-strip in place of the traditional function key row. \nOf course, if it’s an iPhone 7 you’re in the market for, Apple itself doesn’t have to be your only port of call. We’ve already seen deals for the latest iPhone announced in carrier and retailer Black Friday promotions. So, if you’re looking for a new iPhone 7 – or, indeed, a smartphone to suit just about any budget – we’ve got your covered . \nMORE Apple \nSlashGear uses Amazon affiliate links, and if you buy something we may get a small share of the sale Story Timeline",

In some previous years, the company has offered modest discounts on some products, or a free gift card with purchase, but last year the company sat Black Friday out all together.\n\nThis year, Apple’s in. The company announced a “one-day shopping event” with a teaser on its website. We just don’t know much else.\n\nApple’s online store already suggests gift ideas for various people, like add-on iPhone lenses for photography buffs, microphones and instruments for musicians, and game controllers and high-tech toys for kids. So Apple could organize its sale by the people on your shopping list, or just help you find the perfect accessories for people who own iPhones, iPads, Macs, and Apple TV.\n\nTo read this article in full or to leave a comment, please click here",

      "text": "Given how effortlessly Apple’s iPhone crunches paginated spreadsheets, image-heavy emails, and video games that rival some home consoles in graphical fidelity, the last thing you’d expect to bring it to its knees is a simple video. But according to multiple reports on Tuesday, that’s just what’s been happening: a malformed clip is rendering some iPhones unstable, causing them to freeze and crash in an endless loop.\nThe video in question, which YouTube channel Everything Apple Pro reports is making the rounds with the innocuous title IMG_0942.mp4, is a short clip that begins with a figure standing by a bed above the word “Honey” in block lettering. Playback proceeds normally at first, but the bug rears its ugly head after 10 seconds have elapsed. The affected iPhone becomes sluggish, then unresponsive, and finally freezes.\nMore: With iOS 10.0.2, Apple squashed the lightning headphones bug and a few others\nThe video appears to crash devices when sent as a link rather than transferred as a file. It doesn’t seem to matter which part of the video’s played, and it appears that Safari, the default web browser on iOS devices, may be the culprit. 9to5Mac speculates that the malformed video triggers a memory leak, or a failure to release temporary data generated while the video is playing.\nWhich phones are affected? As of now, the clip seems to affect iPhone models dating back to 2014. That includes the iPhone 4 and 4s, iPhone 5 and 5s, iPhone 6, 6s, and 6s Plus, and iPhone 7 and 7 Plus running iOS 5.\nMost iPhones which open the clip exhibit a cycle of freezing and crashing, but devices on newer versions of iOS — specifically iOS 10.2 beta 3 — display the “spinning wheel” animation that normally indicates a power cycle. Left long enough alone, they shut down.\nHow to prevent it The easiest way to prevent your iPhone from being compromised is to avoid opening a video link from a sender you do not recognize. But even if the person in question is a familiar face, it’s best to pay attention to the clip in question — you probably want to avoid links to unsolicited MP4 file.\nMore: iOS 10 problems and the solutions to deal with them\nOnce the video begins to play, there’s a brief window of time during which you can prevent a crash by performing a hard reboot.\nOn any model other than the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, you can perform a hard reset by holding the power button and home button at the same time until the Apple logo appears. On the iPhone 7, which lacks a mechanical home button, you can do the same by holding the power button and the volume decrease buttons.\nPerforming a hard reboot won’t affect your contacts, photos, apps, or other data.\nThere may be a fix on the way It isn’t the first time a bizarre bug has rendered iPhone models unresponsive. In 2015, a bug in iOS 8 led a malformed string of text to disable Apple’s iMessage app. Another bug caused iOS to crash when a certain date and time was displayed, and yet another caused Safari started randomly crashing on iPhones. Both were resolved in subsequent versions of iOS and Apple is likely to address this issue just as quickly.\nIf Apple issues a response, we will update this post. For now, though, it is best to be on the safe side where MP4 videos are concerned.\nApple has launched its second iPhone repair program in less than a week iOS 10 problems and the solutions to deal with them Which big iPhone should you buy? iPhone 7 Plus vs. iPhone 6S Plus",

      "title": "Apple partners with Indian ride-hailing service Ola to bring Apple Music to passengers",
      "text": "Reddit \nApple has recently signed a deal with Indian ride-sharing service Ola that will see Apple Music become available in some of the service’s cars The Los Angeles Times first reported on the partnership, explaining that Apple Music will come to some cars as part of a platform known as “Ola Play.” \nOla, for those unfamiliar, is India’s largest ride-hailing company, similar to that of Uber and Lyft. The service’s partnership with Apple is similar to Uber’s 2014 partnership with Spotify, which allows riders to control the music played in their Uber via the Spotify app on their phone. \nThe Ola Play platform is slightly different from Uber’s, however. Essentially, when a rider books an Ola car, they will be able to control air conditioning and music from an in-car tablet, while they’ll also be able to read ebooks and watch videos. In this case, the music will be streamed from Apple Music. \n“Cars were initially built for the driver,” Ola Chief Executive Bhavish Agarwal said during a news conference reported on by India media outlet YourStory . “But with ride-sharing, the control needs to be there for the passenger, and Ola Play works along that.” \nAt this point, it’s unclear as to the extent of Apple’s partnership with Ola. It could very well be that Apple is simply offering a discounted rate of Apple Music subscriptions for Ola cars, or there could be much more to it. \nNotably, this is the second ride-hailing company Apple has formally partnered with. Earlier this year, the company invested $1 billion in Chinese ride-hailing service Didi Chuxing and took a spot on the service’s board of directors . Not much has publicly come of that partnership as of now, though. \nAt the time of that investment, Tim Cook explained that one reason for the partnership was to give Apple a way to learn more about the Chinese market as a whole. As Apple works to establish retail locations in India and perhaps manufacture products there as well , its partnership with Ola could very well be for similar reasons. \nApple’s own car initiates have been somewhat unclear as of late, with some reports even suggesting that Apple has abandon plans for an actual car altogether. Nevertheless, its recent partnership with Ola suggests that Apple has other ways planned for entering the car industry. Guides",

      "text": "Apple has taken advantage of a shrinking Australian smartphone market to increase its share to close to 50 percent. Although this doesn’t represent a huge gain year on year, the combination of increased interest in Apple’s iPhone 7 and the contraction of the overall market meant it saw a more than six percent increase in its market share.\nThis information comes out of the latest report from market intelligence firm IDC , which highlights how Australian consumers purchased just 2.06 million phones throughout the last quarter, representing an 8.2 percent decline in overall sales. This is the sixth consecutive quarter that the market has contracted, suggesting long-term stagnation in the field.\nStill, Apple made good during that same period. Increasing its own personal sales in the region by 1.23 percent allowed Apple to take over a further few percent points to control as much as 46.42 percent of the market for the end of the third quarter.\nMore : iPhone 7 and 7 Plus: Our take on Apple’s latest and greatest\nIt’s generally believed that at this point the Australian smartphone market has reached a point of saturation, where enough people have devices that cater to their needs and the incremental yearly upgrades offered are not inspiring purchases.

      "text": "11/22/16 AT 4:46 PM Close \nFoldable phones might make a comeback through Apple, a patent for a flexible phone granted on Tuesday shows. \nThe patent, filed in July 2014, shows Apple has been looking into a hinged iPhone model, but hints that it might be other “ electronic devices” as well. The patent for “flexible display devices” reveals a touchscreen phone with a flexible, metal-backed OLED display that can be folded in half and grip to a user’s clothes. \nThe Apple patent points out how screens could bend either towards each other or back-to-back. Additional hinges allow the device to be followed in different ways, even in thirds. T he sheet of flexible metal comprises nitinol, the document says. \nThe patent, originally reported on by AppleInsider , explains how the hinges on the devices would work: \n“The hinges may include hinges based on a three-bar linkage, hinges based on a four-bar linkage, hinges with slotted members, hinges formed from flexible support structures, and hinges based on flexible housing structures. Flexible displays may be mounted to the housing portions overlapping the hinges.” Related Stories Only One iPhone 8 Model Could Sport OLED Display \nThe patent also hints that Apple wants to create devices that hold onto clothing. \n“Engagement structures may be used to help the housing grip external objects and to hold the housing portions in desired positions,” the patent says . “The hinges may also be provided with rotational detents to help hold the flexible display in desired positions.” \nThe patent also includes two-hinge designs, cover glass and viewing positions for the devices. \nIt is not for sure that Apple will create foldable devices, but the patent shows ideas Apple is exploring.

      "text": "It's been a rough year for Samsung, but the company may have just the thing to take on Apple going into the holidays: a shiny black Galaxy S7. Not to be outdone by the iPhone 7's new Jet Black color option, the Korean smartphone maker is reportedly getting ready to release a glossy black version of its own flagship. \n\nThe \"Jet Black\" Galaxy S7 is set to launch sometime next month, according to The Korea Herald . The new color would complement the S7 and S7 Edge's existing color options, which include matte black, gold and silver, as well as a stunning Blue Coral option that Samsung unveiled last month. \nMORE: The Best Black Friday Tech Deals - Amazon, Newegg & More \nSamsung may be introducing this new color to regenerate excitement around the Galaxy S7, which is the latest Samsung device that's reportedly catching fire in the hands of its customers. While Samsung recalled the Galaxy Note 7 earlier this year due to its faulty, explosion-prone battery, the company released a statement this week insisting that the Galaxy S7 is fine, and that any reported incidents are likely due to external damage. \nThe Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge are two of our favorite smartphones on the market, thanks to their sleek waterproof designs, rich displays and excellent cameras. \nHowever, even if it can overcome its potential safety issues, the Galaxy S7 has some serious competition this holiday season. The iPhone 7 and Google Pixel are arguably the best iOS and Android phones yet, and the newly released OnePlus 3T offers flagship-quality specs for just $439 unlocked. \nSee Also : Best Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge Cases \nHere Are the 10 Best Smartphones Available Google Pixel vs. Galaxy S7 vs. iPhone 7: Camera Face-Off 12 Best Android Apps You're Not Using About the author Michael Andronico @MikeAndronico Mike Andronico is an associate editor at Tom's Guide.

      "text": "\nApple has admitted that some iPhone 6S devices can suddenly shut down for no apparent reason. \nThe tech giant is offering owners of the problematic smartphones free replacement batteries. \n“A very small number” of iPhone 6S devices manufactured between September and October 2015 are affected, Apple said in a statement Monday. It didn’t provide details on the battery fault that is causing the phones to unexpectedly go dark. \nApple’s announcement comes less than a week after a consumer watch group in China launched an investigation into the problem. \n“A considerable number” of Chinese users reported their iPhone 6 and 6S devices would suddenly turn off despite showing plenty of battery life, the China Consumers Association said in a statement. The phones would not turn back on even when plugged into chargers, according to the consumer group. \nApple said the battery problem is “not a safety issue.” Its big rival Samsung pulled its flagship Galaxy Note 7 smartphone after repeated reports of the devices bursting into flames. Samsung initially said batteries in some Note 7 phones were to blame but is yet to fully explain the cause. \nApple’s battery replacement offer for the iPhone 6S applies worldwide. Owners of eligible phones with cracked screens will have to repair them before getting the new battery, Apple said. \nConsumers were plagued by a similar iPhone problem earlier this year. A software glitch with the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus caused the battery icon to display more battery life than was actually left, leaving many people frustrated when their phones appeared to suddenly shut down. The company fixed the problem with an operating system update. \nAnd just last week, Apple acknowledged iPhone 6 Plus devices suffer from “Touch Disease”— when the phone’s touchscreen stops working after it has been bent or repeatedly dropped on the floor. \nThe tech company rolled out a repair program, charging customers $149 to cure the disease.

      "title": "5 tips for getting started with the TV app for iOS",
      "text": "Apple's upcoming app, simply called TV, will make the Apple TV more like, well...a TV. The app will consolidate the Movies and TV Shows apps, provide a location for finding other video streaming applications and act as a TV guide.\nThe application is set to roll out sometime in December. However, if you've installed the latest public beta on your iOS device, iOS 10.2 beta 3, the TV application will be installed in lieu of the Videos app. And it will give you a good idea of what to expect for the TVOS version in the official update next month.\nHere's what you need to know to get started with the new TV app on iOS.\nAll your purchases are in one place With the TV app, all the movies and TV shows you've bought can be found in one place, under Library . They're still separated by category, but they're now side by side and easier to access.\nBy tapping Download, you can see all the stuff you've bought that you currently have downloaded to your iPhone or iPad. Unfortunately, if you want to free up space, there's currently no way to remove a downloaded show from your device from within the TV app. Instead, you must go to Settings > General > Storage & iCloud Usage > Manage Storage > TV , select the TV show and season, tap Edit in the upper right corner and remove the episodes you no longer want stored there.\nWatch Now is your new TV guide Photo by Taylor Martin/CNET If you watch any movies or TV shows on your mobile device, you'll spend most of your time in Watch Now . This is the section that shows all the top recommendations for movies, TV series and other suggestions.\nTo get the most out of Watch Now, you'll need to sign in to your TV provider at Settings > TV Provider . (Note your cable or satellite service will have to support this, which is much more likely if you're in the US.) Then, download and sign in to any streaming apps you use. Any time you download a new streaming application, you'll need to force close the TV app and reopen it to see recommendations from the new app.\nWithin Watch Now, you can also browse new stuff, such as the top TV shows and movies and a rotation of popular curations. For more specific browsing, you can view movies or TV shows by category or collections.\nUp Next tracks your shows for you Photo by Taylor Martin/CNET At the top of Watch Now is Up Next , which keeps track of any shows you're currently watching from any connected applications. If you start to watch a new show, it'll be added to Up Next. Your progress in the show will be tracked, and clicking on it will start playing it from where you left off.\nIf you're caught up on a show, it will disappear until a new episode is available.\nTo remove a show from Up Next, force touch on the show preview and tap Clear .\nStore is for discovering apps The Store section isn't quite what you'd expect. It's not the main place you go to find new TV shows or movies to purchase. While there are new releases from iTunes at the bottom of the Store, more than likely, you'll be browsing the Watch Now section or searching.\nThe Store seems geared more towards discovery of subscription-based streaming apps, such as Showtime, CBS or Starz. It also has streaming apps that require a cable subscription in the US, such as AMC, Comedy Central or MTV.\nThis is the easiest way to find new apps that work with TV. Unfortunately, you won't be seeing Netflix here anytime soon, if ever.\nRemove an app from TV There isn't much setup required for the new TV app. As long as you're signed in to any compatible streaming apps and your TV provider, streaming apps should be automatically detected and added to the Watch Now page.\nIf an application is added to TV and you don't want it there, you can remove it by going to Settings > TV and toggling off any of the apps you wish to disable. From within this menu, you can disable Up Next if you don't want TV to track your favorite shows. And you can also clear your entire play history.\nFrom within TV settings, you can configure iTunes defaults, such as allowing playback over cellular data or setting default stream quality for Wi-Fi or Cellular.\n ",

      "text": "Claridge's\nLast month we heard that Apple design guru Jony Ive and long-time friend and collaborator Marc Newson had agreed to design this year’s festive tree for the lobby of Claridge’s, one of London’s most prestigious hotels.\nIt’s a tradition that started in 2009, with designers such as Burberry’s Christopher Bailey, Dolce & Gabbana, and John Galliano all having offered their personal take on the Christmas tree in years past.\nClaridge’s has just unveiled Ive and Newson’s work for Christmas 2016, and while the entire installation fills the whole lobby, the tree itself is – as we expected – a minimalist effort. And then some.\nSure, it’s an evergreen conifer, but it looks to have been designed by someone who didn’t have time to get to the store to buy some decorations. Because the tree has nothing on it.\nPerhaps Ive was too busy with other tasks such as designing the next version of the MacBook Pro to unapologetically put back in all the ports that Apple recently removed , though with Ive and Newson’s shared taste for simplicity, it’s safe to assume this is exactly how they wanted it.\nAs for the hotel, on its website it says – probably with some relief – that this year’s design is “much more than a Christmas tree.”\nRelated: 8 things we’ve learned about Jony Ive, from Jony Ive\nWorking with acclaimed British set designer Michael Howells, Ive and Newson have come up with a “magical, snow-covered forest [featuring] four-meter-high light boxes that glow with black-and-white photographic images of snow-covered silver birch trees, set on a pure white floor.”\nIn a joint message posted on Claridge’s website, Ive and Newson offered a few words about the inspiration for their design: “There are few things more pure and beautiful than nature, so that was our starting point, layering various iterations of organic forms with technology.\n“Our aim was to create an all-enveloping magical experience that celebrates our enormous respect for tradition while recognizing our excitement about the future and things to come.”\nSo what do you think? How does it compare to the pair’s other collaborations, such as the one-off Leica camera or their solid gold earpods ?\nNew satellite tools give scientists fresh insights into evergreens on Earth Watch this robot lawnmower take on a moose, and lose McLaren finds unlikely source of inspiration for future wheel designs",

      "text": "Apple partners with Indian ride-hailing firm Ola to offer in-car Apple Music experience   02:25 pm PT (05:25 pm ET) Apple is venturing further into the automotive industry in a deal with Indian ride-hailing firm Ola, which on Tuesday said it will offer Apple Music to passengers as part of a new in-car experience. Under terms of the partnership, Apple Music will be made available during rides as part of a new entertainment platform called Ola Play , the Los Angeles Times reports. Ola also struck deals with \"experience partners\" Sony, Qualcomm, All India Backchod, Fynd and Audio Compass to realize the initiative. According to Ola's website, select cars will be equipped with a tablet device that grants passengers access to a variety of infotainment systems, including air conditioning and car speakers. Riders can also use the terminal to access pre-buffered high-definition video content, radio stations, personalized alerts and ebooks, among other entertainment options. Alternatively, riders who download the Ola Play app and sync with Ola's in-car system can access infotainment controls on their smartphones. \"Cars were initially built for the driver,\" said Ola CEO Bhavish Agarwal. \"But with ride-sharing, the control needs to be there for the passenger, and Ola Play works along that.\" The Ola deal marks Apple's second partnership with a major ride-hailing firm. In May, Apple CEO Tim Cook announced a direct $1 billion investment in Chinese company Didi Chuxing, saying the strategic transaction will bring insight into certain segments of the Chinese market. Beyond Apple Music and the customer data it will eventually glean from the Ola partnership, Apple's recent moves are seen as signs of a bigger push into automotive. The Cupertino tech giant was widely rumored to be working on a self-driving car initiative dubbed \"Project Titan,\" but a series of setbacks recently prompted a shift in direction to underlying autonomous vehicle technology . Self-driving cars are thought to be the future of the international ride-hailing market. Uber, for example, is already experimenting with driverless vehicles in the U.S. Industry analysts believe Apple is priming the market for autonomous technology integration, which could begin to roll out through partners like Didi and Ola.

      "text": "One of Apple's proposed designs for a device with a flexible display.\nPhoto by Apple/USPTO Apple was granted a patent Tuesday for \"flexible display devices,\" which could someday lead to a bendable iPhone.\nThe proposed designs envision a foldable device -- remember flip phones? -- with an organic light-emitting diode screen. The company filed the patent application in July 2014 with the US Patent and Trademark Office. The news was reported earlier by AppleInsider . \nIn June, Lenovo showed off a flexible phone prototype that you could wrap around your wrist. Around the same time, Samsung was reported to be working on two bendable models. \nNext year marks the 10th anniversary of the iPhone. There's already been speculation that at least one of the new models will get an OLED display . \nApple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. \n ",

      "text": "2 celery ribs , thinly diced 2 ontario apples , peeled and finely diced 1 tablespoon fresh sage leaf , finely chopped 1 cup vegetable stock 1 ⁄ 2 cup walnuts , roughly chopped 1 small loaf of day old sourdough bread (approximately 5 cups) or 1 small French bread, cut into 1/4 inch cubes (approximately 5 cups) salt and pepper Stuffing Directions Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C). Cut acorn squash in half lengthwise. Remove the seeds and season the inside with salt and pepper. Place cut side down on a baking sheet lined with parchment. Bake about 30 minutes or until soft. Meanwhile, in a large saucepan heat olive oil. Add mushrooms and sauté for 3 to 4 minutes. Add celery and continue to sauté for 5 minutes. Lower heat and add apples. Continue to cook until apples become tender, about 5 minutes. Add butter, sage, and vegetable stock. Heat just until butter is melted. Remove from heat and allow to cool. Place chopped walnuts and diced bread in a large bowl. Pour warm vegetable stock mixture over bread. Using your hands, toss the bread until it's well coated and most of the stock is absorbed. Remove squash from oven and turn it cut side up. Divide the stuffing among each squash half and spoon into the cavity of each squash until filled. Return to 350°F (175°C) oven and bake until stuffing is golden brown, approximately 15 to 20 minutes. Serve hot alongside a festive ham or weeknight roast chicken. Tip: Use Ontario Idared, Golden Delicious, Honeycrisp, or Empire apples.",

      "text": "Apple Will Replace iPhone 6s Batteries For Free \nThe carrier also specified that aside from Apple’s iPhones, consumers can also get the latest flagship devices from Samsung, LG and other top-selling smartphone brands. To get an iPhone 7 for just $100, users can surrender their Samsung Galaxy note 4, Galaxy S5, LG G4 and V10. The same devices can also be used to get an iPhone 7 Plus for just $200. \nAlso, as a trade-in bonus, people who switch to T-Mobile are getting $200. MacRumors has learned that people can receive up to $2,400 depending on the number of lines they are switching to T-Mobile. In addition, even non-T-Mobile subscribers will be benefiting from the carrier’s Black Friday madness since T-Mobile also announced that people who are flying on Gogo®-equipped domestic flights will get an hour of in-flight WiFi for free. \nT-Mobile is also offering Black Friday deals for those who want devices aside from smartphones. People who are getting a Galaxy S7 or S7 edge are receiving a free Gear VR and a $50 Oculus app store gift card. There are also deals for a free Samsung Tab E, LG Gpad X, UE Boom 2 wireless speaker and LG Tone Pro 760 bluetooth headset, among others.

      "text": "By Tiernan Ray Research firm Strategy Analytics this afternoon reports that Apple ( AAPL ) during Q3 garnered an “all-time high” share of profits in the mobile market, at 91%, or $8.52 billion, while Chinese brands Huawei , Vivo , and Oppo took the rest.\nXiaomi was in fifth place. All of the top four profited from the decline of Samsung Electronics ( 005930KS ), with its “ Note 7 ” debacle. Samsung had been in second place behind Apple a year earlier, but dropped to ninth place this year with just $10 million in profit dollars.\nThe results are qualitatively similar to a report yesterday by Canaccord Genuity ’s Mike Walkley , in which Walkley estimated Apple profit in smartphones jumped to 106% in the quarter.\nAnalyst Linda Sui is quoted as saying that “Apple’s ability to maximize pricing and minimize production cost is hugely impressive and the iPhone continues to generate monster profits.”\nThe firm’s executive director, Neil Mawston , commented on the strong showing by Chinese brands:\nWe estimate Huawei generated US$0.2 billion of smartphone operating profit worldwide in Q3 2016. Huawei captured 2 percent share of all smartphone profits, taking second spot overall, and becoming the world’s most profitable Android vendor for the first time ever. An efficient supply chain, sleek products and effective marketing have been among the main drivers of Huawei’s robust profitability. Vivo and OPPO followed in third and fourth place and each took 2 percent global profit share. Vivo and OPPO delivered relatively healthy profitability due to disciplined pricing and soaring shipments across Asia.”",

      "text": "× Apple hints at a foldable iPhone once again \nApple has been granted a patent for a flexible iPhone that can fold in half and grip your clothes. \nThis would potentially cut down on the need to stuff devices into pockets. \nWhile Apple often files for patents for technology that never see the light of day, it often provides a glimpse into what the company is thinking for the future. \nThe patent for “flexible display devices”— which was filed in July 2014 — features a touchscreen smartphone with a design popularized by clamshell phones. \nThe patent highlights how screens featuring a flexible OLED display could bend to face each other or fit back-to-back. \nAdditional hinges could accommodate different ways of folding the phone, too. For example, it could bend in thirds instead. \nIt’s unlikely we’ll see a foldable iPhone anytime soon, but flexible screens are in the realm of possibility — and this isn’t the first time Apple has shown interest in them. \nEarlier this month, Apple was granted its first patent for a foldable flip phone — one that opened and closed like a notebook. \nInstead of a screen, the patent described how “carbon nanotubes” could bend to form the center hinge. \nMeanwhile, it was awarded a patent for a flexible screen in 2016. It detailed flexible components on an iPhone-like device that could withstand bending, warping or dropping. \nFollowing complaints of faulty flexing phones dubbed “Bendgate,” Apple may be looking for a way to improve the durability of its hardware and better conform to our back pockets. \nOther recent Apple patents include a 360-degree screen that wraps entirely around a phone and smart glasses to rival Google’s failed Glass product. \nAlthough the patent for the latest flexible display illustrates how it could be used with a phone, the language references any “electronic device.” \nIt’s unknown as of now if there is an iPhone flip phone in the works, but there’s certainly an interest in the old school category. \nIn May, Motorola released a flip phone Razr teaser video, which was viewed online more than 6 million in its first week.

      "text": "Apple Will Hold A Black Friday Sale - But It's A Secret For Now 22 November 2016, 5:06 pm EST By Regina Festin Tech Times Remembering Apple iPhone 1 Now Playing Apple has recently unveiled a new page on its website on what could possibly be a teaser for its products going on sale within this week. There was not enough information on the webpage to give away what the tease was about. ( Apple ) Advertisement \nApple has recently teased a one-day shopping event this coming Friday through a new webpage section on its official website, signaling it will be rejoining the Black Friday tradition that it dropped out of last year. \nThose who are hoping to get some deals on various Apple products might just be getting what they want this Black Friday. Apple Black Friday Sale? \nApple has unveiled a new page on its website teasing fans of a Black Friday sale. Details on this event have yet to be unveiled but the company did announce on the page that this would only be for one day. In line with this, Apple sent out emails to its customers on Tuesday hinting on the same event but without mentioning the deals to be available. \nApparently, promos would be launched both on its offline and online stores though it appears that the Cupertino tech company would be focusing its Black Friday sale on ecommerce this year. The dedicated web section said that the fastest and easiest way to shop during the one-day sale would be through the Apple Store app. \nBuyers would also get a free two-day delivery on almost anything bought on that day. Additionally, Apple announced it would be opening some of its retail stores earlier on Nov. 25, Black Friday. \nThe webpage has not yet included complete details regarding the products and discounts available during this promotion. Apple: 'Friday Can't Come Soon Enough' \nApple's announcement of a one-day shopping event came as a surprise to many people since it dropped out of the Black Friday sale tradition last year to give its staff a break. In fact, Black Friday sale on various Apple products last year were only available through third-party retailers. \nThe company believes that being good to its employees would always be good for business; hence it did not join last year's Black Friday sale madness. But it is looking like a different story this year and Black Friday would be too good an event opportunity to miss. \n\"Friday can't come soon enough. Our one-day shopping event will be here before you know it. Come back this Friday to check everyone off your list,\" the website announced . \nExperts were still apprehensive of the upcoming Black Friday sale since Apple has not really been generous with its discounts in the last few years. Third-party retailers have also started selling their discounted Apple gadgets at least two weeks ago. \nWhatever made Apple change its mind regarding the Black Friday sale still remains to be discovered. The company has not yet responded or released an official statement about its change of heart. But this change of heart is a welcome move for many customers. \nApple will be extending hours on some of its offline stores to cater to the possible influx of buyers on one of the year's biggest sales.

      "text": "Close The Associated Press \nAn Apple iPhone 6s Plus smartphone is displayed Friday, Sept. 25, 2015 at the Apple store at The Grove in Los Angeles. (AP Photo/Ringo H.W. Chiu) Apple is replacing the batteries in iPhone 6S models that randomly shut off By Hayley Tsukayama • Washington Post 6 hrs ago ( … ) \nAn Apple iPhone 6s Plus smartphone is displayed Friday, Sept. 25, 2015 at the Apple store at The Grove in Los Angeles. (AP Photo/Ringo H.W. Chiu) The Associated Press \nIs your iPhone 6S randomly shutting down? Apple may owe you a new battery. \nThe company said this week in a post on its website that some iPhone 6S owners are eligible for a free battery replacement because their phones unexpectedly cut their power even when they have enough charge. Apple did not offer many details on why the phones are shutting down, except to say that the problem is \"not a safety issue\" and that it affects a \"very small number\" of phones. \nA look at Apple's support forums suggests that people have been reporting similar problems since at least 2015; users said their phones shut off and could not be restarted until they were plugged in again. \nThe replacement program was announced shortly after a state-approved consumer-protection group in China — a key market for Apple — asked the iPhone maker to address reports that some phones shut off even when their indicators said the phones were charged more than halfway. The Chinese Consumers Association said the issue affected the iPhone 6 and the iPhone 6S, the Wall Street Journal reported. \nOnly iPhone 6S phones made between September and October 2015 are included in the program. Smartphone owners who have been having this problem should take their phones to an Apple Store or authorized repair shops to get the official replacement. \nAnd users should know: If there are other problems with the phone, such as a cracked screen, Apple will replace the battery free only if you fix (and pay for) those repairs first. The company said other problems with the phone can make it harder to replace the battery.",

      "title": "Apple's Dividends Will Continue To Improve",
      "text": "Apple's Dividends Will Continue To Improve Nov.22.16 \nDuring 2016, Apple's iPhone sales faltered. \nApple's services sector grew 24% to $6.3 billion. \nApple's dividend history indicates increasing payouts will continue. \nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) appears to be getting back on track. Subsequent to the election, the share price dropped. However, this drop had less to do with the election than with Apple's faltering iPhone sales in foreign markets, especially China . \nIn the ultimate quarter of 2016, iPhone sales sagged 13% to $28.2 billion. And revenue declined from $233 billion in 2015 to $215 billion in 2016. However, revenue from Apple services increased 24% to $6.3 billion. \nRight now, Apple is predicting iPhone sales of $76 to $78 billion during the holiday season, the first quarter of 2017. If Apple hits this number, it will be an increase of 2.6% year to year. And since analysts continue to peg Apple to the number of iPhones sold, attaining quantifiable growth would get the company back on track and headed for $130 or more per share. \nDon't discount the importance of Apple's consistent growth in the service sector. Apple Pay and iTunes are essential to Apple's brand identity and consumer loyalty. Apple Pay is gaining acceptance wherever launched, while Apple Music increased 22% during the ultimate quarter of 2016. Revenue and margins in services are positioned to provide consistent growth for the next few years. \nOver the last four years, since 2012, Apple's quarterly dividends have increased over 50%. In addition, every time Apple introduces a new smartphone, demand outstrips supply. And the iPhone 8 is just around the corner. \nApple's P/E ratio is a mere 13, in an industry where the norm is much higher. This soft P/E ratio suggests no one wants to buy Apple right now. But this is an overreaction to weak revenue and unit sales. But with revenues and margins in the service sector expected to increase geometrically and the Wall Street Journal forecasting massive share buy backs because of offshore money returning, overreacting is less than rational. \nOver the next two years , dividends will be healthy because of repatriated cash. In 2012, Apple's dividend payout was 6%. In 2015, Apple's dividend payout was 21%. More than likely, this payout will increase 10% each year over the next five years. More often than not, investors ignore Apple when it comes to dividends. With $260 billion in cash, it's a safe bet that Apple will reward persevering investors with improved dividends. \nApple's dividend history indicates consistent growth. And management has asserted Apple's dividends will escalate. Taking into account that Apple's recent dividend increases - 10.6% in 2015 and 9.6% in 2016 - rose at the aforementioned 10% rate, Apple is a good dividend channel for investors. \nForget the negative numbers: Mac sales down 14%, iPad sales down 6%, iPhone sales down 5% for 2016, year over year. Instead focus on the positive numbers: demand for the iPhone 7 and the 7+ were the highest ever. With the iPhone 8's release, increased revenue in services, share buybacks, as well as Samsung's ( OTC:SSNLF ) well-publicized problems, 2017 should return Apple to ascendancy. The possibility of shares trading at 15x earning is realistic. If that comes true, Apple could reach $150 per share . \nInvestors should look for Apple to grow in the 5% range for the first three quarters of 2017, with healthy quarterly dividends increasing at or near 10%. Then during the fourth quarter, Apple should take off and soar throughout 2018.

      "text": "Demand For Apple’s New MacBook Pros Aren’t Slowing Down  12 PST \nWhen Apple’s new MacBook Pros were announced, there were many criticisms leveled at it, such as the lack of legacy ports, the removal of certain useful features like the SD card, no options for 32GB of RAM , and also how expensive it was. Despite all these criticisms, Apple’s SVP of Marketing Phil Schiller revealed that the laptop had received the most online orders . \nIf anything this seems to suggest that despite all the complaints, people were still flocking to the laptop all the same. Now it looks like even after reviews have surfaced, some of which have claimed Touch Bar to be a gimmick, demand does not appear to be slowing down, at least that’s according to a report from DigiTimes (via BGR ) in which they claim that Apple’s producer of the MacBook Pro, Quanta Computer, does not see signs of their shipments to Apple slowing down. \nThe report reads, “Quanta Computer, the sole producer of MacBook Pro products, expects its notebook shipments to be better than expected in the fourth quarter of 2016 and will slip only 2-3% on quarter from the previous quarter, according to company vice chairman CC Leung.” Of course these are just shipping numbers and don’t necessarily reflect sales of the device. \nHowever companies typically order only as much as they think that they can sell, otherwise they’d just be sitting on a ton of unsold inventory which is worse. That being said if you’re still on the fence about upgrading, if you can wait until 2017, word has it that we’ll get another refresh in specs, a cheaper price tag, and possibly the option to upgrade to 32GB of RAM . \nFiled in Apple > Computers .

      "text": "Reddit \nStrategy Analytics is today out with a new report dissecting the profits of the mobile industry during the third quarter of 2016. The report estimates that the mobile industry took in operating profits $9.4 billion during the quarter, with Apple capturing a “record” 91 percent share of those profits… \nIn doing the math, Apple recorded $8.5 billion in profit from mobile industry sales during the third quarter of 2016, which consists of July through September. \nStrategy Analytics director Linda Sui attributes Apple’s continually strong profit maximization to its finesse the relationship between pricing and production cost. \nApple’s ability to maximize pricing and minimize production cost is hugely impressive and the iPhone continues to generate monster profits. \nMoving further down the totem pole we reach Huawei, which captured 2.4 percent of overall industry profits. Notably, this maxes Huawei the most profitable Android manufacturer for the first time ever. Vivo and OPPO come next, each accounting for 2.2 percent of global profits. \nTonight’s Strategy Analytics report is a bit more conservative than estimates from other firms. For instance, BMO Capital Markets earlier this month reported that the iPhone captured 103.6 percent of the mobile industry profits during the third quarter. For those wondering, Apple is able to do that because of companies such as LG and HTC recording losses on their smartphone division. \nApple officially reported $46.9 billion in revenue for its most recent quarter on sales of 45.5 million iPhones and an operating profit of $9 billion. Apple’s growth numbers were significantly drawn down by poor performance in China, but growth in 33 countries somewhat offset that. \nThe full Strategy Analytics press release can be read below: \nStrategy Analytics: Apple Captures Record 91 Percent Share of Global Smartphone Profits in Q3 2016 \nBoston, MA – November 22, 2016 — According to the latest research from Strategy Analytics, global smartphone profits reached US$9 billion in total during the third quarter of 2016. Apple dominated and captured a record 91 percent share of all smartphone profits worldwide. \nLinda Sui, Director at Strategy Analytics, said, “We estimate the global smartphone industry realized total operating profits of US$9.4 billion during Q3 2016. Apple dominated and captured a record 91 percent share of all smartphone profits worldwide. Apple’s ability to maximize pricing and minimize production cost is hugely impressive and the iPhone continues to generate monster profits. Huawei, Vivo and OPPO are the next three most profitable smartphone vendors globally this quarter, but they are still a long way behind Apple.” \nNeil Mawston, Executive Director at Strategy Analytics, added, “We estimate Huawei generated US$0.2 billion of smartphone operating profit worldwide in Q3 2016. Huawei captured 2 percent share of all smartphone profits, taking second spot overall, and becoming the world’s most profitable Android vendor for the first time ever. An efficient supply chain, sleek products and effective marketing have been among the main drivers of Huawei’s robust profitability. Vivo and OPPO followed in third and fourth place and each took 2 percent global profit share. Vivo and OPPO delivered relatively healthy profitability due to disciplined pricing and soaring shipments across Asia.” \nLinda Sui, Director at Strategy Analytics, added, “Three of the world’s top four most profitable smartphone vendors are currently Chinese. Huawei, Vivo and OPPO have not only improved their smartphone product lineups this year, they have also enhanced their operational abilities and kept a tight lid on expanding distribution costs.” Guides",

      "text": "Apple grabs record 91% share of global smartphone profits in Q3, analyst says   03:52 pm PT (06:52 pm ET) According to the latest estimates from market research firm Strategy Analytics, Apple iPhone sales gobbled up 91 percent of worldwide smartphone profits during the third quarter of 2016, setting a new record. Source: Strategy Analytics In a research note obtained by AppleInsider on Tuesday, Strategy Analytics pegged Apple as the world's most profitable smartphone maker, with an operating profit of $8.5 billion for the quarter ending September. By contrast, the entire industry realized operating profits of $9.4 billion during the same period. \"Apple dominated and captured a record 91 percent share of all smartphone profits worldwide. Apple's ability to maximize pricing and minimize production cost is hugely impressive and the iPhone continues to generate monster profits,\" said Linda Sui, director at Strategy Analytics. \"Huawei, Vivo and OPPO are the next three most profitable smartphone vendors globally this quarter, but they are still a long way behind Apple.\" Apple's performance is made all the more impressive in comparison with the quarter's remaining top-four vendors, all of which notched operating profits hovering at around $200 million. Second place Huawei, for example, generated 2.2 percent of smartphone operating profit worldwide, while Vivo and OPPO both accounted for a 2.2 percent share. As noted by Sui, three of the top four most profitable smartphone vendors are now based in China. The firm saw increased performance from Huawei, Vivo and OPPO thanks to strengthened product lineups and a lean supply chain strategies. In October, Apple announced a Wall Street beat for its fourth fiscal quarter of 2016, earning $46.9 billion in revenue on the back of 45.5 million iPhone sales. Though revenues were down year over year, iPhone shipments were better than expected with handset ASP edging up above $600 thanks in part to iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. During the most recent quarter, Apple saw iPhone sales increase in 33 of its top 40 markets, and noted record churn from Android switchers. However, much of those gains were offset by a 30 percent year over year dip in Chinese iPhone sales. Today's research note is a bit more conservative than a similar report issued by BMO Capital Markets earlier this month . According to BMO analyst Tim Long, Apple's share of handset industry operating profits hit 103.6 percent as a result of losses posted by other major vendors over the same period. Topics:",

      "text": "Subscribe on YouTube\nThe wait is over. After four years, Apple has finally updated its MacBook Pro 13 and 15, revising the design to be slimmer, lighter, and more attractive than ever before. In doing so, Apple has brought the MacBook Pro in line with its other products – ditching, for example, the glowing white logo in favor of the new, chrome logo, just like that found on the iPhone, iPad, and 12-inch MacBook.\nThankfully, the changes are more than just skin deep. Apple has finally updated the internals as well, exchanging the older fourth-and fifth-generation chips for Intel’s sixth-generation Core hardware. The graphics have been revised, too, debuting the first incarnation of AMD’s “Polaris” discrete graphics in laptops. And lastly, the hard drive has improved, with Apple now quoting maximum read speeds of just over three gigabytes per second.\nThat all sounds great. But like so many Apple products, the MacBook Pro has generated its share of controversy. This starts with the ports, which have all been converted to USB Type-C / Thunderbolt 3. Though easy to use, and capable of charging the laptop, they demand a need for adapters. There’s also only two ports on the base MacBook Pro 13, and four on the MacBook Pro 13 and 15 with Touch Bar, which means there’s an overall reduction in connectivity no matter the model you buy.\nMore : Want the best MacBook? Go big or go home\nKeyboard quality is also a pain point. The “butterfly” key switch Apple debuted in the 12-inch MacBook was received with a collective meh from users, but that hasn’t stopped the company from putting a tweaked version of it in the MacBook Pro. It’s perhaps better than that on its smaller cousin, but it’s still short on travel, and will certainly annoy users who type for hours at a time.\nAnd then there’s the price. At $1,500 for the 13-inch model without Touch Bar, $1,800 for the 13-inch model with, and $2,500 for the 15-inch model, these laptops are incredibly expensive even by Apple standards.\nSo, are they worth the cash? Or is the new MacBook Pro bound to disappoint Apple fans?\nClose to the Metal is a podcast from Digital Trends that focuses on the geekier side of life.

Cheap iPad, anyone? \nApple has spoken, so the tech world listens. A holding page on the Apple website has confirmed there will be official Apple Black Friday deals this year. So start refreshing the Apple Store now if you fancy picking up a new iPhone. \nActually, don't. The page confirms the Apple deals won't go live until Friday, so we can all hold on until then. \nThat said, there are already iPhone deals in the Black Friday madness, so if you're in the market for a new mobile, check out our pick of the best Apple Black Friday deals . \nApple sat out the Black Friday sales last year, having offered iPhone discounts, iPad deals, iTunes vouchers and more in previous years of the annual shopping day. \nBut this year, Apple   back. Maybe you'll be able to bag a bargain on one of the many new adaptors on offer for the iPhone 7 ... More after the break",
