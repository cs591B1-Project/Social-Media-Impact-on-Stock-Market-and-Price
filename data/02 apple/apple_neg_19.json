      "text": "Ellen Scott for Metro.co.uk Wednesday 16 Nov 2016 7:23 am Phew. (Picture: Apple/metro.co.uk) Breadcrumbing is the hot new trend that's making dating awful again \nOur hope in the world. The ability to have a naming competition that doesn‚Äôt end in Something-y McSomething Face or Harambe. David Bowie. \nBut there is one thing this cursed year will never be able to wrestle from our clenched fists. \nThat thing is sexting. \nYou may remember that just a few weeks ago, sexting was ruined as Apple transformed our go-to emoji for representing butts, the peach, into a significantly more realistic peach . \nMeaning it no longer looked like a butt. Meaning we no longer had a butt emoji and everything was awful. (Picture: Apple/metro.co.uk) \nPeople were confused, saddened, and outraged. \nHow would we go on and live in this sad, scary world? And more importantly, how would we sext? When you wanna describe how big your girls ass is but Apple wants to change the peach emoji! üòëüî´ \n‚Äî Steven Alexander (@TheRealRealmers) November 6, 2016 K the emoji peach changing to resemble an actual peach is just devastating \n‚Äî Ian Zelaya (@IanDavidZelaya) November 1, 2016 Guys why even keep the peach emoji if it wasn't even going to be butt-shaped anymore, like that was the whole point \n‚Äî Angela J. Zhu (@angelajzhu) November 5, 2016 SAVE THE PEACH BUTT \n‚Äî Aminatou Sow (@aminatou) November 1, 2016 \nBut yesterday, finally, Apple listened to our desperate cries and took action. \nApple‚Äôs next beta update, iOS 10.2 beta 3, features a peach emoji that looks like a bum once again. \nTHANK YOU, APPLE. THANK YOU FOR SAVING SEXTING. iOS 10.2 beta 3. The peach emoji is back to its true meaning üçë pic.twitter.com/KnM5SmtgxX \n‚Äî Federico Viticci (@viticci) November 15, 2016 \nIt‚Äôs currently only available to beta-testers, but the new bum-like peach emoji should be rolled out as part of the next iOS update in the coming weeks. \nProof that not everything in this world is entirely awful.

      "text": "Colorado will soon allow digital driver's licenses Posted: Updated: On Monday, Apple released the iPhone SE, a new iPhone that's just like its current iPhone but smaller. It was a modest release compared to the iPhone 6S. But compared to the three-year old iPhone 5S, which the SE is replacing, Apple's new 4-inch iPhone... By Gabrielle Sorto CNN \n(CNN) -- Forgetting your wallet at home may soon become an excuse of the past. That is, if you live in Colorado. \nColorado just became one of the first states that'll soon offer digital driver's licenses. Iowa, Idaho, Maryland, and Washington DC will be the others. \nIt's part of a two-year pilot program funded by the U.S. Commerce Dept. \nThe state says it will soon work out who gets to participate. But imagine the possibilities: \n-- No more rummaging through your purse to pull out your ID at a crowded bar. We all clutch our phones like a lifeline anyway, so open an app and get a drink. \n-- No more panicking when a cop pulls you over and you realize you left your wallet at home. \n-- And best of all, no more standing in line at the DMV. Drivers can renew through their phone. \nFor those wary of storing sensitive information on their phone, digital credentials will make licenses more secure than ever, requiring a PIN or fingerprint verification. This will make it difficult to have a fake ID. \nIf you're worried about losing your phone, the digital license can be remotely deactivated or wiped almost instantly. \nAnd if you're the type who feels better holding on to physical things, Colorado says you can hold on to your actual driver's license as well. \nTM &¬© 2016 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

      "text": "Apple's Security Guide \nBuilt right into the Home button on every recent iPhone and iPad, Touch ID uses a highly scratch-resistant sapphire glass lens that protects the assembly and focuses the sensor, and a color-matched steel ring that surrounds it, waiting to detect your finger. When the ring is triggered, the capacitive Touch ID sensor activates and takes what's effectively a high-resolution snapshot of your fingerprint. The fingerprint is compared against what's stored in the secure enclave on the Apple A-series chipset, and if the unique characteristics in the arches, loops, or whorls match, Touch ID releases a \"yes\" token and you're instantly authenticated and your iPhone or iPad will unlock, your purchase will be authorized, your app will open, etc. If they don't match, Touch ID releases a \"no\" token and you're kept out. \nWhat's more, every time Touch ID scans your fingerprint, it uses the data to improve recognition, so it should work more consistently from more angles over time. \nYou can use Touch ID on your compatible iPhone, iPad, and Macs for the following: Unlocking your device (and additionally, on a Mac, switch between user accounts) Buying items with Apple Pay (in-store and online with iPhone; online-only for iPad and Mac) Authorizing iCloud purchases from iTunes and the App Stores \nThere are some cases when Touch ID is automatically turned off to protect your security: If Touch ID hasn't been used in 48 hours, you'll need to enter your passcode or password to re-enable it. If your iPhone, iPad, or Mac has been rebooted or reset, you'll need to enter your passcode or password to re-enable it.

      "title": "Report: iPhone 7 adoption higher than iPhone 6 launch, increased Android switchers as high as 18%",
      "text": "Reddit A new report from research firm Consumer Intelligence Research Partners today details Apple‚Äôs iPhone 7 and 7 Plus launch, showing some numbers that support the company‚Äôs continued claims of increasing Android switchers and more. It also shows that the iPhone 7 adoption managed to outpace that of the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus during its first month of sales, although falling short of the iPhone 6/6 Plus launch: ‚ÄúThe iPhone 7 and 7 Plus launch falls between the wildly-successful iPhone 6 and 6 Plus launch in 2014, and the somewhat disappointing launch of the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus in 2015,‚Äù said Josh Lowitz, CIRP Partner and Co-Founder. ‚ÄúThe combined share for the 7 and 7 Plus launch is up slightly from the 71% share for the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus in 2015, and down considerably from the 81% share for the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus in 2014. The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus benefitted from a new form factor, a larger screen, and the introduction of the even larger and premium-priced Plus model.‚Äù As for Android switchers, the report notes that the amount of customers switching from an Android device was up to around 17% this year, up from 12% for the launch of the iPhone 6s/6s Plus. CIRP notes, however, that the amount of Android switchers doesn‚Äôt seem to be a major contributor to the overall success of recent iPhone launches: ‚ÄúThe two more successful iPhone launches in the last three years were driven by existing loyal iPhone owners who upgrade to a new iPhone model, and rely less on Android owners who switch to an iPhone,‚Äù said Mike Levin, Partner and Co-Founder of CIRP. ‚ÄúWhen Apple launched the less compelling iPhone 6S and 6S Plus models in 2015, existing iPhone owners essentially sat out the upgrade cycle. Then, 26% of iPhone buyers came from Android, while after the very successful iPhone 6 and 6 Plus launch in 2014, only 12% of new iPhone buyers can from Android.‚Äù Apple has made a point of highlighting record Android switchers at its recent earnings calls and indeed said it had more Android to iPhone switchers than ever before during its fiscal Q4 call with investors last month. Users coming from other platforms, like BlackBerry and Windows, accounted for an additional 5% of new iPhone buyers, according to the report from CIRP. While Apple never announced specifics on iPhone sales and only shared sales numbers and stats through carrier partners this year, a report late last month noted that iPhone 7 and 7 Plus accounted for around 43% of all U.S. iPhone sales in Q3. Apple‚Äôs Q4 earnings report last month covering the July to September quarter was its first to include sales of the new iPhones. Apple reported sales of 45.51 million iPhones, down from 48 million iPhones in the year ago quarter. Guides",

So we may see a lot of this back and forth.\"\nAt 9:47 a.m. ET (1447 GMT) the Dow Jones industrial average was down 55.16 points, or 0.29 percent, at 18,813.53, the S&P 500 was up 2.46 points, or 0.11 percent, at 2,166.66 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 24.08 points, or 0.46 percent, at 5,242.48.\nEight of the 11 major S&P sectors were higher, with the energy index's 1.65 percent rise leading the advancers.\nThe financial index, which rose more than 10 percent since the election, fell 1.42 percent as traders cashed in profits.\nOil prices jumped more than 3 percent, bouncing back from multi-month lows on expectations that OPEC will agree later this month to cut production to reduce a supply glut.\nU.S. retail sales rose more than expected in October as households bought motor vehicles and a range of other goods. The Commerce Department said on Tuesday retail sales increased 0.8 percent last month, above the 0.6 percent increase forecast by economists.\nBoston Fed President Eric Rosengren said on Tuesday only \"significant negative news\" could derail the Fed's high expectations for raising U.S. interest rates next month.\nThe central bank is widely expected to raise interest rates at its next meeting in December. Traders have priced in an 86 percent chance, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool.\nHome Depot fell 2.1 percent to $125.13 after the No. 1 U.S. home improvement chain reported third-quarter results.\nAmerican Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Southwest Airlines, and United Continental Holdings were up between 0.4 percent and 5.5 percent, a day after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway said it had bought shares in the airlines.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,630 to 1,158. On the Nasdaq, 1,337 issues fell and 1,055 advanced.\nThe S&P 500 index showed 14 new 52-week highs and one new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 54 new highs and nine new lows.

      "text": "Apple exploring digital glasses idea Published http://str.sg/4Mqi Copy \nCUPERTINO (California) ‚Ä¢ Apple is weighing an expansion into digital glasses, a risky but potentially lucrative area of wearable computing, according to people familiar with the matter. \nWhile still in an exploration phase, the device would connect wirelessly to iPhones, show images and other information in the wearer's field of vision, and may use augmented reality, the people said. \nApple has talked about its glasses project with potential suppliers, according to people familiar with those discussions. The company has ordered small quantities of near-eye displays from one supplier for testing, the people said. \nApple has not ordered enough components so far to indicate imminent mass-production, one of the people added. \nShould Apple ultimately decide to proceed with the device, it would be introduced in 2018 at the earliest, another person said. \nThe company tests many different products and is known to pivot, pause, or cancel projects without disclosing them. Apple spokesman Trudy Muller declined to comment. \nChief executive officer Tim Cook is under pressure to deliver new products amid slowing sales of the iPhone, which accounts for two-thirds of Apple's revenue. \nIn July, he expressed enthusiasm for augmented reality after the rise of Pokemon Go, a location-based game that uses the technology. AR, as it is known, adds images and other digital information to people's view of the real world, while virtual reality completely surrounds them with a computer-generated environment. \nThe glasses may be Apple's first hardware product targeted directly at AR, one of the people said. \nMr Cook has beefed up AR capabilities through acquisitions. In 2013, Apple bought PrimeSense, which developed motion-sensing technology in Microsoft's Kinect gaming system. Purchases of software start-ups in the field, Metaio and Flyby Media, followed last year and this year. \n\"AR can be really great, and we have been and continue to invest a lot in this,\" Mr Cook said in a July 26 conference call with analysts. \"We are high on AR for the long run. We think there are great things for customers and a great commercial opportunity.\" \nApple has AR patents for things like street view in mapping apps. It was also awarded patents for smart glasses that make use of full-fledged virtual reality. \nApple's challenge is fitting all the technology needed into a useful pair of Internet-connected glasses that are small and sleek enough for regular people to wear. \nGoogle's attempt to develop Internet-connected eye wear flopped in part because its tiny battery ran out quickly. Google Glass, as it was called, also suffered a privacy backlash and poor public perception of its external design. \nBLOOMBERG   'Apple exploring digital glasses idea'.  ",

Looking back at Apple‚Äôs recent, historical twenty-year run, Ive takes viewers on a rare visit to Apple‚Äôs design studio to pull back the curtain on the nuts and bolts of the company‚Äôs creative approaches. ‚ÄúFor every finished product that you see, tools had to be designed, process had to be created and experimented with,‚Äù says Ive. ‚ÄúWe worked very hard to create a studio that has all these different facets ‚Ä¶ we have really made it a practice to just have our heads down and work, and ignore ‚Äî in some senses ‚Äî all the reasons something shouldn‚Äôt be possible.‚Äù \nThis new visual exploration of Apple‚Äôs design studio comes to us in promotion of Designed by Apple in California , a new book which traces the same history spotlighted by today‚Äôs vignette. You can check out the aforementioned video above, while viewers can learn more about Designed by Apple in California here . \nFor more from Ive, head on over to Wallpaper* for a sit-down with the design icon.",

      "title": "How to capture screenshots of the Touch Bar on Apple's new MacBook Pro",
      "text": "By Daniel Eran Dilger Wednesday, November 16, 2016, 12:27 pm PT (03:27 pm ET) The Touch Bar input strip on new MacBook Pro models is itself a Retina Display, but it doesn't show up as a display in System Report. That's prompted Apple to create specialized support in its Grab app to enable capture of screenshots of its current status. The Grab app was originally used to capture screenshots of the entire display, a specific window or an arbitrary selected portion. Apple hasn't publicly released the beta version of Grab that also enables a timed capture of the Touch Bar, but plans to make the tool available in a subsequent release of macOS. Because the Touch Bar is dynamic, Grab offers to set up a 10 second timer to allow you to switch to the app you want to capture within. As with virtually all of Apple's bundled apps, even the unreleased beta version of Grab supports Touch Bar; when you initiate a screen capture with Command Shift 4, the Touch Bar presents options to capture a Selected Portion, a Window, or the Entire Screen, and also allows you to set a location for saving the grabbed image. This also highlights how the Touch Bar goes beyond simply offering another way to type basic keyboard shortcuts. While a variety of early reviews groused that the Touch Bar didn't impress them much because they already knew some common keyboard shortcuts, the fact is that Touch Bar can present useful options in tandem with keyboard shortcuts, and presents these options graphically so there's no need to learn every complex option available. Touch Bar appears to function as a self contained input peripheral, isolated from the rest of the computer. It appears to run an embedded variant of iOS on Apple's new ARM-based T1 chip, which also handles security for the Touch ID sensor, using the same Secure Enclave architecture as Touch ID-enabled iOS devices. The Touch Bar doesn't show up as an attached display, nor as a USB device, nor as part of the keyboard and trackpad. It essentially appears to be a separate computer that boots up in parallel with the Mac, enabling it to also function (at least in a limited fashion, presenting esc and 12 basic Function Keys) when the MacBook Pro hardware is booted into Windows via Boot Camp. This design suggests that Apple could integrate its new Touch Bar into an external keyboard for use with other Mac models, including the iMac, Mac mini and Mac Pro. Topics:",

Apple's Jony Ive says the iPhone almost didn't happen 0 Share: \nApple Chief Design Officer Jonathan Ive (center) shares a laugh with actor Stephen Fry during a launch event in September. Photo by Stephen Lam, Getty Images \nWhat would the world be like without an iPhone? We apparently came very close to an existence without Apple's hit device. \nIn an interview published Tuesday by Dazed , Apple's chief design officer Jony Ive said the product could have fallen through. \n\"There were multiple stages while we were working on the phone when solving problems wasn't inevitable and we really did have concerns that it wasn't viable, that it wasn't going to work,\" Ive said. \nThe iPhone became influential technology he said, but it grew from a fragile idea. Still, that idea provided a roadmap to success for Apple. \n\"Ultimately we are able to develop hardware and software together to create a singular experience,\" he said. \nIve said there are plenty of ideas that Apple has prototyped but couldn't finish because some part of the technology isn't fully developed yet. \"So we put things to one side, knowing that at some point we will carry on working on them again,\" he said. \"It's not a question of this being right, it's just a question of when it's right.\" \nIve recently told CNET that the secret sauce in Apple products isn't just creating something new; it's the push to improve. \n\"We don't limit ourselves in how we will push -- if it's to a better place,\" Ive said. \"What we won't do is just do something different that's no better.\"",

      "text": "Apple mixed reality investigation: Why connected glasses are on the cards We build the case for the folks at Cupertino releasing smart specs   @sophiecharara \n2016 will be remembered as the year that real VR landed. The Oculus Rift , HTC Vive and PlayStation VR have grabbed the headlines, and Google Daydream is now here too. Plus with Pok√©mon Go's summer smash, Magic Leap and HoloLens on the way, AR has never looked a hotter proposition. \nWith big talk lately from Tim Cook and co, it seems Apple is investing, researching and hiring in both AR and VR. Piecing together the quotes, speculation, job listings, patents and acquisitions, here's our look into Apple and its augmented, mixed and virtual reality plans. Apple on AR and mixed reality \nODG's R7 smartglasses \nThe latest Cook quotes, internal hires and patents suggest that it's more likely we will see an augmented reality (AR) wearable from Apple first. \nThe latest report is that we should expect some sort of AR Apple smartglasses. It has reportedly ordered small quantities of a near-eye displays and anonymous sources say it will display images and other info from your iPhone. That's all we know for now but it sounds very Glass-like to us. \nIntriguingly, at Web Summit 2016, Robert Scoble also teased that Apple is working on mixed reality tech that it will incorporate into a future Apple TV. \n\"They are building the PrimeSense sensor right into the television, into the iPad and into the iPhone‚Ä¶ so you can do this kind of mixed reality,\" Scoble said, indicating that the system would launch within a year. \nRead this: #Trending: AR and mixed reality \nOver the summer Tim Cook really stepped up his AR chat, calling it a \"core technology\". He even went so far as to compare the two saying that AR will be a bigger business in the long term. \n\"There's virtual reality and there's augmented reality - both of these are incredibly interesting,\" Cook said on ABC News' Good Morning America . \"But my own view is that augmented reality is the larger of the two, probably by far.\" \n\"Virtual reality sort of encloses and immerses the person into an experience that can be really cool,\" he said, \"but probably has a lower commercial interest over time. Less people will be interested in that.\" \nThe success of Pok√©mon Go seemed to have helped Apple's AR cause ‚Äì and Cook namechecked it in a July Apple earnings call, continuing to say : \"... we have been and continue to invest a lot in this. We are high on AR for the long run.\" Apple on VR \nAn Apple VR headset looks increasingly unlikely, at least in the near term. But what does Tim Cook actually think of VR? Judging by early comments he made last year, he finds the immersive tech an intriguing prospect. \"In terms of virtual reality, I don't think it's a niche. I think it can be‚Ä¶ it's really cool, and has some interesting applications,\" he said. \nRead this: The best VR headset for iPhone users \nMore recently he seems much more taken with AR but has noted that Apple is very interested in new forms of education and gaming, both areas where VR is making waves. \nIt might not have its own headset but Apple is selling a virtual reality headset on the Apple Store. The retro View-Master iPhone VR headset popped up online in February, and could be the company's first attempt to test the waters with fanboys and fangirls to see how much they really love virtual reality. \nIt's also not like Apple hasn't dipped its feet in VR already. Back in October last year, Apple teamed up with U2, The Weeknd and virtual reality app VRSE to produce 360-degree videos to tie in with the new Apple Music service. The patents \nPatents are often a pretty strong indication of what a company has up its sleeve. Sometimes though, they are reminders of ideas that were shelved. \nWith the latest rumours of Apple AR specs, there are no new patents to pore over. \nBrowsing through the older patents, though, you can see that Apple was thinking about headset displays as far back as 2009. The patent filed for a new iPod video headset display would apparently have let users record video and zoom in and out of the footage. Apple also thought it would be great for viewing live events, letting you get closer to the action when you're way out in the cheap seats. \nEvidence that VR is on the agenda arrived in February last year. Apple was awarded a patent (image above) for a head-mounted virtual reality headset. It uses the iPhone as the display, much like the Gear VR does with Samsung's smartphones or Google Cardboard. The patent even talks about supporting additional accessories like spare batteries, physical control inputs and a cooling system. \nMore recently, people have been digging up patents around Apple's AR plans. Apple Insider has patents including the one above which shows a system for mapping a room using sensors and computer vision as well as transparent displays and augmented reality apps. Building the Apple dream team \nOf course, Apple is a company that likes to recruit the best of the best. When it was building the Apple Watch , the company picked up one of the top designers that had worked on the Nike Fuelband and also snapped up Paul Deneve, the former CEO of Yves Saint Laurent. \nAccording to a report in the FT , Apple has a \"secret team‚Ä¶ of experts in virtual and augmented reality\" who have \"built prototypes of headsets\" and that \"includes hundreds of staff from a series of carefully targeted acquisitions, as well as employees poached from companies that are working on next-generation headset technologies.\" \nRead this : How does VR actually work? \nApple's decision to appoint Doug Bowman in January, a leading virtual reality (and augmented reality) researcher is seen as a clear signal of intent. Bowman moved from his post as director of its centre for human interaction at Virginia Tech. He's spent time designing user interfaces for fully immersive VR experiences and also won a $100,000 grant from Microsoft last year to work on a mixed reality data study centred around its HoloLens holographic headset. \nMore recently, Apple has hired top VR and AR talent including former Magic Leap employee Zeyu Li as a senior computer vision engineer on the AR side and ex-Oculus research scientist Yury Petrov to focus on physiological studies of VR headsets. Apple is also reported to have sent employees to test out the empathy VR apps at Stanford's Virtual Human Interaction lab - three times in three months. \nThere's even a job listing from as far back as 2014 showing that Apple was looking for a virtual reality developer to design \"next generation software experiences\" and \"create high performance apps that integrate with Virtual Reality systems for prototyping and user testing.\" Splashing the cash \nWhy do the work when you can just buy the companies that have done the work already? Apple is not the first and certainly won't be the last company to snap up the expertise it needs to help build its hardware. And Apple has certainly been busy on that front in regards to its VR ambitions. Here's everything you need to know about...",

In turn, many have started to wonder if Trump will actually take steps to put into motion many of the grandiose promises he made during his election campaign.

      "title": "Sir Jony Ive Reflects on 20 Years of Apple Design",
      "text": "In celebration of today‚Äôs launch of Designed by Apple in California , a $300 USD coffee table book chronicling 20 years of iconic design history, Sir Jony Ive , Chief Design Officer of Apple Inc., takes us inside the company‚Äôs design studio, all while opening up about Apple‚Äôs creative process.\nIn addition to the two-and-a-half-minute video, Ive also sat down with Wallpaper* for a quick chat.\nOn Designed by Apple in California : \nThe biggest challenge for us was the fact that our focus and preoccupation is always on the future. So that tends to exclude much time to look back at the work we have previously done. Sometimes if we are struggling with a particular issue then that gives us reason to go back and look at the way we have solved problems in the past. But because we‚Äôve been so consumed by our current and future work we came to realize we didn‚Äôt have a catalogue of the physical products. So about eight years ago we felt an obligation to address this and build an objective archive. Many of the products that you see, we actually had to go out and purchase [laughs]. It‚Äôs a rather shameful admission, but it‚Äôs just not an area that we really invested much time or energy in, so we started to build an archive of the physical products. \nOn whether or not the team learned anything from the process of making the book: \nThe products we‚Äôre working on at the moment, and have been for a while, are the beneficiaries of all the learning we gained from the book ‚Äì so of course to us they are the very best things we have ever done. Therefore the frustration, the absolute frustration, of not being able to include that work was sometimes enough to make us think this is something we‚Äôre not going to be able to finish. It‚Äôs around 20 years of work and it certainly isn‚Äôt everything we‚Äôve done ‚Äì it‚Äôs the things that we think were salient in our learning or that we just had an affection for. That part [the selection process] wasn‚Äôt too hard or challenging ‚Äì we generally all felt the same way about the same products. But certainly to draw a line and say this will be the end of this first catalogue, first book, that was exquisitely painful. \nOn the key objectives for the book: \nWe asked ourselves, ‚ÄòWhat is the value of a book like this, when most people know these objects so intimately already?‚Äô First, to see the objects out of their functional context. Next, to see them in a context of the subsequent products and hopefully how we have learned as a team how technology shifts, moves and evolves. And the other reason was to do with the fact that many people don‚Äôt really have much of a sense of how their manufactured environment came to be. Most people wouldn‚Äôt understand how the chair they are sat on is made. One of the things we wanted to do was try and explain as clearly as we can ‚Äì through photography ‚Äì how you transform a raw material into a product that you recognize and hopefully use as a daily tool. \nWe decided to be fairly explicit about some of the processes we used. I guess we feel a strong sense of ownership of these processes because they really do aid our understanding and learning and transfer from one product to the next. We feel that more than ever there has been a disconnect between designing and making and really, you can‚Äôt disconnect them. In the 90s, as manufacturing was outsourced, this chasm developed between where something was made and where it was designed. But designing and making are inseparable if you want the ultimate product to have integrity. Another key point is that the book is being sent to all the major design colleges in the world. We are keen to get it into the hands of young people who are studying design disciplines. It‚Äôs very important that it‚Äôs an educational resource as well. \nAfter watching Ive‚Äôs tour of Apple‚Äôs design studio, be sure to head on over to Wallpaper* for their entire conversation with the Apple design officer.\nAlso, you can snag a copy of Designed by Apple in California beginning today.\n",

      "text": "Newport Beach, CA 11/16/2016 -- What makes companies such Google, Apple, Microsoft great? Is it an effective product? A commitment to help the environment? The ability to adapt to current market trends while simultaneously innovating for the future? The answer is that it's a combination of all these factors and more. It takes tremendous skill, leadership, and dedication to consistently deliver products that benefit everyone customers, retailers, and the environment while continually increasing profits.\n\"You have to consider those around you when you do business,\" said Claude Florent, CEO of Rainguard. \"We have not sacrificed our principles to make a quick buck or gain short-term notoriety because we believe that compromise ultimately does not work for companies who want sustainable success for themselves, their partners, their customers, and the environment.\"\nLike the tech giants, Rainguard truly is a company that does not merely go with the flow. Instead, they pave new paths and new models for other businesses to follow by offering viable solutions that are both long-lasting and highly effective.\n\"We're curating a whole new paradigm by going against the grain both in terms of maximizing efficiency in the supply chain to mitigate costs and increase profits as well as significantly lessening environmental impact,\" shared the ambitious CEO. \"And not just in the home improvement sector, but for countless other industries as well.\"\nAs Amazon and other major online retailers face decreasing profits and increasing logistical costs, Rainguard's response is both financially pragmatic and deeply interwoven with an unshakable stance on protecting the environment. With the current state of logistical affairs and its downward spiral trend, everyone loses in the process Amazon, the supplier, the distributor, the customer. Simply put, shipping is killing business. But with Rainguard, everyone wins. The obvious question then is: how do they do it?\n\"While online retailers most notably Amazon are getting crushed because of freight costs, we respond with real world solutions. We've aggressively assessed every single detail along the supply chain with incredible scrutiny and made every possible adjustment,\" explained Mr. Florent. \"What much of our investigation and subsequent action has boiled down to is pushing our concentrate formula which ultimately means less material, less weight, less volume and therefore lower material and shipping cost leading to an increase in profit and a better deal for the customer. In less than a year, we've seen a 16.2 times growth in online sales activity.\"\nWith their product format, Rainguard ensures the home improvement consumer gets the highest value proposition while the supply chain can sustain the business and that the environment is better for it.\n\"The environment is our home. Let's take care of it,\" continued Mr. Florent. \"By cutting back shipping, freights costs, and tightening up all other factors along the supply chain, we not only cut back on costs for consumers and increase profit margins for retailers, but also do a service to the environment by having less trucks, less materials, less gridlock and lower carbon footprint.\"\nRainguard's products are 100% eco-friendly from beginning to end. They do not contain carcinogens, hazardous by-products nor are they flammable. Simply put, they are obsessed with producing products that will never harm people, pets and plants what they call their 3P Environmental Standard.\nThe future looks bright for Rainguard and they intend to keep it that way with constant innovation.\n\"We are about learning from the past, making things better in the present, and always planning strategically for the future,\" the Rainguard CEO added. \"We're not just interested in selling a product, maintaining the status quo, or doing 'business as usual'. We're interested in re-defining the game in a way where everyone along the supply chain wins.\"\nTo learn more about Rainguard's innovation and sustainability policy, call them today at 800-272-4647 or email them at info@rainguard.com.\nwww.rainguard.com\n949-515-8800\n releases/rainguard-solves-amazons-logistical-cost-problem-for-online-retailers-742244.htm\n Russell Fowler\nDirector of Marketing & Social Media\nTelephone: 949-842-7353\n Russell Fowler\nWeb: https://rainguard.com/\n ",

      "text": "Share This Tweet This \nApple has recently launched the new version of iPhone - the iPhone 7. The high-end device has featured some cutting-edge specs. Rumors say that the next-gen iPhone will feature a curved screen as it coincides with the phone's 10th-year anniversary. \nMany companies like Samsung, Huawei and Xiaomi came with the concept of curved screens in their devices. It seems strange to think that Apple will ever try to copy Samsung - its key rival, but apparently, it seems to be happening now. Samsung was the first player in the curved design screen; the South Korean corporation had launched its flagship Galaxy S6 with edge-to-edge curved display. \nThe current Apple flagships have 4.7-inches and 5.5-inches displays. If rumors are to be believed, the next versions of the iPhone might feature 5 and 5.8-inch displays for iPhone 8, with the larger version possible sporting an OLED screen. According to Barclays Research Note to MacRumors , the devices will have larger and curved displays. Advertisement \nIt is also being said that screen will feature edge-to-edge without bezels display. The California-based tech giant hasn't increased the screen size since the launch 0f iPhone 6 in 2014. \nFurthermore, apart from the display, many speculations are floating on social media sites regarding the iPhone's next version. In terms of design, the device could come up with glass and metal build for ots materials without the home button. In place of it, the Touch ID will be featured in the display. \nAccording to Macworld , the US tech giant might discontinue the 'S' generation strategy. \nSamsung has revolutionized the curved display concept with its latest Galaxy S series. This concept might also push other rivals for the curved design. Apple hasn't come with any groundbreaking feature since iPhone 6; introducing a larger curved edge display in next generation flagship could be a game changer for the company. Advertisement ",

CEOs of major companies are taking stands about the results of the November 2016 U.S. election, a departure from the traditional model of not mixing politics with business that the major brands have long espoused. Legere tweeted ‚Äúlet‚Äôs see what an out of the box, non-typical, non-politician can do for America!‚Äù (AP Photo/Mary Altaffer, File) \nNEW YORK (AP) ‚Äî Apple CEO Tim Cook is telling his employees to \"keep moving forward.\" Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is saying \"progress does not move in a straight line.\" T-Mobile's CEO John Legere tweeted \"let's see what an out of the box, non-typical, non-politician can do for America!\" \nCEOs of major companies are taking stands about the results of the election ‚Äî a departure from the traditional model of not mixing politics with business that major brands have long espoused. \nSome are using it as an opportunity to bring their employees together following a divisive election campaign. Others are using it as an opportunity to stress their companies' values and mission, or an opportunity to make nice with Trump, who many CEOs were publicly against during the campaign. \nThe men and women who head the nation's biggest companies know that having a hostile relationship with the Trump administration could make doing business difficult. They also know that they operate in liberal bastions like New York and San Francisco just as much as in Trump-leaning places like Fort Wayne, Indiana, or Charleston, West Virginia. \n\"Neutral is the best policy,\" says John Challenger, CEO of workplace consultant Challenger, Gray & Christmas. \nT-Mobile's Legere, who long was vocally opposed to Trump, congratulated the president-elect on Twitter for his victory last week, while holding off on judging the president-elect's policies. Meanwhile another telecommunications executive, Sprint CEO Marcelo Claure, himself an immigrant and personally opposed to Trump, sent an email to employees saying that \"it's our obligation to accept the will of our fellow Americans and respect the new leader.\" \nIt's possible that Legere and Claure made nice because the president appoints the chairman and commissioners of the Federal Communications Commission, an agency that holds enormous influence over the telecommunications industry. All five FCC commissioners will see their terms expire during Trump's first term. \nCEOs of automakers, including Ford's Mark Fields, have also struck a conciliatory tone, partly because Trump has called for the repeal or renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which has allowed the automakers to set up shop in Mexico tariff-free. \nMany CEOs publicly expressed hope that the tensions dividing the country will diminish, and that American consumers will set aside their fears and get back to what they do best: shop. \n\"We are hoping that in the postelection we are just going to see people ready to spend,\" said Marvin Ellison, CEO of JCPenney. \nCEOs and companies that try to bring people together are \"going to be the winners,\" says Dr. Larry Chiagouris, a marketing professor at Pace University's Lubin School of Business. \"That always works better from a brand perspective,\" he says. \nWall Street, which donated heavily to Hillary Clinton, also now faces an administration that could provide both profit and peril. \nTrump has said he wants to roll back some of the regulations in the Dodd-Frank law that was passed after the financial crisis, a move that would benefit big Wall Street banks. But the Republican Party's platform also contains a provision calling for the return of the Glass-Steagall Act, a Great Depression-era law that broke up big banks. \nThere's talk of a massive, $1 trillion infrastructure program that could rely on tax credits to private funding sources. Many of those programs will require Wall Street's army of investment bankers and lawyers to help underwrite and finance. \n\"The president-elect's commitment to infrastructure spending, government reform and tax reform ‚Äî among other things ‚Äî will be good for growth and, therefore, will be good for our clients and for our firm,\" said Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein, according to a transcript of a voicemail he sent companywide. \nIn an email to his employees, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said the election of Trump shows \"the frustration that so many people have with the lack of economic opportunity and the challenges they face.\" \nTrump's victory drew a range of responses from CEOs in Silicon Valley, where popular sentiment had tilted strongly against Trump because of his statements on immigrants, women, overseas manufacturing and the use of encryption in consumer products like Apple's iPhones. \nIn a postelection email to employees, Apple CEO Cook didn't mention Trump by name but acknowledged that many people had strong feelings about the outcome of the vote. Cook had let it be known during the campaign that he didn't support Trump, although he generally avoided taking a public stance on the candidates. In his email, Cook said Apple would continue to support diversity.",

      "text": "ZDNet Japan Apple promises to replace iPhone batteries after shutdown complaints The China Consumers Association has asked Apple to look into complaints that a considerable number of iPhone 6 and 6s handsets shut down without warning. Apple is reportedly looking into the matter. | Topic: Mobility \nApple China is already in communication with its US headquarters over recent complaints that iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s phones spontaneously close down even if more than half of the battery life remains, according to a NetEase report on Wednesday. \nApple China has promised to replace batteries for consumers who have filed complaints over the matter, according to the report, which failed to specify whether the replacements are free of charge. \nOn Tuesday, the government-backed China Consumers Association said it questioned Apple Inc over complaints that the automatic shutdowns occur when the models still have about 50 to 60 percent of their battery life remaining, even after an operating system upgrade. This may take place at a low or moderate temperature, and the handsets could only be turned on again after being plugged in, according to a letter sent by the consumer rights watchdog, as reported by Sina news on Tuesday. \nGiven the considerable amount of iPhone 6 and 6s users in the country and the relatively large number of complaints, the association requested Apple to clarify the reasons behind the issues, explain what it will do to correct the issues, explain if there are any problems with the battery, and give feedback regarding how it will handle relevant complaints. \nThe association didn't detail the number of users affected by the problem. But shutdown complaints were widely seen on Chinese social networks, with many users saying they'd encountered similar problems but failed to receive necessary help from Apple. \nThe association gave Apple 10 working days to reply to the queries. \nThe incidents follow Samsung pulling the plug on its Galaxy Note 7 smartphone last month after recurrent battery issues.

      "text": "TWEET A pple 's iPhone is a major player in the smartphone game. But, depending on what features hold the most priority for you, there are alternatives that out-perform the cult-favorite device. While everyone's been talking about the iPhone, lots of other impressive smartphones have been released recently. From customization options and better battery life to enhanced privacy, here are five smartphones that could potentially replace your iPhone if you're ready for a change. 1. LG G5 Modular Phones Modular phones made headlines because they offer consumers the freedom to customize their handset with specs that fit their needs. Modular phones are essentially user curated. That's exactly what the LG G5 offers ‚Äî the ability to piece together modules to create a custom phone. The phone is equipped with a Snapdragon 820 processor and 4GB of RAM that runs on Android Marshmallow. Aside from being a modular device, LG is competitively priced. The company also offers free screen replacement for select consumers. And there's the fact that consumers won't have to play \"keep up\" with the latest iPhone model. 2. Ulefone Power If battery life is an important factor in your choice of smartphone, then the Ulefone Power might be the phone for you. The smartphone comes with a 6,050mAh battery. In comparison, Apple's iPhone 7 has a 1,960mAh battery. The phone also offers a quick charge feature where a five minute charge provides two hours of talking time and a 30 minute charge provides one day of normal phone use. Considering the size of the battery, the phone is relatively compact. Ulefone features a 6,050mAh battery. Source: Ulefone 3. Samsung Galaxy S8 It's been a rough year for Samsung after the company's Galaxy Note 7 was recalled and discontinued. Its next phone debut ‚Äî the Samsung Galaxy S8 ‚Äî will reportedly feature a Siri-like digital assistant, offer a 4K resolution of 3,840x2,160 pixels, have a pressure-sensitive display , be 90% screen , have two rear cameras similar to the iPhone 7 Plus and might be missing a headphone jack like the iPhone 7 . According to the Wall Street Journal , the South Korean company may launch the device in April. 4. Silent Circle Blackphone 2 For those who value their privacy, the Silent Circle Blackphone 2 offers something most popular smartphones on the market cannot: security. Encrypted voice, text and video chat are built in. The second generation of the Blackphone, released in Sept. 2015, offers a new hardware platform, a revamped operating system and more security than its predecessor. As for a Blackphone 3, the company revealed last year that it is working on a new model but Forbes reports the company is having some financial issues that leaves its future murky. Silent Circle's Blackphone 2 offers users a more secure smartphone. Source: Silent Circle 5. YotaPhone W hy stick to one screen when you can have two? That's exactly what the YotaPhone offers: an LCD screen in the front and an e-ink screen in the back. The dual-screen phone allows users to customize what they want to view on each screen and offers hands-free messaging. According to industry rumors , a YotaPhone 3 is on the horizon, offering the same dual-screen phone with a better price. The YotaPhone is unfortunately not yet available in the U.S..

      "text": "Apple May Be Planning a Bigger iPhone 8 \nApple fans and those who must find the perfect gift for Apple fans, rejoice! The iPhone manufacturer has announced a massive tome in the form of an Apple-themed coffee table book that‚Äôll cost a pretty penny: $299, to be exact. \nThe book, clearly for diehard Apple fans only, is called Designed by Apple in California, and the hardcover volume is bound in linen, 13‚Ä≥ x 16.25‚Ä≥ large, and filled with 450 photographs of various Apple products. A smaller, more compact edition with the dimensions of 10.20‚Ä≥ x 12.75‚Ä≥ will run you $199 if the $299 entry fee is too high. \nThe images populating the book are meant to show off 20 years of Apple design, with items varying from the Apple Watch to the Apple AirPort. Shot by Andrew Zuckerman, they‚Äôre meant to act as, chief designer Jony Ive described in a press release, ‚Äúa gentle gathering of many of the products the team has designed over the years.‚Äù \nApple is publishing the book on its own and dedicating it to the memory of Steve Jobs. If you‚Äôre interested in picking up one of the books, which would shock and surprise any Apple fan in your life who boasts one of every bit of the hardware collection available, it‚Äôs out right now via Apple.com and select Apple Stores. \nThere‚Äôs a rare collection of Apple Stores where the book will be sold, but where it‚Äôs available for sale you can also thumb through the pages to get an idea of what you‚Äôll receive with the full package whenever you finally get your hands on the book. \nIt might be a bit pricey for what you get, but when it comes to Apple products you are usually paying for quality, and this book does look like a massive tome. The jury is out on whether or not it really needs to be $299, but for true Apple fans, it‚Äôs likely worth its weight in gold. Share",

      "title": "Report: Apple not looking to go all-in with original TV content, Jimmy Iovine leading efforts",
      "text": "Reddit \nA new report out of The Information this evening outlines more details concerning Apple‚Äôs efforts when it moves to securing original content rights. The report, which reiterates some of what we already knew concerning Apple‚Äôs efforts, focuses on the company‚Äôs reserved and ‚Äúquixotic‚Äù attitudes‚Ä¶ \nThe report explains that Apple isn‚Äôt necessarily willing to commit itself to go all-in with original video. The company has reportedly told executives in the entertainment industry that it isn‚Äôt looking to accumulate a huge slate of original content like Amazon and Netflix have done. Amazon and Netflix are each spending several billion dollars a year on original content, while Apple‚Äôs spending is unknown and likely significantly less than that. \nSpearheading Apple‚Äôs original video content efforts at this point are Apple Music executives Jimmy Iovine, Larry Jackson, and Robert Kondrk . This is somewhat notable as it suggests that Apple doesn‚Äôt necessarily have a full team working on its video efforts at this point, though it is in the process of developing a reality series called Planet of the Apps that‚Äôs focused on the app economy. \nPartially because of the involvement of Iovine, Jackson, and Kondrk, Apple at this point is said to be primarily focusing its video efforts on ideas that complement Apple Music, something Eddy Cue has suggested in the past. \nIn its negotiations with Hollywood, however, Apple has also been working to get movies to iTunes at a faster pace. In some instances, Apple secures exclusive rights to a movie before it even gets the green light from a studio. Often, Apple trades exclusive rights for top-tier promotion on the iTunes Store. \nApple has been getting more aggressive at landing movies for iTunes. In some cases, it is securing rights even before a project has been greenlighted by the studio making it. \nOne specific instance of this was Apple‚Äôs discussions with producers of Michael Moore‚Äôs ‚ÄúTrumpLand‚Äù documentary. \nOne notable tidbit from today‚Äôs report is that Apple executives met with comedian Chris Rock to discuss a potential video deal. In the end, however, Rock ended up inking a deal with Netflix believed to be worth $40 million and that will see him give the service two stand-up specials. \nEssentially, today‚Äôs report is more of the same: Apple‚Äôs original video content efforts are small at this point, with the company focusing on intiatives that complement existing services like the App Store and Apple Music. Whether or not Apple ever intends to go all-in like Netflix and Amazon have done remains to be seen, but for now, this is what we have. Guides Apple TV \nApple TV is Apple's set-top box offering that allows users to stream content from services like Netflix, Hulu, and many more via the tvOS App Store.",

      "text": "\n* Microsoft, Amazon, Apple boost S&P, Nasdaq \n* U.S. airlines rise after Buffett's Berkshire buys stake \n* Oil prices jump 3 pct \n* October U.S. retail sales rise more than expected \n* Dow down 0.29 pct, S&P up 0.11 pct, Nasdaq up 0.46 pct (Updates to open) \nBy Tanya Agrawal and Anya George Tharakan \nNov 15 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq opened higher on Tuesday, helped by a recovery in tech stocks, while the Dow Jones Industrial average fell after rising for six straight days. \nThe S&P technology sector, which had fallen about 3 percent since the election, rose 1.07 percent. \nMicrosoft's 1.31 percent rise gave the biggest boost to the S&P and the Dow, followed by Amazon and Apple. \nBoth indexes had rallied in the past week since the shock victory of Donald Trump in the U.S. election on expectations of higher fiscal spending and lower regulations. \nHowever, investors remain uncertain about Trump's policies and are also keeping an eye on key appointments in his administration. \nExpectations Trump's administration will cut taxes, increase spending and accelerate inflation have boosted the dollar and driven bond yields higher. \nThe dollar slipped from an 11-month high, pausing for breath after rallying almost 3 percent since Trump's win. \n\"We're sort of poised for a little bit of a pullback here as people reassess what the new administration is likely to accomplish,\" said Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James in St. Petersburg, Florida. \n\"The uncertainty is going to hang over the markets for a while. So we may see a lot of this back and forth.\" \nAt 9:47 a.m. ET (1447 GMT) the Dow Jones industrial average was down 55.16 points, or 0.29 percent, at 18,813.53, the S&P 500 was up 2.46 points, or 0.11 percent, at 2,166.66 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 24.08 points, or 0.46 percent, at 5,242.48. \nEight of the 11 major S&P sectors were higher, with the energy index's 1.65 percent rise leading the advancers. \nThe financial index, which rose more than 10 percent since the election, fell 1.42 percent as traders cashed in profits. \nOil prices jumped more than 3 percent, bouncing back from multi-month lows on expectations that OPEC will agree later this month to cut production to reduce a supply glut. \nU.S. retail sales rose more than expected in October as households bought motor vehicles and a range of other goods. The Commerce Department said on Tuesday retail sales increased 0.8 percent last month, above the 0.6 percent increase forecast by economists. \nBoston Fed President Eric Rosengren said on Tuesday only \"significant negative news\" could derail the Fed's high expectations for raising U.S. interest rates next month. \nThe central bank is widely expected to raise interest rates at its next meeting in December. Traders have priced in an 86 percent chance, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool. \nHome Depot fell 2.1 percent to $125.13 after the No. 1 U.S. home improvement chain reported third-quarter results. \nAmerican Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Southwest Airlines, and United Continental Holdings were up between 0.4 percent and 5.5 percent, a day after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway said it had bought shares in the airlines. \nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,630 to 1,158. On the Nasdaq, 1,337 issues fell and 1,055 advanced. \nThe S&P 500 index showed 14 new 52-week highs and one new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 54 new highs and nine new lows.

The new Macbook Pro discussion was mostly good, good points were made from both points of view, but complaining about a book? Common.. You're getting it wrong, the problem it's not the book, is the price point on it and the content quality that could've been better at that price.",

      "title": "Apple reportedly set to reduce its revenue cut of video subscription apps from 30% to 15%",
      "text": "Reddit \nApple is reportedly planning to change how it handles subscriptions for video streaming services via the App Store. According to a new report from Bloomberg , Apple will cut the percentage of revenue it takes from streaming video apps in an effort to improve its relationship with those in that industry‚Ä¶ \nThe report, which cites ‚Äúpeople familiar with the plans,‚Äù claims that Apple is looking to cut its portion of subscription revenue from 30 percent to 15 perfect for video streaming apps. Other apps that offer subscriptions see Apple‚Äôs portion cut to 15 percent only after a user has been subscribed for a year, but video apps see the benefit right from the start of a user‚Äôs subscription. \nThe iPhone maker intends to reduce the slice of revenue it is paid by subscription video streaming apps from the current 30 percent to 15 percent, according to people familiar with the plans. Other non-video apps see their bill from Apple halved from 30 percent only after a customer has completed a year‚Äôs subscription. Apple spokesman Tom Neumayr declined to comment. \nMany streaming video apps allow users to subscribe in-app to their service, but in most instances, the video streaming service charges more for iOS in-app subscriptions than if the user were to subscribe via the web. This, of course, is in an effort to off-set the 30 percent cut taken by Apple. \nAt this point, it‚Äôs unclear how video streaming services will respond to this move. Ideally, those apps that charge higher subscription prices for in-app purchases will cut the price to be more in-line with out-of-app subscriptions or at least to acknowledge the smaller cut being taken by Apple. \nApple‚Äôs 30 percent cut has frustrated many subscription services. Specifically, Spotify has long voiced its frustration with Apple‚Äôs App Store policies. Apple revamped some of its subscription policies earlier this year, introducing the new 85-15 percent split for non-video apps after a user has been subscribed for a year. Spotify, however, wasn‚Äôt pleased with those changes and said that they didn‚Äôt address the ‚Äúcore issues.‚Äù \nIt‚Äôs unclear when Apple will start rolling out the new subscription model for video apps, but Apple hopes the change will improve its relationship with video studios as it continues to explore the idea of original content .

      "text": "share Apple plans to cut its 30 percent App Store fee down to 15 percent for video services, according to a report from Bloomberg . The move follows a drastic shift, announced back in June , that altered how Apple collects revenue from third-party subscription services on its platform. That rule change made it so companies could knock App Store fees down to 15 percent after a customer had been paying for a year. Now, it appears video services will be granted the 15 percent exemption from the onset. According to the report, Apple‚Äôs only stipulation is that the video provider integrates with its upcoming TV app. That software, unveiled in October and set to be released next month, acts as a one-stop-shop for iOS and Apple TV users to browse shows and movies across a wide variety of apps, through an interface Apple controls using data it collects from participating partners. Notably, Netflix disagreed with Apple‚Äôs data-collection policy, choosing not to integrate with its TV app at launch. It‚Äôs unclear if Netflix will now agree to work with Apple in exchange for the reduction in App Store fees. Video services that integrate with Apple‚Äôs TV app will pay half the fees This is a critical move on Apple‚Äôs part to urge video providers like Netflix, Amazon, and HBO to work with Apple on its entertainment ambitions. The iPhone maker has reportedly had trouble hammering out deals with cable channels and broadcast networks in its efforts to launch a over-the-top cable bundle similar to Sling TV and PlayStation Vue. So Apple‚Äôs TV app is its next best shot at maintaining control over how users of its devices consume video. By cutting fees for video services, the company is hoping it will entice major providers that have long complained about the cost of operating in the App Store. Some companies have even raised the price of subscribing through the App Store, or in some cases urged customers to sign up online instead, so as to make up for Apple‚Äôs revenue share or avoid it altogether. - Source: Bloomberg More From The Verge ",

      "text": "Apple Nears Buy Point As Most FANG Stocks Rise Modestly Apple stock had its best day since Donald Trump's surprise win sent big tech stocks falling. (Apple) Reprints \nApple ( AAPL ) approached a buy point and most of the FANG stocks rose modestly Wednesday, now six weekdays since the surprise presidential election of Donald Trump ‚Äî who has had some pointed criticism for the tech industry ‚Äî sent big tech stocks tumbling before modestly rebounding the past two days. \nIn fact, Apple and the other large FANG internets ‚Äî Facebook ( FB ), Amazon ( AMZN ), Netflix ( NFLX ) and Alphabet ( GOOGL ) ‚Äî had started falling at least two weeks before Election Day (except for Google-owner Alphabet, whose downturn began Oct. 28). All four FANGs had been trading at or near all-time highs, but mixed earnings for Apple, Amazon and Alphabet weighed on the group. \nBut after the election, a sector rotation ensued, with industries such as drugs and banks getting a lift from Trump's win, and techs, alternative-energy and other arenas getting hit. IBD'S TAKE: The biggest tech companies, of course, aren't necessarily the best tech stocks for investors at any given time. Which techs are best? There are tons of opinions and answers when asking that question, but a good source to put on your checklist is IBD's Tech Leaders . \nBut Trump's election-campaign views and expected priorities have good as well as bad connotations for tech industries. \nWilliam Blair analyst Bhavan Suri summed it up in a research note Wednesday: \n\"Overall, we believe his views on global trade, net neutrality and internet privacy, and immigration could have negative consequences for technology companies, but his tax plan (including reducing the repatriation tax rate to 10%) would be a net positive given the large amount of foreign cash that many technology companies possess.\" \nTrump's repatriation tax plan could bring big bucks back to the U.S. for the top five companies with overseas holdings. Besides Apple and Alphabet, the top five include Microsoft ( MSFT ), Cisco Systems ( CSCO ) and Oracle ( ORCL ). \nIn his note, Suri was not shy about pointing out what Microsoft, Cisco and Oracle might target with that cash. Microsoft, he said, might go after ServiceNow ( NOW ), Twilio ( TWLO ) or Symantec ( SYMC ). Cisco he sees eyeing FireEye ( FEYE ), Gigamon ( GIMO ) and F5 Networks ( FFIV ). Oracle, he says, might take a run at Veeva Systems ( VEEV ) or Tableau Software ( DATA ). \nIn the meantime, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon and Netflix rose for a second straight day. Facebook was the only decliner, falling 0.73% to 116.34, after touching a more than four-month low of 113.55 on Monday. \nApple was the big gainer of the bunch on Wednesday, rising 2.7% to 110.04. That was easily its best day since Trump's win, marking its biggest percentage gain since Sept. 14. It is nearing a 118.79 buy point out of a flat base. \nNetflix stock rose a fraction to 115.17. It's forming a cup-with-handle base, with a buy point of 129.40. \nShares of Alphabet and Amazon rose 0.62% and 0.39%, respectively. \nRELATED:",

      "text": "Holiday Buyer's Guide Apple reportedly plans to cut App Store video fees Move could soothe feelings of partners who have long accused the tech giant of using the store to suppress rival services. Apple reportedly plans to cut App Store video fees   \nApple is planning to cut in half the amount it charges to sell video services over the App Store, a move seen as assuaging concerns of its partners, Bloomberg reported Wednesday. \nThe tech titan plans to reduce the amount of revenue it collects from subscription video streaming apps from the current 30 percent to 15 percent, Bloomberg reported, citing unidentified people familiar with the company's plans. Apple takes a 30 percent cut of sales for app subscriptions, but if an app maker holds onto a subscriber for a year or longer, Apple's cut will shrink to 15 percent. \nThe concession could go a long way toward soothing the feelings of partners, who have long accused Apple of using the App Store as a means for stifling rival services. The move also underscores the growing importance video is playing to Apple, which next month will launch a new TV app that showcases TV shows and movies from apps that a customer subscribes to. \nApple representatives did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

      "text": "Chinese consumers' body takes up complaints of iPhone shutdowns with Apple Tue Nov 15, 2016 7:51am EST [ - ] Text [ + ] \n(Reuters) - The China Consumers Association (CCA) has asked Apple to investigate \"a considerable number\" of reports by users of iPhone 6 and 6s phones that the devices have been shutting off and cannot be turned back on again, it said on Tuesday. \nThe reported problems specifically involve users seeing their iPhones automatically shut off despite 50-60 percent battery levels, and the involuntary shutting off in room temperature or colder environments, as well as the inability to turn the cellphone back on despite continuous battery charging, the statement said. \n\"In view that Apple iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s series cellphones in China have a considerable number of users, and the number of people who've reported this problem is rather many, China Consumer Association has already made a query with Apple,\" the association said in a statement on its website. \nApple did not respond to a request for comment when contacted outside regular hours on Tuesday. \nIn September Apple's rival phone maker Samsung Electronics Co announced a global recall of at least 2.5 million of its flagship Note 7 smartphones due to faulty batteries causing some phones to catch fire. \n(Reporting by Jess Macy Yu and Sijia Jiang; Editing by Greg Mahlich) ¬© Thomson Reuters 2016 All rights reserved.

      "text": "Chinese consumers' body takes up complaints of iPhone shutdowns with Apple Tue Nov 15, 2016 7:51am EST [ - ] Text [ + ] \n(Reuters) - The China Consumers Association (CCA) has asked Apple to investigate \"a considerable number\" of reports by users of iPhone 6 and 6s phones that the devices have been shutting off and cannot be turned back on again, it said on Tuesday. \nThe reported problems specifically involve users seeing their iPhones automatically shut off despite 50-60 percent battery levels, and the involuntary shutting off in room temperature or colder environments, as well as the inability to turn the cellphone back on despite continuous battery charging, the statement said. \n\"In view that Apple iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s series cellphones in China have a considerable number of users, and the number of people who've reported this problem is rather many, China Consumer Association has already made a query with Apple,\" the association said in a statement on its website. \nApple did not respond to a request for comment when contacted outside regular hours on Tuesday. \nIn September Apple's rival phone maker Samsung Electronics Co announced a global recall of at least 2.5 million of its flagship Note 7 smartphones due to faulty batteries causing some phones to catch fire. \n(Reporting by Jess Macy Yu and Sijia Jiang; Editing by Greg Mahlich) ¬© Thomson Reuters 2016 All rights reserved.

      "text": "Chinese consumers' body takes up complaints of iPhone shutdowns with Apple Tue Nov 15, 2016 7:51am EST [ - ] Text [ + ] \n(Reuters) - The China Consumers Association (CCA) has asked Apple to investigate \"a considerable number\" of reports by users of iPhone 6 and 6s phones that the devices have been shutting off and cannot be turned back on again, it said on Tuesday. \nThe reported problems specifically involve users seeing their iPhones automatically shut off despite 50-60 percent battery levels, and the involuntary shutting off in room temperature or colder environments, as well as the inability to turn the cellphone back on despite continuous battery charging, the statement said. \n\"In view that Apple iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s series cellphones in China have a considerable number of users, and the number of people who've reported this problem is rather many, China Consumer Association has already made a query with Apple,\" the association said in a statement on its website. \nApple did not respond to a request for comment when contacted outside regular hours on Tuesday. \nIn September Apple's rival phone maker Samsung Electronics Co announced a global recall of at least 2.5 million of its flagship Note 7 smartphones due to faulty batteries causing some phones to catch fire. \n(Reporting by Jess Macy Yu and Sijia Jiang; Editing by Greg Mahlich) ¬© Thomson Reuters 2016 All rights reserved.

(Source: Twitter@Emojipedia/CNN) \nThe peach butt is back after Apple changed the look of its peach emoji earlier this month. \nThe decision came after Apple officials heard the piece of fruit emoji looked much like a rear end. \nApple decided to reverse course again and change it back to look like the original, with just a slightly longer stem. \nEmojis are set by a group called the Unicode Consortium, but tweaks can be made by companies like Apple. \nCopyright 2016 CNN.

      "text": "11/16/16 AT 9:44 PM Close \nWell, this is disappointing. Apple‚Äôs 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar just received a score of 1/10 for repairability from iFixit, a private company with experts who troubleshoot and repair devices. Given, its very low score, it‚Äôs very unlikely for owners to have their laptops repaired easily if they broke them. \nOn its official website, iFixit published a teardown report on the late 2016 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar. In its introduction, the company right away addressed what it found when it disassembled the device, saying it discovered that Apple‚Äôs new laptop is indeed ‚Äúthinner, lighter, faster‚Äù but is sadly less repairable than any other Pro laptops. \nFor the most part, the hardware specs really matched what Apple said about its latest MacBook offering when it launched the new iterations in late October. There is also a noticeable difference in the internal layout of components when compared with its predecessor‚Äôs internals. \nAfter disassembling the components of the new MacBook Pro, iFixit gave the device a very disappointing rating of 1/10. In case you are wondering why this is so, the repair and components company found out a lot of very tricky stuff that make it very unlikely for one to repair certain parts of the laptop when they are damaged. \nPerhaps the most difficult to replace component is the dynamic strip of OLED display called Touch Bar. When iFixit removed this part, it easily broke while it was being dismantled from the chassis. MacRumors has learned that even the flex cable that connects the Touch Bar to the mainboard was very difficult to remove since its wraps underneath the touch strip. Related Stories",

      "text": "Chinese iPhone owners are reporting that their iPhone 6 and 6s devices are abruptly shutting down, and Beijing wants to know why.\nEchoing problems in the US earlier this year, the complaints have led the China Consumers Association, a consumer watchdog group affiliated with China‚Äôs State Council (chaired by vice premier Li Keqiang), to send a letter (link in Chinese) to Apple demanding an explanation. The incident marks another blow to the hardware company as its glory days in China begin to fade.\nVarious Chinese social media users have reported in recent weeks that their devices abruptly power off when their battery is at 50% to 60% capacity. One page on Weibo containing posts with the hashtag #iPhone6sËá™Âä®ÂÖ≥Êú∫# (iPhone 6s shuts down automatically) has generated more than 10 million views and nearly 20,000 comments.\nOne Shanghainese consumer named Li Wei (link in Chinese) told the state-affiliated publication The Paper that the iPhone 6s he purchased from an official Apple Store had shut down abruptly three times since October 2015, all while the battery was at 20% capacity or higher. When Li went to an Apple authorized reseller to fix the problem, the store told him to first perform a factory reset on the phone, and if the problem persisted, he would have to pay 2000 yuan ($291) for a repair. Alternatively, Li could purchase a new phone.\n‚ÄúI bought the iPhone6s over a year ago when it started to automatically shut down at 30% charged last month, [and] now it will only turn on again when its charging‚Äù one commenter wrote on Weibo (link in Chinese, registration required). Another suggested the problem might not be an issue with the battery, writing: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve changed [the battery] but the phone keeps shutting down at 50% charged, what crap!‚Äù\nPrompted by the social media backlash, the China Consumers Association wrote a letter (link in Chinese, registration required) to Apple dated Nov. 15, demanding it explain the cause of the malfunctions. The letter urged the company to reply within 10 business days:\nRecently, this organization has continued to receive reports from consumers stating their iPhone 6 and 6s devices will automatically shut down when the battery still has 50-60% capacity. The shutdown problem persists after upgrading the phone‚Äôs software. [Other times] when the temperature is too warm or cool it will automatically shut down, [or] after the device automatically shuts down it will not turn on again unless it is charging. Media have reported all of these phenomena. \nSince a considerable number of consumers in China own the iPhones 6 and 6s, and number of people reporting these people is also large, in order to to protect the legal rights of consumers, the China Consumer Association asks that you carry out an investigation that can answer the following questions about the abnormal automatic shutdown of the iPhones 6 and 6s devices: \nWhat is causing the iPhone 6 and 6s devices to automatically shutdown? Is there a problem with the battery? How will you deal with the shutdown problems reported by consumers? What measures will you take to fix the shutdown problem, if there is an extremely large number of cases? iPhone 6 and 6s owners outside of China have also complained about similar battery drain issues in the past. In early 2016, the company published a support document acknowledging the issue, suggesting it could be caused by a time zone error. The document does not appear to be accessible currently, and it‚Äôs unclear why this issue has surfaced in China now. Apple did not respond to questions about the reports or letter. \nThe letter comes at a difficult time for the Cupertino, California, hardware giant. The company‚Äôs sales have been lagging in China‚Äîthe country has dropped from its second-largest market in revenue to its third largest . Meanwhile, the Chinese government appears eager to see the company‚Äôs fortunes fade in the country. Amid a larger crackdown on foreign companies entering the media industry, Apple shut down its iBooks and iTunes movie store in China this year.",

      "text": "Giving to charity is easier than ever thanks to Apple Pay Credit: Apple \nNEW YORK ‚Äî Apple is making it easier for people to give to charities by expanding its Apple Pay payments service to nonprofits. \nApple Pay is mostly known for enabling purchases at retail stores with the tap of an iPhone , although the service can also be used for online transactions on apps and websites. Apple had limited this to buying goods and services ‚Äî until now. \nThe American Red Cross , UNICEF and 17 other nonprofits will accept Apple Pay starting Monday . At least five more are coming soon. \nApple Pay can speed transactions because people don‚Äôt have to re-enter credit card and contact information, though people need to enable the service first. Apple says that websites and apps accepting Apple Pay report seeing twice as many people complete transactions, compared with other payment methods. \nAmericans are just starting to warm up to mobile payment services such as Apple Pay. One of the chief hurdles is the fact that for in-store transactions, it‚Äôs not that difficult to pull out a plastic card to pay. And many merchants still do not accept such mobile payments. Although usage is growing, mobile payments are still a small portion of overall sales. \nHere‚Äôs a full list of charities participating: American Red Cross ",

      "text": "Apple Reportedly Integrating Augmented Reality Tech Into iPhone‚Äôs Camera App Posted by Rajesh Pandey on Nov 17, 2016 | No Comments tweet \nBusiness Insider reports that Apple is working on integrating augmented reality tech into the camera app of the iPhone. It was previously reported that Apple was working on special augmented reality powered glasses similar to Google Glass. \nThe effort to integrate AR into the iOS camera app is being led by a team that comprises of various startups that Apple has acquired over the years. This includes the likes of FaceShift, Metaio, Flyby Media, and more. \nApple‚Äôs aim with integrating AR into the camera app on the iPhone is to make it possible for people to point it at objects and have it recognised automatically. The company is also considering adding the ability to automatically detect people‚Äôs faces and provide with various tools to manipulate them. Apple had acquired a startup called FaceShift with similar technology in 2015. \nEventually, once Apple releases the above said AR features for the iPhone camera app, it will also release an SDK for app developers to take advantage of the new feature. By opening access to developers, Apple will greatly widen the possibilities of what AR integration would be able to achieve inside the iPhone‚Äôs camera app. It is likely that we will see Apple announce AR integration into the camera app in iOS with the next major release of the OS. \nTalking about the recent rumor of Apple building its own pair of smart glasses , Business Insider suggests that it is not as far away into the future as the original report had claimed. Instead, the project is already at a ‚Äúmore advanced stage in which Apple is exploring production.‚Äù This speculation is based on the fact that Apple hired John Border in September. Border‚Äôs LinkedIn profile shows him being a ‚Äúsenior optics manufacturing exploration engineer‚Äù at the company, with his bio describing him an expert ‚Äúin the field of head-worn displays, plastic optics manufacturing, camera systems, and image sensors.‚Äù \nAre you looking forward to Apple adding AR integration into the iPhone‚Äôs camera app? Or do you think AR is just a gimmick? ",

      "text": "11/16/16 AT 10:40 PM Close \nWhen Apple introduced its new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, the Cupertino giant made it clear that only a couple of apps will have Touch Bar support at launch. This week as the first batch of deliveries arrive to customers, more apps are getting updated to obtain support for the functional OLED strip atop the physical keys of the keyboard. The newest app to receive an update is Airmail. \nAccording to Forbes , the macOS email client, Airmail, just received an update this Tuesday, and it is one that is quite important to owners of the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar laptops. Update 3.2 comes not only with certain tweaks and fixes, it also brings support for the dynamic touch strip of the new laptops. \nOnce the updated version is installed, users can set shortcuts and actions for the Airmail app by clicking View then selecting Customize Touch Bar. Upon clicking this option, the customization window for the app will appear, and this is where users can drag their buttons for the Touch Bar. Once all buttons are set, users can save the configuration by clicking the Done button. Related Stories",

      "text": "‚Äì A + Apple researching methods to monitor Parkinson's disease with Apple Watch and iPhone By Mikey Campbell \nWednesday, November 16, 2016, 08:19 pm PT (11:19 pm ET) \nIn a potential expansion to its current health and wellness offerings, headlined by ResearchKit and HealthKit, Apple is reportedly investigating the viability of employing Apple Watch and iPhone in real-time monitoring of patients with Parkinson's disease. \n\n\n\n\nAccording to sources speaking to Fast Company , Apple's internal project seeks to determine whether Apple Watch and iPhone can be used to passively monitor Parkinson's symptoms. Such data could be used to better facilitate medicine management, especially for Parkinson's patients who often go months between seeing their physician.\n\nWhile the project is ongoing, Apple hopes to build a portfolio of research proving the efficacy of mobile monitoring, the report said.\n\nThe initiative is being managed by Dr. Stephen Friend, cofounder of biomedical research company and early ResearchKit partner Sage Bionetworks. Before taking a post on Apple's health team in June, Friend previously served as a medical technology advisor to the Cupertino tech giant.\n\nFriend is well versed in Parkinson's monitoring and treatment. In 2015, Sage Bionetworks teamed up with the University of Rochester to build the framework of a Parkinson's study , one of the first ResearchKit projects to debut last year. The company also worked on a breast cancer study alongside Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, UCLA Fielding School of Public Health and Penn Medicine.",

      "title": "More Problems for Apple's iPhone 6 and 6S in China | Digital Trends",
      "text": "Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends \nSomething odd is happening with iPhone 6 and 6S devices in China ‚Äî they‚Äôre randomly shutting down. \nIt‚Äôs becoming such a big problem that the China Consumers Association (CCA) has asked Apple to look into the issue, which has affected a ‚Äúconsiderable number‚Äù of people according to Reuters . The devices shut down and do not turn on again, despite the battery still having about 50 to 60 percent of its juice. Plugging in a charger doesn‚Äôt help, and reports suggest plugging into a computer is the only way to turn the device back on. \nMore: Apple has begun its massive purge of apps from the App Store \n‚ÄúIn view that Apple iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s series cell phones in China have a considerable number of users, and the number of people who‚Äôve reported this problem is rather many, China Consumer Association has already made a query with Apple,‚Äù the organization says on its website . \nApple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The CCA is state approved, but it is not an official regulatory association. \nApple has been having a tough time expanding in China, due to heavy competition from Chinese smartphone manufacturers. In June, the Cupertino, California company had to stop selling iPhone 6 devices due to complaints by another manufacturer that Apple stole its design . Apple is appealing the decision. \nMore: China to Trump: Don‚Äôt be ‚Äònaive,‚Äô or iPhone sales could suffer \nThe iPhone maker may run into more problems next year if President-elect Donald Trump is set on erecting trade barriers with China. The country has threatened that iPhone sales will ‚Äú suffer a setback ‚Äù if Trump goes ahead with high tariffs on Chinese imports. \n‚ÄúNone of the previous presidents were bold enough to launch an all-out trade war against China,‚Äù according to the state-run Global Times. ‚ÄúThey all opted for a cautious line since it‚Äôs most consistent with the overall interests of the U.S., and it‚Äôs most acceptable to U.S. society.‚Äù Also watch: Apple iPhone 6S Plus vs. Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge ",

      "text": "Apple believes that augmented reality is the future and that it could have the potential to do better than virtual reality. Given the success of Pokemon GO, we‚Äôre inclined to agree, although we guess we‚Äôve yet to see a truly killer VR application. Now according to Business Insider , Apple could be considering integrating AR tech into the iPhone‚Äôs camera app. We‚Äôre not sure what kind of features Apple is planning by integrating AR into the camera app, but we can only assume it could help overlay information on the screen, such as location, maybe some tips on how to make the photo look better, put objects inside the photo, and so on. It could also potentially be used for navigation purposes where the camera app could also point users to their destination, or bring up coupons or deals when pointing at shops.\nBasically the possibilities are endless, and with Apple‚Äôs CEO Tim Cook waxing poetic about the technology , if anything it would be more surprising if they did not find a way to use it in their products and services. Let‚Äôs not forget that Apple also acquired AR company Metaio a while back, furthering their AR efforts.\nNaturally this should be taken with a grain of salt, but we have heard recent rumors that Apple could be considering using AR to create smart glasses or for a car driving system .\nFiled in",

That couldn't be more true when Apple replaced the peach emoji that looked like a butt with a more realistic-looking peach. Luckily, Apple realized it had made a terrible, terrible mistake and changed it back in the iOS 10.2 beta 33. In fact, the peach looks more butt-y than before. nothing makes me happier than apple's willingness to accommodate our obsession with butts pic.twitter.com/4grBx3vIjx \n‚Äî Anthony Padilla (@anthonypadilla) November 15, 2016 \nTwitter users instantly expressed their enthusiasm for the news, because nothing raises the spirits of the people like suggestive cartoon fruit... It only took a couple of weeks to get Apple to make the peach emoji look like a butt again. Let's harness that energy, y'all. \n‚Äî Andi Zeisler (@andizeisler) November 16, 2016 The peach emoji is coming back so like I guess all is well in the world?!üçëüçëüçë \n‚Äî JOSLYN DAVIS (@JoslynDavis) November 16, 2016 iOS 10.2 beta 3.

      "text": "Apple Wants OLED in iPhones, But Most Suppliers Aren‚Äôt Ready Yet Mark Gurman November 16, 2016 ‚Äî 10:50 PM EST Display makers seen struggling to meet iPhone output in 2017 OLED displays are more energy efficient, provide deeper colors \nApple's new iPhone 7. Photographer: SeongJoon Cho/Bloomberg \nApple Inc. has big plans to outfit its next iPhone with vibrant, energy-sipping organic LED displays, seeking to entice consumers with new technology that‚Äôs already been embraced by other high-end smartphone makers. \nThe trouble is that the four main suppliers for such components won‚Äôt have enough production capacity to make screens for all new iPhones next year, with constraints continuing into 2018, people familiar with the matter said, presenting a potential challenge for the Cupertino, California-based company. \nOLED screens are more difficult to produce, putting Apple at the mercy of suppliers that are still working to manufacture the displays in mass quantities, the people said. The four largest producers are Samsung Display Co., LG Display Co., Sharp Corp., and Japan Display Inc. While Samsung is on track to be the sole supplier for the new displays next year, the South Korean company may not be able to make enough due to low yield rates combined with increasing iPhone demand. \nThe supply constraints may force Apple to use OLED in just one version of the next-generation iPhone, push back adoption of the technology or cause other snags. \n\"Apple has already figured in there will be high demand for the OLED model and they‚Äôve also figured out there will be constraints to these panels,\" said Dan Panzica, a supply chain analyst at IHS Markit. The combination of Apple‚Äôs stringent quality requirements and the difficulty of producing OLED panels will likely lead to supply constraints, he said. \nApple plans to ship at least one new iPhone with an OLED screen next year, the 10th anniversary of the smartphone‚Äôs debut, people with knowledge of the matter said. A pair of other new iPhone models will likely feature screens that use older LCD technology, partly because there won‚Äôt be enough OLED displays to satisfy anticipated demand, according to KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. \n\"Display technology is still a pretty key driver of the purchasing experience,\" said Ben Bajarin, an analyst at Creative Strategies. Apple has previously used new display features as iPhone selling points. For example, the iPhone 4 in 2010 added Apple‚Äôs first Retina Display, the iPhone 5 in 2012 introduced the iPhone‚Äôs first display size increase, and the iPhone 6 in 2014 brought new 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch screen options. \nThe OLED iPhone, at least, will have a new look that extends glass from the display to the device‚Äôs back and edges, according to a person familiar with Apple‚Äôs plans. This all-glass design will have a virtual Home button embedded in an edge-to-edge screen, rather than a physical button that can be pressed, the person added. \nAn Apple spokeswoman declined to comment. \nApple typically introduces new technologies for its iPhones across all models when they‚Äôre unveiled every September, as it did for 3D Touch and Apple Pay. Using different core, user-facing technology in the same iPhone generation would be an unusual step. All current iPhone 7 models have LCD screens. Still, Apple may have no choice. \nSharp and Japan Display are still working on test procedures for OLED screens and have said that they are on track for production in 2018, while seeking to manage expectations. \n‚ÄúThere is all this talk about OLEDs, but I‚Äôm not at all sure about their future,‚Äù Sharp President Tai Jeng Wu told reporters recently. ‚ÄúWe need to work on developing the technology, but whether we can succeed remains to be seen.‚Äù \nShuji Aruga, president of Japan Display, said earlier this month that he sees a 50-50 split between OLEDs and LCDs that will be used in high-end phone screens. ‚ÄúWe are not yet at a stage where we can decisively choose between OLED and LCD,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe need to develop OLED capacity so that we are not caught empty-handed if the technology does end up capturing a majority.‚Äù \nLG Display is the laggard. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs true that we were late in OLED investment for smaller electronics devices compared to that of televisions,‚Äù LG Display Chief Executive Officer Han Sang-beom said earlier this year, adding that the company now understands OLED‚Äôs importance for smartphones. \nApple and Samsung have an exclusive OLED supply deal for 2017, people with knowledge of the agreement said. Still, that doesn‚Äôt guarantee the South Korean technology giant will have enough output to meet demand for the revamped iPhone. For example, Samsung‚Äôs OLED supplies have even been constrained for its own mobile division‚Äôs smartphones. A representative for Samsung Display declined to comment. \nApple‚Äôs initial OLED order from Samsung is for 100 million units over one year, according to people familiar with the agreement. Even so, Samsung will probably only be able to deliver a portion of that for the 2017 holiday period. Apple shipped about 75 million iPhones in the 2015 holiday quarter, and some analysts estimate that as many as 90 million could be sold in the last three months of 2017.

If Samsung sees supply constraints in its ramp up of OLED panels for the fall 2017 iPhone launch, Apple may not have another major provider to fall back on. That‚Äôs why Apple usually has multiple suppliers for key components. For example, it has sourced LCD panels from all of the major Asia-based display makers. For next year, at least, it appears that OLED supply chain may be a single-company affair.\nApple has run into supply problems before, for example when it sought to adopt tough sapphire screens for the iPhone 6 in 2014. Even though it financed a sole supplier, GT Advanced Technologies Inc., to ramp up production and deliver the material, the manufacturer wasn‚Äôt able to deliver enough sapphire glass of acceptable quality. As a result, Apple abandoned plans to use stronger screens, and GT Advanced ended up ",

      "text": "Bank rally fades; Nvidia, Apple lead tech gains By The Associated Press   10:24 p.m. Email Newsletters \nSign up for one of our email newsletters. Updated 3 hours ago NEW YORK ‚Äî Stocks finished mixed Wednesday as banks returned some of the huge gains they've made since the presidential election last week. Technology and consumer stocks climbed. The dollar continued to appreciate against other currencies, reaching its highest mark in 13 years. Banks took the biggest losses as a seven-day rally in that sector petered out. Industrial companies, also big gainers since the election, traded lower as well. The price of oil gave back some of its enormous gain from the day before. Graphics processor maker Nvidia and household names including Apple and Microsoft led technology companies higher. Rising stocks outnumbered decliners. ‚ÄúI think you've got a lot of people who were caught sleeping last week and are trying to use the weakness to put their money to work,‚Äù said Paul Hickey, co-founder of Bespoke Investment Group LLC, a research firm in Harrison, N.Y. ‚ÄúPeople with money on the sidelines are looking for a place to put it. They're looking for names that haven't rallied as much, and ones that have rallied are taking a bit of a breather.‚Äù The dollar has been very strong in recent years, just not this strong, and it's been pretty stable compared with other currencies. But in the wake of the election, investors think the economy might grow a bit faster and inflation might pick up. ‚ÄúWhat's pushed the dollar higher here in the short term is the Trump win, particularly combined with (Republicans) holding on to the Senate,‚Äù said Scott Wren, a senior global equity strategist at the Wells Fargo Investment Institute. Still, Wren doesn't think the dollar will rise much further. The Dow Jones industrial average slid 54.92 points, or 0.3 percent, to 18,868.14. The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 3.45 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,176.94. The Nasdaq composite picked up 18.96 points, or 0.4 percent, to 5,294.58. After a long losing streak before the election, the Dow had risen for seven days in a row through Tuesday and set several all-time highs. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq have also made large gains and are near the records they set this fall. JPMorgan Chase led banks lower as it fell $1.96, or 2.5 percent, to $77.40, and Morgan Stanley lost 81 cents, or 2 percent, to $39.19. Banks are coming off their best single week since the financial crisis as investors hope for higher interest rates and more profits from lending, as well as cutbacks in regulations that could boost bank profits. The ICE U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the dollar against six other currencies, rose to its highest level since April 2003. The dollar is rising in part because investors think the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates at a faster pace in response to inflation stemming from the increased spending that President-elect Donald Trump has proposed. A stronger dollar hurts companies that do a lot of business overseas because it makes their products more expensive, and it affects their earnings when they are translated from other currencies back into U.S. dollars. However, it makes imported goods cheaper for consumers in the country. ‚ÄúYou've got a little bit of a hangover from the Trump rally today,‚Äù said Steven Chia¬≠varone, a New York-based associate portfolio manager at Federated Investors Global Allocation Fund. ‚ÄúThe market priced in pretty quickly a very rosy scenario, but now you're seeing a little doubt ... as he puts together his team.‚Äù Technology companies moved upward as they continued a rally from a day earlier. Graphics processor maker Nvidia rose $5.44, or 6.3 percent, to $91.63 after it announced a collaboration with Microsoft, and Apple picked up $2.93, or 2.7 percent, to $110.04. Tech stocks had weakened since the election. Trump's policies might affect their sales in China and other key markets, and a big surge this summer had brought some technology stocks to all-time highs. More Business",

      "text": "Apple‚Äôs OLED Suppliers Won‚Äôt Be Able to Meet Demand for 2017 iPhone   8:40 pm PST by Husain Sumra Apple's four main OLED suppliers won't be able to meet the production capacity necessary to match demand for the 2017 iPhone, according to a new report from Bloomberg . Supply constraints are expected to last until 2018. OLED screens are more difficult to produce in mass quantities than LCD screens, which means Apple is \"at the mercy\" of suppliers who are willing to produce them in the necessary quantities. Bloomberg notes that the supply constraints may force Apple to either restrict OLED use to one version of the next iPhone or push adoption of the technology back. While Apple and Samsung have an exclusive OLED deal for 2017, it doesn't guarantee that the company will be able to meet Apple's demand. For example, Samsung's OLED supplies have already been constrained due to its own smartphones, like the Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge. Apple's OLED screen order is for displays larger than 5 inches, according to Bloomberg . The Cupertino company has ordered an initial round of 100 million units over the next year, but Samsung will only be able to provide a portion of that for the Holliday 2017 quarter. Apple may face troubles if Samsung can't meet its demand. If Samsung sees supply constraints in its ramp up of OLED panels for the fall 2017 iPhone launch, Apple may not have another major provider to fall back on. That‚Äôs why Apple usually has multiple suppliers for key components. For example, it has sourced LCD panels from all of the major Asia-based display makers. For next year, at least, it appears that OLED supply chain may be a single-company affair. On Tuesday, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said that he believes Apple will launch an all-new OLED iPhone alongside 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch LCD iPhones. While all three iPhones are likely to sport a new design with a glass back, the new OLED iPhone will have a curved edge-to-edge display. Kuo previously said the OLED iPhone would sport a 5.8-inch display with a bezel-free design. 1 hour ago at 08:57 pm Funny I thought Tim was the supply chain guru. I'd say this is a failure. Rating: 5 Votes MH01 1 hour ago at 08:53 pm How shocking, a news story that iPhone supply is constrained Seems like it's part of the marketing build up each year....quick I need to pre-order....even though buying online these days is the worst experience if you want to get a new product asap.... Rating: 4 Votes 1 hour ago at 08:51 pm BS! Complete and utter BS! Apple won't be using OLED displays ever. Ming Chi Kuo trolled the media saying the next iPhone will have OLED (buzz), and now he's making up excuses (kill). If Apple were to put an OLED in 2017, they would have decided about it in 2013, and primed the suppliers in 2014, tested in 2015, manufactured in 2016 to release in 2017. What do people think Apple is? A bunch of amateurs that decide their products roadmap 2 weeks before releasing them? But I'm waiting for that guy that will say the next iPhone will suck because it doesn't have an headphone jack.

Large tech conglomerates don't operate on spite - they operate on profit. Samsung is a major supplier to Apple.

Sounds like somebody is crying but it isn't Samsung. Yeah they had a big failure on their Note7 but believe it or not they are probably expecting to get back on the horse again with their next release. If Samsung simply can not produce enough OLED for everybody what do you want them to do? It doesn't sound like there is another company doing them right now. Should they sell them to Apple first instead of concentrating on getting their own phone line up back in order? Believe me Samsung would love to sell 100 million or more displays to Apple they make money this way. However if they can't do it then it isn't their fault that Apple has planned a product it can not meet demand for.

      "text": "Reddit \nOne long-running rumor for next year‚Äôs iPhone is the adoption of OLED screen panels . While the Apple Watch and the MacBook Pro‚Äôs Touch Bar use OLED technology, the iPhone has stuck with traditional LCD panels. A new report from Bloomberg , however, says that supply constraints may thwart Apple‚Äôs plan to switch to OLED panels next year‚Ä¶ \nAccording to the report, the four main suppliers for OLED displays won‚Äôt have enough production capacity to meet demand next year and further into 2018. This is primarily due to OLED screens being more difficult to produce than LCD panels. Right now, the four top suppliers for OLED panels are Samsung Display, LG Display, Sharp, and Japan Display. But at this point, Apple expects Samsung to be sole supplier in 2017. \nHow does this effect Apple‚Äôs plans? Bloomberg notes that the supply constraints may mean that Apple uses OLED in just one variant of the iPhone 8 . \nApple plans to ship at least one new iPhone with an OLED screen next year, the 10th anniversary of the smartphone‚Äôs debut, people with knowledge of the matter said. \nFurthermore, the OLED iPhone will feature an all-glass design with a virtual Home button embedded in an ‚Äúedge-to-edge‚Äù screen . We‚Äôve heard reports of these changes before, but today‚Äôs report adds more fuel to the fire. The dramatic revamp of the iPhone comes after Apple kept the design of the device largely the same with the iPhone 7, instead opting to focus on camera technology and color variants . \nToday‚Äôs report corroborates a note from KGI earlier this week, noting that the 2017 iPhone lineup will look like what‚Äôs seen below, with the dual camera set up staying exclusive to the 5.5-inch iPhone models. 4.7-inch iPhone with LCD display and single camera 5.5-inch iPhone model with LCD display and dual camera 5.5-inch iPhone model with OLED display and dual camera \nThe 2017 iPhone is expected to be introduced sometime in September, as is usually the case with new iPhone models. If the OLED iPhone comes in at a higher price point, would you shell out the cash for it? Let us know down in the comments‚Ä¶ Guides",

Apple reportedly plans to cut App Store video fees 0 Share: Up Next Is MacBook Pro perfect? No, but it's worth $3,000 to me \nApple is planning to cut in half the amount it charges to sell video services over the App Store, a move seen as assuaging concerns of its partners, Bloomberg reported Wednesday. \nThe tech titan plans to reduce the amount of revenue it collects from subscription video streaming apps from the current 30 percent to 15 percent, Bloomberg reported, citing unidentified people familiar with the company's plans. Apple takes a 30 percent cut of sales for app subscriptions, but if an app maker holds onto a subscriber for a year or longer, Apple's cut will shrink to 15 percent. \nThe concession could go a long way toward soothing the feelings of partners, who have long accused Apple of using the App Store as a means for stifling rival services. The move also underscores the growing importance video is playing to Apple, which next month will launch a new TV app that showcases TV shows and movies from apps that a customer subscribes to. \nApple representatives did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The government wants it gone. Taiwan asks Apple and Google to ditch Uber's app 0 Share: \nTaiwan wants Google and Apple's help to get rid of the Uber app. Photo by Carl Court, Getty Images \nTaiwan on Wednesday asked Apple and Google to step into its ongoing dispute with ride-hailing service Uber. \nTaiwanese officials want the two Silicon Valley tech giants to remove Uber from the App Store and Google Play respectively, according to Reuters . It is also seeking the removal of UberEats, the company's food delivery service, which launched in Taiwan on Tuesday. \nUber has caused uproar around the world as it disrupts existing transporation models and regulations in countries where it launches. From black-cab drivers in London and the taxi industry in France to blind people in New York and even its own drivers , the company is no stranger to regulatory and legal strife. \nThe company told Reuters that it is discussing the situation with Taiwanese authorities and that it complies with all local regulations. \nUber operates within Taiwan as a technology company, but the government has said that this is a misrepresentation of its service. It believes that instead Uber should be classified as a transportation company, which would mean it should have been paying more in taxes. \nUber, Google and Apple did not respond to requests for comment.

Apple's Jony Ive says the iPhone almost didn't happen 0 Share: \nApple Chief Design Officer Jonathan Ive (center) shares a laugh with actor Stephen Fry during a launch event in September. Photo by Stephen Lam, Getty Images \nWhat would the world be like without an iPhone? We apparently came very close to an existence without Apple's hit device. \nIn an interview published Tuesday by Dazed , Apple's chief design officer Jony Ive said the product could have fallen through. \n\"There were multiple stages while we were working on the phone when solving problems wasn't inevitable and we really did have concerns that it wasn't viable, that it wasn't going to work,\" Ive said. \nThe iPhone became influential technology he said, but it grew from a fragile idea. Still, that idea provided a roadmap to success for Apple. \n\"Ultimately we are able to develop hardware and software together to create a singular experience,\" he said. \nIve said there are plenty of ideas that Apple has prototyped but couldn't finish because some part of the technology isn't fully developed yet. \"So we put things to one side, knowing that at some point we will carry on working on them again,\" he said. \"It's not a question of this being right, it's just a question of when it's right.\" \nIve recently told CNET that the secret sauce in Apple products isn't just creating something new; it's the push to improve. \n\"We don't limit ourselves in how we will push -- if it's to a better place,\" Ive said. \"What we won't do is just do something different that's no better.\" ",

Photo by Daniel Van Boom/CNET \nFear not, iPhone users, the butt emoji is back. \nOf course, there is no actual butt emoji -- there are standards and practices against that sort of thing. But Apple 's initial iOS 10.2 update changed the peach emoji, a longtime representative of the behind, into less of a butt and into more of an actual peach. \nThat grave wrong, protested around social media , has now been undone. The third beta version of iOS 10.2, released today, brings back the peach we all know and love. And people are pretty excited. ",

Each product flaunts its best angle. And of course, every page has a glorious white background. Even the cover is a pure white. \nSome might find the price a little less pure. It's $300. You could see that as a bargain. It's roughly 67 cents per picture. \nIf you want to drive a better (but smaller) bargain, there's a mini version of the book for a mere $199. \nYou might still want to whisper to yourself in Jony Ive tones about the care that's gone into this book's design. \nApple's blurb offers that the book is \"printed on specially milled, custom-dyed paper with gilded matte silver edges, using eight color separations and low-ghost ink.\" More Technically Incorrect ",

Apple reportedly plans to cut App Store video fees 0 Share: Up Next Is MacBook Pro perfect? No, but it's worth $3,000 to me \nApple is planning to cut in half the amount it charges to sell video services over the App Store, a move seen as assuaging concerns of its partners, Bloomberg reported Wednesday. \nThe tech titan plans to reduce the amount of revenue it collects from subscription video streaming apps from the current 30 percent to 15 percent, Bloomberg reported, citing unidentified people familiar with the company's plans. Apple takes a 30 percent cut of sales for app subscriptions, but if an app maker holds onto a subscriber for a year or longer, Apple's cut will shrink to 15 percent. \nThe concession could go a long way toward soothing the feelings of partners, who have long accused Apple of using the App Store as a means for stifling rival services. The move also underscores the growing importance video is playing to Apple, which next month will launch a new TV app that showcases TV shows and movies from apps that a customer subscribes to. \nApple representatives did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Taiwan asks Apple and Google to ditch Uber's app 0 Share: \nTaiwan wants Google and Apple's help to get rid of the Uber app. Photo by Carl Court, Getty Images \nTaiwan on Wednesday asked Apple and Google to step into its ongoing dispute with ride-hailing service Uber. \nTaiwanese officials want the two Silicon Valley tech giants to remove Uber from the App Store and Google Play respectively, according to Reuters . It is also seeking the removal of UberEats, the company's food delivery service, which launched in Taiwan on Tuesday. \nUber has caused uproar around the world as it disrupts existing transporation models and regulations in countries where it launches. From black-cab drivers in London and the taxi industry in France to blind people in New York and even its own drivers , the company is no stranger to regulatory and legal strife. \nThe company told Reuters that it is discussing the situation with Taiwanese authorities and that it complies with all local regulations. \nUber operates within Taiwan as a technology company, but the government has said that this is a misrepresentation of its service. It believes that instead Uber should be classified as a transportation company, which would mean it should have been paying more in taxes. \nUber, Google and Apple did not respond to requests for comment.

Photo by Daniel Van Boom/CNET \nFear not, iPhone users, the butt emoji is back. \nOf course, there is no actual butt emoji -- there are standards and practices against that sort of thing. But Apple 's initial iOS 10.2 update changed the peach emoji, a longtime representative of the behind, into less of a butt and into more of an actual peach. \nThat grave wrong, protested around social media , has now been undone. The third beta version of iOS 10.2, released today, brings back the peach we all know and love. And people are pretty excited. ",

      "text": "Batteries 3 hours ago \nChinese iPhone owners are reporting that their iPhone 6 and 6s devices are abruptly shutting down, and Beijing wants to know why. \nEchoing problems in the US earlier this year, the complaints have led the China Consumers Association, a consumer watchdog group affiliated with China‚Äôs State Council (chaired by vice premier Li Keqiang), to send a letter (link in Chinese) to Apple demanding an explanation. The incident marks another blow to the hardware company as its glory days in China begin to fade. \nVarious Chinese social media users have reported in recent weeks that their devices abruptly power off when their battery is at 50% to 60% capacity. One page on Weibo containing posts with the hashtag #iPhone6sËá™Âä®ÂÖ≥Êú∫# (iPhone 6s shuts down automatically) has generated more than 10 million views and nearly 20,000 comments. \nOne Shanghainese consumer named Li Wei (link in Chinese) told the state-affiliated publication The Paper that the iPhone 6s he purchased from an official Apple Store had shut down abruptly three times since October 2015, all while the battery was at 20% capacity or higher. When Li went to an Apple authorized reseller to fix the problem, the store told him to first perform a factory reset on the phone, and if the problem persisted, he would have to pay 2000 yuan ($291) for a repair. Alternatively, Li could purchase a new phone. \n‚ÄúI bought the iPhone6s over a year ago when it started to automatically shut down at 30% charged last month, [and] now it will only turn on again when its charging‚Äù one commenter wrote on Weibo (link in Chinese, registration required). Another suggested the problem might not be an issue with the battery, writing: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve changed [the battery] but the phone keeps shutting down at 50% charged, what crap!‚Äù \nPrompted by the social media backlash, the China Consumers Association wrote a letter (link in Chinese, registration required) to Apple dated Nov. 15, demanding it explain the cause of the malfunctions. The letter urged the company to reply within 10 business days: \nRecently, this organization has continued to receive reports from consumers stating their iPhone 6 and 6s devices will automatically shut down when the battery still has 50-60% capacity. The shutdown problem persists after upgrading the phone‚Äôs software. [Other times] when the temperature is too warm or cool it will automatically shut down, [or] after the device automatically shuts down it will not turn on again unless it is charging. Media have reported all of these phenomena. \nSince a considerable number of consumers in China own the iPhones 6 and 6s, and number of people reporting these people is also large, in order to to protect the legal rights of consumers, the China Consumer Association asks that you carry out an investigation that can answer the following questions about the abnormal automatic shutdown of the iPhones 6 and 6s devices: What is causing the iPhone 6 and 6s devices to automatically shutdown? Is there a problem with the battery? How will you deal with the shutdown problems reported by consumers? What measures will you take to fix the shutdown problem, if there is an extremely large number of cases? \niPhone 6 and 6s owners outside of China have also complained about similar battery drain issues in the past. In early 2016, the company published a support document acknowledging the issue, suggesting it could be caused by a time zone error. The document does not appear to be accessible currently, and it‚Äôs unclear why this issue has surfaced in China now. Apple did not respond to questions about the reports or letter. \nThe letter comes at a difficult time for the Cupertino, California, hardware giant. The company‚Äôs sales have been lagging in China‚Äîthe country has dropped from its second-largest market in revenue to its third largest . Meanwhile, the Chinese government appears eager to see the company‚Äôs fortunes fade in the country. Amid a larger crackdown on foreign companies entering the media industry, Apple shut down its iBooks and iTunes movie store in China this year. Read full story",

It's time for Apple's design principles to be taught in the universities of the world. \nHere, then, is another step in the deification of the Apple brand. The company on Tuesday released a coffee-table book. \nIt's called \" Designed By Apple In California .\" It's full of sumptuous pictures of its meticulously crafted products of the last 20 years. \nEverything's shot with only perfection in mind. Each product flaunts its best angle. And of course, every page has a glorious white background. Even the cover is a pure white. \nSome might find the price a little less pure. It's $300. You could see that as a bargain. It's roughly 67 cents per picture. \nIf you want to drive a better (but smaller) bargain, there's a mini version of the book for a mere $199. \nYou might still want to whisper to yourself in Jony Ive tones about the care that's gone into this book's design. \nApple's blurb offers that the book is \"printed on specially milled, custom-dyed paper with gilded matte silver edges, using eight color separations and low-ghost ink.\" More Technically Incorrect ",
