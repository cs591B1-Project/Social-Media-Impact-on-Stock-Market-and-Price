      "text": "INTERVIEW-Turkey's Pegasus may postpone Boeing deliveries as costs weigh, CEO says Updated: November 25, 2016 — 8:35 AM EST Share \n(Adds executive comment, background) \nBy Ceyda Caglayan \nISTANBUL, Nov 25 (Reuters) - Turkish budget carrier Pegasus Airlines may postpone delivery of three new Boeing aircraft next year, lease some of its current fleet and sell older planes to cut costs after a difficult year for tourism, its chief executive said. \nPegasus, which competes with national carrier Turkish Airlines, has increased passenger numbers more slowly than planned this year as series of bombings, a failed coup in July and tension with Russia deterred tourists. A weak lira currency has driven up fuel costs and other expenses. \n\"We were going to take delivery of five planes ordered from Boeing next year. Two of them will come but three of them we may take later,\" Mehmet Nane told Reuters in an interview late on Thursday. \nPegasus initially expected passenger growth of 13-15 percent this year, then cut that target in August to 5-7 percent. Now, Nane said: \"Current developments show we will do better than our revisions.\" He did not elaborate. \nThe airline has been cutting costs by closing some less popular routes, he said. It is also leasing out two of its aircraft, complete with crew, maintenance and insurance - known in the airline industry as \"wet lease.\" \n\"If our planes are empty, why not?\" Nane said when asked if more lease deals were possible. Pegasus has a fleet of 77 aircraft, which is set to rise to 82 by year-end, not including next year's Boeing deliveries. \nPegasus plans to sell off older, less fuel-efficient planes as new ones arrive, Nane said. He does not expect the fleet to shrink overall. \nTOURISM SLUMP \nThe number of tourists visiting Turkey slumped 32 percent to 20.3 million people in the first nine months of the year. Relations with Russia, traditionally a major source of tourism, soured after Turkey shot down a Russian warplane over Syria last year. \nRival Turkish Airlines has also been hurt, postponing delivery of a total 39 aircraft from Airbus and Boeing due to arrive between 2018 and 2022. \nAnkara has worked to restore relations with Russia and Nane said he was optimistic that 2017 would be a better year. Pegasus was waiting for regulatory approval for 40 new routes and could open them as soon as it gets permission, he said. \n\"The majority of routes will be international. The new flights will be not just from Istanbul but Ankara, Izmir and Antalya too,\" he said.

      "text": "On Nov 23, shares of The Boeing Company ( BA - Free Report ) soared to a new 52-week high of $150.81, before closing the trading session at $149.74. The closing price of this aerospace and defense prime, which has a market cap of around $92.4 billion, reflects a year-to-date gain of roughly 3.6%.\nOver the past 52 weeks, Boeing’s shares have ranged from a low of $102.10 to a high of $150.81. The average volume of shares traded over the last three months is approximately 3.5 million.\nWhat's Driving Boeing Up?\nLast month, Boeing delivered stellar third-quarter 2016 results on the back of strong defense deliveries. Earnings beat expectations and were up an impressive 39.3% year over year. The company raised its core earnings and revenue guidance for 2016. Boeing expects to deliver 745–750 commercial airplanes in 2016, which would allow it to surpass its European rival Airbus Group SE’s ( EADSY - Free Report ) delivery numbers.\nRecently, Boeing received purchase commitment from Fiji Airways for five 737 MAX 8s. Again, in October, the company received an order from Swiss International Air Lines for one 777-300 ER (Extended Range) for $339.6 million at list prices. The company also inked a deal to sell a dozen of 787-9 Dreamliner jets to China Southern Airlines Co. Ltd. These contracts will contribute significantly to the company’s top line.\nIn the defense arena, Trump’s victory in the Presidential race may turn out to be a growth catalyst for Boeing and other defense majors like Lockheed Martin Corp. ( LMT - Free Report ) and Northrop Grumman Corp. ( NOC - Free Report ) . During his pre-electoral campaign, Trump had made promises of an increase in defense spending and expansion of troops. Moreover, a quick review of the past reveals that the Conservative Republican Party has usually advocated in favor of higher military spending.\nBoeing continues with investor-friendly moves, paying regular dividends and repurchasing shares, which reflect its strong operational performance. During the first nine months of 2016, Boeing paid $2,084 million in dividends, up 10.7% from the prior-year payout. The company also repurchased 51.4 million shares for $6.5 billion.\nBOEING CO Price and Consensus\nBOEING CO Price and Consensus | BOEING CO Quote:\nZacks Rank\nBoeing currently holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The company also inked a deal to sell a dozen of 787-9 Dreamliner jets to China Southern Airlines Co. Ltd. These contracts will contribute significantly to the company’s top line.In the defense arena, Trump’s victory in the Presidential race may turn out to be a growth catalyst for Boeing and other defense majors like Lockheed Martin Corp. ( LMT - Free Report ) and Northrop Grumman Corp. ( NOC - Free Report ) . During his pre-electoral campaign, Trump had made promises of an increase in defense spending and expansion of troops. Moreover, a quick review of the past reveals that the Conservative Republican Party has usually advocated in favor of higher military spending.Boeing continues with investor-friendly moves, paying regular dividends and repurchasing shares, which reflect its strong operational performance. During the first nine months of 2016, Boeing paid $2,084 million in dividends, up 10.7% from the prior-year payout. The company also repurchased 51.4 million shares for $6.5 billion. \nBOEING CO Price and Consensus \nBOEING CO Price and Consensus | BOEING CO Quote Zacks Rank Boeing currently holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

      "text": "Turkey's Pegasus may postpone Boeing deliveries as costs weigh, CEO says Fri Nov 25, 2016 8:36am EST [ - ] Text [ + ] \nBy Ceyda Caglayan \nISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkish budget carrier Pegasus Airlines may postpone delivery of three new Boeing aircraft next year, lease some of its current fleet and sell older planes to cut costs after a difficult year for tourism, its chief executive said. \nPegasus (PGSUS.IS: Quote ), which competes with national carrier Turkish Airlines (THYAO.IS: Quote ), has increased passenger numbers more slowly than planned this year as series of bombings, a failed coup in July and tension with Russia deterred tourists. A weak lira currency has driven up fuel costs and other expenses. \n\"We were going to take delivery of five planes ordered from Boeing next year. Two of them will come but three of them we may take later,\" Mehmet Nane told Reuters in an interview late on Thursday. \nPegasus initially expected passenger growth of 13-15 percent this year, then cut that target in August to 5-7 percent. Now, Nane said: \"Current developments show we will do better than our revisions.\" He did not elaborate. \nThe airline has been cutting costs by closing some less popular routes, he said. It is also leasing out two of its aircraft, complete with crew, maintenance and insurance - known in the airline industry as \"wet lease\". \n\"If our planes are empty, why not?\" Nane said when asked if more lease deals were possible. Pegasus has a fleet of 77 aircraft, which is set to rise to 82 by year-end, not including next year's Boeing deliveries. \nPegasus plans to sell off older, less fuel-efficient planes as new ones arrive, Nane said. He does not expect the fleet to shrink overall. ",

      "text": "Boeing 747 Supertanker Reuters \nThe American Supertanker plane landed at the Ben Gurion Airport in Israel on Friday evening.\nThe plane will help in putting out the fires that are raging across the country. It is expected to be operational on Saturday.\nThe Supertanker, the largest aerial firefighting aircraft in the world, is based on the Boeing 747 and is capable of carrying up to 19,600 gallons of retardant or water.\nThe Boeing 747-400 Supertanker is considered the most advanced firefighting aircraft in the world. It became operational last spring, replacing the 747-100 Supertanker which the United States sent to help Israel fight the 2010 Carmel wildfires.\nUnlike other firefighting aircraft, the Supertanker disperses water in a manner similar to falling rain over a wider area, rather than dumping the water over smaller areas. This approach is also safer for firefighters on the ground.\nThe Supertanker joins the international efforts to put out the fires in Israel. Russia, Cyprus, Greece, Turkey, and Italy have already sent firefighting planes. Israel also turned to France and Portugal for help Friday morning.\n(Arutz Sheva’s North American desk is keeping you updated until the start of Shabbat in New York. The time posted automatically on all Arutz Sheva articles, however, is Israeli time.) \n\n\nTags: forest fires , wildfires , Supertanker",

      "text": "The Russian Beriev Be-200 waterbomber\nPhoto Credit: Wikipedia commons\nThe Boeing 747 SuperTanker from Colorado Springs arrived in Israel Friday evening, prior to the start of the Sabbath in New York, to help extinguish the flames raging across the Jewish State.\nThe SuperTanker in the largest firefighting aerial aircraft in the world and is capable of continuing to battle flames even after dark, while carrying up to 19,600 gallons of water or fire retardant. It also produces enough pressure to create eight rounds of a rain-like environment in fighting any blaze. Along with the SuperTanker, the United States has said it is sending 50 firefighters to Israel to help battle the flames.\nPlanes arrived and were on the way from numerous other nations as well, with Russian sending several, several times over.\nThe local municipality in Haifa has video evidence that the fire which ignited near the main fire depot in the port city was set deliberately, a spokesperson for the Haifa Fire Department announced Friday.\nSpokesperson Uri Chibotaro told Israel’s Channel 2 television news the city has video evidence that proves the cause of the fire.\nChibotaro’s statement was backed up by Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon, who told Israel Radio in a separate interview that the blaze in Haifa — which sent some 75,000 residents of the city and its surrounds fleeing from their homes — there was proof indeed that the fire was an “intentional act of arson.”\nAt least 15 people are being held and are under investigation so far for allegations of arson and incitement to pyroterrorism, including six held in connection with the Haifa fire.\nBut at least two fire trucks were sent by the Palestinian Authority to help fight fires in Haifa, including those that reignited Friday due to the continued high winds. Palestinian Authority firefighting crews also worked together Friday morning with their Israeli counterparts to put out a fire in Sha’ar Haggai in the Jerusalem Hills.\nIn addition, Egypt has said it is sending two firefighting helicopters and Jordan has pledged several fire trucks to help its neighbor in the battle against the flames. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has accepted all offers.\nAt least 700 homes were damaged and around 37 were totally destroyed in Haifa. By early Friday afternoon all Haifa residents were allowed to return home, with the exception of those living in 13 buildings too dangerous to enter.\nPublic Security Minister Gilad Erdan had told reporters earlier in the day the findings of an investigation into the conflagration in the northern town of Zichron Ya’akov indicated that blaze, too, was caused by pyroterrorists.\nEyewitnesses also spotted Arab suspects igniting a fire in the forest near Beit Meir as firefighters were battling the towering blaze that had already started on the outskirts of the community. At least 10 homes in the moshav were later destroyed overnight by that fire and more were damaged, but police managed to catch the suspect who was seen nearby in the Jerusalem hills.\nHigh levels of air pollution and asbestos particles were found in at least six locations Friday morning in Beit Meir in testing by the Environmental Protection Ministry, following the fire. Sha’ar Haggai is not far.\nFriday afternoon a fire also broke out in the small northern moshav of Ya’ad, located about 300 meters north of the Jewish community of Yitzhar. In Ya’ad, residents were evacuated as a precaution.\nFirefighters battled a blaze near Yitzhar with two aerial firefighter aircraft as three fire trucks created a safety perimeter around the community, since access to Yitzhar is difficult at best. It was not yet clear how that fire got started.\nResidents in the Galilee town of Harashim were also evacuated Friday morning due to an outbreak of fire, which was fought from the sky by aerial firefighting aircraft, and by 15 firefighting teams on the ground.\nHana Levi Julian About the Author: Hana Levi Julian is a Middle East news analyst with a degree in Mass Communication and Journalism from Southern Connecticut State University.

      "text": "As the first 110-footlong wing skin panel for Boeing’s new 777X jet moved slowly across a mammoth new Everett factory building one morning earlier this month, a small crew walked alongside, watching for any possibility of an expensive collision.\nThe “spotters” escorted the panel’s bright-orange transport platform as it followed invisible tracks embedded in the concrete floor and slid with a tight fit into the big cylindrical autoclave where the part would bake to hardness.\nUntil the automated system for moving these big wing parts is proved, “we do have four people watching it,” said Darrell Chic, acting director of 777X wing fabrication. “But the intent is to work our way to autonomous and allow the navigation system to do its thing.”\nAutonomous.

Save 90% on digital access. The 777X Composite Wing Center, Boeing’s latest venture in advanced manufacturing, marks a significant step toward a future in which much of an aircraft factory’s work is done by automated machines and robots.\nOnce the wing skin was inside the giant pressurized oven, the lone operator at a computer station pushed a button. Lights flashed, a klaxon sounded.\nSlowly, a 55-ton, 28-foot-wide circular door slid into place and locked to form an airtight seal for the seven-hour baking cycle.\nEric Lindblad, the newly appointed head of the 777X program, said having machines load the wing parts autonomously is safer and more precise. There isn’t room for error inside the oven: When the long stiffening rods called stringers are baked in the autoclave, they’ll go in six at a time with just 3 inches of clearance between them.\nThe only necessary human will be the person at the computer.\n“There’ll be one guy that essentially runs this station,” Lindblad said.\nTroy Gottbreht closes the door of Boeing’s enormous autoclave at Boeing’s 777X Composite Wing Center, where a lower panel skin for a left wing is about to be cured, part of testing in Everett. (Ken Lambert/The Seattle Times) Stepping up the automation The trend toward automated manufacturing was evident already at Boeing’s older local plants.\nIn Frederickson, robots drill 80 percent of the holes in the 787 and 777 tails fabricated there.\nIn Auburn, robots drill the engine heat shields for the 787 and 777 jets, and will do the same for the 737 MAX. Another robot uses lasers to clean the dies used to shape the heat shields.\nIn its most productive factory, the 737 final-assembly plant in Renton, Boeing has replaced the traditional multistory fixtures used to hold wings in place during assembly with smaller, flexible, increasingly automated equipment as it ramps up toward an unprecedented output of 52 planes per month by 2018.\nIntroducing new automation is a challenge: In another new building in Everett, Boeing is struggling to smooth out the kinks in a robotic system for assembling the 777’s metal fuselage.\nStill, a new generation of airplanes like the 787 and 777X built with carbon-fiber-reinforced plastic composite structures have triggered a transformative shift taking automation to a new level.\nFabricating complete fuselage barrels or huge wings out of this material is simply not possible by hand. Only robots can lay up the strips of carbon fiber with enough speed and precision.\n\nBoeing’s 777X Composite Wing Center is in Everett. Production rates Mark Summers, head of technology at the U.K. government’s Aerospace Technology Institute, said increasing automation will allow Boeing and Airbus to ratchet up production rates without adding employees.\n“Jobs will not be lost, but there will not be so many new jobs created,” Summers said during a panel discussion at the Farnborough Air Show in July. “I don’t see it as an impact on the current aerospace workforce. There’s just fewer jobs in aerospace in the future.”\nHe foresees blue-collar machinist jobs increasingly supplanted by “more technologically focused” positions operating the machines.\nHowever wary machinists may be of what the new technology means for the future, Pete Goldsmith, who led automation-technology projects at local companies Electroimpact and Nova-Tech, and now works for a third, MTorres America, said he got “a universally positive reaction” from mechanics at both Airbus and Boeing when he installed equipment to do repetitive riveting.\n“That’s a job that beats you up all day every day,” Goldsmith said. “We were replacing an operation that was physically very debilitating for the mechanics.”\nGary Laws, a Boeing mechanic for more than two decades who operates computer-controlled machines assembling wings in Renton, said automation makes his job much easier.\nAnd if this region wants new work in aerospace, he sees no choice but to embrace the shift.\n“It’s the way it has to be,” said Laws. “Technology is obviously going to be the future.”\nToday, the current 777’s metal wing parts are made largely by machinists in Auburn and Frederickson, then assembled into a wing by machinists in Everett.\nThough Boeing doesn’t provide a detailed breakdown of employment figures, this work certainly provides hundreds of jobs.\nWith the new 777X, that work changes dramatically. But it does stay here.\nBoeing is spending $1 billion to make the giant 777X carbon fiber wing in-house , rather than outsourcing the wing to Mitsubishi as it did on the 787.\nLindblad said that after a production ramp-up that will take a few years, at peak the new wing center will employ somewhere between 600 and 900 people.\n\nAn inspection station where robots check for invisible flaws in wing parts fabricated at the 777X Composite Wing Center (Ken Lambert/The Seattle Times) Making test parts The first production 777X parts that will fly on an airplane won’t be made before April. Until then workers in the wing center are making test parts, used to certify and fine-tune the new manufacturing process.\nWith wing skin No. 1 in the autoclave over on the fabrication side of the wing center, Jerry Schultz operated an Electroimpact machine making wing skin No. 2.\nWhite lab coats are required in this “clean room” environment, where an overhead robot like a giant tape dispenser zips back and forth along a 110-footlong mold, building up the skin panel layer by layer.\nAs the robottraverses the part at various angles, it lays down plies of epoxy resin-infused carbon fiber in about 300 separately programmed runs.\nBetween setup, inspections and the robot work, completing a wing skin this way takes six shifts over three days.\nThe goal is to have just two people operating the cell, Boeing said, with possibly another worker floating between it and an adjacent cell also making wing skins.\nNearby, similar big Electroimpact machines are making the first 777X spars — the long, U-shaped, single-piece beams to whichthe leading and trailing edges of each wing attach.\nAgain, just three people will operate a pair of these spar manufacturing cells, says Boeing. The spars will then be inspected by robots that use an ultrasonic probe to check for invisible flaws in the material.\nAn exception to the full automation is the way Boeing is producing four of the 43 stringers, the rods that stiffen each 777X wing. These four are partly made by hand because of their more complex shape.\nA half-dozen workers — five of them women, who are often preferred by manufacturers for jobs that require meticulous handwork — stood on each side of a long, thin stringer tool, positioning 4-foot-long ribbons of uncured, textilelike carbon fiber.\nWhen they’d lain out each piece of fabric by hand, an overhead machine swung over and pressed down to secure it for curing.\n“For this particular shape … it turns out to be more cost-effective to do it this way,” Lindblad said.\n\nBoeing employee Jerry Schultz examines a skin panel that’s been fabricated layer by layer at the wing center. (Ken Lambert/The Seattle Times) Labor-intensive process It’s a mistake to think robots can do it all, said Ben Hempstead, chief of staff and lead mechanical engineer at aerospace-tooling designer Electroimpact.\nAfter these 777X skin panels, spars and stringers are fabricated in the wing center, Boeing will deliver them to the main Everett factory building where mechanics will first assemble the pieces into a basic wing box, then add the folding wingtip and the leading- and trailing-edge control surfaces.\nThat assembly process is inherently more labor-intensive.\n“With wing-box assembly, if in the future it’s half-automated, that’ll blow my mind,” said Hempstead, whose company supplies Boeing and also provided much of the equipment Airbus to build the composite wing of the A350 .\n“Many of the steps require skill and judgment and are very hard to automate,” he said.\nHempstead said Boeing asked Electroimpact to look at automating one specific 737 wing process in Renton that’s done today by about a dozen mechanics.\n“We couldn’t figure out how to do it faster with machines,” Hempstead said.\nAnd don’t even think about robots doing intricate jobs like installing hydraulic tubes and electrical wiring in the crowded space of an airplane wheel well.\n“Oh, man, nobody has even talked about automating that,” Hempstead said. “I can’t even envision how you’d do it.”\nLeading automation firms After World War II, Boeing gave Washington state a thriving middle class, allowing blue-collar workers — some with only a high-school education — to live the American dream.\nAs robots revolutionize the industry, the region has become a hotbed of leading aerospace-automation firms — including Electroimpact, Nova-Tech and MTorres America as well as Janicki Industries in Sedro-Woolley — that are hiring young engineers as fast as they can.\nBut is a golden age of manual labor ending with Boeing’s automation drive?\nIn 2005, almost 3,500 machinists in Renton produced 21 single-aisle 737s per month, according to employment data filed with the state.\nIn 2014, just over 6,000 machinists there produced exactly twice as many.\nWhile production rose 100 percent, employment of machinists rose 75 percent.\nAs robotic systems and the automated processing of carbon fiber proliferates, that gap is certain to widen.\nWhile Boeing employed more than 100,000 in Washington state in the late 1990s, it seems unlikely those days are ever coming back. Its payroll here is down to about 73,000 today.\nYet that’s still a big workforce, crucially important to the economy. And well-paid manual jobs remain a vital thread in the social fabric of the state.\n“We can’t all be baristas and software engineers,” said Electroimpact’s Hempstead.\nAt the industry discussion of automation in Farnborough, Craig Turnbull, director of engineering at Electroimpact U.K. who oversees the company’s work at the Airbus wing plant in Broughton, Wales, emphasized that “there is a point where man and machine have to meet.”\nEven in a highly robotized auto plant, he said, the car radio is installed by a mechanic. It’s too difficult for a robot.\nAnd when it comes to hiring an operator for this new equipment, he suggested looking to machinists.\n“The best person to operate a machine that drills holes is someone who has done it for 20 years by hand,” Turnbull said. “They know what they are looking for. They are then becoming more of a quality-control person than actually pushing the drill through a hole.”\nTo prepare the next generation of factory workers for such jobs, the state is pushing STEM education (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) and providing community-college-level training for hands-on careers.\nBecoming a machine operator will probably require a two-year associate degree with course work on the basics of electromechanics.\n“These are some of the highest skilled and best compensated jobs in the factory,” Hempstead said.\nJohn Janicki, president of Janicki Industries, sees the drive toward more automation speeding up, “driven by the need to get the price down.”\nThough expensive to install, he said, robotic systems should allow plane makers to sell more jets over a production run that can last more than 20 years.\n“If you amortize all the equipment over the life of the program, it’s not that big a deal,” Janicki said.\nHis firm — currently employing about 750 people in the state and expanding — still regularly hires local people straight out of high school and trains them to operate its sophisticated machines.\nAnd he points to a big upside for the Pacific Northwest in having the 777X wing center: After investing so heavily, Boeing needs to use it to the fullest.\n“It’s absolute state of the art. It’s not going anywhere,” said Janicki. “You have all that equipment and the personnel trained to use it. It’ll build 777s, yes. But 50 years from now, they’ll still be building something in that plant.”\nDominic Gates: 206-464-2963 or dgates@seattletimes.com  ",

      "text": "Flickr/Aero Icarus \nTwelve years after Boeing discontinued the 757, the long-time 'tweener in the company's lineup is still popular among U.S. airlines.\nAmerican, Delta, and United all operate large fleets of the airplane.\nEven though the Renton, Washington-based plane maker booked more than 1,000 orders for the jets over its two decades in production, it was never a hot seller. \nBy the early 2000's, sales of the 757 had all but dried up, and Boeing put the plane out to pasture in 2004. \nAlthough many of the planes are pushing 25 years of service, airlines are hanging onto their 757s. For instance, Delta, who has spent big bucks on a fleet of new jets, recently refurbished the cabins of its aging 757s instead of replacing them with newer planes.\nSo why are its customer's so loyal? Is the 757 that good? To get some answers, Business Insider recently spoke with author and Boeing 757 pilot Patrick Smith about the plane.\n\"There's no denying the 757 is an old plane that was designed in the late 1970s, but the versatility of the plane is remarkable and unmatched,\" Smith, the author of the book Cockpit Confidential , told Business Insider in an interview.\"It's profitable on both short-haul domestic as well as trans-Atlantic routes.\"\nFlickr/Aero Icarus During it's production life, the 757 was always a bit of an oddity — a 'tweener of sorts. It's larger and offers greater range than the average narrow body jet, but smaller and cheaper to operate than a wide-body. Boeing and its customers, for many years, didn't quite know how to take full advantage of the plane's capabilities. However, when they did figure it out, it became an integral part of the operators' fleets.\nBoeing is currently marketing a new stretched variant of its long-serving 737 — called the MAX 9 — as a potential replacement for the 757. Now, there's talk that Boeing may make the 737 even larger to get closer to the 757's capacity.\n\"Boeing is trying to push the 737 as a viable 757 replacement,\" Smith said, \"In some respects it can and in some respects it can't.\"\nFor instance, the 737 simply isn't capable of the same kind of engine performance as the 757 .\nAccording to Smith, the 737 falls way short of the 757 in terms of runway performance. The 737 requires a much higher takeoff speed and much more runway to get off the ground.\n\"The 757 can be off the ground in 4,000 ft. and under 140 knots,\" he told us. However, Smith recounts being in the cockpit jump seat of a 737 as two other pilots were flying. During takeoff, the author noticed that the plane didn't lift off until 160 knots and used up much more runway.\nFurthermore, the 757 can comfortably climb straight to its cruising altitude. On the other hand, the 737 requires a step climb procedure that calls for the plane to climb to a certain altitude and burn off some fuel to lighten the load before climbing to a higher altitude.\nRunway performance matters. Especially when it comes to the type of flying the 757 and the 737 are asked to perform — trans-continental or oceanic flights with a full payload from smaller secondary airports.\nFlickr/Aero Icarus \" The 737 falls short when you're trying fly it longer haul, coast to coast. It can do it, but not by much,\" Smith said. In addition, when it comes to flying across the Atlantic, \"there's concern in the winter, when there are ferocious head winds, the 737 may need to stop for fuel.\" \nThe reality is that Smith believes the Boeing 737 is a good plane, but is being asked to take on a mission the design wasn't meant to perform.\n\"The Boeing 737 was essentially conceived as a small regional jet nearly five decades ago,\" Smith told us. \"It's an extremely popular plane, but it's being asked to perform missions it wasn't designed for.\"\nAs a result, Boeing is simply not in a position to bolt bigger engines onto the 737. Since its introduction in the 1960s, Boeing has been installing larger and larger engines on the 737 as the size of the plane grew. Unfortunately, the amount of room underneath the wing hasn't changed. Thus, Boeing has all but maxed out on the size of the engines it can mount on the 737 without completely redesigning the plane's under carriage.\nInstead of a stretched 737, Smith believes Boeing should have gone for an updated version of the 757 at some point during its production run.\n\"Somewhere along the way, had Being just re-engined the 757 with a new cockpit and new internal systems, it could have been a big hit,\" Smith told us. \nIn a statement to Business Insider, a Boeing spokesperson wrote:\n\"The 737 MAX will extend the Next-Generation 737 range advantage with the capability to fly more than 3,500 nautical miles. That’s an increase of 340-570 nmi over the 737NG which gives our customers the flexibility to open up new markets.\" \nFlickr/Aero Icarus With that said, the 757 isn't a perfect plane. \n\"It's a 6-across (seating) narrow body that's long and thin,\" Smith said. \"And for passengers, it can take a long time to board and disembark.\"\nIn addition, the 757's cockpit is pretty old-fashioned when compared to modern airliners such as the 737 MAX. The controls of the 757 are also much heavier for pilots than its sibling — the Boeing 767. The 757 and 767 were developed at the same time and feature virtually identical cockpits.\nFinally, the Boeing 757 generates a massive amount of wake turbulence as it flies — forcing air traffic controllers to keep other planes far away from passing 757s.\n\"No one really knows why, but the 757 has really strong wake turbulence,\" Smith told us. \"The early 757s had worse wake turbulence than the 747.\"\nAlthough Smith added that the addition of winglets on later 757s have greatly decreased the wake turbulence. The Boeing 757 is an aircraft that's come and gone. It served its tour of duty with honor and distinction. Now, it's time for Boeing to find a replacement worthy of stepping into its shoes.\nNOW WATCH: Boeing just spent $1 billion on this massive facility to build airplane wings \n",

      "text": "Ghazanfar Ali Khan | Published — Sunday 27 November 2016 \nRIYADH: US giant Boeing, which has a full-fledged office in the Saudi capital, announced here Saturday that it has teamed up with the Riyadh-based King Salman Center for Disability Research (KSCDR), and is supporting a series of learning disability training courses. This Boeing-KSCDR partnership comes within the framework of Boeing’s ongoing commitment to support educational initiatives in the Kingdom.Ahmed Jazzar, president of Boeing in Saudi Arabia, made the announcement during a meeting with Prince Sultan bin Salman, chairman of the KSCDR board of trustees, who is also chief of the Saudi Commission for Tourism and National Heritage (SCTNH). Jazzar was accompanied by a number of Boeing executives. Speaking on the occasion, Prince Sultan expressed his gratitude to Boeing for its active partnership “to improve the lives of people with learning disabilities.” “At the King Salman Center, we pledge every day to complete our ambitious mission to improve the quality of life and living standards for people with special needs through our research activities,” added Prince Sultan.Boeing is a key supporter of the learning disabilities program, one of the most important programs at the KSCDR. The program consists of five tests that assess disabled students’ reading skills, which goes a long way in building the capacity of the reading-disabled segment of society. On the other hand, Boeing’s funding will advance the development and deployment of diagnostic tools that are tailored to the needs of learning-disabled individuals in Saudi Arabia. Facebook",

      "title": "An airline pilot reveals why a plane Boeing discarded 12 years ago is the one they desperately need - Yahoo7 Finance Australia",
      "text": "View Photo \nAn airline pilot reveals why a plane Boeing discarded 12 years ago is the one they desperately need Twelve years after Boeing discontinued the 757, the long-time 'tweener in the company's lineup is still popular among U.S. airlines. \nAmerican, Delta, and United all operate large fleets of the aeroplane. \nEven though the Renton, Washington-based plane maker booked more than 1,000 orders for the jets over its two decades in production, it was never a hot seller. \nBy the early 2000's, sales of the 757 had all but dried up, and Boeing put the plane out to pasture in 2004. \nAlthough many of the planes are pushing 25 years of service, airlines are hanging onto their 757s. For instance, Delta, who has spent big bucks on a fleet of new jets, recently refurbished the cabins of its ageing 757s instead of replacing them with newer planes. \nSo why are its customer's so loyal? Is the 757 that good? To get some answers, Business Insider recently spoke with author and Boeing 757 pilot Patrick Smith about the plane. \n\"There's no denying the 757 is an old plane that was designed in the late 1970s, but the versatility of the plane is remarkable and unmatched,\" Smith, the author of the book Cockpit Confidential , told Business Insider in an interview.\"It's profitable on both short-haul domestic as well as trans-Atlantic routes.\" \nDuring it's production life, the 757 was always a bit of an oddity -- a 'tweener of sorts. It's larger and offers greater range than the average narrow body jet, but smaller and cheaper to operate than a wide-body. Boeing and its customers, for many years, didn't quite know how to take full advantage of the plane's capabilities. However, when they did figure it out, it became an integral part of the operators' fleets. \nBoeing is currently marketing a new stretched variant of its long-serving 737 -- called the MAX 9 -- as a potential replacement for the 757. Now, there's talk that Boeing may make the 737 even larger to get closer to the 757's capacity. \n\"Boeing is trying to push the 737 as a viable 757 replacement,\" Smith said, \"In some respects it can and in some respects it can't.\" \nFor instance, the 737 simply isn't capable of the same kind of engine performance as the 757 . \nAccording to Smith, the 737 falls way short of the 757 in terms of runway performance. The 737 requires a much higher takeoff speed and much more runway to get off the ground. \n\"The 757 can be off the ground in 4,000 ft. and under 140 knots,\" he told us. However, Smith recounts being in the cockpit jump seat of a 737 as two other pilots were flying. During takeoff, the author noticed that the plane didn't lift off until 160 knots and used up much more runway. \nFurthermore, the 757 can comfortably climb straight to its cruising altitude. On the other hand, the 737 requires a step climb procedure that calls for the plane to climb to a certain altitude and burn off some fuel to lighten the load before climbing to a higher altitude. \nRunway performance matters. Especially when it comes to the type of flying the 757 and the 737 are asked to perform -- trans-continental or oceanic flights with a full payload from smaller secondary airports. \n\" The 737 falls short when you're trying fly it longer haul, coast to coast. It can do it, but not by much,\" Smith said. In addition, when it comes to flying across the Atlantic, \"there's concern in the winter, when there are ferocious head winds, the 737 may need to stop for fuel.\" The reality is that Smith believes the Boeing 737 is a good plane, but is being asked to take on a mission the design wasn't meant to perform. \n\"The Boeing 737 was essentially conceived as a small regional jet nearly five decades ago,\" Smith told us. \"It's an extremely popular plane, but it's being asked to perform missions it wasn't designed for.\" \nAs a result, Boeing is simply not in a position to bolt bigger engines onto the 737. Since its introduction in the 1960s, Boeing has been installing larger and larger engines on the 737 as the size of the plane grew. Unfortunately, the amount of room underneath the wing hasn't changed. Thus, Boeing has all but maxed out on the size of the engines it can mount on the 737 without completely redesigning the plane's under carriage. \nInstead of a stretched 737, Smith believes Boeing should have gone for an updated version of the 757 at some point during its production run. \n\"Somewhere along the way, had Being just re-engined the 757 with a new cockpit and new internal systems, it could have been a big hit,\" Smith told us. \nIn a statement to Business Insider, a Boeing spokesperson wrote: \n\"The 737 MAX will extend the Next-Generation 737 range advantage with the capability to fly more than 3,500 nautical miles. That's an increase of 340-570 nmi over the 737NG which gives our customers the flexibility to open up new markets.\" \nWith that said, the 757 isn't a perfect plane. \n\"It's a 6-across (seating) narrow body that's long and thin,\" Smith said. \"And for passengers, it can take a long time to board and disembark.\" \nIn addition, the 757's cockpit is pretty old-fashioned when compared to modern airliners such as the 737 MAX. The controls of the 757 are also much heavier for pilots than its sibling -- the Boeing 767. The 757 and 767 were developed at the same time and feature virtually identical cockpits. \nFinally, the Boeing 757 generates a massive amount of wake turbulence as it flies -- forcing air traffic controllers to keep other planes far away from passing 757s. \n\"No one really knows why, but the 757 has really strong wake turbulence,\" Smith told us. \"The early 757s had worse wake turbulence than the 747.\" \nAlthough Smith added that the addition of winglets on later 757s have greatly decreased the wake turbulence. The Boeing 757 is an aircraft that's come and gone. It served its tour of duty with honour and distinction. Now, it's time for Boeing to find a replacement worthy of stepping into its shoes. ",

      "text": "Company News | Sun Nov 27, 2016 | 3:49pm EST WTO set to sanction Boeing over tax breaks -reports \nNEW YORK Nov 27 The World Trade Organization is set to rule this week that Boeing Co received illegal tax breaks from Washington state, according to reports in The Telegraph and The Wall Street Journal. \nThe Journal said the trade organization will argue that the Washington state tax break is a prohibited subsidy and will have to be withdrawn, citing people familiar with the matter. \nThe paper said the WTO is not likely to say what the value of the prohibited tax break is, but the European Union has argued that Boeing has received more than $8 billion in forbidden subsidies. \nThe tax breaks in question are for Boeing's 777X airplane. \nThe ruling is part of a series of tit-for-tat transatlantic complaints about aircraft subsidies that together make up the world's largest trade dispute, still raging after 12 years of bitter arguments over support for Boeing and rival Airbus. \nRepresentatives for Boeing and the WTO could not immediately be reached for comment. \n(Reporting by Michael Erman; Editing by Peter Cooney) Next In Company News ",

Donald Trump's election victory and focus on trade are turning a new spotlight on such cases, and sanctions from earlier WTO judgments involving the two jet makers may start to be imposed next year.\nThe EU almost two years ago voiced concern at the WTO about the support package for the 777X, a revamped version of Boeing's existing 777 long-range plane. The updated model has attracted more than 300 orders from carriers including Emirates Airline and Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA.XE) .\nAn expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.com (http://www.wsj.com/articles/boeing-faces-wto-sanctions-1480272673).\nAlso popular on WSJ.com:\nThe need to read: Books remain one of the best ways to engage with the world (http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-need-to-read-1480083086?mod=mktw).\nOil industry anticipates its day of reckoning (http://www.wsj.com/articles/oil-industry-anticipates-day-of-reckoning-1480248012?mod=mktw).\n-Robert Wall ; 415-439-6400; AskNewswires@dowjones.com\n 1656ET\n ",

      "title": "Defense Sector Update November 21-27: Boeing Gets Over A Billion",
      "text": "Send Message Summary \nLockheed Martin continues to set the pace for the industry and is half a million dollars away from eleven figures in awards from the DoD. \nBoeing crossed the billion dollar mark and looks well situated to continue profiting off the F-35 delays. \nNATO Nations may be spending more on defense and our favorite defense contractors should benefit. \nI hope you all had a great Thanksgiving week if you're based in the US. And for my non-US readers, I also hope you had a great regular week. The US Department of Defense was busy in awarding new and modified contracts despite the shorter work week. I wasn't sure if I would have time to get to this update but here we are, so lets take a look at what happened last week. Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT ): $9,514,749,127 Boeing (NYSE: BA ): $1,185,843,748 General Dynamics (NYSE: GD ): $936,478,938 Raytheon (NYSE: RTN ): $834,877,232 Northrop Grumman (NYSE: NOC ): $450,153,393 United Technologies (NYSE: UTX ): $260,683,478 Huntington Ingalls (NYSE: HII ): $173,205,046 \nIf you take a look at last week's update , you may notice that Lockheed has a few billion more dollars in their total. In addition to a huge contract modification that Lockheed won, there were several other contracts worth discussing in more detail. \nSignificant Contracts \nAnybody who follows the defense sector, whether as an investor or as a casual observer, knows the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program and the problems it has endured. Some investors have expressed some concern that the program may be cancelled altogether due to the problems. This week they were given almost 7.2 billion reasons to not worry that much. The DoD issued a modification to a previous contract (N00019-15-C-0003) and with that allocated $7.2 billion to the company. This money is for 90 more F-35 aircraft to be tacked onto the Lot 10 order. Seventy-six of those 90 are for the F-35A variant which the US Air Force will get 44, 16 to non-US DoD participants, and 16 to foreign military customers. Nine of the F-35B will go to the US Marine Corps and three more to non-US DoD participants. Two of the F-35C will go the US Navy and nobody else. This brings the cost of each plane down to $79,881,079.36, though each variant will have different costs of course. Lockheed has struck gold with this program and the contracts will keep rolling in for years. The lion's share of the funds goes straight to Lockheed, but many other contractors benefit as well such as United Tech with their Pratt and Whitney engines that power the jet and BAE Systems and Raytheon with components and avionics. \nThe F-35 program is here to stay but Canada doesn't intend to be tied to it. The government recently announced their intention to procure 18 F-18 jets from Boeing to supplement their existing fleet of jets. Though nothing has been announced yet, this is significant for the mere fact that more and more nations, even the US itself, is having to backtrack to existing platforms to maintain their readiness. The promise of the F-35 replacing just about every existing fighter, attack, and electronic warfare jet still exists, but nations can't just sit and wait for it to be fully ready. This has been a boon for Boeing and even Lockheed itself, as they have seen their jets, the F-18 and F-16 respectively, fall back into favor. As investors we need to factor in the fact that each dollar spent on a \"legacy\" platform is one less that is going to be earmarked for the F-35 theoretically. \nSpeaking of Boeing, the Osprey continues to be a great source of revenue for them and Textron (NYSE: TXT ), a company I've written on previously . On the 22nd Bell/Boeing was awarded a contract modification (N00019-09-D-0008 ) which adds up to $267 million for the MV-22 and CV-22 Osprey logistics support. I've spoken about this aircraft in previous updates and articles but it deserves as much coverage as it can get. In the age of Anti-Access/Area Denial tactics and strategy and counter-strategy the Osprey delivers an incredible capability which is being realized more and more. Capable of going out 450 nautical miles and carrying more than other vertical take-off and landing \"VTOL\" aircraft this delivers an incredible advantage. The F-35, which is capable of jamming and interrupting air defenses, has a range just a little further than the Osprey. Together the F-35 and Osprey can penetrate deeper into enemy territory and establish a foothold for US Forces. I expect to see the Osprey continue to be a great source of revenue for both companies; so far this year it has seen $307 million in contracts thrown towards the program. \nThe F-35 isn't the only jet Lockheed makes that saw a contract awarded that was north of $1 billion. The juggernaut was also awarded a $1.2 billion contract (FA8615-17-C-6045) to upgrade F-16 jets for the Republic of Korea. This contract will be carried through Nov 2025 and all the work is going to be done in Fort Worth, Texas, the HQ of Lockheed. Not much more can be said about Lockheed, week after week they continue to execute and earn that high valuation. \nGeneral Dynamics had a pretty good week on the contract front, being awarded nearly $145 million total. The largest of the week was for $65 million for contractor logistics support and training for the M1A1 Abrams tank and the M88A2 recovery vehicle for Iraq. As many know, Iraq is sort of a mess at this point. While all the attention is focused on Mosul at the moment the country is still the victim of deep religious divisions and infighting. Their military has come quite a long way since the end of the US combat mission and the US still strongly supports their progress. There are quite a few US troops still in the country and that number seems to be increasing year over year. \nSlow Week \nThis last week was another outperforming week for our companies in question. The lone underperformer was BAE Systems who is also struggling with some currency issues related to the strong dollar, weak pound and this little thing called Brexit. The strongest performing company was Huntington Ingalls which is still riding the election to some strong gains. LMT data by YCharts \nThe Thanksgiving holiday slowed things down some, and even the flow of news was slower. The make-up of Mr. Trumps cabinet is still very much in the air. \nSecretary of Defense, Secretary of Homeland Security, and Secretary of State remain undecided. Last Saturday Mr. Trump met with retired Marine Corps General James \"Mad Dog\" Mattis and was impressed with him. Mitt Romney appears to still be a serious consideration for Secretary of State; other names such as Rudy Guiliani and Newt Gingrich remain at the top of the list as well. The Secretary of Homeland Security spot has a member of Mr. Trumps transition team being considered, even after a photo-op leaked some important details about the spot. Kris Kobach, the Kansas Secretary of State, was photographed with a position paper clearly visible following a meeting with the President-Elect. The Washington Post provides a breakdown of the visible portions. Inauguration day is fast approaching and with that I'm eager to see what Mr. Trump plans to really do in his first 100 days. The repeal of the sequestration should provide quite a bump to the defense sector and by this time next year we could see some meaningful increases in the top and bottom line of many defense contractors. This will be necessary for the sector to grow into their currently stretched valuations. \nNATO and Defense Spending \nA possible international bump to defense spending could be the result of a Trump presidency, and for investors this is great news. \nMr. Trump, often brash and abrasive, has been critical of NATO allies and their contributions to the shared defense. At first glance this may appear foolish and insulting to our allies but if we dig deeper it makes some sense. \nUnder the NATO agreement member countries must spend 2% of their GDP on defense and 20% of that going to equipment. Of the 28 members, only the US, the UK, Greece, Estonia and Poland spend the required amount. The US spends the most, at 3.6% of their GDP. The President-Elect is merely requesting the remaining nations uphold their end of the bargain as far as spending. As Russia flexes their muscle in the region this doesn't feel like an outlandish request and NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg agrees. \n(Source: Twitter (NYSE: TWTR )) \nI don't anticipate every participating country will instantly increase their spending to the required threshold, there are some conflicting requirements from the European Union getting in the way , but with the Secretary-General making statements we can expect gradual increases. \nWhat this could mean for our investments is anybody's guess, but a rising tide lifts all boats and it would be hard to imagine US based contractors wouldn't somehow benefit. Foreign based companies such as BAE Systems, Elbit Systems (NASDAQ: ESLT ), Thales ( OTC:THLEY ), Leonardo-Finmeccanica ( OTCPK:FINMY ), Babcock International Group ( OTC:BCKIY ), and Rolls-Royce ( OTCPK:RYCEY ) are some potential foreign beneficiaries. \nIn Other News \nThe US Army stood up a new group and is hyper-focused on the threat of Russian cyber shenanigans. \nThe Marine Corps is showing the world what the F-35 can do and why the plane deserves respect. \nThe F-35 can do some incredible stuff, like help an Aegis equipped missile destroyer shoot down an incoming cruise missile with a Raytheon made SM-6 missile. This is remarkable. \nIran cozies up to Russia and may, or may not, buy some Russian Sukhoi SU-30 jets. \nOn Seeking Alpha \nChristopher Magas gives us a deeper dive into Leidos Holding (NYSE: LDOS ) which has jumped onto my radar. \nCasey Hoerth makes a strong case for United Tech under Mr. Trumps administration. \nDavid Pinsen offers some much needed skepticism on the recent run Lockheed has been on. \nLarry Wishnick jumps into Raytheon and gives the bullish case for the well diversified contractor. \nAccendo Markets covers some foreign contractors who could benefit after TPP. \nThe Coming Week \nI expect a little more volatility this week than last for the overall market and this includes our defense sector. Mr. Trump should make some more decisions on his cabinet and we may know more of what we are dealing with. Of course, contracts will keep rolling in, I'll be looking for possible announcements on the Air Force trainer program and also if Boeing can lock down some sales to Qatar and Kuwait for the F-18 and F-15. \nI appreciate you reading, please leave your thoughts and questions in the comments.

Norway's territorial waters also stretch far into the Arctic. \nNeighboring Sweden and Finland, which are not in the NATO alliance, have also expressed concerns about incursions by Russian submarines and other naval vessels. \n\"The new security situation increases our demand for situational awareness in our own vicinity. The ability to handle current and future challenges must therefore be strengthened,\" Defence Minister Ine Eriksen Soereide said. \n\"The introduction of the Poseidon aircraft is crucial for Norway to maintain a leading position and expertise on strategic conditions in northern areas,\" she said in the statement released late on Friday. The statement did not specifically mention Russia. \nThe submarine-hunting patrol planes will replace Norway's current fleet of six P-3 Orion and three DA-20 Jet Falcon aircraft and are expected to be delivered in 2021 and 2022.

      "text": "Norway plans $1.15 billion order for five Boeing Poseidon military aircraft Reuters Reuters Photo: \nOSLO (Reuters) - Norway plans to order five Boeing Co P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol planes to maintain its surveillance capacity and meet future security challenges, the NATO country's Defence Ministry said. \nFollowing an agreement in Norway's parliament to boost long-term military spending, the 9.83 billion Norwegian crowns ($1.15 billion) purchase will likely face only minor political opposition. \nNorway's long maritime border with neighboring Russia has become a renewed focus for the country's military planners following the Russian annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region. Norway's territorial waters also stretch far into the Arctic. \nNeighboring Sweden and Finland, which are not in the NATO alliance, have also expressed concerns about incursions by Russian submarines and other naval vessels. \n\"The new security situation increases our demand for situational awareness in our own vicinity. The ability to handle current and future challenges must therefore be strengthened,\" Defence Minister Ine Eriksen Soereide said. \n\"The introduction of the Poseidon aircraft is crucial for Norway to maintain a leading position and expertise on strategic conditions in northern areas,\" she said in the statement released late on Friday. The statement did not specifically mention Russia. \nThe submarine-hunting patrol planes will replace Norway's current fleet of six P-3 Orion and three DA-20 Jet Falcon aircraft and are expected to be delivered in 2021 and 2022. Norway will also buy related intelligence equipment, the ministry said. \n(Reporting by Joachim Dagenborg; Editing by Terje Solsvik and Alison Williams)",

      "text": "OSLO (Reuters) - Norway plans to order five Boeing Co P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol planes to maintain its surveillance capacity and meet future security challenges, the NATO country's Defence Ministry said. Following an agreement in Norway's parliament to boost long-term military spending, the 9.83 billion Norwegian crowns ($1.15 billion) purchase will likely face only minor political opposition.\nNorway's long maritime border with neighboring Russia has become a renewed focus for the country's military planners following the Russian annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region. Norway's territorial waters also stretch far into the Arctic.\nNeighboring Sweden and Finland, which are not in the NATO alliance, have also expressed concerns about incursions by Russian submarines and other naval vessels.\n\"The new security situation increases our demand for situational awareness in our own vicinity. The ability to handle current and future challenges must therefore be strengthened,\" Defence Minister Ine Eriksen Soereide said.\n\"The introduction of the Poseidon aircraft is crucial for Norway to maintain a leading position and expertise on strategic conditions in northern areas,\" she said in the statement released late on Friday. The statement did not specifically mention Russia.\nThe submarine-hunting patrol planes will replace Norway's current fleet of six P-3 Orion and three DA-20 Jet Falcon aircraft and are expected to be delivered in 2021 and 2022. Norway will also buy related intelligence equipment, the ministry said.\n(Reporting by Joachim Dagenborg; Editing by Terje Solsvik and Alison Williams)",

      "text": "Related Content View Photo \n\nKuwait will buy 28 Boeing F/A-18 Super Hornets to replace a fleet of earlier versions of the US fighter jets, a top official said Monday. \nThe value of the deal is not expected to exceed $5 billion, the KUNA state news agency reported the head of armament and procurement at Kuwait's defence ministry as saying.\nMajor General Lafi al-Azemi said the deal stipulates the supplier will re-purchase the old Hornet fighter jets from Kuwait.\nThe US State Department this month said it has authorised the deal, as well as the sale of 72 F-15 Strike Eagle jets to Kuwait's Gulf neighbour Qatar at an estimated value of $21 billion.\nIn April, Kuwait signed a contract with Italy's Finmeccanica for the purchase of 28 Eurofighter Typhoon warplanes for under eight billion euros ($8.5 billion).\nKuwait's parliament in March approved spending an additional $500 million as an advance payment for the jets.\nThat funding came on top of $10 billion additional defence spending already approved by parliament in January to upgrade the country's military.\nThe emirate is a member of the US-led coalition bombing Islamic State group targets in Syria and Iraq, and is also taking part in a Saudi-led coalition pounding Iran-backed rebels in Yemen.\nLast year, it bought 24 Caracal military tactical transport helicopters and French light armoured vehicles.",

      "text": "The World Trade Organization is set to rule this week that Boeing ba received illegal tax breaks from Washington state, according to reports in The Telegraph and The Wall Street Journal.\nThe Journal said the trade organization will argue that the Washington state tax break is a prohibited subsidy and will have to be withdrawn, citing people familiar with the matter.\nThe paper said the WTO is not likely to say what the value of the prohibited tax break is, but the European Union has argued that Boeing has received more than $8 billion in forbidden subsidies.\nThe tax breaks in question are for Boeing’s 777X airplane.\nFor more on Boeing, watch Fortune’s video:\nThe ruling is part of a series of tit-for-tat transatlantic complaints about aircraft subsidies that together make up the world’s largest trade dispute, still raging after 12 years of bitter arguments over support for Boeing and rival Airbus eadsy .\nRepresentatives for Boeing and the WTO could not immediately be reached for comment.",

      "text": "Las Palmas-Airport de Gran Canaria (LPA/GCLP) Destination airport: Friedrichshafen Airport (FDH/EDNY) Investigating agency: Comisión de Investigación de Accidentes e Incidentes de Aviación Civil (CIAIAC) - Spain Narrative: Germania flight ST6129 was involved in a takeoff incident at Las Palmas-Airport de Gran Canaria in the Canary Islands, Spain. The aircraft was authorized by the Tower controller in the local position (LCL) to cross runway 03L and align and wait on 03R. The aircraft crew reported that the red lights on the stop bar were illuminated on taxiway S4. The LCL controller re-authorized the aircraft to line up and wait on the runway and then take off. At that time a work was being carried out on track 03R/21 L and a vehicle was present just off the right side of the runway. Because of that, once the GMI6129 aircraft had started the takeoff run from runway 03R, the LCL controller instructed it to cancel take-off. Maximum speed reached was about 60 knots. The aircraft passed the vehicle and the takeoff was safely aborted. The incident was caused by a loss of situational awareness of the controller, who instructed the crew of GMI6129 to enter and then take off from runway 03R, even though he knew it was closed. Contributing factors: - The controller did not detect the error even though the visual aids in the tower indicated that the runway was closed. He neither visually detected the presence of the car near runway 03R, although possibly contributing was the fact that the car did not have active anti collision lights. - The controller partially heard a communication from the crew that indicated that the stop bar was active, however he did not request a repeat of the communication and instructed the aircraft to enter the runway and lign up. - The crew crossed an illuminted stop bar, without having information that there were ongoing contingency measures for not being able to shut it down. Regulations regarding stop bars and the manuals deriving from it are not clear and specific. - The aircraft crew started the take-off run despite having visual contact with the car that was standing to the side of the runway. - The mitigating measure of placing cones on the threshold of the closed runway was not implemented, since the minutes of the meeting of the Local Runway Safety Committee where it was proposed were not approved. At the time of the incident the following Notam was in force: B9738/15 NOTAMN Q) GCCC/QMRLC/IV/NBO/A /000/999/2756N01523W005 A) GCLP B) 1601070800 C) 1601071820 EST E) RWY 03R/21L CLSD EXC EMERG MIL CREATED: 30 Dec 2015 13:58:00 SOURCE: EUECYIYN \nSources : Official accident investigation report agency: Comisión de Investigación de Accidentes e Incidentes de Aviación Civil (CIAIAC) - Spain Final",

The number of shares short is then compared to the average daily volume, in order to calculate the total number of trading days it would take to close out all of the open short positions if every share traded represented a short position being closed.",

      "title": "Kuwait to buy 28 F-18 warplanes: official",
      "text": "More Kuwait will buy 28 Boeing F/A-18 Super Hornets to replace a fleet of earlier versions of the US fighter jets, a top official said Monday. The value of the deal is not expected to exceed $5 billion, the KUNA state news agency reported the head of armament and procurement at Kuwait's defence ministry as saying. Major General Lafi al-Azemi said the deal stipulates the supplier will re-purchase the old Hornet fighter jets from Kuwait. The US State Department this month said it has authorised the deal, as well as the sale of 72 F-15 Strike Eagle jets to Kuwait's Gulf neighbour Qatar at an estimated value of $21 billion. In April, Kuwait signed a contract with Italy's Finmeccanica for the purchase of 28 Eurofighter Typhoon warplanes for under eight billion euros ($8.5 billion). Kuwait's parliament in March approved spending an additional $500 million as an advance payment for the jets. That funding came on top of $10 billion additional defence spending already approved by parliament in January to upgrade the country's military. The emirate is a member of the US-led coalition bombing Islamic State group targets in Syria and Iraq, and is also taking part in a Saudi-led coalition pounding Iran-backed rebels in Yemen. Last year, it bought 24 Caracal military tactical transport helicopters and French light armoured vehicles. Reblog",

      "text": "In new case, WTO rules against state’s tax breaks for Boeing 777X plants  00 am Updated November 28, 2016 at 7:19 am A crew tests a machine at Boeing’s 777X Composite Wing Center in Everett. On Monday, the WTO ruled that a state tax break enacted to make sure the plant was built here is a “prohibited subsidy.” But the saga won’t end there. (Ken Lambert/The Seattle Times) The WTO ruled Monday that the business-tax reduction granted by Washington state to Boeing in 2013 for the forthcoming 777X jet is a prohibited subsidy. Experts on both sides say the reality on the ground is unlikely to change even if that’s upheld on appeal. Share story Dominic Gates Seattle Times aerospace reporter \nThe World Trade Organization (WTO) ruled Monday that the extension of the business-tax reduction that Washington state granted to Boeing in 2013 for the forthcoming 777X jet is a prohibited subsidy. \nThe term “prohibited” signifies the WTO’s strictest legal category, denoting a subsidy that cannot be allowed to stand. If the ruling is upheld on appeal, action to remove the subsidy would be required. \nYet even then, in a testament to the excruciating frustration of the WTO process, legal experts on both sides of the case say the outcome will almost certainly leave Boeing’s bottom line untouched — and Washington state’s tax coffers none the richer. \n“You can remove a subsidy in a hundred different ways that don’t in any way impact the benefit Boeing might get,” said Bob Novick, a former general counsel to the U.S. trade representative and now an outside counsel to Boeing on the WTO dispute. Most Read Stories Cyber Sale! Save 90% on digital access. \nA lawyer on the European side of the case, who asked not to be identified because he spoke before the ruling is being officially made public, agreed that Boeing is unlikely to suffer financially. \nMonday’s ruling is new. It’s a separate case from the two original WTO lawsuits: the one filed by the U.S. in 2004 over the Airbus “launch aid” and the countersuit Europe filed in 2005 over the state tax breaks to Boeing as well as research grants it got from NASA and the Department of Defense. \nThe European lawyer recalled that when the WTO initially ruled in 2010 that government loans to Airbus to launch its A380 superjumbo jet were prohibited subsidies, Boeing crowed about the outcome and demanded that Airbus either repay or restructure the loans. \nThat A380 ruling was reversed on appeal a year later. Now, Boeing’s biggest tax break is on the same chopping block. \n“The tables are turned. Boeing’s been tagged,” said the European lawyer. “But nothing is actually going to change.” \nMichael Luttig, Boeing’s general counsel, agrees. \n“After any appeal,” Luttig said, “we fully expect Boeing to preserve every aspect of the Washington state incentives.” \nAnd while an Airbus press release hyped the ruling as “a knockout blow to Boeing’s record-breaking subsidies” and demanded that the Washington state tax breaks “be withdrawn immediately,” Airbus chief executive Fabrice Bregier conceded that he has ” little faith in the US compliance with the WTO rulings.” WTO pounces on one clause \nThe latest ruling certainly means Boeing and Washington state will have to do something if it withstands appeal. \nThe problem is a clause that was inserted into the 2013 tax-break legislation to protect jobs in this state: It says the extension of the business and occupation (B&O) tax reduction out to 2040 will be terminated if the state determines “that any final assembly or wing assembly … has been sited outside the state of Washington.” \n“That’s what killed them,” said the European lawyer. \nThe WTO interpreted that to mean the law expressly favors local production over imports — the definition of a prohibited subsidy. \nFor example, the 787 Dreamliner’s wing was built in Japan, yet this clause would punish Boeing if it outsourced the wing of the 777X. \nOf course, that clause was inserted because of the state’s experience in providing similar tax relief to win local assembly of the 787. (There was no similar clause in the 2003 legislation that established the original aerospace tax breaks for the 787.) \nBoeing did build that previous jet in Washington state and took the tax breaks, then five years later decided to put a second 787 assembly plant in South Carolina. \nThe biggest Dreamliner, the forthcoming 787-10 model, will be exclusively built in South Carolina. \nSo next time around, in 2013, state legislators required that, to qualify for the tax breaks, Boeing must build the 777X here and only here. \nBut that contravened the WTO ban on governmental support that explicitly stipulates work has to be local, and so triggered this ruling. “Fast track” case \nIn the 2005 case against the U.S., the trade body ruled the original 2003 tax breaks illegal, requiring some action to fix the adverse effects on Airbus. But they were not found to be “prohibited” and so don’t have to be withdrawn. \nIn the parallel U.S. case against Airbus at the WTO, the specific loans it used to launch new airplanes were found illegal because the terms of the loans were too favorable. But the appeal process established that they are not “prohibited.” \nSo Airbus was required only to fix the terms of those loans. In September, the WTO ruled that it had failed to comply even with that, a finding that Airbus is currently appealing. \nThose original cases have dragged on for more than a decade with no perceptible change in behavior by either of the airplane makers. \nThe new 777X case is in WTO terms a “fast track” case because it’s narrowly targeted: It pertains only to the Washington state subsidies for the 777X and must determine only if they are prohibited or not. \nBut “fast track” is a relative term. \nAfter this initial finding, Boeing will appeal. If it loses on appeal, then there is a compliance phase, then a ruling on whether it has complied, and a potential appeal to that ruling. \nEven if Boeing lost at every step, the process would probably take at least two more years to play out, said Novick, former general counsel to the U.S. Trade Representative. \nStill, it should be over long before the first 777X is due to be delivered in 2020. \nEU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmström claimed Monday that the new ruling “makes illegal” the B&O tax reduction portion of Washington state’s incentive package for all Boeing airplanes delivered through 2040 and estimated the impact at $5.7 billion. \nBoeing came up with a much lower estimate of the maximum potential damage, about $1 billion. \nThat’s based on its assessment that the ruling, if it withstands appeal, would affect only 777X deliveries and that the tax reduction would therefore be worth “no more than $50 million a year” over 20 years. \nIf Boeing were to lose its appeal at the WTO, and the B&O tax break for the 777X were finally confirmed as “prohibited,” $50 million a year is hardly insignificant. Yet Boeing believes there are ways of avoiding any hit to its bottom line at all. \nFor example, Boeing has already built the huge facilities for making the 777X fuselage and wing in Everett. It’s spending $1 billion on the composite wing center alone. \n“The facilities are on the ground. We’ve spent the money,” said Ted Austell, Boeing vice president for trade issues. \nThose facts on the ground establish that the state has all the 777X work it asked for. So the Legislature could perhaps choose to excise the incriminating clause from the law and settle for a verbal guarantee that Boeing isn’t going to go to another state and build another $1 billion facility — which wouldn’t make economic sense anyway. \nSince 2013, state legislators have been pushing for more accountability from Boeing, not less. But as Austell put it, “Sometimes governments use these WTO decisions to do what’s politically unpalatable.” \nAustell added that if the state needs job guarantees, Boeing could write those into its labor contracts with the unions. The WTO has no role in adjudicating contracts, only laws. \nThe European lawyer points out one more reason why Boeing doesn’t have much to fear. \nThe 2003 agreement between Boeing and the state of Washington that set up the original tax-break regime — of which the 2013 agreement for 777X was merely an extension — states that “in the event of a change in law, or any other act, event or circumstance,” that would materially diminish the benefit to Boeing, then the state must make the jet maker whole with some other commitment “having economic effect equivalent” to the tax breaks. WTO toothless? \nGiven that, the European lawyer said that even though Boeing has lost this round, he sees no useful final outcome. Instead, he sees the entire process as damaging all concerned because it highlights for countries like Canada, China and Russia that the WTO rules against government subsidies are toothless. \n“It only shows the inability of the U.S. and Europe to stand together to defend their traditional place in the market,” he said. \nHe added that aircraft-manufacturing companies in China are surely paying close attention to the Airbus/Boeing dispute and must enjoy “watching two kids slugging it out in the sandbox as (they) prepare to take both of their lunch moneys.” \nIn a statement Monday, Airbus CEO Bregier cited the same competitive threats and said the WTO fight “will only encourage other aerospace producing countries to feel totally free to subsidize their local industries.” \nAnd Airbus Group chief executive Tom Enders said only some kind of settlement between Europe and the U.S. will hold off that looming competition. \n“This WTO battle is a battle of the past which benefits only the armies of lawyers both sides employ,” Enders said. “I continue to think that the only way out of the ridiculous series of disputes initiated by the US is to agree on a set of globally applicable rules for the support of the civil aircraft industry, which would benefit both sides of the Atlantic.” \nYet Boeing for now insists upon its pound of flesh. \nEven though it’s just lost this first round in the new 777X case, Boeing won the last round in September in the original case against Airbus, which after a dozen years finally has an endpoint in sight. \nIf Airbus loses its appeal in that recent ruling saying it has not complied with the court’s requirements to fix its launch-aid loans, then by the middle of next year the U.S. could be authorized to instigate trade sanctions against the European Union. \nNovick eagerly anticipates that outcome as justifying the long WTO fight. \n“When the U.S. receives the authorization to take countermeasures, nobody is going to be calling it toothless,” Novick said. \nOutside experts remain skeptical. \nBainbridge Island-based aviation-industry analyst Scott Hamilton of Leeham.net says a trade war with Europe would hurt not only Airbus and Boeing but U.S. suppliers such as GE, Honeywell and Spirit AeroSystems that supply both plane makers. \nEven with an incoming Trump administration seeming to want to flex its trade-deal muscles, Hamilton said he expects “common sense will prevail” and that the WTO process will eventually fizzle out.

      "text": "Big Story 10  19am EST WTO rules against tax break for Boeing 777X jet The Boeing Company logo is projected on a wall at the ''What's Next?'' conference in Chicago, Illinois, U.S., October 4, 2016. REUTERS/Jim Young By Tim Hepher and Tom Miles | GENEVA \nGENEVA The World Trade Organization (WTO) ruled on Monday a tax break from Washington state to help Boeing develop its new 777X jetliner was a prohibited subsidy, in a setback for the U.S. planemaker as it eyes victory in a parallel case against Airbus. \nThe WTO said the subsidy came in the form of a renewed cut in Washington state's main business tax for aerospace agreed in 2013, when Boeing was considering where to base assembly of the latest member of its long-haul jet family. \nIt rejected a complaint   six further tax measures. \nIt is the third swathe of public support for Boeing or its European rival Airbus criticized by the WTO in a record transatlantic trade dispute dating back 12 years, and involving mutual accusations of tens of billions of dollars of aid. \nThe ruling, which can be appealed by either side, comes as the United States ponders potential sanctions against the EU over earlier rulings against Airbus. \nThe WTO did not give a value for the banned aid, but the European Union estimated it at $5.7 billion out of an $8.7 billion package of tax measures in Washington, where most of Boeing's factories are based. \nAirbus said the measures had cost it $50 billion in sales. \nBoeing said the aid in question would only kick in from 2020 and would be worth $50 million a year, a fraction of the total amount at stake in the world's largest trade dispute. \nReuters reported last week that the WTO was expected within days to find at least one strand of banned support for Boeing. \nOn paper, the latest ruling is a step backwards for the United States because the WTO had earlier ruled a previous generation of tax breaks had fallen into a weaker category of subsidies, which the Geneva watchdog treats less harshly than \"prohibited\" aid. \nUnder WTO rules, subsidies that are explicitly tied to exports or, in this case, the use of local content are prohibited and must be withdrawn \"without delay\". The two sides are certain to clash over whether that means actual repayment. \nEuropean officials argue Boeing fell into a prohibited subsidy trap of its own making when state lawmakers insisted on locking Boeing into Washington more rigidly than before, after Boeing accepted earlier tax breaks only to move work elsewhere. \nIn 2013, Washington lawmakers extended the tax breaks from 2024 to 2040 but said they would end support for any new version of jet if its body or wings were assembled outside the state. \nSeizing on previous U.S. statements that Airbus subsidies once deemed prohibited - but later watered down on appeal - should be paid back to taxpayers, European sources said Boeing would now have to forego billions of dollars in aid. \nThey also zeroed in on \"program accounting\" methods used by Boeing, which they said had already allowed it to factor in future support for the 777X even before money had been received. \nUnder the same system, Boeing would now have to adjust its accounts to reflect risks resulting from the WTO finding, they argued, in what would be the first direct impact of the marathon case on investors. \nBoeing officials and lawyers played down the prospect of having to repay money, however. \nThey said they were confident the ruling would be overturned on appeal and insisted the tax breaks were dwarfed by $22 billion in subsidized loans by European governments to Airbus, adding these could spark U.S. retaliation within a year. \n(Reporting by Tim Hepher and Tom Miles; Editing by Mark Potter) Next In Big Story 10",

This claim was rejected by the WTO, which found future incentives totalling no more than $50 million a year to be impermissible,\" Boeing said in a statement.\n\"The WTO found that to date Boeing has received no benefit from the 777X (tax) rate incentive, and will not until 2020, because the first airplane will not be delivered until then.\"\nBoth sides have the right to appeal the ruling.\n\"After any appeal, we fully expect Boeing to preserve every aspect of the Washington state incentives, including the 777X revenue tax rate,\" Michael Luttig, Boeing's general counsel, said in the statement.\nBoeing's external legal adviser, Robert Novick, co-managing partner of law firm WilmerHale, said the WTO appellate body frequently reverses prohibited subsidy findings.

      "text": " 27pm GMT WTO rules against tax break for Boeing 777X jet The Boeing Company logo is projected on a wall at the ''What's Next?'' conference in Chicago, Illinois, U.S., October 4, 2016. REUTERS/Jim Young By Tim Hepher and Tom Miles | GENEVA \nGENEVA The World Trade Organization (WTO) ruled on Monday a tax break from Washington state to help Boeing ( BA.N ) develop its new 777X jetliner was a prohibited subsidy, in a setback for the U.S. planemaker as it eyes victory in a parallel case against Airbus. \nThe WTO said the subsidy came in the form of a renewed cut in Washington state's main business tax for aerospace agreed in 2013, when Boeing was considering where to base assembly of the latest member of its long-haul jet family. \nIt rejected a complaint by the European Union against six further tax measures. \nIt is the third swathe of public support for Boeing or its European rival Airbus ( AIR.PA ) criticized by the WTO in a record transatlantic trade dispute dating back 12 years, and involving mutual accusations of tens of billions of dollars of aid. \nThe ruling, which can be appealed by either side, comes as the United States ponders potential sanctions against the EU over earlier rulings against Airbus. \nThe WTO did not give a value for the banned aid, but the European Union estimated it at $5.7 billion out of an $8.7 billion package of tax measures in Washington, where most of Boeing's factories are based. \nAirbus said the measures had cost it $50 billion in sales. \nBoeing said the aid in question would only kick in from 2020 and would be worth $50 million a year, a fraction of the total amount at stake in the world's largest trade dispute. \nReuters reported last week that the WTO was expected within days to find at least one strand of banned support for Boeing. \nOn paper, the latest ruling is a step backwards for the United States because the WTO had earlier ruled a previous generation of tax breaks had fallen into a weaker category of subsidies, which the Geneva watchdog treats less harshly than \"prohibited\" aid. \nUnder WTO rules, subsidies that are explicitly tied to exports or, in this case, the use of local content are prohibited and must be withdrawn \"without delay\". The two sides are certain to clash over whether that means actual repayment. \nEuropean officials argue Boeing fell into a prohibited subsidy trap of its own making when state lawmakers insisted on locking Boeing into Washington more rigidly than before, after Boeing accepted earlier tax breaks only to move work elsewhere. \nIn 2013, Washington lawmakers extended the tax breaks from 2024 to 2040 but said they would end support for any new version of jet if its body or wings were assembled outside the state. \nSeizing on previous U.S. statements that Airbus subsidies once deemed prohibited - but later watered down on appeal - should be paid back to taxpayers, European sources said Boeing would now have to forego billions of dollars in aid. \nThey also zeroed in on \"program accounting\" methods used by Boeing, which they said had already allowed it to factor in future support for the 777X even before money had been received. \nUnder the same system, Boeing would now have to adjust its accounts to reflect risks resulting from the WTO finding, they argued, in what would be the first direct impact of the marathon case on investors. \nBoeing officials and lawyers played down the prospect of having to repay money, however. \nThey said they were confident the ruling would be overturned on appeal and insisted the tax breaks were dwarfed by $22 billion in subsidized loans by European governments to Airbus, adding these could spark U.S. retaliation within a year. \n(Reporting by Tim Hepher and Tom Miles; Editing by Mark Potter)  ",

      "text": "International Business WTO rules against tax break for Boeing 777X jet The World Trade Organization (WTO) ruled on Monday a tax break from Washington state to help Boeing develop its new 777X jetliner was a prohibited subsidy, in a setback for the U.S. planemaker as it eyes victory in a parallel case against Airbus. Posted 28 Nov 2016 23:30 The Boeing Company logo is projected on a wall at the \"What's Next?\" conference in Chicago, Illinois, U.S., October 4, 2016. REUTERS/Jim Young A \nGENEVA: The World Trade Organization (WTO) ruled on Monday a tax break from Washington state to help Boeing develop its new 777X jetliner was a prohibited subsidy, in a setback for the U.S. planemaker as it eyes victory in a parallel case against Airbus. \nThe WTO said the subsidy came in the form of a renewed cut in Washington state's main business tax for aerospace agreed in 2013, when Boeing was considering where to base assembly of the latest member of its long-haul jet family. \nIt rejected a complaint by the European Union against six further tax measures. \nIt is the third swathe of public support for Boeing or its European rival Airbus criticized by the WTO in a record transatlantic trade dispute dating back 12 years, and involving mutual accusations of tens of billions of dollars of aid. \nThe ruling, which can be appealed by either side, comes as the United States ponders potential sanctions against the EU over earlier rulings against Airbus. \nThe WTO did not give a value for the banned aid, but the European Union estimated it at US$5.7 billion out of an US$8.7 billion package of tax measures in Washington, where most of Boeing's factories are based. \nAirbus said the measures had cost it US$50 billion in sales. \nBoeing said the aid in question would only kick in from 2020 and would be worth US$50 million a year, a fraction of the total amount at stake in the world's largest trade dispute. \nReuters reported last week that the WTO was expected within days to find at least one strand of banned support for Boeing. \nOn paper, the latest ruling is a step backwards for the United States because the WTO had earlier ruled a previous generation of tax breaks had fallen into a weaker category of subsidies, which the Geneva watchdog treats less harshly than \"prohibited\" aid. \nUnder WTO rules, subsidies that are explicitly tied to exports or, in this case, the use of local content are prohibited and must be withdrawn \"without delay\". The two sides are certain to clash over whether that means actual repayment. \nEuropean officials argue Boeing fell into a prohibited subsidy trap of its own making when state lawmakers insisted on locking Boeing into Washington more rigidly than before, after Boeing accepted earlier tax breaks only to move work elsewhere. \nIn 2013, Washington lawmakers extended the tax breaks from 2024 to 2040 but said they would end support for any new version of jet if its body or wings were assembled outside the state. \nSeizing on previous U.S. statements that Airbus subsidies once deemed prohibited - but later watered down on appeal - should be paid back to taxpayers, European sources said Boeing would now have to forego billions of dollars in aid. \nThey also zeroed in on \"program accounting\" methods used by Boeing, which they said had already allowed it to factor in future support for the 777X even before money had been received. \nUnder the same system, Boeing would now have to adjust its accounts to reflect risks resulting from the WTO finding, they argued, in what would be the first direct impact of the marathon case on investors. \nBoeing officials and lawyers played down the prospect of having to repay money, however. \nThey said they were confident the ruling would be overturned on appeal and insisted the tax breaks were dwarfed by US$22 billion in subsidized loans by European governments to Airbus, adding these could spark U.S. retaliation within a year. \n(Reporting by Tim Hepher and Tom Miles; Editing by Mark Potter) - Reuters",

      "text": "Related Content View Photo The Boeing Company logo is projected on a wall at the \"What's Next?\" conference in Chicago, …\nBy Tim Hepher and Tom Miles\nGENEVA (Reuters) - The World Trade Organization (WTO) ruled on Monday a tax break from Washington state to help Boeing (BA.N) develop its new 777X jetliner was a prohibited subsidy, in a setback for the U.S. planemaker as it eyes victory in a parallel case against Airbus.\nThe WTO said the subsidy came in the form of a renewed cut in Washington state's main business tax for aerospace agreed in 2013, when Boeing was considering where to base assembly of the latest member of its long-haul jet family.\nIt rejected a complaint by the European Union against six further tax measures.\nIt is the third swathe of public support for Boeing or its European rival Airbus (AIR.PA) criticized by the WTO in a record transatlantic trade dispute dating back 12 years, and involving mutual accusations of tens of billions of dollars of aid.\nThe ruling, which can be appealed by either side, comes as the United States ponders potential sanctions against the EU over earlier rulings against Airbus.\nThe WTO did not give a value for the banned aid, but the European Union estimated it at $5.7 billion out of an $8.7 billion package of tax measures in Washington, where most of Boeing's factories are based.\nAirbus said the measures had cost it $50 billion in sales.\nBoeing said the aid in question would only kick in from 2020 and would be worth $50 million a year, a fraction of the total amount at stake in the world's largest trade dispute.\nReuters reported last week that the WTO was expected within days to find at least one strand of banned support for Boeing.\nOn paper, the latest ruling is a step backwards for the United States because the WTO had earlier ruled a previous generation of tax breaks had fallen into a weaker category of subsidies, which the Geneva watchdog treats less harshly than \"prohibited\" aid.\nUnder WTO rules, subsidies that are explicitly tied to exports or, in this case, the use of local content are prohibited and must be withdrawn \"without delay\". The two sides are certain to clash over whether that means actual repayment.\nEuropean officials argue Boeing fell into a prohibited subsidy trap of its own making when state lawmakers insisted on locking Boeing into Washington more rigidly than before, after Boeing accepted earlier tax breaks only to move work elsewhere.\n\nIn 2013, Washington lawmakers extended the tax breaks from 2024 to 2040 but said they would end support for any new version of jet if its body or wings were assembled outside the state.\nSeizing on previous U.S. statements that Airbus subsidies once deemed prohibited - but later watered down on appeal - should be paid back to taxpayers, European sources said Boeing would now have to forego billions of dollars in aid. \nThey also zeroed in on \"program accounting\" methods used by Boeing, which they said had already allowed it to factor in future support for the 777X even before money had been received. \nUnder the same system, Boeing would now have to adjust its accounts to reflect risks resulting from the WTO finding, they argued, in what would be the first direct impact of the marathon case on investors.\nBoeing officials and lawyers played down the prospect of having to repay money, however.\nThey said they were confident the ruling would be overturned on appeal and insisted the tax breaks were dwarfed by $22 billion in subsidized loans by European governments to Airbus, adding these could spark U.S. retaliation within a year.\n\n(Reporting by Tim Hepher and Tom Miles; Editing by Mark Potter)",

      "text": "November 28, 2016 7:37 AM Trade body says Boeing was offered illegal tax breaks in US By RAF CASERT and JAMEY KEATEN Associated Press Order Reprint of this Story GENEVA \nA World Trade Organization panel on Monday ruled that Washington state offered billions in illegal tax breaks to plane maker Boeing, and that the U.S. government must take action to end the plans within months. \nThe European Union, which backs Boeing's EU-based rival, Airbus, claimed it as a landmark victory in the longstanding battle between the two companies that dominate the global market for airplanes. \nThe ruling is but a part of a wider squabble involving accusations between the U.S. government and the 28-nation EU over support for Boeing and Airbus dating back to 2004. \nMonday's decision found that the support Washington state promised to give Boeing from 2024 to 2040 amounted to \"prohibited\" subsidies. The support offered by Washington came on condition that Boeing keeps the production of the wings of the wide-bodied 777x plane in the state, excluding foreign competition. \nBoeing has extensive plants around Seattle and the EU says the subsidies would have amounted to $8.7 billion. EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said the WTO ruled against $5.7 billion of the measures. \nThe case could have some implications for President-elect Donald Trump's ambitions to support U.S. business first and foremost. Rejecting some of the EU claims, the WTO found that only one of seven tax incentives provided by Washington state amounted to illegal subsidies for wings for the wide-body jet. In essence, the \"prohibited subsidy\" involved the reduction of business tax rate on the condition that the wings were produced domestically within the United States. \nMalmstrom called Monday's ruling \"an important victory for the EU and its aircraft industry.\" \n\"We expect the U.S. to respect the rules, uphold fair competition, and withdraw these subsidies without any delay,\" Malmstrom said in a statement. \nAirbus had already confidently predicted victory at the WTO over the Washington state tax incentives, saying during the latest tit-for-tat showdown in September that the alleged subsidies would \"almost certainly be condemned as illegal.\" Airbus had made that assertion after the trade body had found that the EU had provided billions of dollars of improper subsidies to the European plane maker.

The number of shares short is then compared to the average daily volume, in order to calculate the total number of trading days it would take to close out all of the open short positions if every share traded represented a short position being closed.",

The support offered by Washington came on condition that Boeing keeps the production of the wings of the wide-bodied 777x plane in the state, excluding foreign competition. \nBoeing has extensive plants around Seattle and the EU says the subsidies would have amounted to $8.7 billion. EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said the WTO ruled against $5.7 billion of the measures. \nThe case could have some implications for President-elect Donald Trump 's ambitions to support U.S. business first and foremost. Rejecting some of the EU claims, the WTO found that only one of seven tax incentives provided by Washington state amounted to illegal subsidies for wings for the wide-body jet. In essence, the \"prohibited subsidy\" involved the reduction of business tax rate on the condition that the wings were produced domestically within the United States. \nMalmstrom called Monday's ruling \"an important victory for the EU and its aircraft industry.\" \n\"We expect the U.S. to respect the rules, uphold fair competition, and withdraw these subsidies without any delay,\" Malmstrom said in a statement. \nAirbus had already confidently predicted victory at the WTO over the Washington state tax incentives, saying during the latest tit-for-tat showdown in September that the alleged subsidies would \"almost certainly be condemned as illegal.\" Airbus had made that assertion after the trade body had found that the EU had provided billions of dollars of improper subsidies to the European plane maker. \n___ \nCasert reported from Brussels.

      "text": "November 28, 2016 9:37 AM Trade body says Boeing was offered illegal tax breaks in US By RAF CASERT and JAMEY KEATEN Associated Press Order Reprint of this Story GENEVA \nA World Trade Organization panel on Monday ruled that Washington state offered billions in illegal tax breaks to plane maker Boeing, and that the U.S. government must take action to end the plans within months. \nThe European Union, which backs Boeing's EU-based rival, Airbus, claimed it as a landmark victory in the longstanding battle between the two companies that dominate the global market for airplanes. \nThe ruling is but a part of a wider squabble involving accusations between the U.S. government and the 28-nation EU over support for Boeing and Airbus dating back to 2004. \nMonday's decision found that the support Washington state promised to give Boeing from 2024 to 2040 amounted to \"prohibited\" subsidies. The support offered by Washington came on condition that Boeing keeps the production of the wings of the wide-bodied 777x plane in the state, excluding foreign competition. \nBoeing has extensive plants around Seattle and the EU says the subsidies would have amounted to $8.7 billion. EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said the WTO ruled against $5.7 billion of the measures. \nThe case could have some implications for President-elect Donald Trump's ambitions to support U.S. business first and foremost. Rejecting some of the EU claims, the WTO found that only one of seven tax incentives provided by Washington state amounted to illegal subsidies for wings for the wide-body jet. In essence, the \"prohibited subsidy\" involved the reduction of business tax rate on the condition that the wings were produced domestically within the United States. \nMalmstrom called Monday's ruling \"an important victory for the EU and its aircraft industry.\" \n\"We expect the U.S. to respect the rules, uphold fair competition, and withdraw these subsidies without any delay,\" Malmstrom said in a statement. \nAirbus had already confidently predicted victory at the WTO over the Washington state tax incentives, saying during the latest tit-for-tat showdown in September that the alleged subsidies would \"almost certainly be condemned as illegal.\" Airbus had made that assertion after the trade body had found that the EU had provided billions of dollars of improper subsidies to the European plane maker.
