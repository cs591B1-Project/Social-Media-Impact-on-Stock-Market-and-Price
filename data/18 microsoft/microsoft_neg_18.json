      "text": "Microsoft released the original Xbox 15 years ago today 15 News Halo, Forza, and other franchises owe their success to Microsoft's inaugural entry in the console space. \nMicrosoft released the original Xbox on November 15, 2001, and the company is celebrating a decade and a half of all things Xbox by reflecting on notable firsts. \nSeveral of Microsoft's most venerable first-party franchises owe their popularity and success to the original Xbox. Bungie's Halo: Combat Evolved started as a third-person action game in development for the Mac before becoming exclusive to Xbox. Halo single-handedly put Xbox on the map, and is mentioned in the same conversation as other system-seller launch titles as Super Mario 64 and Wii Sports. \nTurn 10's Forza Motorsport debuted on May 3, 2005, just four months before the Xbox 360 console put \"OG\" Xbox out to pasture. My personal favorite Xbox title, Team Ninja's reimagining of Tecmo's Ninja Gaiden, emerged from the shadows in 2004. \nMore than any single franchise, the Xbox ushered in online gaming. Console had gone online before; Sega's Dreamcast was a notable example. However, Xbox was the first console to make online multiplayer simple and widespread. \nMicrosoft executives past and present have been reminiscing about OG Xbox as of late. Designer Sheamus Blackley admitted that the \"Duke\" controller was \" embarrassingly huge ,\" but plenty of players grew to prefer it to smaller peripherals like Sony's DualShock 2. \nIn another interview, Xbox co-creator Ed Fries recalled how the then-nascent Xbox development team had to galvanize Bill Gates into approving the console's creation by insinuating that Sony would run roughshod in the living room space without Microsoft there to make a bid for it. \nEarlier today, Microsoft shared statistics that the Xbox brand has amassed over the past 15 years: Number of players: 222,468,423 Number of total gaming hours: 100,539,390,670 Number of total multiplayer hours: 29,000,304,183 Number of Achievements unlocked: 32,667,582,157 Gamerscore racked up: 572,605,554,587",

      "text": "Today's topics include Eugene Kaspersky's allegations that Microsoft Windows Defender is anti-competitive, the news that a new network worm could infect Internet of Things devices in the home, the unveiling of Facebook's Messenger Group Chat in Canada and Australia and the joint effort of the Linux Foundation and Reproducible Build to create a more secure software. \nEugene Kaspersky, founder of security vendor Kaspersky Lab isn't happy with Microsoft's business practices and he wants the whole world to know about it. \nKaspersky alleges that the close integration between Microsoft's Windows Defender security software and Windows 10 makes it more difficult for users to install alternative anti-malware applications from Kaspersky and other security software companies. \nThese claims are not falling on deaf ears as the Federal Antimonopoly Service in Kaspersky's native Russian Federation is now investigating the situation for any potential wrongdoing. \nA team of academic researchers demonstrated how even the simplest internet of things devices could be used to spread malicious code when they exploited a vulnerability in a popular smart light bulb to infect other devices. \nIn a draft research paper, researchers from the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel and Dalhousie University in Canada outlined their method of wresting control of Philips Hue smart lights from a home-automation network and then remotely updating the devices with malicious code. \nWith just 15,000 randomly distributed smart lights in an urban area, a network worm could spread in a chain reaction throughout a city the size of Paris, the researchers concluded using a type of analysis known as percolation theory. \nFacebook is in the process of enabling groups of people, and not necessarily \"friends\" who know each other, to interact around specific topics in real time on the social network. \nThe app, called Rooms, is the same as a standalone app it attempted two years ago but then pulled back right after it bought WhatsApp for $19 billion in February 2014. However, users in the United States will have to wait for a while to be able to use it. \nThe launch, which Facebook has discussed publicly earlier this year, was rolled out Nov. 11 through 13 in Canada and Australia. It is apparently a test to see if Facebook's Messenger chat platform is able to both scale and enable more public conversations focused on specific topics. \nIn an effort to help open-source software developers build more secure applications, the Linux Foundation is doubling down on its efforts to help the Reproducible Builds Project. \nAmong the most basic and often most difficult aspects of software development is making sure that software end-users get the same software code that developers actually built. \n\"Reproducible builds are a set of software development practices that create a verifiable path from human readable source code to the binary code used by computers,\" the Reproducible Builds project explains. \nWithout the promise of a verified reproducible build, security can potentially be compromised, as the binary code might not be the same as the original developer intended. The Reproducible Builds project benefits from the support of the Linux Foundation's Core Infrastructure Initiative.",

      "text": "Microsoft CEO Meets Chinese Official One Day After Warning on Trump Tax Plan GO Satya Nadella meets Communist Party of China leader Nov 15, 2016 13:53 GMT · By Bogdan Popa · Share: Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella traveled to China to meet Liu Yunshan, a senior leader of the Communist Party of China (CPC), and discuss a series of topics, including ways to improve collaboration between the company and the country. Local media is reporting that Microsoft’s CEO praised the firm’s partnership with China and promised to work together with the country on developing new products. Liu, who according to CCTV is a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, said “he hoped Microsoft would share its technology with China and contribute to cooperation between Chinese and U.S. businesses.” Donald Trump’s 45 percent import tariff While it’s not clear what exactly Microsoft sharing technology with China actually means, the software giant is clearly playing a key role in the tech partnership between the United States and China, especially now that Donald Trump has been elected the new President of the US. Furthermore, the meeting comes only one day after China issued a warning regarding an import tariff that President Trump might propose according to the promises he made during the presidential campaign. In an effort to force American companies invest more in domestic production, Trump said he would impose a 45 percent import tariff on Chinese goods . China, on the other hand, warned that should the new President go for such a rule, the country would adopt a tit-for-tat approach, planning similar taxes for US companies that are doing business within its borders. Apple was named as one of the companies that would be significantly impacted should Donald Trump go forward with this tax, but there’s no doubt that Microsoft itself would also be hit. Satya Nadella most likely discussed this matter as well, especially because Microsoft is betting big on its Chinese operations and it hopes to benefit more from the local growth.",

      "text": "Apple Downplays Microsoft Surface, Says Having Touch on a Desktop Is a Disaster GO Phil Schiller says Apple actually considered a touch Mac Nov 15, 2016 13:34 GMT · By Bogdan Popa · Share: ​ While Microsoft is pushing hard for touchscreens and devices that can be used with a pen, Apple sticks with a more traditional input method, going for laptops and desktops that do not feature the technology that its Redmond rival seems to love so much these days. Apple's senior vice president of worldwide marketing Phil Schiller revealed in a recent interview that his company actually looked at the possibility of bringing a touchscreen on its devices, but decided to stick with the old approach that makes more sense for its users. What’s more, he described having touch on a desktop “a disaster,” pointing out that users of such devices expect to work with a mouse and keyboard and not to mix input methods with touch. “Can you imagine a 27-inch iMac where you have to reach over the air to try to touch and do things? That becomes absurd. You can’t optimize for both. It’s the lowest common denominator thinking,” he said. Microsoft thinks otherwise Microsoft’s Surface Studio is fully based on this approach and has a 28-inch screen that also supports touch and which can be used on the desktop with a mouse and keyboard, touch, pen, or Surface Dial. But as far as Apple is concerned, this isn’t the right way to go because customers still love the mouse and keyboard, as it helps them be productive all the time at the desk. Schiller claims that Apple considered implementing touch in MacBooks and iMacs several times in the last few years, but every time, the company just decided to go with its instinct and stay away from this technology. “Our instincts were that it didn't, but, what the heck, we could be wrong - so our teams worked on that for a number of times over the years. Our instincts were correct,” he pointed out. Microsoft, on the other hand, isn’t necessarily looking to launch products that rely on the traditional input methods, but to invent new categories, and this is exactly what the Surface Pro, the Surface Book, and the Surface Studio achieved. Microsoft has until now managed to achieve its goal, and with Apple going in a completely different direction, it’ll be interesting to see which company achieves better sales.",

      "text": "Microsoft Makes It Possible to Use Skype Without an Account GO Better late than never: chat as guest on Skype Nov 15, 2016 09:28 GMT · By Bogdan Popa · Share: Microsoft has just announced that users can now start a conversation on Skype without even creating an account, so everyone can now enjoy the essential features of the VoIP platform right away. To do this, users only have to point their browsers to skype.com, where they can instantly start a new conversation. Once the conversation UI loads, Skype provides you with a link, which you have to send to your contacts to be able to chat. This new system allows chats, voice and videos calls, screen sharing, and file sharing, and anyone can join a conversation, even guests like you who don’t have a Microsoft account. Up to 300 people in a conversation Using Skype as guest allows conversations involving up to 300 people when it comes to text chats and up to 25 people for video and voice calls. Conversations are saved for 24 hours and then they are automatically removed, Microsoft guarantees. “The millions of people who visit Skype.com every month usually want to do one thing; they want to start a conversation with a friend, loved one or colleague as quickly as possible. But sometimes, technology can get in the way, particularly if you don’t have the time to sign up for an account to use it,” Microsoft explains. While this feature certainly comes in handy, there’s no doubt that this feature arrives a little bit too late, especially because the majority of companies offering instant messaging apps are also implementing voice and video calls. WhatsApp, for instance, is now rolling out video calling support ,and given its popularity across the world, it’s pretty clear that many people are going to use it. At the same time, look at this Skype improvement in a different way: links to join a conversation need to be shared with contacts and if you’re not going for email, the only option is to send it via a messaging app. But what’s the point of sending a link to a conversation using a messaging app that already supports texts, voice, and video calls?",

      "text": "Microsoft Fixes Windows 10 Mobile Quiet Hours, Lets Alarms Break Through GO New feature to be shipped to insiders in next build Nov 15, 2016 08:42 GMT · By Bogdan Popa · Share: Microsoft has just confirmed that the next Windows 10 Mobile build would come with a new feature that will allow alarm apps to break through quiet hours, an option that many users have been requesting for months. A Microsoft Windows developer confirmed on UserVoice that this feature would be part of the next build aimed at the fast ring, which is expected to go live as soon as this week. The UserVoice post has gathered more than 4,400 votes since it was published in June 2016. “We just enabled this in the next Insider fast-ring flight of the Creators Update! All third-party alarm apps will break through quiet hours now, just like the first-party alarm app! Thank you everyone for letting us know that this feature was important to you!” the Microsoft developer announced. Devs need to implement this feature in their apps Without a doubt, this is a handy addition to the Windows 10 Mobile feature arsenal, as previously, alarm apps were not allowed to break through quiet hours, making it impossible for phones to wake you up in the morning. But starting with the next build for insiders, and the Creators Update for everyone else, users will be allowed to configure the alarm apps that are allowed to ignore quiet hours settings. What’s very important, however, is that developers themselves need to add this functionality to their apps, so while Microsoft will make it available in the next Windows 10 Mobile, it could still take a while until users actually get to try it. On the other hand, quiet hours works on phones only when Cortana is activated, so in regions where the personal assistant is not available, it’s still impossible to set up this feature. Microsoft is expected to make quiet hours work independently from Cortana, but for the moment only those who have access to the personal assistant can use it. The Creators Update is due in early 2017, most likely March, and quite a lot can change in the meantime.",

All discounts will be available in the Microsoft Store and will go live at 12:01 AM ET on November 24, and will obviously continue as long as supplies last. Microsoft will be offering up to $430 off Surface devices and promises to sell the Xbox One S at the lowest price ever, as the console will be on sale starting at just $249. Of course, there will also be several games available with a discount, including Gears of War 4, which will cost $25 less. Windows 10 devices, however, will be the big stars of the sale, and not only Microsoft’s Surface will be offered with price cuts, but also models manufactured by Dell, HP, and Acer. “If you’re looking to upgrade your tech this holiday, there’s no better time to buy than Black Friday. Microsoft Store and other retailers across the country are offering some of the steepest discounts of the year on Microsoft’s hottest selling PCs and game consoles, so there’s something for everyone on your shopping list,” Microsoft announced.

      "text": "  \nMicrosoft has left its Skype acquisition relatively untouched since its merger years ago, but as messaging looks to become a revived battleground for companies of the future, it seems the company has a new vested interest in reigning in its competitive weapon. \nDuring several keynotes and conferences, Microsoft has made it clear that Skype will play a much bigger role in the lives of Office, Windows 10 and mobile users and as a preemptive measure, the company is now looking to combine the user identities of the two services into one streamlined sign experience. \nHere are 3 relatively easy steps for owners of a Microsoft account as well as a Skype account, to combine the two into a single sign in. \n1. Go to https://account.microsoft.com . \n2. Sign in with your Skype name. \n3. We’ll ask you to update your Skype account with an email address – \nThat’s it! You’re all set! You can now use your Skype name or your email address to sign into all Microsoft apps and services. Remember to use the password for your Microsoft account, regardless of whether you use your Skype name or email address to sign in. \nUsers should note, if they are already signed into Outlook, OneDrive or any other Microsoft property online and have asked their selected browser to keep them signed in, there is an additional step that mus be taken. Users will need to log out of the Microsoft property and then follow the above steps. \nAside from that note, it seems Microsoft has made a concerted effort to ease the process of combining both a current Skype and Microsoft account. \nLet us know in the comments how easy or difficult it was to combine the two.

      "title": "Viscira® Leverages Microsoft HoloLens to Deliver Unique Mixed Reality Solutions",
      "text": "Multiple reports have predicted that, within 10 years, Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) could produce revenue in the tens of billions of dollars. A recent industry report on the future of AR/VR from September 2016 also estimated that roughly 25% of the investment in this technology will be directed to healthcare. Viscira, a leading provider of digital marketing solutions and software products for the life sciences industry, has recognized this opportunity and is actively capitalizing on these advancements by offering innovative VR and AR solutions that communicate healthcare information in very personal and immersive ways. Most recently, the company has begun development efforts using the Microsoft HoloLens, a mixed reality, holographic headset that incorporates both virtual reality and augmented reality by seamlessly blending high-definition holograms with the real world.\nViscira’s HoloLens solutions aim to create networked VR experiences by connecting health care professionals (HCPs) remotely and transporting them into 3D virtual worlds. These worlds can depict a mechanism of action of a drug or a virtual conference environment. For example, the HoloLens might “teleport” a hologram of a Key Opinion Leader (KOL) enabling them to speak directly in front of a health care professional in their own environment (e.g. office, living room, etc.). This would simulate the experience of presenting to someone in person in the same physical space, while offering the convenience of remote attendance.\nRodwin Pabello, Viscira’s Director of Product Development, commented on the use of mixed reality technology for developing compelling communication programs for its clients. “We are very excited about the advancements we are seeing with VR/AR technology and what they can do for medical communication and marketing. We are exploring many different applications for using the Microsoft HoloLens. In the future, this type of technology might even supplant the iPad as a primary tool for interaction between a pharma sales rep and a healthcare professional.”\nViscira’s virtual and augmented reality solutions are examples of the innovative, interactive software applications and digital solutions the company offers. Viscira’s strategic approach, combined with its delivery of cutting-edge products, has resulted in an impressive roster of clients that includes 21 of the top 25 pharma and biotech companies in the world.\nAbout Viscira\nViscira is dedicated to the design and development of digital marketing solutions and interactive software applications for the life sciences industry. Viscira provides a suite of programs that integrate best-in-class technology to deliver engaging and memorable content via various electronic channels. Viscira is part of the Sudler & Hennessey Group, a leading global healthcare communications network.

They've been transparent in sharing information.\"\nExperts in Bing Ads understand that products and features can provide the best advice to brands looking to purchase media that serves up on Bing.\nThe Ads partner program launches today in the United States and Asia-Pacific, but rolls out globally to Europe, Canada and Brazil on Jan. 15, 2017.\nIn the United States, the program now has about 30 Elite members -- with more than 200 Select and more than 1,000 Partners.\nAs Bing gains momentum and the Bing Network grows worldwide with 31.9% share in the United States, 23.3% in the United Kingdom and 14.1% in Australia, Bing's partnership network will foster collaboration with agencies, technology partners and SMB partners.\nFerreres Palou said the company also is working to forge partnerships with the Microsoft partner network and other networks throughout the company to gain leads for Bing Ads partners. \"It's early days,\" she said, \"But we are working to establish those connections internally,\"",

      "text": "Asa Mathat | ReCode Slack exec April underwood. Email killer Slack is under attack from email giant Microsoft , but Slack executives say they welcome competition, with a little trepidation. \n\"It's flattering in some ways,\" said April Underwood, vice president of product at Slack. \"It's also, honestly, it's a little scary.\" Underwood' comments came at the Code Enterprise conference in San Francisco on Tuesday. Microsoft launched a rival workplace messaging service earlier this month .\nMicrosoft's investment in this space has brought more attention to the overall category and validates Slack's thesis that people need better ways to communicate at work, said Underwood. But the Seattle-based giant of email has many more users and far greater resources than venture-backed start-up Slack.\n\n\n\"They're a little bit larger than us as a company, they have some resources available to them and some distribution advantages available to them that we don't have,\" she said. \n\nCEO Stewart Butterfield took out this ad in the New York Times ahead of Microsoft's launch of Teams, its rival product. \nThat feeling when you think \"we should buy a full page in the Times and publish an open letter,\" and then you do. \n\n\"We're not surprised that that product came out, we had a sense that it was coming,\" said April Underwood, vice president of product at Slack. \nIndeed, completion is heating up. Facebook , with its last month rolled out a business chat product called Workplace by Facebook , which incorporates some similar messaging features.\nSlack now has 4 million daily active users, 750 developer apps integrated into its service which are used by 90 percent of companies which use Slack's paid service. \nApps and artificially intelligent bots on Slack are two key things the company hopes will differentiate its service from competitors. Slack has recently announced with partnerships with IBM Watson to make its bots on Slack smarter, Salesforce , and Alphabet 's Google, whose venture arm has invested in Slack.",

      "text": "Microsoft to use Kansas wind farm for data center Published 12:06 pm,   DODGE CITY, Kan. (AP) — Microsoft has announced that it will purchase 178 megawatts of production from a wind farm under construction near Dodge City. The Wichita Eagle ( http://bit.ly/2gdpTwL ) reports that the purchase from Bloom Wind will be a portion of the 237 megawatts of alternative energy Microsoft is buying to supply through the grid to its Cheyenne, Wyoming, data center. The wind farm will consist of 54 towers across 15,000 acres of privately-owned land about 20 miles south of Dodge City in Ford and Clark counties. Capital Power will operate the wind farm and has contracted the facility's output to a subsidiary of Allianz, which plans to sell the power to Microsoft for 10 years. ___ Information from: The Wichita (Kan.)

      "text": "Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Pin it \n(Microsoft) Shown in the photo is Microsoft Surface Pro 4. According to latest rumors, the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 will arrive in 2017 and will challenge iPad Pro 2. \nAlthough Microsoft has not released any official statement yet, it is believed that the Redmond-based tech giant will release its Surface Pro 5 next year and will take on Apple's iPad Pro 2. \nDespite the skepticism of tech pundits, there were still some people who expected that Microsoft would unveil the Surface Pro 5 in its event last month. However, with the device a no-show at the said event, the latest in the rumor mill is that it will debut next year, just in time for the release of the iPad Pro 2, which is also expected to arrive next year. \nAccording to rumors , one of the reasons why Microsoft did not reveal the Surface Pro 5 last month is that the upcoming device will pack the latest Intel processor, the Kaby Lake, which, according to reports, has just been shipped out. As the Surface Pro 5 was a no-show at the Microsoft event last month, rumors about it packing the Intel Kaby Lake processor have become even louder. \nApart from packing the Intel Kaby Lake processor that will make it its battery life longer and improve its overall performance, it is also said that the Surface Pro 5 will also boast of 16 GB of RAM and 1 TB of internal storage. Advertisement \nMeanwhile, Microsoft has announced that it will be slashing as much as US$429 for its Surface Pro 4 that comes with a Core i5 processor, 256 GB of storage, and a Surface Type Cover. Because of the discount, the device will only carry a price tag of $999. The same unit will be offered at a much lower cost if a buyer opts not to go for one that comes with the Type Cover; instead of paying $999, a customer will only pay $699. \nThe promo will run from Nov. 24 to 28 and is only applicable to purchases made at Microsoft Stores and Best Buys.

If you are affiliated with this page and would like it removed please contact pressreleases@franklyinc.com\nSOURCE Microsoft Corp.\nWith 30 million trials of last year's Hour of Code tutorial, Microsoft and Code.org believe the new offering will again introduce tens of millions to coding for the first time; Microsoft Stores to also host coding workshops worldwide during Computer Science Education Week.\nREDMOND, Wash. , Nov. 15, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Microsoft Corp. and Code.org on Tuesday unveiled the Minecraft Hour of Code Designer, a coding tutorial for students and educators created for Hour of Code , an annual, global campaign held during Computer Science Education Week, Dec. 5 – 11. The new web-based tutorial - available for free at http://code.org/minecraft - enables beginner coders to create and share their own simple \"Minecraft\" game, and is designed to empower anyone to begin learning the problem-solving and critical thinking skills required in today's tech-fueled world.\nCreated by \"Minecraft\" game designers at Mojang and Microsoft, in partnership with Code.org, the fun and easy-to-learn one-hour experience builds on the success of last year's record-breaking \"Minecraft\" tutorial, which reached more than 30 million students worldwide. With the goal of inspiring millions more to try coding for the first time - and to keep going on their journey of learning computer science - as of today's launch, the tutorial is available in 10 languages, including Spanish. It is scheduled to be available in 50 languages by Dec. 5 .\nWith the immense popularity of \"Minecraft\" around the world, Microsoft and Code.org believe the tutorial has the potential to reach people of all ages and likeness. Women and girls already compose nearly half of the game's global fan base. The tutorial also underscores Microsoft's commitment to ensuring all young people have the opportunity to learn computer science, an economic and social imperative in this era of digital transformation, which is expected to generate 1.4 million computing jobs in the U.S. alone by 2020 according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics . In the U.S., 40 percent of schools do not teach computer science, and Microsoft aims to reach students most likely to be among those without access, particularly girls and minorities.\n\"We are partnering with Code.org again this year to make computer science more accessible to millions of youth around the world with 'Minecraft' and Hour of Code,\" said Satya Nadella , CEO, Microsoft. \"I am inspired by the 'Minecraft' generation who view themselves not as players of a game, but as creators of the new worlds they dream up. This is the generation that will imagine, build and create our future, and together we can equip them with the computational thinking and problem-solving skills to seize the opportunities ahead.\"\nDesigned for ages 6 and up, the Minecraft Hour of Code Designer teaches students to create their own \"Minecraft\" experience where they can program the rules. They can make chickens that drop gold, or zombies that run away instead of attacking. Along the way, students use Code.org's familiar drag-and-drop coding interface to learn computer science concepts such as object-oriented programming, event handlers and repeat loops. Players face a series of 12 challenges, culminating in creating their own simple game, which they can share with friends.\n\"The 2016 Minecraft Hour of Code tutorial builds on the success of the original in a great way,\" said Mike Harvey , technology teacher from Falmouth, Maine . \"By programming familiar game events themselves, learners will be able to experience computer science in a way that is authentic as well as fun. The open-ended challenges help to show that our favorite games (like 'Minecraft') are ultimately created with code.\"\n\"Code.org was founded with the vision that every student in every school should have the opportunity to learn computer science - not only because it's foundational for any career, but because students love it,\" said Hadi Partovi , co-founder and CEO, Code.org. \"'Minecraft' is a special game that appeals to a diverse global community. We're delighted to have the chance to teach students coding with the fun familiarity of 'Minecraft,' to engage students of all backgrounds and skill levels.\"\nIn support of Code.org and the global Hour of Code campaign, Microsoft will also lead thousands of youth coding events in more than 60 countries. During Computer Science Education Week, this includes hundreds of free workshops hosted by Microsoft Stores across the globe. Students can reserve a spot in a store workshop by visiting microsoft.com/youthsparkprograms and also visit their local Microsoft Store to learn more.\nIn addition to the latest tutorial and coding events, Microsoft has also been receiving rave reviews from educators on the newly launched \"Minecraft: Education Edition\" title, a fully featured title that brings the magic of \"Minecraft\" to the classroom for more immersive, long- term lesson plans.\nAbout Code.org\nCode.org® is a 501c3 public non-profit dedicated to expanding participation in computer science and increasing participation by women and underrepresented students of color. Its vision is that every student in every school should have the opportunity to learn computer programming. Code.org is the organizer of the annual Hour of Code campaign, which has engaged 10% of all K-12 students in the world, and the leading provider of curriculum for K-12 computer science in all of the largest school districts in the United States . Code.org is supported by philanthropic donations from corporations, foundations, and generous individuals, including Microsoft, Facebook, the Infosys Foundation, Google, Omidyar Network, Ballmer Family Giving, and others.\nAbout Microsoft\nMicrosoft (Nasdaq \"MSFT\" @microsoft) is the leading platform and productivity company for the mobile-first, cloud-first world, and its mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more.\nFor more information about Code.org, visit https://www.Code.org .\nFor more information about Minecraft's use in education, visit http://education.minecraft.net .\nFor more information about Microsoft's commitment to ensuring access to computer science education for all youth, visit https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/philanthropies/youthspark .\nLogo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20000822/MSFTLOGO\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/microsoft-and-codeorg-announce-free-minecraft-hour-of-code-tutorial-for-computer-science-education-week-dec-511-300362628.html\n©2016 PR Newswire.

      "text": "Computer Technology - How Laptops, Personal Computers And Tablets Are Changing The World Now Playing Microsoft has announced a new partnership with Elon Musk's OpenAI nonprofit to advance and democratize artificial intelligence. Between OpenAI and Microsoft AI and Research, open-source AI breakthroughs should not take too long to surface. Pictured here are Harry Shum, Microsoft AI and Research Group executive vice president, and Sam Altman, co-chair of OpenAI. ( Microsoft Blog ) Advertisement \nMicrosoft is partnering its artificial intelligence research arm with Elon Musk's nonprofit OpenAI, announcing the \"industry's first cloud bot-as-a-service\" on Microsoft Azure. \nUnder the arrangement, OpenAI will be able to tap Microsoft's virtual machine technology to run large-scale artificial intelligence simulation and training exercises, while Microsoft will have state-of-the-art research on Azure. \nArtificial intelligence has enabled various perks such as real-time translation , smart digital assistants and more, but it's not readily accessible to everyone. Democratizing AI \n\"At Microsoft, we believe everyone deserves to be able to take advantage of these breakthroughs, in both their work and personal lives,\" says Microsoft. \n\"In short, we are committed to democratizing AI and making it accessible to everyone.\" \nMicrosoft adds that OpenAI has the same endeavors, which is why the two companies have decided to team up and work on advancing the field of artificial intelligence and leverage the power of AI to address challenging problems the world is facing. \nElon Musk and San Altman of Y Combinator founded OpenAI last December, pledging a hefty $1 billion to the nonprofit AI research venture. OpenAI aims to develop artificial intelligence that has positive impacts on society in the long run, rather than just creating software for profit. Why This Matters \nOpenAI has some of the world's best AI experts working on research that could help drive machine intelligence advancements and make essential breakthroughs. Moreover, OpenAI is a nonprofit organization and is committed to sharing its knowledge and breakthroughs and collaborate with others to push its goals. \nMicrosoft Research, meanwhile, has substantially contributed to open-source technologies and has pledged not to own and restrict knowledge, on the contrary. The company wants to have cutting-edge research on Microsoft Azure cloud computing to prove how it works and to encourage other companies to follow suit. \nSince every company that taps Microsoft Azure as its cloud platform has to pay for the cloud services, Microsoft stands to benefit even more. On a larger scale, Microsoft aims to rival Facebook and Google, both of which have been investing billions of dollars in machine intelligence. \nThe new partnership with OpenAI better positions Microsoft has a major player on the AI scene and the breakthroughs that result from this collaboration could benefit the whole world. Azure Bot Service \nIn addition to this new collaboration with OpenAI, Microsoft has also announced a new Azure Bot Service, promoting it as the \"industry's first cloud bot-as-a-service.\" The Azure Bot Service will allow developers to speed up their bot development using the Microsoft Bot Framework, as well as deploy and manage their bots in a server-less environment on Azure.

      "text": "  \nPerhaps, in an effort to usher in the future, Microsoft has reaffirmed its stance on not extending support for Office 2007 products beyond its original October 2017 deadline. \nIT Pros banking on Microsoft softening its stance on the October 2017 deadline should begin looking into transitioning to either Office 2016, Offie 365 or another productivity suite during the 2017 calendar year. \n“The Office 2007 wave of products will be reaching end of support over the next 12 months, as per Microsoft Lifecycle Policy. After those end of support dates, we will no longer offer custom support on any version of Office products (Exchange Server; Office Suites; SharePoint Server; Office Communications Server; Lync Server; Skype for Business Server; Project Server and Visio). \n“In the past we have offered custom support for a subset of Office products to customers with Premier support contracts. We have seen demand for custom support decline as more customers move to Office 365. Note that this change applies only to custom support, but does not impact any of the standard support offerings. \n“As always, customers should consult with their account manager regarding their individual migration plans, and may consider services such as Software Assurance Deployment & Planning Services for on-premises upgrades, and Microsoft FastTrack for cloud migrations. \nFor anyone using Office 2007 in a non-employment capacity should note that end of support means that there will be no security patches or fixes coming to the software (at all) after the October 2017 deadline. While the Office suite of apps aren’t known to be large targets for nefarious activity, lack of fixes and feature parity could be a reason for customers to upgrade. \nWhile Microsoft currently remains steadfast on the October 2017 deadline, Windows reporter Mary Jo Foley has heard from company insiders that: \nThere still might be a bit of an extension for Premier customers on Exchange 2007 with Service Pack 3. \nI’ve heard approved Premier customers still on the 2007 release of Exchange might be able to request a one-time free six-month extension that would let them get critical security updates between April 2017 and October 2017. But it is sounding like after October 2017, the Microsoft 2007 wave of Office client and server products won’t be getting security updates any longer.” \nDespite the 11 month reminder, there will undoubtedly be Office 2007 customers caught off guard. For Microsoft’s sake, hopefully, they will continue to remind customers in-app and through other means of the impending end of support.  ",

      "text": "Markets Today Apple's Smart Glasses Can Succeed, But It Has to Move Fast to Beat Microsoft and Facebook The failings of Google Glass and the limitations of Microsoft's HoloLens provide an opening for Apple in augmented reality. But the clock's ticking. Eric Jhonsa Nov15,20165:01PMEST \nIf Apple ( AAPL ) ultimately produces smart glasses that prove to be a smash hit, it should send a thank-you card to Alphabet /Google ( GOOGL ) for all its missteps with Google Glass. \nAnd the company might also want to thank Microsoft ( MSFT ) for both showing how an augmented reality (AR) headset can capture imaginations and appeal to developers, and initially focusing on a headset that's only meant to be used indoors. But this assumes that Microsoft won't have enlarged its ambitions by the time Apple's own headset goes on sale. \nBloomberg, which has produced many Apple scoops since hiring the well-connected Mark Gurman away from 9to5 Mac, reported Monday that Apple is thinking about creating smart glasses that would \"connect wirelessly to iPhones, show images and other information in the wearer's field of vision, and may use augmented reality.\" \nIt adds Apple has \"ordered small quantities of near-eye displays from one supplier for testing,\" and that its glasses would launch in 2018 \"at the earliest.\" Himax ( HIMX ) , which supplied the micro-displays used by Google Glass, rose 2.7% on Tuesday. \nOne big qualifier to Bloomberg's report is that Apple often \"explores\" launching products that never see the light of day. However, the report does fit with one earlier this year from The Financial Times , which said Apple has created \"a large team of experts in virtual and augmented reality and built prototypes of headsets.\" \nApple and Alphabet are holdings in Jim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS Charitable Trust Portfolio .

      "text": "Microsoft Surface Phone to rival iPhone 8, Galaxy S8 in 2017 with innovative Redmond-based software By Harsh Soni Nov 15, 2016 06:17 AM EST Advertisement \nAfter the failure of Microsoft Lumia series, the company now has done a great amount of research to build a new smartphone which will meet the expectations of users. Now latest rumors say that Microsoft is planning to go big with the upcoming Surface Phone. \nEarlier this month, known leakster Evan Blass has uploaded a series of photos on his twitter account, which people initially supposed was the Microsoft Surface Phone. As exciting as the news sounded, it was also immediately clarified that the leaked images were not of the Microsoft Surface Phone. Advertisement \nEvan Blass pointed out that he did not announce anything and it was not the Microsoft Surface Phone. Although then it turned out to be a Windows phablet from Dell. Microsoft fans are in the dark about the device and have questioned if Microsoft is even working on the gadget at all or not. \nMicrosoft Surface Phone is the highly expected smartphone which is coming in 2017. If rumors are to true then the Microsoft Surface Phone will be equipped with Snapdragon 830 processor. Microsoft is gearing up to release the latest flagship, which is said to bring the Redmond-based software to the smartphone segment. \nAccording to MobiPicker , there will be three variants of the Surface Phone. The first and cheapest will have 3 GB RAM with 32 GB internal storage. While the second variant will have 6 GB of RAM, with 128 GB internal storage and the most expensive variant will have an 8 GB RAM with 500 GB internal storage. The same high-end device could also have an installed Intel Atom X3 chipset. \nA few days back an image leaked shows that the phone will be featuring a Snapdragon 830 processor with 5.7-inch display and a 2K resolution. Also the rear camera capacity has been noted as 20MP. \nThere are speculation regarding features like fingerprint reader, compass, barometer, proximity sensors and a 20-megapixel Carl Zeiss rear camera to have in Surface Phone. According to Tech Radar , the Surface Phone could have a display-embedded fingerprint scanner, which represents the character of next-gen smartphones. \nMNR Daily wrote that there is no confirmed news regarding the release of the Microsoft Surface Phone, but the mobile device is definitely not expected to arrive within this year. The earliest date that users can expect to market is the first quarter of 2017. © 2016 HNGN , All rights reserved. Do not reproduce without permission. ",

      "text": "OpenAI will use Microsoft's cloud, as Azure gains more features The partnership shows momentum for AI workloads in Microsoft's cloud More like this   8:56 AM   \nMicrosoft's continued investment in artificial intelligence and machine learning technology is paying dividends. The company has partnered with OpenAI, a nonprofit company founded earlier this year to advance the field of machine intelligence for the benefit of humanity. \nAs part of the deal, announced Tuesday, OpenAI will use Microsoft Azure as its primary cloud provider, an important win for Microsoft as it competes with the likes of Amazon, Google, and IBM to power the next generation of intelligent applications. OpenAI is backed by the likes of Tesla CEO Elon Musk, controversial investor Peter Thiel, LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, and Y Combinator Partner Jessica Livingston. \nOn top of that, Microsoft also launched a set of cloud services all aimed at furthering intelligent applications. The new Azure Bot Service makes it easier for people to spin up intelligent chat bots in Microsoft's cloud, while Azure Functions lets customers run compute functions without provisioning servers. The company also announced the general availability of its N-series virtual machines, which give customers the ability to use GPUs for high-performance computing tasks. \nMicrosoft has been working to position its cloud as the home for intelligent applications, and these announcements demonstrate further momentum toward that goal. \nThe N-series virtual machines made generally available Tuesday are an important part of that. They provide users with the ability to run high-performance workloads in the cloud that require the power of GPUs to handle massive parallel computing tasks. It's a service that OpenAI has already been taking advantage of, along with other customers like Esri and Jellyfish Pictures. \nFor companies that want a pre-built service, the Azure Bot Service provides users with a number of templates that they can use to get started building intelligent, conversational assistants. It's built to easily plug into other Azure services, like Microsoft's Language Understanding Intelligent Service (LUIS), which helps computer programs parse human language. \nOne of the other key services included in Microsoft's news on Tuesday is Azure Functions, which lets customers set up a snippet of code that runs whenever a set of conditions is met. Microsoft handles all the provisioning of compute resources necessary to run the Functions, so users don't have to worry about running a virtual machine all the time to handle irregular events. \nMaking Azure Functions generally available is important to Microsoft's competition with Amazon Web Services. The other Seattle-area cloud provider launched its AWS Lambda service two years ago, and it has proven a popular tool for leveraging the power of what has been called \"serverless\" computing.

      "text": "By Kurt Mackie 11/15/2016 \nMicrosoft announced a few Azure milestones today and showcased developer options to tap into its new compute capabilities. \nAdditionally, Microsoft offered a vision statement about its efforts to \"democratize\" artificial intelligence. To that end, Microsoft has partnered with OpenAI, a nonprofit research organization that aims to \"advance digital intelligence\" to \"benefit humanity.\" OpenAI announced today that it will use Microsoft Azure infrastructure for \"most\" of its deep learning and artificial intelligence research. \nBy democratizing artificial intelligence, Microsoft means \"making it accessible to everyone.\" Artificial intelligence systems today can recognize words in conversations and \"provide real-time translation.\" These systems are getting better because of \"advances in fields such as reinforcement learning,\" Microsoft contended. \nMicrosoft has a number of Azure services that can support artificial intelligence and deep learning capabilities. Some milestones associated with those services were announced today. \nAzure N-Series General Availability For instance, Microsoft is planning to make its Azure N-Series of virtual machines generally available on Dec. 1, with rollouts planned for Azure datacenters in \"South Central US, East US, West Europe and South East Asia\" regions, according to an Azure blog post . \nThere are two virtual machine types under the N-Series, namely \"NC\" and \"NV.\" The NC virtual machines use Nvidia Tesla K80 graphical processing units (GPUs) for high-performance computing and artificial intelligence workloads. The NV virtual machines run Nvidia Tesla M60 GPUs. \nThe announcement by OpenAI indicated that it was \"impressed\" by the availability of \"K80 GPUs with InfiniBand interconnects at scale,\" which is an option under the Azure NC24r virtual machine subscription plan. This option is good for \"tightly coupled jobs,\" according to Microsoft's Azure blog post: \nInfiniBand provides close to bare-metal performance even when scaling out to 10s, 100s, or even 1,000s of GPUs across hundreds of machines. This will allow you to submit tightly coupled jobs using frameworks like the Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (CNTK), Caffe, or TensorFlow, enabling training for natural language processing, image recognition, and object detection. \nThe City of Hope is using the N-Series for biological modeling. Algorithmia, a marketplace provider of algorithms, is able to offer products based on the Azure's GPU-accelerated capabilities with the new N-Series. \nBot Service Preview Microsoft announced the preview today of a new Azure Bot Service. The service taps the Bot Framework that was announced at the Microsoft Build developer event in late March, as well as Azure Functions , which was at preview at that time but which has now reached general availability status. \nThe Azure Bot Service lets developers integrate text or short messaging service bots into Web sites and applications via a REST-based API. Examples could include \"Slack, Facebook Messenger, Skype, Teams, Kik, Office 365 mail and other popular services,\" according to Microsoft's announcement . \nThe Azure Bot Service preview supports C# or Node.js for browser development. The service also provides templates for building bots. Microsoft is promising that coders can use \"the IDE and code editor of your choice.\" Deployment includes some automated capabilities, according to the announcement: \nThe Azure Bot Service uses an Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template to create an Azure Function App for easy deployment and automatically registers your bot in the Microsoft Bot Framework, which provides a public bot directory to increase the exposure of your bot. \nThe announcement suggested that bots can be further enhanced using other Azure services, such as Microsoft Cognitive Services and Azure Search. \nAzure Functions General Availability Azure Functions has reached general availability status in 12 regions. Full-price billing will start on Jan. 1, 2017. Customers that used Microsoft's Azure Functions service early on included Accuweather and Plexure, according to the announcement. \nMicrosoft describes Azure Functions as a \"serverless compute on Azure\" capability that can be \"triggered by events in Azure or third party services as well as on-premises systems.\" Developers can use the service to \"build HTTP-based APIs\" that can be tapped by applications and devices. \nAzure Functions is generally available today, but it just supports C# and JavaScript right now. The ability to use \"F#, PowerShell, PHP, Python and Bash\" is still at the preview stage. \nAlso at the beta test stage is a new command-line interface for Azure Functions, which can be used for \"creating, running and debugging Functions locally on Windows.\" Microsoft is working on future Linux and Mac command-line interface tooling for Azure Functions as well, but the timeline wasn't provided in the announcement. \nMicrosoft is touting the ability of Azure Functions users to easily create bindings to services with just a few clicks. Azure Functions currently has this capability for some Azure services, such as \"Blob Storage, Event Hub, Service Bus, [and] Storage Tables,\" according to Microsoft's announcement. However, Microsoft plans to preview a new \"binding extensibility framework\" next year for developers and independent software vendors that will create an \"extension ecosystem.\" It'll add bindings extensions support for applications such as \"SendGrid, Twillio, Box, DropBox and Google Drive,\" Microsoft's announcement suggested. \nThe pricing for Azure Functions is based on runtime and memory use. Microsoft claims that developers can \"set a maximum dialing spending cap to prevent runaway functions.\" About the Author \nis senior news producer for the 1105 Enterprise Computing Group. <>",

      "text": "Microsoft struck a partnership with Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence research group, OpenAI, and said the organization will use the company’s Azure cloud system for most of its large-scale experiments. \nOpenAI has been an early customer for Microsoft’s Azure N-Series Virtual Machines, a powerful cloud-computing service that relies on Nvidia graphical processing units. The two will also collaborate on ways to advance AI research and its use, Microsoft and Open AI said Tuesday in blog posts.\n“In the coming months we will use thousands to tens of thousands of these machines to increase both the number of experiments we run and the size of the models we train,” OpenAI said in its post. \nMicrosoft is investing in artificial intelligence research and product development in a variety of areas including medicine and bots, programs that chat with users to automate tasks. Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella has discussed the need for ethical rules as AI develops as well as creating ways to spread its benefits. \n      5,000   Musk, who heads Tesla Motors and Space Exploration Technologies, teamed up with Y Combinator President Sam Altman and others, to form the nonprofit OpenAI in December, seeking to ensure AI is developed safely and its benefits are widely distributed.\nMicrosoft also said it’s introducing the Azure Bot Service, a cloud service that lets companies and developers store and run bots in the Azure cloud. \nDina Bass  ",

      "text": "Home > Virtual Reality > HoloMaps hits Microsoft’s HoloLens headset… HoloMaps hits Microsoft’s HoloLens headset with 3D maps and remote collaboration November 15, 2016 4:40 PM Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends \nOn Monday, developer Taqtile launched HoloMaps for Microsoft’s HoloLens augmented reality headset. The app is available to all HoloLens owners for free in the Windows Store , providing wearers with a 3D holographic map they can navigate through while viewing overlaying real-time data in the process. Even more, HoloLens owners can check out these 3D maps alone, or with additional headset owners. \n“HoloMaps displays topography, infrastructure, and buildings in 3D while integrating data sources to bring contextually relevant information into the map. Collaborate and present to colleagues in the same room or remotely,” the company states. \nMore: Dutch museum is incorporating Hololens for augmented reality exhibits \nAccording to Taqtile, HoloMaps users can annotate holographs, models, and collaborate and/or showcase holographic presentations to local individuals or other clients/partners that are not physically present. The app can also be used to capture pictures and videos for presentations and sharing. \nOne of the first companies to test HoloMaps was the PGA Tour organization during the 2016 Players Championship. The platform was customized to project a 3D-holographic version of the championship’s home golf course, the TPC at Sawgrass, in Ponte Vedra, Florida. The map included geolocated data from the tour’s Shotlink tool to help with providing accurate shot analysis, golf course management, corporate tent layout management, and more. \nTaqtile said on Tuesday it recently worked with Microsoft to showcase its Enterprise Edition of HoloMaps at the Redmond, Washington, company’s Microsoft Technology Centers . The company also released a Store Edition version of its app that relies on Bing 3D to provide 3D models of more than 200 cities and landmarks. This version provides a solo experience that can be scaled to nearly any size and is fueled by data piped in from other sources such as geotagged tweets from Twitter, the current weather forecast, traffic incidents, and more. \n“The list of use cases for HoloMaps is extensive because the sources of data are endless,” Taqtile cofounder Dirck Schou said. “Think about how you currently visualize spatial data on flat monitors and on paper. Now think about how you would do that in 3D, and how interactions of data can be represented, which is difficult because it hasn’t been done before.” \nAs an example, Schou indicated HoloMaps would be a great tool for city planners. The HoloLens app provides means for visualizing utilities, demographics, and traffic flows. All of that data is pumped into HoloMaps at the same time, and to all participants in real time whether they are standing in the same office or seated at different desks across town. \nIn another example , HoloMaps could be used in an emergency such as a terrorist attack or a downtown traffic jam caused by a nasty wreck. City officials or agencies scattered across town could slap on their HoloLens, pull up a 3D representation of their city, and collaborate with each other in a makeshift virtual “command center.” Policemen, firefighters, and other on-ground responders with HoloLens could even tune in to see the notes provided in real time by the officials. \n“HoloMaps is going to be a game-changer,” Schou added.

Sorry IDG News Service | Nov 15, 2016 RELATED TOPICS Comments \nMicrosoft’s continued investment in artificial intelligence and machine learning technology is paying dividends. The company has partnered with OpenAI, a non-profit company founded earlier this year to advance the field of machine intelligence for the benefit of humanity. \nAs part of the deal, announced Tuesday, OpenAI will use Microsoft Azure as its primary cloud provider, an important win for Microsoft as it competes with the likes of Amazon, Google, and IBM to power the next generation of intelligent applications. OpenAI is backed by the likes of Tesla CEO Elon Musk, controversial investor Peter Thiel, LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, and Y Combinator Partner Jessica Livingston. [ The InfoWorld review: TensorFlow shines a light on deep learning . | Start here with TensorFlow . | Get a digest of the day's top tech stories in the InfoWorld Daily newsletter . ] \nOn top of that, Microsoft also launched a set of cloud services all aimed at furthering intelligent applications. The new Azure Bot Service makes it easier for people to spin up intelligent chat bots in Microsoft’s cloud, while Azure Functions lets customers run compute functions without provisioning servers. The company also announced the general availability of its N-series virtual machines, which give customers the ability to use GPUs for high-performance computing tasks. \nMicrosoft has been working to position its cloud as the home for intelligent applications, and these announcements demonstrate further momentum toward that goal. \nThe N-series virtual machines made generally available Tuesday are an important part of that. They provide users with the ability to run high-performance workloads in the cloud that require the power of GPUs to handle massive parallel computing tasks. It’s a service that OpenAI has already been taking advantage of, along with other customers like Esri and Jellyfish Pictures. \nFor companies that want a pre-built service, the Azure Bot Service provides users with a number of templates that they can use to get started building intelligent, conversational assistants. It’s built to easily plug into other Azure services, like Microsoft’s Language Understanding Intelligent Service (LUIS), which helps computer programs parse human language. \nOne of the other key services included in Microsoft’s news dump Tuesday is Azure Functions, which lets customers set up a snippet of code that runs whenever a set of conditions is met. Microsoft handles all the provisioning of compute resources necessary to run the Functions, so users don’t have to worry about running a virtual machine all the time to handle irregular events. \nMaking Azure Functions generally available is important to Microsoft’s ongoing competition with Amazon Web Services. The other Seattle-area cloud provider launched its AWS Lambda service N years ago, and it has proven a popular tool for leveraging the power of what people have begun calling “serverless” computing.

      "text": "As Google Inc. aims to catch up in cloud computing with leaders Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure, it’s doubling down on what is arguably its biggest technology advantage: the branch of artificial intelligence called machine learning. \nToday the search giant announced a series of new cloud machine learning services and features. It also revealed new hardware power available via the Google Cloud that applies graphics processing units from Nvidia Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc., chips that are responsible for powering much of the recent work in machine learning, which allows computers to learn without being explicitly programmed. \nGoogle also announced the formation of a new machine learning unit inside its cloud operation that’s intended to develop services specific to business use cases. The unit will be headed by two heavyweight machine learning researchers: Fei-Fei Li , director of Stanford University’s Artificial Intelligence Lab and the Stanford Vision Lab, and Jia Li , head of research at Snap Inc. (the former Snapchat). \nAll the announcements are aimed at large corporate enterprises that know they need the machine learning capabilities that have driven recent advances in consumer services such as language translation, speech recognition and image recognition, but want a much faster and simpler way to apply them to their businesses. To date, using machine learning has required deep expertise most companies don’t have. \nDiane Greene, Google’s senior vice president in charge of its cloud and enterprise businesses, said at the “machine learning day” in San Francisco that the company wants to democratize machine learning and AI to make it easy for any company to use it — and, not least, give enterprises more reasons to use Google’s cloud. “Any company in the world would be remiss not to have a footprint in the Google Cloud,” Greene said. \nNew cloud application programming interfaces Google’s machine learning work dates back close to a decade, but Chief Executive Sundar Pichai has made it central to nearly every product and service at the company, from search to Google Photos to targeted advertising. Today, the company focused on its creation of a series of application programming interfaces that make it easier to make use of machine learning via Google’s cloud for specific tasks such as vision, natural language interfaces and language translation. \nGoogle Engineering Fellow Fernando Pereira\nThe vision API, which Google said now runs on its own Tensor Processing Unit chips that are about three or four years ahead in performance for the price as GPUs. It also got a price cut of up to 80 percent for large deployments. \nThe natural language API, previously in a limited release, is now available for general use with new features such as more precise text sentiment analysis by sentence rather than an entire document and better recognition of company- or industry-specific words and phrases. And the language translation API now has a “premium” version that can better handle tasks such as translation of websites, video streams and articles. \nTranslation in particular is using a new “neural machine translation” model that provides a 55 percent to 85 percent reduction in error rates from the existing API. “This launch brings us closer to our vision of a universal language translator,” said Google Vice President and Engineering Fellow Fernando Pereira. \nCloud jobs API The company clearly aims to spread machine learning into customers’ operations as much as it has into its own. To that end, it provided a detailed demonstration of a cloud API for finding jobs and job candidates, a rather specific task that Google suggested was just the start of a series of still-undefined APIs for many other specific business and industry uses. \nThe Cloud jobs API is still in early alpha test mode, but it’s being used by Federal Express with its software partner Jibe as well as job boards Career Builder and Dice. Essentially, it uses machine learning to match job titles to the jobs people are looking for as well as their skills, location and seniority. “We were making it really hard for job applicants to find the job they’re looking for,” said Judy Edge, FedEx’s corporation vice president of human relations. Using the jobs API helped FedEx process thousands more applications a day leading up to its holiday crunch time. \nGoogle provided demos of other business applications of machine learning tailored for specific businesses as well, such as an auto accident loss prediction system for AXA Insurance and an image classification system for the Japanese used-car site Aucnet. And the company unveiled a set of machine learning demonstrations called AI Experiments that were built along with scientists, musicians and others to show how machine learning can be applied by mere mortals to a wide variety of uses. There’s one on bird sounds and another (shown at top) on visualizing machine learning . \nDespite the enterprise focus, Google also highlighted some new consumer applications of machine learning, such as an app released today, PhotoScan , that enables a smartphone to copy and even clean up paper photos, and new editing features for Google Photos. \nImages from Google and (for Pereira) Robert Hof ",

      "text": "Xbox One Is Beating The PlayStation 4 In Sales; Microsoft Project Scorpio Is Expected To Outsell The PS4 Pro By Troy Woodridge   07:42 pm TAG XB1 , xbox one s , Ps4 , PlayStation 4 , Sony , Microsoft , Project Scorpio , PS4 pro The Xbox One is dusting off the PlayStation 4 in sales not only in the US, but also in the UK. Sony needs to think of a way to improve their console since the Microsoft is getting too aggressive and has eventually taking over the video game industry.(Photo : TechSmartt - YouTube) \nThe Xbox One is reportedly kicking out the PlayStation 4 when it comes to sales in the United States for several months now particularly the Xbox One S. This may seem that Sony might need to do something to improve the PlayStation 4 features and not just its physical looks. Advertisement \nIn a report held by the Mobi Picker , it is pretty obvious why the Xbox One is outselling the PlayStation 4. We are talking as a whole and not just a specific model. \nIt was said in the report that one of the reasons why the PlayStation 4 Slim is not as hot as the Xbox One, it is due to the fact that there are countless fans already have the PS4. No one wants to buy a new console that the only big difference is the physical looks. I liked a @YouTube video https://t.co/RcAYVhk1Zk Xbox One BEAT PS4 AGAIN!! - Inside Gaming Daily \n— K&S Gaming Channel (@KandSGC) November 14, 2016 \nUnlike the Microsoft's Xbox One S, it has been a massive hit since its release due to its Blu-Ray feature. Buying a separate Blue-Ray player would be more expensive than buying the Xbox One S that can play Blu-Ray that can also be used to play great video games in just one device. \nAs far as we all know, the Sony PS4 dominated the market 2 years ago, but it seems the wheel is now losing its grip. Microsoft is now taking over the highroads of the video game industry in mid-2016, and as The Sixt Axis reported, since the release of the Xbox One S, PS4 has been stepping down off the ladder. \nThe aggressiveness of the Microsoft company leads them on top of the sales profit as of today. Since the release of the Xbox One S, with the help of their massive marketing efforts, everything is obviously paying off for them. Microsoft released a massive promotional bundle for the Xbox One S with a couple of discounted price and free games, which brought them a lot of sales over the past months. \nOn the other hand, the PlayStation 4 Pro seemed to be fighting its way on top as of the today. Sony might need to extend their efforts of marketing the PS4 Pro or they might found themselves stuck behind the upcoming Microsoft Project Scorpio that is known to be much powerful with its 6 Tera Flops processing power capable of 4K gaming while retaining the Blu-Ray feature.

      "text": "Microsoft announced Visual Studio is coming to MacOS, and will be introduced later this week at the Microsoft Connect Conference in New York City. Visual Studio for Mac will be based on Xamarian Studio, which is pretty known for C# ID# for OS X. Microsoft acquired Xamarian in a deal earlier this year which is said to be worth around $500 million.\nMicrosoft has been playing with other platforms. In 2014, Microsoft launched a port of the .Net Core Framework to MacOS.\nIf anything, this proves there’s a ton of culture change happening within Microsoft. It shows the company is well aware of the fact that the old strategy is no longer able to lock its users to Windows 10.\nAccording to the release,\n\"At its heart, Visual Studio for Mac is a macOS counterpart of the Windows version of Visual Studio. If you enjoy the Visual Studio development experience, but need or want to use macOS, you should feel right at home. Its UX is inspired by Visual Studio, yet designed to look and feel like a native citizen of macOS. And like Visual Studio for Windows, it’s complemented by Visual Studio Code for times when you don’t need a full IDE, but want a lightweight yet rich standalone source editor.” \nThe news follows a previous announcement from earlier this year, which the company announced it is adding support for Linux command lined Bash to Windows for the first time. Microsoft’s Scott Hanselman said, adding Bash support was “brilliant for developers that use a diverse set of tools- so launching Visual Studio for Mac is a great move.\nThough Microsoft removed the original blog post, you can find the cached version here .\nYou’ll be able to download a preview edition of Visual Studio for Mac during Microsoft’s Connect ()Conference, which is on Nov. 16.\nRelated Articles \nMicrosoft Selfie App Arrives In Android Play Store Mark Zuckerberg Defends Facebook, Claims 99 Percent Of Posts Are 'Authentic'",

      "text": "Can you believe the Microsoft Xbox One and Sony PlayStation 4 came out three years ago? We're solidly in the middle of this console generation, and it's seeing some shifts with iterative upgrades like the Xbox One S and the PS4 Pro . We pit all four systems against each other in a variety of categories to determine which comes out on top.\nBefore we get to it, just a note that the Nintendo Wii U is slowly fading and will be replaced by the ambitious Switch next year, but it still has a compelling library and is worth your attention if any of its games appeal to you.\nPrice The PS4 was the frontrunner in this category at launch, but things have changed quite a bit over the years. Basically, the price starts at $300 for either system. The new Xbox One S is available in a smaller package and with Ultra HD Blu-ray playback for just $300, and if you want to splurge on Sony the more powerful PS4 Pro is a pricier $400.\nBoth Microsoft and Sony offer premium subscriptions to their online services. Xbox users can get Xbox Live Gold, and PlayStation users can get PS Plus. PS Plus used to be slightly less expensive, but now both services are available for $60 a year. For both systems, this premium service is required to play multiplayer games online, and now neither system requires the extra subscription to watch media services.\nWinner: Tie \n\nHardware Arguing about technical specifications seems moot. On paper, the PlayStation 4 has a slight edge thanks to using GDDR5 RAM instead of the DDR3 RAM used in the Xbox One, but besides that, the hardware is strikingly similar. Both have 8-core AMD CPUs, 8GB of memory, 500GB internal hard drives, and Blu-ray optical drives. The systems now have versions with 1TB drives as options, and the Xbox One's 1TB version uses a hybrid drive with solid state storage in addition to a hard disk to improve performance. However, in our tests, the Xbox One's hybrid drive wasn't noticeably faster than the 500GB drive.\nIt's become even more confusing in the latest update, with the PS4 Pro boasting a faster CPU and a GPU that can process over twice as many TFLOPS. It can markedly improve games that have been optimized or launch with support for the extra power, adding new effects, higher resolution (up to 4K), and smoother frame rates (up to 60fps, which makes Rise of the Tomb Raider: 20 Year Celebration look amazing). The number of games that take advantage of that power is limited, though it will likely grow.\nThe Xbox One S doesn't claim any significant graphical upgrades for its games, so Sony comes out ahead for users willing to pay the extra $100 and who play compatible games. That could change next year, when Microsoft will reveal exactly what its Scorpio project is, and just how much more powerful it is than the Xbox One. And don't forget, the Xbox One S gets you support for Ultra HD Blu-ray, while the PS4 Pro does not.\nWinner: PlayStation 4 Pro \n\nControls You need a good gamepad to play games, and both the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 have them. The Xbox One gamepad is a slightly updated version of the Xbox 360 controller, with a more rounded feel and trigger buttons that offer individual force feedback. The DualShock 4, the PS4's gamepad, is a completely overhauled controller that keeps the best parts of the DualShock 3 and fixes the worst. The analog sticks feel better, the triggers are more responsive, and the controller just feels nicer in the hand. It even features a built-in speaker and a potentially useful but so far underutilized touchpad in the middle. The only problem with the DualShock 4 is the light bar that marks which controllers are on and assigned to which players. Fortunately, Sony has since updated the PS4 to let you dim the light bar significantly, which cuts down on glare.\nThe Xbox One gamepad is great, but the new Xbox Elite Wireless Controller beats even the DualShock 4 with bulletproof build quality and extensive customization options. Of course, that gamepad is a $150 optional accessory (or $100 if you buy it as part of the Xbox One Elite bundle).\nNeither pack-in controller should be considered a deal breaker because they both play very well, but the DualShock 4 is simply the most comfortable default gamepad we've tested yet.\nWinner: PlayStation 4 \n\nGames The biggest games from third-party publishers like EA and Activision are almost all cross-platform, so it comes down to which exclusives appeal to you more. Games made by Sony will probably only come out on the PS4. Games made by Microsoft will probably only come out on the Xbox One. Of course, Windows 10 availability for nearly all of Microsoft's major releases means that you can play most of the big Xbox One exclusives on your PC if you want, while PS4 exclusives remain solidly PS4-only. It gives Sony an edge, but it doesn't represent an advantage for consumers; exclusivity only limits, and doesn't improve the experience for anyone besides the publisher and manufacturer.\nFor more, see the Best Xbox One Games and the Best PlayStation 4 Games .\nWinner: PlayStation 4 \n\nOnline Services Whether you want to play games online or watch Netflix, you need to connect your game system to the Internet. The Xbox One uses Xbox Live, and the PlayStation 4 uses the PlayStation Network to access online services. In both cases, you need to purchase the premium subscription plan (Xbox Live Gold for Xbox Live, PS Plus for PlayStation Network) to play games online. Xbox Live used to require an Xbox Live Gold subscription for media services, but Microsoft has since dropped that requirement and you can now watch Netflix and other streaming media apps without Gold, including television with OneGuide. You can also use any app on the PlayStation 4 without a PS Plus membership, and with the PS4 requiring a premium service for online multiplayer just like the Xbox One, this category comes out to a tie.\nWinner: Tie \n\n\nMedia Features Both the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 can play Blu-ray movies and access a variety of online services like Netflix and Hulu Plus. The Xbox One goes two extra steps with television integration and Ultra HD Blu-ray playback. An HDMI pass-through lets you run your cable or satellite box through the system, though without a Kinect you'll need a third-party infrared blaster to control it. This incorporates live television through your cable or satellite provider into the Xbox One's menu system. You can also add over-the-air television with a third-party USB tuner. The OneGuide program guide displays both live television and what content is available on services like Hulu Plus and Machinima, giving you total control over what you watch, and you can even enjoy a split screen view of what's on television while you play your favorite game or browse the Web, thanks to the Xbox One's Snap feature. If that isn't enough, the Xbox One S can play Ultra HD Blu-ray discs, which means you can watch 4K HDR movies on physical media. Bizarrely, Sony didn't add this feature to the PS4 Pro.\nWinner: Xbox One S \n\nGame Capture The massive popularity of Let's Plays on YouTube and game streaming on Twitch has brought capturing game footage to the mainstream, so both the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 feature built-in capture options. The Kinect let you record clips just by saying \"Xbox, record that,\" and thanks to the latest update you can easily capture what you're playing just by double-tapping the Xbox button on your gamepad and pressing X or Y to save a screenshot or video clip. You can also snap the Game DVR app to the side of the screen to record up to five minutes of footage on demand.\nThe PlayStation 4 goes a step further, however, with a dedicated Share button right on the DualShock 4 controller. At any point you can tap it to save the last 15 minutes of gameplay, grab a screenshot of what you're playing, or start streaming live to PSN or Twitch. The longer capture length and more convenient setup makes the PS4 the better system for recording or streaming your games.\nWinner: PlayStation 4 \n\nVirtual Reality Hey, it's a new category! Sony recently launched the Playstation VR , a virtual reality headset designed for both the PlayStation 4 and PS4 Pro. We really like it, since it's the least expensive and most comfortable of the big-name tethered VR headsets. The selection of games is also pretty strong for new technology; Rez Infinite is a must-play, revelatory experience in VR (which is amazing when you consider it's an updated version of a 15-year-old game). Rigs: Mechanized Combat League and Battlezone are both very fun, fully developed VR titles where you control big mechanical weapons. And for a standalone expansion that heavily reuses assets, Until Dawn: Rush of Blood is a surprisingly fun and visually stunning horror rail shooter.\nMicrosoft has announced partnerships with several electronics manufacturers to make V R headsets for Windows 10 , but it's been silent about VR on the Xbox One. That might change with Scorpio, but for now there are no VR options for the Xbox One.\nWinner: PlayStation 4 \nCamera When both consoles first launched, cameras were held up as a major feature, either as a required, included accessory (the Kinect with the Xbox One) or an option (the PlayStation Camera with the PlayStation 4). That didn't pan out, and both Microsoft and Sony have backed off from the idea of using a camera with their systems for gesture and voice control, and integration with certain games. Both the Kinect and PlayStation Camera are nearly forgotten, at least for their original purposes. The PlayStation Camera is necessary if you want to use PlayStation VR, but as a general camera accessory it's as useless as Kinect.\nCategory Retired \n\nTotals By the numbers, the Sony PlayStation 4 is our winner. It has a total advantage in virtual reality, and the PS4 Pro means it is a more powerful platform until Microsoft's Scorpio comes out. The Xbox One is still the better system for media features, however, especially with Ultra HD Blu-ray playback on the Xbox One S.\nUltimately, the deciding factors is games. No matter which system is technically the best, make sure it has games you want to play.",

Alongside it was the announcement of the Xbox One S and faint news of a new Sony console that has since launched. Since then, Project Scorpio has remained an enigma, a piece of console tech that seems to promise the world, but something that very little is known about, apart from a few specs.\nImage Source: Microsoft.com Xbox Project Scorpio and 4K Now that the PS4 Pro is out and some of its users are struggling to get the non-native 4K tech to work, Microsoft has been vindicated in its decision to hold back Xbox Project Scorpio until the holiday season of 2017. Right now the key issue being seen by PlayStation 4 Pro owners is compatibility for both TVs and games. The problems center around 4K compatibility; find out more here .\nRegarding Xbox Project Scorpio and 4K, at a recent Xbox Fanfest in Mexico City, Xbox Executive Aaron Greenberg decided to talk about Scorpio and what it promised. Talking about the 4K capabilities of the Xbox’s next console, Greenberg says it will deliver “True 4K gaming” in a manner that has never been seen before on a console. It will have the ability to render games; that will put all other consoles to shame.\nHe also said the following:\n“This will really bring the most powerful console you’ve ever seen. It will bring these really true 4K, really incredible visual games that we’ve never seen before on the console.\n“People who have spent thousands of dollars on a high-end PC are getting that experience. How do we bring that to scale in a console in your living room? That’s a big part of what Project Scorpio is about.”\nScorpio specs: what do we know? Much like Nintendo with its Switch console , Microsoft is keeping its cards close to its chest. Having said that, there is a consensus that the device will come with 6 Teraflops of computing power. Compare that to the PS4 Pro at 4 Teraflops, and you have around a 40% increase in power.\nAs for its CPU, so far the rumor is that Xbox Project Scorpio will feature an octa-core chip, but this has not been officially revealed so expect this to change. There could be 230GB of storage installed, which would enable the console to do what Greenberg promised, meaning that Xbox Project Scorpio will be able to run native 4K games without any visual compromises at all.\nMore revelations Just a few weeks ago, lead Xbox engineer Mike Ybarra took to Twitter to talk about Xbox Project Scorpio. He revealed that Project Scorpio would support Xbox 360 titles, making it backwards compatible. This directly mirrors what is currently available on the Xbox One, which allows users to play 360 games whenever they like.\nWhat do you think of Xbox Executive Aaron Greenberg’s 4K statement? Could it be too late for Scorpio by this time next year? Some critics point towards the 360/PS3 era and the fact that the more powerful PS3 had to cope with substandard ports. Will Xbox Project Scorpio be the victim of low-quality 4K ports? Whatever happens, it will be interesting to see what a first-party Scorpio exclusive game looks like.\nThe post Xbox Project Scorpio Will Be The Only True 4K Gaming Console appeared first on ValueWalk .\n",

Credit: Nvidia Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry IDG News Service | Nov 15, 2016 4:27 AM PT RELATED TOPICS Comments \nMicrosoft's CNTK (Cognitive Toolkit) is one among many platforms that trains computers to learn, and it's getting an upgrade. \nCNTK drives the Microsoft services Cortana and Skype language translation, and it boasts more than 90 percent accuracy in speech recognition tasks. Microsoft will soon release an upgraded CNTK toolkit, and one hardware maker wants to ensure the toolkit works best on its hardware. \nNvidia is partnering with Microsoft to optimize its GPU development tools for CNTK. The companies have created a set of deep-learning algorithms and libraries that will speed up CNTK to perform AI tasks like image and speech recognition on GPUs. \nDeep-learning tools like CNTK are sandboxes in which developers can create a model for computers to solve a particular problem. The ultimate objective is to build a well-trained model that can accurately perform a specific task, such as shuffling through loads of medical data to diagnose a disease. \nBased on input, researchers are continuously modifying models and tweaking parameters. One such tweak optimizes neural networking connections for better A.I. capabilities and for scaling the training model over more GPUs and servers. \nThe training of computer models can run for days and require intense computing horsepower. GPUs power deep learning for companies like Google and Facebook, and Microsoft is allowing some customers to test GPUs as part of its Azure cloud service. The updated CNTK tools will run faster on Microsoft's Azure N Series cloud offerings, which run on GPUs based on Nvidia's older Kepler and Maxwell architectures. \nThe updated CNTK tools could be bought on-premises with Nvidia's DGX supercomputer, which costs $129,000 and has eight Tesla P100 GPUs based on the latest Pascal architecture. \nNvidia has been working closely to optimize its GPU deep-learning libraries for the upcoming CNTK release, said Ian Buck, vice president for accelerated computing at Nvidia. \nGPUs from Nvidia already work on CNTK with existing libraries, but the new framework will provide a big performance upgrade. There is a 7.4 fold improvement in deep-learning training times across eight GPUs in a system, Buck said. \nBuck declined to comment about when the new tools would be released. \nNvidia has made improvements in tools like CUDNN, which provides the libraries and algorithms for GPU-based deep-learning. CUDNN is a core underlying technology of CUDA, which is Nvidia's parallel programming framework. \nThere are other deep-learning frameworks like Google's Tensor, Theano, and the open-source Caffe, which excels at image recognition. Companies like Intel and IBM have forked those frameworks to work best with their hardware. Nvidia's GPUs already support most of the deep-learning frameworks, but CNTK now has an edge. \nGoogle has come out with its own inferencing chip called Tensor Processing Unit, designed to improve deep learning results. Google can afford to build its own hardware because it deploys deep learning across on a larger scale, but it could be expensive for smaller companies to deploy deep-learning systems; instead they can turn to cloud services.

      "text": "Microsoft has said it will continue to develop its Windows Azure Pack product until 2022, while pledging to support it until 2027.\nAzure Pack is Microsoft’s first so-called “Azure-in-a-box” product that offers companies a “cloud-like” experience installed on-premises. The pack, which provides a first-generation Azure GUI, with Windows Server and System Center under the hood, can be installed on just about any x86 server and storage system one wishes.\nThe Azure Pack is not to be confused with the better known Azure Stack , which is still under development. Available in beta, Azure Stack will only work on specific, Microsoft-approved hardware available from Dell Technologies Inc., Hewlett-Packard Enterprise Co., and Lenovo Group Ltd. The stack will provide a much more realistic Azure experience on-premises, and is designed for companies that wish to follow a hybrid cloud and hyperconverged systems strategy.\nAs for the updated Azure Pack, Microsoft says this can now run the latest Windows Server 2016 edition. The company also promised that Azure Pack will “continue to evolve until 2022 and will be supported until 2027”. Microsoft refused to be drawn on what the future evolution of Azure Pack may look like, but said it would be a good fit for service providers that want to offer infrastructure-as-a-service.\nOne thing we could see though is more integration between Azure Pack and Azure Stack, as Microsoft notes in its blog post that while Azure Pack is a good choice for customers who wish to run virtual machines in their on-premises data centers, “later they will be able to choose among many Azure Stack offerings if they need Azure capabilities from the local service provider.”\nMicrosoft also offers a third cloud-like experience with its Cloud Platform System , though the company has recently hinted that this will soon be integrated with Azure Pack and Azure Stack.\nPhoto Credit: TechStage Flickr via Compfight cc ",

      "title": "5 Essential Tips and Tricks for Google Docs You Need to Know About",
      "text": "Tweet \nThere’s a good chance you no longer use Microsoft Word. In 2016 you’re more likely kicking back in an independent cafe, working from the cloud and collaboratively editing documents with your co-workers. And you probably use Google Docs to do it. \nBut are you making the most of Docs, and do you really know what it’s truly capable of? If you’re not sure, then here are five tips and tricks that will make your word-based work in the cloud easier. 1. Edit Word Documents Without Converting to Docs \nGoogle Docs is good at handling Word (.doc and .docx) documents, converting them nicely to “.gdoc” format and letting you continue to work on them. \nBut there are plenty of times when it’s more convenient to keep a Word document in its original format, such as if you need to send a document back to someone who only uses Word. To do this, download the extension Office Editing for Docs, Sheets & Slides , which lets you work on “.doc” documents as if they were Google Docs. \nJust install the extension, open a Word document in Google Docs, and work on it as you normally would. It will automatically save in its original Word format. 2. Work on Your Documents Offline \nIt’s no longer a secret that Google Docs allows you to work offline as effectively as online, but it’s easy to get confused about how exactly to do it. \nTo do it, you actually need to go to drive.google.com rather than docs.google.com . Once you’re there, click the cog icon at the top right, choose Settings, then tick the “Sync Google Docs” box in the “Offline” section. \nThat’s it! Remember that you can’t pick out individual documents for offline editing, so make sure you have the hard drive space to accommodate all your documents when you sync for offline use. 3. Find and Insert Images You’re Allowed to Use \nWhen you work in online publishing, you come to appreciate the importance of using images that you’re legally allowed to , or there could be trouble down the road when the owner of the image comes knocking at your door with a squad of lawyers! \nGoogle Docs has a great solution for this using its handy “Explore” feature. Simply highlight the word or phrase in your document that you want to find an image for, then click “Tools -> Explore.” \nThis will open a pane to the right of your document bringing up a whole bunch of information from the Web relating to your highlighted text. One of these sections will show images from Google Images, all of which have been labelled for reuse, making it no issue for you to use them. Click “More” next to “Images” to see more, then just click an image to insert it into your document. 4. Suggest Edits \nIf you’re collaborating on a document, or even if you’re working solo and just want to see if some text works better in your document than what was there before, it’s extremely useful to be able to make a note of suggested edits, which the author can then accept or reject as they please. \nDoing this is easy. In Google Docs just click the pencil icon at the top-right (with the word “Editing” next to it), then click “Suggesting.” Any edit you make in this mode will be shown as a comment to the right of the document. Other people (or you) can then reply to the suggestion, leave feedback on it, or use the tick or cross icons to accept or reject the suggestion. 5. Add Special Symbols Into Your Documents \nSpecial symbols are the bane of anyone trying to write them, and are always a guaranteed pain to try and insert. But there are a couple of ways you can do it in Docs. \nOne thing you can do is go to “Insert -> Special characters” where you can search for the symbol you want either by typing in what it’s called or drawing it in the box on the right. \nAlternatively, go to “Tools -> Preferences,” and you can write in keyboard shortcuts that convert to symbols, so by default (c) converts to ©, (r) converts to ® and so on. You can insert any symbol you like into the “With” box, then type your preferred shortcut for it into the “Replace” box. Conclusion \nGoogle Docs will still feel like new territory for a lot of people, and there’s no denying that Microsoft Word has a bigger toolset for your word processing needs. But Docs is constantly growing and improving, and these tips prove that it can do some things that even the great Word can’t! Is this article useful?

      "text": "Today marks the fifteenth anniversary of both Halo: Combat Evolved and Microsoft’s Xbox console. Halo has had a massive impact on console first person shooters, game storytelling, multiplayer, and sales of the Xbox, but today we’re looking at another aspect of Halo’s influence. We’ve rounded up a small selection of the amazing builds the adventures of Master Chief has inspired LEGO fans to create. Pause your sixteen player LAN game on Blood Gulch and explore some of the best of LEGO Halo.\n“That… is another Halo.” \nFirst up is Catsy [CC] with his microscale model of the ringworld itself, spanning nearly 5 feet across.\n\n\n“Don’t make a girl a promise if you know you can’t keep it.” \nSean and Steph Mayo’s mosaic of the AI Cortana is not just beautiful; it’s fully motorized for a holographic effect, and one of the most interesting builds I’ve seen in person.\n\nKilltacular! Killtrocity! Killimanjaro! \nHalo is known for its multiplayer as much as its story, and these Spartan-IIIs by Mike Nieves look ready to prolong the endless struggle of red versus blue.\n\n“You know how expensive this gear is, son?” \nIf large scale Spartan figures just aren’t massive enough, try a wearable Master Chief armor set constructed and worn by Ben Caulkins .\n\nFeet first into Hell \nOver the years, minifigure scale Halo builds have been dominated by iteration after iteration of vehicles like the Warthog, but sometimes there are great dioramas like Halo 3: ODST’s Uplift Nature Reserve by Sean Cassidy .\n\n“She was supposed to be massive, but the project was only in prototype when we left.” \nCody Fowler created a great microscale model of the flagship for Halo 4 & 5, UNSC Infinity , as it appears during its commissioning.\n\nThe outcome justifies the deed. \nFrom Halo Wars, the first Halo title to be a real-time strategy game instead of first person shooter, is the UNSC Spirit of Fire constructed at a massive 8 feet long over 4 years by Mark Kelso .\n\n“Could we possibly make any more noise?! …I guess so.” \nOver the years, I have built many gaming weapons in 1:1 scale, and if I had to narrow down my favorite Halo builds of mine, I would pick Nornfang, Spartan Linda’s sniper rifle from Halo 5, and the classic MA5 series assault rifle.\n\n\nLEGO Halo is not finished. I think we’re just getting started.\n",

      "text": " Equal Access International\nAward celebrates the \"Best of the Best\" Tech Award Laureates Using Technology to Benefit Humanity\nSAN FRANCISCO Equal Access International, an innovative non-profit creating positive social change for millions of underserved people across the developing world, today announced it is the recipient of the 2016 Tech Award in the Microsoft Education Category. The award recognizes Equal Access for its dramatic expansion and significant global impact since first being named a laureate in 2003. Equal Access will receive a $50,000 cash award at the Tech Awards Gala on November 17 to further its programs which reach more than 137 million people in 21 languages in nine countries across Asia and Africa .\nSince its inception in 2000, The Tech Awards, sponsored by Applied Materials, Inc., are considered the \"Oscars\" of Silicon Valley. To mark the award's fifteenth anniversary, former laureates were invited to compete again in their respective categories with the judging committee selecting the \"best of the best\" Tech Award laureates who continue to address the world's most challenging problems.\n\"This award means so much to our worldwide staff across Afghanistan , Burkina Faso , Cambodia , Cameroon , Chad , Nepal , Niger , Nigeria , and Pakistan , who leverage the power and reach of interactive media, innovative technology and community action to inspire the voices, stories, and movements driving positive change when our world needs it most,\" said Ronni Goldfarb , Equal Access President and CEO. \"We are thrilled to be recognized for our work.\"\nDan'l Lewin, Corporate Vice President of Technology and Civic Engagement at Microsoft Corp, said, \"It is an honor to further recognize Equal Access International for its life-changing work, which has successfully scaled beyond the initial 2003 program launch in Nepal . It has provided the ideal mix of innovative communications technology and direct community engagement to produce lasting education and social change that is beyond impressive.\"\nEqual Access Programs and Impact Areas\nEqual Access previously won the 2003 Tech Award in Education for providing life-changing education on women's and girls' empowerment and HIV/AIDS prevention to 10,400 Nepalese living in remote and marginalized regions of the country. Overcoming barriers of illiteracy and poor infrastructure, Equal Access launched a pioneering educational satellite radio platform/distribution system providing original, locally-produced programming to low-cost receivers in remote villages for the very first time. Today, Equal Access has replicated this model, expanding impact across nine countries in Asia and Africa where they implement large-scale country programs in six inter-related areas ranging from Youth Life Skills, to Women's and Girls' Empowerment to Peacebuilding and Civic Engagement.\nLast year, more than 67 million people listened, viewed, participated and benefitted from Equal Access programming. And more than 102,000 people participated in community engagement activities.\nOver the years, Equal Access has continued to develop new, innovative platforms to reach beneficiaries in ways they prefer, including mobile and online platforms and TV programs delivered via satellite, YouTube and mobile apps. Additionally, Equal Access provides annual organization metrics that demonstrate continued global impact, found at http://www.equalaccess.org .\nAbout Equal Access International\nFounded in 2000, Equal Access (EA) is an international non-profit organization dedicated to creating positive social change for millions of underserved people across the developing world by providing critically needed information and education.

      "text": "Leading Genome Research Center Catalyzes Technology Partnership Between DNAnexus and Microsoft to Support Data Management and Genomic Analysis [November 15, 2016] Leading Genome Research Center Catalyzes Technology Partnership Between DNAnexus and Microsoft to Support Data Management and Genomic Analysis Tweet \nDNAnexus Inc. , the global leader in genome informatics and data management, today announced that the Stanford Center for Genomics and Personalized Medicine ( SCGPM ) has adopted the DNAnexus Platform on the Microsoft ( News - Alert ) Azure cloud in order to bring enterprise-ready genomic analysis, data management, and collaborative research solutions to the center. The SCGPM, which supports researchers across nearly 80 laboratories, brought the two technologies together after working with both DNAnexus ( News - Alert ) and Microsoft independently. \nSCGPM seeks to advance genomic technology so that genetic and molecular profiling will become powerful tools routinely used to understand, detect, prevent, and treat complex diseases. To advance this goal, SCGPM had deployed both the DNAnexus Platform and the Azure cloud for different aspects of the core sequencing facility's massive genomic processing and data management requirements. With this partnershi, a distributed network of scientists and researchers now have secure and compliant access to petabytes worth of data through a simple web browser through DNAnexus on Azure. Each month SCGPM generates on average 7.7 trillion base-pairs of data, which if all this data came from a single DNA strand, it would stretch across the Golden Gate Bridge. \n\"By working closely with Microsoft though our relationship with Stanford and extending the DNAnexus Platform to Azure, we now offer our customers a tailored solution for incorporating Azure into state-of-the-art infrastructure for biomedical innovation,\" said Richard Daly, CEO of DNAnexus. \n\"Microsoft is committed to advancing the field of genomics,\" according to David Heckerman, distinguished scientist and director of Microsoft Genomics. \"We look forward to working together with DNAnexus to further accelerate global scientific discoveries.\" \nAbout DNAnexus \nDNAnexus combines expertise in computing and bioinformatics to create the global network for genomics. The company operates in 31 countries, and spans a wide spectrum of industries - pharmaceutical and biotech, healthcare, clinical diagnostics, government, and research consortia - facilitating some of the most challenging and exciting opportunities in human health. The secure, scalable, and collaborative DNAnexus Platform combines out-of-the-box clinical compliance for the healthcare industry, streamlining communication between healthcare providers and reducing information silos for more efficient collaboration.

VCG/Getty Images Advertisement \n(Bloomberg) -- Microsoft Corp. struck a partnership with Elon Musk's artificial intelligence research group, OpenAI, and said the organization will use the company's Azure cloud system for most of its large-scale experiments. \nOpenAI has been an early customer for Microsoft's Azure N-Series Virtual Machines , a powerful cloud-computing service that relies on Nvidia Corp. graphical processing units. The two will also collaborate on ways to advance AI research and its use, Microsoft and Open AI said Tuesday in blog posts. \n\"In the coming months we will use thousands to tens of thousands of these machines to increase both the number of experiments we run and the size of the models we train,\" OpenAI said in its post. \nMicrosoft is investing in artificial intelligence research and product development in a variety of areas including medicine and bots, programs that chat with users to automate tasks. Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella has discussed the need for ethical rules as AI develops as well as creating ways to spread its benefits. \nMusk, who heads Tesla Motors Inc. and Space Exploration Technologies , teamed up with Y Combinator President Sam Altman and others, to form the nonprofit OpenAI in December, seeking to ensure AI is developed safety and its benefits are widely distributed. \nMicrosoft also said it's introducing the Azure Bot Service , a cloud service that lets companies and developers store and run bots in the Azure cloud.",

      "text": "Microsoft will announce Visual Studio for Mac at its Connect event 15 News Bringing its development environment to Apple computers highlights Microsoft's shifting focus to cloud-based software. \nIn a blog post, Microsoft announced that it will release its Visual Studio integrated development environment (IDE) on Mac computers. \nThe blog appears to have been published early: it's been removed, but a cached version is still available for viewing. \nMicrosoft will launch a preview build of Visual Studio for Mac at its Connect event later this week. Visual Studio on macOS will resemble its Windows counterpart on the surface. Its underpinnings are more complex, and suited to Apple's native operating system. \"Its IntelliSense and refactoring use the Roslyn Compiler Platform; its project system and build engine use MSBuild; and its source editor supports TextMate bundles. It uses the same debugger engines for Xamarin and .NET Core apps, and the same designers for Xamarin.iOS and Xamarin.Android.\" \nAs Visual Studio for Mac is a new product, it will take some time for Microsoft to add support for all Visual Studio project types. Mac developers can rest assured that compatibility is one of the company's key areas of concentration. \nPositioning Visual Studio as a cross-platform IDE falls in line with Microsoft's focus to cloud-based computing. It's becoming increasingly common for programming tasks to be carried out on cloud services rather than local services; adding cross-platform support for Visual Studio will allow developers to work on projects on their OS of choice, rather than having to run Windows.",

This will make Azure the primary cloud platform that OpenAI is using for deep learning and AI, and will let it conduct more research and share the results with the world. \nOpenAI said, \"We'll share the results of this partnership with everyone: along with publishing our research results, we'll continue releasing open-source software making it easier for people to run large-scale AI workloads on the cloud.

      "text": "Source: Microsoft | YouTube Satya Nadella and Jeff Weiner on Microsoft acquiring LinkedIn, June 13, 2016. Microsoft beat Salesforce to acquire LinkedIn because it offered all cash and less risk , said LinkedIn CEO Jeff Weiner. \nSalesforce CEO Marc Benioff was a class act throughout the negotiations, but at the end of the day it came down to dollars and cents, said Weiner. \n\"Microsoft's offer was of greater value — an all cash offer versus stock and cash —where Salesforce would have potentially been diluted in a way where the stock that they offered to lose value, at least in the near term,\" said Weiner.\n\nWeiner's comments came at the Code Enterprise conference in San Francisco Tuesday night.\n\nMicrosoft will integrate LinkedIn's social network into its suite of products such as Office, Windows, Outlook and Azure to reach over a billion customers, said Weiner. \nWith Linkedin, Microsoft will have a better understanding of who its users are and can create more value out of existing products, he said.\n\n\nBenioff has called on European regulators to investigate the deal on anti-trust concerns.\n\nEven after the Microsoft takeover is complete, which is expected to happen by the end of the year, LinkedIn will continue to partner with companies such as SAP , IBM and Salesforce and determine how its data are used, said Weiner. \nSalesforce has significant market share when it comes to customer relationship management software and ultimately, more competition is good for customers, said Weiner.",

      "text": "Leading Genome Research Center Catalyzes Technology Partnership Between DNAnexus And Microsoft To Support Data Management And Genomic Analysis View More Jobs \nMOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.--( BUSINESS WIRE )-- DNAnexus Inc. , the global leader in genome informatics and data management, today announced that the Stanford Center for Genomics and Personalized Medicine ( SCGPM ) has adopted the DNAnexus Platform on the Microsoft Azure cloud in order to bring enterprise-ready genomic analysis, data management, and collaborative research solutions to the center. The SCGPM, which supports researchers across nearly 80 laboratories, brought the two technologies together after working with both DNAnexus and Microsoft independently. \n“By working closely with Microsoft though our relationship with Stanford and extending the DNAnexus Platform to Azure, we now offer our customers a tailored solution for incorporating Azure into state-of-the-art infrastructure for biomedical innovation” \nSCGPM seeks to advance genomic technology so that genetic and molecular profiling will become powerful tools routinely used to understand, detect, prevent, and treat complex diseases. To advance this goal, SCGPM had deployed both the DNAnexus Platform and the Azure cloud for different aspects of the core sequencing facility’s massive genomic processing and data management requirements. With this partnership, a distributed network of scientists and researchers now have secure and compliant access to petabytes worth of data through a simple web browser through DNAnexus on Azure. Each month SCGPM generates on average 7.7 trillion base-pairs of data, which if all this data came from a single DNA strand, it would stretch across the Golden Gate Bridge. \n\"By working closely with Microsoft though our relationship with Stanford and extending the DNAnexus Platform to Azure, we now offer our customers a tailored solution for incorporating Azure into state-of-the-art infrastructure for biomedical innovation,” said Richard Daly, CEO of DNAnexus. \n\"Microsoft is committed to advancing the field of genomics,\" according to David Heckerman, distinguished scientist and director of Microsoft Genomics. \"We look forward to working together with DNAnexus to further accelerate global scientific discoveries.” \nAbout DNAnexus \nDNAnexus combines expertise in computing and bioinformatics to create the global network for genomics.

      "text": "Home » News » World News » Microsoft teams up with Musk's $1 bn OpenAI project Microsoft teams up with Musk's $1 bn OpenAI project 12   San Francisco, Nov 16 : In a move to \"democratise\" artificial intelligence (AI) and making it accessible to everyone, Microsoft has teamed up with OpenAI, a non-profit AI research organisation co-founded by Elon Musk. OpenAI is the $1 billion project co-founded by Tesla CEO Musk, US-based startup incubator \"Y Combinator\" President Sam Altman and others. As part of the partnership, OpenAI will use Microsoft Azure as its primary cloud platform to help advance their research and create new tools and technologies that are only possible with the cloud. \"OpenAI chose Microsoft due to our deep learning research and ongoing commitment to AI, along with Azure's support for open source technologies and its unique combination of high performance computing, big data and intelligence capabilities,\" Harry Shum, Executive Vice President, Microsoft Artificial Intelligence and Research Group, posted on its website on Wednesday. OpenAI is an early adopter of \"Azure N-Series Virtual Machines\", which will be generally available starting in December. These virtual machines are designed for the most intensive compute workloads, including deep learning, simulations, rendering and the training of neural networks. They also enable high-end visualisation capabilities to allow for workstation and streaming scenarios by utilising the \"NVIDIA GRID\" in Azure. \"In addition to OpenAI, other companies like Esri and Jellyfish Pictures are already using Azure N-Series,\" Shum said. Microsoft also announced to introduce the Azure Bot Service, a first of its kind in the industry. With this new service, developers can accelerate the development of bots with the Microsoft Bot Framework and easily deploy and manage them in a serverless environment on Azure. \"Running on Azure Functions, these bots can scale on demand and you only pay for the resources your bots consume. \"Azure Functions, which is available today, can be used to maximise development agility and operational efficiency of nearly any app or service at lower cost,\" Shum further posted. More than 50,000 developers are already building bots with the Microsoft Bot Framework. Thanks to cloud computing power, more advanced algorithms and the availability of massive amounts of data, the AI field has exploded -- allowing computer scientists to create technology many of us only dreamed about just a few years ago. na/in",

      "text": " 19pm   Latest Science   \nIn a move to \"democratise\" artificial intelligence (AI) and making it accessible to everyone, Microsoft has teamed up with OpenAI, a non-profit AI research organisation co-founded by Elon Musk. Don't Miss: Sam's Club Black Friday 2016 Deals \nOpenAI is the $1 billion project co-founded by Tesla CEO Musk, US-based startup incubator \"Y Combinator\" President Sam Altman and others. \nAs part of the partnership, OpenAI will use Microsoft Azure as its primary cloud platform to help advance their research and create new tools and technologies that are only possible with the cloud. \n\"OpenAI chose Microsoft due to our deep learning research and ongoing commitment to AI, along with Azure's support for open source technologies and its unique combination of high performance computing, big data and intelligence capabilities,\" Harry Shum, Executive Vice President, Microsoft Artificial Intelligence and Research Group, posted on its website on Wednesday. \nOpenAI is an early adopter of \"Azure N-Series Virtual Machines\", which will be generally available starting in December. \nThese virtual machines are designed for the most intensive compute workloads, including deep learning, simulations, rendering and the training of neural networks. \nThey also enable high-end visualisation capabilities to allow for workstation and streaming scenarios by utilising the \"NVIDIA GRID\" in Azure. \n\"In addition to OpenAI, other companies like Esri and Jellyfish Pictures are already using Azure N-Series,\" Shum said. \nMicrosoft also announced to introduce the Azure Bot Service, a first of its kind in the industry. \nWith this new service, developers can accelerate the development of bots with the Microsoft Bot Framework and easily deploy and manage them in a serverless environment on Azure. \n\"Running on Azure Functions, these bots can scale on demand and you only pay for the resources your bots consume. \n\"Azure Functions, which is available today, can be used to maximise development agility and operational efficiency of nearly any app or service at lower cost,\" Shum further posted. \nMore than 50,000 developers are already building bots with the Microsoft Bot Framework. \nThanks to cloud computing power, more advanced algorithms and the availability of massive amounts of data, the AI field has exploded -- allowing computer scientists to create technology many of us only dreamed about just a few years ago.

      "text": "* Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet boost S&P, Nasdaq\n* Home Depot falls after no change to full-year forecast\n* October U.S. retail sales rise more than expected\n* Oil prices jump as much as 6.4 pct\n* Dow up 0.29 pct, S&P up 0.75 pct, Nasdaq up 1.1 pct\n(Updates to late afternoon, adds comment, changes byline)\nNov 15 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose on Tuesday, with the Dow registering its fourth consecutive record high close as tech stocks rebounded from a post-election battering and energy stocks were boosted by a sharp rise in oil prices.\nThe Dow Jones industrial average extended its rally to seven days after it turned positive in late trading, while oil futures continued their rise and investors kept piling into technology stocks.\n\"Buyers who were waiting to buy technology stocks didn't have an option but to get involved and continue buying the strength. That's propelled them higher as the day went on,\" said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles.\nThe technology sector was the S&P's biggest gainer, closing up 1.3 percent in a partial rebound from its 3 percent decline since Donald Trump's shock victory on Nov. 8. Investors set aside worries that the sector could be hurt by Trump's immigration and foreign trade policies.\nThe S&P's energy index was the next biggest driver, with a 2.7 percent rise, as U.S. crude oil jumped more than 6 percent from multi-month lows on expectations that OPEC will agree later this month to cut production..\nThe Dow Jones industrial average rose 54.37 points, or 0.29 percent, to 18,923.06, the S&P 500 gained 16.19 points, or 0.75 percent, to 2,180.39 and the Nasdaq Composite added 57.23 points, or 1.1 percent, to 5,275.62.\nTech giants Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet provided the biggest boost to the Nasdaq, and along with Apple Inc, were the top drivers for the S&P 500.\nOil giant Exxon Mobil rose 1.8 percent, also contributing to the S&P's rise.\nEquity investors have been betting that Donald Trump will live up to his campaign promises to boost government spending, along with lower taxes and lighter regulation.\n\"People view all of this as positive for the economy and positive for the market. That continues to wash through the market. The buying isn't as virulent as it was, but we're still doing well,\" said Stephen Massocca, chief investment officer at Wedbush Equity Management LLC in San Francisco.\nHigh-dividend-paying sectors such as utilities and telecommunications also rose following a steep sell-off in the past few days.\nU.S. retail sales rose more than expected in October as households bought motor vehicles and a range of other goods. The Commerce Department said on Tuesday that retail sales increased 0.8 percent last month, above the 0.6 percent increase forecast by economists.\nHome Depot fell 2.6 percent to $124.40 after the No. 1 U.S. home improvement chain reported strong third-quarter results but kept its full-year sales forecast, implying a weaker-than-expected fourth quarter.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.65-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.45-to-1 ratio favored advancers.\nThe S&P 500 posted 37 new 52-week highs and 3 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 173 new highs and 32 new lows.\nAbout 8.4 billion stocks changed hands on U.S. exchanges, lighter than Monday's volume but well above the 7.8 billion average for the last 20 sessions.\n(Additional reporting by Tanya Agrawal and Anya George Tharakan; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty and Dan Grebler)",

The template should be easy to adapt and edit as the users are not experts in Word. The design should be loosely based on the design of the following document: \n[url removed, login to view] \nHowever, it SHOULD NOT BE EXACTLY like this document. \nThe word template should be designed for a much more text intensive document (sales proposal) and should look less like a brochure and more like a professional word proposal document. It can have design elements and look good but shouldn't be too complicated to use. \nI have attached an example proposal so that you can see what the content is that we would be using with this template. Please note that the title page has already been formatted and is in line with the Millenials document. The rest needs to be made to look more professional and nicer (easy to use and nicely designed table of contents, header, footer, design elements within the document, perhaps some way of formatting the start of a new section etc.) \nOnce again, this needs to be fully adaptable and usable by users that aren't experts in word. \nPowerpoint branding template so you can use design elements from there: \n[url removed, login to view] \nExample proposal (title page already designed to be same as the Millenials document): \n[url removed, login to view] \nThis example proposal is the typical length for proposals... \nStock images to be used: \n[url removed, login to view] \nPlease let me know if you have any further questions.

      "text": "Introduction In this article, I will teach you about getting started with managing IIS using Microsoft IIS Administration REST API on Azure Virtual Machines in very simple steps.\nPrerequisites Microsoft Azure Account Azure Virtual Machine (we will be using Azure VM for this article) IIS 7.5 and above being enabled .NET Core Note: Ensure enabling IIS before installing .NET Core in order to receive ASP.NET Core Module.\nOverview The genesis of developing REST API for managing IIS was Nano Server. If you have a newly named Nano Server, then in simple terms, it's Windows Server 2016, a slimmed-down version of Windows Server. Inet-manager, religiously being used to manage IIS, for some reason doesn’t work for Nano Server. This made the IIS team need to work on a way to open up the IIS configuration system.\nMicrosoft Administration API for IIS was developed as an ASP.NET Core Application, which allows you to leverage the merits of the Web API conventions that MVC framework offers. In order to allow the user to configure IIS round the clock whenever required, it was necessary to run the Application as a Service.\nIIS team took advantage of Hostable Web Core, a technology that allows the consumer to have an in-process version of IIS to enable required API behavior. Once HWC gets loaded, the process has access to all the capabilities IIS offers. As HWC uses its own applicationHost.config file, any configuration changes made to IIS does not affect the action of the Service using HWC.\n\nTo express in simpler terms, Microsoft IIS Administration is a self-hosted Windows Service that exposes all the functionality of underlying IIS over to RESTful API.\nMicrosoft IIS Administration API recently had its first preview release. The preview can be experienced by visiting this site .\nLet’s Get Started! Open this site on your Azure Virtual Machine. An application with the screen mentioned below will be displayed.\nNow, this application is designed and developed to manage your IIS machines running Microsoft administration API. This application is accessible from anywhere through the Web Browser. If it’s mobile, tablet, or desktop, you can manage your machines right from anywhere across the globe. Doesn’t that sound fantastic!\nThe application is in preview and the IIS team has to ensure that they add more cool features with further releases.\nThe welcome screen being displayed allows you to download Microsoft IIS Administration API, which is very much-needed by the Application in order to run.\nClick Download Microsoft IIS Administration and follow the installer to get API installed \nNote: If you already have the API installed, then you can skip the download and directly move to the connection screen.\nOnce you've clicked Download , the screen will appear with the message, shown below, along with an in-progress GIF icon.\nOpen the IIS AdminsitrationSertup.exe file to download it.\n\n\n\nFollow the instruction. Click Run .\n\nCheck the I Agree checkbox once you read the terms and the condition thoroughly.\nClick  Install .\n\nThis installation will take a few minutes depending upon certain IIS features being enabled on your machine. If IIS Windows Authentication and IIS Hostable Web Core are not enabled, then the installer will enable them.\nThe window shown below will be displayed after successful installation.\n\nYou can check the service running in the services window (open using the services.msc command), as highlighted below.\n\nAfter successful installation, the application will prompt you to enter your machine credentials and it will keep prompting whenever it will try to talk with Machine IIS.\nCurrently, only administrator group members and IIS administrator groups have access to manage IIS using the administration API.\n\nAfter validating the credentials on the connection screen the screen shown below will be displayed. The connection screen is filled with some default names for the local machine. As seen, you need to generate the access token in order to get connected and talk with the API.\nClick Get Access Token . \n\nClick Create Access Key .\n\nEnter the required information, along with selecting the validity of token from the options, mentioned below.\nHere, I have selected only one day as its validity.\nClick Create it .\n\nThe token will be generated, as shown below.\n\nYou can also refresh or delete the token with the provided option as highlighted in the image below. As you can see, it will display a few details of the token being generated along with the time remaining for it to be expired.\n\nComing back to the Connection page, enter the Token generated in the Access Token field.\nYou can check an option for having a token stored locally. Go for this option only if you’re accessing it through the private device.\nOnce all the data is entered, click Connect .\n\nNow, you are connected with your machine IIS, as shown below. All of the websites configured in your machine will be displayed here.\nYou can perform all the activities related to IIS configuration, like stopping the Application, starting the Application, changing app pool, restarting app-pool and many other from this UI.\nLet’s create a Website in Azure Virtual Machine through this application.\nClick Create Web Site , as highlighted in the image below.\n\nEnter the required details as shown below:\nName : name of the website.\nPhysical path : its physical file location.\nApplication pool : bindings, if any.\nYou can also select from existing application pool or can create one. For this article, I have entered the details shown below.\n\nAlso, select DefaultPool as the application pool for the newly created website.Once done with configuring, click Create.\nNow, let’s open our Inet Manager in Azure Virtual Machine to check our newly created website. As seen, it’s created, but not yet started.\n\nComing back to manage the application, the newly created website is now listed. Notice that the status here is stopped, as seen in Inet manager window. Click the highlighted icon for the website, as shown in the image, shown below to start the website.\n\nAgain, verify it in the Azure Virtual Machine Inet Manager Window.\nCool! The website now starts.\n\nSimilarly, you can experience all IIS features like:\nChanging and creating applications pool Authentication Authorization Default document Directory browsing options Response header IP restriction, if any Logging configuration You can manage the application through the Microsoft IIS Administration API.\n\nThe Microsoft IIS Administration API also provides an built-in API Explorer, which allows the developers to utilize the deep-in features exposed by administration API.\nAt the top right, you will find the link to browse API Explorer. It will redirect you to connect to the window, shown below, where it requires the same token, which you generated.\nAlternatively, you can create a new token. Enter Token , check the box for keeping you connected, and click C onnect .\n\nYou will be navigated to the window shown below, where you can deep dive with all the methods and results exposed by Administration API. We will learn more about this in later articles.\n\nConclusion We saw how Microsoft IIS administration API made life easy by allowing us to manage our Azure Virtual IIS machine on Hand-go reach.\nThis API is useful in scenarios where you have a hybrid deployment model with different Nano Servers, Windows Servers, etc. to manage and deploy from one single UI.\nAlso, this super cool API plays a very useful role for Continuous Integration and Continuos Development models.\nThe official documentation is not yet released. I hope you found this article useful and productive. \nHappy Azure coding!",

By: IANS | San Francisco  33 AM OpenAI is the billion project co-founded by Tesla CEO Musk, US-based startup incubator “Y Combinator” President Sam Altman and others. (Reuters) \nIn a move to “democratise” artificial intelligence (AI) and making it accessible to everyone, Microsoft has teamed up with OpenAI, a non-profit AI research organisation co-founded by Elon Musk. \nOpenAI is the $1 billion project co-founded by Tesla CEO Musk, US-based startup incubator “Y Combinator” President Sam Altman and others. \nAs part of the partnership, OpenAI will use Microsoft Azure as its primary cloud platform to help advance their research and create new tools and technologies that are only possible with the cloud. \n“OpenAI chose Microsoft due to our deep learning research and ongoing commitment to AI, along with Azure’s support for open source technologies and its unique combination of high performance computing, big data and intelligence capabilities,” Harry Shum, Executive Vice President, Microsoft Artificial Intelligence and Research Group, posted on its website on Wednesday. \nOpenAI is an early adopter of “Azure N-Series Virtual Machines”, which will be generally available starting in December. \nThese virtual machines are designed for the most intensive compute workloads, including deep learning, simulations, rendering and the training of neural networks. \nThey also enable high-end visualisation capabilities to allow for workstation and streaming scenarios by utilising the “NVIDIA GRID” in Azure. \n“In addition to OpenAI, other companies like Esri and Jellyfish Pictures are already using Azure N-Series,” Shum said. \nMicrosoft also announced to introduce the Azure Bot Service, a first of its kind in the industry. \nWith this new service, developers can accelerate the development of bots with the Microsoft Bot Framework and easily deploy and manage them in a serverless environment on Azure. \n“Running on Azure Functions, these bots can scale on demand and you only pay for the resources your bots consume. \n“Azure Functions, which is available today, can be used to maximise development agility and operational efficiency of nearly any app or service at lower cost,” Shum further posted. \nMore than 50,000 developers are already building bots with the Microsoft Bot Framework. \nThanks to cloud computing power, more advanced algorithms and the availability of massive amounts of data, the AI field has exploded — allowing computer scientists to create technology many of us only dreamed about just a few years ago.San Francisco  ",

      "text": "Microsoft will remove support for Office 2017 next year and without a doubt, many users and companies will be caught off-guard because this is pretty much what happens every time when the software giant pulls support for one of its products. It goes without saying that many still hope to see Microsoft extending support beyond the cutoff date, as it happened with Windows XP, but the company says in a statement that there’s no way Office 2007 would receive updates and security patches beyond October 2017. The purpose is obviously to convince users to switch to Office 365 or a newer version of the productivity suite, such as Office 2016, which the company is actively working on right now. Custom support no longer offered What’s important to know, however, is that Microsoft will no longer offer custom support either, so everyone will stop getting updates beyond the October 2017 deadline. Microsoft previously offered custom support to paying customers...",

      "text": "(Reuters) - OpenAI, the non-profit artificial intelligence (AI) research firm backed by Tesla Motors Inc's Elon Musk and other prominent tech executives, has signed an agreement to run most of its large-scale experiments on Microsoft Corp's flagship cloud service, Azure.\nOpenAI will use Azure for its experiments in deep learning and AI, and Microsoft will collaborate with the company on advancing research and creating new tools and technologies.\nMusk, along with venture capitalist Sam Altman, co-chairs OpenAI, whose backers apart from Musk include Amazon.com Inc's Amazon Web Services and tech investor Peter Thiel and LinkedIn Corp co-founder Reid Hoffman.\nOpenAI is an early adopter of Microsoft's Azure N-Series Virtual Machines service, which will be generally available from December.\nThese cloud-computing services, which are powered by Nvidia Corp graphics chips, are designed for the most intensive computing workloads, including deep learning and simulations.\n\"In the coming months we will use thousands to tens of thousands of these machines to increase both the number of experiments we run and the size of the models we train,\" OpenAI said in a blogpost. (http://bit.ly/2gdxifR)\nThe non-profit was created last December for the purpose of creating AI that augments human capabilities.\nThe investors have committed $1 billion to the startup, but OpenAI said it expects to spend only a \"tiny fraction\" of that in the next few years.\nOpenAI will continue to release open-source software to make it easier for people to run large-scale AI workloads on the cloud, and will provide Microsoft with feedback to ensure that Azure's capabilities keep pace with its advances in AI.\n(Reporting by Anya George Tharakan in Bengaluru)",

Photo: Reuters/Stephen Lam/Files Reuters \nOpenAI, the non-profit artificial intelligence (AI) research firm backed by Tesla Motors Inc's (TSLA.O) Elon Musk and other prominent tech executives, has signed an agreement to run most of its large-scale experiments on Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) flagship cloud service, Azure. \nOpenAI will use Azure for its experiments in deep learning and AI, and Microsoft will collaborate with the company on advancing research and creating new tools and technologies. \nMusk, along with venture capitalist Sam Altman, co-chairs OpenAI, whose backers apart from Musk include Amazon.com Inc's (AMZN.O) Amazon Web Services and tech investor Peter Thiel and LinkedIn Corp (LNKD.N) co-founder Reid Hoffman. \nOpenAI is an early adopter of Microsoft's Azure N-Series Virtual Machines service, which will be generally available from December. \nThese cloud-computing services, which are powered by Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) graphics chips, are designed for the most intensive computing workloads, including deep learning and simulations. \n\"In the coming months we will use thousands to tens of thousands of these machines to increase both the number of experiments we run and the size of the models we train,\" OpenAI said in a blogpost. \nThe non-profit was created last December for the purpose of creating AI that augments human capabilities. \nThe investors have committed $1 billion to the startup, but OpenAI said it expects to spend only a \"tiny fraction\" of that in the next few years. \nOpenAI will continue to release open-source software to make it easier for people to run large-scale AI workloads on the cloud, and will provide Microsoft with feedback to ensure that Azure's capabilities keep pace with its advances in AI.

      "text": "Gallery: Xbox app update for Windows 10 Technical Preview \nI’ve owned the Microsoft licensed remote control since buying my Xbox One. Even though I’m one of those people that bought the Xbox One with the Kinect, I still had to have the remote control. The original remote control is pretty neat in that it “comes on” when you move it, i.e., it’s motion activated. \nIt’s also a pretty simple remote and I liked that – at least I thought I did until I started testing the Talon Media Remote from PDP . The Talon Media Remote is more like a regular remote control and offers all the extras you’d expect. It also works as a motion activated device, so you don’t have to give up the cool factor of the original. Due to the additional features over the original Xbox One remote, the Talon Media Remote is also larger – but that also means it’s harder to lose. I can’t tell you the number of times I’ve had to tear apart the couch and neighboring chairs trying to find the original remote. And, while that’s still sure to happen with the Talon, it’s at least easier to locate. \nPlus, it’s a few dollars cheaper than the one Microsoft offers. \nHere’s what you can expect: · Easily control your Xbox One system with officially licensed media remote · Works with Blu-ray and streaming media applications · Motion activated backlit buttons · Soft rubberized texture with D-pad and A,B,X,Y button control · 2 AAA batteries included \nThe Talon Media Remote is available from Amazon for $15: PDP Talon Media Remote for Xbox One \nFor those that don’t yet have a remote control for the Xbox One, this is a great addition. And, for those who have kids like mine that lose the remote constantly – for this price – it’s a good solution for having an extra on hand.",

The two will also collaborate on ways to advance AI research and its use, Microsoft and Open AI said Tuesday in blog posts. \n\"In the coming months we will use thousands to tens of thousands of these machines to increase both the number of experiments we run and the size of the models we train,\" OpenAI said in its post. \nMicrosoft is investing in artificial intelligence research and product development in a variety of areas including medicine and bots, programs that chat with users to automate tasks. Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella has discussed the need for ethical rules as AI develops as well as creating ways to spread its benefits. Musk, who heads Tesla Motors Inc. and Space Exploration Technologies, teamed up with Y Combinator President Sam Altman and others, to form the nonprofit OpenAI in December, seeking to ensure AI is developed safety and its benefits are widely distributed. \nMicrosoft also said it's introducing the Azure Bot Service, a cloud service that lets companies and developers store and run bots in the Azure cloud.",

      "text": "If Apple ( AAPL ) ultimately produces smart glasses that prove to be a smash hit, it should send a thank-you card to Alphabet /Google ( GOOGL ) for all its missteps with Google Glass.\nAnd the company might also want to thank Microsoft ( MSFT ) for both showing how an augmented reality (AR) headset can capture imaginations and appeal to developers, and initially focusing on a headset that's only meant to be used indoors. But this assumes that Microsoft won't have enlarged its ambitions by the time Apple's own headset goes on sale.\nBloomberg, which has produced many Apple scoops since hiring the well-connected Mark Gurman away from 9to5 Mac, reported Monday that Apple is thinking about creating smart glasses that would \"connect wirelessly to iPhones, show images and other information in the wearer's field of vision, and may use augmented reality.\"\nIt adds Apple has \"ordered small quantities of near-eye displays from one supplier for testing,\" and that its glasses would launch in 2018 \"at the earliest.\" Himax ( HIMX ) , which supplied the micro-displays used by Google Glass, rose 2.7% on Tuesday.\nOne big qualifier to Bloomberg's report is that Apple often \"explores\" launching products that never see the light of day. However, the report does fit with one earlier this year from The Financial Times , which said Apple has created \"a large team of experts in virtual and augmented reality and built prototypes of headsets.\"\nApple and Alphabet are holdings in Jim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS Charitable Trust Portfolio .

      "text": "expand \nIntroduction and Background On Microsoft Windows operating systems, using great tools like Visual Studio, it is extremely easy to upload and publish your web application projects to Microsoft Azure; but what about other platforms such as Linux? Microsoft has recently released PowerShell as an open source project, which is a great tool to be used in the cases where you have developers who understand and use PowerShell. But, if you don't happen to have any such developer, you would need to stick around the traditional tools and sometimes, they will require you to manually perform these changes. In this post, I am going to cover the teams who are using Git repositories for their projects and I will cover how they can basically automate the publishing of their projects after each successful build. On Linux, we can basically create small scripts that run in the background just like PowerShell or the Windows Command Prompt terminal's batch files. Git programs are required for this to run. Actually, what I am going to show in this, is to execute the same commands but in a manner that most of the repository's information is already built, the commit message is updated, and the content is published to the Azure app service. The purpose of this guide is to make the entire process as easy to understand, as A, B and C. I will be using a real world application to show you how to do what and where instead of talking generally about many things at the same time. Before moving forward, a very little knowledge of how Git system works is required from you because some things might get a bit technical in the post below, and thus you must have the knowledge of how Git systems work, in order to control the versioning of files. Secondly, you are required to know how you can use \"dotnet\" script to create, build and run the .NET Core applications. If you don't know .NET Core, I will reference to a few of my own beginner-friendly articles which you can read to learn more on this. Finally, you are required to have an active Azure account with a working subscription. If you don't happen to have one, you can get a free account with $200 credits to try out all of Azure! Once these requirements are met, you can continue to actually use the article for something useful. Creating the application -- the entire part This part has been shared and taught many times, on many occasions. I wrote an article, on the same concept, a few days ago and I would like to refer that article to you to learn how you can create a new application with web template in .NET Core. Creating and hosting ASP.NET Core application on Linux — Nothing Third-Party . Read this article for a complete overview and a walk-though of the concept of building and running the applications on the Linux environment. I will move onward from this step, because you must be aware of the ways of creating your own applications. Deployment of web applications to Azure Now, comes the main part. This article entirely focuses on the deployment of applications to Microsoft Azure instead of developing an application. There would be some parts where I will be modifying the parts, but that is just to tell you how easy it would be to re-deploy the application using the automation, by executing a simple command. Although it is not required, but you are required to have a very basic introduction to automation tools. You can get a good tutorial about these \"toolings\" easily from any software engineering guide. Using git for deployment Microsoft Azure uses many methods and ways to deploy the applications on the cloud, such as using Visual Studio to deploy the applications and leave the configurations to the tool itself. However, since Linux environments don't have Visual Studio, most of the tasks are left with source control tools (Visual Studio Code also uses the same git programs to upload the code to repositories). I will show you how you can create a minimal script or a program that manages all of these tasks for you -- automation program. On Linux, mostly and typically, git comes pre-installed in most of the Linux-distributions, such as Ubuntu, etc. However, if that is not available, you can easily install it using. $ sudo apt-get install git Or using a similar command, such as using yum etc. This would install and setup the git for your environment. Once you have git installed, you need to set a few things up. Git requires the name and email address for notifying who made a change to the system. So for that, we would require to execute the following commands. $ git config --global user.name \"Eminem\" $ git config --global user.email \"email@domain.com\" You should pass the name and address values that you hold - I used Eminem and a random email address. And to check if your personal configurations are done correctly, you can execute the following command to test that. $ git config --list These are the required configurations that you must do before you can use git for any purpose at all. Note: You also need to create a new web application service (Azure App Service) on Microsoft Azure so that you can deploy the application somewhere. Since I do not want to go deep into the development and starting of this session, I would like you guys to go and watch this video of mine, providing an overview of Microsoft Azure App Service (you may have to put the volume a bit higher). Once you have that, you can continue forward and actually set up repositories to deploy the application. I used the following information while creating a new service, so that, if I use a name, you should know where did that come from. Upon creating, you can visit the web service from your browser using the link provided and on the first visit without any update, the following page is shown. It shows that you can deploy your web applications, from many sources, using many services such as FTP, Git etc. I will show you how to do this using Git... There are a few other things that I would like to show you here. I will show you how to do this, using git. I will also show you how to test the build integrity -- whether build succeeds or not. I will also show you whether git considers to commit and push the changes to the server or not. \nSo, these are a few of the tests that I have prepared for the automation tool that will be helpful for us in this case. These things are not provided on the tutorials that are available online. They are just simple straight-forward ones which only show you how to do it, not whether it is helpful to do it at all. Setting up the local repository On the machine side, the first thing to do is to set up a local repository for git deployments. Even if you have created a project, you can still create a repository for that project and then, use it as the source for your application's content. So, for that, the following commands would work. # If you have not created a project, remove these lines. $ dotnet new -t web",

      "text": "Microsoft’s Harry Shum and OpenAI’s Sam Altman\nThis week, Microsoft announced a partnership with OpenAI, the nonprofit research organization co-founded by futurist Elon Musk. The goal? Nothing less than the democratization of AI.\n“We’re excited to announce a new partnership with OpenAI focused on making significant contributions to advance the field of AI, while also furthering our mutual goal of using AI to tackle some of the world’s most challenging problems,” Microsoft Executive Vice President Harry Shum says . “We’re also excited that OpenAI chose Microsoft Azure as their primary cloud platform.”\nOpenAI’s use of Azure will help OpenAI advance their research and create new tools and technologies that are only possible with the cloud, a Microsoft representative told me. And while the two firms are aligned generally, Microsoft’s recent embrace of open technologies hasn’t hurt.\nThe firm has outlined three Azure services that will play a key role in the partnership. These are:\nAzure Bot Service. Available now in preview, the Azure Bot Service helps developers accelerate the development of bots using the Microsoft Bot Framework and then deploy and management them in a serverless environment on Azure. Microsoft notes that over 50,000 developers are already creating bots with the Microsoft Bot Framework for companies as diverse as AllRecipes.com, Lowe’s, and Uber.\nSponsored Azure Functions. Now generally available, Azure Functions can maximize development agility and operational efficiency for nearly any app or service. and do so at lower costs. Azure Bot Service also runs on Azure Functions, which allows the bots to scale on-demand, Microsoft says.\nAzure N-series virtual machines. Coming in December, the Azure N-series VMs are designed for the most intensive compute workloads, including deep learning, simulations, rendering and the training of neural networks.\n“We’ve made major strides in artificial intelligence just in the past five years, achieving milestones many people who have devoted their lives to the field wouldn’t have thought possible,” Mr. Shum adds. “Now, we have the opportunity to help our partners and customers use these breakthroughs to achieve their goals.”\nFor its part, OpenAI notes that moving to Azure is helping them scale higher and faster than before.\nSponsored “Azure has impressed us by building hardware configurations optimized for deep learning,” the OpenAI explains . “They offer K80 GPUs with InfiniBand interconnects at scale. We’re also excited by their roadmap, which should soon bring Pascal GPUs onto their cloud.”\nOpenAI promises to share the results of its research with everyone, and to release software that will allow anyone to run large-scale AI projects in the cloud. It will also be working with Microsoft to help improve Azure going forward as the firms’ collective understanding of AI evolves. “We’re looking forward to accelerating the AI community through this partnership,” OpenAI says.\n \nThe post Microsoft Partners with Elon Musk’s OpenAI appeared first on Petri .\n",

      "text": "BRUSSELS Microsoft has offered concessions to EU antitrust regulators over its $26 billion bid for social network LinkedIn, the European Commission said on Wednesday.\nThe move came after the EU competition enforcer expressed concerns about the deal at a meeting with Microsoft executives.\nThe Commission, which will rule on the deal by December 6, did not provide details. It is expected to seek feedback from rivals and customers before deciding whether to accept the concessions, demand more or open a full investigation.\nThe U.S. software company is making its largest ever acquisition, which will allow it to add a suite of sales, marketing and recruiting services to its core business products as it gears up for next-generation computing.\n(Reporting by Foo Yun Chee; editing by Philip Blenkinsop)",

      "text": "\n\nMAPI Over HTTP Is the default Outlook Desktop Connection Protocol for Office 365 Microsoft released MAPI over HTTP (the “Alchemy” project) as part of Exchange 2013 SP1 in May 2014 . Well before that time, MAPI over RPC had been running inside Office 365 to shake down the new protocol before it was released to on-premises customers. The replacement for the long-established RPC over HTTP (aka “Outlook Anywhere”) protocol, MAPI over HTTP is designed to accommodate the demands of modern networking environments where devices hop from network to network and seamless mobility is everything.\nThe natural conclusion for the process has now come to pass. Microsoft is giving Office 365 tenants almost a year’s warning that RPC over HTTP connections will not be supported for Exchange Online after October 31, 2017 . Outlook Anywhere is heading for the rubbish heap, but only for Office 365 as on-premises Exchange will continue to support this venerable protocol.\nChanging Networks, Changing Protocols When you consider what’s happening, the process seems fair. Outlook Anywhere was designed to transport the Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs) used by Outlook desktop clients across an internet connection. Only HTTPS needed to be enabled for firewalls and no VPNs were necessary.\nWhen it was released, Outlook Anywhere was an immediate hit, especially when used with the then-new Outlook 2003 client and its “drizzle mode synchronization.” The protocol, client, and growing availability of Wi-Fi networks made mobility a reality for many and released users from the need for tiresome dial-up connections and extended synchronization sessions.\nThat was some thirteen years ago. When you consider what’s happened since, especially in the areas of mobile devices and networks, a case can be advanced to change the default protocol used by Outlook to something more modern and discard a protocol designed for LAN connections.\nMicrosoft’s HTTP Based Clients Microsoft has a lot of experience with clients that are based on HTTP. Both Exchange ActiveSync (EAS) and Outlook Web App (OWA) clients use longstanding HTTP connections to communicate with Exchange. These connections don’t require the complicated handshaking used when RPC connections are made, which means that they work much better than Outlook over low-quality links.\nAccording to Microsoft, MAPI over HTTP:\nProvides faster connection times to Exchange (especially after a network connection is interrupted, such as when a client switches network). RPC connections require more work to switch networks, most of which is hidden from users because the way that Outlook works in cached Exchange mode. Hibernation is another situation in which faster connections are enabled, again this is a capability that is more important in today’s environment. Improves the connection resiliency. In other words, the protocol doesn’t experience as many problems over flaky networks when packets might be dropped. Enables more secure connections by supporting Multi-Factor Authentication for Outlook 2013 and Outlook 2016. Removes the dependency on the very old RPC technology and focuses on HTTP as the communications protocol for the future. MAPI over HTTP is easier for support personnel to debug when working on connectivity problems. All sounds good. And MAPI over HTTP works and works well. I’ve been using it exclusively for the last two years and haven’t experienced any problems. That being said, Outlook desktop still remains the fat pig of Exchange clients and the new protocol does little to restrain the demands the client makes on network resources. If you’re in a network-constrained environment, such as using Wi-Fi on an airplane, OWA usually delivers a better user experience.\nClient Updates Might Be Required It’s easier for Microsoft to enforce change inside Office 365 than it is in the on-premises world. It controls all the necessary server upgrades (all of which are done) and can force tenants to upgrade clients to remain supported. Some work might be necessary to upgrade Outlook desktop software to one of the supported versions:\nOutlook 2016 Outlook 2013 SP1 Outlook 2010 SP2 In all cases, clients should be updated with the latest patches. In particular, the December 2015 updates contain several important fixes to improve the stability and performance of MAPI over HTTP. These updates should be considered the baseline version for deployment. Outlook 2007 was never updated with MAPI over HTTP capability, so you won’t be able to use this client to connect to Exchange Online after the deadline.\nIt is possible that some Outlook 2016 or Outlook 2013 clients might be blocking MAPI over HTTP connections. This is done by setting the MapiHttpDisabled registry key to 1 (one). Clients might have been configured for on-premises users to force the use of RPC over HTTP connections before their mailboxes were moved to Exchange Online and forgotten about since. The fix is easy (set the value to zero or delete it from the registry), but it’s wise to check before users start to report that they can’t connect on October 31, 2017.\nDiscovering Clients No out-of-the-box method exists inside Office 365 to discover whether any Outlook clients need to be patched or updated. The Get-ConnectionByClientTypeDetailReport cmdlet tells you what users have used MAPI clients to connect to Exchange Online, but those MAPI clients can connect using either MAPI over HTTP or RPC over HTTP. Figuring out version numbers for clients that connect to Exchange is straightforward in an on-premises environment , but is more complex for Office 365 as Microsoft controls the required information. Curiously, although the Get-LogonStatistics cmdlet is available for Exchange Online, any attempt to pass it a mailbox identity fails.\nPerhaps the new “Email clients used report” promised in the “ What’s new in Office 365 Admin October 2016 ” post will provide all the necessary information. We shall see.\nExtended Lifetimes With respects to on-premises Exchange , you obviously have more control over when you upgrade both server and desktop software, so you can persist in using RPC over HTTP for as long as it’s supported. In some cases, software that can’t use MAPI over HTTP is supported for some time to come. Outlook 2007 leaves extended support on October 10, 2017 (one of the reasons why Microsoft never backported MAPI over HTTP to this client). Outlook 2010 lingers until October 13, 2020 and Outlook 2013 until April 11, 2023. This site provides a useful overview of support dates .\nIn some respects, this transition is simply an example of Microsoft changing the internal plumbing for the cloud. You shouldn’t have any concerns if modern clients are deployed. Some pain might be in prospect if ancient clients persist. Such is what happens with old (but still useful) software.\nFollow Tony on Twitter @12Knocksinna .\nWant to know more about how to manage Office 365?
