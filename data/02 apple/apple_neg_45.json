      "text": "I thought it was a personal problem. I thought it was something I did.\nBut it turns out the spam events popping up my Apple ( AAPL ) Calendars app is more widespread than on just the devices my wife and I use.\nIt is indeed spam and it's got to do with the company's iCloud service. Invitations to sales events continue to pop up on users' calendars, and regardless of what response you provide when prompted to reject or accept it, the spammer wins .\nAll they want to know is whether you are active and that your email works with the plan. That way they can continue to spam going forward. Of course, Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales aren't helping matters.\nAccording to Alan Woodward, a cybersecurity expert, the spammers are finding a vulnerability in iCloud, which then forces users to either deactivate the service (not very practical for those who use it regularly) or weave through a complicated work around.\nThe other alternative is to ignore the alerts and hope they disappear. That seems to have worked for me - for now. But there's no guarantee it won't come back. It's even more frustrating because these users did not sign up to receive these alerts.\nThis news comes just a few days after we reported that users' call data may be vulnerable news on Apple's iCloud.\nIt seems an update may be in order.\nShares of Apple closed at $111.46 Tuesday, down 0.1%.",

      "text": "NEW YORK ( TheStreet ) -- Shares of Apple ( AAPL ) were slightly higher in early afternoon trading on Tuesday, the day after The Wall Street Journal reported that it was testing 10 different prototypes for the iPhone 8. The new phone model is expected to be released in 2017, the iPhone's 10th anniversary.\nSome possibilities include a curved screen, glass casing or an edge-to-edge screen, according to the Journal .\nApple is coming out with this product because it needs to reinvent itself, said Fox Business' Ashley Webster on \"Varney & Company\" on Tuesday. People are expecting and wanting Apple to release a unique product, he added.\nApple is a holding in Jim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS Charitable Trust Portfolio . Want to be alerted before Cramer buys or sells AAPL ? Learn more now .\nThe tech giant needs to reestablish growth by creating something new, agreed Rosecliff Capital's Michael Murphy on the show. \"Updating the iPhone from a 6 to a 7 to an 8 isn't innovation.\"\nApple stock is off its recent highs, and investors may want to consider whether the stock is a growth story before buying it, Murphy suggested.\nThe iPhone 8 design update already sounds \"more aesthetic than it is functionality,\" said Fiscal Times columnist and show guest Liz Peek. The fact that Apple still has 10 prototypes to test at this point \"doesn't seem very promising,\" she added.\nSeparately, TheStreet Ratings objectively rated this stock according to its \"risk-adjusted\" total return prospect over a 12-month investment horizon. Not based on the news in any given day, the rating may differ from Jim Cramer's view or that of this article's author.",

      "text": " Shares of Apple ( AAPL ) were higher in afternoon trading on Tuesday despite UBS managing director Steve Milunovich forecasting near-term struggles for the tech titan. Milunovich said there might be some slight downside uncertainty to current iPhone estimates for December and March.\n\"He is focused on the here and now, and I think everybody else is starting to talk about the (iPhone 8) already. That is really where everybody's focus is pushing out to,\" Co-founder of Najarian Family and Advisors Office Pete Najarian said on CNBC's \"Halftime Report\" today.\nNajarian reaffirmed his position to hold the stock and remains focused on the next installment Apple's iPhone.\n\"I think if you own it, it is a cheap stock,\" Aureus Asset Management CEO Karen Firestone said. \"But, would I buy it if I did not own it now? Not in the next few months.\" Simply, she doesn't see any short term catalyst driving the stock higher.\nRitholtz Wealth Management CEO Josh Brown, however, believes it's not worth waiting for the catalyst.\n\"I am long the name, I think the stock goes higher,\" he said. \"We have just seen it trade up 20 points from July, up until last month. It is minutes away from breaking back above its 50-day moving average.\"\n(Apple is held in Jim Cramer's charitable trust portfolio Action Alerts PLUS. See all of Cramer's holdings with a free trial .)\nSeparately, TheStreet Ratings objectively rated this stock according to its \"risk-adjusted\" total return prospect over a 12-month investment horizon. Not based on the news in any given day, the rating may differ from Jim Cramer's view or that of this articles's author. TheStreet Ratings has this to say about the recommendation:",

      "text": " The Apple ( AAPL ) iPhone is the No. 1 requested gift this holiday season, despite the release of the Pixel smartphone from Alphabet's ( GOOGL ) Google, according to Piper Jaffray.\nThe iPhone still trumps the Pixel phone because it's easier to get your hands on, Mizuho Securities analyst Abhey Lamba said on CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street\" on Tuesday morning. The firm has a buy rating and a $130 price target on the stock.\nApple and Google are holdings in Jim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS Charitable Trust Portfolio . Want to be alerted before Cramer buys or sells AAPL or GOOGL ? Learn more now .\n\"This weekend I went phone shopping and had a hard time finding a Pixel I could even play with,\" Lamba noted.\nPeople are \"more familiar\" with the iPhone and can get it easier, and so it will probably do \"much better\" than the Pixel, Lamba said.\nApple customers buy the company's products not for the hardware, but for the ecosystem that Apple provides them, said RBC Capital Markets analyst and additional show guest Amit Daryanani. He has an outperform rating and a $125 price target on the stock.\n\"Apple has an ecosystem that it provides to customers,\" he said. \"I don't think that changes with a Pixel or some other Android competition.\"\nHowever, the key for Apple's December quarter is that there are more \"supply constraints\" rather than \"command-driven\" constraints on the iPhone, Daryanani said. \"That is going to be the biggest focus.\"\nSeparately, TheStreet Ratings objectively rated this stock according to its \"risk-adjusted\" total return prospect over a 12-month investment horizon.

      "text": "News, analysis, and actionable investing ideas. Search Tech Trader Daily2 November 29, 2016, 11:25 A.M. ET Apple iPhone Could be Soft This Quarter, Says UBS; Buy for 2018 By Tiernan Ray \nShares of Apple ( AAPL ) are down 52 cents, or half a percent, at $111.02, after UBS ’s Steve Milunovich reiterated a Buy rating on the stock, and a $127 price target, but warned that his estimate for how many units of iPhone the company is ready to produce are going down for this quarter and next, putting Street expectations at risk. \nMilunovich is revising down his “procurement estimates,” without citing sources: Procurement numbers for Dec are revised down to 74mn from 75mn units, a 1% decline YoY. New estimates for March are 42mn units, down from 43mn last year. Units continue to shift toward the 7 Plus with 26mn estimated in F1Q/17 vs 17mn units in F1Q/16. This shift should support ASPs. Investors have been concerned about the Mar quarter as Apple faces a relatively difficult comparison. Our survey shows strength for the iPhone 7 in the US and Europe but potential softness in China. \nMilunovich isn’t changing his actual numbers for Apple, but he notes his 76-million unit sales estimate for this quarter is below what he deems Street consensus at 78 million units. \nHis advice regarding the stock is that any shortfall may not matter much because the focus is really on a forthcoming “fiscal 18 product cycle.” Error message Name We welcome thoughtful comments from readers.

Every quarter of iPhone sales will be said to be soft all the way to 2018. 2017 hasn't even started and for Apple shareholders, that entire year most likely won't bring them any share gains. How does it feel to own a stock said to have a losing year before it even starts? Truthfully, it feels lousy. Years are coming and going and Apple is making almost no share gains at all while the rest of the tech companies are all seeing very decent gains in their stock price. Tim Cook is just coasting along and doing almost nothing for Apple shareholders. If Apple has some attractive products in its pipeline, I really can't wait to see them. \nOn May, 29th, 2015 Apple touched $132 a share. Now it's already December 2016 and Apple's stock price is at $111 a share with no prospects of going any higher or investors having any interest in the company. Where have all those past high yearly analysts price targets gone? Pretty much out the window and never even close to being reached. I can easily see Apple below $115 in May 2017. Apple's stock price moves up and down in a narrow range. One could easily suspect Apple isn't making any money at all. Apple is said to be making profits and the reserve cash pile certainly seems to be growing. However, that P/E of 12-13 seems to put Apple in the P/E range of a failing tech company. Even struggling companies such as Twitter and Yahoo seem to warrant a better P/E than Apple. It's really quite discouraging how Tim Cook can simply let Apple slide down a slippery slope when there's no real reason to have it that way. There's nothing really holding Apple back except for passive management. To report offensive comments email ",

      "title": "How to Watch Amazon Prime on Apple TV",
      "text": "How to Watch Amazon Prime on Apple TV By Todd Bernhard on Tue, 11/29/2016 \nMy colleague, Jim Karpen, has a great roundup of free Apple TV apps for watching free movies and TV shows. However, there is no Amazon app for Apple TV, which means there is no Amazon Video on the Apple TV. This is a shame because Amazon Prime is the gift that keeps on giving. Subscribers to Prime get a bunch of great benefits, starting with free two-day shipping on many items, to free e-books, free music, and free videos. Amazon's originals, like The Man in the High Castle and Transparent are only available to Amazon Prime members. But that doesn't mean the answer to the question \"Can I watch Amazon Prime on Apple TV?\" is no. Here's how to stream Amazon Video on Apple TV. \nHaving no Apple TV Amazon app is a glaring absence. Apple recently launched cross-app voice search, using the Siri remote for Apple TV. This allows a user to say \"play Star Trek\" and the Apple TV will do the hard work of finding Star Trek movies and shows regardless of which app or service is required. You can still count the number of supported services on one hand, but eventually that will change. If a desired movie or show is on Amazon Video, the search feature won't find it. Until this changes, here is how you can watch Amazon Video on your Apple TV, including on the previous generation model. How to Watch Amazon Prime on Apple TV Using an iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch \nFirst, open the free Amazon Video app on an iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch. When you find the desired video, start playing. Next, look for the AirPlay logo or swipe up to access the Control Panel and find the AirPlay icon. Tap that to select your Apple TV and use AirPlay to send the audio and video stream. It's not perfect but it works. Amazon Video offers some clever enhancements like X-Ray, which lets you access information about the actors currently on screen, on your iOS device while the movie plays on the big screen. You can also enable or disable captioning, pause, rewind, fast forward, and even use the timeline to move back and forth in the video. How to Watch Amazon Prime on Apple TV Using a Mac \nNavigate to the Amazon Video and use the Mac's Display Preferences to send the media to the Apple TV. \nYou could also use a Macintosh running the Safari browser and send the media via AirPlay. Another option is to use Apple's Digital Video adapter which basically converts the Lightning port to HDMI and provides a Lightning jack so you can charge your iOS device. You will need to provide an HDMI cable to connect to your TV. Amazon competes with Apple, not just in devices like the Kindle Fire versus the Apple iPad but in selling and streaming media. I usually am disappointed if I write an article and Apple releases a new product that makes it obsolete. But in this case, I'd rejoice. Until Apple and Amazon can work things out, this will have to do.  ",

In addition to Canada, student pricing has been expanded to 22 other countries, including Belgium, Brazil, Colombia, Finland, France and Hong Kong. \nTo confirm your discount, users must use a third-party service contracted by Apple called UNiDAYS and enter their email and the accredited college or university. Students can also secure the discount by logging in via their school’s WiFi. \nThe $4.99 discounted price is only available for up to 48 months.",

      "text": "Apple's iPhone owners are reporting some trouble with their batteries after updating to the latest iOS version.\nFolks over at the Apple support forums are reporting that after they updated to iOS 10.1.1, they noticed their iPhones would turn off when battery life reached 30 percent. After plugging it back in, the device would turn back on. However, it again says that the battery life is at 30 percent.\n\nWhile the post, which was published last month, initially focused on older iPhones suffering from the problem, newer posters have said that it also affects devices up through the iPhone 6s. So far, there are no reports of the problem also affecting iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus owners.\nAccording to posters, they'll be using their iPhones as normal and then when battery life says it reaches 30 percent, the phone dies. With the iPhone unplugged, users would try to boot up the handset and it wouldn't turn on. When it's plugged into a power source, however, it turns back on and says it has 30 percent battery life.\nMORE: Best Holiday Tech Deals: TVs, Speakers, WiFi, Laptops and more \nIt's not immediately clear whether the operating system's built-in gauge on battery life has gone bad in the software update or if a bug in the update is causing the iPhone's battery life to diminish more quickly.\nBatteries in the iPhone have proven to be a problem for Apple over the last several months. Last week, for instance, the company announced a program that would replace bad batteries in the iPhone 6s at no charge . That problem was especially a concern in China and was similar to the latest discovery and iPhone batteries were dying prematurely.\nIt's unclear what might be causing the problem in the latest flaw, but some posters say iOS 10.1 will also affect their devices. Most, though, say iOS 10.1.1, a small update that was released late last month and centered on fixes to the operating system's Health app, is causing a problem on other handsets.\nOddly, the problem also appears to be in the iOS 10.2 beta, which is available now to developers but hasn't yet made its way to the public. Whether Apple will fix it before iOS 10.2 is released is unknown. That said, some users who have contacted Apple Support about the problem say the company is aware of the issue and will be issuing a fix at some point.\nFor now, though, there is no simple fix.\nSee Also : 29 Hidden iOS 10 Features You Need to Try \nThe Best iOS Apps You're Not Using (But Should Be) Best Places to Buy and Sell a Used iPhone Why You Might Want to Skip iPhone 7 and Wait for 8 About the author Don Reisinger Read more iPhone Smartphones Apple Add a comment Comment Firstname Submit Ask a Category Expert Create a new thread in the iPhone forum about this subject Title Subject Title Publish 1 comment Your comment Bruce_Almighty Nov 29, 2016, 9:49 AM IOS 10 has been very buggy. I experience the above issue regularly and another which I haven't seen documented. The phone soft boots every now and again. I get the black screen with spinning gear, it goes dark and about 10 seconds later I am back at the lock screen. It appears to me to be a reboot, but I don't know how to determine the last boot time to confirm this. I thought I might have a hardware issue, but this problem did not occur prior to upgrading to IOS 10. 0 1 comments Comment Firstname Submit",

      "text": "Apple's iPhone 8 will shatter previous sales records: Top analyst Photo: Reuters \nApple suppliers are slated to make 120 million to 150 million iPhones in the second half of 2017, a volume that would crush all previous sales, according to a top analytics firm report cited by 9to5Mac. \nKGI Securities forecasts three new iPhones with wireless charging from Apple next year, 9to5Mac reported Tuesday. \nThe phones could include one major redesign, the iPhone 8, with two more iterative updates to the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, according to 9to5Mac. \nWith features like a glass chassis and a bright, flexible screen, the new handsets could outsell Apple's most popular phone to date, the iPhone 6 phablets, KGI's analysis said. \nKGI's updated forecast comes on the heels of a Wall Street Journal report that Apple is considering more than 10 designs for its 10th anniversary iPhone next year, including at least one flexible screen design. \nTo be sure, Apple doesn't always sell every iPhone it plans to make. \nLast year, Apple initially provided the supply chain with high numbers only to cut numbers later, according to UBS analysts. \nBut an iPhone sales boost could provide much-needed relief to Apple investors, who watched iPhone sales drop from their year-ago volumes for three-straight quarters this year. \nAnalysts surveyed by FactSet expect Apple to sell 78 million iPhones in the December 2016 quarter, up from 75 million from a year ago, bringing the second-half 2016 sales to 124 million.

      "text": "  Why you should fight Apple’s Subscription Extortion  //blog.teamtreehouse.com/why-you-should-fight-apples-subscription-extortion. Captcha Submit \nApple just dropped a nuclear bomb on all of us with their new App Store subscriptions announcement . Here’s the summary: “We’re going to take 30% of your web app revenue. Just because we can.” \nThis is nothing more than extortion by the second most valuable company in the world (only Exxon Mobil is worth more). They’re leveraging their power to dramatically increase their own profit. \nLet me pull out a couple key points and then I’ll explain why this is such a raw deal. \n“Subscriptions purchased from within the App Store will be sold using the same App Store billing system that has been used to buy billions of apps and In-App Purchases. Publishers set the price and length of subscription (weekly, monthly, bi-monthly, quarterly, bi-yearly or yearly). Then with one-click, customers pick the length of subscription and are automatically charged based on their chosen length of commitment (weekly, monthly, etc.). Customers can review and manage all of their subscriptions from their personal account page, including canceling the automatic renewal of a subscription. Apple processes all payments, keeping the same 30 percent share that it does today for other In-App Purchases.” \n“Apple does require that if a publisher chooses to sell a digital subscription separately outside of the app, that same subscription offer must be made available, at the same price or less, to customers who wish to subscribe from within the app.” \nAnd finally, the cherry on top … \n“… publishers may no longer provide links in their apps (to a web site, for example) which allow the customer to purchase content or subscriptions outside of the app.” \nPlease read that one more time. \nApple will not allow you to encourage your iOS customers to pay for your subscription service outside the App Store fence. \nIf you design a great iOS app that complements your SaaS app, you are not allowed to link to your own signup page. The only way for someone to sign up to pay for your web app, once they’re inside the iOS app, is by giving Apple 30%. \n[UPDATE] \nI’d like to clarify something, as it’s come up in the comments. More and more web designers and developers are building recurring revenue web apps and Apple hasn’t been able to tap that revenue stream (besides Mobile Me). \nMany of these web apps also build iOS apps to complement their free plans, aiming to wow their customers into upgrading to a paid subscription. Now Apple is going to tax those companies 30% for any users who upgrade in-app. \nHere’s a theoretical example: A startup launches an invoicing web app called Super-Duper Invoices, which has a free plan which allows you to send five free invoices a month. They build a great iOS app to compliment this free plan, which allows you to see some useful stats on those invoices (like average days to collect payment, outstanding invoices, average monthly billing, etc). Inside the iOS app, they encourage you to upgrade to the paid plan, and when you click on the link, it takes you to your account page on the web, where you click ‘Upgrade’. \nNow Apple won’t allow this. If you want your customers to upgrade in-app, Apple is going to tax you 30%. \nThis is a game-changer, and I am strongly opposed to it. \n[end UPDATE] But wait, isn’t the App Store and one-click buying a good thing? \nThe power of the App Store is in two things: Reaching the mass market . That’s awesome for people who are building games or non-niche products. They benefit hugely from this powerful distribution channel (Angry Birds anyone?). One-click buying. No more credit card forms or “Your card was declined” messages. Click-and-forget. This is definitely powerful, and I’d happily pay a slight premium to Apple for this, but NOT 30% of all my revenue going forward. \nAll of us folks who have built up a following in a small niche market (web design and development, for us) don’t need the mass-market distribution channel that the App Store provides. We’re not going to put up with Apple demanding we fork over 30% of our revenue just so our customers can have an iOS experience. \nDoes Apple deserve a large cut for the massive audience they bring to mass-market apps? You bet. \nDo they deserve the same cut from companies who are simply augmenting their offering with iOS apps. Definitely not. \n[UPDATE] \nLet’s examine the massive negative financial impact of Apple’s new policy, using Think Vitamin Membership as an example. \nOur average plan value is $31/mo and we currently have a churn rate of about 10%, so our average customer lifetime value is $310. \nWe budget $25 to acquire a new customer, plus 4% processing fees for each transaction. Over the lifetime of a customer, that would be a total of $25 + $12.40 = $37.40. \nNow Apple is going to take 30% of all future revenue, not just a one-time fee of 30% . That’s $93.00 if someone signs up in-app. \nYou could argue that Apple would increase your revenue because of the powerful distribution network of the App Store, but this is only true if they feature your app. Otherwise it’s still down to us to market the app effectively. \nA great example of this is Sparrow and Remember the Milk – two iOS apps that I discovered because of Twitter, not App Store promotion. \nA lot of apps aimed at the web community will fall into this camp – not big enough to be featured by the App Store because the niche is too small. Therefore there is no extra marketing value from being in the App Store and forking over the extra 30% to Apple. \n[end UPDATE] Forget iOS and bring on the HTML5 mobile apps \nThis is the push we all need to go HTML5, CSS3, jQuery for our next ‘iOS’ app instead of native iOS apps. This is exactly what 37signals recently did with the mobile version of Basecamp . \nAnother advantage to going HTML5 instead of iOS native is that you have one code base. No need to launch a different version for every mobile platform. \nI’m a huge Apple fan. I’ve spent $50,000+ over the years buying Apple products for our Team. \nThis is something different though. This is bullshit and I don’t think we should stand for it. Do your part by speaking out and letting Apple know this isn’t OK. \nWould love to hear your thoughts. \nOther reading …",

      "text": "Apple might start reporting launch weekend iPhone sales numbers again next year, assuming this report is accurate: renowned Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo says the iPhone 8 will convince a massive number of buyers to purchase the phone, helping Apple eclipse the current record. DON’T MISS: There’s a fix for your iPhone 6s’ serious battery drain, but you might not like it\nApple had announced before iPhone 7 sales started that it won’t report launch weekend numbers , prompting many to speculate that Apple is not expecting the new phone to top the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s’s launch weekend performances. Even so, indirect analytics data revealed that Apple did very well, with the iPhone 7 sales performance being comparable with previous years.\nKuo said in a note to investors received by 9to5Mac that Apple might sell between 120 million and 150 million iPhone 8 units in the second half of next year. Apple sold between 110 million and 120 million iPhone 6 units in 2014. The iPhone 6 represented a major redesign, and the first iPhone series to feature a bigger display.\nThe new OLED iPhone would drive this unprecedented iPhone demand, although the other two iPhone 8 models will not be boring. The same Kuo said the 4.7-inch LCD model will also have an all-glass design and feature wireless charging support, just like the OLED version.\nKuo said that the OLED iPhone 8 will represent Apple’s major redesign, while the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus would be iterative updates to the current iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. All iPhones are expected to offer similar specs when it comes to internal hardware. Furthermore, the OLED and iPhone 8 Plus versions should have dual-lens cameras on the back.\nApple is expected to launch the new iPhones in mid-September, so we’ve got plenty of waiting to do.\nTrending right now:\nSamsung has started to turn the Galaxy Note 5 into the Note 7 Leak reveals another key Galaxy S8 feature that has never been seen before on an iPhone How to stop receiving iCloud calendar invite spam on your iPhone and Mac See the original version of this article on BGR.com",

      "text": "Few people took Donald Trump seriously when he said in March that he’d “get Apple to start making their computers and their iPhones on our land, not in China”. But his election appears to have caused a change of heart.\nApple has reportedly asked the two Asian companies that assemble the bulk of its iPhones to assess whether they can bring the work to the US. One of them, Foxconn, has agreed to look into the matter.\nTrump’s supporters have embraced this news as a sign of his power to persuade wayward corporations to make America great again. But as Apple and its manufacturing partners know, and as President Trump will soon find out, it’ll never happen. The US lacks the workforce and supply chains necessary for Apple to move its iPhone operation back home. And more to the point, Americans shouldn’t want it to.\nAlthough Apple’s original supply chain included a suburban American garage, Asia quickly became central to the company’s growth. In 1981, it opened a facility in Singapore to manufacture logic boards and other components. It was a no-brainer, according to a manager who ran the facility: “We find that no country can provide the combination of infrastructure, technical ability, supporting industries, governmental efficiency, support and incentives that Singapore offers.”\nIn the decades that followed, China emulated Singapore’s approach on a massive scale, developing industrial clusters with world-class infrastructure and offering land and subsidies to companies willing to relocate. By 2004, Apple had shut down its last US manufacturing operation, and China had become the industrial hub of its global empire. \nLow labour costs and minimal regulation were certainly part of China’s appeal. But the most important factor was its huge and nimble workforce.\nThe main iPhone facility in Zhengzhou now employs 110,000 workers, with other factories employing hundreds of thousands more. China’s 270 million migrant labourers — most of them ambitious and opportunistic — have proven indispensable to a business that prizes flexibility. Last summer, Apple contractors reportedly hired 100,000 workers to ramp up production of the iPhone 6s in advance of its fall release.\nNothing comparable could ever happen in the US, no matter what the president wants. A mass mobilisation on that scale, and at that speed, likely hasn’t been attempted since World War II. And there’s little reason to think it would be successful or desirable today, even if Apple was willing to try.\nFinding enough skilled labour wouldn’t be much easier. Apple CEO Tim Cook told “60 Minutes” last year that, thanks to better vocational education, China now has a more skilful workforce than the US.\nApple’s executives estimate that they’d need 8,700 industrial engineers to oversee 200,000 assembly line workers, yet only 7,000 students completed university-level industrial-engineering programmes in the US.\nin 2014. Shenzhen, by contrast, is home to 240,000 Foxconn employees — and millions of additional engineers and labourers. Such a heavy concentration of manufacturing and skills in one place gives China its other major advantage.\nMost of the hundreds of parts that go into an iPhone are made a short distance from where the devices are assembled. This speeds up production, reduces the need for warehousing and trims logistics costs.\nThose factories can also ramp up production as quickly as Apple needs, thanks to a ready supply of labour. It’s an industrial ecosystem that took decades to evolve, and it’s not going to relocate to the US.\nMoreover, Americans shouldn’t want it to. That ecosystem has made Apple one of the world’s most profitable companies, supporting 2 million domestic jobs. It’s what allows Americans to buy some incredible gadgets at a (relatively) affordable price.\nAnd it’s helping give rise to a vast and tech-savvy Asian middle-class — which will produce plenty of customers for American goods and services. All that would disappear if Apple were somehow forced to ship production back to American shores, likely doubling its costs in the process.\nIf Trump wants to revive manufacturing in the US, it will require more than hectoring Apple. It will mean supporting vocational education on a huge scale, offering Chinese-style industrial subsidies and waiting around for decades for all of it to have an effect — all in pursuit of tedious, low-paid jobs that are increasingly obsolete as industrial robots improve.\nIn reality, an American iPhone is likely just one more empty campaign promise. And that’s for the best.",

      "text": "Apple has rolled out its student membership plans to 25 additional countries and the long list now includes India as well. While Apple Music has been available in India for a while now at some really low prices, the student membership plan priced at Rs 90 still seems like a steal of a deal.\nThe new student membership plan will now be the lowest priced plan for an Apple Music subscription in India at Rs 90. The new plan will sit alongside the already available individual membership plan at Rs 120 per month and the family membership plan at Rs 190 per month.\n\nThose who want to avail of the new student membership plan will need to go through a short verification process which can be done with Apple’s partner, UNiDAYS. Students will need to add their email address along with the school ID and more to get through the quick verification process. Once students have verified themselves with the service, they can avail the subscription plan at a discounted rate.\nBut the verification process is no gimmick as the UNiDAYS will regularly check with the subscriber to see if the he/she is still a college student. If the system finds out that the subscriber is no longer a student it switches the student plan to an individual one automatically. The validity of the student plan comes for only 48 months.\nThe post Apple Music introduces student membership plan starting at Rs 90 a month appeared first on Tech2 .",

      "text": "Samsung's second appeal on Apple's slide-to-unlock patent case denied, $120 million verdict upheld Samsung's second appeal on Apple's slide-to-unlock patent case denied, $120 million verdict upheld Posted: Tags : Samsung - Samsung + Apple - Apple + Patents - Patents + Back in May 2014, an epic patent infringement legal battle between Apple and Samsung resulted in $119.6 million verdict for Samsung to pay on violating three Apple patents. This was down from the original $2.2 billion in damages sought, and concerned the OG iPhone's slide-to-unlock, quick links and auto-correct features. Samsung then filed an appeal, succeeding in overturning the verdict, but Apple countered with a review which reconfirmed it last month. The lawyers of the Korean conglomerate went to the US Court of Appeals for a whole court hearing, but now the judges there have overturned this second appeal. The only chance that Samsung stands of not paying in this situation, is if it goes all the way up to the Supreme Court, and it probably will, as the first patent case that involved Apple and Samsung has also reached Supreme Court level, and a verdict is expected in the spring. For what it's worth, Samsung's slide-to-unlock and auto-correct usage may ultimately cost it $120 million, which is way down from the initial billions sought, but still a sizeable chunk.",

      "text": "Apple Expands Apple Music Student Pricing To 25 More Countries  34 PST \nWhile Apple’s products tend to be on the premium/pricey side of things, Apple Music is actually one of their more affordable products. Set at $10 a month, it is pretty much on par with the industry at the moment. In fact for students, Apple has priced it at $5 a month, which is half the price of the regular subscription. \nLaunched earlier this year , the good news for students around the world is that Apple has expanded the student pricing to 25 new countries. As of today, the student pricing will now be available in countries such as Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, Chile, Colombia, Finland, France, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, Norway, Russia, Switzerland, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Thailand, and the United Arab Emirates. \nPrior to this, the pricing was available to students in the United States, Australia, Denmark, Germany, Ireland, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom, which brings the total number of countries supporting the student pricing to 32. Of course it won’t be $5 for all the countries as it will vary depending on the local currency. For example over in France, it is priced at 5 euro. \nNote that this pricing isn’t forever. Users will need to continue prove via UNiDAYS that they are a student, and those who have had accounted for 48 months will automatically be switched over to the regular price. \nFiled in Apple > Audio .

      "text": "(PRLeap.com) November 30, 2016 – Many of the largest “new economy” companies (Apple, Google, etc.) are noted for their ability to adapt quickly to changing marketplace trends. As noted in The Economist (Dec. 2015), Apple sells through its inventories every four days and introduces a new product every four weeks, Facebook updates its software in real time, and fashion retailer Zara designs 40,000 new products a year and ships them to stores twice per week, creating an environment of constant change. Trying to keep pace with the speed of change in the current economy challenges all businesses, including adult education.\nTo help it stay in tune with emerging trends in the business world, Western Continuing Studies (WCS) has partnered with Procept Associates Ltd., Canada’s oldest and largest provider of project management and business analysis training.\n“As one of Canada’s leading universities, we take pride in providing top-quality programming using the best instructors. Partnering with Procept, we can ensure that our programming evolves with the changing marketplace needs and that we can bring highly-experienced instructors who are at the top of their professions,” says Christine Wilton, Program Manager for Western Continuing Studies. “My role involves creating and implementing a strategy that helps us enrich and transform the lives of our diverse audience of adult learners in this rapidly-changing world. We believe that Procept’s exceptional instructors and industry-leading courses will help us meet our strategic goals.”\nWith over 200 classroom and online courses in its catalogue, Procept offers courses ranging from beginner to advanced levels in many fields. Under this new partnership, Procept will be offering several of its project management, business analysis and agile courses through WCS.\nCarlo Barrettara, Procept’s president, supports the partnership, stating “We are delighted to expand our network of university partners in Canada and the USA to include Western, Canada’s leading university. We are pleased that Western Continuing Studies decided that Procept met its high standards of excellence.”\nWilton continues: “As industry standards change and business practices evolve, courses quickly become outdated. Procept’s ongoing investments in updating existing courses and developing new courses to address emerging trends frees Western Continuing Studies from having to do so ourselves. This frees up resources we can devote to other programme areas and towards maintaining our culture of customer service excellence.”\nThe first course of many under the partnership will run at the WCS downtown London campus starting January 25, 2017. The course, Certified Agile Project Manager, will be delivered by Kevin Aguanno, Canada’s leading agile expert and author of over 30 books and DVDs. At the completion of the three-day course, students will write the Certified Agile Project Manager exam from the Project Management Association of Canada (PMAC-AGPC.ca).

      "text": "0 Comments Android and Apple operating systems have been the two major players in the field of mobile app development. It has been years that they have been competing with each other to hold the top spot and in this race for the top position, App store and Google play has been on the highlight. As per the analytical report published last quarter, highlighting the performance of 3 million apps belonging to big players like iOS, Android and Window phone platform , has some major revelations to make. ​ Hire Mobile Application Development Company - Get a Quote   One of the most prominent finding reveals that Google's Play store has excelled Apple's App store in terms of downloads. The increment has been achieved by a massive figure of 60% more downloads in comparison to Apple's App store. One fact that is very important to be considered is larger market share that Android operating system have around the globe. This is mainly because of the wide variety of devices that Android operating system supports and a large part of the growth that Google Play is experiencing is due to the position that it holds in the emerging markets. The first name that comes to my mind referring to emerging market of mobile app development is India . Google Play holds the third position in term of App download. The next factor that has added to the success of Google Play is the low-cost devices associated with Android. In contrast Apple supports the iOS devices at premium cost. In-spite of the lead that Google Play holds over App Store in terms of downloads, it is Apple's App store which leads in the amount of revenue generation. As per the report generated for the second quarter of 2014, App Store had generated 80% more revenue in comparison to Google Play. Half of the revenue generated by apple's App store comes from USA, Japan and China . Mobile app developers who choose a single platform for release of their mobile apps has to choose between number of downloads and revenue generation. When we speak about the iOS growth in terms of revenue, China is the best example. Apple has experienced a huge growth in china, since the time they started dealing with China Mobile. China has got huge opportunity for the growth of mobile apps, but you will have to successfully deal with the issues related to localization. Apple has seen a 20% growth compared to the first quarter of 2014. As per the industry experts in mobile app development , the phrase that “west is best” for conducting business has been proved totally wrong in case of Google and Apple. This is supported by the fact that Google and Apple have grown due to their hold in emerging Smartphone markets like India and China. India can serve as the most exiting market for these biggies, as only 10% of the population in India is Smartphone enabled. This gives a huge opportunity for companies like Apple and Google to extend their mobile app development base in India and grow both in terms of downloads and revenue. India could be the best market for the Google Play download, Smartphone adoption and rapid generation of revenue for mobile apps by the end of year 2017. The most recent example is the increase in the market share of sports category with the ongoing ICC world cup 2015. Countries like India, England, Australia, South Africa, etc have witnessed a steep growth in the number of sports apps being downloaded, just by the beginning of the cricket world cup. 2016 is bringing exciting time for mobile application development companies worldwide.",

      "text": "By Andy Weir Senior News Editor Neowin LLC @gcaweir · 2 seconds ago \nLast month, Apple unveiled its new MacBook Pro laptops , some of which feature a distinctive touch-sensitive display just above the keyboard. Apple said that they had quickly become its fastest-selling MacBook Pro devices ever , and many companies have already updated their software to support the Touch Bar on the new notebooks. \nBut with the arrival of its latest devices, it appears that Apple is now preparing to end support for some of its older Macs. \nAccording to MacRumors , referring to an internal Apple memo, the company will classify four Mac devices as 'obsolete' or 'vintage' on December 31, 2016: MacBook Pro 15-inch (early 2011 model) MacBook Pro 17-inch (early 2011) MacBook 13-inch (mid 2009) Mac mini (early 2009) \nThis would mean that those devices would no longer be eligible for service at Apple and its authorized service providers, with the company also bringing an end to its provision of replacement parts. There are two exceptions, though: in Turkey and California, local legislation requires companies to offer an extended period of support, so Apple is expected to continue providing repairs and documentation there for those devices until December 31, 2018.",

      "text": "Reddit \nApple announced at WWDC in June that Apple Pay would be coming to Spain at some point this year, and Spanish site Applesfera is reporting that the service will launch tomorrow for Banco Santander customers. The mobile payment system Apple Pay will definitely come to Spain this Thursday, December 1, for Banco Santander customers. Several sources have confirmed to Applesfera that – barring any last-minute changes – the rollout date will be tomorrow … \nThe site implies that its sources are within the bank, rather than Apple. Other Spanish banks are expected to support the service at a later date. \nApple Pay is currently available in 12 countries: Australia, Canada, China, France, Hong Kong, Japan, New Zealand, Russia, Singapore, Switzerland, the UK and USA. Of the countries Apple had said would get Apple Pay this year, Spain is the last. \nThe rollout hit a snag in Australia, when a number of banks demanded access to the NFC for their own apps in the hope that they could bypass Apple Pay. The banks needed permission from the local antitrust authority to collectively negotiate with Apple, and it appears that this request is about to be refused . \nThe latest platform to support Apple Pay is of course the 2016 MacBook Pro , whose Touch ID button can be used to authorize Apple Pay transactions online.

      "text": "iPhone 8 Dreaming in Full Swing Print Email By John P. Mello Jr.\nNov 29, 2016 3:21 PM PT Apple's latest iPhone was barely out of the gate when rumors began percolating about the company's next new phone.\nAlthough the iPhone 7 garnered mostly tepid reviews when it was released this summer, initial inventories sold out quickly, and the company had to scramble to meet demand.\nThat demand may have peaked, though, which may be why chasers of the next big thing are looking down the road.\n\"You can rest assured that next year being the 10th anniversary of the original iPhone, Apple will come out with something special,\" said Wayne Lam, principal analyst for telecom electronics at IHS Markit .\n\"Whether it's a completely new 10th anniversary model in conjunction with the regular iteration model of the iPhone 7, we'll have to find out -- but most likely, there will be drastic design innovation coming with the iPhones in 2017,\" he told TechNewsWorld.\n\"Historically, Apple likes to make a big deal out of decade-length anniversaries,\" observed Charles King, principal analyst at Pund-IT .\n\"Since 2017 marks the 10th anniversary of the iPhone, it's easy to assume the company will use the opportunity to prove that it hasn't lost a step, and continues to lead the industry in both design sophistication and delivering value to its customers,\" he told TechNewsWorld.\nBlock of Glass and Aluminum Anticipation for the next model may be higher because the iPhone 7 failed to tick off many items on the wish lists of Apple fans.\n\"My impression is they were holding back on the 7, so they could make a whiz-bang splash on the 10th anniversary,\" said David McQueen, a research director at ABI Research .\nThe next iPhone will be Apple's vision of the smartphone of the future, he added.\n\"Long term, what the iPhone will be is a block of glass and aluminum with as few buttons, bumps and holes as it can have,\" McQueen told TechNewsWorld.\nApple may be taking a step toward that phone of the future with the display rumored for the next iPhone. It reportedly will be an OLED display that will occupy most of the front of the phone -- or all of it, by wrapping over its sides.\nThe OLED part of that rumor is a solid bet, maintained IHS' Lam.\n\"Apple's move to OLED display is all but assured through our supply-side intelligence,\" he said. \"This opens up lots of design possibilities for them on next year's groundbreaking iPhone design.\"\nEdge-to-Edge Screen OLED screens have better contrast, brightness and deeper blacks than LCD displays, and they're also more flexible, which would allow Apple to create a curved phone with an edge-to-edge screen.\n\"I find the edge-to-edge display most credible,\" Patrick Moorhead, principal analyst at Moor Insights and Strategy, told TechNewsWorld.\nEmbracing OLED technology will help Apple keep pace with its competitors.\n\"Samsung has been doing curved OLED screens for years, so it's not a cutting-edge phenomenon by any stretch of the imagination,\" noted Bob O'Donnell, chief analyst at Technalysis Research .\n\"This is Apple just playing catch-up to other people,\" he told TechNewsWorld.\nThe beauty of the edge-to-edge screen is not expected to be marred by a home button or fingerprint reader. Both will be built into the screen itself, rumor has it.\n\"I'm particularly intrigued by the idea of a display-enabled fingerprint reader,\" Pund-IT's King said. \"That could simplify both the phone design and authentication processes.\"\nGlass Body Some Apple watchers, including widely respected analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities, believe there will be three iPhone models: two conventional models with 4.7- and 5.5-inch displays, and one with an edge-to-edge rounded screen.\nAll of the units will have glass bodies to facilitate wireless charging.\nApple's wireless charging is expected to be truly wireless. Existing wireless chargers require a phone to be placed on the charger. Apple's charger will charge a phone through the air for short distances.\n\"Wireless charging that requires no contact would be a technology innovation,\" Technalysis' O'Donnell said.\nThere are some drawbacks to charging devices through the air, he added. It's very inefficient, so it's not the greenest way to charge a phone.\nThen there are possible safety issues.\n\"Power signals flying through the air could freak people out,\" O'Donnell said.\nNeed for a Home Run Many of the rumors about the next iPhone may be unfounded, suggested Kevin Krewell, a principal analyst at Tirias Research .\n\"The iPhone 8 rumors are all over the place,\" he told TechNewsWorld.\nThe phone seems to have every item from everyone's wish lists.\n\"It's likely two or maybe three of these ideas will come to pass in the next iPhone, but none of them are groundbreaking innovations,\" Krewell pointed out.\n\"They're all very nice enhancements and will keep Apple's iPhone competitive with phones from other vendors,\" he added.\nHowever, that may not be what the company needs with the next iPhone.\n\"With sales slipping and margins reportedly under pressure, it's important for Apple to come out swinging with the iPhone 8. The company needs to prove that it's still an elemental force in mobile innovation -- not just one of many companies delivering quality products,\" noted Pund-IT's King.\n\"Apple is so profitable and so deeply embedded with millions of customers that the company could survive and even thrive if the iPhone 8 fails in the marketplace,\" he added, \"but the same might not be true of company executives tied to the new device. If the iPhone 8 fails to hit a home run, any number of execs could be headed for the showers.\"",

      "text": "By Michael Firth Neowin LLC @techfirth · 2 seconds ago with 0 comments \nApple contacted its Authorized Service Providers in September to extend its Exchange and Repair Program in relation to a known fault affecting some iMac devices. \nThe fault, which renders the hinge 'floppy', after a cracking or snapping sound, originates from the use of two plastic washers in the hinge design which are apparently not strong enough to take the weight of the iMac. \nThe issue affects certain 27\" models that were shipped between December 2012 and July 2014. The issue has been well reported on Apple's community forums. \nIn recognition of the issue, Apple has extended its repair program to five years from the date of purchase. There will be no charge for repairs. \nUnlike other Apple Exchange and Repair Programs, there's no website for getting in touch regarding this specific issue, but customers can arrange the free repair by contacting Apple support in the normal way and verifying that their device is one of the defective units. \nCrucially, if you've already experienced the problem and paid for a repair, Apple will refund you the cost of the repair as part of the same Exchange and Repair Program.",

Democrats are furious that Americans rejected their criminal, unethical, boring and fainting far left candidate. \nAnd they are OUTRAGED that they do not control the flow of information anymore thanks to the internet, Facebook, Twitter, and talk radio. \nSo rather than win on ideas they have decided to purge the conservative websites from the marketplace of ideas. \nThe Apple store removed Breitbart.com from their App store recently. If you do a search on Breitbart or BreitbartNews this is what you get. \nTheyve removed it. Breitbart had 45 million monthly readers last month.

      "text": "Reddit \nIn the earnings call following Apple’s Q4 2016 financial results , UBS managing director Steven Milunovich asked CEO Tim Cook a rather pointed question: ‘Does Apple has a grand strategy for what it wants to do over next 3-5 years? Or does it react to the market then decide?’ \nCook was widely felt to be uncomfortable with the question, and Milunovich has now explained why he asked it, and how well prepared he thinks Apple is for the future … \nCook’s answer was brief, and somewhat contradictory, talking at once about being confident in its direction and at the same time arguing that it’s able to adapt as needed. We have the strongest pipeline we’ve ever had and we’re very confident about what’s it, but we won’t talk about what’s in it. We have a strong sense of where things go and we’re very agile and able to shift where people need to. \nMilunovich told Business Insider that Apple has historically had a clear strategy, but he’s not sure that its current approach is as clear. In particular, he referenced a Harvard Business School term known as ‘jobs theory.’ This refers to jobs that people want to get done rather than Steve Jobs, but he says that Steve was very good at taking this approach. \nCoined by Clay Christensen, the phrase essentially argues that Starbucks might think it’s in the business of selling coffee, but the job many of its customers want it to do is provide a meeting place for friends or a temporary office. Companies need to think not about products, but what jobs customers want to get done. So in terms of applying this to Apple, there’s a number of factors, one is that in jobs theory the focus is on the customer experience in a broad sense, and that’s Apple. Steve Jobs, of course, talked about the company being the intersection of liberal arts and technology […] I don’t think they necessarily adhere to the theory per se . I think it is what they do internally. They ask themselves, “what is it I don’t like about my phone?” I remember when Steve Jobs brought out the original iPhone. He talked a lot about the drawbacks of the current phone, and we’d like it to do this, that, and the other. Apple solved those problems and it turned out to be an innovative job to be done. \nHe argues that it’s currently unclear whether Apple still takes this approach now. We don’t know if Apple has figured out what the next jobs to be done are. But my sense in talking to them is they’ve at least identified the places they want to innovate — home automation; healthcare; and they don’t talk about it but I guess automotive; AR and VR which they do talk about, particularly augmented reality. \nThe first new product category since Steve was the Apple Watch , and it is, he suggests, questionable how much of that thinking was based on a clear identification of the job to be done. They introduced a number of jobs to be done, including some that you alluded to in terms of not needing to pull out the phone just to get notifications. They talked a lot about notifications, sending cards to friends and so forth. And it took a year or two to see there didn’t seem to be a whole lot of demand for that job. Some of the applications turned out to be not early but just wrong in terms of expectations of use. \nThe company has, he said, now pivoted very much to presenting the Watch very much as a health and fitness device – essentially giving it a different job to do. \nWith concern that Jony Ive and his team may be heading toward retirement at roughly the same time, Milunovich gives Cook credit for being great at keeping the company’s core culture alive. This is where Apple University may play a role. Because Apple University allows them to continue the culture and principles that he put in place. And I think Tim Cook is a fantastic culture bearer. Jony Ive is, and hopefully the Apple University formalises some of these things as well. \nThe full interview is a worthwhile read. Guides",

      "text": "Lurking somewhere behind the booming smartphone segment is an active ‘seconds’ market. And, hasn’t it always been there?\nGo back by a decade, and most of us will remember walking into a local mobile store, and exchanging our older phone for a new/used shiny device. In the last couple of years, the e-commerce space has tried to emulate the same online, with a push given especially by premium brands like Apple and Samsung, often with their full page advertisements persuading consumers to exchange older devices. And, there are many online players helping ecommerce companies and others achieve just that. There is an entire ecosystem for the seconds market like Quikr, OLX and Ebay, and one such is Cashify.\nCashify is basically involved in disposing off your old electronics through an online/app journey that includes doorstep pickup service, and also instant payment of your choice. Fort doing so it has teamed up with some of the major online as well as offline players including Snapdeal, Amazon, eBay, Croma, Google and HP, among others. CEO, Mandeep Manocha tells us that, “ Cashify has build custom software interface and embedded these in many such e-commerce players enabling them to offer exchange as a sales promotion to their customers from an affordability perspective.”\nCashify is now out with its internal research report showing the peculiar pattern of the exchange market conducted over a sample size of 90,000 users (in the period August to October). To begin with, it says 40 used smartphones are being traded in the second hand smartphone market for every 100 new smartphones. And, the average selling price of 70 percent of the phones sold were in the range of Rs 4,000 to Rs 6,000.\nThe report shows a massive growth in buyback in the month of October, which could be possibly owing to the festive season. But, the number of unique models traded online were higher in August compared to October.\nImage: Tech2 Data source: Cashify\nImage: Tech2 Data source: Cashify\nAnd, only 7-8 percent of all devices traded are above Rs 18,000 in value, and this constitutes mainly of iPhones and some high end Samsung devices. However, Manocha explains the demand may be dynamic but the brand perception remains largely unchanged. That pretty much explains why the iPhone shows the slowest depreciation rate. However, when it comes to exchange of devices, Samsung leads by a good margin. The reason is simple Samsung release phones on varying price point and is still the seasoned OEM that has been conveniently filling the gap left by Nokia. Then, we also have the likes of Chinese vendors such as Xiaomi and OnePlus, among others who have managed to become a part of the market.\nIn terms of the brand share, 65 percent share in the second hand smartphone market has been captured by four brands – Samsung, Apple, Motorola and Micromax.\nImage: Tech2 Data source: Cashify\n“Brands like OnePlus and Xiaomi and Lenovo have significantly added to the secondhand market options both in terms of price-points and device variety, as they have to the new device market. The market acceptance of such brands has further driven their second hand demand,” he added.\nImage: Tech2 Data source: Cashify\nHe also points out a significantly lower refresh cycle for low priced second-hand devices “With the entry of an array of low priced devices that have captured large market share has seen a fair number of such phones further entering the second hand market. Such devices will not only have a lower first refresh cycle but an even lower second refresh cycle. So customers buying low priced second-hand phones would find themselves needing to replace their device much sooner than expected. A secondhand customer who would have ideally come back to the market for another second hand device in a 6 to 11 months is now back in 3 to 6 months. This keeps the demand going,” he said.\nCashify survey also reveals that Delhi saw the maximum second-hand phone sale, followed by Bangalore and Mumbai.\nThe post Samsung, Apple, Motorola and Micromax make 65 percent of the second hand market in India: Cashify survey appeared first on Tech2 .",

      "text": "Facebook is considering opening a new office in Cork, Ireland, according to the Irish Examiner . \nThe office in question is located in the centre of Cork City on the top floor of a new €50 million (£43 million) property built by local developer JCD (John Cleary Developments). The building is due to be finished in early 2017. \nThe report in the Examiner comes less than two months after Facebook acquired Cork VR startup InfiniLED through subsidiary company Oculus. \nInfinLED has developed low-energy LED technology that has the potential to make VR headsets such as those made by Oculus lighter and more energy efficient. \nIt's likely that those working on the InfiniLED team would move into the new office should Facebook move into it. \nFacebook employs around 15,000 people worldwide, including 1,800 in an office in Dublin, according to The Irish Examiner. The company is also in the process of building a €200 million (£171 million) data centre in Clonee , Ireland. \nFacebook is reportedly looking at taking the top floor on the €50m Capitol retail and office complex. JCD \nCork, situated about a three hour drive from Dublin, Ireland's capital, is already home to Apple's European headquarters, as well as offices belonging to other US tech giants like IBM and EMC. \nApple employs around 5,000 people across two main sites in Cork, with one in the city centre and the other on a campus just outside. \nIt's possible that Facebook would compete with Apple and other tech companies in the city for talent. \nFacebook did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment.",

Apple has also announced the addition of four new special edition products to its (RED) line-up … The 20 participating games include Angry Birds 2, Angry Birds POP!, Best Fiends, Best Fiends Forever, Boom Beach, Candy Crush Jelly Saga, Clash of Clans, Clash Royale, CSR2, Episode, Farm Heroes Saga, FarmVille: Tropic Escape, FIFA Mobile, Hay Day, MARVEL Contest of Champions, PewDiePie’s Tuber Simulator, Plants vs. Zombies Heroes, SimCity BuildIt, War Dragons and YAHTZEE With Buddies. The new products added this year are an iPhone 7 Smart Battery Case, iPhone SE Case, Beats Solo 3 Wireless On-Ear Headphones and the Pill+ Portable Speaker – all of which are available from today. More than 400 Apple Stores will feature red logos or decals, and the company will donate $1 to (RED) for every purchase made with Apple Pay at its retail and online stores, up to a total of $1M. Bank of America is also chipping in a donation for every Apple Pay transaction using its cards, also up to $1 million. Finally, for those into holiday music, there’s a special iTunes album. The Killers’ holiday album, Don’t Waste Your Wishes, is exclusively available on iTunes featuring all 10 of their holiday singles, as well as a new track, “I’ll Be Home for Christmas,” with 100 percent of the proceeds in the US going to the Global Fund. Apple has raised more than $350M for (RED) over the past decade. Guides",

      "text": "Apple has confirmed that iTunes Connect will be closed over the holidays. Developers will not be able to submit new apps or updates between December 23 and December 27, but other iTunes Connect and developer account features will remain available during this time.\nApple always closes iTunes Connect over the holidays, so this is nothing new. By giving developers plenty of notice, it gives them the chance to get new apps into the App Store and update existing ones in advance so they’re ready for the holiday rush.\n“The busiest season on the App Store is almost here. Make sure your apps are up-to-date and ready for the winter holidays,” Apple says. “New apps and app updates will not be accepted December 23 to 27 (Pacific Time), so any releases should be submitted, approved, and scheduled in advance.”\nApple doesn’t specify how much time it will need to approve new submissions, so to be safe, you’ll need to get your app in as quickly as possible. Submissions made close to December 23 almost certainly won’t be approved before iTunes Connect goes down.\nApp Store downloads reach new highs over the Christmas period as customers look to get their hands on as much content as possible for the iPhones, iPads, and iPods that were delivered by Santa. If you’re a developer, you definitely don’t want to miss out.\n\n\nSource : Apple ",

Post to Facebook Apple's Tim Cook talks corporate 'values' and company's expanded (RED) intiative Apple CEO Tim Cook tells USA TODAY that \"corporations should have values, because people have values,\" as he announces expanded (RED) initiative to help those suffering from HIV/AIDS.  //usat.ly/2gJtwGV   Join the Nation's Conversation To   Apple's Tim Cook talks corporate 'values' and company's expanded (RED) intiative Marco della Cava , USA TODAY 8:01   x Share Predictions are out for the next iPhone and it's shaping up to be so new that it'll break sales records. Time Apple CEO Tim Cook tells USA TODAY that corporations much have values, \"because people have values, and corporations are just a bunch of people.\" Apple is ramping up its (RED) offerings this year, aiming to funnel more money to the HIV/AIDS organization founded by US singer Bono. (Photo: RIchard Drew, AP) \nCUPERTINO, Calif. — Apple CEO Tim Cook rocks in his chair as he meets the question with an unyielding gaze. \n\"Of course corporations should have values, because people should have values,\" says the soft-spoken tech leader, who has been vocal on a range of civic issues, from gay rights to privacy rules. \"And corporations are just a bunch of people.\" \nCook met with USA TODAY to discuss the company's expanded corporate partnership with (RED), the 20-person organization founded by U2 singer Bono that has had an outsized impact on those suffering from HIV/AIDS by providing life-saving medicines. \nBeginning Wednesday, which in Australia marks December 1's World AIDS Day, Apple will festoon 400 stores, a fourfold increase from last year, with (RED) signage, while expanding the number of products, games and apps whose purchases channel an undisclosed percentage of their sales price to the organization. \nAmong the new (RED) products are an iPhone 7 battery pack case and Beats Solo 3 Wireless headphones. Nearly two dozen games such as Angry Birds and Clash of Clans will donate all proceeds from in-app purchases. And for every item bought at an Apple Store using Apple Pay, the company will donate $1 to (RED), up to $1 million. Bank of America will match that donation when its cards are used in an Apple Pay transaction. Report: Apple could launch curved iPhone next year \nThose who buy a new album by The Killers, Don't Waste Your Wishes , on iTunes will see the entire purchase go to (RED), while anyone wanting to know more about the battle against AIDS can avail themselves of a free download of Spike Jonze's 2010 documentary The Lazarus Effect . \n\"Whether you want to donate or just learn about the issue, we wanted there to be something for everyone,\" says Cook. \nSo far, (RED) has impacted the lives of 70 million HIV/AIDS sufferers, says (RED) CEO Deb Dugan. \n\"It takes just 30 cents a day to keep someone alive,\" says Dugan, who also joined the conversation at Apple's headquarters. It ranged from talk about eradicating the global AIDS epidemic by 2030 to the need for companies to use their platforms to create social issue awareness. \nApple's Beats headphones are just some of the (RED) branded products now available to consumers, a portion of whose purchase price goes to the organization that is helping provide medication for those living with HIV/AIDS. (Photo: Apple) \n\"We put our weight behind lots of things in the civil rights area,\" says Cook. \"Similarly, I think it's key that people think about what they stand for and help their communities. We always say that we want to leave the world better than we found it. So, we try to thoughtfully decide how we can do that.\" \nThat sort of C-suite level initiative on social matters may be necessary as a new administration gets ready to take office in January. Libertarian eBay cofounder Peter Thiel aside, many tech titans supported president-elect Donald Trump's rival Hillary Clinton, and they're now anxiously awaiting word on how Trump and his appointees will treat the lucrative if often left-leaning industry. \nCook was among those tech CEOs favoring Clinton, and according to a trove of emails uncovered by Wikileaks he was in the running as a possible vice presidential pick before Tim Kaine got the nod. \nA new iPhone 7 cover in (RED) red is one of the various hardware and software items whose purchase partly goes to benefit the HIV/AIDS relief organization's efforts. (Photo: Apple) \nWhile campaigning, Trump repeatedly said he would force companies such as Apple to build their products in the United States. A report in Nikkei Asian Review last week cited unnamed sources saying Apple had asked two of its biggest Chinese suppliers about the impact of moving their manufacturing to the U.S. Apple would not comment. Most industry observers believe such a move would drastically increase the cost of Apple's products. \nBut manufacturing issues aren't the greatest concern for Kevin Frost, CEO of amFAR, the American Foundation for AIDS Research, which was born at the height of the 1980s crisis when the disease first emerged. \n\"Looking at the funding and policy positions of the new administration, to say I'm concerned is an understatement, I'm practically despondent,\" says Frost. \"Our hope is that corporate America will step into the vacuum of leadership on this and other public health issues.\" \nFrost says at worst, a lack of government support for both HIV/AIDS research and relief efforts such as PEPFAR (the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief) could erase the possibility of vanquishing the disease by 2030. Apple's Cook: More potential in AR than VR \n\"AIDS in the U.S. is a manageable disease, but elsewhere millions still die, which is why organizations like (RED) and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation are so important,\" he says. \"On some level, I'm envious of what (RED) has done, and it's down in part to partnering with juggernauts such as Apple.\" \nWhen (RED) debuted in 2006, Apple funneled some of the proceeds from a red iPod Nano to the organization, which at the time was trying to reduce the number of babies around the world — 1,200 a day — born with the HIV virus. \nOver the past decade, Apple grew the scope of its (RED)-branded hardware and software offerings. To date, proceeds gathered by the sale of Apple products account for one-third of (RED)'s $360 million haul since its inception. Today, some 400 babies are born daily with HIV. \nDeb Dugan, CEO of (RED), which has raised $360 million since its inception in 2006, a third of which has come through its decade-long partnership with Apple. (Photo: Ilya S. Savenok, Getty Images for PTTOW!) \n\"The stakes are still high, 37 million people still have HIV/AIDS,\" says Dugan. \"If you look at the globe, it's still a modern-day plague. But it's preventable and it could disappear in our lifetime. Our most immediate goal is to eradicate mother-to-child transmission by 2020, most of which is in Africa.\" \nCook leans forward and leans his elbows on the conference room table: \"Your education shouldn't depend on your zip code, and similarly your ability to live past your first birthday shouldn't depend on where you're born.\" \nCook, who took over from the late Steve Jobs in 2011, hasn't been shy about confronting pressing issues of the day. \nHe was front and center in defying government-led efforts to unlock an iPhone that was owned by one of the San Bernardino killers. And perhaps not surprisingly, Cook, who is gay, has been particularly visible on LBGTQ rights issues, coming forward to denounce Indiana and Arkansas state laws that were viewed as discriminatory. Trump adviser Peter Thiel is on Silicon Valley speed dial \nSome critics contend that Cook's stance domestically rings hollow when being gay is illegal in about a fifth of the 100-plus countries Apple does business in. And others suggest that taking such a stand helps boost sales with like-minded consumers, especially tech-hungry Millennials who gravitate toward companies that take a position on issues they value. \nCook shrugs off such talk. \n\"We'll always help the most people through our products, because they empower people to do great things themselves,\" he says. \"But this (RED) partnership allows us to touch a group of people we normally wouldn't. Sub-Saharan Africa is not a big marketplace for us. This is about trying to lift people up.\" \nMight Apple — one of the best known brands on the planet with a market value of nearly $600 billion, a third of which is holds in cash — use its considerable consumer muscle to tackle new social issues in the coming year? Cook suggests that his company may well become as known for its stands on matters of societal importance as its popular technology gadgets. \n\"We haven't shied away from being visible on a number of topics, and if it's something in our wheelhouse, we'll always be visible and stand up to protect as well as advance people's rights,\" he says. \"Every generation has a responsibility of expanding the definition of those rights, to move forward. So we'll very much continue to do that.\" \nFollow USA TODAY tech reporter Marco della Cava on Twitter. 1 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE",

      "text": "Apple charges $25 for a 3-foot Lightning cable to charge your iPhone or iPad, or to connect them to a computer. Twenty... five... dollars. We don't know exactly how much Apple's little white Lightning to USB cables cost to make, but we would wager that it's somewhere in the ballpark of 5% to 10% of that selling price. Apple's cables are nice and all, but that's a heck of a markup for something as simple as a cable.\nHere's another option: Pick up a 3- foot  AmazonBasics Apple Certified Lightning to USB Cable for $6.49 instead.\nContinue reading... \nTrending right now: \nAll of the new features the Android 7.0 Nougat update will bring to the Galaxy S7 What it takes to get a NES Classic Leak reveals another key Galaxy S8 feature that has never been seen before on an iPhone ",

      "text": "Smartphone manufacturer Apple on Tuesday expanded Apple Music student membership eligibility to include more than 30 markets. This is along and with the latest round of additions extending the subscription tier to countries like Canada, China, India and more countries all over the world.\nAdvertisement Launched and introduced in the month of May , the cut-rate Apple Music student membership program tier was initially restricted and prohibited to users in the areas and countries of Australia, Denmark, Germany, Ireland, New Zealand, the UK and the U.S. Today's additions bring Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, Chile, Colombia, Finland, France, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, Norway, Russia, Switzerland, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Thailand, and the United Arab Emirates into the fold.\nApple is once again working with UNiDAYS to verify student enrollment, which must be maintained to retain the special Apple Music pricing. Alternatively, the report notes students in Canada and other locales can directly verify eligibility by signing up for Apple Music through their campus Wi-Fi network or by using a school email address.\nAs with the initial rollout, the existing Apple Music subscribers can transfer their individual account to a student account via iTunes or the Music app on iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, Mac, PC or Android.\n Expanded student membership availability arrives on the heels of rumors that Apple might drop regular subscription fees by 20 percent in a bid to compete with rival streaming services like Amazon's Music Unlimited. The potential price cut was due to arrive in time for the holidays, but with less than a month left until Christmas, that launch time window is becoming increasingly unlikely.\nAs of today, college and university students in Canada and 24 other countries can access Apple Music content at a discounted rate for up to 48 months\n More Than 30 Regions Can Now Avail Apple's Music Student Membership BAC Stock In Position As the Best In The Sector RE/MAX LLC OKs 3 Independent Regions Purchase Foreclosure Shocks Region Buildings Owners Snow Cover Sand Over Saudi Arabia Regions Advertisement",

      "title": "Apple's Bootcamp audio driver can permanently damage the speakers on the new MacBook Pro",
      "text": "For the past 11 years, Apple has offered formal support for installing Windows on a Macintosh running OS X via its Boot Camp Assistant software. If you need Windows on a Macintosh and don’t want to use virtualization software to run it, Boot Camp will resize your hard drive partition to create a new Windows volume and ships with its own set of drivers for your underlying hardware. Apple tends to aggressively prune support for older operating systems — Boot Camp 6.1, which shipped with macOS 10.12 (Sierra), only supports Windows 10 — but Cupertino’s QA team clearly screwed up its compatibility testing, even with just one operating system to evaluate. Multiple customers who purchased one of Apple’s new MacBook Pros are reporting that the default Boot Camp audio driver can permanently damage the system’s speakers.\nThe initial report came courtesy of Mac user Tommy9695 who writes : “Just a heads up, there’s a known speaker issue with the new Mbp in Bootcamp… Most people are hearing random loud “pops” in windows, which happened to me even when the speakers were muted. This resulted in both speakers being blown.” Multiple MBP owners on Reddit and other Mac sites have confirmed they are having problems as well, with severe sound distortion above ~50% volume. In some cases, the speakers are physically damaged in the process, and Apple stores don’t seem to be equipped to do this kind of repair on-site just yet. Tommy9695 had to order a new laptop from Apple and ship the old one back with an estimated 30-day turnaround due to extended lead times on all Touch Bar-equipped MacBook Pros (The non-Touch Bar-equipped system can ship out this week, but the other systems have a 3-4 week back log). Some users appear to be seeing damage almost instantly upon booting into Windows and playing any sound, even simple system sound effects.\nThe new MacBook Pro’s speaker assembly. Image and teardown by iFixit.\nApple has apparently pushed an updated driver to Boot Camp already, but this will only help if you’ve installed your Windows partition in the last few days. Some users have also reported that installing an unofficial Realtek driver (6.0.1.7989) can resolve the issue. The third way to address the problem is to plug a pair of earbuds or headphones into the headphone jack (good thing Apple didn’t have the courage to remove it). This will bypass speaker output altogether and avoid the problem.\nIf you’re using Boot Camp on a new MBP we strongly recommend updating your audio driver, reinstalling the OS with an updated official Apple driver, or at least relying on earbuds until you can address the problem. With a 3-4 week lead time on system replacements, this would be a lousy reason to be stuck waiting for a computer, and the holiday season isn’t going to help Apple hit its shipment targets. This is the latest issue for the new MacBook Pro, which has already taken a great deal of heat for its dongle-happy architecture and even-more-ridiculous pricing . It’s not clear whose fault this problem is — I’ve owned and tested many Realtek audio solutions over the years and never seen this kind of problem from a driver, and if the problem was widespread across Windows we’d see systems from companies like Lenovo, Dell, and HP Inc failing left and right.",

The building is due to be finished in early 2017. \nThe report in the Examiner comes less than two months after Facebook acquired Cork VR startup InfiniLED through subsidiary company Oculus. \nInfinLED has developed low-energy LED technology that has the potential to make VR headsets such as those made by Oculus lighter and more energy efficient. \nIt's likely that those working on the InfiniLED team would move into the new office should Facebook move into it. \nFacebook employs around 15,000 people worldwide, including 1,800 in an office in Dublin, according to The Irish Examiner. The company is also in the process of building a €200 million (£171 million) data centre in Clonee , Ireland. \nFacebook is reportedly looking at taking the top floor on the €50m Capitol retail and office complex. JCD \nCork, situated about a three hour drive from Dublin, Ireland's capital, is already home to Apple's European headquarters, as well as offices belonging to other US tech giants like IBM and EMC. \nApple employs around 5,000 people across two main sites in Cork, with one in the city centre and the other on a campus just outside. \nIt's possible that Facebook would compete with Apple and other tech companies in the city for talent. \nFacebook did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment.

      "title": "Tim Cook On Apple's 10th-Anniversary (Red) Campaign Against AIDS",
      "text": "View this image ›\nGetty Images\nID: 10077955 It was 2006 when Apple joined the (Red) campaign, an effort to rally the private sector in the fight against HIV/AIDS. Now, 10 years after it fielded its first (Product) Red device — a special edition iPod nano — Apple has emerged as field marshal of sorts for (Red), using its marketing heft and considerable retail reach to raise awareness about HIV/AIDS as an ongoing global health crisis. In the process, it’s raised from the proceeds of (Red)-branded Apple products more than $120 million of the $360 million (Red) CEO Deborah Dugan says the organization has generated to date. That makes Apple the world’s largest corporate contributor to the Global Fund , a nonprofit partnership dedicated to the eradication of HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis.\n“Part of being a great company is leaving the world better than you found it.”\nID: 10077962 Beginning today, Apple is marking World AIDS Day and the 10th anniversary of its support for (Red) with an expansive campaign that CEO Tim Cook says was “designed to reach people via all the different ways in which a customer might touch us.” That means custom (Red) content on the App Store; up to $1 million in $1 (Red) donations for every Apple Pay purchase made at the Apple Store (online and off); an iTunes-exclusive holiday album from the Killers, the full US proceeds of which will go to the Global Fund; four new additions to Apple’s year-round (Product) Red portfolio, including a pair of Beats Solo3 wireless headphones; and (Red) branding — largely via red-tinted Apple logos — at some 420 Apple Stores across five continents.\nView this image ›\nID: 10077942 For Cook, whose tenure as CEO of Apple has been defined in part by principled stands on human rights and calls for social progress , the company’s ongoing participation in efforts like (Red) is driven by a strongly held belief in corporate social responsibility.\n“My view on this — which I recognize is different from that of some others — is that just as people have values, so too should corporations,” Cook told BuzzFeed News. “One of ours at Apple is the idea that part of being a great company is leaving the world better than you found it.”\nAnd through its involvement in (Red), Apple is working to do just that. According to the World Health Organization, HIV has killed some 35 million people since the epidemic began. But thanks to greater availability of antiretroviral (ARV) medications like those (Red) helps purchase — some 18 million people are currently on ARV medications, largely thanks to (Red) — fewer HIV-positive mothers are passing the virus to their unborn children. “Over 400 kids with HIV are born every day,” Cook said. “That’s down from 1,200 a decade ago, so there’s been significant progress. 400 a day is obviously still 400 too many, but we are on target to have an AIDS-free generation in 2020.”\nApple’s effort on behalf of (Red) is textbook creative capitalism, an estuary of altruism and consumerism that Cook believes dovetails nicely with Apple’s core competencies.\n“We look for ways we think we can uniquely contribute to the world in which we live,” Cook said. “And we’ll always touch more people through our products than anything else. … It’s that area — an area in which we have expertise — where we think we can make a contribution that multiplies well beyond simply writing a check. We want to advocate for human rights in a way that people can look at what we’re doing and say ‘you know, I could be a part of something like that’ — ‘I could do something like that.’ For us this is critically important.”\n“I think we can all agree that the right to live is perhaps the ultimate human right.”\nID: 10077966 The 10th anniversary of Apple’s support of (Red) and its efforts to eradicate HIV/AIDS come amid growing unease over US President-elect Donald Trump’s repeated pledges to repeal the Affordable Care Act upon taking office in January, a move that could herald dire consequences for the uninsured/underinsured persons living with HIV who’ve come to rely on it. Asked if there might be heightened sense of urgency around this year’s (Red) campaign given Trump’s remarks, Cook observed that ridding the planet of preventable disease is a bipartisan issue.\n“I don’t see this as a political issue at all,” Cook said. “This is about people living — it’s about giving people the gift of life. Regardless of people’s political beliefs or backgrounds, I think we can all agree that the right to live is perhaps the ultimate human right.”",

      "text": "Apple's next-gen 4.7-inch iPhone to get wireless charging next year  21   Apple 's next-generation 4.7-inch iPhone will feature glass casing with wireless charging , according to the latest research note from KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, MacRumors reports. \n\"Our rationale is as follows: (1) the OLED model may trigger replacement demand among high-end users given its completely all-new-design form factor and notably superior specs in comparison to the TFT-LCD models; and (2) the new 4.7” iPhone, featuring glass casing and wireless charging, looks well positioned to tap replacement demand at the entry level,\" Kuo said. \nKuo previously said all new iPhones are \"likely\" to support wireless charging next year, so 5.5-inch and all-new OLED models will likely gain the feature as well in addition to the now-confirmed 4.7-inch model. \nKuo believes Apple will switch to glass casing for next year's entire iPhone lineup in order to support wireless charging, with Pegatron being the exclusive supplier of the new 4.7-inch iPhone and a wireless charger expected to be included with at least some models. The wireless charger will allegedly have wider availability by 2018. \nThe new 4.7-inch iPhone and an OLED model featuring a \"completely all-new-design form factor and notably superior specs\" are predicted to drive \"potentially unprecedented replacement demand\" from smartphone users. Kuo forecasts Apple could sell 120-150 million new iPhones in the back half of 2017, topping an iPhone 6 sales record. \nTo our understanding, while demand visibility in 2H17F is as yet unclear and presumed pull-in demand may change anytime, upstream suppliers may be around now setting ramp-up targets for new iPhone pull-in of somewhere between 120mn and 150mn units in 2H17F, exceeding previous iPhone 6, 6s and 7 cycles of 110-120mn, 100-110mn and 90-100mn units, respectively. In other words, ramp-up for 2H17F pull-in may exceed the previous peak for iPhone 6, and hit a historical high. \nApple will presumably announce its next-generation iPhone lineup in September 2017.

      "text": "You are using an outdated browser. Please upgrade your browser to improve your experience. Apple Supports World AIDS Day and (RED) With New Products and App Deals by Bryan M. Wolfe November 30, 2016 \nThursday, Dec. 1 is World AIDS Day. Apple is once again promoting the day by supporting the (RED) campaign by turning store logos red and offering special-edition products. \nTwenty (20) of the most popular games on the App Store are offering exclusive (RED) in-app purchases, the proceeds of which go to the campaign’s Global Fund. Among the games included in this promotion in 2016 are Boom Beach , FIFA Mobile , MARVEL Contest of Champions , and Best Fiends . \nFour new (RED) products are coming online today, Nov. 30, through the Apple website. These include an iPhone 7 Smart Battery Case, iPhone SE Case, Beats Solo 3 Wireless On-Ear Headphones, and the Pill+ Portable Speaker. \nFor more on the Apple (RED) product lineup, click here . \nAlso, The Killers have released a new album, “ Don’t Waste Your Wishes ,” which is exclusively available on iTunes. The $10.99 album features 10 of the band’s previously released holiday singles, plus a new track, “I’ll Be Home for Christmas.” \nAll proceeds from each sale of the album and individual tracks featured will be donated to (RED). The album is available for free for Apple Music subscribers . \nFrom Dec. 1 through Dec. 6, Apple is donating $1 to (RED)’s mission for every purchase made with Apple Pay at an Apple Store, on Apple.com or through the Apple Store app, up to $1 million. Bank of America will also make a donation for every Apple Pay transaction using its cards, also up to $1 million. \nFinally, Apple customers can also donate directly to (RED) through iTunes. In the U.S., iTunes Movies is offering a free download of “ The Lazarus Effect,” the documentary about the mission of (RED). \nThe gift of life is the most important gift that anyone can give. Thanks to the vision and dedication of (RED), an AIDS-free generation is within our reach. We want to leave the world better than we found it, and that’s why our longtime partnership with (RED) remains so important to us. \nApple has raised more than $350 million for (RED) over the past 10 years.

And Apple's legendary mountain of dirt has been drastically reduced, with the earth being spread around the campus for landscaping. \nApple CEO Tim Cook told employees earlier this year that Apple planned to move the first groups into the new \"Spaceship\" campus in January 2017. \nBut the City of Cupertino, where the building will be located, announced last month that the project's completion date had been pushed back to the second quarter of 2017.The dirt pyramid at its peak in February.Youtube/Duncan Sinfield \nAnd Cupertino's engineering inspector, 4Leaf, told the city in September that it believed the project was behind schedule and prepared its own budget through June 2017, according to a document seen by Business Insider. \n\"Although we haven’t been formally notified, we understand that the AC2 project is behind its anticipated 31-month construction schedule,\" 4Leaf wrote. \nBut whether the official move-in date gets pushed back a month or two — no announcement has been made publicly — won't matter to this campus in the long run, which is an symbol of Apple's massive success over the past decade and should stand for years. \nCheck out the video below: About Us",

We want to leave the world better than we found it, and that's why our longtime partnership with (RED) remains so important to us.\"\nThis year, Apple customers can support the fight while playing the games they love, shopping for loved ones ahead of the holiday season or listening to an exclusive (RED) holiday album from The Killers.\nFor the next week, a range of the most popular games across the App Store® — spanning from racing and sports titles to strategy, puzzle and action games — are offering limited-edition, custom (RED) content, exclusively available on the App Store. All proceeds from the associated in-app purchases go to the Global Fund.\nThe 20 participating games include Angry Birds 2, Angry Birds POP!, Best Fiends, Best Fiends Forever, Boom Beach, Candy Crush Jelly Saga, Clash of Clans, Clash Royale, CSR2, Episode, Farm Heroes Saga, FarmVille: Tropic Escape, FIFA Mobile, Hay Day, MARVEL Contest of Champions, PewDiePie's Tuber Simulator, Plants vs. Zombies Heroes, SimCity BuildIt, War Dragons and YAHTZEE With Buddies.\nIn addition to the current (PRODUCT)RED lineup, which is available for customers to purchase year-round, Apple is also adding four new (RED) products including an iPhone® 7 Smart Battery Case, iPhone SE Case, Beats Solo 3 Wireless On-Ear Headphones and the Pill+ Portable Speaker, which are all available today.\nOver 400 Apple Stores on five continents will turn their logos red or feature (RED) window decals to raise visibility for World AIDS Day in Apple's most widespread implementation of support for (RED) at its stores. Apple Store employees will share all the ways our customers can join us in supporting (RED) and the fight against AIDS.\nStarting tomorrow through December 6, Apple is donating $1 to (RED)'s mission for every purchase made with Apple Pay® at an Apple Store®, on Apple.com or through the Apple Store app, up to $1 million. Bank of America will also make a donation for every Apple Pay transaction using its cards, also up to $1 million.\nCustomers around the world can also easily donate directly to (RED) through iTunes®. In the US, iTunes Movies is offering a free download of The Lazarus Effect, the documentary about the mission of (RED).\nThe Killers' holiday album, Don't Waste Your Wishes, is exclusively available on iTunes featuring all 10 of their holiday singles, as well as a new track, \"I'll Be Home for Christmas,\" with 100 percent of the proceeds in the US going to the Global Fund.\nOver the past 10 years, 70 million lives have been impacted by (RED)-supported Global Fund grants. At the start of Apple's partnership with (RED), 1,200 babies were born with HIV every day, and today, UNAIDS predicts that number could be near zero by the year 2020, with the end of AIDS by 2030.\nWith the life-saving medication costing as little as 30 cents a day, every person can make a difference. Through these efforts we'll get that much closer to helping (RED) create an AIDS-free generation.\nApple revolutionized personal technology with the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984. Today, Apple leads the world in innovation with iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch and Apple TV. Apple's four software platforms — iOS, macOS, watchOS and tvOS — provide seamless experiences across all Apple devices and empower people with breakthrough services including the App Store, Apple Music, Apple Pay and iCloud. Apple's more than 100,000 employees are dedicated to making the best products on earth, and to leaving the world better than we found it.\n",

      "text": "\nThis year you can help raise money for the fight against AIDS through Apple Pay, App Store games, new Apple Store products, and more\nApple has been supporting Product (RED), which raises money for the fight against AIDS through a portion of the profits made from (RED) co-branded products, for decade.

We want to advocate for human rights in a way that people can look at what we're doing and say 'you know, I could be a part of something like that' — 'I could do something like that.' For us this is critically important.\"\nDonate to (RED) directly in iTunes:\nDonate (RED). Give life.

Apple is the world's largest corporate contributor to the Global Fund, and this year marks its 10th anniversary supporting (RED) in the fight to end AIDS.\n(RED)'s critical work addresses the disparity in access to life-saving medication in sub-Saharan Africa, which has the highest prevalence of AIDS on the planet. The money raised by (RED) funds programs that offer counseling, testing, prevention and, most crucially, the life-saving ARV medication that prevents the transmission of HIV from mothers to their unborn babies.\n\"The gift of life is the most important gift that anyone can give,\" said Tim Cook, Apple's CEO. \"Thanks to the vision and dedication of (RED), an AIDS-free generation is within our reach. We want to leave the world better than we found it, and that's why our longtime partnership with (RED) remains so important to us.\"\nThis year, Apple customers can support the fight while playing the games they love, shopping for loved ones ahead of the holiday season or listening to an exclusive (RED) holiday album from The Killers.\nFor the next week, a range of the most popular games across the App Store® — spanning from racing and sports titles to strategy, puzzle and action games — are offering limited-edition, custom (RED) content, exclusively available on the App Store. All proceeds from the associated in-app purchases go to the Global Fund.\nThe 20 participating games include Angry Birds 2, Angry Birds POP!, Best Fiends, Best Fiends Forever, Boom Beach, Candy Crush Jelly Saga, Clash of Clans, Clash Royale, CSR2, Episode, Farm Heroes Saga, FarmVille: Tropic Escape, FIFA Mobile, Hay Day, MARVEL Contest of Champions, PewDiePie's Tuber Simulator, Plants vs. Zombies Heroes, SimCity BuildIt, War Dragons and YAHTZEE With Buddies.\nIn addition to the current (PRODUCT)RED lineup, which is available for customers to purchase year-round, Apple is also adding four new (RED) products including an iPhone® 7 Smart Battery Case, iPhone SE Case, Beats Solo 3 Wireless On-Ear Headphones and the Pill+ Portable Speaker, which are all available today.\nOver 400 Apple Stores on five continents will turn their logos red or feature (RED) window decals to raise visibility for World AIDS Day in Apple's most widespread implementation of support for (RED) at its stores. Apple Store employees will share all the ways our customers can join us in supporting (RED) and the fight against AIDS.\nStarting tomorrow through December 6, Apple is donating $1 to (RED)'s mission for every purchase made with Apple Pay® at an Apple Store®, on Apple.com or through the Apple Store app, up to $1 million. Bank of America will also make a donation for every Apple Pay transaction using its cards, also up to $1 million.\nCustomers around the world can also easily donate directly to (RED) through iTunes®. In the US, iTunes Movies is offering a free download of The Lazarus Effect, the documentary about the mission of (RED).\nThe Killers' holiday album, Don't Waste Your Wishes, is exclusively available on iTunes featuring all 10 of their holiday singles, as well as a new track, \"I'll Be Home for Christmas,\" with 100 percent of the proceeds in the US going to the Global Fund.\nOver the past 10 years, 70 million lives have been impacted by (RED)-supported Global Fund grants. At the start of Apple's partnership with (RED), 1,200 babies were born with HIV every day, and today, UNAIDS predicts that number could be near zero by the year 2020, with the end of AIDS by 2030.\nWith the life-saving medication costing as little as 30 cents a day, every person can make a difference. Through these efforts we'll get that much closer to helping (RED) create an AIDS-free generation.\nApple revolutionized personal technology with the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984. Today, Apple leads the world in innovation with iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch and Apple TV. Apple's four software platforms — iOS, macOS, watchOS and tvOS — provide seamless experiences across all Apple devices and empower people with breakthrough services including the App Store, Apple Music, Apple Pay and iCloud. Apple's more than 100,000 employees are dedicated to making the best products on earth, and to leaving the world better than we found it.\n",

Apple is also donating a dollar to the cause for every purchase made with Apple Pay at the Apple Store, on the company’s website or through the Apple Store app, all the way up to $1 million. \nOn iTunes, Apple is offering a free download of The Lazarus Effect, a documentary about (RED)‘s mission, to encourage donations. The Killers have released an exclusive holiday album in support of the effort, with 100 percent of those proceeds going to the cause. And for the next week, the following games will also offer “limited-edition, custom (RED) content,” with all of the proceeds from those in-app sales going to the fund: Angry Birds 2",

      "text": "Samsung Loses Appeal to Overturn Ruling in Apple's Favor, Must Pay $120 Million GO The company has one more option before having to pay Nov 30, 2016 13:08   Bad news for Samsung, as the company is very close to being force to pay about $120 million in damages to Apple after the U.S. Court denied the South Korean's company appeal. The rivalry between Samsung and Apple goes beyond the smartphone market and more often than not the giants cross swords in courtrooms. Patent clashes between the two companies are legendary and seem to never end. There are lawsuits that last decades before a final ruling is given and one of the parties is declared the winner. One of these lawsuits received a verdict back in 2014, when both Apple and Samsung were found guilty for infringing on each others patents. However, whereas Apple sought $2.2 bullion in damages, the court ordered the South Korean company to pay $119.6 million in damages for infringing on three Apple patents. On the other hand, Apple was found guilty for infringing on one Samsung patents and order to pay $158,400 in damages. Notice the big gap between the amounts the companies must pay each other. Overturning the overturn Anyway, Samsung filed an appeal that got the verdict overturned in its favor early this year. But Apple disagreed and once again moved for a review before a full court, which overturned the overturn and ruled, once again, in Apple's favor thus restoring the $119.6 million damages award. The South Korean company has decided to move to the U.S. Court of Appeals to try and get rid of the previous ruling, but the court has denied it. Now Samsung has one more option before the ruling becomes mandatory and the company must pay the amount ordered. The Supreme Court is the last wall of defense for Samsung, as the company hopes to overturn the ruling in Apple's favor. A verdict is expected to be given by the Supreme Court by June next year, so we will be hearing about this again in the not so distant future.",

      "text": "By Billboard Staff  27 AM EST \nEddy Cue, Apple senior vice president of internet software and services, helps introduce the new iOS software at an Apple event at the Worldwide Developer's Conference on June 13, 2016 in San Francisco. Andrew Burton/Getty Images 0 0 \nCollege kids in nearly two dozen new countries are now eligible to access Apple Music’s 30 million-song library for half the normal sticker price. The student plan, which was introduced in May , has been rolled out in Canada, Japan, France and China, among other markets. \nStudent pricing was already available in the U.S., U.K., Australia, Germany, Ireland, New Zealand and Denmark. New territories cover all parts of the globe, including South America (Brazil), Africa (South Africa), Asia (Hong Kong), the Persian Gulf (UAE) and Europe (Sweden, home of Spotify). In all there are now roughly 32 places where students can get Apple Music for cheap. \nHow cheap? In the U.S. and Canada, the price is $4.99 per month instead of $9.99 per month. \nApple works with a company called UNiDAYS to help verify that students looking to snag half off are actually enrolled in school. Students are also fast-tracked to the discount if they use a school email address or sign up using campus WiFi. Students on the five (or six or seven or…) year plan take note: this deal only lasts four years following sign-up, though three years don’t need to be continuous. Grad students are also eligible, but the 48-month limit appears to be set in stone. \nHere are the new countries where student pricing is available: \nAustria",

      "text": "print AP \nApple officials have been in regular contact with the Food and Drug Administration over the past few years, discussing diagnostic apps and other unreleased health products. \nThe conversations suggest that Apple has significant ambitions in health technology far beyond the nascent services it has publicly released so far — ambitions that may lead to new products that require government regulation as health devices. \nThe meetings were not listed on FDA public calendars. They were discovered and reported by Mobi Health News , which obtained emails between Apple and FDA officials through a Freedom of Information Act request. What they talked about: \nIn the sometimes redacted emails seen by Mobi Health News , Apple officials discuss several unreleased products including: Two \"possible (and related) products in the cardiac space\" A diagnostic app for Parkinson's disease. Fast Company previously reported Apple is working on a Parkinson's monitoring app. \nThe \"cardiac space\" products are interesting, although the emails seen by Mobi Health News doesn't have more details. The reporters speculate that it might have to do with an EKG attachment for Apple Watch. AliveCor, a startup, makes a similar product called Kardia Band. \nAliveCor \nIt's also possible that Apple is planning to integrate better heart rate tracking into future versions of the Apple Watch. \nPlus, there have been rumors from earlier this year that Apple is working on a health-focused hardware device. And Apple CEO Tim Cook has hinted that a regulated medical device is something the company would be interested in. \nThe Parkinson's app, if it were able to diagnose the disease, would most likely require federal regulation, which would make it a first for Apple. Since 2013 \nDivya Nag, head of Apple's health projects and a member of BI's Silicon Valley 100 Apple \nApple famously met with the FDA in 2013, before the Apple Watch was released. Based on a previously FOIAed document, the two sides met to talk about what looks like later became ResearchKit and CareKit, software frameworks to make health apps on iPhones. \nBut at the time, some thought the meeting hinted at an Apple Watch that was decidedly health-focused. \nSince then, Apple has been in regular contact with FDA officials, including FDA Commissioner Robert Califf, Jeffrey Shuren, director for the agency’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health, and Bakul Patel, the FDA associate center director for digital health, Mobi Health News reported . \nBoth Califf and Shuren have public calendars because they are public officials, but their Apple meetings are not listed. Some meetings appear to have been renamed because of public calendar concerns. \nApple officials involved in the talks include director of federal government affairs Tim Powderly, Bud Tribble, a VP of Software Technology, Mike O'Reilly, Apple's VP of Medical Technology, and Divya Nag, who lists her title on LinkedIn as Special Projects. \nMost of the talks centered around regulatory issues, such as how Apple's ResearchKit should be classified, how Apple approves health-focused apps in its App Store, and what working groups Apple scientists would join, according to the emails seen by Mobi Health News. Apple health ambitions \nAP / Alex Brandon \nCook has laid out Apple's obvious medical ambitions in public a few times, notably in May, during a public talk. \n\"We believe that health is something that is a huge problem in the world, and we think it is ripe for simplicity and a new view, and we'd like to contribute to that,\" Cook said . \nApple has been building a large health team inside its Special Projects division that is working on a whole slew of projects, including new Apple Watch sensors, better fitness algorithms, medical record tracking and sharing, and now, apparently, cardiac devices. \nBut if Apple were to truly attack the health space, in a way few other Silicon Valley tech giants have in the past, it would be very different from releasing new iPhones. Most medical technology is heavily regulated, and timelines for new devices can take years, which is much slower than Apple's typical pace. \nRegardless, Apple wants to be a player in digital health, and in order to get there, it has to go through and work with the FDA. \nAll of Mobi Health News ' coverage is worth a read if you're interested in the future of digital health.",

      "text": "If your iPhone 6S has been plagued with power issues, never fear: Apple is offering battery replacements for the faulty devices.\nSEE ALSO: Yeah, the iPhone 7 is boring, but who cares? I still love it.\nThe abrupt system shut-downs make it abundantly clear that something's not quite right, but when Apple addressed the issue and announced the global replacement program , it didn't provide an easy way to find out if your phone is affected.\nImage: apple/screengrab\nUnless you really love your phone, it's probably extremely unlikely that you have its birthday marked on the calendar. Short of taking it all the way to the Apple Store and checking in there, Apple gives no easy way to know if your device is eligible for the replacement.\nThankfully 9to5Mac has compiled the list of serial numbers that Apple Store reps are using to identify the devices. To see if your 6S is possibly at risk, just check for yourself.\nLocate your serial number one of two ways: look at the back of your phone (below the \"S\" icon) or go to Settings>General>About (Apple gives a more in-depth guide here ). Once you have it, check if the two figures in the fourth and fifth position match any of these Q/number combinations:\nQ3\nQ4\nQ5\nQ6\nQ7\nQ8\nQ9\nQC\nQD\nQF\nQG\nQH\nQJ\nIf you have a match, you should consider taking your phone in for replacement even if you haven't had any issues. Just be wary if your screen is in rough shape — Apple says any cracks or damage will need to be fixed before a battery replacement. If that's the case, you're really out of luck.\nBONUS: Keep this mini camera drone inside your phone case for the best aerial selfies",

      "text": "Tim Cook Discusses World AIDS Day, PRODUCT(RED), and Apple's Values in New Interview Wednesday November 30, 2016 8:16 AM PST by Mitchel Broussard Following the announcement of Apple's annual fundraising for World AIDS Day this morning, USA Today has now published a new interview with CEO Tim Cook , discussing the lengths Apple goes to in support of projects like PRODUCT(RED) and what it means to Cook personally. The fundraising will donate $1 to (RED)'s fight against AIDS for every purchase made with Apple Pay in an Apple Store, on Apple.com, or through the Apple Store app from December 1-6. Cook said that the company \"wanted there to be something for everyone\" in terms of donating, learning about the issue at hand, or simply being excited for a new Apple accessory launch. There are four new PRODUCT(RED) items, including an iPhone 7 Smart Battery Case, iPhone SE Case, Pill+ Portable Speaker, and Beats Solo3 Wireless On-Ear Headphones. (RED) CEO Deb Dugan said that the company, combined with Apple's spotlight on the issue, has positively impacted the lives of 70 million individuals suffering from HIV/AIDS. \"We put our weight behind lots of things in the civil rights area,\" says Cook. \"Similarly, I think it's key that people think about what they stand for and help their communities. We always say that we want to leave the world better than we found it. So, we try to thoughtfully decide how we can do that.\" The topic of Donald Trump's upcoming presidency is briefly touched upon, centering around the possible negative ramifications for Apple and other more left-leaning tech companies. When asked if he's concerned whether Trump supporters would denounce Apple because of its anti-Trump viewpoints , Cook remained adamant that Apple -- and any company -- should retain a strong central value system, whether or not those values misalign with some of its customers. \"Of course corporations should have values, because people should have values,\" says the soft-spoken tech leader, who has been vocal on a range of civic issues, from gay rights to privacy rules. \"And corporations are just a bunch of people.\" Cook was also asked to address critics who claim that his stance domestically on certain issues, namely gay rights, is hypocritical given that homosexuality is a crime \"in about a fifth of the 100-plus countries Apple does business in.\" Another point claims that the company's political leanings help generate more sales towards its younger millennial customer base. Cook responded: \"We'll always help the most people through our products, because they empower people to do great things themselves,\" he says. \"But this (RED) partnership allows us to touch a group of people we normally wouldn't. Sub-Saharan Africa is not a big marketplace for us. This is about trying to lift people up.\" \"We haven't shied away from being visible on a number of topics, and if it's something in our wheelhouse, we'll always be visible and stand up to protect as well as advance people's rights,\" he says. Apple and Tim Cook have supported, and fought for, a number of movements and causes over the years, most recently holding a fundraiser for Hillary Clinton , fighting for user privacy and security against the FBI, and marching in annual support of LGBT rights during the Pride Festival in San Francisco . Cook's final note on Apple's bold stances was that he and the company don't intend to stop moving forward in the fight for acceptance, inclusiveness, and support in all of these areas and more. \"Every generation has a responsibility of expanding the definition of those rights, to move forward. So we'll very much continue to do that.\" Check out the full USA Today interview with Tim Cook here .

      "text": "News › OnePlus 3T 16MP front camera test: we compare it against the OnePlus 3, Apple iPhone 7 Plus and LG G5 OnePlus 3T 16MP front camera test: we compare it against the OnePlus 3, Apple iPhone 7 Plus and LG G5 Posted: Tags : Apple - Apple + Camera - Camera + OnePlus - OnePlus + The OnePlus 3T is one of the best new phones when you start looking for phones that bring great value for the money: after all, the OnePlus 3T features the same Snapdragon 821 system chip as in the Google Pixel XL, yet costs around half its price. If you look back in time, though, you'd see that the OnePlus 3T is a direct successor to the OnePlus 3: it looks exactly like it (save for the darker, 'gunmetal' shade), but features the newer 821 system chip and a slightly larger battery. The last major change is in the front camera: the OnePlus 3T comes with a 16-megapixel selfie shooter, up from an 8-megapixel camera on the OnePlus 3. A 16-megapixel camera: who needs that many megapixels? A 16-megapixel front camera is probably the most megapixels you can get from a front camera in any phone, but does it even make sense? More megapixels for the camera mean that every single pixel is usually smaller, and a smaller pixel can mean hindered performance in low light. And can you really tell the difference in good lighting? We put the OnePlus 3T camera to the test to find out and here is a summary of its performance: the biggest change that we see is that this new front camera blurs much more of the background, which makes it easier to focus on the subject of those pictures, which is usually your own precious self. This is a good thing: it helps images be more focused. Interestingly, more megapixels somehow don't mean that images are larger: yes, in certain situations you get files that are up to twice larger, but often times the files are actually bigger on the 8-megapixel OnePlus 3. Are they sharper? We actually found that much more often a slight shake in our hand would make selfies blurry on the OnePlus 3T and in the general case the OnePlus 3 actually did a little bit better with sharpness. The other phones were not as sharp: the LG in particular, but the iPhone was also not able to resolve as much detail. In comparison with the OnePlus 3 colors on the 3T front camera have been tweaked slightly: skin colors in particular often appear a bit paler, which we find is a bit too pale. Colors sometimes turn a bit purplish, but in the general case the OnePlus performs very well. The iPhone makes all selfies very yellow-ish, which is noticeable, while the LG often goes overboard with the contrast. OnePlus 3T features sharp detail and camera that is not too wide A nice feature that both OnePlus phones have is face detection, but on the 3T it's improved and tracks your face better. Finally, the OnePlus 3T selfie camera is not as wide as on other phones the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge, but it's not as narrow as on the iPhone either: it's somewhere in between, which is a good thing as it works well for both selfies and group pictures. All in all, the OnePlus 3T has one of the best front cameras around, but this does not mean that it is a big improvement over the OnePlus 3: in most cases, the two give nearly identical results, and we actually found the smaller pixels on the OnePlus 3T result in blurrier pictures in low light. Take a pictures below and see for yourselves.",

      "text": "A years-long patent dispute between Samsung and Apple might finally be coming to a close. This week, a federal appeals court  denied Samsung’s request for a rehearing on a decision that it infringed on two Apple patents, effectively closing the case unless the Supreme Court is willing to hear it. So right now, Samsung still owes Apple nearly $120 million.\nIn 2014, a jury in San Jose, California found that Samsung infringed on Apple’s quick links patent, which turns addresses and phone numbers into links, as well as the company’s swipe to unlock patent. During the trial, Apple was also ordered to pay $158,400 for infringing on a Samsung patent covering a photo and video gallery feature.\nSamsung’s verdict was overturned once, then reinstated again earlier this year. Apple’s $158,400 has also been maintained. A separate Samsung / Apple patent case is currently being deliberated by the Supreme Court and is expected to have a decision by June 2017. So settle in because this definitely isn’t the last time we’ll be hearing about a patent dispute between the two companies.",

      "text": "By Ryan Christoffel \nOne year ago, Apple launched a new product to accompany its first ever iPad Pro: the Apple Pencil. Presented not as a replacement for touch input, but as a tool geared toward specific tasks, the Pencil immediately endeared itself to creatives who sketch or illustrate. In the weeks following the announcement, I remember scouring Twitter and Instagram for any first impressions I could find from people who had tried this new device. Some of the best came from Apple's visits to Disney and Pixar , where many of my favorite movie makers seemed thrilled about the Pencil. It looked like the perfect tool for artistic tasks. \nApple's pride in creating the Pencil has been clear since they first announced it. In its already jam-packed September 2015 keynote, the company dedicated significant time and attention to the product, including a video introduction from Jony Ive and three live demos that put the Pencil to use. In this past March's keynote , when Apple announced the 9.7\" iPad Pro, Phil Schiller called the Pencil \"the greatest accessory Apple has ever made.\" High praise from a proud parent. \nMy initial take on the Pencil was that it seemed like a great device, but it wasn't for me. I don't sketch, I'm not a fan of handwriting notes, and using the Pencil for system navigation never appealed to me. But I bought one to give it a try. Apple's return policy made sure no money would be wasted if the Pencil became merely a pretty paperweight in my life. Within a few hours of use I discovered that while the Pencil isn't a daily-used tool for me, it is a device that, for specific tasks, I would never want to be without. Editing Photos \nSince its introduction in 2010, the iPad has always felt like a natural device for editing photos because it is thin, light, and comfortable to hold. A more intimate form of interaction is possible with the iPad. In a very real sense you can hold a photo in your hands, free from the obstructions of a keyboard or other attachments. Hardware aside, photo editing is also more enjoyable on the iPad because of software benefits like the pinch to zoom gesture. Though pinch to zoom started on the iPhone, it feels like it was made for photo editing on an iPad. \nOne main problem with photo editing on the iPad has historically been the lack of precision that a finger supplies versus a trackpad and cursor on the Mac. The Apple Pencil solves this problem. \nMy app of choice for editing photos is the well-loved Pixelmator . There's something that feels so nice about having an iPad on your lap while interacting directly with photos using the Pencil. The Pencil can be used for practically everything in the app, but a couple tasks I particularly enjoy are removing unwanted objects from a photo with the Retouch tools and adding strokes of color with Paint tools. Both can be done with care and minimal errors with the Pencil's precision. Adding color to a photo in Pixelmator \nFor a much simpler option in photo editing, iOS 10 brought Apple's Markup tools to the Photos app. I use Markup to easily draw or write on images with the full benefits of the Pencil's pressure sensitivity, all from within a very simple interface. These same tools can also be invoked via the Messages app before sending a photo off to someone. \nEditing photos on the Mac has never felt natural to me. It feels like there is a huge barrier between me and my photos – like it's a chore. The exact opposite is true on the iPad Pro with Pencil: the experience is a delight and technology gets out of the way. I don't edit photos every day, but the times I do are made substantially better by the Pencil. Annotating Written Documents \nAs part of my day job, I periodically need to review documents written by others and send them back with suggested edits. On a Mac this task is a pain. Apps like Pages and Microsoft Word can be used to add comments to someone's work, but I've always found that method too messy and unintuitive. What I want to do when reviewing someone's work is hold it like I'd hold a piece of paper and write on it like I'd write on paper. I want to be able to write in the margins, underline and highlight words, add punctuation, and scribble things out. And that's exactly the experience the iPad Pro and Apple Pencil give me. \nWord for iPad allows you to draw annotations right on top of a file, which is great, but more often my practice is to export a Word document to PDF and work from there. I've used PDF Expert and Notability for this in the past, and both are excellent, but more recently I've been enjoying the just-launched PDF Viewer . The app has clear, easy to identify tools to do everything I need, and it works well with the Pencil, so I can make the changes I want then send an edited file right back to its author. I can't imagine going back to accomplishing this task on a Mac. PDF Viewer includes a number of useful annotation options \nEven if you never have to annotate someone else's written work, I'm guessing you have some experience with signing digital documents. This is, of course, another area where the Pencil excels. I can write a genuinely accurate signature on PDFs, not the fake imitation signature that might appear when trying to sign for a package or verify a credit card purchase. Forms that require more information than just a signature are also a delight to fill out with the Pencil. No more printing a form, filling it out by hand, then scanning and submitting it. You can simply open the digital file, fill it out by hand using the Pencil, then send it away. I do this regularly with Apple Mail and Markup. Fun Extras \nMy Pencil use isn't restricted solely to work. Most of the time the Pencil is used to get things done, but there are a few ways I use it in more leisurely activities. \nMost of my book reading is done using iBooks, and when that's on my iPad rather than iPhone, it's done with Pencil in hand. Highlighting with the Pencil in iBooks is as simple as running its tip along the words you want to highlight. Tap a single word and just that word is highlighted. It's quick, easy, needing nothing more than a light tap, and it's a nice way to mark content that stands out while reading. Highlighting in iBooks \nAdult coloring books have become quite a thing in the past couple years, and Pigment is an app that fills that space on the iPad with full Pencil support. Coloring isn't a regular thing for me, but on those rare occasions I'm in the mood, it's a nice way to relax. Coloring in Pigment \nThe last regular use of the Pencil is one I recently tried for the first time: handwritten iMessages. Though, as I mentioned, taking notes by hand isn't my thing, handwriting messages is a nice experience in iOS 10. The animation used when writing – and when receiving a handwritten message – is quite sharp. I don't foresee using this iMessage feature all the time, but it will be fun to pull out on occasion. Not a Stylus \nThe Apple Pencil caused quite a stir when it was first announced because of Steve Jobs' famous words, \" Who wants a stylus? \" Jobs argued that multitouch was a superior way to interact with screens; of course, history has proven him right. But the Pencil was never intended to replace our fingers; it isn't Apple backtracking on Jobs' words. \nThe Apple Pencil is a tool for specific tasks. It's a tool that was designed to be a better fit than multitouch for certain jobs. Admittedly the Pencil's biggest appeal is to those who sketch or illustrate, but count me as at least one person outside that camp who has found it an important part of my workflows. \nThe Apple Pencil makes my work easier and more enjoyable, and there's not a much higher compliment you can pay it than that.

      "text": "By John Voorhees \nApple, which has a long-standing relationship with (RED), today announced that: \nIn honor of World AIDS Day, Apple® is offering more ways than ever for customers to join (RED) in its mission to create an AIDS-free generation. Apple is the world’s largest corporate contributor to the Global Fund, and this year marks its 10th anniversary supporting (RED) in the fight to end AIDS. \nIn an interview with Buzzfeed , Tim Cook said the (RED) campaign is \"designed to reach people via all the different ways in which a customer might touch us.\" Apple certainly seems to have accomplished Cook’s goal with an impressive array of plans this year: 400 Apple Stores will turn the Apple logo on the stores red or display special window treatments; 20 games are offering special (RED) content as in-app purchases, the proceeds of which will be donated to the Global Fund; Apple will offer special products, including a Product (RED) smart battery case for the iPhone 7 (pictured in this article on The Verge ), a (RED) leather case for the iPhone SE, a (RED) Beats Pill+ portable speaker, and (RED) Beats Solo3 wireless headphones, which will join the year-round Product (RED) products that Apple offers ; From December 1-6, Apple will donate $1 for every Apple Pay purchase made on apple.com and at Apple Stores up to $1 million; Bank of America will donate $1 for each Apple Pay transaction made with its cards up to the same $1 million maximum and for the same period as Apple; and iTunes has an exclusive (RED) holiday album from The Killers called Don’t Waste Your Wishes , 100% of the the US proceeds of which will be donated the Global Fund. \nTim Cook elaborated in his conversation with BuzzFeed on why Apple participates in events like the (RED) campaign against AIDS: \n“We look for ways we think we can uniquely contribute to the world in which we live,” Cook said. “And we’ll always touch more people through our products than anything else. … It’s that area — an area in which we have expertise — where we think we can make a contribution that multiplies well beyond simply writing a check. We want to advocate for human rights in a way that people can look at what we’re doing and say ‘you know, I could be a part of something like that’—‘I could do something like that.’ For us this is critically important.” Sign Up Unlock MacStories Extras \nClub MacStories offers exclusive access to extra MacStories content , delivered every week; it’s also a way to support us directly. \nClub MacStories will help you discover the best apps for your devices and get the most out of your iPhone, iPad, and Mac.

      "title": "iPad Pro 2: Everything you need to know about Apple’s 2017 tablet",
      "text": "12.9-inch 10.5-inch \nAnd then there’s a report from Japanese site Macotakara that claims we’ll see a 10.9-inch iPad. \nAll this makes it extremely difficult to get a good idea of what Apple has planned for the iPad in 2017. There’s no denying that the range has become increasingly confused, with Apple selling tablets under a growing roster of brand names, including: iPad, iPad Pro , iPad Air, and iPad Mini. There’s a chance that Apple may settle on one single brand name in 2017, and stick with a generally popular screen size in the 10-inch range. \nWe’re also expecting to see a major design overhaul from the new iPad, which could tease long-rumoured changes to the iPhone aesthetic – those are expected in September 2017. For a start, 9to5mac reports that Apple may remove the Home button on the new iPad, testing the waters ahead of a similar move for the iPhone 8 . \nAnd Macotakara cites a supply chain source in Taiwan as saying that the 10.9-inch iPad will have the same footprint as the existing 9.7-inch iPad Pro, thanks to significant size reductions to the bezel. However, the site also reports that the thickness of the device will increase to 7.5mm – the same as on the original iPad Air – to accommodate these changes. It’s believed that the larger 12.9-inch iPad will gain 0.3mm in thickness thanks to a slimmed-down bezel, too. iPad Pro 2 Specs – 10nm A10X chip, OLED display? \nWe may be many months away from the iPad Pro 2 launch, so rumours about actual specs and hardware are thin on the ground. Most of what we can say about the next iPad is based on common sense and guesswork. \nFor instance, Apple introduced a dual-camera configuration on the iPhone 7 Plus , which proved very popular amongst reviewers. If Apple really is working on a new premium iPad, it follows that the tablet would also get the same upgrade. Similarly, we’d expect to see the usual features like a Touch ID fingerprint sensor and a 3D Touch display. There’s also a rumour that Apple might finally scrap the Home button, instead embedding its functionality into the display in a bid to reduce the size of iPad bezels. \nWe’re expecting a significant upgrade to raw performance, too. Specifically, Digitimes reckons Apple will introduce a new A10X chip that builds on the existing A10 processor used in the iPhone 7 . For the unaware, the A10 ‘Fusion’ chip was special in that it was Apple’s first chip to combine high-power and low-power cores, which can be activated depending on the difficulty of the task you’re trying to get done. If it’s an easy job, the low-power cores will handle the grunt work, saving battery life as a result. \nRelated: Best Tablets to Buy \nExcitingly, Dutch tech blog Techtastic has already leaked what appear to be Geekbench benchmark test scores for the Apple A10X chip, with the new processor earning a 4,236 single-core score and a 6,588 multi-core score. That’s compared to the A10 Fusion’s respective 3,490 and 5,580 scores. \nHowever, it’s not clear how similar the two chips will be. While the A10 was built on a 16nm manufacturing process, Apple has reportedly already enlisted chipmaker TSMC to begin producing far more efficient 10nm A11 chips for the iPhone 8. There’s a chance that Apple’s 2017 iPad range might also feature a 10nm chip, which would offer significant performance and efficiency improvements. \nThere’s pressure to make such a move, too. In November, Qualcomm unveiled its new Snapdragon 835 chip, which is built using Samsung’s 10nm FinFET process. That chip is expected to appear in mobile devices very early on in 2017, and is believed to offer either 40% lower power consumption or 27% higher performance, depending on how it is configured. Apple may not want to run the risk of releasing a tablet with outdated chip technology on board, although we’re not entirely convinced either way. \nThe other potential upgrade would be a move to OLED displays, which is also another improvement tipped for the iPhone 8. Apple currently uses standard LCD panels with an LED backlight, while rivals like Samsung and OnePlus use more efficient OLED screens. With OLED displays, each pixel emits its own light, eliminating the need for a backlight. This reduces power consumption, as individual pixels can be turned off – also resulting in deeper (and more true) blacks. Unfortunately, a report from KGI Securities claims that the new iPad Pro won’t be fitted with an OLED display after all, with that change reserved for the 2018 models. Stay tuned. iPad Pro 2 Software – iOS 10 or iOS 11? \nWhat software the next iPad runs on really depends on when the tablet is released. If, as rumours suggest, the iPad Pro 2 lands early next year, then it will almost certainly run on the latest version of Apple’s mobile operating system, iOS 10 . But if it arrives later in September, landing alongside the expected iPhone 8, then it’s far more likely to run on iOS 11. That OS hasn’t been announced yet, but will probably be confirmed next summer at Apple’s annual WWDC developer conference. \nOur money is on an early iPad launch, and thus iOS 10 – and that’s no bad thing. Apple released iOS 10 in September this year, debuting the software on its new iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus handsets. New features included changes to 3D Touch, the lock screen, and the addition of ‘widget’ support. Apple also added additional emojis to Messages, a redesigned interface to Maps, and a new algorithmic categorisation and search system called ‘Memories’ for Photos. Siri also finally bagged support for third-party app-specific requests, so you can, for instance, request an Uber using your voice alone. iPad Pro 2 Price – How much will the next iPad cost? \nWe haven’t seen any leaked pricing for upcoming iPad models yet, so all we have to go on is the cost of existing devices. Here’s what Apple’s tablets currently retail for in the UK:",

      "text": "There’s a new battery issue plaguing various models of Apple's phone, including the iPhone 6s. Though we should expect Apple to investigate and fix the bug that causes unexpected shutdowns even when the battery is more than 30% full , users should also understand how these iPhone batteries work. Just like any other battery, they age. The more you use them — and phones do need constant charging — the more likely the battery is to degrade. In fact, even if you buy a brand new iPhone 7 right now, you might still run into battery issues a year from now. \nContinue reading... \nTrending right now: \nAll of the new features the Android 7.0 Nougat update will bring to the Galaxy S7 What it takes to get a NES Classic Leak reveals another key Galaxy S8 feature that has never been seen before on an iPhone ",

This week, a federal appeals court denied Samsung’s request for a rehearing on a decision that it infringed on two Apple patents, effectively closing the case unless the Supreme Court is willing to hear it. So right now, Samsung still owes Apple nearly $120 million.\n\nIn 2014, a jury in San Jose, California found that Samsung infringed on Apple’s quick links patent, which turns addresses and phone numbers into links, as well as the company’s swipe to unlock patent.

      "text": "By: Research and Markets via Business Wire News Releases November 30, 2016 at 10:39 AM EST Analysis of Apple's A10 iPhone 7 Plus Application Processor: The TSMC Integrated Fan-Out (inFO) Package - Research and Markets Research and Markets has announced the addition of the \"TSMC Integrated Fan-Out (inFO) Package Apple A10 iPhone 7 Plus Application Processor: Analysis\" report to their offering. \nResearch and Markets has announced the addition of the \"TSMC Integrated Fan-Out (inFO) Package Apple A10 iPhone 7 Plus Application Processor: Analysis\" report to their offering. \nEach year, Apple integrates new technology and innovation inside the iPhone. This year with the iPhone 7, Apple is the first to bring Package on Package (PoP) Wafer-Level Packaging (WLP) at the consumer scale. For its new application processor packaging, the A10, Apple has considered to use TSMC's new inFO-PoP (integrated Fan-Out PoP) technology. \nLocated under the DRAM package on the main board, the application processor (AP) is packaged using PoP. Depending on the version (iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus), the DRAM memory has different space management. \nThe Apple A10 is a wafer-level package using TSMC's packaging technology with copper pillar as Through inFO Via (TIV) to replace the well-known Through Molded Via (TMV) technology. With this new technology, Apple marked a huge breaking point with the old traditional PoP found in the previous generations of his APs. In this report, we will show the differences and the innovations of this package: Copper Pillars, Redistribution layer, patent identification, silicon high density capacitor integration, The detailed comparison with the Exynos 8 and the Snapdragon 820 will give the pro and the cons of the inFO technology compared to PoP packaging used in the market. \nThanks to this inFO process, Apple is able to propose a very thin package on package, with a high number of I/O pads and better thermal management. The result is a very cost-effective component that can compete with any well-known PoP. In the report, the cost comparison is also including in order to highlight the difference. \nThis report also includes a technical comparison with previous Apple AP, the A9. \nKey Topics Covered: \n2. Company Profile and Supply Chain \n3. Physical Analysis",

      "text": "Apple updates Boot Camp audio driver that was causing blown MacBook Pro speakers   08:43 am PT (11:43 am ET) Apple has issued an update to Boot Camp drivers within Windows, preventing the random, loud pops from over-ranging and damaging the new MacBook Pro's speakers. However, the driver doesn't fix speakers already damaged by the problem. AppleInsider has confirmed that users who have installed Boot Camp since 1 p.m. Nov. 23 should already have the updated drivers. Older installations may require the user to manually run an Apple software update process from within the Windows installation. Users with un-updated drivers could still experience a periodic loud pop out of proportion with the volume settings while booted into Windows. The loud pops are induced by an out-of-date Windows audio driver in Boot Camp. Users who never booted into Windows through Boot Camp are not affected by the problem, nor are users running Parallels or other similar solutions. Some users reported that MacBook Pro speakers were permanently damaged as a result of the pop over-ranging the hardware. AppleInsider was told by Apple to have users manifesting speaker damage that persists in macOS after exiting Windows contact Apple Care phone support to document the problem, and to make a Genius Bar appointment for assessment and rectification.

      "title": "Partly Sunny Review: Weather Reimagined",
      "text": "By Jake Underwood \nWhen Apple introduced the App Store in 2008, much of the excitement spanned from the opportunities and functionalities these new apps would bring to the iPhone. Many of the first apps were forays into markets untouched by the stock apps – games, social networks, and read-it-later services. \nEight years later, the trends are different; with millions of apps covering almost every genre imaginable, a lot of this year's best apps are refinements or new takes on the same functionalities some of Apple's stock apps offer. \nThat's where Partly Sunny comes in – it's a weather app that, at first glance of its icon, looks almost identical to Apple's Weather. But after tapping into it, Partly Sunny shakes the similarities and introduces a robust, beautiful new way to view weather information. Information Galore \nPartly Sunny, like other paid weather apps, is loaded with data. At its most informative, the app will give you temperature (high, low, “feels like,” and current), precipitation chances, sunrise and sunset, cloud cover, humidity, visibility, and multiple charts and graphs. That sounds cluttered, but Partly Sunny’s interface is designed to only provide you as much information as you want for it to show. \nIn the Locations screen that acts as a hub for all your saved cities, you’ll see your current location and a “glance” with current temperature, weather conditions, the day’s highs and lows, and the likelihood for precipitation. In reality, this information is good enough for a lot of people – but for $2.99, it’s not much more than what a free weather app would offer, including Apple’s own. \nThat’s where the detailed look comes in, and having all of the information I mentioned earlier is where you’ll find the most value out of the $2.99 you pay. By presenting information in one location without the need for much scrolling, Partly Sunny makes viewing multiple sets of data as easy as two taps. \nThe issue Partly Sunny faces, though, is that we’ve seen weather apps throw useful information at us for years. To combat falling in line with all of its competitors, the app offers two graphs – one for hourly forecasts and one for weekly forecasts – that are just different enough from apps like Dark Sky to catch your attention. \nIn the first, Partly Sunny provides an hour-by-hour graph of what the day will look like in your location. By default, the chart will automatically include the temperature, a glyph of the weather conditions, and the precipitation chances; however, tap the label on the left side to change to cloud cover, dew point, humidity, or other metrics. \nThe second, which is found by scrolling further down the page, gives a weekly overview of the forecast. If you want to see more specific details about a day ahead, you can tap into that and see all the robust information Partly Sunny can offer. \nWhen comparing Dark Sky (my previous choice for weather app) and Partly Sunny, I couldn’t help but think that the latter’s presentation of data was vastly superior. With Partly Sunny, I was able to access useful information more quickly, whereas Dark Sky required me to scroll, swipe, and dig into selections more. I’ll include a side-by-side comparison below for your judgement. Design, the iOS Way \nWhat’s immediately striking about Partly Sunny’s design is that it feels designed to belong in iOS – it’s heavy on glyphs, thin text, and white backgrounds. It’s an app that feels built by Apple if the company decided to make a massive iterative change to its own stock Weather app. \n--Above: heavy on glyphs. Below: not heavy on text. Clarify this-- \nThe app’s design isn’t overwhelmingly heavy on symbols or text, but uses both in meaningful ways that don’t feel unnecessary. For example, rather than displaying “Partly Sunny” (my actual weather conditions at the time of writing) in large letters next to the current temperature, the app shelved the text below a picture of a sun shining from behind a cloud. \nPartly Sunny’s ability to use both in conjunction provides the perfect sense of organization, the information being both digestible and informative without much effort. By tucking a large graph under a scroll gesture, the app only gives you the bigger data when you need it. \nWith the inclusion of a dark mode activated by a switch in the settings or a two-finger swipe gesture up or down and an iPad version (which is, unfortunately, always stuck in portrait), Partly Sunny is the complete package in design. Other Features of Note \nAlthough I’m usually stuck in the middle of Indiana, frequent travelers will appreciate Partly Sunny’s support of multiple locations, which are displayed as glances and detailed view. To quickly switch between cities, simply swipe your finger left or right when looking at the detailed view. \nAlso included in the detailed view are links to pollen.com and the National Weather Service, each configured for the specific city you’re in. Those can be found at the bottom left and right and both use Safari View Controller to open the links in-app. \nLastly, Partly Sunny also features a great widget that, at minimum, will show you the same information displayed in the Locations screen in the app itself. When you tap “Show More” in the widgets screen, you’ll get access to two condensed versions of the graphs mentioned above. Conclusion \nBefore purchasing many apps, I often ask myself the same question: how much am I willing to pay for a slight improvement on what this app will replace? With Partly Sunny, the cost of ditching your old weather app for this one is $2.99 and, at least for me, the price is worth it. \nAlthough Partly Sunny lacks radar and an Apple Watch app, its improvements on Dark Sky’s design and hierarchy of information is well worth its price of purchase. And for those using a free weather solution, I encourage you to give the app a try for its relevant weather data. \nArguably my favorite part of Partly Sunny is that it’s only in version 1.0, meaning that it should have a long life ahead with updates to come. If its first version is any indication of its future, Partly Sunny has a lot of promise. \nYou can pick up Partly Sunny in the App Store for $2.99 (iPhone and iPad).

      "text": "Contrary to rumors running rampant at one point in the lead-up to iPhone 7’s September announcement, neither the new 4.7-inch iOS handheld , nor Apple’s dual camera 5.5-incher comes in a swanky blue hue.\nBut in addition to silver, black, gold, rose gold and jet black, you can now get the smaller A10-powered device coated in even flashier red. Well, sort of, as the third iPhone 7 Smart Battery Case option merely changes the look of the product’s rear cover, while boosting energy by a cool 2365mAh.\nIt still costs $99, just like the white and black models, raising visibility for World AIDS Day and Cupertino’s ongoing fight against HIV, in partnership with (RED), a charitable organization co-founded by Bono and Bobby Shriver back in 2006.\nSince then, Apple has contributed almost $120 million to the Global Fund, crucially helping an effort predicted to completely eradicate AIDS by 2030. This year, up to $1 million will be donated for Apple Pay purchases operated through December 6, as well as all proceeds from in-app expenses associated with limited-edition, custom (RED) content offered across 20 popular App Store games, including Angry Birds 2, Candy Crush Jelly Saga, Clash of Clans, FIFA Mobile, or Plants vs. Zombies Heroes.\nYou can also join this noble cause by snapping up new (Product) RED versions of an iPhone SE case, Beats Solo 3 wireless on-ear headphones and Pill+ portable speaker, or revisit the existing crimson lineup to pick up iPhone 6s or 6s Plus cases, Apple Watch Sport bands, select iPad covers, and iPods dedicated to creating an “AIDS-free generation.”\nThe post Apple ramps up AIDS-fighting efforts with four snazzy new (RED) products appeared first on Pocketnow .\n",

      "text": "Reddit \nApple is marking World AIDS Day with a bevy of new products that also mark its ten year anniversary of partnering with (RED). Four new accessories – including an iPhone 7 Smart Battery Case now available in the appeal’s distinctive hue – have been added to the Cupertino company’s range ahead of the holidays, while Apple will also donate a portion of Apple Pay transactions to the fund. It’s not all digital, mind: Apple Stores across five continents will be running (RED) promotions. \nMore than 400 retail locations, in fact, will be “turning red” with special (RED)-themed logos or window decals. From December 1 to December 6, any Apple Pay purchase made an an Apple Store, on Apple’s online store, or via the company’s app will see $1 go to (RED). If you’ve got a Bank of America card registered, and you use that to pay, the bank itself will make a $1 donation too, up to a total of $1m. A commitment to match that by The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation will double it to $2m. \nThere’s also a (BANK OF AMERICA)RED pop-up in Bryant Park in New York City. As well as selling gifts there, with proceeds going toward the charity, there’ll be a gift wrapping offer for previously purchased items. The bank will donate $5 for each gift wrapped. \nIn addition to the (RED) iPhone 7 Smart Battery Case, priced at $99, Apple has a (RED) iPhone SE case too. Finished in the same color, it’s made of leather and priced at $39. A set of (RED) Beats Solo3 Wireless On-Ear Headphones are priced at $299.95, while a (RED) Pill+ Portable Speaker is $229.95. \nExactly what percentage of the sticker price of each product goes to charity has not been disclosed. If you’re a fan of The Killers, the band’s holiday album “Don’t Waste Your Wishes” is an iTunes exclusive. Sales of the download will go to (RED)’s Global Fund. \nMeanwhile, a number of “Games for (RED)” have updated in the App Store, with twenty titles offering in-app purchases with proceeds being donated entirely to the (RED) appeal. Exactly what’s for sale depends on the game itself: in Angry Birds 2, for instance, there’s a special (GEM PILE)RED, while CSR2 has partnered with Bugatti to make the Chiron a (RED) exclusive. Buying it opens up a number of (RED)-only races. The full game of participating titles is as follows: \nAngry Birds 2,",

      "text": "| News \nApple this week announced the schedule of its annual iTunes Connect holiday shutdown. The developer portal for Apple’s digital app platforms will be closed for the Christmas holiday from Friday, December 23 through Tuesday, December 27, Pacific Time. During this period, no new apps or updates to existing apps will be approved for the iOS, Mac, or iBooks Stores. \nThe busiest season on the App Store is almost here. Make sure your apps are up-to-date and ready for the winter holidays. New apps and app updates will not be accepted December 23 to 27 (Pacific Time), so any releases should be submitted, approved, and scheduled in advance. Other iTunes Connect and developer account features will remain available. \nWhile this outage most directly affects developers and publishers, Apple customers should know that this also means that developers won’t be able to offer discounted holiday pricing on their apps unless they submit and schedule the sale prior to the shutdown. So if there’s a special app you’ve been waiting on for a holiday sale, be sure to let the developer know to get their homework done before the iTunes Connect staff heads off to gingerbread land.

Part of Apple’s “Color Burst” design theme, the wallpapers are already available in iOS 10, but macOS Sierra 10.12.2 Beta 4 marks the first time that these images are available in full-screen glory on the Mac. \nmacOS Sierra 10.12.2 is expected to be released to the public next month, but for those unwilling to wait, you can grab the new Color Burst wallpapers from Imgur now. In addition to the familiar Color Burst designs, there’s also a new fourth macOS wallpaper called “Abstract Shapes.” Each wallpaper is available at up to “5K” resolution of 5120×2880. \nThe Sierra 10.12.2 update will be focused on under-the-hood fixes and improvements, with few user-facing features or changes. Aside from the new wallpapers, the primary new feature is the addition of enhanced emoji characters. Share this:",

      "text": "Reddit After delaying the release of its new cord-free wireless headphones called AirPods, Apple has today reportedly confirmed the product is expected to ship over the next few weeks. The confirmation comes via an alleged email from CEO Tim Cook to a customer (via Macrumors ), but Apple has yet to make an official announcement or comment. In the email Tim Cook reportedly answered a customer’s question regarding the delayed product, saying that the company is “finalizing them” and anticipating to “begin to ship over the next few weeks.” Here’s the full alleged exchange between Cook and the customer: Customer’s comment: “Give us a release date. I really bought in to the wireless vision you painted. Now I’m stuck waiting with my EarPods but can’t charge my 7 at the same time which I need to do at work. Let us know if it’s a month or 6 months, because then I’ll just buy some other wireless headphones.” Tim Cook’s response: “Thanks for your note. Sorry for the delay—we are finalizing them and I anticipate we will begin to ship over the next few weeks.” Apple had originally planned to release the new $159 AirPods in “late October,” but announced one day before its Mac event late last month that it would push the release to a new, unspecified date. At the time, an Apple spokesperson offered a statement saying the company doesn’t “believe in shipping a product before it’s ready” and that it needs “a little more time before AirPods are ready for our customers.”",

      "text": "Apple hires Billy Sorrentino, Wired’s current head of creative KO By Kyle O'Brien - 30 November 2016 17:03pm Apple hires Wired's Billy Sorrentino / Semi Permanent \nOne of the top editors at Wired magazine has been hired by Apple. Billy Sorrentino has announced that he will leave the publication to take on a yet-to-be-announced role with the tech giant, according to a report on Apple Insider . \nThe magazine confirmed the move but Apple has not offered details of the role Sorrentino will be taking. \nSorrentino has been the head of creative at Wired since 2013, overseeing the brand’s four creative departments – photo, design, video and production. He was responsible for cross-channel brand presence on print, web, digital editions, mobile, social, retail and live events. \nIt is unclear how Apple will utilize Sorrentino’s talents, but he is known for his design skills. He was formerly design director at Condé Nast’s digital publishing arm, prior to his work at Wired. He was also head of design at Maxim, Blender and WWE, and ran his own design agency from 2003 to 2010. \nDavid Moretti, previously Wired’s deputy creative director, will take Sorrentino’s role at the magazine, according to a story on Recode.",

      "text": "CUPERTINO, Calif. — Apple CEO Tim Cook rocks in his chair as he meets the question with an unyielding gaze.\n\"Of course corporations should have values, because people should have values,\" says the soft-spoken tech leader, who has been vocal on a range of civic issues, from gay rights to privacy rules. \"And corporations are just a bunch of people.\"\nCook met with USA TODAY to discuss the company's expanded corporate partnership with (RED), the 20-person organization founded by U2 singer Bono that has had an outsized impact on those suffering from HIV/AIDS by providing life-saving medicines.\nGetty Images Tim Cook Beginning Wednesday, which in Australia marks December 1's World AIDS Day, Apple will festoon 400 stores, a fourfold increase from last year, with (RED) signage, while expanding the number of products, games and apps whose purchases channel an undisclosed percentage of their sales price to the organization. \nAmong the new (RED) products are an iPhone 7 battery pack case and Beats Solo 3 Wireless headphones. Nearly two dozen games such as Angry Birds and Clash of Clans will donate all proceeds from in-app purchases. And for every item bought at an Apple Store using Apple Pay, the company will donate $1 to (RED), up to $1 million. Bank of America will match that donation when its cards are used in an Apple Pay transaction. \nMore from USA Today: \nHere One earbuds are wireless 'computers for your ears' \nIt's game on for Facebook, Messenger \nSamsung considers split, tweaks shareholder return plans \n\nThose who buy a new album by The Killers, Don't Waste Your Wishes , on iTunes will see the entire purchase go to (RED), while anyone wanting to know more about the battle against AIDS can avail themselves of a free download of Spike Jonze's 2010 documentary The Lazarus Effect . \n\"Whether you want to donate or just learn about the issue, we wanted there to be something for everyone,\" says Cook. \nSo far, (RED) has impacted the lives of 70 million HIV/AIDS sufferers, says (RED) CEO Deb Dugan. \n\"It takes just 30 cents a day to keep someone alive,\" says Dugan, who also joined the conversation at Apple's headquarters. It ranged from talk about eradicating the global AIDS epidemic by 2030 to the need for companies to use their platforms to create social issue awareness. \n\"We put our weight behind lots of things in the civil rights area,\" says Cook. \"Similarly, I think it's key that people think about what they stand for and help their communities. We always say that we want to leave the world better than we found it. So, we try to thoughtfully decide how we can do that.\" \nThat sort of C-suite level initiative on social matters may be necessary as a new administration gets ready to take office in January. \nBillionaire tech investor Peter Thiel aside, many tech titans supported president-elect Donald Trump 's rival Hillary Clinton and several publicly voiced concern over Trump's attitude toward immigrants, Muslims, women and the disabled. \nThey've now found themselves off kilter with the many voters and consumers who put the real estate mogul into office, and they're now anxiously awaiting word on how Trump and his appointees will treat the wealthy, often left-leaning industry. \nCook was among those tech CEOs favoring Clinton, and according to a trove of emails uncovered by Wikileaks, he was in the running as a possible vice presidential pick before Tim Kaine got the nod. \nWhile campaigning, Trump repeatedly said he would force companies such as Apple to build their products in the United States. A report in Nikkei Asian Review last week cited unnamed sources saying Apple had asked two of its biggest Chinese suppliers about the impact of moving their manufacturing to the U.S. Apple would not comment. Most industry observers believe such a move would drastically increase the cost of Apple's products. \nWhile companies like Apple may now be defending their manufacturing strategy — or changing it — they may leaned on to support initiatives the Trump-Pence administration won't. \nCorporate America needs to step up \n\"Looking at the funding and policy positions of the new administration, to say I'm concerned is an understatement, I'm practically despondent,\" says Kevin Frost, CEO of amFAR, the American Foundation for AIDS Research, which was born at the height of the 1980s crisis when the disease first emerged. \n\"Our hope is that corporate America will step into the vacuum of leadership on this and other public health issues.\" \nFrost says at worst, a lack of government support for both HIV/AIDS research and relief efforts such as PEPFAR (the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief) could erase the possibility of vanquishing the disease by 2030. \n\"AIDS in the U.S. is a manageable disease, but elsewhere millions still die, which is why organizations like (RED) and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation are so important,\" he says. \"On some level, I'm envious of what (RED) has done, and it's down in part to partnering with juggernauts such as Apple.\" \nWhen (RED) debuted in 2006, Apple funneled some of the proceeds from a red iPod Nano to the organization, which at the time was trying to reduce the number of babies around the world — 1,200 a day — born with the HIV virus. \nOver the past decade, Apple grew the scope of its (RED)-branded hardware and software offerings. To date, proceeds gathered by the sale of Apple products account for one-third of (RED)'s $360 million haul since its inception. Today, some 400 babies are born daily with HIV. \n\"The stakes are still high, 37 million people still have HIV/AIDS,\" says Dugan. \"If you look at the globe, it's still a modern-day plague. But it's preventable and it could disappear in our lifetime. Our most immediate goal is to eradicate mother-to-child transmission by 2020, most of which is in Africa.\" \nCook leans forward and leans his elbows on the conference room table: \"Your education shouldn't depend on your zip code, and similarly your ability to live past your first birthday shouldn't depend on where you're born.\" \nCook, who took over from the late Steve Jobs in 2011, hasn't been shy about confronting pressing issues of the day. \nHe was front and center in defying government-led efforts to unlock an iPhone that was owned by one of the San Bernardino killers. And perhaps not surprisingly, Cook, who is gay, has been particularly visible on LBGTQ rights issues, coming forward to denounce Indiana and Arkansas state laws that were viewed as discriminatory. \nSome critics contend that Cook's stance domestically rings hollow when being gay is illegal in about a fifth of the 100-plus countries Apple does business in. And others suggest that taking such a stand helps boost sales with like-minded consumers, especially tech-hungry Millennials who gravitate toward companies that take a position on issues they value. \nCook shrugs off such talk. \n\"We'll always help the most people through our products, because they empower people to do great things themselves,\" he says. \"But this (RED) partnership allows us to touch a group of people we normally wouldn't. Sub-Saharan Africa is not a big marketplace for us. This is about trying to lift people up.\" \nMight Apple — one of the best known brands on the planet with a market value of nearly $600 billion, a third of which is holds in cash — use its considerable consumer muscle to tackle new social issues in the coming year? Cook suggests that his company may well become as known for its stands on matters of societal importance as its popular technology gadgets. \n\"We haven't shied away from being visible on a number of topics, and if it's something in our wheelhouse, we'll always be visible and stand up to protect as well as advance people's rights,\" he says. \"Every generation has a responsibility of expanding the definition of those rights, to move forward. So we'll very much continue to do that.\"",

      "text": "Apple's ecosystem becomes increasingly material, exceeding the profit margins of all other product categories. \nServices revenue is increasingly sustainable and consistent, and estimated to grow 18% in 2017. \nHigher profit margin from Services category will increase overall profitability. We've long held that Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) products are gateway devices into the Apple ecosystem, one powered by Apple's operating system in its various iterations. As each device links with the ecosystem, the ecosystem becomes your digital world and the network affects compounds. This ecosystem provides Apple with certain competitive advantages. First, it provides an inherent \"stickiness\" to the company's product lines, as users are loathe to switch operating systems when their programs, apps, and media content become voluminous and entrenched in a particular type of software. Second, once in the ecosystem, everything is funneled through Apple. The company's products become the gatekeeper between consumers and vendors. On one side stands you the consumer, one that is demographically wealthier and statistically a higher user of Internet services, and on the other side are vendors (e.g., music, movie and media companies, software companies, goods and service providers such as Uber, Gilt, Airbnb, etc.). For each transaction funneled to you, Apple can potentially take a cut, and the profit margins on it are staggeringly high. In the first quarter of 2016, Apple made a concerted effort to discuss revenue derived from services, which is really another way of saying the monetization of Apple's ecosystem. Since that discussion, the growth in service-related revenue has really proven out. Apple's 2016 fiscal year marked what we call the turning point; the point where revenue from monetizing the ecosystem grew faster and generated a higher profit margin than all other revenue categories. To understand this, let's take a deeper dive into Apple's services revenue. Apple's Services The company defines services in its 2016 Form 10-K to include revenue from Internet Services, AppleCare ® , Apple Pay, licensing and other services. Internet Services is further defined as iTunes Store ® , App Store ® , Mac App Store, TV App Store, iBooks Store TM and Apple Music ® (collectively \"Services\"). As Apple's Services has evolved, one-off transactional services are now complemented by sustainable subscription, licensing and insurance revenue. \nOne-Off à Sustainable",
