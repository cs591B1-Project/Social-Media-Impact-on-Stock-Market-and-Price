(Rummana Hussain/Chicago Sun Times via AP, File ) \nCHICAGO (AP) — A special prosecutor says a grand jury has been impaneled to hear evidence into a possible cover-up by Chicago police officers in the fatal shooting of Laquan McDonald. \nPatricia Brown Holmes on Wednesday told Chief Criminal Court Judge LeRoy K. Martin Jr. the special grand jury will begin issuing subpoenas over the next 30 to 45 days. She did not say if the jurors have already heard any evidence. \nMartin named Holmes to look into whether officers lied to justify the October 2014 shooting of the 17-year-old McDonald. \nVideo released last year showed officer Jason Van Dyke shooting McDonald 16 times. Van Dyke has pleaded not guilty to murder. \nNo other officers have been charged in the incident that prompted numerous protests after video of the shooting was made public.",

      "text": "November 16, 2016 5:57 PM Grand jury will look into possible cover-up in McDonald case FILE - This undated file photo shows Patricia Brown Holmes, a former federal prosecutor who was named special prosecutor to consider if Chicago police officers were involved in a cover up in the 2014 fatal shooting of Laquan McDonald in Chicago. Holmes said Wednesday, Nov. 16, 2016, that a grand jury has been impaneled to hear evidence into the possible cover-up. Chicago Sun Times via AP, File Rummana Hussain i Order Reprint of this Story CHICAGO \nA special prosecutor says a grand jury has been impaneled to hear evidence into a possible cover-up by Chicago police officers in the fatal shooting of Laquan McDonald. \nPatricia Brown Holmes on Wednesday told Chief Criminal Court Judge LeRoy K. Martin Jr. the special grand jury will begin issuing subpoenas over the next 30 to 45 days. She did not say if the jurors have already heard any evidence. \nMartin named Holmes to look into whether officers lied to justify the October 2014 shooting of the 17-year-old McDonald. \nVideo released last year showed officer Jason Van Dyke shooting McDonald 16 times. Van Dyke has pleaded not guilty to murder. \nNo other officers have been charged in the incident that prompted numerous protests after video of the shooting was made public. Related content",

Customers will now be able to customize any item on the menu with spicy sriracha until the end of 2016 at participating locations, according to the burger chain. \nCentral Ohio is the only market that will be featuring the new burger. The region will gather valuable feedback from consumers to determine whether the sandwich will expand to restaurants nationwide. Share this: ",

The fastfood chain literally covered their Queens Blvd, New York branch with a white sheet, dressing up as the ghost of McDonald’s. Scary stuff. \nRoughly drawn golden arches appeared on the sheet and their product packaging, but not to worry, it was all a trick. The treats remained flame-grilled.",

Loveable character balloons, top marching bands from across the country, festive floats, cultural groups, theatrical performances, equestrian groups, and celebrity guests, plus over a thousand dedicated volunteers, all marching through the Loop, make the McDonald's Thanksgiving Parade an annual celebration for the whole family. For those not in Chicago, the parade is nationally broadcast, live, on WGN America. The 2016 McDonald's Thanksgiving Parade takes place LIVE on State Street between Congress Parkway and Randolph Street in downtown Chicago on Thanksgiving Day, Thursday, November 24 from 8 to 11 a.m. (CST). Chicago-born Matt Walsh of HBO's Veep will serve as the Grand Marshal of this year's Parade. Walsh will be joined by comedian, Sebastian Maniscalco, Emma Kenney from Showtime's Shameless and Dante Brown from Fox's new Lethal Weapon. Returning to the parade will be Northbrook's own Yuri Sardarov from the TV hit series Chicago Fire and chef, restauranteur, and Top Chef host/judge Graham Elliot. McDonald's Owner/Operators of Chicagoland and Northwest Indiana, the title sponsor of the parade, will also present the McDonald's Community Fire Truck, the Jesse White Tumbling Team, the Ronald McDonald Care Mobile in Partnership with Advocate Children's Hospital, Hinsdale South High School Marching Band, Lake Zurich High School Marching Band, The Hiplet Ballerinas of CMDC, Michigan City Soul Steppers Drill Team and Ronald McDonald and his Big Red Shoe. The Northwest Indiana McDonald's Operators are also presenting the Pantry on the Go. Originally called the Christmas Caravan in the 1930s, the Parade was created in 1934 to help lift the spirits of residents suffering through the Great Depression. Since then, it has developed into a full-scale spectacle that celebrates the holiday season. What once started out as an attempt to boost Chicago's economy has evolved into a cherished holiday tradition for Chicagoans and Americans alike. Over sixteen different countries will share their enriched traditions with Chicago's Parade this Thanksgiving morning. The sights on State Street give the audience a chance to travel the world and embrace other traditions, all without leaving downtown Chicago Broadcast WGN 9 Chicago airs the Parade live and in high definition from 8 to 11 a.m. (CST) Thursday, November 24.

      "text": "November 17,   Celebrate a Holiday Tradition at the 2016 McDonald's Thanksgiving Parade in Downtown Chicago Watch live in person on historic State Street or at home on WGN 9 Chicago and WGN America CHICAGO, IL, November 17,   McDonald's Thanksgiving Parade, a high-quality, family event attracting hundreds of thousands of spectators, celebrates 83 years of Chicago holiday tradition. Loveable character balloons, top marching bands from across the country, festive floats, cultural groups, theatrical performances, equestrian groups, and celebrity guests, plus over a thousand dedicated volunteers, all marching through the Loop, make the McDonald's Thanksgiving Parade an annual celebration for the whole family. For those not in Chicago, the parade is nationally broadcast, live, on WGN America. The 2016 McDonald's Thanksgiving Parade takes place LIVE on State Street between Congress Parkway and Randolph Street in downtown Chicago on Thanksgiving Day, Thursday, November 24 from 8 to 11 a.m. (CST). Chicago-born Matt Walsh of HBO's Veep will serve as the Grand Marshal of this year's Parade. Walsh will be joined by comedian, Sebastian Maniscalco, Emma Kenney from Showtime's Shameless and Dante Brown from Fox's new Lethal Weapon. Returning to the parade will be Northbrook's own Yuri Sardarov from the TV hit series Chicago Fire and chef, restauranteur, and Top Chef host/judge Graham Elliot. McDonald's Owner/Operators of Chicagoland and Northwest Indiana, the title sponsor of the parade, will also present the McDonald's Community Fire Truck, the Jesse White Tumbling Team, the Ronald McDonald Care Mobile in Partnership with Advocate Children's Hospital, Hinsdale South High School Marching Band, Lake Zurich High School Marching Band, The Hiplet Ballerinas of CMDC, Michigan City Soul Steppers Drill Team and Ronald McDonald and his Big Red Shoe. The Northwest Indiana McDonald's Operators are also presenting the Pantry on the Go. Originally called the Christmas Caravan in the 1930s, the Parade was created in 1934 to help lift the spirits of residents suffering through the Great Depression. Since then, it has developed into a full-scale spectacle that celebrates the holiday season. What once started out as an attempt to boost Chicago's economy has evolved into a cherished holiday tradition for Chicagoans and Americans alike. Over sixteen different countries will share their enriched traditions with Chicago's Parade this Thanksgiving morning. The sights on State Street give the audience a chance to travel the world and embrace other traditions, all without leaving downtown Chicago Broadcast WGN 9 Chicago airs the Parade live and in high definition from 8 to 11 a.m. (CST) Thursday, November 24. WGN America also broadcasts the Parade nationwide, establishing it as one of only a few elite parades in the country to be covered live, in its entirety, on a national television broadcast. The Parade streams live online at www.wgntv.com and CLTV rebroadcasts the parade from 1 to 4 p.m. About MOCNI McDonald's Owner/Operators of Chicago and Northwest Indiana represent more than 100 franchisees and nearly 500 restaurants throughout the greater Chicagoland region, including stores as far north as Gurnee, west as Marengo, south as Watseka and east to Northwest Indiana.

The word \"ich liebe es\" and the 5-note jingle were added in 2003. \nAn Adobe Flash version of this logo (with the Golden Arches logo simply zooming out without rotating, the light rays in 2D, the words \"i'm lovin' it\" stretching to normal, and the Golden Arches logo starting out as a thin version, but fades into black and turns into a thick version as it turns from black to yellow) was used in Flash-produced Happy Meal ads and presentations with no voiceovers (including the \"Hot Wheels AcceleRacers\" presentation ad from August 2005 and the \"Teenie Beanie Babies\" presentation ad from July 2004) on the company's website from October 3, 2003 until December 15, 2005. The Adobe Flash version of this logo was still used in the Adobe Flash-made \"Happy Meal Choices\" ad (with no voiceover) from June 2004 until May 2010, resulting in the total discontinuation of the Adobe Flash-produced version of this logo.

      "title": "McDonald v. Chicago",
      "text": "By Ben Garrett \nIn McDonald v. Chicago , the U.S. Supreme Court ruled for the first time that the right to keep and bear arms extends to individuals in each of the 50 U.S. states. The landmark, 5-4 decision came on the heels of the D.C. v. Heller decision in 2008, another resounding victory in the nation’s highest court for gun owners. \nBackground \nNearly two years to the day before the Supreme Court handed down its ruling in McDonald v. Chicago , the high court issued its most important Second Amendment-related ruling in 70 years. In D.C. v. Heller , the Supreme Court confirmed that the right to keep and bear arms extends to individuals in federal enclaves, such as Washington, D.C., but did not address the right of states to restrict individual gun ownership. \nShortly after the Heller decision, 76-year-old Chicago retiree Otis McDonald and three other plaintiffs — Adam Orlov and David and Colleen Lawson — were selected to challenge the Windy City’s 1982 law banning handgun possession. The case was organized by Alan Gura, the Virginia attorney who argued the Heller case. \nAfter setbacks in trial court and in the 7 th Circuit Court of Appeals, the Second Amendment Foundation appealed the McDonald case to the U.S. Supreme Court. Arguments were heard on March 7, 2010, and the court’s ruling was issued June 28, 2010, reversing the 7 th Circuit Court of Appeals’ decision and dealing a fatal blow to Chicago’s 28-year gun ban. \nThe Majority Opinion \nBy a 5-4 decision, the court ruled that the Second Amendment was incorporated by the due process section of the Fourteenth Amendment and individuals were therefore granted a constitutional right to keep firearms in their homes for self-protection, a right greater than the states’ power to restrict it. \n\"It cannot be doubted that the right to bear arms was regarded as a substantive guarantee, not a prohibition that could be ignored so long as states legislated in an evenhanded manner,” Justice Samuel Alito wrote for the majority. \nJoining Alito in the opinion were Chief Justice John G. Roberts and associate justices Antonin Scalia, Anthony Kennedy and Clarence Thomas. \nIn the opinion, Alito noted that Chicago’s handgun ban was put into place in 1982 to protect residents from injury or death, but that the handgun murder rate had actually increased since the ban was put into place. “Chicago residents now face one of the highest murder rates in the country,” Alito wrote. \nThe majority drew heavily on the Heller decision, calling self-defense “a basic right, recognized by many legal systems from ancient times to the present day.” \nThe Dissenting Opinion \nJustices Stephen Breyer, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, John Paul Stevens and Sonia Sotomayor dissented. \nWriting on behalf of the minority, Justice Breyer predicted the decision “may change the law in many of the 50 states.” He added that historical evidence for the majority decision was “at most ambiguous.” \nIn a separate dissenting opinion, Justice Stevens wrote that the majority decision exceeded the scope of the Fourteenth Amendment, which does not necessarily protect constitutional infringement by states in the same manner that it protects federal infringement. “This is a quintessential area in which federalism ought to be allowed to flourish without this court’s meddling,” Stevens wrote. \nImpact \nAs an immediate impact, the right of individuals in the U.S. to possess handguns for self-defense was specifically confirmed. While the ruling did not specifically strike down laws banning handgun possession in Chicago and its Oak Park suburb, Mayor Richard Daley admitted that the ruling made those laws “unenforceable.” \nLike in its Heller decision, the Supreme Court held that state and federal laws prohibiting possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, as well as possession of firearms inside public schools, pass constitutional muster.",

      "text": "By parisha kumari Nov 17, 2016 Twenty years ago, when McDonald's first arrived in India, it was seen as a foreign company, in fact, as an \"American\" company. From outside its glass doors, it was obvious that its interiors would be air-conditioned which in turn, made thew restaurant look expensive and beyond reach.That's the last thing the restaurant chain wanted, of course. Therefore, foremost amongst the agenda before the company on starting its India operations, says Kedar Teny, Director - Marketing & Digital, McDonalds India, was to change this perception in the minds of the potential Indian clientale that it was a foreign company offering foreign-tasting food and beyond the budget of the average consumer.McDonald's India wanted to prioritise its image changeover and win over Indians and it decided to do so with an ad campaign, of course. An ad that would depict the McDonald's restaurant as a comfortable place where an entire family could enjoy a meal.McDonald's: A Home Away From HomeIndeed, the very first ad by McDonald's India succeeded in doing just that. The ad's message, which said, \"McDonald's mein hai kuch baat\", was like an invitation to the people of India to enter the restaurant and experience its ambience, food and prices for themselves.The ad came out in 1997 and made an instant connect with everyone because it told the story of a little boy who is standing on the stage at school, but is feeling too shy to recite the poem that he is supposed to. However, neither his teacher, standing in the wings, nor his parents, who are in the audience, are able to persuade him to speak up. Naturally, the boy is soon in tears.In the next scene, the boy's father decides to cheer up the boy by taking him to a McDonald's restaurant so as to cheer him up. Sure enough, the moment the boy walks into the restaurant, with its warm atmosphere, he overcomes his despondent mood and cheers up.Then, when his Father prompts him to recite his poem once again, the boy does that easily. Soon, other people in the restaurant hear the boy and begin applauding. The audience here includes the manager of the restaurant. The message driven home was that McDonald's was a like a home away from home, where other customers as well as the staff, felt like family.With the actual opening of doors to every Indian family, and the arrival of families, it was time to serve them familiar food as well. Therefore, the McBurger turned into the McAloo Tikki burger, which won hearts all over again. In place of a strange new burger with foreign ingredients, was a real desi burger, with an item inside it that one had loved always.The restaurant's appeal as a family-style restaurant proved to be its winning point. The big, fat Indian family started coming in to have a meal and share a good time. The friendly staff at McDonald's played a crucial role in making them feel at home.Cut to the present, 20 years since: Kedar Teny explains the new ad theme of \"A Lot Has Changed But Nothing Has Changed\", saying, \"When we reached our 20th year milestone in India, we talked to our customers to understand their feelings about McDonald's. We learnt from them that while a lot had changed, in terms of many new offers like more restaurants, launch of McCafés, Drive-Ins and McDelivery, some things hadn't changed at all. The latter included yearning for the last piece of the French fries and searching for the toy inside a Happy Meal.\"\"So, it was an insight into how a lot had changed yet nothing had changed,\" concludes Teny.

      "text": "Throwback Thursday: The 2006 McDonald's All-American Game Quickly With Kevin Durant and Greg Oden once again paired together in the news, we decided to look back on a better time for Oden, when played in the 2006 All-American Game. Share Kenny Ducey Thursday November 17th, 2016 The 2006 McDonald's All-American Game was a magical event, filled with layups, missed jumpers, light defense, and Nick Cannon (the game’s half-time performer). There were players who went on to great things (Kevin Durant, the Lopez brothers, Mike Conley), and some that never quite made it (Demond Carter, Vernon Macklin, and James Keefe). Gerald Henderson led the East team with 16 points, while the Durant led the West—and all scorers—with 25 to earn co-MVP honors with his teammate Chase Budinger. Yeah, dude, Chase Budinger. He only scored 11, to go with four assists and three rebounds, but the the Carlsbad, Calif. native was a big hit with the sold-out crowd in nearby San Diego. The organizers of the event decided to throw him a bone and, evidently, a photo opp with Ronald McDonald. Here, we’ve got three legends—Ronnie Mac, John Wooden (an advisor to the selection committee) and Budinger—standing next to some twig touching his trophy. On the left, you can see a peeved Daequan Cook, who scored 17 points but lost out on a chance to win the co-MVP award with Durant to Budinger, who could have fouled out five minutes in and received a standing ovation. You know what, though? It was probably Cook’s presence on the floor that allowed Durant to score 25 in the first place. Kevin Durant: Greg Oden calling himself a bust is 'nonsense' \nThis was around the time that Cook peaked as a player player. He would go on to play for Thad Matta’s “Thad Five” at Ohio State, be selected just outside the lottery in the 2007 NBA draft and win the NBA Three-Point Shootout in just his second season. When he joined the Thunder in 2010, he passed all of his powers on to Durant, who would win his first of four scoring titles that year. Golden State fans probably have the Ohio native to thank if they take home a title in the Durant era. This is a pretty great photo, because we get a clear look at the crowd in San Diego that day. With Chase Budinger out of the game, looking on in awe as Javaris Crittenton drives by Brook Lopez, some of these fans look terribly disinterested. A couple in the fifth row chats while two pals in the row behind them share a loud laugh. In the rows in front, some fans appear to be spacing out, one woman looks under her seat, presumably for a lost item, one guy picks his teeth, and one or two may even be sleeping. This is the best ‘Where’s Waldo’ game ever. Can you spot the dude in the upper right looking at—what is that, a tablet? They didn’t have tablets back then! This is surely a time-traveler. One more thing—an event staffer needs to clear the aisles, pronto. Can’t have people sitting on the steps. Speaking of disinterest, Darrell Arthur isn’t even looking at Scottie Reynolds, which is probably a bad omen for the rest of his career. My man couldn’t even get the time of day from an NBA team. He was memorably the first AP All-American not taken in the NBA draft since the NBA-ABA merger in 1976. He landed in the Summer League, played fine there during the time he was healthy, and eventually made it to the D-League later in the year, where he dropped 30 in his first game and made it to the NBADL All-Star Game. Now he’s just making that cake overseas. Sorry, Reynolds rant over. That old SI.com logo was cool, right? This is a very cool camera angle, because each time a shot goes up, you can peer into the souls of the onlooking players. They all appear so helpless. Lance Thomas, pictured left, looks like he’s watching a man dunk for the first time. Or, perhaps he’s questioning whether or not Gerald Henderson (the dunker) is actually a high school student. Budinger is doing a poor job of crashing the glass (he can literally get away with anything in this game) and Lopez is ready to box the hell out of Greg Oden up top just in case this dunk pops all the way out to the arc. If Henderson threw down, this was a pretty cool game, really. Tags",

      "text": "A Texas man is spreading the holiday spirit in Fort Worth. According to reports, the individual, who wants to remain anonymous, was recorded on camera handing out $100 bills to employees at a local McDonald’s. The man made his gifting very discreet by simply handing over the cash without placing an order. “You could tell it blessed their day,” said Lisa Davila, one of the man’s employees. “They didn’t come in there [to work] thinking that was going to happen that day… and that was the best part about it.” She shared that he is battling cancer and wants to spread joy despite this challenging period in his life. He reportedly left money for 33 McDonald’s employees.

      "text": "0 1 \n“The Founder” is coming and I’m lovin’ it. I haven’t seen John Lee Hancock’s movie about McDonald’s starring Michael Keaton, but it’s supposed to have enough special sauce to get Michael Keaton an Oscar nomination. In an open year in the Best Actor category, the much loved actor has a good shot. \nBut the folks at McDonald’s aren’t pleased. Even though The Weinstein Company has offered them chances to see the movie, the keepers of the Golden Arches haven’t responded. Indeed, I hear they’ve declined. They figure they deserve a break today. \nThe movie chronicles how Ray Kroc, played by Keaton, bought into the company created by the McDonald’s brothers in the 1950s and slowly took it over. Baseball fans know that Kroc got so rich he bought the San Diego Padres. At one point, in every McDonald’s there was supposed to be a plaque in his memory. Dozens of them are for sale now on the internet. Kroc was such a megalomaniac that the company even put out a commercial honoring him in 1977 for his 75th birthday: Kroc died in 1981 leaving an estate of $8 billion. \n“The Founder” will be released at the very end of December for an Oscar qualifying run, then go wide in January. It’s assumed McDonald’s will not be hosting the premiere. Share this:",

REUTERS/Jim Young - …\nBy Lisa Baertlein\n(Reuters) - A McDonald's Corp (MCD.N) shareholder is redoubling efforts to convince the fast-food chain to stop all of its global restaurants from serving the meat of animals raised with antibiotics that are vital for fighting human infections.\nMore than 70 percent of medically important antibiotics in the United States are sold for livestock use. Scientists have warned that the routine use of antibiotics to promote growth and prevent illness in healthy farms animals contributes to the rise of dangerous, antibiotic-resistant \"superbug\" infections, which kill at least 23,000 Americans each year and pose a significant threat to global health.\nThe Congregation of Benedictine Sisters of Boerne, Texas, is asking directors at McDonald's to prohibit the use of medically important antibiotics in its global poultry supply chain. McDonald's already has adopted that policy for the chicken served in its U.S. restaurants. \nThe group is also asking the fast-food chain to set global targets and timelines for switching to pork and beef raised without the non-therapeutic use of medically important antibiotics.\nJust over 20 percent of McDonald's shareholders voted in favor of a similar proposal at this year's annual meeting.\nThe sisters aim to have shareholders vote on the new proposal at McDonald's 2017 annual meeting. \nMcDonald's told Reuters it continues \"to engage with key experts, including some who serve as advisors to the World Health Organization (WHO), to advance progress across the industry.\" \nThe company said its current policy \"provides guidance to our suppliers in parts of the world where the industry does not yet have systems in place that would allow them to verify compliance throughout the supply chain.\"\nThe sisters are part of the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility (ICCR), which along with ShareAction, Farm Animal Investment Risk & Return (FAIRR) Initiative and As You Sow, also are targeting companies such as Sanderson Farms (SAFM.O) and Yum Brands Inc (YUM.N) with similar campaigns aimed at preserving the efficacy of antibiotics. \n\n\n(Reporting by Lisa Baertlein in Los Angeles; Editing by Bernadette Baum)",

      "text": "A McDonald’s shareholder is redoubling efforts to convince the fast-food chain to stop all of its global restaurants from serving the meat of animals raised with antibiotics that are vital for fighting human infections.\nMore than 70% of medically important antibiotics in the United States are sold for livestock use. Scientists have warned that the routine use of antibiotics to promote growth and prevent illness in healthy farms animals contributes to the rise of dangerous, antibiotic-resistant “superbug” infections, which kill at least 23,000 Americans each year and pose a significant threat to global health.\nThe Congregation of Benedictine Sisters of Boerne, Texas, is asking directors at McDonald’s to prohibit the use of medically important antibiotics in its global poultry supply chain. McDonald’s already has adopted that policy for the chicken served in its U.S. restaurants.\nThe group is also asking the fast-food chain to set global targets and timelines for switching to pork and beef raised without the non-therapeutic use of medically important antibiotics.\nJust over 20% of McDonald’s shareholders voted in favor of a similar proposal at this year’s annual meeting.\nThe sisters aim to have shareholders vote on the new proposal at McDonald’s 2017 annual meeting.\nMcDonald’s told Reuters it continues “to engage with key experts, including some who serve as advisors to the World Health Organization (WHO), to advance progress across the industry.”\n \nThe company said its current policy “provides guidance to our suppliers in parts of the world where the industry does not yet have systems in place that would allow them to verify compliance throughout the supply chain.”\nThe sisters are part of the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility (ICCR), which along with ShareAction, Farm Animal Investment Risk & Return (FAIRR) Initiative and As You Sow, also are targeting companies such as Sanderson Farms and Yum Brands Inc with similar campaigns aimed at preserving the efficacy of antibiotics.",

      "text": "Photo by Kendall Karmanian One of the newly remodeled McDonald's is at Chicago Avenue and State Street. McDonald's doubles down on 'restaurants of the future' \nMcDonald's today said it will expand its \"Experience of the Future\" concept to 500 U.S. stores by the end of the year, hoping the new format will help boost sales the way it did in overseas markets. \nRemodeled restaurants offer limited table service, self-service digital kiosks and customizable sandwiches, which include premium toppings such as guacamole, grilled onions, maple bacon and Dijon mustard. \nThough the remodels will extend to roughly 3.5 percent of the Oak Brook-based company's 14,200 U.S. restaurants, its executives clearly believe updating the chain's tired restaurants will play a key role in boosting sales. \nA River North restaurant got the remodel in September. In addition to its dual-sided digital ordering kiosks, the restaurant has an LED-lit glass display case filled with muffins and cookies. The nearby flagship Rock 'N' Roll McDonald's a few blocks southwest also will receive the remodel, which is under trial in New York, New Jersey, Florida and other markets. \nMcDonald's also is adding mobile ordering and mobile pay in the U.S. and 10 other major markets in 2017.",

      "text": "Remy Gabalda | AFP | Getty Images McDonalds employee prepares a burger A McDonald's shareholder is redoubling efforts to convince the fast-food chain to stop all of its global restaurants from serving the meat of animals raised with antibiotics that are vital for fighting human infections.\nMore than 70 percent of medically important antibiotics in the United States are sold for livestock use. Scientists have warned that the routine use of antibiotics to promote growth and prevent illness in healthy farms animals contributes to the rise of dangerous, antibiotic-resistant \"superbug\" infections, which kill at least 23,000 Americans each year and pose a significant threat to global health.\n\nThe Congregation of Benedictine Sisters of Boerne, Texas, is asking directors at McDonald's to prohibit the use of medically important antibiotics in its global poultry supply chain. McDonald's already has adopted that policy for the chicken served in its U.S. restaurants.\n\nThe group is also asking the fast-food chain to set global targets and timelines for switching to pork and beef raised without the non-therapeutic use of medically important antibiotics.\n\nJust over 20 percent of McDonald's shareholders voted in favor of a similar proposal at this year's annual meeting.\n\nThe sisters aim to have shareholders vote on the new proposal at McDonald's 2017 annual meeting.\n\nMcDonald's told Reuters it continues \"to engage with key experts, including some who serve as advisors to the World Health Organization (WHO), to advance progress across the industry.\"\n\nThe company said its current policy \"provides guidance to our suppliers in parts of the world where the industry does not yet have systems in place that would allow them to verify compliance throughout the supply chain.\"\n\nThe sisters are part of the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility (ICCR), which along with ShareAction, Farm Animal Investment Risk & Return (FAIRR) Initiative and As You Sow, also are targeting companies such as Sanderson Farms and Yum Brands with similar campaigns aimed at preserving the efficacy of antibiotics.",

      "text": "  10:57 AM EST Over Six Awards in Six Months for Tasseologic and McDonald's in Asia Dallas, Texas   \n2016 is the year for McDonald’s and Tasseologic, winning the hearts of the Asia Pacific advertising industry. The latest recognition comes in the form of two awards: a Gold for Data Driven Marketing and a Bronze for Loyalty Marketing from Marketing Magazine’s Annual Marketing Excellence Awards ( http://www.marketing-interactive.com/mea-awards/sg/winners/ ). This will be the sixth award for their analytical and strategic work with the McDonald’s McDelivery Program, which was recognized earlier this year with a prestigious Gold Appie for Best Campaign in their category, as well as Best Presenter for Dr. Urvashi’s Pitre and her business case presentation. \nAs a data-driven, CRM strategy firm, Tasseologic partnered with McDonald’s to tap into predictive logic that up sold and boosted incremental sales within McDelivery, a home-delivery service offered by the QSR giant, and laid the foundation for continued success in this ecommerce channel. Using delivery data, the team built consumer models and customized offers that increased both orders and order sizes. These models were the cornerstone for a custom-built, mass personalization plan that allowed McDonald’s to maintain guest count and protect falloff at a positive ROI. \nSee the program here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7xTs0lkXII​ \n“After winning the Appie on top of the Loyalty and Engagement Awards and now this recognition, we continue to be honored with these awards, but also know that the work we do is meaningful and that the industry values our thinking,” shares Dr. Urvashi Pitre. “Our success is based upon the idea that with whether it's big data or small data, brands can be more relevant to their consumer base and demonstrate ROI. We’ve had amazing support with the McDonald’s team who believes in the power of data and CRM. And believes in us.” \nAbout Tasseologic \nTasseologic is a data-driven marketing strategy company.

      "text": "\n© 2016 Time Inc. All rights reserved. McDonald’s Shareholder Pushes for Switch to Antibiotic-Free Meat \nA McDonald’s shareholder is redoubling efforts to convince the fast-food chain to stop all of its global restaurants from serving the meat of animals raised with antibiotics that are vital for fighting human infections. \nMore than 70% of medically important antibiotics in the United States are sold for livestock use. Scientists have warned that the routine use of antibiotics to promote growth and prevent illness in healthy farms animals contributes to the rise of dangerous, antibiotic-resistant “superbug” infections, which kill at least 23,000 Americans each year and pose a significant threat to global health. \nThe Congregation of Benedictine Sisters of Boerne, Texas, is asking directors at McDonald’s to prohibit the use of medically important antibiotics in its global poultry supply chain. McDonald’s already has adopted that policy for the chicken served in its U.S. restaurants. \nThe group is also asking the fast-food chain to set global targets and timelines for switching to pork and beef raised without the non-therapeutic use of medically important antibiotics. \nJust over 20% of McDonald’s shareholders voted in favor of a similar proposal at this year’s annual meeting. \nThe sisters aim to have shareholders vote on the new proposal at McDonald’s 2017 annual meeting. \nMcDonald’s told Reuters it continues “to engage with key experts, including some who serve as advisors to the World Health Organization (WHO), to advance progress across the industry.” \n\nThe company said its current policy “provides guidance to our suppliers in parts of the world where the industry does not yet have systems in place that would allow them to verify compliance throughout the supply chain.” \nThe sisters are part of the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility (ICCR), which along with ShareAction, Farm Animal Investment Risk & Return (FAIRR) Initiative and As You Sow, also are targeting companies such as Sanderson Farms and Yum Brands Inc with similar campaigns aimed at preserving the efficacy of antibiotics.

      "text": "The McDonalds festive menu is looking pretty damn fine (Picture: McDonalds) We’ve been pelted with Christmas menus left, right and centre recently and it’s getting us all tired of excited for the festive season.\nWe’ve had offerings from Eat , Pret and Nandos and now it’s the turn of our dear friend, McDonald’s.\nThe Maccas festive menu launches on 23 November and has something for everyone (except vegans, obviously. Sorry).\nHere’s a little peek at what’s in store, to test if those saliva glands of yours are still working at full capacity.\nThe Spiced Cookie Latte, complete with cute penguin cup (Picture: McDonalds) First off, we have the Spiced Cookie Latte, which was launched in restaurants last week, as a little festive tastebud teaser.\nThen we have a very fancy smoked bacon cheeseburger, going by the name of the Festive Cheese Feast.\nLevi Roots is delivering UberEATS tonight to a load of lucky Londoners Hot on its heels is the Spicy Chicken Winter Melt – a crispy chicken burger containing such delights as a slice of Emmental cheese and fire roasted red pepper sauce.\nLest we forget, we have Cheese Melt Dippers – made with Camembert and served with a festive tomato dip.\nGet your festive sugar rush right here (Picture: McDonalds) For those with a sweet tooth, you’ll soon be able to get your chops around a Chocolatey Banoffee Pie and a Terry’s Chocolate Orange McFlurry.\nI mean, it wouldn’t be Christmas without a Chocolate Orange now, would it?\n(The answer is ‘no’.)\nMcDonalds Christmas Menu 2016: Festive Cheese Feast: A 100% British and Irish beef burger with cheese, Beechwood smoked bacon, a cheese sauce, seasoned grilled onions, tomato ketchup and lettuce, all in a toasted bun.\nSpicy Chicken Winter Melt : Succulent chicken breast fillet in a crispy coating with an Emmental cheese slice, fire roasted red pepper sauce, slivered onions, a cool mayo and lettuce.\nCheese Melt Dippers : Four breaded cheese dippers, made with Camembert and served with a festive tomato dip.\nTerry’s Chocolate Orange McFlurry: Soft dairy ice cream swirled with Terry’s Chocolate Orange pieces and chocolate orange sauce.\nChocolatey Banoffee Pie: A hot crispy pie filled with a thick banoffee and chocolatey sauce.\nPrices vary depending on location. \nNow, granted, the menu isn’t particularly festive (bar the Spiced Cookie Latte), but we’re just looking at it as a sort of early Christmas present.\nDon’t forget, all this glorious food doesn’t land in restaurants until 23 November so you can work your away around the other Christmas menus until then.\nKeep an eye on the McDonald’s website for more info.\nMORE: The definitive 2016 Christmas sandwich taste test: Christmas sandwiches, ranked from worst to best \nMORE: How to get your hands on free Byron burgers and beer TONIGHT \nMORE: Café offering free burgers for life – if you get a life-size tattoo of one of their burgers ",

      "text": "Getty Images McDonalds have continued to change their profile in order to appeal to a broader market. \nSay goodbye the white metal chairs and bold red and yellow colors. The new McDonald's is sleek, muted and modern. \nMcDonald's revealed on Thursday that its U.S. restaurants will be getting a major upgrade. As part of the company's efforts to become a \"modern and progressive burger company,\" McDonald's is adding self-service ordering kiosks, craft burgers and table service to its stores. \n\"For the best part of our 60 years we've asked customers to fit around our business model,\" CEO Steve Easterbrook said. \"Now customers are more demanding and we are looking to adapt our business.\" \nMcDonald's \"experience of the future\" is currently available in about 500 of the company's 14,000 U.S. restaurants and will expand in the coming years. Boston, Washington, D.C., Chicago, San Francisco and Seattle will be the next markets to adopt McDonald's new technology and services. \nEasterbrook noted that McDonald's is focused on how customers order, what they order, how they pay and how they want to be served. The restaurants will allow for self-service kiosk ordering and counter accessibility. Customers can pay with cash, credit, debit, Apple pay and Android pay and will soon be able to order through the company's mobile service. \n\"The counter is a barrier,\" Easterbrook said. \nMcDonald's employees will now spend more time in the front of the restaurant, delivering food directly to the tables and offering traditional dining hospitality. \n\"We are investing in technology and people,\" Chris Kempczinski, incoming U.S. president of McDonald's, said. \"We want to personalize and elevate the experience for consumers in the U.S.\" \nIn addition, the company will be adding new craft burgers and chicken to its menu. The Big Mac will now come in two additional sizes, Grand and Jr., as previously announced and innovative items like a pico de gallo burger with guacamole will be joining the menu board. \nEasterbrook noted that increased customization is a key facet of building a \"better McDonald's.\" Using the self-service kiosks, customers can choose from preselected items or create their own. \nFor Easterbrook, a Quarter-Pounder with cheese, sans pickles is the ideal order. \n\"Our ambition is to accelerate on our momentum,\" he said.",

      "text": "McDonald's Win Is Only the Beginning for Wendy Clark and Omnicom \nAbout 40% of the group will come from outside of Omnicom, while the rest will come from the group's agencies including DDB, BBDO, Sparks & Honey, Critical Mass , Annalect and more, said Mr. Nienhaus, who reports into Ms. Clark. The 200-person group is probably one of the \"top 10 or 15\" largest client teams in the country, said Mr. Nienhaus, adding that AT&T's Omnicom team is around the same number. \nMr. Nienhaus, who previously led the AT&T corporate brand and business solutions accounts at Omnicom's BBDO New York, added that Mr. Hansa may bring in some other people from Publicis Groupe. \"We want to make sure we have a deep bench of McDonald's history and capabilities,\" he said. \nIn addition to Mr. Nienhaus and Mr. Hansa, Unlimited's new leadership team includes Chief Strategy Officer Graceann Bennett, who has worked at shops like Ogilvy & Mather and M&C Saatchi; Chief Digital Officer Chip Knicker, most recently managing director for Accenture's North American e-commerce practice; Chief Production Officer Jon Ellis, previously executive integrated producer at DDB; Chief Financial Officer Linda Poe, most recently CFO at Omnicom's Fathom Communications and former controller at Omnicom's Element 79 ; and Senior-VP Group Director Ursula Ostrom, previously with The Marketing Store. \nUnlimited's collaborative model includes a strategy model called The Cortex, which gives the agency a data-informed view of customers by gathering insights in real-time from experts across digital, social, retail, behavior and more, said Mr. Nienhaus. The diverse team within Unlimited will help McDonald's build anything from a tweet or long-term marketing campaign to a Super Bowl spot or in-store kiosk designs. \nDeborah Wahl, chief marketing officer, McDonald's USA, has said that along with the new agency model, her team is working on a new briefing process to make sure that they are adaptable in today's ever-changing marketing market. \n\"You have to be ready to go if something happens competitively or there's a cultural moment, you have to be ready to unleash and put messaging out there that's relevant,\" Ms. Wahl told Ad Age in October at the ANA Masters of Marketing conference. \"The big thing today is to be more flexible in the approach.\" \nShe referred to such planning as the \"foundation and plumbing\" and stressed that she wanted McDonald's and its agency partners to be more nimble and flexible. \nWhile Mr. Nienhaus wouldn't go into specific financial goals for McDonald's, he said the agency is focused on increasing guest counts and sales. He said the U.S. business is strong, but it's in a \"slow growth pace,\" which is why Unlimited has to get the chain in the growth business again. \nIn the U.S., McDonald's and other restaurants are grappling with what the Golden Arches has called \"continued industry softness.\" After two years of sales declines at longstanding U.S. restaurants, McDonald's same-store sales moved back into positive territory in the third quarter of 2015. Such sales, a key measure of health in the restaurant industry, have continued to grow in each subsequent quarter. But lately, the pace of growth has been weakening. McDonald's U.S. same-store sales soared 5.7% in the fourth quarter of 2015, buoyed by the introduction of All Day Breakfast. So far this year, McDonald's U.S. same-store sales increased 5.4% in the first quarter, 1.8% in the second quarter, and just 1.3% in the third quarter. \nMcDonald's first work under Unlimited will launch in the first quarter of 2017. At the same time, McDonald's USA will have a new leader in Chris Kempczinski, who joined McDonald's in October 2015 as exec VP-strategy, business development and innovation and is set to become the president of its U.S. business on Jan. 1. \nThe We Are Unlimited name came from the fact that the bespoke shop was built around McDonald's customers, with a focus on collaboration, leveraging data and the agency's belief \"that the human potential is limitless,\" said Mr. Nienhaus. The reason why the agency name couldn't be shortened to Unlimited was due to ownership of IP and domain name issues. \nThe agency has its own logo, featuring the abbreviated \"Unltd\" name in white above a white line within a colorful circle. \nMr. Nienhaus added that the logo, which was created by Omnicom design leaders, was created with a modern vibe so it looks \"intriguing and cool from a recruiting perspective.\" In this article:",

REUTERS/Siphiwe …\n\nBy Lisa Baertlein\n(Reuters) - A McDonald's Corp (MCD.N) shareholder is redoubling efforts to convince the fast-food chain to stop all of its global restaurants from serving the meat of animals raised with antibiotics that are vital for fighting human infections.\nMore than 70 percent of medically important antibiotics in the United States are sold for livestock use. Scientists have warned that the routine use of antibiotics to promote growth and prevent illness in healthy farms animals contributes to the rise of dangerous, antibiotic-resistant \"superbug\" infections, which kill at least 23,000 Americans each year and pose a significant threat to global health.\nThe Congregation of Benedictine Sisters of Boerne, Texas, asked directors at McDonald's to prohibit the use of medically important antibiotics in its global poultry supply chain. McDonald's already has adopted that policy for the chicken served in its U.S. restaurants. \nThe group also asking the fast-food chain to set global targets and timelines for switching to pork and beef raised without the non-therapeutic use of medically important antibiotics.\nJust over 20 percent of McDonald's shareholders voted in favour of a similar proposal at this year's annual meeting. The sisters pulled a prior resolution after McDonald's announced its plans to change its policies on chicken in the United States.\nThe sisters aim to have shareholders vote on the new proposal at McDonald's 2017 annual meeting.\n\nMcDonald's told Reuters it continues \"to engage with key experts, including some who serve as advisors to the World Health Organization (WHO), to advance progress across the industry.\" \nThe company said its current policy \"provides guidance to our suppliers in parts of the world where the industry does not yet have systems in place that would allow them to verify compliance throughout the supply chain.\"\nSister Susan Mika said the resolution is part of an ongoing process.\n\"I said we will be back,\" Mika said in a phone interview. \"We want them to set goals and to be moving in a certain direction. We expect them to be a leader in taking on these questions of our time.\" \nThe sisters are part of the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility (ICCR), which along with ShareAction, Farm Animal Investment Risk & Return (FAIRR) Initiative and As You Sow, also are targeting companies such as Sanderson Farms (SAFM.O) and Yum Brands Inc (YUM.N) with similar campaigns aimed at preserving the efficacy of antibiotics. \n\n(Reporting by Lisa Baertlein in Los Angeles; Editing by Bernadette Baum and Andrew Hay)",

      "text": "McDonald's Will Start Bringing Your Food Right to Your Table in 2017 Brand is adapting to the fast-food market By Katie Richards  18   In 2017, all U.S. McDonald's locations will be introducing table service. Shutterstock While you may have seen a number of McDonald's locations implementing table service over the last few months, the company announced today that it plans to roll out table service to all U.S. restaurants next year, CNBC reports. The company began testing this model about a year ago, having customers place their orders but rather than queuing up to the side of the registers, taking a seat and having an employee serve the orders. However, it was only tested in roughly 500 locations in cities including New York and Florida. McDonald's CEO Steve Easterbrook announced the move today, at an event in New York, according to CNBC. \"For the best part of our 60 year we've asked customers to fit around our business model. Now customers are more demanding and we are looking to adapt our business model,\" he said. The shift comes at a time when a number of fast food chains are making major changes to win over more customers, from revamping their interiors a-la KFC and Arby's, to updating the brand logo and image completely like Taco Bell. It's also another step to helping the fast-food chain McDonald's compete with fast-casual food chains like Shake Shack, Panera Bread and Sweetgreen. In the new year, more locations will also install self-serve kiosks where customers can personalize their orders without interacting with a McDonald's employee. McDonald's will also introduce mobile ordering and mobile payment in 2017. Get the Advertising & Branding newsletter: \nCheck out our other newsletters: Daily Digest",

      "text": "Email \n\nOmari Hardwick’s idea of the perfect date night has nothing to do with a candlelit dinner or a bill with a lot of zeroes at the end of it. \n“You know how you can be romantic? You can be romantic by going to a beautiful setting, sitting on a park bench and getting good ole fashioned golden arches a.k.a. McDonald’s,” he tells PEOPLE in this week’s Sexiest Man Alive issue . “That’s probably the best I can do romantically.” \nHe does, however, have other skills to spice up the night: “I can play music!” says the Power star. “I am a music-ie while my wife [Jennifer Pfautch] is a foodie, so the combination works.” \nRELATED: Double Dose of Sexy! John Stamos and Taylor Lautner Say They Have ‘Romantic Dinners’ Together \nHardwick’s modest taste is reminiscent of his humble beginnings as a struggling artist living out of his car. “[I ate] 99 cent chicken sandwiches from Jack in the Box on a regular consistency,” he says. “I don’t know necessarily if it was that healthy but it said chicken, so I ate it. It was 99 cents and I was struggling. And showering at the YMCA — that’s sexy.” Watch the full episode of Sexiest Men in the Kitchen , streaming now on People/Entertainment Weekly Network (PEN). Go to PEOPLE.com/PEN , or download the app for Apple TV, Roku, Amazon Fire TV, Xumo, Chromecast, Xfinity, iOS and Android devices. \nNow the actor keeps the refrigerators in his New York and Denver homes fully stocked with ice cream, grilled chicken, a variety of fruit, and leftovers from his favorite Manhattan restaurants. “We frequent Buddakan in the Meatpacking District, which is incredible and we tried when we first got to New York … to not repeat a restaurant. I think we counted 5,000 restaurants,” he says. “It is very hard to accomplish that goal.” \nRELATED: Milo Ventimiglia’s Sexiest Day in the Kitchen Is Too Hot to Talk About \nHe finds dining out, and food in general, sexy because of it’s “connect-ability.” \nFor more from this year’s Sexiest Man Alive — and to see who else made the cut — pick up this week’s issue of PEOPLE on newsstands Friday \n“That point of life when I learned I could cook, that always made me understand what cooks felt like feeding other people. It’s okay to receive but it’s really cool to give, so food is to me sexy because it’s the fact that someone is giving it to someone else,” he says. “It ends up being something that figuratively brings folks together but also physically brings people together.” Show Full Article",

      "text": "To entice consumers, McDonald’s tests Sriracha, Nutella By Kevin Allen   Tweet \nMillennials are said to love Sriracha sauce. McDonald’s wants millennials to love its burgers. Can you picture what might be in the middle of that Venn diagram? \nMcDonald’s will expand its test of a Sriracha Big Mac. Ohio is the latest market to be graced with its spiciness, with 126 restaurants making available their Sriracha Big Mac sauce for burgers or fry/nugget dipping. \nThis is the first Sriracha Big Mac test off the West Coast. Previously, it hit markets in Los Angeles, San Diego and Seattle. With any McDonald’s test item, it’s possible that it could see nationwide rollout. \nIn Italy, the company is testing another new burger product—this time on the dessert side. \nDubbed the “Sweety,” Italian McDonald’s now offers Nutella in between two burger buns. \nTwitter users have taken note, and their reactions are mixed: Why did I ever leave #Italy ? This would be the only thing to make me eat @McDonalds ! #nutella #nutellaburger @NutellaUSA #foodie https://t.co/ol0VpbcOZC",

      "text": "(Phil Rosenthal) \nThe changes will be funded in large part by the franchisees that operate McDonald's restaurants, but the company said it will chip in in some ways as well. It's not clear exactly how much the remodels will cost, and the price will vary depending on what technology the restaurant currently offers. An ordering kiosk alone can cost $60,000. \nMcDonald's also didn't reveal how long it would take to redesign all of its restaurants nationwide. It will start the process in Chicago and a handful of other large U.S. cities, including Boston and Washington, D.C. \nThe redesigns will include the option of ordering at a kiosk, though counter service also will be available. A customer takes a number from the kiosk after paying and an employee brings the food to their table. Customers can pay at the kiosks using a credit or debit card, or Apple or Android pay. Separately, the chain plans to roll out mobile ordering nationwide next year. \nSince the mid-1950s, McDonald's has been synonymous with burgers and fries in the U.S. Now it has more than 36,000 stores in 120 countries. Here's what you can find at Mickey D's around the world.

      "text": "print \nMcDonald's new Signature Crafted burgers represent an effort to convince guest's of McDonald's quality. Hollis Johnson \nMcDonald's announced on Thursday that the fast-food giant plans to roll out table service at all locations across the US. \nThe fast-food giant has begun the process of implementing table service across all 14,000 American locations. With the new system, customers can place orders using a digital kiosk or at the counter, and then choose to either pick up their food to-go or have meals served to them at tables. \n\"For the best part of our 16 years, we've asked customers to work around our business model,\" CEO Steve Easterbrook said in a media event on Thursday. \"But now, customers are more demanding, and we're looking to evolve our business.\" \nCurrently, McDonald's offers table service in more than 500 US locations in New York City, Florida, and Southern California. The company is rolling out table service in Washington DC, Boston, Chicago, San Francisco, and Seattle in early 2017. \nBeyond that, McDonald's does not have a set timeline for the roll out, though McDonald's incoming US president Chris Kempczinski said the chain plans to move as \"quickly as possible\" after collecting data from test markets. \nGlobally, the fast-food chain offers the service in 2,600 locations, in countries including Canada, France, and China. \nWith table service, customers can order at the kiosk, then take a number and have servers deliver their meals to their tables. Kate Taylor \nIn test markets, McDonald's executives said that table service has been particularly popular with large groups and families. \n\"Taking your kids to McDonald's should be a fundamentally... fun experience,\"Easterbrook said. \"But, the initial stages of it can be quite stressful when you're trying to place the order, you're trying to get it right, you're trying to get the drinks, you're trying to search for a table, and your kids are running around.\" \nMcDonald's table service roll out is part of a wider effort to improve customer experience. \nMcDonald's is introducing mobile ordering next year, testing the service in the first half of 2017 and implementing it nationally in the second half of the year. Along with table service, the chain is also rolling out kiosk service to more locations. \nWhile kiosks and mobile ordering are frequently associated with decreasing labor costs, McDonald's says that its investments in tech do not mean the chain will cut employees. In Canada, where McDonald's has nearly completed its national roll out of kiosks and table service, the company says locations' employee counts have remained roughly stable, with more employees serving food as fewer are needed to take orders. \nMcDonald's will be rolling out kiosks at more locations. Hollis Johnson \nMcDonald's is also revamping its menu with an emphasis on higher-quality items like Signature Crafted burgers and redesigning locations to look more modern. \n\"This is not about being a different McDonald's, this is about being a better McDonald's,\" Easterbrook said. \nAccording to executives, these changes represent a new \"restless energy,\" and that the chain hopes to accelerate the implementation of new innovation in the future. In October, McDonald's reported a 1.3% growth in US same-store sales in the third quarter, the company's fifth consecutive quarter of growth in the US and globally. \n\"It's a totally different mindset to which we are adapting,\" said Easterbrook. \"This is not one and done.\"",

The latest recognition comes in the form of two awards: a Gold for Data Driven Marketing and a Bronze for Loyalty Marketing from Marketing Magazine's Annual Marketing Excellence Awards ( http://www.marketing-interactive.com/mea-awards/sg/winners/ ). This will be the sixth award for their analytical and strategic work with the McDonald's McDelivery Program, which was recognized earlier this year with a prestigious Gold Appie for Best Campaign in their category, as well as Best Presenter for Dr. Urvashi's Pitre and her business case presentation. \nAs a data-driven, CRM strategy firm, Tasseologic partnered with McDonald's to tap into predictive logic that up sold and boosted incremental sales within McDelivery, a home-delivery service offered by the QSR giant, and laid the foundation for continued success in this ecommerce channel. Using delivery data, the team built consumer models and customized offers that increased both orders and order sizes. These models were the cornerstone for a custom-built, mass personalization plan that allowed McDonald's to maintain guest count and protect falloff at a positive ROI. \nSee the program here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7xTs0lkXII \n\"After winning the Appie on top of the Loyalty and Engagement Awards and now this recognition, we continue to be honored with these awards, but also know that the work we do is meaningful and that the industry values our thinking,\" shares Dr. Urvashi Pitre . \"Our success is based upon the idea that with whether it's big data or small data, brands can be more relevant to their consumer base and demonstrate ROI. We've had amazing support with the McDonald's team who believes in the power of data and CRM. And believes in us.\" \nAbout Tasseologic \nTasseologic is a data-driven marketing strategy company.
