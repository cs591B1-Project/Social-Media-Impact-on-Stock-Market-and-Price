      "text": "Three-Time WTCC Champ Jose Maria Lopez Switches To Toyota LMP1 | By Share You may not recognize the name off-hand, but Jose Maria Lopez is one of the most dominant drivers racing today. He has, after all, won the World Touring Car Championship three years running. But now he's switching to Le Mans prototypes, where he's expected to drive for Toyota . Once a Renault F1 prodigy, Lopez has a wealth of experience in a variety of racing disciplines. Aside from the WTCC which he's dominated with Citroën for the past three years, he's competed in an array of GT cars, won a GP2 race, and is currently competing in Formula E . But WTCC has been his main gig since 2014, and with Citroën now shutting down its program to focus on the World Rally Championship, Lopez is looking elsewhere. According to Autosport , he's already signed a contract with Toyota to drive its front-running LMP1, having kicked off a series of tests with the team last winter. Though the Japanese outfit has yet to win the 24 Hours of Le Mans, it took both titles in the 2014 FIA World Endurance Championship – putting it up there with the likes of Porsche and Audi. With the latter now leaving the series , there's bound to be a number of experienced drivers on the market. But it appears that, while it may not be announced until after the start of the new year, Lopez and Toyota may have already signed before Audi's announcement was made. Photo Gallery",

It maintained its forecast for full-year operating profit at 1.6 trillion yen, which would be its lowest since 2013. ($1 = 104.3500 yen) (Reporting by Naomi Tajitsu; Editing by Christopher Cushing)",

      "title": "Toyota profit tumbles on strong yen, but lifts full-year view",
      "text": "More Toyota said on Tuesday its April-September net profit dived 25 percent, hit by a sharp rally in the yen and as North American vehicle sales fell again, but it upgraded its full-year outlook. The world's biggest vehicle maker reported a net profit of 946.1 billion yen ($9.1 billion) in the first half of its fiscal year, down from 1.25 trillion yen in the same period last year. Operating profit fell nearly 30 percent to 1.11 trillion yen, while revenue was off 7.2 percent at 13.07 trillion yen. However, the Japanese automaker boosted its full-year to March net profit forecast to 1.55 trillion yen from an earlier 1.45 trillion yen estimate. \"Despite the positive factors such as cost reduction and marketing efforts, operating income was down... due to the significant impact of yen appreciation,\" Toyota said in a statement. The decline in Toyota's profits underscore the negative impact that a resurgent currency has had on firms doing a lot of business abroad. Japan's exporters reaped windfall profits over the past few years as government efforts to kickstart the world's number three economy sharply weakened the yen. That was good for firms such as Toyota and rivals Honda and Nissan because repatriated foreign profits were worth more when the yen was weak and because it boosted their competitiveness overseas. But the currency has rallied since the start of the year as volatile equity markets and Britain's vote to exit the European Union boosted demand for a unit widely seen as a safe investment. Reblog",

      "title": "Toyota second-quarter operating profit tumbles on strong yen",
      "text": "Tweet Share A visitor looks at Toyota Motor Corp's Aqua hybrid car at the company's showroom in Tokyo, Japan June 14, 2016. REUTERS/Toru Hanai/File Photo More TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> on Tuesday said operating profit almost halved in the second quarter as the world's top-selling automaker smarted from a strong yen that has made its Japan-built cars less competitive and crimped the value of overseas earnings. Operating profit fell 43 percent to 474.6 billion yen (4 billion pounds) in the July-September period compared with a year earlier. The result was roughly in line with the 476.26 billion yen average of 12 estimates from analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. While all Japanese automakers are feeling the currency pinch, Toyota is more exposed to swings in foreign exchange because it produces two-fifths of its vehicles in Japan, half of which it exports. The latest yen squeeze also comes as sales in North America, one the world's biggest auto markets, slow after record sales in 2015 that automakers and analysts saw as the peak of the U.S. recovery from the 2008-2009 economic crisis. Cheap fuel is also spurring demand for petrol-guzzling models leaving Japanese automakers struggling to raise production of sport utility vehicles and trucks. Toyota has said it will make more of those larger vehicles including its popular RAV4 crossover model in the United States, to take advantage of that shift in consumer preference. On Tuesday, Toyota also changed its full-year budgeted yen rate to 103 versus the U.S. dollar and 114 to the euro, from 102 and 113 respectively. It lifted its forecast for full-year operating profit to 1.7 trillion yen from 1.6 trillion yen, which would be its lowest since 2013.

      "text": "Grow Your Business Strong yen sends Toyota's quarterly profit sinking 36 pct \nTOKYO (AP) - Toyota Motor Corp. says July-September profit sank 36 percent, hammered by the strong yen, which erodes the overseas earnings of Japanese exporters. \nThe Japanese automaker reported Tuesday that fiscal second quarter profit totaled 393.7 billion yen ($3.8 billion), down from 611.7 billion yen the same period the previous year. \nQuarterly sales slipped nearly 9 percent to 6.48 trillion yen ($62.3 billion). \nThe manufacturer of the Prius hybrid, Camry sedan and Lexus luxury model expects to sell 10.1 trillion vehicles worldwide through March 2017, including sales by affiliates Hino Motors and Daihatsu Motor Co. \nToyota raised its annual profit forecast to 1.5 trillion yen ($14.4 billion) from an earlier 1.45 trillion yen ($13.9 billion). But that's still below the 2.3 trillion yen it earned last year. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.

REUTERS/Toru Hanai/File Photo - RTSKYTG \nTOKYO Toyota Motor Corp ( 7203.T ) on Tuesday said operating profit almost halved in the second quarter as the world's top-selling automaker smarted from a strong yen that has made its Japan-built cars less competitive and crimped the value of overseas earnings. \nOperating profit fell 43 percent to 474.6 billion yen ($4.55 billion) in the July-September period compared with a year earlier. The result was roughly in line with the 476.26 billion yen average of 12 estimates from analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. \nWhile all Japanese automakers are feeling the currency pinch, Toyota is more exposed to swings in foreign exchange because it produces two-fifths of its vehicles in Japan, half of which it exports. \nThe latest yen squeeze also comes as sales in North America, one the world's biggest auto markets, slow after record sales in 2015 that automakers and analysts saw as the peak of the U.S. recovery from the 2008-2009 economic crisis. \nCheap fuel is also spurring demand for petrol-guzzling models leaving Japanese automakers struggling to raise production of sport utility vehicles and trucks. \nToyota has said it will make more of those larger vehicles including its popular RAV4 crossover model in the United States, to take advantage of that shift in consumer preference. \nOn Tuesday, Toyota also changed its full-year budgeted yen rate to 103 versus the U.S. dollar and 114 to the euro, from 102 and 113 respectively. It lifted its forecast for full-year operating profit to 1.7 trillion yen from 1.6 trillion yen, which would be its lowest since 2013. \n($1 = 104.3900 yen) \n(Reporting by Naomi Tajitsu; Editing by Christopher Cushing) Next In Japan",

      "text": "Sources reveal that Toyota expects to mass produce long-range electric vehicles that should hit the market by the year 2020.\nWith this move, it is apparent that the car maker intends to have long-range EVs lead the way in the future as the favourable substitute to traditional cars. Toyota has always looked up to FCVs (fuel cell vehicle) in the past owing to similar range and refuelling time in comparison to conventional cars, however, the lack of hydrogen fuelling stations is considered a major hurdle.\nToyota is looking to build a team in 2017 to develop EVs with a range of 300km on a single charge, and is presently analysing if the new EVs should be based on the Prius hybrid platform, or the Corolla’s. Toyota aims to sell long-range EVs in Japan by 2020 before spreading it to other markets like California, where the law requires them to sell a definite amount of zero-emission cars.\nWe shall share more information in the months to come, so stay tuned to Carwale.",

But that's still below the 2.3 trillion yen it earned last year. Related content",

      "text": "Toyota Lifts Profit Forecast as Stable Yen Improves Outlook Craig Trudell and Masatsugu Horie November 8, 2016 — 1:04 AM EST Updated on Carmaker to buy back up to 1.31% of shares for 200 billion yen Global sales lead at risk on U.S. market peak, Prius struggles Share on Facebook \nToyota Motor Corp. raised its profit forecast for this fiscal year as the yen’s rally stopped short of levels that the automaker had predicted, providing some respite from a sales slowdown that’s threatening its position as the world’s top seller. \nOperating profit will probably be 1.7 trillion yen ($16.3 billion) for the year ending in March, compared with the 1.6 trillion-yen forecast the Toyota City, Japan-based company made in August. Net income for the quarter ended September fell to 393.7 billion yen, beating analysts’ estimates. \nA peaking U.S. auto market, tepid demand for the new Prius hybrid and a dearth of other major new models in its showrooms have dragged Toyota behind scandal-hit Volkswagen AG in global deliveries this year. The stronger yen is also reducing the value of record deliveries of RAV4 and other sport utility vehicles in overseas markets and making exports of Japan-made Prius and Lexus luxury vehicles less competitive. \n“Toyota’s results continue to be burdened by the weight of the yen headwind and a less than robust new product year,” Matthew Stover, a Boston-based equity analyst Susquehanna Financial Group, wrote in an Oct. 24 report. \nWeaker earnings aren’t keeping Toyota from continuing to return some of its hefty cash pile to shareholders. Toyota said it will buy back up to 1.31 percent of shares for 200 billion yen, the company said in a statement Tuesday. Demand Plateau \nToyota is now operating with the assumption that future expansion of the global auto market will entail plateauing or shrinking developed markets, balanced by higher demand in emerging countries, Chief Competitive Officer Didier Leroy told reporters last month. \n“If you consider the next, let’s say 20 years, the growth of the business for the automotive industry will not come from more and more sales,” Leroy said. “It will come from a lot of other services,” including car- and ride-sharing, connectivity and data management. \nThe technological shake-up has spurred Toyota to form a series of alliances. The carmaker made small investments in ride-sharing leader Uber Technologies Inc. in May and car-sharing startup Getaround Inc. last month and will begin pilots with both companies by early next year. \nToyota has been discussing at least 10 different areas for deeper cooperation with Mazda Motor Corp., from electric vehicles to connected cars. President Akio Toyoda has also been exploring joint research and development with Suzuki Motor Corp. that could cover similar fields. Prius Redesign \nAs for its current lineup, Toyota’s newly redesigned Prius that began production in late 2015 has been struggling in the U.S., with deliveries dropping 12 percent this year through October. Sales for the entire Prius family have plunged 28 percent when including older versions and the plug-in hybrid that recently returned from hiatus . \nThe trend is alarming for a model line that was in decline for several years leading up to a substantial overhaul, with Toyota promising a sportier ride and improved safety and tech features. Prius has instead been the most significant drag on a passenger-car lineup in U.S. that’s seen sales decline 10 percent so far this year. \nThe next significant new model Toyota has will be the C-HR compact SUV, which will join a rapidly expanding segment that includes Honda Motor Co.’s Vezel and Nissan Motor Co.’s Juke. Dealers in Japan began to take orders for C-HR early this month. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal. LEARN MORE",

      "text": "By YURI KAGEYAMA - 11/8/16 2:46 AM \nTOKYO — Toyota Motor Corp. reported Tuesday that its July-September profit sank 36 percent as a stronger yen eroded its overseas earnings. \nLagging sales also pinched the Japanese automaker’s fiscal second quarter profit, which fell to 393.7 billion yen ($3.8 billion) from 611.7 billion yen in the same period the previous year. \nQuarterly sales slipped nearly 9 percent to 6.48 trillion yen ($62.3 billion). \nThe manufacturer of the Prius hybrid, Camry sedan and Lexus luxury models expects to sell 10.1 million vehicles worldwide through March 2017, including sales by affiliates Hino Motors and Daihatsu Motor Co. \nToyota has led world vehicle sales in recent years but this year is vying with German automaker Volkswagen AG and General Motors Co., which also expect to sell about 10 million vehicles globally, for the top spot. \nVolkswagen’s global vehicle sales surpassed Toyota’s in the first half of the year despite a scandal over cars it rigged to cheat on U.S. diesel emissions tests. \nToyota raised its annual profit forecast to 1.5 trillion yen ($14.4 billion) from an earlier 1.45 trillion yen ($13.9 billion). But that’s still below the 2.3 trillion yen it earned last year. \nToyota said that for the first fiscal half, it carried out cost reductions that added 220 billion yen ($2.1 billion) to the company’s operating profit, but the unfavorable currency fluctuations erased 565 billion yen ($5.4 billion). \nFollow Yuri Kageyama on Twitter at https://twitter.com/yurikageyama \nHer work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/content/yuri-kageyama",

Toyota Motor Corp. reported Tuesday, Nov. 8, 2016, that July-September profit sank 36 percent, hammered by the strong yen, which erodes the overseas earnings of Japanese exporters. Lagging sales also helped send the Japanese automaker’s fiscal second quarter profit lower to 393.7 billion yen ($3.8 billion), down from 611.7 billion yen the same period the previous year. Eugene Hoshiko, File AP Photo i   TOKYO \nToyota Motor Corp. reported Tuesday that its July-September profit sank 36 percent as a stronger yen eroded its overseas earnings. \nLagging sales also pinched the Japanese automaker's fiscal second quarter profit, which fell to 393.7 billion yen ($3.8 billion) from 611.7 billion yen in the same period the previous year. \nQuarterly sales slipped nearly 9 percent to 6.48 trillion yen ($62.3 billion). \nThe manufacturer of the Prius hybrid, Camry sedan and Lexus luxury models expects to sell 10.1 million vehicles worldwide through March 2017, including sales by affiliates Hino Motors and Daihatsu Motor Co. \nToyota has led world vehicle sales in recent years but this year is vying with German automaker Volkswagen AG and General Motors Co., which also expect to sell about 10 million vehicles globally, for the top spot. \nVolkswagen's global vehicle sales surpassed Toyota's in the first half of the year despite a scandal over cars it rigged to cheat on U.S. diesel emissions tests. \nToyota raised its annual profit forecast to 1.5 trillion yen ($14.4 billion) from an earlier 1.45 trillion yen ($13.9 billion). But that's still below the 2.3 trillion yen it earned last year. \nToyota said that in the first fiscal half, it carried out cost reductions that added 220 billion yen ($2.1 billion) to the company's operating profit, but the unfavorable currency fluctuations erased 565 billion yen ($5.4 billion). \n--- \nFollow Yuri Kageyama on Twitter at https://twitter.com/yurikageyama \nHer work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/content/yuri-kageyama Related content",

      "text": "Strong yen sends Toyota's quarterly profit sinking 36 pct By Yuri Kageyama ,   8th, 2016 @ 1:10am 0  \nTOKYO (AP) — Toyota Motor Corp. reported Tuesday that its July-September profit sank 36 percent as a stronger yen eroded its overseas earnings. \nLagging sales also pinched the Japanese automaker's fiscal second quarter profit, which fell to 393.7 billion yen ($3.8 billion) from 611.7 billion yen in the same period the previous year. \nQuarterly sales slipped nearly 9 percent to 6.48 trillion yen ($62.3 billion). \nThe manufacturer of the Prius hybrid, Camry sedan and Lexus luxury models expects to sell 10.1 million vehicles worldwide through March 2017, including sales by affiliates Hino Motors and Daihatsu Motor Co. \nToyota has led world vehicle sales in recent years but this year is vying with German automaker Volkswagen AG and General Motors Co., which also expect to sell about 10 million vehicles globally, for the top spot. \nVolkswagen's global vehicle sales surpassed Toyota's in the first half of the year despite a scandal over cars it rigged to cheat on U.S. diesel emissions tests. \nToyota raised its annual profit forecast to 1.5 trillion yen ($14.4 billion) from an earlier 1.45 trillion yen ($13.9 billion). But that's still below the 2.3 trillion yen it earned last year. \nToyota said that in the first fiscal half, it carried out cost reductions that added 220 billion yen ($2.1 billion) to the company's operating profit, but the unfavorable currency fluctuations erased 565 billion yen ($5.4 billion). \n___ \nFollow Yuri Kageyama on Twitter at https://twitter.com/yurikageyama \nHer work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/content/yuri-kageyama \n  0 Pending",

      "text": "TOKYO -- Toyota Motor Corp. reported Tuesday that its July-September profit sank 36 percent as a stronger yen eroded its overseas earnings. Lagging sales also pinched the Japanese automaker's fiscal second quarter profit, which fell to 393.7 billion yen ($3.8 billion) from 611.7 billion yen in the same period the previous year. Quarterly sales slipped nearly 9 percent to 6.48 trillion yen ($62.3 billion). The manufacturer of the Prius hybrid, Camry sedan and Lexus luxury models expects to sell 10.1 million vehicles worldwide through March 2017, including sales by affiliates Hino Motors and Daihatsu Motor Co. Toyota has led world vehicle sales in recent years but this year is vying with German automaker Volkswagen AG and General Motors Co., which also expect to sell about 10 million vehicles globally, for the top spot. Volkswagen's global vehicle sales surpassed Toyota's in the first half of the year despite a scandal over cars it rigged to cheat on U.S. diesel emissions tests. Toyota raised its annual profit forecast to 1.5 trillion yen ($14.4 billion) from an earlier 1.45 trillion yen ($13.9 billion). But that's still below the 2.3 trillion yen it earned last year. Toyota said that for the first fiscal half, it carried out cost reductions that added 220 billion yen ($2.1 billion) to the company's operating profit, but the unfavorable currency fluctuations erased 565 billion yen ($5.4 billion). ___ Follow Yuri Kageyama on Twitter at https://twitter.com/yurikageyama Her work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/content/yuri-kageyama",

Toyota Motor Corp. reported Tuesday, Nov. 8, 2016, that July-September profit sank 36 percent, hammered by the strong yen, which erodes the overseas earnings of Japanese exporters.

Lagging sales also pinched the Japanese automaker's fiscal second quarter profit, which fell to 393.7 billion yen ($3.8 billion) from 611.7 billion yen in the same period the previous year. Quarterly sales slipped nearly 9 percent to 6.48 trillion yen ($62.3 billion). The manufacturer of the Prius hybrid, Camry sedan and Lexus luxury models expects to sell 10.1 million vehicles worldwide through March 2017, including sales by affiliates Hino Motors and Daihatsu Motor Co. Toyota has led world vehicle sales in recent years but this year is vying with German automaker Volkswagen AG and General Motors Co., which also expect to sell about 10 million vehicles globally, for the top spot. Volkswagen's global vehicle sales surpassed Toyota's in the first half of the year despite a scandal over cars it rigged to cheat on U.S. diesel emissions tests. Toyota raised its annual profit forecast to 1.5 trillion yen ($14.4 billion) from an earlier 1.45 trillion yen ($13.9 billion). But that's still below the 2.3 trillion yen it earned last year. Toyota said that in the first fiscal half, it carried out cost reductions that added 220 billion yen ($2.1 billion) to the company's operating profit, but the unfavorable currency fluctuations erased 565 billion yen ($5.4 billion). ___ Follow Yuri Kageyama on Twitter at https://twitter.com/yurikageyama Her work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/content/yuri-kageyama Today's Deals",

      "text": "A \nTOKYO: Toyota said on Tuesday (Nov 8) its April-September net profit dived 25 per cent, hit by a sharp rally in the yen and another fall in North American sales, but it upgraded its full-year outlook. \nThe world's biggest automaker reported a net profit of ¥946.1 billion (US$9.1 billion) in the first half of its fiscal year, down from ¥1.25 trillion in the same period in 2015. \nOperating profit fell nearly 30 per cent to ¥1.11 trillion, while revenue was off 7.2 per cent at ¥13.07 trillion. \nHowever the Corolla and Prius hybrid maker boosted its full-year to March net profit forecast to ¥1.55 trillion from an earlier ¥1.45 trillion estimate. \nThe newest figure is still way down from a record ¥2.31 trillion net profit in the most recently ended business year. \nThe decline in profits underscores the negative impact that a resurgent currency has had on firms doing much of their business abroad. \nJapan's exporters reaped windfall profits over the past few years as government efforts to kickstart the world's number three economy sharply weakened the yen. \nThat was good for firms such as Toyota and rivals Honda and Nissan because repatriated foreign profits were worth more when the yen was weak and because it boosted their competitiveness overseas. \nBut the currency has rallied since the start of the year as volatile equity markets and Britain's vote to exit the European Union boosted demand for a unit widely seen as a safe investment. \n\"The yen's strength remains a major factor squeezing earnings in the Japanese auto sector,\" said Shigeru Matsumura, analyst at SMBC Friend Research Center, before the results were published. \n\"Japanese carmakers need to make further efforts to make their corporate structure more resistant to the yen's appreciation,\" he added. \nRECALLS, QUAKES \nToyota's vehicle sales in April-September ticked up to 5.06 million units, from 4.97 million vehicles in the same period last year, with increases in Japan, Europe and Asia. \nStill, vehicle sales fell in the Middle East, Africa and the key North American market, where cheap oil has hit demand for Toyota's fuel-efficient offerings including the Prius. \nThe North American sales drop was due to a \"drastic shift\" in demand from passenger cars to SUVs and trucks, the firm said. \nJapanese automakers have benefited from healthy growth in the US where low interest rates boosted demand, although a possible rise in borrowing costs this year could erode sales. \nUnsteady demand in emerging markets such as Thailand and Indonesia are also red flags, as Toyota and other major automakers wrestle with costs linked to a huge scandal at supplier Takata. \nA defect in the firm's airbags has been linked to more than a dozen deaths and scores of injuries globally, prompting the auto industry's biggest ever safety recall to replace the problem parts and meaning huge expenses for automakers. \nAutomakers were also hit by temporary factory shutdowns in the south of Japan after a pair of earthquakes caused major damage and claimed dozens of lives in April, affecting production. \nStiff competition at home and abroad has pushed some Japanese automakers to eye tie-ups. \nToyota and small car maker Suzuki said last month they were holding talks about a possible partnership. \nToyota said the possible deal was prompted by the fact that it trails competitors in North America and Europe in some areas, while Suzuki is struggling to forge its own path in the fiercely competitive industry. \nNissan is buying a one-third stake in Mitsubishi Motors, forging an alliance that will challenge some of the world's biggest auto groups. \nOn Monday Nissan said net profit in the April-September period fell 13.3 per cent to ¥282.4 billion, the first decline over that six-month span in four years. \nLast week Honda said its net profit rose 12.1 per cent from the same period in 2015 to ¥351.8 billion, as cost cuts offset the impact of the rising yen. - AFP/ec",

      "text": "Strong yen sends Toyota's quarterly profit sinking 36 pct Posted: Updated: Tuesday,   By YURI KAGEYAMAAP Business Writer \nTOKYO (AP) - Toyota Motor Corp. reported Tuesday that its July-September profit sank 36 percent as a stronger yen eroded its overseas earnings. \nLagging sales also pinched the Japanese automaker's fiscal second quarter profit, which fell to 393.7 billion yen ($3.8 billion) from 611.7 billion yen in the same period the previous year. \nQuarterly sales slipped nearly 9 percent to 6.48 trillion yen ($62.3 billion). \nThe manufacturer of the Prius hybrid, Camry sedan and Lexus luxury models expects to sell 10.1 million vehicles worldwide through March 2017, including sales by affiliates Hino Motors and Daihatsu Motor Co. \nToyota has led world vehicle sales in recent years but this year is vying with German automaker Volkswagen AG and General Motors Co., which also expect to sell about 10 million vehicles globally, for the top spot. \nVolkswagen's global vehicle sales surpassed Toyota's in the first half of the year despite a scandal over cars it rigged to cheat on U.S. diesel emissions tests. \nToyota raised its annual profit forecast to 1.5 trillion yen ($14.4 billion) from an earlier 1.45 trillion yen ($13.9 billion). But that's still below the 2.3 trillion yen it earned last year. \nToyota said that in the first fiscal half, it carried out cost reductions that added 220 billion yen ($2.1 billion) to the company's operating profit, but the unfavorable currency fluctuations erased 565 billion yen ($5.4 billion). \n___ \nFollow Yuri Kageyama on Twitter at https://twitter.com/yurikageyama \nHer work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/content/yuri-kageyama  ",

      "text": "Tue, Nov 8, 2016, 8:46 PM AEDT - Australia Markets closed Toyota profit falls 42% due to weak sales AAP – 2 hours 13 minutes ago Recommend View Photo \n\nToyota's operating profit for the July-to-September quarter dropped 42.6 per cent from a year earlier to 474.6 billion yen ($A5.8 billion), the company says. \nJapan's largest carmaker also booked a net profit of 393.7 billion yen for the fiscal second quarter, down 35.6 per cent from the same period the previous year, while sales declined 8.8 per cent to 6.48 trillion yen. \nThe yen has climbed about 13 per cent against the US dollar this year, which makes Japanese products less appealing overseas and hurts the earnings of Japan's exporters. \nToyota, however, lifted its operating profit outlook for the current financial year to March 2017 to 1.7 trillion yen, from its previous estimate of 1.6 trillion. It also boosted its net profit forecast to 1.55 trillion yen, up from 1.45 trillion yen. \nThe carmaker maintained its sales outlook at 26 trillion yen.  ",

Photo: EPA \nTOKYO - Toyota said on Tuesday its April-September net profit dived 25 percent, hit by a sharp rally in the yen and as North American vehicle sales fell again, but it upgraded its full-year outlook. \nThe world's biggest vehicle maker reported a net profit of 946.1 billion yen ($9.1-billion) in the first half of its fiscal year, down from 1.25 trillion yen in the same period last year. \nOperating profit fell nearly 30 percent to 1.11 trillion yen, while revenue was off 7.2 percent at 13.07 trillion yen. \nHowever, the Japanese automaker boosted its full-year to March net profit forecast to 1.55 trillion yen from an earlier 1.45 trillion yen estimate. \n\"Despite the positive factors such as cost reduction and marketing efforts, operating income was down... due to the significant impact of yen appreciation,\" Toyota said in a statement. \nThe decline in Toyota's profits underscore the negative impact that a resurgent currency has had on firms doing a lot of business abroad. \nJapan's exporters reaped windfall profits over the past few years as government efforts to kickstart the world's number three economy sharply weakened the yen. \nThat was good for firms such as Toyota and rivals Honda and Nissan because repatriated foreign profits were worth more when the yen was weak and because it boosted their competitiveness overseas. \nBut the currency has rallied since the start of the year as volatile equity markets and Britain's vote to exit the European Union boosted demand for a unit widely seen as a safe investment.

(AP Photo/Eugene Hoshiko, File) By YURI KAGEYAMA The Associated Press TOKYO — \nToyota Motor Corp. reported Tuesday that its July-September profit sank 36 percent as a stronger yen eroded its overseas earnings. \nLagging sales also pinched the Japanese automaker's fiscal second quarter profit, which fell to 393.7 billion yen ($3.8 billion) from 611.7 billion yen in the same period the previous year. \nQuarterly sales slipped nearly 9 percent to 6.48 trillion yen ($62.3 billion). \nThe manufacturer of the Prius hybrid, Camry sedan and Lexus luxury models expects to sell 10.1 million vehicles worldwide through March 2017, including sales by affiliates Hino Motors and Daihatsu Motor Co. \nToyota has led world vehicle sales in recent years but this year is vying with German automaker Volkswagen AG and General Motors Co., which also expect to sell about 10 million vehicles globally, for the top spot. \nVolkswagen's global vehicle sales surpassed Toyota's in the first half of the year despite a scandal over cars it rigged to cheat on U.S. diesel emissions tests. \nToyota raised its annual profit forecast to 1.5 trillion yen ($14.4 billion) from an earlier 1.45 trillion yen ($13.9 billion). But that's still below the 2.3 trillion yen it earned last year. \nToyota said that in the first fiscal half, it carried out cost reductions that added 220 billion yen ($2.1 billion) to the company's operating profit, but the unfavorable currency fluctuations erased 565 billion yen ($5.4 billion). \n___ \nFollow Yuri Kageyama on Twitter at https://twitter.com/yurikageyama \nHer work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/content/yuri-kageyama Copyright The Associated Press \n ",

But that's still below the 2.3 trillion yen it earned last year. \nToyota said that in the first fiscal half, it carried out cost reductions that added 220 billion yen ($2.1 billion) to the company's operating profit, but the unfavorable currency fluctuations erased 565 billion yen ($5.4 billion). \n___ \nFollow Yuri Kageyama on Twitter at https://twitter.com/yurikageyama \nHer work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/content/yuri-kageyama \nCopyright 2016 by The Associated Press.

Toyota Motor Corp. reported Tuesday, Nov. 8, 2016, that July-September profit sank 36 percent, hammered by the strong yen, which erodes the overseas earnings of Japanese exporters.

(AP Photo/Eugene Hoshiko, File) TOKYO Toyota Motor Corp. reported Tuesday that its July-September profit sank 36 percent as a stronger yen eroded its overseas earnings. Lagging sales also pinched the Japanese automaker's fiscal second quarter profit, which fell to 393.7 billion yen ($3.8 billion) from 611.7 billion yen in the same period the previous year. Quarterly sales slipped nearly 9 percent to 6.48 trillion yen ($62.3 billion). The manufacturer of the Prius hybrid, Camry sedan and Lexus luxury models expects to sell 10.1 million vehicles worldwide through March 2017, including sales by affiliates Hino Motors and Daihatsu Motor Co. Toyota has led world vehicle sales in recent years but this year is vying with German automaker Volkswagen AG and General Motors Co., which also expect to sell about 10 million vehicles globally, for the top spot. Volkswagen's global vehicle sales surpassed Toyota's in the first half of the year despite a scandal over cars it rigged to cheat on U.S. diesel emissions tests. Toyota raised its annual profit forecast to 1.5 trillion yen ($14.4 billion) from an earlier 1.45 trillion yen ($13.9 billion). But that's still below the 2.3 trillion yen it earned last year. Toyota said that in the first fiscal half, it carried out cost reductions that added 220 billion yen ($2.1 billion) to the company's operating profit, but the unfavorable currency fluctuations erased 565 billion yen ($5.4 billion). ___ Follow Yuri Kageyama on Twitter at https://twitter.com/yurikageyama Her work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/content/yuri-kageyama View Comments 0 Sign up for e-newsletters Want more news?

      "text": "TOKYO Toyota Motor Corp. reported Tuesday that its July-September profit sank 36 percent as a stronger yen eroded its overseas earnings.\nLagging sales also pinched the Japanese automaker's fiscal second quarter profit, which fell to 393.7 billion yen ($3.8 billion) from 611.7 billion yen in the same period the previous year.\nQuarterly sales slipped nearly 9 percent to 6.48 trillion yen ($62.3 billion).\nThe manufacturer of the Prius hybrid, Camry sedan and Lexus luxury models expects to sell 10.1 million vehicles worldwide through March 2017, including sales by affiliates Hino Motors and Daihatsu Motor Co.\nToyota has led world vehicle sales in recent years but this year is vying with German automaker Volkswagen AG and General Motors Co., which also expect to sell about 10 million vehicles globally, for the top spot.\nVolkswagen's global vehicle sales surpassed Toyota's in the first half of the year despite a scandal over cars it rigged to cheat on U.S. diesel emissions tests.\nToyota raised its annual profit forecast to 1.5 trillion yen ($14.4 billion) from an earlier 1.45 trillion yen ($13.9 billion). But that's still below the 2.3 trillion yen it earned last year.\nToyota said that in the first fiscal half, it carried out cost reductions that added 220 billion yen ($2.1 billion) to the company's operating profit, but the unfavorable currency fluctuations erased 565 billion yen ($5.4 billion).\n___\nFollow Yuri Kageyama on Twitter at https://twitter.com/yurikageyama\nHer work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/content/yuri-kageyama",

      "text": "TOKYO--Toyota Motor Corp. gave a strong signal Tuesday that it soon plans to jump on the battery bandwagon and make electric cars despite expressing skeptical views about their range and charging times.\nNews of Toyota's technology shift came as its latest results, released Tuesday, showed the company's profits were eroded by a stronger yen and the shift by American car buyers toward trucks and sport-utility vehicles. The company is turning to its regular playbook of trimming costs to bolster earnings, and slightly boosted its profit forecast for the year ending March 2017.\nToyota's strategy is getting buffeted by market trends in the U.S., where sales of its eco-friendly flagship Prius hybrid are tanking as cheap gas encourages U.S. consumers to reject gas-electric hybrids. Meanwhile, eco-minded car buyers are lining up for battery-powered models like those from Tesla Motors.\n\"Though electric vehicles have many issues such as its range, and the length of recharging time and battery performance, depending on the energy situation in each country and region, and infrastructure, we would like to get ourselves ready to commercialize them,\" said Takahiko Ijichi, Toyota's executive vice president, without giving a specific time frame.\nWhile the Japanese company has made considerable changes in recent years to increase the number of light trucks in its mainstream lineups, it is still dependent on passenger cars for volume, such as the Camry family sedan and the Prius. Toyota's U.S. passenger-car sales for the quarter fell about 9%, while truck and SUV sales rose 6.5% from a year earlier.\nNet profit for the July-September quarter fell 36% to 393.7 billion yen ($3.78 billion) from 611.7 billion yen a year earlier--Toyota's second consecutive decline.\nThe company maintained its sales guidance but raised its net profit expectations to 1.55 trillion yen from 1.45 trillion yen as a result of cost-cutting plans. The company still expects net profit to decline by a third in the current financial year, which ends in March 2017, after three years of record-breaking profits buoyed by a weak yen.\nJapanese car makers are finding it difficult to keep their footing in the automotive market as a stronger yen erodes repatriated profits.\nToyota has maintained a strong manufacturing base at home, producing roughly three million vehicles in Japan. A stronger yen makes cars produced in Japan less competitive. Rivals Honda and Nissan receive a much smaller percentage of their sales from Japanese exports.\nToyota earlier this year said it plans to make more vehicles and source more parts in the U.S. to soften the impact of the strengthening yen. President Akio Toyoda oversaw a reorganization of the company to make it more nimble and better at building cars people want to buy.\nTo be sure, Toyota has previously said that it would always develop electric vehicles based on consumer demand, but has maintained that battery-powered cars lack mass market appeal because of their short range and long recharging time.\nToyota believes that car buyers will show increasing demand for vehicles powered by hydrogen fuel cells, which it says have similar range and refueling times to conventional vehicles. But it has faced infrastructure challenges. Delays in construction of hydrogen refueling stations in California are hampering sales of its Mirai hybrid in a market known for its green car sales.\nToyota still plans to sell 30,000 fuel cell vehicles a year by 2020, in time for the Summer Olympics in Tokyo, which it hopes to use a platform to demonstrate the prowess of the technology.\nIts immediate plans are to improve fuel economy in conventional vehicles, and roll out a broader array of hybrids, including the coming Prius plug-in hybrid.\nWrite to Sean McLain at sean.mclain@wsj.com\nMore from MarketWatch Samsung to Temporarily Halt Galaxy Note 7 Production Trump 'Regrets' Crude Words He Spoke About Women in 2005 What a Nobel Prize-winning economist has to say about CEO bonuses",

TOKYO (AP) — Toyota Motor Corp. reported Tuesday that its July-September profit sank 36 percent as a stronger yen eroded its overseas earnings. Lagging sales also pinched the Japanese automaker's fiscal second quarter profit, which fell to 393.7 billion yen ($3.8 billion) from 611.7 billion yen in the same period the previous year. Quarterly sales slipped nearly 9 percent to 6.48 trillion yen ($62.3 billion). The manufacturer of the Prius hybrid, Camry sedan and Lexus luxury models expects to sell 10.1 million vehicles worldwide through March 2017, including sales by affiliates Hino Motors and Daihatsu Motor Co. Toyota has led world vehicle sales in recent years but this year is vying with German automaker Volkswagen AG and General Motors Co., which also expect to sell about 10 million vehicles globally, for the top spot. Volkswagen's global vehicle sales surpassed Toyota's in the first half of the year despite a scandal over cars it rigged to cheat on U.S. diesel emissions tests. US & World ",

      "text": "You are here: Home » OEM » Earnings » Toyota operating profit falls 43% as strong yen, U.S. headwinds hit earnings November 8, 2016 @ 2:36 am Comments \nHave an opinion about this story? Click here to submit a Letter to the Editor , and we may publish it in print. \nTOKYO – Toyota Motor Corp. reported a 43 percent tumble in global operating profit in the latest quarter as foreign exchange losses and an overreliance on lower-margin passenger cars in light truck-crazy North America offset gains from aggressive cost cutting and rising sales. \nOperating profit declined to 474.64 billion yen ($4.69 billion) in the fiscal second quarter ended Sept. 30, CFO Takahiko Ijichi said today while announcing financial results . \nNet income fell 36 percent to 393.71 billion yen ($3.89 billion) in the July-September period. \nWorldwide revenue decreased 8.8 percent to 7.10 trillion yen ($70.10 billion) in the quarter, as global retail sales advanced 2.5 percent to 2.5 million vehicles. \nToyota, in a race against Volkswagen Group to finish the year as the world’s biggest automaker, is facing headwinds in the critical U.S. market, its traditional cash cow. Meanwhile, unfavorable foreign exchange rates are delivering hefty losses that will derail Toyota from a three-year streak of record earnings. Tepid sales are further clouding the outlook. \nJapan’s No. 1 carmaker is also in the middle of restructuring itself to become more nimble and efficient as it navigates the complex waters of selling more than 10 million vehicles a year. \nTruck supply \nIjichi said fluctuating foreign exchange rates undermined earnings in the latest quarter, even as overall sales inched higher and Toyota ramped up cost cutting measures. The flattening U.S. market and that market’s shift toward light trucks further hurt earnings. \nNorth American regional operating profit declined 5.9 percent to 139.82 billion yen ($1.38 billion) in the quarter. North American wholesale volume stayed flat at 684,000 vehicles. \nIjichi said the company was slow to react as U.S. consumers stampeded away from passenger cars toward light trucks, as gasoline drop and tastes change. “Supply has not kept up with demand,” Ijichi said of Toyota’s truck lineup. \nBecause of the shortfall, Toyota trimmed its North America wholesale outlook for the current fiscal year. It now expects to sell 2.82 million vehicles, down from the original plan to sell 2.88. The target represents a 0.6 percent sales drop from the previous year. \nThe market shift pressures a Toyota lineup flush with fuel efficient offering such as the Prius hybrid, sales of which dropped 12 percent through October despite being redesigned last year. \nHot-selling light trucks accounted for just 52 percent of volume at Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A. through October. But industrywide, trucks gobbled 60 percent of all U.S. sales. Toyota Motor Sales car volume fell 12 percent in the first 10 months, while its truck sales gained 7.1 percent. \nNorth American profit was also hit by swinging foreign exchange rates, especially the yen’s appreciation against the Mexican peso and Canadian dollar. \nImproved outlook \nThe slowdown is also increasing pricing pressure and pushing players industrywide to lift incentives. Toyota said it was able to offset incentive and marketing cost increases in North America with cost cutting measure elsewhere, thereby limiting the profit decline. \nIn Europe, wholesale volume increased by 11,000 units to 212,00 vehicles in the quarter, while regional operating profit increased 14 percent to 25.52 billion yen ($251.95 million). \nCiting more aggressive cost cuts and the adoption of a more lenient foreign exchange rate assumption, Toyota lifted its forecast for the current fiscal year ending March 31, 2017. \nOperating profit is now expected to tumble 40 percent to 1.7 trillion yen ($16.78 billion), as opposed to dropping to 1.6 trillion yen as earlier announced. It also improved its net income outlook to 1.55 trillion yen ($15.30 billion), up from its earlier target of 1.45 trillion ($14.32 billion). The new goal still represents a 33 percent fall from last year’s result. \nThe declines from the previous year result from the yen’s steep appreciation in the interim. \nToyota cut its global retail sales forecast by 50,000 vehicles, mostly on the lower North American outlook. Worldwide volume is now seen essentially flat at 10.1 million vehicles. You can reach Hans Greimel at Tags:",

Toyota Motor Corp. reported Tuesday, Nov. 8, 2016, that July-September profit sank 36 percent, hammered by the strong yen, which erodes the overseas earnings of Japanese exporters. Lagging sales also helped send the Japanese automaker’s fiscal second quarter profit lower to 393.7 billion yen ($3.8 billion), down from 611.7 billion yen the same period the previous year. (AP Photo/Eugene Hoshiko, File) \nTOKYO (AP) — Toyota Motor Corp. reported Tuesday that its July-September profit sank 36 percent as a stronger yen eroded its overseas earnings. \nLagging sales also pinched the Japanese automaker's fiscal second quarter profit, which fell to 393.7 billion yen ($3.8 billion) from 611.7 billion yen in the same period the previous year. \nQuarterly sales slipped nearly 9 percent to 6.48 trillion yen ($62.3 billion). \nThe manufacturer of the Prius hybrid, Camry sedan and Lexus luxury models expects to sell 10.1 million vehicles worldwide through March 2017, including sales by affiliates Hino Motors and Daihatsu Motor Co. \nToyota has led world vehicle sales in recent years but this year is vying with German automaker Volkswagen AG and General Motors Co., which also expect to sell about 10 million vehicles globally, for the top spot. \nVolkswagen's global vehicle sales surpassed Toyota's in the first half of the year despite a scandal over cars it rigged to cheat on U.S. diesel emissions tests. \nToyota raised its annual profit forecast to 1.5 trillion yen ($14.4 billion) from an earlier 1.45 trillion yen ($13.9 billion). But that's still below the 2.3 trillion yen it earned last year. \nToyota said that in the first fiscal half, it carried out cost reductions that added 220 billion yen ($2.1 billion) to the company's operating profit, but the unfavorable currency fluctuations erased 565 billion yen ($5.4 billion). \n___ \nFollow Yuri Kageyama on Twitter at https://twitter.com/yurikageyama \nHer work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/content/yuri-kageyama Tags",

      "text": "  Toyota's Bread And Butter Nameplate Turns 50 by Chris Wall   In 50 years the Toyota has supplied the world over 44 million of them. 44.3 million units. That's how many Corollas Toyota has shifted in fifty years. When you average that out, we're looking at roughly 886,000 units a year. The success was worldwide after the model started being exported outside of Japan not too long after the 1966 launch of the car. Corollas made their way to the U.S. in 1968 and with such a large market as part of the consumers added to worldwide sales, within a year in excess of a million Corollas were sold. Those are numbers that cannot be argued with. While the model has had a few performance-orientated variants, it's never really been seen as any sort of tarmac terror, that was left to the aftermarket tuners. Older rear-wheel drive Corollas are commonplace with engine swaps from other Toyotas, like the Supra, and front -wheel drive cars saw big turbo conversions. You'd think that with a cult-like following Toyota would have created a Corolla with some power. The lack of such a model is probably why the Corolla has a reputation as being an affordable and more importantly, a reliable car. It took 33 years for a rival to dethrone the Corolla as Japan's top-seller , and that 2002 title was Honda's practical and equally reliable Fit hatchback. The Corolla was designed by Hasegawa San (Tatsuo), and he incorporated some design techniques he has used during World War II when he used to design aircrafts. Tatsuo gave the Corolla an air of sportiness even though it was touted as a family car. We're not sure where sportiness comes in with an 1,100 cc engine and a four-speed manual though. Since those early days there have been eleven generations of the Corolla, and the car is still loved by young and old alike. The car is manufactured in 13 countries around the world and sold in over than 150 countries. With stats like that under it's belt, we don't reckon anyone will match the Corolla's success any time soon.",

This new SUV features a number of innovative and timely changes to its predecessors including reduced ground clearance, slimmer tracks as well as an improved transmission system. What's more, the installation of a 2,000 horsepower engine setup meant that the Land Speed Cruiser had to undergo a variety of structural and design changes that have only served to make it look better than ever with an athletic appearance that rounds it off as a comprehensively world-class SUV.",

      "text": "TOKYO (AP) -- Toyota Motor Corp. reported Tuesday that its July-September profit sank 36 percent as a stronger yen eroded its overseas earnings.\nLagging sales also pinched the Japanese automaker&apos;s fiscal second quarter profit, which fell to 393.7 billion yen ($3.8 billion) from 611.7 billion yen in the same period the previous year.\nQuarterly sales slipped nearly 9 percent to 6.48 trillion yen ($62.3 billion).\nThe manufacturer of the Prius hybrid, Camry sedan and Lexus luxury models expects to sell 10.1 million vehicles worldwide through March 2017, including sales by affiliates Hino Motors and Daihatsu Motor Co.\nToyota has led world vehicle sales in recent years but this year is vying with German automaker Volkswagen AG and General Motors Co., which also expect to sell about 10 million vehicles globally, for the top spot.\nVolkswagen&apos;s global vehicle sales surpassed Toyota&apos;s in the first half of the year despite a scandal over cars it rigged to cheat on U.S. diesel emissions tests.\nToyota raised its annual profit forecast to 1.5 trillion yen ($14.4 billion) from an earlier 1.45 trillion yen ($13.9 billion). But that&apos;s still below the 2.3 trillion yen it earned last year.\nToyota said that in the first fiscal half, it carried out cost reductions that added 220 billion yen ($2.1 billion) to the company&apos;s operating profit, but the unfavorable currency fluctuations erased 565 billion yen ($5.4 billion).\n---\nFollow Yuri Kageyama on Twitter at https://twitter.com/yurikageyama\nHer work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/content/yuri-kageyama\n ",

      "title": "BEVs Ready To Become Part Of Toyota's Portfolio, CFO Says",
      "text": "[caption id=\"attachment_39504202\"   Takahiko Ijichi, today in Tokyo (Photo: Kiyoshi Ota/Bloomberg)[/caption]While carmaker after carmaker decided to electrify their cars, Toyota has been the lone outlier. For that, it has become the favorite whipping post of electric vehicle proponents trying to paint a picture of Big Car in cahoots with Big Oil. Find a new post to flog. Toyota today confirmed that it is looking at making battery electric vehicles a part of its alternative powertrain portfolio, never mind that the message was sent with the careful crafted circumspection of a CFO’s forward looking statements.Yesterday, press reports of Toyota giving up its anti-BEV stance circulated in Tokyo. They originated at the Nikkei , and the trained Toyotaologist knows that this would not be the first time that the Japanese business wire is tipped off ahead of a large press conference. Forbes received similar hints months ago. Today was Toyota’s quarterly results conference (profits down, but still healthy, outlook unchanged) and as if on cue, the first question was by a Nikkei reporter, who wanted to know whether Toyota has re-arranged its powertrain priorities.Toyota’s CFO Tahahiki Ijichi had the answer on a piece of paper ready in front of him:\n“Short-term, our priority is to improve the fuel-efficiencies of conventional vehicles, and by that to lower the CO2 emissions. Our hybrid vehicle lineup should be further enhanced. In terms of mid-term plans, FCV as well as EV will be utilized, depending on the country and market and their energy and infrastructure situations. We’d like to a have a differentiated approach with these zero emission vehicles, depending on what is suitable in each market.” Translation: Toyota so far believed that the long charging time and limited range of BEVs stand in the way of their wholesale acceptance, and that fuel cell vehicles [FCV] are the solution, as long as hydrogen stations will be built. However, Toyota is also aware that government regulations are the most powerful driver in this business. At home in Japan, Toyota found government support for its vision of a hydrogen society. In other markets, such as China, or the U.S., government policy favors battery electric vehicle [BEV]. In Europe, policy favored diesel, but as the fuel falls out of favor in the wake of dieselgate, the thrust now goes in the direction of BEV in the EU also. Toyota is in the business of selling cars, no ideologies, and it wants to deliver what policies and markets demand.And so when Wall Street Journal’s Tokyo correspondent Sean McLain asked again whether there was a change of powertrain plans, Ijichi answered, with the picture of a big blue Toyota Mirai FCW projected against the wall behind him: “At this moment, the greater weight will be given to conventional and hybrid vehicles. As time passes, gradually the weight will shift to plug-in hybrids, FCV and EV.We think the important future vehicle is the fuel cell vehicle. In terms of range refilling time, the user friendliness of the FCV is as good as that of a conventional vehicle. At the same time, EV represents an alternative. We take a portfolio approach. If a certain model is not successful, we always have something else to make up for that. This is a part of risk management. EVs have many challenges, but different countries and regions have different policies, and depending on the availability of infrastructure, we would like to be able to consider the introduction of EVs.” Translation: If the governments and markets insist on their BEVs, we will give them to them, even if we think that FCV would serve customers better. Wouldn’t be the first time that good enough won out over the best. For the Wall Street Journal , the somewhat sibylline comments of Toyota’s head bean counter were “a strong signal that Toyota soon plans to jump on the battery bandwagon and make electric cars despite expressing skeptical views about their range and charging times.”I received the same signal.",

      "text": "Japan’s two largest carmakers have arrived at the same conclusion: the U.S. auto market that’s functioned as a growth engine has run out of gas.\nToyota Motor Corp. cut its forecast for North American sales this fiscal year by 60,000 vehicles and for the first time said it’s expecting a decline for the year, as American consumers shift away from fuel sippers like the Prius hybrid and toward trucks and sport utility vehicles. Nissan Motor Co., which posted a drop in profit as it gave heftier incentives that buoyed deliveries, said it’s not seeing room for further expansion.\n“The market turned out to be somewhat weaker,” Takahiko Ijichi, a Toyota executive vice president, told reporters Tuesday after the carmaker reported a 43 percent plunge in quarterly operating profit. The North American market “really requires very careful managing going forward,” he said.\nThe more dour outlook is significant not only for Toyota and Nissan but for Japan’s economy. For the nation’s automakers, North America remains the biggest export destination, with more than 1.3 million passenger cars shipped during the first nine months of the year. That was double the number of vehicles exported to Europe and fourtimes the number sent to the rest of Asia, including China, which has seen a tax cut-induced buying spurt.\nThe peak also has arrived at an inopportune time because the stronger yen continues to drag on earnings. While Toyota City, Japan-based Toyota raised its profit forecast for the fiscal year after the yen rallied less than expected, it’s still projecting operating profit to slump by 40 percent to 1.7 trillion yen ($16.3 billion) for the year ending in March.\nNissan, meanwhile, said operating profit fell 19 percent last quarter, driven primarily by the impact of a stronger yen. For the year ending in March, operating income probably will drop by 10 percent to 710 billion yen, according to the Yokohama, Japan-based company.\nIncentives Increase “It’s a peak and we don’t see a potential for further growth” in the U.S. industry, Hiroto Saikawa, co-chief executive officer, said at a press conference Monday. “Incentives are rapidly growing in the industry, and we are paying close attention to it.”\nAutomakers spent an average of $3,262 per vehicle on marketing promotions this year through October, up 13 percent from a year earlier, according to Autodata Corp. Both Toyota and Nissan are increasing incentives at a slower pace than the industry average, with the researcher estimates Nissan’s spending at $3,607 per vehicle and Toyota’s at $2,270 per vehicle.\nToyota has been using “appropriate levels” of incentives to buoy sales of its mainstay passenger models, the Camry sedan and Corolla compact, Ijichi said Tuesday. Nissan said incentive spending reduced operating profit in the U.S. by 40.5 billion yen, raising concerns for Takaki Nakanishi, an analyst with Jefferies Group LLC.\n“We cannot underestimate risk in this market,” Nakanishi, who has a hold rating on Nissan shares, wrote in a report Monday. The drag on operating profit from incentives, after a 36.9 billion yen reduction in the first quarter, “reconfirmed that Nissan has reached a peak in U.S. profitability,” he said.\nAsia Demand Toyota and Nissan are more upbeat about the prospects for markets in Asia outside Japan.\nFor Toyota, it’s now forecasting 1.56 million vehicle sales for the region this fiscal year, 90,000 more than projected just three months ago. Nissan boosted China sales by 8.2 percent this year through September and is targeting deliveries of 1.3 million vehicles to the market this year.\nIndustrywide passenger-vehicle deliveries surged 20 percent in October to 2.22 million, the China Passenger Car Association said Tuesday. Consumers are rushing to buy models with smaller engines ahead of a tax cut due to expire at the end of this year, even as the government said it’s looking at extending the rebate.\n“Regardless, it may impact buying behavior in the fourth quarter this year,” David Schoch, president of Ford Motor Co.’s Asia-Pacific unit, said on Tuesday in Chennai, where the automaker will spend $195 million to open a technology and business center by early 2019. “There is still a lot of growth left in China, particularly in lower-tier cities. They still have millions and millions of people.”",

      "text": "[ - ] Text [ + ] \nBy Naomi Tajitsu and Chang-Ran Kim \nTOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T: Quote ) is looking at mass-producing long-range electric vehicles (EVs) that would hit the market around 2020, the Nikkei newspaper reported on Monday, in what would be a dramatic reversal of strategy for the world's top-selling automaker. \nEven as rivals such as Nissan Motor Co (7201.T: Quote ), Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE: Quote ) and Tesla Motors (TSLA.O: Quote ) have touted pure electric cars as the most viable zero-emission vehicles for the future, Toyota has said it would reserve EVs for short-distance commuting given the high price of rechargeable batteries and lengthy charging times. \nBy adding longer-range EVs to its product range, Toyota would be changing its tune from promoting plug-in petrol-electric hybrid cars and hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles (FCVs) as the most promising alternative to conventional cars. \nThe Nikkei business daily, without citing sources, said Toyota would set up a team in early 2017 dedicated to developing electric cars that can travel more than 300 km (186 miles) on a single charge. \nThe paper added that Toyota aims to begin selling its first long-range EV in 2020 in Japan as well as other markets such as California, and China - the world's biggest car market - which is promoting a switch to battery EVs. \nToyota neither confirmed nor denied the report, saying it does not comment on product development plans. In an emailed response, it said it continued to develop various fuel-efficient technologies, including EVs, with the best application for each in mind. \nToyota has pledged to make all of its vehicles essentially emissions-free by 2050. \nIndustry experts said emissions regulations in California, widely considered a benchmark in global vehicle emissions standards, and China's push to increase electric car usage could be behind a possible change of heart at Toyota.

The academy is operated by a staff of more than 20, including managers, administrators and trainers in specific skills such as vehicle servicing, parts, body and paint, technical and customer services. \nAcademy trainees can gain qualifications through courses in the Toyota Team 21 program, including Institute of the Motor Industry-accredited courses for young people starting their careers and in functional skills such as math, English and information-communications technology. \nAt its official opening Andy Pfeiffenberger, Toyota Motor Europe senior vice president-corporate administration, says, “This new academy shows Toyota’s commitment to investing in people to raise standards across our industry.” \nPaul Van der Burgh, Toyota (Great Britain) president and managing director, adds: “The creation of a state-of-the-art academy has raised the bar in terms of the quality and standard of the training we are now able to provide to our network staff and also for young people through both our...apprenticeship schemes. \n“We have invested in the latest learning technologies and we are committed to inspiring learning and developing people’s skills across the board.”",

      "text": "Toyota's worldwide operating profit tumbles 43 percent on currency losses and market shifts Filed under Autos at Get Daily Dallas News Headlines Sign Up Get Unlimited Digital Access Your first month is less than a dollar. $0.99 for first 4 weeks Subscribe Now \nGlobal operating profit at Toyota Motor Corp. fell 43 percent in the latest quarter as currency exchange losses and an over-reliance on relatively low-profit passenger cars offset cost-cutting and rising sales. \nOperating profit declined to $4.69 billion in the quarter ending Sept. 30, CFO Takahiko Ijichi said, according to Automotive News. \nNet income dropped 36 percent to $3.89 billion in the July-September period. \nMeanwhile, regional operating profit in North America fell 5.9 percent to $1.38 billion in the quarter, according to Automotive News. Sales stayed flat at 684,000 vehicles. \nFluctuating foreign-exchange rates eroded Toyota's earnings in the latest quarter, Ijichi said, as did the slowing U.S. market. \nIn addition, the consumer shift from passenger cars to light trucks hurt the automaker. \nHot-selling light trucks accounted for 52 percent of sales at Toyota USA, while they made up 60 percent of all U.S. sales - meaning Toyota has not been able to keep up with the pace of the shift. \n\"Supply has not kept up with demand,\" Ijichi said of Toyota's truck lineup, according to Automotive News. \nToyota cut its global retail sales forecast by 50,000 vehicles mostly on lower expectations in North America. Worldwide volume is now predicted to remain flat at 10.1 million vehicles. View Comments",

(AP Photo/Eugene Hoshiko, File) Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY (1) Tokyo • Toyota Motor Corp. reported Tuesday that its July-September profit sank 36 percent as a stronger yen eroded its overseas earnings. Lagging sales also pinched the Japanese automaker's fiscal second quarter profit, which fell to 393.7 billion yen ($3.8 billion) from 611.7 billion yen in the same period the previous year. Quarterly sales slipped nearly 9 percent to 6.48 trillion yen ($62.3 billion). The manufacturer of the Prius hybrid, Camry sedan and Lexus luxury models expects to sell 10.1 million vehicles worldwide through March 2017, including sales by affiliates Hino Motors and Daihatsu Motor Co. Toyota has led world vehicle sales in recent years but this year is vying with German automaker Volkswagen AG and General Motors Co., which also expect to sell about 10 million vehicles globally, for the top spot. VIDEOS TOP JOBS Volkswagen's global vehicle sales surpassed Toyota's in the first half of the year despite a scandal over cars it rigged to cheat on U.S. diesel emissions tests. Toyota raised its annual profit forecast to 1.5 trillion yen ($14.4 billion) from an earlier 1.45 trillion yen ($13.9 billion). But that's still below the 2.3 trillion yen it earned last year. Toyota said that in the first fiscal half, it carried out cost reductions that added 220 billion yen ($2.1 billion) to the company's operating profit, but the unfavorable currency fluctuations erased 565 billion yen ($5.4 billion). ——— Follow Yuri Kageyama on Twitter at https://twitter.com/yurikageyama Her work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/content/yuri-kageyama",

      "text": "  8th, 2016 | by James Ayre 0 \nNovember 8th, 2016 by James Ayre Toyota will begin mass production of electric vehicles by 2020, in time for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, according to a report from the Nikkei Asian Review . Notably, Toyota will be a major sponsor of the 2020 Summer Olympics. While the source isn’t named, the timeline would match up pretty well with recent company statements about having “tamed” lithium-ion battery technology . The report claims that an in-house development team will be created for the transition to electric vehicles (EVs) as soon as early 2017. In order to transition (begin production) rapidly, Toyota will reportedly be seeking “cooperation from group companies.” The plan is apparently to develop an EV with a single-charge range of more than 300 kilometers — this figure may be with regard countries with a relatively lax testing/rating body, but there’s no way to know at this point. If sales are going to be strong, and prices aren’t going to be rock bottom, then the company will probably need to offer more of a range than that figure implies. One would think so anyways. Understandably, the company is reportedly considering electric versions of the Prius and/or Corolla, and/or an SUV. Here’s more from the Nikkei Asian Review : “The automaker will bolster development of batteries, a core component that determines the vehicle’s performance, through the company’s battery material research department established in January. But Toyota also may procure batteries from outside sources to keep costs low for EVs while offering good performance, including driving range, and charging time. … “Toyota’s shift also responds to moves by rivals. Volkswagen has announced a plan to have EVs account for almost 25% of sales by 2025, up from 1% now, after an emissions-cheating scandal in the US came to light last year for diesel cars, the core of the German company’s green-vehicle strategy. China’s leading EV manufacturer, BYD, is boosting production. And Tesla enjoys strong demand for its EVs, including a small sedan due out next year.” These statements haven’t been corroborated by Toyota yet, and those who have requested a comment on the matter were given generic responses about pursuing all promising technologies, but they do match with the recent news about a direction shift. If Toyota wants to maintain its current market share, then it will have to shift at some point in the approaching future. 2020 sounds about right, even if the date has yet to be confirmed.  ",

Publicis Groupe agencies including Saatchi & Saatchi and Zenith previously handled the assignment.\nThe&Partnership will set up an integrated network of dedicated hubs for Toyota in order to support the car maker's transition towards a digital-first model. \nThis newly named ‘&TOYOTA’ network will be led by a specialist data analytics unit that will integrate data driven creative with media planning. \nThe move represents and expansion of Toyota’s relationship with The&Partnership. The carmaker has worked with the group’s creative agency CHI&Partners for years and won a Gold Cyber Lion at Cannes in 2016 on behalf of Lexus Hoverboard. \n“Our ambition is to strengthen Toyota’s brand image in Europe by producing ever better cars, communicating a clear brand purpose and maximizing the effectiveness of our media investments,\" stated Karl Schlicht, EVP, Toyota Motor Europe. \"We believe a new business model is required to achieve this – one that is more integrated and customer-centric – with digital transformation at its heart.\"\nThe win represents a nice success story for London's marketing industry in the wake of the Brexit vote. It follows the creation of a series of bespoke agencies by The&Partnership over recent years, including Pulse Creative, the new, full-service agency for News UK; The Fuse for  The Wall Street Journal  / Dow Jones.\nThe marketing firm has also set up a similar operation for telecommunications company Telus in Canada.",

      "text": "By Brad Haynes and Daniel Flynn\nSAO PAULO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> is gearing up for Brazil's battered auto market to return to growth in 2017, after a four-year crisis halved overall vehicle sales, the automaker's top executive in Latin America said.\nYet Steve St. Angelo - who has tripled Toyota's market share in Brazil during the crisis - says he is losing sleep over one scenario: what if the market comes back too quickly?\n\"If that volume comes back, how do we keep our market share?\" said St. Angelo, head of Toyota in South and Central America and the Caribbean, in an interview ahead of this week's Sao Paulo Auto Show.\n\"We don't have the production facilities. Are the dealers prepared for that kind of volume? The short answer is: I worry about it,\" he added. \"This is what keeps me up at night.\"\nToyota sold nearly 148,000 cars and light trucks in Brazil in the first ten months of 2016, up 1 percent from a year earlier, moving to fifth place in the Brazil market from eighth just a few years ago.\nSt. Angelo, who credits meticulous customer service for keeping loyal customers during the downturn, has the enviable problem of contemplating a third shift at Toyota's plants in Brazil, while rivals are using less than half of their capacity.\nToyota has avoided the widespread layoffs that cut 25,000 jobs from the Brazilian auto industry in two years.\nAcross Latin America, the Japanese automaker has become a outlier under St. Angelo, doubling down while other carmakers pulled back amid economic crises in Brazil, Argentina and even Venezuela.\nSo far, the strategy has won a larger slice of a shrinking pie. Toyota forecasts growing sales in core markets of North America, Asia and Europe, but an aggregate drop in markets such as Latin America, Africa and the Middle East, raising questions about return on investments there.\nAn $800 million expansion of a Toyota factory in Argentina looked like folly to many in 2013, with the country on the verge of its second default in a dozen years.\n\"When I announced that, some suppliers and competitors called to ask me, 'Steve, are you crazy?'\" said St. Angelo.\nYet the economy has stabilized under new President Mauricio Macri and Argentina has become an export hub for Toyota. It is already using half of its new capacity at the Zarate plant.\nBrazil is unlikely to make such a swift turnaround, according to St. Angelo, as high interest rates and unemployment continue to weigh on demand.\nAn export-driven rebound would also be a stretch for the Brazilian industry, he said, given the inflexible labor laws, poor transportation infrastructure, huge tax burden and weak supply chains that push up costs compared to global competition.\nCOSTS BLOCK C-HR\nToyota opened its third Brazilian car plant at the peak of the market in 2012, making the newly launched Etios subcompact. It employs more than 5,500 people in Brazil.\nBut manufacturing costs are one reason Toyota has held off bringing its subcompact SUV crossover C-HR to Brazil, where Honda Motor Co <7267.T> has found a hit with its locally made rival HRV.\n\"There are no plans to bring C-HR to Brazil. We even looked at manufacturing here, but it was just too expensive,\" said St. Angelo.\nStill, Toyota is bringing a C-HR concept car to the Sao Paulo show this week to gauge interest, St Angelo said. A Yaris concept car at the 2015 Buenos Aires Auto Show stirred enough interest to start importing that car to Argentina, he added.\nInstead of launching new models in Brazil, St. Angelo said he is focused on expanding a network of dealerships that can provide the customer service he credits for Toyota's recent success.\nMaintaining service standards at an expanding network of dealerships can be as difficult as ramping up assembly lines, he said, citing a recent slip in customer satisfaction at Argentine dealerships that he quickly addressed.\nSt. Angelo also expects Toyota's patience to pay off sooner or later in Venezuela, where the company has held on to workers despite a ravaging economic crisis that dropped new car sales from 600,000 per year to around 10,000 per year.\nTo test its cost-cutting ability and keep its factory open, Toyota even repurposed a Venezuelan assembly line to make parts for export to Argentina.\n\"It was a breakthrough for us ... and I'm not ending there. I'm challenging them,\" he added. \"Can you get competitive so maybe one day they can export to Cuba? Why not?\"\n(Reporting by Brad Haynes and Daniel Flynn; Editing by Chris Reese and Mary Milliken)",

      "title": "Toyota profit tumbles on strong yen, but lifts full-year view",
      "text": "Toyota said on Tuesday its April-September net profit dived 25 percent, hit by a sharp rally in the yen and another fall in North American sales, but it upgraded its full-year outlook.\nThe world's biggest automaker reported a net profit of 946.1 billion yen ($9.1 billion) in the first half of its fiscal year, down from 1.25 trillion yen in the same period in 2015.\nOperating profit fell nearly 30 percent to 1.11 trillion yen, while revenue was off 7.2 percent at 13.07 trillion yen.\nHowever the Corolla and Prius hybrid maker boosted its full-year to March net profit forecast to 1.55 trillion yen from an earlier 1.45 trillion yen estimate.\nThe newest figure is still way down from a record 2.31 trillion yen net profit in the most recently ended business year.\nThe decline in profits underscores the negative impact that a resurgent currency has had on firms doing much of their business abroad.\nJapan's exporters reaped windfall profits over the past few years as government efforts to kickstart the world's number three economy sharply weakened the yen.\nThat was good for firms such as Toyota and rivals Honda and Nissan because repatriated foreign profits were worth more when the yen was weak and because it boosted their competitiveness overseas.\nBut the currency has rallied since the start of the year as volatile equity markets and Britain's vote to exit the European Union boosted demand for a unit widely seen as a safe investment.\n\"The yen's strength remains a major factor squeezing earnings in the Japanese auto sector,\" said Shigeru Matsumura, analyst at SMBC Friend Research Center, before the results were published.\n\"Japanese carmakers need to make further efforts to make their corporate structure more resistant to the yen's appreciation,\" he added.\n- Recalls, quakes -\nToyota's vehicle sales in April-September ticked up to 5.06 million units, from 4.97 million vehicles in the same period last year, with increases in Japan, Europe and Asia.\nStill, vehicle sales fell in the Middle East, Africa and the key North American market, where cheap oil has hit demand for Toyota's fuel-efficient offerings including the Prius.\nThe North American sales drop was due to a \"drastic shift\" in demand from passenger cars to SUVs and trucks, the firm said.\nJapanese automakers have benefited from healthy growth in the US where low interest rates boosted demand, although a possible rise in borrowing costs this year could erode sales.\nUnsteady demand in emerging markets such as Thailand and Indonesia are also red flags, as Toyota and other major automakers wrestle with costs linked to a huge scandal at supplier Takata.\nA defect in the firm's airbags has been linked to more than a dozen deaths and scores of injuries globally, prompting the auto industry's biggest ever safety recall to replace the problem parts and meaning huge expenses for automakers.\nAutomakers were also hit by temporary factory shutdowns in the south of Japan after a pair of earthquakes caused major damage and claimed dozens of lives in April, affecting production.\nStiff competition at home and abroad has pushed some Japanese automakers to eye tie-ups.\nToyota and small car maker Suzuki said last month they were holding talks about a possible partnership.\nToyota said the possible deal was prompted by the fact that it trails competitors in North America and Europe in some areas, while Suzuki is struggling to forge its own path in the fiercely competitive industry.\nNissan is buying a one-third stake in Mitsubishi Motors, forging an alliance that will challenge some of the world's biggest auto groups.\nOn Monday Nissan said net profit in the April-September period fell 13.3 percent to 282.4 billion yen, the first decline over that six-month span in four years.\nLast week Honda said its net profit rose 12.1 percent from the same period in 2015 to 351.8 billion yen, as cost cuts offset the impact of the rising yen.",

Toyota Motor Corp. reported Tuesday, Nov. 8, 2016, that July-September profit sank 36 percent, hammered by the strong yen, which erodes the overseas earnings of Japanese exporters.

(AP Photo/Eugene Hoshiko, File) \nTOKYO (AP) — Toyota Motor Corp. reported Tuesday that its July-September profit sank 36 percent as a stronger yen eroded its overseas earnings. \nLagging sales also pinched the Japanese automaker's fiscal second quarter profit, which fell to 393.7 billion yen ($3.8 billion) from 611.7 billion yen in the same period the previous year. \nQuarterly sales slipped nearly 9 percent to 6.48 trillion yen ($62.3 billion). \nThe manufacturer of the Prius hybrid, Camry sedan and Lexus luxury models expects to sell 10.1 million vehicles worldwide through March 2017, including sales by affiliates Hino Motors and Daihatsu Motor Co. \nToyota has led world vehicle sales in recent years but this year is vying with German automaker Volkswagen AG and General Motors Co., which also expect to sell about 10 million vehicles globally, for the top spot. \nVolkswagen's global vehicle sales surpassed Toyota's in the first half of the year despite a scandal over cars it rigged to cheat on U.S. diesel emissions tests. \nToyota raised its annual profit forecast to 1.5 trillion yen ($14.4 billion) from an earlier 1.45 trillion yen ($13.9 billion). But that's still below the 2.3 trillion yen it earned last year. \nToyota said that in the first fiscal half, it carried out cost reductions that added 220 billion yen ($2.1 billion) to the company's operating profit, but the unfavorable currency fluctuations erased 565 billion yen ($5.4 billion).",

But Toyota says it will scrimp and save to mitigate the currency's impact - raising its operating profit forecast by 6 percent. SOUNDBITE (English) CHIEF ECONOMIST, WORLD FIRST, JEREMY COOK, SAYING: \"We have seen a very, very large strengthening of the Japanese Yen over the course of the past two years or so. Dollar/Yen used to be as high as 1.20. It spent some time below 100 over the course of the past 6 months or so. The strengthening of yen for such an export reliant economy is obviously going to start pinching on profits.\" Sales have slowed in North America - its largest market. Toyota and rivals Nissan and Honda are struggling to keep up with the trend for larger models thanks to cheaper fuel. Toyota plans to jump on the battery bandwagon. It's been investing heavily in hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles. And says it's warming to the idea of producing more long range electric vehicles. SOUNDBITE (English) CHIEF ECONOMIST, WORLD FIRST, JEREMY COOK, SAYING: \"The car industry and the car market is also starting to slow. It's not going to be more sales it seems that drives the car market, it's going to be innovation within those sales.\" Despite the rosier outlook - operating profit for the year - even at the revised level - will still be its lowest since 2013. And 40 percent lower than last year's all time high.  //reut.rs/2fBrOqT",
