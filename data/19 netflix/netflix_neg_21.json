      "text": "By Sara Ashley O’Brien \nPHILADELPHIA (CNN) – – It just got even easier to binge on Netflix.\nNetflix announced on Wednesday members now have the option to download movies and shows to watch offline later. This means you can finally watch Gilmore Girls and Stranger Things while on a flight or stuck in the subway.\nThe feature comes free of cost with all Netflix memberships.\nUp until now, you need a place with a reliable internet connection to access the streaming service. But Netflix wants to make its product more nimble to suit the lives of those on-the-go.\nThe company previously argued the feature was unnecessary, calling it a “short term fix for a bigger problem.” That problem, of course, being wireless internet availability.\nBut its competitor Amazon Prime embraced offline downloads for iOS and Android users more than a year ago.\nAccording to Netflix’s Help Center page, “you’ll want to delete” downloaded titles before attempting to download a new content.\nIt is unclear as of now if there’s a cap on how many shows or films people can download at once.\nNetflix did not immediately respond to CNNMoney’s request for comment\nThe-CNN-Wire ™ & © 2016 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

REUTERS/Mike Blake/File Photo \nVideo streaming pioneer Netflix Inc said its subscribers would now be able to download popular shows such as \"Orange is The New Black\" and \"Narcos\" on their mobile devices at no extra cost. \n\"While many members enjoy watching Netflix at home, we've often heard they also want to continue their 'Stranger Things' binge while on airplanes and other places where Internet is expensive or limited,\" Eddy Wu, director of product innovation, wrote in a blog post. \nNetflix, whose other popular original shows include \"House of Cards\" and \"The Crown\", has expanded into almost all countries, with China being a notable exception. \nThe new feature is included in all plans and available for phones and tablets on Alphabet Inc's Android and Apple Inc's iOS platforms, the company said. \nMore content will be available for offline viewing later, Netflix said. \nThe company's shares rose 2 percent to $119.97 in early trading on the Nasdaq. \n(Reporting by Supantha Mukherjee in Bengaluru; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty) Next In Technology News",

Just click the download button on the details page for a film or TV series and you can watch it later without an internet connection.\nTo help you know what shows, movies, and specials can be downloaded, Netflix has added a new section to the sidebar of its app called Available for Download.

Netflix hasn't released a full list of compatible shows, but it appears to mostly favor Netflix originals like \"Narcos\" and \"Stranger Things.\" It's unclear how many licensed titles from third parties will be available to download. \nAmazon Video, which offers thousands of free TV shows and movies for Prime members, lets you download just about any video for offline viewing. Netflix appears to be taking a more cautious approach to video downloads for now. \nThe \"Available for Download\" section on Netflix does include a variety of third-party shows and movies though, including \"Parks and Recreation,\" \"Mad Men,\" and a bunch of documentaries. Netflix said in a statement that \"many more\" titles are coming. \nScreenshot \nNetflix downloads work on iOS and Android devices. You'll need to update your Netflix app to the latest version, which launches Wednesday. A download button will appear next to the videos you can store for offline viewing. \nLike this: \nNetflix \nNetflix has historically been against allowing offline viewing, even as recently as the end of last year. But executives have loosened their opposition to video downloads this year, leading many to speculate it'd happen soon. Well, here it is, even if it's pretty limited for now. \nFindTheCompany | Graphiq",

      "text": "Netflix today announced a feature many users have wanted for years—the ability to download videos and watch them later, without an Internet connection.\n\"Netflix members worldwide can now download in addition to stream great series and films at no extra cost,\" the company's announcement said . \"While many members enjoy watching Netflix at home, we’ve often heard they also want to continue their Stranger Things binge while on airplanes and other places where Internet is expensive or limited.\" Downloads are available for all pricing plans.\nThe feature is available in the new versions of Netflix's apps for iOS and Android devices. Not every show or movie is available for download, likely due to restrictions in programming contracts. Netflix says the download feature is available for \" select TV shows and movies .\" Besides Stranger Things , the Netflix announcement said that Orange Is the New Black , Narcos, and The Crown are available for download now. These four have something in common: they are all produced by Netflix. Further Reading “NightShift” caches Netflix shows on your home network to boost speed \nTitles that can be viewed offline have a download icon, and customers can also browse downloadable shows and movies in a new \"Available for Download\" section. Once downloaded, customers can watch the videos with or without an Internet connection from the \"My Downloads\" section.\nAs with streaming, customers can select different video qualities that use more or less data. Downloading shows will use about the same amount of data as streaming, but the ability to store video could help customers better manage their data usage by downloading shows on home Wi-Fi networks to avoid using cellular data.\nDownloading won't help customers stay under a home Internet data cap, unless they intend to watch something more than once. But this feature could be great news for customers in rural areas who are stuck on subpar Internet connections. If you have unreliable, slow DSL service, it might be a good idea to download some shows when you're not making heavy use of the Internet and watch them later without any buffering.\nSatellite users often have very restrictive monthly data caps but are given unlimited data for a few hours in the middle of the night. We could see a Netflix user downloading shows during those hours when the connection is unmetered, but Netflix's new download feature isn't completely ideal for that scenario. Netflix did not mention any plans for scheduling downloads or bringing downloads to devices besides iPhones, iPads, and Android phones and tablets. A startup called Aterlo Networks we wrote about last year solves that problem by letting customers schedule recordings for the middle of the night and cache them locally so they can be viewed on any device connected to a home Wi-Fi network.\nNetflix executives have previously denied any plans to make video available offline, even saying in 2014 that offline video watching is \" never going to happen .\" Adding downloads helps Netflix match a feature already offered by Amazon's streaming video service.\nDownloads and offline viewing would have been quite useful for many Netflix customers a couple of years ago when the company was battling Comcast and other large ISPs over whether it should have to pay for direct network connections to improve quality. Netflix had widespread quality problems at that time, and it still highlights the differences in quality among ISPs by publishing average speeds on its ISP Speed Index .\nNetflix has been an outspoken opponent of home Internet data caps, recently asking the Federal Communications Commission to declare the caps \" unreasonable .\"",

      "text": "Netflix Is Finally Allowing You To Download Their Shows And Movies Josh Kurp More NETFLIX We’ve all been there: you’re streaming Orange Is the New Black or Stranger Things or Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt (for a third time) while riding the subway, or in the backseat of a car, when suddenly, boom, you lose the internet connection. That’s not a problem any longer: Netflix is, as promised , finally letting you download certain shows and movies for off-line viewing. According to a press release : \nMany of your favorite streaming series and movies are already available for download, with more on the way, so there is plenty of content available for those times when you are offline. For example, Orange is The New Black , Narcos , and The Crown are available for download today. ( Via ) Eddy Wu, Netflix’s director of product innovation, said the downloads feature, which Amazon Prime Video debuted last year, was introduced because “while many members enjoy watching Netflix at home, we’ve often heard they also want to continue their Stranger Things ’ binge while on airplanes and other places where internet is expensive or limited.” There’s no need to make awkward chit-chat with strangers while 40,000 feet in the air ever again. BoJack Horseman season three is the only company you need. The feature is currently available through the Netflix app for all plans. Airplane mode. Road trip mode. Stuck-in-the-subway-for-20-minutes mode. Your favorite stories are now available for download any time. pic.twitter.com/g7QZA3TyE8",

      "text": "Netflix Inc. is making some TV shows and movies available for download to watch offline, providing its users a feature that has become a must-have for binge-watchers.\nMany fans have requested to watch Netflix content without an internet connection, especially those in emerging markets with limited internet access. The world's largest online TV network will roll out the feature on phones and tablets for all subscribers, but only for select shows such as \"The Crown\" and \"Orange is the New Black\" at first, according to a statement Wednesday.\nNetflix has been signaling it would add a downloading option in recent months, as a way to continue increasing its subscriber base and match video-streaming Amazon.com. Offline viewing will make Netflix shows more accessible to customers around the world, particularly in developing markets in Asia and Africa.\nNetflix has 86.7 million customers worldwide, 47.5 million of whom live in the U.S. The company now relies on international markets for most of its growth, and earlier this year expanded its footprint to the entire world, save for China, Syria, North Korea and Crimea.\n\"While many members enjoy watching Netflix at home, we've often heard they also want to continue their 'Stranger Things' binge while on airplanes and other places where internet is expensive or limited,\" said Eddy Wu, Netflix's director of product innovation, in a web post.\nPrivacy Policy Copyright © 2016, Chicago Tribune",

      "text": "If you’re a Netflix fan, you’ve probably found yourself stuck in the subway or on an airplane or somewhere else without Internet access, and wished that you could be watching Orange Is the New Black or Stranger Things instead of twiddling your thumbs.\nIf that’s the case, then Netflix NFLX has just given you--and millions like you--an early Christmas present. The company announced on Wednesday that it is rolling out the ability to download movies and TV shows for offline viewing.\nAirplane mode. Road trip mode. Stuck-in-the-subway-for-20-minutes mode. Your favorite stories are now available for download any time. pic.twitter.com/g7QZA3TyE8 \n— Netflix US (@netflix) November 30, 2016 \n\nThere are a few caveats to this gift, however, including the fact that not all of the content on Netflix is available for download. For the most part, the new feature applies to Netflix’s original TV shows or movies, as opposed to shows licensed from other providers--although that could change because the company said “more are on the way.”\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter. \nNetflix said new versions of its Android googl and iOS aapl apps are due out soon that will incorporate the new feature. A “download” button will appear next to the title for shows and movies that allow offline viewing, and there will be two options offered: standard quality and high quality. It’s not clear what resolution high-quality refers to, or how much space it will take up.\nWhat’s interesting about the new feature is that for some time, Netflix maintained that that it had no interest in offering downloading for offline viewing, although it started to soften that stance earlier this year with a few hints about possibly offering downloads. So what changed?\n@pkafka @Lucas_Shaw top requested feature for years. First excuse was world going to be wifi-covered. Second excuse, users don't want it.\n— Jason Hirschhorn (@JasonHirschhorn) November 30, 2016 \n\nOne thing that probably helped change the company’s mind was the expansion into new international markets, which happened in January, when the service rolled out into more than 190 countries. International expansion is a key part of its plan to boost future growth and justify its sky-high stock price.\nIn many of those countries, particularly in emerging markets, high-speed Internet access and ubiquitous wireless aren’t as common as they are in most of North America, and that can make streaming a movie or TV show a challenge. Offline downloading will help viewers in those countries get access to the service more easily.\nDownload using work internet. Watch at home over the weekend. This; your African subscribers will really truly appreciate. https://t.co/37TrAIMk51 \n— Lydia Namubiru (@namlyd) November 30, 2016 \n\nThe other thing that probably helped change Netflix’s position on downloading is the growing threat of competition from e-commerce giant Amazon AMZN and its Prime Video offering, which has offered the feature for some time now. YouTube Red also allows offline viewing.\nAmazon amzn has made no secret of the fact that it would very much like to become Netflix, or at least eat into the company’s dominance. The web giant has been spending big for movies and TV shows like Manchester by the Sea and The Grand Tour , and it recently announced that it too is expanding into more than 200 international markets.",

      "text": "News \nIf there's one feature that people have been clamoring for Netflix to add more than any other, it's offline viewing. It seems like the lords of Netflix have finally heard our prayers, as Netflix has just added the option to download and watch content without an Internet connection. \nThis long-awaited option is rolling out now. I've already received the update on my Nexus 6P (no, not a Pixel XL) and the experience seems to be pretty solid. In the hamburger menu, there's an option to access \"My Downloads\" near the top. Clicking on that will, predictably, bring you to all of the videos you've downloaded, and hitting \"Find something to download\" will bring you to a comprehensive list of the content available to download. In addition, Netflix has added an option to enable/disable WiFi only downloads (you'll probably want to leave this on unless you have unlimited data) and a storage bar where you can see how much storage you've used and how much of that is Netflix downloads. \nUnfortunately, not all movies and TV shows are available to watch offline (at least for now). For instance, Top Gear isn't available to download, so Netflix recommends other \"similar\" videos. I'm not really sure how similar An Idiot Abroad is to Top Gear , but I guess they both contain idiots. Downloading is simple; just click the download icon next to the episode or movie you'd like to view offline, and the download will begin. To remind you, Netflix puts a progress bar in your notifications and a blue bar on the bottom of the app. According to this Netflix help page , there's supposed to be a toggle between \"Standard\" and \"Higher\" quality for downloads under settings; it doesn't look like that's on my device yet. Both Netflix's iOS and Android apps are already receiving updates to support this feature, so if you have a flight to catch soon, you may be able to download a movie quickly.",

Netflix users can now download some shows and movies to watch offline By Anita Balakrishnan | CNBC – 31 minutes ago 118.88 +1.37 \"Orange is the New Black\" is among several Netflix shows and films that can now be watched offline, thanks to a new \"download\" feature that the company announced on Wednesday. \nThe features is available for phones and tablets on Android 4.4.2 or higher and iOS 8 and above, by updating the Netflix app, the company said in a statement. Popular shows like \"Narcos,\"\"Stranger Things,\"\"Breaking Bad,\" and \"Blacklist\" are available for download, as are films such as \"Spotlight,\"\"Limitless,\" and \"Burn After Reading.\" \nOf course, downloading the content still uses data and requires an internet connection, but the new feature means users worldwide can access the show while on airplanes or travelling in the subway. There's no extra cost for Netflix members. \nIn a CNBC interview earlier this month, chief content officer Ted Sarandos had hinted at a new offline mode to help audiences where high internet speeds are not present. \nThe entertainment technology company said in October it would increasingly focus on programming like \"Stranger Things,\" both produced and owned by Netflix, because it would give the company more flexibility with the rights to its content . Netflix has faced growing competition from services like Amazon , which offers selected downloads in addition to streaming. \n— CNBC's Elizabeth Gurdus and Arujun Kharpal contributed to this report.

      "text": "Winston Cook-Wilson   CREDIT: Michael Loccisano / Getty Images \nNetflix has finally gone the way of music streaming services, and is now offering users offline access to certain titles on Apple and Android devices. The first swatch of programming that users will gain access to includes mostly the service’s original and exclusive programming. Selected titles (rejoice, ye Crown fans!) are becoming available today, provided that you have at least iOS 8.0 or Android 4.4.2 working on your device, as well as the latest update of Netflix’s app. \nNetflix’s director of program innovation, Eddy Wu, blogged to announce the feature. “While many members enjoy watching Netflix at home,” Wu wrote, “we’ve often heard they also want to continue their Stranger Things binge while on airplanes and other places where internet is expensive or limited.” It’s hard to remember a time when Stranger Things didn’t exist, and we weren’t constantly reading about what new music video its child actors were in, or what they just posted on social media, all the time. With Netflix offline streaming breeding even more stans of the show, the pre- Stranger Things days may become just a distant memory. \nIn order to get that show onto your phone, or whatever Netflix offering you may be unhappily addicted to at the moment, simply get the “Download” button on the selection’s “Details” page.",

Reports indicate the first downloadable programs will include \"Orange is the New Black\" and \"The Crown,\" but \"House of Cards\" is expected to be available for the new feature when Season 5 comes out early next year. Airplane mode. Road trip mode. Stuck-in-the-subway-for-20-minutes mode. Your favorite stories are now available for download any time. pic.twitter.com/g7QZA3TyE8 \nCopyright 2016 WAVE 3 News .  ",

Netflix hasn't released a full list of compatible shows, but it appears to mostly favor Netflix originals like \"Narcos\" and \"Stranger Things.\" It's unclear how many licensed titles from third parties will be available to download. \nAmazon Video, which offers thousands of free TV shows and movies for Prime members, lets you download just about any video for offline viewing. Netflix appears to be taking a more cautious approach to video downloads for now. \nThe \"Available for Download\" section on Netflix does include a variety of third-party shows and movies though, including \"Parks and Recreation,\" \"Mad Men,\" and a bunch of documentaries. Netflix said in a statement that \"many more\" titles are coming. \nScreenshot \nNetflix downloads work on iOS and Android devices. You'll need to update your Netflix app to the latest version, which launches Wednesday. A download button will appear next to the videos you can store for offline viewing. \nLike this: \nNetflix \nNetflix has historically been against allowing offline viewing, even as recently as the end of last year. But executives have loosened their opposition to video downloads this year, leading many to speculate it'd happen soon. Well, here it is, even if it's pretty limited for now. \nFindTheCompany | Graphiq",

      "text": "\nWhen it comes to convenience, it’s hard to beat Netflix. You can stream shows to your living room TV, to your tablet while you’re at the gym, to your smartphone while you’re waiting in a checkout line. The one big catch has been that you need an internet connection to do it. Netflix is great if you’re looking to pass time while riding the bus; less so if you’re headed to a subway with no wifi connection.\nWell, as of today, that restriction is being removed. Netflix has announced it’s finally offering offline mode to its customers. Even better, this new feature comes at no additional cost to customers. \nThe company announced Netflix offline viewing on Twitter and on its own website .\nAirplane mode. Road trip mode. Stuck-in-the-subway-for-20-minutes mode. Your favorite stories are now available for download any time. pic.twitter.com/g7QZA3TyE8 \n— Netflix US (@netflix) November 30, 2016 \n\nStarting today, Netflix offline mode is included with all streaming subscription packages. All you need is a device running iOS 8.0 or Android 4.4.2 and up, and the latest update of the Netflix app. Once you’ve got that, you’ll see a Download button, like so:\n\nNot all shows and movies will be available to download. To start with, it looks the selection includes most or all of Netflix’s original content. There’s also a limited variety of other movies and shows, with more promised to be on the way. Once you’ve downloaded the programs you want to watch, you can go into the “My Downloads” menu to see what you have accessible offline.\nThe offline playback feature is one that customers have been requesting for a long time. In the past, though, Netflix has downplayed or dismissed the possibility of adding such a feature, even going so far as to say that offline mode would “never” happen. But earlier this year, CEO Reed Hastings said the company wanted to “keep an open mind” about a download-and-go option. Not long afterward, we started hearing reports that Netflix was looking into it, and that the option could arrive by the end of 2016.\nThe post Netflix Offline Playback Is Finally Here appeared first on /Film .\n",

Netflix hasn't released a full list of compatible shows, but it appears to mostly favor Netflix originals like \"Narcos\" and \"Stranger Things.\" It's unclear how many licensed titles from third parties will be available to download. \nAmazon Video, which offers thousands of free TV shows and movies for Prime members, lets you download just about any video for offline viewing. Netflix appears to be taking a more cautious approach to video downloads for now. \nThe \"Available for Download\" section on Netflix does include a variety of third-party shows and movies though, including \"Parks and Recreation,\" \"Mad Men,\" and a bunch of documentaries. Netflix said in a statement that \"many more\" titles are coming. \nScreenshot \nNetflix downloads work on iOS and Android devices. You'll need to update your Netflix app to the latest version, which launches Wednesday. A download button will appear next to the videos you can store for offline viewing. \nLike this: \nNetflix \nNetflix has historically been against allowing offline viewing, even as recently as the end of last year. But executives have loosened their opposition to video downloads this year, leading many to speculate it'd happen soon. Well, here it is, even if it's pretty limited for now. \nFindTheCompany | Graphiq",

      "text": "Netflix will let you download video to go, but not movies and shows from Disney It will work on your iOS and Android devices, starting today. After hinting at it for months , Netflix is finally letting its users download some of its shows and movies, so they can watch them when they don’t have an internet connection. Some other streaming services, notably Netflix rival Amazon, have already offered the same feature. In countries like the U.S., it’s a nice option for people on planes and other scenarios where they won’t have readily available Wi-Fi. But Netflix has said it is most concerned about customers in developing countries, where internet connections aren’t always cheap and/or available. “As we expand around the world, where we see an uneven set of networks, it’s something we should keep an open mind about,” CEO Reed Hastings said in April. Netflix hasn’t said how many of its movies and shows will be available for download, though the company emphasized Netflix originals in a blog post announcing the move. A Netflix rep said the one notable omission will be Disney-owned shows and movies. That includes new releases like “Zootopia,” as well catalog stuff like “Fantasia.” And it also includes Netflix exclusives made in conjunction with Disney, like the new Marvel superhero shows “Jessica Jones” and “Luke Cage.” No comment from Netflix about why the Disney titles aren’t available. A reasonable assumption would be that Disney wants to reserve those rights for its own download service, which it hasn’t launched but has been considering for years. Netflix’s download option is available for users with iOS and Android devices , using an update of the company’s app that’s out today. Once you have it, you can see what titles Netflix is offering for download by looking at a new “available for download” tab. Here’s what that looks like on my iPhone: recode_divider",

      "text": "Netflix will now let you download videos and watch them offline  12 AM Steve Kovach - Business Insider \nNetflix announced Wednesday that it will let you download videos and watch them even if your device isn't connected to the internet. \nHowever, there appear to be some limitations. \nNot all videos will work with the new offline mode. Netflix hasn't released a full list of compatible shows, but it appears to mostly favor Netflix originals like \"Narcos\" and \"Stranger Things.\" It's unclear how many licensed titles from third parties will be available to download. \nAmazon Video, which offers thousands of free TV shows and movies for Prime members, lets you download just about any video for offline viewing. Netflix appears to be taking a more cautious approach to video downloads for now. \nThe \"Available for Download\" section on Netflix does include a variety of third-party shows and movies though, including \"Parks and Recreation,\" \"Mad Men,\" and a bunch of documentaries. Netflix said in a statement that \"many more\" titles are coming. \nScreenshot \nNetflix downloads work on iOS and Android devices. You'll need to update your Netflix app to the latest version, which launches Wednesday. A download button will appear next to the videos you can store for offline viewing. \nLike this: \nNetflix \nNetflix has historically been against allowing offline viewing, even as recently as the end of last year. But executives have loosened their opposition to video downloads this year, leading many to speculate it'd happen soon. Well, here it is, even if it's pretty limited for now. \nFindTheCompany | Graphiq",

More and more consumers are watching video content on the go where cellular and wireless internet connections can be spotty, at best. The feature is available Wednesday for all plans and across all available devices, Director of Product Innovation Eddy Wu wrote in a blog post on the company's site. It's not clear exactly how many series and films are available for download. In the blog post Wu writes many of viewers favorite series are available, with more on the way. Shares of Netflix are up nearly 3% in the year to date, underperforming the S&P 500 Index , which is up almost 8%. \nContinue Reading Below ",

      "text": "\n© 2016 Time Inc. All rights reserved. Here’s Why Netflix Is Finally Letting You Download Movies and TV Shows \nIf you’re a Netflix fan, you’ve probably found yourself stuck in the subway or on an airplane or somewhere else without Internet access, and wished that you could be watching Orange Is the New Black or Stranger Things instead of twiddling your thumbs. \nIf that’s the case, then Netflix NFLX has just given you—and millions like you—an early Christmas present. The company announced on Wednesday that it is rolling out the ability to download movies and TV shows for offline viewing. Airplane mode. Road trip mode. Stuck-in-the-subway-for-20-minutes mode. Your favorite stories are now available for download any time. pic.twitter.com/g7QZA3TyE8 \n— Netflix US (@netflix) November 30, 2016 \nThere are a few caveats to this gift, however, including the fact that not all of the content on Netflix is available for download. For the most part, the new feature applies to Netflix’s original TV shows or movies, as opposed to shows licensed from other providers—although that could change because the company said “more are on the way.” Get Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter. \nNetflix said new versions of its Android googl and iOS aapl apps are due out soon that will incorporate the new feature. A “download” button will appear next to the title for shows and movies that allow offline viewing, and there will be two options offered: standard quality and high quality. It’s not clear what resolution high-quality refers to, or how much space it will take up. \nWhat’s interesting about the new feature is that for some time, Netflix maintained that that it had no interest in offering downloading for offline viewing, although it started to soften that stance earlier this year with a few hints about possibly offering downloads. So what changed? @pkafka @Lucas_Shaw top requested feature for years. First excuse was world going to be wifi-covered. Second excuse, users don't want it. \n— Jason Hirschhorn (@JasonHirschhorn) November 30, 2016 \nOne thing that probably helped change the company’s mind was the expansion into new international markets, which happened in January, when the service rolled out into more than 190 countries. International expansion is a key part of its plan to boost future growth and justify its sky-high stock price. \nIn many of those countries, particularly in emerging markets, high-speed Internet access and ubiquitous wireless aren’t as common as they are in most of North America, and that can make streaming a movie or TV show a challenge. Offline downloading will help viewers in those countries get access to the service more easily. Download using work internet. Watch at home over the weekend. This; your African subscribers will really truly appreciate. https://t.co/37TrAIMk51 \n— Lydia Namubiru (@namlyd) November 30, 2016 \nThe other thing that probably helped change Netflix’s position on downloading is the growing threat of competition from e-commerce giant Amazon AMZN and its Prime Video offering, which has offered the feature for some time now. YouTube Red also allows offline viewing. \nAmazon amzn has made no secret of the fact that it would very much like to become Netflix, or at least eat into the company’s dominance. The web giant has been spending big for movies and TV shows like Manchester by the Sea and The Grand Tour , and it recently announced that it too is expanding into more than 200 international markets.

      "text": "Netflix will now let you download videos and watch them offline  12 AM Steve Kovach - Business Insider \nNetflix announced Wednesday that it will let you download videos and watch them even if your device isn't connected to the internet. \nHowever, there appear to be some limitations. \nNot all videos will work with the new offline mode. Netflix hasn't released a full list of compatible shows, but it appears to mostly favor Netflix originals like \"Narcos\" and \"Stranger Things.\" It's unclear how many licensed titles from third parties will be available to download. \nAmazon Video, which offers thousands of free TV shows and movies for Prime members, lets you download just about any video for offline viewing. Netflix appears to be taking a more cautious approach to video downloads for now. \nThe \"Available for Download\" section on Netflix does include a variety of third-party shows and movies though, including \"Parks and Recreation,\" \"Mad Men,\" and a bunch of documentaries. Netflix said in a statement that \"many more\" titles are coming. \nScreenshot \nNetflix downloads work on iOS and Android devices. You'll need to update your Netflix app to the latest version, which launches Wednesday. A download button will appear next to the videos you can store for offline viewing. \nLike this: \nNetflix \nNetflix has historically been against allowing offline viewing, even as recently as the end of last year. But executives have loosened their opposition to video downloads this year, leading many to speculate it'd happen soon. Well, here it is, even if it's pretty limited for now. \nFindTheCompany | Graphiq",

      "text": "Netflix will now let you download videos and watch them offline  12 AM Steve Kovach - Business Insider \nNetflix announced Wednesday that it will let you download videos and watch them even if your device isn't connected to the internet. \nHowever, there appear to be some limitations. \nNot all videos will work with the new offline mode. Netflix hasn't released a full list of compatible shows, but it appears to mostly favor Netflix originals like \"Narcos\" and \"Stranger Things.\" It's unclear how many licensed titles from third parties will be available to download. \nAmazon Video, which offers thousands of free TV shows and movies for Prime members, lets you download just about any video for offline viewing. Netflix appears to be taking a more cautious approach to video downloads for now. \nThe \"Available for Download\" section on Netflix does include a variety of third-party shows and movies though, including \"Parks and Recreation,\" \"Mad Men,\" and a bunch of documentaries. Netflix said in a statement that \"many more\" titles are coming. \nScreenshot \nNetflix downloads work on iOS and Android devices. You'll need to update your Netflix app to the latest version, which launches Wednesday. A download button will appear next to the videos you can store for offline viewing. \nLike this: \nNetflix \nNetflix has historically been against allowing offline viewing, even as recently as the end of last year. But executives have loosened their opposition to video downloads this year, leading many to speculate it'd happen soon. Well, here it is, even if it's pretty limited for now. \nFindTheCompany | Graphiq",

      "text": "After indicating that it was warming to the idea, Netflix announced Wednesday that it has added an option that enables subscribers worldwide to download certain titles and play them back on smartphones and tablets while offline. \n\nRELATED: Netflix Said to Be Getting Down With Downloading \n\n“While many members enjoy watching Netflix at home, we’ve often heard they also want to continue their Stranger Things binge while on airplanes and other places where Internet is expensive or limited. Just click the download button on the details page for a film or TV series and you can watch it later without an internet connection,” Eddy Wu, director of product innovation at Netflix, explained in this blog post. \n\nNot all of the Netflix streaming library supports the download option, though Netflix originals such as Orange is The New Black, Narcos and The Crown are among those that are offered for download today. \n\nWu noted that the feature is offered on all Netflix plans and supported on apps running on Android and iOS smartphones and tablets. \n\nNetflix CEO Reed Hastings signaled in April that the company was giving a download option a closer look. \n\n“We should keep an open mind on this,” he said then. “We've been so focused on click-and-watch and the beauty and simplicity of streaming. But as we expand around the world, where we see an uneven set of networks, it's something we should keep an open mind about.” \n\nThe option enables Netflix to catch up to Amazon Prime, which also supports downloading for a portion of its library. \n\nOthers in the video realm also allow downloads for offline viewing. Comcast, for example, lets its subs download a subset of its TV Everywhere library and allows X1 customers to check-out/sideload shows and movies recorded to its cloud DVR system. The new Starz app (for its OTT service and TVE offering) allows subs to download most of its library. Dish’s new $99 portable video device, HopperGO, lets subs take DVR-recorded TV shows and movies on the road for offline viewing. \n\nRELATED: Dish Pitches Free HopperGO to New Subs \n\nThe new Netflix option could also erase some of the value and benefits of PlayOn Cloud, a new offering from MediaMall Technologies that enables users to record and download movies and shows from Netflix, Amazon Video, Hulu, HBO Now and other subscription services.",

      "text": "by Brandon Hill — Wednesday, November 30, 2016 Netflix Adds Offline Playback To Its Movie And TV Show Streaming Empire It’s been rumored for quite some time , but now it’s finally here. Netflix today announced that it is bringing offline playback functionality for all of its customers. Offline playback is currently available with the latest Netflix apps for both Apple’s iOS and Google’s Android platforms.\n“While many members enjoy watching Netflix at home, we’ve often heard they also want to continue their Stranger Things binge while on airplanes and other places where internet is expensive or limited,” explains Netflix. “Just click the download button on the details page for a film or TV series and you can watch it later without an internet connection.” Airplane mode. Road trip mode. Stuck-in-the-subway-for-20-minutes mode. Your favorite stories are now available for download any time. pic.twitter.com/g7QZA3TyE8 — Netflix US (@netflix) November 30, 2016 \nBut before you start jumping for joy at the thoughts of Netflix’s entire streaming library being available for offline playback, there are some restrictions. For now, all TV shows produced by Netflix — including Stranger Things, Orange is The New Black, Narcos and The Crown — are supported along with a number of NBC shows like The Office and 30 Rock . You’ll also find AMC hits like Mad Men and Breaking Bad . \nOn the movie side, you’ll run across titles like Pulp Fiction, Dazed and Confused, Good Will Hunting and Minions . Given that offline playback is just now launching, it’s understandable that supported titles are still a bit spotty. However, as Netflix works out rights issues with content providers, we should see the number of available programming for offline playback expand as the new year approaches. \nIt should be noted that there are some other concessions to offline playback as outlined by this entry on Netflix’s help page : \nStandard quality is a slightly lower video resolution that requires less storage space and takes less time to download. Higher quality is a higher video resolution that requires more storage space and takes more time to download. \nIn practice, the standard quality setting is passable when it comes to image quality, while the high quality setting (which still doesn’t give the you the highest resolution available with streaming options) will be your best option at the expense of storage space. The bottom line is that streaming is still your best bet if you want the highest video playback quality possible, while you’ll have to “settle” with the offline viewing option. \nOverall, this is a welcome move by Netflix for customers that want to take advantage of the movies and TV shows that the company has to offer, but don’t always have a stable internet connection when on-the-go.",

      "text": "by Karl Bode Wednesday Nov 30 2016 10:37 EST \nIn a bit of good news for those of you hamstrung by unnecessary usage caps, Netflix today announced that it will be letting its streaming customers download video content. According to a Netflix announcement , users can now download select titles in the Netflix catalog for free. Rumors of such a feature have been popping up for much of the last year , though there had been some indications Netflix was only going to enable the option in some foreign markets. \"While many members enjoy watching Netflix at home, we’ve often heard they also want to continue their Stranger Things binge while on airplanes and other places where Internet is expensive or limited,\" notes Netflix. \nThe company says streaming customers will simply have to click the download button on the details page for a film or TV series, allowing them to view the content later without an internet connection. \nSo far it looks like the functionality is only available for Android or iOS users (at least I didn't see the option on the desktop platform as of this writing). Netflix also makes it clear that not all titles are supported, noting that only Netflix titles like Orange is The New Black, Narcos and The Crown are available for download today, with an unspecified number of additional titles \"on the way.\" \nWith a growing number of ISPs using a lack of broadband market competition to saddle users with technically unnecessary usage caps , the ability to download titles -- combined with Netflix's past efforts to give users control over streaming quality -- is a welcome aid.",

      "text": "Netflix will now let you download videos and watch them offline  12 AM Steve Kovach - Business Insider \nNetflix announced Wednesday that it will let you download videos and watch them even if your device isn't connected to the internet. \nHowever, there appear to be some limitations. \nNot all videos will work with the new offline mode. Netflix hasn't released a full list of compatible shows, but it appears to mostly favor Netflix originals like \"Narcos\" and \"Stranger Things.\" It's unclear how many licensed titles from third parties will be available to download. \nAmazon Video, which offers thousands of free TV shows and movies for Prime members, lets you download just about any video for offline viewing. Netflix appears to be taking a more cautious approach to video downloads for now. \nThe \"Available for Download\" section on Netflix does include a variety of third-party shows and movies though, including \"Parks and Recreation,\" \"Mad Men,\" and a bunch of documentaries. Netflix said in a statement that \"many more\" titles are coming. \nScreenshot \nNetflix downloads work on iOS and Android devices. You'll need to update your Netflix app to the latest version, which launches Wednesday. A download button will appear next to the videos you can store for offline viewing. \nLike this: \nNetflix \nNetflix has historically been against allowing offline viewing, even as recently as the end of last year. But executives have loosened their opposition to video downloads this year, leading many to speculate it'd happen soon. Well, here it is, even if it's pretty limited for now. \nFindTheCompany | Graphiq",

Many fans have requested to watch Netflix content without an internet connection, especially those in emerging markets with limited internet access. The world's largest online TV network will roll out the feature on phones and tablets for all subscribers, but only for select shows such as \"The Crown\" and \"Orange is the New Black\" at first, according to a statement Wednesday. Netflix has been signaling it would add a downloading option in recent months, as a way to continue increasing its subscriber base and match video-streaming Amazon.com . Offline viewing will make Netflix shows more accessible to customers around the world, particularly in developing markets in Asia and Africa. VIDEOS TOP JOBS Netflix has 86.7 million customers worldwide, 47.5 million of whom live in the U.S. The company now relies on international markets for most of its growth, and earlier this year expanded its footprint to the entire world, save for China, Syria, North Korea and Crimea. \"While many members enjoy watching Netflix at home, we've often heard they also want to continue their 'Stranger Things' binge while on airplanes and other places where internet is expensive or limited,\" said Eddy Wu, Netflix's director of product innovation, in a web post.",

      "text": "framingham state university Share this article \nYears before the Girls were available on Netflix, my grandma and I watched and rewatched every episode on DVD. It was a tradition for us to watch entire series repeatedly. Around 7 we would sit down in the living room with our TV tray tables and whatever deliciousness she cooked up. We would watch whatever we were in the middle of, but no show was watched more than Gilmore Girls. Our order would go something like Gilmore Girls, Dawson’s creek, Gilmore Girls, One Tree Hill, Gilmore Girls, Grey’s Anatomy, etc. So when we heard our favorite show was coming back the excitement was too much. On November 25 we sat down with a bag of chips, Crystal Light iced tea, and then proceeded to watch every episode one after the other. After stirring with it for a couple days we came back together to discuss the master peace we had just watched. \nRichard \nWe started our discussion off with Richard Gilmores death. He is the Domino effect for many of the transitions you see the girls go through. Lorelai’s doubts, Emily’s…. everything. Grandma liked how they handled the situation and the timing, having his death be a few months prior. It was expected, we all knew it was going to happen. Richards death must be one of the most heartbreaking deaths that we’ve had to endure while watching a show. He had his moments but true GG fans love him and his sequin vest. \nEmily \nThe jeans, the children, the DAR, that portrait... \nStars Hollow the musical \nHer rating for the entire revival were “4 stars and most of the 5th one filled up”. That empty space is for the musical. We both hated it. It was long and irrelevant. The musical took too much precious time away. \nEmily’s mere miss with death \nMy grandma didn’t see it but when Emily is in Nantucket the night of Lorelai and Luke’s wedding, I was almost certain she was gonna die. I didn’t want her to but for some reason when she was slipping on her shoes it felt like the end. \nLife and death brigade reunion \nWe have mixed feelings on this scene. It’s very obvious that it’s an imitation of a scene from the Across the Universe. I couldn’t tell if the creators did it this way because the show has always been filled with references from other mediums in pop culture or if it came from a lack of originality. Either way grandma did enjoy it because it was a natural way to bring that gang back together. \nBerta/Gypsy the Maid \nWe love that they had Rose Abdoo come back not only for her classic role as Gypsy but as Berta Emily’s new maid. Having Berta’s family move in adds to the transformation of Emily. As a grieving widow Emily doesn’t seem to care or be able keep up with her surroundings. She doesn’t notice herself becoming more empathetic. Logan/deedee: Grandma absolutely hated this! Yes, we realize that this goes along with the “bringing it full circle” but really Rory? Dean and Lindsey all over again. \nSookie \nGrandma wants more… \nJess, Logan, and Dean controversy \nSo much wasted time taking sides. Anyways we all know in the VERY end it’s Jess. \nLuke and Lorelai \nShe loved how the progression of their relationship seemed very compatible with how it was during the series. There isn’t much to say here other than perfect! \nRory and Lorelai \nThe most notable change is Lorelai lets Rory make decisions and (other than the book) doesn’t interfere. For example, with Dean Lorelai and Rory got in a massive fight when Rory had sex with him. But with Logan she doesn’t give too much of an opinion. Our favorite mother daughter duo has grown a lot personally, but for the most part their amazing relationship is not too different. \nEmily and Lorelai \nNow these two have made some serious improvements! Yes, the way they treat each other for most of the revival is the same. In the end though, you can sense a peace between the mother and daughter that they didn’t have before. \nMr. Kim \nIT’S FREAKIN MR. KIM! \nThe last four words… \nWell Grandma predicted this one. I still have no words. \n\nAll in all, this revival was love and Grandma’s reaction to the critiques is perfectly summed up in this Gif You Might Also Enjoy",

      "text": "Netflix will now let you download videos and watch them offline  12 AM Steve Kovach - Business Insider \nNetflix announced Wednesday that it will let you download videos and watch them even if your device isn't connected to the internet. \nHowever, there appear to be some limitations. \nNot all videos will work with the new offline mode. Netflix hasn't released a full list of compatible shows, but it appears to mostly favor Netflix originals like \"Narcos\" and \"Stranger Things.\" It's unclear how many licensed titles from third parties will be available to download. \nAmazon Video, which offers thousands of free TV shows and movies for Prime members, lets you download just about any video for offline viewing. Netflix appears to be taking a more cautious approach to video downloads for now. \nThe \"Available for Download\" section on Netflix does include a variety of third-party shows and movies though, including \"Parks and Recreation,\" \"Mad Men,\" and a bunch of documentaries. Netflix said in a statement that \"many more\" titles are coming. \nScreenshot \nNetflix downloads work on iOS and Android devices. You'll need to update your Netflix app to the latest version, which launches Wednesday. A download button will appear next to the videos you can store for offline viewing. \nLike this: \nNetflix \nNetflix has historically been against allowing offline viewing, even as recently as the end of last year. But executives have loosened their opposition to video downloads this year, leading many to speculate it'd happen soon. Well, here it is, even if it's pretty limited for now. \nFindTheCompany | Graphiq",

      "text": "Netflix calls out adblockers using Black Mirror's dark satire of modern technology By Tony Connelly - 30 November 2016 15:16pm Netflix's answer to adblocking \nNetflix is calling out adblockers in a bold campaign that echoes the dark and twisted themes from its Black Mirror series to address people using the software. \nWhen people with adblockers visit certain sites, they will be greeted with a banner promoting the show and a message saying, “Hello ad blocker user. You cannot see the ad. But the ad can see you”. \nThe stunt is in the spirit of Black Mirror’s dark satire of modern technology and has been created by MullenLowe Mediahub as a way of ensuring the marketing for the show can still reach people who have adblocker software installed. \n@TheNextWeb @netflix As an avid Adblock user I thought this ad was great. If more companies did ads like this, I wouldn't need an adblocker pic.twitter.com/uOlipYMqDF \n— Stephen Briles (@Steve_Briles) October 21, 2016 \nNon-ad block users will see a regular display promoting the show but both versions will link through to Netflix where users can watch it. \n“We want to target this hard-to-reach audience and find a creative way to get their attention,” said Sean Corcoran, executive director of digital media and innovation for MullenLowe Mediahub. “We think it’s fun to talk to ad blockers directly. And in the spirit of the show, we are letting people know that they really cannot run.” \nThe intrusive nature of the campaign has left many publishers apprehensive about implementing it with only Slate, Mashable and The Next Web agreeing to promote the campaign. \nThe stunt manages to circumvent adblock software by detecting the JavaScript variable code used to shut out the ads and changing the background accordingly. \nThe Next Web’s director of partnerships, Rey Caacbay, revealed that it charges Netflix on a CPM basis for the campaign, which is roughly three to four times more than the normal rate. \nThis article is about: World , netflix , adblocking , Black Mirror , Advertising , Technology , Brand Tony Connelly \nI cover media, marketing and sponsorship news within the sports industry.

Netflix made the announcement via its Twitter account and said, \"Airplane mode. Road trip mode. Stuck-in-the-subway-for-20-minutes mode. Your favorite stories are now available for download any time.\" The initial selection of shows and movies that can be downloaded is rather small, but should expand over time. A new version of the Netflix app is being made available to Android and iOS devices today that supports offline playback. The feature does not cost extra to use.

      "text": "You Can Now Download (Some) Netflix Content Every frequent flyer’s dream come true. By Evan Saathoff Nov. 30, 2016 \nWell, it finally happened. They finally did it. After this, I’m not sure how much farther we can go as a species. \nNetflix has announced today that you can now download some of its content to watch offline. I’m sure the offerings will grow, but for now it seems limited to original content and some movies. Still, nothing to shake a stick at, especially since it doesn’t cost you anything extra. Ya bum. \nThis is already out there. All you have to do is makes sure your mobile device runs either iOS 8.0 or Android 4.4.2 with updated Netflix apps. If so, you should see a little download button while browsing episodes. All that’s left is for you to quit your job and never leave the house again.

      "text": "  Netflix Announces Offline Downloading for iOS and Android Devices Frequent flyers and train riders rejoice as Netflix announces an untethered option. The full catalog isn't supported and details are scarce. Posted on November 30, 2016 Page 1 Tweet \nSubscription video-on-demand leader Netflix announced this morning that it now supports offline downloading for iOS and Android phones and tablets. To view the option, subscribers need to update their Netflix app. The app now includes a category called Available for Download that lists content viewable offline. This option is offered for all subscription plans. \nDetails are scarce, but the downloading option isn't limited to Netflix originals. The Available for Download section shows plenty of movies and series created by other studios. Netflix hasn't said whether or not it has download agreements in place with some studios, and if the coverage will expand over time. Not all Netflix originals are in the Available to Download category. As of this writing, none of the Marvel superhero series, such as Jessica Jones and Luke Cage , are supported. \nSubscribers can select two resolution options for their downloads, Standard and Higher. Netflix doesn't spell out the actual resolution for either. The company suggests downloading over Wi-Fi to avoid data charges. \nAmazon Prime already offers offline downloading on mobile devices. In recent months, Netflix has softened its stance on the feature. The company is expanding into countries such as India where internet connectivity can be slow or spotty, and offline downloading means customers don't need to depend on a constant connection.

      "text": "LONDON — It's easy to dismiss Netflix's new series The Crown as just another period drama to fill the gaping hole left behind by Downton Abbey . But, look beyond the opulent costumes and posh accents and you'll see another story — one about the triumph of female strength in a world powered by men.\nSEE ALSO: How accurate is Netflix's 'The Crown'?\nOn 6 February 1952, a 25-year-old woman became queen of a realm ruled by men. That woman was Queen Elizabeth II. And that day heralded the beginning of a new Elizabethan age.\nThe grieving daughter of a beloved king had just inherited a post that hadn't been occupied by a woman for just over half a century. And, world leadership was no less patriarchal than it had been when the last female monarch, Queen Victoria, died in 1901.\nWhile many might see a woman thrust into the apex of power by a position gained through heredity — and not via a democratic process — as the antithesis of a feminist icon, The Crown says otherwise. This story is not one of unabashed privilege, but instead one of power, and a young woman's endeavours to retain the same authority, power and respect that her predecessors commanded.\nA woman in a man's world Claire Foy, who plays Elizabeth in The Crown , told Marie Claire that she sees Elizabeth as \"a protofeminist\".\n\"She's a complicated and interesting character who had to navigate a very male world, and did that by convincing other people their ideas were best when they were actually hers,\" says Foy.\nWhen Queen Elizabeth ascended the throne, 77-year-old Winston Churchill was at the helm of the British government and his cabinet was comprised entirely of male politicians. And, despite women receiving the right to stand for election to the House of Commons in 1918, there were few female MPs, according to royal historian Carolyn Harris . And, until 1960, the world was yet to elect its first ever female head of government.\nAn unimpressed Elizabeth challenges Winston Churchill.\nImage: netflix\n\"The Queen ascended to the throne at a time when the political sphere was dominated by men,\" Harris told Mashable . And not merely men, but men who had recently steered the country through the tumult of World War II.\nIn The Crown , we see a queen who not only takes her role seriously, but is also determined to be taken seriously. She is disappointed that her parents did not think it fit to provide her with a more robust education because of her gender and claims she knows \"almost nothing\". Conscious that her lack of education is a weakness, Elizabeth enlists a tutor so she can feel more confident when talking to politicians and public figures.\nGiving Churchill a dressing down Episode seven of the series sees a volte face in the power dynamic between the Queen and the government.\nIncreasingly frustrated with the cabinet's interference in her affairs, Elizabeth discovers that government ministers colluded to hide the fact Churchill had suffered a stroke and that Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden had gallstones.\nElizabeth confronts a tearful Churchill.\nImage: netflix\nWhen Elizabeth discovers this deception, which prevented her from fulfilling her role to \"ensure proper governance\", she confronts the man behind the collusion, cabinet minister Lord Salisbury.\n\"You have prevented me from doing my duty. You have hampered and bamboozled the proper functioning of the crown. How could you?\" shouts the Queen in what can only be described as a royal dressing down.\nThe Queen then confronts Churchill, informing him that his decision to withhold information with him directly contravenes the oath she took at her coronation to ensure the nation's prime minister is of sound health.\nElizabeth's words reduced Churchill — perhaps the greatest wartime prime minister to have ever lived — to tears and stunned silence. But, it's her final words to Churchill that really drive the point home.\n\"I would ask you to consider your response in light of the respect that my rank and my office deserve, not that which my age and gender might suggest,\" says Elizabeth.\nA modern woman in a traditional marriage It wasn't just government, however, that Elizabeth clashed with. The Crown shows Elizabeth and Philip's tumultuous relationship in the early years of his reign as Philip struggles with feelings of emasculation due to the power held by his wife. This portrayal of the conflict between Elizabeth's public role and private life has been confirmed by royal historians as accurate.\nOn the one hand, Elizabeth is a product of her generation. In 1950s Britain, a fresh emphasis was placed on the importance of marriage and family in society in the aftermath of the Second World War. In the show's first episode we witness the then-Princess Elizabeth promising to \"obey\" her husband during her wedding vows; an inclusion Churchill says she insisted upon.\nHowever, once Elizabeth becomes Queen, this promise to obey becomes increasingly difficult to keep. The first roadblock occurs in episode three when Elizabeth attempts to negotiate with Prime Minister Winston Churchill over the naming of the royal house and the location of her royal residence. Elizabeth wants the royal house to take Prince Philip's name, Mountbatten; something Churchill strongly advises against. She also asks to remain living at Clarence House, which she regards as her and Philip's family home.\nElizabeth and Philip's marriage was put under strain because of her role.\nImage: netflix\nAccording to royal biographer Gyles Brandreth, Prince Philip privately complained IRL: \"I am nothing but a bloody amoeba. I am the only man in the country not allowed to give his name to his own children.\"\nElizabeth eventually heeds the advice of the government and decides to keep the royal house in her name — Windsor — and moves to Buckingham Palace; much to Philip's protestations. Philip's feelings of emasculation continue throughout the series despite Elizabeth's initial efforts to prevent them. But, this initial aim to keep her husband happy soon becomes impossible to achieve because of the demands of her role and the royal protocols she must adhere to.\nPhilip was also forced to give up a promising naval career to support his wife in her role as sovereign and he had to walk behind the Queen during all public engagements — two aspects which could be considered a reversal in the traditional marital roles of the 1950s.\nElizabeth's role as Queen and her wish to protect the national interest remain her highest priorities at all times — often at the expense of her husband's feelings.\nA pillar of royal strength In addition to negotiating the patriarchal expectations of her private life, Elizabeth's public role sees her frequently lock horns in a male-dominated world. In her public duties, Elizabeth demands to be treated as a sovereign and not as a young woman and she fights to be taken seriously. Time and time again, she stands up to the most senior members of government — men who were titans of politics — to defend what she wants and believes.\nShe flouts royal protocol, disregards the advice of her private secretary and advisers, and goes against the wishes of her mother, sister and husband.\nOffscreen, these bold endeavours ensured the Queen retained — and even built upon — the power she inherited at the time of her accession.\nBONUS: Princess Charlotte and Prince George's balloon game reminds us of what childhood's really like",

      "text": "  \nReelgood is a free website to browse collections of NetFlix, Hulu, Amazon and more in one place . That means using this website, you will be able to explore all the movies and TV shows which can be watched on various video streaming services including NetFlix, Hulu, HBO, Amazon, etc., without a need to go to the individual websites. The best part of this website is that the collections offered by these video streaming services can be browsed in one single location. You can start using this website by selecting the services to which you’ve subscribed and then it will show you the movies and TV shows from the selected services. For each movie and TV show, it will display a short description of the movie, critics & audience ratings, time duration, genre, and the name of the video streaming services on which it is available. \nThe movies and TV shows will be listed in different categories like Popular, Top Drama, Comedy, Sci-Fi, and more. For each movie and TV show, it will display a short description of the movie, critics & audience ratings, time duration, genre, and the name of the video streaming services on which it is available. Additionally, it will also provide the options to play the movie or TV show on the supported service, watch trailers, add to watchlist, etc. \nSponsored Links \nSimilar to another website called “ flixfindr ” which lets you search for movies from the database of Hulu, NetFlix, etc., reelgood also lets you easily find movies (and TV shows) using the “Search” function. Using Reelgood to Browse Collections of NetFlix, Hulu, Amazon, and More in One Place: \nLet’s say, you’ve subscribed to multiple video streaming services (like NetFlix, Hulu, etc.) and want to know which movies and TV shows can be streamed on these services. Then the general solution for that will be to go through the services one by one and browse the collections. No doubt, it will be a difficult and time consuming task. But now you don’t need to do that anymore as this website allows you to browse the entire collection of movies and TV shows from different video streaming services (including Amazon, NetFlix, HBO, etc.) in one single platform. \nTo start using this website, you need to simply browse the homepage and then sign up for a new account. After that, it will ask you to select the services to which you’ve subscribed for streaming movies and TV shows. The supported services are NetFlix, Hulu, Amazon, HBO, Starz, FOXNow, and Showtime. \nOnce you do that, it will take your selection under consideration and display all the movies and TV shows supported by these services. At the top of the window, you’ll see three different tabs named, Movies, TV Shows, and Search which can help browse the collections with ease. The movies and TV shows will be categorized into Popular, Top Drama, Comedy, Documentaries, and more. \nWhen you click on any movie or TV show, it will display a short description, critics & audience ratings, time duration, genre, and the video streaming services on which you can stream it. Apart from that, you’ll also see the options to play the item on any of the supported services, watch the official trailer, add it to your watchlist, and mark it as seen. \nWhen you hit the “Play” button, it will redirect you to the video streaming service where you can watch it if you have a subscription to that service. My Final Verdict: \nThis website is very interesting and useful as it works as a common hub for different video streaming services including your favorite NetFlix, Amazon, Hulu, HBO, and more. Personally, I like this website as it can save an enormous amount of time from browsing the collection of movies and TV shows manually on individual video streaming service.

Flipboard Netflix \n2016 has been an amazing year for animation on TV, with shows new and old earning critical acclaim and high ratings all around the world. \nFrom returning TV favourites like Steven Universe, Adventure Time and Star Wars: Rebels to brand new and exciting ones like Son of Zorn, animation fans have been treated to some incredible variety throughout 2016. \nBut of all the animated series to come out this year, the best is one that nobody has really been talking about: Voltron: Legendary Defender. \nBased on the iconic Voltron series, the story follows a team of five young heroes as they must take the mantle of Paladins, operators of five giant mechanical lions when combined form the humanoid robot Voltron, created to defend the galaxy from the villainous Galra Empire and it's leader, the powerful Emperor Zarkon. \nIt's fantastic reboot of the classic 80s show, blending a surprisingly dramatic story, a variety of unique young heroes, beautiful animation, and a number of intense giant monster battles to name a few. If you love animation or are looking to add a new series to your list, this is recommended for anyone with a Netflix account.",

      "text": "Marvel/Facebook Like us on Facebook \nEvery month, Netflix adds to its already expansive library with even more content to help you avoid outdoor activities for a little while longer. And the service's December additions should keep you busy until the spring thaw. While dozens of new movies will be added over the next 31 days, here are five can't-miss titles worthy of your binging time. 1. BARRY (2016) \nBarry tells the story of a young Barack Obama (Devon Terrell) as he embarks upon his junior year at Columbia University in 1981. This Netflix original movie examines the future president as his views on race, class, and government begin to take shape both in the classroom and on the streets of New York City. 2. CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR (2016) \nCaptain America and Iron Man go head-to-head as the two Avengers battle over the responsibilities and morality of being a superhero. Featuring the Marvel debuts of Spider-Man and Black Panther, Civil War continues where 2015's Avengers: Age of Ultron left off, and sets the stage for the future of Marvel's cinematic universe. 3. BLUE JAY (2016) \nAlexandre Lehmann's Blue Jay —which was written by and stars Mark Duplass—isn't just benefiting from being on Netflix; the movie was actually financed by the streaming giant without them even seeing a script . The romantic drama focuses on two former high school sweethearts (Duplass and Sarah Paulson) who reconnect later in life in their hometown and reminisce about their time together. Don't let the film's black and white throw you off; Blue Jay has already impressed critics and film festival junkies. 4. NATIONAL LAMPOON'S ANIMAL HOUSE (1978) \nIf you're craving something a little more low-brow, Animal House is a classic of the gross-out comedy genre. Focusing on the beer-chugging shenanigans of the Delta Tau Chi fraternity, this movie laid the groundwork for countless college comedies that followed, including American Pie (1999), Old School (2003), and Neighbors (2014). 5. HONEY, I SHRUNK THE KIDS (1989) \nFor something a little more family-friendly, there's Honey, I Shrunk the Kids . This sci-fi comedy stars Rick Moranis as an inventor who accidentally shrinks his kids, who are then forced to survive in their backyard against mountainous ants and other dangers.

      "text": "Pinterest \nIt might have taken the company a while to finally deliver this particular feature to users but here it is: Netflix users can now download shows and movies from the service for offline viewing. Available through its Android and iOS apps from today onwards, the download feature can be utilized by users regardless of their Netflix subscription tiers. \nOn each downloadable show or movie, there is an icon that can be used to activate the download feature. They would then able to check the download status and access or delete the contents that they downloaded through the “ My Downloads ” section of the app. \nThe current list of downloadable contents seems to be quite substantial although it is mostly contained Netflix original productions such as Narcos, Stranger Things, Shooter, House of Cards, and others. Somehow, Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life (aha!) is not part of the list despite being Netflix’s own production. \nTo help users find these downloadable contents, Netflix has added a new category called “ Available For Download ” in both apps. However, the service didn’t mention the duration that users are able to keep the downloaded contents inside their device although one can choose to allow download to take place only through Wi-Fi connection. Windows 10 Now Supports Netflix 4K Contents: Only On Intel Kaby Lake Machines \nAll in all, the offline viewing function for Netflix should be useful for users that want to be entertained by the service while being on the go without taking the hit on their mobile data quota or during long travels where Internet connection might be scarce. \n(Source: Netflix ) 1 Chief Chapree \nSyefri “Chapree” Zulkefli is an industry mainstay that has made his bones in the eSports, gaming and tech community for almost a decade.",

      "text": "23 'Gilmore Girls' references you may have missed in the Netflix revival Tuesday Nov 29, 2016 at 11:33 AM Megan Willett, INSIDER - Business Insider \nWarning: Spoilers ahead for \"Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life.\" \nNetflix's revival of \"Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life\" is now officially streaming. \nThe show likely made many fans feel happy and nostalgic — those four last words aside — while also moving the characters forward in a satisfying way. \nThere were also plenty of references to the series that may have gone over your head unless you're a die-hard fan. Keep reading so you can go back and catch them all. Let’s start with a classic: \"I smell snow,\" Lorelai tells Rory in the town square. Netflix Fans of the original series know that Lorelai has a keen sense for smelling when snow is about to fall. Lorelai smelling the first snow of the year.Warner Bros. \nIn episode eight of the first season, Lorelai tells Rory how much she loves the snow and that she can smell when it's coming. \nShe also says every good thing that's ever happened to her — her first kiss, Rory's first steps, her best birthday — happened when it was snowing. Lorelai is worried that celebrity chef Roy Choi is going to burn down the Dragonfly Inn's kitchen. Netflix \nLorelai has an ever revolving door of chefs coming in and out as she tries to replace her beloved best friend and the inn's chef, Sookie (Melissa McCarthy), during the revival. In the original series, the inn where Lorelai, Michele, and Sookie worked did burn down. Warner Bros. \nWhile working at the Independence Inn, a faulty wire causes a fire to break out and the Inn got shut down. \nIt eventually spurs Lorelai and Sookie to open the Dragonfly Inn together. Emily's new maid Berta is actually played by a Stars Hollow favorite. Netflix That's right — Rose Abdoo, who plays Gypsy in the series, also plays Berta! Netflix \n\"Rose read it for fun in a table read because they hadn't cast it yet, and she was so hilarious they had to double her up,\" Lauren Graham (Lorelai) tweeted about the casting. Gypsy tells Lorelai to buy a new car after fixing her Jeep Wrangler in \"Spring.\" Netflix Everyone should know by now that Lorelai will never get a new car. Warner Bros. \nIn season seven, Lorelai tries to buy a new car, but discovers that she doesn't like any car but her beloved Jeep. \nThe frustrating process of trying to find a car she likes ends up fixing her friendship with Luke, who ends up convincing Gypsy to install a new engine into her old car. There are also a few Easter eggs from the show at Richard's funeral, including a record Rory gave him. Netflix During the first season, Lorelai isn't sure what to get her father. She asks Rory, who says she got him \"Chuck Berry: Live at the Fillmore.\" Netflix and Wikimedia Commons \nThat album is on a table at the funeral, a touching reminder of Rory's relationship with her grandfather. And this picture was from the wedding vow renewal episode, which was also the \"Gilmore Girls\" 100th episode. Netflix The episode was called \"Wedding Bell Blues\" and it was a huge hit with critics and a wonderful glimpse into Emily and Richard's marriage. Warner Bros When Emily is Kondo-ing her home, she tells Lorelai: \"I was married for 50 years, half of me is gone.\" Netflix This bit of dialogue is a touching tribute to actor Edward Hermann. Netflix \nEdward Hermann played Richard Gilmore, the patriarch of the Gilmore family for the series' run. Hermann died in 2014 before the revival could happen. \nThe 50 year mark coincides with when Hermann died in real life: Emily and Richard married in 1964 and Hermann passed away in 2014. In the revival, Richard died in 2016, which means he and Emily would actually have been married for about 52 years. \nHonoring his actual passing could be a subtle nod to the actor from showrunner and creator Amy Sherman-Palladino. The Town Troubadour chases a competing singer through Stars Hollow. Netflix \nHe's played by singer-songwriter Grant-Lee Phillips. It mirrors a plotline from season one when the Town Troubadour becomes the only Town Troubadour. Warner Bros. \nThe Town Troubadour faces off against a rival Troubadour in season one of the series. During a town meeting, the issue is brought up and eventually, it's decided that the original Town Troubadour will be the official Town Troubadour. \nIn season six, he's tapped to tour with Neil Young, prompting a flock of hopeful singers to turn up in Stars Hollow to try and get discovered themselves. Eventually, the Town Troubadour returns and reclaims his rightful post. We finally saw Lane's dad, Mr. Kim, after all these years. Netflix \nFans have wondered for years about Lane's dad — where was he and why did we never see him? \nThis seemed like a very bizarre throwaway moment in the revival, but at least we know he's alive and well. Lorelai has another dream about Paul Anka, the dog and the man. Netflix \nShe tells Rory it's the third one she's had this year. Season six is when Lorelai has her first dream about Paul Anka. Warner Bros. The Gilmore Guys were invited to be a part of the revival. Netflix and Gilmore Guys/Facebook \n\"Gilmore Guys\" is a popular podcast that takes a deep dive into each \"Gilmore Girls\" episode. The pair kept it a secret from fans until the trailer debuted. Richard's will sets money aside for Luke to franchise Luke's Diner. Netflix \nIn the revival, Emily convinces Luke to look at possible locations with her. This plot line also played out in season five. Richard makes the suggestion when he and Luke go golfing at his club. Warner Bros. \nLuke frantically calls Lorelai after he golfs with her father and tells her, \"Your father wants to open up a chain of Luke’s Diners, and I think I agreed to it.\" \n\"There’s going to be seven of them, and that’s just on the eastern seaboard. Then, I’m going national,\" he says. \"I’ve already got a marketing guy, Herb’s my banker, your father is taking care of all my insurance needs, and apparently, everyone is going to be able to buy stock!\" \nLorelai eventually calms Luke down and straightens everything out with her father, but it appears Richard never let the dream die. Lorelai uses \"alumnus\" wrong. Netflix \nWhen she talks to Rory while she's at her Chilton alumni event, she asks \"How's my little alumnus doing?\" \nBut she should know that's not the proper term by now. When Rory was still in high school, she taught her mom the difference between alumna, alumni, and alumnus. Warner Bros. \nRory is preparing to meet a Harvard alumnus, and Lorelai begins teasing her: LORELAI: So, alumna is a girl graduate. RORY: Right. LORELAI: And alumnus is a man. RORY: Singular. LORELAI: So an unmarried man? RORY: No, not not-married. He can be married or single, all alumnus means is one man singular as opposed to many men plural. LORELAI: And plural is alumni. RORY: Right, and that can be girls and guys. LORELAI: Kinky! RORY: No, not kinky, just what it is. \nIt appears she forgot this lesson. The Chilton bathroom scene in the revival is a direct callback to season three. Netflix \nIn this scene, Paris mentions Chilton's uniform hemlines, Rory and Francie teaming up, and student council, practically all in one breath. The Chilton bathroom in the original series is where Francie intimidated Rory and tried to get her to vote for higher hemlines. Warner Bros. \nWhile Rory serves as vice president on student council, the girls' bathroom at Chilton becomes a virtual war room as Francie tries to manipulate Rory to go against Paris's wishes and vote for higher hemlines. Rory eventually stands up to Francie in the same bathroom. \nSeeing all three characters together again in one place was quite fun for fans. Taylor Doose references the Lazy-Hazy-Crazy Days of Summer event in \"Summer.\" Netflix It's from the first episode of season three when Taylor hires a choir to sing \"Lazy-Hazy-Crazy Days of Summer\" on repeat. Warner Bros. \nThe whole town gets the song stuck in their heads and are miserable. \n\"Oh, hey, I figured how to get the 'Lazy-Hazy-Crazy Days of Summer' out of our heads — to sing the 'Small World' song over and over for the next 48 hours,\" Lorelai says. \"Of course, how we get the 'Small World' song out of our heads, I have not worked out yet.\" Carole King sings \"Feel The Earth Move Under My Feet\" and no one recognizes it. Netflix \nKing plays Sophie, the sister of the Town Troubadour who owns a music store in town. \nIn the revival, she reprises her role and volunteers an \"original song\" that she says she's been working on — \"Feel The Earth Move Under My Feet\" — for Taylor to use. The fact that no one recognizes the song is a cute nod to the \"Gilmore Girls\" theme song. Warner Bros. \n\"Where You Lead,\" the famous \"Gilmore Girls\" theme song, was written by King. It's implied in the revival that in the world of \"Gilmore Girls,\" Carole King and her music don't exist. \nTaylor deems Sophie's song \"Feel The Earth Move Under My Feet\" not catchy enough. Logan and his friends show up to Stars Hollow wearing gorilla masks. Netflix The scene was an homage to when Rory first entered Logan's circle after she sees a girl wearing a gorilla mask. Warner Bros. \nRory first finds out about the Life and Death Brigade — the secret society at Yale that Logan is a part of — when a girl wearing a gorilla mask wanders into her bathroom. \nShe decides to investigate for the Yale Daily News, and ends up getting closer to Logan in the process. When Rory goes into Richard's study, you can see her painting above his desk. Netflix Emily had the portrait done in season one. It was Lorelai who suggested Rory read a book while she's posing. Warner Bros. \nRichard loved the painting, and showing his study exactly as he left it was likely another nod to Edward Shermann, who played Richard. Of course Miss Celine helps dress Lorelai for her wedding. Netflix Miss Celine was famous for her taste in fashion — not to mention telling everyone what celebrity they look like. Warner Bros. \nShe was Emily's personal stylist on the series and decided Rory looked like Audrey Hepburn while Lorelai looked like Natalie Wood. When Emily repeatedly tells Lorelai \"You need money\" in \"Fall,\" it's a direct tie to the first episode of \"Gilmore Girls.\" Netflix \nIn the revival, Lorelai needs money to help expand the Dragonfly Inn. Emily agrees, on the condition that Lorelai and Luke visit her every year in Nantucket. Richard originally said \"You need money\" multiple times when Lorelai asks her parents for a loan for Rory's Chilton education. Warner Bros. \nThey decide that Lorelai and Rory will also visit every Friday night for dinner as a part of the arangement. It's the start of a very complicated relationship between the four of them. \nYou can read more about the scene here. Rory shows Dean corn starch before he leave's Doose's Market after they run into each other in \"Fall.\" Netflix Dean tells her to pay for it this time — it's a reference to their first kiss. Netflix \nRory pretended she was buying corn starch when she was really looking at Dean at Doose's Market. She ended up taking the corn starch home with her accidentally after they kissed. Sookie makes a bunch of wedding cakes for Lorelai, and one of them is covered in daisies. Netflix Daisies are Lorelai's favorite flower. Warner Bros. \nIn the first season finale of \"Gilmoe Girls,\" Lorelai tells her then-boyfriend Max (Scott Cohen) that a proposal should have, \"a thousand yellow daisies, and candles, and a horse.\" \nMax takes Lorelai at her word and proposes with a thousand yellow daisies. Though the pair never got married, it was one of the show's most romantic moments. While they're getting ready for the wedding in the revival, eagle-eyed fans can spot this picture of Rory's 16th birthday by Jess's elbow. Netflix It's a picture from season one when Lorelai throws Rory a birthday party in their home. It's a nice reference to how far the series has come. Warner Bros.

      "text": "Netflix Now Supports Offline Playback for Some Content Posted by Evan Selleck   \nWay back in June of this year, it was considered an “open secret” that, in some way or another, Netflix was preparing to launch offline playback for its content. \nEarlier this month another report cropped up that said Netflix was indeed considering offline options, but that it would probably only see the light of day outside the United States , in areas where connectivity to the Internet is not as readily available, or as fast. Well, that open secret is now officially official, as Netflix now supports offline playback — with Netflix version 9.0, which is said to be rolling out soon. \nThe offline playback option is available for any customer on any streaming plan, and it will work on iOS and Android. The streaming company made the announcement on its Twitter account recently, pointing out that offline playback means you can watch Netflix while in Airplane Mode, or just on a road trip and you don’t want to consume a ton of mobile data. Airplane mode. Road trip mode. Stuck-in-the-subway-for-20-minutes mode. Your favorite stories are now available for download any time. pic.twitter.com/g7QZA3TyE8 \n— Netflix US (@netflix) November 30, 2016 \nIt’s worth pointing out that Netflix plans on adding content available to download, but the selection is limited in scope at launch. Netflix’s own content, like original shows and movies, are included, but a lot of third-party content isn’t included. However, as Steve Kovach points out on Twitter , there is some third-party content available, including Office Space , Mad Men , and a few others. The availability will expand as time goes on. \nHow often do you use Netflix?",

      "text": "NEW YORK — It just got even easier to binge on Netflix.\nNetflix announced on Wednesday members now have the option to download movies and shows to watch offline later. This means you can finally watch Gilmore Girls and Stranger Things while on a flight or stuck in the subway.\nThe feature comes free of cost with all Netflix memberships.\nUp until now, you need a place with a reliable internet connection to access the streaming service. But Netflix wants to make its product more nimble to suit the lives of those on-the-go.\nThe company previously argued the feature was unnecessary, calling it a “short term fix for a bigger problem.” That problem, of course, being wireless internet availability.\nBut its competitor Amazon Prime embraced offline downloads for iOS and Android users more than a year ago.\nAccording to Netflix’s Help Center page, “you’ll want to delete” downloaded titles before attempting to download a new content.\nIt is unclear as of now if there’s a cap on how many shows or films people can download at once.\nNetflix said the feature is included in all plans and available for phones and tablets on Android and iOS. From the company’s announcement:\nTo start downloading today, please update your Netflix app to the most recent version and take us with you to enjoy Netflix everywhere you go. If you have any questions, please visit our Help Center. \nNetflix did not immediately respond to CNNMoney’s request for comment",

      "text": "streaming \nIt’s a feature that Netflix has been rumored to have both considered and discarded in recent times, but it seems that the video streaming service has finally decided to offer the ability to download content to watch at a later date. Being able to download content means that it’s going to be easier to watch your favorite Netflix shows, especially useful if you don’t have access to high-speed WiFi, or you don’t have network coverage while you are out and about. \nNetflix broke the news of its decision to greenlight offline playback via Twitter, along with a short video showing a selection of shows ranging from Narcos to Orange is the New Black , to Stranger Things and House of Cards to name just a few. It’s unknown whether Netflix’s entire catalog will be available to download for offline playback, but the company does state that it will add more titles over time. \nFor the moment at least, the ability to download content to view offline is restricted to phones and tablets of the Android and iOS variety, but it is available to all subscribers regardless of which plan you pay for. If you don’t see the option to download content on the Netflix app just yet, make sure your device is running the latest version. Airplane mode. Road trip mode. Stuck-in-the-subway-for-20-minutes mode. Your favorite stories are now available for download any time. pic.twitter.com/g7QZA3TyE8 \n— Netflix US (@netflix) November 30, 2016 \nIt may be unlikely, but if you don’t have Netflix installed on your Android phone or tablet, you can click the link below to get you started.

      "text": "Reddit \nAt long last, Netflix has launched a new download feature that allows for offline viewing. Whispers of such a feature have been making the rounds for quite some time, and when we last heard from Netflix , it sounded like an offline mode would only be made available to those living in regions with poor internet connectivity. It turns out that isn’t the case, with offline mode launching for all subscribers today. \nThe new feature doesn’t cost anything extra, but there are a few caveats to be aware of. Downloads are only available on mobile devices – meaning you can’t download a movie or TV show to your laptop or desktop for later viewing. This new functionality is going live today across iOS and Android, but you’ll need the most recent version of the Netflix app to partake. \nJust as well, not all of the content found on Netflix is eligible for download. Most of Netflix’s original series are – Stranger Things , House of Cards , and The Crown , for instance, can all be downloaded for later viewing. Other series like Daredevil and Luke Cage , though, aren’t eligible. A cursory look at other content shows that series like The Office , Weeds , Supergirl , and 30 Rock can all be downloaded. \nThis functionality doesn’t stop at TV series. There are at least a few movies available to download, including Kung Fu Panda 3 , No Country For Old Men , and Good Will Hunting . Essentially, you should be able to find something to download, even if Netflix’s entire library isn’t eligible yet. \nNetflix says that more titles will be added to its offline-compatible lineup as time goes on. Presumably, Netflix has to work out agreements with each content provider, so it could be a while before some of the larger companies like Disney sign on. To begin using Netflix’s offline mode, simply select a title within the Netflix app and (assuming it has one) hit the download button. From there, you’re set to watch some shows or movies regardless of your internet situation.",

Now that update is here, the company announced today . It’s a simple feature that’s available on Android and iOS phones and tablets. Just get on WiFi, press a button, and voilà, the content begins downloading. Here’s a handy graphic from Netflix, using The Crown as an example. \nThe offerings don’t just consist of original series, though many of those are featured. Users can also grab episodes of shows like 30 Rock or movies like Love Actually , the latter of which is perfect for the season. According to Netflix, other offerings are also “on the way.” The feature helps the streaming giant catch up to competitor Amazon Prime Video, which already offers something similar. \nSubmit your Newswire tips here",

      "text": "(Netflix Photo) Binging your favorite shows just got a lot easier.\nNetflix this morning announced the much-anticipated ability to download shows and movies for viewing offline. In a blog post Wednesday morning , the company said it has begun offering many titles for download and will add more soon. Right now, the downloadable catalog includes several Netflix original shows, as well as other popular series like The Office .\n“While many members enjoy watching Netflix at home, we’ve often heard they also want to continue their Stranger Things binge while on airplanes and other places where Internet is expensive or limited,” Eddy Wu, director of product innovation for Netflix, wrote in the blog post.\nThe new feature is available for all phones and tablets running iOS and Android through an update of the Netflix app, and downloading programs won’t cost users any extra.\nThe move brings Netflix on par with one of its chief competitors, Amazon Video . Amazon last year began letting members of the company’s Prime program download programs straight to their devices.\nThe competition between Netflix, the top dog in the streaming industry, and Amazon has been heating up recently. Amazon is preparing for a global expansion to rival Netflix’s worldwide footprint, which grew to 190 countries earlier this year . In the company’s quarterly letter to shareholders , Netflix acknowledged that Amazon is becoming a global force in the streaming market though research data shows Netflix is still way ahead .\nBoth streaming companies are spending big on programming as well. A recent study by IHS Markit on television production trends found that Amazon and Netflix both more than doubled spending on new shows in the last two years. Perhaps the biggest example of that is Amazon’s $250 million deal with Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May, formerly of Top Gear fame. Their new show, The Grand Tour , premiered earlier this month, and Amazon said the show broke viewership records for a premiere episode on Prime Video and led to the most new Prime membership sign-ups outside of Prime Day.",

      "text": "Netflix will now let you download videos and watch them offline Wednesday Nov 30, 2016 at 10:12 AM Steve Kovach - Business Insider \nNetflix announced Wednesday that it will let you download videos and watch them even if your device isn't connected to the internet. \nHowever, there appear to be some limitations. \nNot all videos will work with the new offline mode. Netflix hasn't released a full list of compatible shows, but it appears to mostly favor Netflix originals like \"Narcos\" and \"Stranger Things.\" It's unclear how many licensed titles from third parties will be available to download. \nAmazon Video, which offers thousands of free TV shows and movies for Prime members, lets you download just about any video for offline viewing. Netflix appears to be taking a more cautious approach to video downloads for now. \nThe \"Available for Download\" section on Netflix does include a variety of third-party shows and movies though, including \"Parks and Recreation,\" \"Mad Men,\" and a bunch of documentaries. Netflix said in a statement that \"many more\" titles are coming. \nScreenshot \nNetflix downloads work on iOS and Android devices. You'll need to update your Netflix app to the latest version, which launches Wednesday. A download button will appear next to the videos you can store for offline viewing. \nLike this: \nNetflix \nNetflix has historically been against allowing offline viewing, even as recently as the end of last year. But executives have loosened their opposition to video downloads this year, leading many to speculate it'd happen soon. Well, here it is, even if it's pretty limited for now. \nFindTheCompany | Graphiq",

      "text": "\nStarting today, Netflix users can now download their favorite movies and TV shows to watch offline. However, it appears that Netflix’s new offline mode does not come without limitations. While the streaming company has yet to release a full list of compatible shows and movies, not all programs will be available in offline mode.\nFinally! Netflix users will be able to watch movies and TV shows even if their device is not connected to the internet. Although, according to Business Insider, not all programs are available on the offline viewing service.\nNetflix tweeted the announcement this morning from their Twitter account.\nAirplane mode.

Your favorite stories are now available for download any time. pic.twitter.com/g7QZA3TyE8 \n— Netflix US (@netflix) November 30, 2016 \n\nNetflix has not released a full list of compatible shows yet, but it looks like fan favorite Netflix originals like Stranger Things and Narcos will definitely be available. It is unclear how many licenses titles from other parties will be available to download.\nUsers can count on Netflix originals like The Crown and Orange Is The New Black to be available but also movies like Boyhood, Pulp Fiction, Nightcrawler, Goodwill Hunting, and Hot Fuzz. \n. @Netflix Launches Downloads for Offline Viewing on Smartphones, Tablets https://t.co/9grzLNtEPV \n— Variety (@Variety) November 30, 2016 \n\nAmazon Video took the first initiative to allow viewers to watch their thousands of programs offline. Netflix appears to be taking a more cautious approach to offline downloading for now.\nOther streaming services like Epix and Starz also support offline viewing, so it was about time Netflix jumped on board.\nNetflix has said that they have been against allowing offline viewing as recently as the end of last year, but executives loosened their opposition this year, but obviously not without some limitation.\nBrunch in Stars Hollow.

Higher quality is a higher video resolution that requires more storage space and takes more time to download.”\nHowever, neither viewing options will be at the highest resolution available. This will be less of an issue for users watching on their phones, but if they are watching programs on a tablet, things may not look quite as sharp as usual.\nyou heard right. midnight PT tonight. #TheCrown @dogsofinstagram \nA photo posted by Netflix US (@netflix) on Nov 3, 2016 at 1:15pm PDT \n\nOffline playback for all streaming plans, so customers can rest assure that Netflix isn’t trying to up-sell people on higher subscription tiers.\nCurrently, Netflix downloads work with iOS and Android devices. In order for Netflix users to utilize the new offline viewing service, they will need to update their Netflix app to the latest version, which launched today.\nNetflix conveniently groups all of the offline content in a tab so you can see exactly what is available for download.\nSome licensed shows and movies are not available to watch offline on Netflix like BBC’s Sherlock, or Disney’s animated hit Zootopia. Surprisingly, even some Netflix originals like The Little Prince film cannot be downloaded.\nStarting today, Netflix now has an “Available for Download” section on the app which includes a variety of third-party shows and movies like Parks and Recreation and Mad Men. Netflix confirmed in a statement that there would be “many more” downloadable listings to come.\n[Featured Image by Alberto E.

      "text": "Netflix Inc. is making some TV shows and movies available for download to watch offline, providing its users a feature that has become a must-have for binge-watchers.\nMany fans have requested to watch Netflix content without an internet connection, especially those in emerging markets with limited internet access. The world's largest online TV network will roll out the feature on phones and tablets for all subscribers, but only for select shows such as \"The Crown\" and \"Orange is the New Black\" at first, according to a statement Wednesday.\nNetflix has been signaling it would add a downloading option in recent months, as a way to continue increasing its subscriber base and match video-streaming Amazon.com. Offline viewing will make Netflix shows more accessible to customers around the world, particularly in developing markets in Asia and Africa.\nNetflix has 86.7 million customers worldwide, 47.5 million of whom live in the U.S. The company now relies on international markets for most of its growth, and earlier this year expanded its footprint to the entire world, save for China, Syria, North Korea and Crimea.\n\"While many members enjoy watching Netflix at home, we've often heard they also want to continue their 'Stranger Things' binge while on airplanes and other places where internet is expensive or limited,\" said Eddy Wu, Netflix's director of product innovation, in a web post.\nPrivacy Policy ",

      "text": "Netflix Just Made It Way Easier To Stream Shows On the Go \nThe reason this has taken so long? Allowing downloads means securing a whole new set of rights from the people who made those TV shows and movies. That’s one reason Netflix has invested so heavily in creating original content; if it owns the rights to a show, it can distribute it anywhere in the world, and give users whatever viewing options it pleases. Netflix released roughly 600 hours of original content in 2016 alone; that’s 25 continuous days of viewing, and a strong foundation for its downloadable library. \nFortunately, Netflix has also gone way beyond its own in-house content for this new feature. Good Will Hunting , Mad Men , and Parks and Recreation are just a few examples of high-quality options. “Netflix is working with lots of partners globally to get downloading rights for the bulk of the content on our service,” Marlee Tart, a Netflix spokeswoman, wrote in an email to WIRED. “This is an ongoing effort as we know consumers want this capability and we are working to provide it.” \nThose ever-evolving negotiations mean that more movies and shows are on the way, but also that existing choices could disappear. For now, though, it’s clearly put in the work. “If they have the rights already, why not?” says Tony Gunnarsson, a TV and video analyst with market research firm Ovum. \nGunnarsson points out that offline downloads aren’t just about convenience. It’s also about Netflix being a truly global company. For its markets in the US and Europe, Gunnarsson points out, this is just a nice plus: hit download before your subway or plane ride. But in emerging markets, including some countries in Africa and Asia, some consumers just don’t have the kind of internet access that lets you get an uninterrupted stream. Mobile data itself can be quite costly as well. With offline downloads, these customers can just load up on shows whenever they have access to Wi-Fi. \nNetflix’s chief streaming rival, Amazon Video, has let its customers download shows for years—also at no extra cost. But Gunnarsson says the company may have not have made enough noise when it launched the feature. On Netflix’s part, timing may have played quite the factor in the company making its announcement now. Not only does this come right before the fourth quarter results in 2016, it’s ahead of Amazon’s own global video rollout. \nThat it’s available now also means you’ve got plenty of time to free up some space on your phone before the holidays. You’re going to need it; a full season of Narcos takes up 2.3GB all on its own. ",

      "text": "Wednesday, Nov 30, 2016 4:11 PM UTC Netflix now allows you to download movies offline Netflix unveils plan to let you take your binge with you when you go offline Topics: Netflix , technology , Business News , Politics News \nNetflix announced on Wednesday morning that they will now make it possible for viewers to watch their favorite shows even when they don’t have access to the Internet. \n“While many members enjoy watching Netflix at home, we’ve often heard they also want to continue their ‘Stranger Things’ binge while on airplanes and other places where Internet is expensive or limited,” wrote Eddy Wu, Director of Product Innovation, on the company’s website. “Just click the download button on the details page for a film or TV series and you can watch it later without an internet connection.” \nThis news follows rumors over the summer that offline viewing would be available to users by the end of the year. Thanks to Netflix’s new feature, users can click a “download” button next to episodes that they wish to watch on occasions when they won’t have access to the internet. Indeed, as Wu points out in his statement, this is already the case for many Netflix programs. \n“Many of your favorite streaming series and movies are already available for download, with more on the way, so there is plenty of content available for those times when you are offline,” Wu says. “For example, ‘Orange is The New Black’, ‘Narcos’ and ‘The Crown’ are available for download today.” \nIn order to determine which content is available to download using the Netflix app, simply tap the navigation menu in the top left corner and choose “Available for Download.” Matthew Rozsa is a Ph.D. student in history at Lehigh University and a political columnist.

      "text": "At Last, Netflix Will Let You Download Shows to Watch Offline \nHoliday travel just got way more bearable. Most Popular By Matt Miller Nov 30, 2016 The only thing worse than getting crammed in a tiny seat next to horrible strangers with terrible expensive food is sitting there with nothing to do but think about your awful existence for the next few hours. Flying is horrible—made even more horrible by being disconnected from the Internet. Who is going to pay $10 per hour if your flight offers wi-fi access? Yes, memes are awesome , but they're not that awesome. Music is fine, so is reading, but only for so long. At some point the monotony of sitting and thinking becomes so overwhelming there's nothing better to do than stand up and scream horrible political bullshit at everyone sitting in the general vicinity. Related Story best-tv-shows-series-2016   Netflix knows this. And Netflix knows the only cure for hours of idle time is hours of time spent staring at BoJack Horseman or Stranger Things or Orange Is the New Black or Luke Cage or, for anyone who's truly desperate, Fuller House . The streaming service has now unveiled a new feature that allows users to download series for offline use. According to a press release : \nJust click the download button on the details page for a film or TV series and you can watch it later without an internet connection... The new feature is included in all plans and available for phones and tablets on Android and iOS. Most Popular Orange Is the New Black , Narcos , and The Crown are available to download today with more content on the way, the press release says. Your trip home for the holidays just got slightly more bearable. Netflix",

      "text": "By Todd Spangler / Variety.com Today at 9:36 a.m. The Netflix sign-on page. REUTERS/Mike Blake/File Photo \nLOS ANGELES—Netflix has finally rolled out a feature subscribers have been requesting for years: The company will now let members worldwide download select TV shows and movies for viewing on Apple and Android devices while disconnected from the internet. \nThe latest versions of the company's mobile apps include a \"download\" button on the details page for a film or TV series—although not all titles on the streaming service are currently available to watch offline. The app also includes a \"find something to download\" feature. \nNetflix said it will add more series and movies to download in the future. Original series including \"Orange Is The New Black,\" \"Narcos,\" \"House of Cards,\" \"Stranger Things,\" \"Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,\" \"Master of None\" and \"The Crown\" are available for download starting Wednesday, Nov. 30. \n\"While many members enjoy watching Netflix at home, we've often heard they also want to continue their 'Stranger Things' binge while on airplanes and other places where internet is expensive or limited,\" Eddy Wu, Netflix's director of product innovation, wrote in a blog post announcing the feature. \nAmazon Prime Video has offered offline viewing to members on iOS and Android apps for more than a year, while YouTube Red subscribers also have access to videos in offline mode. \nNetflix's new download feature is included in all plans and available for Android and iOS phones and tablets. To download titles, users will need iOS 8.0 or later or Android 4.4.2 or later as well as the latest update of Netflix's app. \nNetflix execs had previously raised the prospect of allowing downloads for offline viewing, but they had suggested the company would first launch the feature in countries with constrained bandwidth infrastructure.",
