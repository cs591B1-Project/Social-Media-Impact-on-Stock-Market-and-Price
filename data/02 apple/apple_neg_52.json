      "title": "Re: Cortana for Android review",
      "text": "Microsoft \nDigital assistants are popping up all over the place, whether it be Google Now, Apple’s Siri, Hound by SoundHound, and now Microsoft’s Cortana. Google even recently made their own digital assistant even better with Android 6.0 Marshmallow. The search giant introduced Google Now On Tap, which makes the search giant’s digital assistant much more contextual and powerful. While this update might make Google Now stand out from the crowd, it’s much too dependent on what version of Android you’re on and what smartphone you have. \nGoogle Now is a victim of Android’s own fragmentation problem, making more independent options like Hound much more useful. Microsoft recently launched Cortana for Android, Redmond’s very own digital assistant, and the company believes that it might just have what it takes to compete with Google Now and make a name for itself in a not-so-useful market of digital assistants. \nHow does Cortana stack up against the rest? Find out below. Cortana is what a digital assistant should be \nJust like Hound–SoundHound’s digital assistant–Cortana is what a digital assistant should look like. It has much more usefulness and contextual ability than Siri, and unlike Google Now, it’s features aren’t dependent on what version of Android you have on your smartphone or tablet. That puts Microsoft’s digital assistant in a very good spot to be competitive and show device owners that these digital assistants can be good. \nCortana for Android let’s you access information quickly and easily, especially if you can’t have your hands on your device (e.g. when you’re driving). Cortana, with access to your personal data, is able to assist with calendar appointments, outgoing and incoming calls, text messages, and much more. Most digital assistants are able to do this, though Cortana makes it feel buttery smooth and very fleshed out. However, it’s biggest problem lies in trying to invade Google’s turf. \nUnlike Google Now, Cortana doesn’t integrate very well into Android, and that’s just because Microsoft and many other developers, don’t have access to the deep inner-workings of Android or Google. This is much of the reason as to why the “Hey Cortana” feature never worked well on Android, and has yet to be seen on iOS. The fight for your smartphone \n\nMicrosoft has made Cortana for Android a very good digital assistant, but it can’t properly compete on Android smartphones because Google Now can bring you relevant information based on all of the personal data it’s collected. Since Cortana for Android isn’t embedded in the system, it just can’t do that. \nWith access to all of that personal data, Google Now has grown up into a Jarvis-like digital assistant, predicting information that you might want to know, such as traffic updates for the commute to work and so on. Cortana for Android is a flawless digital assistant, and it can do all of the basic digital assistant tasks perfectly, but it’s still lacking because it doesn’t have access to this data. \nOver on Windows Phone and Windows 10, Cortana is flawless, but there are a few caveats (more on that later). As far as voice recognition goes, Cortana for Android does great in both quiet and noisy rooms, just like Google Now. It’s slick and fast, just like Google Now. It’s just missing that access to personal data that makes it relevant. You have to choose the light side or the dark side \nExcuse the Star Wars reference, but it’s true, and this is where those “caveats” come in. Cortana and Google Now boil down to one thing: you have to choose between the two. There is no double dipping with either service. You have to choose whether your personal data will go to Google or Microsoft. Will you use Microsoft’s services or Google’s services? Once you decide, you have to stick with it for either digital assistant to learn your personal habits. \nI’ve used Google Now and Cortana much more than I would have otherwise on a normal daily basis to truly put them to the test. They both offer the same thing, they’re both buttery smooth, and they just work. But they’re even better when you’re using Microsoft services for Cortana or Google services for Google Now. This allows them to give you access to contextual information that you want to hear about. \nYou truly have to choose whose services you’re going to be using for a digital assistant to be good , and that same rule applies to Cortana. Are digital assistants even useful? \nSo yes, while Cortana for Android is a good digital assistant, we must ask the question, are these digital assistant even useful? Well, the answer, for right now, is no. There’s a small crowd that regularly uses digital assistants, and then there’s the large majority that gets their information in traditional ways. And right now, that latter crowd is the dominant market. \nThere’s a market for digital assistants, but it’s slowly growing. Contextual information is the future, and that future isn’t here yet. But when it is, Cortana, Google Now, Siri, and all the rest will be there, ready to give you that information. \nI’d highly recommend giving Cortana for Android a try. It’s a smooth and fluid digital assistant, and it’s obvious a lot of work has gone into it. You might just find out that you like it better, especially if you take advantage of Microsoft’s services.

      "text": "Comment Apple is reportedly reducing orders for iPhone 7 amid the decrease of the phone's demand and shift of interest to the upcoming iPhone 8. via homethods.com \nAfter iPhone 7 was beaten by Google Pixel and Samsung Galaxy S7 during the Thanksgiving-Black Friday weekend sale, some reports say that the Android devices had better deals. Now, Apple is reported to be reducing its orders for the iPhone 7. But according to sources, it might be caused by the decrease in demand for the latest Apple flagship smartphone. \nSources from Taiwan's handset supply chain disclosed to DigiTimes that the tech giant has begun to reduce orders \"as initial sales momentum has started fading.\" Apparently, the clamor for the jet black variant of the iPhone 7 models has slowly died down. Though Apple benefitted from the Galaxy Note 7 disaster, affected consumers seemed to have moved on. \nFurthermore, there's also a decrease in demand in huge markets like China. The figure has significantly dropped down since the iPhone 7's launch months ago. It does not help that there have been alternative smartphone devices from Google, Huawei and Xiaomi that were recently released. Likewise, there have been more excitement and buzz surrounding the upcoming iPhone 8. \nThe interest of consumers have shifted to the next iPhone set to hit the market next year. This will somehow contribute to the expected decline in shipments of the iPhone 7. Supply chain makers estimates at least five million units less iPhone 7 shipped in the first half of 2017 compared to the second half of 2016. \nApple is not the only one experiencing a setback in its smartphone sales. The whole market has been suffering the same fate. Samsung had a chance to increase its total smartphone market share with the Galaxy Note 7. But it failed to do so because of the whole exploding phone fiasco. The Korean-based company should be thankful for its Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge for still putting up good numbers. Otherwise, they would have hit rock bottom. As for Apple, the iPhone 7 was not able to really do much to impact the sales of the US company. \nSince the hype is real for the iPhone 8, people have high expectations for the new Apple device. The company is rumored to integrate the phone with innovative features that can compete against its fierce competitions like the Samsung Galaxy S8. Most rumors mentioned that the tech company will finally introduce OLED display to iPhone users. This alone is a major difference from the previous iPhones that have been using LCD display. The said technology will also allow the iPhone 8 to have a curved screen like the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge or even be foldable. The latter one is based on the fact that Apple has patented a foldable electronic device . This news was released by the US Patent and Trademark Office. \nDigiTimes further reported that other market rumors regarding iPhone 8 include glass cases, dual-lens cameras, enhanced CPUs, advanced sensors, mixed reality support and wireless charging technology.

      "text": "Apple shows ambition to get into self-driving car race Updated: December 3, 2016 — 12:21 PM EST Share Reuters \nBy David Shepardson \nWASHINGTON, Dec 3 (Reuters) - Apple Inc is wading in to the debate over regulation of self-driving cars, declaring it is excited about the potential for automated transportation and calling on U.S. regulators not to restrict testing of such vehicles. \nA five-page letter from Steve Kenner, Apple's director of product integrity, to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is the company's most comprehensive statement yet about its interest in self-driving vehicle technology. The Nov. 22 letter followed more than a year of industry speculation about the computer and iPhone maker's plans for expanding into transportation. \n\"The company is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation,\" Kenner wrote. \n\"Executed properly under NHTSA's guidance, automated vehicles have the potential to greatly enhance the human experience - to prevent millions of car crashes and thousands of fatalities each year and to give mobility to those without.\" \nApple urged regulators not to impose too many restrictions on testing of self-driving cars, saying \"established manufacturers and new entrants should be treated equally.\" \nSince software would decide what actions to take in potentially dangerous situations, Apple said certain areas need special attention. These include the \"implications of algorithmic decisions\" for the safety, mobility and legality of automated vehicles and their occupants, ensuring privacy and security in design, and the impact of the cars on employment and public spaces. \nSome analysts forecast millions of jobs will be lost once self-driving cars largely replace truck, taxi and Uber drivers, and eliminate the need for most vehicle repairs, insurance adjusters and other functions. \nIn September, the Obama administration proposed guidelines for the development of self-driving cars in a 15-point \"safety assessment,\" calling on automakers to voluntarily submit details of their systems to regulators. \nApple executives have been coy about their interest in cars. Chief Executive Tim Cook has suggested that Apple wants to move beyond integration of Apple smartphones into vehicle infotainment systems. \nBut Apple has never confirmed reports last year that it was hiring automotive industry engineers and designers to develop a driverless electric car, or that those efforts have been sharply scaled back this year. \nOther companies pursuing self-driving cars include Alphabet Inc's Google unit, Ford Motor Co, Volkswagen AG , Daimler AG, Tesla Motors Inc and General Motors Co. \nApple has reportedly held talks about investing in British automaker McLaren Technology Group, but McLaren downplayed speculation that Apple had proposed an investment. \nApple joins a range of automakers and tech companies that have raised concerns about the proposed National Highway Traffic Safety Administration policy on self-driving cars, and plans by California state regulators to make complying with the safety assessment mandatory. \nAn auto trade group in November urged the incoming Trump administration to conduct a \"comprehensive regulatory review\" of all regulations and actions since Sept. 1, including the Obama administration's guidance on self-driving vehicles.

      "text": "Apple shows ambition to get into self-driving car race Updated: December 3, 2016 — 12:27 PM EST Share Reuters \nBy David Shepardson \nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Apple Inc is wading in to the debate over regulation of self-driving cars, declaring it is excited about the potential for automated transportation and calling on U.S. regulators not to restrict testing of such vehicles. \nA five-page letter from Steve Kenner, Apple's director of product integrity, to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is the company's most comprehensive statement yet about its interest in self-driving vehicle technology. The Nov. 22 letter followed more than a year of industry speculation about the computer and iPhone maker's plans for expanding into transportation. \n\"The company is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation,\" Kenner wrote. \n\"Executed properly under NHTSA's guidance, automated vehicles have the potential to greatly enhance the human experience — to prevent millions of car crashes and thousands of fatalities each year and to give mobility to those without.\" \nApple urged regulators not to impose too many restrictions on testing of self-driving cars, saying \"established manufacturers and new entrants should be treated equally.\" \nSince software would decide what actions to take in potentially dangerous situations, Apple said certain areas need special attention. These include the \"implications of algorithmic decisions\" for the safety, mobility and legality of automated vehicles and their occupants, ensuring privacy and security in design, and the impact of the cars on employment and public spaces. \nSome analysts forecast millions of jobs will be lost once self-driving cars largely replace truck, taxi and Uber drivers, and eliminate the need for most vehicle repairs, insurance adjusters and other functions. \nIn September, the Obama administration proposed guidelines for the development of self-driving cars in a 15-point \"safety assessment,\" calling on automakers to voluntarily submit details of their systems to regulators. \nApple executives have been coy about their interest in cars. Chief Executive Tim Cook has suggested that Apple wants to move beyond integration of Apple smartphones into vehicle infotainment systems. \nBut Apple has never confirmed reports last year that it was hiring automotive industry engineers and designers to develop a driverless electric car, or that those efforts have been sharply scaled back this year. \nOther companies pursuing self-driving cars include Alphabet Inc's Google unit, Ford Motor Co, Volkswagen AG, Daimler AG, Tesla Motors Inc and General Motors Co. \nApple has reportedly held talks about investing in British automaker McLaren Technology Group, but McLaren downplayed speculation that Apple had proposed an investment. \nApple joins a range of automakers and tech companies that have raised concerns about the proposed National Highway Traffic Safety Administration policy on self-driving cars, and plans by California state regulators to make complying with the safety assessment mandatory. \nAn auto trade group in November urged the incoming Trump administration to conduct a \"comprehensive regulatory review\" of all regulations and actions since Sept. 1, including the Obama administration's guidance on self-driving vehicles. \n(Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Richard Chang) Published: December 3, 2016 — 12:27 PM EST We encourage respectful comments but reserve the right to delete anything that doesn't contribute to an engaging dialogue Help us moderate this thread by flagging comments that violate our guidelines Commenting policy | Comments FAQ Comment policy: \nPhilly.com comments are intended to be civil, friendly conversations.

Chief Executive Tim Cook has suggested that Apple wants to move beyond integration of Apple smartphones into vehicle infotainment systems. \nBut Apple has never confirmed reports last year that it was hiring automotive industry engineers and designers to develop a driverless electric car, or that those efforts have been sharply scaled back this year. \nOther companies pursuing self-driving cars include Alphabet Inc's Google unit, Ford Motor Co, Volkswagen AG, Daimler AG, Tesla Motors Inc and General Motors Co. \nApple has reportedly held talks about investing in British automaker McLaren Technology Group, but McLaren downplayed speculation that Apple had proposed an investment. \nApple joins a range of automakers and tech companies that have raised concerns about the proposed National Highway Traffic Safety Administration policy on self-driving cars, and plans by California state regulators to make complying with the safety assessment mandatory. \nAn auto trade group in November urged the incoming Trump administration to conduct a \"comprehensive regulatory review\" of all regulations and actions since Sept. 1, including the Obama administration's guidance on self-driving vehicles. \n(Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Richard Chang) Next In Technology News ",

      "text": "December 3, 2016 AT 1:37 pm Some Praise for Apple’s New MacBook Pro – and Ultimately the USB-C Standard \nIn this Medium post praising the potential for USB-C on the new MacBook Pro, the author doesn’t fully address the ‘ ESC key’gate issue . But I will concur that I don’t fully understand the dongle drama. My 5-year-old ThinkPad W520 can connect up to 11 peripherals; instead I wind up using one USB cable to which everything else is attached to, so as there’s actually less clutter & wires immediately surrounding the laptop. Seems like the MacBook Pro will induce similar solutions. \nA million hot takes have been posted about how the late-2016 MacBook Pro with USB-C is the undeniable proof that Apple doesn’t care about developers anymore. They took away all the ports! No Esc key! It’s just a more expensive MacBook Air! \nBut in some ways, the new MacBook Pro is the most techy and expandable laptop Apple has ever made. They are trusting their pro users to wade into murky USB-C waters in search of the holy grail of a universal, open standard for moving data and power between devices. \nI’m not here to change your mind about the MacBook Pro. Yes, it’s probably too expensive and more RAM is better than less RAM. But everyone posting complaints without actually using a MBP for a few weeks is missing out on all the clever things you can do because it is built on USB-C. Over the past week or two with a new MacBook Pro (15in, 2.9ghz, TouchBar), I’ve been constantly surprised with how USB-C makes new things possible. It’s a kind of a hacker’s dream.",

      "text": "View photos\nThe logo of Apple is seen at a store in Zurich, Switzerland November 22, 2016. REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann More By David Shepardson\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Apple Inc is wading in to the debate over regulation of self-driving cars, declaring it is excited about the potential for automated transportation and calling on U.S. regulators not to restrict testing of such vehicles.\nA five-page letter from Steve Kenner, Apple's director of product integrity, to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is the company's most comprehensive statement yet about its interest in self-driving vehicle technology. The Nov. 22 letter followed more than a year of industry speculation about the computer and iPhone maker's plans for expanding into transportation.\n\"The company is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation,\" Kenner wrote.\n\"Executed properly under NHTSA's guidance, automated vehicles have the potential to greatly enhance the human experience — to prevent millions of car crashes and thousands of fatalities each year and to give mobility to those without.\"\nApple urged regulators not to impose too many restrictions on testing of self-driving cars, saying \"established manufacturers and new entrants should be treated equally.\"\nSince software would decide what actions to take in potentially dangerous situations, Apple said certain areas need special attention. These include the \"implications of algorithmic decisions\" for the safety, mobility and legality of automated vehicles and their occupants, ensuring privacy and security in design, and the impact of the cars on employment and public spaces.\nSome analysts forecast millions of jobs will be lost once self-driving cars largely replace truck, taxi and Uber drivers, and eliminate the need for most vehicle repairs, insurance adjusters and other functions.\nIn September, the Obama administration proposed guidelines for the development of self-driving cars in a 15-point \"safety assessment,\" calling on automakers to voluntarily submit details of their systems to regulators.\nApple executives have been coy about their interest in cars. Chief Executive Tim Cook has suggested that Apple wants to move beyond integration of Apple smartphones into vehicle infotainment systems.\nBut Apple has never confirmed reports last year that it was hiring automotive industry engineers and designers to develop a driverless electric car, or that those efforts have been sharply scaled back this year.\nOther companies pursuing self-driving cars include Alphabet Inc's Google unit, Ford Motor Co, Volkswagen AG, Daimler AG, Tesla Motors Inc and General Motors Co.\nApple has reportedly held talks about investing in British automaker McLaren Technology Group, but McLaren downplayed speculation that Apple had proposed an investment.\nApple joins a range of automakers and tech companies that have raised concerns about the proposed National Highway Traffic Safety Administration policy on self-driving cars, and plans by California state regulators to make complying with the safety assessment mandatory.\nAn auto trade group in November urged the incoming Trump administration to conduct a \"comprehensive regulatory review\" of all regulations and actions since Sept. 1, including the Obama administration's guidance on self-driving vehicles.\n(Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Richard Chang)",

      "text": "Subscribe on YouTube\nWith the holiday season in full swing, some “shoppers” are ensuring they’ll be placed on the naughty list by not paying for their merchandise at various San Francisco area Apple stores. A group of three to four thieves have been helping themselves to pricey Apple merchandise while hapless store staff and customers looked on.\nThe first of the recent thefts happened at 5:40 p.m. on Black Friday at the downtown San Francisco store on Chestnut street. Three men burst into the store, grabbed what they could — mostly iPhones — scooping them up in their hands amid stunned onlookers.\nMore: Keep your Mac secure! Lock it down when you’re away\nFour days later on November 29, four hoodie-clad bandits entered the store and grabbed devices with just one customer and two sales associates at the front of the store. Both robberies took under 12 seconds each to complete. These aren’t the only area thefts, however. According to Siliconbeat via KTVU, a group of 6 to 10 young men took about 45 seconds to steal iPads and iPhones — valued at $20,000 — from the Apple store in nearby Burlingame last Wednesday. It was the third robbery in the last month at that store.\nThere have been 11 crimes of this nature in the Bay Area since late October. The Stockton Street San Francisco store was hit on the 29th, plus 3 in Berkeley in one week, two more in Burlingame, one in Los Gatos, and a Black Friday robbery in Corte Madera. The Corte Madera incident cost the store $35,000 to $40,000 worth of iPhones and other gear, according to the Marin Independant Journal .\nA woman told Berkeleyside that the robbers wore ski masks. “I felt like I was in a ninja movie. It was so stealthy and so well planned. I love the Berkeley store but after this experience I may have to go somewhere else unless they do something about this. It was scary.”\nIt also concerned her that after it was all over, it seemed like “no big deal” to the store staff. “No manager came out, if they have a manager. Nobody reassured people in the store. Everybody just went back to whatever they were doing. It was the strangest thing. No manager made an announcement, ‘We’re sorry that this happened.’”\nSilconbeat also reports that on the website Nextdoor , a woman says she spoke to a Berkeley Apple store employee, who was quite rattled. “He said he feels his life may be in danger because he is working in this store. After revealing what had gone on, he abruptly backed off and apologized profusely saying that he should not shared so much info with me and that Apple had instructed that he not share it.”\nKTVU reports that a uniformed police officer is now stationed at the Berkeley store seven days a week, and Burlingame police were going to meet with Apple to discuss the company paying for an officer to be stationed in the store.\nU.K. police ‘mug’ fraud suspect to access his iPhone while it’s unlocked NYC district attorney says smartphones should be ‘answerable to search warrants’ We took the Google Pixel and iPhone 7 Plus to France for an epic camera shootout",

      "text": "Via Flickr/Andy Ihnatko \nIn the past, Apple has had some trouble wrapping their heads around the idea of a self-driving car. Despite their stumbles, the company is still confident it can get into the automated transportation business.\nApple has always been at the forefront of technology design, with people lining up for days for their products. But one nut they haven’t been able to crack yet is the self-driving car, although it isn’t like they haven’t tried. In September, it laid off dozens of employees who were a part of its self-driving car division, as it was looking to change directions. But it then purchased McLaren later that month, leading some to believe the iCar would end up a reality. And the company has been dropping clues about the direction they are thinking of taking.\nIn a letter from Steve Kenner, Apple’s director of product integrity, to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the company said it is all for getting into the automotive business and is excited to get started :\n“The company is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation. Executed properly under NHTSA’s guidance, automated vehicles have the potential to greatly enhance the human experience — to prevent millions of car crashes and thousands of fatalities each year and to give mobility to those without.”\nBut like it has done in the past, Apple noted how a self-driving car could take some time to roll out. Reuters reported the company would need to take extra precaution with safety abilities :\nSince software would decide what actions to take in potentially dangerous situations, Apple said certain areas need special attention. These include the “implications of algorithmic decisions” for the safety, mobility and legality of automated vehicles and their occupants, ensuring privacy and security in design, and the impact of the cars on employment and public spaces.\nBut the self-driving car may not come to the fruition for awhile, as Reuters reported Apple and other companies are still hoping for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration reviews its safety assessment further.\n(Via Reuters )\n",

      "text": "Reddit \nApple’s car plans have long been kept under wrap by the company itself, but a new regulatory filing shows it publicly address the industry for the time. In a letter to the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) uncovered by VentureBeat , Apple urges the government not to restrict testing of self-driving vehicles… \nIn the letter, written by Apple’s director of product integrity Steve Kenner, the company comments on the recently announced plan from the U.S. Department of Transportation to ensure that there’s a safe deployment of ” highly automated vehicles.” \nIn the letter, Apple explains that it uses machine learning in a variety of different aspects, including with transportation technology. \nApple uses machine learning to make its products and services smarter, more intuitive, and more personal. The company is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation. \nApple goes on to address the safety aspect of autonomous vehicles, writing that both established manufacturers and “new entrants” should be treated equally as to maximize the safety benefits of the technology. The implication here is that Apple, who is new to the car industry, shouldn’t see its testing or timeline affected because it’s not an automaker, but rather it should be treated the same as a manufacturer like Ford. \nWhile the letter is rather ambiguous, Apple issued a separate statement to the Financial Times that’s rather direct. In the statement, an Apple spokesperson explains that the letter was a way for the company to ensure that the NHTSA is defining the best practices for the “machine learning and autonomous systems.” \n“We’ve provided comments to NHTSA because Apple is investing heavily in machine learning and autonomous systems,” the Apple spokesman said. “There are many potential applications for these technologies, including the future of transportation, so we want to work with NHTSA to help define the best practices for the industry.” \nThe timeline of Apple’s car efforts is convoluted at best, with even some recent reports going as far to say that Apple has halted development of an actual car . In halting the development of an actual, Apple was to be reallocating those resources to focus on a self-driving platform, much like it indicates in the letter to the NHTSA. \nA recent investor note from KGI also commented on Apple’s ambitions for the car industry , explaining that Apple will get a 3-5 year lead in the augmented reality industry and will use that technology as part of an autonomous driving system. \nWhile Apple’s letter to the NHTSA and subsequent statements to the press don’t offer up too much detail, they’re both more confirmation of what has been speculated for a while now concerning Apple and the car. \nMost other players in the field are aiming to release their self-driving platforms around 2020-2021. Tesla is among a few companies pushing for a more aggressive timeline. The company equipped all its new vehicles with self-driving hardware starting last month and it aims to have the software ready by the end of next year . \nAll those efforts are contingent to regulators approving the technology for commercial use beyond testing and this appears to be Apple’s first official dialogue with regulators.

      "text": "Apple reveals autonomous vehicle ambitions in letter to US regulators Posted \nWall Street Journal first broke news of the communique. \nPrecise details of Apple automotive products were not revealed in the letter. But it did state that: \n“Apple uses machine learning to make its products and services smarter, more intuitive, and more personal. The company is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation.” \nWritten by Apple Director of Product Integrity Steve Kenner, the letter calls for policies that will bring about: a clear understanding of who is liable for problems that occur when cars drive themselves; the maintenance of users’ privacy, cybersecurity and physical safety; and ensuring that the impact of self-driving cars on the public is as positive as can be. \nThe impact of any new regulation on a burgeoning industry could be chilling or make room for new brands, jobs and technological breakthroughs, of course. \nApple strongly calls for policies that treat newcomers in the automotive industry the same as incumbent leaders. A new automaker should not have to disclose more information about their autonomous vehicles, the letter suggests, before they test them on public roads in a safe and controlled manner. \nThis recommendation has the internet abuzz with the idea that Apple will make its own brand of self-driving cars, after all, not just the software or operating systems within them. \nThe letter also admonishes NHTSA to form policies that will protect drivers’ individual privacy. \nKenner writes: “Apple agrees that companies should share de-identified scenario and dynamics data from crashes and near-misses…By sharing data, the industry will build a more comprehensive dataset than any one company could create alone… [But] Data sharing should not come at the cost of privacy. Apple believes that companies should invest the resources necessary to protect individuals’ fundamental right to privacy.” \nRumors of an Apple car have long been swirling online, and were renewed when the company reportedly enlisted Bob Mansfield to head its auto division. Mansfield was formerly the leader of engineering teams behind products like the MacBook Air and iPad. \nFollowing his appointment though, the Cupertino tech juggernaut reorganized its teams to focus on developing the “brains” within an autonomous vehicle, reportedly. \nIf Apple stays true to its winning playbook of owning both the hardware and the software within to make its entrance in transportation, we will one day see a self-driving car in its name.",

      "title": "Apple's iCloud Activation Lock can be bypassed, blogger finds",
      "text": "Apple's iCloud Activation Lock, designed to disable stolen iOS devices, can be bypassed by fiddling with the login screen and iPad smart cover, potentially letting thieves wipe the devices and resell them.\nIn a report published this week, a security blogger identified a creative way to disable Activation Lock. Hemanth Joseph, a self-described \"cyber security enthusiast\" from India, uploaded a YouTube video in which he floods an iPad's Wi-Fi network login screen with character inputs and then opens and closes its Smart Cover.\n  \nDoing so takes advantage of a loophole in Apple's Wi-Fi login system: its password field apparently has no character limit, so entering an extremely long password will cause it to crash, after which opening and closing the iPad's smart cover will cause it to display the home screen. From there, a thief could restore the device as new and sell it online.\nThe Activation Lock was introduced in iOS 7. When it's working properly, it requires an Apple ID and password to reactivate an iOS device if its owner loses it and remotely wipes it using the Find My iPhone feature.\nIn a blog post, Joseph wrote that he shared his findings with Apple on Nov. 4, and the company responded a few days later that it was investigating the issue. An Apple representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment about its plans to fix the vulnerability.\nThe Activation Lock feature has been a hacking target before. In 2014, two hackers released a tool that allowed users to plug a bricked iOS device into their computer and alter the \"hosts\" file inside. The iPhone or iPad was then tricked into connecting to a hacked server, which unlocked the gadget.\nThis article originally appeared on PCMag.com.\nGet the Biz Briefing newsletter!

      "text": "99 percent of fake Apple chargers unsafe, study finds The Republic | azcentral.com 6 p.m. MST December 2, 2016 In this file photo, a customer looks at the screen size on the new iPhone 6 Plus. Apple said in a court filing most Apple-labeled products on Amazon are fakes. (Photo: Rogelio V. Solis, AP) \nA watchdog group in the U.K. is warning of the dangers posed by fake Apple chargers, after an analysis showed that nearly all knockoffs it tested failed to meet basic safety standards. \nInvestigators with the Consumer Protection Partnership purchased 400 \"counterfeit\" Apple chargers from online merchants around the world, including in the U.S. Of those, 397 — more than 99 percent — were found to be unsafe. \nIn the tests, high voltages were sent through the chargers to see if they had enough isolation to protect against shock. \nLeon Livermore, CEO of the U.K.'s Chartered Trading Standards Institute, said consumers should buy electronics such as Apple chargers only from trusted suppliers. \n“It might cost a few (bucks) more but counterfeit and second-hand goods are an unknown entity that could cost you your home or even your life, or the life of a loved-one,\" he said. \nMeanwhile, Apple in October sued a U.S. vendor that it claims sold counterfeit chargers on Amazon’s e-commerce website . \nThe company alleges that almost 90 percent of all supposed Apple adapters and chargers sold on Amazon are counterfeit. Ken Colburn: Comparing new Google Pixel vs. iPhone 7 How to spot a potentially dangerous charger \nThe wall plug : It should slide easily into an outlet. If any dimensions, such as the distance between pins, are off, the user could be shocked when plugging or unplugging the device, according to Chartered Trading Standards Institute. Less critically, the outlet and charger could be damaged. \nMarkings : Look for a manufacturer’s brand name or logo, model and batch number. Check for a \"CE\" mark, which indicates compliance with safety standards, the institute says. \nCheck that the output voltage and current ratings marked on the charger and your electrical device are the same. \nWarnings and instructions : Adequate warnings and instructions must be provided with the product. As a minimum, user instructions should provide info on how to operate the charger safely and how to safely dispose of it when it is no longer needed.",

      "text": "\nPhoto via jasonr611/Flickr (CC-BY) Apple is looking at the future of transportation. \nThe self-driving car discussion has been led by Tesla in the last several years, but there are always whisperings about whether Apple is also working on its brand of automated transportation. \nLess than two months ago, it seemed Apple’s potential self-driving program was in trouble . But the Verge obtained a Nov. 22 letter from Apple to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in which the tech company writes it is “investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation.” \nThat doesn’t necessarily mean Apple is, at this very moment, working on the production of self-driving cars. But it does speak to the company’s realization that the automation is in its future, particularly since it’s asking the highway traffic safety administration to promote fair competition between traditional auto-makers and newcomers into the industry. \nInstead of competing directly against Tesla in the automated car market, Apple could choose to develop the software for such a vehicle and then partner with an existing auto company to produce it. Previously, Apple had been rumored to be talking with British car manufacturer McLaren, though McLaren denied that. \nBut the rumors of Apple getting into the self-driving car game certainly have been more solidified by this letter. \n“We’ve provided comments to NHTSA because Apple is investing heavily in machine learning and autonomous systems,” an Apple spokesman told the Financial Times . “There are many potential applications for these technologies, including the future of transportation, so we want to work with NHTSA to help define the best practices for the industry.” ",

      "text": "  5:23pm GMT Apple shows ambition to get into self-driving car race The logo of Apple is seen at a store in Zurich, Switzerland November 22, 2016. REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann By David Shepardson | WASHINGTON \nWASHINGTON Apple Inc ( AAPL.O ) is wading in to the debate over regulation of self-driving cars, declaring it is excited about the potential for automated transportation and calling on U.S. regulators not to restrict testing of such vehicles. \nA five-page letter from Steve Kenner, Apple's director of product integrity, to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is the company's most comprehensive statement yet about its interest in self-driving vehicle technology. The Nov. 22 letter followed more than a year of industry speculation about the computer and iPhone maker's plans for expanding into transportation. \n\"The company is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation,\" Kenner wrote. \n\"Executed properly under NHTSA's guidance, automated vehicles have the potential to greatly enhance the human experience — to prevent millions of car crashes and thousands of fatalities each year and to give mobility to those without.\" \nApple urged regulators not to impose too many restrictions on testing of self-driving cars, saying \"established manufacturers and new entrants should be treated equally.\" \nSince software would decide what actions to take in potentially dangerous situations, Apple said certain areas need special attention. These include the \"implications of algorithmic decisions\" for the safety, mobility and legality of automated vehicles and their occupants, ensuring privacy and security in design, and the impact of the cars on employment and public spaces. \nSome analysts forecast millions of jobs will be lost once self-driving cars largely replace truck, taxi and Uber drivers, and eliminate the need for most vehicle repairs, insurance adjusters and other functions. \nIn September, the Obama administration proposed guidelines for the development of self-driving cars in a 15-point \"safety assessment,\" calling on automakers to voluntarily submit details of their systems to regulators. \nApple executives have been coy about their interest in cars. Chief Executive Tim Cook has suggested that Apple wants to move beyond integration of Apple smartphones into vehicle infotainment systems. \nBut Apple has never confirmed reports last year that it was hiring automotive industry engineers and designers to develop a driverless electric car, or that those efforts have been sharply scaled back this year. \nOther companies pursuing self-driving cars include Alphabet Inc's Google unit ( GOOGL.O ), Ford Motor Co ( F.N ), Volkswagen AG ( VOWG_p.DE ), Daimler AG ( DAIGn.DE ), Tesla Motors Inc ( TSLA.O ) and General Motors Co ( GM.N ). \nApple has reportedly held talks about investing in British automaker McLaren Technology Group, but McLaren downplayed speculation that Apple had proposed an investment. \nApple joins a range of automakers and tech companies that have raised concerns about the proposed National Highway Traffic Safety Administration policy on self-driving cars, and plans by California state regulators to make complying with the safety assessment mandatory. \nAn auto trade group in November urged the incoming Trump administration to conduct a \"comprehensive regulatory review\" of all regulations and actions since Sept. 1, including the Obama administration's guidance on self-driving vehicles. \n(Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Richard Chang)  ",

      "text": "  An Apple logo hangs above the entrance to the Apple store on 5th Avenue in the Manhattan borough of New …\nBy David Shepardson\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) is wading in to the debate over regulation of self-driving cars, declaring it is excited about the potential for automated transportation and calling on U.S. regulators not to restrict testing of such vehicles.\nA five-page letter from Steve Kenner, Apple's director of product integrity, to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is the company's most comprehensive statement yet about its interest in self-driving vehicle technology. The Nov. 22 letter followed more than a year of industry speculation about the computer and iPhone maker's plans for expanding into transportation.\n\"The company is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation,\" Kenner wrote.\n\"Executed properly under NHTSA's guidance, automated vehicles have the potential to greatly enhance the human experience — to prevent millions of car crashes and thousands of fatalities each year and to give mobility to those without.\"\nApple urged regulators not to impose too many restrictions on testing of self-driving cars, saying \"established manufacturers and new entrants should be treated equally.\"\nSince software would decide what actions to take in potentially dangerous situations, Apple said certain areas need special attention. These include the implications of algorithmic decisions for the safety, mobility and legality of automated vehicles and their occupants, ensuring privacy and security in design, and the impact of the cars on employment and public spaces.\nSome analysts forecast millions of jobs will be lost once self-driving cars largely replace truck, taxi and Uber drivers, and eliminate the need for most vehicle repairs, insurance adjusters and other functions.\nApple's letter was prompted by its heavy investment in machine learning and autonomous systems, company spokesman Tom Neumayr said in an emailed statement.\n\"There are many potential applications for these technologies, including the future of transportation, so we want to work with NHTSA to help define the best practices for the industry,\" he said.\nIn September, the Obama administration proposed guidelines for the development of self-driving cars in a 15-point \"safety assessment,\" calling on automakers to voluntarily submit details of their systems to regulators.\nApple executives have been coy about their interest in cars. Chief Executive Tim Cook has suggested that Apple wants to move beyond integration of Apple smartphones into vehicle infotainment systems.\nBut Apple has never confirmed reports last year that it was hiring automotive industry engineers and designers to develop a driverless electric car, or that those efforts have been sharply scaled back this year.\nOther companies pursuing self-driving cars include Alphabet Inc's Google unit (GOOGL.O), Ford Motor Co (F.N), Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE), Daimler AG (DAIGn.DE), Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA.O) and General Motors Co (GM.N).\nApple has reportedly held talks about investing in British automaker McLaren Technology Group, but McLaren downplayed speculation that Apple had proposed an investment.\nApple joins a range of automakers and tech companies that have raised concerns about the proposed National Highway Traffic Safety Administration policy on self-driving cars, and plans by California state regulators to make complying with the safety assessment mandatory.\nAn auto trade group in November urged the incoming Trump administration to conduct a \"comprehensive regulatory review\" of all regulations and actions since Sept. 1, including the Obama administration's guidance on self-driving vehicles.\n\n(Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Richard Chang)",

      "text": "Market News | Sat Dec 3, 2016 | 12:21pm EST Apple shows ambition to get into self-driving car race By David Shepardson | WASHINGTON \nWASHINGTON Dec 3 Apple Inc is wading in to the debate over regulation of self-driving cars, declaring it is excited about the potential for automated transportation and calling on U.S. regulators not to restrict testing of such vehicles. \nA five-page letter from Steve Kenner, Apple's director of product integrity, to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is the company's most comprehensive statement yet about its interest in self-driving vehicle technology. The Nov. 22 letter followed more than a year of industry speculation about the computer and iPhone maker's plans for expanding into transportation. \n\"The company is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation,\" Kenner wrote. \n\"Executed properly under NHTSA's guidance, automated vehicles have the potential to greatly enhance the human experience - to prevent millions of car crashes and thousands of fatalities each year and to give mobility to those without.\" \nApple urged regulators not to impose too many restrictions on testing of self-driving cars, saying \"established manufacturers and new entrants should be treated equally.\" \nSince software would decide what actions to take in potentially dangerous situations, Apple said certain areas need special attention. These include the \"implications of algorithmic decisions\" for the safety, mobility and legality of automated vehicles and their occupants, ensuring privacy and security in design, and the impact of the cars on employment and public spaces. \nSome analysts forecast millions of jobs will be lost once self-driving cars largely replace truck, taxi and Uber drivers, and eliminate the need for most vehicle repairs, insurance adjusters and other functions. \nIn September, the Obama administration proposed guidelines for the development of self-driving cars in a 15-point \"safety assessment,\" calling on automakers to voluntarily submit details of their systems to regulators. \nApple executives have been coy about their interest in cars. Chief Executive Tim Cook has suggested that Apple wants to move beyond integration of Apple smartphones into vehicle infotainment systems. \nBut Apple has never confirmed reports last year that it was hiring automotive industry engineers and designers to develop a driverless electric car, or that those efforts have been sharply scaled back this year. \nOther companies pursuing self-driving cars include Alphabet Inc's Google unit, Ford Motor Co, Volkswagen AG , Daimler AG, Tesla Motors Inc and General Motors Co. \nApple has reportedly held talks about investing in British automaker McLaren Technology Group, but McLaren downplayed speculation that Apple had proposed an investment. \nApple joins a range of automakers and tech companies that have raised concerns about the proposed National Highway Traffic Safety Administration policy on self-driving cars, and plans by California state regulators to make complying with the safety assessment mandatory. \nAn auto trade group in November urged the incoming Trump administration to conduct a \"comprehensive regulatory review\" of all regulations and actions since Sept. 1, including the Obama administration's guidance on self-driving vehicles.

      "text": "Some made fun of Apple's attempt at self reflection with its debut of the Apple Book , a minimalist photo book showing off the company's product design history. The punch line? The paper book about Apple's often expensive products costs $300.\nDespite the $300 price tag for what amounts to a catalog, some Apple fans rushed to snag the book. One in particular (see video below) had the predictable yet brilliant idea of showing off many of the real life products next to the images of the products in the book.\nSEE ALSO: Stephen Colbert gives the Apple Book the spoof it deserves\nIf you have even a glimmer of an Apple fan in you, you'll watch the entire video. And it's a great video, worthy of Apple's tradition of marketing-driven aspirational warmth meets cold design precision. It even takes a shot at the \"trashcan\" Mac Pro , delivering some authentic Mac fan pride via video editorializing.\nBut then, after about a minute, you realize that the YouTuber, Stephen Hackett , just saved you $300. This is the perfect Apple Book video. But it's the worst argument for parting with your cash for the print product.\nSomehow, seeing all those now obsolete, scuffed and mostly out of date Apple products next to the pages breaks the magic spell of design glory promised within the book's pages.\nYes, Apple remains at the top in terms of design in tech. Even a pretentious, overpriced book can't change that. But for any Apple fan still considering buying this book, this is the video that will probably lead you to spend your cash on all the dongles you'll need in coming months instead.\nBONUS: Everything you need to know about Apple's new Macbook Pro",

The Nov. 22 letter followed more than a year of industry speculation about the computer and iPhone maker's plans for expanding into transportation. \n\"The company is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation,\" Kenner wrote. \n\"Executed properly under NHTSA's guidance, automated vehicles have the potential to greatly enhance the human experience — to prevent millions of car crashes and thousands of fatalities each year and to give mobility to those without.\" \nApple urged regulators not to impose too many restrictions on testing of self-driving cars, saying \"established manufacturers and new entrants should be treated equally.\" \nSince software would decide what actions to take in potentially dangerous situations, Apple said certain areas need special attention. These include the implications of algorithmic decisions for the safety, mobility and legality of automated vehicles and their occupants, ensuring privacy and security in design, and the impact of the cars on employment and public spaces. \nSome analysts forecast millions of jobs will be lost once self-driving cars largely replace the truck, taxi and Uber drivers, and eliminate the need for most vehicle repairs, insurance adjusters and other functions. \nApple's letter was prompted by its heavy investment in machine learning and autonomous systems, company spokesman Tom Neumayr said in an emailed statement. \n\"There are many potential applications for these technologies, including the future of transportation, so we want to work with NHTSA to help define the best practices for the industry,\" he said. \nIn September, the Obama administration proposed guidelines for the development of self-driving cars in a 15-point \"safety assessment,\" calling on automakers to voluntarily submit details of their systems to regulators. \nApple executives have been coy about their interest in cars. Chief Executive Tim Cook has suggested that Apple wants to move beyond the integration of Apple smart phones into vehicle infotainment systems. \nBut Apple has never confirmed reports last year that it was hiring automotive industry engineers and designers to develop a driverless electric car, or that those efforts have been sharply scaled back this year. \nOther companies pursuing self-driving cars include Alphabet Inc's Google unit, Ford Motor Co, Volkswagen AG, Daimler AG, Tesla Motors Inc and General Motors Co. \nApple has reportedly held talks about investing in British automaker McLaren Technology Group, but McLaren downplayed speculation that Apple had proposed an investment. \nApple joins a range of automakers and tech companies that have raised concerns about the proposed National Highway Traffic Safety Administration policy on self-driving cars and plans by California state regulators to make complying with the safety assessment mandatory. \nAn auto trade group in November urged the incoming Trump administration to conduct a \"comprehensive regulatory review\" of all regulations and actions since Sept. 1, including the Obama administration's guidance on self-driving vehicles. \n0 0 Apple shows ambition to get into self-driving car race was posted in Sci-Tech of Geo TV - https://www.geo.tv on December 04, 2016 and was last updated on December 04, 2016.

      "text": "Apple Needs a New Product, Not Just an Updated iPhone Apple's iPhone 8, expected next year, already sounds disappointing to some critics. Natalie Walters Nov29,20161:11PMEST \nNEW YORK ( TheStreet ) -- Shares of Apple ( AAPL ) were slightly higher in early afternoon trading on Tuesday, the day after The Wall Street Journal reported that it was testing 10 different prototypes for the iPhone 8. The new phone model is expected to be released in 2017, the iPhone's 10th anniversary. \nSome possibilities include a curved screen, glass casing or an edge-to-edge screen, according to the Journal . \nApple is coming out with this product because it needs to reinvent itself, said Fox Business' Ashley Webster on \"Varney & Company\" on Tuesday. People are expecting and wanting Apple to release a unique product, he added. \nApple is a holding in Jim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS Charitable Trust Portfolio . Want to be alerted before Cramer buys or sells AAPL ? Learn more now . \nThe tech giant needs to reestablish growth by creating something new, agreed Rosecliff Capital's Michael Murphy on the show. \"Updating the iPhone from a 6 to a 7 to an 8 isn't innovation.\" \nApple stock is off its recent highs, and investors may want to consider whether the stock is a growth story before buying it, Murphy suggested. \nThe iPhone 8 design update already sounds \"more aesthetic than it is functionality,\" said Fiscal Times columnist and show guest Liz Peek. The fact that Apple still has 10 prototypes to test at this point \"doesn't seem very promising,\" she added. \nSeparately, TheStreet Ratings objectively rated this stock according to its \"risk-adjusted\" total return prospect over a 12-month investment horizon. Not based on the news in any given day, the rating may differ from Jim Cramer's view or that of this article's author. Prev 0 of 2 Next If you liked this article you might like ",

      "text": "Smartphones , Technology Who survived the 1,000 feet drop test – Google Pixel or Apple iPhone 7? Check out this video \nAre you clumsy in handling your expensive smartphone? Do you have the fear of your trusty smartphone slipping out of your hand and leave you with a cracked screen display? If yes, it is always better to know if the new phone you are buying can survive the drop test. \nIn a recent video uploaded by UnlockRiver.com, a YouTube channel which conducts drop tests on phones purely for enjoyment, put the Google Pixel and iPhone 7 to test. Both the Google Pixel and iPhone 7 are dropped from a height of 1,000 feet. \nAs you can see from the video above, the host introduces the drop test and says that he will be suspending the phones that were attached onto a drone, flown to 1,000 feet and he will eventually release the phones in mid-air as they go into free fall. Neither the Pixel nor the iPhone 7 survived the drop test, but it turned out to be the Pixel that suffered less damage than the iPhone 7. Both the phones’ screen were shattered and were not in a usable condition. While the iPhone 7’s back was full of scratches and dents, the Pixel’s remained largely undamaged besides the screen. \nWithout any guesses, we clearly get to know at the end of the video that Google Pixel appears to be the “tougher” of the two. While we all know that in no way any phone in the world can survive after being dropped from 1,000 feet, it is fun to watch expensive smartphones getting destroyed in an interesting way (assuming you like to watch it).",

      "text": "Hacking news , Technology Researchers bypass Activation Lock in Apple’s Latest iOS 10.1.1 Version (video) \nWith Touch ID becoming fairly simple to use on your iPhones, the Activation Lock can be said to be used as a last resort security feature if your fingerprint isn’t being recognized due to some bug. It allows users to remotely lock their device and delete their sensitive data in case the iPhone or iPad is stolen or misplaced. However, now it seems that even the Activation Lock in Apple’s latest iOS version is not safe. Researchers have managed to bypass the Activation Lock on the iPhone while it was running iOS 10.1.1, which is the latest software version from Apple for iPhones and iPads. \nWay back in October, security researcher Hemanth Joseph was able to crack the Activation Lock on an iPad by entering extremely long strings of characters in all fields of the Wi-Fi setup. This made iOS freeze and, when combined with opening and closing of the iPad’s Smart Cover, gave Joseph access to the device’s home screen. \nHowever, Apple definitely caught the attention of this little workaround and managed to close the loophole with the official release of iOS 10.1.1, but security researchers have managed to scale the security ladder once more. Allegedly, the loophole was later fixed by Apple with the release of iOS 10.1.1, but another researcher managed to bypass it anyway. Benjamin Kunz Mejri of Vulnerability Lab managed to recreate the issue by tweaking the method a little bit. In addition to using the Smart Cover of the tablet, he utilized screen rotation to achieve the same effect, thus gaining access to the home screen. \nHowever, it should be noted that this little trick only managed to give Benjamin a brief window of opportunity to strike. He states that the brief window was more than enough, as he claims that it can be prolonged by clicking the home button in that small window of time. Therefore, the Activation Lock can still be bypassed with relative ease, and Apple should definitely take a look at this once they prep their newest software update for iPhones and iPads.",

      "text": "\nIn a letter to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Apple’s Director of Product Integrity Steve Kenner asked regulators not to impose too many restrictions on testing self-driving cars. Advertisement \n“Executed properly under NHTSA’s guidance, automated vehicles have the potential to greatly enhance the human experience,” he explained . “Such principles should not, however, inhibit companies from making consequential progress; there is no need to compromise safety or innovation.” \nIs this letter further evidence of Apple’s intention to get into the self-driving car market? There’s nothing in the letter that suggests the company is investing in hardware—though in August, Apple filed a patent for some sort of vehicle . In the letter to the NHTSA, Kenner wrote that the company is “investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation.” Advertisement \nCompany spokesman Tom Neumayr told Reuters that the company sent the letter because of its “heavy investment in machine learning and autonomous systems.” \n“There are many potential applications for these technologies, including the future of transportation, so we want to work with NHTSA to help define the best practices for the industry,” Neumayrd said. Here's The Clearest Indication Yet Apple Still Wants In On Self-Driving Cars Here's The Clearest Indication Yet Apple Still Wants In On Self-Driving Cars Here's The Clearest Indication Yet Apple Still… After years of being shrouded in mystery, Apple’s car program came to a screeching halt this year… Read more Read more \nTo get there, Apple doesn’t want government regulation to interfere. “In order to best protect the traveling public and keep up with the pace of innovation, NHTSA should expedite requests for exemption and interpretation and petitions for rulemaking,” Kenner wrote. Apple is now part of a growing group of automakers and tech companies that have voiced trepidation about the NHTSA’s proposed policies on driverless vehicles. Advertisement Sponsored \nKenner also advocated for “expanded exemption authority” so tech companies could innovate “the development of life-saving technology.” The world’s largest tech company also asked that “established manufacturers and new entrants should be treated equally” by the NHSTA, in part to “promote fair competition.” \n“Instead of applying for exemptions, all companies should be given an opportunity to implement internal safety processes summarized in a Safety Assessment,” Kenner wrote. In other words, let the big boys on top handle it. Advertisement \nGovernment regulations are necessary, but also a pain in the ass. It comes as no surprise that the world’s largest tech company isn’t too keen on rules getting in the way of product development. After all, there’s always more money to be made, and in a ruthlessly capitalist society, we all want it as quick as possible. ",

      "text": "Apple shows ambition to get into self-driving car race Technology 2 hours ago (Dec 03, 2016 03:53PM ET) This article has already been saved in your Saved Items © Reuters. An Apple logo hangs above the entrance to the Apple store on 5th Avenue in the Manhattan borough of New York City \nBy David Shepardson \nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Apple Inc (O: AAPL ) is wading in to the debate over regulation of self-driving cars, declaring it is excited about the potential for automated transportation and calling on U.S. regulators not to restrict testing of such vehicles. \nA five-page letter from Steve Kenner, Apple's director of product integrity, to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is the company's most comprehensive statement yet about its interest in self-driving vehicle technology. The Nov. 22 letter followed more than a year of industry speculation about the computer and iPhone maker's plans for expanding into transportation. \n\"The company is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation,\" Kenner wrote. \n\"Executed properly under NHTSA's guidance, automated vehicles have the potential to greatly enhance the human experience — to prevent millions of car crashes and thousands of fatalities each year and to give mobility to those without.\" \nApple urged regulators not to impose too many restrictions on testing of self-driving cars, saying \"established manufacturers and new entrants should be treated equally.\" \nSince software would decide what actions to take in potentially dangerous situations, Apple said certain areas need special attention. These include the implications of algorithmic decisions for the safety, mobility and legality of automated vehicles and their occupants, ensuring privacy and security in design, and the impact of the cars on employment and public spaces. \nSome analysts forecast millions of jobs will be lost once self-driving cars largely replace truck, taxi and Uber drivers, and eliminate the need for most vehicle repairs, insurance adjusters and other functions. \nApple's letter was prompted by its heavy investment in machine learning and autonomous systems, company spokesman Tom Neumayr said in an emailed statement. \n\"There are many potential applications for these technologies, including the future of transportation, so we want to work with NHTSA to help define the best practices for the industry,\" he said. \nIn September, the Obama administration proposed guidelines for the development of self-driving cars in a 15-point \"safety assessment,\" calling on automakers to voluntarily submit details of their systems to regulators. \nApple executives have been coy about their interest in cars. Chief Executive Tim Cook has suggested that Apple wants to move beyond integration of Apple smartphones into vehicle infotainment systems. \nBut Apple has never confirmed reports last year that it was hiring automotive industry engineers and designers to develop a driverless electric car, or that those efforts have been sharply scaled back this year. \nOther companies pursuing self-driving cars include Alphabet Inc's Google unit (O: GOOGL ), Ford Motor Co (N: F ), Volkswagen AG (DE: VOWG_p ), Daimler AG (DE: DAIGn ), Tesla Motors Inc (O: TSLA ) and General Motors Co (N: GM ). \nApple has reportedly held talks about investing in British automaker McLaren Technology Group, but McLaren downplayed speculation that Apple had proposed an investment. \nApple joins a range of automakers and tech companies that have raised concerns about the proposed National Highway Traffic Safety Administration policy on self-driving cars, and plans by California state regulators to make complying with the safety assessment mandatory. \nAn auto trade group in November urged the incoming Trump administration to conduct a \"comprehensive regulatory review\" of all regulations and actions since Sept. 1, including the Obama administration's guidance on self-driving vehicles.

      "text": "In a letter to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), Apple’s director of product integrity Steve Kenner, responded to a set of proposed guidelines for regulating the fast-emerging autonomous car industry.\nApple’s suggestions include instructions for how industry data should be shared and controlled, as well as a request that new players in the self-driving car field have the same road testing rights as incumbents, which the The Fixing America’s Surface Transportation (FAST) Act currently does not allow for.\n“We’ve provided comments to NHTSA because Apple is investing heavily in machine learning and autonomous systems,” said Apple spokesman Tom Neumayr in a statement . “There are many potential applications for these technologies, including the future of transportation, so we want to work with NHTSA to help define the best practices for the industry.”\nRecommended: How much do you know about the auto industry's future? The Nov. 22 letter is the closest Apple has come to admitting what has been widely rumored in the tech world: that it is working on autonomous car technology.\nTest your knowledge How much do you know about the auto industry's future? Photos of the Day Photos of the weekend Project Titan, the name given to its not-so-secret project, started out as a research and development team working on designing a fully electric car. This summer, a string of new hires suggested that the team had shifted its focus to autonomous technology.\nFurther industry speculation suggests that Apple has scrapped the idea of building the car itself, at least for the time being, and is instead focusing on designing the software and perhaps partnering with an automaker in the future, as General Motors and Cruise Automation did earlier this year .\nFocusing on software is more in line with the company’s historic expertise and fits its efforts to improve machine-learning capabilities that allow computers to adjust their behavior without being explicitly programmed.\nIn Kenner's letter, he offers proposals that uphold the veil of secrecy Apple has kept their autonomous projects under. For example, Kenner suggests that companies be able to test autonomous vehicles on the road without having to apply for the exemption currently required by the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards – an exemption that, he argues, slows down the development process.\nIt also requires revealing the contents of the project.\nKenner’s letter focuses largely on streamlining the approval process. He suggests that small changes to a car’s design “should not require multiple Safety Assessments, which would be a significant administrative burden for both NHTSA and companies.”\nRemoving the exemption process entirely, Kenner writes, would also effectively level the playing field for “new entrants” to the autonomous car industry and give them the same opportunities that “established manufacturers” are granted. The FAST Act currently does not allow that.\nApple also addressed the issue of data, suggesting that companies working on autonomous technology should make their test data publicly available so that other companies could reconstruct crash events for research purposes.\n“By sharing data, the industry will build a more comprehensive dataset than any one company could create alone,” Kenner wrote. “This will allow everyone in the industry to design systems to better detect and respond to the broadest set of nominal and edge-case scenarios.”\nThe letter offered no concrete details about the progress of Project Titan, except to acknowledge that “the company is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation.”\nHowever, Kenner’s requests to the NHTSA offer clues. He encouraged the agency to work internationally, with groups such as the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, which hints at plans to sell the Apple car product, whether that be a full car or just the software, internationally.",

      "text": "Apple letter offers a clue to its self-driving car plans A letter to the NHTSA shows its interest in testing autonomous car technology. Save Chesnot/Getty Images \nApple's hopes of developing self-driving car technology have been a poorly kept secret for a while, and now it's coming clean. The company has sent a letter to the US' National Highway Traffic Safety Administration acknowledging that the company is \"excited\" about automation in numerous fields, \"including transportation.\" It wants to test self-driving car tech, and it's hoping to address both ethical and regulatory issues. It believes the industry should share crash (and near-crash) data to improve safety, for example, but this \"should not come at the cost of privacy .\" \nCrucially, Apple also believes that incumbent automakers might have an unfair edge. It wants newcomers to have the \"same opportunity\" to test self-driving vehicles that more \"established\" companies do, without having to chase after regulatory exemptions like it would today. \nIn a statement to the Financial Times , Apple confirmed the letter's core message: the firm wrote to the NHTSA because it's \"investing heavily in machine learning and autonomous systems,\" and it wants to help shape the \"best practices\" for self-driving cars. It's not confirming what it's making, however, including reports that it scaled back its automotive plans to focus on an underlying tech platform instead of building vehicles. There's no longer any doubt that Apple is interested in driverless cars, but there's also no guarantee that its technology will reach production cars in the first place, let alone that you'll see something Apple-branded on the road.",

      "text": "By Tim Higgins and Tripp Mickle\nIn letter to U.S. transportation regulators, Apple said it is investing heavily in machine learning and automation\nApple Inc. took its biggest step toward acknowledging it is working on autonomous vehicles, writing a letter to U.S. regulators offering feedback on proposed guidelines for the emerging technology.\nThe letter from Steve Kenner, Apple's (AAPL) director of product integrity, to the head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration offered no details on the project, but said Apple \"is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation.\"\nCupertino, Calif.-based Apple has been working on its car effort, code-named Project Titan, for several years, but has never publicly acknowledged it. The secrecy has made the exact status of Project Titan hard to pinpoint. The Wall Street Journal reported in September that Apple had restructured some elements of the project, which has had several hundred employees working on it, after placing it under veteran Apple executive Bob Mansfield in July.\nApple has looked at doing an entire car, but more recently its focus has narrowed to developing an autonomous-driving system and software. Focusing on software is more in line with the company's historic expertise and fits its efforts to improve machine-learning capabilities that allow computers to adjust their behavior without being explicitly programmed.\nApple's five-page letter, dated Nov. 22, appears on the NHTSA website. It isn't clear when it was posted.\nAn expanded version of this report appears on wsj.com (http://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-drops-hints-about-autonomous-vehicle-project-1480749280).\n-Tim Higgins;\n 1347ET\n ",

      "text": "3 December 2016 at 10:38pm Apple works to tackle spam events filling iPhone calendars \nApple engineers are urgently working to fix a loophole in its iPhone software which has seen thousands of users' calendars filled with fake spam events. Credit: PA \nIn recent weeks, iPhone users have reported phony sale events such as $19.99 Ray-Ban Sunglasses and 50% off Ugg boots appearing without warning in their calendars - often with loud notifications when the 'event' is due to begin. \nSpammers have been exploiting what was intended as a convenience feature, wherein the iCal app automatically detects when the user has been invited to a meeting and schedules it into the calendar. \nApple bosses have assured users their accounts have not been hacked - similar to e-mail spam, the invites are blanket-sent to a range of accounts. \nBut unlike e-mail spam or junk folders, Apple does not have any filtering or blocking system for its iPhone calendars, meaning it cannot discern between the fake events and real ones. \nSpeaking to the Wall Street Journal about the problem, an Apple spokesman apologised to anyone affected. \nWe are sorry that some of our users are receiving spam calendar invitations. \nWe are actively working to address this issue by identifying and blocking suspicious senders and spam in the invites being sent. – Apple spokesman \nIn the meantime, some users have been sharing tips for preventing the 'events' being added to the calendars automatically. Don't click 'decline' : This alerts the spammers that your account is active, and you may end up receiving more invites. Divert all calendar invites to e-mail : Visit iCloud.com, select Calendar, then choose the settings icon at the bottom. In the 'advanced settings' section, you should be able to change 'invitations' to 'E-mail to [your address]'. Turn off the iCloud calendar : If you don't use it, or use a different kind of calendar, simply head to Settings - iCloud, and turn the calendar off. Last updated Sat 3 Dec 2016",

      "text": "© 2016 Time Inc. All rights reserved. Apple Gives Feedback on Autonomous Vehicle Regulation \nApple has sent a letter to the head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration providing feedback on the agency’s planned regulations on self-driving vehicles. Though it does not fully acknowledge the existence of Apple’s long-mysterious autonomous vehicle project, widely referred to as “Project Titan,” the letter does say the company is “investing heavily in machine learning and automation,” and paints Apple as a player in the autonomous vehicle industry. \nThe letter, accessible here , also contains several recommendations that, if acted on, would benefit new entrants to the auto industry. For instance, it recommends regulation requiring manufacturers to share data from crashes and near-misses, “sufficient to reconstruct the event.” Apple writes that it “looks forward to collaborating with other stakeholders to define the specific data that should be shared.” Get Data Sheet , Fortune ’s technology newsletter. \nData sharing, even in the limited scope of crash data, could be a hard sell without regulatory intervention. Driving telemetry, imaging, and mapping data are likely to be the single most valuable tool in making self-driving cars reliable, and some players, particularly Tesla, have a massive lead in miles driven and data logged. \nApple’s letter, signed by Director of Product Integrity Steve Kenner, also takes issue with a recent rule that seems to privilege established manufacturers. The 2015 FAST Act loosened rules on public testing of new vehicles, but according to Apple, those rules only applied to “established manufacturers” and should be broadened to give the same leeway to new market entrants. For more on driverless cars, watch our video. \nApple’s comments also include some interesting general feedback, for instance calling on NHTSA to consider the ethical implications of algorithmic decision making. Carmakers, including Mercedes , have wrestled with how their cars might weigh passengers’ lives against bystanders’. \nThe letter also, intriguingly, suggests NHTSA should consider “the impact of automated vehicles on the public good, including their consequences for employment and public spaces.” While there is growing concern that driverless vehicles will accentuate inequality by eliminating jobs for truck and taxi drivers, it’s unclear what role a safety agency might play in addressing that. \nIn September, Apple reportedly restructured its unit working on autonomous vehicles, apparently shifting focus away from building its own car, and instead towards software systems.",

      "text": "Apple reveals self-driving car ambitions By AFP Apple's interest in entering the autonomous vehicle sector have been revealed. (Getty) \nApple has revealed it is investing heavily in autonomous vehicles in a letter asking the government to make it easier to develop self-driving cars. \nThe company is \"excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation,\" Apple said in a November 22 letter to the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). \n\"Apple looks forward to collaborating with NHTSA and other stakeholders so that the significant societal benefits of automated vehicles can be realized safely, responsibly, and expeditiously,\" the company's director of product integrity Steve Kenner wrote. \nApple issued the letter because it is \"investing heavily in machine learning and autonomous systems,\" an Apple spokesman said in an email to AFP. \n\"There are many potential applications for these technologies, including the future of transportation, so we want to work with NHTSA to help define the best practices for the industry.\" \nRumours about Apple's ambitions in the sector have circulated for years. \nThe company has a separate organization called \"Project Titan\" that is developing automotive projects. \nAlthough Apple has never officially confirmed the project, several of CEO Tim Cook's comments fuelled speculation. \nAfter an A$1.34 billion investment in a Chinese ride-hailing service called Didi Chuxing, he spoke of \"some strategic things that the companies can do together over time.\" \nHowever, in early September, The New York Times reported that the group had narrowed its ambitions, laying off dozens of staff as part of the project's \"reboot.\" \nInstead of designing and producing a complete self-driving car, the group will now concentrate on developing underlying technologies for autonomous vehicles. \nIn its letter, Apple urged the NHTSA not to penalize new participants in the sector by restricting the testing of cars under development on public roads, for which established automakers generally have exemptions. \n\"To maximize the safety benefits of automated vehicles, encourage innovation, and promote fair competition, established manufacturers and new entrants should be treated equally,\" it said. \nApple also encourages data sharing, particularly for accidents, saying that would enable the industry to \"build a more comprehensive dataset than any one company could create alone.\" \nMost major auto manufacturers and many technology groups are currently developing autonomous vehicles, considered to be the future of the automobile, along with electric power, with first production models promised for around 2020. © AFP 2016",

      "text": "View photos\nVia Flickr/Andy Ihnatko\nIn the past, Apple has had some trouble wrapping their heads around the idea of a self-driving car. Despite their stumbles, the company is still confident it can get into the automated transportation business.\nApple has always been at the forefront of technology design, with people lining up for days for their products. But one nut they haven’t been able to crack yet is the self-driving car, although it isn’t like they haven’t tried. In September, it laid off dozens of employees who were a part of its self-driving car division, as it was looking to change directions. But it then purchased McLaren later that month, leading some to believe the iCar would end up a reality. And the company has been dropping clues about the direction they are thinking of taking.\nIn a letter from Steve Kenner, Apple’s director of product integrity, to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the company said it is all for getting into the automotive business and is excited to get started :\n“The company is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation. Executed properly under NHTSA’s guidance, automated vehicles have the potential to greatly enhance the human experience — to prevent millions of car crashes and thousands of fatalities each year and to give mobility to those without.”\nBut like it has done in the past, Apple noted how a self-driving car could take some time to roll out. Reuters reported the company would need to take extra precaution with safety abilities :\nSince software would decide what actions to take in potentially dangerous situations, Apple said certain areas need special attention. These include the “implications of algorithmic decisions” for the safety, mobility and legality of automated vehicles and their occupants, ensuring privacy and security in design, and the impact of the cars on employment and public spaces.\nBut the self-driving car may not come to the fruition for awhile, as Reuters reported Apple and other companies are still hoping for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration reviews its safety assessment further.\n(Via Reuters )",

      "text": "Apple's hopes of developing self-driving car technology have been a poorly kept secret for a while, and now it's coming clean. The company sent a letter to the US' National Highway Traffic Safety Administration acknowledging that the company is \"excited\" about automation in numerous fields, \"including transportation.\" It wants to test self-driving car tech, and it's hoping to address both ethical and regulatory issues. It believes the industry should share crash (and near-crash) data to improve safety, for example, but this \"should not come at the cost of privacy .\"\n\nCrucially, Apple also believes that incumbent automakers might have an unfair edge. It wants newcomers to have the \"same opportunity\" to test self-driving vehicles that more \"established\" companies do, without having to chase after regulatory exemptions like it would today.\n\nIn a statement to the Financial Times , Apple confirmed the letter's core message: the firm wrote to the NHTSA because it's \"investing heavily in machine learning and autonomous systems,\" and it wants to help shape the \"best practices\" for self-driving cars. It's not confirming what it's making, however, including reports that it scaled back its automotive plans to focus on an underlying tech platform instead of building vehicles. There's no longer any doubt that Apple is interested in driverless cars, but there's also no guarantee that its technology will reach production cars in the first place, let alone that you'll see something Apple-branded on the road.\n\nThis article by Jon Fingas originally ran on Engadget , the definitive guide to this connected life.",

The hardbound book was unveiled by Apple last month and chronicles 20 years of Apple’s design, expressed through 450 photographs of past and current Apple products. It's been mocked for its high $199/$299 price point. Apple's new coffee table book \"Designed by Apple in California\" features many products the company has produced over the last 20 years.

      "text": "  The logo of Apple is seen at a store in Zurich, Switzerland November 22, 2016. REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann\n\nBy David Shepardson\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Apple Inc is wading in to the debate over regulation of self-driving cars, declaring it is excited about the potential for automated transportation and calling on U.S. regulators not to restrict testing of such vehicles.\nA five-page letter from Steve Kenner, Apple's director of product integrity, to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is the company's most comprehensive statement yet about its interest in self-driving vehicle technology. The Nov. 22 letter followed more than a year of industry speculation about the computer and iPhone maker's plans for expanding into transportation.\n\"The company is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation,\" Kenner wrote.\n\"Executed properly under NHTSA's guidance, automated vehicles have the potential to greatly enhance the human experience — to prevent millions of car crashes and thousands of fatalities each year and to give mobility to those without.\"\nApple urged regulators not to impose too many restrictions on testing of self-driving cars, saying \"established manufacturers and new entrants should be treated equally.\"\nSince software would decide what actions to take in potentially dangerous situations, Apple said certain areas need special attention. These include the implications of algorithmic decisions for the safety, mobility and legality of automated vehicles and their occupants, ensuring privacy and security in design, and the impact of the cars on employment and public spaces.\nSome analysts forecast millions of jobs will be lost once self-driving cars largely replace truck, taxi and Uber drivers, and eliminate the need for most vehicle repairs, insurance adjusters and other functions.\nApple's letter was prompted by its heavy investment in machine learning and autonomous systems, company spokesman Tom Neumayr said in an emailed statement.\n\"There are many potential applications for these technologies, including the future of transportation, so we want to work with NHTSA to help define the best practices for the industry,\" he said.\nIn September, the Obama administration proposed guidelines for the development of self-driving cars in a 15-point \"safety assessment,\" calling on automakers to voluntarily submit details of their systems to regulators.\nApple executives have been coy about their interest in cars. Chief Executive Tim Cook has suggested that Apple wants to move beyond integration of Apple smartphones into vehicle infotainment systems.\nBut Apple has never confirmed reports last year that it was hiring automotive industry engineers and designers to develop a driverless electric car, or that those efforts have been sharply scaled back this year.\nOther companies pursuing self-driving cars include Alphabet Inc's Google unit, Ford Motor Co, Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE), Daimler AG, Tesla Motors Inc and General Motors Co.\nApple has reportedly held talks about investing in British automaker McLaren Technology Group, but McLaren downplayed speculation that Apple had proposed an investment.\nApple joins a range of automakers and tech companies that have raised concerns about the proposed National Highway Traffic Safety Administration policy on self-driving cars, and plans by California state regulators to make complying with the safety assessment mandatory.\nAn auto trade group in November urged the incoming Trump administration to conduct a \"comprehensive regulatory review\" of all regulations and actions since Sept. 1, including the Obama administration's guidance on self-driving vehicles.\n\n(Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Richard Chang)",

      "text": "Even though Apple has long been one of the most successful, profitable and closely-observed tech companies on the planet, it’s absolutely dumbfounding how often armchair pundits and analysts manage to get everything wrong about the company. In a dynamic that still defies explanation, Apple’s success is rarely applauded; on the contrary, its success is often used to justify the position that the company has peaked and is about to undergo an unforgiving fall from grace.\nDON’T MISS: Here’s how much money your cable company actually loses when you unsubscribe\nThat notwithstanding, the sentiment that Apple has lost its ability to innovate, meaningfully increase revenue and otherwise succeed has seemingly grown by leaps and bounds over the past few months. From critics bemoaning the MacBook Pro’s new Touch Bar as nothing more than a gimmick to analysts criticizing the iPhone 7 for sporting the same form factor as the two previous iPhone models, the idea that “Apple is doomed” is not only persistent, but is arguably more prevalent than it’s been in years.\nSure, Apple has the iPhone 8 coming out next year, and sure, analysts believe that the device will shatter all existing iPhone sales records, but that’s apparently as high as Apple will be able to go, according to some. In fact, analysts at Oppenheimer believe that Apple will soon “embark on a decade-long malaise.”\nIn a research note obtained by Business Insider , Opppenheimer writes: “Apple lacks the courage to lead the next generation of innovation (AI, cloud-based services, messaging); instead will become more reliant than ever on the iPhone … We believe Apple is about to embark on a decade-long malaise. The risks to the company have never been greater.”\nNothing in the tech sphere is ever predictable, but I think we can all agree that predicting where a company will be in 10 years is utterly absurd. Consider this: the iPhone didn’t even exist 10 years ago. Even in a more compressed time frame, look at how quickly Netflix managed to turn into an entertainment juggernaut and how quickly Microsoft managed to turn things around with Satya Nadella at the helm.\nThe idea that Apple lacks the “courage” to be at the vanguard of the next generation of innovation is certainly interesting, and not wholly without merit, but it completely ignores the fact that no one at this point knows what the next great area of innovation will be. Will it in fact be AI? Or will it be augmented reality? Or, perhaps, virtual reality? Or maybe it will be something completely different, something that’s not on anyone’s radar at the moment.\nMicrosoft famously missed the wave of smartphone innovation that Apple ushered in when it released the iPhone. Apple, however, has yet to miss a wave of innovation. Consequently, the idea that Apple is about to fall into a “decade-long malaise” seems a bit off the mark.\nApple certainly faces a number of challenges, but it’s always struck me as peculiar that Apple is never afforded the benefit of the doubt when it has a long track record of delivering innovative products to the marketplace.\nOppenheimer’s note concludes: “We believe its strong profitability, a cash hoard for protection, and one last ‘growth’ hurrah from the tenth-anniversary phone will keep investors interested in the company.”\nFunny thing is, analysts have been predicting Apple’s ‘last growth hurrah’ for years on end.\nTrending right now:\nYou get one last chance to buy a NES Classic Edition before Christmas NES Classic and Hatchimals might actually be in stock at one store this weekend This dude actually built a portable, wearable Tesla coil gun See the original version of this article on BGR.com",

      "title": "Apple Insists It Is Still Excited About A Self-Driving Car Despite Its Previous Obstacles",
      "text": "Via Flickr/Andy Ihnatko\nIn the past, Apple has had some trouble wrapping their heads around the idea of a self-driving car. Despite their stumbles, the company is still confident it can get into the automated transportation business.\nApple has always been at the forefront of technology design, with people lining up for days for their products. But one nut they haven’t been able to crack yet is the self-driving car, although it isn’t like they haven’t tried. In September, it laid off dozens of employees who were a part of its self-driving car division, as it was looking to change directions. But it then purchased McLaren later that month, leading some to believe the iCar would end up a reality. And the company has been dropping clues about the direction they are thinking of taking.\nIn a letter from Steve Kenner, Apple’s director of product integrity, to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the company said it is all for getting into the automotive business and is excited to get started :\n“The company is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation. Executed properly under NHTSA’s guidance, automated vehicles have the potential to greatly enhance the human experience — to prevent millions of car crashes and thousands of fatalities each year and to give mobility to those without.”\nBut like it has done in the past, Apple noted how a self-driving car could take some time to roll out. Reuters reported the company would need to take extra precaution with safety abilities :\nSince software would decide what actions to take in potentially dangerous situations, Apple said certain areas need special attention. These include the “implications of algorithmic decisions” for the safety, mobility and legality of automated vehicles and their occupants, ensuring privacy and security in design, and the impact of the cars on employment and public spaces.\nBut the self-driving car may not come to the fruition for awhile, as Reuters reported Apple and other companies are still hoping for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration reviews its safety assessment further.\n(Via Reuters )",

      "text": "iCar In The Works? Apple's Statement About Automated Vehicle To NHTSA Hints Yes 3 December 2016, 9:54 pm EST By Sumit Passary Tech Times Apple's interest in the car industry is still alive, suggests a letter to the NHTSA. Apple wants that new entrants in the car industry and established players should be treated equally. ( Justin Sullivan | Getty Images ) Advertisement \nApple has written a letter to the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration telling that new companies entering the auto industry should be given the same rights as established companies. This letter hints that Apple has the rumored iCar in the works. Apple's Letter To NHTSA \nApple's letter to the NHTSA indicates that the company still has plans of testing autonomous cars. \n\"Apple uses machine learning to make its products and services smarter, more intuitive, and more personal. The company is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation,\" says the letter written by Steve Kenner, the director of product integrity at Apple. \nIt is worth noting that Kenner used to work as the global director of automotive safety at Ford. According to a MacRumors report , it remains unknown when Kenner joined Apple. However, Kenner's LinkedIn profile still shows him as a Ford employee. \nKenner's letter to the NHTSA also suggests that new entrants in the industry should be given the same opportunity as established car companies. Apple highlights that existing carmakers do not have to pursue exemptions to the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards when trying to test cars on public roads because of the Fixing America's Surface Transportation (FAST) Act. \nHowever, new players such as Google do not enjoy the same right per the FAST Act. Can NHTSA Modify The FAST Act? \nThe NHTSA cannot make amendments to the FAST Act; however, it can update the Federal Automated Vehicles Policy to bypass any requirement for exemptions, which would help road testing of cars by new companies such as Apple. Apple's Interest In Developing Electric Cars Dubbed iCar \nApple is well known for making iPhones, iPads, iMacs and other tech-related products. Although the company is highly valued in the tech industry, it has minimal knowledge of making cars. Rumors of Apple developing a car have been surfacing for several months. \nApple's car development team is said to be working under Project Titan, which is rumored to staff more than 1,000 engineers. \nIn October 2015, Elon Musk, the CEO of electric car company Tesla, also alleged that Apple was poaching Tesla engineers in the company's ambition to develop an electric car. This suggests that Apple is keen on developing an iCar. \nHowever, a previous Tech Times report noted that Apple's interest in the car industry has reduced and the company is now focusing more on the software side than manufacturing autonomous vehicles. \nApple has remained secretive on the development of the iCar and only time will tell if and when the company officially confirms the Apple-branded car .

      "title": "For Apple and others, tin supply chain has ties to rebel-held Myanmar mine",
      "text": "(Corrects Nov. 29 story to clarify that Shenmao Technology did not say it bought tin from the Wa mine)\nBy Yimou Lee and Joel Schectman\nYANGON/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - From a remote corner of northeastern Myanmar, an insurgent army sells tin ore to suppliers of some of the world's largest consumer companies.\nMore than 500 companies, including leading brands such as smartphone maker Apple, coffee giant Starbucks and luxury jeweler Tiffany & Co, list among their suppliers Chinese-controlled firms that indirectly buy ore from the Man Maw mine near Myanmar's border with China, a Reuters examination of the supply chain found.\nThe mine is controlled by the United Wa State Army (UWSA), which the United States placed under sanctions for alleged narcotics trafficking in 2003. The seven companies extracting tin from the mine are all owned or controlled by Wa military and government leaders, Wa officials and people with close ties to UWSA leadership told Reuters.\nThis potentially puts companies, which also include industrial conglomerate General Electric, at risk of violating sanctions that forbid \"direct or indirect\" dealings with blacklisted groups, according to a former and a serving U.S. official and lawyers with expertise in sanctions enforcement.\nSeveral sanctions experts said the U.S. government was unlikely to fine companies who unwittingly used the Myanmar tin. Still, it may force them to shift to new suppliers, they said.\nA Treasury Department spokeswoman said U.S. sanctions \"generally prohibit U.S. companies from engaging in any direct or indirect transactions or dealings with individuals or entities\" on a blacklist, but declined further comment on specific circumstances.\nThe situation illustrates the difficulties facing multinationals in monitoring supply chains that have grown increasingly complex.\nFollowing a 2012 U.S. regulation, companies have spent billions of dollars scrutinizing whether certain minerals used in their products come from mines controlled by armed groups in Central Africa.\nBut the regulations do not require them to assess the origins of minerals from other conflict zones.\nApple, Tiffany and GE, and other companies contacted by Reuters, said that to fulfill those regulations they looked to an audit program designed by the industry group Conflict Free Sourcing Initiative (CFSI).\nA CFSI program director said the group was \"aware of tin exports from Myanmar to other countries and of security and human rights issues in Myanmar\". The group said it was updating its audit requirements to include \"a broader definition of conflict-affected and high-risk areas\".\nTin supply chain expert at monitoring group Global Witness, Sophia Pickles, said companies must not wholly outsource due diligence responsibility to a scheme that has exclusively focused on central Africa.\n\"Companies, not schemes, bear the primary responsibility for ensuring that supply chains are responsible,\" she said.\nCIVIL WAR\nMost of the tin mined globally is used as solder in electronics, for making batteries and plating.\nThe Man Maw mine roiled the global tin market when huge quantities of high grade ore were discovered around 2013. Annual production is now estimated at about 33,000 tons of tin concentrate, more than a 10th of global output of the metal.\nThe mine is controlled by the UWSA, the strongest of the myriad armed groups that have kept Myanmar in a state of near-perpetual civil war for decades. Reuters visited the remote mine last month, the first international media organization to do so.\nInterviews with officials running the mine, UWSA leaders and executives at Asian tin suppliers, together with an examination of public disclosures of suppliers made by companies in regulatory filings, indicate Wa tin likely ends up in an array of products made by U.S. and other international companies.\nTin from Man Maw provides revenue critical to the survival of the self-proclaimed Wa State and its rulers, who have refused to disarm or participate in Myanmar's peace process. \"There are dozens of trucks carrying tin ore to China every morning,\" the head of the Wa territory foreign affairs office, Zhao Guo An, told Reuters. \"Tin mining is the pillar of our economy. It's the biggest source of income.\"\nWhile Washington has lifted most sanctions on Myanmar, some have been kept in place, including those aimed at the UWSA. The group and several of its leaders are blacklisted under the Kingpin Act over accusations of trafficking in heroin and methamphetamine. UWSA leaders deny involvement in narcotics, saying the accusations are a smear by political opponents.\nPeter Kucik, a former senior sanctions advisor at the U.S. Treasury Department, said the findings highlighted the need for thorough due diligence.\n\"The facts suggest potential sanctions risk for the parties involved,\" Kucik said.\nThe world's No. 1 tin producer, Yunnan Tin Co Ltd, told Reuters that some tin it bought was from the Wa mine, the source of almost all Myanmar's tin exports.\nMandy Gan, a tin analyst from China's leading mineral research company, Asian Metal, and another tin expert, both of whom visited the UWSA mine this year, said many other Chinese smelting firms supplying global consumer goods makers also bought tin from the Man Maw mine.\nSanctions experts said even the indirect use of the tin might be considered a violation of U.S. sanctions law, which does not require authorities to prove intent. A U.S. government official involved in Myanmar policy consulted on Reuters' findings said the government was likely to investigate any ties to the UWSA.\nStill, Washington-based sanctions attorney Erich Ferrari said it was unlikely the Treasury Department would initiate an enforcement action against companies for an issue so deep in the supply chain. Once the ties were publicized, however, authorities could impose penalties if the companies did not wind down the transactions and find new suppliers, he said.\nSUPPLY CHAIN\nThe chain connecting some of the world's best known brands with a mine in one the most inaccessible corners of Southeast Asia has many links. ((For a GRAPHIC, click on: http://tmsnrt.rs/2giJmcq))\nOne key intermediary is state-owned Yunnan Cultural Industry International (YCII), based in Yunnan, southwestern China, which said in a statement on its website that it enjoys \"a long-term, stable strategic partnership\" with the UWSA statelet.\nYCII declined several interview requests.\nYCII is, in turn, a major supplier of tin to the world's top producer, Yunnan Tin, also based in Yunnan.\nYunnan Tin supplies many companies, including big contract manufacturers such as Foxconn Technology Co. It also supplies major solder makers such as Shenmao Technology, whose clients include Pegatron Corp, another large contract manufacturer. Both Pegatron and Foxconn count Apple among their clients.\nTim Lin, an executive overseeing sourcing at Taiwan-based Shenmao, said about a quarter of its supply of the metal came from Yunnan Tin. While it was possible Yunnan Tin bought tin from Myanmar, sourcing from the country was not regarded as problematic by the audit program Shenmao follows, he said.\n\"Myanmar is not considered a conflict-affected area by CFSI...As long as smelters present a certified sourcing document, that's acceptable for us,\" said Lin.\nIn the last two years, Yunnan Tin has also shipped more than 12,000 tons of metal to the United States, according to shipment data from U.S.-based trade tracking company Panjiva.\nMore than 500 publicly traded companies in the United States say their suppliers use tin from Yunnan Tin or Yuntinic Resources, its San Mateo, California-based division, according to a review of the supply chain disclosures consumer companies make to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\nTwo members of Yunnan Tin's board, vice chairwoman Yang Yimin and secretary and vice general manager Pan Wenhao, confirmed in interviews that a \"portion\" of the company's tin came from the UWSA-operated mine.\n\"We certainly buy tin indirectly from Myanmar,\" Pan told Reuters. \"We don't specifically pay attention to where they source their materials from.\"\nYunnan Tin mixes the Wa tin with metal from mines in central and southwestern China, said Pan, before processing it into products such as tin paste.\nThat means it is impossible to say for certain which shipments from the company contain Wa tin, but Pan estimated Yunnan Tin's purchases from the mine account for about a third of its total annual tin consumption, or at least 16,500 tons.\nApple said in a statement it worked with suppliers to help them meet stringent standards, \"and those who are ultimately unable or unwilling to comply are removed from our supply chain\".\n\"While we have no evidence of illegal tin from Myanmar in our products, we'll continue to investigate, address any issues we find and do all we can to raise standards and protect human rights,\" it said.\nFoxconn said it \"enforced stringent supplier management requirements in accordance with international and local conflict minerals legislation and has proactively communicated these requirements to our suppliers\".\nIt added that less than 1 percent of its tin was procured from Yunnan Tin, all of which was used in products for a \"single, non-U.S.-based customer\".\nPegatron Corp said it carried out \"annual due diligence on suppliers and encourage them to source from validated conflict-free supply chains\".\n\"Pegatron will continue working with customers and international organizations to investigate and source minerals responsibly,\" the company added.\nFROM JEWELRY TO APPLIANCES\nCompanies that sell consumer products in the United States are required by the Dodd-Frank Act to publish their suppliers of tin and other minerals.\nAmong the companies listing Yunnan Tin, Tiffany said one of its suppliers had indirectly sourced a \"very small amount of tin\" from the Chinese smelter for use in silver solder for jewelry and hollowware.\nThe company added that, as Yunnan Tin was certified as conflict-free by the CFSI, \"use of this smelter by our vendors is consistent with our Conflict Minerals Policy\".\nStarbucks said small amounts of Yunnan Tin metal, sourced from second or third party suppliers, went into the ovens in its coffee shops.\nThe company had received no information indicating it was using minerals from Myanmar, a spokeswoman said, but was pushing suppliers for more detailed sourcing disclosures.\nA GE spokesman said the company strived to use ethical sourcing in its mineral supply chain, adding it had \"noted the concerns raised by Reuters and will address them through our internal process and with our external partners\".\nA spokeswoman from discount retailer Target said in a statement it was \"committed to responsible business conduct\".\n\"We take these allegations very seriously, and we are looking into this,\" the statement said.\n(Additional reporting by Antoni Slodkowski in Yangon, JR Wu in Taipei, Jussi Rosendahl in Helsinki and Helena Soderpalm in Stockholm, Paul Carsten in Beijing and Sijia Jiang in Hong Kong; Editing by Alex Richardson)",

      "title": "Apple’s letter to the NHTSA hints that there may be some truth to Project Titan",
      "text": "cchana/Flickr\nOver the course of several months, we’ve been in danger of suffering from whiplash as a result of all the swiveling back and forth to keep up with the countless rumors swirling around Apple’s so-called “ Project Titan ,” its mysterious (alleged) car project. But now, the tech giant has finally seemed to publicly acknowledge that there is indeed an Apple car in the works. In early December, a letter from Steve Kenner , Apple’s director of product integrity, to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration was discovered, in which Apple offered “comments on the proposed Federal Automated Vehicles Policy.”\nNow why else would the Cupertino company do that unless it had some serious skin in the game?\nIn the letter, which is dated November 22, 2016, Apple notes that it “uses machine learning to make its products and services smarter, more intuitive, and more personal,” and further, that it is “investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation.”\nMore : Study shows that most knockoff Apple chargers are unsafe\nKenner further noted that when executed properly, “automated vehicles have the potential to greatly enhance the human experience — to prevent millions of car crashes and thousands of fatalities each year and to give mobility to those without. It is vital that those developing and deploying automated vehicles follow rigorous safety principles in design and production.”\nUltimately, Apple said, “In order to best protect the traveling public and keep up with the pace of innovation, NHTSA should expedite requests for exemption and interpretation and petitions for rulemaking. NHTSA and Congress should also continue to explore new tools and authorities like those outlined in Section IV of the Policy — including expanded exemption authority — with the goal of fostering innovation, improving regulatory flexibility, and encouraging the development of life-saving technology.”\nAll this seems to suggest in no uncertain terms that Apple knows what it wants, and it’s a future in cars.\n“We’ve provided comments to NHTSA because Apple is investing heavily in machine learning and autonomous systems,” Apple spokesman Tom Neumayr said Friday. “There are many potential applications for these technologies, including the future of transportation, so we want to work with NHTSA to help define the best practices for the industry.”\nApple Car rumor roundup: Here’s all you need to know about ‘Project Titan’ Apple reportedly in talks with self-balancing motorcycle startup Lit Motors Apple reportedly in talks to buy supercar maker McLaren",

      "text": "Apple shows ambition to get into self-driving car race >> Reuters Published: 2016-12-04 11:08:34.0 BdST Updated: 2016-12-04 11:08:34.0 BdST Apple has never confirmed reports last year that it was hiring automotive industry engineers and designers to develop a driverless electric car, or that those efforts have been sharply scaled back this year. Reuters Apple is wading in to the debate over regulation of self-driving cars, declaring it is excited about the potential for automated transportation and calling on US regulators not to restrict testing of such vehicles. \nA five-page letter from Steve Kenner, Apple's director of product integrity, to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is the company's most comprehensive statement yet about its interest in self-driving vehicle technology. \nThe Nov 22 letter followed more than a year of industry speculation about the computer and iPhone maker's plans for expanding into transportation. \n\"The company is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation,\" Kenner wrote. \n\"Executed properly under NHTSA's guidance, automated vehicles have the potential to greatly enhance the human experience — to prevent millions of car crashes and thousands of fatalities each year and to give mobility to those without.\" \nApple urged regulators not to impose too many restrictions on testing of self-driving cars, saying \"established manufacturers and new entrants should be treated equally.\" \nSince software would decide what actions to take in potentially dangerous situations, Apple said certain areas need special attention. These include the implications of algorithmic decisions for the safety, mobility and legality of automated vehicles and their occupants, ensuring privacy and security in design, and the impact of the cars on employment and public spaces. \nSome analysts forecast millions of jobs will be lost once self-driving cars largely replace truck, taxi and Uber drivers, and eliminate the need for most vehicle repairs, insurance adjusters and other functions. \nApple's letter was prompted by its heavy investment in machine learning and autonomous systems, company spokesman Tom Neumayr said in an emailed statement. \n\"There are many potential applications for these technologies, including the future of transportation, so we want to work with NHTSA to help define the best practices for the industry,\" he said. \nIn September, the Obama administration proposed guidelines for the development of self-driving cars in a 15-point \"safety assessment,\" calling on automakers to voluntarily submit details of their systems to regulators. \nApple executives have been coy about their interest in cars. Chief Executive Tim Cook has suggested that Apple wants to move beyond integration of Apple smartphones into vehicle infotainment systems. \nBut Apple has never confirmed reports last year that it was hiring automotive industry engineers and designers to develop a driverless electric car, or that those efforts have been sharply scaled back this year. \nOther companies pursuing self-driving cars include Alphabet Inc's Google unit, Ford Motor Co, Volkswagen AG, Daimler AG, Tesla Motors Inc and General Motors Co. \nApple has reportedly held talks about investing in British automaker McLaren Technology Group, but McLaren downplayed speculation that Apple had proposed an investment. \nApple joins a range of automakers and tech companies that have raised concerns about the proposed National Highway Traffic Safety Administration policy on self-driving cars, and plans by California state regulators to make complying with the safety assessment mandatory. \nAn auto trade group in November urged the incoming Trump administration to conduct a \"comprehensive regulatory review\" of all regulations and actions since Sept 1, including the Obama administration's guidance on self-driving vehicles.",

      "text": "Apple Inc is wading in to the debate over regulation of self-driving cars, declaring it is excited about the potential for automated transportation and calling on U.S. regulators not to restrict testing of such vehicles.\nA five-page letter from Steve Kenner, Apple’s director of product integrity, to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is the company’s most comprehensive statement yet about its interest in self-driving vehicle technology. The Nov. 22 letter followed more than a year of industry speculation about the computer and iPhone maker’s plans for expanding into transportation.\n“The company is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation,” Kenner wrote. “Executed properly under NHTSA’s guidance, automated vehicles have the potential to greatly enhance the human experience — to prevent millions of car crashes and thousands of fatalities each year and to give mobility to those without.”\nApple urged regulators not to impose too many restrictions on testing of self-driving cars, saying “established manufacturers and new entrants should be treated equally.”\nSince software would decide what actions to take in potentially dangerous situations, Apple said certain areas need special attention. These include the implications of algorithmic decisions for the safety, mobility and legality of automated vehicles and their occupants, ensuring privacy and security in design, and the impact of the cars on employment and public spaces.\nSome analysts forecast millions of jobs will be lost once self-driving cars largely replace truck, taxi and Uber drivers, and eliminate the need for most vehicle repairs, insurance adjusters and other functions. Apple’s letter was prompted by its heavy investment in machine learning and autonomous systems, company spokesman Tom Neumayr said in an emailed statement.\n“There are many potential applications for these technologies, including the future of transportation, so we want to work with NHTSA to help define the best practices for the industry,” he said. In September, the Obama administration proposed guidelines for the development of self-driving cars in a 15-point “safety assessment,” calling on automakers to voluntarily submit details of their systems to regulators.\nApple executives have been coy about their interest in cars. Chief Executive Tim Cook has suggested that Apple wants to move beyond integration of Apple smartphones into vehicle infotainment systems. But Apple has never confirmed reports last year that it was hiring automotive industry engineers and designers to develop a driverless electric car, or that those efforts have been sharply scaled back this year.\nOther companies pursuing self-driving cars include Alphabet Inc’s Google unit, Ford Motor Co, Volkswagen AG, Daimler AG, Tesla Motors Inc and General Motors Co. Apple has reportedly held talks about investing in British automaker McLaren Technology Group, but McLaren downplayed speculation that Apple had proposed an investment.\nApple joins a range of automakers and tech companies that have raised concerns about the proposed National Highway Traffic Safety Administration policy on self-driving cars, and plans by California state regulators to make complying with the safety assessment mandatory.\nAn auto trade group in November urged the incoming Trump administration to conduct a “comprehensive regulatory review” of all regulations and actions since Sept. 1, including the Obama administration’s guidance on self-driving vehicles.\nReuters \nThe post Apple reveals automated transportation ambition with call for relaxed regulations appeared first on Tech2 .",

These include the implications of algorithmic decisions for the safety, mobility and legality of automated vehicles and their occupants, ensuring privacy and security in design, and the impact of the cars on employment and public spaces. \nSome analysts forecast millions of jobs will be lost once self-driving cars largely replace truck, taxi and Uber drivers, and eliminate the need for most vehicle repairs, insurance adjusters and other functions. \nApple's letter was prompted by its heavy investment in machine learning and autonomous systems, company spokesman Tom Neumayr said in an emailed statement. \n\"There are many potential applications for these technologies, including the future of transportation, so we want to work with NHTSA to help define the best practices for the industry,\" he said. \nIn September, the Obama administration proposed guidelines for the development of self-driving cars in a 15-point \"safety assessment,\" calling on automakers to voluntarily submit details of their systems to regulators. \nApple executives have been coy about their interest in cars. Chief Executive Tim Cook has suggested that Apple wants to move beyond integration of Apple smartphones into vehicle infotainment systems. \nBut Apple has never confirmed reports last year that it was hiring automotive industry engineers and designers to develop a driverless electric car, or that those efforts have been sharply scaled back this year. \nOther companies pursuing self-driving cars include Alphabet Inc's Google unit, Ford Motor Co, Volkswagen AG , Daimler AG, Tesla Motors Inc and General Motors Co. \nApple has reportedly held talks about investing in British automaker McLaren Technology Group, but McLaren downplayed speculation that Apple had proposed an investment. \nApple joins a range of automakers and tech companies that have raised concerns about the proposed National Highway Traffic Safety Administration policy on self-driving cars, and plans by California state regulators to make complying with the safety assessment mandatory. \nAn auto trade group in November urged the incoming Trump administration to conduct a \"comprehensive regulatory review\" of all regulations and actions since Sept. 1, including the Obama administration's guidance on self-driving vehicles.

      "text": "advertisement \nApple isn't ready to rest on its laurels and ride out the rest of 2016 just yet. \nThe iPhone maker is treating the world to an October surprise, with one more product event scheduled for Thursday at its Cupertino campus. The Apple logo is displayed at the Apple Store on Fifth Avenue in New York City on June 17, 2015. Eric Thayer / Getty Images, file \nWhile Apple is keeping mum about what it has in store, it's believed the company is gearing up to launch a slate of new MacBooks. \nThere's even a cheeky clue in the invitation that was sent to reporters and analysts: \"Hello, Again.\" Hello was the first word the Macintosh computer spoke when Steve Jobs introduced it to the world in 1984. \nHere's a look at what Apple may have in store for the MacBook family. \nMacBook Pro \nWe haven't seen a new MacBook Pro since 2012, which makes the possibility of seeing a new one on Thursday that much more exciting — and likely. \nApple said goodbye to the traditional headphone jack last month on the iPhone 7, and if leaked images are correct, they'll also be banishing another traditional feature - the row of keyboard function keys on the Mac keyboard. \nMac Rumors first reported hidden images were found in a macOS Sierra update, showing a new long, thin OLED — that's \"organic light-emitting diode\" — touchscreen display where the function keys would normally be. Apple is rumored to have named the new feature the \"magic toolbar.\" \nWhile it's unclear how the bar would work, speculation across tech blogs suggest it would contextually adapt to offer functions for whatever app a person is using. So, if you have Spotify open, it may be an easy way to pause your music or pump up the volume while you work. \nExpect 13-inch and 15-inch models, along with Touch ID capability, allowing users to easily shop and conduct their business online. \nMacBook and/or MacBook Air \nFrench website Consomac discovered three new regulatory filings in Russia for three new Macs, which has led Apple fanatics to speculate on which other model will take the third slot tomorrow. \nPatrick Moorhead, principal analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy, told NBC News he expects the laptop will likely be \"something along the form factor of the MacBook Air but called the MacBook.\" \nThat means a \"13- or 15-inch\" computer that's even thinner and more integrated than the entry level MacBook Air, which had its last refresh in March 2015, he said. One way to make it more integrated would be to ditch the older ports in favor of the smaller USB Type-C and Thunderbolt 3. \nWhile MacBooks aren't a huge driver of Apple's core business, they're extremely important to the company, Moorhead said. \n\"It's not nearly as important as the iphone and iPad, but the end-to-end user experience is so important,\" he said. \"Apple dominates in the premium space, but Windows is gaining market share,\" with releases from Microsoft, Dell and HP. \nWhatever happens, Apple is set to put the rumors to rest when the event kicks off at 1 pm. ET/10 a.m. PT on Thursday. Alyssa Newcomb",

      "text": "View photos\nThe logo of Apple is seen at a store in Zurich, Switzerland November 22, 2016. REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann More By David Shepardson\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Apple Inc is wading in to the debate over regulation of self-driving cars, declaring it is excited about the potential for automated transportation and calling on U.S. regulators not to restrict testing of such vehicles.\nA five-page letter from Steve Kenner, Apple's director of product integrity, to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is the company's most comprehensive statement yet about its interest in self-driving vehicle technology. The Nov. 22 letter followed more than a year of industry speculation about the computer and iPhone maker's plans for expanding into transportation.\n\"The company is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation,\" Kenner wrote.\n\"Executed properly under NHTSA's guidance, automated vehicles have the potential to greatly enhance the human experience — to prevent millions of car crashes and thousands of fatalities each year and to give mobility to those without.\"\nApple urged regulators not to impose too many restrictions on testing of self-driving cars, saying \"established manufacturers and new entrants should be treated equally.\"\nSince software would decide what actions to take in potentially dangerous situations, Apple said certain areas need special attention. These include the implications of algorithmic decisions for the safety, mobility and legality of automated vehicles and their occupants, ensuring privacy and security in design, and the impact of the cars on employment and public spaces.\nSome analysts forecast millions of jobs will be lost once self-driving cars largely replace truck, taxi and Uber drivers, and eliminate the need for most vehicle repairs, insurance adjusters and other functions.\nApple's letter was prompted by its heavy investment in machine learning and autonomous systems, company spokesman Tom Neumayr said in an emailed statement.\n\"There are many potential applications for these technologies, including the future of transportation, so we want to work with NHTSA to help define the best practices for the industry,\" he said.\nIn September, the Obama administration proposed guidelines for the development of self-driving cars in a 15-point \"safety assessment,\" calling on automakers to voluntarily submit details of their systems to regulators.\nApple executives have been coy about their interest in cars. Chief Executive Tim Cook has suggested that Apple wants to move beyond integration of Apple smartphones into vehicle infotainment systems.\nBut Apple has never confirmed reports last year that it was hiring automotive industry engineers and designers to develop a driverless electric car, or that those efforts have been sharply scaled back this year.\nOther companies pursuing self-driving cars include Alphabet Inc's Google unit, Ford Motor Co, Volkswagen AG, Daimler AG, Tesla Motors Inc and General Motors Co.\nApple has reportedly held talks about investing in British automaker McLaren Technology Group, but McLaren downplayed speculation that Apple had proposed an investment.\nApple joins a range of automakers and tech companies that have raised concerns about the proposed National Highway Traffic Safety Administration policy on self-driving cars, and plans by California state regulators to make complying with the safety assessment mandatory.\nAn auto trade group in November urged the incoming Trump administration to conduct a \"comprehensive regulatory review\" of all regulations and actions since Sept. 1, including the Obama administration's guidance on self-driving vehicles.\n(Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Richard Chang)",

      "text": "UPS testing drones for package deliveries to remote locations \nSince Apple Maps launched, the company has improved the app by more quickly updating data, adding a mode for navigating public transit systems, improving search results, and opening the platform to outside services such as Uber ride-hailing and OpenTable restaurant reservations. The drone initiative is a continuation of this effort and is unlikely to be related to a commercial Apple drone product. \nApple filed for an exemption on Sept. 21, 2015, from the Federal Aviation Administration to fly drones for commercial purposes, according to documents obtained by Bloomberg News. At that time, exemptions were required to commercially operate drones. In a response dated March 22, 2016, the FAA granted Apple approval to “operate an unmanned aircraft system to conduct data collection, photography, and videography,” according to one of the documents. \nApple’s application told the FAA that it would use a range of drones sold by companies such as SZ DJI Technology Co. and Aibotix to collect the data. \nOfficial guidelines for commercial drone operation were instated in August, restricting flying to mostly daytime hours and requiring licensed pilots to operate the equipment while keeping the drones in their line of sight. Apple committed to these guidelines, according to the FAA documents. \nThe current rules restrict commercial drones from flying over people and buildings, potentially limiting Apple’s initiative for the time being. Apple, meanwhile, could fly the drones in the U.S. within FAA guidelines and fly without restriction in countries without commercial drone regulations. \nApple has hired at least one person from Amazon.com Inc.’s Prime Air division to help run the drone team, one of the people said. Prime Air is Amazon’s initiative to quickly deliver packages via drones. The Apple team is being assembled in Seattle, the same city as Amazon’s headquarters, the person said. \nBeyond better data collection, Apple is developing an indoor mapping view that would allow users to navigate airports, and other high-traffic buildings like museums using iPhones, according to another person. \nApple acquired startup Indoor.io last year to help bring its indoor mapping project to market, according to another person familiar with the matter. Apple confirmed the purchase, but declined to say why it did the deal. The company also bought WiFiSlam in 2013, another startup with indoor navigation expertise. \nIndoor location tracking is achieved via a combination of technologies inside the latest iPhones, including pressure sensors, GPS, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth. Apple is also working on a feature that provides better guidance for changing lanes while driving, one of the people said. Both features are planned for release next year but could be held back, the person said. Tags:",

      "text": "News in brief ANZ could offer mortgages through Apple Pay \nAustralian bank ANZ has announced it is working with Apple to deliver a wider range of financial products, including mortgages, through Apple Pay, the Sydney Morning Herald reports . “What we’re seeing is a much higher propensity for people who’ve come to us with an Apple Pay solution to then go on and expand that relationship with us,” bank chief Shayne Elliott says. The news comes a day after other Australian banks suffered a setback over their long-running demands for access to the NFC technology within iPhones.

      "text": "Apple offering refunds for purchase of faulty products By Mark Jones, Komando.com photo courtesy of shutterstock \nIt was a big year for Apple fans. The tech giant updated several of its products, including the iPhone with the 7 and 7 Plus. The Macbook Pro even got a much-needed refresh after a long four-year wait. \nIt wasn't all good news for Apple though. Certain iPhone 6S batteries were found to be defective, forcing Apple to replace them for free . Now, some of Apple's older iMacs are causing problems. \nIt turns out that a display hinge on some iMac models is breaking. Once the hinge breaks, the display leans forward and can't be adjusted. Fixing this problem costs around $100. \nThere is some good news. MacRumors was able to get a hold of an internally distributed service document given to Apple authorized service providers. The document says Apple will give refunds to customers who previously paid for the repair or replacement of the bad hinge. Affected models \nAccording to Apple's service document, 27-inch iMacs that were shipped between December 2012 and July 2014 could be affected. Several users have complained about the hinge problem in Apple's Support Communities. Most affected users say they hear a popping, or cracking noise just before the display tilts. \nWatch this video to see what's going on: \nIt appears that the affected iMacs have plastic washers within the hinge support system. Most likely, those washers aren't durable enough to support the display's weight. The sound users are hearing is when the washers break. What you should do \nIf you own one of these iMacs and experienced the issue with the broken hinge, you should contact Apple immediately. If you already had the problem fixed, contact Apple and they should refund your money as long as you have a receipt. \nIf you still have a broken hinge, book an appointment at an Apple Store to have it checked out. If you're not near an Apple Store, you can take it to an Apple authorized service provider. They will look at your computer and verify that it qualifies for the repair program.

      "text": "Dave Greenbaum | December 3, 2016 in deals \nThis week’s free app is the kid’s makeup and hair styling game Toca Hair Salon 2 . Normally it’s $3, but you can get it free from iTunes until Thursday, December 8th. What Is It? \nUnless you’re interested in becoming a hairstylist, this app is just for the kids. After the player picks a model, the styling can begin. From there, the character can get a complete makeover. \nFirst, the player starts with the haircut and then moves on to styling and color. Eventually, the character gets some fun accessories like glasses and a hat. When the model is ready to go, the app lets you take a snapshot to show off your creation. \nSadly the models aren’t very diverse. Toca gives the player six different models to choose from with unclear ethnicity. You can change the hair color, but not the skin tone. While I’m against in-app purchases for kids games, in this case, it might be nice to buy some new characters. Who Is It Good For? \nObviously, this is a kids app. I’d say it’s targeted towards the preschool and grade school crowd. The player needs to understand the concepts of scissors and a comb, but that’s about all they need. There’s no action here; it is all about creativity. With all the options, the end results can get silly and fun. Should You Download It? \nThe app loads fine on my iPhone 5s. It’s less than 100 MB, so it doesn’t take up much space. I’ll keep this one on the iPhone for those times a youngster needs a coloring book. This app should satisfy some of their creative urges.

Business Insider has affiliate partnerships, so we may get a share of the revenue from your purchase.\nKeep an eye out for this sticker when you're buying tech accessories for any Apple products. Brandt Ranj / Business Insider\nIf you've been buying accessories for your iPad or iPhone, you may have noticed that some of them have the words \"MFi Certified\" in their title.\nMFi stands for Made For iPod, iPhone and iPad; it's a certification program that was originally started in 2005 for iPod docks and cables.\nIn the past decade, it has grown to include speakers and smart home devices as well. Once certified, MFi products are guaranteed to be compatible with Apple's products. But not all accessory makers join the program.\nThe reason why is because joining the MFi program requires the company to apply for a license, which it has to pay for. The benefits are guaranteed compatibility and being able to put an MFi tag on their product boxes. But in a market like cables where profit margins are razor thin, it can be seen as an unnecessary expense. Larger companies can afford to pay the licensing fee and keep their prices low, but there are a bunch of uncertified accessories out there.\nI recently learned why it's important to spend the extra couple of bucks for MFi products when I went to buy a pack of Lightning cables that wasn't certified. When I plugged them into my power adapter, my phone would charge for a minute before flashing the \"This cable or accessory is not certified and may not work reliably with this iPhone\" message and stopping charging altogether. The price on the cables was great, but I ended up having to throw them away. I bought a certified cable from AmazonBasics , and it's worked reliably.\nNot all iDevice accessories need to go through certification, only those that use an Apple-exclusive technology. For example, Bluetooth is an open standard, so Bluetooth headphones and speakers wouldn't need to be certified to be compatible with your devices. Docks and headphones that use the Lightning connector, though, would need to be certified, since that port was created by Apple. This is going to be more important going forward, now that new iPhones don't have the standard headphone port.\nThe next time you're accessory shopping, keep an eye out for MFi certified products. They're typically a couple of bucks more expensive, but they won't give you any compatibility issues. That goes double for headphones; the market for Lightning headphones is about to explode, and nobody wants to plug in a pair and get an error message.\nBrands like Anker , Monoprice and AmazonBasics all sell MFi-certified accessories, so you can buy their stuff with confidence.\nDisclosure: This post is brought to you by Business Insider's Insider Picks team.

      "text": "Apple shows ambition to get into self-driving car race Reuters 3 hrs ago By David Shepardson © REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann Logo of Apple is seen at a store in Zurich Apple Inc (AAPL.O) is wading in to the debate over regulation of self-driving cars, declaring it is excited about the potential for automated transportation and calling on U.S. regulators not to restrict testing of such vehicles.\nA five-page letter from Steve Kenner, Apple's director of product integrity, to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is the company's most comprehensive statement yet about its interest in self-driving vehicle technology. The Nov. 22 letter followed more than a year of industry speculation about the computer and iPhone maker's plans for expanding into transportation.\n\"The company is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation,\" Kenner wrote.\n\"Executed properly under NHTSA's guidance, automated vehicles have the potential to greatly enhance the human experience — to prevent millions of car crashes and thousands of fatalities each year and to give mobility to those without.\"\nApple urged regulators not to impose too many restrictions on testing of self-driving cars, saying \"established manufacturers and new entrants should be treated equally.\"\nSince software would decide what actions to take in potentially dangerous situations, Apple said certain areas need special attention. These include the implications of algorithmic decisions for the safety, mobility and legality of automated vehicles and their occupants, ensuring privacy and security in design, and the impact of the cars on employment and public spaces.\nSome analysts forecast millions of jobs will be lost once self-driving cars largely replace truck, taxi and Uber drivers, and eliminate the need for most vehicle repairs, insurance adjusters and other functions.\nApple's letter was prompted by its heavy investment in machine learning and autonomous systems, company spokesman Tom Neumayr said in an emailed statement.\n\"There are many potential applications for these technologies, including the future of transportation, so we want to work with NHTSA to help define the best practices for the industry,\" he said.\nIn September, the Obama administration proposed guidelines for the development of self-driving cars in a 15-point \"safety assessment,\" calling on automakers to voluntarily submit details of their systems to regulators.\nApple executives have been coy about their interest in cars. Chief Executive Tim Cook has suggested that Apple wants to move beyond integration of Apple smartphones into vehicle infotainment systems.\nBut Apple has never confirmed reports last year that it was hiring automotive industry engineers and designers to develop a driverless electric car, or that those efforts have been sharply scaled back this year.\nOther companies pursuing self-driving cars include Alphabet Inc's Google unit (GOOGL.O), Ford Motor Co (F.N), Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE), Daimler AG (DAIGn.DE), Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA.O) and General Motors Co (GM.N).\nApple has reportedly held talks about investing in British automaker McLaren Technology Group, but McLaren downplayed speculation that Apple had proposed an investment.\nApple joins a range of automakers and tech companies that have raised concerns about the proposed National Highway Traffic Safety Administration policy on self-driving cars, and plans by California state regulators to make complying with the safety assessment mandatory.\nAn auto trade group in November urged the incoming Trump administration to conduct a \"comprehensive regulatory review\" of all regulations and actions since Sept. 1, including the Obama administration's guidance on self-driving vehicles.\n(Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Richard Chang)\nGo to MSN Home",

      "text": "Home / News / Apple’s ambitious autonomous vehicle project sets into motion Apple’s ambitious autonomous vehicle project sets into motion December 4, 2016 News , Technology Leave a comment \nApple has revealed it is investing heavily in autonomous vehicles in a letter asking the government to make it easier to develop self-driving cars. \nThe company is “excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation,” Apple said in a November 22 letter to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration offering Apple’s opinion about draft regulations for the sector. \n“Apple looks forward to collaborating with NHTSA and other stakeholders so that the significant societal benefits of automated vehicles can be realized safely, responsibly, and expeditiously,” the company’s director of product integrity Steve Kenner wrote. \nApple issued the letter because it is “investing heavily in machine learning and autonomous systems,” an Apple spokesman said in an email to AFP. \n“There are many potential applications for these technologies, including the future of transportation, so we want to work with NHTSA to help define the best practices for the industry.” \nRumors about Apple’s ambitions in the sector have circulated for years. \nThe company has a separate organization called “Project Titan” that is developing automotive projects. \nAlthough Apple has never officially confirmed the project, several of CEO Tim Cook’s comments have fueled speculation. \nAfter a $1 billion investment in a Chinese ride-hailing service called Didi Chuxing, he spoke of “some strategic things that the companies can do together over time.” \nHowever, in early September, The New York Times reported that the group had narrowed its ambitions, laying off dozens of staff as part of the project’s “reboot.” \nInstead of designing and producing a complete self-driving car, the group will now concentrate on developing underlying technologies for autonomous vehicles. \nIn its letter, Apple urges the NHTSA not to penalize new participants in the sector by restricting the testing of cars under development on public roads, for which established automakers generally have exemptions. \n“To maximize the safety benefits of automated vehicles, encourage innovation, and promote fair competition, established manufacturers and new entrants should be treated equally,” it says. \nApple also encourages data sharing, particularly for accidents, saying that would enable the industry to “build a more comprehensive dataset than any one company could create alone.” \nMost major auto manufacturers and many technology groups are currently developing autonomous vehicles, considered to be the future of the automobile, along with electric power, with first production models promised for around 2020. \nPTI",

      "text": "Tweet \nWe've known (or at least believed) for some time that Apple has been working on some form of automated vehicle, but the company has remained tight-lipped about what it is up to. Now, however, a letter to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) gives the strongest official hint that Apple is working on something. \nThe letter -- written by Apple's Director of Product Integrity, Steve Kenner, back in November -- has just come to light, and it Apple praises NHTSA's policies on automated vehicles, and stresses the importance of machine learning, data sharing, and user privacy in ensuring the development and safety of such technologies. \nWhile Kenner does not go quite as far as saying outright that Apple is working on an automated car, the letter drops very strong hints to that effect. The level of concern the company shows about policies relating to automated cars would also be rather strange if it did not have a vested interest in the field. \nWriting in response to the NHTSA's proposed Federal Automated Vehicles Policy, Kenner says : \nApple uses machine learning to make its products and services smarter, more intuitive, and more personal. The company is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation. \nExecuted properly under NHTSA's guidance, automated vehicles have the potential to greatly enhance the human experience -- to prevent millions of car crashes and thousands of fatalities each year and to give mobility to those without. It is vital that those developing and deploying automated vehicles follow rigorous safety principles in design and production. Such principles should not, however, inhibit companies from making consequential progress; there is no need to compromise safety or innovation. \nIt's not clear exactly what Apple has in mind, but it's possible that a fully-automated car might not be on the cards just yet. There is an interest footnote to the letter which defines automated vehicles as \"vehicles equipped with one or more systems that automate all or part of the driving task\". \nApple points out that safety is a major concern not only for manufacturers of such vehicles, but also for the public if they are ever to be widely accepted -- something which has been thrown into the headlines with recent automated vehicle crashes and near-misses. The company is keen for firms working in the field to share data with a view to driving progress, but recognizes that there are privacy and ethics concerns surrounding this. \nKenner writes: \nApple agrees that companies should share de-identified scenario and dynamics data from crashes and near-misses. Data should be sufficient to reconstruct the event, including time-series of vehicle kinematics and characteristics of the roadway and objects. By sharing data, the industry will build a more comprehensive dataset than any one company could create alone. \nThis will allow everyone in the industry to design systems to better detect and respond to the broadest set of nominal and edge-case scenarios. Apple looks forward to collaborating with other stakeholders to define the specific data that should be shared. \nData sharing should not come at the cost of privacy. Apple believes that companies should invest the resources necessary to protect individuals' fundamental right to privacy. \nWe're not really any closer to understanding what Apple is working on. Rather than creating a complete vehicle, it is possible that the company is more concerned with creating the software and ecosystem that will be used in other vehicles; only time will tell. What we do know, however, is that Apple is extremely interested in automation and definitely wants a slice of that pie.",

Are you a techie who knows how to write? Then join our Team! Especially wanted: German-English-Translator - Details here Apple's rumored order (reported by the Chinese edition of the WSJ) this April of 100 million OLED panels from Samsung for delivery in 2017-2018 seems to have spooked the leading Chinese vendors into action. As a result, Chinese smartphone vendors Huawei, Oppo, Vivo, and BBK are working together with Royole, specialist in thin, flexible panels, to secure a new OLED supply chain in China. The leading suppliers of OLED displays are currently Samsung and LG. However, it seems that Samsung won the rumored exclusive contract from Apple to supply their OLED panels, according to the Financial Times. The sheer volume of displays ordered by Apple are worrying for other vendors who are afraid they might not get their share of the OLED pie. To put things in perspective, Royole hopes to achieve a production volume of 45,000 units per month in 2017-18. Samsung's monthly OLED panel production is reportedly already around 9 million units. If Apple is the exclusive recipient of Samsung's OLED manufacturing capacity, it will likely cause an industry-wide supply crunch around 2018-2020, when OLED adoption by Apple is expected to hit full swing.

      "text": "Some MacBook Pro Users Are Seeing Poor Battery Life  12 PST \nWith the new MacBook Pros , Apple is boasting that users should be able to get about 10 hours worth of battery life out of the laptop. Unfortunately it seems that there are some users who aren’t exactly getting those speeds. According to a report from the MacRumors forums (via MacRumors ), users are claiming that they are seeing 3-6 hours instead. \nOne user by the name of SRTM says , “Currently I’m powering a 1080p external monitor and casually browsing with Chrome. At full charge, I’m getting an estimate of 3 hours battery life. With gaming it’s even less.” Another user who goes by Aioriya claims , “I bought a maxed out 13-inch Touch Bar model and I’ve been using it for about a week. With light use, I’ve been consistently getting around 5-6.5 hours when mainly browsing. Apple claims 10 hours wireless web but my battery has never lasted this long.” \nClearly these are nowhere near the advertised battery life. Now there are many reasons why battery life varies from user to user, but with quite a few users complaining that they are getting far below what’s advertised, it does seem that there should be some cause for concern. However this seems to be a different story where reviews of the laptops have found that they do indeed come close to the advertised battery life. \nLike we said, it does vary from user to user and your settings and what you do with the laptop, but hopefully it is nothing major. Any of our readers with the new MacBook Pros also experiencing lower than expected battery? \nFiled in Apple > Computers . Read more about laptops and Macbook Pro . Related Articles",

      "title": "Apple Faces a Catch-22 in its Maps and Cloud Battle with Google",
      "text": "Apple Faces a Catch-22 in its Maps and Cloud Battle with Google By aapl \nFive years after launching Siri and iCloud, and four years after launching Apple Maps, it isn't clear that Apple ( AAPL ) has significantly narrowed Alphabet /Google's ( GOOGL ) cloud services edge. But far from throwing in the towel, Apple appears intent on spending heavily take on the world's biggest Internet services firm. And given the competitive landscape Apple is dealing with, it might have no choice but to keep fighting, regardless of how low the odds of victory are. \nBloomberg reported on Thursday Apple is looking to improve Apple Maps by \"assembling a team of robotics and data-collection experts that will use drones to capture and update map information\" faster than its minivans are able to. The drones will reportedly \"do things like examine street signs, track changes to roads and monitor if areas are under construction.\" That is, provided current FAA regulations preventing drones from flying over people and buildings don't get in the way. \nIn addition, Apple is said to be developing an indoor mapping view for high-traffic locales such as airports and museums. The company plans to leverage its 2015 acquisition of mapping startup Indoor.io to bring the feature to market; Apple has also bought several other mapping-related firms in recent years, including Wi-Fi indoor positioning startup WiFiSlam and commercial mapping services provider BroadMap. \nThe efforts should be well-received by Apple Maps users, as well as by the various iOS developers who have embedded the service within their apps. But for all the strides it has made since its messy 2012 launch, Apple Maps still feels less advanced than Google Maps in several respects, and it's unlikely the drone and indoor mapping efforts will change that. Google Maps already provides indoor maps for many locations, as well as Street View-like 360-degree views of many businesses. \nAnd while Google doesn't appear to be using drones yet to provide mapping data, it is able to leverage the anonymized, crowdsourced, location data of Google Maps users to provide very accurate traffic information in most regions. If it wishes, Google can also leverage the crowdsourced data provided by mapping app Waze, which it bought in 2014 for $966 million, to strengthen various Google Maps features. \nApple can turn to crowdsourced data as well, but with Google Maps claiming over 1 billion monthly active users, the search giant clearly has an edge here, as well as in obtaining data on user activity to optimize its mapping app's features. In February, research firm comScore estimated Apple Maps had just a 28.2% reach among U.S. smartphone users to Google Maps' 47.8%, even though 43.9% of U.S. smartphone users relied on an iPhone. Globally, the iPhone claims an estimated 14% of smartphone shipments to Android's 85%; Google Maps is pre-installed on most Android phones outside of China, while Apple Maps naturally isn't available on them. \nAs with mapping, AI-powered assistant services are an area where Google's big historical investments, larger user base and superior data (in this case partly delivered by other Google services such as search and Gmail) provide an edge. While reviewers of the new Google Assistant service (an outgrowth of the older Google Now service have some complaints, most of them deem it superior to Siri. That includes long-time Apple fan Walt Mossberg, who prior to the Assistant launch wrote a column titled \"Why does Siri seem so dumb?\". \nMeanwhile, in the realm of cloud storage and file-syncing, the complexity and feature limitations of Apple's iCloud have led to unfavorable comparisons relative to rival offerings from the likes of Google, Microsoft and Dropbox. And looking at cloud photo storage in particular, Google Photos has stolen a march on iCloud and others by providing unlimited photo/video storage and using its AI expertise to automatically tag photos based on their contents. \nLast but not least, one can't escape the fact that cloud services need to support multiple software platforms to provide an optimal experience for any user relying on more than one company's platform. That's an issue for Apple, for whom creating apps and services for its own hardware has always taken priority. Apple Maps and Siri are only found on Apple devices; iCloud has a measure of Windows support, but doesn't have an Android app. \nGiven all of this, why doesn't Apple just swallow its pride and let Google handle things like mapping and voice assistant services? The most common argument -- that Apple needs to offer its own services to differentiate its hardware -- is questionable. If Apple Maps, Siri and iCloud didn't exist, Apple could still differentiate via iOS and its app ecosystem, not to mention its hardware and chip engineering. It's safe to assume that Apple Maps and iCloud aren't high on the list of reasons most users choose to buy an iPhone or iPad. \nBut there's a second reason: Google isn't just an Internet/cloud services provider, but also Apple's biggest mobile rival thanks to its ownership of Android, and (thanks to its Pixel line) also now a direct smartphone competitor. Letting Google control most of the default/pre-installed services that come with an iOS device would both make Apple dependent on its top rival for a slew of heavily-used features and provide Google with a lot of data about Apple's customers that it could use to improve its own hardware and software. \nThus, while Apple could conceivably work with third parties such as Amazon or Dropbox to outsource certain cloud services, or to at least give iOS users multiple options for a default service, working with Google is likely a non-starter. That presents quite a dilemma in fields where Google offers the best available service, one that's unlikely to go away. Get an email alert each time I write an article for Real Money.

      "text": "Discuss: ! \nWe've known (or at least believed) for some time that Apple has been working on some form of automated vehicle, but the company has remained tight-lipped about what it is up to. Now, however, a letter to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) gives the strongest official hint that Apple is working on something. \nThe letter -- written by Apple's Director of Product Integrity, Steve Kenner, back in November -- has just come to light, and it Apple praises NHTSA's policies on automated vehicles, and stresses the importance of machine learning, data sharing, and user privacy in ensuring the development and safety of such technologies. \nWhile Kenner does not go quite as far as saying outright that Apple is working on an automated car, the letter drops very strong hints to that effect. The level of concern the company shows about policies relating to automated cars would also be rather strange if it did not have a vested interest in the field. \nWriting in response to the NHTSA's proposed Federal Automated Vehicles Policy, Kenner says : \nApple uses machine learning to make its products and services smarter, more intuitive, and more personal. The company is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation. \nExecuted properly under NHTSA's guidance, automated vehicles have the potential to greatly enhance the human experience -- to prevent millions of car crashes and thousands of fatalities each year and to give mobility to those without. It is vital that those developing and deploying automated vehicles follow rigorous safety principles in design and production. Such principles should not, however, inhibit companies from making consequential progress; there is no need to compromise safety or innovation.  ",

Recipient's Mail:* ( For more than one recipient, type addresses seperated by comma ) Your Name:* Enter the letters from image : Apple iPhone 6 Plus original and fake \nThe number of unauthorized or fake Apple iPhones in circulation in Kerala have increased rapidly in recent times. Identifying a genuine iPhone, which is priced around Rs 50,000, is a tough task for the untrained eye. \nCustomers realize they were being duped only when their phone develops glitches. But the aftermath, when it comes to warranty, can be a tricky issue. They will be denied warranty by AppleCare centers without citing any valid reason. \nApple’s weak sales distribution network and inadequate number of authorized repair centers in India will make life tough for these defrauded customers. \nTo make matters worse, the company often chooses to plainly ignore such complaints. \nTwo types of counterfeit iPhones are available in the local market – the ones manufactured by Chinese companies that look exactly the same as Apple's flagship, and refurbished iPhones that were returned by a customer to either Apple or the seller due to technical glitches. \nPhones in the first category are the real villains. These fake iPhones are reportedly assembled at the same giant plants in China where the original ones are manufactured. \nThere are also rumors that these cloned versions are designed and produced at secret factories in Korea. Most importantly, they are sold without a receipt. The fake iPhone 6 (64GB) model comes with a price tag of around Rs 15,000. \nThese fake phones are quite similar to the original and it will be difficult to identify them by merely looking at physical features. They imitate iPhone's overall look and the entire interface as well. \nHowever, most of the replicas operate on Android instead of iOS, but a commoner may not be able to spot this difference. Moreover, these phones too come with an IMEI number and the Apple serial number just like the original. \nTechnical specifications of such fake phones can be found in the Apple official website, though the company claims that details of only the original handsets are uploaded on the site. \nThe company, however, has chose to remain silent to questions pertaining to this large security breach in their network. \nUnconfirmed reports suggest that refurbished iPhones are sold by even stores claimed to be Apple’s authorized dealers. They are the ones that have been repackaged by Apple for sale after the product has been returned or exchanged after its initial purchase. In foreign countries, they reenter the market carrying a ‘refurbished’ tag, but it is doubtful whether such norms are strictly enforced in India. \nThe customer will be in deep trouble if the phone develops issues during the warranty period. The company can easily deny warranty for physical and mechanical damage or glitches developed due to moisture formation inside the phone. \nThere is a replacement option for customers owning an iPhone 6s, but it will cost them around Rs 25,000. However, there is no way to find out whether the replacement is a new handset or a refurbished one. \nThe company has not responded to the queries regarding the counterfeit iPhones flooding the local market. \nIn the existing situation, the customers have no other option, but to try their luck with consumer courts as the last resort. But to make a complaint before a consumer forum, the customer needs to produce original purchase receipt and other supporting documents. × ",

      "text": "E-mail \nDespite Apple constantly discussing the premium user experience, their devices tend to have some kind of hardware defect which comes to fruition over time. To be fair, it’s not widespread enough to result in a mass recall but Apple is forced to offer some kind of repair solution for their products on a regular basis. The latest example is the iPhone 6s and some users have reported this model suddenly shuts down due to battery problems. According to Apple, the issue only occurs on handsets produced between September and October 2015, although this isn’t much comfort for those experiencing problems. Apple has finally acknowledged the shutdown as part of a hardware fault and launched a support page which reads: \n“We care deeply about our customers and take seriously concerns they have about their Apple products. After hearing reports from iPhone customers whose devices unexpectedly shut down, we thoroughly looked into these reports, and collected and analyzed devices. We found that a small number of iPhone 6s devices made in September and October 2015 contained a battery component that was exposed to controlled ambient air longer than it should have been before being assembled into battery packs. As a result, these batteries degrade faster than a normal battery and cause unexpected shutdowns to occur. It’s important to note, this is not a safety issue. \nTo help our customers who are experiencing this issue, we are replacing batteries in affected devices, free of charge. iPhone 6s owners can easily find out if their device is eligible by typing in their device’s serial number on the iPhone 6s Program for Unexpected Shutdown Issues web page. We apologize for any inconvenience this has caused customers. \nWe also want our customers to know that an iPhone is actually designed to shut down automatically under certain conditions, such as extremely cold temperature. To an iPhone user, some of those shutdowns might seem unexpected, but they are designed to protect the device’s electronics from low voltage. \nWe looked for any other factors that could cause an iPhone to shut down unexpectedly. After intensive investigations, no new factors have been identified. We will continue to monitor and analyze customer reports. \nWe encourage any customer who experiences an issue with an Apple product to visit an Apple Store or an Apple Authorized Service Provider, or to contact Apple Support .” \nApparently, the devices in question became faulty due to the batteries being exposed to environmental air for long periods. This is an unusual explanation and something I’ve not heard of before. Thankfully, consumers can get their faulty handsets either repaired or replaced from a local Apple store. \nImage courtesy of iMore.com .",

      "text": "Reddit \nJust when it seemed like Apple ‘s much-rumored self-driving car project was on the verge of collapse , more evidence surfaces that Cupertino still has plans in place. A recent letter from Apple to the US’s National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has been dug up, where the former writes that it is “investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation.” \nThe letter is from Apple’s Director of Product Integrity Steve Kenner (a former Ford exec) and was addressed to NHTSA chief Mark Rosekind. The main subject of the letter is Apple’s acknowledgement of the agency’s recent guidelines for autonomous car testing, along with their interest in participating and concerns over ethical and regulatory issues. \nThe two main points that Apple makes are that it feels all members of the car industry participating in autonomous driving tests should share their data on crashes in order to improve overall safety. “By sharing data, the industry will build a more comprehensive dataset than any one company could create alone,” Kenner wrote . However, data privacy should also remain a priority for the NHTSA. \nThe other issue is that Apple mentions is concerns about equal treatment for “established manufacturers and new entrants.” In other words, just because Apple and other companies may be new to the auto industry, they shouldn’t be subjected to additional regulation or testing over what traditional manufacturers go through. \nNote that there’s nothing in the letter that confirms Apple is working on an actual car at the moment, however that mention that they are interested in applying machine learning and automation to transportation means they are likely working on something related to self-driving cars. \nSeveral months back news surfaced that Apple had shifted from work on an actual vehicle to software and other technology that would power autonomous driving, possibly in cars from other manufacturers. The letter to the NHTSA could be evidence that this is still very much the case.",

      "title": "Apple Insists It Is Still Excited About A Self-Driving Car Despite Its Previous Obstacles",
      "text": "Via Flickr/Andy Ihnatko In the past, Apple has had some trouble wrapping their heads around the idea of a self-driving car. Despite their stumbles, the company is still confident it can get into the automated transportation business.\nApple has always been at the forefront of technology design, with people lining up for days for their products. But one nut they haven’t been able to crack yet is the self-driving car, although it isn’t like they haven’t tried. In September, it laid off dozens of employees who were a part of its self-driving car division, as it was looking to change directions. But it then purchased McLaren later that month, leading some to believe the iCar would end up a reality. And the company has been dropping clues about the direction they are thinking of taking.\nIn a letter from Steve Kenner, Apple’s director of product integrity, to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the company said it is all for getting into the automotive business and is excited to get started :\n\n“The company is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation. Executed properly under NHTSA’s guidance, automated vehicles have the potential to greatly enhance the human experience — to prevent millions of car crashes and thousands of fatalities each year and to give mobility to those without.”\nBut like it has done in the past, Apple noted how a self-driving car could take some time to roll out. Reuters reported the company would need to take extra precaution with safety abilities :\n\nSince software would decide what actions to take in potentially dangerous situations, Apple said certain areas need special attention. These include the “implications of algorithmic decisions” for the safety, mobility and legality of automated vehicles and their occupants, ensuring privacy and security in design, and the impact of the cars on employment and public spaces.\nBut the self-driving car may not come to the fruition for awhile, as Reuters reported Apple and other companies are still hoping for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration reviews its safety assessment further.\n(Via Reuters )",
