      "text": "See Neil Patrick as Count Olaf in new 'Unfortunate Events' teaser \nThe childhoods of the Baudelaires look anything but fun in the new trailer for Lemony Snicket’s A Series of Unfortunate Events. \nBased on Snicket’s absurdist book series, this new Netflix show follows the often miserable lives of Violet (Malina Weissman), Klaus (Louis Hynes), and baby Sunny Baudelaire as they’re passed along from one distant relative to another after their parents die. Unfortunately, the dastardly Count Olaf (Neil Patrick Harris), who is after their fortune, manages to find them each time they relocate. \n“If you’re interested in stories with happy endings, that story is streaming elsewhere,” warns Lemony Snicket (Patrick Warburton) at the beginning of the video. \nWhile the Baudelaires might be having “terrible childhoods,” fans of the book series will probably be delighted by this new trailer because it shows off Violet’s inventiveness — one of her defining traits throughout the series. The short clip also features more glimpses at the show’s take on the fourth book, The Miserable Mill. \nWatch the trailer above. \nA Series of Unfortunate Events also stars Joan Cusack, Asif Mandvi, and Alfre Woodard. The entire first season will be available Jan. 13 on Netflix. \nframeborder=”0” allowFullScreen&gt; ",

      "text": "Reddit \nConnected Mr. Bear is a toy with a light-up heart that controls what’s played on your Netflix account. What’s even creepier than this bear being able to control what you watch is its choice of TV shows. You see, as Netflix sees it, Full House (or Fuller House) is the perfect jumping-off point for a new kind of connected toy. A toy with a light-up heart – one that demands you watch Full House when it commands. \nThis is not a joke, and it certainly is not the 1st of April. Regardless of how easy it is to turn this product into a horror movie, Connected Mr. Bear is a delightful project. A group of creative folks at Netflix have created this bear’s heart as an open source project, so it’s free to make (as far as Netflix cash is concerned.) \nNetflix is making their cash from the video you’re seeing here – viral marketing at its finest. The end product is not nearly as important to Netflix as the chatter this oddity creates. It’s either this or announcing they’ve changed their prices again (which they haven’t, and we’re glad they haven’t). We’ll take a bear over that any day. \nThe bear or Mr Bear, if you prefer, was made semi-famous for the baby boomer and Generation-X crowd through Full House. If you’re forgetting how this played out, have a peek at the greatest recapper of Full House episode of all time, TheRealFullHouseReviewed dot com – that’s a link to a recap of the episode “Goodbye Mr. Bear” in which Stefanie has to give away Mr. Bear and Michelle is having none of it. \nThe Mr. Bear Netflix uses does not matter as much as the other specific components of the project. Including the bear, 7 pieces of hardware are needed. Also on the list are an antenna, battery, 3D-printed hear, IR LEDs, a “Cuddle Sensor”, and a microcontroller. If you’ve never put together your own before, this DIY project could be a good place to start. \nNetflix list of items includes the following – specifics are important! On the list is hardware from Adafruit, a hardware company that’s participated in several such several such awesome projects. The Squeeze Sensor is a “custom built sensor using conductive foam, 4” x 1.5” piece of the foam is cut from a sheet of 1” thick low density conductive foam (All-Spec Part# 749-2436).” You can use the instructions provided by Instructables for the rest of the Squeeze Sensor. \nFor the final product – we wish you luck. It’s only a matter of time before homemade stuffed bears in trench coats command us to watch Fuller House at all times. What a world we live in – how exciting!

      "text": "Courtesy of Netflix December 6, 2016 | 01:02PM PT \nNetflix has launched new version of its TV app that features video previews to help users with their viewing choices. The new app, which became available globally on select devices Tuesday, replaces static imagery with short clips custom-made for the app. \n“Video previews aren’t teasers or traditional trailers,” the company explained in a blog post. “They are specially designed video synopses that help members make faster and more confident decisions by quickly highlighting the story, characters and tone of a title.” \nNetflix previewed the new experience in a YouTube video : \nThe introduction of these preview clips is just the latest in a long list of tweaks to Netflix’s app experience. The company originally used DVD cover art for its streaming titles, but quickly realized that box covers aren’t the right visual metaphor for a streaming service. \nThat’s why in 2013, Netflix replaced its existing artwork with landscape-mode preview images, many of which were custom-generated for the service. At the time, Netflix also rolled out a new TV interface with big and bold preview images for featured shows. \nLast year, Netflix began to take this visual approach one step further. The company generated not one but six images for every show, and then pitted them against each other in A/B tests to see which image worked best . \nNetflix isn’t currently doing the same for video previews, with a spokesperson saying that the company generated one video preview for each title in its catalog. “That said, we are continuously testing to understand how to improve these previews over time,” she added. \nNetflix’s video previews are rolling out to most game consoles and Roku devices immediately, and are coming to smart TVs and other streaming devices in the coming months.

      "text": "Here’s why FX, HBO and other networks are scared of Netflix The bubble isn’t bursting share John Landgraf Frederick M. Brown/Getty Images Netflix plans to double the original series it offers to subscribers next year, equating to more than 1,000 hours of content and introducing 20 unscripted shows. Netflix is also going to spend $6 billion with the goal of making at least half of its content produced or owned by the company by the end of 2017. Netflix also intends to pursue top-tier award nominations, overtake the conversation in the TV press, and hire some of the best talent around. Netflix’s goal is clear: to dominate the television landscape, and networks like CBS, FX and ABC are terrified. At a media conference in New York on Monday, CBS president Les Moonves spoke about the company’s relationship with Netflix. Although Netflix remains a huge competitor for the network, CBS has teamed up with the streaming service to distribute its upcoming show Star Wars: Discovery globally . CBS’ sister network, The CW, recently began an exclusive partnership with Netflix — one reportedly worth $1 billion — to ensure that the streaming service held the rights to new seasons of shows like The Flash, Arrow, Supergirl and Jane the Virgin. Despite this mutually beneficial relationship, Moonves was candid in his opinions of Netflix and its influence on TV. Moonves said the proliferation of original content on Netflix led to a substantial increase in actors’ and writers’ salaries. “Netflix and Amazon have boosted actors' salaries to an astronomical place,” Moonves told the conference. CBS Moonves also said Netflix can take on projects that other networks might be interested in, but can’t afford to bet on, or don’t have room in their broadcasting schedules. Stranger Things , for example, is one of Netflix’s most popular shows, according to chief content officer Ted Sarandos, but the streaming service was one of the last destinations where creators Matt and Russ Duffer shopped the series. In fact, the brothers were rejected 19 times before coming to Netflix, at which point Sarandos and his team immediately jumped on board. “I knew it was something special,” Sarandos said at the conference. Stranger Things turned out to be a major success for the company, but even other series that don’t receive the acclaim that the company is looking for, like Will Arnett’s Flaked , usually receive a second or third season order. That’s because, according to Moonves, Netflix also acts as a distributor and can finance projects it believes will do well. Moonves confirmed that Netflix financed Star Trek: Discovery and it will air on CBS’ streaming service, All Access, for free because of that. As such, Netflix will profit off of the series as much as CBS would, even though it didn’t order the project. Netflix’s business model is clear: it not only wants to own and produce original content, but also it wants to be the one-stop destination for all of the top shows online. It’s why Netflix has invested billions of dollars in partnerships with The CW, Disney and other networks. Sarandos, the Netflix executive said the company’s goal was to become HBO faster than HBO could become Netflix. Netflix has its critics in network television. FX president John Landgraf attacked Netflix’s business model in his annual “State of TV” press tour. He told critics and reporters that Netflix’s model doesn’t allow for quality television , instead focusing on the number of shows that it can sell to investors. Landgraf predicted Netflix will start producing series to keep up with demand, sacrificing the quality that subscribers expect. “Television shows are not like cars or operating systems, and they are not best made by engineers or coders in the same assembly-line manner as consumer products which need to be of uniform size, shape and quality,” Landgraf said. Must Read FX president on Netflix competition Landgraf said that the problem with Netflix creating a series of “good” shows is that it makes it harder for audiences to discover what’s “great,” pointing to FX’s own slate of series. He said that while he can give his attention to a few series a year, he couldn’t imagine how Netflix executives were splitting their attention to make sure everything was up to par. “You could give me all the money in the world, and I still couldn't personally supervise 71 shows and give each series the attention it needed,\" Landgraf said. \"Why are they making so many shows and is it efficient? I couldn't tell you.\" He added that Netflix’s financial model just isn’t sustainable for most networks, even those with huge budgets, like HBO and Showtime. Netflix can spend millions on a single episode and not worry about it affecting the company’s overall income because its hands are in many other series and deals. Effectively, Landgraf said, Netflix has become a conglomerate of content and is dangerous to the market. “I think it would be particularly bad if anyone in one company, and I don't care what company that is, if they were able to seize a 40 or 50 or 60 percent market share in storytelling,” Landgraf said. “They can't double again and double again and double again because the entire earth's surface would be covered in Netflix shows in 20 years.” Media strategist Liam Boluk told Fast Company last year that if people studied the numbers, they’d see the rapid increase in Netflix subscribers and the amount of time they spend streaming content should be a major concern, even to giants like HBO. “Two to three years ago, the average user was watching almost 60 minutes of Netflix a day. Today, it’s nearly two hours,\" Boluk said. \"Netflix is bigger than every single cable and premium cable network in the U.S. No matter how well programmed, powerful, or profitable HBO is today, you can’t look at that scale and might and not feel the need to act soon.\" John P. Johnson/HBO In response, HBO is ramping up production on original series and ordering more than usual to combat Netflix’s growing influence. In a call with investors call in February, Time Warner said it was seeking to expand its overseas audience. Outside of the U.S., HBO is available in 50 countries. Right now, Netflix is available in 130. Netflix is also keeping up with HBO and FX in winning awards. Although HBO raked in 94 nominations at this year’s Emmys, FX and Netflix both earned 54 nominations. According to critics, Netflix’s slate of shows is on par with FX’s. Netflix is preparing to spend more on original content. It plans to have at least 60 shows premiere or return next year, including the highly anticipated Defenders series , with 20 of those shows being unscripted, reality TV programs. FX, The CW, HBO and Showtime will have far fewer. Netflix is rapidly outpacing its competitors and subscribers’ demand for its series is as strong as it has ever been. There’s a reason networks are scared of what the industry looks like under the thumb of Netflix, and other streaming services like Amazon — which recently spent $250 million to acquire the Top Gear team for The Grand Tour . A couple of years ago, Landgraf thought that “Peak TV” would happen in 2017, but streaming services like Netflix and Amazon threw off that prediction. The takeaway is simple: no one knows when Netflix’s bubble will burst. Or, perhaps a little more dramatically, if it ever will. More From Polygon ",

Last week, users finally got the ability to save shows and movies for offline viewing (take that, data overage charges!). Now, they’ll be able to experience one of the oldest facets of entertainment in a new way: previews.\nAmazingly, Netflix didn’t have trailers for most of its videos, save for original content. A new feature now will play a brief preview as you browse through the scores of television shows and movies so you can get a better idea of what you might want to watch. These aren’t standard trailers, however; instead, they’re specifically crafted “video synopses that help members make faster and more confident decisions by quickly highlighting the story, characters and tone of a title,” according to Netflix’s blog (via Reddit ).\nThe previews are currently limited to the TV streaming experience, though it should be launching on eligible devices (game consoles, Roku, etc.) in the next few weeks. Smart TV updates will go live in the coming months. Watch a video explaining the new feature below.\n",

      "text": "Netflix's Next Bet: Reality TV By Investopedia | December 6, 2016 — 3:25 PM EST \nThink shows like The Bachelor and Dancing With the Stars will remain a staple of network television while Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) will stick to providing a binger's delight of outrageous comedies and searing dramas? Think again. \nAt a meeting of the Royal Television Society on London, Netflix Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos said that \"unscripted programming\" had become a priority for the streaming network. Roughly 20 original projects are in various stages of production or pre-production, The Hollywood Reporter quotes Sarandos as saying . \nWhat types of unscripted shows Netflix has in the works isn't clear at this point. Nor is the genre entirely new to the company. Earlier this year, Netflix began airing a late-night talk show hosted by comedian Chelsea Handler. Reviews haven't been as strong as it might like -- 957 raters at IMDB give the show 6.9 of 10 stars, and Rotten Tomatoes says only 27% of its critics rate the show \"fresh\" -- yet Sarandos and team seem determined to find new unscripted shows to air. \nSo-called \"competition shows\" are likely to get most of the initial funding for unscripted fare. Sarandos highlighted one in particular, THR says: Ultimate Beastmaster from Sylvester Stallone, in which participants from six countries will be tested by an obstacle course. Plans call for different territories to be allowed to tailor each broadcast to highlight local contestants, a nod to Netflix's ongoing efforts to attract more international viewership and reach sustainable streaming profitability on a global scale. \nFor now, that's still more on an ambition than an immediate opportunity. Netflix forecasts $75 million in losses for its international streaming division in the fourth quarter. Total paid membership is expected to rise to 40.15 million from 27.44 million in last year's Q4. Netflix generally reports full-year earnings during the third week of January. \n10 stocks we like better than Netflix When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, Motley Fool Stock Advisor , has tripled the market.* \nDavid and Tom just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy right now... and Netflix wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. \nClick here to learn about these picks! \n*Stock Advisor returns as of Nov. 7, 2016",

      "text": "Netflix has become the world’s biggest source of online streaming content in part on the strength of its growing list of original programming. Since breaking ground with acclaimed original series like House of Cards and Orange is the New Black , the streaming giant has since added dozens of popular original shows like Stranger Things , Sense8 , and Bloodline . They’ve even taken part in the Marvel Cinematic Universe with shows like Marvel’s Daredevil , Luke Cage and Jessica Jones , in addition to the upcoming Iron Fist and The Defenders .\nMost of Netflix’s original programming has been limited to TV shows, until recent years; the network has also begun expanding to original movies and documentaries. The network has already released dozens of documentaries like Making a Murderer and 13th , and has also dabbled in original movies like 2015’s Beasts of No Nation . A fresh batch of Netflix original movies and docs, however, is about to debut at the upcoming Sundance Film Festival.\nNetflix unveiled its newest slate of upcoming original movies and documentaries on Monday, detailing a slew of “diverse” originals set to make their world premieres at Sundance, which begins on Jan. 19, 2017 in Park City, Utah. Chief among the releases is Burning Sands , which premieres on Netflix on March 10, 2017. The movie, directed by Gerard McMurray, tells the story of a fraternity pledge who is torn between honoring a code of silence and resisting the increasingly violent hazing practices during the frat’s “Hell Week.”\nAlso on the docket for Netflix original movies is Deidra & Laney Rob a Train , which follows two teens who start robbing trains to make ends meet after their mother ends up in jail. I Don’t Feel at Home in This World Anymore tells the story of a woman (Melanie Lynskey) and her neighbor (Elijah Wood) who get in over their heads battling back against a pack of dangerous criminals. The Discovery, which stars Jason Segel, Rooney Mara, Robert Redford, and Jesse Plemons, is “a love story set in a world where the afterlife has been scientifically proven, and as a result millions of people start taking their own lives to ‘get there.’”\nLeading the way for Netflix original documentaries hitting Sundance is the second installment of docu-series Hot Girls Wanted: Turned On, which continues to examine how the Internet and technology have disrupted and changed the way people live their sex lives and find relationships. The Mars Generation chronicles the history of Earth’s exploration of the red planet through the eyes of teens who wish to be the first to step foot on it, while Abstract: The Art of Design takes a closer look at some of the world’s most innovative designers in a variety of disciplines.\nNetflix’s newest slate of original movies and documentaries is certainly an ambitious one, especially considering that they submitted them to a field of movies as competitive as those found at Sundance. The network is clearly betting big on its own original programming, which was already vast, with this new group of content. While most of Netflix’s original shows have been hugely successful to this point, their movies and docs have been more hit-and-miss: the network is hopeful that the upcoming slate to be featured at Sundance represents a leap forward.\nSource: Netflix",

      "text": "“Weiner” Sundance Selects \nThe Academy documentary branch’s shortlist of 15 represents a diverse range of films from all over the world, representing strong political views as well as high artistry. However, this year also stands as the first HBO shutout in recent memory — perhaps because they didn’t campaign assertively. \nRivals Showtime landed three, Netflix two, and American Experience Films/PBS, Independent Lens, A&E, Amazon Studios, and ESPN each have one. Theatrical distributors Kino Lorber and Magnolia had two, with Sundance Selects, Sony Pictures Classics, Open Road, Janus Films, and The Orchard one. \nBut which will make the final five? Screeners will be sent to the entire Academy — who have more mainstream taste than this group of professional documentarians. \nFilms on similar topics could knock each other out. For example, voters could choose critics’ favorite and PGA nominee Ezra Edelman’s five-part “O.J.: Made in America” (ESPN) over either respected documentarian Raoul Peck’s “I Am Not Your Negro” (Magnolia/Independent Lens) or Ava DuVernay’s well-argued American revisonist history “13th” (Netflix) — or both. On the other hand, “O.J.: Made in America” is almost seven hours long — even if that proves to be an advantage once you watch it. But it’s hard to deny the unique film as both must-see and major accomplishment. “Fire at Sea” Kino Lorber \nBeing singular is an advantage in making the final five. Popular cinematographer Kirsten Johnson’s memoir “Cameraperson” (Janus Films) falls in this category — she’s worked with many of the filmmakers voting for her — along with Gianfranco Rosi’s Berlin Golden Bear-winner and Italian Oscar entry “Fire at Sea” (Kino Lorber) his personal exploration of the refugee crisis in Lampedusa, Keith Maitland’s rotoscoped and PGA-nominated “Tower” (Kino Lorber) and Roger Ross Williams’ PGA nominee “Life, Animated” (The Orchard/A&E), which uses animation and Disney clips to reveal the inner life of a young autistic man coming of age. \nSee more: Oscars 2017 Documentary Shortlist Predictions: Anne Thompson Weighs In With Top Picks \nOscar documentary branch voters can be tough on movies that are too successful or entertaining. This year, they left out Netflix’s “Amanda Knox” as well as HBO profiles of artists such as Nora Ephron, Mike Nichols, Robert Mapplethorpe, and the daughter-mother combo of Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds. But the voters did recognize the accomplishment of “Weiner” (Sundance Selects,/Showtime Documentary Film), where getting close to a controversial subject paid dividends that lasted through the presidential election. \nAnother disappointed filmmaker today is Dawn Porter, whose report from the abortion front lines, “Trapped” (Independent Lens), carries even more weight post-election. \nAlex Gibney’s ahead-of-the-curve cyber-warfare expose “Zero Days” (Magnolia/Showtime), shaped like a thriller, could knock out Robert Kenner’s similarly effective approach to the danger of nuclear missile warheads, “Command and Control” (American Experience Films/PBS), or Kief Davidson and Richard Ladkani’s compelling look at the high-stakes fight against elephant poachers, “The Ivory Game” (Netflix). \nThe Oscar documentary voters can also leave out major filmmakers who have been rewarded in the past, like Gibney. This year, prolific documentary brand name Werner Herzog did not make the cut yet again for volcano road movie “Into the Inferno” (Netflix), along with veteran Barbara Kopple, whose “Miss Sharon Jones!” (Starz) portrayed the soul singer as she was fighting the cancer to which she recently succumbed. \nThe documentarians did not reward rookie filmmaker Brian Oakes for his portrait of his murdered journalist friend, “Jim: The James Foley Story” (HBO Documentary Films), but did recognize the extraordinary editing job on Clay Tweel’s heart-tugger about an ALS-ridden football star, “Gleason” (Open Road/Amazon Studios) as well as the degree of difficulty for first-timer Otto Bell’s family-friendly, PGA-nominated Kazakhstan coming-of-age story, “The Eagle Huntress” (Sony Pictures Classics). \nHere’s my breakdown of the 15 into frontrunners, contenders, and long shots (in alphabetical order): “Cameraperson”",

      "text": "  TBWA’s Netflix ‘Binge Candle’ Closely Resembles a 2015 EVB Pitch Advertisement Comment \nGreat minds think alike. Or at least it would seem that way. \nLast week, trade pubs and others got a pitch regarding a cute promo tied to Netflix’s revival of Gilmore Girls, the classic CW dramedy that we never got around to watching. It was a “Binge Candle” designed to last exactly as long as the season, which consists of four 90-minute episodes. The candle therefore has four different scents, with one tied to each seasonal-themed chapter. \nYou get it, but here’s the explanatory video, which appeared on AdFreak , Creativity, Campaign, PSFK, etc.…and here’s the product itself, as seen on our desk. Note the “Stars Hollow Gazette.” (Stars Hollow is the town in which those girls named Gilmore live, we learned today.) \nThe agency behind the work was TBWA\\Chiat\\Day Los Angeles, which has been working with Netflix since at least 2015. But it seems that at least one other party came up with very similar idea. \nLast year Netflix (which just topped AdAge’s marketing A-List , btw) held a review for social media agency of record. We were aware of this because a source told us that MUH-TAY-ZIK | HOF-FER lost a portion of the business. \nHere is a screenshot of a concept developed by art director Cassia Peterson and copywriter Ashley Rutstein , both of whom worked for Boulder, CO’s EVB at the time. It was part of an ultimately unsuccessful pitch portfolio from the independent agency. \nIn this case, the show was The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, with the scents again varied by episode. But there’s an undeniable resemblance, and some parties are not too happy about that fact. \n“In this business, it’s not uncommon to see elements of your pitch work show up in someone else’s campaign. However, it’s rare, and unfortunate, to see a very distinctive and unique idea lifted wholesale out of a pitch deck and produced by another agency,” wrote EVB founder and CEO Daniel Stein . “Normally, I can shake this stuff off, but I felt like this one cut too deep and was not fair to the team that actually came up with this idea and presented to Netflix a year ago.” \nYou all know that this is, like Stein said, a fairly common accusation in the agency world. Maybe it was truly an original idea in both cases? \nA Netflix marketing representative declined to comment on the coincidence, and TBWA hasn’t officially gotten back to us yet today. Updates when they come in.",

      "text": "by Gina Carbone Pop quiz, hot shot: If you had to pick one sequence from Netflix's \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life\" to cut short, what would it be? The Stars Hollow musical? Life and Death Brigade? Return to Chilton? \"Wild\" hiking trip? Luke and Lorelai's big wedding? Would you really have picked the \"big wedding\"? 'Cause that's what got chopped. They say necessity is the mother of invention, and when Netflix made it necessary for the \"Gilmore Girls\" revival producers to rethink their epic wedding plans, Amy Sherman-Palladino and Dan Palladino invented a brilliant solution. It may even qualify as a blessing in disguise. (But don't tell Netflix that or they'll cut everyone's budgets.) \"The wedding was originally a much bigger deal,\" Sherman-Palladino told TVLine . \"The wedding was a whole shebang. And then they took money away from us. Anything that has extras in it and costumes became a production nightmare. So we had to figure out how to make this wedding satisfying without doing 'The Big Wedding.'\"However, she allowed that maybe the \"intimate\" wedding was better anyway. \"In paring all of the bells and whistles away, we get down to the crux of really what it is: It's Luke, Lorelai and Rory. And that made it intimate and gave it more feeling.\" Agreed. It was surprising to watch \"Fall\" play out and not see the big wedding, but it turned out to look and feel just about right. That said, it would've been cool to follow that perfectly intimate wedding with a big Stars Hollow event, with the entire cast from Sookie and Michel to Paris and Jess. They could've cut the musical for that. Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life NETOV TV14 2016 The Gilmore girls are back!

      "title": "New Video Previews Hope to Make it Easier to Parse Netflix’s Giant Catalog",
      "text": "Netflix's 'Pacific Heat' is an Aussie 'Archer' with Less Subversion \nTrying to find something to watch on Netflix can be overwhelming, which is why the streaming service’s latest update hopes to make that process easier. \nNetflix announced Tuesday that it’d soon be enabling short video previews on its television apps that can help people find content. \nThe videos, which are around 15 to 30 seconds long, aren’t straight advertisements. Rather, Netflix officials said they’re short “video synopses” that highlight story, look, characters, and more–basically distilling the elements of what makes a series or movie watchable, into a short amount of time. \n“As we launch more than 1,000 hours of original content next year, we know we have less than 90 seconds to capture someone’s attention and get them excited about a title — that’s why we’re introducing video previews into the TV browsing experience,” Stephen Garcia, director of product innovation for TV and Chris Jaffe, VP of product innovation, wrote in a blog post on the company’s website. \nThe global update comes less than a week after the company announced an offline mode that’ll allow its users to download some videos for unconnected streaming. \nWe’ve already seen something similar on the Netflix app, with ads for some of its original programming automatically play at the top of the screen or when you scroll over a title. The larger update is thanks to growing technologies and how, over time, people have become more comfortable with using the internet for streaming. \nThere have been attempts at helping its customers parse its large catalog before. Remember Max ? The talking head and game show host would insult you but would give you recommendations based on a series of questions. He was only available on the PS3 version of Netflix, and his recommendations were sometimes lacking when it came to quality and being able to pin down what you actually wanted to watch. \nHopefully, this new feature will make it easier to find something to watch. At the least, it’ll surprise you once an ad for a new Kevin James film accidentally starts playing, and you can’t find the remote. \nYou can watch a brief announcement video below. Share",

      "title": "Fuller House: Who Should Win DJ's Heart?",
      "text": "Fuller House is returning this month on Netflix, and one of the central threads hanging over from the show's first season is the question of who DJ ( Candace Cameron Bure ) will end up with.\nIn Season 1, DJ was stuck between Steve ( Scott Weigner ), her high school sweetheart who has carried the torch for her since they were teenagers, and Matt ( John Brotherton ), her new business partner at the veterinary clinic where she works. The final episode of the freshman season showed DJ picking herself rather than either of the men to settle down with, but they both will still be around for Season 2, making it inevitable for the love triangle to resurface.\nWho should DJ be with though? It's not just about making herself happy. She has three kids that she's raising and whoever she picks to settle down with -- whether it's Steve, Matt or someone new -- needs to be a good fit for her entire family. Before everyone has a chance to binge watch Season 2, we decided to compare the choices and weigh in on DJ's romantic future.\nScott Weinger and John Brotherton, Fuller House \" data-image-credit=\"Michael Yarish/Netflix\" data-image-alt-text=\"Candace Cameron Bure, Scott Weinger and John Brotherton, Fuller House?\" data-image-credit-url=\"\" data-image-target-url=\"\" data-image-title=\"Candace Cameron Bure, Scott Weinger and John Brotherton, Fuller House?\" data-image-filename=\"161206-news-fuller-house-candace-cameron-bure.jpg\" data-image-date-created=\"2016/12/06\" data-image-crop=\"\" data-image-crop-gravity=\"\" data-image-aspect-ratio=\"\" data-image-height=\"1380\" data-image-width=\"2070\" data-image-do-not-crop=\"\" data-image-do-not-resize=\"\" data-image-watermark=\"\" data-lightbox=\"\"> Steve\nSteve is the obvious choice for nostalgic viewers. Once upon a time, he and DJ were the perfect couple, and their breakup near the end of the original series was a tough one to watch. It was a treat to be able to see them together, but to be honest, Steve has changed a lot in the years since Full House fans first met him.\nBack in the day, Steve was a confident football player who ate everything in the Tanner fridge but was absolutely nuts about DJ. These days, that confidence seems to have diminished, and all that's left is his devotion to DJ, which bordered along unsettling in the show's first season. It was meant to be funny, but Steve had a tendency to come off as desperate which made it hard for DJ to feel their old spark (remember how awkward it was for them to make hamburgers again)?\nFuller House 's New Kids on the Block left a few cast members speechless\nSteve still has the potential to turn this around. He knows DJ better than any of the other guys she might date, but he needs to learn to chill and remember what makes him great. Unfortunately, we already know that Steve has moved on with a DJ lookalike in the sophomore season, so it might be a minute before he's able to find his groove with his old flame again.\nMatt\nMatt is the new guy on the block, and while he's definitely a stud, he wasn't without some problematic tendencies either.\nWhen DJ tried to back out of their first date with a white lie about having a dentist appointment, he called every dentist in the area to try and track DJ down. That's quite a bit extra for someone you just met, and he had the nerve to be angry at DJ for the white lie.\nThere's also the issue of working together. DJ and Matt co-run the veterinary clinic, which makes a romantic situation pretty sticky. If they break up, will DJ be out of a job since Matt's father is the one who actually owns the practice? Working together and dating is a very complicated balance, and that may be a little bit too much for DJ to take on in her first serious relationship since her husband died.\nFuller House Season 2: Is Stephanie's new love interest Kimmy's brother?\nIf Matt can prove he's capable of having a professional and personal relationship with DJ without things getting messy, he could very easily override Steve's nostalgia points to become DJ's Fuller House match.\nThe verdict\nTo be honest, DJ made the right decision by taking some time for herself. Neither Steve nor Matt were ready to be the guy she needs at the end of last season. While there's definitely room for that to change in Season 2, all the parties involved need some time to grow before they are ready to really settle into a relationship.\nThe move to keep DJ single for a prolonged period of time isn't unprecedented either. It took Danny ( Bob Saget ) a long while before he found Vicky ( Gail Edwards ), the woman who would make him truly happy after he lost his wife. DJ has a perfectly fulfilling life raising her children with Stephanie ( Jodie Sweetin ) and Kimmy ( Andrea Barber ). She shouldn't force herself to be with anyone until the absolute perfect person for her and her family shows up -- and it'll be fine if that person is Matt, Steve or someone completely new.\nWho do you think DJ should end up with?\nFuller House Season 2 premieres on Netflix on Dec. 9.\nOther Links From TVGuide.com\nFuller House",

      "text": "December 6, 2016 4:54pm \nNetflix is venturing into the unpredictable world of reality television. \nWith plans to introduce 20 unscripted television shows on the platform in 2017, chief content officer Ted Sarandos tells Variety that the Sylvester Stallone-produced Ultimate Beastmaster will be in the lineup. \nNetflix is slated to surpass 1000 hours of original content in 2017, which more than doubles the 2016 count of 500 hours. Sarandos goes on to say that Netflix will be focused on shows with an international theme. \nFurthermore, the company plans to spend approximately $6 billion USD in 2017 on a profit-and-loss basis, which is up from $5 billion in 2016. \nWith the increased focus on original content, Netflix-produced shows are likely to take up a larger portion of that budget than ever before. \nNetflix recently introduced offline viewing to its subscribers, which makes a wide variety of content available for viewing without an internet connection. This feature however, is only available on iOS and Android devices. \nNetflix currently has 30 original series and plans to double that number by the end of 2017.",

Some notable titles are leaving while some flashy titles are showing up. \nOne in particular that will get Marvel fans excited is “Captain America: Civil War.” The highest grossing film of 2016, so far, will land on your streaming devices starting Chritmas Day. Nothing like watching Iron Man and Captain America duking it out to celebrate Christmas. \nOther titles worth mentioning that are making their way to Netflix in December include “The Angry Birds Movie,”“Beverly Hills Cop,” and “The Legend of Bagger Vance.” \nSome titles heading out include “Top Gun,”“The Da Vinci Code,” and “The Boxtrolls.” \nHere’s the full list of everything coming to and going from Netflix this December: \nAdd:",

      "text": "Photo-Illustration: ABC, Netflix, HBO \nIn this age of Peak TV , is there ever truly an off-season for your favorite shows? Although the winter months in years past might’ve been filled with reruns or backburner programming, networks now consciously use the chillier season for noteworthy premieres. Below, we’ve highlighted some of the buzziest winter shows — both new and returning — that are worth keeping your eyes on, along with a full schedule for when all shows will be returning. We’ll continue to update the page as more programming information becomes available. Happy watching!\nSherlock, January 1, PBS\nBenedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman are back for a three-episode Sherlock season, which is bound to dig deeper in the ethos of a certain James Moriarty. (Not to mention a new villain played by Toby Jones .) The high-functioning sociopath shenanigans will be high, as will the number of times Mrs. Hudson yells about the state of 221B Baker Street.\nNashville, January 5, CMT\nYou did it, Nashville fans! You saved the show! The southern romp will premiere its new season on CMT, and everyone’s back for some more country music shenanigans — leading belles Hayden Panettiere and Connie Britton, first and foremost.\nTaboo, January 10, FX\nTom Hardy makes his way back to the small screen in this 19th-century period drama. Taboo follows Hardy’s character, a long-thought-deceased heir to a shipping empire, who unexpectedly returns with a vengeance to rightfully claim his father’s legacy … and money. Hardy actually created the miniseries with his father, Chips Hardy, so it surely has that extra special layer of familial authenticity.\nLemony Snicket’s A Series of Unfortunate Events, January 13, Netflix\nYour scariest childhood book series is now back to haunt you even more as an adult. Netflix is bringing the bleak visual world of A Series of Unfortunate Events to life, which follows the three Baudelaire orphans as they try to outrun — and outsmart — their evil guardian Count Olaf. Neil Patrick Harris really went all-out for the role, huh?\nHomeland, January 15, Showtime\nCarrie Mathison and her whip-smart crew are back for a sixth season of the hit drama, but this time around, Carrie’s taking a step back from international drama to work at a Brooklyn foundation that provides support for Muslims living in the U.S. The entire season will also take place between Election Day and the inauguration, as if the show's themes weren't accessible enough already.\nThe Young Pope, January 15, HBO \nThe Young Pope ? More like The Hot Pope. Jude Law stars as the first American pope, Pius XIII, who brings some holy ruckus to the Vatican after he assumes the papal mitre. Senior Vatican officials aren’t too pleased at their younger counterpart’s quick rise to the title, though, and might even try to sabotage His Holiness’ reign.\nScandal, January 19, ABC\nWelcome back, Gladiators. Shondaland’s frothy political drama is finally back after an unusually long hiatus, with season six picking up where we left off, on Election Night. Who will win the election? What could possibly go wrong in the aftermath? How many white suits will Olivia Pope wear? Only time will tell.\nRiverdale, January 26, The CW\nThis sexy, subversive Archie Comics adaptation has been described as “Archie meets Twin Peaks ,” so if you’re expecting a good ol’ fashioned children-friendly show, prepare to be surprised. Riverdale chronicles a group of high-schoolers — Betty, Veronica, and all of your favorites — as they discover the dark underbelly of their town after the murder of a classmate.\nPlanet Earth II , January 28, BBC America\nPlease allow Sir David Attenborough's smooth narration to guide you through our wonderful natural world, as the wildly popular docuseries Planet Earth is back for round two. This time, Attenborough and Co. will be teaching us about the challenges animals face in various habitats around the globe. Break out an HD TV for this one.\nGirls, February 12, HBO\nThe love-it-or-hate it dramedy returns for its farewell season , with the four ladies continuing their unique attempts to make lasting marks in the big city. They may never fully grow up, but we’ll be damned if they don’t keep trying.\nLegion , February 8, FX\nFX has been keeping coy about Legion — a.k.a. Noah Hawley's superpowered drama based on X-Men characters — which follows a man, played by Dan Stevens, who discovers there might be something more to his paranoid schizophrenia than anyone realizes. Stevens and Audrey Plaza are leading the cast, so you know it’s going to be a grand ol’ kooky time. \nCrashing , February 19, HBO\nThis Judd Apatow–produced comedy follows a fictionalized version of comedian Pete Holmes, whose life turns to shambles when his wife unexpectedly leaves him for a virile Italian boxer. A healthy mix of reflective soul-searching and crazy shenanigans with his friends ensues.\nMarvel’s Iron Fist, March 17, Netflix \nIron Fist is the latest outing from the ever-expanding Marvel Cinematic Universe, with the series following the titular superhero — real name: Danny Rand — as he returns to New York City after a mysterious, 15-year absence. He wants to reclaim ownership of his family’s company, but things quickly escalate to violent proportions, judging by the fact that he’s, you know, a superhero who fights crime with martial-arts prowess.\nThe full winter 2017 lineup: \nWednesday, December 7 \n12 a.m. Shut Eye, Hulu\n8 p.m. Hairspray Live!, NBC\nThursday, December 8 \n8 p.m. Taraji’s White Hot Holidays , Fox\nFriday, December 9 \n12 a.m. Mozart in the Jungle, Amazon\n3 a.m. Captive, Netflix\n3 a.m. Fuller House, Netflix\n3 a.m. White Rabbit Project, Netflix\nSunday, December 11 \n8 p.m. Critics’ Choice Awards, A&E\n9 p.m. The Hollow Crown: The Wars of the Roses, PBS\nMonday, December 12 \n10 p.m. America’s Next Top Model, VH1\n10 p.m. Booze Traveller, Travel\nWednesday, December 14 \n9 p.m. Star, Fox\nThursday, December 15 \n10 p.m. The Selection: Special Operations Experiment, History\nFriday, December 16 \n12 a.m. The Man in the High Castle, Amazon\n10 p.m. Paranormal Lockdown, TLC\nSunday, December 18 \n8 p.m. Rob & Chyna Baby Special, E!\nWednesday, December 20 \n8 p.m. Undercover Boss, CBS\nThursday, December 22 \n10 p.m. Project Runway Junior, Lifetime\nFriday, December 23 \n3 a.m. Trollhunters, Netflix\n3 a.m. Travelers, Netflix\nSunday, December 25 \n9 p.m. Doctor Who Christmas special, BBCA\nThursday, December 27 \n3 a.m. Chasing Cameron, Netflix\nSunday, January 1 \n8 p.m. Sherlock , PBS\n8 p.m. The Mick , Fox\n8 p.m. Ransom, CBS\n9 p.m. To Tell the Truth , ABC\nMonday, January 2 \n8 p.m. The New Celebrity Apprentice , NBC\n8 p.m. Shadowhunters , Freeform\n8 p.m. The Bachelor , ABC\n9 p.m. Beyond , Freeform\nTuesday, January 3 \n8 p.m. The Wall , NBC\n9 p.m. Bones , Fox\nWednesday, January 4 \n10 p.m. It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia , FXX\n10 p.m. Too Close to Home , TLC\n10 p.m. Match Game , ABC\n10:30 p.m. Man Seeking Woman , FXX\nThursday, January 5 \n8 p.m. Hell's Kitchen , Fox\n9 p.m. Nashville , CMT\n10 p.m. Portlandia , IFC\nFriday, January 6 \n3 a.m. One Day at a Time , Netflix\n8 p.m. Grimm , NBC\n9 p.m. Emerald City , NBC\n9 p.m. Sleepy Hollow , Fox\nTuesday, January 10 \n9 p.m. Being Mary Jane, BET\n10 p.m. Taboo , FX\nWednesday, January 11 \n8 p.m. Schitt's Creek , Pop\n10 p.m. Girlfriend's Guide to Divorce , Bravo\nThursday, January 12 \n9 p.m. My Kitchen Rules , Fox\n10 p.m. Colony , USA\nFriday, January 13 \n3 a.m. Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events , Netflix\nSunday, January 15 \n9 p.m. Homeland , Showtime\n9 p.m. Victoria , PBS\n9 p.m. The Young Pope , HBO\nTuesday, January 17 \n10 p.m. Teachers, TV Land\n10:30 p.m. Throwing Shade, TV Land\nWednesday, January 18 \n10 p.m. Six , History\nThursday, January 19 \n9 p.m. Scandal , ABC\n10 p.m. Baskets , FX\nFriday, January 20 \n3 a.m. Frontier , Netflix\nSaturday, January 21 \n8 p.m. Beaches , Lifetime\nSunday, January 22 \n8 p.m. Mercy Street, PBS\n10 p.m. Hunted , CBS\nTuesday, January 24\n9 p.m. Outsiders , WGN\nWednesday, January 25 \n12 a.m. The Path , Hulu\n9 p.m. The Magicians , Syfy\n10 p.m. Suits , USA\nThursday, January 26 \n9 p.m. Riverdale , The CW\nFriday, January 27 \n12 a.m. Z: The Beginning of Everything, Amazon\nSaturday, January 28 \n9 p.m. Planet Earth II , BBC America\nSunday, January 29 \n9 p.m. Black Sails , Starz\nTuesday, January 31 \n8 p.m. The Fosters , Freeform\n9 p.m. Switched at Birth , Freeform\n9 p.m. The Quad, BET\nWednesday, February 1 \n9 p.m. The 100 , The CW\n\nThursday, February 2 \n10 p.m. Training Day, CBS\nFriday, February 3 \n3 a.m. Santa Clarita Diet , Netflix\n\nSunday, February 5 \n10 p.m. 24: Legacy , Fox\n\nMonday, February 6 \n9 p.m. APB , Fox \n\nWednesday, February 8 \n10 p.m. The Expanse , Syfy\nTBD, Legion , FX\n\nThursday, February 9 \n8 p.m. MasterChef Junior , Fox\n\nFriday, February 10 \n9 p.m. Reign , The CW\n\nSunday, February 12 \n10 p.m. Girls , HBO\n11 p.m. Last Week Tonight With John Oliver , HBO\n\nTuesday, February 14 \n12 a.m. The Mindy Project , Hulu\nWednesday, February 15 \n10 p.m. Doubt, CBS\n\nSunday, February 19 \n9 p.m. Big Little Lies , HBO\n10 p.m. Billions , Showtime\n10:30 p.m. Crashing , HBO\n\nMonday, February 27 \n8 p.m. The Voic e, NBC\n10 p.m. Taken , NBC\nWednesday, March 8 \n8 p.m. Survivor, CBS \nFriday, March 17 \n12 a.m. Marvel's Iron Fist , Netflix\n8 p.m. The Originals , The CW\n\nWednesday, March 22 \n9 p.m. Empire , Fox\n\nWednesday, March 29 \n12 a.m. Harlots , Hulu",

      "text": "Netflix has seen success with its series such as the rebooted 'Gilmore Girls.' (Photo: Robert Voets, Netflix)\nNEW YORK — Netflix is continuing its quest to dominate television.\nWith 87 million subscribers in 190 territories, it has 30 series in production or development, and next year plans to double — to 1,000 hours — the amount of original programming, chief content officer Ted Sarandos said at the UBS Global Media conference Monday.\nIts next frontier: More unscripted programming, with 20 new shows such as Ultimate Beastmaster , an obstacle-course competition series (think American Ninja Warrior ) featuring contestants and announcers from six countries.\nExclusive series are the streaming service's top priority. Netflix is often criticized for its sometimes moldy selection of theatrical movies, but Sarandos said they still represent 30% of the service's total viewing, even with this year's addition of Disney titles, which are bypassing the typical pay-cable stop.\nBut how do subscribers actually watch? In new data shared with USA TODAY, Netflix says 59% of its members — or about 51 million — take a break, usually lasting two to three days, after finishing an original series before they dive into a new one.\nNick Wilde (voiced by Jason Bateman) meets bunny officer Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin) in Disney's 'Zootopia.' (Photo: Disney)\nAnd 61% of those who do pause weave a standalone film or standup special between those series binges, often choosing like-minded titles. So, for example, fans of the whimsical Gilmore Girls and Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt are more apt to follow them with titles such as The Princess Bride and Sixteen Candles , while Stranger Things viewers opt for Disney's Zootopia .\nViewers of Narcos or Breaking Bad go for similarly edgy Pulp Fiction, and watchers of Orange Is the New Black and Bloodline tend to watch Spotlight. (The research is based on worldwide trends from January to October).\nNetflix has a more \"dispassionate audience\" of movie fans, said Sarandos, who views Netflix's original films with Kevin James and Adam Sandler as popular if unexceptional \"comfort-food comedy.\" But expanding its film slate to more ambitious fare may achieve a loftier goal. He expects Bright , an upcoming feature shrouded in mystery that marks a new collaboration between Suicide Squad 's star Will Smith and director David Ayer, to launch a new film franchise.\n\"Can those films be subscription drivers the way series are?\" he asked.\nNeil Patrick Harris stars in Netflix's original Lemony Snicket series, 'A Series of Unfortunate Events,' which makes its debut Jan. 13. (Photo: Joe Lederer, Netflix)\nMeanwhile, upcoming series hint at Netflix's broadening slate: a second season of Fuller House (available Friday); Chasing Cameron (Dec. 27), a reality series that follows Internet star Cameron Dallas; Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events (Jan. 13); new episodes of kids series Voltron: Legendary Defender (Jan. 20); Santa Clarita Diet (Feb. 3), a new comedy starring Drew Barrymore and Timothy Olyphant as married Realtors; and the next Marvel series, Iron Fist (March 17).\n\"We're trying to make sure we have something for everyone in the house,\" Sarandos said.\n19 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 1 //usat.ly/2heghhH",

      "text": "N etflix em ploys an algorithm that helps its users discover movie options, and now it's about to help discover new planetary systems.\nResearchers at the University of Toronto Scarborough have developed a new approach to identifying stable planetary systems based on the machine learning artificial intelligence Netflix uses.\n\"Machine learning offers a powerful way to tackle a problem in astrophysics, and that's predicting whether planetary systems are stable,\" Dan Tamayo, lead author of the research and a postdoctoral fellow in the Center for Planetary Science at the University of Toronto Scarborough, said in a press release .\nWhat is machine learning? Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence that allows computers to learn new functions without being programmed. This is how Netflix can make scarily accurate predictions of what you're interested in watching without you telling it. The algorithm uses data from your previous choices to make recommendations going forward.\nNow Tamayo and his team of researchers are looking to implement the same idea in the realm of astrophysics. They will use previously collected data to predict a system's stability and determine information like a planet's mass or how elliptical its orbit is.\nWhat will this information tell us? The newly developed method is 1,000 times faster than traditional methods for predicting planetary stability, according to the release. Understanding this stability will allow scientists to assess a planet's chances of harboring life.\n\"It could be a useful tool because predicting stability would allow us to learn more about the system, from the upper limits of mass to the eccentricities of these planets,\" Tamayo said.\nHis team's complete research was published in th e Astrophysical Journal Letters . According to the press release, Tamayo's method could be used to analyze data from NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, which is set to launch next year with the mission of discovering new exoplanets close to our solar system.",

      "text": "\"JEDI JUNIOR HIGH\" — 3 stars — written and directed by Heidi Burkey and Tim Larson, TV-PG, Netflix\nHeidi Burkey and Tim Larson’s documentary is a fun mix of adolescent quirkiness, lightsaber fights and musical theater. “Jedi Junior High,” which was first released in 2014 and became available on Netflix Nov. 15, lightheartedly follows a cast of junior high students as they prepare to perform in a musical parody of the iconic film “Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back.”\nFrom auditions to opening night, the documentary captures the challenges and the triumphs of putting on a large production with children who at times still struggle to focus on simple tasks.\nThroughout the interviews with the young cast, viewers will no doubt be brought back to their own junior high days of awkwardness and self-discovery. Producing a play called \"Star Wars: The Musical\" attracted a variety of kids to auditions who displayed a range of personalities.\nShy and sweet 12-year-old Jonathan Graham, who just wished he could be a bit more popular, was ironically cast as Han Solo.\n“He’s the guy who doesn’t really care about anything,” Graham said in the film. “But for me, I feel like I’m the goody-two-shoes.”\nOn the other side of the spectrum, charismatic Alexander Ortiz has more of a Han personality, yet the 13-year-old is cast as Luke in the musical.\nThe heart of the film is not Star Wars or theater; it is young kids growing and beginning to find their place. The documentary draws a parallel between the hero’s journey Luke undertakes and the coming-of-age journey all kids experience. This analogy is underlied by the interviews of both the kids and their parents as they speak on the hardships of growing out of the safety and security of childhood to adulthood, with its ever-broadening choices and danger.\nWhile the camera work and overall quality of this documentary discloses its low-budget filming, it does not interfere with its storytelling. In this simple, small, delightful story, fancy camera work and professional moviemaking equipment is not needed to convey its messages.\nComment on this story “Jedi Junior High” is classified as a documentary, yet it could fit well into a secondary category of comedy. Audiences will surely chuckle as the young actor playing Chewbacca explains how he was forced to audition and complains about his uncomfortable costume. And it is always funny and sweet to watch the immature development of affections and crushes among groups of hormonal youths.\nWhile those who lean more towards action and excitement in their movie choices might find themselves bored midway through “Jedi Junior High,” parents and kids alike will enjoy watching the young cast’s journey tackling a big musical. Any Star Wars fan will also appreciate the frequent discourse about the franchise, along with the children’s representation of the iconic characters. Overall, “Jedi Junior High” is a lighthearted film fit for a family movie night.\n“Jedi Junior High” is rated TV-PG; running time is 74 minutes.\nMcKenna Park is an aspiring journalist and a student at BYU studying Communications.

      "text": "Glass 5 hours ago \nEarlier this year, Netflix expanded its service pretty much everywhere in the world—including regions where people access the internet primarily on mobile phones and on developing, often unreliable cellular and broadband networks. \nAs such, the streaming-video giant needed to find smarter, more efficient ways to deliver high-quality video on mobile without monopolizing subscribers’ data plans or eating up their phone storage. \nThe solution came when Netflix realized that each piece of content needed to be encoded—or compressed into versions that can be played on TVs, desktop, tablets, mobile phones, and other devices—differently to look its best. \nFor example, a fight scene in a darkened hallway on Daredevil is much more complex to encode, and requires more bandwidth to process, than a shot of a clear sky in the same episode. Ranges of light and dark also tend to trip up video codecs, or software that compresses and decompresses digital video. Animation like the Netflix kids show The Deep are normally easier to process than live-action titles. Netflix released a complicated 12-minute film noir earlier this year specifically to allow engineers to experiment with processing different types of video. \nTo account for these visual differences, the Silicon Valley company slices each and every Netflix video into one-to-three minute “chunks” that are analyzed and encoded by a computer separately, it outlined on its tech blog last week. Some pieces of an hour-long episode of Black Mirror , for example, might take up more storage space or require more data to stream than others because they require higher resolutions to look their best. \nNetflix rolled out this feature last week with an update to its mobile app that enabled offline viewing —allowing subscribers to download videos to their devices using this same technology. It also introduced new compression formats and encoding settings to make those downloads more efficient, which it detailed in the blog post. \nThe effort builds on an update that Netflix introduced last year, which customized the encoding settings for each individual title, Variety reported . It reportedly helped save up to 20% of data while delivering better quality. Read full story",

      "text": "Pushing more marketing/promotion for its TV content, Netflix is offering its own kind of TV/video promo “previews.” In a company blog, the subscription video-on-demand service said it is offering “video synopses” of story lines, characters, and program style for its TV content -- looking to make it easier for consumers to make a TV programming decision about whether to view. \n“[Netflix’s] video previews aren’t teasers or traditional trailers,” write  Stephen Garcia, director of product innovation for TV and Chris Jaffe, vp of product innovation of Netflix.  “We know we have less than 90 seconds to capture someone’s attention and get them excited about a title -- that’s why we’re introducing video previews into the TV browsing experience.” \nNetflix says these previews launch globally on Tuesday, becoming available on all eligible devices over the next few weeks. This includes many game consoles and Roku devices, and smart TVs. \nNetflix has 30 original scripted TV shows on its service, and will double its overall programming output to total more than 1,000 programming hours. It also has plans for 20 unscripted shows. \nNetflix plans to spend about $6 billion in 2017 on content --up from $5 billion in 2016. \nFor decades, traditional TV networks have used their own airwaves for on-air TV show promotion to drive much of their tune-in. Current TV ratings erosion has made this a tougher task.",

      "text": "Netflix launches video previews to help find the content you want to watch Another cool new Netflix feature has arrived on Dec 6, 2016, 3:30 PM TechSpot \nAssuming you don’t live in the UK, where the selection is pretty limited, there may be times when you can’t decide what show or movies to watch from Netflix's library. To help find something enjoyable within all that content, the streaming service is introducing a new “video previews” feature for its TV app. \nRolling out worldwide today, the updated app will appear on certain game consoles and Roku devices first, with smart TVs and other platforms getting updated in the coming months. The company emphasizes that the previews aren’t traditional trailers or teasers; rather, “they are specially designed video synopses that help members make faster and more confident decisions by quickly highlighting the story, characters, and tone of a title,” the company said. \nStephen Garcia, director of product innovation for TV, and Chris Jaffe, VP of product innovation, wrote in a blog post that Netflix is launching more than 1000 hours of original content next year. “We know we have less than 90 seconds to capture someone’s attention and get them excited about a title — that’s why we’re introducing video previews into the TV browsing experience.\" \nThe news arrives just one week after Netflix introduced the long-requested offline playback ability for many streaming series and movies; something that executives only two years ago said was “never going to happen.” \nVentureBeat notes that the new interface is designed for big screens as the menu options and video preview must appear together, which is why the feature isn’t being introduced to the mobile or tablet apps.

      "text": "Netflix Introduces Video Previews to Help You Decide What to Watch Indecisiveness, be gone! Twitter Orange is the New Black \nLast week, Netflix presented us with the greatest holiday gift of all: The ability to download movies and TV shows from the streaming service in order to watch without an internet connection. And today, we've learned that site is still doing their best to improve our lives. Say goodbye to endless browsing for a new show: Netflix announced Tuesday that they've introduced video previews for their content in order to help you decide what to watch. \nThe previews, which launch globally today and will be rolled out to devices that are Netflix-enabled over the next few weeks, aren't just your average trailer. According to a blog post on Netflix's site, they're specially formulated, 90-second synopses that are designed to give users a sense of the story, characters, and tone of a movie or show. These previews can be viewed from the browsing screen for optimal convenience. \nNetflix tweeted out this helpful video that explains what the previews are about and further affirms that they just get us: https://twitter.com/netflix/status/806151007403212800?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw \nStephen Garcia, director of product innovation for TV, and Chris Jaffe, VP of product innovation, said in a statement that these previews have been in the works for a while now, but until recently, the technology to offer the type of video they hoped for didn't exist. \n\"This is our latest effort to continually evolve the Internet TV experience to one that provides greater choice, richer imagery, better context, and a more consumer-friendly experience,\" Garcia and Jaffe said. \"When we launched streaming back in 2007, we were mostly trying to figure out what this new medium could be and how best to present it. Over the last decade, investments in how content is delivered globally, optimizing our streams for bandwidth-constrained environments, and the evolution of consumer tastes allows us to experiment with new ways to improve your experience.\" \nThe announcement also mentions that over the next year, Netflix will roll out more than 1,000 hours of original content next year, so it sounds like these previews are going to come in handy. Now BRB, we're going to go pick out tonight's Netflix feature real quick.",

      "text": "Much like previous promos before it, today’s new trailer for Netflix’s A Series of Unfortunate Events begins with a warning: “If you are interested in a story with a happy ending, that story is streaming elsewhere.” Those of you familiar with the Baudelaire saga will likely agree, of course – what with its whimsical cruelty and the seemingly unending sense of hopelessness, Daniel Handler’s novel series is a far cry from a warm and fuzzy feel-good hit.\nBut rather than shy away from the bleak, morose tone, Netflix has embraced A Series of Unfortunate Events with two open arms, engineering a quirky new original series that welcomes Neil Patrick Harris as the dreaded Count Olaf. For a character who has seemingly endured a torrid childhood, Harris’ ghastly nemesis makes no bones about making the lives of his newly adopted children – Violet (Malina Weissman), Klaus (Louis Hynes), and baby Sunny – miserable from the get-go, ordering them to work in an industrial factory from no age.\nIt’s all part of his wicked plan to steal the family inheritance, and though Netflix’s marketing spiel is consistently warning us to avert our gaze – in a meta, reverse psychology kinda way – we can’t wait to see how the show unfolds.\nLemony Snicket’s A Series of Unfortunate Events will be told across eight episodes in total, all of which will premiere via Netflix on January 13. Also on board are Patrick Warburton (Lemony Snicket), Alfre Woodard (Aunt Josephine), Catherine O’Hara (Dr. Orwell), K. Todd Freeman (Mr. Poe) and Aasif Maandvi (Uncle Monty).\n\nBased on the internationally best-selling series of books by Lemony Snicket (aka Daniel Handler) and starring Emmy and Tony Award winner Neil Patrick Harris, A Series of Unfortunate Events recounts the tragic tale of the Baudelaire orphans — Violet, Klaus, and Sunny – whose evil guardian Count Olaf will stop at nothing to get his hands on their inheritance. The siblings must outsmart Olaf at every turn, foiling his many devious plans and disguises, in order to discover clues to their parents’ mysterious death.\n",

      "text": "2 minutes ago timujin : Tchernobog: I find myself watching Netflix less and less. Considering cancelling. The quality of content is basically garbage. Sure, they have thousands of movies to choose from, but 95% of them are z-list dogshiat. Hulu seems to have picked up a lot of the movies Netflix dropped, so that's what I usually watch.It's this kind of thinking that's the issue:Sarandos went on to say that Netflix needs to find a way to really differentiate itself in the movie business.If you take a film that that does well at the box office, and get it 7-10 months later on your streaming service, that's not going to create a ton of value, he explained. \"If you were passionate [about the movie], you've already seen it,\" he said.No, you dipshiat, that's the whole point of your service. There are lots of movies in the theaters I thought looked good but didn't bother to see and I don't have cable, so watching them on your service was the reason I have continued to subscribe. Now you've stopped showing those titles in favor of 9000 B-movie selections, so there's little to keep my interest. You may have 1/3 of your watching being movies regardless of your content, but if it's 1/3 of just ten people you won't stay in business for long. My horror buff buddies love it, it's a never-ending cesspool of groaners and nightmarish acting. For everyone else, the steady squeezing of the back catalogue is a serious source of mixed feelings toward Netflix; it's getting to the point where it's going to be like HBO Now, sign up for a month or two, binge on everything good, then cancel and sign up for another service, rinse and repeat.Amazon took the opposite tack, and just makes you pay for anything worth watching. Almost everything free on Prime is crap. (With a few exceptions, like The Secret of Kells and Song of the Sea .)",

      "text": "By Trey Williams, MarketWatch\nNetflix is aiming to have more than 1,000 hours of original content on the platform in 2017\nNetflix Inc.'s competitors in content and video streaming haven't done much in the way of knocking the streaming giant down a peg, which has prompted analysts at Evercore ISI, led by Ken Sena, to upgrade the stock to hold from sell.\nShares of Netflix(NFLX)rose nearly 3% intraday on Tuesday following the upgrade.\nIn March of last year Sena saw more platforms with more scaled audiences turning their focus to video, as well as staples in the video content world looking to over-the-top platforms, or online video streaming absent cable subscriptions. The increase in competition, Sena wrote in a note to clients, meant Netflix would need to invest more in content, which would further undermine its valuation.\nRead also:Netflix is rolling out download feature for movies and TV series (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/you-can-finally-stream-netflix-without-the-annoying-buffering-2016-11-30)\n\"As we assess the present-day competition, we find that the many impending OTT and subscription video on demand offerings we feared have failed to gain material traction or had a combination of false starts and delays. What we have learned is that obtaining scale has not proven easy,\" wrote Sena. \"While Netflix's elevated spending levels continue to raise the stakes where valuation is concerned, competitively speaking, Netflix seems to be in a good position.\"\nAlso see:5 horrible money lessons from 'Gilmore Girls' (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/5-horrible-money-lessons-from-gilmore-girls-2016-11-25)\nNetflix's level of investment in original programming has been shocking within the industry. At the start of the year, Netflix announced its plan to have 600 hours of original content, up from 450 hours last year. In 2017, the company is aiming for more than 1,000 hours, while again looking to spend $6 billion on content.\nCheck out:Netflix's new show 'The Crown' ushers in a new era of content spending (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/netflix-is-pouring-money-into-some-of-tvs-most-expensive-shows-2016-09-28)\nNetflix Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos, speaking at an investor conference recently, said the platform would add about 20 unscripted TV series next year.\nAll of these investments are, more than anything else, a play to gain and retain paying customers. Sena increased his 12-month price target and bumped up 2017 subscriber estimates, reasoning that churn, or subscribers leaving the service, should improve while the company stands to face easier financial comparisons.\nSena has forecast that Netflix will add 3.9 million subscribers domestically in 2017 and 12.6 million internationally. The 42 analysts following the stock and tracked by FactSet expect 4.4 million net adds domestically and 12.7 internationally.\nThere are caveats, however.\nSena said that Netflix has yet to see more meaningful competition from Amazon.com Inc. or the introduction of \"major scaled audience players,\" such as Apple Inc(AAPL)or Alphabet Inc.'s (GOOGL)Google. And Netflix is still in heavy investment mode.\nRead also:Amazon is preparing to expand streaming video to 200 countries globally: WSJ (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/amazon-is-preparing-to-expand-streaming-video-to-200-countries-globally-wsj-2016-11-17)\n\"While the company's commitment to international can obfuscate signs of scale efficiency, generally speaking we are seeing higher costs per subscriber on overall decelerating subscriber growth, suggesting that Netflix still very much remains in investment mode,\" he wrote.\nShares of Netflix have gained 7% in 2016, narrowly underperforming the S&P 500, which is up nearly 8%.\n-Trey Williams;\n 1636ET\n ",

      "text": "Stay on target A 'Hiro' Joined the Cast of Netflix's 'Death Note' Netflix's 'Pacific Heat' is an Aussie 'Archer' with Less Subversion Trying to find something to watch on Netflix can be overwhelming, which is why the streaming service’s latest update hopes to make that process easier.\nNetflix announced Tuesday that it’d soon be enabling short video previews on its television apps that can help people find content.\nThe videos, which are around 15 to 30 seconds long, aren’t straight advertisements. Rather, Netflix officials said they’re short “video synopses” that highlight story, look, characters, and more–basically distilling the elements of what makes a series or movie watchable, into a short amount of time.\n“As we launch more than 1,000 hours of original content next year, we know we have less than 90 seconds to capture someone’s attention and get them excited about a title — that’s why we’re introducing video previews into the TV browsing experience,” Stephen Garcia, director of product innovation for TV and Chris Jaffe, VP of product innovation, wrote in a blog post on the company’s website.\nThe global update comes less than a week after the company announced an offline mode that’ll allow its users to download some videos for unconnected streaming.\nWe’ve already seen something similar on the Netflix app, with ads for some of its original programming automatically play at the top of the screen or when you scroll over a title. The larger update is thanks to growing technologies and how, over time, people have become more comfortable with using the internet for streaming.\nThere have been attempts at helping its customers parse its large catalog before. Remember Max ? The talking head and game show host would insult you but would give you recommendations based on a series of questions. He was only available on the PS3 version of Netflix, and his recommendations were sometimes lacking when it came to quality and being able to pin down what you actually wanted to watch.\nHopefully, this new feature will make it easier to find something to watch. At the least, it’ll surprise you once an ad for a new Kevin James film accidentally starts playing, and you can’t find the remote.\nYou can watch a brief announcement video below.",

We think the home is the most important place for people.\"\nThe decision to add more time for new parents came after research into what workers wanted from their workplace. A work-life balance and time with family came in at the top of the list, according to the company.\nFoster and adoptive parents can use the policy as well and it includes both moms and dads.\nBetter get started on that nursery.\nBONUS: Kill the drones, Amazon Go is an actual game changer",

      "text": "Search ‘Hip-Hop Evolution': 5 Furious Facts We Learned From Netflix’s Doc (Photos) \nNo matter how much you love hip-hop, “Hip-Hop Evolution” will tell you things you didn’t know Tim Molloy   4:55 PM View as Grid View as List \n\"Hip-Hop Evolution,\" which just debuted on Netflix, goes very old school to source hip-hop's roots in the early 1970s. If you think of A Tribe Called Quest as old-school innovators, you'll be blown away by the earlier artistry of groups like Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five. Here are five things we learned from the series. \n\n1. How breakdancers got their name \nThe joke in the '80s was that they were called breakdancers because they broke bones spinning on their heads. Nope. They got the name because unlike disco dancers, they danced during the \"breaks\" in songs that DJs like Grandmaster Flash ( pictured ) looped to create the first hip-hop songs. \n\n2. Hip-hop exploded out of a blackout \nWidespread looting during the 1977 New York City blackout suddenly gave aspiring DJs and MCs the equipment they needed to launch their musical careers -- and launch a new musical art form. (This also comes up in Netflix's \"The Get Down.\") Grandmaster Caz ( pictured ) says he was among the artists who looted equipment. \n\n3. Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five were incredible. \nWe knew they were important before, but we didn't realize just how groundbreaking they were. They were the first hip-hop group to leave the Bronx and tour internationally, and they were the first to imagine the socially conscious force hip-hop could be. \"The Message\" advanced hip-hop far beyond the party songs of the 1970s and early '80s, paving the way for Ice Cube, KRS-One, Public Enemy and other politically minded rappers. \n\n4. The origins of \"Rapper's Delight\" \nEgo Trip's excellent \"Book of Rap Lists\" went into this story a bit, but \"Hip-Hop Evolution\" breaks down in detail how producer Sylvia Robinson assembled the Sugar Hill gang after an impromptu audition outside a New Jersey pizzeria. \nThey assembled \"Rapper's Delight\" to cash in on what was then an exciting new fad. There are many reasons other rappers considered them poseurs, including the apparent fact that Big Bank Hank borrowed rhymes from Grandmaster Caz. ( Caz later forgave him. ) \n\n5. Where Andre 3000 got his fashion daring \nThe Outkast MC's courageous fashion choices in the early 2000s seemed crazily out of step with hip-hop fashion. But these pictures of the Grandmaster Flash and the Furious 5 show that fashion daring was part of hip-hop from the start. \nAlso? This is how cool-looking Sylvia Robinson was. \nNo matter how much you love hip-hop, “Hip-Hop Evolution” will tell you things you didn’t know 1 of 9 \n\"Hip-Hop Evolution,\" which just debuted on Netflix, goes very old school to source hip-hop's roots in the early 1970s. If you think of A Tribe Called Quest as old-school innovators, you'll be blown away by the earlier artistry of groups like Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five.

      "text": "Like Us On Facebook Like Us On Facebook \nThe guys over at Netflix must be bored or something because they’re making announcements left, right and center . \nThey dropped their latest one today. It’s a brand spankin’ new way for you to decide which TV show or movie to watch. \nFrom now on, whenever you scroll through the array of media, a short clip will automatically play. \nPreviously, there was just an image and the option to watch a trailer. BUT NOW, YOU HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO WATCH IT. \nNetflix confirmed the news today in a tweet, sans explainer video. \nThe caption read, \nThis goes out to everyone whose dinner got cold trying to pick something to watch. This goes out to everyone whose dinner got cold trying to pick something to watch. pic.twitter.com/OtukhNqd9A \n— Netflix US (@netflix) December 6, 2016 \nThat whole dinner line is true. This stuff happens to good people like me and you. \nThe update doesn’t come without its drawbacks, however. \nNetflix is going to have to be super careful about the scenes it’s going to include in these mini clips. Too many might give away story lines, and the update could just turn into one big spoiler alert. \nToo little, however, won’t be enough to draw people in. Netflix \nOnly the other day, Netflix decided to give us an early Christmas present, and we’re ever so grateful. \nIt launched an option to download your favorite TV shows and movies so you can watch them offline … just in time for that long journey back home for the holidays. They know what people want. So, how does it work? \nVery easily. All you have to do is find the download button next to an episode of your choice and – you know – download the episode. Netflix \nThis means you can watch “Orange Is the New Black,” “Narcos” and “The Crown” without relying on those little internet bars at the top right corner of our screens that have somehow become our lives. \nSo, I guess Netflix isn’t ALL bad. \nSubscribe to Elite Daily's official newsletter, The Edge , for more stories you don't want to miss.

      "text": "‘Hip-Hop Evolution': 5 Furious Facts Dropped in Netflix’s Doc (Photos) More “Hip-Hop Evolution,” which just debuted on Netflix, goes very old school to source hip-hop’s roots in the early 1970s. If you think of A Tribe Called Quest as old-school innovators, you’ll be blown away by the earlier artistry of groups like Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five. Here are five things we learned from the series. 1. How breakdancers got their name The joke in the ’80s was that they were called breakdancers because they broke bones spinning on their heads. Nope. They got the name because unlike disco dancers, they danced during the “breaks” in songs that DJs looped to create the first hip-hop songs. 2. Hip-hop exploded out of a blackout Widespread looting during the 1977 New York City blackout suddenly gave aspiring DJs and MCs the equipment they needed to launch their musical careers — and launch a new musical art form. (This also comes up in Netflix’s “The Get Down.”) Grandmaster Caz says he was among the artists who looted equipment. 3. Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five were incredible. We knew they were important before, but we didn’t realize just how groundbreaking they were. They were the first hip-hop group to leave the Bronx and tour internationally, and they were the first to imagine the socially conscious force hip-hop could be. “The Message” advanced hip-hop far beyond the party songs of the 1970s and early ’80s, paving the way for Ice Cube, KRS-One, Public Enemy and other politically minded rappers. 4. The origins of “Rapper’s Delight” Ego Trip’s excellent “Book of Rap Lists” went into this story a bit, but “Hip-Hop Evolution” breaks down in detail how producer Sylvia Robinson assembled the Sugar Hill gang after an impromptu audition outside a New Jersey pizzeria. They assembled “Rapper’s Delight” to cash in on what was then an exciting new fad. There are many reasons other rappers considered them poseurs, including the apparent fact that Big Bank Hank borrowed rhymes from Grandmaster Caz . 5. Where Andre 3000 got his fashion daring The Outkast MC’s courageous fashion choices in the early 2000s seemed crazily out of step with hip-hop fashion. But these pictures of the Grandmaster Flash and the Furious 5 show that fashion daring was part of the culture from the beginning.",

      "text": "Reviewed by AlphaC Depending on how much you pay for this monitor it could be a good deal or a bad one. My father bought one of these and I helped to configure it. I advised him to get an ultrawide for productivity... New Posts All Forums: Forum Nav: has anyone use nVidia 10 series graphic card to play Netflix 4K content on PC? Select All Posts By This User It seems many reports indicate you can only use Intel Kaby Lake CPU (7th gen) to play Netflix 4K DRM content in Windows 10 Desktop PC (Microsoft Edge only) and left nVidia and AMD out of gate. Although nVidia supports HDCP 2.2, HDMI 2.0, and Microsoft PlayReady 3.0 (At least they say they do), but if content providers do not support nVidia, all of the new 10 series owner would be left in the dark. Has anyone played Netflix 4k over nVidia GPU without Kaby Lake CPU? Next year, Cyberlink PowerDVD 17 probably would support 4K UHD blu-ray playback on Intel Kaby Lake since the DRM requirement is finally ready. But if they follow Netflix’s approach left nVidia out, then nVidia Pascal would be just a gaming GPU. There aren’t much TRUE 4k movies on the market but more will come in the years ahead. True 4K movie is: shot in 4K camera, edit in 4k, save in 4k digital intermediate and burn to 4k uhd bluray. Any of the process in the streamline is not done by 4k or better, and then it’s not a True 4k movie. I have played starwar 7 uhd bluray (true 4k movie) on a 4k tv side-by-side with the bluray version on 1080p tv. Besides smaller pixels, it does provide better detail and color spectrum. Pascal GPU is great gaming gear for the time being. But if it won’t support 4K DRM, it would be major disappointment for me.",

      "text": "As Netflix continues to focus more and more on developing original content across every type of genre imaginable, we've seen a corresponding decline in both the quantity and quality of movies available on the wildly popular streaming service. And with good reason, developing and acquiring original content doesn't come cheap, thereby leaving fewer funds available to secure expensive licensing deals with movie studies. Interestingly enough, it may not be long before Hulu becomes a more appealing destination for movie lovers than Netflix.\nContinue reading... \nTrending right now: \nForget the NES Classic, this $49 console can play all the retro games you want BlackBerry’s final smartphone will be as bad as ever, leaked images claim 10 paid iPhone apps on sale for free for a limited time ",

      "text": "Netflix Is Completely Changing the Way You Choose What to Watch By Email Courtesy Netflix \nLet us paint you a little picture. You've just spent all evening cooking the chicken tortilla soup from Gwyneth Paltrow 's It's All Easy . You've been counting down the minutes (okay, make that hours, because honestly that cookbook isn't as easy as it claims to be—or else you're just inept in the kitchen, but this is all a topic of discussion for another day) until you can take your delicious soup creation, curl up on the couch, and watch the crap out of some Netflix. \nBut then the inevitable happens. \nYou hunker down in front of the TV, pick up the remote, and you can't find anything to watch. You're browsing, you're clicking, you're hitting that Godforsaken back button over and over. \nThe next thing you know, you still haven't chosen a movie and your chicken tortilla soup is cold. And soggy. And nothing that the blessed GP would ever approve of. Thanks a lot, Netflix. Photos \nBehind the Scenes of Netflix's Gilmore Girls Revival \nWell it seems that Netflix heard your complaints (or have been watching you through your TV), because they just announced a giant revamp of the browsing system. Now, they'll show preview videos of each show as you flip through the options. \nSo if you scroll over Stranger Things , you'll see clips from Stranger Things . If you scroll over House of Cards , you'll see clips from House of Cards . If you scroll over 12 Dates of Christmas , you'll see clips from 12 Dates of Christmas . \nThe idea is that you won't have to waste time trying to read descriptions or opening up a random episode to get a feel for what the TV show or movie is like—instead, you'll get a feel for each program in real time. In this world of complete indecisiveness, and complete impatience, it's nice to have a little leg up on decision-making. \nAnd hey, even if you never choose something to watch, you can always just watch the previews. At least while your soup is still hot. TAGS/ Netflix , Top Stories , E! Loves Additional  ",

      "text": "The White Helmets 17 Great Christmas Movies You Can Stream on Netflix Right Now (Photos) \nThe only reason people love this time of year is because it's now appropriate to binge watch a whole bunch of Christmas movies. So instead of wasting your time browsing for the best holiday movies, TheWrap's got you covered with 18 of our favorites. \n\"Love Actually\" \nProbably one of the best new classic Christmas movies out there. It's a romantic-comedy that follows nine intertwined love stories and it will give you all the feels. Just keep a box of tissues handy. Universal Pictures \n\"Last Holiday\" \nA shy ambitious woman writes her dreams of being a professional cook down in a journal, but never pursues it. Instead, she works in the cookware section of a department store, until one day she bumps her head while flirting with her co-worker. \nUpon examination, doctors tell her she has weeks to live, so the woman decides to quit her job and live life to its fullest. Paramount Pictures \n\"While You Were Sleeping\" \nOne of Sandra Bullock's earlier films, she plays a lonely woman working for the Chicago Transit Authority and has a crush on a regular commuter. On Christmas day, she saves him from a tragic accident and accompanies him to the hospital where a nurse mistakes her for his fiancee. Buena Vista Pictures \n\"White Christmas\" \nWe couldn't leave out this Christmas classic. This romantic-comedy-musical involves two singing acts joining together to save a former commanding officer's failing inn in Vermont. Paramount Pictures \n\"Serendipity\" \nA fateful day during the holiday season brings a man and woman in their 20s together for a magical night. The two part ways, despite having a strong mutual attraction, and years later try to find their way back to each other. Miramax Pictures \n\"Scrooged\" \nIt's another take on Dickens' \"A Christmas Carol,\" so we already pretty much knows how this movie plays out. This time though, it's a successful and cynical TV executive who gets haunted by three Christmas ghosts. Paramount Pictures \n\"Miracle on 34th Street\" (1994) \nA typical feel good Christmas movie to remind everyone that Santa Clause is really real. A woman is tasked with hiring a Santa Clause look-a-like to pose for pictures at a department store when she comes across a man named Kris Kringle--who happens to really be Santa. 20th Century Fox \n\"A Russell Peters Christmas Special\" \nSometimes, we don't want cuddly sentimental Christmas movies with cute dogs and love stories. Sometimes, we just want to laugh. \nIn comes comedian Russell Peters with a Christmas special Netflix \n\"November Rule\" \nWhile this isn't, on its, face, your typical Christmas Holiday movie, it does involve a guy who breaks up with his girlfriend because of his self-declared November rule -- which means that every November he has to break up with the woman he's with to avoid the lovey attachment of the holidays. I think you can guess what kind of holiday turn this plot is gonna take. Capitol Love \n\"Christmas With The Kranks\" \nThe Kranks cause a riot when they decide to skip Christmas and go on a vacation instead (the blasphemy) because their daughter is away in Peru. After almost heading out the door for their cruise, their daughter decides she's coming home after all, leaving the Kranks scrambling to get a fancy Christmas party together in the nick of time. Columbia Pictures \n\"Mickey's Magical Christmas\" \nYou can never go wrong with Mickey and Christmas especially when the movie features pretty much all of the Disney characters from Donald Duck to Aladdin's Jafar. Disney \n\"Marry Me for Christmas\" \nMost people dread the holidays because they don't want to be asked about who they're dating, when they're getting married/pregnant, etc. In this movie, a woman gets one step ahead of the game when she enlists her employee to pretend to be her fiancee to make her family happy. UP \n\"Beethoven's Christmas Adventure\" \nThere are very few things better than Beethoven the dog in a Santa hat trying to rescue an elf and save Christmas. Universal Pictures \n\"Santa Buddies\" \nOne of the few things better than Beethoven trying to save Christmas: Air Bud's puppies trying to save Christmas. Disney \n\"12 Dates of Christmas\" \nA woman keeps reliving Christmas Eve, including a date with a man named Miles, over and over again. How horrible. \n\"Mickey's Once Upon a Christmas\" \nThis movie is like having your grandparents read Christmas stories to you--except its Mickey and his friends which is even better in our opinion. Disney \n\"Snow Day\" \nEvery kid's dream: not having school because of a snow day. In this movie, kids try to stop a snowplow from cleaning up the streets to keep their school snowed in. It's not actually a Christmas movie, but all the snow should get you in the holiday spirit. Paramount Pictures Next Slide 1 of 18 \nA playlist of holiday films you can unapologetically binge watch from “Last Holiday” to “Love Actually” \nThe only reason people love this time of year is because it's now appropriate to binge watch a whole bunch of Christmas movies. So instead of wasting your time browsing for the best holiday movies, TheWrap's got you covered with 18 of our favorites.",

      "text": "Netflix Exec: You’ll Keep Watching Our Movies, Even When We Don’t Offer You Many Good Ones Image courtesy of dirtyblueshirt movie sign netflix netflix catalog blame canada ted sarandos \nLongtime Netflix subscribers may have noticed that the selection of movies on the streaming service has shrunk significantly over the last few years, but customers keep watching movies anyway. That’s according to the company’s head of content, Ted Sarandos, who explained at a conference this week that people love to watch movies on Netflix no matter how large the selection. \nU.S. viewers have a lot fewer movies available to us than our neighbors up in Canada, since Netflix has licensed content libraries up there that the much larger audience here doesn’t have access to. \nHere’s the weird thing, though: Business Insider shared Sarandos’ observation that no matter how many movies are actually available, about a third of what customers on both sides of the border watch is always movies. \nWhat’s the company’s solution to that? Gradually reducing how many movies it pays for is one possible solution, finally leaving all customers spending 33% of our screen time streaming Gigli over and over. Netflix’s actual solution has three parts, though: \nDeveloping original movies. This makes sense, and goes along with its original TV strategy. Creating its own content means that there will always be movies that customers can only get from Netflix, instead of them being commodities that could be available from any of the popular streaming services. \nNew releases. Most of these will be Netflix’s own productions, but the company still wants to have new films available to its customers the same day that they’re released in theaters, since there’s always a portion of the public that prefers to watch movies in their pajamas. Netflix CEO Reed Hastings has said that the current movie theater business model is “strangling” the industry by keeping new releases artificially unavailable. \nLicensing Disney movies. The Disney library consists of films that people enjoy watching repeatedly, and that small children enjoy watching multiple times per day. A Netflix-Disney content deal is good for both sides , and will also make the movie-hungry public happy. \nWant more stories from Consumerist? We’re a non-profit!

      "text": "You've seen all of Stranger Things and you want to stream another TV series on Netflix, but there's no trailer to preview it so you have the hassle of searching YouTube. We've all been there - but now Netflix is finally giving us trailers for ALL its movies and TV shows. At the moment, preview trailers are only available for original content produced by Netflix itself. But the streaming service has finally decided to give viewers a better idea of what they want to watch and will soon be adding brief previews for every film and series in its catalogue. Watch the cool video they made: The previews won't be your average trailers, though - they're made specifically by Netflix as \"video synopses that help members make faster and more confident decisions by quickly highlighting the story, characters and tone of a title\". If anything, the videos don't sound like they'll be trying to mislead us, at least. The previews will currently only be available when you stream Netflix on TV, but gaming consoles, Roku and other devices will have them in the coming weeks. This is yet another helpful tool introduced by Netflix in the last week, as it recently added the long-awaited ability to watch some of its content offline. ",

Sitting on the couch on a Sunday afternoon, unable to pick a Netflix show or movie to stave off the Sunday Scaries, which consequently stresses us out even more until we eat an entire pint of Ben & Jerry's in defeat (oh, just us? OK, then.) \nBut now, finally, Netflix has provided a solution to our state of perpetual indecision, and never again will we have to forgo watching TV just because we can't settle on a show or movie. Introducing: the Netflix preview feature, which will instantly help you speed up your selection process. Netflix now has short video previews of their content that will appear above the list you are scrolling through, to give you a better idea of what each TV show or movie is about. \nVIDEO: Stranger Things Star Natalia Dyer Shares 5 Things From The Set \n\nIn a blog post from the streaming service, Netflix made it clear that these \"video previews aren’t teasers or traditional trailers. They are specially designed video synopses that help members make faster and more confident decisions by quickly highlighting the story, characters and tone of a title.\" \nNetflix revealed the feature on the same day of its release, and will \"launch globally today [Tuesday, Dec. 6] and will become available on eligible devices over the next few weeks. [The previews] will be available on Netflix enabled devices, which includes the majority of game consoles and Roku devices, with smart TVs and others getting updated in the coming months.\" ",

      "text": "'Danny Rand Is No White Saviour,' Says Marvel's Iron Fist Showrunner Photo Credit: Netflix / Cara Howe (L-R) Jessica Henwick, Finn Jones, and Rosario Dawson on the sets of Marvel's Iron Fist Highlights Marvel's Iron Fist will arrive on Netflix in March 2017 The show attracted controversy for its casting Showrunner Buck says Danny Rand is \"no white saviour\" \nMarvel’s Iron Fist, the fourth standalone series leading up to The Defenders, will arrive on Netflix in March next year . Beyond a teaser trailer released two months ago, we know very little about the character’s adaptation from the comic pages, or the people who are making it. Netflix invited Gadgets 360 for a chat with Iron Fist showrunner Scott Buck and VP original series Allie Goss a while ago, and we can now (thankfully) reveal the conversation’s contents. Here’s what we learned. \nHow does working with a streaming service in Netflix as opposed to a cable network change your creative process? Buck: It changes a little bit because you can approach it in a slightly more organic way because you’re not trying to initially create a pilot that we have to get rated, and if it doesn’t get rated we are gone. So when you’re in that sort of circumstance [a pilot], you tend to throw everything at the screen right away, and you’re not necessarily thinking what is best for the show, what is the story. When you know you’re going to do the whole season, and you don’t have to worry about ratings, you can approach in a slowly more affectionate sort of way. Particularly with these stories [Iron Fist], we approach them all through characters. You get to tell the story in a way that feels more like a novel, than just what are we going to do today, what are we going to do this week, to try to keep it on air.\nNetflix doesn’t provide ratings for its shows, be it to the creators or viewers. On network television, there is a big focus on that. Does that have any impact? Buck: It’s a stress factor because it’s not just you that’s waiting for the ratings, but everyone at the network, and everyone at the studio. They are judging you by that, and they are judging the show by that – so the show lives and dies by that. With Netflix that’s just not the situation so it also creates a more relaxed atmosphere where you know everyone is on the same team. Jessica Henwick as Colleen Wing on the sets of Marvel's Iron Fist Photo Credit: Netflix / Patrick Harbron \nWith the subscription service available globally in 190 countries, Iron Fist will be go out to everyone around the world on day 1. Does that affect storytelling? Buck: Absolutely it does, and I think that’s why these shows work so well. Because we are not thinking what is the greatest stunt Danny can do this week, we are thinking where is this character going, what is this character’s journey. We are more interested in telling real, genuine stories of someone who has that superpower and doesn’t even necessarily know what to do with the superpower, that I think people will more identify with. You can watch explosions and fights all day long but they can be tiring. What pulls people in, what makes people interested is a good character who’s telling a good story. \nCan you talk a bit about the preparation process, shooting and visual aesthetic of Iron Fist? Buck: The prep starts very early, since it involves finding locations and building sets. It’s a collaborative process; things change as script is written and everything gets handed down. It’s a lot for production [team] to go through. \nThere is a lot of going back and forth, awful lot of Skype-ing. Between all of us, there is a constant email barrage, going back and forth, and the editing itself is done back in Los Angeles. I can watch everything from here if I want to, but I’ll go back to LA because the director will be there. And he’ll put out the first cut, and changes continue, continue, continue until we get the final product we are looking for. \nUntil now, all other Marvel shows have had grounded heroes. How are you balancing the mythological aspects with Iron Fist? Buck: To me when I first encountered the character, it seemed these were like not the greatest superpowers. All he can do is punch really hard. That’s sort of what appealed to me about it – he has this one gift, you can use it in some ways but in rest of his life, it’s not really all that significant. His greatest gift is his martial arts skills, and that’s something he suffered and worked for. Finn Jones as Danny Rand on the sets of Marvel's Iron Fist Photo Credit: Netflix / JoJo Whilden \nGoss: Through all Marvel shows, it’s about a great character-story first, and a superhero-story second. We don’t want to downplay powers or abilities, or the fact these characters are derived from comics and graphic novels because that’s what’s so special about them, but we want to expose those in a way that’s little more aimed towards adults, and lets us explore these people beyond just these superhero, which feels so generic given how deep these characters have the ability to be. \nBuck: We are schooled well in ways that it [the superpowers] could happen if this happened, and this happened, and that happened. It’s about approaching it in a grounded way, and not that it’s magic. \nHow did Netflix and Marvel decide on what characters to pick for The Defenders? Goss: Three years ago, Marvel came in and pitched a very ambitious project, The Defenders. It was four individual shows followed by a limited series that would bring them all together. When they came in, it was actually these four characters – there was Daredevil , Jessica Jones , Luke Cage , and Iron Fist . We weren’t entirely sure which order they would go in, that became part of the development and creative process. It was always going to be a discussion whether these were the right four, but as we got going on Daredevil and Jessica Jones, it started to feel like these were the exact right heroes. \nThey are far more grounded, and they set up The Defenders quite well. We were able to explore the character stories without getting too consumed by superpowers or heroes flying through the air, or massive visual effects. And in that way, they became the greatest street level heroes we could explore. And then from there, Jon Bernthal as The Punisher in Daredevil season two was just a standout, that it was undeniable and we had to move forward and wanted to very much. Jessica Stroup and Tom Pelphrey as Joy and Ward Meachum, respectively, on the sets of Marvel's Iron Fist Photo Credit: Netflix / David Giesbrecht \nWhat about the villains? Were they pre-determined too? Goss: How it works is, that Scott [Buck] or other showrunners – when they are working on the development of the project – they come in and pitch what they think is the season going to be. They’ve gone through the process with Marvel to clear characters. And then we talk about whether that’s the right setup and whether it makes sense. \nIn the comics, Iron Fist can come off as a white saviour. How did you approach the casting for Danny Rand, who is now played by white-guy Finn Jones? Buck: When Marvel came to me with this idea, I’d never heard of Iron Fist or Danny Rand. I had never read the comics. What [Marvel TV head] Jeph Loeb pitched me specifically was this character Danny Rand, and that was the story that pulled me in. That intrigued me. So the other aspects I only learned about afterwards, and I can say most definitively Danny Rand is no white saviour. He’s trying to save himself, if anything. \nIs there a particular incarnation of the character Marvel prescribed for Iron Fist? Buck: One of the many things that appealed to me about Danny Rand was that even though there had been so many comic books written about him, there wasn’t this great big backlog of information and story. So it allowed us to be a little bit more creative, and to take a slightly different direction with this character. And if you do go back and read the comics, they have completely different origin stories from one series to another. It did give us that freedom to create the character we specifically wanted. \nHow much of continuity factors in, building up to The Defenders? How much freedom do you have? Buck: There is a fair amount of freedom. Sometimes things are done because they are fun, and then we go, eh the next series will figure this out. (Laughter) There is a bit of that, but also I do talk to the other showrunners. Because we are leading into The Defenders, we have to leave our show in a very specific place with our character, because we do sort of plant seeds and stories that will then come to fruition in The Defenders. There does have to be a lot of cooperation between all the different groups. But other than that, we work distinctly by ourselves. \nDisclosure: Netflix sponsored the correspondent’s travel and dining for the duration of the visit.",

      "text": "Netflix has been working on adding support for offline viewing to its mobile apps for a while now, and a few days ago the feature went live on iPhone and Android. A few days after that, Netflix topped Apple’s list of top-grossing iPhone apps for the first time. There’s clearly a connection between these two events.\nDON’T MISS: Demand for VR headsets has been surprisingly disappointing\nThis simple feature — allowing users to download certain movies and TV shows and view them while offline — helped Netflix make plenty of money, apparently.\nAccording to a post on the Sensor Tower blog, the Netflix iOS app first flirted with the No.1 spot on November 14th, but only ended up the day in second place. The app returned to the second position on Sunday and then hit the number one position on Monday.\nIn addition to topping the US iPhone top-grossing chart, the Netflix app also reached the number one position in other markets, including India, Mexico, and Colombia.\nLast month, Netflix was the seventh grossing iOS app overall in the app store, Sensor Tower says. Since in-app subscriptions were introduced last fall, net revenue grew from less than $50,000 to nearly $2.9 million.\nThe introduction of offline viewing mode should help Netflix gain more subscribers, the company said. Netflix revealed that in addition to original TV and film content it plans to make a big push into unscripted programming next year, with 20 shows slated to launch next year.\nHere’s how you download movies on your iPhone or Android handset , and here’s how these downloads affect your mobile storage .\nTrending right now:\nForget the NES Classic, this $49 console can play all the retro games you want Connect three HDMI devices to your TV using only one HDMI port 10 paid iPhone apps on sale for free for a limited time See the original version of this article on BGR.com",

      "text": "Search 9 Underrated TV Comedies You Should Binge Now on Netflix (Photos) \nFrom “Bernie Mac” to “My Name Is Earl,” plenty of undervalued sitcoms are worth discovering – or giving a second look Scott Collins  07 PM \nNot every comedy can be \"Friends,\" \"Modern Family\" or \"The Big Bang Theory.\" Some flop or just fail to connect with the audience they should have. Luckily, you can catch them again on streaming platforms. \n\"The Grinder\" It was one and done for this Fox comedy starring Rob Lowe as an actor pretending to be a lawyer, but the writing and the performances were smart and funny. \n\"The Increasingly Poor Decisions of Todd Margaret\" David Cross plays an American loser who keeps getting into worse jams with his British employers. Cross -- more famous for \"Mr. Show\" and \"Arrested Development\" -- has said that after three seasons, the show's over, but it has plenty of hilarious moments. \n\"The Bernie Mac Show\" Created by Larry Wilmore, this family sitcom on Fox is worth seeing if only for the antics of Bernie Mac, the supremely talented standup comic who died just two years after the show ended in 2006. \n\"The IT Crowd\" Few Americans know this offbeat British comedy hit about two tech nerds and their computer-challenged boss in an IT department. But at its best it's about as funny as TV can get. Fans will see many similarities with \"The Big Bang Theory,\" although the shows were developed separately. \n\"Don't Trust the B---- in Apartment 23\" Krysten Ritter as Chloe, a party girl with \"the morals of a pirate,\" served as the basis of this anarchic urban comedy. Well, anarchic for ABC, where it lasted for a season and a half. \n\"My Name Is Earl\" Jason Lee as the title character in this NBC blue-collar family send-up, filled with more loopy characters and one-liners than you could completely appreciate on the first viewing. \n\"Freaks and Geeks\" One of the biggest comedy cult shows of all time, this acerbic look at a 1980s high school aired just 12 episodes before NBC pulled the plug. You can catch a very young James Franco and Seth Rogen, among many others. \n\"Better Off Ted\" Critics loved this barbed corporate satire starring Jay Harrington about the head of R&D at a sleek but soulless company, but the show may have been a little narrow for ABC, which dumped it after two low-rated seasons. \n\"Grounded for Life\" Donal Logue and Megyn Price starred as young-ish parents who still haven't shaken off their youthful urges. Some nice performances, consistently enlivened with some funny guest walk-ons. Also? One of the very few TV comedies set on Staten Island. \nEnjoy this gallery?",

      "text": "As Netflix continues to focus more and more on developing original content across every type of genre imaginable, we’ve seen a corresponding decline in both the quantity and quality of movies available on the wildly popular streaming service. And with good reason, developing and acquiring original content doesn’t come cheap, thereby leaving fewer funds available to secure expensive licensing deals with movie studies. Interestingly enough, it may not be long before Hulu becomes a more appealing destination for movie lovers than Netflix.\nDON’T MISS: The Galaxy S8 will have no headphone jack but plenty of courage\nThe decline in movie titles available on Netflix is nothing short of staggering. In fact, Netflix’s content library on the whole is 40% smaller today than it was 4 years ago. Most notably, Netflix last year opted not to renew its licensing deal with Epix, thereby losing access to thousands of movie titles, including big-budget films such as The Wolf of Wall Street and The Hunger Games: Catching Fire . With more money to play around with, Netflix has since upped its commitment to original programming, having just recently committed a whopping $100 million for a handful of comedy specials from Chris Rock and Dave Chappelle.\nNetflix of course is well aware that film buffs may not be thrilled with the company’s laser-like focus on original programming. Still, the company doesn’t much care given that most Netflix users aren’t even watching movies in the first place.\nDuring an appearance at the UBS Global Media and Communications conference yesterday, Netflix chief content guru Ted Sarandos revealed (via Business Insider ) that approximately 66% of Netflix subscribers don’t watch movies at all, no matter the selection of titles available.\n“No matter what,” Sarandos said, “we end up with about 1/3 of our watching being movies,” he responded.\nThe report adds:\nIf you take a film that that does well at the box office, and get it 7-10 months later on your streaming service, that’s not going to create a ton of value, he explained. “If you were passionate [about the movie], you’ve already seen it,” he said. Netflix is “happy to have” some of those movies, but the audience isn’t particularly passionate (hence the “1/3 no matter” what pattern).\nIt’s an interesting statistic that certainly shes some more light on the rationale behind Netflix’s ‘let’s bet the farm’ strategy vis a vis original content. Indeed, Netflix’s winning strategy of focusing on original content that can’t be consumed elsewhere has helped influence other media players join the party, with Hulu and Amazon being two prime examples. Without question, Netflix CEO Reed Hastings’ decision to completely shift the direction of the company towards online streaming and away from mail-in DVDs was nothing short of brilliant.\nDuring a recent tech conference this past September, Netflix CFO David Wells said that the company’s ultimate goal is to achieve a 50/50 split between original programming and a mixture of licensed TV programming and movies. Wells also added that Netflix was about “1/3 to halfway” there.\nTrending right now:\nForget the NES Classic, this $49 console can play all the retro games you want BlackBerry’s final smartphone will be as bad as ever, leaked images claim 10 paid iPhone apps on sale for free for a limited time See the original version of this article on BGR.com",

      "text": "NEW YORK — Netflix is continuing its quest to dominate television. With 87 million subscribers in 190 territories, it has 30 series in production or development, and next year plans to double — to 1,000 hours — the amount of original programming, chief content officer Ted Sarandos said at the UBS Global Media conference Monday.\nIts next frontier: More unscripted programming, with 20 new shows such as Ultimate Beastmaster , an obstacle-course competition series (think American Ninja Warrior ) featuring contestants and announcers from six countries.\nExclusive series are the streaming service's top priority. Netflix is often criticized for its sometimes moldy selection of theatrical movies, but Sarandos said they still represent 30% of the service's total viewing, even with this year's addition of Disney titles, which are bypassing the typical pay-cable stop.\nBut how do subscribers actually watch? In new data shared with USA TODAY, Netflix says 59% of its members — or about 51 million — take a break, usually lasting two to three days, after finishing an original series before they dive into a new one.\nNick Wilde (voiced by Jason Bateman) meets bunny officer Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin) in Disney's 'Zootopia.' (Photo: Disney)\nAnd 61% of those who do pause weave a standalone film or standup special between those series binges, often choosing like-minded titles. So, for example, fans of the whimsical Gilmore Girls and Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt are more apt to follow them with titles such as The Princess Bride and Sixteen Candles , while Stranger Things viewers opt for Disney's Zootopia .\nViewers of Narcos or Breaking Bad go for similarly edgy Pulp Fiction, and watchers of Orange Is the New Black and Bloodline tend to watch Spotlight. (The research is based on worldwide trends from January to October).\nNetflix has a more \"dispassionate audience\" of movie fans, said Sarandos, who views Netflix's original films with Kevin James and Adam Sandler as popular if unexceptional \"comfort-food comedy.\" But expanding its film slate to more ambitious fare may achieve a loftier goal. He expects Bright , an upcoming feature shrouded in mystery that marks a new collaboration between Suicide Squad 's star Will Smith and director David Ayer, to launch a new film franchise.\n\"Can those films be subscription drivers the way series are?\" he asked.\nNeil Patrick Harris stars in Netflix's original Lemony Snicket series, 'A Series of Unfortunate Events,' which makes its debut Jan. 13. (Photo: Joe Lederer, Netflix)\nMeanwhile, upcoming series hint at Netflix's broadening slate: a second season of Fuller House (available Friday); Chasing Cameron (Dec. 27), a reality series that follows Internet star Cameron Dallas; Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events (Jan. 13); new episodes of kids series Voltron: Legendary Defender (Jan. 20); Santa Clarita Diet (Feb. 3), a new comedy starring Drew Barrymore and Timothy Olyphant as married Realtors; and the next Marvel series, Iron Fist (March 17).\n\"We're trying to make sure we have something for everyone in the house,\" Sarandos said.",

      "text": "9 Underrated TV Comedies You Should Binge Now on Netflix (Photos) More Not every comedy can be “Friends” or “Modern Family” or “The Big Bang Theory.” Some flop or just fail to connect with the audience they should have. Luckily, you can catch these TV comedies again on Netflix and other streaming platforms. “The Grinder” It was one and done for this Fox comedy starring Rob Lowe as an actor pretending to be a lawyer, but the writing and the performances were smart and funny. “Freaks and Geeks” One of the biggest comedy cult shows of all time, this acerbic look at a 1980s high school aired just 12 episodes before NBC pulled the plug. You can catch a very young James Franco and Seth Rogen, among many others. “The Increasingly Poor Decisions of Todd Margaret” David Cross plays an American loser who keeps getting into worse jams with his British employers. Cross – more famous for “Mr. Show” and “Arrested Development” – has said that after three seasons, the show’s over, but it has plenty of hilarious moments. “The Bernie Mac Show” Created by Larry Wilmore, this family sitcom on Fox is worth seeing if only for the antics of Bernie Mac , the supremely talented standup comic who died just two years after the show ended in 2006.",

      "title": "Analyzing Netflix’s VPN Ban 6 Months Later",
      "text": "Translate \nWhen Netflix rolled out to more than 130 countries at the beginning of this year, many people in those countries were overjoyed. Then, two months later, many of them were not. \nNetflix isn’t the same in every country. Each has its own catalog of TV shows and movies depending on where it has struck licensing agreements with copyright holders. It’s generally accepted that the US has the best and largest catalog of TV shows. \nSo Netflix users outside of the U.S. turned to VPNs and other sorts of proxy tools to fake their device’s location and make it look as though they were located in the U.S. Simply be re-routing Internet traffic through a server on American soil, they could access the US catalog. \nThen Netflix banned some of those VPNs . And then it banned smart DNS proxies, too. And then more VPNs. Customers were not happy paying the same or more as their American counterparts while being saddled with a slimmer selection of shows. \nThe VPN ban continues even now, with only a handful of holdouts still offering a means of bypassing Netflix’s firewall. \nSo how does Netflix do it? And how are the holdouts managing to evade Netflix’s ire where so many others have failed? Tech services review website Comparitech interviewed several of the remaining VPNs to find out. How Netflix blocks VPNs \nThe consensus among the executives — including representatives from NordVPN, Buffered, VyprVPN, and LiquidVPN–is that Netflix identifies and blocks the servers that VPN users connect to. Because these servers are housed in their own huge data centers and not from residences on IP networks, says LiquidVPN CEO Dave Cox, their range of IP addresses are easy to spot. \nAnyone who connects to Netflix from one of these servers receives an error message in the video player, “You seem to be using an unblocker or proxy. Please turn off any of these services and try again.” \nEven the VPNs that still work with Netflix only do so in a web browser. The Netflix apps used on mobile devices, smart TVs, set-top boxes, and game consoles can override which DNS servers are preferred by the VPN. This forces DNS requests–bits of information that resolve domain names into IP addresses–to a local public server, thereby giving away the user’s true location. \nNone of the VPNs Comparitech interviewed would say exactly how they’ve managed to thwart the firewall thus far. They don’t want to draw too much attention or give their secrets away to rivals. But Buffered CEO Jordan Fried says that if Netflix wanted to put a stop to VPNs for good, it would do so. Obsolete content licensing \nSo why hasn’t it? Because banning VPN users isn’t just bad for VPN providers. It’s bad for Netflix. Netflix has undoubtedly lost customers due to its VPN policy. They’ve either defected to other streaming services or resorted to piracy. \nNetflix is beholden to copyright owners that rely on an antiquated system of laws and contracts that haven’t aged well in the internet age. When everything is available anywhere at any time, limiting your TV show or movie to a single geographical region is ultimately a futile task. It’s simply not enforceable. \nThe VPN execs agree: content licensing practices desperately need to evolve. Choose: entertainment or privacy? \nThe biggest ethical argument against a VPN ban is that users are forced to sacrifice their privacy for entertainment. Remember that VPNs are fundamentally privacy tools to prevent ISPs, governments, and hackers from snooping on users’ online activity. People use them to access private internal networks for work, secure public wifi hotspots at hotels and airports, and bypass censorship in countries without freedom of speech, among other things. \nEven if a VPN user in the United States connects to another location in the United States just to secure their connection, Netflix will still try to prevent them from watching video. \nAs NordVPN CIO Emanuel Morgan points out, Netflix is now in 190 countries, many of which have intrusive internet surveillance, mass internet censorship, or no net neutrality protections–all issues that can be mitigated with VPNs. \nVyprVPN’s Liz Kintzele, VP of sales and marketing at parent company Golden Frog, sums it up nicely: “Any time VPN use is discouraged, even subtly, it carries cybersecurity risks.” An ongoing battle \nNetflix doesn’t seem likely to change its stance on VPNs and proxies anytime in the near future. The few remaining VPNs that Comparitech interviewed seemed optimistic, but not certain that they would be able to continue offering a workaround in the coming months. \nComparitech maintains a regularly updated list of VPNs that work with Netflix .

      "text": "Share Tweet \nThe popularization of the “re-enactment” technique of so many non-fiction films and docuseries can in large part be traced to Errol Morris, director of The Thin Blue Line and The Fog Of War , who looms over the genre like a titan. His influence on subsequent filmmakers can be felt in everything from Oscar winners like Taxi To The Dark Side to countless Investigation Discovery series. In those latter cable shows, the meditative and restrained use of recreating scenes in question usually gets replaced by a cheap and exploitative technique wherein actors replay lurid sequences of violence and sudsy emotional fireworks for maximum button-pushing impact. Somewhere in between the two applications lies Captive , a new Netflix series that can’t resist juicing up its already-compelling subject matter with the Morris-derived technique, unintentionally lessening its impact instead of bolstering it. \nThe format is episodic and straightforward: Each installment deals with a different instance of real life hostage-taking, in which the historical record (taken mostly from television coverage) is paired alongside first-person interviews from the subjects involved, and then the aforementioned re-enactment device is liberally applied throughout. The selected incidents are wide-ranging both temporally and geographically, though obviously all chosen from recent enough history that the concerned parties are (mostly) still alive and able to speak about the experience. The name of Executive Producer Doug Liman ( Edge Of Tomorrow , The Bourne Identity ) and the Netflix brand were presumably useful assets for the filmmakers, as they’re able to secure access to a few difficult-to-reach participants, including criminals still imprisoned and technically forbidden from being interviewed on camera (there’s some impressive instances of video interview illicitly recorded via internal prison communication systems). Each episode walks through the events as they unfolded, marking time from the moment of the initial hostage situation via a “_ Days” title card, keeping the viewer in the dark about the direction and outcome of each event until the end. Photo: Jean Louis Schuller/Netflix \nThere’s plenty of things Captive does right to keep things engaging. Episodes are of variable length based on the material, meaning the shows are serving their subjects and not the other way around. The third episode, “Lucasville,” is the stronger of the two installments Netflix made available for review, and it’s easy to see why it was chosen to represent the series. Despite its hour-and-a-half length, the subject is so gripping one could easily imagine delving further into the story. Recounting the 1993 takeover of an entire wing of the Southern Ohio Correctional Facility by its prisoners, the show follows the day-by-day accounts of the prisoners who participated in the rebellion; the guards taken hostage and held for the duration of the takeover; the authorities who tried to bring about a peaceful resolution to the standoff; and the families of those involved. There’s astounding police footage from inside and outside the walls, looking on as prisoners carry out the bodies of fellow inmates killed in the initial melee, and you hear the officers’ voices as they debate how to proceed in those fraught circumstances. The episode wisely continually refers to the outside perspective of the press and public, showing how public opinion put pressure on those in charge to make rash or hurried moves in retaliation, as well as the firsthand account of the warden, describing the psychological toll exacted on him by the ordeal. The sense of pessimism from all involved as the days progressed is palpable through the screen. \nHowever, the series doesn’t really trust its audience to engage with the material on its own merits. The scenes of recreation, most often shots of stressful moments talking to negotiators or other slices of life from inside the facility during the occupation, become too aggressive in their efforts to make you duly engaged. There’s an early shot, during a re-enactment of the riot that ended up destroying a majority of the prison equipment, in which the sudden appearance of a hand in a window is filmed like a jump scare from a horror film. Additionally, the music and framing are deployed for maximum over-emphasis, playing up the psychological intensity of an event that needs no such goosing. In so doing, the series overplays its hand, coming across more like the pulpy basic cable docudramas to which it’s clearly intended to be superior. Photo: Mark Wolf/Netflix \nA similar issue plagues the fifth installment, “The Cola Kidnap,” which addresses the 1991 abduction of Corinne Coffin, a Brazilian Coca-Cola bottling executive kidnapped and held for ransom for days on end by a team of criminals in Rio, led by Ronaldo Monteiro, who stresses the ways his military training prepped him to become a skilled abductor. (Monteiro’s interviews are cleverly filmed so it’s unclear where he’s being lensed, in prison or somewhere far away; he also delivers some good lines, such as recounting how, in the late ’80s and early ’90s, “kidnapping came into fashion.”) Much more a classic case of ransom between a gang of determined crooks and a frantic family, the back and forth between the two camps plays out in occasionally surprising ways. But again, the emphasis on the emotional drama runs on and on, as though the show is worried we’ll forget how anxious and panicked and unhappy everybody involved was unless they continually re-state it, to the sounds of tense instrumentation and slow-motion dramatic recreations. It adds an element of pandering to the series, and takes time away from potentially compelling avenues of exploration, like the cultural milieu of Rio De Janeiro at the time, which receives scant attention in the early minutes and is then abandoned. \nCaptive has all the elements of an engaging and informative documentary series. Producers Simon and Jonathan Chinn have an accomplished resume of excellent non-fiction films and television series under their belts ( Searching For Sugar Man , Atari: Game Over , 30 For 30 ), so it’s unclear why they felt the need to ladle on the theatrics so heavily this time out. Still, it’s a compelling topic, and the series certainly delivers the expected drama, albeit in a heavy-handed manner, meaning those looking for a docu-diversion should find it worthy of delving into. Life and death scenarios are innately harrowing, and if Captive realizes it doesn’t need to add to the intensity of its subject matter, it’ll truly be worthy of capturing your time.",

Netflix Inc., the largest online subscription video service, is expected to release earnings figures on April 15. Photographer: Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg via Getty Images Advertisement \nNetflix will now allow its members to download selected TV shows and movies, and watch them on their iPhones and Android devices while being offline. \nAccording to Variety , the following TV show and series are the part of this new feature for the time being. Orange Is the New Black Narcos Kung Fu Panda 3 Home \n\"While many members enjoy watching Netflix at home, we've often heard they also want to continue their 'Stranger Things' binge while on airplanes and other places where internet is expensive or limited,\" said Eddy Wu, Netflix's director of product innovation. \nNetflix has made this new download feature available to its worldwide members of any plans. Download can be done via wifi connection as well as mobile net data. \nVariety also mentioned that downloading titles can be done only if users has iOS 8.0 or later or Android 4.4.2 or later along with the updated version of Netflix app. \nFor the first time, Netflix has been recently ranked as the top grossing iPhone app. \nAccording to The Wrap , Netflix's Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos has recently announced that streaming provider is going to expand its services into reality TV show in 2017. \nHe said that as many as 20 unscripted series will be provided to the users in the upcoming year. \nHe believed that the unscripted television is a very interesting genre to exploit. Subscribers can choose a topic from the vast options that reality TV shows provide. \nFor example, if anyone feels like watching a show about hoarding, then there are at least three shows about hoarding to choose from. Netflix is expected to attract more subscribers through reality TV shows. \n",

If you want to know what for example Stranger Things is about the video preview will show you in a matter of seconds, says Netflix.- We are launching a new television user interface that uses video more extensively to bring content alive in real time and helps members decide whether to click play. As we launch more than 1,000 hours of original content next year, we know we have less than 90 seconds to capture someones attention and get them excited about a title -- thats why were introducing video previews into the TV browsing experience, said Stephen Garcia, Director of Product Innovation for TV, Netflix.With close to 90 million customers, Netflix is rolling out the new feature gradually. Owners of game consoles and Roku boxes will get it first. Over the coming months it will roll out on Smart TVs and other TV devices. Share on:",

      "text": "By Jude Chan / theedgemarkets.com.sg   3:43 PM   \nSINGAPORE (Dec 7): Forget Narcos. Netflix’s 86 million users around the world could soon find themselves addicted to Singapore’s The Little Nyonya instead. \nFrom early 2017, over 20 of Singapore’s locally-produced Chinese TV series will be made available on the streaming service, Mediacorp and Netflix say in a joint announcement on Wednesday. \nUnder the agreement, award-winning classics such as The Little Nyonya and The Golden Path will be streamed together with more recent dramas, such as The Dream Job and The Truth Seeker to more than 190 countries around the world. \n“We are delighted to have this opportunity to showcase our local dramas to a global audience on Netflix, and give them a taste of made-in-Singapore content,” says Mediacorp’s Chief Content Officer CheeK. \n“We hope to cultivate more discerning fans beyond our shores, who are looking for high-quality Asian content,” he adds. \n“Netflix’s content library is growing every day and we are excited to be adding homegrown dramas by Mediacorp to the service,” says Netflix Asia’s Vice President of Communications Jessica Lee. “These popular local shows will now find new audiences all over the world, truly making Netflix a service that has something for everyone.” Related Articles",
