      "text": "By Joseph De Avila\nGeneral Electric Co. on Monday said it sold its former global headquarters in Fairfield, Conn., to Sacred Heart University for $31.5 million.\nThe move allows Sacred Heart, a Roman Catholic school with about 8,500 students, to expand, but it will result in significantly lower tax revenue for the Connecticut town, where GE opened its suburban office park in 1974.\nGE, citing Connecticut's rising taxes, said in January that it would move to Boston. It said it was pleased to sell its campus, which spans more than 60 acres, to Sacred Heart, calling it \"a world-class local university.\"\nSacred Heart's existing campus isn't far from the old GE site, and the university's president, John Petillo, said the purchase lined up with its expansion plans.\n\"It's literally walking distance from our campus,\" he said. \"We've had tremendous growth in the last five years. And the one thing they don't make more of is land.\"\nMr. Petillo said the university would keep and refurbish the old GE buildings. Sacred Heart can add about 450 students and up to 60 jobs over the next four years with the new space.\nThe university plans on expanding its new computing school, which it opened this year, at the site. It will also move part of its Jack Welch College of Business, named after GE's former chief executive, there as well.\nThe deal is a mixed bag for Fairfield, said Michael Tetreau, the town's first selectman.\nGE paid the town $1.6 million a year in property taxes on an assessed value of about $80 million, Mr. Tetreau said. The town stands to lose most of that, he said, because as an educational institution Sacred Heart won't have to pay property taxes.\nHe estimated that Connecticut would reimburse Fairfield for about $400,000 in lost property taxes.\n\"On the one hand, I see the benefits to Sacred Heart for their future growth and expansion, and that's a good thing for our community,\" Mr. Tetreau said. \"On the other hand, from a pure financial standpoint, we are losing over $1 million in tax revenue, and that causes serious concerns going forward.\"\nMr. Tetreau said Fairfield would likely have to attract new business, cut spending and raise property taxes to offset the loss.\nMr. Petillo said Sacred Heart paid the current market rate for the property. The university's expansion will drive new business to the town, expanding economic growth there, he added.\nWrite to Joseph De Avila at joseph.deavila@wsj.com\n 22, 2016 02:49 ET (07:49 ",

      "text": "By Alwyn Scott\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - Boeing Co <BA.N> on Monday named a senior General Electric Co <GE.N> executive to head its commercial airplanes division and announced a new services unit, in moves to capture more of the profitable market for parts and repairs after a jet is sold.\nThe changes are \"a big and important step\" toward Boeing's goal of increasing annual services revenue to about $50 billion in 10 years from about $15 billion currently, Boeing Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg said on a call with journalists.\nThe changes do not alter plans for developing aircraft, but put a new \"emphasis on generating life-cycle value,\" Muilenburg said, referring to building an aircraft with an eye to gaining revenue from servicing the plane during its decades-long life.\n\"We've always said growing services is a core part of our strategy, and now you see us emphasizing and investing accordingly,\" Muilenburg said.\nBoeing tapped Kevin McAllister, 53, to lead its $66 billion commercial airplane business, succeeding Ray Conner, 61, effective immediately.\nConner, who started as a Boeing mechanic nearly 40 years ago, will serve as vice chairman through 2017 to help with the transition, the world's biggest planemaker said.\nMcAllister has been with GE's aviation unit for nearly 30 years and knows Boeing and its customers well, Muilenburg said.\nBoeing named Stanley Deal, 52, to head the new services unit, to be known as Global Services. Deal had been senior vice president of Boeing's Commercial Aviation Services business.\nThe Global Services business is due to begin operating in the third quarter of 2017.\nMcAllister has been chief executive of GE's $8 billion aviation services business, a unit that earns much of its revenue from contracts servicing GE aircraft engines. Airlines generally pay a fee for every hour they run the engines, which covers service and maintenance.\n\"Muilenburg is shaking up BCA with a surprise outside appointment which is likely a healthy move given that fresh leadership eyes can create positive movement,\" said analyst Peter Arment from Baird Equity Research.\nLast year, Muilenburg named Leanne Caret head of the defense business. She had run Boeing's defense services business.\nNow, Muilenburg said, \"the leaders of all three of our business...all have depth of understanding of services.”\nMuilenburg said the new division headed by Deal would combine about 20,000 employees from the customer services groups within the company's existing commercial airplanes and defense, space and security businesses. It will have a small headquarters near Dallas, but most of the work will remain where it is, he added.\nSince Muilenburg took over as CEO in July 2015, Boeing has been steadily building up its services business, moves that have irked some of its partners.\nEarlier this year it ended an agreement with one of its largest suppliers, Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc <SPR.N>, effectively taking away manufacturing of profitable spare parts used in aircraft repairs.\nIt also began bringing some parts production in-house to gain control over repairs, and sifting its databases to help airlines predict when planes will need service.\nEngine repairs make up nearly half of the service market, but those are largely beyond the reach of Boeing or Airbus. Engine makers such as GE and Pratt & Whitney <UTX.N> locked up their aftermarket more than a decade ago.\nStill Boeing's aftermarket sales growth is outpacing the 4.5 percent growth of the broad aftermarket, Dennis Floyd, vice president of services strategy and business development at Boeing, told Reuters recently.\n\"That means we're taking market share,\" he said.\n(Additional reporting by Ankit Ajmera in Bengaluru; Editing by Andrew Hay and Lisa Shumaker)",

By Zacks Investment Research | Just Now (Nov 22, 2016 07:28AM ET) This article has already been saved in your Saved Items Follow \nA month has gone by since the last earnings report for General Electric (NYSE: GE ). Shares have added about 5.5 % in the past month, outperforming the S&P 500 in that time frame. \nWill the recent positive trend continue leading up to their next earnings release, or is the stock due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers. \nRecent Earnings GE Beats Q3 Earnings, Misses Revenues; 2016 View Narrowed Despite a challenging macroeconomic environment, sustained restructuring initiatives for a leaner firm with a re-focus on core operations enabled General Electric to report relatively healthy third-quarter 2016 results. GAAP net earnings for the reported quarter were $1,994 million or $0.22 a share compared with $2,506 million or $0.25 a share in the year-ago quarter. Including industrial and other verticals, operating earnings were $0.32 per share and improved 10% year over year. The operating earnings (including industrial and other verticals) for the reported quarter marginally beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by $0.01. Revenues Total consolidated revenue for the reported quarter increased 4% year over year to $29,266 million from $28,028 million in the year-earlier quarter, but missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $29,836 million. While the Industrial segment revenue increased 4% year over year to $27,421 million, GE Capital revenues declined 2% to $2,600 million. Organic revenue growth for the Industrial segment improved 1% for the quarter.Total orders for the quarter for the Industrial segment increased 16% year over year to $26.9 billion, with significant order improvements from the Renewable Energy and Energy Connections & Lighting segments, partially offset by considerable declines from Transportation and Oil & Gas. Total backlog of equipment and services at quarter-end was $319 billion, up 18% year over year. Margins, Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Owing to a highly volatile environment and sluggish growth across the globe, General Electric recorded a decline in margins in the reported quarter despite stringent cost-cutting and simplification initiatives. Industrial segment operating profit decreased 5% (organic growth down 3%) year over year to $4,320 million, with a significant fall in profits in Energy Connections & Lighting (down 84%), Oil & Gas (down 42%) and Transportation (down 18%), partially offset by a rise in profits in Renewable Energy (up 16%) and Power (up 12%). Gross margin for the Industrial segment improved 150 bps to 29.0%, while non-GAAP operating margin remained flat at 17.3%. Cash generated from operating industrial activities (excluding dividends) for the first nine months of 2016 totaled $3,368 million. Cash and marketable securities at quarter-end aggregated $98.9 billion. Outlook Narrowed General Electric aims to build upon the momentum for a healthy rise in operating profit in the next year and narrowed its earlier guidance. The company anticipates operating earnings in 2016 to be within $1.48-$1.52 a share, compared to its earlier range $1.45-$1.55. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2016 is currently pegged at $1.49 and lies comfortably within the predicted range.Organic revenue growth in 2016 is currently expected to be 0-2% compared to earlier projections of 2-4%. General Electric intends to return $30 billion to the shareholders in 2016, including $8 billion in dividends and $22 billion in share repurchases. In addition, the company expects to generate in excess of $32 billion in cash flow from operations in 2016, up from $30-$32 billion expected earlier. \nHow have estimates been moving since then? \nFollowing the release and in the last month, investors have witnessed a downward trend for fresh estimates. In the past month, there has been one revision higher for the current quarter compared to three lower. The consensus estimate has edged lower as a result, and now GE is expected to see earnings shrink by over 11.5% this quarter when compared to the year ago period. \nAs you can see in the chart below, this is starting to take a toll on the outlook, both for this year and the next: GENL ELECTRIC Price and Consensus \nGENL ELECTRIC Price and Consensus | GENL ELECTRIC Quote \nVGM Scores \nAt this time, General Electric's stock has a poor Growth score of 'F', however its momentum is doing a bit better with a 'C'. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of 'D' on the value side, putting it in the fourth quintile for this investment strategy. \nOverall, from a fundamental perspective, things aren't looking great for GE investors. As we can see, component scores are pretty weak, while the VGM score for this stock is an 'F'. \nOutlook \nWith estimates broadly trending lower and a weak fundamental position, the days of outperformance for GE may be nearing an end. It's no surprise shares of GE have a Zacks Rank # 4 (sell) and we are expecting a sluggish return from GE in the next few months. \nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "text": "Search for: Boeing taps GE exec to head airplanes unit as part of services push Boeing's logo is seen on its KC-46 Aerial refuelling operator's station demonstrator during Japan Aerospace 2016 air show in Tokyo, Japan, October 12, 2016. REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon \nNovember 22, 2016 \nBy Alwyn Scott \nNEW YORK (Reuters) – Boeing Co <BA.N> on Monday named a senior General Electric Co <GE.N> executive to head its commercial airplanes division and announced a new services unit, in moves to capture more of the profitable market for parts and repairs after a jet is sold. \nThe changes are “a big and important step” toward Boeing’s goal of increasing annual services revenue to about $50 billion in 10 years from about $15 billion currently, Boeing Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg said on a call with journalists. \nThe changes do not alter plans for developing aircraft, but put a new “emphasis on generating life-cycle value,” Muilenburg said, referring to building an aircraft with an eye to gaining revenue from servicing the plane during its decades-long life. \n“We’ve always said growing services is a core part of our strategy, and now you see us emphasizing and investing accordingly,” Muilenburg said. \nBoeing tapped Kevin McAllister, 53, to lead its $66 billion commercial airplane business, succeeding Ray Conner, 61, effective immediately. \nConner, who started as a Boeing mechanic nearly 40 years ago, will serve as vice chairman through 2017 to help with the transition, the world’s biggest planemaker said. \nMcAllister has been with GE’s aviation unit for nearly 30 years and knows Boeing and its customers well, Muilenburg said. \nBoeing named Stanley Deal, 52, to head the new services unit, to be known as Global Services. Deal had been senior vice president of Boeing’s Commercial Aviation Services business. \nThe Global Services business is due to begin operating in the third quarter of 2017. \nMcAllister has been chief executive of GE’s $8 billion aviation services business, a unit that earns much of its revenue from contracts servicing GE aircraft engines. Airlines generally pay a fee for every hour they run the engines, which covers service and maintenance. \n“Muilenburg is shaking up BCA with a surprise outside appointment which is likely a healthy move given that fresh leadership eyes can create positive movement,” said analyst Peter Arment from Baird Equity Research. \nLast year, Muilenburg named Leanne Caret head of the defense business. She had run Boeing’s defense services business. \nNow, Muilenburg said, “the leaders of all three of our business…all have depth of understanding of services.” \nMuilenburg said the new division headed by Deal would combine about 20,000 employees from the customer services groups within the company’s existing commercial airplanes and defense, space and security businesses. It will have a small headquarters near Dallas, but most of the work will remain where it is, he added. \nSince Muilenburg took over as CEO in July 2015, Boeing has been steadily building up its services business, moves that have irked some of its partners. \nEarlier this year it ended an agreement with one of its largest suppliers, Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc <SPR.N>, effectively taking away manufacturing of profitable spare parts used in aircraft repairs. \nIt also began bringing some parts production in-house to gain control over repairs, and sifting its databases to help airlines predict when planes will need service. \nEngine repairs make up nearly half of the service market, but those are largely beyond the reach of Boeing or Airbus. Engine makers such as GE and Pratt & Whitney <UTX.N> locked up their aftermarket more than a decade ago. \nStill Boeing’s aftermarket sales growth is outpacing the 4.5 percent growth of the broad aftermarket, Dennis Floyd, vice president of services strategy and business development at Boeing, told Reuters recently. \n“That means we’re taking market share,” he said. \n(Additional reporting by Ankit Ajmera in Bengaluru; Editing by Andrew Hay and Lisa Shumaker)",

      "text": "GE Stock Has Outperformed the Market Since Earnings, Can the Trend Continue? by Zacks Equity Research Published on November 21, 2016 Trades from $ 3 \nA month has gone by since the last earnings report for General Electric ( GE - Free Report ) . Shares have added about 5.5 % in the past month, outperforming the S&P 500 in that time frame. \nWill the recent positive trend continue leading up to their next earnings release, or is the stock due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers. \nRecent Earnings \nGE Beats Q3 Earnings, Misses Revenues; 2016 View Narrowed Despite a challenging macroeconomic environment, sustained restructuring initiatives for a leaner firm with a re-focus on core operations enabled General Electric to report relatively healthy third-quarter 2016 results. GAAP net earnings for the reported quarter were $1,994 million or $0.22 a share compared with $2,506 million or $0.25 a share in the year-ago quarter. Including industrial and other verticals, operating earnings were $0.32 per share and improved 10% year over year. The operating earnings (including industrial and other verticals) for the reported quarter marginally beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by $0.01. Revenues Total consolidated revenue for the reported quarter increased 4% year over year to $29,266 million from $28,028 million in the year-earlier quarter, but missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $29,836 million. While the Industrial segment revenue increased 4% year over year to $27,421 million, GE Capital revenues declined 2% to $2,600 million. Organic revenue growth for the Industrial segment improved 1% for the quarter.Total orders for the quarter for the Industrial segment increased 16% year over year to $26.9 billion, with significant order improvements from the Renewable Energy and Energy Connections & Lighting segments, partially offset by considerable declines from Transportation and Oil & Gas. Total backlog of equipment and services at quarter-end was $319 billion, up 18% year over year. Margins, Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Owing to a highly volatile environment and sluggish growth across the globe, General Electric recorded a decline in margins in the reported quarter despite stringent cost-cutting and simplification initiatives. Industrial segment operating profit decreased 5% (organic growth down 3%) year over year to $4,320 million, with a significant fall in profits in Energy Connections & Lighting (down 84%), Oil & Gas (down 42%) and Transportation (down 18%), partially offset by a rise in profits in Renewable Energy (up 16%) and Power (up 12%). Gross margin for the Industrial segment improved 150 bps to 29.0%, while non-GAAP operating margin remained flat at 17.3%. Cash generated from operating industrial activities (excluding dividends) for the first nine months of 2016 totaled $3,368 million. Cash and marketable securities at quarter-end aggregated $98.9 billion. Outlook Narrowed General Electric aims to build upon the momentum for a healthy rise in operating profit in the next year and narrowed its earlier guidance. The company anticipates operating earnings in 2016 to be within $1.48-$1.52 a share, compared to its earlier range $1.45-$1.55. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2016 is currently pegged at $1.49 and lies comfortably within the predicted range.Organic revenue growth in 2016 is currently expected to be 0-2% compared to earlier projections of 2-4%. General Electric intends to return $30 billion to the shareholders in 2016, including $8 billion in dividends and $22 billion in share repurchases. In addition, the company expects to generate in excess of $32 billion in cash flow from operations in 2016, up from $30-$32 billion expected earlier. \n\nHow have estimates been moving since then? \nFollowing the release and in the last month, investors have witnessed a downward trend for fresh estimates. In the past month, there has been one revision higher for the current quarter compared to three lower. The consensus estimate has edged lower as a result, and now GE is expected to see earnings shrink by over 11.5% this quarter when compared to the year ago period. \nAs you can see in the chart below, this is starting to take a toll on the outlook, both for this year and the next:",

      "text": "Seattle: Boeing Co. is turning to an outsider to head the commercial aeroplanes division, replacing Ray Conner with Kevin McAllister, a 27-year veteran of General Electric Co.’s aviation business.\nMcAllister, 53, the former chief executive officer of GE Aviation Services, assumed the leadership of Boeing’s largest business on Monday, according to a statement by the plane maker. Conner, 61, who notified Boeing of his retirement last week, will serve as vice-chairman through 2017.\nThe plane maker also promoted Stan Deal to the role of president and CEO of Boeing Global Services, a new division that combines customer service groups within the company’s commercial aeroplane and defence businesses.\nThe moves are the latest in a series of management changes since Dennis Muilenburg became Boeing’s CEO last year. The Chicago-based company announced October 14 that Ihssane Mounir would replace John Wojick in early 2017 as chief aeroplane salesman.\nDeal, 52, a deputy of Conner’s, had served as senior vice-president of Boeing’s Commercial Aviation Services business since 2014. Muilenburg had signalled earlier that Boeing would focus on expanding its high-margin services offerings, which range from providing spare parts to round-the-clock maintenance.",

      "text": "| License Photo Sign up for our Energy newsletter \nMILAN, Italy, Nov. 22 (UPI) -- Italian energy company Eni said Tuesday it would work through a partnership with General Electric to build a stronger portfolio in the renewable energy sector. \nEni said it aims to work with GE on a wide range of projects tied to low-carbon power options like solar power and wind. \n\"Through this partnership, Eni aims to enhance its ability to implement projects in the renewable energy sector,\" the Italian company said in a statement. \nGE had no public statement on the agreement with Eni. Last week, a marine division of GE said it would work with Danish energy company Maersk Drilling on a pilot program to use advanced digital technology for drilling operations. The collaboration with Maersk came less than a month after the oil and gas division of GE acquired a 62.5 percent stake in oilfield services company Baker Hughes. \nGE's oil and gas business has built up its position through acquisitions so that it's now one of the stronger divisions within the parent company. Last week, however, the company said that in British waters alone, there's $25 million committed to tidal power . \nEni said it's been working in the renewable energy sector since the 1980s. In September, it said it was extending its pioneering work in Algeria by becoming the first company to wade into the solar energy field. \n\"This agreement [with GE], which is part of Eni's strategy of developing renewable energy by leveraging on the industrial and commercial synergies of its traditional activities, will help Eni to pursue the progressive decarbonization of its energy mix,\" the company said.",

      "text": "GE Adds Two Startups to Industrial Internet Push \nOracle has been building its cloud computing business and pushing into the infrastructure-as-a-service market (IaaS), which provides computing and storage resources on demand over the web. Adding Dyn’s “best-in-class DNS solution,” Oracle said, will provide enterprise customers with a one-stop shop for IaaS and platform-as-a-service (PaaS). \n“Oracle already offers enterprise-class IaaS and PaaS for companies building and running Internet applications and cloud services,” Thomas Kurian, Oracle’s president of product development, said in a news release. “Dyn’s immensely scalable and global DNS is a critical core component and a natural extension to our cloud computing platform.” \nThe financial terms of the deal were not disclosed. \nDyn was founded in 2001 as Dynamic Network Services Inc., growing out of a project of students from Worcester Polytechnic Institute. It was hit by a large-scale internet attack in October that left dozens of popular websites unreachable for parts of the day. \n“Despite that attack, the DNS service provided by Dyn is very valuable to Oracle’s future in the cloud,” TechRepublic said. \nAs The Wall Street Journal reports, Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison said at the company’s annual developer conference in September that “it would move aggressively into the [IaaS] market, challenging Amazon’s leadership in businesses where Oracle barely registers now.” \nAmazon Web Services has its own domain-name service called Amazon Route 53. \n“Oracle’s building out its IaaS and PaaS offerings as quickly as possible,” Forrester analyst Dave Bartoletti told TechRepublic. “AWS has a strong and popular DNS service in Route 53. It’s an essential element, and Oracle can buy its way in quickly with Dyn.” Post navigation ",

      "title": "GE Workers To Vote On New Contract That Slashes Hourly Wages",
      "text": "The logo of U.S. conglomerate General Electric: REUTERS/Vincent Kessler 5340100 \nFollowing months of negotiations, 4,000 GE employees at a Kentucky-based facility will vote on a new labor deal between the company and it’s workers. \nThe employees, represented by the International Union of Electronic, Electrical, Salaried, Machine and Furniture Workers – Communications Workers of America (IUE-CWA) Local 83761, have been negotiating with the company for months following Qingdao-Haier’s purchase of the appliance business from General Electric this past winter. \nChina-based Qingdao Haier Co. bought the GE appliance operation in Louisville, Kentucky, for $5.4 billion. The company has asserted that cost cutting measures must be taken in order to stay competitive. \nThe tentative four-year contract decreases hourly wage salaries for future employees and restructures overtime and work rules. Under the proposed contract, new employees would start at $12 an hour, $3.52 less than entry-level hires currently make. \nInstead of a salary increase, workers will receive $5,500 in annual increments starting in January under the deal. The company also pledged to invest $90 million into four manufacturing buildings at the Kentucky-facility. \nThe proposal would mean that new workers would spend their first year in what is called a “flexible workforce pool.” Once a regular position becomes available, the employee would shift over to full-time and would receive $14 per hour and benefits. \nThe proposal would also alter overtime payment rules. Currently, employees earn 1.5 times their hourly rate after eight hours. Under the new contract, workers would receive 1.5 times their hourly rate after completing 40 hours in a seven day work week. \nNew employees would receive 50 cents an hour more for working second and third shifts, which is less than the additional 10 percent that employees hired prior to Jan. 1, 2012 now receive for picking up evening and overnight shifts. \nThe contract would also eliminate bumping and would increase the company’s 401K contribution. \nGE said that the proposed deal would bring its pay and labor practices in line with others in the industry. GE’s Appliance Park is losing money, according to GE spokesperson Kim Freeman. “We desperately need to turn (that) around,” she said, adding that “This contract is much more in line with our competitors.” \nThe union’s president acknowledged that some members remain unhappy with the proposal, but defended the agreement. “There’s a lot of good out of what some are seeing as a bad contract,” Dana Crittenden, IUE-CWA Local 83761 president, told the Courier-Journal . \nSend Tips to [email protected] .

      "title": "GE’s Kevin McAllister named president and CEO of Boeing’s Commercial Airplanes unit | Q13 FOX News",
      "text": "GE’s Kevin McAllister named president and CEO of Boeing’s Commercial Airplanes unit Kevin McAllister \nSEATTLE — Boeing named General Electric executive Kevin McAllister as the head of its Commercial Airplanes unit Monday as part of a corporate reorganization that will add a third pillar to its sprawling aerospace business. \nBoeing intends to elevate its airplane services arm to be a major division on the level of its two premier divisions: defense and space, and commercial airplanes. \nThe reorganization was unveiled Monday along with the announcement that chief executive of Boeing’s commercial airplanes unit, Ray Conner, 61, is leaving the post, effective immediately. Boeing said Conner will continue to serve as Boeing vice chairman through 2017. \nConner will be succeeded by McAllister, 53, who leaves as head of GE’s Aviation services business. \nThe new Boeing Global Services unit will be headed by company veteran Stan Deal, 52, who currently runs Boeing’s commercial aviation services business. \nThe creation of the new dedicated services division has been a longtime ambition for the aerospace giant. Boeing, best known for building jetliners, fighter jets, rockets and satellites, has sought to diversify away from the ups and downs of manufacturing and tap into the steady revenue that comes from servicing aircraft throughout their multi-decade lifetime. \n“Substantial services growth is core to Boeing’s strategy,” said Dennis Muilenburg, Boeing’s chief executive. \nSelling services and spare parts to airlines, maintenance shops and governments is an increasingly lucrative business for the company. The company has plotted a steep expansion of its services business aiming to more than triple sales to about $50 billion by 2025, from an estimated $15 billion in 2015, according to Muilenburg. \nBoeing has less than 10% market share in the services operations at both its civil and defense aerospace businesses, providing “ample room to grow,” he said. \nMuilenburg said the new services unit would be up and running in the third quarter of 2017 and based in Dallas. \nBoeing’s push into the spare parts business threatens to further destabilize the business models of many of its own suppliers. Boeing’s own suppliers rely on selling parts at a steep markup to airlines and other buyers to offset the lowest prices that plane makers receive when building airplanes on the assembly line. \nMcAllister inherits a host of challenges at Boeing, including steep production ramp ups of its updated single-aisle 737 Max aircraft and introduction of its long-range 777X jetliner in 2020. McAllister will also helm Boeing as it weighs designing an all-new medium-range aircraft that wouldn’t be ready until around 2025. \nConner, a 39-year Boeing veteran who started as a mechanic building 727s and rose to company vice chairman, will retire at the end of 2017. \nIn a letter to employees, Conner said he would continue to “stay engaged in the ongoing product strategy work that will shape the future of our airplane family.” \nThe Boeing Commercial Airplanes CEO role is as much an executive position as it is a U.S. diplomatic role, acting as a highly-visible figure representing the U.S.’s largest exporter at airlines around the globe. The appointment also further cements the relationship between Boeing and GE, which supplies most of its jet engines. Muilenburg’s predecessor, Jim McNerney, came to Boeing from GE and retired in March. \nMcAllister’s appointment as head of Boeing’s commercial business is also a break with tradition. It marks the first time the company has tapped an outsider for that top job. \n“He’s a great partner of Boeing, he knows us well,” said Muilenburg. ",

      "text": "How to Invest in Infrastructure After the Election GE, MLM are poised for strong profits. By Leslie Thompson | Contributor Nov. 22, 2016, at 10:17 a.m. Stocks mentioned in this story: GE , MLM , AAPL \nOnce again, the political landscape is promising to increase spending on infrastructure to rebuild our cities, improve our air and water quality, stimulate the economy, and otherwise improve the quality of our lives. This promise has been made often, and while it is hard to dispute the need for such enhancements, little has changed to improve our situation. \nOnce every four years, the American Society of Civil Engineers produces a comprehensive assessment of the nation's major infrastructure categories in the ASCE's Report Card for America's Infrastructure. The last report card was issued in 2013. At that time, America's cumulative grade for infrastructure came in at a D+. In the time that has passed since it was issued, public construction spending as a percentage of GDP has declined precipitously. \n[See: 7 of the Best Stocks to Buy for 2017 .] \nIt should be noted that infrastructure encompasses a broad area, including transportation and water (primarily publicly financed), and telecommunications and electricity distribution (primarily privately financed). Given the real need to spend to improve infrastructure across the world, many diverse companies, such as General Electric Co. (ticker: GE ) and Martin Marietta Materials ( MLM ), should benefit from an increase in spending. \nGeneral Electric is one of the largest and most diversified industrial firms in the world, with products and services ranging from aircraft engines, power generation, water processing and household appliances. While the advanced economies of the world have largely committed to clean energy, China and India have also concluded that clean energy is in their best interest. First, clean energy can reduce a country's energy imports. Second, clean energy and electric vehicles can dramatically improve air quality in densely populated Asian cities, such as Beijing, Shanghai and New Delhi. Finally, companies like Apple ( AAPL ) are increasingly demanding that their suppliers source their power from clean energy sources, so export dependent countries need to upgrade to a clean energy infrastructure to maintain their competitiveness. \nAccording to the International Energy Agency, renewables and natural gas generation will be the two fastest-growing sources of power generation by 2040. General Electric generates one-third of the company's revenues and profits from power, water, renewable energy, oil, gas and energy connections. Tangentially the rail transportation and aviation segments stand to benefit from upgrades to lower emission engines. \n[See: What 8 CEOs Are Saying About Donald Trump's Victory .] \nWall Street analysts are projecting long-term earnings per share growth of 9.6 percent for General Electric versus 6 percent for the Standard & Poor's 500 index. General Electric offers a 3.25 percent dividend yield , which also should grow with earnings over time. The company has invested aggressively in big data and 3D printing to help manage their costs, improve the quality of their products, and most importantly, to help predict product reliability issues on behalf of their clients to better manage downtime. \nGeneral Electric has invested well ahead of their competitors in predictive analytics, which may lead to market share gains over time and an expected earnings growth rate in excess of current consensus of 9.6 percent. \nAfter several years of 4 percent growth from 2002 to 2015, public sector infrastructure growth is expected to accelerate to 6 percent by 2020. With strong bipartisan support, Congress recently passed the Fix America Surface Transportation Act in December of 2015 to shore up highway spending for the next five years. A prime beneficiary of this spending is Martin Marietta Materials, the second-largest producer of aggregates products (crushed stone, sand and gravel) in the U.S. The firm's aggregates business also includes asphalt products, ready mixed concrete and road paving operations. \nMartin Marietta revenues from the public sector generate approximately 40 percent of sales. The nonresidential sector generates an additional 31 percent of sales and is well positioned in faster growing states. Residential generates 19 percent of sales and should benefit from the tremendous pent-up demand for single-family homes after the financial crisis. Macro drivers aside, Martin Marietta has strategically located its mines in the lower half of the U.S. to benefit from this region's population growth and relatively low transportation costs. Furthermore, because of limited competition, the company could raise prices as demand increases. \nOverall, Martin Marietta is expected to generate 10.2 percent annual revenue growth and 30.4 percent EBITDA growth through 2020. The company pays a $1.60 per share dividend, which is likely to grow 5 percent per year. The company will also be using free-cash flow plus debt to aggressively repurchase stock. The stock is currently trading at 22.8 times next 12-month earnings and 17 times 2018 earnings. \nAs noted, the infrastructure sector is broad, so investors need to be educated on the many areas to invest in. However, one thing is for sure: There is opportunity to be had in his area with the infrastructure enhancements around the globe. \nDisclosure: Leslie Thompson and clients of Spectrum Management Group own GE stock.

      "text": "Trump May Negatively Impact 'American Icon' General Electric Nov.22.16 Summary \nGE has outperformed the S&P post-election. \nEarning the majority of its earnings overseas, GE may be negatively impacted by tariffs, a stronger dollar and \"targeted retaliation\". \nIncreased interests rates will negatively impact a company that has averaged more than $40 billion in net borrowings in recent years. General Electric (NYSE: GE ) is one of the iconic names of American industry. The Company, boasting a $271 billion market cap and $411 billion enterprise value is the tenth largest public company. Since November 7 (immediately prior to the U.S. election), GE has outperformed the S&P 500 by almost 3%, increasing 5.8%. Click to enlarge Source: TDAmeritrade I believe in the market euphoria over Trump's election, investors are ignoring the likely negatives GE will face from the new administration. Trade Barriers and Tariffs Trump's platform loudly called for tariffs and competitive retaliation against both countries and companies. In 2015, GE derived 55% of its sales revenue from outside the U.S.; this number should be higher in 2016 and beyond reflecting the acquisition of Alstom. Like Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), GE is considered a flagship U.S. company, and will be subject to targeted retaliation (above and beyond general trade barriers). The impact on revenues and backlog is hard to predict, however, it would be hard to envision a scenario where increased tariffs and/or a trade war would be anything but negative for GE. Currency While not as dramatic, as the rise of the U.S. dollar in in 2014, the U.S. dollar has appreciated about 4% and 6% against the Euro and Yen, respectively, as well as against other relevant currencies in the post-election period. Source: Investing.com As recently as late October, GE was suggesting the impact of a strong dollar would have less of an impact on earnings. If 60% of earnings are derived outside of the U.S., a 4% increase in the dollar would, assuming geographically proportionate earnings, cut earnings by 2.0% (assuming a 15% tax rate in 2017) or +/- $0.03/share. With over $90 billion in cash, and $50 billion in net assets on the most recent balance sheet, GE would have to mark-to-market reduced values of assets held overseas. For example, if GE had $20 billion in Euros, a 4% decline in that currencies value would drive a $800 million hit to the income statement. Citibank, as reported in the Wall Street Journal , projects the Euro to fall to $0.98/€ in the next 6-t-12 months. A fall of this magnitude would reflect a 10% impact on non-US earnings. Interest Rates As readers know, we have been in a period of historically low interest rates. Post-election, the yield on the U.S. 10 year has increased by about 50 basis points. Over the past three years, GE has averaged about $40 billion in net borrowings. If GE had to pay an increased 0.5% on $40 billion in borrowings, earnings will drop $0.20/share (assuming a 15% tax rate in 2017 and 8.6 billion shares). Potential Positives There are of course, potential positives from Trump's likely legislative agenda. Cash Repatriation GE had, as of September 30, 2016, over $90 billion in cash on the Company's Balance Sheet. If legislation is changed, enabling cash held overseas to be repatriated at a lower tax rate, GE would book a non-cash income statement benefit. This cash could be used for dividends or stock buy-backs. Reduction in Corporate Tax Rate A decrease in the U.S. tax rate would also benefit GE, directly for U.S. profits and to the extent the rate would drop to source country tax rate for overseas profits. GE is projected by Credit Suisse to pay between 14% and 15% in taxes (up from 12% in 2015 where GE Capital held down overall taxes). Given the relatively low net rate, the impact of a drop in U.S. tax rate is likely to be muted. Conclusion GE is an exciting stock in the midst of an exciting transition to a technology-driven industrial company. While I am long to the stock (acquired in October 2016, after selling in late 2015), I am concerned the recent post-election run-up fails to consider the negatives associated with the Trump Presidency. Specifically, trade restrictions, a stronger U.S. dollar and higher interest rates will all have non-insignificant impacts on GE's earnings and hence its stock price. It is my opinion that the market has not properly considered these negatives in the wake of euphoria about lower U.S. tax rates and a more favorable domestic environment.

      "text": "Boeing is turning to an outsider for the first time to head the commercial airplanes division, replacing Ray Conner with Kevin McAllister, a 27-year veteran of General Electric 's aviation business.\nMcAllister, 53, the former chief executive officer of GE Aviation Services, assumed the leadership of Boeing's largest business on Monday, according to a statement by the planemaker. Conner, 61, will stay on as vice chairman through 2017.\nThe company also promoted Stan Deal to the role of president and CEO of Boeing Global Services, creating a third division that combines customer-service groups within the commercial airplane and defense units. Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg sees the potential to build a $50 billion business by bolstering service offerings, from providing spare parts to conducting round-the-clock maintenance.\n\"We've always said that growing services was a key part of our strategy,\" Muilenburg told reporters during a conference call Monday. The latest leadership changes underscore that \"actions follow words,\" he said.\nA trip back in time, from the newest Boeing 747-8 Intercontinental to the original 747.\nMuilenburg, who took over last year, has made a series of management shifts that place the company's largest businesses under executives with backgrounds in services.\nThe latest move reshapes the manufacturer's largest business with new leadership amid a turbulent market for commercial aircraft. The Chicago-based company announced Oct. 14 that Ihssane Mounir would replace the retiring John Wojick, a key Conner deputy, early next year as chief airplane salesman.\nWith McAllister, Boeing gains an executive with deep ties to airlines worldwide, including some who are exclusively Airbus Group SE customers, and a reputation for using data to analyze airlines' wants and needs. He'd been viewed as a potential successor to David Joyce, who heads GE Aviation and is a vice chairman, said Rick Kennedy, a spokesman for GE.\nMcAllister has been GE's \"face\" to all of its airline customers for 15 years, first leading the sales team and more recently as the head of the unit selling long-term service contracts and spare parts. The business is a major source of profit for GE, accumulating a backlog of services worth more than $120 billion, Kennedy said.\nJoe Sutter, father of Boeing's 747 jumbo jet, dies at 95 Julie Johnsson Joe Sutter, the Boeing engineer who ushered in the modern era of long-range travel by spearheading the 747 jumbo jet in the 1960s, has died. He was 95.\n\"Joe lived an amazing life and was an inspiration - not just to those of us at Boeing, but to the entire aerospace industry,\" Ray Conner, chief...\nJoe Sutter, the Boeing engineer who ushered in the modern era of long-range travel by spearheading the 747 jumbo jet in the 1960s, has died. He was 95.\n\"Joe lived an amazing life and was an inspiration - not just to those of us at Boeing, but to the entire aerospace industry,\" Ray Conner, chief...\n(Julie Johnsson) McAllister is a \"very solid guy with a great background in aviation,\" said Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst at Teal Group in Fairfax, Virginia. \"He's a big customer and part of their biggest industrial partner company, too. That's a unique combination.\"\nA materials engineer by training and University of Pittsburgh graduate, McAllister will be the first outsider to lead Boeing Commercial Airplanes since the unit was formed in 1965. The company selected McAllister after considering a mix of external and internal candidates to succeed Conner.\nMcAllister has worked closely with Boeing over the years, Muilenburg said. \"I'm not sure I'd call him an outsider,\" the CEO said. \"He's been very, very close to us for a couple of decades.\"\nWhile McAllister masters the nuances of Boeing's culture and works to earn the respect of its factory workers and engineers, he also will face crucial product-strategy decisions. Perhaps the most critical is the call expected next year on Boeing's first all-new airplane since the 787 Dreamliner: a new plane family aimed at the market gap between Boeing's largest single-aisle and smallest twin-aisle jetliners.\nThrough his role at GE, McAllister \"saw both the challenges and failures of the 787,\" Howard Rubel, an aerospace analyst at Jefferies, said by phone. \"So, he knows how hard it is to run an airplane company. He saw how hard it was to launch a new engine.\"\nBoeing's 747 jumbo snags a $5.3 billion lifeline from UPS Julie Johnsson and Michael Sasso Boeing's 747 jumbo jet may have won a reprieve from an uncertain future as United Parcel Service agreed to buy at least 14 freighters -- the biggest order in almost nine years.\nThe deal for 747-8 aircraft, valued at $5.3 billion based on list prices and fueled by UPS's international expansion,...\nBoeing's 747 jumbo jet may have won a reprieve from an uncertain future as United Parcel Service agreed to buy at least 14 freighters -- the biggest order in almost nine years.\nThe deal for 747-8 aircraft, valued at $5.3 billion based on list prices and fueled by UPS's international expansion,...\n(Julie Johnsson and Michael Sasso) McAllister also will be under pressure to bolster margins as the planemaker slows production of the 777, its second-largest source of profit. He may also have to navigate potential fall-out from the economic penalties President-elect Donald Trump has threatened to impose on China, Boeing's largest overseas market.\nConner has served as corporate vice chairman since 2013, and president and CEO of commercial airplanes since 2012. A 39-year Boeing veteran, he led the division during an era of historic jetliner sales, then warned workers that tougher times and cost reductions lay ahead. During his watch, record output at Boeing's factories boosted the segment's revenue to $66 billion, up 34 percent from 2012.\nHe is a throwback, known for close ties forged with customers as the planemaker's former sales chief. A native of Burien, Washington, a working-class suburb south of Seattle, Conner joined his father and brother at Boeing in 1977, landing a job as a mechanic building 727 jetliners.\nConner will help smooth the transition to a new generation of leaders, Muilenburg said, while helping Deal knit together the government and commercial services businesses. Conner will also stay \"engaged in our product development activities, including the production transformation under way,\" Muilenburg said.\nDeal, 52, who was rumored to be an heir to Conner, had served as senior vice-president of Boeing's Commercial Aviation Services business since 2014. His new business will have about 20,000 employees and will maintain a headquarters staff of a \"couple dozen\" in Dallas.\nThe lines between Deal's new unit and Boeing airplane and defense divisions will be blurry in places, with some customer-facing groups staying in place inside the current business units.\nDeal's current operation has more than 12,000 employees and provides airlines and leasing companies with wide ranging support services, from maintenance training to digital crew scheduling. Another 13,000 employees support military and government customers worldwide.",

      "title": "Boeing taps GE veteran for jet unit as CEO extends shake-up",
      "text": "Boeing is turning to an outsider for the first time to head the commercial airplanes division, replacing Ray Conner with Kevin McAllister, a 27-year veteran of General Electric's aviation business.\nMcAllister, 53, the former chief executive officer of GE Aviation Services, assumed the leadership of Boeing's largest business on Monday, according to a statement by the planemaker. Conner, 61, will stay on as vice chairman through 2017.\nThe company also promoted Stan Deal to the role of president and CEO of Boeing Global Services, creating a third division that combines customer-service groups within the commercial airplane and defense units. Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg sees the potential to build a $50 billion business by bolstering service offerings, from providing spare parts to conducting round-the-clock maintenance.\n\"We've always said that growing services was a key part of our strategy,\" Muilenburg told reporters during a conference call Monday. The latest leadership changes underscore that \"actions follow words,\" he said.\nMuilenburg, who took over last year, has made a series of management shifts that place the company's largest businesses under executives with backgrounds in services.\nThe latest move reshapes the manufacturer's largest business with new leadership amid a turbulent market for commercial aircraft. The Chicago-based company announced Oct. 14 that Ihssane Mounir would replace the retiring John Wojick, a key Conner deputy, early next year as chief airplane salesman.\nWith McAllister, Boeing gains an executive with deep ties to airlines worldwide, including some who are exclusively Airbus Group SE customers, and a reputation for using data to analyze airlines' wants and needs. He'd been viewed as a potential successor to David Joyce, who heads GE Aviation and is a vice chairman, said Rick Kennedy, a spokesman for GE.\nMcAllister has been GE's \"face\" to all of its airline customers for 15 years, first leading the sales team and more recently as the head of the unit selling long-term service contracts and spare parts. The business is a major source of profit for GE, accumulating a backlog of services worth more than $120 billion, Kennedy said.\nMcAllister is a \"very solid guy with a great background in aviation,\" said Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst at Teal Group in Fairfax, Virginia. \"He's a big customer and part of their biggest industrial partner company, too. That's a unique combination.\"\nA materials engineer by training and University of Pittsburgh graduate, McAllister will be the first outsider to lead Boeing Commercial Airplanes since the unit was formed in 1965. The company selected McAllister after considering a mix of external and internal candidates to succeed Conner.\nMcAllister has worked closely with Boeing over the years, Muilenburg said. \"I'm not sure I'd call him an outsider,\" the CEO said. \"He's been very, very close to us for a couple of decades.\"\nWhile McAllister masters the nuances of Boeing's culture and works to earn the respect of its factory workers and engineers, he also will face crucial product-strategy decisions. Perhaps the most critical is the call expected next year on Boeing's first all-new airplane since the 787 Dreamliner: a new plane family aimed at the market gap between Boeing's largest single-aisle and smallest twin-aisle jetliners.\nThrough his role at GE, McAllister \"saw both the challenges and failures of the 787,\" Howard Rubel, an aerospace analyst at Jefferies, said by phone. \"So, he knows how hard it is to run an airplane company. He saw how hard it was to launch a new engine.\"\nMcAllister also will be under pressure to bolster margins as the planemaker slows production of the 777, its second-largest source of profit. He may also have to navigate potential fall-out from the economic penalties President-elect Donald Trump has threatened to impose on China, Boeing's largest overseas market.\nConner has served as corporate vice chairman since 2013, and president and CEO of commercial airplanes since 2012. A 39-year Boeing veteran, he led the division during an era of historic jetliner sales, then warned workers that tougher times and cost reductions lay ahead. During his watch, record output at Boeing's factories boosted the segment's revenue to $66 billion, up 34 percent from 2012.\nHe is a throwback, known for close ties forged with customers as the planemaker's former sales chief. A native of Burien, Washington, a working-class suburb south of Seattle, Conner joined his father and brother at Boeing in 1977, landing a job as a mechanic building 727 jetliners.\nConner will help smooth the transition to a new generation of leaders, Muilenburg said, while helping Deal knit together the government and commercial services businesses. Conner will also stay \"engaged in our product development activities, including the production transformation under way,\" Muilenburg said.\nDeal, 52, who was rumored to be an heir to Conner, had served as senior vice-president of Boeing's Commercial Aviation Services business since 2014. His new business will have about 20,000 employees and will maintain a headquarters staff of a \"couple dozen\" in Dallas.\nThe lines between Deal's new unit and Boeing airplane and defense divisions will be blurry in places, with some customer-facing groups staying in place inside the current business units.\nDeal's current operation has more than 12,000 employees and provides airlines and leasing companies with wide ranging support services, from maintenance training to digital crew scheduling. Another 13,000 employees support military and government customers worldwide.\n ",

      "text": "GE union members vote down new contract 2016-11-23T00:01:14Z Biography GE union members voted down a new contract with the company on Tuesday. (Source: Stephen Richard/WAVE 3 News) \nLOUISVILLE, KY (WAVE) - A vital part of Louisville's workforce voted Tuesday to determine if they have a new contract deal. \nSome 4,000 workers from GE's Appliance Park denied the contract from their new China-based owner Haier. \nBefore the vote, union officials told WAVE 3 News it was a tough decision to consider with no raises in the deal. But, they reminded workers this is a new time and they're not negotiating with GE anymore. \n\"We just hope that however this turns out, it’s for the better,\" said President of Local 83761, IUE-CWA Dana Crittenden. \nBus after bus of GE workers took turns voting on their livelihoods. \n>> PREVIOUS STORY: GE union members voting on new contract \nThe 4-year contract from new owner Haier was not so well received. Cutbacks on overtime and seniority combined with no raises was a tough pill to swallow, as rising health costs are eventually coming to worker's benefits. \n\"We got members out here that's been struggling at $15.51 an hour with increases under GE toward the benefits,\" Crittenden said. \"So, it's just a very emotional time.\" \nCrittenden said starting worker pay would have dropped from about $15.51 an hour to $12. \nWe saw several workers giving a thumbs down during the vote, others wore their dislike for the deal with homemade T-shirts stating \"Vote No.\" \nMORE FROM WAVE3.COM \nBut the alternative of striking during the holidays with a new and uncertain company isn't much of one. \n\"It's been three months of negotiating,\" said Kim Freeman, a spokeswoman for the company. \nIn the agreement, the company sought keeping wages the same and offering workers a total of $5,500 over the next three years in place of raises and what it called a strong benefits package. \nThe company maintains it has not only lost millions, but is investing millions in Louisville's Appliance Park. \n\"We designed a contract that is going to allow us to better compete in the appliance industry and that's really important,\" Freeman said. \nUnion officials said earlier on Tuesday if the contract was voted down, they will sit down with the negotiating team and request bargaining again from the company and hopefully go forward. \nGE sent WAVE 3 News a statement after the vote. It reads as follows: We are extremely disappointed that our employees did not vote to accept the proposed four-year contract that was endorsed by the IUE-CWA and GE Appliances’ leadership. The contract, which took 14 weeks of thoughtful negotiations by both the Union and Company, is a solid plan that will provide good wages and benefits for our employees and makes changes that are essential to the ongoing operation of Appliance Park. A workforce that is unwilling to change to improve our operations and cost position could deter future investments in Appliance Park. While it is our desire to continue to manufacture at the Park, we cannot do it to the detriment of our customers and the overall business. GE Appliances has put together a comprehensive and fair package. The Company will talk with the Union upon request. \nCopyright 2016 WAVE 3 News. All rights reserved. WAVE 3 News NEWS More>>",

      "text": "I erased the GAU/19A because there's already a page. Drjuki 13:46, 22 June 2009 (UTC) [ edit ] Far too many false positives. \n\"Everything with rotating barrels\" is not a sensible definition to use when addressing whether it's in video games or not. Dongs 12:40, 23 June 2009 (UTC) [ edit ] Handheld variant discussion: \nIs it at all plausible? I realize the recoil would be astronomical, but wouldn't the weight of the gun itself dampen it a bit? And if it is plausible, would it at all be useful in a combat situation? That's One Angry Duck 04:57, 28 November 2010 (UTC) Short answer: No. Long answer: N . Descriptive Answer: You still need to factor in the weight of the amount of ammo needed to be effective. 2,000 rounds of 7.62 NATO would weigh over 100 pounds. At the high end, 6,000 rpm, that's 20 seconds of firepower. Low end, say 1,250 rpm as seen in Predator , that's about a minute and a half worth of ammo. Then there's the power supply. Think how much a heavy duty car battery weighs. The gun would require something that provides alot of electrical power/torque to operate. So the weight of the gun + weight of the ammo + weight of the batteries + force of recoil = N . See the Predator page for more info. Also, if you are not going to be moving because the gun and ammo are stationary, why would you fire the gun by hand instead of having it on a fixed stand?-- Gunkatas 06:01, 28 November 2010 (UTC \nIt would be very convienent to have a 6,000 RPM chainsaw in your hands at any time, but we can only watch movies that make them this way. Maybe making it fire in some sort of burst would make it conservative in the way of ammunition, but then there is always the weight issue with ammunition. There would have to be some sort of lightweight special ammo made for it, anyway it would be to much trouble to even bother making such a weapon. CZAR 00:32, 28 November. What if a second man in a two-man crew carried all the ammo, and the other guy just held the gun? That's One Angry Duck 18:15, 28 November 2010 (UTC) Say there was a second guy to carry all the ammo and extra batteries. Fine. How well coordinated would those two have to be in order to be effective in the field? Let's say that it's a two man team, one carrying the gun, one carrying everthing else. With the current system, the second guy would be carrying his own weight in gear (clothes, body armor, ammo, water, etc...) and would not likely have a weapon of his own, except maybe a handgun. They would also have to be extermely coordinated in their movements all the time. If the guy with the gun makes a quick 180 degree turn, the guy with the ammo would have to be at least twice as fast or else everything would get tangled. Also, the length of the feed and power cables would have to be short enough not to get stuck in anything, but long enough so that the two people can maneuver. For this to actually work, you would need two people that would move and react at the same speed in the same way every time. That's alot of hassle when you can just equip those two with two LMGs like the M249 or a single GPMG like the M240. -- Gunkatas 17:22, 29 November 2010 (UTC) Consider that the Dillion needs 24VDC and 58amps to run. A couple of aircraft batteries with sufficient amperage to operate the motor weigh about 125-180 pounds. Hand-held isn't plausible. You'd need two men to carry ammo and batteries, and they wouldn't be able to do much more than struggle to walk along. Forget running with it. At best, it could be crew-served, with a four-man team pulling stuff on a cart. The hand held Minigun we used in G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra and Transformers 2 was a self contained unit with ammo, fire control and battery mounted in the backpack. But it is impossible to fire the weapon live due to the rapid muzzle climb using live ammunition. -- phoenixent 13:52, 18 November 2011 (CST) \nI know that the last time they publicly sold the Predator/T2 minigun it had a set of Live barrels in addition to the blanked ones. I'm not sure how much live ammo that has gone through that particular weapon but I do know that the weapon's lower than normal rate of fire (1,250RPM, according to it's last sales add). would put it in the same recoil energy as something like a HK21E or a FN MAG that someone has cranked open the gas port. Difficult to control but not impossible.Still any minigun with a 2,000-4,000rpm gearbox is a strictly mounted proposition. Rockwolf66 02:15, 19 November 2011 (CST) Do you actually need special barrels to make a minigun fire blanks as it is electrically driven rather than gas/recoil, or is it more of a safety/legality thing the ensure there is no way it can fire live rounds? -- commando552 04:52, 19 November 2011 (CST) You do not need special blank only barrels for the minigun to work on blanks. As for the reduced rpm on the Predator/T2 minigun is that Stembridge had to replace the motor after Predator with a 12v variant and that in turn gave the weapon a lower fire rate. The hand held unit I built for GI Joe was tested with the self contained pack at Dillion with live rounds and was completely impossible to control due to the quick muzzle climb.-- phoenixent 11:27, 19 November 2011 (CST) Wait so you are saying that the gun had an origional Minigun motor while filming Predator? I guess that's what I get for getting my information through an intermediary rather than directly questioning someone who worked on the weapon in question. Really I should start picking the brains of Steve, Al and whoever else I can find who's built or worked on a handheld Minigun in a Hollywood feature and then get all of this information down as it's really interesting and it will kill alot of videogame myths. Rockwolf66 20:19, 19 November 2011 (CST) That correct so that is why you see a different rate of fire on Predator comparied to T2. Hope this helped you out... -- phoenixent 21:25, 19 November 2011 (CST) The Predator minigun wasn't running at full speed either, from everything I've heard on the subject. If it was you wouldn't be able to see the barrels turning when it fired (as I recall that was the reason the RoF was reduced to begin with, because the director thought it would look better on camera). Evil Tim 21:43, 19 November 2011 (CST) That had more to due with the camera film speed then the motor on the Minigun. -- phoenixent 09:46, 14 December 2011 (CST) Um...Even if Predator was shot with some kind of high-speed camera I'd have thought it wouldn't matter since it was still screened at 24 frames per second. IIRC (going off an article in Total Film magazine) wasn't it that they reduced the RoF in Predator by gearing it down rather than altering the motor itself? Evil Tim 10:03, 14 December 2011 (CST) The high-speed cameras are used to slow down action and increase screen time when viewed at 24 frames per second. Most automatic weapon fire is not fully captured on film due to camera speed vs. fire rate. Also you can gear a minigun down but that is not the reason for the difference in fire rate on the Stembridge minigun used on Predator and then Terminator 2 -- phoenixent 12:53, 19 December 2011 (CST) I think I once saw a YouTube video featuring GE M134 without flash hider, but with a hand-held configuration, it was on some kind of tripod too. As I can remember I think it was in Knob Creek shooting range... There was also a .22LR Browning M1919. I'll try to find the mysterious video again. TitaniumAlloy ( talk ) 12:14, 23 November 2013 (EST) \nWould it be possible to use a Minigun chambered in pistol/PDW rounds? [ edit ] IF the Hand held variant was accepted in real life \nWhat role in an infantry squad would it have? would it be some IAR/LMG GPMG?. Also why doesnt it come with some stock/bipod or even a bullpup conversion? :lol \nIt may be a way of barrel cooling or rapid fire without using a water jacket/qc barrel during a heavy firefight but thats just about it. \nIts unusual, its cool and the most macho gun on the screen. But impractical in the real world. Its that this has been discussed billions of times. \nThere have been designs on patent though but have never been accepted for use in this role. \nHowever, there are firearms that would fill the Minigun role for ground usage: the Pribor 3B and the AO-63 assault rifle which fires up to 6000rpm bursts. Assault rifles, SMGs with more than one barrel, Or simply a GPMG with its ROF adjusted to rapid fire. \nPrcsnv 03:00AM 06 March 2014 (UTC) Patent of a handheld 5.56mm four-barrel rotary gun, circa 1985 ^ That's fine, but I wouldn't call any of those 'miniguns' because while they have multiple rotary barrels, that doesn't make them Miniguns, just modern Gatling-style designs. Minigun is short for Mini-Vulcan, named so because the M134 was the near-exact design of the M61 Vulcan cannon scaled down. As for 'filling a Minigun role', I assume you mean squad and platoon/section-level automatic weapons, in which case more typical (and far more practical) light and medium general-purpose machine guns handle that just fine. An actual hand-held 'minigun', in terms of actual deployment, is still unfeasible and remains a film fantasy. StanTheMan ( talk ) 22:28, 19 June 2015 (EDT) I wouldn't call it a \"serious military concept,\" anyone who can convince an overworked clerk that something would work can patent something and that doesn't mean the military actually considered the idea. You might as well say restaurants considered motorised ice cream cones . The big problem with a handheld rotary gun is that it throws a lot of weight at solving a problem that doesn't exist; an infantryman simply can't carry enough ammunition to feed a gun that burns it off that fast, and can't hold it level enough that the majority of the rounds would actually hit the target (I would imagine the gyroscopic effect of the rotating barrels would also mean it would be tough to actually point it at something without a mounting). If you slow it down then you're carrying a rotor assembly, three extra barrels (in that example) and three extra spare barrels for no benefit at all. And when does an infantryman ever need to fire rounds at 6000rpm in the first place? The volume of fire from rotary weapons is primarily used for firing from unstable or fast platforms and / or at fast-moving targets like aircraft and missiles. Dismounted infantry are not noted for encountering those situations. Evil Tim ( talk ) 22:45, 19 June 2015 (EDT) \nThe M134 Minigun has been used on vehicles and naval platforms but only to an extent. Not just the M134 but other aircraft guns with a high rate of fire have been used as infantry weapons, the MG81 and the .303 Browning. As for an infantryman firing at a high ROF, British Commandos used the Vickers K machine gun which fired faster than the Bren and were highly effective. However this would only be an exception for the likes of Special Forces who would want extra firepower over average machine guns. To be serious, the idea of a handheld ultrahigh rate of fire machine gun is still intriguing though but in real life it would be one of the weapons mentioned on here before. \nPrcsnv 00:45AM 08/08/2015 [ edit ] Real life alternatives \nThe idea of a handheld M134 Minigun may be intriguing but in the real world impractical. Does anyone here know of ultrahigh rate of fire weapons that can be handheld?, if so what is the highest ROF?/what is the most suited calibre that can be handled?",

      "text": "Boeing is turning to an outsider for the first time to head the commercial airplanes division, replacing Ray Conner with Kevin McAllister, a 27-year veteran of General Electric 's aviation business.\nMcAllister, 53, the former chief executive officer of GE Aviation Services, assumed the leadership of Boeing's largest business on Monday, according to a statement by the planemaker. Conner, 61, will stay on as vice chairman through 2017.\nThe company also promoted Stan Deal to the role of president and CEO of Boeing Global Services, creating a third division that combines customer-service groups within the commercial airplane and defense units. Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg sees the potential to build a $50 billion business by bolstering service offerings, from providing spare parts to conducting round-the-clock maintenance.\n\"We've always said that growing services was a key part of our strategy,\" Muilenburg told reporters during a conference call Monday. The latest leadership changes underscore that \"actions follow words,\" he said.\nA trip back in time, from the newest Boeing 747-8 Intercontinental to the original 747.\nMuilenburg, who took over last year, has made a series of management shifts that place the company's largest businesses under executives with backgrounds in services.\nThe latest move reshapes the manufacturer's largest business with new leadership amid a turbulent market for commercial aircraft. The Chicago-based company announced Oct. 14 that Ihssane Mounir would replace the retiring John Wojick, a key Conner deputy, early next year as chief airplane salesman.\nWith McAllister, Boeing gains an executive with deep ties to airlines worldwide, including some who are exclusively Airbus Group SE customers, and a reputation for using data to analyze airlines' wants and needs. He'd been viewed as a potential successor to David Joyce, who heads GE Aviation and is a vice chairman, said Rick Kennedy, a spokesman for GE.\nMcAllister has been GE's \"face\" to all of its airline customers for 15 years, first leading the sales team and more recently as the head of the unit selling long-term service contracts and spare parts. The business is a major source of profit for GE, accumulating a backlog of services worth more than $120 billion, Kennedy said.\nJoe Sutter, father of Boeing's 747 jumbo jet, dies at 95 Julie Johnsson Joe Sutter, the Boeing engineer who ushered in the modern era of long-range travel by spearheading the 747 jumbo jet in the 1960s, has died. He was 95.\n\"Joe lived an amazing life and was an inspiration - not just to those of us at Boeing, but to the entire aerospace industry,\" Ray Conner, chief...\nJoe Sutter, the Boeing engineer who ushered in the modern era of long-range travel by spearheading the 747 jumbo jet in the 1960s, has died. He was 95.\n\"Joe lived an amazing life and was an inspiration - not just to those of us at Boeing, but to the entire aerospace industry,\" Ray Conner, chief...\n(Julie Johnsson) McAllister is a \"very solid guy with a great background in aviation,\" said Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst at Teal Group in Fairfax, Virginia. \"He's a big customer and part of their biggest industrial partner company, too. That's a unique combination.\"\nA materials engineer by training and University of Pittsburgh graduate, McAllister will be the first outsider to lead Boeing Commercial Airplanes since the unit was formed in 1965. The company selected McAllister after considering a mix of external and internal candidates to succeed Conner.\nMcAllister has worked closely with Boeing over the years, Muilenburg said. \"I'm not sure I'd call him an outsider,\" the CEO said. \"He's been very, very close to us for a couple of decades.\"\nWhile McAllister masters the nuances of Boeing's culture and works to earn the respect of its factory workers and engineers, he also will face crucial product-strategy decisions. Perhaps the most critical is the call expected next year on Boeing's first all-new airplane since the 787 Dreamliner: a new plane family aimed at the market gap between Boeing's largest single-aisle and smallest twin-aisle jetliners.\nThrough his role at GE, McAllister \"saw both the challenges and failures of the 787,\" Howard Rubel, an aerospace analyst at Jefferies, said by phone. \"So, he knows how hard it is to run an airplane company. He saw how hard it was to launch a new engine.\"\nBoeing's 747 jumbo snags a $5.3 billion lifeline from UPS Julie Johnsson and Michael Sasso Boeing's 747 jumbo jet may have won a reprieve from an uncertain future as United Parcel Service agreed to buy at least 14 freighters -- the biggest order in almost nine years.\nThe deal for 747-8 aircraft, valued at $5.3 billion based on list prices and fueled by UPS's international expansion,...\nBoeing's 747 jumbo jet may have won a reprieve from an uncertain future as United Parcel Service agreed to buy at least 14 freighters -- the biggest order in almost nine years.\nThe deal for 747-8 aircraft, valued at $5.3 billion based on list prices and fueled by UPS's international expansion,...\n(Julie Johnsson and Michael Sasso) McAllister also will be under pressure to bolster margins as the planemaker slows production of the 777, its second-largest source of profit. He may also have to navigate potential fall-out from the economic penalties President-elect Donald Trump has threatened to impose on China, Boeing's largest overseas market.\nConner has served as corporate vice chairman since 2013, and president and CEO of commercial airplanes since 2012. A 39-year Boeing veteran, he led the division during an era of historic jetliner sales, then warned workers that tougher times and cost reductions lay ahead. During his watch, record output at Boeing's factories boosted the segment's revenue to $66 billion, up 34 percent from 2012.\nHe is a throwback, known for close ties forged with customers as the planemaker's former sales chief. A native of Burien, Washington, a working-class suburb south of Seattle, Conner joined his father and brother at Boeing in 1977, landing a job as a mechanic building 727 jetliners.\nConner will help smooth the transition to a new generation of leaders, Muilenburg said, while helping Deal knit together the government and commercial services businesses. Conner will also stay \"engaged in our product development activities, including the production transformation under way,\" Muilenburg said.\nDeal, 52, who was rumored to be an heir to Conner, had served as senior vice-president of Boeing's Commercial Aviation Services business since 2014. His new business will have about 20,000 employees and will maintain a headquarters staff of a \"couple dozen\" in Dallas.\nThe lines between Deal's new unit and Boeing airplane and defense divisions will be blurry in places, with some customer-facing groups staying in place inside the current business units.\nDeal's current operation has more than 12,000 employees and provides airlines and leasing companies with wide ranging support services, from maintenance training to digital crew scheduling. Another 13,000 employees support military and government customers worldwide.",

      "text": "0 0 \nNEW YORK: Boeing Co on Monday named a senior General Electric Co executive to head its commercial airplanes division and announced a new services unit, in moves to capture more of the profitable market for parts and repairs after a jet is sold. \nThe changes are \"a big and important step\" toward Boeing´s goal of increasing annual services revenue to about $50 billion in 10 years from about $15 billion currently, Boeing Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg said on a call with journalists. \nThe changes do not alter plans for developing aircraft, but put a new \"emphasis on generating life-cycle value,\" Muilenburg said, referring to building an aircraft with an eye to gaining revenue from servicing the plane during its decades-long life. \n\"We´ve always said growing services is a core part of our strategy, and now you see us emphasizing and investing accordingly,\" Muilenburg said. \nBoeing tapped Kevin McAllister, 53, to lead its $66 billion commercial airplane business, succeeding Ray Conner, 61, effective immediately. \nConner, who started as a Boeing mechanic nearly 40 years ago, will serve as vice chairman through 2017 to help with the transition, the world´s biggest planemaker said. \nMcAllister has been with GE´s aviation unit for nearly 30 years and knows Boeing and its customers well, Muilenburg said. \nBoeing named Stanley Deal, 52, to head the new services unit, to be known as Global Services. \nDeal had been senior vice president of Boeing´s Commercial Aviation Services business. \nThe Global Services business is due to begin operating in the third quarter of 2017.McAllister has been chief executive of GE´s $8 billion aviation services business, a unit that earns much of its revenue from contracts servicing GE aircraft engines. \nAirlines generally pay a fee for every hour they run the engines, which covers service and maintenance. \n\"Muilenburg is shaking up BCA with a surprise outside appointment which is likely a healthy move given that fresh leadership eyes can create positive movement,\" said analyst Peter Arment from Baird Equity Research. \nLast year, Muilenburg named Leanne Caret head of the defense business. \n0 0 Boeing taps GE executive to head airplanes unit as part of services push   Print/166876-Boeing-taps-GE-executive-to-head-airplanes-unit-as-part-of-services-push/   \"Boeing taps GE executive to head airplanes unit as part of services push\" is https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/166876-Boeing-taps-GE-executive-to-head-airplanes-unit-as-part-of-services-push+TheNewsInternational- ",

      "text": "Chief of Boeing commercial airplanes retires, replaced with GE exec Glenn Farley, KING 3:13 PM. PST November 22, 2016 Boeing Commercial Airplanes chief executive Ray Conner. (KING) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST \nBoeing announced on Monday that Boeing Commercial Airplanes chief executive Ray Conner will retire by the end of 2017, replaced by General Electric senior executive Kevin McAllister. \nThe news comes as a break from what we've seen from Boeing's commercial airplane business - namely, bringing in an outsider as chief of Boeing's single biggest business: making jetliners. \nRay Conner is the ultimate insider and grew up inside the company. He got his start on the 727 assembly line in Renton and rose through the ranks. He's also been at the controls through some very tumultuous times, including 2013 and 2014, when the Machinists Union had to vote on whether to accept contract changes or risk the new Boeing 777X being built in another state. \nConner will remain as vice chairman of the company, overseeing the transition to Kevin McAllister. \nMcAllister does not come from inside Boeing, but rather from General Electric's sizeable aviation business, which among other things, builds jet engines. One one hand, he should know Boeing very well as planes from the 737 to the 747 use engines built whole or in part by G.E. KING asked Boeing Chairman Dennis Muilenburg if this outside appointment could bring anxiety to Puget Sound: \n\"You can see us making investments in the community here, to show you we're here for the long run...There is an advantage as we bring in external talent, new ideas, different perspectives, things that are complimentary to our team here. With Kevin (McAllister), we have the best of both worlds. We're bringing in somebody with fresh ideas and perspectives and somebody who also knows Boeing well and has a great deal of respect for our team here in Puget Sound.\" \nMuillenburg himself spent the first 15 years of his career in Puget Sound, having started off as an engineering intern. \nCopyright 2016 KING ",

      "text": "General Electric's Future In Renewable Wind Energy Nov.23.16 \nGE is moving away from oil & gas somewhat. \nRenewable energy remains important. \nGeneration of wind energy is increasing. General Electric (NYSE: GE ), a diversified industrial conglomerate, has recently performed significant corporate actions with its fossil fuel businesses. GE's potential combination with Baker Hughes (NYSE: BHI ) does not amount to selling its Oil & Gas segment at the bottom, as the firm should retain control of the resultant enterprise. There could be complementary motives. One perhaps is the opportunity to pursue a future in renewable energy sources, which comprise a growing proportion of energy consumption. The corporation's investment activities are underscored by its windmills. As shown in results from the most recent quarter, Renewable Energy accounts for nearly 10% of industrial revenues. However, that is inclusive of Oil & Gas, which had clearly been decelerating. Pursuant to the merger, Renewable Energy should assume a greater proportion among segments: Click to enlarge As a current graphic from the US EIA shows, wind energy is now approaching a 6% share of domestic energy generation. It has gained rapidly since 2001. The trend should continue, so it makes sense that GE seeks to increase its footprint in turbines. The Renewable Energy segment is actually newer. It includes legacy onshore wind acquired from France's Alstom (as well as steam power). It also includes offshore wind and emerging low carbon technologies. The aim is to make renewable power sources accessible to persons everywhere. Operations are found in over 40 different countries. Obviously, there are a lot of moving parts within the Renewable Energy segment. The focus here is upon wind. As shown in the graphic below, Onshore Wind remains most important when considering segment revenues. GE's domestic wind turbine customers are largely farmers . Key concerns involve safety and quietness. The company performs computerized data analysis. Software optimization is associated with high availability and efficiency at producing energy. Advancements in technology allow wind to compete with other energy sources, as evidenced by the EIA graphic above. As shown in results from the past quarter, turbines are helping to pay dividends to shareholders: Currently, GE's largest turbines rise 650-feet above the ground, span 25 stories in diameter, and produce 2.5megawatts of electricity. Aside from the prodigal dimensions, underpinnings are remarkable. Wind farms are configured to maximize performance at each location. Specifically, digital technologies powered by GE's Predix software \nFind the optimum blade angle at any given condition. Tactics involve adjusting the blades' pitch, the yaw of the nacelles, and the speed and torque of the turbines. A 5% increase in output per turbine can lead to a 20% increase in profit . As of October, GE has announced a plan to acquire LM Wind Power , a Danish maker of rotor blades for $1.7 billion ( 1.5B EUR ). LM Wind is one of the world's largest wind turbine blade manufacturers, and is behind the first offshore wind farm, which is being dismantled after 25 years. LM Wind claims the longest, most advanced turbine in the world, the 88.4P. Here is an image: Click to enlarge Offshore Wind, augmented by the recent Alstom acquisition, offers a high-yield turbine Haliade 150-6MW. It is compatible with bottom fixed and floating foundations. Services support customers over the lifetime of their fleet. As of August, GE has achieved two important milestones: The 396 MW Merkur offshore wind farm project, located in the North Sea, which will generate enough power for 500,000 homes. GE will supply 66 Haliade 150-6MW, and when completed, it will become one of Germany's largest wind farms. Installed America's first offshore wind farm at Block Island, RI. This 30MW project will generate enough power to meet the needs of the residents of the island. The success of such projects can support future offshore wind activities. Obviously, there is a long way to go to be a meaningful contributor to segment revenues from 1% in the past quarter. International potential is there. While wholly-owned energy businesses comprise large percentages of industrial segment operations, General Electric has moved away from oil and gas somewhat. Renewables present a long-term future opportunity, underscored by the acquisition of European firms and ongoing activities overseas. Onshore wind turbines have been helping results. Offshore can easily result in further gains. Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in GE, BHI over the next 72 hours.

      "title": "We’ve not sealed any deal with GE – NRC - Punch Newspapers",
      "text": "We’ve not sealed any deal with GE – NRC November 23, 2016 Nigerian Railway Corporation Rasheed Bisiriyu Contrary to the impression that the Federal Government has awarded the concession for the running of the Abuja-Kaduna fast rail to the United States-based General Electric, the Managing Director, Nigerian Railway Corporation, Mr. Fidet Okheria, says no agreement has been reached on the project yet. He, however, said whatever decision would be taken on the project would be a collective one and in the interest of the nation. “Nobody has awarded the concession contract of the railway operation to any firm. It is only a process that has been initiated. We should not pre-empt what the process will deliver,” Okheria said. The Minister of Transportation, Mr. Rotimi Amaechi, recently dropped a hint of the Federal Government’s plan to transfer the running of the Abuja-Kaduna rail service from the NRC to GE through a concession arrangement. This was announced a few months after the inauguration of the standard gauge rail line by President Muhammadu Buhari. But the NRC managing director said although there was a proposal for the concession of the rail line to a private firm for effective operation, the matter would have to follow due process. Okheria, who has just been confirmed as the substantive NRC managing director, spoke in Lagos at an interactive session with workers of the corporation, which focused on issues of welfare and running effective train services across the nation’s railway network. Some employees of the corporation were said to have protested against the planned concession of the rail line. They were reportedly led by the leadership of the Nigeria Union of Railway Workers, who expressed fears that it would lead to job losses should GE be allowed to take over the running of the new line. But the NRC managing director allayed such fears, saying that rather than laying off workers, more people would be hired by the eventual managers of the new line. He said, “We’re trying to improve on the Abuja-Kaduna rail line. We’ll need to employ more people. Workers should not be scared; only those who are lazy should be afraid of losing their jobs should the government decide to hand over the line to a private firm to run.” Copyright PUNCH.

The plant itself is the fourth largest coal-powered plant in the southern hemisphere. It has six units with a capacity of 794 MW each and an installed capacity of 4,764 MW. The GE team that has been working on this project is immensely proud of the IPMA award and recognition,” notes Lee Dawes, Regional Project Executive, GE’s Steam Power Systems. GE’s scope includes 6 full EPC turbine islands, air cooled Condensers and overall project & construction management. Once completed in 2020, Medupi Power Plant will generate enough power to the grid to meet the electricity needs of 3.5 million households in South Africa. \nThe IPMA award recognises work that is an example of excellent project management. Global projects that have similar budgets compete against each other and the winner is determined based on the entry submission as well as a site visit. Winners are determined based on the assessors’ evaluation and jury reports, which include a detailed analysis. \n“This is a first for GE Power and Steam Power Systems in Africa and it certainly is celebration of the work we’ve done South Africa, executing a significant project that will deliver power to millions of people,” says Lee Dawes. \nThe award is a culmination of years of learnings and experience that have contributed to the team’s approach executing this mega project. The Steam Power Systems’ team working on Medupi includes 200 direct employees and 2,000 sub-contractors. \n“Big scale projects like Medupi are great stimulators for the local economy, they inject economic activity in remote areas and create sustainable livelihoods.” Dawes says. “Our initial local content target for this project was 50% and we exceeded it delivering 70%. We trained over 800 trade professionals and spent more than $1.4BN on local content.” \nMedupi is an example of success and a shining example of how Africa’s power generation needs can be solved through public private sector collaboration. \nEskom would like to congratulate its partners General Electric on receiving this prestigious award. It is testament to their hard work and performance at Medupi power station.",

      "text": "GE Launches ‘Garages’ Advanced Manufacturing Program in Lagos, Nigeria By GE,SMS \nGE launches its first ever permanent ‘garages’ installation in Lagos, Nigeria The GE Lagos garage supports Government’s localization, skills development and job creation efforts in Nigeria The Lagos Garages space features advanced manufacturing innovations like 3D printers, laser cutters and CNC mills, encouraging entrepreneurial growth and building a skilled workforce for the future \nLeading Multinational, General Electric (GE) (www.GE.com) officially launched the permanent installation of the Lagos Garage, a hub for advanced manufacturing-based innovation, strategy development, idea generation and collaboration. \nCo-located with the GE Lagos offices in Victoria Island, the Lagos Garage will offer a year-round series of skills training programs focused on building the next generation of Nigerian entrepreneurs. Participants will be trained to use the latest in advanced manufacturing technologies; 3D printers, CNC mills, and laser cutters in the first-ever fabrication lab in Nigeria, driving innovation in the country. They will also learn how to apply the core principles of design thinking, product development, finance, marketing, sales, and customer acquisition in real-time to their ventures. \n‘Innovation and technology are fundamental for Africa to better compete in a global frame work” said President & CEO, GE Nigeria, Dr. Lazarus Angbazo. “Innovation needs to be tailored to the specificities of local needs. “GE is pleased to encourage innovation in Nigeria and support SME development through skills-building initiatives such as these.” \nGE created the Garages experience in March 2012 to reinvigorate interest in invention, innovation, and manufacturing in America. Programs have included custom projects, curated speaker sessions and workshops amidst a fully equipped advanced manufacturing space. This program went global with two workshops in Lagos in 2014 and has since grown to include several countries in Europe and the Middle-East. \nThe popularity of the program led to GE’s decision to commission a permanent space for the training of young Nigerians in advanced manufacturing and business development. By assisting with the development of the advanced manufacturing ecosystem in Nigeria, GE hopes to create jobs, build local knowledge and capability, and encourage technology-based innovation in the manufacturing sector. \n“GE is proud to launch the Lagos Garage, a hub that is dedicated to accelerating the impact of some of Nigeria’s most promising entrepreneurs. We have set up a learning environment that is different from the traditional. We are combining both the classroom and the real-world – providing hands-on training in advanced manufacturing” said Patricia Obozuwa, Director of Communications & Public Affairs for GE Africa. We’re looking forward to seeing great ideas that come to the GE Lagos Garage being transformed into practical business models that ultimately create more jobs in Nigeria.” \nWhile on the program and upon graduation, The Lagos Garage will provide the participants access to a robust mentorship network, supporting entrepreneurship with the aim of driving growth across all sectors of the Nigerian economy.",

      "text": "GE’s Steam Power Systems Wins Global IPMA Project Excellence Gold Award for work done on Medupi By GE,SMS \nAward recognizes strong project execution on Eskom’s Medupi Medupi is a 6x794 MW power plant under construction that will cover the energy needs of approximately 3.5 million households Unit 6 achieved commercial operation on 23 August 2015 and Unit 5 was synchronized to the grid ahead of schedule in September 2016 helping to stabilize the South African grid \nGE’s Steam Power Systems, part of GE Power (GE: NYSE) ( www.GE.com ), has been awarded the Global Project Excellence Gold Award by the International Project Management Association (IPMA) for their work on South Africa’s Medupi Power Plant. \n“Our team has been working with Eskom on the Medupi Power Plant since 2007. The plant itself is the fourth largest coal-powered plant in the southern hemisphere. It has six units with a capacity of 794 MW each and an installed capacity of 4,764 MW. The GE team that has been working on this project is immensely proud of the IPMA award and recognition,” notes Lee Dawes, Regional Project Executive, GE’s Steam Power Systems. GE’s scope includes 6 full EPC turbine islands, air cooled Condensers and overall project & construction management. Once completed in 2020, Medupi Power Plant will generate enough power to the grid to meet the electricity needs of 3.5 million households in South Africa. \nThe IPMA award recognises work that is an example of excellent project management. Global projects that have similar budgets compete against each other and the winner is determined based on the entry submission as well as a site visit. Winners are determined based on the assessors’ evaluation and jury reports, which include a detailed analysis. \n“This is a first for GE Power and Steam Power Systems in Africa and it certainly is celebration of the work we’ve done South Africa, executing a significant project that will deliver power to millions of people,” says Lee Dawes. \nThe award is a culmination of years of learnings and experience that have contributed to the team’s approach executing this mega project. The Steam Power Systems’ team working on Medupi includes 200 direct employees and 2,000 sub-contractors. \n“Big scale projects like Medupi are great stimulators for the local economy, they inject economic activity in remote areas and create sustainable livelihoods.” Dawes says. “Our initial local content target for this project was 50% and we exceeded it delivering 70%. We trained over 800 trade professionals and spent more than $1.4BN on local content.” \nMedupi is an example of success and a shining example of how Africa’s power generation needs can be solved through public private sector collaboration. \nEskom would like to congratulate its partners General Electric on receiving this prestigious award. It is testament to their hard work and performance at Medupi power station.",

      "text": "David Corbin (right), Tech in Asia’s director of content strategy, interviews Dattabot CEO Regi Wahyu (left) and Wayah Suroto (middle), General Electric’s digital leader for Indonesia, on the main stage at Tech in Asia Jakarta 2016.\nThe last time we spoke to big data analytics startup Dattabot (previously Mediatrac), it was getting down and nerdy to celebrate its partnership with Yello Mobile and Cloudera.\nA year and a half later, nerdy’s still in style – Dattabot’s become the first startup in the world to tie-up with GE Digital, General Electric’s IT division. Dattabot CEO Regi Wahyu and Wayah Suroto, General Electric’s digital leader for Indonesia, announced the news at the Tech in Asia Jakarta 2016 conference.\nThrough the partnership Dattabot will lend its data analytics capabilities to GE’s power plants in the country, allowing for constant real-time tracking and monitoring of machines that may break down.\nBringing up the phrase “startups in Indonesia” may lead one to think of consumer-focused industries like ecommerce. Regi and Wayah have their sights set on streamlining industry players within the country. According to them, Internet of Things (IoT) is the way to go.\nSee: Indonesia’s nerdiest company joins Yello Mobile and Cloudera in multi-million dollar partnership “Everyone is talking about the robots,” Regi told the audience, on his decision to get involved with big data.\nIn answer to the question, “What lies in Indonesia’s IoT future?” Regi’s answer is simple: the future’s already here.\n“There are over 100 sensors in this room,” Regi says, nodding to the ballroom-sized space where we, the audience, sit. IoT gadgets often involve sensors that collect data and send information over an internet connection to another sensor where the information can be read and interpreted. The word “sensor” doesn’t have to refer to something as complex-sounding as a smart home, though. An air conditioning sensor, Regi points out, is “one of the smartest sensors that manufacturers produce.” He brings up sensor use in agriculture and fisheries as other examples.\nKeeping the lights on When it comes to monitoring the stability of power grids, smart sensors can make all the difference.\nThe timing may still not be perfect, but days warning is much better than hours. A few months ago, one of my colleagues in Indonesia experienced a power outage while her laptop was nearly out of power. She wasn’t in a building that had a backup generator at the time, and we quickly worked together to transfer her work so I could help her hit her deadline.\nGE entered Indonesia in the 1940s, when many millennials’ parents had yet to be born. Over 70 years later, its current sensor technology allows the company three hours warning before a blackout occurs. By using Dattabot’s analytics power to gather round-the-clock data from power plants, employees may now get 10 days’ warning when machines are about to break down.\nThe timing may still not be perfect, depending on the problem, but days warning is much better than hours. That’s time that doesn’t just translate into convenience but money as well. “In a power plant, if you have an unplanned shutdown, there will be also a huge loss for the owner of the property,” Wayah says.\nSee: How Tech in Asia Bangalore opened doors to Japan for this IoT startup from India IoT in the city Wayah told the room he was “very proud to be Indonesian” because the first collaboration of this type for GE was with an Indonesian company. “It shows how resourceful it is,” he said.\nDattabot’s users are considered the first owners of their information, and have the option to opt-in or out of Dattabot’s data mining. Work on GE’s machine sensors has begun already, a team effort that involves input from GE in all corners, including the company’s Bangalore office, which develops the company’s engines and machines.\nChoosing to work with Dattabot was a big step and one that GE is willing to expand on, depending on the way this tie-up works out. Wayah doesn’t rule out the possibility of further investments or partnerships.\nThe IoT ecosystem in Indonesia remains in its nascent stage – partially, as Wayah reminds the audience, because even five years ago, the country’s internet was nowhere near ready to support such technology. IoT events, much like GE and Dattabot’s partnership, tend to center around big enterprises. Smaller IoT startups like eFishery , which uses sensors to feed fish , exist but have yet swim in a school that makes a splash.\nPacked house.\nJakarta aims to be a smart city and launched its program in 2014 . That entails connecting its citizens with traffic information via smartphone, as well as the creation of an app through which people can report civil incidents like floods or fires. An IoT tie-up like Dattabot and GE Digital’s could help push progress forward in the workplace as well as in Indonesia’s education system.\n“It’s important to show that a startup can collaborate with a big giant company,” Regi tells the audience. Knowing the nature of startups, though, that’s going to require some flexibility on the part of larger enterprises, including a more leeway for mistakes.\n“One of the most important [opportunities] about IoT is not just about connecting machines – that’s the basic platform we have. The most important [thing] is getting the insight,” Wayah says. Unlimited insight means unlimited possibilities.\nSee: This IoT startup is competing with GE and winning. Here’s how.

      "title": "General Electric Company (GE) Stock Hasn’t Looked This Healthy in a While",
      "text": "Source: Anthony Quintano via Flickr \nIndeed, General Electric stock is approaching break-even for the year-to-date after a strong upside move in the first-half of November. Heck, GE stock is up nearly 10% since Nov. 3. \nIn some promising technical developments, General Electric broke resistance at its 50- and 200-day moving averages along the way. True, the Relative Strength Index is getting close to overbought territory, but it’s not there quite yet. At the same time, the MACD suggests momentum remains to the upside. \nThat said, GE stock has been trading sideways for more than a week’s worth of sessions. Perhaps the market is digesting recent gains before settling on its next move. Either way, General Electric stock hasn’t looked this healthy since the first half of the year. 7 Feast or Famine Stocks to Buy for Thanksgiving \nA strong finish would be a nice reward for investors who’ve stuck by GE through a whirlwind of deep strategic changes. General Electric shed most of its financial assets to become a pure-play industrial, with all the risk that that entails. And still, GE wasn’t done. \nLast month, General Electric dealt with the drag of low energy prices by distancing itself from its oil and gas unit. To do this, General Electric will combine its operations with oilfield services giant Baker Hughes Incorporated (NYSE: BHI ) and spin the entity off as its own publicly traded company. GE will still have exposure to fickle oil prices, but the brunt of the risk will be borne by shareholders in the new Baker Hughes. \nSince the oil and gas business has been responsible for the greatest weakness in GE earnings, this promises to be a smart move. Despite the difficulty of doing business on top of a strong dollar in a world of sluggish economic growth, General Electric has done pretty well outside of oil and gas. GE’s Bet on Tech \nAs long as international trade policy doesn’t go off the rails under a new administration, General Electric’s long-term strategy sounds too good to ignore. It’s the most exciting thing the company has done since before the financial crisis — and that goes double for its investments in software and related technology.",

      "text": "What's next for Appliance Park workers 2016-11-23T21:50:57Z Biography GE union members voted down a new contract from Haier on Tuesday. (Source: Stephen Richard/WAVE 3 News) \nLOUISVILLE, KY (WAVE) - Workers at Appliance Park rejected a new contract offer from new GE owner Haier on Tuesday night. \nOf the 3,608 ballots cast, only 1,005 accepted the offer; 2,603 rejected it. \nHaier/GE appliances spokeswoman Kim Freeman reiterated Wednesday, \"GE appliances has put together a comprehensive and fair package. It is now incumbent on the union and its membership to determine their next steps. The company will talk with the union upon request.\" \nSome workers told us they're willing to strike; others were nervous about the possibility. \nLouisville labor and employment attorney Larry Woods said, \"I think whenever a new employer comes in, there's always a tendency to take the position that the way things have always been done, does not necessarily apply to us.\" \n>> PREVIOUS STORY: GE union members vote down new contract \nThat's the case with China-based Haier. After buying the GE facility, the company wanted to roll things back in the new contract with no raises, cutbacks on overtime, seniority and new worker pay. \nWorkers showing up to vote on the contract gave it the thumbs down. Union leaders may have seen that coming. \n\"If it's a no vote, I'll set down and my negotiating team will immediately request bargaining from the company,\" said Dana Crittendon on Tuesday, before the vote was tallied. Crittendon is President of Local 83761. \nMORE FROM WAVE3.COM \nNow what? \n\"Haier wants to get a deal,\" Woods said. \nWoods said he has no knowledge of what’s actually going on in the Appliance Park situation, but in general, company officials who spent three months negotiating don't want a strike. \nWoods should know, after representing management at many companies over the years. \nBut, he warns workers should be careful. \"The union shouldn't think just because we have a lot of employees we're untouchable,\" Woods said. \"As big as we think Appliance Park is, those kind of plants close all the time.\" \nWoods believes big companies like Haier can walk away from a big plant like Appliance Park because they have large resources. While unions with Ford, UPS and Appliance Park generally have good relationships with their companies, others could have their work cut out for them. \nA team of attorneys from Woods' firm, Frost Brown Todd, represented Hardin County in the Right to Work ruling, which basically means a worker there, now has the right not to join a labor union. \n\"I think there's little question that the Kentucky legislature will pass right to work and do it quickly,\" Woods said. \"That will weaken the unions' positions in Kentucky because there will be more people who will opt out.\" \nSupporters of Right to Work believe it will improve Kentucky's position nationally to be more competitive with other states. Opponents and unions fear it will hurt worker pay and erode work place safety. Attorneys in the firm that fought against Right to Work tell WAVE 3 News, next month they will ask the full Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals to re-hear the case. Copyright 2016 WAVE 3 News .

      "text": "Firsthand Capital Reduces Stake in Cree (CREE, GE) By Daniel Kobialka | November 23, 2016 — 8:29 AM EST \nFirsthand Capital Management has lowered its stake in lighting products company Cree Inc. ( CREE ). (See also: Deutsche Bank Confirms Hold Rating for Cree .) \nMarket Digest Online reported Firsthand Capital reduced its stake in CREE by 13.33 percent in the second quarter of 2016. Firsthand Capital owns 13,000 shares of CREE's stock worth approximately $318,370. \nIn addition, Market Digest Online noted Riverhead Capital Management cut its stake in CREE by 54.34 percent in 2Q16, and FNY Managed Accounts sold its entire stake in the company during the time frame. \nCREE shares traded down 0.80 percent on Monday and reached a price of $24.95 per share. What Does the Future Hold for CREE? \nMany investors have lowered their stake in CREE recently, and perhaps it is easy to understand why. CREE struggled in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, and the business likely faces an uphill climb if it hopes to rebound in the near future. \nCREE reported total revenue of $371 million in 1QFY17, down 13 percent year to year. Also, the company recorded a loss from continuing operations of $3 million in 1QFY17. \nOther CREE 1QFY17 financial results included: Total generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) net income of $600,000, compared to a GAAP net loss of $24 million one year earlier. Revenue from discontinued operations of $50 million, up from $44 million in 1QFY16. Consolidated cash from operations of $18 million. \n\"We delivered solid results,\" CREE CEO Chuck Swoboda said. \"We continue to make progress with our transition to a more focused LED lighting company and building a more valuable business by bringing better light to our customers.\" \nFurthermore, CREE last month appointed former Cooper Industries and General Electric Co. ( GE ) executive Daniel Castillo as its president of lighting. In this role, Castillo will lead CREE's commercial and consumer lighting businesses. \nCastillo's appointment may represent one of many moves for CREE as the company searches for ways to bolster its revenue. \"The addition of Danny Castillo to the leadership team brings valuable industry expertise and proven business leadership to Cree as we scale the business to the next level,\" Swoboda noted.

      "text": "By Ted Mann\nChina's Haier Group bought division from GE earlier this year\nWorkers at the former appliance division of General Electric Co. rejected a new contract this week, spurning an attempt by its new Chinese owners to cut costs at a massive factory complex in Louisville, Ky.\nMembers of the CWA union voted down the four-year deal on Tuesday, against the recommendation of union leadership. The agreement would have lowered wages for new hires at the Appliance Park complex, cut overtime and triggered buyouts for up to 450 workers.\nThe deal's failure comes just months after GE Appliances was purchased for $5.6 billion by China's Haier Group, which was seeking a larger American foothold for its appliance business as GE (GE) sought to exit from the business. Haier Group, which also imports appliances such as air conditioners from China, will continue to use the GE Appliances name for 40 years.\nThe rejection raises questions about whether the political climate weeks after Donald Trump was elected president has emboldened manufacturing workers to stand up to management.\nAn expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.com (http://www.wsj.com/articles/ge-appliances-workers-reject-contract-offer-from-chinese-owner-1479919858).\nAlso popular on WSJ.com:\nDonald Trump Jr. held talks on Syria with Russia supporters (http://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trump-jr-held-talks-on-syria-with-russia-supporters-1479920753?mod=mktw).\nMitt Romney leads Donald Trump's picks for secretary of state (http://www.wsj.com/articles/mitt-romney-leads-donald-trumps-picks-for-secretary-of-state-1479846765?mod=mktw).\n-Ted Mann ;\n 1700ET\n ",

      "text": "GE is trading a high P/E ratio, but I believe that the premium is warranted. \nThe Alstom acquisition and the digital push are key growth drivers. \nGE is a long-term buy at today's price. In \" GE: Chasing A Rainbow Is Never A Good Idea \", the prolific author and CNBC contributor, David Alton Clark , told prospective dividend growth and income investors that may be interested in investing in General Electric (NYSE: GE ) that \"now is not the time to buy\". While I agree that GE is trading at a fairly high price-to-earnings ratio (\"P/E ratio\"), and that the stock appears to be overbought at the moment, I would contend that now may be the best time to layer into a GE position. In my opinion, you are not really chasing the rainbow if the pot of gold is already in sight. ( Image Source ) The Trump Factor, What Exactly Does It Look Like? On the campaign trial, Mr. Donald J. Trump promoted protectionism-type policies (tariffs and other trade barriers) but today there is a lot of uncertainty as to what the president-elect's policies will actually look like once he takes office. Everyone knows that candidates have a tendency to offer great sound bites while campaigning but let's not forget that most these \"promises\" rarely ever become realities. Policies that limit global trade indeed have a real chance to negatively impact a global company like GE, but, on the other hand, there are also expectations that Mr. Trump will implement policies that would be viewed as positive developments for GE (increased infrastructure spending and business-friendly tax changes). So, should a Trump presidency be viewed as a positive or a negative for GE? Personally, I think that investors should take a wait-and-see stance in trying to determine what type of impact Mr. Trump's policies will have on industrial companies, and more specifically GE, but in the same breath, I believe that now may be the best time to invest in a best-of-breed industrial conglomerate that has great business prospects in place. GE Has Great Business Prospects, So Why Look Elsewhere When You Already Have a Good Thing? GE is in the midst of a significant transformation that will results in a more industrial-focused company and it is encouraging that the restructuring efforts are already bearing fruit (more on this below). Management still expects for GE to be able to achieve 2018 EPS of $2.00 plus (up from ~$1.30 reported for fiscal 2015) and to get there the company has touted the Alstom acquisition and GE Digital as the two key growth drivers. The Alstom acquisition is already positively impacting operations, as described in this article , and management again reaffirmed expectations that these assets will be accretive to 2018 earnings in the range of $0.15-$0.20 per share. The digital push, however, is still in the early innings. Recently, the company announced several key digital partnership: BP plc (NYSE: BP ) and GE launched a joint digitial solution , Plant Operations Advisor, which is expected to greatly benefit the oil and gas company's operations. SAP SE and GE agreed to work together to promote innovation and growth in the Industrial Internet of Things (\"IIoT\") industry. GE has a hefty goal of achieving $15b in software sales by 2020, which is a three-fold increase from the $5b in sales reported for full-year 2015. These partnerships, along with other deals that have been announced over the past six plus months, shows that GE is already making great progress in the digital space so long-term investors should be excited about GE Digital's future growth prospects. Investor's main concern is the belief that GE is currently overvalued, as the company is trading at a P/E ratio that is well-above 20. I tend to only invest in companies that are trading at \"rich\" valuations when there are legitimate reasons for me to believe that (1) the company is able to grow into the valuation within a reasonable amount of time and (2) the company is best-of-breed in its industry. GE meets this criteria, in my opinion. Current P/E",

      "text": "Enlarge Picture GE Advanced Materials Boron Nitride coatings provide the benefits of BNexcellent lubricity, non-wetting, and high temperature stabilityin an easy-to-apply medium for a wide range of applications. Release Agents, Lubricants, and Protective Coatings- Boron nitride remains lubricious and inert even at extremely high temperatures. Coatings made with BN prevent sticking to increase the life of dies/molds, improve product surface finishes, and reduce production times. Metal Processing- In molten metal processing and metal forming applications, BN coatings protect surfaces which come into contact with hot and molten metals. BN inhibits corrosion and chemical attack and provides easier release and longer mold/die life. Applications include casting, stamping, forging, extrusion, and powder metallurgy. Glass Making- Boron nitrides high temperature lubricating properties make it ideal in glass making, where it helps to minimize surface defects, improves mold/die life and release, and reduces clean-up time. Most glass formulations will not stick to BN. Plastic/Rubber- Producers of -molded plastics and elastomers benefit from BN in die and molding applications. Boron nitride improves die release and increases production speeds. Sintering- Sintering of metallic and ceramic powders is typically done on graphite plates. A coating of BN can essentially eliminate carbon contamination, reactivity, and sticking all of which can occur at sintering temperatures. Welding and Brazing- Boron nitride coatings are ideal for welding and furnace brazing. They protect surfaces from weld spatter and provide superior stop-off protection. BN coatings also protect MIG/MAG welding nozzles from weld spatter Location : Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore, Pune , Ahmedabad, Vadodra,Surat, Vapi, Aurangabad, Kohlapur, Raigad, Raipur, Lucknow, Jaipur, Udaipur, Trivandrum, Coimbatore, Bhopal, Gurgaon, Raipur, Manesar, Bhubaneshwar, Jamshedpur, Hyderabad, Vizag, Vijayawada, Goa, Hosur, Nagpur, Rajkot, Kanpur, India Mob:9910899409",

      "title": "CIO Interview: Jim Fowler, GE",
      "text": "  \nJim Fowler, CIO of GE, has a challenge. The company’s CEO, Jeff Immelt is very tech savvy. “Jeff is one of the most intelligent men I have ever met,” says Fowler. He doesn’t forget anything.”   Brexit and UK tech: Essential guide \nFind your way in the post-Brexit world and establish priorities in the face of uncertainty   \nGE is a 120-year-old company, and has survived, according to Fowler, because it has had great leaders, like Immelt, who can see around the corner. \nThey are able to catch a new wave of innovation and transform the business internally before external forces disrupt GE’s business. \nIn many ways, Immelt is the company’s chief digital officer. “Our role here is to help,” says Fowler. \nWhen he joined the company 16 years ago, Fowler says the focus for IT was on cost: “How do we make IT costs go down? The role of the CIO was just to run IT as cheaply as possible.” \nIn the past, large organisations outsourced vast chunks of IT, because it was not considered core to the business. GE was no exception. It previously outsourced 70% of its IT to an offshore preferred provider. \nBut at the same time, he says, outsourcing was risky, both to the IT function and the business itself. Specifically, outsourcing made IT ill-prepared for the transformation that was about to occur with digitisation. \n“We caused ourselves to be commoditised and we were not able to see a future where all of the data and information came together, or how it was connected to drive the next level of industrial revolution,” says Fowler. \nComputer Weekly met with Fowler in San Francisco, during the company’s Minds + Machine conference . Today, under Immelt’s leadership, Fowler sees his role as very different. Turning an industrial giant into a software company \nImmelt’s vision is to turn the industrial giant into a top-10 software company, and IT is a key asset the company will use to drive data efficiencies, both internally and externally. The software the company creates then evolves into the products and services GE provides to its customers. \nIn Fowler’s opinion, the role of CIO today bears very little similarity to the role is was when IT was outsourced. He says the modern CIO must also be a fully fledged business leader. “This means signing up for things that matter, such as revenue, variable cost productivity, cash generation and inventory turnover, and not talking about obsolescence or performance and availability.” \nAs head of the company’s IT function, he says his own role is about change. He aims “to change the mentality of IT”, so it moves away from being a backroom operation and makes data a strategic company asset. \n“I have to be at the table, helping my business partners to understand how to disrupt,” he says. Bring IT back in-house \nFowler argues that obsolescence, performance and availability are “givens” that any CIO should be able to execute as part of the job. \nWhen he became CIO 18 months ago, 75% of GE’s IT work was outsourced. “I would dial into a bridge call during an outage, and would hear 20 people on the call yelling at one person – who, by the way, was not a GE employee – to try to figure out what was going on and why our business process was broken,” he says. \nSignificantly, the call was not about the technology. Rather, the internal team was taking the outsourcer to task over a broken GE business process. \n“We had given up the fundamental knowledge of how our business runs, and given away that knowledge capital,” he says. The company took a decision to insource, to get back this know-how. \n“The idea of having legacy IT teams has gone. IT is not about spending two hours every morning changing tapes” \nJim Fowler, GE \nThe formation of GE Digital, headed by Bill Ruh, shifted the mindset of internal IT. “We used to think about IT as project work,” says Fowler. “We have a generation of people who manage projects. But ultimately, we needed to think of IT as a product. \n“One of the revelations we had in the past year was that internal IT at GE should be no different to a software company. We just so happen to be doing it inside the company.” \nBy organising around products and product lines, he says GE’s IT team can focus on the business in a more tangible way. IT people take long-term ownership of the products they develop. Addressing the legacy argument \nFowler says many of his peers ask about legacy IT. \nHe recalls a recent meeting, where he asked people in the room what they understood by the term “legacy”. “I got everything from ‘the person who maintains the IT systems at the plant’ to ‘the person who changes the backup tapes’. \n“The idea of having legacy IT teams has gone. IT is not about spending two hours every morning changing tapes,” says Fowler. \n“None of my datacentres have any tapes. As for the plant, the person is not just working in your individual plant. They are the PhD leader who owns the product line for the manufacturing system that runs across 50 plants.” We have a generation of people who manage projects. But ultimately, we needed to think of IT as a product Jim Fowler, GE \nHe says people still look at what IT meant 20 years ago and do not appreciate that it has evolved. But he admits GE has 9,000 legacy applications. \n“A large percentage of these are not strategic,” says Fowler. “Each of my businesses has an application portfolio plan, which designates which applications are core and which ones should go away. We starve the funding on the ones that should go away and we are putting all the funding into the applications that are strategic.” \nFowler wants to demonstrate the saving to the business of removing legacy software . “When we complete an application portfolio plan, we can show each of our business partners what every individual application costs to run.” \nWhen they are paying hundreds of thousands of dollars for applications used by only one or two individuals, says Fowler, it helps IT convince the business leaders that legacy software is not just an IT problem, but a business problem the company must solve. A case for efficient nuts and bolts \nPredix is GE Digital’s flagship platform for the industrial internet. It can glue together machine, engineering and sourcing data. This has enabled internal IT to write software to analyse things in a different way. During his presentation at Minds + Machines, Fowler described one such application. \nThe IT team developed an application to connect systems across the company to find overlaps. The application was developed to solve a seemingly simple problem: how to identify which fasteners (such as nuts, bolts, screws and washers) were being used across all of GE’s businesses. \n“We spend $250m on fasteners, and we wanted to look at addressing duplication,” says Fowler. \nThe application compares 3D models across every GE business to identify parts that are similar or the same, but which GE pays different prices for. The potential benefits of solving this duplicate order problem have huge potential across all of GE’s businesses. \n“If I can do that with bolts, nuts, screws and washers, then suddenly I start doing this for other parts too, such as fan blades, parts coming out of castings or rotating parts, across businesses where there is a lot of similarity,” he says. Read more about GE’s digital strategy GE’s stated policy is to become a top-10 software company by 2020 . The company set out its action plan at its Minds + Machines conference in San Francisco. Global manufacturer GE has established a partner programme for its Predix platform to drive the value of analytics across the industrial internet. \nFurthermore, he says this is not just a benefit for sourcing, but it can feed back into engineering to help the company design products faster. “Engineers will be able to pull in products that meet needs from other parts of the business,” says Fowler. \nIt is a precursor to GE’s big plans for the future, dubbed the digital thread. \nFor Fowler, the digital thread is about applying the productivity GE can achieve internally through initiatives such as the application for deduplicating fastener orders to create commercial products that it can sell externally. \nThe head of GE manufacturing, for example, is reaching into the manufacturing software systems supported by Fowler’s IT teams to build products that can be commercialised. \nSimilarly, the recent ServiceMax acquisition will take advantage of the software Fowler’s IT department has built, which supports services to develop externally facing ones. “It is not only about eating our own dog food, but helping to create the next great set of applications to run our customers’ companies,” he adds. \nThe systems Fowler’s IT team are now building are designed to work horizontally across GE. “We had to build the applications in a way that could run across multiple businesses in GE,” he said. \nThis means application coding, architecture and structure could work equally well externally, in a customer’s business. \nFowler works for a CEO who is globally renowned for understanding IT’s potential to disrupt business. The company began this journey with Predix a few years ago. Now, the internal business process Fowler’s team has decided to make more efficient – that of centralising fastener orders in a bid to reduce duplication – has the potential to lead to the next killer app at GE.

      "text": "GE, union seek way forward after deal rejected Grace Schneider , @gesinfk 6:43 p.m. EST November 23, 2016 Union chief: \"Haier has the flexibility as far as where they can make appliances.\" Buy Photo Workers at Appliance Park turned down the contract offer by 72 percent, leaving the company and the union to regroup. (Photo: CJ file photo) Buy Photo \nThe rejection of a proposed contract by hourly workers at Appliance Park on Tuesday ignited a flood of questions, the biggest centering on what kind of deal could gain the support of a skeptical workforce that shot down the first offer by 72 percent. \nNeither the president of the union nor company officials would predict how the parties might revise the four-year contract or how quickly they could return to the bargaining table to forge another contract. At the same time, neither side seemed confident of an easy task ahead. \n\"Both parties are willing to talk,\" Dana Crittenden, president of IUE-CWA Local 83761, said on Wednesday after speaking earlier that day with executives for Haier, the new owners of GE Appliance Park. The parties also were set to huddle again before the Thanksgiving holiday. \nThe tentative pact would have provided $5,500 in incremental cash payments through January 2019, instead of percentage raises. It also called for paying overtime after an employee puts in 40 hours in a week – not after 8 hours in a day, as is the current practice. Another change involved shift differential, for workers on second and third, or overnight, shifts which offered a $1 an hour premium to current employees after April 2020, instead of the current 10 percent. New workers would receive 50 cents an hour. \nOvertime changes were \"an issue across the board\" for workers as was the lack of raises that could increase paychecks consistently in the future. Skilled trades workers expressed concern about the company's ongoing push to outsource work that has traditionally been done by on-site union electricians and machinists, he said. \nKim Freeman, a spokeswoman for Appliance Park, said that the proposed beginning wage of $12 an hour, down from the current $15.51, has received a lot of attention. But workers would receive $13 an hour – and the start of 401k benefits – after a year. All newer workers would remain in a \"flexible workforce pool\" and after a year would be given a \"regular position\" if and when a position became available. \nThose who transition are paid $14 an hour, which means it's a \"phased approach\" that allows for a rapid increase, she said. \nWorkers and Haier needed to reach a new contract after the company closed on its $5.6 billion purchase of GE's appliances division in June. The four-year deal would have covered hourly workers. Some 2,000 salaried employees also are on the park's payroll. \nFreeman repeated the assertion that the company and union put an offer on the table that they felt was fair and would allow the company to reverse \"hundreds of millions of dollars in losses\" at Appliance Park and allow Haier to better compete globally. \nCrittenden said that he and other union leaders felt they needed to work with the company on trimming costs because they were concerned about losing jobs if the appliance maker decided to withdraw operations at the complex. \"Haier has the flexibility as far as where they can make appliances,\" he said, adding that the company also took a risk in offering no raises when workers see solicitations elsewhere for jobs paying $14 and $15 an hour. \nDavid MacGregor, chief executive and appliance industry analyst with New York-based Longbow Research, said that Haier's attempt to drop the starting wage from $15.51 an hour to $12 an hour was a gutsy play that was bound to engender pessimism from workers and the broader community. \"Haier is asking the people in Louisville to take 23 percent less.\" \nMacGregor noted that Whirlpool appliance manufacturing in Ohio and Iowa pay $13.46 an hour and $15 an hour, respectively. \nThose who've watched what's happening in Louisville wonder whether the contract offer was a way for Haier to recoup some of the cash it spent on buying the division after GE withdrew a year ago from its $3.3 billion sale agreement with Swedish-based Electrolux. \"Most people would tell you (that) they overpaid for\" the company, MacGregor said. \nDennis Rocheleau, a retired GE labor negotiator from Wisconsin, bargained several contracts in Louisville for the company. He said the situation at Appliance Park is a departure from most first-time contracts because most initial contracts follow an affirmative vote by a union to establish collective bargaining at a company. But GE workers have been unionized for decades, and workers were bound to feel put upon if they'd already made concessions in previous contracts. \nFor Haier, the first contract is high stakes because it establishes a baseline for future agreements. The trouble with offering a lower starting wage, Rocheleau said, is that if the offer is rejected, as it was, workers may question the company's credibility if negotiators ultimately return with a rate of $13 to $14 an hour to start. They'd wonder why that wasn't on the table in the first place. \nRocheleau guessed the mood of workers reflects that of many blue-collar men and women who voted for President-elect Donald Trump. \"They've about had enough of this\" and they're not afraid to say no, he said. \nGetting a yes from workers now is the goal, Crittenden said. He said he expects the parties to soon regroup. \"Somehow we'll find a mutual agreement,\" he said. \nReporter Grace Schneider can be reached at (502) 582-4082 or gschneider@courier-journal.com. 36 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://cjky.it/2ghry0p More Stories",

      "text": "Send Message Summary \nGE's CEO Jeffery Immelt has had enough. He is really, truly remaking GE into a digital industrial company, naysayers be damned. \nIn the process he has made and continues to make deal after deal. \nTrue believers should profit from the mayhem; skeptics who need hard metrics for proof are going to find little for several years. Introduction GE (NYSE: GE ) is one of the most exciting stories in the investment arena. Love it or hate it, you should at least follow it. It is undergoing a historic re-sculpting from an old-style conglomerate to a finely honed digital industrial powerhouse. What the heck is a \"digital industrial powerhouse\"? Insofar as it is an emerging and disruptive field no one knows for sure probably not even its chief architects. Mssrs Immelt, Bornstein, Joyce and Ruh, Mmes Comstock and Sylvester and countless others are in the process of building it nonetheless. This is fascinating stuff, well worth your attention. I have just finished watching long YouTube videos from GE's 4th annual Minds + Machines Conference. I am sold on both the enormity of the opportunity and the seriousness with which GE is pursuing it. When you buy GE stock you get a two-for-one deal. You get one of America's top industrial companies with major stakes in several of America's leading traditional industrial franchises. In addition, you get a foothold in several of America's most exciting emerging industrial technologies. These include additive manufacturing, IoT and emerging technologies centered around LED lighting. The combination of GE's great scale coupled with its emerging competencies makes for a uniquely attractive investment vehicle. GE's CEO Jeffery Immelt has had enough. He is really, truly remaking GE into a digital industrial company, naysayers be damned. In his keynote speech for GE's most recent Minds + Machines Conference in San Francisco, CEO Immelt displayed the following slide to show a rough breakout of GE's most recent initiatives to implement its new digital industrial strategy: Click to enlarge The \"All In\" language seems directed to assure potential partners and developers that GE is serious about its intentions. Unfortunately, GE has something of a rap as \"big idea\" dilettante. That is a hard rap to shake. Protesting about the fixedness of your current enthusiasm is not dissimilar from the compulsive liar who swears that \"this time\" he is telling the truth or the drunkard who assures that this time he is on the wagon for good. While recognizing the problem, GE has convinced me. I believe that GE has accomplished enough in recent years to convince me that it is in for the long haul. Immelt and crew have transformed the old amorphous hodgepodge that used to make up GE in the bad old days. In 2008 when things went so wrong, GE consisted of a combination of industrials cum financier cum property magnate cum media magnate cum home appliances and light bulbs for consumers company. Whew, that's a lot of stuff. The new GE is becoming a taut industrial company with outcroppings that support its industrial mission in the area of finance, additive manufacturing, software, digital and lighting. I expect that when my descendants study business administration, Jack Welsh will have been consigned to the dustbin of history, while Jeffrey Immelt's strategies will be studied in detail. In the process he is making deal after deal. Sculpting involves the less interesting subtractive part of the new GE. GE has done that in spades over the last many years as it jettisoned division after division. Its most recent exercises in the art have severely pruned finance and sold out appliances. The constructing part is generally more interesting because it tells us about GE's future, not its past. GE's biggest recent acquisition deals, its Alstom acquisition and Baker Hughes (NYSE: BHI ) deal have been fully covered in great detail elsewhere. I will not discuss them here. Newer far smaller deals including deals that have yet to close exist in plentiful supply. Six of these smaller more recent deals include Bit Stew, Wise.io, ServiceMax, Arcam, Concept Laser and Meridium. Each of these potential acquisitions provides a piece of the puzzle which will help the new digital industrial GE reach its highest potential. Bit Stew is a Canadian company that helps to maximize efficient data integration . It will work with Predix to communicate between applications in the field and the cloud. Wise.io is a company that works to improve machine learning . It will advance Predix capacities in this important aspect of its mission. The ServiceMax acquisition also announced in November 2016 adds a platform for optimizing field service operations that GE can integrate into its industrial internet. Arcam and Concept Laser are additive manufacturing companies. Additive manufacturing is an important piece of GE's industrial internet puzzle. In the proper applications, such as prototyping and short run manufacturing, additive manufacturing dramatically increases production time. This provides an edge for those companies able to effectively use these techniques. The next acquisition, Meridium is a pioneer in the key area of Asset Performance Management (APM). APM is an application that helps businesses to gather information from their important industrial assets. It provides the following advantages: \nIndustrial companies that analyze and optimize their machines are positioned to succeed in the era of the Industrial Internet. The steps sound simple, but they deliver big results. Using machine sensors to monitor equipment performance generates a constant stream of in-depth data, which can be consolidated into a central hub and used to derive meaningful insights. Operators with this capability gain actionable information that can increase asset reliability and enables more precise maintenance actions, reducing cost of ownership . True believers should profit from the mayhem; skeptics who need proof are going to find little for several years. As a net result of so many acquisitions and dispositions it is difficult to compare GE's recent overall Q/Q results on the basis of consistent comparable activities. It is particularly difficult to assess how its forays into its digital initiatives are faring. Those who believe GE is on the forefront of the next big thing can take advantage of the apparent disregard the market has for GE's digital endeavors. I imply such disregard from reading comment streams on SA and from GE's price action (negative) earlier in the year when it announced its bid for Arcam and SLM. I also note that digital issues do not appear to be top of mind when analysts ask questions during GE's conference calls. Under the best of circumstances it should take years for this to play out. There are three reasonable stances investors can take in the interim: (1) head for the hills if they think GE is drowning in a vat of buzz words; (2) if they think GE is on to something great, as I do, they can top off their GE stock on pullbacks so that they have a full position in the name; or, (3) if they think this is just another in a long series of distracting but harmless diversions they can stand pat with their historic GE position. Conclusion GE is definitely on the move. It bears watching. The Minds + Machines conference was a real eye opener. Some of the most interesting presentations were made on individual divisions such as healthcare, energy and oil and gas. I am hoping to prepare articles showing how GE's digital strategies put it in the very forefront of some very traditional industries. When GE's digital strategies start to pay off they are going to have powerful force multipliers. As I said, this is exciting stuff. Disclosure: I am/we are long GE.

      "text": "GE Remains Poised for Growth Despite Prevailing Headwinds Zacks Equity Research Tweet Share On Nov 25, Zacks Investment Research updated the research report on industrial goods manufacturer General Electric Company GE.General Electric is pruning its operating portfolio to focus on core manufacturing businesses with a digital edge. At the same time, the company has been selectively acquiring assets to boost its Industrial Internet vision. Industrial Internet Focus A few days back, GE Digital acquired ServiceMax, a premier cloud-based field service management solutions provider. The buyout will enable General Electric to automate and digitize the servicing of heavy-duty machinery as it aims to focus on core manufacturing businesses with a digital edge.The acquisition is likely to accelerate the commercialization of the Predix software of General Electric. Predix is designed to add intelligence to the Internet of Things applications. It helps companies to connect their machines, data and people and run industrial-scale analytics. The combination of machine connectivity with a data lifecycle management platform powered by engineering simulation will help diverse firms to design their products for the Industrial Internet in the best way possible. This would facilitate the company to accelerate GE Digital’s existing services solution roadmaps and augment its digital focus.In September, GE Digital acquired Meridium, Inc., a global leader in asset performance management (APM) software and services for asset-intensive industries. Meridium combines real-time analytics with reliability-centered maintenance services to offer an integrated APM solution for its clients. The acquisition will facilitate GE Digital to augment its comprehensive APM offering by leveraging Meridium’s expertise in cognitive analytics, reliability-centered maintenance, operational risk management and asset health, as well as intelligent asset strategies. Hints of Re-Conglomeration On Oct 31, General Electric inked a definitive agreement with Baker Hughes Incorporated BHI to merge its Oil & Gas business with the latter to form an industry leader with an unrivalled mix of service and equipment capabilities. Under the terms of the agreement, GE Oil & Gas and Baker Hughes will form a new entity (the “New” Baker Hughes) using a partnership structure, pursuant to which both the parties will contribute their operating assets to the newly formed partnership. General Electric will own the majority stake of 62.5% in the new company, and the remainder will be held by the erstwhile Baker Hughes shareholders.With a complimentary portfolio of operating assets and integrated offerings, the new entity will be able to better serve the existing customers of both the companies. The transaction will reportedly create the second largest player in the oilfield equipment and services industry.The partnership with Baker Hughes portrays re-conglomeration efforts by General Electric to arrest the dwindling sales of its Oil & Gas business. During third-quarter 2016, Oil & Gas revenues declined 25% year over year to $2,964 million, due to macroeconomic headwinds and volatility in oil prices. Experts widely believed that GE Oil & Gas business lacked product breadth and was losing market share in a few key product lines, leading to increased risk of asset erosion. The strategic deal, therefore, fortifies the beleaguered business to ramp up its operations to fend off competition from rivals like Schlumberger Limited SLB and Halliburton Company HAL. Moving Forward Although General Electric is taking steps to limit its financial exposure by divesting GE Capital assets, it remains susceptible to various market risks. The company’s objectives of simplification and productivity improvement pose operational execution risks as well. For a company as large as General Electric, the additional revenues needed for growth are quite large, posing a challenge to developing businesses on such a vast scale.Nevertheless, we remain encouraged with the healthy growth potential of this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock.

      "title": "GE CEO Jeff Immelt Says He's Ready For Trump",
      "text": "We’ll come to you. long read \nThe industrial giant makes most of its money overseas, but the boss says it can survive protectionist moves, as well as new rivals like IBM. \nJeff Immelt, CEO of General Electric \nPhoto by Jackson Patterson Sean Captain 11.25.16 10:00 AM \nJeff Immelt chuckles a lot. He gives off a very casual vibe for the CEO of a $273 billion multinational industrial powerhouse. Perhaps it's from being well settled into the CEO job, which he's held since taking over from Jack Welch in 2001. It's even evident as we're talking about some heavy topics—including the recent election—when we meet during GE's Minds+Machines conference in San Francisco on November 15, a week after election day. If Immelt is worried about the rise of a president with whom he has strong, public disagreements, he's hiding it pretty well. \nThe Republican CEO worked with the president-elect when The Apprentice aired on NBC, back when the network was owned by GE, and he said in an August Vanity Fair interview that he was fond of Trump. \"But there’s just no place for discrimination in our place or any other company or in the U.S., so the comments about Mexico or Muslims, that’s unacceptable to us,\" said Immelt. \"We can make and sell things everyplace we need to.\" \nThey disagree on policy, too. Immelt is an advocate of globalization in a country, and world, souring on unfettered trade. He defiantly laid out his philosophy in a May 20 commencement address to MBA students of the elite NYU Stern School of Business that was as much GE infomercial as pep talk for the grads. \"Our trade deals are languishing in Congress,\" said Immelt, later adding. \"Industrial exports are not a priority for the U.S.\" Ellevest's Sallie Krawcheck, investor Keith Rabois, and several dozen other tech leaders offer their wish lists for the new administration. \nGE's response has been to increasingly move overseas, he tells me. \"Almost 70% of our revenue is outside the United States,\" says Immelt, sitting relaxed in a suit but open-collar shirt, without a tie. Though crowned in bushy white hair, the 60-year old actually looks younger in person than in photos. \"We have factories everyplace,\" he says. \"We can make and sell things everyplace we need to. We don't need to import or export or do whatever.\" Yet he follows by saying that GE is the United States' second-largest exporter (quoting a Financial Times article from 2015 ). Donald Trump certainly doesn't want to hurt exports, with his promises to bring back manufacturing jobs; but pulling back on free trade agreements risks that effect. \nTrump would pay the price for that, Immelt intimates. \"Between our employees\"—125,000 in the U.S.—\"and our suppliers, there's a million people in the US that depend on GE, that go to work every day,\" he says, and chuckles as he continues. \"These are people in all of the Trump districts, all of the red states, all of those counties. Probably every one has some connection to GE. We're proud of that, and we think our ability to win around the world creates jobs in Pennsylvania and Ohio and Michigan, Wisconsin, all those places.\" If he were holding a microphone, I wouldn't be surprised to see him drop it. The Internet Of Very Big Things \nIf the name of the company conference, Minds+Machines, doesn't make it clear enough, Immelt doesn't see GE as the kind of old-time industrial operations that Trump wants to restore. GE's portrayal of its future looks more like the kind of \"advanced manufacturing\" operations promoted by Hillary Clinton, or like the Silicon Valley firms that funded her—where software, networks, and artificial intelligence are integral. \n\"We call ourselves digital industrial,\" says Immelt. \"So what that kinda means is a material science-based, high-tech industrial company that is now really aspiring to lead the digital space around its core. So that means analytics. It means industrial software. It means ecosystem connectivity. It means additive manufacturing, and material flows, and all of that.\" These don't sound like traditional factory jobs, and they need more than traditional factory skills. The industrial giant is investing heavily in machine learning, with promises to save money on energy and maintenance. \nImmelt chaired the Obama administration's President’s Council on Jobs and Competitiveness , a group of private-sector leaders charged with advising the chief executive on economics, competitiveness, and \"ways to create jobs, opportunity, and prosperity for the American people.\" Promoting high-tech job training was one of the key recommendations of the group, and Immelt himself acknowledged that the recommendations seemed to make minimal impact, in a September interview at the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) . \n\"We basically made recommendations in four buckets—invest more in infrastructure, invest more in training and education, simplify regulations, and focus on small business,\" he said. \"We’ve done none of those—zero.\" \nIn a 2014 address to the National Governors Association , Immelt called for more investment in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) in the schools and for teaching advanced manufacturing skills in community colleges, but he doesn't absolve the private sector. \"I think business has a role to play because I don’t think as a community we invest enough in productivity and that we do enough in terms of job training, worker training, retraining,\" he said in the CFR interview. \"And business deserves some of the blame for the way our fellow citizens feel about what globalization has meant.\" \nImmelt has spoken of the need to improve high-tech training within GE, for example, decreeing that all office hires will learn to program. \"If you are joining the company in your 20's, unlike when I joined, you’re going to learn to code,\" he wrote in an August LinkedIn post . \"It doesn’t matter whether you are in sales, finance, or operations. You may not end up being a programmer, but you will know how to code.\" How does GE compete with IBM's much-hyped Watson? \nGE came to San Francisco to tout Predix , a cloud-based platform that gathers the huge amount of data from large connected devices like gas turbines, locomotives, or windmills. It then applies machine learning to analyze patterns and anomalies and identify better ways to run the machines, as well as to spot signs of an impending breakdown. Since GE announced Predix in August 2015, the company has purchased three machine learning companies and ServiceMax, which makes software for dispatching service personnel. But Bill Ruh, GE's chief digital officer, tells me it will take till mid-2017 to develop the full AI capabilities that Predix needs. \nThat requires getting software developers both inside and outside GE to build for the platform, creating what Immelt calls a \"partner ecosystem.\"\"Tech companies grow up with that,\" he says. \"You go to [Salesforce's conference] Dreamforce, there's like 100,000 developers.\" (That number is closer to total attendance.) \"That's new for someone like GE, and to see the multiplication effect, that's quite inspirational.\" \nGE's inaugural Predix developer's conference brought in 1,500 developers earlier this year, versus 1,300 coders at IBM's Watson Developers Conference in early January. IBM last year launched its Watson Internet of Things division, which competes with Predix by applying artificial intelligence to analyzing and coordinating connected devices and machinery. \nHow does GE compete with IBM's own cloud analytics platform, I ask. \"So this unbelievable deep industrial knowledge, I think, gives us a strength that a retailer didn't have or a network didn't have,\" Immelt answers. On the show floor, I overhear a GE exec make a similar argument to a customer as to why GE beats IBM. (When I ask about his background, he says he used to work at IBM.) \nGE also must contend with its German rival Siemens, which offers a service very similar to Predix called Sinalytics . It's also a data gathering and analysis platform for a range of similar devices, including trains, gas turbines, and wind turbines. Like Predix, Sinalytics includes \"digital twins\"—virtual copies of machines like turbines, generated from the live stream of sensor data. The twin can be used to study how a machine or a collection of machines is working and try out different configurations to save energy or reduce wear and tear. Immelt's eyes dance when he talks about the technique. \n\"That was only like half of an idea four or five years ago, and now you see it on steroids. You see it working,\" he says. Like GE, Siemens also makes medical imaging devices, as does Philips. Like GE, Philips has its own cloud system linking its medical devices to manage and analyze the data they generate. Digital twins are virtual copies of machinery based on realtime sensor data. \nImmelt has reined in the sprawl that occurred under Welch. The company sold its remaining stake in NBC Universal to Comcast in 2013 for $16.7 billion, and it recently sold its appliance division to Chinese consumer tech company Haier for $5.6 billion. It also pared back GE Capital , its once too-big-to-fail financing division that accounted for about 41% of earnings between 2000 and 15. By 2018, GE expects it will contribute less than 10%. \"I think the luxury that I have and almost nobody else in the world has is, I don't have to be right about which fuel wins. Cause I've got a chip on all of them.\" \nBig machines, with software and networks to run them, is where Immelt is staking GE's claim. \"I think there was no inherent strength necessarily that NBC had when Netflix came along, right. But there is an inherent advantage that we have when the industrial internet comes along because of the assets,\" he says. \"If I get sick of this,\" he says, holding up his smartphone, \"or you get sick of that [pointing to mine], you throw it away. You don't do that with a jet engine or a gas turbine.\" Again, Immelt laughs. I chuckle back, though I'm not sure I have the cash flow to support throwing away my phone. It's All Good For GE \nGE may have narrowed its focus to heavy machinery, but that's still a very broad realm. GE makes train locomotives and the engines for planes and ships. It makes medical imaging devices like MRI machines and PET/CT scanners. It makes equipment for oil and gas drilling. And it makes energy almost every way possible. \"Think of us as the broadest in the world,\" says Immelt. \"We have gas, nuclear, steam, energy storage, fuel cells, wind, solar, energy efficiency. So we've got kind of every place in between.\" (Steam includes the turbines in coal-fired plants.) \n\"I think the luxury that I have and almost nobody else in the world has is, I don't have to be right about which fuel wins,\" says Immelt, laughing. \"Cause I've got a chip on all of them.\" Whether or not President Trump brings back coal or kills solar, GE will have something to sell. It goes beyond generation. If coal grows, so does the demand for locomotives to haul it (and maybe for medical-imaging devices to diagnose lung damage from pollution). \nAll the presidential candidates promised to modernize infrastructure, which could include the crumbling electricity grid. GE makes equipment for that, and for making the grid more flexible to deal with the daily waxing and waning of power from wind farms. GE also has a service called Current that uses Predix to study energy use in buildings (from offices to factories). Current also sells solar panels, LED lighting, and electric car-charging stations to companies that want to green up. GE has developed something like Siri for industrial machines, so engineers can ask a turbine or jet engine what's wrong and how to fix it. \nImmelt does speak up for the environment, somewhat. \"In our company, we believe that climate change is real and is caused by man. So we have run our company with that as a context,\" he says, \"but we've never picked a winner or loser in terms of fuel. Our approach has been, infuse technology, and let's make everything more efficient.\" \nImmelt's belief in science puts him again at odds with Trump, who has taken a detour around a mountain of scientific evidence to claim that global warming is a hoax (and that there's no drought in California). Trump has also picked climate change conspiracy theorist Myron Ebell of the Competitive Enterprise Institute to head the Environmental Protection Agency. \nImmelt still sees an upshot to coal plants, which are typically 35% energy efficient, he says. \"If you take that from 35% to 40% efficiency, that reduces more carbon than an incredible influx of solar or other renewable energies. So there's a lot of different ways to skin the cat,\" he says. Populist Punching Bag \nGE has been a bull's-eye for populists on both the left and the right, with accusations of exporting U.S. jobs and booking profits in other countries with low taxation in order to skirt U.S. taxes. A 2011 investigation by the New York Times reported that clever (though legal) accounting allowed GE to pay no U.S. taxes in some years. \"A localization strategy can’t be shut down by protectionist politics.\" \n\"We sell around the world, we pay the taxes we owe,\" Immelt tells me, calmly. But he can be combative on other occasions, like following accusations made in April by then-candidate Bernie Sanders in an interview with the New York Daily News , saying \"What we have seen over the many years is shutting down of many major plants in this country. Sending jobs to low-wage countries,\" said Sanders. \"And General Electric, doing a very good job avoiding the taxes.\" \nImmelt was fast on the defensive in a Washington Post editorial . \"We create wealth and jobs, instead of just calling for them in speeches,\" wrote Immelt, who called the accusations of tax avoidance lies. After rattling off stats of how many people GE employs in the U.S., (including in Sanders's Vermont) and how much it exports, Immelt concluded by saying, \"It seems Sen. Sanders is missing the point.\" \nWhat critics call job exporting, GE might call contending with a government that doesn't support its industries internationally, as with fewer trade barriers and better financial support through the U.S. Export-Import Bank. \"GE has 420 factories around the world giving us tremendous flexibility,\" Immelt told the NYU grads. \"We used to have one site to make locomotives; now we have multiple global sites that give us market access. A localization strategy can’t be shut down by protectionist politics.\" \nSanders didn't make it to the White House, but along with President-elect Trump comes his far-right chief strategist Steve Bannon. He was no kinder to GE—though for different reasons—speaking to a 2014 conference, according to a transcript recently published by BuzzFeed . \"General Electric and these major corporations that are in bed with the federal government are not what we’d consider free-enterprise capitalists…They're what we call corporatist. They want to have more and more monopolistic power, and they’re doing that kind of convergence with big government,\" said Bannon. The company's Minds+Machine's conference in San Francisco on November 15 Jackson Patterson \nTo some extent, GE and the government have been collaborating. Obama did pick Immelt to chair the President’s Council on Jobs and Competitiveness, and Immelt also serves on the board of the New York Federal Reserve Bank. \nI ask Immelt if there are ways that a Trump administration can hurt GE, and it's the one time that he stumbles in his response. \"Again, I'm just not. I'm, I'm, I just think we should, we should give him the chance to kinda pick his team, and get going and see what happens,\" he says. What's Great For America Is Great For GE? \nYet there are important ways that Trump's plans to make America great again could be great for GE, too. It starts with GE's biggest source of bad press—taxes. \"We believe in comprehensive tax reform,\" Immelt tells me. \"And I hope that's one of the priorities of the new administration, is to get a tax system that is more contemporary with the global footprint that is required today.\" \nImmelt would like a reduction of corporate taxes from about 35% to \"the low 20s,\" he says, along with curtailment of the many deductions that make the effective tax rate much lower, anyway. Trump would go even further, taking the tax rate down to 15%. Trump will soon have to prove he's the manager he says he is. One expert in public-private innovation explains how he can pull it off. \n\"You would have elements that would simplify the code, promote investment, lower the rate, take away deductions, and then have some kind of territorial system so that companies can move cash around the world, with clearly established rules,\" says Immelt. GE has kept its money abroad, say critics, to avoid paying U.S. taxes, though it's hardly alone. Moody's reckons that U.S. companies will have piled up $1.3 trillion overseas by the end of the year. Among the biggest hoarders are tech companies, the sector that supported Hillary Clinton. GE's foreign cash holdings are about $100 billion, according to research firm Capital Economics. Apple's are about $200 billion, according to Statista . Trump has called for slashing taxes to 10% on money that companies like GE or any of the tech giants bring back into the U.S. \nImmelt rails against regulations—as does Trump. \"Government has failed to promote growth in almost every corner of the world. In the U.S., regulation has expanded while infrastructure has lagged,\" he said in his commencement address. Trump has also decried the state of U.S. infrastructure and introduced a plan to spur $1 trillion of private investment. Part of the plan is $137 billion in federal tax credits. If any of Trump's plan works, there could be money in it for GE. \n\"First and foremost I'd say, is that even before President Trump became president we had positioned the company for a time period where trade deals would be very hard to do,\" says Immelt. \"We're ready for a more protectionist government.\" Never miss a story.

      "text": "Robin Augustin | November 26, 2016 The youth activist says he will not join any party for now and will push for change through his Gerakan Anak Muda Selamatkan Sabah organisation. \nPETALING JAYA: Sabahan youth activist Jufazli Shi Ahmad has confirmed he will stand in the next general election (GE14), but will not join any political party for now. \nIn an interview with FMT, the 26-year old said he would continue his push for change in Sabah through his Gerakan Anak Muda Selamatkan Sabah (GAMSS) organisation. \n“I have received offers from a number of political parties, but at the moment I do not want to join any party. I will continue to speak up through GAMMS.” \nHe said he had been asked by many people to stand in GE14. \nHe would stand on the ticket of a party which offered Sabahans the best deal and was committed to fighting corruption in the state. \nJufazli, who boasts close to 40,000 Facebook fans, said GAMMS had five core struggles. \nFirst on the list, he said, was bringing an end to alleged corruption in Sabah by Umno and BN. \nHe also said GAMSS was pushing for a new chief minister for Sabah and a new prime minister to develop Sabah. \nThe former Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Masters student explained it was crucial to defeat and remove Chief Minister Musa Aman and Umno in Sabah. \nHe felt this was important so that the federal government could listen to Sabah’s demands, rather than it being a mere fixed deposit of the BN. \n“We also want to ensure Sabah’s sovereignty within the federation,” he said, adding this meant an end to the Philippines’ claim over the state. \nAnother core struggle was Sabah’s development, charging that the state government had failed to develop Sabah properly. \n“We also want to strengthen the two-party system in Sabah to ensure better check and balance of governance.” Jufazli said GAMSS was also focused on improving access to young eligible voters to register as voters. \n“My message to Sabahans is to be brave in pushing for change. Our short-term goal is to remove Musa and Najib through democratic means. \n“Our long-term vision is for Sabah to progress, implement institutional reforms and restore Sabah’s rights, as enshrined in the Malaysia Agreement 1963.” \nEarlier this month, Jufazli, who is well-known in Sabah for his criticisms of Musa and the Sabah government, was arrested. \nHe was investigated under Section 500 of the Penal Code for defamation, Section 233 of the Communications and Multimedia Act 1998 and Section 4(1) of the Sedition Act 1948. \nHe has yet to be charged in court.",

      "title": "GE CEO Jeff Immelt Says He's Ready For Trump | Fast Company | Business + Innovation",
      "text": "Jeff Immelt chuckles a lot. He gives off a very casual vibe for the CEO of a $273 billion multinational industrial powerhouse. Perhaps it&apos;s from being well settled into the CEO job, which he&apos;s held since taking over from Jack Welch in 2001. It&apos;s even evident as we&apos;re talking about some heavy topics—including the recent election—when we meet during GE&apos;s Minds+Machines conference in San Francisco on November 15, a week after election day. If Immelt is worried about the rise of a president with whom he has strong, public disagreements, he&apos;s hiding it pretty well.\nThe Republican CEO worked with the president-elect when The Apprentice aired on NBC, back when the network was owned by GE, and he said in an August Vanity Fair interview that he was fond of Trump. \"But there’s just no place for discrimination in our place or any other company or in the U.S., so the comments about Mexico or Muslims, that’s unacceptable to us,\" said Immelt.\n\"We can make and sell things everyplace we need to.\" They disagree on policy, too. Immelt is an advocate of globalization in a country, and world, souring on unfettered trade. He defiantly laid out his philosophy in a May 20 commencement address to MBA students of the elite NYU Stern School of Business that was as much GE infomercial as pep talk for the grads. \"Our trade deals are languishing in Congress,\" said Immelt, later adding. \"Industrial exports are not a priority for the U.S.\"\nWhat Silicon Valley Wants From The Trump White House Ellevest&apos;s Sallie Krawcheck, investor Keith Rabois, and several dozen other tech leaders offer their wish lists for the new administration. GE&apos;s response has been to increasingly move overseas, he tells me. \"Almost 70% of our revenue is outside the United States,\" says Immelt, sitting relaxed in a suit but open-collar shirt, without a tie. Though crowned in bushy white hair, the 60-year old actually looks younger in person than in photos. \"We have factories everyplace,\" he says. \"We can make and sell things everyplace we need to. We don&apos;t need to import or export or do whatever.\" Yet he follows by saying that GE is the United States&apos; second-largest exporter (quoting a Financial Times article from 2015 ). Donald Trump certainly doesn&apos;t want to hurt exports, with his promises to bring back manufacturing jobs; but pulling back on free trade agreements risks that effect.\nTrump would pay the price for that, Immelt intimates. \"Between our employees\"—125,000 in the U.S.—\"and our suppliers, there&apos;s a million people in the US that depend on GE, that go to work every day,\" he says, and chuckles as he continues. \"These are people in all of the Trump districts, all of the red states, all of those counties. Probably every one has some connection to GE. We&apos;re proud of that, and we think our ability to win around the world creates jobs in Pennsylvania and Ohio and Michigan, Wisconsin, all those places.\" If he were holding a microphone, I wouldn&apos;t be surprised to see him drop it.\nThe Internet Of Very Big Things If the name of the company conference, Minds+Machines, doesn&apos;t make it clear enough, Immelt doesn&apos;t see GE as the kind of old-time industrial operations that Trump wants to restore. GE&apos;s portrayal of its future looks more like the kind of \"advanced manufacturing\" operations promoted by Hillary Clinton, or like the Silicon Valley firms that funded her—where software, networks, and artificial intelligence are integral.\n\"We call ourselves digital industrial,\" says Immelt. \"So what that kinda means is a material science-based, high-tech industrial company that is now really aspiring to lead the digital space around its core. So that means analytics. It means industrial software. It means ecosystem connectivity. It means additive manufacturing, and material flows, and all of that.\" These don&apos;t sound like traditional factory jobs, and they need more than traditional factory skills.\nGE Wants To Be The Next Artificial Intelligence Powerhouse The industrial giant is investing heavily in machine learning, with promises to save money on energy and maintenance. Immelt chaired the Obama administration&apos;s President’s Council on Jobs and Competitiveness , a group of private-sector leaders charged with advising the chief executive on economics, competitiveness, and \"ways to create jobs, opportunity, and prosperity for the American people.\" Promoting high-tech job training was one of the key recommendations of the group, and Immelt himself acknowledged that the recommendations seemed to make minimal impact, in a September interview at the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) .\n\"We basically made recommendations in four buckets—invest more in infrastructure, invest more in training and education, simplify regulations, and focus on small business,\" he said. \"We’ve done none of those—zero.\"\nIn a 2014 address to the National Governors Association , Immelt called for more investment in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) in the schools and for teaching advanced manufacturing skills in community colleges, but he doesn&apos;t absolve the private sector. \"I think business has a role to play because I don’t think as a community we invest enough in productivity and that we do enough in terms of job training, worker training, retraining,\" he said in the CFR interview. \"And business deserves some of the blame for the way our fellow citizens feel about what globalization has meant.\"\nImmelt has spoken of the need to improve high-tech training within GE, for example, decreeing that all office hires will learn to program. \"If you are joining the company in your 20&apos;s, unlike when I joined, you’re going to learn to code,\" he wrote in an August LinkedIn post . \"It doesn’t matter whether you are in sales, finance, or operations. You may not end up being a programmer, but you will know how to code.\"\nHow does GE compete with IBM&apos;s much-hyped Watson? GE came to San Francisco to tout Predix , a cloud-based platform that gathers the huge amount of data from large connected devices like gas turbines, locomotives, or windmills. It then applies machine learning to analyze patterns and anomalies and identify better ways to run the machines, as well as to spot signs of an impending breakdown. Since GE announced Predix in August 2015, the company has purchased three machine learning companies and ServiceMax, which makes software for dispatching service personnel. But Bill Ruh, GE&apos;s chief digital officer, tells me it will take till mid-2017 to develop the full AI capabilities that Predix needs.\nThat requires getting software developers both inside and outside GE to build for the platform, creating what Immelt calls a \"partner ecosystem.\" \"Tech companies grow up with that,\" he says. \"You go to [Salesforce&apos;s conference] Dreamforce, there&apos;s like 100,000 developers.\" (That number is closer to total attendance.) \"That&apos;s new for someone like GE, and to see the multiplication effect, that&apos;s quite inspirational.\"\nGE&apos;s inaugural Predix developer&apos;s conference brought in 1,500 developers earlier this year, versus 1,300 coders at IBM&apos;s Watson Developers Conference in early January. IBM last year launched its Watson Internet of Things division, which competes with Predix by applying artificial intelligence to analyzing and coordinating connected devices and machinery.\nHow does GE compete with IBM&apos;s own cloud analytics platform, I ask. \"So this unbelievable deep industrial knowledge, I think, gives us a strength that a retailer didn&apos;t have or a network didn&apos;t have,\" Immelt answers. On the show floor, I overhear a GE exec make a similar argument to a customer as to why GE beats IBM. (When I ask about his background, he says he used to work at IBM.)\nGE also must contend with its German rival Siemens, which offers a service very similar to Predix called Sinalytics . It&apos;s also a data gathering and analysis platform for a range of similar devices, including trains, gas turbines, and wind turbines. Like Predix, Sinalytics includes \"digital twins\"—virtual copies of machines like turbines, generated from the live stream of sensor data. The twin can be used to study how a machine or a collection of machines is working and try out different configurations to save energy or reduce wear and tear. Immelt&apos;s eyes dance when he talks about the technique.\n\"That was only like half of an idea four or five years ago, and now you see it on steroids. You see it working,\" he says. Like GE, Siemens also makes medical imaging devices, as does Philips. Like GE, Philips has its own cloud system linking its medical devices to manage and analyze the data they generate.\nDigital twins are virtual copies of machinery based on realtime sensor data. Immelt has reined in the sprawl that occurred under Welch. The company sold its remaining stake in NBC Universal to Comcast in 2013 for $16.7 billion, and it recently sold its appliance division to Chinese consumer tech company Haier for $5.6 billion. It also pared back GE Capital , its once too-big-to-fail financing division that accounted for about 41% of earnings between 2000 and 15. By 2018, GE expects it will contribute less than 10%.\n\"I think the luxury that I have and almost nobody else in the world has is, I don&apos;t have to be right about which fuel wins. Cause I&apos;ve got a chip on all of them.\" Big machines, with software and networks to run them, is where Immelt is staking GE&apos;s claim. \"I think there was no inherent strength necessarily that NBC had when Netflix came along, right. But there is an inherent advantage that we have when the industrial internet comes along because of the assets,\" he says. \"If I get sick of this,\" he says, holding up his smartphone, \"or you get sick of that [pointing to mine], you throw it away. You don&apos;t do that with a jet engine or a gas turbine.\" Again, Immelt laughs. I chuckle back, though I&apos;m not sure I have the cash flow to support throwing away my phone.\nIt&apos;s All Good For GE GE may have narrowed its focus to heavy machinery, but that&apos;s still a very broad realm. GE makes train locomotives and the engines for planes and ships. It makes medical imaging devices like MRI machines and PET/CT scanners. It makes equipment for oil and gas drilling. And it makes energy almost every way possible. \"Think of us as the broadest in the world,\" says Immelt. \"We have gas, nuclear, steam, energy storage, fuel cells, wind, solar, energy efficiency. So we&apos;ve got kind of every place in between.\" (Steam includes the turbines in coal-fired plants.)\n\"I think the luxury that I have and almost nobody else in the world has is, I don&apos;t have to be right about which fuel wins,\" says Immelt, laughing. \"Cause I&apos;ve got a chip on all of them.\" Whether or not President Trump brings back coal or kills solar, GE will have something to sell. It goes beyond generation. If coal grows, so does the demand for locomotives to haul it (and maybe for medical-imaging devices to diagnose lung damage from pollution).\nAll the presidential candidates promised to modernize infrastructure, which could include the crumbling electricity grid. GE makes equipment for that, and for making the grid more flexible to deal with the daily waxing and waning of power from wind farms. GE also has a service called Current that uses Predix to study energy use in buildings (from offices to factories). Current also sells solar panels, LED lighting, and electric car-charging stations to companies that want to green up.\nWatch A GE Engineer Chat With A Robotic Power Plant GE has developed something like Siri for industrial machines, so engineers can ask a turbine or jet engine what&apos;s wrong and how to fix it. Immelt does speak up for the environment, somewhat. \"In our company, we believe that climate change is real and is caused by man. So we have run our company with that as a context,\" he says, \"but we&apos;ve never picked a winner or loser in terms of fuel. Our approach has been, infuse technology, and let&apos;s make everything more efficient.\"\nImmelt&apos;s belief in science puts him again at odds with Trump, who has taken a detour around a mountain of scientific evidence to claim that global warming is a hoax (and that there&apos;s no drought in California). Trump has also picked climate change conspiracy theorist Myron Ebell of the Competitive Enterprise Institute to lead the transition&apos;s search for a new head of the Environmental Protection Agency.\nImmelt still sees an upshot to coal plants, which are typically 35% energy efficient, he says. \"If you take that from 35% to 40% efficiency, that reduces more carbon than an incredible influx of solar or other renewable energies. So there&apos;s a lot of different ways to skin the cat,\" he says. That comparison is a controversial one, however: according to an analysis by the consultancy Ecofys , long-term investments in more efficient coal-fired plants rather than renewables would still not reduce carbon enough to meet the goals set by the U.N. Paris Agreement, including limiting global temperature rise to below 2°C above pre-industrial levels.\nPopulist Punching Bag GE has been a bull&apos;s-eye for populists on both the left and the right, with accusations of exporting U.S. jobs and booking profits in other countries with low taxation in order to skirt U.S. taxes. A 2011 investigation by the New York Times reported that clever (though legal) accounting allowed GE to pay no U.S. taxes in some years.\n\"A localization strategy can’t be shut down by protectionist politics.\" \"We sell around the world, we pay the taxes we owe,\" Immelt tells me, calmly. But he can be combative on other occasions, like following accusations made in April by then-candidate Bernie Sanders in an interview with the New York Daily News , saying \"What we have seen over the many years is shutting down of many major plants in this country. Sending jobs to low-wage countries,\" said Sanders. \"And General Electric, doing a very good job avoiding the taxes.\"\nImmelt was fast on the defensive in a Washington Post editorial . \"We create wealth and jobs, instead of just calling for them in speeches,\" wrote Immelt, who called the accusations of tax avoidance lies. After rattling off stats of how many people GE employs in the U.S., (including in Sanders&apos;s Vermont) and how much it exports, Immelt concluded by saying, \"It seems Sen. Sanders is missing the point.\"\nWhat critics call job exporting, GE might call contending with a government that doesn&apos;t support its industries internationally, as with fewer trade barriers and better financial support through the U.S. Export-Import Bank. \"GE has 420 factories around the world giving us tremendous flexibility,\" Immelt told the NYU grads. \"We used to have one site to make locomotives; now we have multiple global sites that give us market access. A localization strategy can’t be shut down by protectionist politics.\"\nSanders didn&apos;t make it to the White House, but along with President-elect Trump comes his far-right chief strategist Steve Bannon. He was no kinder to GE—though for different reasons—speaking to a 2014 conference, according to a transcript recently published by BuzzFeed . \"General Electric and these major corporations that are in bed with the federal government are not what we’d consider free-enterprise capitalists…They&apos;re what we call corporatist. They want to have more and more monopolistic power, and they’re doing that kind of convergence with big government,\" said Bannon.\nThe company&apos;s Minds+Machine&apos;s conference in San Francisco on November 15 Jackson Patterson To some extent, GE and the government have been collaborating. Obama did pick Immelt to chair the President’s Council on Jobs and Competitiveness, and Immelt also served on the board of the New York Federal Reserve Bank.\nI ask Immelt if there are ways that a Trump administration can hurt GE, and it&apos;s the one time that he stumbles in his response. \"Again, I&apos;m just not. I&apos;m, I&apos;m, I just think we should, we should give him the chance to kinda pick his team, and get going and see what happens,\" he says.\nWhat&apos;s Great For America Is Great For GE? Yet there are important ways that Trump&apos;s plans to make America great again could be great for GE, too. It starts with GE&apos;s biggest source of bad press—taxes. \"We believe in comprehensive tax reform,\" Immelt tells me. \"And I hope that&apos;s one of the priorities of the new administration, is to get a tax system that is more contemporary with the global footprint that is required today.\"\nImmelt would like a reduction of corporate taxes from about 35% to \"the low 20s,\" he says, along with curtailment of the many deductions that make the effective tax rate much lower, anyway. Trump would go even further, taking the tax rate down to 15%.\nTrump&apos;s Huge Infrastructure Plan Will Test His Management Chops Trump will soon have to prove he&apos;s the manager he says he is. One expert in public-private innovation explains how he can pull it off. \"You would have elements that would simplify the code, promote investment, lower the rate, take away deductions, and then have some kind of territorial system so that companies can move cash around the world, with clearly established rules,\" says Immelt. GE has kept its money abroad, say critics, to avoid paying U.S. taxes, though it&apos;s hardly alone. Moody&apos;s reckons that U.S. companies will have piled up $1.3 trillion overseas by the end of the year. Among the biggest hoarders are tech companies, the sector that supported Hillary Clinton. GE&apos;s foreign cash holdings are about $100 billion, according to research firm Capital Economics. Apple&apos;s are about $200 billion, according to Statista . Trump has called for slashing taxes to 10% on money that companies like GE or any of the tech giants bring back into the U.S.\nImmelt rails against regulations—as does Trump. \"Government has failed to promote growth in almost every corner of the world. In the U.S., regulation has expanded while infrastructure has lagged,\" he said in his commencement address. Trump has also decried the state of U.S. infrastructure and introduced a plan to spur $1 trillion of private investment. Part of the plan is $137 billion in federal tax credits. If any of Trump&apos;s plan works, there could be money in it for GE.\n\"First and foremost I&apos;d say, is that even before President Trump became president we had positioned the company for a time period where trade deals would be very hard to do,\" says Immelt. \"We&apos;re ready for a more protectionist government.\"",

By Biography November 26, 2016 \nBaker Hughes plans to merge with General Electric’s oil-and-gas division in a corporate version of a classic romantic comedy: Two businesses with “issues” are drawn together in the hope they can help solve each other’s problems. \nInvestors would be wise to cheer them on. The logic behind the deal makes sense, and it could nicely set up the new Baker Hughes, as the company still will be known, to profit as energy prices rise. ...",

      "text": " Google+\nGetty Images\nBy Adam Vaccaro Globe Staff November 26, 2016\nGeneral Electric Co. wants its new Boston headquarters to be a showcase of the innovative technologies it plans to bring to industrial machinery. But the campus being planned for the Fort Point neighborhood will also include a paean to GE’s storied past as inventor of some of the great machinery and innovations of the modern age.\nThe complex will include a gallery or museum of sorts on the lower floors of its planned 12-story building that will mix new discoveries with historical displays of iconic past products.\nAdvertisement\n“I don’t even necessarily like the word museum,” said Peter Cavanaugh, a GE executive who is leading the planning. “We think in this experience that we’ll have a measure of past, a measure of present, and a measure of future.”\nFor example, the space will likely include a table with a computer screen on its surface, showing visitors how data is collected, displayed, and analyzed using Internet-connected machinery. GE is betting big on “digital industrial” products that allow machines to communicate with one another. At the same time, the gallery will probably feature homages to the multinational conglomerate’s 124-year history, which traces back to Thomas Edison.\n“Where we use artifacts, it will be artifacts with a story,” Cavanaugh said. “Every generation has its own game-changing products.”\nIts many inventions and innovations range from lighting to locomotives and jet engines, power generators and X-ray tubes, plastics, and consumers appliances from electric fans to refrigerators.\nmiSci, Museum of Innovation & Science\n22museum - General Electric TV monitor. (miSci, Museum of Innovation & Science)\nThe company’s former headquarters in suburban Fairfield, Conn., did not have public displays, but Cavanaugh said GE does have “innovation centers” at other locations around the world that showcase its work.\nAdvertisement\nGE relocated from Fairfield, Conn., in August, setting up shop in temporary headquarters in Fort Point , while it draws out plans for a $200 million campus that includes two renovated brick buildings and the new 12-story structure.\nBecause the property is located along the waterfront, GE is required to provide public access to much of its ground-level space. Other public amenities will include a harborwalk, a cafe, a bistro, and a STEM education center for students. Cavanaugh said the company would probably plan a museum regardless of its public access requirement.\nGE’s museum would hardly be novel. Coca-Cola, Harley-Davidson, Intel, and Wells Fargo have them. And in Boston, New Balance has a “visitor engagement center” featuring its history at its headquarters, while Massachusetts General Hospital features a medical museum.\nGensler Architecture\nRendering of new headquarters General Electric plans to build along Fort Point Channel.\nKeri Koehler, a former archivist for Wells Fargo said corporate museums differ from many traditional museums because “everything is about the brand.”\n“It fulfills a marketing or branding initiative,” she said. “But I also think there are corporations that have been around for a long time and they’re proud of their heritage.”\nKoehler said “real museum” professionals sometimes disparage the corporate exhibits as marketing tools. But she defended the corporate versions, arguing that preserving major companies’ pasts helps tell the story of “the making of America.”\nCavanaugh said GE “wouldn’t shy away from” less glamorous moments in corporate history, though those elements would likely be couched to tell a broader story.\n‘I don’t even necessarily like the word museum. We think in this experience that we’ll have a measure of past, a measure of present, and a measure of future.’\nFor example, the museum could include failed products as an example of how innovation does not guarantee market success. He also said it would be “in-bounds” to reference the company’s own history of corporate pollution as part of a broader message about GE’s environmental goals and green technology. He stressed that the company is not yet sure what the museum will specifically feature.\nMore photos:\nPhyllis O'Leary\nA GE clock offered in the 1930s as a promotion for its GE “Monitor Top” electric refrigerator.\nmiSci, Museum of Innovation & Science\nGeneral Electric radio clock.\nmiSci, Museum of Innovation & Science\nGeneral Electric 1973 Microwave range combo.\nmiSci, Museum of Innovation & Science\nGeneral Electric 1973 air conditioner.\nmiSci, Museum of Innovation & Science\nA 1960s General Electric Yellow Kitchen in House frame.\nAdam Vaccaro can be reached at adam.vaccaro@globe.com .

Share (0) linkedin Transcript [MUSIC] It's always helpful to have an extra set of hands in the kitchen, especially around Thanksgiving. So GE Appliances has created a new Skill in partnership with Amazon Alexa to help make cooking a little bit easier and hands free. GE's line of wi-fi connected appliances now connect with Amazon Alexa, which is Amazon's virtual assistant. Here's how it works. GE created a skill called Geneva so you can ask your amazon Alexa THe connected device such as an Echo or and Echo Dot to ask Geneva to do something with your oven or refrigerator. In this case we tested it with an induction range with our Amazon Echo Dot. Does it sound a little bit confusing? Let me show you how it works. Alexa. Ask Geneva what the status of my oven is. Your oven is currently off and is ready to be controlled. And it's also handy around Thanksgiving. Alexa? Ask Geneva to preheat my oven for turkey. You'd like me to set your oven convection roast at 325 degrees farenheit for turkey, right? Yes. Alright. I recommend adjusting your oven racks So that the turkey will be centered in the oven. If you have an oven food probe, this is a great time to use it. As you can see, the GE induction range works really well with Amazon Alexa. You just have to be very particular about Which phrases you use, because she can be a little bit tricky when it comes to picking up on exactly what you want Geneva and Alexa to do together And WiFi connectivity aside, this is actually a really great oven. Because of its fast-induction cooktop, it can boil a huge pot of water in less than six minutes, and its bake times and easiness in baking biscuits during our test was also really great. This oven is $2,000, which is a little on the high-end, especially for free-standing range But that gets you induction power, even baking, and some WiFi connectivity that will really help connect your kitchen to the greater smart home.",

      "text": "Dilon and GE receive FDA approval for Discovery NM750b breast imaging system   \nDILON Diagnostics and GE Healthcare are pleased to announce the FDA clearance of the Molecular Breast Imaging (MBI) localization accessory for breast biopsy. The Discovery NM750b and the breast biopsy accessory will be presented at the RSNA conference in Chicago, from November 27 to December 1. The Discovery NM750b will be at the Dilon booth number 6132. This important milestone in the breast imaging segment comes shortly after Dilon and GE signed an exclusive agreement for DILON to distribute GE's Discovery NM750b Molecular Breast Imaging system in North America. Related Stories Improving innovation uptake in the NHS \nThe Discovery NM 750b breast imaging system, designed to measure and image the distribution of selected single photon emission radioisotopes in the human body to aid in the evaluation of lesions, offers clinicians an important tool for imaging of a broad range of patients, including those with dense breast. The MBI localization accessory is a complementary technology to the Discovery NM750b breast imaging system which is designed to accurately locate, in three dimensions, lesions in the breast using information derived from stereotactic pairs of two-dimensional images. It is intended to provide guidance for interventional purposes such as biopsy and pre-surgical. \nThe power of functional imaging to see and localize early changes is a key factor in early detection of breast cancer.

Opt for in-store pickup to avoid the $5.97 shipping charge. That's $2 under our August mention, $11 off, and the lowest price we've seen for a 2-pack of these bulbs. (It's also $9 under what you'd pay for a similar 2-pack in other local stores.) Each bulb features an output of 800 lumens and purported 9-year life.",

      "title": "The cloud hit escape velocity in 2016, powering an SaaS buy-up",
      "text": "GUEST: \nGE’s recent acquisition of ServiceMax , a cloud-based field service solutions provider, marked the first billion-dollar SaaS (software as a service) acquisition by a company outside the traditional software business. The move not only underscores the growing importance of SaaS and digital to companies beyond the technology space, it’s also evidence of the tremendous importance of the cloud. As we close out 2016 and move into a new year, I predict we’ll see many more billion dollar acquisitions of SaaS companies by both non-traditional and traditional tech organizations.\nWe’ve seen ample proof lately that the future growth of IT spend will be in the cloud and that the battle for owning a piece of that cloud opportunity has become a top priority. Amazon Cloud services this past quarter generated more profit than its entire ecommerce business, highlighting both the scale and the fact that future leaders in the cloud may come from non-intuitive places. Google is making a huge bet on the future of the cloud business and has brought on VMware founder Diane Greene to lead that charge. And Microsoft’s results speak to the growing importance of the cloud strategy for even the largest traditional tech players.\nThe cloud has driven unprecedented SaaS buy-ups Enterprise software organizations, private equity firms, and even other SaaS companies all want to be part of the $1 trillion cloud market opportunity and latch onto the SaaS growth estimated to more than triple over the next five years. Over this past summer, we saw companies of all types set precedents and break records by making SaaS acquisitions. Microsoft made the largest acquisition in its 30+ year history when it purchased LinkedIn in June for $26 billion. Salesforce has made a record number of SaaS acquisitions in the last 12 months, including its $2.4 billion purchase of Demandware in July, which marked the largest acquisition it had ever made. Vista Equity Partners has been aggressively bidding for SaaS businesses all year (including its purchase of Marketo for $1.79 billion in May), doing so at high revenue multiples, not traditional EBITDA multiples. And despite conflicts with Larry Ellison’s majority control of the company, Oracle decided it wanted to own NetSuite, buying it for approximately $9.3 billion in July.\nIt’s clear that the SaaS merger and acquisition (M&A) craze is more than a passing fad and that the cloud is helping to drive that trend. In fact, I believe 2016 and 2017 will go down in history as the years the cloud hit escape velocity.\nThe timing’s right The recent increase in SaaS acquisitions has been driven by a variety of factors. First and foremost, of course, is the huge opportunity in the cloud. Success in the cloud is driving most tech and non-tech buyers to pursue a cloud strategy or be left behind. The combination of several years of a soft IPO market and billions of dollars of extra cash on the balance sheets of corporate buyers also makes it an extremely compelling environment for M&A to happen.\nOver the next several years, we’ll continue to see cloud growth drive SaaS acquisitions in traditional and non-traditional technology spaces. The trend will not only be influenced by some of those factors we’ve discussed already but also by the growing recognition that it’s no longer enough to simply have technology as an internal competitive edge. In today’s market it is incumbent on all types of organizations to deploy technology for customer-facing competitive advantage.\nIndustrial and digital converge GE is an excellent illustration of the ways non-traditional technology companies are moving to the cloud and SaaS. GE had always been known as a product company, but in September of 2015 it launched GE Digital, making a bid to become “the world’s premier digital industrial company” (see Owen ).\nOnce it focused on becoming a digital company, GE knew that enabling the digitization of service operations for the largest industrial companies in the world was a massive opportunity. ServiceMax, a longtime partner, worked closely with GE and its GE Digital division to help map out a vision for its digital field services. Over time, GE deployed ServiceMax’s SaaS solution in over nine of its divisions to manage complex field service operations, scheduling, and people and parts, all using mobile (smart phones and iPads) to deliver enterprise cloud solutions to its global remote workforce.\nA little more than a year after participating in an $82 million funding round for ServiceMax — and with an eye toward advancing its digital services capabilities — GE decided to acquire the company .\nThe future of SaaS opportunities As we see the SaaS acquisition craze continue to grow over the next few years, the battles for dominance will be fought at several levels:\nPlatform level where Amazon, Google and Microsoft are going head to head – not for startups Horizontal SaaS applications (functional applications like Salesforce (CRM), SuccessFactors (HR), Workday (HR & Financials) – getting harder to find the whitespaces Vertical Market SaaS – Veeva (LifeSciences), OPower (Utility), Guidewire (Insurance) – lots of opportunities here, though market size can be an issue Next generation platforms – AR/VR, Drones, Location and AI/Machine Learning are the most interesting new platforms enabling new SaaS opportunities – still emerging, but the greatest upside As those battles gain fever pitch, we will look back on 2016 as the watershed year when the cloud hit escape velocity and became the acknowledged core strategy for the technology winners of the future. The recent frenzy of SaaS acquisitions is further evidence of the imperative to become relevant in the Cloud.\nJason Green is General Partner, Emergence Capital Partners .

I am flying NRT to DFW to PHX to LAX soon. I am expecting the gate check SSSS rubbish in NRT and was wondering if there's a way to make sure I get precheck for DFW to PDX as I know it will not be on the boarding pass but will pop up for the PHX segment. Do I call to have it refresh once I hit customs? Thanks. I get SSSSd 100% of the time for every flight that goes into the USA no matter what country or airline I fly from so I'm making a note to get to the gate super early to get through whatever screening they decide to do.
