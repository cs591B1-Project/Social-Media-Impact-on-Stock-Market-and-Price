PHOTO: MCDONALD'S/ INSTAGRAM Published Derek Wong \nSINGAPORE - While 38,808 pupils received their Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) results on Thursday (Nov 24), it seemed like the entire country was getting the results together with the children, as Singapore celebrated its best PSLE performance ever. \nAbout 98.4 per cent of pupils who took this year's PSLE are able to go on to a secondary school. \nProminent personalities, organisations and brands in Singapore have offered their well-wishes and encouragement to the young ones. \nPrime Minister Lee Hsien Loong posted his congratulations to the pupils with a message of encouragement. \n\"I hope you will take the next few years in secondary school to discover and nurture your talents and interests, and develop a passion for lifelong learning. It will serve you well as you journey through life's stages,\" he said. \nOther politicians also offered their well-wishes and advice. \nMinister for Social and Family Development Tan Chuan-Jin had a message for parents. He encouraged them to \"Please Support, Love and Encourage them always\" as one day \"we (parents) will need their support, love and encouragement too\". \nSenior Minister of State Josephine Teo posted a picture of Star Wars character Darth Vader giving the thumbs-up, telling pupils that \"there's no need to be stressed, as long as you've done your best!\" \nNominated MP Kuik Shiao-yin published a heartfelt note \"You Are More Than One Result\" on her Facebook. She had a clear message to the pupils: \"You are and always will be so much more than one result.\" \nCorporations and movements also sent out messages for the pupils. \nThe Singapore Kindness Movement posted a note from a St Anthony's Canossian Primary School teacher, Ms Teoh, to her Primary 6 class, with the words \"Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.\" \nMeanwhile, fast food chain McDonald's put up a picture of beverages resembling parents and a child, with the message \"No matter what, keep sharing the love!\"",

      "text": "Police are appealing after a student was viciously attacked in a McDonald’s branch in Salford after a man discovered she was from London.\nMegan Westlotorn, 18, was with friends in the McDonald’s near Salford Crescent when she was knocked unconscious.\nMegan Westlotorn (left) before she was attacked Credit: MEN Syndication Police are now investigating the unprovoked attack on the sports science student on Sunday morning. Megan, who is in her first year at university, was waiting at the tills to collect her order, when a man started speaking to her.\nShe says it was only when he asked her where she was from that his demeanor suddenly changed - and he lashed out.\nThe sports science student, who has shared pictures of her blood-stained clothes after the incident, said: “I noticed him talking to people when I went up to get my chicken nuggets.\n“As soon as he asked where I was from and I said I was from London, he just switched.\n“He started swearing at me and giving me abuse. He called me a f g Southerner, saying I was f g tramps and that he hated Londoners.\nI stepped back and told him I was backing off from the situation.”\nWhen Megan walked away she thought her ordeal was over.\nBut when she went over towards disabled toilet, the man went over to her and punched in her in the face.\n“The next thing I knew, I was on the floor in a pool of blood,”\n“He must have knocked me unconscious for a minute or so. There was blood pouring from my nose.\n“I was just really shocked. I didn’t know what had happened. I didn’t expect to get punched in the face like that.\n“When I found my friend she couldn’t believe what had happened either. It all happened so quickly.”\n– Megan Westlotorn The McDonald's branch near Salford Crescent Credit: Google Maps Megan, who has only just moved away from her home in South East London to start her degree, is urging other students to be aware of her attacker. “I just want other people to be vigilant and watch out for him,” she added.\nMegan described her attacker as white, around 5ft 4ins, with a Salford accent.\nGreater Manchester Police confirmed they are investigating the incident.\nLast updated Fri 25 Nov 2016 Salford",

Super-eater (yep… there’s a such thing ) and YouTube sensation Yuka Kinoshita laid all of our overeating guilt trips to rest with her latest video. So, good ahead and grab those seconds, thirds and fourths without shame, guys! The tiny woman elegantly scarfed down her weight’s worth of Japanese Micky D’s treats, including: five Big Macs, ten dark chocolate pies, ten white chocolate pies, three tiramisu McFlurries, three large fries and three large cokes! And, spoiler alert, she totally lived to tell the tale. Watch Yuka devour he McDonald’s treats in the viral video, below! Mind. Blown. We have to admit, our stomachs totally hurt after watching Yuka in action. The real question is…how in the hell did she make room for everything?! On the other hand, Japanese McDonald’s food looks a lot…well, lighter than that of the American menu. We can almost bet that we wouldn’t have to eat half of what she sate to meet the 10,000 calorie quota. But hey, we’ll take any guilt-free reassurance we can get when it comes to stuffing our faces this season. Dig those stretchy jeans up out the back of your closets, because you’ll definitely need them!",

      "text": "It will soon be easier to order a Big Mac than ever. McDonald’s will introduce mobile ordering in 10 major markets starting next year. The move is the latest step by the burger giant to embrace technology throughout its stores in the United States.\nMobile ordering is a practice many businesses are starting to implement in their stores to boost sales. Starbucks introduced its version of it last year through its popular mobile app, allowing customers to order their favorite drinks before arriving at the store, making the experience of picking up coffee much quicker. Dunkin’ Donuts followed suit.\nThere’s no word yet on how McDonald’s will implement its version of mobile ordering, however.\nMcDonald’s already began to update stores around the country, adding virtual menus and self-serving kiosks. It has gone through some tough times lately with the rise of awareness in healthy eating that juxtaposed terribly with its reputation of unhealthy fast-food. As the company tries to become a “modern, progressive company,” as one of its executive noted on Thursday, this is just the latest step to attract customers.\nBusinesses aim to adapt with technology We’ve begun to assume that we can order anything from our phones and receive it at our doorsteps, without ever leaving home, thanks to products like Amazon Prime Now. As a result, companies like McDonald’s are also beginning to adopt this type of customer service. It’s a good idea, no doubt, but we’re not quite sure how it fits into McDonald’s vision of creating a healthier customer base.\n\n\nSource : Reuters ",

      "text": "November 25, 2016 \nby: J. D. Heyes \n( NaturalNews ) Do you think it’s really possible to actually lose weight eating nothing but a steady diet of pre-processed McDonald’s fast food ? Well, the restaurant chain would sure like for you to believe that, even though most items on McDonald’s menus have been proven to be stuffed with unhealthy ingredients. \nNevertheless, the chain wants to convince people that its food offerings contain the daily recommended allowances of carbohydrates, sugar, protein and fat – and as such, it is completely healthy to eat whatever is on the menu, because none of it causes obesity or the many ailments associated with it, as has been claimed. \nDo you remember when John Cisna, an Iowa high school teacher, claimed to have lost 56 pounds eating nothing but food from McDonald’s in 2013? He even wrote a book about it, called My McDonald’s Diet . Mindless nutritional propaganda \nCisna claims that he limited his daily intake to 2,000 calories and exercised for 45 minutes, five times per week. After that he said he lost a total of 21 inches off his chest, waist and hips; his total cholesterol fell from 249 to 190; his body mass index (BMI) fell from 38 to 30; and he dropped to 224 pounds from 280 pounds, Anon HQ reports . \nIn a documentary that McDonald’s is peddling to high schools everywhere as a tool for healthy eating, Cisna says, “I ate 540 straight meals at McDonald’s. I spent a half a year of my life eating nothing but McDonald’s and I know it works so when I hear the skeptics, it doesn’t disgruntle me. It actually fires me up because those are the people that I have to educate.” \nEver since, as a paid brand ambassador for the fast food chain, he has crisscrossed the U.S., promoting McDonald’s fare to middle- and high school students. He has even talked to students studying dietetics. \nIn his own documentary, Cisna attempts to discredit the hit film , Supersize Me , which laid bare the kind of damage to your health that only eating fast food – especially in large portions – can do. \nBut in the end, most legitimate dietitians and health experts were not impressed with his “findings.” In fact, most of them pointed to some very obvious factors that led to his weight loss – and it wasn’t typical McDonald’s food that did it. \nIn an interview with Today , registered dietitian nutritionist Elisa Zied of New York City, author of the book, Younger Next Week , lauded Cisna’s success at losing weight, but said that his recommendation of a strictly McDonald’s-only diet was not realistic. ‘I wouldn’t recommend this to anyone’ \nThat’s because much of his weight-loss results came from cutting his daily caloric intake and by exercising. Plus, she said, it is very likely that while he lost weight and cut his cholesterol level, his diet was probably high in sodium, low in fiber and consisted of far fewer vitamins and minerals found in healthier diets that include fruits, vegetables , whole grains and other foods rich in nutrients. \n“I personally would not recommend this to anyone,” she said . “Fast food can be part of a healthful, balanced and nutrient-rich diet but it…shouldn’t be a large part.” \nActually, it should play no part in your diet. \nZied advises people to prepare most of their own food fresh at home while eating out less. \nAs an update, The Washington Post reported that McDonald’s has quietly ended it’s controversial program involving sending Cisna to schools to talk about its food and nutrition in the same breath. \nCritics lambasted the effort as an underhanded way for the fast food chain to legitimize fast food as a nutrition alternative to kids who would grow up thinking that burgers, fries and shakes are actually good for you. \nSources:",

      "text": "› McDonald's will introduce mobile payment and ordering in the US in the first half of 2017 McDonald's will introduce mobile payment and ordering in the US in the first half of 2017 Posted: Tags : Apps - Apps + Our phones are incredibly powerful tools that can be used for a whole plethora of things. They can track our steps, access the entire Internet, allow us to immediately connect with friends and family, capture photos and videos, and so much more. However, something they currently can't do is order Big Macs. McDonald's is one of the most popular fast-food chains in the world, but despite their popularity, the company has been a bit lacking when it comes to their adoption of new technology. Companies such as Starbucks allow customers to place orders for food and drinks directly through the official Starbucks app, and it looks like McDonald's will be introducing similar functionality within their own app next year. Starting sometime in the first half of 2017, McDonald's will introduce the ability to order items off of their menu through the McDonald's app on your smartphone, followed by a full-fledged national rollout in the second half of the year. The app will allow you to both order and pay for your items within the app, and although this isn't anything we haven't seen before from McDonald's' competitors, it's nice to see that the company is finally taking the right steps forward to being more mobile-friendly. One of the biggest draws for fast-food chains, such as McDonald's, is the ability to get a drink or bite to eat as quickly as possible. This factor can be easily diminished by a long line in-store or a backed-up drive-thru, and the addition of mobile ordering and paying should help to drastically decrease the amount of time it takes for you to get your food upon visiting McDonald's. McDonald's has to to announce exact details on how their rollout of mobile ordering will take place next year, but we should get specifics as we draw closer to the second half of 2017.  ",

George and Shay Hirsch: The love story George Hirsch, founder of New York City Marathon, met his future wife before, of course, a marathon. She was running; he wasn't.

But the question remained: Which one is better? \nWatch: Canadiens forwards engage in battle of burgers \nCustomers at a Montreal McDonald's were asked to pick between the two burgers and had a little surprise waiting for them. After they made their choice, one of the two players would gave them an earful via video screen. \n\"You just made one of the biggest mistakes of your life,\" Galchenyuk said after a patron picked Gallagher's burger. \n\"You made him really sad, which makes me really happy,\" Gallagher said to another customer who chose his creation. \nGalchenyuk's brief foray into French is also a pretty funny moment in the ad. \nSo who did the restaurant-goers prefer as their chef? There was some debate about that too. Galchenyuk said that the score was 5-5, but Gallagher said it was 5-4, his lead. ",

      "text": "Thumbs up to McDonald's grad Saturday Nov 26, 2016 at 2:01 AM \nThumbs up to Josh Dunne, a 19-year-old in Kittery, Maine, who deserves enormous credit for taking full advantage of the McDonald's restaurant chain's program to earn a high school diploma. \nWe reported on Dunne's heartwarming story earlier this week. Dunne had dropped out of Traip Academy as a junior after problems at home and struggles with academics. His parents weren't getting along, and his mother, by her own admission, was drinking way too much. “He was watching his mom self-destruct,” Linda Dunne said this week. \nJosh Dunne, who worked for three years without a car, often walking 30 minutes, has earned his diploma ahead of schedule while working 50 hours a week. He also bought a car recently and earned promotions at work, recently becoming assistant manager. His mom couldn't be more proud and said she's been sober for a year. \nCredit goes to Dunne, of course, but also to McDonald's Archways to Opportunity program, which offers free education to its employees through the accredited Career Online High School. Dunne was nurtured and encouraged by the Kittery McDonald's leaders, including co-owners Peter Napoli and Sal Napoli, and store manager Alex Landry. \nDunne's story was a big hit on Seacoastonline.com, and he got many congratulations on the Seacoastonline Facebook page. Dunne joined the conversation, too, posting a comment on our Facebook page that shows he's aware his accomplishment is bigger than himself. \n\"Thank you everybody for your support, encouragement, and congratulations,\" Dunne wrote. \"I appreciate it and it means everything to me. To some McDonald's might just seem like a part time, dead end job, but I want to tell everyone personally that there are so many opportunities to take advantage of. There's so much to learn not just from the company itself, but also the employees, and especially the guests. If you didn't obtain your diploma or know somebody that didn't, then I encourage you with all my heart to join McDonald's, rise through the ranks, seize the opportunities, and earn your diploma. Please share this article so more people can become educated about the great opportunities that are available to them.\" \n**** \nThumbs up to everyone who donated their time on Thanksgiving day. This includes those involved with hosting the Portsmouth Rotary Club's 45th annual community dinner at the St. Nicholas Greek Church. \nNumerous Rotarians and volunteers helped deliver, prepare and serve food. They cooked 26 turkeys and baked 60 pies. Donations of food came from Portsmouth Regional Hospital, baked goods were provided by Me & Ollies and flowers for the tables were donated by Flower Kiosk. This dinner is appreciated by many who attend. \n**** \nThumbs up to 7-year-old second-grader Georgia Merrill and her parents for starting the Georgia Peach Project to raise money to help feed people in need. \nMore than $1,000 has been raised so far for the New Hampshire Food Bank. The effort started when Georgia saw a man on the street holding a sign saying \"I'm hungry.\" \nGeorgia told her mom, Erin, about it, and they worked together to set up a website, share it on Facebook and recruit donations. Her mom said she's always looking for volunteer opportunities for her kids, and that's great to see. Parents teaching their kids the value of giving back at a young age is great for our communities. \nDonations can be made to Georgia's cause at http://bit.ly/2fPgL0p. About Us",

Christmas tree, over consuming on food and materials and alcohol for Christmas. Not a very good thing to support mc Donald’s and your cutting down a LIVE tree to place in homes that end up just dieing and being trashed! I urge people this year to not buy the trees who are we to cut down trees so we can look at them inside for our selfish enjoyment ? Also look into the history of Christmas it’s not the prettiest one, aka saturnalia. I believe in Maryland when people first started celebrating Christmas they were locked up.",

      "text": "TungCheung / Shutterstock.com \nMobile ordering and payments are coming to McDonalds in 2017, meaning your interactions with pimple-faced teens will be dramatically reduced in the new year. Some McDonald’s restaurants have already begun installing self-serve kiosks and “smart” menu boards in the U.S., but table service and custom sandwiches are also on their way, Reuters reports.\nAround 500 McDonald’s restaurants across the country have already got self-service kiosks, with other key markets making the changes in early 2017. Mobile ordering and payments will kick off in early 2017 as a pilot project and become the status quo in the second half of the year.\nSee also: Going to McDonalds right now might actually improve your fitness August 18, 2016 The changes come as McDonald’s tries to play catch-up with other fast food chains like Dominos and Starbucks who were early adopters of a mobile-first attitude. The company has already made sweeping changes to its ingredients to focus on a healthier contemporary image, including abandoning chickens raised with antibiotics and replacing margarine with butter and sugar with high-fructose corn syrup.\nMcDonald’s counter staff will reportedly not lose their jobs to ‘robots’ but will instead be redeployed to assist folks who have no idea how to operate the kiosks. Counter staff will also become servers to facilitate McDonald’s new focus on table service.\nIronically, McDonald’s USA chief executive, Steve Easterbrook, told Reuters “there is nothing more powerful than one-on-one customer experience” when explaining the addition of mobile ordering and payments to the McDonald’s app.\nAre you happy to see McDonald’s modernizing? Or do you prefer real human interaction?",

      "text": "McDonald’s strikes deal with WestJet airline to serve coffee at 35,000 feet By Jessica Goodfellow - 26 November 2016 11:56am McDonald's coffee \nMcDonald’s has beaten Starbucks and Canadian coffee brand Tim Hortons to a deal with WestJet airlines that will see the fast food company’s coffee served to customers at 35,000 feet for the first time. \nThe deal with Canadian airline WestJet will mean McCafé’s Premium Roast will be offered as complimentary beverages on-board, first introduced last week on its Toronto to Calgary route. The roll-out to the rest of the airline will start on 1 December, when all passengers will be offered a McCafé as one of their complimentary drinks. \nThe coffee has been specially brewed to adjust to higher altitudes which dull the senses, using a darker roast of beans used as well as a slightly hotter water temperature. Coffees which require steamed milk like cappuccino and lattes will not be available. \nJohn Betts, president of McDonald’s Canada, said: “We’ve always believed that the sky is the limit for McCafé - and today this officially rings true.” \nTake your day from good to great with #McCafeonWestJet . Available across our entire Boeing jet fleet as of Dec 1, 2016 pic.twitter.com/jPQyq4zkeL \n— WestJet (@WestJet) November 24, 2016 \nWestJet’s chief executive Gregg Saretsky told the Toronto Star that the airline serves 30,000 cups of coffee a day. It is not yet known if McDonald’s food will be served on the airline in the future, but Saretsky did not rule it out in an interview with the Star: “Possibly. We really want to make sure we get the coffee right first.” \nMcDonald’s has been pumping much of its marketing budget into propelling its coffee brand, diversifying beyond fast food. McCafé was the number four coffee brand in the UK when it signed Channel 4 last year to create real-time ads in between hit shows Gogglebox and The Island with Bear Grylls. \nThe ads, ‘McCafé moments’ took cues from Gogglebox by putting regular people in a cafe set to discuss what just happened in the show. As a result of the ads, McCafé leapt to become the number two coffee brand in the UK, with 10 million cups of coffee sold during the campaign.",

      "text": "Hollis Johnson \nThe fast-food world exploded earlier this year at the revelation that McDonald's is testing a Chicken McGriddle sandwich.\nEven better news: McDonald's has since  expanded  the test, rolling it out to several other regions across Ohio, which suggests that the sandwich has been a big hit in the state so far.  \nThe new item combines a fried chicken patty and the sweet pancake buns of the McGriddle breakfast sandwich.\nOnly time — and Ohioans — will tell if the sandwich has national staying power. But we couldn't wait to try it for ourselves, so we decided to construct our own Chicken McGriddle.\nSo how to go about constructing your own Chicken McGriddle? It's pretty simple. First, buy a simple Sausage McGriddle and a Crispy Buttermilk Chicken sandwich. Hollis Johnson \n\nThe humble Sausage McGriddle works best, as there's no egg or cheese to mess with. Hollis Johnson \n\nAfter all, it's the buns we're after here. The McGriddle buns are specially formulated with maple-syrup crystals to give a sweet, syrupy flavor without the sticky mess. Hollis Johnson \n\nSee the rest of the story at Business Insider ",

      "title": "New book, movie about San Diego&apos;s Joan and Ray Kroc",
      "text": "Ray and Joan Kroc are San Diego giants — he turned McDonald’s into a fast-food fortune, she gave it away to charity — and in the years since their deaths, they’ve become the stuff of admiring legend and lore.\nA new biography returns them to the realm of the earthbound, much more complicated and conflicted than their saintly public personas.\nWritten by veteran newspaper and radio journalist Lisa Napoli, “Ray & Joan” is also an interesting look at the vagaries of chance, how the seemingly random crossing of paths can send someone’s life in another direction. There’s a reason Joan Kroc named both her airplane and her yacht “Impromptu.”\n“They were larger-than-life characters,” Napoli said. “People either loved them, or they didn’t. There was a certain imperiousness about them. But Joan also sounds like someone who was so much fun. And so was Ray.”\nNapoli spent five years researching and writing the book, working without cooperation from McDonald’s and its historical archives, and receiving what she described as limited and “reluctant” assistance from Kroc relatives. She relied on newspaper archives, court records and dozens of interviews, some of them with people identified only as “confidante” in the footnotes.\nThe book that emerged is several stories rolled into one. There’s the origin story of McDonald’s, the hamburger empire that Ray Kroc built using someone else’s idea. There’s his love story with Joan Kroc, a romance started after an unplanned meeting in an elegant Minnesota supper club, when both were married to others. And there’s the final fairy tale, the millions and millions and millions of dollars dropped into the unsuspecting laps of various organizations after Joan Kroc died and included them in her will.\nSome of the book is set in San Diego, where the Krocs moved after he bought the Padres in 1974, when it looked as if the major league baseball team would be moved to Washington, D.C. That rescue endeared him forever to many San Diegans, and following his death a decade later — nine months before the team made its first appearance in the World Series — his wife left her own mark with a string of charitable donations that earned her the nickname “St. Joan of the Arches.”\nToday the Kroc name adorns a number of buildings in town: a Salvation Army recreation center in Rolando, a peace institute at the University of San Diego, an animal shelter in Mission Valley, a residential center for the homeless in East Village.\n“Joan was sharp, interested, involved, and very humble,” said Joyce Neu, founding director of the Joan B. Kroc Institute for Peace and Justice at USD. “Anyone who knew her felt very lucky.”\nThe book came out Nov. 15, almost exactly one month before a new movie, “The Founder,” opens in limited, Oscar-qualifying release before a wider distribution in January. It stars Michael Keaton as Ray and Linda Cardellini as Joan, and focuses on the early years of McDonald’s. A trailer for the movie has a brief shot of them sitting together at a piano, smiling.\nThey were having a moment. Then, and now.\nWhat ifs The Brooklyn-born Napoli worked for The New York Times before moving to Southern California in 2004 and taking a job with the public radio show “Marketplace.” She said she’s long been drawn to “what if” moments in her reporting, and the Kroc story has plenty of them.\nLisa Napoli Preston Wiles Lisa Napoli Lisa Napoli (Preston Wiles) What if Ray Kroc hadn’t been a paper-cup salesman, which led him to a milkshake maker, which led him to a roadside hamburger stand in San Bernardino called McDonald’s?\nWhat if he hadn’t walked into a candlelit St. Paul, Minn., supper club for a meeting with a potential McDonald’s franchisee and been smitten by the organ player — Joan — who was 26 years his junior?\nWhat if Joan hadn’t decided she’d reject the traditional charity-giving route of using a foundation to distribute money, and instead gave it away based on her own eclectic, emotional connection to various issues (alcoholism, nuclear proliferation, animal welfare, public radio, the Salvation Army, hospice)?\n“Fate, chance — whatever you want to call it, it’s a powerful force,” Napoli said.\nIt played a role in her doing the book, too.\nAlmost five years ago, Napoli was exploring a story about a 26-foot-tall sculpture in Santa Monica of a mushroom cloud constructed out of twisted chains. Conceived by the late political cartoonist Paul Conrad, who saw it as a peace statement, the sculpture had fallen into disrepair. Its fate was uncertain.\nVisiting the site, Napoli met a peace activist who whispered in her ear that the cost of the artwork had been underwritten anonymously two decades earlier by Joan Kroc. Napoli knew Kroc lived in San Diego and had given a bunch of money to National Public Radio when she died, but she wanted to know more. She went looking for a biography about the philanthropist.\n“There wasn’t one,” Napoli writes in the acknowledgments of her book, “so I appointed myself the woman for the job.”\nShe appointed herself even though she’d never written a biography before, and even though the scope of the project soon changed. Napoli thought she was going to do a book about Joan Kroc. “But I realized I couldn’t tell the story of Joan without the story of Ray,” she said.\nThe story of Ray she wrote includes details about his relentless ambition and his fondness for Early Times whiskey. About how even as he understood that post-war America would embrace fast food, he clashed with his partners about the best approach. About how he felt so close to Joan after they married that he named his boat JoniRay, no space, but his temper was so volatile she briefly filed for divorce.\nNapoli said as she dug into the history of Kroc and McDonald’s, the company “was not helpful at all.” (The firm did not respond to a Union-Tribune request for comment.) She also had difficulties when it came to Joan Kroc, who didn’t keep copies of her correspondence and other papers.\nThat may be because Kroc never wanted a book written about her, something that gave the author pause. “I struggled with that a lot,” Napoli said.\nCarving her own path People who only know of Joan Kroc from her San Diego years sometimes think she was always wealthy and glamorous. They don’t know about the struggles Napoli covers in her book. How Joan Kroc and her first husband used a $50 prize their 5-year-old daughter won in a talent contest to pay the rent. How when they first arrived in Rapid City, S.D., to open a McDonald’s, Joan had to her name exactly $1.65. Her husband did well with the restaurant, but she took to calling their hometown “Wretched City.”\nShe and Ray Kroc divorced their spouses and got married in 1969, and she settled uneasily into a life of luxury — private airplanes, 42-carat diamond necklaces, Renoirs and Rockwells — where making a living or finding a purpose wasn’t required. “Joan didn’t want an occupation or a project foisted on her by Ray or anyone in his circle,” Napoli wrote. “She was searching to carve her own path.”\nThat would come through philanthropy. For Napoli, the episode that speaks most directly to Kroc’s generosity happened in 1984, when a gunman opened fire at the McDonald’s in San Ysidro, killing 21 people and injuring 19 others before he was fatally shot by a police sniper. Kroc donated $100,000 to a fund for the victims’ families, and insisted the gunman’s widow and two children be among the recipients.\n“At that terrible time, she wasn’t thinking about McDonald’s,” Napoli said. “ She was thinking about the victims.”\nOver and over, Kroc was moved to action by something she read in the newspapers or saw on television. She gave money to USD and Notre Dame, both Catholic colleges, even though she wasn’t Catholic. Many of the causes were things that her late husband, who was politically conservative, wouldn’t have supported. She often insisted on anonymity when she made a donation.\n“She was a very down-to-Earth person, totally unpretentious and at ease with people,” Neu, the former USD administrator said. She remembered meeting Kroc for the first time at breakfast. Neu’s meal came with hash browns. Kroc leaned over with her fork and asked, “Are you going to eat those, dear?”\nIn the summer of 2003, Joan Kroc celebrated her 75th birthday with a party at her Fairbanks Ranch estate. She was dying from brain cancer and she knew it. She invited officials from organizations that had received major donations from her in the past and would again after she died.\n“We are going to do great things together,” she told them.\nBut some of them didn’t know what exactly was coming. The head of NPR would have been happy with $25,000. NPR got $225 million. The Salvation Army received $1.5 billion.\n“The idea that you could make that kind of surprise for someone must have been such a thrill for her,” Napoli said. “She was giving them not just gifts, but gifts that would be transformational. How amazing is that?”\nLisa Napoli will be at the La Jolla Riford Library on Dec. 3 at 2 p.m. to discuss and sign “Ray & Joan.” Details: warwicks.com or (858) 454-0347.",

I’ve never even had a real tree before so I’m kinda excited,” said Edwards, who minutes later went back and got another tree for another relative. “I’ve always had the artificial trees. Actually my cousin had come up here and said that they were giving out trees and to pass the word along.”\nAnd the word spread fast as 500 trees were given away to families starting at 1 p.m. on a first-come, first-served basis. One tree was provided to each person who showed up, and in some cases, people came jammed in cars as volunteers helped to secure multiple trees on tops of vehicles.\nOrganizers said that prior to the public giveaway, another 500 trees were given in the morning to families in need and preselected by Detroit-area churches. Meijer provided 500 tree stands to those families, as well as $20 Meijer and $5 McDonald’s gift cards.\nSome people waited in line to have trees strapped on to their cars or loaded into trucks; others simply walked up and carried the trees ranging from 5 to 7 feet tall to their vehicles.\nSavarior Moss-Service, owner of the McDonald’s near Eight Mile and Woodward, said the Christmas tree giveaway was another way to give back to the community, as were the 1,200 turkeys given away on Tuesday for Thanksgiving.\n“We decided that it would be good to take it one step further, so we came up with the idea with our public relations company and said, how about Christmas trees,” Moss-Service said. “We always like to set aside our advertising dollars and budget to actually do things in the community. Usually we’re giving away scarfs, hats, mittens around this time of the year but this time we said Christmas trees. It makes the house more festive.”\nElizabeth Riachi, 54, of southwest Detroit, had some friends help her fetch at least four trees and place them on the roof of the SUV she was being driven in, a few of them for neighbors who couldn’t make it.\n“We’re donating them to the seniors in the neighborhood,” Riachi said. “They couldn’t get out here. Some of them are not walking but we want to share their Christmas.”\nYamirka Torres, 24, who rode with Riachi, said she usually buys real trees every year at Home Depot for $25 to $30 but changed her mind when she found out about the giveaway.\n“A lot of people decided to come together,” Torres said. “It saves gas.”\nMost importantly, Riachi said these trees will “bring a little cheer” to people’s lives, especially those who don’t have access to a Christmas tree.\n“If we come into their home and put up the tree, that will be a blessing,” she said.\nlfleming@detroitnews.com\n(313) 222-2620\nTwitter:@leonardnfleming",

      "text": "McDonald's USA Planning Big Tech Push For Next Year, Finally Adding Mobile Orders In 2017 27 November 2016, 6:05 am EST By Alexandra Burlacu Tech Times McDonald's USA is finally planning to join the mobile era, introducing mobile ordering next year. Moreover, the fast-food chain also wants to deploy self-serving kiosks to make ordering quicker and easier. ( Justin Sullivan | Getty Images ) Advertisement \nOrdering a Big Mac from MacDonald's should become a lot easier next year, as the fast-food chain reportedly plans to introduce mobile ordering next year. \nFast food has the obvious advantage of being ready, but big lines and McDonald's registers or drive-thru can take a whole lot longer. This should be a thing of the past come next year, however, as McDonald's USA is planning a big tech push and is finally joining the mobile era in 2017. \nAlthough it's one of the world's most popular fast-food chains, McDonald's has been rather slow in adopting new technology. While other popular chains such as Starbucks , Papa John's , Pizza Hut , Domino's and others have embraced apps to facilitate ordering, McDonald's has remained one step behind in this department. McDonald's Mobile Ordering \nAccording to a recent Reuter's report , that's about to change. Starting in the first half of next year, McDonald's will reportedly allow customers to order items off its menu through the McDonald's smartphone app. Customers will be able to pay for the order within the app as well, so ordering McDonald's food will get a lot easier and faster. \nMcDonald's has yet to provide specific details on its mobile ordering rollout, but Reuters notes that a pilot will take place in the first half of 2017, with a full national rollout set for the second half of the year. The information comes from Chris Kempczinski, a former Kraft Foods exec who will be the president of McDonald's USA come Jan. 1, 2017. Kempzinski reportedly talked about McDonald's plans for next year at an event in New York City. \n\"As the company tries to become a 'modern, progressive company,' as one of its executive noted on Thursday, this is just the latest step to attract customers,\" TechnoBuffalo points out . \nThe McDonald's app has already racked up an impressive 16 million downloads, and the ability to order and pay for food and beverages within the app will surely make it even more popular. McDonald's Self-Serving Kiosks \nThe fast-food chain reportedly wants to make hefty investments in self-serving kiosks as well and is willing to help franchises deploy such kiosks by contributing money or financing. Deploying self-serving kiosks is expected to cost between $50,000 and $60,000, said McDonald's CEO Steve Easterbrook. The CEO further added that installing such kiosks is not expected to reduce the number of employees working in restaurants, as they would still have to help customers learn how to order through kiosks and the deliver the orders to customers' tables.

Rams guard Rodger Saffold gets ready to take the field before a game earlier this season. (Robert Gauthier/Los Angeles Times) \nRAMS WHO MUST DELIVER ... \nOffensive lineman Rodger Saffold . The versatile veteran, who in his career has played every position on the line except center, has started 10 games at left guard next to struggling tackle Greg Robinson. The Rams need Saffold to step up and lead a unit that must protect rookie quarterback Jared Goff and pave the way for back Todd Gurley . \nTight end Lance Kendricks . He committed a costly penalty late in last week’s loss to Miami, two weeks after dropping a certain touchdown pass at the Coliseum against Carolina. Kendricks did, however, catch four passes against the Dolphins , and the Rams need him to be a reliable veteran presence for rookie Goff. \nSafety T.J. McDonald. The Rams intercepted one pass against the Dolphins but they could have had several more, including one that was knocked out of McDonald’s grasp. McDonald helped set the aggressive tone against Miami and needs to do the same against Saints receivers who are deployed all over the field. \nSAINTS TO WATCH OUT FOR ... \nTight end Coby Fleener . Receivers Brandin Cooks, Michael Thomas and Willie Snead get most of the attention, but Fleener also has been productive for quarterback Drew Brees . Fleener has 33 catches for 402 yards and has scored three touchdowns. \nRunning back Mark Ingram . With 16th-year quarterback Drew Brees directing the NFL’s top passing offense, it’s easy to forget about Ingram, who was going through concussion protocol last week but has said he expects to play. The 2009 Heisman Trophy winner from Alabama is averaging 4.7 yards a carry and has rushed for two touchdowns. \nDefensive end Cameron Jordan . The former California star has four sacks and has forced a fumble for a defense that has not played poorly as of late (ranked 14th against the rush, and 27th overall). The 6-foot-4, 287-pound Jordan, the 24th player chosen in the 2011 draft, would no doubt like to make it uncomfortable for Rams rookie quarterback Jared Goff, the No. 1 pick in the draft from Cal.",

      "text": "Email \nORANGE, Conn. – Two McDonald’s employees called police after walking out of the restaurant to find a couple in a parked car “engaged in sexual activity,” police said Monday. \nThe workers had just finished their shifts at the Orange, Connecticut, McDonald’s around 9:30 p.m. on November 15, when they noticed the vehicle. One of the employees told a 911 operator it appeared the pair were having sex, and that “a small child was seated in the back, watching,” according to police. Kimberly Onorato, 28, and Rory Clark, 27, allegedly told police that they were “cuddling” after two McDonald’s employees called 911 to report two people engaged in sexual activity in the parking lot. (Town of Orange Police Department) \nWhen police arrived, they found a woman partially-naked in the front seat with a man, and a 6-year-old in the back seat who was “alert and awake,” WTIC reported. \nThe couple said they were “cuddling” after eating at McDonald’s, according to police. \nOfficers arrested Rory Clark, 27, of West Haven, and Kimberly Onorato, 28, of Bristol. Both were charged with second-degree breach of peace and impairing the morals of a minor. \nThey were both released on $5,000 bond. ",

      "title": "Arkansas Man Wins Lawsuit. Was Fired From McDonald's For Being HIV+",
      "text": "  26, 2016 \n\nDiscriminatory practices lost another case this month. \n\nA McDonald’s restaurant owned and operated by Mathews Management Co. and Peach Orchard Inc. in Bentonville, Ark., will pay $103,000 and furnish other relief to settle a disability discrimination lawsuit brought by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the agency announced. \nEEOC’s lawsuit challenged McDonald’s treatment of an employee when the restaurant fired him within days of learning of his HIV-positive status. The suit also charged that the companies’ policy of requiring all employees to report the use of prescription medication is also unlawful. \nSuch alleged conduct violates the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). EEOC filed suit ( Mathews Management and Peach Orchard, Inc. d/b/a McDonald’s Store # 32295 , Civil Action No. 5:16-CV-05166TLB) in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Arkansas, Fayetteville Division, after first attempting to reach a voluntary pre-litigation settlement through its conciliation process. \nAfter EEOC filed suit, the former employee intervened in the case with his own lawsuit and was represented by Joshua L. Bailey of the Hogue Law Firm in Fayetteville, Ark. \nIn addition to the monetary payment, the companies will also conduct disability training for its managers and revise their policy requiring mandatory disclosure of prescription medications. \nMathews Management Company owns and operates 34 McDonald’s restaurants, including all of the restaurants in Northwest Arkansas and adjacent areas in Missouri and Oklahoma. This includes the store located in Bentonville. - insurancejournal.com \n\n\nIt was not stated if John Doe (as he was referred to in the lawsuit) was LGBT. If he was fired for being LGBT, there would have been no protection for him. As we reported in February of 2015, just around the time when Doe was fired, It's Official: Non-Discrimination Laws Protecting LGBT Are Now Illegal In Arkansas: \n\nRepublican Gov. Asa Hutchinson allowed legislation to go into law without his signature that bars cities and counties from expanding anti-discrimination ordinances beyond what the state already prohibits, making Arkansas the second state to approve such a prohibition. Arkansas' anti-discrimination protections don't include sexual orientation or gender identity. Monday marked the end of the five-day window for Hutchinson to take action on the bill or allow it to become law. \nHutchinson had raised concerns about the bill infringing on local control, but said he wouldn't veto it. His office said his position hadn't changed and he allowed the proposal to become law, despite a last-ditch campaign by advocacy groups urging him to veto the legislation. The law won't take effect until 90 days after the Legislature formally adjourns, which is currently set for May. - The Associated Press \n\nCongrats Mr. Doe for your win.",

A 35-year-old man drove his vehicle into the corner of Decor Furniture, before hitting a McDonald's sign. (Photo: Photo provided by Indianapolis Fire Department) \nA vehicle drove into the corner of Decor Furniture before hitting a McDonald's sign poll on the east side of Indianapolis Sunday morning. \nA 35-year-old man was seen driving a Gold Ford E150 van erratically, heading east on 10th Street, around 11:40 a.m. Sunday. About a minute later, he crashed into the store located at E. 10th St. and N. Bosart Ave., according to a release from the Indianapolis Fire Department. After the vehicle drove through the corner of the building, the van crossed Bosart Avenue and hit a McDonald's poll. \nAfter coming to a stop, the five individuals in the car fled the scene. The driver of the car grabbed a six-year-old boy who had been in the car, before fleeing. \nIMPD found the driver, and he is being investigated for suspicion of OWI and possible endangerment of a child, according to the release. \nThere were no injuries. \nThe building was stabilized by IFD's Collapse Rescue Team, but they expect damage to the store to cost $35,000 to fix. \nFollow IndyStar reporter Kaitlin Lange on Twitter: @kaitlin_lange.  //indy.st/2gw4g6Y TOP VIDEOS",

      "text": "The real story behind McDonald’s mysterious 'Gold Card' — the ticket to unlimited free fast food Business Insider 1 hr ago Kate Taylor © By arugatse on Flickr When Rob Lowe appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live with a golden McDonald’s card last year, one big question remained: How could the Average Joe get his own card that granted him access to unlimited McDonald's?\nQuote: s in the article McDonald's Corp MCD\n▲ 120.66 +0.52 +0.43% Not easily, a little sleuthing revealed.\nThe first complication: Rob Lowe's Gold Card was not issued by McDonald’s corporate office. Instead, it is from the owner of, and can only be used at, McDonald’s franchises in Santa Barbara or Goleta, California.\nWhile Lowe says he received the Gold Card because his buddy’s dad created the McMuffin, McDonald's confirmed to Business Insider that he in fact received the card from David Peterson — the buddy in question, who is now a McDonald’s franchisee himself.\n© AP Images Herb Peterson, who passed away in 2008, was a legendary force in the fast-food world. He debuted the first Egg McMuffin at the Santa Barbara McDonald's he co-owned with David in 1972 . Peterson started his work with McDonald’s as the vice president of the company’s advertising firm, D’Arcy Advertising, and went on to become a franchisee and operator of six McDonald’s locations.\nToday, David Peterson has carried on his father’s legacy with the chain. Earlier this year, the franchises he runs in the Santa Barbara and Goleta areas became some of the first to launch “taste-crafted” sandwiches as part of the McDonald’s turnaround plan, reports local news station KEYT.\nPeterson also wields the power to give out Gold Cards, granting the recipient free McDonald’s at the locations he owns and operates. While Lowe is quite likely the most high-profile person to be awarded the card, he is not the first — just the first to brag about it on late-night TV.\nFor example, Larry Crandell was awarded a Gold Card by Peterson on his 90th birthday, reports SantaBarbara.com. While the cards are nearly identical, unlike Lowe’s card, Crandell’s awarded him free McDonald’s for life.\nCrandell is a bit of a celebrity in Santa Barbara, having reportedly helped raise millions of dollars for the community as a volunteer and expert emcee.\nAssuming you aren't a famous actor who has a personal connection with David Peterson or a local legend in Santa Barbara, California, there are other ways to get free McDonald’s.\nIn fact, McDonald's franchisees across the country appear to be more than happy to give local heroes free food with their own versions of the “Gold Card.”\n© Provided by Business Insider Warren Buffett Warren Buffett told CNBC he had a McDonald’s card that allowed him to order unlimited food for free in Omaha.\nCharles Ramsey , who ditched his half-eaten Big Mac to help rescue three kidnapped women in May 2013, was awarded free McDonald’s at all locations for a year and unlimited McDonald's for the rest of his life at local Ohio restaurants.\nIn March, Ottawa Senators goalie Andrew Hammond, nicknamed the Hamburglar, received a card that gave him free McDonald’s for life from an Ottawa franchisee who, coincidentally, was also the father of Hammond's former coach.\nHowever, there are only two major confirmed stories of people in possession of cards granting them free, unlimited McDonald's anywhere in the country, or even the world.\nWhile on the campaign trail in 2012, Mitt Romney told a story of how his father had a \" little pink card \" that awarded him free McDonald’s for life. McDonald’s confirmed that founder Ray Kroc had given Romney the card, but did not have any record of the reason for the gift. However, the chain noted that Kroc was known to informally gift these Lifetime \"Be Our Guest\" cards to various people throughout the years.\n© Provided by Business Insider Bill Gates The other lucky recipient of a lifetime of free McDonald's — not a little pink card, but a bona fide Gold Card, according to the company — is Bill Gates. According to Warren Buffett, Gates' card works worldwide. Of course, it is unclear how often Gates stops by McDonald’s these days, after The Gates Foundation Asset Trust liquidated its position in the fast-food company in February 2015.\nGetting your hands on a McDonald's Gold Card is no piece of cake. But, the legendary cards are real — and something that could end up in your own pocket, if you befriend the right McDonald’s franchisee.\nNOW WATCH: We went to check out the new 'walk-up' McDonald's that has no dining tables or chairs\nGo to MSN Home",

      "text": "(Before It's News)\n(Minghui.org) The 83rd McDonald’s® Thanksgiving Parade was held in Chicago on November 24, 2016. Falun Gong (also known as Falun Dafa) practitioners were invited to participate in the parade. They have participated in the annual parade for over ten consecutive years. The Falun Gong procession was placed in the tenth position of the parade. Their rich cultural performance earned warm applause from spectators.\nThe Thanksgiving parade is the biggest parade in Chicago. It is estimated that 400,000 viewers watch the parade in person, and 3.5 million watch the live broadcast on TV each year. The hosting organization selected about 100 groups from numerous applicants. The magnificent parade features gigantic balloons, marching bands, cavalry, decorated floats, and colorful performing groups.\nFalun Dafa practitioners participate in the 83rd Thanksgiving Parade in Chicago on November 24, 2016.\nCelestial maidens perform in the parade.\nPractitioners demonstrate the exercises on the float.\nLucy Atkinson from Cincinnati, Ohio, viewed the parade in person. She said that the Falun Gong procession was inspiring and that the float and dancing significantly enriched the parade. She was impressed most by the three words “Truthfulness-Compassion-Forbearance” displayed in the procession. She indicated that the words appeared peaceful and unifying.\nIn the audience were many Chinese viewers, including immigrant professionals, students, visitors, and tourists, who enjoyed watching the parade and experienced the freedom of seeing Falun Gong proudly displayed in the parade.\nMr. Cao, who came to the United States less than three years ago, works in suburban Chicago. He said, “I saw the Thanksgiving parade last year for the first time. I was so impressed, I came again this year.”\nWatching the Falun Gong procession passing by, he added, “They are kind-hearted people. The procession is graceful and rich in Chinese traditional culture.\n“I had misunderstandings about Falun Gong when I was in China. I have changed my view now, because it (Falun Gong) was banned in China and here it is quite different.”",

      "text": "NBC’s ‘The Voice’ rankings: Billy Gilman, We McDonald, Sundance Head rule top 10 November   \nLast week on “ The Voice ,” we officially said farewell to a young woman in Darby Walker who legitimately seemed like a contender entering the live shows. Unfortunately, a combination of questionable song choices and polarizing performances did her in, and now Miley Cyrus’ team seems to be in some jeopardy. She’s likely to lose Aaron Gibson soon, and her other team member in Ali Caldwell needs to have a rebound week. \nYou can see where these two singers land, alongside everyone else of course, in the latest edition of our show rankings below! Note, as always, that we’re basing these primarily on performance quality plus also screen time and \n10. Aaron Gibson ( last week : 11) – He’s been in the bottom for two straight weeks, and the last one was for a performance that we genuinely thought was really entertaining. If viewers aren’t exactly digging that, what does this mean for the remainder of the season? We don’t know how he crawls out of this hole. \n9. Christian Cuevas (9) – He’s sticking around despite not really having any notable performances so far, but without much staying power on iTunes or a significant edit beyond a marriage proposal, this coming episode could be his week to go. \n8. Courtney Harrell (8) – There’s not a huge reason to change things around for Courtney at the moment, even if we know ranking her in the same exact place as last week is rather boring. We know that she’s very talented, but she’s still looking for that individual moment to really connect with voters. \n7. Josh Gallagher (7) – He’s done okay at times on iTunes, just like he’s also been solid in most of the performances. Despite him being the only country artist so far to sing pretty consistently country music throughout the season, there’s just not much he is doing right now that stands out on an eye-popping level. \n6. Ali Caldwell (3) – We’re really hoping that this past performance, which landed her outside of the top 100 on iTunes, is an aberration more so than reality. We’ll take the fact that she was spared the bottom two, despite performing a cheesy Dolly Parton cover at the start of this past episode, as a sign she’s still got fans. \n5. Austin Allsup (6) – While he’s still not the #1 country artist on this season, kudos to Austin for showing a little more versatility than we thought he would on the show this past week. Let’s make it clear that we have no problem watching country singers perform only country songs. We just want them to be creative about it in the event that’s what they do. \n4. Brendan Fletcher (4) – Two weeks in, and Brendan’s delivered on a couple of strong performances that have charted very well. We thought that he and Aaron were going to split some of the pop-rock-singer-with-a-gruff-voice audience, but that hasn’t happened. He should be safe for a little while. \n3. Sundance Head (5) – He’s coming off of his most-popular performance of the season, and we have to say that this is the Sundance we were expecting going into the live hows in terms of him being a big threat to dominate the votes. Interestingly, the best thing that could possibly happen to him is for the other country artists to be eliminated so he can take the lion’s share of them for himself. \n2. We McDonald (2) – We’s going to probably be the favorite of many voters out there, and following what we saw this past episode, we understand why. She feels a little bit like a young Janelle Monae in between her style and the way that she carries herself on stage. She’s a little raw still, but that just means that she has so much more potential and that’s somewhat terrifying. \n1. Billy Gilman (1) – It’s going to take moving heaven and earth to take Billy out of this spot for us before the finale. Why in the world would we consider moving a guy down who’s done very well in all of his performances, charted high on iTunes, and had a fairly large following before even doing the show? It just doesn’t compute. \nNow, let’s turn this over to you! Vote for your favorite in the poll below, and head over here to get some other updates related to “The Voice” so far this season.

      "text": "The real story behind McDonald’s mysterious 'Gold Card' — the ticket to unlimited free fast food Business Insider 5 hrs ago Kate Taylor © By arugatse on Flickr When Rob Lowe appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live with a golden McDonald’s card last year, one big question remained: How could the Average Joe get his own card that granted him access to unlimited McDonald's?\nNot easily, a little sleuthing revealed.\nThe first complication: Rob Lowe's Gold Card was not issued by McDonald’s corporate office. Instead, it is from the owner of, and can only be used at, McDonald’s franchises in Santa Barbara or Goleta, California.\nWhile Lowe says he received the Gold Card because his buddy’s dad created the McMuffin, McDonald's confirmed to Business Insider that he in fact received the card from David Peterson — the buddy in question, who is now a McDonald’s franchisee himself.\n© AP Images Herb Peterson, who passed away in 2008, was a legendary force in the fast-food world. He debuted the first Egg McMuffin at the Santa Barbara McDonald's he co-owned with David in 1972 . Peterson started his work with McDonald’s as the vice president of the company’s advertising firm, D’Arcy Advertising, and went on to become a franchisee and operator of six McDonald’s locations.\nToday, David Peterson has carried on his father’s legacy with the chain. Earlier this year, the franchises he runs in the Santa Barbara and Goleta areas became some of the first to launch “taste-crafted” sandwiches as part of the McDonald’s turnaround plan, reports local news station KEYT.\nPeterson also wields the power to give out Gold Cards, granting the recipient free McDonald’s at the locations he owns and operates. While Lowe is quite likely the most high-profile person to be awarded the card, he is not the first — just the first to brag about it on late-night TV.\nFor example, Larry Crandell was awarded a Gold Card by Peterson on his 90th birthday, reports SantaBarbara.com. While the cards are nearly identical, unlike Lowe’s card, Crandell’s awarded him free McDonald’s for life.\nCrandell is a bit of a celebrity in Santa Barbara, having reportedly helped raise millions of dollars for the community as a volunteer and expert emcee.\nAssuming you aren't a famous actor who has a personal connection with David Peterson or a local legend in Santa Barbara, California, there are other ways to get free McDonald’s.\nIn fact, McDonald's franchisees across the country appear to be more than happy to give local heroes free food with their own versions of the “Gold Card.”\n© Provided by Business Insider Warren Buffett Warren Buffett told CNBC he had a McDonald’s card that allowed him to order unlimited food for free in Omaha.\nCharles Ramsey , who ditched his half-eaten Big Mac to help rescue three kidnapped women in May 2013, was awarded free McDonald’s at all locations for a year and unlimited McDonald's for the rest of his life at local Ohio restaurants.\nIn March, Ottawa Senators goalie Andrew Hammond, nicknamed the Hamburglar, received a card that gave him free McDonald’s for life from an Ottawa franchisee who, coincidentally, was also the father of Hammond's former coach.\nHowever, there are only two major confirmed stories of people in possession of cards granting them free, unlimited McDonald's anywhere in the country, or even the world.\nWhile on the campaign trail in 2012, Mitt Romney told a story of how his father had a \" little pink card \" that awarded him free McDonald’s for life. McDonald’s confirmed that founder Ray Kroc had given Romney the card, but did not have any record of the reason for the gift. However, the chain noted that Kroc was known to informally gift these Lifetime \"Be Our Guest\" cards to various people throughout the years.\n© Provided by Business Insider Bill Gates The other lucky recipient of a lifetime of free McDonald's — not a little pink card, but a bona fide Gold Card, according to the company — is Bill Gates. According to Warren Buffett, Gates' card works worldwide. Of course, it is unclear how often Gates stops by McDonald’s these days, after The Gates Foundation Asset Trust liquidated its position in the fast-food company in February 2015.\nGetting your hands on a McDonald's Gold Card is no piece of cake. But, the legendary cards are real — and something that could end up in your own pocket, if you befriend the right McDonald’s franchisee.\nNOW WATCH: We went to check out the new 'walk-up' McDonald's that has no dining tables or chairs\nGo to MSN Home",

      "text": "MCDONALD, Ohio (WKBN) – With the village mayor moving to a state representative position next year, McDonald council will be meeting next month to name a temporary replacement before an official election is held in May to name a successor.\nMayor Glenn Holmes was recently elected to serve as representative to the 63rd Ohio House District. He has been mayor for 14 years and also serves as president of council.\nHolmes said he’s proud to have served as mayor and is excited for the future. He also believes in his administration and all they have left to accomplish.\n“We’ve got a transition plan in place and projects set for the next year or two,” Holmes said. “And the administration, who is the glue with the legislative authority, will make sure everything stays in tact.”\nIn December, a new council president will be named for 2017.\nThat person will serve as mayor from January-May when a special election will be held to fill the remainder of Holmes’ unexpired term through December 2019.\nThis embed is invalid",

      "text": "Order Reprint of this Story \nIn 1967, Idaho potato magnate J.R. Simplot shook hands with McDonald’s CEO Ray Kroc, sealing a deal that made Simplot the first frozen french-fry supplier to the fast-food chain. That deal brought billions of dollars to the Idaho economy. \nUntil then, McDonald’s had purchased only fresh potatoes. The J.R. Simplot Co. had supplied about 20 percent of the spuds that became McDonald’s fries, according to “Behind the Arches,” a1995book chronicling McDonald’s rise. \nBy convincing Kroc that frozen fries would deliver consistency and overcome a shortage of Russet Burbank potatoes in the summer — and that he could deliver — Simplot instantly became McDonald’s largest spud supplier. McDonald’s bought potatoes from other sellers as it expanded around the globe, but Simplot remains McDonald’s largest domestic potato supplier, said Dell Thornley, the chain’s director of global supply chain and sustainability. \nA McDonald’s marketing video released Nov. 11 offers a glimpse into the Boise company’s role without mentioning Simplot. The video features a Glenns Ferry potato farmer, Mark Noble, discussing potatoes with two McDonald’s chefs. Noble sells those potatoes to Simplot for processing into frozen fries. \nSince the legendary handshake, Simplot has diversified and grown into an international agribusiness that grossed $5.8 billion in sales last year. McDonald’s remains its largest customer. \n“Where we go, they go,” Thornley told the Idaho Statesman. “That’s exactly the reason Simplot is in places like China. They are really a valued partner.” place_number1 \nThe partnership has also been profitable for the Noble family. \nAllen Noble started selling Russet Burbanks to Simplot for McDonald’s for fries 54 years ago. The potato cultivar, sometimes called the Idaho Russet, is the most commonly grown potato in North America, in part because it handles processing and freezing well. \nAllen Noble is still involved in Noble Farms, but today his son, Mark, 61, farms 1,500 acres of potatoes with a brother-in-law and a stepbrother. The video that features him is being shown in McDonald’s restaurants and on the company website and social-media pages \nNoble said selling to Simplot has provided welcome stability in a volatile industry. \n“When you deal with somebody for a long time, you know their history, and they know yours,” he told the Statesman. “It’s been very, very good to us.” \nNoble said the family used to sell some of its potatoes to Ore-Ida, the frozen Tater Tot processor headquartered in Boise until 1999, as well as some to the fresh market. \n“We don’t anymore,” he said. “We’re satisfied dealing with Simplot. It’s the road we chose to take.” \nNoble said several of his nephews are in line to take over the farm. He expects they will keep selling to Simplot. \n“We’re definitely exposing themto those relationships,” he said. \nSimplot is not McDonald’s sole fry supplier. McDonald’s also buys from at least two other companies with Idaho operations. \nOne, McCain Foods, a Canadian company, is McDonald’s largest international potato supplier. It operates processing plants in Fruitland and Burley. \nThe other is Lamb Weston, which just spun off from ConAgra and established its headquarters in Eagle. Lamb Weston has processing plants in Twin Falls and American Falls that employ 1,300 people. \nSimplot, McCain and Lamb Weston supply more than 70 percent of McDonald’s potatoes worldwide. \nSimplot now has five plants in the U.S. making McDonald’s fries, said Keith Franzen, senior director of Simplot’s McDonald’s unit, based in Chicago. Those plants are designed to ensure that fries and hash browns are formed, precooked and delivered to look and taste the same at each restaurant. \nOne of those plants is in the Treasure Valley. In 2013 and 2014, Simplot laid off about 800 workers at potato processing plants in Caldwell, Nampa and American Falls and replaced the plants with a new, state-of-the-art plant in Caldwell that employs fewer people. \n“Their attention to quality makes us be a better company,” Franzen said. “We worked closely with McDonald’s throughout the process in Caldwell. They were on-site and with us as we brought the plant online.” \nThornley, a Blackfoot native, worked as a Simplot agronomist for four years in the 1980s. After working with McDonald’s to develop a potato supply chain in Turkey, Thornley took his current position at McDonald’s making sure its restaurants in Europe have all of the spuds they need. \nMcDonald’s has long valued stable, longtime partners like Simplot, Thornley said. \n“We have partners in the beef and bakery categories that go back to Ray Kroc,” he said. “Some of those relationships are going through their second and third generations.” \nMcDonald’s calls Russet Burbanks the “gold standard variety” for fries, but it has adopted nine other varieties overseas where Russets don’t grow as well, Thornley said. And breeders in Idaho, Washington and Oregon are working on new high-yield varieties called Clearwater, Umatilla and Ranger. \n“Even in the Pacific Northwest, the Russet Burbank is not the easiest potato to get growing, and it has some weaknesses to it,” Thornley said. \nFranzen said Simplot’s relationship with McDonald’s will enrich Idaho for years to come. \n“I see nothing but upside for the J.R. Simplot Co. and Idaho,” he said. “We’ve continued to be able to grow together and work on new products and projects. I don’t see that changing in the future.” \nZach Kyle: 208-377-6464 , @IDS_ZachKyle \nStill no GMO fries at McDonald’s \nMcDonald’s does not use genetically modified potatoes, including Simplot’s line of Innate-brand potatoes. The potatoes, which received regulatory approval , are designed to reduce bruising and black spots, which increases storage capacity, and reduce a chemical that can become a carcinogen when cooked. \nMcDonald’s does not plan to adopt use of genetically modified potatoes, said Dell Thornley, the chain’s director of global supply chain and sustainability. \n“That’s because of consumer acceptance, and, globally, because we need to be able to move products, and there are areas where genetically modified products aren’t allowed,” Thornley said. \nSimplot has said Innate potatoes were designed for the fresh-pack market and, because they don’t brown when cut, they will be perfect for restaurants, caterers and large-scale food preparers who can save time by using precut spuds. \nZach Kyle \nHow Simplot’s gambled — and won — on making frozen fries for McDonald’s \nJ.R. Simplot did not build his small Boise into an international agribusiness powerhouse by playing it safe. \nA 1995 book by John Love, “Behind the Arches” chronicles McDonald’s history, including the integral role Simplot played — and the risks he took to embed his company into McDonald’s DNA. \nSimplot’s entrepreneurship started when he was a teenager, with a scrap metal business. He parlayed that into a pig farm, which he later flipped for a potato farm. \nHe produced the first dehydrated potatoes. Potato flakes were a novelty until the U.S. Army purchased all it could to turn into mashed potatoes to feed to soldiers. By the end of World War II, Simplot ran 14 dehydrated-potato plants. The Army’s demand for potato flakes ended with the war, costing Simplot his biggest customer. \nIn the early 1960s, Simplot supplied 20 percent of McDonald’s potatoes. At the time, McDonald’s could only serve Russets, which made the crispest fries, nine months of the year, because they spoiled in storage during the summer. Simplot invested $400,000 — worth more than $3 million today — to create a national network of cold-storage facilities.T \nBut the potatoes spoiled anyway, costing Simplot his investment. \nHe hatched an idea that would solve two problems: converting his dehydrated potato operations to frozen spuds to sell to McDonald’s. \nSimplot pitched the idea to Harry Sonneborn, McDonald’s president. “He laughed at us,” Simplot recalled, according to the book. “The only thing he was interested in talking about was fresh potatoes.” \nAt the urging of a lower McDonald’s executive, Simplot approached McDonald’s CEO Ray Kroc with his idea. \n“I told him that frozen fries would allow him to better control the quality and consistency of McDonald’s potato supply,” Simplot said, according to the book. “They were having a hell of a time maintaining potato quality in their stores. The sugar content of the potatoes was constantly going up and down, and they would get fries with every color of the rainbow.” \nKroc had already enlisted a food scientist with a decade of research at a Simplot competitor, Lamb Weston, now based in Eagle. He developed a process to quickly blanch and prefry and freeze potato products that did not rob them of their consistency, flavor or brown hue. Unlike previous frozen fries, these were crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. McDonald’s patented the process. \nMcDonald’s had previously approached Lamb Weston about producing frozen potatoes, but that company was unwilling to shoulder the financial risk of building a plant. Simplot was. \n“Simplot was so convinced that his team could convert [the] process into a commercial operation that only a year after his cold-storage loss, he was ready to stake nearly 10 times as much on a new McDonald’s Gamble,” Love wrote. “On a handshake agreement with Kroc, Simplot invested $3.5 million to put the experimental frozen-fry process into a production line with the capacity to turn out 25,000 pounds of frozen fries in an hour. There were no guarantees.” \n“Beyond the Arches” said Simplot was going to bet on frozen potatoes with or without McDonald’s. \n“I figured, hell, if the old man didn’t take these fries, I would expand the plant for myself,” Simplot said. “It gave me a good excuse to build the kind of frozen french fries plant I wanted.” \nThe gamble paid off. In addition from increasing Simplot’s sales to McDonald’s from 20 percent to more than half of the chain’s potato demand, Simplot later modified the process, producing similar fries for Wendy’s and other chains. By the time Love’s book was published in 1995, nearly a quarter of the nation’s potato crop went to frozen fries, up from 2 percent in the 1950s. McDonald’s alone served a quarter of them. \nZach Kyle",

      "text": "McDonald’s to introduce mobile payment and ordering in the US in first half of 2017 8:04 am By Conner Flynn \nOur phones are more powerful than ever these days and can be used for almost anything. They can help us stay fit, access the entire Internet, allow us to immediately connect with friends and family, take photos and videos, and much more. \nEven so, they currently can’t order Big Macs. McDonald’s is one of the most popular fast-food chains in the world, but the company has been a bit slow when it comes to their adoption of new technology. Companies like Starbucks allow customers to place orders for food and drinks directly through the official Starbucks app, and now it looks like McDonald’s will be introducing similar functionality within in their own app next year. It is about time. Starting in the first half of 2017, McDonald’s will allow you to order items from their menu through the McDonald’s app on your smartphone, then there will be a full-fledged national rollout in the second half of the year. The app will let you order and pay for your items within the app. It’s nice to see that the company is finally moving forward with being more mobile-friendly. Customers are going to love it and it should mean more business.",

      "text": "Workers at McDonald’s restaurants in Malaysia claim they earned as little as 60p an hour and were cheated out of months of salary, a Guardian investigation has found.\nThe workers allege they were subjected to months – and in some cases years – of exploitation by Human Connection HR, a labour supply company contracted by McDonald’s in Malaysia to provide workers to its restaurants in Kuala Lumpur.\nThe workers, who come from Nepal, say they had their passports confiscated, in contravention of Malaysian law. \nThey claim they were deceived about their wages and were charged additional fees when they arrived in Malaysia, resulting in a 25% deduction in their basic monthly salary. Over the course of working at McDonald’s, this equated to the loss of months of wages.\nUnlike in its other major markets – including the UK and US – where McDonald’s operates through a franchise model, McDonald’s outlets in Malaysia are company-owned.\nThe migrants also say that their salaries were not received on time, leaving them unable to buy food or send money home to their families.\nMalaysia: forced labour casts dark shadow over electronics industry Read more \n“We didn’t have the money to eat because we were not paid regularly,” said one man, adding that some workers went on strike earlier this year in protest at late payment of wages. “How can we go to work on an empty stomach? I thought it was a good company and I would earn good money. Now my life is damaged. I feel that I have no future.”\nMcDonald’s Malaysia said in an email that it had ended its contract with Human Connection. “At McDonald’s Malaysia, the welfare of staff is a top priority,” said the company. “Earlier this year, we became aware of certain circumstances relating to services provided by Human Connection HR which were not in compliance with our standards. As a result, we have terminated our contract with them.”\n\nThe investigation, which comes just days after the Guardian exposed allegations of abuse among migrants making products for Samsung and Panasonic in industrial zones across the country, sheds further light on the malpractice of some labour supply agencies used by major international brands in Malaysia.\n“We were not given our salary on time,” said another Nepalese worker. “When we went to meet the managers of McDonald’s to complain, they usually said we were not employed by McDonald’s and they are not responsible for anything. One of my friends even went to the McDonald’s manager crying after he heard news of his child’s death [at home in Nepal]. He asked him to ask for his passport [from Human Connection, so that he could attend the funeral,] but the McDonald’s manager said that he cannot do anything. I would rather die than go back to work at McDonald’s. I will never work there [again].”\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest McDonald’s Mid-Valley in Kuala Lumpur. Migrant workers employed here (not pictured) claim they were paid erratically by the labour supply firm that hired them. Photograph: Pete Pattisson \nThe Guardian spoke to 15 Nepalese workers formerly employed at four McDonald’s restaurants in the capital, Kuala Lumpur. The men worked at McDonald’s at different times over the course of three years.\nMore than half said that they had been forced to run away from their jobs without their passports or back pay, entering the illegal work market in an attempt to make some money. This would leave them vulnerable to arrest and detention by the Malaysian authorities. \nOthers said they had been forced to pay their own way back to Nepal after their passports were not returned by Human Connection. \nSome of the workers criticised McDonald’s for failing to respond to complaints of mistreatment by Human Connection while they were working in McDonald’s outlets.\n\nThey claim that they repeatedly informed the company about problems relating to wages, salary deductions and passports, but received no assistance. \n“I complained about our salary to McDonald’s many times, and the branch manager … sent the message to McDonald’s headquarters,” said one worker. “[But] McDonald’s said they had already paid Human Connection.”\nI expected to earn money here. But I’m leaving with nothing\nNepalese migrant worker \nThe manager of one McDonald’s branch that previously employed some of the workers claims that the company’s headquarters in Malaysia were informed about the problems the men faced: “The labour supply company withheld two to three months’ wages. The workers only had a photocopy of their documents, but they should have had the original with them. We are humans. We tried to help them with food, but you can’t do it all the time.”\nDuring their time working in McDonald’s restaurants, the men claim they were paid less than they were promised in Nepal. In some of their contracts it states that they would not have to pay the foreign worker levy, a charge placed on companies using migrant labour in Malaysia that is often passed on to the workers themselves. Payslips seen by the Guardian show that the levy was deducted, however, equating to a 25% reduction in their basic wages.\nThe workers also claim that they had their passports confiscated by the labour supply company on arrival in Malaysia, a pervasive but illegal practice that ties them to their employer and denies them the freedom to leave their job or the country.\n“The supply company took our passports, but they will not send workers back to Nepal or give our passports back,” said one man formerly working at a McDonald’s restaurant. “Even those who finished the three-year contract cannot go home because they don’t have their passports.”\n\nAnother worker said: “Even when it is time to go, the company does not return your passport. I don’t know why … I asked to go home, but the company said they will not send me back.”\nThe workers who chose to return home have had to pay the equivalent of two months’ basic wages to a middleman to arrange the documents and paperwork needed to get them back to Nepal without their passports.\n“I expected to earn money here,” said one. “But I’m leaving with nothing.”\nThe men also complained about the conditions they faced in the accommodation provided by Human Connection while they worked in McDonald’s restaurants.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A hostel used by Nepalese migrants working at McDonald’s in Kuala Lumpur. The workers say up to 18 men shared the space, with most sleeping on the floor. Photograph: Pete Pattisson \nThe Guardian visited one squalid hostel with paint peeling off the damp walls. McDonald’s advertising banners were used as makeshift curtains. In one room, a McDonald’s trophy was propped up on a fan switch with “Best of the Best Kitchen Crew” printed on its base. At one point, the workers say, 18 men were crammed into the small flat, with most sleeping on mattresses on the floor. They shared one small, grimy toilet, which also passed as a washroom.\nFirms profiting from their business in places like Malaysia can’t say they're unaware of issues facing migrant workers\nAidan McQuade, director, Anti-Slavery International \nIn a statement, McDonald’s said: “While local employees make up the vast majority – more than 90% – of our workforce, we sometimes work with established recruitment agencies which employ foreign workers, and sub-contract a number of them to McDonald’s in Malaysia. These staff members are employees of the recruitment agency, not McDonald’s.\n“McDonald’s Malaysia made repeated attempts with Human Connection HR to investigate and verify issues of non-compliance shared by the workers, raising our serious concerns through both verbal and written correspondence. Because the workers are not employees of McDonald’s, our efforts to address the issues were unsuccessful, as were proposals for McDonald’s to assume responsibility for paying workers directly. In the interim, to assist, we authorised restaurants to provide food and provisions to workers affected while we worked to address the issue. \n“Following the termination of our contract, the workers remain employees of Human Connection HR and as such we understand that they will either return to their home country or be redeployed to other businesses.”\nHuman Connection did not respond to a request for comment on the worker’s allegations.\nAidan McQuade, director of Anti-Slavery International, said businesses must no longer hide behind codes of conduct but should instead take proactive measures to ensure they are not profiting from exploited labour.\n“The great tragedy about this kind of exploitation is that it is actually easy to fix,” he said. “Companies operating and profiting from their business in places like Malaysia can’t say that they are not aware of the issues facing migrant workers there. They need to take a proactive investigative approach to ensuring that, if they use labour supply companies, those companies are adhering to the law and corporate codes of conduct. It’s time for this to stop.”\nThis reporting is supported by Humanity United",

      "text": "November 28, 2016 at 09:34 AM EST McDonald's Becomes #15 Most Shorted Dow Stock, Replacing Travelers Companies The most recent short interest data has been released for the 11/15/2016 settlement date, and we here at Dividend Channel like to sift through this fresh data and order the underlying components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average by \"days to cover.\" There are a number of ways to look at short data, for example the total number of shares short; but one metric that we find particularly useful is the \"days to cover\" metric because it considers both the total shares short and the average daily volume of shares typically traded. The number of shares short is then compared to the average daily volume, in order to calculate the total number of trading days it would take to close out all of the open short positions if every share traded represented a short position being closed.",

      "text": "Watch live in person on historic State Street or at home on WGN 9 Chicago and WGN America\nCHICAGO, IL, November 17, McDonald's Thanksgiving Parade, a high-quality, family event attracting hundreds of thousands of spectators, celebrates 83 years of Chicago holiday tradition. Loveable character balloons, top marching bands from across the country, festive floats, cultural groups, theatrical performances, equestrian groups, and celebrity guests, plus over a thousand dedicated volunteers, all marching through the Loop, make the McDonald's Thanksgiving Parade an annual celebration for the whole family. For those not in Chicago, the parade is nationally broadcast, live, on WGN America. The 2016 McDonald's Thanksgiving Parade takes place LIVE on State Street between Congress Parkway and Randolph Street in downtown Chicago on Thanksgiving Day, Thursday, November 24 from 8 to 11 a.m. (CST).\nChicago-born Matt Walsh of HBO's Veep will serve as the Grand Marshal of this year's Parade. Walsh will be joined by comedian, Sebastian Maniscalco, Emma Kenney from Showtime's Shameless and Dante Brown from Fox's new Lethal Weapon. Returning to the parade will be Northbrook's own Yuri Sardarov from the TV hit series Chicago Fire and chef, restauranteur, and Top Chef host/judge Graham Elliot.\nMcDonald's Owner/Operators of Chicagoland and Northwest Indiana, the title sponsor of the parade, will also present the McDonald's Community Fire Truck, the Jesse White Tumbling Team, the Ronald McDonald Care Mobile in Partnership with Advocate Children's Hospital, Hinsdale South High School Marching Band, Lake Zurich High School Marching Band, The Hiplet Ballerinas of CMDC, Michigan City Soul Steppers Drill Team and Ronald McDonald and his Big Red Shoe. The Northwest Indiana McDonald's Operators are also presenting the Pantry on the Go.\nOriginally called the Christmas Caravan in the 1930s, the Parade was created in 1934 to help lift the spirits of residents suffering through the Great Depression. Since then, it has developed into a full-scale spectacle that celebrates the holiday season. What once started out as an attempt to boost Chicago's economy has evolved into a cherished holiday tradition for Chicagoans and Americans alike. Over sixteen different countries will share their enriched traditions with Chicago's Parade this Thanksgiving morning. The sights on State Street give the audience a chance to travel the world and embrace other traditions, all without leaving downtown Chicago\nBroadcast\nWGN 9 Chicago airs the Parade live and in high definition from 8 to 11 a.m. (CST) Thursday, November 24. WGN America also broadcasts the Parade nationwide, establishing it as one of only a few elite parades in the country to be covered live, in its entirety, on a national television broadcast. The Parade streams live online at www.wgntv.com and CLTV rebroadcasts the parade from 1 to 4 p.m.\nAbout MOCNI\nMcDonald's Owner/Operators of Chicago and Northwest Indiana represent more than 100 franchisees and nearly 500 restaurants throughout the greater Chicagoland region, including stores as far north as Gurnee, west as Marengo, south as Watseka and east to Northwest Indiana.

      "text": "  1:32 pm \nYou ever take your dog to McDonald’s? I imagine not many have. And even the people who have probably don’t feed their dog burgers. \nBut in this video, Brutus Maximus the Rottweiler gets to enjoy a rare treat: a McDouble! Granted, you could probably argue whether or not this is actually something his owner should be giving him, but Brutus doesn’t seem to mind (although, let’s be real, it’s not like any dog would mind). Of course, the big old rottweiler inhales the entire thing in one bite, pretty much taking the entire burger into his mouth whole. I guess his appetite is as big as he is.

      "text": "http://str.sg/4Qxd Copy \nAn investigation by The Guardian newspaper has found that workers at Malaysia's McDonald's restaurants have been subjected to exploitation by a labour supply company working with the fast-food chain. \nThe workers from Nepal say they were not paid on time, had their salaries reduced and their passports confiscated, which contravened Malaysian law. \nThe labour supply company, Human Connection HR, had allegedly deceived the workers about their salaries and charged them additional fees, such as a foreign worker levy amounting to a 25 per cent deduction from their basic monthly salary, after they arrived in Malaysia. \nMalaysia's McDonald's is company-owned, unlike the franchise model that other countries such as the US and the UK have. \n\"We didn't have the money to eat because we were not paid regularly,\" The Guardian quoted one worker as saying. Some workers went on strike earlier this year to protest late payment of salaries. \"How can we go to work on an empty stomach? I thought it was a good company and I would earn good money. Now my life is damaged. I feel that I have no future.\" \nIn response to The Guardian's query, McDonald's Malaysia said it had ended its contract with Human Connection. \"At McDonald's Malaysia, the welfare of staff is a top priority,\" it told The Guardian. \"Earlier this year, we became aware of certain circumstances relating to services provided by Human Connection HR which were not in compliance with our standards. As a result, we have terminated our contract with them.\" \nThe British newspaper also recently investigated alleged abuse among migrant workers in Samsung and Panasonic in Malaysia. \nFor this report, it spoke to 15 Nepalese workers who worked previously for McDonald's in Kuala Lumpur. More than half said they were forced to run away without their passports or back pay, and worked illegally elsewhere to make money. Others said they had to pay their own way back to Nepal after Human Connection did not return their passports. \nThose who did say they had to pay the equivalent of two months' basic salary to a middleman for documents needed to get them home without their passports. \nHuman Connection did not respond to The Guardian's queries on the workers' allegations.

Jeffrey Hale, a spokesman with Delaware State Police. \nOne of the men, armed with a handgun, vaulted over the sales counter and confronted an employee, Hale said. At the same time, two other men who were also armed walked behind the counter and confronted another employee, he said. \nAll three demanded cash and the employees complied, Hale said. They then fled from the scene with a fourth person, Hale said. \nThe first man, who police say vaulted over the counter, was described as black, about 5 feet 6 inches to 5 feet 11 inches tall and weighed about 150 to 170 pounds. He wore all dark clothing and had his face partially covered with a cloth.",

      "text": "Facebook 0 Twitter \nMeet Yuka Kinoshita. If you haven’t seen one of her videos before, know that this girl loves to eat (just like us, albeit a lot more intense). \nIn Japan, they call her oogui bijyo (or ‘gluttonous beautiful woman’). She lives up to her nickname in the following video, wherein she eats – nay, devours – five macs, ten dark chocolate pies, ten white chocolate pies, three tiramisu McFlurries, three large fries, and three large Cokes. \nThat’s about 10,000 calories worth of McDonald’s in one sitting! \nThis isn’t new to her, though. In the past, she’s stuffed down one hundred Chicken McNuggets, 3kg of instant noodles, and three large pizzas, on separate occasions. \nWhile a diet like this probably isn’t healthy, Kinoshita says that she’s perfectly fine. \n“When I got examined by a doctor, it was determined that I have a very unique stomach,” she said. “My stomach is able to expand and fill up all the spaces within my body. That is why I can eat so much.” \nShe added that her special anatomy keeps her from gaining weight. “My body doesn’t digest things at the same rate… and just passes them through.”",

The fast food chain has just begun selling battered, deep-fried cheese curds in Wisconsin, reports Brand Eating . \nThe solidified pieces of curdled milk are a huge element of Wisconsin cheese culture. As of Nov. 28, McDonald's will make the fried curds available throughout the state. Initially, the test began in the Milwaukee area of Wisconsin only. \nUnfortunately, with all the cheese curds available in the state, McDonald's will only keep the item around for a limited time. Hopefully if tests do well, we can hope to see these deep-fried beauties make a national expansion. \nUntil then, we'll be living vicariously thorough our Wisconsin brothers and sisters. \nYou can find an exclusive image of the product courtesy of Scripps Media .

      "text": "McDonald’s to Take $235 Million Charge in Q2 \nThe biggest scandal in VW’s history has wiped billions off its market value and made it much more expensive for the company to borrow money through its preferred route of the debt market. \nVW’s credit ratings have slipped, with S&P downgrading the carmaker in two steps to BBB+ from A. Daimler has an A rating while BMW is rated A+. \nVW had hoped its bonds would return to more normal levels by last spring, allowing it to issue debt and repay the bridge loan. Sources told Reuters that VW had drawn up to half of the loan by the summer, but the auto maker said the loan was currently undrawn. \nA U.S. judge last month approved VW’s $14.7 billion settlement with authorities and owners of 475,000 2.0-litre diesel cars and is due to discuss proposals for buybacks and fixes for 80,000 3.0-litre vehicles on Wednesday. \n“VW is still looking to return to the bond market and once a settlement deal for its 3.0-litre diesel engines is approved by the U.S. court, it should be able to outline its emissions scandal liabilities in a bond prospectus,” Reuters said, citing the sources. \nThe bridge loan was reportedly split between 13 banks, with eight banks supply 1.825 billion euros each and the five others each providing loans worth 1.08 billion euros. \nVW said it was still taking advantage of ABS (asset-backed securities) transactions and commercial paper.

Food-safety agency Rosselkhoznadzor said Friday it will decide this week whether to impose a quarantine following an outbreak of the virus, which is transmittable by contaminated grain, in the Krasnodar region. \"I think the risk is quite low, but if they block all ports in Krasnodar there will be a huge effect on total Russian grain exports and a huge effect on the world market,\" says Andrey Sizov. More than half of Russia's grain is shipped through Krasnodar at ports including Novorossiysk and Tuapse.
