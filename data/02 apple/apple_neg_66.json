First, identify the “article of manufacture” to which the infringed design has been applied. Second, calculate the infringer’s total profit made on that article of manufacture. “article of manufacture.” The only question we resolve today is whether, in the case of a multi-component product, the relevant “article of manufacture” must always be the end product sold to the consumer or whether it can also be a component of that product. Under the former interpretation, a patent holder will always be entitled to the infringer’s total profit from the end product. Under the latter interpretation, a patent holder will sometimes be entitled to the infringer’s total profit from a component of the end product. \n“an article of manufacture” is “simply a thing made by hand or machine” and therefore \n’s interpretation of the term “article of manufacture” was wrong. Justice Sotomayor, however declined to address the question of what the term actually meant in a situation such as the present. (Samsung had previously argued that the term should have been construed to mean the screen or case of a smart phone – but the Federal Circuit had rejected this approach on the basis that these components were not sold separately.) In declining to address this issue Justice Sotomayor noted: §289 damages inquiry and to parse the record to apply that test in this case…but Samsung and Apple did not brief the issue. We decline to lay out a test for the first step of the §289 damages inquiry in the absence of adequate briefing by the parties. \n’s profits was available as a remedy for infringement of utility patents, but this was removed by statute in the 1946 Patent Act as a result of similar difficulties to those encountered in the present case in working out exactly what basis should be used for calculating these profits when the patent was directed to only one component or feature of an article. \nLadas & Parry LLP Ladas & \"My best business intelligence, in one easy email\" » * - hide Privacy Policy \nJD Supra provides users with access to its legal industry publishing services (the \"Service\") through (the \"Website\") as well as through other sources.

      "text": "Technology Are Apple, FANG Stocks Ready To Join The Trump Rally? Apple and big internet stocks rallied on Wednesday, but most have been market laggards since the presidential election. (iStockphoto) Reprints \nWhile stocks have rallied since the presidential election, Apple and the so-called FANG stocks — Facebook ( FB ), Amazon ( AMZN ), Netflix ( NFLX ) and Google parent Alphabet ( GOOGL ) — have largely sat out the Trump rally. Several of these tech titans are on the upswing this week, but with one notable exception their charts remain challenged. \nApple and FANG postelection woes reflected, in part, a big rotation into sectors such as banks and infrastructure-related companies that might do well under a Trump administration. But several of the megacap techs — including Apple, Amazon and Facebook — had reported disappointing results or guidance heading into Election Day. \nThe Nasdaq composite did retake its 50-day moving average late last week and came within 1 point of its all-time high. The Nasdaq 100, home to the index's biggest stocks, finally retook its 50-day line on Wednesday. IBD'S TAKE: Apple and most of the FANG stocks are showing weak relative strength vs. the broader market. True market leaders show rising RS lines. To find stocks with RS lines hitting new highs, take a free Marketsmith trial . Apple \nApple shares rose 1% on the stock market today to 111.03. The stock is consolidating in a flat base with a 118.79 buy point. But while Apple found support at its 200-day moving average on Nov. 14, the stock remains pinned below its 50-day line. Also, Apple's relative strength line, which compares the stock's performance against that of the S&P 500, has been trending down and is near its Nov. 14 lows. That RS line (the blue line on the stock chart below) shows how Apple continues to be a market laggard. \nRELATED: \nApple Music Hits 20 Million Subscribers As Pandora Debuts Rival Service Facebook \nFacebook is the biggest laggard of these tech stocks, struggling ever since warning of \"meaningfully\" slower ad revenue growth after reporting stellar Q3 results. Facebook is stuck below its 200-day moving average, with the 50-day line a challenge for later. Facebook's RS line is near its lowest levels in seven months. \nRELATED: \nAT&T, Time Warner Combo Needed Vs.

Shares have risen 4% so far this week, including a 5.70 gain to 770.42 on Wednesday. But the RS line hasn't made much of a recovery, and the stock is still below its 50-day line. Amazon is working on a flat base with a potential 847.31 buy point, but it has work to do. \nRELATED: \nAmazon's Next Big Growth Opportunity Could Be Apparel Netflix \nNetflix is the only one of these big techs that is above its 50-day line, though even the internet TV leader is not a market leader right now. It helps that Netflix was the only one of these five stocks that had clear-cut strong earnings and guidance, with the stock blasting out 19% on Oct. 18, with further gains for several sessions. After pulling back in the first half of November, Netflix began moving higher, finding support just above its 50-day line. \nNetflix is in a yearlong cup-with-handle base , with a buy point of 129.39. Shares closed at 125.38 on Wednesday, up 3.8% so far this week. \nNetflix is on Leaderboard , IBD's premium stock charting service of top-rated stocks. \nRELATED: \nNetflix Leaps On Stock Upgrade, Reality TV Push Alphabet \nAlphabet stock rose 2% to 791.47 on Wednesday as it approached its 50-day line. But it's still below that support level. Google's parent found support at its 200-day line at the end of last week. \nAlphabet appeared to deliver solid Q3 results on Oct. 27, with shares just hitting an all-time intraday high on the following day. But they quickly reversed and traded lower through Nov. 14. \nBut Alphabet, despite Wednesday's above-market gain, hasn't made much ground vs. the broader market. Its RS line remains near its recent lows. \nRELATED:",

      "text": "0 \nEarlier this year, Apple ran a couple of ads that promoted the iPad Pro, focusing on the Smart Keyboard and the Apple Pencil to show how versatile the device is. Of course, Microsoft probably watched those ads like a lot of people who know that the Surface products exist, and laughed the appropriate amount. \nOf course, as easy as it is to point out that other products already exist that do the same things, it's not like Apple's the only company that does this. It's just the nature of technology, where eventually, and probably more often than not, there are similarities in functionality. That isn't a bad thing. \nIn those ads, Apple asks, \"What's a computer?\" and shows off cool things iPad Pro owners can do with that Apple Pencil and Smart Keyboard. \nThere is a lot to be said about that ad, and not just for the ad itself, either. While the company wants it to be clear that there's a clear distinction between its Mac lineup of products and the iPad, it seems pretty obvious that Apple has been putting a lot more focus on the products that begin with \"I\" -- iMac not included. \nA lot of Mac products have been left to wallow as potential buyers wait for upgrades to the hardware. The MacBook Pro finally just got a legitimate upgrade after years of missing out, for instance. And the Mac Pro? It's been now more than a thousand days since that piece of hardware was upgraded in any meaningful way. \nSo it makes sense why Apple might want to present the iPad Pro as something that can, maybe, replace a computer. \nI know a few people who this is actually the case. They had aging MacBook Airs and they decided to go with iPad Pros. Two of them picked up the 12-inch model, while another went with the 9.7-inch variant. All of them are at different stages of ownership at this point, one of them only having the iPad for a couple of months, but they are all happy campers as far as I can tell. \nOnly one of them went with the Smart Keyboard from Apple, though, because they, like me, don't like cases. The other two went with third-party options that offer a more traditional keyboard feel, but apply a case to the entirety of the iPad. So the experiences are slightly different in each case, but ultimately they all replaced their computer with an iPad. \nI'm one of the folks that tried this, but, ultimately, my day-to-day routine just wasn't having it when I tried. For the most part I could get away with it, but while iOS makes it super easy to use a finger to copy or cut text, trying to do these things quickly is much better suited for a mouse. \nI don't think mouse support is going to arrive for the iPad lineup any time soon, but I know that if it were to arrive, I could honestly consider replacing my computer with one of Apple's tablets. I probably still wouldn't do it, just because I like my computer, but at least the option would be a realistic one. \nWhere do you stand? Have you replaced your computer with a tablet? Or is that simply not an option for you, either? Let me know!",

      "text": "Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak shows 7th and 8th graders how to use an Apple Macintosh computer circa 1993. Image: Getty Steve Wozniak Was My Computer Teacher in 1995 December 7, 2016 // 12:00 PM EST Copy This URL \nI grew up in Silicon Valley two decades before it was cool enough to be the title of a show on HBO. My parents were conventional hippies who drove Volvos donned with “Save Tibet” and “Question Authority” bumper stickers. The public elementary school I went to in the Santa Cruz Mountains had only 30 kids in the 5th grade. \nNo matter their livelihoods or income levels, whether they were on food stamps or had enough money to get their kids their own miniature drivable Power Wheels Jeeps for Christmas —the parents would help out in whatever ways they could. My dad would take our class on nature walks while another girl’s mom led our Girl Scout troop. In 5th grade, we’d stay after school so my friend Sara’s dad could teach us about computers. \nSara’s dad happens to be Steve Wozniak, co-founder of Apple . \n“It was less important to me what you teach, and more important to motivate people by making things as fun as you can,” Wozniak told me recently over the phone, after I reconnected with him nearly 22 years later. “I had that liberty because I was sponsoring the class myself and wasn’t under the guidance of a principal. My intent was not to train people to become computer specialists or work for computer companies. We don’t need everyone in life to be computer experts.” A photo of the author's class showing off their Macintosh PowerBook laptops provided by Wozniak. The author appears on the slide, near the top. Image: Cati Myer \nThe Keys to the Kingdom of the Early Internet \nWozniak was teaching my 5th grade class back in 1995, almost a decade after the brain behind the Apple 1 had left the company to start other ventures, including CL9, which brought the first programmable remote control to the commercial market. \nThinking back to that class, I remember looking out the classroom window on our first day. It was raining and Steve walked across the playground wearing a red, white, and yellow umbrella hat—indicative of his love for quirky innovations. He walked in, took off his hat, and asked us to gather around. Then he pulled a floppy disk out of his pocket and proceeded to take it apart to show us what each piece did. In the back of the room were 30 brand new Apple Macintosh PowerBooks (1400c) on loan to us. He said that those who mastered the concepts would get to keep theirs at the end of the year. “It was less important to me what you teach, and more important to motivate people by making things as fun as you can.\" \nWe spent the next months learning how to use the internet, set up a network, and build simple webpages. I remember feeling like I had the keys to some magical kingdom. \nSteve had a sincere demeanor about the class, but he made sure to keep things interesting. Some days he’d bring us McDonald’s Happy Meals, which felt rebelliously exciting for kids who were regularly force-fed granola by health conscious parents. He also loved sharing fun gadgets with us. One day he gave us all laser pens, which he instantly must have realized was a mistake, as we spent the rest of class sneakily trying to blind each other. \nWhen I Discovered the Web Wasn’t Made By Spiders \nI was not exactly your ideal tech learner. When Steve told us he was going to teach us how to get on the “world wide web”, I imagined some secret underground tunnel where we’d be able to climb gigantic spider webs that connected every town around the world. I had heard about people trying to dig holes to China—who knew they had it all wrong? \nI was at first disappointed when I discovered the web was invisible and inside my computer, but my disappointment was soon replaced by glee when Steve introduced us to America Online. He helped us set up usernames and we’d dial in and wait for the voice of God to tell us we had mail. I soon decided this was way cooler than a giant underground spider web.

When we were in dial-up speed times, we could hardly imagine real live instantaneous things. But pre-internet, AOL had chat rooms which were kind of like the social web. You could get into rooms and categories you wanted to. As far as what it would lead to in the future, I just assumed computers would become more and more commonplace in school. All the schools were getting labs.” \nLearning Lessons in Online Privacy (With a Little Help From Jonathan Taylor Thomas) \nOnce I realized that we could technically connect to anyone or anything, I immediately wanted to know if my childhood celebrity crush and Home Improvement kid star Jonathan Taylor Thomas would come hang out with me. Surely, he had the internet. So naturally I emailed him at telling him how much I loved him on the show and that I know he was probably really busy but if he came to visit, I’d show him my Pog collection. I gave him my address and phone number just in case. \nTwo weeks later my parents received a very polite typed letter from a dentist in Des Moines telling them they should monitor their daughter’s activity online as she was giving out their personal information to total strangers. And there I had my first lesson in internet privacy at the age of 10. \nWoz’s Legacy as a Computer Teacher \nOf the 30 kids in our class, at least eight of us have gone into careers in technology. One of my former classmates, Dan Leis, said that Steve teaching us binary and networks like the long-dead Token ring , inspired him to go into tech. I have no such memory of that part of the curriculum and can only assume that was being taught when I snuck out to play “Truth or Dare” in the greenhouse behind our classroom. Another classmate, Bianca Yacoub, who now works at Apple in California, mentioned how he taught our class in her interview. Yacoub had a vision impairment due to albinism, and had a hard time seeing the font on our laptops, so Steve went to her house and installed a huge screen so she could see the lessons better.

It was no secret that I was not the star pupil of that class. I found computers to be fun, but the technical aspect was lost on me pretty early on. One time Steve caught me zoning off and was instantly plagued with guilt. After class he came up to me and asked how I was liking the class. I replied with a cheerful, “Good!” but followed up with a confession that I didn’t love learning about computers the way some kids did. He just smiled and asked me what I did like. \nI admitted that generally, school was hard for me, but I loved art and in his class I liked the software that let you build things, like Sim City . He said those things were important, too, and that when he was younger, he didn’t like school much either. He was kind and nonjudgemental, and let me just be me about it.

Let them go off and do what they like to do and don’t force them to be going at the same speed as somebody else. Most of school might as well just be daycare anyway. If people have something in their heart, you shouldn’t slow them down...I liked being a super geek, but I definitely never pushed my values on other people.” \nAt the end of the year, we were all given a hard copy of Steve’s biography, Steve Wozniak, Inventor of the Apple Computer , by Martha E. Kendall. The kids awarded free computers had sparkly star stickers on their back page. I opened mine flipped to the back, where in place of a star, there was a note that read, “Go build great things. Best, Steve.” \nLooking back now, I think “The Woz” being something of a tech God was lost on us, as were many things when we were 10. I think we all just thought of him as Sara’s cool, super smart dad who made computers. We also thought it was cool that another girl’s dad was a firefighter, and that our class pet rabbit would eat pretty much anything you fed it. We were kids. Regardless, he gave us the freedom to be who we were, to discover our own passions, and defy imposed normative structures, whether they be from the confines of a school curriculum or parents who wouldn’t let us eat Mickey D’s. \nSyambra Moitozo is Associate Producer for Daily VICE. \nGet six of our favorite Motherboard stories every day by signing up for our newsletter .

      "text": "increase font size Augusta woman pleads guilty to robbing Big Apple An attorney for Jessica L. Morang, 38, said she 'voluntarily entered a substance abuse treatment plan and is doing very well.' Read Article \nAUGUSTA — A former Pittston woman pleaded guilty Wednesday to robbing The Big Apple convenience store in June on Stone Street in Augusta. \nJessica L. Morang, 38, now of Augusta, is scheduled to return to the Capital Judicial Center on Jan. 10, 2017, for imposition of the sentence, which the prosecutor told the judge Wednesday is an agreed-upon 24 months if all goes well between now and then. Police issued this photo in connection with a June 21 robbery at The Big Apple store on Stone Street. The suspect, later identified as Jessica L. Morang, pleaded guilty Wednesday to committing that robbery. Photo courtesy of Augusta police JESSICA MORANG Search photos available for purchase: Photo Store → \nJustice Robert Mullen warned Morang that if there are any problems, the maximum sentence available to the court for the robbery conviction is 10 years of imprisonment. \nHer attorney, Stephen Bourget, said Morang “voluntarily entered a substance abuse treatment plan and is doing very well.” \nAssistant District Attorney Kate Marshall described the robbery, which occurred about 5 a.m. June 21, when a woman wearing a hooded sweatshirt, sunglasses and plaid pajama pants walked into the store past a clerk who was outside on a smoke break. \nMarshall said the woman told the clerk “Sorry, hon, this is a robbery,” and the clerk asked if she was serious. The woman said she was. \nMarshall said the sweatshirt had a pocket, and the suspect put her hand in “and gesticulated as if she was a carrying a weapon,” so the clerk thought there was a weapon. \nThe clerk handed over $270, and the woman left. Surveillance video showed a pickup truck leaving the scene, and it was later identified as belonging to Morang’s father. Marshall said it was being driven by a co-defendant, Abraham C. Matt, now 31, formerly of Augusta and Whitefield. A trash bag containing the clothes Morang wore during the robbery was found at Morang’s father’s home, where Morang and Matt lived for a time, the prosecutor said. \nAugusta police arrested Morang on the robbery charge on Aug. 2. \nWhen he was arrested, Matt told police he and Morang had a drug problem, Marshall said. \nMatt was sentenced in October for committing a separate robbery July 25, 2016, at the same store and is serving to 42 months in prison. \nMorang previously served 18 months in prison on a burglary charge. \n“If you got into trouble again, any sentence you receive undoubtedly will be harsher because of this,” Mullen said on Wednesday. “I don’t know if you’ve ever been robbed before, but it’s a very frightening experience. I can just imagine how it felt when it happened.” \nAs part of the sentence, the state is seeking $270 restitution, Marshall said. \nBetty Adams — 621-5631",

      "text": "Potential NHL deal could bring Apple iPads to team benches By Wednesday, December 07, 2016, 04:09 pm PT (07:09 pm ET) A report on Wednesday claims Apple is in late-stage talks with the National Hockey League to bring iPads and supporting backend infrastructure to team benches, a deal similar to one struck with Major League Baseball earlier this year. Source: NHL Citing multiple sources familiar with the ongoing talks, TSN reports the NHL has for years discussed a technological partnership with both Apple and its rival Microsoft. However, negotiations with Apple recently accelerated after a deal to provide iPads to National Basketball Association teams fell through. NHL officials informed teams of the possible Apple partnership last week, the report said. Though terms have yet to be finalized, sources claim a deal will likely materialize in the near future. \"It's possible it could collapse, but it's pretty far down the path for that to happen,\" one source said. Potentially holding up the partnership is NHL's plan to architect a major sponsorship revenue stream akin to the program fostered by the National Football League, which struck lucrative multi-year deals that put Microsoft Surface tablets, Bose headphones and Motorola equipment on the sidelines. Likewise, the NHL is reportedly seeking a contract from Apple worth at least $5 million per year, but the Cupertino tech giant has traditionally shied away from vanilla sponsorships. \"The NHL Apple deal is more a major partnership than a sponsorship,\" said an unnamed source. \"Right now, some teams have iPads or other tablets and some don't. Some have good Internet connections, some don't. This deal is about having a consistent platform that every team can use in every rink.\" Interestingly, MLB spinoff BAMTech is said to be involved in the negotiations. BAMTech started life as an arm of MLB's Advanced Media division specializing in direct-to-consumer content delivery. The branch quickly grew into a video streaming powerhouse with a long list of big clients including HBO, the PGA TOUR, WWE Network and, notably, the NHL. In August, Disney announced a $1 billion investment in BAMTech, good for a 33 percent stake in the company, as part of plans to launch a dedicated ESPN streaming service. The NHL also has a stake in BAMTech and last year agreed to a six-year deal that grants the firm rights to stream certain out-of-market games live. According to today's report, BAMTech is also developing a platform for player and puck tracking as part of said agreement, technologies that go hand-in-hand with an iPad-based team management system.

      "text": "AFP | December 8, 2016 Apple Music launched in June 2015 as Apple, which revolutionized digital music with iTunes 15 years ago, saw the future in streaming -- a service that allows online listeners to play unlimited music on demand. \nApple’s streaming service says it has reached 20 million subscribers, showing quick growth as the tech titan tries to close in on sector leader Spotify. \nApple Music launched in June 2015 as Apple, which revolutionized digital music with iTunes 15 years ago, saw the future in streaming — a service that allows online listeners to play unlimited music on demand. \nSenior Apple official Eddy Cue, revealing the figures in an interview with Billboard published late Tuesday, predicted further rapid gains entering 2017. \n“There are billions of people listening to music and we haven’t even hit 100 million subscribers. There’s a lot of growth opportunity,” Cue told the music-industry magazine. \nHe said that more than 60 percent of Apple Music subscribers have not bought from iTunes for the past year — a sign of streaming’s steady rise over pay-per-track downloads. \nApple Music still trails Spotify, which announced in September that it had 40 million paying subscribers. \nThe Swedish company also has a free, advertising-backed tier — controversial among some artists — which brings Spotify’s total listeners to 100 million. \nSpotify and Apple Music have plenty of smaller competitors including established streaming players Deezer and Rhapsody and rap mogul Jay Z’s upstart Tidal. \nOnline retail giant Amazon in October entered the streaming war, offering a discount rate to subscribers who use the company’s speakers. \nApple, like Tidal, has sought to erode Spotify’s base by offering exclusives. Apple Music had early windows in which it alone offered the latest albums by leading hip-hop artists Drake, Chance the Rapper and Frank Ocean. \nApple did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the figures.",

      "title": "iPhone 6 iOS 10.1.1 Update: 9 Things to Know in December",
      "text": "Its been five weeks since Apple replaced iOS 10.1 with iOS 10.1.1. With that in mind, we want to take a look at the most important things you need to know about the iPhone 6 iOS 10.1.1 update as we push into December.\nAdvertisement\nIn September, Apple confirmed an iOS 10 release date for the iPhone 6 and its other iOS 9 powered devices and on September 13th the company pushed the iOS 10 update to iPhone 6 models around the globe.\niOS 10 delivered new features and enhancements but it also brought problems to the iPhone 6, iPhone 7, and other popular mobile devices.\nIn an effort to clean up iOS 10, the company’s released several bug fix updates for the iPhone 6 and its other iOS 10-powered devices.\nThe latest is iOS 10.1.1, a small update that brings a key fix to the former flagship smartphone.\nThe iPhone 6 iOS 10.1.1 update is a tiny update if you’re coming directly from iOS 10.1. If you’re coming to iOS 10.1.1 from iOS 9 or iOS 8, it’ll be much larger due to iOS 10.1 and iOS 10. The features from Apple’s previous iOS 10 updates are baked into iOS 10.1.1.\nAdvertisement\nWith the smoke from the iOS 10.1.1 release settled we want to take a look at the most important things iPhone 6 owners need to know about the iOS 10.1.1 update at the five week mark.\nThis roundup offers a quick iPhone 6 iOS 10.1.1 review, details about the iOS 10 downgrade, a look at some of the problems plaguing the iPhone 6 after iOS 10.1.1, and a whole lot more.\nCheck back for regular updates as we make our way into December.\niPhone 6 iOS 10.1.1 Update Review 1 / 9 We've been using the iPhone 6 iOS 10.1.1 update for a little more than five weeks and we've been keeping a close eye on key areas like battery life, connectivity, and UI speed. Here's what we've found during our time with the current version of iOS 10.\nAdvertisement\nWe haven't noticed any major problems with iPhone 6 battery life with the iOS 10.1.1 update on board. The device continues to hold an excellent charge at the five week mark.\nIf you recently installed iOS 10.1.1 on your iPhone 6 and you're seeing battery drain issues give it a couple of days to settle in.\nIf it fails to settle after a couple of days with iOS 10.1.1 installed, you'll want to try some manual fixes for battery life problems.\nWe've tested the phone and its update with several ISPs, routers, and Bluetooth devices and we're still having an excellent experience. We haven't noticed any major problems or dropped connections. AT&T LTE/4G continues to perform at a high level as well.\nThe iPhone 6 is still extremely fast with iOS 10.1.1 on board. Animations and transitions are incredibly fluid and we haven't experienced any lag in problem areas like Control Center and the Notifications tray.\nThe iOS 10.1.1 update is treating our iPhone 6 well at the one month milestone. We recommend it for most iOS 10 users.\nThat said, you'll want to seek out a second or third opinion before you make your move. This is especially important if you're coming from iOS 9.3.5 or below. You can't go back to iOS 9 once you make the move to iOS 10.\n1 / 9",

      "text": "December 07, 2016 Visitors try out Hi-Fi headphones on Apple iPods at the new Apple Store | Sean Gallup/Getty Images \nTechnology moves quickly, and that’s usually a great thing. It’s why great smartphones no longer need to be expensive . It’s also why you don’t need to replace your computer or your phone as often as you did in the past. It’s the reason that most of us have switched from massive libraries of MP3 downloads to streaming services, too. (These streaming services offer all of our favorites in the cloud, no laborious downloading and cataloging necessary.) But sometimes, despite the new features and easier workflows of the latest and greatest apps, we still miss what came before. That’s especially true with a device we all knew and loved: the iPod. \nThere are many reasons as to why we miss our old iPods. We remember our tender young age when we first saw a slick Apple advertisement (or had our first IRL sighting of the iPod and its white earbuds, courtesy of that kid in school who got every new thing first) and coveted one for ourselves, but these reasons go beyond that. And this is about more than a sentimental, but ultimately misguided, desire for technology’s steady pace of innovation to stand still so we can always have the first gadgets we fell in love with, like the weird cell phones of the early 2000s . \nIn fact, we think that there are some reasons why you probably miss your old iPod, and at least a few that will have you wondering why you ditched that iPod for Spotify or Pandora or Apple Music in the first place. Ready to walk down memory lane with us? Read on to reminisce about the things that we all loved about iPods, and how they might be just a little bit better than the streaming services we’ve all adopted today. 1. Managing music is more complicated now Apple’s CEO Tim Cook presents the new iPod Nano | Glenn Chapman/GettyImages \nWe never thought we’d say this once we bid our extensive iTunes catalogs goodbye. But managing music used to be a whole lot simpler. As David Sims reports for The Atlantic, managing the music you’ve stored locally on your smartphone requires dealing with all of the capabilities and annoyances of a device that’s built to do a lot more than store and play music. He notes that he buys music directly on his phone in order to avoid dealing with iTunes, which has gotten more slow and less usable since the heyday of the iPod. (The device that could do a lot less than your smartphone, but also required less of users who just wanted to manage their music collections.) \nBut not everybody still stores music locally on their phone, which means that they’re at the mercy of streaming service catalogs. Many people pick one streaming service, choose a free or paid plan, and then deal with its limitations (and the holes in its catalog). Streaming devotees who want to make sure that they have access to all of their favorites may have accounts with several different streaming services. But remembering which playlists are where — and which cloud their favorite albums reside in — gets complicated quickly. There’s no easy solution, and the situation has us yearning for the much more straightforward days of buying any music we wanted and loading it without fanfare onto our iPods. 2. iPods were delightfully low-maintenance Maintaining an iPod took little to no effort | Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images \nWe’d be crazy to say that iPhones (and other modern smartphones) aren’t great. They’re fast and capable, and they give us access to a practically limitless array of apps and features. But what they aren’t is low-maintenance. You have to manage your apps, update your software, and watch out for your security and privacy online. If you try to connect your iPhone to your computer, perhaps to move some music onto it, you’ll likely encounter a to-do list of tasks and strange rules about what content you’re able to sync between the two devices. And if you’re unlucky, a rogue software update may revert your music library with no warning or rationale. \niPods, on the other hand, were designed just for your music. An iPod didn’t require shelling out for a cellular contract. It didn’t constantly interrupt your music-listening with notifications about who’s texting you or who’s sending you “urgent” emails. And it didn’t remind you of all of the things on your to-do list (both virtual and real-life). Sure, you can store music on your smartphone, but a smartphone is a much more demanding device than an iPod. Sync enough music to your iPhone and you’ll inevitably encounter some quirks and software bugs. Those are things that — at least with the rose-colored glasses with which we look back on obsolete technology — just didn’t seem as prevalent with the iPod and iPod-era iTunes builds. 3. Curating a music collection used to be fun Making your own playlists for you and your friends on iTunes was a blast | Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images \nStreaming services are convenient, and in some ways, they make it easier to discover new music and novel artists. They also make it easy to find a playlist that perfectly fits your mood (even if that seems to work better in theory than in practice, as many Spotify users have determined ). As Nathan Ingraham reports for The Verge, “The notion of a music collection has been obliterated by the fact that we can stream nearly any song ever recorded and released, for free, instantly.” That’s great if you don’t have the cash to buy all of your favorite albums, but not so great if you actually enjoyed curating your music library. \nIngraham writes that he doesn’t really want to go back to syncing his music with iTunes over a USB cable. He also points out that it’s great to be able to instantly access any music that you want, whenever you want to listen to it. But, he adds that he “can’t help but miss the days when I laboriously curated my MP3 collection, taking nearly as much delight in a well-organized collection of MP3s as our parents might have taken with a shelf full of vinyl records.” \nStreaming services make it easy to find and instantly access your favorites. But they also make it easier to lose track of your playlists or forget what you’ve been listening to without looking at your phone. How many of your favorite artists could you name right now? Probably fewer than you could when you were manually and laboriously curating a library of MP3s. 4. iPods were easy to use with one hand — unlike modern smartphones iPods were small enough that you could use them with one hand and fit them in your pocket | Justin Sullivan/Getty Images \nThe iPod’s heyday came long before the industry-wide push toward giant smartphones . No matter which model you chose, you could easily control the device (and navigate your music library) with one hand. That was useful whether you were listening while walking, biking, riding the subway, carrying a drink, or even just sitting at home on your couch. Wherever you were, you could fire up your iPod and find the right song with just one hand. \nBut many modern smartphones are difficult to use with one hand thanks to their bright, beautiful, but massive screens. Particularly if you don’t have exceptionally large hands, you probably find it difficult to navigate your favorite streaming app one-handed, which can make it a pain to switch albums or search for a playlist when you don’t have both hands free. Being able to play, pause, and browse music using just your thumb was one of the iPod’s most convenient features, and one that we consistently miss now that we have bigger screens (and fewer click wheels) in our lives. 5. The iPod made it easier to feel connected to your music Apple’s iPod made you feel connected to the songs and artists you chose to listen to | Ryan Anson/AFP/Getty Images \nThe final reason that we miss our iPods is sentimental, at best, and completely irrational at its worst. As Mat Honan wrote for Wired upon the “death” of the iPod, the device’s ability to put your entire music library in your pocket was big. And the iPod also made it easy to find and share the music that, for better or for worse, many of us felt was a reflection of who we were. As Honan puts it: \nWe made playlists that spoke to the lives we lived at the moment. Looking at someone’s iPod was like looking into their soul. In their music you could see who they were. You could tell if they were sophisticated or rough. You could see in their playlists the moments they fell in love and the moments they fell back out again. You could see the filthiest, nastiest hip hop in the little white boxes of the primmest people, and know their inner lives a little better than you did before. \nWe took our iPods and our favorite songs and our playlists everywhere. As all High Fidelity fans know, “we all experience music autobiographically.” Honan lamented not only the death of the iPod, but also the fact that “music doesn’t define anyone anymore.” Thanks to the rise of streaming services, we don’t have (or maintain) our own music libraries anymore. Honan wrote, “I miss the time when we were still defined by our music. When our music was still our music. I miss being younger, with a head full of subversive ideas; white cables snaking down my neck, stolen songs in my pocket. There will never be an app for that.” The concept of having our own music died with the iPod — and that may be what makes us so sad to see the iPod go. 2016-12-07 17:47:00",

      "text": "Apple reportedly working to rent new movies early on iTunes They could be available only a couple of weeks after first hitting theaters. Share Save \nAccording to Bloomberg , Apple is in talks with major movie studios to offer early rentals on iTunes . The report, which cites sources familiar with the ongoing discussions, suggests 21st Century Fox, Universal Pictures and Warner Bros., are trying to find a partner to help them rent films \"as early as two weeks\" after they first hit theaters. That said, Bloomberg does note that the Hollywood overlords may \"end up choosing another technology platform\" instead of iTunes, although no specifics were given. \nIf such a deal were to take place, chances are viewers at home would have to pay a premium for this type of service, since it would take some revenue away from the box office. For now, all we know is that the studios allegedly want these rentals to be \"high-priced,\" so you should definitely expect to pay more than the usual $5 or $6. \nSean Parker , Napster founder and tech entrepreneur, is trying to do something similar with \" The Screening Room ,\" which aims to rent movies the same day they come out in theaters for $50 per view. Most importantly, he claims his service offers a secure anti-piracy technology, something that's very important to the movie companies. \nEven at that price, you'd probably still end up saving a bit of cash by skipping the trip to your local movie theater -- time to start stocking up on popcorn and hot dogs.",

The company gave a demo of Pandora Premium at an event in New York late Tuesday, and, if you are a Pandora member already, you got an email Wednesday pointing to a company blog post that said, well, not a lot about the details of the service.\nSome of the things Pandora had to say were that Pandora Premium “is designed to open up a world of music completely unique to you,” that the “upcoming features tune into each listener’s individuality and leverage our deep knowledge of musical data,” and “it will be an effortless and flexible experience for all subscribers.”\nAlso, Pandora Premium won’t be available until “early 2017.” Pandora didn’t say what the service will cost, but, based on what similar music-streaming services like Spotify and Apple Music charge, it’s widely believed that Pandora Premium will come with a $10-a-month price tag.\nAnd with Pandora Premium, Pandora will complete its gas-station-style services, as the higher-end service will go along with the company’s current free, ad-supported streaming option and its new Pandora Plus $5-a-month ad-free service.\nBut, will there be a Pandora to run Pandora Premium? The company is said to be open to selling itself, possibly to the likes of satellite radio company Sirius XM , and one of the mysteries around any such deal would be if the possible acquirer wants to keep the Pandora name around.\nMiddle Innings:",

      "text": "Ryan Scott | 31 seconds ago \nWould you be willing to pay $25 to rent Justice League or Jurassic World 2 on iTunes from the comfort of your home while the movies are still in theaters? That very well may be something that is possible by the time those movies come out. It turns out Apple is in negotiations with several major movie studios to gain access to new movies in order to have them available for rent much earlier than they currently are. \nThe news comes courtesy of Bloomberg who simply cited \"people with knowledge of the matter\" as their source for this information. That said, it doesn't sound at all surprising. Apple is big on capitalizing on new ideas whenever they can and they tend to be early to adopt emerging technologies, media and consumer access. They were one of the first companies to make it easy for people to get podcasts and they also revolutionized digital music in the early 2000s when iTunes launched. So why not revolutionize movie rentals as well? Apple is reportedly in talks specifically with 20th Century Fox, Warner Bros. and Universal Pictures. \nAs it stands, iTunes will typically be allowed to give their users access to movies about 90 days after their initial theatrical release. Assuming they can work out a deal that allows for that time period to be dramatically shortened, it will most definitely come at a cost. How much that cost will be or the specific time period that Apple is aiming for is unclear, but movie studios are trying to find new ways to capitalize on their big releases and this could be a way to do it, but only if the consumer is willing to pay a premium to watch something like Deadpool 2 from the comfort of their couch on their iPad, instead of at a crowded movie theater on opening weekend . \nBloomberg also reported recently that several major studios , such as Warner Bros. and Universal, have been having ongoing, preliminary conversations with major theater chains to try and negotiate a new on-demand model that would allow big movies to be available to consumers much sooner than they are currently. The problem is that theater chains are reluctant because that could wind up hurting their business. The studios are reportedly aiming to charge anywhere between $25 and $50 for these early rentals, should a deal get worked out. That should give some idea of what iTunes would be charging if Apple can make something happen. Head of Warner Bros. Kevin Tsujihara had this to say about it. \"We're working with them to try and create a new window. But regardless of whether it happens or not -- whether we are able to reach that agreement with them, we have to offer consumers more choices earlier.\" \nIt is clear that pretty much everyone wants some form of change in the near future and it all has to do with money. It is simply too expensive and too much of a hassle for some people to go to a movie theater these days, but if the movie were available to rent from home, studios like Warner Bros. may be able to find a new revenue stream and Apple could clean up on premium rental fees. But studios still rely on box office way too much, so if theater chains don't want to play ball, this won't happen anytime soon. Ultimately, this will probably come at a cost to the moviegoer. Either via a premium rental fee or a more expensive movie ticket, because theaters will need to make up the difference. For now, it looks like these talks are pretty preliminary, but don't be surprised to see a deal get worked out in the relatively near future. Especially now that Apple is involved, and they are known for making mainstream innovation happen above all else.",

That’s despite what IDC says is a whopping 71-percent decline in growth compared to the same period twelve months ago. IDC’s numbers claim 1.1m Apple Watch shipments in the three month period end..

[NK World] Apple and Beijing-based phone retailer Zoomflight are suing the Beijing Intellectual Property Bureau and Chinese phone maker Baili after the bureau demanded Apple and Zoomflight stop sales of Apple's iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus models for alleged patent infringement, Xinhua cited the Beijing Intellectual Property Court as saying. Previously, Baili accused Zoomflight of selling the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus models, which Baili claimed had infringed on the patent of its 100C phone models. The bureau ruled in favour of Baili in May but Apple and Zoomflight appealed against the ruling. During the Wednesday trial, the plaintiffs and defendants debated about whether the bureau had gone against legal procedures in the process leading up to the ruling. The trial lasted about seven hours. The court will announce its verdict at a later date. sku/",

      "text": "\nIt’s been a few weeks since Apple’s new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar was released, and there has been a flurry of reactions to it. On the forefront of said reaction, the computer’s new Touch Bar has been at the center of heated controversy. What can’t be argued is the performance issues the new MacBook Pros have been experiencing.\nWe got our very own 15-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar here in the office, which we built fully loaded. But in our testing, it hasn’t performed up to expectations. Battery life isn’t as great as Apple promised and the performance isn’t holding up for a “pro” computer. Not exactly what you want from a brand new machine that is thousands of dollars.\nIn the end, after countless searches through forums and a visit to the local Apple Store, we’re still left feeling underwhelmed by Apple’s new laptop. The whole ordeal is quite frustrating.\nCheck out the video above to see Jon’s issues with the new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar.\nSee full gallery on TechnoBuffalo ",

      "text": "Chinese Users Complain Of Exploding Apple iPhones \nUnfortunately, Apple’s encryption technology appears to be a major concern for film companies. Movie distributors think that because Apple’s iTunes has encryption, users could abuse this early access, record the films and leak them online while they are still being shown in movie houses. \nPutting the encryption issue aside, studios are considering this deal since it would mean a $25 to $50 fee for every rental of still showing films. MacRumors says this is not bad at all, knowing that the rental fee wouldn’t be as expensive or more expensive than a movie theater ticket. \nSince no deal has been reached as of late, the standard rule between streaming platforms and film studious stands. Major movie releases are still not going to be available on iTunes and other platforms until 90 days after they are shown in cinemas. However, it is worth noting that even movie companies themselves are looking for a new platform that could facilitate quick distributions of films to households.

      "text": "The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday overturned a $399 million patent infringement penalty imposed on Samsung for copying Apple's iPhone design, in a case watched for its implications for technology innovation.\nThe shorthanded justices ruled 8-0 that Samsung should not be required to forfeit the entire profits from its smartphones for infringement on design components, sending the case back to a lower court.\nWhile the ruling was short on specifics, analysts said it was likely to curb litigation from patent holders expecting to reap big profits from infringement on a component.\nA jubilant Samsung hailed the \"victory for Samsung and for all those who promote creativity, innovation and fair competition in the marketplace.\"\nThe 11-page ruling found that the $399 million penalty -- one element of a major patent infringement case -- was inappropriate because it represented \"Samsung's entire profit from the sale of its infringing smartphones\" for copying the iPhone's \"rectangular front face with rounded edges and a grid of colorful icons on a black screen.\"\nBut the court stopped short of delving into details of how the lower court should determine the penalty.\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in the opinion that \"doing so would require us to set out a test for identifying the relevant article of manufacture... and to parse the record to apply that test in this case.\"\nThe court sent the case back to the appellate court in Washington to resolve the details.\nThe case is one element of the $548 million penalty -- knocked down from an original $1 billion jury award -- Samsung was ordered to pay for copying iPhone patents.\n- No clarity -\nObservers had been watching to see how the court -- which had not taken up a design patent case in more than a century -- would tip the balance between technological innovation and protecting intellectual property.\nDennis Crouch, a University of Missouri law professor and co-director of the Center for Intellectual Property and Entrepreneurship, said the ruling may leave both sides disappointed.\n\"Although the case offers hope for Samsung and others adjudged of infringing design patents, it offers no clarity as to the rule of law,\" Crouch said in a blog post.\nCrouch said the court allowed for damages at the component level but also indicated that the product as a whole is \"an article of manufacture,\" leaving the matter open to interpretation.\n\"Thus, it will be up to courts to figure out which level (of damages) applies in particular cases,\" he wrote.\nSamsung won the backing of major Silicon Valley and other IT sector giants, including Google, Facebook, Dell and Hewlett-Packard, claiming a strict ruling on design infringement could lead to a surge in litigation.\nApple was supported by big names in fashion and manufacturing. Design professionals, researchers and academics, citing precedents like Coca-Cola's iconic soda bottle.\nReacting to the verdict, an Apple spokesman said in an email, \"Our case has always been about Samsung's blatant copying of our ideas, and that was never in dispute... We remain optimistic that the lower courts will again send a powerful signal that stealing isn't right.\"\nSamsung did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n- 'Sigh of relief' -\nFlorian Mueller, an intellectual property analyst who writes a closely followed patent blog, wrote that \"large parts of the (U.S. and global) tech industry will breathe a sigh of relief now,\" even if the case is not settled.\nEd Black, president of the Computer & Communications Industry Association, which represents major tech firms, welcomed the ruling.\n\"This was a pivotal court case for the technology industry and it is encouraging to see the law interpreted and applied in a way that makes sense in a modern era and protects both inventors and innovation,\" Black said.\nThe lower court's interpretation of design patents, Black said, \"would have had a chilling effect on investment and the development of products -- especially in the tech sector.\"\nBrian Love, a law professor who follows technology at the University of Santa Clara, said it was noteworthy that the top court declined to provide detailed guidance on how to resolve the damage award.\n\"The district court may well end up allowing the entire amount to stand, but it seems more likely that the award will be substantially reduced,\" Love said.\nStill, Love said it may dissuade companies from launching new lawsuits on design patents.\n\"Interest in design patents spiked following Apple's first jury verdict in 2012,\" he said.\n\"Companies suddenly saw design patent rights as a potential gold mine. Now, it seems likely that assertion of design patents will return to being a rare occurrence.\"",

      "text": "By Shuli Ren With all that cash made in China, Apple (AAPL) is branching out from taxi-hailing services to green energy developments there.\nXinjiang Goldwind Science & Technology ( 2208.Hong Kong ), the world’s largest wind power turbine maker, soared 7.2% today after announcing a joint venture with Apple on wind power developments in China. In a filing, Xinjiang disclosed:\nBeijing Tianrun agrees to transfer to Apple 30% of the equity in each of the following subsidiaries (“Target Project Companies”): Nanyang Runtang New Energy Co., Ltd. in Henan Province; Zibo Runchuan New Energy Co., Ltd. in Shandong Province; Shuozhou Pinglu Sineng Wind Power Co., Ltd. in Shanxi Province; and Qiaojia Tianqiao Wind Power Co., Ltd. in Yunnan Province.\nHowever, this deal is not large enough to “trigger any disclosure obligation of the Company under Chapter 14 of the Listing Rules.” So the 7% bump is the Apple premium.\n“This will be the first cooperation between Apple and the Group. This anticipated cooperation will help further the Group’s goal of actively promoting a green supply chain,” said Goldwind.",

Apple is Talking With Movie Studios About Providing Early iTunes Movie Rentals We could soon see movies available through iTunes just two weeks after hitting theaters by Brent Dirks December 7, 2016 \nAnyone using an Apple device could eventually rent a movie through iTunes just two weeks after the title hit theaters. News of the possible early iTunes movie rentals was first broken in a new report from Bloomberg . A big change A big change \nUsually, movie theaters have exclusive rights to a title up to three months after first being released. Here’s more from the report: \n21st Century Fox Inc., Time Warner Inc.’s Warner Bros. and Comcast Corp.’s Universal Pictures all confirmed over the past week that they are looking to offer high-priced, home-video rentals of new movies shortly after they open in theaters. Some studio executives have been pushing to allow home rentals as early as two weeks after theatrical debuts and are considering a deal with iTunes as one option, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the discussions are private. \nThe most recent talks are part of longer-running efforts by Cupertino, California-based Apple to get new movies sooner, two of the people said. Such an arrangement could help iTunes stand out in a crowded online market for movies, TV shows and music. While the iTunes store helped Apple build a dominant role in music retailing, the company hasn’t carved out a similar role in music and video streaming. \nA big catch seems to be price. The early rentals could be priced anywhere from $25 to $50. That’s a big jump from the usual $19.99 cost to purchase premium iTunes movies and less than $5 to rent. \nAccording to the report, another big issue seems to be security: \nOne of the concerns about iTunes is whether it will be a secure platform for delivering movies that are still in theaters, the people said. While Apple encrypts iTunes video files so they can’t easily be duplicated, it’s possible to use a camera to record a movie playing on a TV screen. A leak of picture that’s still in theaters would jeopardize returns for the studios and cinema owners. \nEven with the high price, early iTunes movie rentals could really help jump start devices like the Apple TV. With two younger children at home, my wife and I rarely go to the movie theater any more, but something like this early rental option definitely sounds intriguing. View Comments",

      "text": "0 An Apple logo hangs above the entrance to the Apple store on 5th Avenue in the Manhattan borough of New York City, U.S., December 5, 2016. Reuters/Brendan McDermid \nIt seems that flaming smartphones have become a norm these past few months. Following the Samsung Note 7 debacle, Apple has had its share of supposedly exploding iPhones, albeit to a lesser degree. But now that new reports have surfaced claiming that the world’s most popular mobile phone is gradually becoming combustible, it doesn’t look good at all for the Cupertino-based company. \nA government-own consumer watchdog in China said that it has received eight separate reports from iPhone owners claiming that their Apple handsets burst into flames. In its defence, the tech giant pointed out that the said iPhone units’ “external physical damage” caused the combustion. Apple made it clear that its smartphones are safe to use and that the issue is not a safety concern. \nREAD: Apple says iPhone 6s unexpected shutdowns are 'normal,' iPhone only protecting itself \nThe tech giant said that it was done looking into the cause of the exploding iPhones. Apple concluded that the handsets had gone through “thermal events” due to the “external physical damage” inflicted on them. The company insists that the issue will never be as catastrophic as the Samsung Note 7 fiasco. \n“The units we've analysed so far have clearly shown that external physical damage happened to them, which led to the thermal event,” said Apple in a statement as quoted by Yahoo . “We treat safety as a top priority and have found no cause for concern with these products.” \nREAD: Samsung Galaxy Note 7 Australian owners forced to surrender potentially exploding handsets \nApple also refuted claims that it was unable to act quickly on the situation following the consumer watchdogs’ push for the company to attend to its customer’s complaints. The council’s report stated that a female iPhone 6s Plus owner badly damaged her phone’s display screen after it exploded. It also left the back portion of the phone and its battery totally blackened. \nThe council claimed that it had received a six-fold increase in Apple-related complaints in the past couple of months. The complaints include the exploding iPhones and the unexpected shutdowns of certain iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s handsets that have recently plagued a number of Apple users worldwide.",

      "text": "Ron Perillo / 1 min ago \nLooks like Samsung is following Apple’s move with the removal of the 3.5mm headphone jack in their upcoming Samsung Galaxy S8 smartphone. The new device will use USB Type-C connector instead to facilitate the headphone connectivity function in the form of adapters. After taking a ton of criticism for the design, Apple’s self proclaimed “courageous” move might not be too crazy after all. Several companies and Chinese OEM’s such as LeEco and HTC have ditched the port already but Samsung is a giant company so this move will have far reaching influence in the Android smartphone world. There are other great forces at work as well to push the 3.5mm headphone jack out of the way in favor of USB Type-C , such as Intel who has been campaigning for a move away from analog audio. \nThe recurring rationale is that ditching the now decades old 3.5mm headphone jack will free up real-estate on the unit and allow for a greater screen area while producing a thinner device. With the outrage subsiding, Apple’s solution is to focus on pushing Bluetooth products for a hands-free wire-free connection. The official announcement of Bluetooth 5 specifications showing significant bandwidth and signal performance, this move might not have been premature after all. Samsung is no stranger to courting controversy in feature removal as they have ditched removable batteries when the Galaxy S6 was released and it seems everyone is fine with that idea now. \nWithout the 3.5mm jack, analysts also suggest that Samsung intends to integrate stereo speakers. This is a plausible move considering Samsung recently acquired HARMAN a few weeks ago for $8.0 billion. Harman International Industries allows Samsung to be a player in the audio arena and allows for greater device integration considering HARMAN’s experience in the automotive market. HARMAN also owns several leading audio brands such as JBL, Harman Kardon, AKG and more so a fully integrated wireless Bluetooth ecosystem might be in the cards.",

      "text": "Apple blames external damage for flaming China iPhones AFP on December 7, 2016, 5:04 pm Apple blames external damage for flaming China iPhones Share Apple blames external damage for flaming China iPhones - Yahoo New Zealand Shanghai (AFP) - Apple has blamed \"external physical damage\" for causing a handful of iPhones to explode or catch fire in China and insisted that its handsets posed no safety problem. \nFresh on the heels of Samsung's worldwide Galaxy Note 7 safety fiasco, a Shanghai consumer watchdog said last Friday it had received eight recent reports of iPhones that spontaneously combusted while being used or charged. \nIn a statement to AFP late Tuesday, the US tech giant said it had retrieved units for analysis and conducted thorough tests on phones which had experienced \"thermal events\", but brushed off safety concerns. \n\"The units we?ve analysed so far have clearly shown that external physical damage happened to them which led to the thermal event,\" the statement said. \n\"We treat safety as a top priority and have found no cause for concern with these products.\" \nThe company also denied being slow to respond, after the state-run Shanghai Consumer Council had urged it to address consumer complaints. \nThe watchdog's report quoted one woman as saying her iPhone 6s Plus exploded in August, shattering the screen and leaving the battery and back of the phone blackened. \nThe council said it had received a sixfold surge in total complaints against Apple in the past two months, including sudden shutdowns of the iPhone 6 and 6s even though batteries still had enough power. \nThe council did not say where the complaining iPhone users were located. \nApple last month offered to change iPhone 6s batteries for Chinese users who complained of the sudden shutdowns, but said the problem did not constitute a safety issue. \nSamsung suffered a severe blow over its Galaxy Note 7's woes, recalling some 2.5 million units after reports of the product catching fire.",

Share Apple has confirmed it is developing driverless car systems Share Get daily updates directly to your inbox + Subscribe Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nApple has confirmed it is developing a driverless car. Read More \nRumours about the technology giant's move into the automobile space have been doing the rounds for the last couple of years, and the company finally confirmed the news in a letter to the American highways regulator Read More The driverless car era could be well dull! \n\"The company is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation,\" said the letter, which comes from Apple's director of product integrity Steve Kenner. \nApple already has an office in Cambridge thanks to its purchase of speech recognition start-up VocalIQ last year, but it is thought staff there are working on Siri, so probably won't be involved in helping get the \"iCar\" on the road. \nBut Apple could consider calling on the expertise of FiveAI, a start-up which is taking a machine learning approach to autonomous vehicles. Its Artificial Intelligence-based system features multiple cameras around the vehicle, supplemented by other sensing technologies, such as radar, ultrasound, LIDAR (light radar), inertial measurement units, GPS and audio. It could be ready for trials by 2019. Read More Five cool Cambridge start-ups based at Eagle Labs \nElsewhere in the city, Professor John Miles, from the Cambridge University engineering department, has played a leading role in the UK Autodrive consortium, which has been involved in trials of Lutz Pathfinder driverless pods on the streets of Milton Keynes. \nSpeaking to the News last year, he said: \"My feeling is that it’s Milton Keynes today, but why not Cambridge tomorrow? \n“Milton Keynes is a great place to trial because it has a lot of big shopping areas with big spaces for vehicles and pedestrians – it’s like a big playground. \n“You don’t want to start with the most complicated areas, but once we’ve found out what the pods can do the natural thing is to take them to somewhere like Cambridge.” \nIf Apple agrees, perhaps we'll see the iCar rolling along King's Parade some time in the near future.

While some of us may’ve been a little skeptical of his casting initially, it’s hard to imagine anyone else in the role after seeing previews like this. \nThe trailer begins with narrator Lemony Snicket (played by Patrick Warburton) warning that the new Netflix show is no delightful watch. Then the focus turns to Olaf and his mission to steal the children’s fortune, left to them by their parents after their untimely deaths: \nThe Unfortunate Events trailer also presents new looks at colorful characters including Uncle Monty (Aasif Mandvi, below), Aunt Josephine (Alfre Woodard, below), and Justice Strauss (Joan Cusack). \nA Series of Unfortunate Events premieres all eight episodes of its first season on January 13, 2017. \n“Based on the internationally best-selling series of books by Lemony Snicket (aka Daniel Handler) and starring Emmy and Tony Award winner Neil Patrick Harris, A Series of Unfortunate Events recounts the tragic tale of the Baudelaire orphans — Violet, Klaus, and Sunny – whose evil guardian Count Olaf will stop at nothing to get his hands on their inheritance. The siblings must outsmart Olaf at every turn, foiling his many devious plans and disguises, in order to discover clues to their parents’ mysterious death.” \nAnother trailer was released two weeks ago — you can watch it here . Is ‘Unfortunate Events’ looking as good as you hoped? \nHarris previously confirmed that each book will be adapted into two episodes of the show. The first season of ASOUE covers the first four books, so presumably season 2 will roughly cover another four books. There are a total of 13 books in Lemony Snicket’s series.",

      "title": "U.S. Supreme Court backs Samsung in smartphone fight with Apple",
      "text": "By Andrew Chung (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday sided with Samsung in its big-money smartphone patent fight with Apple, throwing out an appeals court ruling that the South Korean company had to pay a $399 million penalty to its American rival for copying key iPhone designs.\nThe 8-0 ruling, written by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, held that a patent violator does not always have to fork over its entire profits from the sales of products using stolen designs, if the designs covered only certain components and not the whole thing.\nThe justices sent the case back to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington to determine how much Samsung must pay. But they did not provide a road map to juries and lower courts on how to navigate similar disputes in the future.\nApple spokesman Josh Rosenstock said in a statement that the U.S. company remained \"optimistic that the lower courts will again send a powerful signal that stealing isn't right.\"\nSamsung told Reuters in a statement the ruling was a \"victory for Samsung and for all those who promote creativity, innovation and fair competition in the marketplace.\"\nFollowing a 2012 jury verdict favoring Apple, Samsung initially was hit with nearly $930 million in penalties, later cut by $382 million, for infringing Apple's iPhone patents and mimicking its distinctive appearance in making the Galaxy and other competing devices.\nSamsung in December 2015 paid its Cupertino, California-based rival $548 million. But Samsung took the matter to the Supreme Court, saying it should not have had to make $399 million of that payout for copying the patented designs of the iPhone's rounded-corner front face, bezel and colorful grid of icons that represent programs and applications.\nWith the products that used iPhone designs, Samsung went on to become the world's top smartphone maker.\nTuesday's ruling followed a ferocious legal battle between the world's top two smartphone manufacturers that began in 2011 when Apple sued Samsung for patent and trademark infringement. It was one of the most closely watched patent cases to come before the top U.S. court in recent years.\nThe legal dispute centered on whether the term \"article of manufacture,\" on which design patent damages are calculated in U.S. patent law, should be interpreted as a finished product in its entirety, or merely a component in a complex product.\nIn court papers, Samsung, Apple and the U.S. government all agreed that the term could mean a component.\nBut Apple urged the Supreme Court to affirm the appeals court's ruling because Samsung presented no evidence that the article of manufacture in this case was anything less than its entire smartphone as sold. Samsung, meanwhile, said that it did not have to present such evidence.\nSotomayor, writing for the unanimous court, said that the law is clear. The term \"article of manufacture is broad enough to encompass both a product sold to a consumer as well as a component of that product,\" she wrote.\nPERIOD OF UNCERTAINTY\nThe justices nevertheless refused to devise a test for juries and lower courts to use to discern what a relevant article of manufacture is in a particular case, a task that could be fraught with difficulty when considering high-tech products.\n\"No doubt whether with Apple-Samsung, or some other design patent case, we are going to have a period of uncertainty where courts will be trying to formulate a test and what the boundaries are,\" Richard McKenna, an expert in design rights at the law firm Foley & Lardner in Milwaukee, said in an interview.\nIn court papers, Apple said its iPhone's success was tied to innovative designs, which other manufacturers quickly adopted in their own products. Samsung, in particular, made a deliberate decision to copy the iPhone's look and many user interface features, Apple said.\nSamsung argued that it should not have had to turn over all its profits, saying that design elements contributed only marginally to a complex product with thousands of patented features.\nDesign patent fights very rarely reach the Supreme Court. It had not heard such a case in more than 120 years.\nThe case is Samsung Electronics Co, Ltd v. Apple Inc, in the Supreme Court of the United States, No. 15-777.\n(Reporting by Andrew Chung in New York; additional reporting by Lawrence Hurley in Washington and Se Young Lee in Seoul; Editing by Will Dunham and Stephen Coates)",

The changelist for the seventh Beta of iOS 10 is basically the same as the changelist for the previous two versions of the update. One possibility as to why Apple has decided to gift us with numerous versions of the update might have to do with diagnostic tests that are being run to help Apple learn more about the battery issue that afflicts some units of the Apple iPhone 6s . The company announced the other day that before it sends out an update to fix the problem, it would release an update to help it gather more information about the issue.Certain iPhone 6s models produced during a specific period are going from 30% battery life to 0% as quickly as the snap of a finger. Plugging the phone in returns the battery life to 30%. Besides moving toward a software update to fix this problem, owners of iPhone 6s units with certain serial numbers are being given a free battery replacement by Apple.The iOS 10.2 update is expected to include the latest emoji from Unicode, additional effects for iMessage, and more. We could see iOS 10.2 launched as soon as next week. In the meantime, if you're a registered developer or have signed up with the public beta program, you can download and install iOS 10.2 beta 7 by going to Settings > General > Software Update .",

      "title": "Hon Hai: Biggest Winner From Apple’s “Strong” iPhone 8 Cycle, Says JP Morgan - Asia Stocks to Watch - Barrons.com",
      "text": "By Shuli Ren Apple ‘s (AAPL) assembler Hon Hai Precision Industry ( 2317.Taiwan ), or Foxconn, rose for the third day amid heavy buying after analysts grew bullish on Apple’s iPhone 8 product cycle. JP Morgan upgraded this stock to Buy with 100 new Taiwan dollars price target. \nJP Morgan thinks Apple will do a lot better with iPhone 8. Analyst Gokul Hariharan wrote:\nAfter two years of lackluster demand, we foresee a strong iPhone 8 cycle, driven by: 1) a new form factor (5.85.8″) with OLED screen; 2) a move to glass casing for all iPhone models –the first new industrial design since iPhone 6; 3) likely price drop for the 4.7″ iPhone.\nApple will continue the trend of building larger phones. For instance, the 5’5″ iPhone Plus model is 40% of the total product mix in the iPhone 7 product cycle, up from 30% in the iPhone 6S product cycle. The bank thinks the 5’8″ OLED phone will be 45% of the iPhone 8 product cycle. “We believe the high-end 5.8″ OLED and lower-end 4.7″ models will do quite well and account for 90% of demand, while the middle-of-road 5.5″ LCD model could see very muted demand,” wrote the bank.\nAnd this is good news for Foxconn because Foxconn has been losing its market share to Pegatron (4938.Taiwan) in the small 4’7″ models but its presence in the large-screen segment remains strong. (See chart)\nApple’s iPhone assembler Hon Hai has been losing market share in the small-screen segment but its presence in large-screen remains strong. JP Morgan As such, JP Morgan thinks Foxconn will see revenue recovery in 2017, growing by 12%, after 7% slump this year. On valuation, JP Morgan wrote:\nOur Dec-17 PT of NT$100 is based on an FY18E P/E 11x, which is higher than Hon Hai’s mid-cycle P/E multiple. We believe Hon Hai should trade closer to the high end of the P/E range, given the better profit outlook and reviving growth momentum thanks to what we believe to be its favorable position in the strong iPhone 8 cycle.\nThe bank’s price target implies another 18% upside.",

      "text": "Top Chrome extensions for content marketers December   \nApple’s “There’s an app for that” tag line became a buzzworthy slogan for the iPhone set years ago. It begs the question: Where’s Google’s catchphrase for Chrome extensions? \nContent marketing professionals who spend their days staring at glowing screens have a number of invaluable tools at their disposal thanks to Chrome extensions. No matter your objective, there’s likely an extension to help you achieve it. \nWhile Google doesn’t hold a monopoly on browser extensions, data shows Chrome is the preferred browser among the vast majority of internet users (73 percent), according to W3Schools. With that in mind, we’ll focus on the extensions provided by this browser that can help modern content marketers rock their careers. OneTab \nThe genius behind OneTab is in its simplicity. Every content marketer eventually faces this conundrum: You’re crafting killer copy when suddenly your computer begins to shudder to a stop. What’s the problem? Well, it turns out having a million tabs open at once is taking its toll on your machine. \nRun the OneTab extension to sort all open tabs into a list. You can either restore tabs individually or all together. This way you save memory and precious processing speed without losing important reference materials. Save to Pocket \nSpeaking of reference materials, finding excellent supporting sources is essential to creating authoritative content . However, arranging all this information can turn messy quic kly, especially if yo u need to save it for a later date. \nSave to Pocket makes saving everything simple. You can save articles, videos and more with one click, syncing the links to your preferred device to be viewed later at any time, internet connection or no. This also makes it easy to save non-work-related reads for breaks so you can stay focused on the task at hand. MozBar \nAs a content marketer, you need to be aware of how each and every web page you create stacks up in terms of search engine optimization. At the same time, you need to be able to quickly determine the authority of websites you link out to. \nWith MozBar, you can quickly scan SEO metrics for any web page, including your own. Examine on-page elements, preview schema markup and measure how difficult it will be to rank for a specific keyword all from a single Google Chrome extension. \nSimilar Chrome Extensions: Page Analytics “You need to be able to quickly determine the authority of websites you link out to.” Buffer \nSuccessful content marketing and social media strategies go hand in hand. After all, excellent content needs to be shared and promoted to better capture clicks. Unfortunately, constantly publishing updates to Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and other social platforms can be a laborious, time-consuming task. \nBuffer streamlines the process by allowing you to queue up social posts with a single click from any website. You can also count on detailed analytics regarding everything from likes and shares to retweets and mentions. \nSimilar Chrome extensions: Hootsuite Pablo \nThe team at Buffer understands content isn’t all about text, especially where social media is concerned. That’s why they created Pablo, which makes producing images specifically tailored for different social platforms a breeze. \nYou can quickly and easily change image sizes, typography, fonts, colors and more. Simply open images or text in Pablo and get to editing. Check My Links \nCreating online content means working with links – lots of them. Incorporating authoritative links in your own content boosts your SEO and demonstrates trustworthiness to website visitors. However, broken links have the exact opposite effect. \nWith Check My Links, you can ensure all links on a web page are functioning properly. If any are broken, you can quickly replace them and avoid getting dinged by Google or providing a less-than-stellar experience to site visitors. Boomerang \nMore often than not, content marketing is a team effort, with much of the collaboration happening over email. While modern technology makes it easy for team members to work together from all around the world, pesky details like time differences can get in the way. \nBoomerang allows you to schedule email messages to be sent at specific times, making it easy to manage content marketing projects even when dealing with team members who may be hard at work while you’re fast asleep. Additionally, you can postpone receiving emails until certain times to ensure you don’t lose track of important communications that may get lost in an overflowing inbox. \nSimilar Chrome extensions: Just Not Sorry , Right Inbox \nWhile extremely handy, the Google Chrome extensions mentioned above by no means constitute an exhaustive list. Every content marketer will have specific goals in mind, as well as distinct challenges to overcome. These are a great start to making you more productive, and it’s worth doing some digging to see what other tools Chrome offers to give your content marketing a boost.
