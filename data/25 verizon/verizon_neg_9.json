      "text": "FCC: AT&T, Verizon shouldn't exempt own apps from data caps December 2, 2016 by Tali Arbel In this Oct. 17, 2012, photo, an AT&T logo is displayed on an AT&T Wireless retail store front, in Philadelphia. U.S. regulators are calling out AT&T and Verizon for exempting their own video apps from data caps on customers' cellphones. The Federal Communications Commission sent letters to the country's biggest wireless carriers Thursday, Dec. 1, 2016, saying the way they handle the practice, known as \"zero rating,\" can hurt competition and consumers. The agency had warned AT&T in November and said Friday, Dec. 2 that AT&T's response did not ease its concerns.

The agency had warned AT&T in November and said in its Thursday letter that AT&T's response did not ease its concerns. \nOther services—say Hulu or Netflix—can pay Verizon and AT&T so that consumers could also use those apps without eating up cellphone data. The FCC says that could harm the market for streaming services as it makes it more expensive for internet companies to compete with video services that are owned by the carriers. \nAT&T said Friday that exempting things like its new DirecTV Now online TV app from data caps saves customers money, and the FCC shouldn't put a stop to that. Verizon said its practices are good for consumers and comply with regulations. \nThe warnings come in the final days of the FCC under the Obama administration, which has enacted regulations intended to prevent cable companies from playing favorites with internet services. In this July 25, 2016 file photo signage is seen in a Verizon store, in North Andover, Mass. U.S. regulators are calling out Verizon and AT&T for exempting their own video apps from data caps on customers' cellphones.

(AP Photo/Elise Amendola, File) \nBut the agency leaders appointed by Donald Trump, the incoming president, along with a Republican-controlled Congress, are expected to roll back or enforce more leniently such measures. \nThe FCC still has to make a final finding on whether the zero-rating practices of AT&T and Verizon are a problem. The companies could appeal that.",

The Federal Communications Commission sent letters to the country's biggest wireless carriers Thursday saying the way they handle the practice, known as \"zero rating,\" can hurt competition and consumers. The agency had warned AT&T in November and said in its Thursday letter that AT&T's response did not ease its concerns. Other services — say Hulu or Netflix — can pay Verizon and AT&T so that consumers could also use those apps without eating up cellphone data. The FCC says that could harm the market for streaming services as it makes it more expensive for internet companies to compete with video services that are owned by the carriers. AT&T said Friday that exempting things like its new DirecTV Now online TV app from data caps saves customers money, and the FCC shouldn't put a stop to that. Verizon said its practices are good for consumers and comply with regulations. The warnings come in the final days of the FCC under the Obama administration, which has enacted regulations intended to prevent cable companies from playing favorites with internet services. But the agency leaders appointed by Donald Trump , the incoming president, along with a Republican-controlled Congress, are expected to roll back or enforce more leniently such measures. The FCC still has to make a final finding on whether the zero-rating practices of AT&T and Verizon are a problem. The companies could appeal that. Today's Deals",

The agency had warned AT&T in November and said in its Thursday letter that AT&T's response did not ease its concerns. \nOther services - say Hulu or Netflix - can pay Verizon and AT&T so that consumers could also use those apps without eating up cellphone data. The FCC says that could harm the market for streaming services as it makes it more expensive for internet companies to compete with video services that are owned by the carriers. \nAT&T said Friday that exempting things like its new DirecTV Now online TV app from data caps saves customers money, and the FCC shouldn't put a stop to that. Verizon said its practices are good for consumers and comply with regulations. \nThe warnings come in the final days of the FCC under the Obama administration, which has enacted regulations intended to prevent cable companies from playing favorites with internet services. \nBut the agency leaders appointed by Donald Trump, the incoming president, along with a Republican-controlled Congress, are expected to roll back or enforce more leniently such measures. \nThe FCC still has to make a final finding on whether the zero-rating practices of AT&T and Verizon are a problem.

      "title": "FCC Raises Fresh Concerns Over 'Zero-Rating' by AT&T, Verizon",
      "text": "By Thomas Gryta\nFederal regulators raised new concerns about AT&T Inc.'s practice of excluding its new DirecTV Now streaming service from data charges and, for the first time, lobbed similar questions at Verizon Communications Inc.\nIn a pair of letters sent Thursday, the Federal Communications Commission warned that so called zero-rating, which makes the data used by certain video services free for the carriers' wireless customers, could harm competition and consumers.\nThe agency argues the practice could deter consumers from accessing mobile-video services not affiliated with the carriers, such as those from Netflix Inc. or Hulu, which is co-owned by Walt Disney Co., Comcast Corp., 21st Century Fox and Time Warner Inc.\n21st Century Fox and News Corp, parent company of The Wall Street Journal, share common ownership.\nBoth AT&T and Verizon responded Friday that the practice complies with existing rules and benefits consumers.\n\"We will provide the FCC with additional information on why the government should not take away a service that saves consumers money,\" AT&T said Friday.\nThe FCC's letters come on the heels of the launch of DirecTV Now this week and after Republican congressional leaders last month asked the agency to stop taking controversial regulatory actions until the new presidential administration is on board.\nThe FCC first raised its concerns with AT&T last month, the day after the presidential election. AT&T responded with a detailed defense that hasn't satisfied the regulator.\nJon Wilkins, the head of the FCC's wireless division, in Thursday's letter wrote that the agency has \"reached the preliminary conclusion that these practices inhibit competition, harm consumers, and interfere with the 'virtuous cycle' needed to assure the continuing benefits of the open internet.\"\nThe FCC's letter to Verizon notes that the carrier's actions have \"the potential to hinder competition and harm consumers.\" Verizon excludes data charges to its wireless customers for its National Football League games or its go90 mobile-video app.\n\"We remain quite confident that our practices are good for consumers, non-discriminatory and are consistent with current rules,\" Verizon said Friday.\nThe agency requested both companies respond by Dec. 15, including a list of detailed questions for AT&T.\nAT&T says other video providers can also pay to cover data costs for their customers at the same rates as its DirecTV subsidiary. Verizon offers a similar program.\nThe FCC estimates that an outside video provider would have to pay AT&T $16 a month for each customer who used 10 minutes of streaming video a day, rising to $47 a month for a customer using 30 minutes a day.\n\"That would make it very difficult, if not infeasible, to offer a competitively priced service,\" the letter states.\nThe Dallas telecom firm, which agreed to buy Time Warner Inc. for $85.4 billion in October, began zero-rating its DirecTV video app in September as well as its new DirecTV Now over-the-top service.\n--Ryan Knutson Thomas Gryta at thomas.gryta@wsj.com\nCorrections & Amplifications\nThis item was corrected at 11:35 a.m. ET to show that Hulu is co-owned by Walt Disney Co., Comcast Corp., 21st Century Fox and Time Warner Inc., not solely Disney and 21st Century Fox.\n 02, 2016 11:32 ET (16:32 ",

U.S. regulators are calling out AT&T and Verizon for exempting their own video apps from data caps on customers’ cellphones. The Federal Communications Commission sent letters to the country’s biggest wireless carriers Thursday, Dec. 1, 2016, saying the way they handle the practice, known as “zero rating,” can hurt competition and consumers. The agency had warned AT&T in November and said Friday, Dec. 2 that AT&T’s response did not ease its concerns. (AP Photo/Matt Rourke, File) \nNEW YORK (AP) — U.S. regulators are calling out AT&T and Verizon for exempting their own video apps from data caps on customers’ cellphones. \nThe Federal Communications Commission sent letters to the country’s biggest wireless carriers Thursday saying the way they handle the practice, known as “zero rating,” can hurt competition and consumers. The agency had warned AT&T in November and said in its Thursday letter that AT&T’s response did not ease its concerns. \nOther services — say Hulu or Netflix — can pay Verizon and AT&T so that consumers could also use those apps without eating up cellphone data. The FCC says that could harm the market for streaming services as it makes it more expensive for internet companies to compete with video services that are owned by the carriers. \nAT&T said Friday that exempting things like its new DirecTV Now online TV app from data caps saves customers money, and the FCC shouldn’t put a stop to that. Verizon said its practices are good for consumers and comply with regulations. \nThe warnings come in the final days of the FCC under the Obama administration, which has enacted regulations intended to prevent cable companies from playing favorites with internet services. \nBut the agency leaders appointed by Donald Trump, the incoming president, along with a Republican-controlled Congress, are expected to roll back or enforce more leniently such measures. \nThe FCC still has to make a final finding on whether the zero-rating practices of AT&T and Verizon are a problem. The companies could appeal that.",

(AP Photo/Elise Amendola, File) By TALI ARBEL The Associated Press NEW YORK — \nU.S. regulators are calling out AT&T and Verizon for exempting their own video apps from data caps on customers' cellphones. \nThe Federal Communications Commission sent letters to the country's biggest wireless carriers Thursday saying the way they handle the practice, known as \"zero rating,\" can hurt competition and consumers. The agency had warned AT&T in November and said in its Thursday letter that AT&T's response did not ease its concerns. \nOther services — say Hulu or Netflix — can pay Verizon and AT&T so that consumers could also use those apps without eating up cellphone data. The FCC says that could harm the market for streaming services as it makes it more expensive for internet companies to compete with video services that are owned by the carriers. \nAT&T said Friday that exempting things like its new DirecTV Now online TV app from data caps saves customers money, and the FCC shouldn't put a stop to that. Verizon said its practices are good for consumers and comply with regulations. \nThe warnings come in the final days of the FCC under the Obama administration, which has enacted regulations intended to prevent cable companies from playing favorites with internet services. \nBut the agency leaders appointed by Donald Trump , the incoming president, along with a Republican-controlled Congress, are expected to roll back or enforce more leniently such measures. \nThe FCC still has to make a final finding on whether the zero-rating practices of AT&T and Verizon are a problem. The companies could appeal that. Copyright The Associated Press \nThere are no comments yet. Be the first to post your thoughts. Sign in or register .",

      "text": "NEW YORK (AP) -- U.S. regulators are calling out AT&T and Verizon for exempting their own video apps from data caps on customers&apos; cellphones.\nThe Federal Communications Commission sent letters to the country&apos;s biggest wireless carriers Thursday saying the way they handle the practice, known as \"zero rating,\" can hurt competition and consumers. The agency had warned AT&T in November and said in its Thursday letter that AT&T&apos;s response did not ease its concerns.\nOther services - say Hulu or Netflix - can pay Verizon and AT&T so that consumers could also use those apps without eating up cellphone data. The FCC says that could harm the market for streaming services as it makes it more expensive for internet companies to compete with video services that are owned by the carriers.\nAT&T said Friday that exempting things like its new DirecTV Now online TV app from data caps saves customers money, and the FCC shouldn&apos;t put a stop to that. Verizon said its practices are good for consumers and comply with regulations.\nThe warnings come in the final days of the FCC under the Obama administration, which has enacted regulations intended to prevent cable companies from playing favorites with internet services.\nBut the agency leaders appointed by Donald Trump, the incoming president, along with a Republican-controlled Congress, are expected to roll back or enforce more leniently such measures.\nThe FCC still has to make a final finding on whether the zero-rating practices of AT&T and Verizon are a problem. The companies could appeal that.\n ",

CNET Read More \nSpecifically, the regulators said \"zero rating\" can hurt competition and competitors. In the letter obtained by the Associated Press, regulators make the case that other services could pay Verizon and AT&T to not eat into customers' cell data. This could be bad for competing video services who aren't in favor with the carriers, the FCC argues. \nAT&T launched DirecTV Now earlier this week. AT&T Mobility customers can stream video data over LTE without impacting their data allowance. Verizon offers something similar with its go90 service. \nAT&T and Verizon don't see any wrongdoing. In a statement Friday, AT&T said exempting services like DirecTV Now from data caps saves customers money. Verizon said its practices are good for consumers and comply with regulations. \n\"We will provide the FCC with additional information on why the government should not take away a service that saves consumers money,\" AT&T wrote in a statement Friday. \nThe FCC hasn't released any official ruling on \"zero rating,\" just guidance. It said on Thursday a similar letter was sent to AT&T in November, but the FCC didn't like AT&T's original response.",

      "text": "Dec 2, 2016 12:49pm FCC headquarters \nFCC Chairman Tom Wheeler isn’t throwing in the towel over zero-rated wireless data quite yet. \nThe Commission sent letters to both Verizon and AT&T warning the carriers that their policies for zero-rated content could harm competition and consumers, The Wall Street Journal reported this morning. The model enables users to consume specific types of video and other content on mobile devices without incurring wireless data charges. \nAT&T zero-rates data for its wireless customers through DirecTV Now, the OTT video offering it launched this week . Verizon does the same with Go90 , an OTT video service targeted primarily at millennials. \nZero-rated services have come under fire from net neutrality proponents who claim they allow deep-pocketed media companies to pay for access to mobile subscribers, giving them an unfair advantage over smaller players. The model is becoming increasingly controversial as wireless carriers expand into digital media, giving them an opportunity to push their own content over that of third parties. \nBackers of zero-rated offerings say the model enables consumers to access content and services they might not otherwise be able to afford. The FCC has said it continues to review such offerings, but the Commission has yet to intervene in a significant way. \nIndeed, the Commission’s letter to Verizon claims the company’s policies regarding zero-rated content have “the potential to hinder competition and harm consumers,” according to the Journal. The FCC also wrote that such policies “interfere with the ‘virtuous cycle’ needed to assure the continuing benefits of the open internet.” \nThe FCC included “a list of detailed questions for AT&T,” the Journal reported, and asked both of the nation’s largest carriers to respond by Dec. 15. \nIt seems increasingly unlikely that the FCC will take a heavy-handed approach to zero-rated data policies, however. Net neutrality has been a top priority with Wheeler at the helm of the FCC, where Democrats have outnumbered Republicans 3-2. That edge will almost surely disappear once President-elect Donald Trump moves into the White House, however, and Wheeler is replaced as chair. \nIndeed, all three of Trump’s advisers on his FCC landing team have vocally opposed net neutrality rules, saying they’re unnecessarily burdensome on service providers. Mark Jamison, a former Sprint lobbyist on Trump’s FCC transition team, wrote in June that net neutrality “is backfiring” and should be dropped. “This means letting the industry make business decisions and regulating only when monopolies take over,” he wrote.

      "text": "In two letters sent to AT&T and Verizon yesterday, the FCC writes that sponsored data plans from the telecom giants are a threat to net neutrality. \nFCC writes that the programs harm competition Both companies have recently instituted similar plans. Under the programs, customers can use select services without having them contribute to a data cap — a practice known as zero rating. In AT&T’s case , the FCC writes that, despite protests from the company, its sponsored data program “strongly favors AT&T's own video offerings” while damaging the opportunity for other video services to compete.\n“We have therefore reached the preliminary conclusion that these practices inhibit competition, harm consumers, and interfere with the ‘virtuous cycle’ needed to assure the continuing benefits of the Open Internet,” FCC wireless bureau chief Jon Wilkins writes in the letter, which requests a response from the company by December 15th.\nThe Verizon letter similarly questions the company’s \"FreeBee Data 360\" program, which, the FCC writes, has largely benefited Go90 — an affiliated mobile video service from Verizon.\n\"We will review and respond to the inquiry as requested,” a Verizon spokesperson said in a statement. “In the meantime, we remain quite confident that our practices are good for consumers, non-discriminatory and are consistent with current rules.\" \nThe agency says Verizon’s program has largely benefited Go90 Net neutrality advocates have long been wary of zero-rating plans, which may set a dangerous precedent for how data is managed, with carriers favoring some services over others. But last year, when the agency voted to reclassify the internet , it said allowing zero rating would not necessarily harm competition. The agency left the door open, however, to intervene in cases where it does. The letters suggest the FCC is still willing to fight those battles, although with a new administration on the horizon , the agency’s time to fight with its current staff is waning.",

      "text": "FCC: AT&T, Verizon shouldn't exempt own apps from data caps   2:24 PM Dec 2, 2016 at 5:55 PM Tali Arbel,   \nNEW YORK (AP) \" U.S. regulators are calling out AT&T and Verizon for exempting their own video apps from data caps on customers' cellphones. \nThe Federal Communications Commission sent letters to the country's biggest wireless carriers Thursday saying the way they handle the practice, known as \"zero rating,\" can hurt competition and consumers. The agency had warned AT&T in November and said in its Thursday letter that AT&T's response did not ease its concerns. \nOther services \" say Hulu or Netflix \" can pay Verizon and AT&T so that consumers could also use those apps without eating up cellphone data. The FCC says that could harm the market for streaming services as it makes it more expensive for internet companies to compete with video services that are owned by the carriers. \nAT&T said Friday that exempting things like its new DirecTV Now online TV app from data caps saves customers money, and the FCC shouldn't put a stop to that. Verizon said its practices are good for consumers and comply with regulations. \nThe warnings come in the final days of the FCC under the Obama administration, which has enacted regulations intended to prevent cable companies from playing favorites with internet services. \nBut the agency leaders appointed by Donald Trump, the incoming president, along with a Republican-controlled Congress, are expected to roll back or enforce more leniently such measures. \nThe FCC still has to make a final finding on whether the zero-rating practices of AT&T and Verizon are a problem. The companies could appeal that. About Us",

The Federal Communications Commission sent letters to the country's biggest wireless carriers Thursday saying the way they handle the practice, known as \"zero rating,\" can hurt competition and consumers. The agency had warned AT&T in November and said in its Thursday letter that AT&T's response did not ease its concerns. Other services — say Hulu or Netflix — can pay Verizon and AT&T so that consumers could also use those apps without eating up cellphone data. The FCC says that could harm the market for streaming services as it makes it more expensive for internet companies to compete with video services that are owned by the carriers. AT&T said Friday that exempting things like its new DirecTV Now online TV app from data caps saves customers money, and the FCC shouldn't put a stop to that. Verizon said its practices are good for consumers and comply with regulations. The warnings come in the final days of the FCC under the Obama administration, which has enacted regulations intended to prevent cable companies from playing favorites with internet services. But the agency leaders appointed by Donald Trump , the incoming president, along with a Republican-controlled Congress, are expected to roll back or enforce more leniently such measures. The FCC still has to make a final finding on whether the zero-rating practices of AT&T and Verizon are a problem. The companies could appeal that. Latest News Video",

      "text": "This week AT&T announced that it would give special treatment to DirecTV’s new streaming service by excluding it from AT&T customers’ wireless data caps. Ever since we started writing about net neutrality, we’ve argued that zero rating is a bad, anti-competitive idea that in the long run will hurt consumers, though it may appear like a huge consumer benefit in the short-term. Now we know the FCC seems to agree, based on letters it sent today to Verizon and AT&T about their zero rating and sponsored data programs. \nYou can read more about those letters here , but I want to focus on an example in one paragraph from the FCC’s letter to AT&T that really highlights how zero rating and sponsored data are intended to be used together to shake down competitors.\nUsing the reference example from your white paper stating that your Sponsored Data rates are similar to the discounted wholesale rates paid by major wireless resellers, we estimate for purposes of illustrating our concerns that an unaffiliated mobile video service provider would have to pay AT&T $16 a month to offer zero-rated service to a customer who uses just 10 minutes of LTE video per day, increasing to $47 for a customer using 30 minutes per day. These costs alone would represent 46 percent to 134 percent of DIRECTV Now's $35 retail price, against which third parties will be competing for AT&T Mobility customers, and would be borne in addition to all other costs of providing service by the unaffiliated provider. As consumers increasingly use mobile video services - a process which the practice of zero-rating mobile video usage will accelerate - these Sponsored Data charges could reasonably be expected to increase even more. By contrast, AT&T incurs no comparable cost to offer its own DIRECTV Now service on a zero-rated basis. If we understand these facts correctly, AT&T seems to present the unaffiliated provider with a choice that is unreasonable on its face: either pay a Sponsored Data rate (resulting in a $16-$47 per month - or higher - incremental cash cost not incurred by AT&T) that would make it very difficult, if not infeasible, to offer a competitively-priced service, or instead require its customers to pay significant amounts for their own usage of data while AT&T's zero-rated DIRECTV Now service offers customers the same usage for free. \nThe FCC explains in footnotes that this is a relatively conservative estimate. And there’s every reason to believe ISPs will charge as much as they can get away with. Just look at Netflix’s noisy war with Comcast , and then imagine a future where every content company not owned by an ISP has to negotiate like this individually. It would be insane. \nIt would also hurt consumers, who are already paying for access to the content they ask their ISPs to retrieve. Sponsored data is nothing but an attempt to partition the internet into additional fee-collecting zones. \nThere’s no reason to think these types of arrangements will end with AT&T and DirecTV. AT&T is currently in the process of buying Time Warner, and could do the same thing with HBO. If there’s one reliable and well-documented trend in media we’ve seen over the past half-century it’s massive consolidation — just six companies own about 90-percent of the media business in the US: News Corp, Disney, Viacom, CBS, Time Warner, and Comcast. If AT&T buys Time Warner two of the companies on that list will represent huge conglomerates that own both the transport layer and the content that travels over it, giving them lots of power to strong-arm competitors. (Again: see Comcast vs. Netflix.) \nAT&T just declared war on the open internet (and us) \nWhy wireless carriers want the internet to look more like a cable TV package Read More If the one-two punch of zero rating and sponsored data is any indication of how ISPs will behave in a deregulated internet environment, then there’s no reason to believe killing net neutrality will increase competition in the market. Vertically integrated ISPs that have monopoly power over the network will also gain editorial power over the world’s information. \nThe internet is a great thing. It would be a shame if we let AT&T and Verizon partition it because they want to be as powerful as the old cable television monopolies.",

Verizon said its practices are good for consumers and comply with regulations.\nThe warnings come in the final days of the FCC under the Obama administration, which has enacted regulations intended to prevent cable companies from playing favourites with internet services.\nBut the agency leaders appointed by Donald Trump, the incoming president, along with a Republican-controlled Congress, are expected to roll back or enforce more leniently such measures.\nThe FCC still has to make a final finding on whether the zero-rating practices of AT&T and Verizon are a problem. The companies could appeal that.\nTali Arbel, The Associated Press",

      "text": "0 \nVerizon this week launched a new tablet that may be aimed at kids, but could be a good device for anyone. \nThe Verizon GizmoTab has a removable bumper to help protect it from drops, and it includes lots of kid-friendly software. That includes a home screen that features colorful islands and up to 300 premium educational apps. \nVerizon has also includes a Parent Dashboard so that you can keep track of a kid’s usage, measure their progress, and select the apps that children can access. The Parent Dashboard also lets you control your child’s profiles and passwords. \nWhen it comes to raw specs, Verizon’s GizmoTab runs Android 6.0.1 on an 8-inch 1920x1200 display. It’s powered by an octa-core Snapdragon 617 processor, 3GB of RAM, and a 5,100mAh battery. There’s an 8-megapixel camera on the GizmoTab’s rear and a 5-megapixel snapper on its front, and included is 16GB of built-in storage as well as a microSD slot for adding more storage if you need it. \nThe GizmoTab is now available from Verizon , both online and in stores. Pricing is set at $79.99 with a two-year contract or $0 down and 24 monthly payments of $10.41. You can also pay $249.99 full retail if you’d prefer to avoid any kind of commitment. \nOne other detail worth noting is that, for a limited time, GizmoTab buyers will receive a gift card for Toys R Us, Barnes & Noble, or The Gap. Pairing your new GizmoTab with a GizmoPal 2 or GizmoGadget will give you $100 gift card. Source:",

      "title": "Why the FCC Is Blasting Verizon and AT&T Over Net Neutrality",
      "text": "Federal regulators said Verizon and AT&T appear to be violating net neutrality rules by favoring their own streaming video services. But the incoming Trump administration isn’t likely to pursue the case.\nVerizon allows its mobile customers to watch as much video as they’d like from its Go90 and NFL football apps without counting against their monthly data allowances. AT&T does the same for its DirecTV satellite customers using an accompanying app as well as customers of its new DirecTV Now service.\nIn dual letters dated December 1, the Federal Communications Commission, which adopted the net neutrality rules last year, said both carriers are hurting competition with the data exclusion strategies, also known as zero rating. The net neutrality rules, adopted last February and upheld in court in June, are intended to prevent Internet service providers from discriminating against any online content or services.\nHowever, the incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump appears hostile towards the net neutrality rules, which are also strongly opposed by Republicans in Congress. All three of Trump’s transition team members overseeing the FCC have spoken out against the net neutrality rules.\nAnd on Friday, one of the two current Republican members of the FCC, Ajit Pai, blasted the new letters and the agency’s chairman, Tom Wheeler, appointed by President Obama. Republicans will get a majority of the five-member commission after Trump takes office, and Republicans in Congress have already warned Wheeler not to enact any controversial new policies in the meantime.\n“Last night, Chairman Wheeler launched yet another broadside against free data for consumers, notwithstanding the objections of Republican commissioners,” Pai said in a statement. “This end-run around Congress’s clear instruction is sad-and pointless.”\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter. \nVerizon vz said it would respond to the letter, which requested an explanation by December 15. “We will review and respond to the inquiry as requested,” a spokesman said. “In the meantime, we remain quite confident that our practices are good for consumers, non-discriminatory and are consistent with current rules.”\nThe FCC had warned AT&T in a November 9 letter about its concerns over the zero rating strategy. In the new letter, the agency said AT&T’s defense of zero rating was unconvincing.\nAT&T t said it allows any other video service to give customers unlimited data as long as the service then picks up the tab for the data usage (Verizon does the same). But while AT&T has no cash cost for zero rating its customers because it owns the video service and the mobile network, competitors would face huge costs, the FCC said. For each customer who watched just 30 minutes of video a day, a video service provider would have to pay AT&T an estimated $47 per person per month.\nThose terms make it “very difficult, if not infeasible, to offer a competitively-priced service,” the FCC wrote.",

      "text": "Getty/Alex Wong \nThe Federal Communications Commission sent separate letters to AT&T and Verizon on Thursday further expressing concerns over the carriers’ use of data cap exemptions, a practice more colloquially known as “zero-rating.”\nThe letter to AT&T comes as the latest part of a back-and-forth the Commission has had with the company over the past month.\nThe FCC in November said it had “ serious concerns ” with AT&T’s use of zero-rating, particularly with regard to its new DirecTV Now streaming TV service , which users of AT&T’s mobile service can stream over mobile data without it counting against their data caps.\nAT&T responded shortly thereafter, saying its data exemption policy benefits consumers, and nothing about the fact the FCC has no hard-and-fast rules in place regarding the practice.\nThat response didn’t allay the FCC’s worries. In the letter (via Ars Technica ), Jon Wilkins, the FCC’s wireless and telecoms chief, says the Commission has now “reached the preliminary conclusion that these practices inhibit competition, harm consumers, and interfere with the ‘virtuous cycle’ needed to assure the continuing benefits of the Open Internet.”\nThe letter says the FCC’s primary concern is with how AT&T’s Sponsored Data program requires companies to pay AT&T for the ability to not count against a user’s data cap, while its own services, such as DirecTV Now, receive the same benefits at no added cost.\nGetty/Alex Wong AT&T has repeatedly defended this charge by saying that DirecTV does pay the same rates as any other company in the Sponsored Data program, but since AT&T owns DirecTV, the FCC isn’t buying it.\nThe agency estimates that a third-party video service would have to pay $16 per month to offer zero-rated service to someone who streams 10 minutes of video over LTE data per day, and $47 per month for someone who streams LTE video for 30 minutes per day. DirecTV Now, meanwhile, starts at $35 per month.\n“If we understand these facts correctly,” Wilkins says, “AT&T seems to present the unaffiliated provider with a choice that is unreasonable on its face: either pay a Sponsored Data rate (resulting in a $16-$47 per month — or higher — incremental cash cost not incurred by AT&T) that would make it very difficult, if not infeasible, to offer a competitively-priced service, or instead require its customers to pay significant amounts for their own usage of data while AT&T’s zero-rated DirecTV Now service offers the same usage for free.”\nWilkins concludes the letter by asking AT&T to issue another response by December 15.\nGetty/Alex Wong Wilkins’ letter to Verizon, meanwhile, concerns the carrier’s “FreeBee Data 360” sponsored data program, which functions in much the same way: A company must pay Verizon for the ability to be zero-rated, even while Verizon grants its own video apps, specifically Go90 , the same benefit at no added cost.\n“The position that the participation of Go90 in FreeBee Data 360 is the same as that of third parties, however, fails to take account of the notably different financial impact on unaffiliated edge providers,” Wilkins says.\n“For example, while there is no cash cost on a consolidated basis for Verizon to zero-rate its own affiliated edge service, an unaffiliated edge provider's FreeBee Data 360 payment to Verizon is a true cash cost that could be significant.”\nWilkins again asks that Verizon respond by December 15.\nResponding to the letter, an AT&T spokesman said in a statement: \"These are incredibly popular free services available to millions of customers. Once again, we will provide the FCC with additional information on why the government should not take away a service that saves consumers money.”\nVerizon did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but defended its policies and said it would comply with the FCC’s requests, according to The Wall Street Journal .\nGetty/Alex Wong Zero-rating has been the big gray area in the open internet debate for the past two years, since the net neutrality rules the FCC passed in 2015 do not give any specific judgment on sponsored data programs. Wilkins even notes in the Verizon letter that the FCC’s concern is “not with zero-rating per se .”\nRival carrier T-Mobile has been the most aggressive practitioner over the years, for instance, but hasn’t faced as much scrutiny because it does not make companies pay to be zero-rated — and thus leverage its position as a network provider for potential profit.\nInstead, the FCC says it judges each instance of zero-rating on a case-by-case basis. In AT&T and Verizon’s cases, the current Commission has problems, but all signs suggest those fears might be too little, too late .\nPresident-elect Trump has hired three staunch opponents of the current FCC’s pro-regulation tendencies to help determine his transition team’s FCC-related policy, and Trump himself has been largely anti-regulation during his campaign. While any attempt to walk back the current net neutrality rules may face strong resistance, the zero-rating concerns expressed here may have trouble gaining momentum as the next administration takes office.\nNOW WATCH: The ‘Apple of China’ just unveiled a phone that’s more powerful and better looking than the iPhone \n",

      "text": "FCC: AT&T, Verizon shouldn't exempt own apps from data caps  24 PM Dec 2, 2016 at 5:55 PM Tali Arbel,   \nNEW YORK (AP) \" U.S. regulators are calling out AT&T and Verizon for exempting their own video apps from data caps on customers' cellphones. \nThe Federal Communications Commission sent letters to the country's biggest wireless carriers Thursday saying the way they handle the practice, known as \"zero rating,\" can hurt competition and consumers. The agency had warned AT&T in November and said in its Thursday letter that AT&T's response did not ease its concerns. \nOther services \" say Hulu or Netflix \" can pay Verizon and AT&T so that consumers could also use those apps without eating up cellphone data. The FCC says that could harm the market for streaming services as it makes it more expensive for internet companies to compete with video services that are owned by the carriers. \nAT&T said Friday that exempting things like its new DirecTV Now online TV app from data caps saves customers money, and the FCC shouldn't put a stop to that. Verizon said its practices are good for consumers and comply with regulations. \nThe warnings come in the final days of the FCC under the Obama administration, which has enacted regulations intended to prevent cable companies from playing favorites with internet services. \nBut the agency leaders appointed by Donald Trump, the incoming president, along with a Republican-controlled Congress, are expected to roll back or enforce more leniently such measures. \nThe FCC still has to make a final finding on whether the zero-rating practices of AT&T and Verizon are a problem. The companies could appeal that. About Us",

      "text": "print AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson (left). Getty/Alex Wong \nThe Federal Communications Commission sent separate letters to AT&T and Verizon on Thursday further expressing concerns over the carriers’ use of data cap exemptions, a practice more colloquially known as “zero-rating.” \nThe letter to AT&T comes as the latest part of a back-and-forth the Commission has had with the company over the past month. \nThe FCC in November said it had “ serious concerns ” with AT&T’s use of zero-rating, particularly with regard to its new DirecTV Now streaming TV service , which users of AT&T’s mobile service can stream over mobile data without it counting against their data caps. \nAT&T responded shortly thereafter, saying its data exemption policy benefits consumers, and nothing about the fact the FCC has no hard-and-fast rules in place regarding the practice. \nThat response didn’t allay the FCC’s worries. In the letter (via Ars Technica ), Jon Wilkins, the FCC’s wireless and telecoms chief, says the Commission has now “reached the preliminary conclusion that these practices inhibit competition, harm consumers, and interfere with the ‘virtuous cycle’ needed to assure the continuing benefits of the Open Internet.” \nThe letter says the FCC’s primary concern is with how AT&T’s Sponsored Data program requires companies to pay AT&T for the ability to not count against a user’s data cap, while its own services, such as DirecTV Now, receive the same benefits at no added cost. \nDirecTV Now. AT&T AT&T has repeatedly defended this charge by saying that DirecTV does pay the same rates as any other company in the Sponsored Data program, but since AT&T owns DirecTV, the FCC isn’t buying it.\nThe agency estimates that a third-party video service would have to pay $16 per month to offer zero-rated service to someone who streams 10 minutes of video over LTE data per day, and $47 per month for someone who streams LTE video for 30 minutes per day. DirecTV Now, meanwhile, starts at $35 per month. \n“If we understand these facts correctly,” Wilkins says, “AT&T seems to present the unaffiliated provider with a choice that is unreasonable on its face: either pay a Sponsored Data rate (resulting in a $16-$47 per month — or higher — incremental cash cost not incurred by AT&T) that would make it very difficult, if not infeasible, to offer a competitively-priced service, or instead require its customers to pay significant amounts for their own usage of data while AT&T’s zero-rated DirecTV Now service offers the same usage for free.” \nWilkins concludes the letter by asking AT&T to issue another response by December 15. \nFCC Chairman Tom Wheeler. Alex Wong/Getty Images Wilkins’ letter to Verizon, meanwhile, concerns the carrier’s “FreeBee Data 360” sponsored data program, which functions in much the same way: A company must pay Verizon for the ability to be zero-rated, even while Verizon grants its own video apps, specifically Go90 , the same benefit at no added cost.\n“The position that the participation of Go90 in FreeBee Data 360 is the same as that of third parties, however, fails to take account of the notably different financial impact on unaffiliated edge providers,” Wilkins says. \n“For example, while there is no cash cost on a consolidated basis for Verizon to zero-rate its own affiliated edge service, an unaffiliated edge provider's FreeBee Data 360 payment to Verizon is a true cash cost that could be significant.” \nWilkins again asks that Verizon respond by December 15. \nResponding to the letter, an AT&T spokesman said in a statement: \"These are incredibly popular free services available to millions of customers. Once again, we will provide the FCC with additional information on why the government should not take away a service that saves consumers money.” \nVerizon did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but defended its policies and said it would comply with the FCC’s requests, according to The Wall Street Journal . \nThe entrance to a Verizon wireless store is seen in New York Thomson Reuters Zero-rating has been the big gray area in the open internet debate for the past two years, since the net neutrality rules the FCC passed in 2015 do not give any specific judgment on sponsored data programs. Wilkins even notes in the Verizon letter that the FCC’s concern is “not with zero-rating per se .”\nRival carrier T-Mobile has been the most aggressive practitioner over the years, for instance, but hasn’t faced as much scrutiny because it does not make companies pay to be zero-rated — and thus leverage its position as a network provider for potential profit. \nInstead, the FCC says it judges each instance of zero-rating on a case-by-case basis. In AT&T and Verizon’s cases, the current Commission has problems, but all signs suggest those fears might be too little, too late . \nPresident-elect Trump has hired three staunch opponents of the current FCC’s pro-regulation tendencies to help determine his transition team’s FCC-related policy, and Trump himself has been largely anti-regulation during his campaign. While any attempt to walk back the current net neutrality rules may face strong resistance, the zero-rating concerns expressed here may have trouble gaining momentum as the next administration takes office.",

      "text": "FCC Takes Aim at Verizon 'FreeBee' Data Fires second shot at DirecTV Now, AT&T Mobility 12/02/2016 3:02 PM Eastern \nFCC Chairman Tom Wheeler has some parting gifts for AT&T and Verizon: Letters doubling down on the FCC's suggestion that zero rating business plans run afoul of the FCC's Open Internet rules. \n\nRELATED: FCC Takes Aim at DirecTV Now \n\nThe FCC last month fired a warning shot at AT&T's free data services for mobile customers--video services, for example, that don't not count against a customer's data usage--saying the combination of DirecTV Now and AT&T Mobility sponsored data plans \"appears to present significant anti-competitive effects.\" \n\nRELATED: Verizon Launches ‘FreeBee Data’ \n\nAT&T had responded , explaining why that was not the case, but the FCC's Wireless Bureau was not persuaded, and also fired of a first letter to Verizon targeting its free data. \n\n\"We find that those responses fail to alleviate the serious concerns expressed in our November 9 letter regarding the potential anti-competitive impacts of s wholesale Sponsored Data program for zero-rated mobile video services,\" Jon Wilkins, the chief of the wireless Telecommunications Bureau, wrote in a letter to AT&T. \n\n\"I am writing to express concern about the potential impact of Verizon's \"FreeBee Data 360\" sponsored data program on competition for mobile video services,\" Wilkins wrote Verizon. \"Based on public reports as well as information you have orally provided to us, the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau (\"the Bureau\") believes that the FreeBee Data 360 offering to edge providers unaffiliated with Verizon, combined with Verizon' s current practice of zero-rating its affiliated edge services for Verizon subscribers, has the potential to hinder competition and harm consumers. We request that you respond to address this concern by no later than December 15, 2016.\" He wanted a response by Dec. 15. \n\nIn the letter to AT&T, Wilkins did not stop at video. \n\n\"We are also concerned that the impacts of these practices, which could be reasonably expected to be extended to additional edge markets if permitted here, will go beyond video, potentially advantaging AT&T (or any other network owner employing similar practices) and its affiliates in a wide-range of usage-intensive services that rely on cloud-based solutions for businesses or consumers - such as hosted enterprise software or remote data storage - to the detriment of competing services not affiliated with an incumbent network operator,\" He wrote. \n\nWilkins said it was not a blanket criticism of the pricing of DirecTV Now, the online video service that launched this week, \"nor its strategy for competing in the retail video market. Indeed, as an over-the-top (OTT) offering that is available over any Internet service provider's network - including those owned by video market incumbents such as cable operators - DIRECTV Now relies on the safeguards provided by the Open Internet Order's pro-competition rules. Nor do we question bundled retail offerings or vertical integration per se.\" \n\nThen what was the problem? \n\n\"Our concern is that AT&T's Sponsored Data program - i.e., the terms and conditions on which AT&T makes its own network available to similarly situated unaffiliated providers denies unaffiliated third parties the same ability to compete over AT&T's network on reasonable terms,” he wrote. \n\n“These are incredibly popular free services available to millions of customers,\" AT&T said in a statement. \"Once again, we will provide the FCC with additional information on why the government should not take away a service that saves consumers money.” \n\n\"We will review and respond to the inquiry as requested,\" said Verizon spokesman Richard Young. \"In the meantime, we remain quite confident that our practices are good for consumers, non-discriminatory and are consistent with current rules.\" \n\nSenior Republican and possible FCC interim chair Ajit Pai, blasted what he called a \"yet another broadside against free data for consumers.\" \n\nPai reminded Wheeler of Congress' call to ramp down regulatory initiatives during the transition to a Republican Administration, suggesting the Wireless Bureau letter represented NOT doing that. \n\n\"This end-run around Congress’s clear instruction is sad—and pointless,\" he said. \"[A]ny unilateral action taken by the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau at the Chairman’s direction in the next 49 days can quickly be undone by that same bureau after January 20, 2017.\"",

      "text": "on Friday December 02, 2016 @03:40PM from the taking-a-stand dept. U.S. regulators are calling out AT&T and Verizon for exempting their own video apps from data caps on customers' smartphones . The FCC has sent letters to the country's biggest wireless carriers saying the way they handle the practice, known as \"zero rating,\" can hurt competition and consumers. From a report on ZDNet: AT&T launched DirecTV Now earlier this week. AT&T Mobility customers can stream video data over LTE without impacting their data allowance . Verizon offers something similar with its go90 service. AT&T and Verizon don't see any wrongdoing. In a statement Friday, AT&T said exempting services like DirecTV Now from data caps saves customers money. Verizon said its practices are good for consumers and comply with regulations. \"We will provide the FCC with additional information on why the government should not take away a service that saves consumers money,\" AT&T wrote in a statement Friday. The FCC hasn't released any official ruling on \"zero rating,\" just guidance. It said on Thursday a similar letter was sent to AT&T in November, but the FCC didn't like AT&T's original response.",

      "text": "NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. regulators are calling out AT&T and Verizon for exempting their own video apps from data caps on customers' cellphones.\nThis may not result in any changes in how the wireless carriers operate, however, as agency leaders appointed by Donald Trump, the incoming president, are expected to look more favorably on such practices.\nThe Federal Communications Commission sent letters to the country's biggest wireless carriers Thursday saying the way they handle the practice, known as \"zero rating,\" can hurt competition and consumers. The agency had warned AT&T in November and said in its Thursday letter that AT&T's response did not ease its concerns.\nOther services — say Hulu or Netflix — can pay Verizon and AT&T so that consumers could also use those apps without eating up cellphone data. The FCC says that could harm the market for streaming services as it makes it more expensive for internet companies to compete with video services that are owned by the carriers.\nAT&T Inc. said Friday that exempting apps like its new DirecTV Now online TV app from data caps saves customers money, and the FCC shouldn't put a stop to that. Verizon Communications Inc. said its practices are good for consumers and comply with regulations.\nThe warnings come in the final days of the FCC under President Barack Obama's administration, which has enacted regulations intended to prevent cable companies from playing favorites with internet services.\nThe agency under Trump, along with a Republican-controlled Congress, are expected to roll back or enforce more leniently such measures.\nAjit Pai, a Republican commissioner at the FCC who is seen as a candidate to be the next FCC chairman, underscored that point in a statement Friday. He said the FCC's zero-rating warnings were \"yet another broadside against free data for consumers\" and warned that actions taken by the FCC now could be undone by a newly staffed FCC after Trump takes office.\nThe FCC still has to make a final finding on whether the zero-rating practices of AT&T and Verizon are a problem. The companies could appeal that.",

The agency sent letters to AT&T and Verizon Wireless this week calling them out for exempting their own video services (DirecTV Now and go90, respectively) from customers' data caps. The agency believes the practice gives the carriers' own services an advantage over competing services. \"We have therefore reached the preliminary conclusion that these practices inhibit competition, harm consumers, and interfere with the 'virtuous cycle' needed to assure the continuing benefits of the Open Internet,\" wrote FCC wireless bureau chief Jon Wilkins writes in the letter to AT&T. The FCC has already warned carriers that zero-rating content may be harmful. The regulatory body did not say if it intends to take steps or action against the carriers. The companies have until December 15 to respond to the FCC's letters. AT&T announced DirecTV Now earlier this week. The service is available to anyone who cares to pay for it, but only AT&T Mobility customers can watch via LTE without impacting their monthly data cap.",

This may not result in any changes in how the wireless carriers operate, however, as agency leaders appointed by Donald Trump , the incoming president, are expected to look more favorably on such practices. The Federal Communications Commission sent letters to the country's biggest wireless carriers Thursday saying the way they handle the practice, known as \"zero rating,\" can hurt competition and consumers. The agency had warned AT&T in November and said in its Thursday letter that AT&T's response did not ease its concerns. Other services — say Hulu or Netflix — can pay Verizon and AT&T so that consumers could also use those apps without eating up cellphone data. The FCC says that could harm the market for streaming services as it makes it more expensive for internet companies to compete with video services that are owned by the carriers. For example, the FCC estimates that a video service provider would have to pay AT&T $16 a month for a customer who streamed video for 10 minutes a day without using up his data on the cellular network, or $47 a month for a user watching a half-hour a day.

      "text": "FCC accuses AT&T and Verizon of violating net neutrality Deals that keep DirecTV Now and Go90 from counting against your data cap have the government concerned. Save Bloomberg via Getty Images \nThe FCC has a few things to say about AT&T and Verizon's takes on net neutrality. Jon Wilkins, the commission's chief of wireless telecommunication, wrote separate letters to both telcos highlighting concerns about recent zero-rating moves -- when consumed data doesn't count against your monthly allotment. \nIn a letter to AT&T's Robert W. Quinn, Jr., Wilkins said he was concerned that AT&T's Sponsored Data program \"denies unaffiliated third parties the same ability to compete over AT&T's network on reasonable terms.\" The issue here is that AT&T is not offering discounted data rates to outside service providers. Instead, it's giving its newly acquired DirecTV preferential treatment when it comes to how streaming video will affect your monthly data cap. \nUsing the company's own example against it, the FCC said that a video provider would have to pay $16 a month for zero-rated service (when data use doesn't count against your monthly allotment). Should a customer bump up to 30 minutes of use in a day, the provider would have to pay $47. \n\"These costs alone would represent 46 percent to 134 percent of DirecTV Now's $35 retail price,\" Wilkins elaborated. The worry here is that as more people start using more data-hungry mobile services, that it's going to make it harder and harder for third-party providers to compete against the likes of DirecTV, in AT&T's case. \"By contrast, AT&T incurs no comparable cost to offer its own DirecTV Now service on a zero-rated basis,\" Wilkins wrote. \nFurther, Wilkins called out AT&T's misleading evidence that what it's doing is similar to what the FCC has approved prior. \"In each of those cases, however, the validity of the comparisons between rates charged to affiliates and rates charged to third-party competitors were reinforced and accompanied by additional restrictions... No such safeguards are present here.\" Wilkins said that the FCC remains \"very concerned\" of the unfair playing field AT&T is trying to construct here and is worried that this would extend beyond just video providers in the future. AT&T has until December 15th to respond.\nVerizon, on the other hand, is under the microscope for its \"FreeBee Data 360\" offering that gives preferential treatment to providers on the Go90 video platform . The concern there is that this could extend to its FiOS home internet service, and, again, provide an unfair advantage to its home-grown offerings. \n\"While there is no cash cost on a consolidated basis for Verizon to zero-rate its own affiliated edge service, an unaffiliated edge provider's FreeBee Data 360 payment to Verizon is a true cash cost that could be significant,\" Wilkins wrote. \"Unaffiliated edge providers not purchasing FreeBee Data 360 would likewise face a significant competitive disadvantage in trying to serve Verizon's customer base without zero-rating.\" \nPeople will naturally flock toward a service that doesn't go against their data cap because of how Verizon has set up its content deals. Verizon stands to benefit, as customers are likely to choose the cheapest option they can — which will be its own. \"Verizon customers subscribing to Verizon's own zero-rated Go90 services would not encounter these cost or impacts,\" Wilkins wrote. Like AT&T, Verizon has until December 15th to address the FCC's concerns. \nIt's worth noting that T-Mobile has similar deals in place with its \"Binge On\" offering, but since it doesn't own the services, it's less of a conflict of interest. \nWe've reached out to AT&T and Verizon for more information and will update this post should it arrive. \nUpdate: AT&T has responded with the following statement: \n\"These are incredibly popular free services available to millions of customers. Once again, we will provide the FCC with additional information on why the government should not take away a service that saves consumers money.\" \n*Verizon has acquired AOL, Engadget's parent company. However, Engadget maintains full editorial control, and Verizon will have to pry it from our cold, dead hands.",

The FCC warned AT&T in November about so-called zero rating and said this week that AT&T's response did not ease its concerns. (Mark Lennihan / Associated Press) Associated Press \nU.S. regulators are calling out AT&T Inc. and Verizon Communications Inc. for exempting their own video apps from data caps on customers' cellphones. \nThis may not result in any changes in how the wireless carriers operate, however, because agency leaders appointed by President-elect Donald Trump are expected to look more favorably on such practices. \nThe Federal Communications Commission sent letters to the country's biggest wireless carriers Thursday saying the way they handle the practice, known as zero rating, can hurt competition and consumers. The agency had warned AT&T in November and said in its Thursday letter that AT&T's response did not ease its concerns. \nOther services — such as Hulu or Netflix, for example — can pay Verizon and AT&T so that consumers could also use those apps without eating up the limited data allowances on their cellphone plans. The FCC says that could harm the market for streaming services as it makes it more expensive for Internet companies to compete with video services that are owned by the carriers. \nFor example, the FCC estimates that a video service provider would have to pay AT&T $16 a month for a customer who streamed video for 10 minutes a day without using his data on the cellular network, or $47 a month for a user watching half an hour a day. \nAT&T Wireless recently offered its customers a compelling freebie: If they subscribe to DirecTV , the satellite TV service that AT&T acquired in 2015, or DirecTV's new slimmed-down online offering, they can watch an unlimited amount of TV on their mobile devices without using up any of their monthly... \nAT&T Wireless recently offered its customers a compelling freebie: If they subscribe to DirecTV , the satellite TV service that AT&T acquired in 2015, or DirecTV's new slimmed-down online offering, they can watch an unlimited amount of TV on their mobile devices without using up any of their monthly... (The Times Editorial Board) \nAdding in those costs makes it difficult for a rival to compete on price with AT&T's new online TV app, DirecTV Now, whose cheapest bundle costs consumers $35 a month, wrote Jon Wilkins, the head of the FCC's wireless bureau. Competing video providers would also be at a disadvantage if they didn't zero-rate their services at all because consumers could have to pay for more data to watch. \nAT&T said Friday that exempting apps such as DirecTV Now from data caps saves customers money, and that the FCC shouldn't put a stop to that. Verizon Communications Inc. said its practices are good for consumers and comply with regulations. \nVerizon lets wireless customers watch its go90 video app and NFL football, for which it has exclusive mobile rights, without using up data. \nThe warnings come in the final days of the FCC under President Obama's administration, which has enacted regulations intended to prevent cable companies from playing favorites with Internet services. \nThe agency under Trump and a Republican-controlled Congress is expected to roll back or enforce more leniently such measures. \nAjit Pai, a Republican commissioner at the FCC who is seen as a candidate to be the next FCC chairman, underscored that point in a statement Friday. He said the FCC's zero-rating warnings were “yet another broadside against free data for consumers” and warned that actions taken by the FCC now could be undone by a newly staffed FCC after Trump takes office. \nThe FCC still has to make a final finding on whether the zero-rating practices of AT&T and Verizon are a problem. The companies could appeal that finding.

      "text": "FCC: AT&T, Verizon shouldn't exempt own apps from data caps - KFDA - NewsChannel 10 / Amarillo News, Weather, Sports Member Center: FCC: AT&T, Verizon shouldn't exempt own apps from data caps By TALI ARBELAP Technology Writer \nNEW YORK (AP) - U.S. regulators are calling out AT&T and Verizon for exempting their own video apps from data caps on customers' cellphones. \nThis may not result in any changes in how the wireless carriers operate, however, as agency leaders appointed by Donald Trump, the incoming president, are expected to look more favorably on such practices. \nThe Federal Communications Commission sent letters to the country's biggest wireless carriers Thursday saying the way they handle the practice, known as \"zero rating,\" can hurt competition and consumers. The agency had warned AT&T in November and said in its Thursday letter that AT&T's response did not ease its concerns. \nOther services - say Hulu or Netflix - can pay Verizon and AT&T so that consumers could also use those apps without eating up cellphone data. The FCC says that could harm the market for streaming services as it makes it more expensive for internet companies to compete with video services that are owned by the carriers. \nFor example, the FCC estimates that a video service provider would have to pay AT&T $16 a month for a customer who streamed video for 10 minutes a day without using up his data on the cellular network, or $47 a month for a user watching a half-hour a day. \nAdding in those costs makes it difficult for a rival to compete on price with AT&T's new online TV app, DirecTV Now, whose cheapest bundle costs consumers $35 a month, wrote Jon Wilkins, the head of the FCC's wireless bureau. Competing video providers would also be at a disadvantage if they didn't zero-rate their services at all, as consumers could need to pay for more data to watch. \nAT&T Inc. said Friday that exempting apps like DirecTV Now from data caps saves customers money, and the FCC shouldn't put a stop to that. Verizon Communications Inc. said its practices are good for consumers and comply with regulations. \nVerizon lets wireless customers watch its go90 video app and NFL football, for which it has exclusive mobile rights, without using up data. \nThe warnings come in the final days of the FCC under President Barack Obama's administration, which has enacted regulations intended to prevent cable companies from playing favorites with internet services. \nThe agency under Trump and a Republican-controlled Congress are expected to roll back or enforce more leniently such measures. \nAjit Pai, a Republican commissioner at the FCC who is seen as a candidate to be the next FCC chairman, underscored that point in a statement Friday. He said the FCC's zero-rating warnings were \"yet another broadside against free data for consumers\" and warned that actions taken by the FCC now could be undone by a newly staffed FCC after Trump takes office. \nThe FCC still has to make a final finding on whether the zero-rating practices of AT&T and Verizon are a problem. The companies could appeal that.  ",

      "text": "Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends \nIf you thought Verizon and AT&T’s plan to exempt videos streamed via certain services from their customers’ data plans sounded a little unfair, you weren’t the only one. In a sternly worded pair of letters sent to AT&T and Verizon, the Federal Communications Commission accused the carriers of a potential violation of the net neutrality rules it approved in 2015. \nNet neutrality, for the uninitiated, is the principle that broadband providers should treat all content, sites, and platforms equally in terms of traffic. Columbia University law professor Tim Wu, who’s credited with coining the term, compares the idea to an electric grid. “The electric grid does not care if you plug in a toaster, an iron, or a computer … [It’s] a model of a neutral, innovation-driving network.” \nMore: T-Mobile’s latest family plan has net neutrality advocates pissed off \nIn 2015, the FCC reclassified broadband providers as so-called “Title II” common carriers, or services bound to “act in the public interest.” That includes ensuring that they can’t make any “unjust” or “unreasonable” charges, for one, or introduce any regulations that would actively suppress competing services. \nCarriers like AT&T and Verizon have attempted to sidestep those rules with so-called “zero-rating,” or a policy that exempts certain applications and services from counting against subscribers’ data plans. Zero-rated music streaming doesn’t contribute to your overall data bucket, for example, and neither do video services. \nAT&T began zero-rating its DirecTV on-demand and live-streaming mobile app in September and plans to do the same for its forthcoming DirecTV Now streaming service when it launches later in December. Verizon currently waives data charges for National Football League games, its Go90 video platform, and other participants affiliated with its FreeBee Data 360 program. \nMore: Net neutrality advocates feel less than warm toward T-Mobile’s Binge On \nThe FCC’s net neutrality rules do not expressly prohibit zero-rating, but the agency evaluates implementations on a case-by-case basis to determine whether or not they “hinder competition.” It found that AT&T and Verizon’s programs did. “[We have] reached the preliminary conclusion that these practices inhibit competition, harm consumers, and interfere with the ‘virtuous cycle’ needed to assure the continuing benefits of the open internet,” John Wilkins, head of the FCC’s wireless division, wrote in Thursday’s letter. “It would [be] very difficult, if not infeasible, to offer a competitively priced service.” \nAT&T and Verizon beg to differ. \n“We will provide the FCC with additional information on why the government should not take away a service that saves customers money,” AT&T said Friday. A spokesperson for Verizon, meanwhile, said that the carrier “[remains] quite confident that [its] practices are good for consumers, non-discriminatory and are consistent with current rules.” \nBoth carriers contend they provide competitors like Netflix, YouTube, and others a means to the same zero-rated status as their first-party services. AT&T exempts streaming services from subscribers’ data caps on a metered basis, charging roughly $16 a month for each customer who uses 10 minutes of streaming video a day up to $47 a month for customers who use 30 minutes a day. But the FCC argues that the policy’s discriminatory, especially toward smaller startups which might not be able to swallow the cost. \nMore: T-Mobile is giving unlimited data to every customer, but there’s a catch \n“[The program] strongly favors AT&T’s own video offerings while unreasonably discriminating against unaffiliated edge providers and limiting their ability to offer competing video services to AT&T’s broadband subscribers on a level playing field,” Wilkins wrote. \nThe FCC has requested responses from both carriers by December 15. It asked AT&T to provide the average median usage of DirecTV streaming compared to competing services, and the names of companies that have purchased data cap exemptions from AT&T. \nThe FCC first raised concerns about zero-rating in a letter to AT&T in November. The carrier responded, arguing that the practice was to its customers’ benefit. “These initiatives are precisely the kind of pro-consumer challenges to cable that the Commission heralded in approving AT&T’s acquisition of DirecTV,” Robert Quinn, AT&T’s policy chief, wrote in a letter to the agency. \nMore: Who has the best family plan? Shake-ups from T-Mobile and Sprint tilt the balance \nAnother major U.S. carrier, T-Mobile, adopted a policy of zero-rating last year with the launch of Binge On, a video streaming service that exempts approved video and music streaming services from customers’ data caps. Wheeler has characterized the plan as “pro-innovation,”“pro-competition,” and in full compliance with the government’s net neutrality rules, but consumer advocacy groups have voiced concerns about the program’s exclusivity. Content providers must meet certain technical specifications that allow T-Mobile to identify their content as Binge On-friendly, for instance. And Binge One reduces the quality of streaming indiscriminately — even those hosted on services that haven’t opted into T-Mobile’s plan. \nT-Mobile’s new One plan offers data-free video streaming, but at reduced quality. Subscribers can unlock improved definition for $25 a month on top of what they pay for the plan itself, an option that’s raised the ire of net neutrality advocates like the Electronic Frontier Foundation. \nAn FCC spokesperson told Digital Trends in August that the Commission’s policy review was “ongoing.” \nThe future of the FCC’s net neutrality policy is unclear. Roslyn Layton, Jeffrey Eisenach, and Mark Jamison, advisors that will oversee the FCC’s transition under president-elect Donald Trump’s administration, are outspoken opponents of the FCC’s Title II rules, and have argued that government regulations are not necessary to protect net neutrality. A Republican-led Commission, which Trump will have the power to appoint when he takes office on January 20, could choose to overturn the current rules entirely. Also watch:",

      "text": "Up Next Play me a story: How video game storytelling has evolved Photo by FCC \nThe Federal Communications Commission is not cool with AT&T's offer that lets customers stream the carrier's DirecTV service without it counting against their data plans. The commission has also launched an investigation into a similar offer from Verizon. \nIn a letter sent to AT&T on Thursday, the agency said it's reached a preliminary conclusion that the carrier is violating net neutrality rules, which prohibit internet service providers from favoring their own content over a competitor's service. \nSince September, AT&T has let its wireless customers stream its DirecTV video service over the AT&T wireless network without counting that data against their monthly data caps. This week AT&T made its $35 a month DirecTV Now streaming service available to all wireless customers . The FCC also sent a letter to Verizon asking it questions about a similar offer where Verizon lets customers stream its Go90 video service and doesn't charge for data usage. \nBoth AT&T and Verizon say their programs, which charge video providers instead of customers the cost of streaming the data, are open to any video company willing to pay the cost of their customers' data. But the FCC says it's concerned that AT&T and Verizon still have a cost advantage over their competitors, since they provide the streaming service and own the networks. \nIn its letter to AT&T, the FCC says its preliminary conclusion is that the carrier's practices \"inhibit competition, harm consumers, and interfere with the 'virtuous cycle' needed to assure the continuing benefits of the Open Internet.\" \nIt asked AT&T to provide additional information prior to December 15 before it makes a final determination. The agency is still gathering information about Verizon's service. \nAT&T reiterated that the service is a benefit to consumers. \n\"These are incredibly popular free services available to millions of customers,\" the company said in a statement. \"Once again, we will provide the FCC with additional information on why the government should not take away a service that saves consumers money.\" \nVerizon said it's still reviewing the FCC's inquiry, but is \"quite confident that our practices are good for consumers, non-discriminatory and are consistent with current rules.\" \nAT&T's Sponsored Data plan and Verizon's FreeBee offer are considered \"zero-rating\" plans. The controversial plans let Internet service providers not count data usage for certain applications against a customer's monthly cap. Though companies say they benefit consumers by offering reduced pricing on wireless service, critics say the plans give the wireless companies an unfair advantage over competitors and violate the 2015 net neutrality rules designed to protect against this. \nThe FCC didn't specifically outlaw zero-rating in its rules, but it said it would look at such plans on a case-by-case basis. This is the first real test of the rules and marks the first time since the regulations were passed that the FCC has flexed its regulatory muscles in enforcing them. Though the FCC has informally been looking into concerns over zero-rating for more than a year, it officially opened an inquiry into AT&T's practices only a few weeks ago, when it sent a letter to the company asking for more details about how the Sponsored Data program works. \nBut with a new Republican administration set to take office in January, it may be too late for the agency to take any meaningful action. What's the FCC's beef? \nThe biggest problem the FCC has with AT&T's sponsored data plan has to do with how much the carrier is charging other competing streaming services for access to its data network. Because AT&T has priced its new DirecTV Now service so aggressively, the FCC doesn't see how other streaming video companies could possibly compete. \nIn its letter, the FCC said it's done the math and estimates it would cost a company $47 a month per customer to offer 30 minutes of free video-streaming a day on AT&T's wireless service. That's significantly more than the $35 a month AT&T charges customers for its new DirecTV Now streaming service. The FCC says this makes it almost impossible for another company, like a Netflix, Hulu or someone else, to compete. \n\"If we understand these facts correctly, AT&T seems to present the unaffiliated provider with a choice that is unreasonable on its face: either pay a Sponsored Data rate...that would make it very difficult, if not infeasible, to offer a competitively priced service, or instead require its customers to pay significant amounts for their own usage of data while AT&T's zero-rated DirecTV Now service offers customers the same usage for free,\" the letter says. \nThe FCC stopped short of taking action against AT&T and has asked the company for more information about how much it's charging competitors. But it's likely nothing will come of the investigation, since Republicans take over January 20, once President-elect Donald Trump is inaugurated. Trump hasn't said much about net neutrality, but he's indicated he's not a fan of the regulation. He's also appointed several people to his transition team who have opposed the net neutrality rules. \nRepublican FCC Commissioner Ajit Pai was critical of the FCC's actions and called the commission's preliminary determination \"sad and pointless.\" \n\"Any unilateral action taken by the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau at the chairman's direction in the next 49 days can quickly be undone by that same bureau after January 20, 2017,\" Pai added.

      "text": "The Verge ^ | Dec 2, 2016, 2:23pm EST | by Colin Lecher \nPosted on 12/02/2016 4:30:11 PM PST by Swordmaker In two letters sent to AT&T and Verizon yesterday, the FCC writes that sponsored data plans from the telecom giants are a threat to net neutrality. FCC writes that the programs harm competition Both companies have recently instituted similar plans. Under the programs, customers can use select services without having them contribute to a data cap  a practice known as zero rating. In AT&Ts case , the FCC writes that, despite protests from the company, its sponsored data program strongly favors AT&T's own video offerings while damaging the opportunity for other video services to compete. We have therefore reached the preliminary conclusion that these practices inhibit competition, harm consumers, and interfere with the virtuous cycle needed to assure the continuing benefits of the Open Internet, FCC wireless bureau chief Jon Wilkins writes in the letter, which requests a response from the company by December 15th. These are incredibly popular free services available to millions of customers, AT&T said in a statement. Once again, we will provide the FCC with additional information on why the government should not take away a service that saves consumers money. The Verizon letter similarly questions the companys \"FreeBee Data 360\" program, which, the FCC writes, has largely benefited Go90  an affiliated mobile video service from Verizon. \"We will review and respond to the inquiry as requested, a Verizon spokesperson said in a statement. In the meantime, we remain quite confident that our practices are good for consumers, non-discriminatory and are consistent with current rules.\" The agency says Verizons program has largely benefited Go90 Net neutrality advocates have long been wary of zero-rating plans, which may set a dangerous precedent for how data is managed, with carriers favoring some services over others. But last year, when the agency voted to reclassify the internet , it said allowing zero rating would not necessarily harm competition. The agency left the door open, however, to intervene in cases where it does. The letters suggest the FCC is still willing to fight those battles, although with a new administration on the horizon , the agencys time to fight with its current staff is waning. Update, 2:40 PM ET: Includes statements from Verizon and AT&T.",

The Federal Communications Commission sent letters to the country’s biggest wireless carriers Thursday, Dec. 1 saying the way they handle the practice, known as “zero rating,” can hurt competition and consumers. (AP Photo/Elise Amendola, File) \nNEW YORK (AP) — U.S. regulators are calling out AT&T and Verizon for exempting their own video apps from data caps on customers' cellphones. \nThis may not result in any changes in how the wireless carriers operate, however, as agency leaders appointed by Donald Trump, the incoming president, are expected to look more favorably on such practices. \nThe Federal Communications Commission sent letters to the country's biggest wireless carriers Thursday saying the way they handle the practice, known as \"zero rating,\" can hurt competition and consumers. The agency had warned AT&T in November and said in its Thursday letter that AT&T's response did not ease its concerns. \nOther services — say Hulu or Netflix — can pay Verizon and AT&T so that consumers could also use those apps without eating up cellphone data. The FCC says that could harm the market for streaming services as it makes it more expensive for internet companies to compete with video services that are owned by the carriers. \nFor example, the FCC estimates that a video service provider would have to pay AT&T $16 a month for a customer who streamed video for 10 minutes a day without using up his data on the cellular network, or $47 a month for a user watching a half-hour a day. \nAdding in those costs makes it difficult for a rival to compete on price with AT&T's new online TV app, DirecTV Now, whose cheapest bundle costs consumers $35 a month, wrote Jon Wilkins, the head of the FCC's wireless bureau. Competing video providers would also be at a disadvantage if they didn't zero-rate their services at all, as consumers could need to pay for more data to watch. \nAT&T Inc. said Friday that exempting apps like DirecTV Now from data caps saves customers money, and the FCC shouldn't put a stop to that. Verizon Communications Inc. said its practices are good for consumers and comply with regulations. \nVerizon lets wireless customers watch its go90 video app and NFL football, for which it has exclusive mobile rights, without using up data.   \nThe warnings come in the final days of the FCC under President Barack Obama's administration, which has enacted regulations intended to prevent cable companies from playing favorites with internet services. \nThe agency under Trump and a Republican-controlled Congress are expected to roll back or enforce more leniently such measures. \nAjit Pai, a Republican commissioner at the FCC who is seen as a candidate to be the next FCC chairman, underscored that point in a statement Friday. He said the FCC's zero-rating warnings were \"yet another broadside against free data for consumers\" and warned that actions taken by the FCC now could be undone by a newly staffed FCC after Trump takes office. \nThe FCC still has to make a final finding on whether the zero-rating practices of AT&T and Verizon are a problem. The companies could appeal that. Tags",

      "text": "0 \nAT&T and Verizon offer sponsored data programs that lets companies pay so that the carrier customers can use their apps without touching their high-speed data. That may sound great for those customers, but the FCC isn’t thrilled about those offerings. \nThe FCC has sent letters to both AT&T and Verizon concerning their zero-rating services. Specifically, the FCC feels that AT&T and Verizon’s programs strongly favor their own streaming video offerings — DirecTV Now and go90 , respectively — while limiting the ability of other services to compete fairly. \n“We have therefore reached the preliminary conclusion that these practices inhibit competition, harm consumers, and interfere with the ‘virtuous cycle’ needed to assure the continuing benefits of the Open Internet,” the FCC said in its letter to AT&T. A similar letter was sent to Verizon. \nIn its letter to AT&T, the FCC explains that with AT&T’s Sponsored Data program, a video service would have to pay AT&T $16 per month to zero-rate the data used by a customer watching 10 minutes of LTE video per day. AT&T, meanwhile, doesn’t have to pay anything since it owns DirecTV Now. \nHere is AT&T’s response to the FCC’s letter: \n“These are incredibly popular free services available to millions of customers. Once again, we will provide the FCC with additional information on why the government should not take away a service that saves consumers money.” \nAnd Verizon’s response: \n\"We will review and respond to the inquiry as requested. In the meantime, we remain quite confident that our practices are good for consumers, non-discriminatory and are consistent with current rules.\" \nZero-rating services like AT&T’s Sponsored Data and Verizon’s FreeBee Data have been targets of those in favor of net neutrality who believe that all data should be treated equally. Now the FCC is stepping in, but it remains to be seen if anything will actually come of these FCC inquiries. AT&T and Verizon both believe that what they’re doing is good for consumers, and I’m sure that a lot of consumers would say that they like AT&T and Verizon’s zero-rating, so I’m sure that the carriers will fight any accusations of net neutrality violations. \nAT&T and Verizon have until December 15 to respond to the FCC’s letters.

U.S. regulators are calling out AT&T and Verizon for exempting their own video apps from data caps on customers’ cellphones. The Federal Communications Commission sent letters to the country’s biggest wireless carriers Thursday, Dec. 1, 2016, saying the way they handle the practice, known as “zero rating,” can hurt competition and consumers. The agency had warned AT&T in November and said Friday, Dec. 2 that AT&T’s response did not ease its concerns. (AP Photo/Matt Rourke, File) \nNEW YORK (AP) — U.S. regulators are calling out AT&T and Verizon for exempting their own video apps from data caps on customers' cellphones. \nThis may not result in any changes in how the wireless carriers operate, however, as agency leaders appointed by Donald Trump, the incoming president, are expected to look more favorably on such practices. \nThe Federal Communications Commission sent letters to the country's biggest wireless carriers Thursday saying the way they handle the practice, known as \"zero rating,\" can hurt competition and consumers. The agency had warned AT&T in November and said in its Thursday letter that AT&T's response did not ease its concerns. \nOther services — say Hulu or Netflix — can pay Verizon and AT&T so that consumers could also use those apps without eating up cellphone data. The FCC says that could harm the market for streaming services as it makes it more expensive for internet companies to compete with video services that are owned by the carriers. \nFor example, the FCC estimates that a video service provider would have to pay AT&T $16 a month for a customer who streamed video for 10 minutes a day without using up his data on the cellular network, or $47 a month for a user watching a half-hour a day. \nAdding in those costs makes it difficult for a rival to compete on price with AT&T's new online TV app, DirecTV Now, whose cheapest bundle costs consumers $35 a month, wrote Jon Wilkins, the head of the FCC's wireless bureau. Competing video providers would also be at a disadvantage if they didn't zero-rate their services at all, as consumers could need to pay for more data to watch. \nAT&T Inc. said Friday that exempting apps like DirecTV Now from data caps saves customers money, and the FCC shouldn't put a stop to that. Verizon Communications Inc. said its practices are good for consumers and comply with regulations. \nVerizon lets wireless customers watch its go90 video app and NFL football, for which it has exclusive mobile rights, without using up data. \nThe warnings come in the final days of the FCC under President Barack Obama's administration, which has enacted regulations intended to prevent cable companies from playing favorites with internet services. \nThe agency under Trump and a Republican-controlled Congress are expected to roll back or enforce more leniently such measures. \nAjit Pai, a Republican commissioner at the FCC who is seen as a candidate to be the next FCC chairman, underscored that point in a statement Friday. He said the FCC's zero-rating warnings were \"yet another broadside against free data for consumers\" and warned that actions taken by the FCC now could be undone by a newly staffed FCC after Trump takes office. \nThe FCC still has to make a final finding on whether the zero-rating practices of AT&T and Verizon are a problem. The companies could appeal that.",

(AP Photo/Elise Amendola, File) \nNEW YORK (AP) — U.S. regulators are calling out AT&T and Verizon for exempting their own video apps from data caps on customers' cellphones. \nThis may not result in any changes in how the wireless carriers operate, however, as agency leaders appointed by Donald Trump, the incoming president, are expected to look more favorably on such practices. \nThe Federal Communications Commission sent letters to the country's biggest wireless carriers Thursday saying the way they handle the practice, known as \"zero rating,\" can hurt competition and consumers. The agency had warned AT&T in November and said in its Thursday letter that AT&T's response did not ease its concerns. \nOther services — say Hulu or Netflix — can pay Verizon and AT&T so that consumers could also use those apps without eating up cellphone data. The FCC says that could harm the market for streaming services as it makes it more expensive for internet companies to compete with video services that are owned by the carriers. \nFor example, the FCC estimates that a video service provider would have to pay AT&T $16 a month for a customer who streamed video for 10 minutes a day without using up his data on the cellular network, or $47 a month for a user watching a half-hour a day. \nAdding in those costs makes it difficult for a rival to compete on price with AT&T's new online TV app, DirecTV Now, whose cheapest bundle costs consumers $35 a month, wrote Jon Wilkins, the head of the FCC's wireless bureau. Competing video providers would also be at a disadvantage if they didn't zero-rate their services at all, as consumers could need to pay for more data to watch. \nAT&T Inc. said Friday that exempting apps like DirecTV Now from data caps saves customers money, and the FCC shouldn't put a stop to that. Verizon Communications Inc. said its practices are good for consumers and comply with regulations. \nVerizon lets wireless customers watch its go90 video app and NFL football, for which it has exclusive mobile rights, without using up data. \nThe warnings come in the final days of the FCC under President Barack Obama's administration, which has enacted regulations intended to prevent cable companies from playing favorites with internet services. \nThe agency under Trump and a Republican-controlled Congress are expected to roll back or enforce more leniently such measures. \nAjit Pai, a Republican commissioner at the FCC who is seen as a candidate to be the next FCC chairman, underscored that point in a statement Friday. He said the FCC's zero-rating warnings were \"yet another broadside against free data for consumers\" and warned that actions taken by the FCC now could be undone by a newly staffed FCC after Trump takes office. \nThe FCC still has to make a final finding on whether the zero-rating practices of AT&T and Verizon are a problem. The companies could appeal that. Tags",

      "text": "By Thomas Gryta\nFederal regulators raised new concerns about AT&T Inc.'s practice of excluding its new DirecTV Now streaming service from data charges and, for the first time, lobbed similar questions at Verizon Communications Inc.\nIn a pair of letters sent Thursday, the Federal Communications Commission warned that so called zero-rating, which makes the data used by certain video services free for the carriers' wireless customers, could harm competition and consumers.\nThe agency argues the practice could deter consumers from accessing mobile-video services not affiliated with the carriers, such as those from Netflix Inc. or Hulu, which is co-owned by Walt Disney Co., Comcast Corp., 21st Century Fox and Time Warner Inc.\n21st Century Fox and News Corp, parent company of The Wall Street Journal, share common ownership.\nBoth AT&T and Verizon responded Friday that the practice complies with existing rules and benefits consumers.\n\"We will provide the FCC with additional information on why the government should not take away a service that saves consumers money,\" AT&T said Friday.\nThe FCC's letters come on the heels of the launch of DirecTV Now this week and after Republican congressional leaders last month asked the agency to stop taking controversial regulatory actions until the new presidential administration is on board.\nThe FCC first raised its concerns with AT&T last month, the day after the presidential election. AT&T responded with a detailed defense that hasn't satisfied the regulator.\nRepublican FCC commissioner Ajit Pai criticized the move in a statement Friday, highlighting the Congress's call to avoid controversial decisions.\n\"This end-run around Congress's clear instruction is sad -- and pointless,\" he said, noting that any unilateral action \"can quickly be undone\" after the Presidential inauguration on Jan. 20.\nJon Wilkins, the head of the FCC's wireless division, in Thursday's letter wrote that the agency has \"reached the preliminary conclusion that these practices inhibit competition, harm consumers, and interfere with the 'virtuous cycle' needed to assure the continuing benefits of the open internet.\"\nThe FCC's letter to Verizon notes that the carrier's actions have \"the potential to hinder competition and harm consumers.\" Verizon excludes data charges to its wireless customers for its National Football League games or its go90 mobile-video app.\n\"We remain quite confident that our practices are good for consumers, non-discriminatory and are consistent with current rules,\" Verizon said Friday.\nThe agency requested both companies respond by Dec. 15, including a list of detailed questions for AT&T.\nAT&T says other video providers can also pay to cover data costs for their customers at the same rates as its DirecTV subsidiary. Verizon offers a similar program.\nThe FCC estimates that an outside video provider would have to pay AT&T $16 a month for each customer who used 10 minutes of streaming video a day, rising to $47 a month for a customer using 30 minutes a day.\n\"That would make it very difficult, if not infeasible, to offer a competitively priced service,\" the letter states.\nThe Dallas telecom firm, which agreed to buy Time Warner Inc. for $85.4 billion in October, began zero-rating its DirecTV video app in September as well as its new DirecTV Now over-the-top service.\n--Ryan Knutson contributed to this article.\nWrite to Thomas Gryta at thomas.gryta@wsj.com\n 16:53 ET (21:53 ",

The Federal Communications Commission sent letters to the country’s biggest wireless carriers Thursday, Dec. 1 saying the way they handle the practice, known as “zero rating,” can hurt competition and consumers. (AP Photo/Elise Amendola, File) \nNEW YORK (AP) — U.S. regulators are calling out AT&T and Verizon for exempting their own video apps from data caps on customers' cellphones. \nThis may not result in any changes in how the wireless carriers operate, however, as agency leaders appointed by Donald Trump, the incoming president, are expected to look more favorably on such practices. \nThe Federal Communications Commission sent letters to the country's biggest wireless carriers Thursday saying the way they handle the practice, known as \"zero rating,\" can hurt competition and consumers. The agency had warned AT&T in November and said in its Thursday letter that AT&T's response did not ease its concerns. \nOther services — say Hulu or Netflix — can pay Verizon and AT&T so that consumers could also use those apps without eating up cellphone data. The FCC says that could harm the market for streaming services as it makes it more expensive for internet companies to compete with video services that are owned by the carriers. \nFor example, the FCC estimates that a video service provider would have to pay AT&T $16 a month for a customer who streamed video for 10 minutes a day without using up his data on the cellular network, or $47 a month for a user watching a half-hour a day. \nAdding in those costs makes it difficult for a rival to compete on price with AT&T's new online TV app, DirecTV Now, whose cheapest bundle costs consumers $35 a month, wrote Jon Wilkins, the head of the FCC's wireless bureau. Competing video providers would also be at a disadvantage if they didn't zero-rate their services at all, as consumers could need to pay for more data to watch. \nAT&T Inc. said Friday that exempting apps like DirecTV Now from data caps saves customers money, and the FCC shouldn't put a stop to that. Verizon Communications Inc. said its practices are good for consumers and comply with regulations. \nVerizon lets wireless customers watch its go90 video app and NFL football, for which it has exclusive mobile rights, without using up data. \nThe warnings come in the final days of the FCC under President Barack Obama's administration, which has enacted regulations intended to prevent cable companies from playing favorites with internet services. \nThe agency under Trump and a Republican-controlled Congress are expected to roll back or enforce more leniently such measures. \nAjit Pai, a Republican commissioner at the FCC who is seen as a candidate to be the next FCC chairman, underscored that point in a statement Friday. He said the FCC's zero-rating warnings were \"yet another broadside against free data for consumers\" and warned that actions taken by the FCC now could be undone by a newly staffed FCC after Trump takes office. \nThe FCC still has to make a final finding on whether the zero-rating practices of AT&T and Verizon are a problem. The companies could appeal that. Tags",

      "text": "FCC: AT&T, Verizon shouldn't exempt own apps from data caps - Live5News.com | Charleston, SC | News, Weather, Sports Member Center: FCC: AT&T, Verizon shouldn't exempt own apps from data caps By TALI ARBELAP Technology Writer \nNEW YORK (AP) - U.S. regulators are calling out AT&T and Verizon for exempting their own video apps from data caps on customers' cellphones. \nThis may not result in any changes in how the wireless carriers operate, however, as agency leaders appointed by Donald Trump, the incoming president, are expected to look more favorably on such practices. \nThe Federal Communications Commission sent letters to the country's biggest wireless carriers Thursday saying the way they handle the practice, known as \"zero rating,\" can hurt competition and consumers. The agency had warned AT&T in November and said in its Thursday letter that AT&T's response did not ease its concerns. \nOther services - say Hulu or Netflix - can pay Verizon and AT&T so that consumers could also use those apps without eating up cellphone data. The FCC says that could harm the market for streaming services as it makes it more expensive for internet companies to compete with video services that are owned by the carriers. \nFor example, the FCC estimates that a video service provider would have to pay AT&T $16 a month for a customer who streamed video for 10 minutes a day without using up his data on the cellular network, or $47 a month for a user watching a half-hour a day. \nAdding in those costs makes it difficult for a rival to compete on price with AT&T's new online TV app, DirecTV Now, whose cheapest bundle costs consumers $35 a month, wrote Jon Wilkins, the head of the FCC's wireless bureau. Competing video providers would also be at a disadvantage if they didn't zero-rate their services at all, as consumers could need to pay for more data to watch. \nAT&T Inc. said Friday that exempting apps like DirecTV Now from data caps saves customers money, and the FCC shouldn't put a stop to that. Verizon Communications Inc. said its practices are good for consumers and comply with regulations. \nVerizon lets wireless customers watch its go90 video app and NFL football, for which it has exclusive mobile rights, without using up data. \nThe warnings come in the final days of the FCC under President Barack Obama's administration, which has enacted regulations intended to prevent cable companies from playing favorites with internet services. \nThe agency under Trump and a Republican-controlled Congress are expected to roll back or enforce more leniently such measures. \nAjit Pai, a Republican commissioner at the FCC who is seen as a candidate to be the next FCC chairman, underscored that point in a statement Friday. He said the FCC's zero-rating warnings were \"yet another broadside against free data for consumers\" and warned that actions taken by the FCC now could be undone by a newly staffed FCC after Trump takes office. \nThe FCC still has to make a final finding on whether the zero-rating practices of AT&T and Verizon are a problem. The companies could appeal that. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.",

      "text": "Photo by FCC The Federal Communications Commission is not cool with AT&T's offer that lets customers stream the carrier's DirecTV service without it counting against their data plans. The commission has also launched an investigation into a similar offer from Verizon.\nIn a letter sent to AT&T on Thursday, the agency said it's reached a preliminary conclusion that the carrier is violating net neutrality rules, which prohibit internet service providers from favoring their own content over a competitor's service.\nSince September, AT&T has let its wireless customers stream its DirecTV video service over the AT&T wireless network without counting that data against their monthly data caps. This week AT&T made the $35 a month streaming service available to all wireless customers . The FCC also sent a letter to Verizon asking it questions about a similar offer where Verizon lets customers stream its Go90 video service and doesn't charge for data usage.\nBoth AT&T and Verizon say their programs, which charge video providers instead of customers the cost of streaming the data, are open to any video company willing to pay the cost of customer data. But the FCC says it's concerned AT&T and Verizon still have a cost advantage over rivals, since they provide the streaming service and own the networks.\nIn its letter to AT&T, the FCC said its preliminary conclusion is that the carrier's practices \"inhibit competition, harm consumers, and interfere with the 'virtuous cycle' needed to assure the continuing benefits of the Open Internet.\"\nIt asked AT&T to provide additional information prior to December 15 before it makes a final determination. The agency is still gathering information about Verizon's service.\nAT&T reiterated that the service is a benefit to consumers.\n\"These are incredibly popular free services available to millions of customers,\" the company said in a statement. \"Once again, we will provide the FCC with additional information on why the government should not take away a service that saves consumers money.\"\nVerizon said it's still reviewing the FCC's inquiry but is \"quite confident that our practices are good for consumers, non-discriminatory and are consistent with current rules.\"\nAT&T's Sponsored Data plan and Verizon's FreeBee offer are considered \"zero-rating\" plans. The controversial plans let Internet service providers not count data usage for certain applications against a customer's monthly cap. Though companies say the plans benefit consumers by offering reduced pricing on wireless service, critics say they give the wireless companies an unfair advantage over competitors and violate the 2015 net neutrality rules designed to protect against this.\nThe FCC didn't specifically outlaw zero-rating in its rules, but it said it would look at such plans on a case-by-case basis. This is the first real test of the rules and marks the first time since the regulations were passed that the FCC has flexed its regulatory muscles in enforcing them.\nThough the FCC has informally been looking into concerns over zero-rating for more than a year, it officially opened an inquiry into AT&T's practices only a few weeks ago, when it sent a letter to the company asking for more details about how the Sponsored Data program works.\nBut with a new Republican administration set to take office in January, it may be too late for the agency to take any meaningful action.\nWhat's the FCC's beef? The biggest problem the FCC has with AT&T's Sponsored Data plan has to do with how much the carrier is charging rival streaming services for access to its data network. Because AT&T has priced its new DirecTV Now service so aggressively, the FCC doesn't see how other streaming video companies could possibly compete.\nIn its letter, the FCC said it's done the math and estimates it would cost a company, like a Netflix, Hulu or someone else, $47 a month per customer to offer 30 minutes of free video-streaming a day on AT&T's wireless service. That's significantly more than the $35 a month AT&T charges customers for DirecTV Now.\n\"If we understand these facts correctly, AT&T seems to present the unaffiliated provider with a choice that is unreasonable on its face: either pay a Sponsored Data rate...that would make it very difficult, if not infeasible, to offer a competitively priced service, or instead require its customers to pay significant amounts for their own usage of data while AT&T's zero-rated DirecTV Now service offers customers the same usage for free,\" the letter says.\nThe FCC stopped short of taking action against AT&T and has asked the company for more information about how much it's charging competitors. But it's likely nothing will come of the investigation, since Republicans take over January 20, once President-elect Donald Trump is inaugurated. Trump hasn't said much about net neutrality, but he's indicated he's not a fan of the regulations. He's also appointed several people to his transition team who have opposed the net neutrality rules.\nRepublican FCC Commissioner Ajit Pai was critical of the FCC's actions and called the commission's preliminary determination \"sad and pointless.\"\n\"Any unilateral action taken by the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau at the chairman's direction in the next 49 days can quickly be undone by that same bureau after January 20, 2017,\" Pai added.\n ",

      "text": "Get Unlimited Digital Access Your first month is less than a dollar. $0.99 for first 4 weeks Subscribe Now \nNEW YORK — U.S. regulators are calling out AT&T and Verizon for exempting their own video apps from data caps on customers' cellphones. \nThis may not result in any changes in how the wireless carriers operate, however, as agency leaders appointed by Donald Trump, the incoming president, are expected to look more favorably on such practices. \nThe Federal Communications Commission sent letters to the country's biggest wireless carriers Thursday saying the way they handle the practice, known as \"zero rating,\" can hurt competition and consumers. The agency had warned AT&T in November and said in its letter that AT&T's response did not ease its concerns. \nOther services — say Hulu or Netflix — can pay Verizon and AT&T so that consumers could also use those apps without eating up cellphone data. The FCC says that could harm the market for streaming services as it makes it more expensive for internet companies to compete with video services that are owned by the carriers. \nFor example, the FCC estimates that a video service provider would have to pay AT&T $16 a month for a customer who streamed video for 10 minutes a day without using up his data on the cellular network, or $47 a month for a user watching a half-hour a day. \nAdding in those costs makes it difficult for a rival to compete on price with AT&T's new online TV app, DirecTV Now, whose cheapest bundle costs consumers $35 a month, wrote Jon Wilkins, the head of the FCC's wireless bureau. Competing video providers would also be at a disadvantage if they didn't zero-rate their services at all, as consumers could need to pay for more data to watch. \nAT&T Inc. said Friday that exempting apps like DirecTV Now from data caps saves customers money, and the FCC shouldn't put a stop to that. Verizon Communications Inc. said its practices are good for consumers and comply with regulations. \nVerizon lets wireless customers watch its go90 video app and NFL football, for which it has exclusive mobile rights, without using up data. \nThe warnings come in the final days of the FCC under President Barack Obama's administration, which has enacted regulations intended to prevent cable companies from playing favorites with internet services. \nThe agency under Trump and a Republican-controlled Congress are expected to roll back or enforce more leniently such measures. \nAjit Pai, a Republican commissioner at the FCC who is seen as a candidate to be the next FCC chairman, underscored that point in a statement Friday. He said the FCC's zero-rating warnings were \"yet another broadside against free data for consumers\" and warned that actions taken by the FCC now could be undone by a newly staffed FCC after Trump takes office. \nThe FCC still has to make a final finding on whether the zero-rating practices of AT&T and Verizon are a problem. The companies could appeal that. \nTali Arbel,",

The companies could appeal that. Tags",

      "text": "FCC Calls Out AT&T, Verizon For 'Zero Rating' Their Own Video Apps Published by Slashdot on Sat, 03 Dec 2016 U.S. regulators are calling out AT&T and Verizon for exempting their own video apps from data caps on customers' smartphones. The FCC has sent letters to the country's biggest wireless carriers saying the way they handle the practice, known as \"zero rating,\" can hurt competition and consumers. From a report on ZDNet: AT&T launched DirecTV Now earlier this week. AT&T Mobility customers can stream video data over LTE without impacting their data allowance. Verizon offers something similar with its go90 service. AT&T and Verizon don't see any wrongdoing. In a statement Friday, AT&T said exempting services like DirecTV Now from data caps saves customers money. Verizon said its practices are good for consumers and comply with regulations. \"We will provide the FCC with additional information on why the government should not take away a service that saves consumers money,\" AT&T wrote in a statement Friday. The FCC hasn't released any official ruling on \"zero rating,\" just guidance. It said on Thursday a similar letter was sent to AT&T in November, but the FCC didn't like AT&T's original response.

      "title": "FCC Raises Fresh Concerns Over 'Zero-Rating' by AT&T, Verizon -- Update",
      "text": "By Thomas Gryta\nFederal regulators raised new concerns about AT&T Inc.'s practice of excluding its new DirecTV Now streaming service from data charges and, for the first time, lobbed similar questions at Verizon Communications Inc.\nIn a pair of letters sent Thursday, the Federal Communications Commission warned that so called zero-rating, which makes the data used by certain video services free for the carriers' wireless customers, could harm competition and consumers.\nThe agency argues the practice could deter consumers from accessing mobile-video services not affiliated with the carriers, such as those from Netflix Inc. or Hulu, which is co-owned by Walt Disney Co., Comcast Corp., 21st Century Fox and Time Warner Inc.\n21st Century Fox and News Corp, parent company of The Wall Street Journal, share common ownership.\nBoth AT&T and Verizon responded Friday that the practice complies with existing rules and benefits consumers.\n\"We will provide the FCC with additional information on why the government should not take away a service that saves consumers money,\" AT&T said Friday.\nThe FCC's letters come on the heels of the launch of DirecTV Now this week and after Republican congressional leaders last month asked the agency to stop taking controversial regulatory actions until the new presidential administration is on board.\nThe FCC first raised its concerns with AT&T last month, the day after the presidential election. AT&T responded with a detailed defense that hasn't satisfied the regulator.\nRepublican FCC commissioner Ajit Pai criticized the move in a statement Friday, highlighting the Congress's call to avoid controversial decisions.\n\"This end-run around Congress's clear instruction is sad -- and pointless,\" he said, noting that any unilateral action \"can quickly be undone\" after the Presidential inauguration on Jan. 20.\nJon Wilkins, the head of the FCC's wireless division, in Thursday's letter wrote that the agency has \"reached the preliminary conclusion that these practices inhibit competition, harm consumers, and interfere with the 'virtuous cycle' needed to assure the continuing benefits of the open internet.\"\nThe FCC's letter to Verizon notes that the carrier's actions have \"the potential to hinder competition and harm consumers.\" Verizon excludes data charges to its wireless customers for its National Football League games or its go90 mobile-video app.\n\"We remain quite confident that our practices are good for consumers, non-discriminatory and are consistent with current rules,\" Verizon said Friday.\nThe agency requested both companies respond by Dec. 15, including a list of detailed questions for AT&T.\nAT&T says other video providers can also pay to cover data costs for their customers at the same rates as its DirecTV subsidiary. Verizon offers a similar program.\nThe FCC estimates that an outside video provider would have to pay AT&T $16 a month for each customer who used 10 minutes of streaming video a day, rising to $47 a month for a customer using 30 minutes a day.\n\"That would make it very difficult, if not infeasible, to offer a competitively priced service,\" the letter states.\nThe Dallas telecom firm, which agreed to buy Time Warner Inc. for $85.4 billion in October, began zero-rating its DirecTV video app in September as well as its new DirecTV Now over-the-top service.\n--Ryan Knutson contributed to this article.\nWrite to Thomas Gryta at thomas.gryta@wsj.com\n 02, 2016 16:53 ET (21:53 ",

This comes after we learned T-Mobile is rolling out Android 7.0 for the LG G5 . Verizon has thoroughly tested this version to bring optimizations to the phone’s performance, newest security patches, and fix several issues. \nVerizon’s software version is known as VS98726B. This is the official Android Nougat OS update for the LG G5 that includes several Themes for personalization. With the update, you can also now retrieve deleted images. You will no longer find the LG Downloads app because it has been replaced already by the Google Downloads app. For enhanced security, fingerprint registration information has been updated. \nThe LG G5 can now be used to charge another device after the software update. It’s one useful feature most people will appreciate because the phone now also works as an alternative powerbank. There’s also the Multi-window mode that allows you to split the screen and use two apps at once. \nNotifications have been updated once again. Unlocking the phone with notifications displayed has been changed while access to Quick Settings has also been enhanced. \nTo get this particular software update, make sure you are connected to WiFi and battery is fully charged. You should receive the OTA update anytime soon but if there’s nothing yet, check the settings manually.",

      "text": "The LG G5 Android Nougat software update has been ready since early November but it’s only now that Verizon Wireless is rolling out the build. This comes after we learned T-Mobile is rolling out Android 7.0 for the LG G5 . Verizon has thoroughly tested this version to bring optimizations to the phone’s performance, newest security patches, and fix several issues.\nVerizon’s software version is known as VS98726B. This is the official Android Nougat OS update for the LG G5 that includes several Themes for personalization. With the update, you can also now retrieve deleted images. You will no longer find the LG Downloads app because it has been replaced already by the Google Downloads app. For enhanced security, fingerprint registration information has been updated.\nThe LG G5 can now be used to charge another device after the software update. It’s one useful feature most people will appreciate because the phone now also works as an alternative powerbank. There’s also the Multi-window mode that allows you to split the screen and use two apps at once.\nNotifications have been updated once again. Unlocking the phone with notifications displayed has been changed while access to Quick Settings has also been enhanced.\nTo get this particular software update, make sure you are connected to WiFi and battery is fully charged. You should receive the OTA update anytime soon but if there’s nothing yet, check the settings manually.\nSOURCE: Verizon Wireless\n[timeline",

Unlike fines levied against T-Mobile a couple months ago, where the FCC ruled Team Magenta was not being fully forthcoming with the fine print of its “unlimited” data plans, the regulatory body is taking aim at AT&T and Verizon over how much these services “cost” versus what is billed to the customer, and thus create an anti-competitive market for mobile video content delivery.AT&T and Verizon offer plans that allow video streaming of DirecTV and Go90 content without it counting against the customer’s metered data plan. Both carriers charge the video providers to pay for the data instead of the customer, thus complying with the controversial rulings by the FCC over the past couple years.However, the FCC, in a letter sent to AT&T and Verizon this past week, asserts that because these video providers are owned by the respective carriers, they have an unsurmountable cost-advantage over any would-be competitor. The Commission claims to have done “the math” and gathers that a third-party provider like Netflix or Hulu would have to pay AT&T $47 per-month, per-customer, per 30-minutes of video streaming. AT&T charges customers $35 for DirecTV now, which certainly means the “cost” being billed for data is significantly less.Both Verizon and AT&T state that the “zero rating” of the data saves their respective customers money, and are incredibly popular services. If those figures are correct, there is an argument that “sponsored data” rates are significantly more expensive for non-AT&T-affiliated companies. No action has been taken by the FCC yet, but the head of the Commission’s Wireless Telecommunications Bureau, Jon Wilkins, says the agency’s preliminary findings are “these practices inhibit competition, harm customers,” and interfere with the spirit of maintaining an “open internet.”Those hoping to see decisive action soon are likely to be disappointed. A new administration is coming to office next month, the disposition of the commissioners that sit on the FCC will change. Congressional leaders have been hammering the agency with requests to stop making significant regulatory actions until the next administration is sworn in, where it is expected many regulations will be loosened, if not eliminated.Republican Commissioner, Ajit Pai called the agency’s current actions “sad and pointless.” A critic of the Title II ruling from last year , he added, “Any unilateral action taken by the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau at the chairman's direction in the next 49 days can quickly be undone by that same bureau after January 20, 2017.”",

      "text": "By TALI ARBEL\nAP Technology Writer NEW YORK (AP) - U.S. regulators are calling out AT&T and Verizon for exempting their own video apps from data caps on customers' cellphones.\nThis may not result in any changes in how the wireless carriers operate, however, as agency leaders appointed by Donald Trump, the incoming president, are expected to look more favorably on such practices.\nThe Federal Communications Commission sent letters to the country's biggest wireless carriers Thursday saying the way they handle the practice, known as \"zero rating,\" can hurt competition and consumers. The agency had warned AT&T in November and said in its Thursday letter that AT&T's response did not ease its concerns.\nOther services - say Hulu or Netflix - can pay Verizon and AT&T so that consumers could also use those apps without eating up cellphone data. The FCC says that could harm the market for streaming services as it makes it more expensive for internet companies to compete with video services that are owned by the carriers.\nFor example, the FCC estimates that a video service provider would have to pay AT&T $16 a month for a customer who streamed video for 10 minutes a day without using up his data on the cellular network, or $47 a month for a user watching a half-hour a day.\nAdding in those costs makes it difficult for a rival to compete on price with AT&T's new online TV app, DirecTV Now, whose cheapest bundle costs consumers $35 a month, wrote Jon Wilkins, the head of the FCC's wireless bureau. Competing video providers would also be at a disadvantage if they didn't zero-rate their services at all, as consumers could need to pay for more data to watch.\nAT&T Inc. said Friday that exempting apps like DirecTV Now from data caps saves customers money, and the FCC shouldn't put a stop to that. Verizon Communications Inc. said its practices are good for consumers and comply with regulations.\nVerizon lets wireless customers watch its go90 video app and NFL football, for which it has exclusive mobile rights, without using up data.\nThe warnings come in the final days of the FCC under President Barack Obama's administration, which has enacted regulations intended to prevent cable companies from playing favorites with internet services.\nThe agency under Trump and a Republican-controlled Congress are expected to roll back or enforce more leniently such measures.\nAjit Pai, a Republican commissioner at the FCC who is seen as a candidate to be the next FCC chairman, underscored that point in a statement Friday. He said the FCC's zero-rating warnings were \"yet another broadside against free data for consumers\" and warned that actions taken by the FCC now could be undone by a newly staffed FCC after Trump takes office.\nThe FCC still has to make a final finding on whether the zero-rating practices of AT&T and Verizon are a problem. The companies could appeal that.\n ",

      "text": "By Thomas Gryta\nFederal regulators raised new concerns about AT&T Inc.'s practice of excluding its new DirecTV Now streaming service from data charges and, for the first time, lobbed similar questions at Verizon Communications Inc.\nIn a pair of letters sent Thursday, the Federal Communications Commission warned that so called zero-rating, which makes the data used by certain video services free for the carriers' wireless customers, could harm competition and consumers.\nThe agency argues the practice could deter consumers from accessing mobile-video services not affiliated with the carriers, such as those from Netflix Inc. or Hulu, which is co-owned by Walt Disney Co., Comcast Corp., 21st Century Fox and Time Warner Inc.\n21st Century Fox and News Corp, parent company of The Wall Street Journal, share common ownership.\nBoth AT&T and Verizon responded Friday that the practice complies with existing rules and benefits consumers.\n\"We will provide the FCC with additional information on why the government should not take away a service that saves consumers money,\" AT&T said Friday.\nThe FCC's letters come on the heels of the launch of DirecTV Now this week and after Republican congressional leaders last month asked the agency to stop taking controversial regulatory actions until the new presidential administration is on board.\nThe FCC first raised its concerns with AT&T last month, the day after the presidential election. AT&T responded with a detailed defense that hasn't satisfied the regulator.\nJon Wilkins, the head of the FCC's wireless division, in Thursday's letter wrote that the agency has \"reached the preliminary conclusion that these practices inhibit competition, harm consumers, and interfere with the 'virtuous cycle' needed to assure the continuing benefits of the open internet.\"\nThe FCC's letter to Verizon notes that the carrier's actions have \"the potential to hinder competition and harm consumers.\" Verizon excludes data charges to its wireless customers for its National Football League games or its go90 mobile-video app.\n\"We remain quite confident that our practices are good for consumers, non-discriminatory and are consistent with current rules,\" Verizon said Friday.\nThe agency requested both companies respond by Dec. 15, including a list of detailed questions for AT&T.\nAT&T says other video providers can also pay to cover data costs for their customers at the same rates as its DirecTV subsidiary. Verizon offers a similar program.\nThe FCC estimates that an outside video provider would have to pay AT&T $16 a month for each customer who used 10 minutes of streaming video a day, rising to $47 a month for a customer using 30 minutes a day.\n\"That would make it very difficult, if not infeasible, to offer a competitively priced service,\" the letter states.\nThe Dallas telecom firm, which agreed to buy Time Warner Inc. for $85.4 billion in October, began zero-rating its DirecTV video app in September as well as its new DirecTV Now over-the-top service.\n--Ryan Knutson contributed to this article.\nWrite to Thomas Gryta at thomas.gryta@wsj.com\nCorrections & Amplifications\nThis item was corrected at 11:35 a.m. ET to show that Hulu is co-owned by Walt Disney Co., Comcast Corp., 21st Century Fox and Time Warner Inc., not solely Disney and 21st Century Fox.\n(END) 11:32 ET (16:32 ",

      "text": "By Thomas Gryta\nFederal regulators raised new concerns about AT&T Inc.'s practice of excluding its new DirecTV Now streaming service from data charges and, for the first time, lobbed similar questions at Verizon Communications Inc.\nIn a pair of letters sent Thursday, the Federal Communications Commission warned that so called zero-rating, which makes the data used by certain video services free for the carriers' wireless customers, could harm competition and consumers.\nThe agency argues the practice could deter consumers from accessing mobile-video services not affiliated with the carriers, such as those from Netflix Inc. or Hulu, which is co-owned by Walt Disney Co., Comcast Corp., 21st Century Fox and Time Warner Inc.\n21st Century Fox and News Corp, parent company of The Wall Street Journal, share common ownership.\nBoth AT&T and Verizon responded Friday that the practice complies with existing rules and benefits consumers.\n\"We will provide the FCC with additional information on why the government should not take away a service that saves consumers money,\" AT&T said Friday.\nThe FCC's letters come on the heels of the launch of DirecTV Now this week and after Republican congressional leaders last month asked the agency to stop taking controversial regulatory actions until the new presidential administration is on board.\nThe FCC first raised its concerns with AT&T last month, the day after the presidential election. AT&T responded with a detailed defense that hasn't satisfied the regulator.\nRepublican FCC commissioner Ajit Pai criticized the move in a statement Friday, highlighting the Congress's call to avoid controversial decisions.\n\"This end-run around Congress's clear instruction is sad -- and pointless,\" he said, noting that any unilateral action \"can quickly be undone\" after the Presidential inauguration on Jan. 20.\nJon Wilkins, the head of the FCC's wireless division, in Thursday's letter wrote that the agency has \"reached the preliminary conclusion that these practices inhibit competition, harm consumers, and interfere with the 'virtuous cycle' needed to assure the continuing benefits of the open internet.\"\nThe FCC's letter to Verizon notes that the carrier's actions have \"the potential to hinder competition and harm consumers.\" Verizon excludes data charges to its wireless customers for its National Football League games or its go90 mobile-video app.\n\"We remain quite confident that our practices are good for consumers, non-discriminatory and are consistent with current rules,\" Verizon said Friday.\nThe agency requested both companies respond by Dec. 15, including a list of detailed questions for AT&T.\nAT&T says other video providers can also pay to cover data costs for their customers at the same rates as its DirecTV subsidiary. Verizon offers a similar program.\nThe FCC estimates that an outside video provider would have to pay AT&T $16 a month for each customer who used 10 minutes of streaming video a day, rising to $47 a month for a customer using 30 minutes a day.\n\"That would make it very difficult, if not infeasible, to offer a competitively priced service,\" the letter states.\nThe Dallas telecom firm, which agreed to buy Time Warner Inc. for $85.4 billion in October, began zero-rating its DirecTV video app in September as well as its new DirecTV Now over-the-top service.\n--Ryan Knutson contributed to this article.\nWrite to Thomas Gryta at thomas.gryta@wsj.com\n(END) 16:53 ET (21:53 ",

Verizon was offering a trade-in on my LG G4 that brought the total DPP price to $200, so $8.33/mo DPP payment ($33 less the trade). Best Buy was also offering a $400 gift card. I noticed yesterday that Verizon is now offering the S7 Edge for $15/mo with no trade. Is there any way I can get Verizon to lower my DPP price? I haven't sent in the trade yet and I'm still in the 2 week return period at BB, although it will cost me $35. Has anyone managed to get Verizon to match a promotion after they signed up for a DPP plan?",

      "title": "FCC says AT&T, Verizon are violating net neutrality with sponsored data plans",
      "text": "Reddit \nThis week the FCC sent letters to both AT&T and Verizon , stating that zero-rated data — plans and services that don’t count against users’ monthly allotment — is a violation of net neutrality rules. For AT&T, this applies to their new DirecTV Now streaming video service, and for Verizon it’s their own Go90 video service. The FCC’s wireless communications chief Jon Wilkins wrote that the telecoms’ practices “inhibit competition, harm consumers, and interfere with the ‘virtuous cycle’ needed to assure the continuing benefits of the Open Internet.” \nSince AT&T owns DirecTV, it now allows wireless subscribers to use the new DirecTV Now streaming service without the data counting against monthly caps. The same goes for the standard DirecTV mobile app when used on AT&T’s mobile network. The FCC points out that this is an inherent benefit for AT&T’s own video service, and puts rival service at a distinct disadvantage. \nFor Verizon, it’s the carrier’s “FreeBee Data 360” program, which gives free data usage for its own Go90 video service. Any providers that don’t offer their content on Go90 are left out of the zero-rating benefits, and thus can’t be accessed by users without a cost premium. \nIn both cases, unaffiliated third parties must either pay extra to the carriers in order to compete on equal footing with their own in-house services, or suffer the disadvantage of users being charged for data when accessing their content. Since users frequently gravitate towards content and services that don’t count against data caps, the latter option is clearly intended to be anti-competitive. \nThe FCC has asked that both carrier respond to the letter and answer a number of questions by December 15th. Spokespeople for AT&T and Verizon have issued statements saying that they will respond to the inquiry, but firmly believe that their services do not violate net neutrality rules, and are loved by consumers because they save them money.",
