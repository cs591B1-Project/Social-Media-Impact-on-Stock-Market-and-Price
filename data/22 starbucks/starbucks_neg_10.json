      "text": "BERKELEY — The involvement of community members, including one who had a gun pointed at him, led to the arrests of two robbery suspects Saturday, police said Monday.\nNo one was hurt.\nThe robbery happened about 4:19 p.m. Saturday at a Starbucks in the 3300 block of Telegraph Avenue.\nPolice said a man later identified as Delamontae Stewart, 22, tried to steal a woman’s laptop and struggled with her until he was able to yank it away from her.\nWhen a man tried to block the door to prevent him from fleeing,Stewart threatened him with a pistol that later turned out to be a pellet gun until the man moved away and Stewart fled, police said.\nDespite being threatened by the gun, the man went outside and watched as the robber run eastbound on Ashby Avenue and get into a waiting car.\nThe man and other witnesses provided detailed descriptions of the car, the suspects and the route they took, Sgt. Andrew Frankel said.\nResponding officers stopped the car near the intersection of Ashby and Domingo Street.\nThe stolen laptop and a pellet gun were found inside the vehicle.",

We hope and trust that our customers will continue to honor that tradition,” it said. “We don’t require our partners to write or call out names.” \nThe movement took off after some baristas not only refused to write Trump’s name but called the police on a customer who asked. Harry Reid’s rule change comes back to bite Dems; another bitter pill \nFox Business host Lisa Kennedy made fun of the company’s stance on “Outnumbered” Monday. \n“Their response basically (is) ‘This is why we can’t have nice things. You guys are gonna wreck it for everyone,’ she joked. \nThis isn’t the first time Trump and his supporters have had issues with Starbucks either. \nDuring the Republican primary, Trump floated the idea of boycotting the company when it released its holiday red cups with no Christmas symbolism. \nWake up right!

      "text": "  11 Comments Comments Trump supporters protest Starbucks with #TrumpCup \nBuying a brand’s product always teaches the marketer a lesson about how much you don’t like its employees. Wait, what? \nIn one of the most counterintuitive “boycotts” I’ve ever seen — since last year’s #‎merrychristmasstarbucks protest of its red cups — supporters of President-elect Donald J. Trump are protesting Starbucks by buying coffee. Yes. They’re so angry, they’re adding to the company’s bottom line. \nOn Thursday night, @bakedalaska tweeted that “Operation #TrumpCup” involves telling Starbucks baristas that your name is Trump. That way, they’ll have to call it when your drink is ready. Starbucks baristas may refuse to believe your name is Trump and, if they do, #TrumpCuppers are to record video of that reaction. \n1) Go to Starbucks & tell them your name is Trump \n2) If they refuse take video \nPls share & spread the word pic.twitter.com/huPj4g6cqY \n— Baked Alaska™ (@bakedalaska) November 18, 2016 Hold up. Trump supporters are boycotting Starbucks…by purchasing Starbucks? Go to bed 2016, you've had too much to drink. #trumpcup \n— Tyler Price (@tylercprice_) November 18, 2016 \nThis #TrumpCup movement popped up after a video of a Trump supporter who, according to the Miami Herald’s reporting on Wednesday, got upset that baristas were taking too long to serve him at a University of Miami Starbucks. \n#TrumpCup followers, though, believe the barista refused the man service in Miami because he voted for Trump. \nEither way, the video that went viral on social media on Wednesday and Thursday shows the man at the University of Miami Starbucks calling a barista “garbage” and “complete trash” before telling her he wanted his money back and saying to another female Starbucks employee who asked him to leave “[I’ll] punch you out.” \nThe man then got his refund and left the store. #trump supporter in #miami @Starbucks attacks & threatens patrons & staff bc coffee took too long, blames anti-white \"discrimination\" pic.twitter.com/HRj9EahrMy \n— jorge dc (@Jbdcl) November 16, 2016 \nOn Friday, @bakedalaska retweeted a video showing a #TrumpCupper being refused service and being reported to the police by Starbucks staffers. Fox News also included the video in its coverage. Starbucks SJWs call cops on customer for requesting \"Trump\" name on his coffee cup.You know what to do, folks. pic.twitter.com/0kMzvtCkBg",

      "text": "  28 SHARES Share \nAfter seeing screenshots of the woman threatening to spit in the Starbucks cups of anyone who wanted her to write “Trump” on their drinks, it seemed to me to be a little bit weird. \nIndependent Journal Review had the same feeling, and what they discovered about Twitter user Sam Montgomery probably isn’t what you expected. \nSeveral news sites, like TruthFeed pictured above and “PRNTLY” pictured below, picked up the story. \nThe tweets in question (below) seem oddly descriptive, don’t they? \nOf course, Twitter reacted to the news of her “firing.” @sammontgomery as well you should be there are consequences for foolish actions what did you think would happen, honestly? \n— deplorable troglodyt (@Pollyesther34) November 19, 2016 @sammontgomery I don't hate or dislike you, I don't understand, I don't understand the hatred people have for someone they really don't know \n— FFB4NYGiants&MAGA💯 (@ffb4USS_Mason) November 19, 2016 \nOne reporter even requested an interview! @renbostelaar @FoxLexington would love to share my story about being persecuted for my beliefs! \n— Sam Montgomery (@sammontgomery) November 19, 2016 \nAll of this looked a little bit strange, and one glance at her Twitter bio could tell you why. \nMontgomery lists her place of residence as Toronto, and claims she has co-authored a book entitled Stats Canada: Satire On A National Scale. \nIndependent Journal Review dug even further and confirmed with Starbucks that this woman has never worked at one of their store, or its affiliates such as Barnes & Noble or airport coffee stands. \nWhat was the point of her fake story? Was it to get people riled up via convincing satire? Her Twitter account also hosts this Tweet. Went to Starbucks and asked them to put Trump on my cup and they wrote this??? Shame Starbucks! pic.twitter.com/V4x1bB9ctT \n— Sam Montgomery (@sammontgomery) November 18, 2016 \nWhile it may have been hard to tell that this was satire initially, I highly recommend not taking too seriously anything from this account. 28 SHARES",

      "text": "What Is the Ember Mug? Starbucks Just Released a Cup That Will Prevent Your Coffee From Going Cold Ever Again November 21, 2016 by Terry Carter 0 Shares \nSay goodbye to lukewarm Pumpkin Spice Lattes this Winter. Starbucks has teamed up with Ember, the company behind the Ember Mug , a smartphone-controlled coffee mug designed to keep your coffee heated to your desired temperature all day long. \nAccording to Inc., the cup works by using \" a series of sensors and heating rings \" that will warm up your drink — or cool it down, if you'd prefer. To control the temperature, all you have to do is rotate the dial located on the bottom of the mug. You can also control how warm your coffee stays using the Ember app. Once connected to your smartphone or smartwatch device, you can change the temperature of the liquid inside of your Ember cup with just a tap on your screen. \nStarbucks \"ran the mugs through months of safety inspections\" before agreeing to allow the product to be sold in its stores, Inc. reported. The chain also reportedly tested the mug to make sure the heating process \"didn't change the flavor of its coffee.\" The Ember Mug is currently listed for $150 and is available for purchase in 100 Starbucks locations throughout the US. Get a closer look at the brand-new smart mug ahead. Would you invest in a cup that promises to keep your coffee warm all day long?",

      "text": "You can now walk into a Starbucks and order any one of 87,000 drink combinations and the barista won’t bat an eye (although I have seen a few eye rolls…) If customers expect that level of customization from a five dollar investment, imagine what they expect when they’re looking to invest thousands of dollars in a solution? \nYet surprisingly in this era of customized experiences, most product demos still vary little from customer to customer. This may have been acceptable in decades past. But as the sheer number of demos that customers are exposed to grows, the bar continues to rise. A canned demo is evident to all who see it — and about as memorable as what you had for lunch two weeks ago Tuesday.\nEven though your solution may address a common set of challenges, when you tailor your demo you make your prospect feel like your solution was designed just for them.\nMost sales and pre-sales people realize that customization is important, but tailoring a demo to each potential customer can seem overwhelming. Especially when your plate is already full to overflowing. So I’ve identified three areas that you can quickly and easily tailor to each customer:\n3 Simple Ways to Tailor your Demo Your Opening: “Let’s jump into the demo” is your audience’s cue to settle in for a generic ride. Especially when it’s followed by a tedious overview or tour of the dashboard designed to give the customer the “lay of the land.”\nMake better use of this critical time by using your opening to reflect your understanding of your customer’s uniqueness back to them. Do a quick review ofyour prospect’s circumstances, including pain and impact. Give them a preview of the specific outcomes they can expect to achieve with your solution. This is especially critical with busy C-level executives who may not sit through the entire demo. Connecting immediately with your customer’s unique circumstances will separate your demo from the crowd right from the start. Your Agenda. \nMost agendas are a list of features that a salesperson has determined appropriate for a particular customer. But this is only the very beginning step to tailor your demo. Turn your agenda into a powerful customer-focused tool by using the customer’s language, not your own terminology.\nFor example, perhaps you have a feature called the Analytics Pro Plus that you’ve determined the V.P. of Sales would find very useful for evaluating sales team performance. Instead of naming the topic after the feature, why not call it “Evaluating Sales Team Performance,” for example.\nRemember, most customers don’t care what you call your features. Most don’t even care how they work. What they do care about is how they are going to help solve their problems or achieve their goals. Using a list of topics grounded in your customer’s world, shows a deeper understanding of your customer’s issues and exponentially increases your credibility. Introducing a Feature: \nThe features you show in each demo may be the same, but the way you introduce them should always change based on your customer’s unique situation.\nBefore showing each feature, take a moment to set the stage first. Where would your customer use this feature? How are they currently doing this process or step? What is the impact on their jobs or business? (These are all things you should be finding out in your discovery .)\nUsing as many customer-focused specifics as possible during your demo. This will help connect the dots for your customer and give them a greater understanding of how they can benefit from your solution.\n\nCustomization doesn’t have to be a long arduous process. By taking what you know about your customer and applying it in these three areas you can quickly and easily turn a plain coffee demo into a White Mocha Frappuccino experience. ",

Blue File photo i Order Reprint of this Story \nStarbucks has decided to raise some of its prices again this year, just in time for the holidays. \nStrangely, though, the coffee chain is only hiking costs of some cold drinks and baked goods. A spokewoman told CNN Money the prices for certain items rose 10 to 30 cents on Nov. 10. \nMeanwhile, drinks such as hot coffee and tea did not see a price change. \nStarbucks has not released a statement on why it’s raising prices, but at least hot drinks aren’t being affected — because, baby, it’s cold outside.

      "text": "Tis the season for Starbucks red cups, Coca Cola polar bears, the majestic Clydesdales, and more. The holidays are a marketer’s dream come true . If you play your cards right, Q4 can be incredibly profitable for you and your business.\n1. Don’t make assumptions. Don’t just assume that your customers delight upon hearing Christmas greetings. Be sensitive to the beliefs of others. Don’t force your celebration down their throats. At the same time, know your demographic. For example, if you work for a Catholic based charity; religious connotations in your holiday marketing campaigns would be expected and acceptable. Understanding who you are, what you want to represent, and the temperature of your audience will make sure your campaign resonates with customers.\n2. Go where the people are. As with all marketing campaigns, make sure you’re using the right outlet for your message. For example, if you’re running a week long special, you can afford to send out an email promoting this deal. But, if it’s a three hour discount, send out a mass text campaign or post on social media. These two methods are instantaneous, and will encourage the most offer redemption. Know where your customers are “living,” in a digital sense, and make a home there.\n3. Respect differences in beliefs. As I first stated, don’t assume that everyone celebrates the same way you do. On top of that, once differences do arise, show respect for the beliefs, traditions, and customs of others. If your customer base is one huge melting pot, than choose to celebrate the majority holiday of you and your staff, while being aware of other preferences. When applicable, recognize these differences, in an effort to show you’re globally minded.\n4. Make the most of old traditions. Don’t be afraid to capitalize on current traditions. If it’s not broke, don’t fix it. One of the longest holiday traditions? The Christmas tree. Plan a marketing campaign around a custom that’s already stamped itself in the minds of the consumer. People will recognize this symbol, and immediately develop associations with your campaign.\n5. Start your own traditions. Make room for new traditions. With new traditions comes the opportunity to solidify your brand in an evergreen way. For example, the Coca Cola polar bears have become an iconic symbol for this corporation; especially around the holidays. In fact, if you don’t see these symbols, it doesn’t even feel like that time of the year. One of the best examples of a new tradition that has swept the nation? Elf on the Shelf.\n6. Don’t overspend. Word of mouth marketing escalates around the holidays. The holidays bring people together. When people are together, what do they do? Talk. They exchange first hand accounts about what products they’re using, where they’re going, who they’re following … the list goes on. Who wouldn’t want their product or service to be a part of those conversations? Take the main stage this holiday season by focusing on memorable campaigns.\nMemorable campaigns usually possess one or more of the following elements.\nThe “Me too!” factor (people relate your campaign to a past experience) A storyline that incites emotion or a reaction (nostalgia, laughter, etc.) A way to share their own story or contribute to the campaign (share your favorite holiday recipes) 7. Note what works and what doesn’t. Your holiday marketing campaigns won’t always resonate. Every year, try a new angle until something sticks. Once you find a campaign that takes off, follow this same direction every year. Maximize the storyline. Make your efforts cohesive and apparent.\nAbove all else, you must see the holidays as a time of opportunity . People expect to come face to face with marketing messages this time of year. This 60 to 90 day period is a perfect time to position your brand.\n",

      "text": "Adam Dupuis | November 20, 2016 \nWhat would you have done if you had seen this man act like he did in public? You had better ask yourself that now, because stupid is about to come out of the wood work even more and feel that it is justified. \nA man, allegedly upset about how long his order is taking at a Miami Starbucks, yells \"Trump\" at an employee on Nov. 16, 2016. \n\n\n\nJorge de Cárdenas posted the video at about 5 p.m. Wednesday with the message: “#trump supporter in #miami @Starbucks attacks & threatens patrons & staff bc coffee took too long, blames anti-white “discrimination.” \n\nFor two minutes the man yells and asks for his money back since the order took too long. He yells, \"you're trash\" to the female cashier followed by, \"Cause I voted for Trump. Trump. You lost. Now give me my money back. You’re garbage. You’re complete trash.” \nWhy are people this ignorant? Thank goodness there was another customer that felt the ned to call out this man's stupidity. \nSo who was this hot headed man? Since this was shared in the Miami Herald and everyone knows everyone's business down here, the community and the Miami Herald was quick to point fingers and identify the loud mouth. \nDavid Sanguesa said he was having a bad day. \nBut it seems Sanguesa has had many bad days. Wednesday was just the latest. That was the day he was captured on video angrily yelling “Trump!” and “I voted for Trump!” at a barista at a Coral Gables Starbucks when he felt he didn’t get his tall vanilla latte quickly enough because he is white. Then he demanded his money back, calling her “trash” and “garbage.” \nPrevious bad days: the one in 2008 when he was arrested on a DUI charge. The one a week later when he was again charged with DUI. And the day in 2014 when he was charged with domestic violence, which was later dropped. And there were all those days, going back years, when he emailed the Miami Herald with rants against Cubans, women, immigrants, gays and lesbians, President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. \nSanguesa, 53, was identified Thursday after the video went viral. He told the Miami Herald he had apologized to Starbucks — then did a quick turnaround threatening to sue the company for discrimination and causing him to lose business. \n“I had a bad day. I was wrong for screaming at her. I have since apologized,” Sanguesa said Thursday morning. \nIn a second interview with the Herald, he added: “My attorneys want to file a lawsuit. No one saw the first part of the video. I was completely done wrong. I was racially discriminated against. I was refused service. I was wrong to get upset, but I was racially discriminated against. \n“She wouldn’t serve me,” he said. “She knew I was a Trump supporter and wouldn’t give me my coffee.” \nOn Thursday Starbucks said in a statement that the company embraced “diversity and treating each other with respect and dignity is core to Starbucks values and something our partners take great pride in showing.” \nSanguesa mentioned he suffers from a mental illness he didn’t name, though he did not blame that for his outburst. He said something similar to WPLG Local 10, telling the station that he had not taken his medication Wednesday. Local 10 identified the Starbucks barista as Jennifer Santos. Asked if she refused to serve Sanguesa, she said, “No, I didn't.” \nSanguesa, a regular at the Coral Gables Starbucks on South Dixie Highway for over a decade, is well known to South Miami police, who said they have been to his home several times, once arresting him for a domestic dispute in 2014. The case was later dropped. \nOver the years he’s sent several reporters at the Herald angry emails often directed at Obama, women and Cuban- Americans. \nIn one email sent this month, he said Obama has caused 95 million people to lose their jobs by “pushing a sick, left wing agenda of not working... living off the government... trying to get rid of Jesus Christ, abortion, homosexuality, lesbians, transgender... Hollywood trash... we are Miami destroyed... by people who hate the USA.” \nFour days earlier he had sent an email about the coverage of the death of former Miami Marlins pitcher Jose Fernandez in a boating accident. “I hate Cubans.... all pieces of s--- including Jose Fernandez.” \nHe ended the email: “Viva Fidel Castro!!” - miamiherald.com \n\nSo he wasn't on his meds? He was refused service? Who knows 100%. \nApology accepted? We know that isn't going to be 100%. \nWhat we need to know is how to react to stupidity, medicated or not, because more of this is going to happen. \nWe don't have the answers but did ask the similar question in a previous post entitled Is This What To Do If You See A Hate Crime? \n\n#trump supporter in #miami @Starbucks attacks & threatens patrons & staff bc coffee took too long, blames anti-white \"discrimination\" pic.twitter.com/HRj9EahrMy \n— jorge dc (@Jbdcl) November 16, 2016 \n\nh/t: miamiherald.com article by Carli Teproff and Charles Rabin ) \ntwitter video by jorge de cárdenas via Twitter @Jbdcl",

The suspect then pulled out a gun and the customer moved out of the way, police said.\nThe customer then followed the suspect outside and saw him leave on Ashby Avenue and got into a waiting car, police said.\nAfter police gathered a description of the car from witnesses, officers were able to find the car near Ashby and Domingo avenues.\nOnce they were able to identify the robber, police searched the car and found the stolen laptop and a pellet gun.\nThe two people inside the car have been identified as Oakland residents Delamontae Stewart, 22, and Zachery Haliburton, 19.\nStewart and Haliburton were arrested on suspicion of robbery and possession of stolen property.\n",

By Rebecca Dolan , Online Community Editor November 21, 2016 \nIs your Starbucks habit putting a grande dent in your wallet? Try these tactics to slash your coffee tab. See Also: 10 Reasons You Will Never Be a Millionaire \nJoin My Starbucks Rewards for a free birthday treat, free in-store refills, plus special discount offers. Gold members get a free food item or drink for every 125 stars they earn. \nRack up the stars on your friends' or coworkers' dimes by being the designated coffee runner. Then, use your free rewards on fancier (aka more expensive) drinks. \nOnly want a small caffeine jolt? Opt for the unadvertised (and less expensive) \"short\" size. Advertisement \nBring your own re-usable cup for a 10-cent discount. \nDon't bother buying bottled water to wash it all down. Just ask the barista for a cup of water. \nBuy discount Starbucks gift cards at websites like Gift Card Granny or Cardpool. \nTry brewing your own Starbucks coffee at home. Advertisement \nMy Starbucks Rewards members still score points at Teavana and on some grocery store purchases. \nWhen all else fails, consider a side gig as a barista to get 30% off drinks, food and merchandise.",

      "text": "November 21, 2016 Photo by StarkyTang / Shutterstock.com \nFans of Donald Trump are employing an unusual method to voice their support for the president-elect while also protesting Starbucks for what’s being called “anti-white discrimination.” \nThe protesters are spending money at Starbucks. \nAccording to CNN , in a movement known as #TrumpCup , supporters of the president-elect are ordering their Starbucks drinks under Trump’s name so the baristas have to both write Trump on the cup and holler out his name when the drink is done, as is the coffee giant’s regular practice. \nThe #TrumpCup movement gained steam recently after a video of a Trump supporter angrily yelling at a Starbucks barista went viral. Although the video shows the man calling the barista “trash” and “garbage” as he demands his money back for a drink that he was apparently waiting for, the pro-Trump Starbucks customer tells a different story. According to CNN: \nThe man in the video told the Miami Herald that he was racially discriminated against and that the barista wouldn’t serve him because she knew he was a Trump supporter. \nTrump supporters who participate in the #TrumpCup movement are urged to take video if Starbucks’ workers refuse to write “Trump” on their cups or yell the president-elect’s name. \nTim Treadstone, a social media strategist and political consultant who lives in Los Angeles, has been credited for creating #TrumpCup. Treadstone tells The Washington Post it’s a First Amendment exercise: \n“We have a culture war to win. I’m a Trump supporter. I thought when Trump won, I might just wake up and America would be great again. Guess what, it wasn’t. We have a lot of work to do. We have hearts and minds to win. Obviously, a lot of people aren’t happy with us, and we need to stand up for our freedom and our First Amendment.” \nIn a statement, Starbucks says writing customers’ names on cups is a fun tradition, not a requirement for its baristas. \n“Rarely has it been abused or taken advantage of. We hope and trust that our customers will continue to honor that tradition.” \nWhat do you think of #TrumpCup?  ",

      "text": "Email \nTrump supporters have started asking for their Starbucks drinks under Trump’s name as a movement against the coffee giant. \nAfter a viral video showing a Trump supporter yelling at a barista gained traction on Wednesday, other supporters have banded together to protest what they view as political and anti-white discrimination. \nThe man in the video told the Miami Herald that he was racially discriminated against and that the barista wouldn’t serve him because she knew he was a Trump supporter. \nThe hashtag #TrumpCup isn’t new, but blew up after a Twitter user posted instructions to followers Friday morning. The hashtag had over 12,000 tweets as of 10 a.m. Friday. \nThe protest is an attempt to make Starbucks baristas yell Trump’s name and write it on their coffee cups, as is the company’s mandate. \nSome supporters claim to have been refused a #TrumpCup and see it as a breach of their rights. \nBut others find the protest counterintuitive, as the plan relies on giving Starbucks money in the first place. \nThis all comes after the controversy that plagued Starbucks last year as they introduced a plain red holiday cup that was markedly different from Christmas cups in the past. Joshua Feuerstein, a former pastor, called the new cups a “war on Christmas” in a video posted to Facebook. \nBut many social media users find the Starbucks protests old and tiresome. \nSome even call out the logic of the movement with a good-natured slight at Starbucks. \nCNN’s calls to Starbucks were not immediately returned.

      "text": "VIDEO: Impatient Donald Trump supporter abuses Black barista at Starbucks VIDEO: Impatient Donald Trump supporter abuses Black barista at Starbucks There has been a spike in racist incidents in America after Trump defeated Hillary Clinton in the Presidential election. By: Express Web Desk | New Delhi | Updated: November 22, 2016 12:15 pm \nA prominent rights activist posted a video of a Donald Trump supporter abusing a black barista at a Starbucks outlet in Miami when his coffee did not arrive on time. Demanding a refund, the man called the barista “trash” and “garbage”. He went on to say that she “lost” as Trump won the Presidential election. The barista replied saying “congratulations” and maintained her composure even as the man moved threateningly towards her. The Trump supporter also threatened to beat up another customer, when he came to her defence. He became aggressive when he was told to stop addressing the barista in that manner. The man, however, backed away when the other customer asked him he “wanted to take this outside”. Shaun King, a prominent voice in the Black Lives Matter movement, posted the video of the confrontation and asked his followers to make this man “famous”. The incident reportedly happened last Thursday. \nThere has been a spike in racist incidents in America after Trump defeated Hillary Clinton in the Presidential election. Incidents of graffiti being sprayed on walls, asking immigrants to leave America have become a recurring sight. Blacks were also targeted, with racists spraying painting the n-word on a car and in classrooms. © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd Tags:",

      "text": "A Starbucks spokeswoman confirmed on Monday that the company raised some of its prices in the 48 hours following the U.S. presidential election results.\nSpeaking to finance publication The Street , a spokesperson for the company reported a price increase of between 10 and 30 cents on selected cold brews, cold drinks, and baked goods, effective Nov. 10 at most stores.\nSome customers took to Twitter to express their thoughts on the decision. “IS @ Starbucks SERIOUS WITH THIS PRICE HIKE?! My Trenta Iced Coffee, with NOTHING, in it, now costs over $4…” said one customer.\n“The cost of your favorite beverage just went from ‘ungodly’ to ‘go ahead and sell that kidney,'” said another.\nMeanwhile, at least one Twitter user seemed to be pointing out that despite the rise in prices, Starbucks remains a pretty good deal, considering its position as what he called the world’s “largest coworking space,” with free wi-fi.\nThe reason for the unpopularity is that Starbucks sbux has already increased its prices this year, with the cost of drinks going up by up to 30 cents in some cases in July--the company citing rising operational and coffee costs.\nSome items such as cold brew coffee had maintained the same price for the last two years until the recent change, a spokeswoman told The Street. \nAn earlier price hike in July suffered a minor snafu when point-of-sale price points were prematurely adjusted in machines before the official news was released--again, stealthily, late on a Friday in the lead up to a long weekend, Fortune’s Phil Wahba reported.\nFor more on Starbucks, watch Fortune’s video: \n\nLast year, Starbucks raised prices on most beverages by between 5 and 20 cents. 2016’s relatively large increase is the latest in a long line of confident moves by the coffee behemoth, which has been having an extremely good year by anyone’s standards, outperforming Wall Street predictions and projecting better results for the 2017 financial year.\nRelative to its own past performance, however, things are not so rosy: despite sales at stores open for longer than a year growing 4% in the fourth quarter of 2016, the figure falls 0.9% short of analyst-anticipated growth.\nSo the recent price raise can at least in part be attributed to a slump in predicted growth trajectory. Analysts say this has sparked fears of a recession in the food and beverage industry, as Starbucks’ performance is seen as a kind of barometer.\nIn its defense, Starbucks is forecasting that the average customer receipt will only go up by about 0.5% as a result of the change.",

      "text": "\n© 2016 Time Inc. All rights reserved. People Aren’t Very Happy with Starbucks’ Quiet Little Price Hike \nA Starbucks spokeswoman confirmed on Monday that the company raised some of its prices in the 48 hours following the U.S. presidential election results. \nSpeaking to finance publication The Street , a spokesperson for the company reported a price increase of between 10 and 30 cents on selected cold brews, cold drinks, and baked goods, effective Nov. 10 at most stores. \nSome customers took to Twitter to express their thoughts on the decision. “IS @ Starbucks SERIOUS WITH THIS PRICE HIKE?! My Trenta Iced Coffee, with NOTHING, in it, now costs over $4…” said one customer. \n“The cost of your favorite beverage just went from ‘ungodly’ to ‘go ahead and sell that kidney,'” said another. \nMeanwhile, at least one Twitter user seemed to be pointing out that despite the rise in prices, Starbucks remains a pretty good deal, considering its position as what he called the world’s “largest coworking space,” with free wi-fi. \nThe reason for the unpopularity is that Starbucks sbux has already increased its prices this year, with the cost of drinks going up by up to 30 cents in some cases in July—the company citing rising operational and coffee costs. \nSome items such as cold brew coffee had maintained the same price for the last two years until the recent change, a spokeswoman told The Street. \nThe earlier price hike suffered a minor snafu when point-of-sale price points were prematurely adjusted in machines before the official news was released—again, stealthily, late on a Friday in the lead up to a long weekend, Fortune’s Phil Wahba reported. For more on Starbucks, watch Fortune’s video: Last year, Starbucks raised prices on most beverages by between 5 and 20 cents. 2016’s relatively large increase is the latest in a long line of confident moves by the coffee behemoth, which has been having an extremely good year by anyone’s standards, outperforming Wall Street predictions and projecting better results for the 2017 financial year. Relative to its own past performance, however, things are not so rosy: despite sales at stores open for longer than a year growing 4% in the fourth quarter of 2016, the figure falls 0.9% short of analyst-anticipated growth. So the recent price raise can at least in part be attributed to a slump in predicted growth trajectory. Analysts say this has sparked fears of a recession in the food and beverage industry, as Starbucks’ performance is seen as a kind of barometer. In its defense, Starbucks is forecasting that the average customer receipt will only go up by about 0.5% as a result of the change. ",

      "text": "Starbucks Just Raised Its Prices (Again) And People Are Angry Have you looked at how much your coffee costs you lately? Owner, Howard Raucous LLC @ ChrisMatyszczyk WRITE A COMMENT At what point is it too much?   \nAbsurdly Driven looks at the world of business with a skeptical eye and a firmly rooted tongue in cheek. \nDon't tell me you haven't noticed. \nSomehow, this year has been the year when your Starbucks breakfast has been costing you that little bit more. And then a little bit more again. \nYou don't realize at first. After all, you drop the change in the tip jar for your barista anyway, don't you? You might even add another dollar or two if you're a regular. \nOne thing's clear, however. Starbucks' prices are going up. \nThe latest rise, which happened just a few days ago , saw certain cold drinks and baked goods suddenly cost between 10 and 30 cents more. \nThere doesn't seem to be any obvious reason for the increase. Perhaps even the PR people couldn't think of a fine ruse to excuse the price of ice going up. \nThis is the second price hike at Starbucks in just the last few months. In July, the cost of some of your basic espresso and latte drinks suddenly crept up. \nIt's almost as if Starbucks has looked at the nickel-and-diming of the airlines and thought: \"Wonder if we can get away with that.\" \nThis time around, 10 percent of Starbucks drinks now cost more. \n\"Oh, what's another 10 or 30 cents?\" some coffee-addled executive will mutter. Well, Starbucks is often a regular purchase. So 30 cents a day is $1.50 a week, which is an extra $6 a month or $72 a year per customer. \nThere are approximately 12,500 Starbucks in the US. Your average Starbucks store serves 500 customers a day. So that might be an extra $36,000 of revenue per store for giving customers the very same thing. \nLet's return to whether customers are noticing. Some are. \nWaft over to Twitter and you'll see things like this from Danny Devir : \"@Starbucks just noticed the price hike on coffee. Don't understand how a black unsweetened iced coffee is over $3. #nottipping #toomuch.\" \nWait, not tipping? Could these price hikes actually affect the vital tips that baristas get every day? \nHow about this from Amanda Bender: \"Hey! I got my iced coffee from Starbucks. I've been paying $3.76 for my Trenta, but last week I noticed my order is now $4.08.\" \nI don't even want to think about what a Trenta might be. I do want to think about how high these prices can go. \nStarbucks, though, thinks this is a storm in chai cup. \nA spokeswoman calmly told CNBC: \"We expect the average customer ticket to increase by about 0.5 percent as a result of these beverage adjustments.\" \nI confess that I'm a victim of this price creep. Once my Starbucks breakfast might have cost $6 or $7. Now it's drifted up to $9 or $10. I don't really know how that's happened, but when I get around to working it out, I'm sure I'll try and think of cheaper -- or, even, better -- options. \nIt's not as if the pastries are anything more than slightly rubbery facsimiles of, you know, real pastries. It's not as if the coffee is so revolutionary and uplifting that nothing else comes close. \nMost of the reason I go to Starbucks is the baristas, not the product. It's the community, not the coffee. \nKurshina saves a newspaper for me. Marie practices her Spanish on me and speaks of metaphysical truths. \nPrice hikes are such dangerous things. Starbucks' same-store sales aren't showing exponential growth . It's inevitable, too, that when a brand has been around for a while and feels ubiquitous, customers get bored. \nStarbucks might have tried to excite them with green solidarity cups before the red holiday ones came out, but there may be signs of strain here. \nWith price hikes, customer attrition can happen just as Hemingway described bankruptcy: Gradually, then suddenly. \nAfter all, it's just coffee.

      "text": "11/22/16 07:28 am EST . \n(NBC News) - Starbucks has raised the prices of select cold beverages and bakery items between 10 cents and 30 cents. \nThe price hike quietly went into effect Nov. 10, but some Twitter users have taken to social media to complain about the increase. \nThis isn't the first price hike of 2016. Starbucks raised the cost of some of its beverages by as much as 30 cents back in July. @Starbucks just noticed the price hike on coffee. Don't understand how a black unsweetened iced coffee is over $3. #nottipping #toomuch — Danny Devir (@DannyDevir) November 11, 2016 @lindseybell Did your @Starbucks iced coffee price go up? I paid $3.53, then two days later I paid $3.73. That's quite a price hike. — Curt Newton (@Laochri) November 15, 2016 Filed under:",

      "text": "The Legend of the Starbucks Siren 11/22/2016 12:33 pm ET Advertising Week The world’s premier annual gathering of marketing and communications leaders. \nBy Heather Taylor \nShe has flowing hair and wears a crown like adornment atop her head. Her face is serene and her all-knowing grin is akin to the Mona Lisa — if Da Vinci’s masterpiece was ever a secret coffee enthusiast, that is. Since 1971, the ubiquitous image of the Starbucks Siren has been a constant companion to coffee cups from the chain. Whether tall, grande, or venti, if you’re spotted carrying a cuppa joe with a green siren printed on the cup’s packaging it is universally known that you just went to Starbucks. \nMuch like the Mona Lisa, the Starbucks Siren is iconic and also a modern-day mystery to us mere mortals. Dive on in to the depths as we reveal a glimpse into the world of this elusive 45-year-old brand mascot — and why she should never be confused with a mermaid. Hailing from Greek mythology to become the face of a brand. \nAs the Starbucks Company Profile states, twin-tailed sirens from Greek mythology inspired the brand logo. Perfectly fitting since the name “Starbucks” was taken from Herman Melville’s Moby Dick , named after the first mate. \nSteve Murray, Creative Director at Starbucks, says that the founders stumbled upon a picture of a woodcut of a siren while looking through old seafaring textbooks. In that moment, everything clicked. “[The siren] is from the sea and coffee comes from across the ocean. Seattle is a kind of seafaring town and it seemed to fit together well, adding a mythical feel to it too.” \nLest the Starbucks siren ever be confused with a mermaid, keep in mind the number of tails she has. Sirens are known for having twin tails while mermaids only have one. \nAnd while Murray assures us that the Siren is not inspired by anyone living, the team at Starbucks does consider her to be real in her own respect. “She’s the biggest symbol, and face, of our brand.” A Siren evolves through the decades. \nIn 1971, the original Siren logo illustration truly embodied her folkloric roots. A twin tail in each hand, the Siren was drawn in brown and white with visible cleavage, a stomach with a naval, and only the faintest hint of a smile on her face. \nWhile sailors have been known to fall victim to a siren’s song, this one was stylized over time to keep from being viewed negatively by consumers as the coffee brand began to take off in popularity. In 1987, her long flowing hair was moved to the front of her chest and the brown and white colors were discarded for modern greens, blacks, and whites. 1992 saw the disappearance of her stomach and naval completely, with the tails barely noticeable in her hand as her face was zoomed in on. \nIn her most recent 2011 reincarnation, the Siren is completely green and white with wavy hair and twin tails peeking out on either side of her. The name of the coffee brand has been removed from the logo too. In a blog post on 1912 Pike , the Starbucks Coffee Blog, the most recent Siren revamp meant cleaning up the icon a bit with styled hair and light face work. \n“I’d say she’s gotten a little more modest,” Murray says on the Siren’s transformation, “But mostly the same if you look at her face across all those times. It has stayed pretty consistent. \nHoward Schultz , CEO of Starbucks, echoes Murray’s sentiments when the logo was updated in 2011, “The new interpretation of the logo, at its core, is the exact same essence of the Starbucks experience… What I think we’ve done is that we have allowed her to come out of the circle in a way that I think gives us the freedom and flexibility to think beyond coffee.” Breathing life into the Siren in 2016 and beyond. \nSince her last major design revamp in 2011, the Siren has also been spotted journeying beyond coffee cups to gift cards in special edition Starbucks Cards . \nCreated by Dana Deininger, Senior Designer at Starbucks, the original illustration depicted the Siren in a pencil sketch. In one hand, she clutched a coffee tree branch and in the other, a coffee cup hovered above her hand. Deininger’s drawing captured the Siren lost in her own world and the image transitioned to the cards. Brushstokes of metallic blues and greens in the sea surrounded her and a layer of shimmering gold foil was added to accentuate her tree branch and twin tails. \nWhere does she go from here? While it’s highly likely that within the next 45 years this nautical icon will make another splash with a few more redesigns (and maybe even her own commercial spot!), she will undoubtedly remain true to the consistency of the Starbucks mission and story. As Murray says, “I hope that when people see the Siren on their cup, it stands for what they’re gonna get from Starbucks. If the Siren is on that cup, it’s gonna be awesome.” \nImage credit: iStockPhoto, Starbucks Follow Advertising Week on Twitter: www.twitter.com/advertisingweek More:",

      "text": "Ana Colon Much like seasonal Starbucks cups and all-peppermint-everything, the unveiling of holiday windows in New York are an unimpeachable, ultra-festive tradition. Never mind that, in most cases, the displays are totally unrelated to actual holiday shopping — the spectacle is about creating a festive, ultra-creative, limited-run art installation, basically. (And, of course, it's about the Instagram opportunity.) Every year, we see legendary Manhattan luxury retailers like Saks Fifth Avenue and Bergdorf Goodman join department stores like Macy's and Bloomingdales in decking the windows with more fervor and artistry than any tinsel display you could painstakingly arrange in your living room. There are custom designer gowns, you'll see commissioned art pieces, and even celebrity cameos — at least in the case of Barneys New York's 2016 display, which features appearances from Stan, Cartman, Kyle, Kenny, and more South Park characters. No two windows are the same, based on this year's showing on Fifth Avenue or when looking back at each retailer's past spectacles. This storied stretch of New York real estate has been facing some seriously costly damage since the election. The timing of the 2016 holiday windows is fraught with much uncertainly, but these displays bring passersby a glimmer of optimism.Ahead, check out the most impressive window displays retailers have been cooking up for the holiday season.

BERKELEY — Berkeley police say Starbucks customers helped them capture armed robbers who made off with a woman's laptop.The San Francisco Chronicle reports (http://bit.ly/2f3hPP4) that two Oakland men, ages 19 and 22, were arrested for the apparent robbery at a Starbucks about a mile from the campus of the University of California, Berkeley.Police say witnesses described a man ripping a laptop away from a woman and heading for the exit, but a customer moved to block the door. Police say the apparent robber pulled out a gun and the customer moved away from the door.Police say a Starbucks patron told them a getaway vehicle and driver were waiting for the man. Berkeley Police spokesman Sgt. Andrew Frankel says officers caught up with the bandits and recovered the laptop.___Information from: San Francisco Chronicle, http://www.sfgate.com Most Popular Stories",

      "text": "Happy day before Thanksgiving Eve. Just in case your menu’s not totally set yet, check out these recipes for roast turkey Lady Gaga-style (!!), gingerbread pie crust a la Dominique Ansel, and Ina Garten’s herb and apple bread pudding . In today’s food news: Starbucks quietly hiked its prices, again; Martha and Snoop’s new show gets a second season; Anthony Bourdain’s controversial Thanksgiving plan; and Alton Brown hits Broadway. — Just when you thought your Frappuccino habit couldn’t possibly get more expensive, Starbucks has raised prices again . (Cleverly, they did it right after Election Day while everyone was too busy freaking out to notice.) Prices for approximately 10 percent of the menu, including bakery items and select cold beverages, have gone up by 10 to 30 cents. — Christmas has come early: VH1 has ordered a second season of Martha & Snoop’s Potluck Dinner Party. Now we can all rest easy knowing that more weed jokes, heavy drinking, and perfect Martha snark are just around the corner. — Anthony Bourdain’s perfect Thanksgiving strategy involves not one but two turkeys: an artfully garnished “stunt” turkey that gets presented to the table, and then a bigger backup turkey that’s already carved and ready to be served. But sustainability blog Treehugger argues this is a terrible idea , and destined to contribute to the 204 million pounds of Thanksgiving turkey that will be thrown out this year. (Frankly, roasting two turkeys sounds like a real pain in the ass anyway.) — Alton Brown is making it on Broadway: His Eat Your Science live tour hits Manhattan’s Barrymore Theater tonight and will run there through November 27. ( Tickets are as cheap as $49 , if you’re willing to camp out in the rear mezzanine.) A video posted by Alton Brown (@altonbrown) on Nov 20, 2016 at 1:17pm PST More From Eater",

      "text": "Starbucks Raised Prices While Everyone Was Freaking Out Post-Election Eater 3 hrs ago Whitney Filloon © Provided by Eater Plus, Anthony Bourdain’s turkey strategy\nHappy day before Thanksgiving Eve. Just in case your menu’s not totally set yet, check out these recipes for roast turkey Lady Gaga-style (!!), gingerbread pie crust a la Dominique Ansel, and Ina Garten’s herb and apple bread pudding .\nIn today’s food news: Starbucks quietly hiked its prices, again; Martha and Snoop’s new show gets a second season; Anthony Bourdain’s controversial Thanksgiving plan; and Alton Brown hits Broadway.\n— Just when you thought your Frappuccino habit couldn’t possibly get more expensive, Starbucks has raised prices again . (Cleverly, they did it right after Election Day while everyone was too busy freaking out to notice.) Prices for approximately 10 percent of the menu, including bakery items and select cold beverages, have gone up by 10 to 30 cents.\n— Christmas has come early: VH1 has ordered a second season of Martha & Snoop’s Potluck Dinner Party. Now we can all rest easy knowing that more weed jokes, heavy drinking, and perfect Martha snark are just around the corner.\n— Anthony Bourdain’s perfect Thanksgiving strategy involves not one but two turkeys: an artfully garnished “stunt” turkey that gets presented to the table, and then a bigger backup turkey that’s already carved and ready to be served. But sustainability blog Treehugger argues this is a terrible idea , and destined to contribute to the 204 million pounds of Thanksgiving turkey that will be thrown out this year. (Frankly, roasting two turkeys sounds like a real pain in the ass anyway.)\n— Alton Brown is making it on Broadway: His Eat Your Science live tour hits Manhattan’s Barrymore Theater tonight and will run there through November 27. ( Tickets are as cheap as $49 , if you’re willing to camp out in the rear mezzanine.)\nThis week Eat Your Science hits Broadway for a limited 8 show engagement. Hope to see you there.

      "title": "Starbucks Vs. McDonald's",
      "text": "The two companies have grown into giants. \nMcDonald's is an older and more mature company. \nDoes McDonald's have any wisdom to pass down to Starbucks, and Starbucks investors? There are obvious similarities between McDonald's ( MCD ) and Starbucks ( SBUX ). The global fast serve giants are ubiquitous from U.S. to China and nearly everywhere in between. I've seen some articles comparing the two companies in terms of valuation metrics, dividends and potential growth. Which is the better buy? You can find out here and here if interested. However, I want to take a different perspective. How about comparing the companies in terms of how they have grown globally and how the share price has grown? The reason for this angle is simple. McDonald's is a much older company. It passed the 30,000 locations milestone over ten years ago. At that point in time Starbucks still had under 10,000 locations, but it is catching up quickly, and currently has 23,768 stores. Will the company, and the stock, experience similar growing pains? Starbucks' current store count equates to McDonald's in 1997 when it passed 23,000 total stores and was opening 2000 locations a year ( source ). Starbucks is currently growing at almost the same rate and is expected to open 1,800 locations this year. Eventually the growth will slow as global locations become saturated, as shown here by McDonald's: Click to enlarge Starbucks will at some point catch up and its growth will slow in a similar way. We don't know if it will be at 30,000 locations or 28,000, but it is inevitable. What might this mean for the stock price? The Crashing Giants When McDonald's growth began to slow, it's share price wavered too. From the peak of 1999 to the lows of 2003 the stock fell over 75%. You may say it was due to the stock market crash in the same period, but why then did the stock not crash again during the 2007-2009 decline? The S&P500 fell more during this period, yet McDonald's traded sideways and even made a new all time high in August 2008. We cannot make simple cause and effect formulas for stocks. McDonald's fell 75% between 1999-2003 due to a complex mixture of catalysts which all interacted with positioning in the stock. Slowing growth was just one factor. This is also the case for Starbucks. During the same stock market crashes it had the exact opposite reactions to McDonald's. During 1999-2001 it traded sideways and in 2006-2008 it fell over 80%. Lack of growth was not the reason for the 2006 peak: source: knoema.com The number of stores plateau'd in 2009-2011, but this was after the stock dropped 82%. It would be nice to draw a concise conclusion and comparison from all this data, but I simply can't. If Starbucks hadn't corrected so much in 2006-2008 I'd say a crash was almost certainly due in the next few years based on the McDonald's lead. As it is, both stocks have crashed and this gives them very similar stock cycles even when the growth in the companies are slightly different. Stock Cycles The below chart shows each stock side by side on the time axis. McDonald's IPO'd much before Starbucks. It's largest rally (in percentage points) was into the 1999 peak, after which its main correction began. Starbucks' main growth was from its IPO in 1992 to a 2006 peak when its major decline began. If you move the stocks so that their cycles match, this is what you get: Click to enlarge The stocks have gone through the same growth phase, the same corrective cycle, and the same recovery. It also suggests Starbucks has a lag of a few years and still has some catching up to do. This is supported by the idea that Starbucks is still growing its locations and its share price has the potential to grow further and faster. If we take the analogy further and we equate the Starbucks current total stores and growth to McDonald's in 1997, is the price action similar? The year long consolidation does have similarities, and it's worth keeping an eye on the above chart as a guide as it suggests something very similar to the first comparison. i.e. price is likely to make another high, but the general direction is sideways for another year before a final larger rally. This is helpful to me (I am long). I have always known Starbucks' growth will slow, but I haven't really been able to imagine how this will be reflected in the share price. I'm not sure if we get a very close repeat to the two charts above, but I know where price should be heading. As we have seen, McDonald's is more advanced in its cycle, but it is also repeating the same period as Starbucks is in the above chart. This is because markets and stock cycles are fractal. McDonald's is repeating itself and is rallying into a medium term top just like it did in 1999. Click to enlarge The size and type of the decline is unlikely to be similar to 1999-2003, but I do expect a long pause and sideways consolidation when the current cycle is complete. Conclusions There are as many differences as similarities between McDonald's and Starbucks. Please don't point out in the comments section that one sells hamburgers and one sells coffee. I am looking for similarities in growth and in stock cycles. McDonald's has the lead in both and it can act as a guide for investors. Disclosure: I am/we are long SBUX.

      "text": "\nA Starbucks spokeswoman confirmed on Monday, Nov. 21, that the company raised some of its prices within the first 48 hours following the U.S. presidential election results.\nAccording to TheStreet , the receipts for a Venti red eye coffee with one shot of espresso from multiple New York City Starbucks locations indicated a 6.8 percent increase in price compared to the previous week – starting Nov. 17 the drink cost $5.17; on Nov. 14, the same drink cost $4.84.\n“Prices on all the coffee, frappuccinos, everything went up after Election Day,” a barista told TheStreet. \nThe Starbucks spokeswoman revealed that the company made a price increase of 10 cents to 30 cents on certain bakery items and select cold beverages such as the cold brew on Nov. 10, adding that Starbucks expects the average customer ticket to increase by 0.5 percent due to the adjustments.\n“We continually evaluate pricing on a product-by-product and market-by-market basis in our stores in order to balance our business needs while continuing to provide value to our loyal customers and to attract new customers,” a Starbucks rep told Consumerist. \nCustomers, of course, took to Twitter to voice their opinions:\nIS @Starbucks SERIOUS WITH THIS PRICE HIKE?! My Trenta Iced Coffee, with NOTHING, in it, now costs over $4…\n— Bender, Amanda (@abenderr35) November 10, 2016 \n\nFunny, #starbucks raised their prices starting on election day by almost .50 cents in NYC. Coincidence? I think not.\n— Jen Stuart (@Jpenny4) November 12, 2016 \n\nSome tweets more dramatic than others:\nNews item: Starbucks is raising its prices. The cost of your favorite beverage just went from \"ungodly\" to \"go ahead and sell that kidney.\"\n— Brett Cooper (@OBrettCooper) November 22, 2016 \n\nJust read Starbucks is hiking prices. I guess 15 bucks for a small cup of coffee isn't enough\n— PaleMorningDun (@huntallyear90) November 21, 2016 \n\nOne user, however, exposed a silver lining:\n. @Starbucks is the largest coworking space company\nLocations all over ???? \nFree wifi and ☕️ if you think of your latte price as rental fee\n— Victor Wu (@victorwu416) November 19, 2016 \n\nDespite the increase, approximately 90 percent of the beverages have not changed in price. Prices for hot brewed coffee, tea, espresso, and prepared items have all remained the same. According to the spokeswoman, cold brew coffee has been the same price since it was initially introduced two years ago, until the recent increase.\nSome of you may be thinking, ‘It’s just 30 cents; what’s the big deal?’ And while 30 cents may not seem like a lot, let’s look at the big picture, shall we?\nLast year, Starbucks reportedly raised its prices on most beverages by five to 20 cents. Then in July, the company raised its prices once again, by 30 cents. This third, surprise hike blindsided customers, leaving us all to wonder whether prices will rise again within the next few months.\nIn lieu of price hikes and red cups, Starbucks has found itself stuck in the middle of a political mess.\nOne week before the presidential election – a week before the price hike – Starbucks debuted a green cup intended to encourage unity during what Starbucks’ CEO Howard Schultz described as a “divisive time in our country.”\nHey @Starbucks I think I like the green cups better… #RedCups pic.twitter.com/jeJDEvYpc5 \n— Danielle Elwood (@danielleelwoodd) November 11, 2016 \n\n“The green cup and the design represent the connections Starbucks has as a community with its partners (employees) and customers. During a divisive time in our country, Starbucks wanted to create a symbol of unity as a reminder of our shared values, and the need to be good to each other,” read Shultz official statement.\nInstead of embracing the unity cups, some customers became critical, accusing the chain of “ political brainwashing .”\nApparently the color red connects Jesus to Christmas, and Starbucks is trying to brainwash their customer via coffee cup???? #smh @Starbucks pic.twitter.com/f5qth0ii79 \n— E. B. L. Jensen (@mrsrockford) November 2, 2016 \n\n“We have a culture war to win. I’m a Trump supporter. I thought when Trump won, I might just wake up and America would be great again. Guess what, it wasn’t,” Treadstone told The Washington Post . “We have a lot of work to do. We have hearts and minds to win. Obviously, a lot of people aren’t happy with us, and we need to stand up for our freedom and our First Amendment.”\nIn response to the #TrumpCup drama, Starbucks released a statement claiming that writing customers’ names on cups has been a “fun ritual” at its stores.\n“Rarely has it been abused or taken advantage of. We hope and trust that our customers will continue to honor that tradition,” the Seattle coffee chain said. “We don’t require our partners to write or call out names.”\nJust last week, a video showing a Florida man harassing a Starbucks barista went viral. Real estate remodeler, David Sanguesa told ABD affiliate WPLG that the barista refused to serve him even though he already paid because he is a white, male Trump supporter.\n“Because I voted Trump! Trump! You lost! Now give me my money back,” Sanguesa said, moving toward the register. “What is your name? I want your name. I want your card. You’re garbage. You’re complete trash.”\nIn a statement regarding the incident, Starbucks said that “embracing diversity and treating each other with respect and dignity is core to Starbucks values and something our partners take great pride in showing.”\nSee the video here:\n[Featured Image by Stephen Chernin/Getty Images]\nCustomers Are Pissed About Starbucks’ Sneaky Price Hike is an article from: The Inquisitr News \n",

Snowflakes, reindeer and candy canes are back on Starbucks holiday coffee cups, after last year’s plain red cups caused uproar from critics who said the chain was part of a so-called war on Christmas.

Show Caption Previous Next \nIt's going to cost Starbucks customers a little extra to quench their cold drink craving and satisfy their sweet tooth. \nA Starbucks spokesperson confirmed on Tuesday to the TheStreet.com that prices on select cold drinks and baked goods went up Nov. 10 without any formal announcement. Customers can expect to pay between 10 to 30 cents more at the register. \n\nThis is the second time Starbucks increased its prices this year. In July, Starbucks raised prices by up to 30 cents on certain brewed coffees, espresso and tea lattes. \nThe most recent price hike came without warning, though, and some customers questioned the necessity of another cost increase so soon. \n— Sue McElligott (@SueMacArtist) November 22, 2016 #starbucks must you raise the price of cold drinks? I already feel I am getting less for my money getting cold given it's mostly water... — Lucy Sky (@PaperbackLucy) November 22, 2016 #Starbucks taught the world $5 is acceptable for a (commodity) cup of coffee. Now it will watch us line up every 6 mos for price increases. — Randall E. King (@randallking) November 22, 2016 Copyright 2016 Scripps Media, Inc. All rights reserved.

      "text": "Starbucks Cup Prompts Fresh Controversy Ask a barista to write 'Trump' on your latte and see what happens November 22, 2016 by Zachary Leeman | 22 Nov 2016 at 3:56 PM \nWith Donald Trump preparing to take office, the culture war seems to be hitting a fever pitch. It appears Starbucks finds itself in the midst of another tug-of-war contest between Trump supporters and detractors. \nTim Treadstone, a political strategist, started the social media campaign, #TrumpCup. After a Starbucks customer gave “Trump” as the name to be written on his ordered drink and later shouted it out when ready, the employees refused and even called the cops. This sparked Treadstone, who goes by @bakedalaska on Twitter, to rally the troops. \n\"Starbucks called the cops on this guy for wanting Trump on his cup, everyone go get a #TrumpCup now! This a movement,\" he tweeted. \nCountless tweets followed with the hashtag as Trump supporters around the country asked that \"Trump\" be scrawled on their cups, too, so they could post the pictures to social media. \n#TrumpCup has gotten people on both sides of the aisle fired up. \"I work at the Starbucks in Lexington, Kentucky, and if anybody asks me to write Trump on their cup I will spit in it #TrumpCup,\" tweeted @sammontgomery. I work at the Starbucks in Lexington, Kentucky and if anybody asks me to write Trump on their cup I will spit in it #TrumpCup — Sam Montgomery (@sammontgomery) November 18, 2016 \n\"Very telling how liberals are responding to #TrumpCup we're just trying to make a statement. It's not okay for cops to be called over a cup,\" tweeted @latinaafortrump. \nWhile many on the Left have laughed off #TrumpCup, saying it is a contradictory boycott, Treadstone clarified that a boycott was never the point. \n\"This was never meant to be a boycott. I love Starbucks. I have no intention to stray any business from Starbucks at all,\" he told The Washington Post. \nFor him and other Trump supporters, it is more about the culture war that is firing up as polarization is hitting the masses harder than before. \n\"We have a culture war to win. I’m a Trump supporter. I thought when Trump won, I might just wake up and America would be great again. Guess what? It wasn’t. We have a lot of work to do. We have hearts and minds to win. Obviously, a lot of people aren’t happy with us, and we need to stand up for our freedom and our First Amendment,\" Treadstone told The Post. 1) Go to Starbucks & tell them your name is Trump2) If they refuse take videoPls share & spread the word pic.twitter.com/huPj4g6cqY — Baked Alaska™ (@bakedalaska) November 18, 2016 \nTreadstone’s initial tweet came out on Friday and already Starbucks has released a statement in response. It calls the writing of customers’ names on cups a \"fun ritual\" and not something required. \"We don’t require our partners to write or call out names,\" the coffee giant said. It continued, \"Rarely has it been abused or taken advantage of. We hope and trust that our customers will continue to honor that tradition.\" \nThe #TrumpCup phenomenon is not entirely without merit or history. Last year, when Starbucks introduced its winter cups, some were upset at the simple red design lacking anything resembling Christmas. It was seen as yet another company fearing to step on the toes of the politically correct. \nCustomers then would go in and say their names were \"Merry Christmas\" to get the phrase written on the cup and said out loud in the coffee shops. Like #TrumpCup, supporters of the movement posted pictures of their \"Merry Christmas\" cups to social media and got the movement trending on social media. \nEven Donald Trump commented on the phenomenon at the time, suggesting a boycott of Starbucks and saying if he won the presidency, \"We’re all going to be saying ‘Merry Christmas’ again.\" \nFor Treadstone, #TrumpCup boils down to a much simpler issue. \"If you’re so afraid to write your president’s name on a coffee cup, that is sad — that’s insane.\" #Starbucks",

      "text": "TechCrunch Gift Guide 2016 \nLast year, Ember Technologies Inc. ran a crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo to build a mug that keeps hot drinks at the perfect sipping temperature. By now, it’s sold 4,000 of these devices. \nAnd in something of a coup for the startup, Starbucks Corp. has begun selling Ember Temperature Control Mugs in its stores across most of the U.S. and online for $149.95. \nWhether it’s coffee, cocoa or tea, hot drinks are usually prepared and served around 160-deegrees Fahrenheit, said Ember CEO Clay Alexander and that’s how cafes and restaurants mostly serve them. Yet, people like to drink hot beverages closer to 130-degrees. \nCommonly available thermoses work with simple insulation, but they heat unevenly and don’t cool drinks when they are searing, resulting in plenty of burnt tongues. Ember works with semiconductors inside to bring a drink to the ideal temp and hold it there it for hours, Alexander said. Ember temperature control mug on its charging base. \nOut of the box, the Ember mug needs to be charged one time. It is then ready to use. There is an optional mobile app that works in conjunction with the mug. A dial on the bottom allows users to set their preferred temperature on the mug. There are no buttons or moving parts otherwise. \nTo get their products sold at Starbucks was no easy feat, Alexander said. The coffee giants have a rigorous product evaluation and testing process, encompassing safety, quality and coffee tasting tests, and audits of startups that want to work with Starbucks. \nAlexander told TechCrunch that the deal only happened with the help of his board of directors and investors. Working with the design consultancy Ammunition didn’t hurt, either, he said. Ember has raised funding from celebrity investors including Demi Lovato , Nick and Joe Jonas and the DJ Cascade, among others. \nAdditional temperature control products are in development using Ember’s patented systems. The startup wants people to be able to warm or cool liquids of every kind, without requiring any ice or open flames. So stay tuned for temp controlled baby bottles, serving dishes and more, Alexander said.",

      "text": "Starbucks Just Raised The Prices On Select Menu Items 2 hours ago share \nStarbucks we love you and your coffee so much, but why you gotta keep raising prices on us?! So for fellow Starbucks lovers this news is for you.Prices have been raised 10 to 30 cents on certain cold drinks and baked goods, as of November 10th. But, don't get too upset because 90% of the beverages including hot coffee and tea are not effected.This is the second time the company has raised prices this year, back in July there was a similar price increase on espresso, latte, and coffee drinks.Admit it, you're still going to drink Starbucks happily ever with the slight increase. Plus it is red cup season! Listen... the enchanted birch forest is calling. #RedCups pic.twitter.com/reUbiiov7o — Starbucks Coffee (@Starbucks) November 17, 2016 Born in Eastern Oklahoma, his family relocated to the Orange, Tx. area at the age of 6 months, a local boy, raised in Southeast Texas. Patrick's wanted to be a 'radio DJ' since he was 10 yrs old, starting out at age 17, Patrick found his first job at a local Christian radio station in Beaumont, Tx in 1991. According to Patrick, once he got a taste of what it was like to be an on air talent/DJ there was nothing else he wanted to be. After a 2 yr stint, Patrick would then go onto a local Top 40 radio station where he practiced his skills at all hours of the day & night, getting off the air at 12 midnight and staying at the studio til the morning show guys would show up for their shift at 6am. \"I can't tell you how many nights I slept in the studio waiting to do my shift, just wanting to be there in and around everything radio. I feel like I was born to do it\". After spending 19 years there, he can now be heard weekday afternoons, 3-7pm, on the New 104.5 KISS FM. Contact ",

The great news is now you can do a lot more things on your mobile device with the launch of the Chase Pay App, which is basically a digital payment solution for both online, in-app, and in store purchases. While the stores where you can use the app is still few, the bank promises to add more in the future.\nFor now, the Chase Pay App can be used to make payments using QR codes at selected Starbucks and Best Buy stores. Using codes or something similar to that is probably not the most ideal solution for mobile payment gateways, but it’s what they have for now. You will also be able to use it to reload your Starbucks card through the Starbucks mobile app or online at Starbucks.com. These are just a few things, but if you frequent either establishments a lot, then might as well try it out.\nOnce you’ve downloaded the Chase Pay App, you need to sign in using the same log-in details on your chase.com account. Once you do, all the cards and accounts that you linked there will be loaded on the app already. That’s including Chase Visa Credit, Debit, and Liquid cards. You’ll also be able to use Touch ID later on when you use the app to make it more convenient.\nChase will be adding more merchants soon, specifically Phillips 66®, Conoco®, 76®, Walmart®, ShopRite® and The Fresh Grocer®, and also participating Shell stations. You can download the Chase Pay app from the Google Play Store for free.\nSOURCE: Chase",

      "text": "Starbucks Hikes Prices Again (SBUX) By Dan Moskowitz | November 21, 2016 — 11:53 PM EST \nIn July, Starbucks Corporation ( SBUX ) hiked prices on espresso and latte beverages in by $0.10-$0.30, and on select sizes of coffee by $0.10-$0.20. It announced another price hike of $0.10-$0.30 on November 10 for certain cold drinks and baked goods. It should be noted that the recent price hike is only for 10% of Starbucks items, but customers still aren’t likely to be pleased, especially if one of those items is their daily fix or treat. \nThe drought in Brazil might have played a role due to the increased cost of beans. Another factor could simply be high demand . This is the opposite of what's taking place for many retailers right now. Due to today’s cost-conscious consumer and increased competition, most retailers are highly promotional, which is the only way to maintain traffic. A third potential reason for the price hike could be reduced traffic due to the election and a Trump-supporter boycott of the brand. If that’s the case, then Starbucks is hiking prices on its loyal customers in order to make up for the lost traffic, knowing that those loyal customers will pay the premium because Starbucks is an important part of their daily lives. \nIn most cases, it’s easy to apply logic to figure out why a company is making a certain decision, but in this case, there is no way of knowing the real reason for the price hike. \nA Starbucks spokeswoman told CNBC, “We expect the average customer ticket to increase by about 0.5 percent as a result of these beverage adjustments. Approximately 90 percent of beverages have not changed price. For example hot brewed coffee, espresso, tea or prepared items were not impacted.” \nStarbucks also released the following statement: “We continually evaluate pricing on a product-by-product and market-by-market basis in our stores in order to balance our business needs while continuing to provide value to our loyal customers and to attract new customers.” \nSBUX has depreciated 10.97% over the past 12 months and currently offers a dividend yield of 1.80%.",

      "text": "A Starbucks spokeswoman confirmed on Monday that the company raised some of its prices in the 48 hours following the U.S. presidential election results.\nSpeaking to finance publication The Street , a spokesperson for the company reported a price increase of between 10 and 30 cents on selected cold brews, cold drinks, and baked goods, effective Nov. 10 at most stores.\nSome customers took to Twitter to express their thoughts on the decision. “IS @ Starbucks SERIOUS WITH THIS PRICE HIKE?! My Trenta Iced Coffee, with NOTHING, in it, now costs over $4…” said one customer.\n“The cost of your favorite beverage just went from ‘ungodly’ to ‘go ahead and sell that kidney,'” said another.\nMeanwhile, at least one Twitter user seemed to be pointing out that despite the rise in prices, Starbucks remains a pretty good deal, considering its position as what he called the world’s “largest coworking space,” with free wi-fi.\nThe reason for the unpopularity is that Starbucks sbux has already increased its prices this year, with the cost of drinks going up by up to 30 cents in some cases in July—the company citing rising operational and coffee costs.\nSome items such as cold brew coffee had maintained the same price for the last two years until the recent change, a spokeswoman told The Street.\nThe earlier price hike suffered a minor snafu when point-of-sale price points were prematurely adjusted in machines before the official news was released—again, stealthily, late on a Friday in the lead up to a long weekend, Fortune’s Phil Wahba reported.\nFor more on Starbucks, watch Fortune’s video:\nLast year, Starbucks raised prices on most beverages by between 5 and 20 cents. 2016’s relatively large increase is the latest in a long line of confident moves by the coffee behemoth, which has been having an extremely good year by anyone’s standards, outperforming Wall Street predictions and projecting better results for the 2017 financial year.\nRelative to its own past performance, however, things are not so rosy: despite sales at stores open for longer than a year growing 4% in the fourth quarter of 2016, the figure falls 0.9% short of analyst-anticipated growth.\nSo the recent price raise can at least in part be attributed to a slump in predicted growth trajectory. Analysts say this has sparked fears of a recession in the food and beverage industry, as Starbucks’ performance is seen as a kind of barometer.\nIn its defense, Starbucks is forecasting that the average customer receipt will only go up by about 0.5% as a result of the change.",

      "text": "Starbucks patrons help Berkeley police capture of 2 bandits San Francisco Chronicle 9 hrs ago By Sarah Ravani © Artur Widak/NurPhoto/Getty Images File photo of a Starbucks sign. A pair of robbers were arrested with the help of Starbucks patrons after one of them snatched a woman’s laptop from inside the Berkeley coffee shop and pulled a gun on another customer who tried to stop him from fleeing to a getaway car, officials said.\nDelamontae Stewart, 22, and Zachery Haliburton, 19, both Oakland residents, were arrested on suspicion of robbery and possession of stolen property, police said.\nBerkeley police officers received calls about 4:20 p.m. Saturday of an armed robbery inside a Starbucks on the 3000 block of Telegraph Avenue, about a mile away from the UC Berkeley campus.\nWitnesses reported a woman struggling with a man, identified as Stewart, over her laptop, officials said. The suspected robber allegedly ripped the laptop away from the victim and headed for the exit, police said.\nAs Stewart attempted to run out of the establishment, a patron blocked the door, police said. Stewart pulled a gun and the patron moved away from the door, police said.\nThe Starbucks patron alerted police that Stewart jumped into a waiting vehicle, driven by a man later identified as Haliburton, and went east on Ashby Avenue, said Sgt. Andrew Frankel, a spokesman for the Berkeley Police Department.\nPolice caught up with the bandits near the intersection of Ashby Avenue and Domingo Street, less than a mile away from the scene of the robbery.\nThe stolen laptop and a pellet gun were recovered from inside the car.\nStewart and Haliburton were booked into the Berkeley City Jail. They are both scheduled to be arraigned Tuesday.\nSarah Ravani is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer. Email: sravani@sfchronicle.com Twitter: @SarRavani\nGo to MSN Home",

      "text": "Operated by smart, honest, forward-thinking management \nS \nSells for an attractive price Click to enlarge Starbucks is doing a lot things right: opening new stores (2,100 net new stores globally in fiscal 2017), experimenting with new innovative store concepts (upscale Starbucks Reserve stores), expanding its breakfast and lunch menus, and more, to provide customers a unique experience. The business has favorable long-term prospects, and an experienced management team that will build up the Starbucks brand and take it to the next level. Here's what CEO Howard Schultz had to say about the 4% U.S. same-store sales in Q4 during the conference call : \n\"Can I add one thing? Without putting anyone on the defensive and recognizing this is like the third rail, I would just ask you to consider that for a company our size and the track record that we have had domestically and now internationally, and as Kevin (President and COO) said in his remarks, the fact that our business went up on our scale during this quarter in every day-part. \n\"And if you look at our history of trying to do everything we can to really add shareholder value in everything we do, to just try and just take a step back every now and then and recognize that comp store sales, although we all recognize its importance, is not the driving force of a company that did $20 billion in revenue and $4 billion in operating profit and is adding a store a day in China and is on its way to building one of the most recognized and admired brands in the world. And yet, we're so focused on something that, yes, it is important and it is strategic, but it is not everything. So just maybe every now and then recognize that we will have comps that will over-achieve and we'll have some comps that probably will disappoint. \n\"But we are here for the long game. This is a 24th year of our public life. The company had a market cap of $250 million at that point. It's at almost $80 billion today. And it's just the beginning. So maybe every now and then just recognize we're all in this together and comps is not the end all of everything.\" There's much more to Starbucks than comp numbers, as Mr. Schultz argued, for example, Starbucks' consumer packaged goods (NYSE: CPG ) business and servicing China. These are two areas that still have much room for growth. Reshaping China's coffee and tea culture Starbucks is delivering strong revenues, profits, comp growth and ROI (>60%) in China. But China is in the early stages of development and there's still plenty of growth to be tapped. Starbucks recently launched Teavana beverages and teas in China (and Asia-Pacific regions) to accommodate the nation's traditional tea-drinking culture. Starbucks purchased Teavana in 2012 for $620 million and operates about 300 Teavana branded stores in Canada and the U.S. There are no Teavana branded stores in China, but I believe in the coming years, Starbucks will consider opening Teavana stores to further address China's $9.5 billion tea market that's estimated to grow at 4% per year to 2020. Additionally, the partnership with Chinese noodles and beverage company Tingyi will extend the reach of Starbucks ready-to-drink portfolio to Chinese consumers. Starbucks opened its first coffee shop in China in 1999. Today, there's 2,400 stores with plans in place to open 2,500 more stores by 2021. China's fast-growing middle class, rising disposable incomes, and the country's transition to a consumer-driven economy should benefit Starbucks, McDonald's, KFC, and other foodservice brands. Click to enlarge Source: Company reports Shopping for Starbucks drinks Starbucks' CPG business doesn't get quite as much attention, but it's a valuable differentiating factor when compared to competitors such as McDonald's, KFC and Restaurant Brands International (Burger King and Tim Hortons). McDonald's and Tim Hortons, for example, sell packaged ground coffee and K-Cups, but that's about it. Starbucks leads those two markets with brands such as Pike Place Roast, Starbucks Reserve, Seattle's Best Coffee, and Torrefazione Italia. Starbucks has started to extend its packaged product portfolio by entering the coffee, tea, and fruit ready-to-drink market under various brands (e.g. Evolution Fresh, Cold Brew, Tazo, Teavana). Starbucks is now competing against PepsiCo, Coca-Cola, and Dr Pepper and Snapple, all of which sell their own ready-to-drink coffee and teas. Source: Starbucks The CPG business registered revenues of $1.49 billion in fiscal 2016, up 12% from last year, and returning good volume and price growth (and greater share) in grocery stores. Starbucks has about 500 signature aisles in grocery stores and I expect this number to grow as Starbucks pushes its iced coffees and teas, fruit smoothies, and other ready-to-drink beverages onto every Wal-Mart, Whole Foods, Safeway, and Loblaws shelf over the long run. Starbucks is quickly becoming a larger CPG company with its own distribution and retail network. The announced PepsiCo, Tingyi, and Anheuser-Busch partnerships will broaden Starbucks CPG business and take it into new and existing markets. Click to enlarge Starbucks coffee aisle at Safeway. Source: Company reports, SupermarketNews Starbucks was never cheap I often hear that Starbucks' stock is expensive with a price-to-earnings multiple of ~30x (forward P/E at ~25x) compared to S&P 500 at 20x earnings. They say they will wait until the stock gets cheaper. But when was it ever cheap in the first place? Historically, Starbucks has never traded for less than 20x earnings since its IPO in 1992. If you're waiting to pick the bottom on Starbucks, then your timing the market, and that puts you at risk of possibly missing the stocks top-performing days. Timing the market can be costly, and instead, I recommend adopting a disciplined approach to long-term investing: Buy and hold. Starbucks has underperformed this year, but we have seen companies underperform in the past. If you look back, Starbucks has been one of the best performers in the S&P 500 for the last 20 years. An initial investment of $10,000 into Starbucks 10 years ago, would have grown to $31,401.87 today. This is a price-only return of 214.02% (excluding dividends). Investing in Starbucks 20 years ago, your $10,000 investment would have grown to $253,866.67 today. This is the power of compound interest, and long-term investing. I discussed market timing in a recent article called, \" Donald Trump, Black Swans, and Fortune Tellers \" So, what's Starbucks' stock worth? My valuation arrived at a target price of $65.00 (14% upside potential from the current market price) versus consensus of $64.50. I applied a target EV/EBITDA multiple of 17x to my 2017e EBITDA of $5.7 billion, which is at a premium to Starbucks' restaurant peer group average. I believe Starbucks deserves a premium valuation because of its market leadership, relative gross margin profile (60.1% in FY16), strong comparable store sales growth (4% to 6%), and compelling growth trajectory over the medium-to-long term in coffee and tea markets globally. My assumptions include a 7% 2017e EBITDA growth rate, share buybacks reducing 2017e shares O/S (f.d) by 1.5%, and keeping net debt constant. Figure 1: Comparables Figure 2: Starbucks valuation Figure 3: Sensitivity analysis This is my valuation and it may give you an idea on Starbucks' value and forward return trajectory. What it doesn't tell you is the path to $65. The stock could climb and run past my target price easily or the stock could decline before reaching my valuation. No one can accurately tell you where the market will go and the actual magnitude of future returns. What I do know is that in 5 years, 10 years, and 20 years from now, Starbucks will be generating more sales by selling more coffee and tea globally. Starbucks is a well-managed business, with stable competitive position, excellent brands, predictable cash flows and high returns on invested capital. If you understand what makes the business great, then it will be much easier for you to determine when the business is no longer great, and it's time for you to sell the stock. Starbucks' stock is trading at 30x earnings, is down 5% this year, and is underperforming the S&P 500 by 13.3%. Should you sell the stock? The answer is a resounding no. Buy and hold.

Snowflakes, reindeer and candy canes are back on Starbucks holiday coffee cups, after last year’s plain red cups caused uproar from critics who said the chain was part of a so-called war on Christmas.

Show Caption Previous Next \nIt's going to cost Starbucks customers a little extra to quench their cold drink craving and satisfy their sweet tooth. \nA Starbucks spokesperson confirmed on Tuesday to the TheStreet.com that prices on select cold drinks and baked goods went up Nov. 10 without any formal announcement. Customers can expect to pay between 10 to 30 cents more at the register. \n\nThis is the second time Starbucks increased its prices this year. In July, Starbucks raised prices by up to 30 cents on certain brewed coffees, espresso and tea lattes. \nThe most recent price hike came without warning, though, and some customers questioned the necessity of another cost increase so soon. \n— Sue McElligott (@SueMacArtist) November 22, 2016 #starbucks must you raise the price of cold drinks? I already feel I am getting less for my money getting cold given it's mostly water... — Lucy Sky (@PaperbackLucy) November 22, 2016 #Starbucks taught the world $5 is acceptable for a (commodity) cup of coffee.

Police say witnesses described a man ripping a laptop away from a woman and heading for the exit, but a customer moved to block the door. Police say the apparent robber pulled out a gun and the customer moved away from the door. Police say a Starbucks patron told them a getaway vehicle and driver were waiting for the man. Berkeley Police spokesman Sgt. Andrew Frankel says officers caught up with the bandits and recovered the laptop. ___ Information from: San Francisco Chronicle, http://www.sfgate.com Latest from the SFGATE homepage: Click below for the top news from around the Bay Area and beyond.

      "text": "Starbucks Again Flexes Its Pricing Muscle Nov.23.16 \nStarbucks recently issued another price hike on select products. \nStarbucks is leveraging its powerful brand power to drive margin and cash flows higher. \nAre shares a buy at these prices? News spread shortly after the US election, that customers had noticed that prices for various beverages at their local Starbucks (NYSE: SBUX ) had gone up. Reported by The Street on Monday, and confirmed by Starbucks on Tuesday - Starbucks did issue a 10-30 cent raise on prices for certain cold drinks, and bakery goods. This marks the second time this year, that Starbucks has issued a price increase. Click to enlarge Starbucks is continually raising prices - once in 2014, again in 2015, and twice in 2016. The multiple price increases in 2016 were issued in order to protect healthy operating margins after major cost increases hit over the summer in the form of wage increases , and the rise of coffee prices. Coffee prices have risen steadily since winter. Click to enlarge source: CNBC The price increases helped Starbucks improve on profitability, as documented in its recent filing of Q4 earnings. Starbucks managed a 180 basis point improvement on operating margin over Q4 of last year (now up to 21.5%). For fiscal year 2016, Starbucks has expanded its margin 80 basis points to 19.6% Maintaining (and expanding) these robust margins while Starbucks continues to expand across the globe (primary focus being China) has continually boosted Starbucks' cash flows and earnings growth. Cash flows for 2016 have risen to $4.57B from $3.74B, and non-GAAP earnings per share are up 17% over fiscal year 2015 to $1.85 per share. Maintaining margins is a key component to driving growth forward. Starbucks is still rapidly expanding with 2,042 new stores opened company wide in 2016, and another 2,100 stores targeted to open in 2017. Starbucks has been able to do this while aggressively growing its dividend, and maintaining a very strong balance sheet with total debt of only $3.6B. Starbucks' debt is well covered by its cash flows, giving it flexibility to continue aggressive expansion. While there is fair concern about whether customers will get fed up with Starbucks' continual price increases, Starbucks puts tremendous focus on maintaining the Starbucks brand. Both its mobile app payment system, and Starbucks Rewards program are seeing continued growth. Customers enjoy the inviting atmosphere that Starbucks provides, as it has become a popular place for customers to \"set up shop\" and work/study while having coffee. These programs, combined with the atmosphere Starbucks stores provides for customers - should optimize customer retention, and help minimize those who leave the brand for cost effective alternatives like Dunkin' Brands Group (Dunkin' Donuts)(NYSE: DNKN ), or McDonald's Corp. (NYSE: MCD ). Click to enlarge This combination of premium product, atmosphere, and customer service is currently unmatched in the industry. Median households have finally started to rise again , and consumer spending is expected to continue rising as well. This should further help customers absorb price increases that will likely continue into the future. Click to enlarge The dividend was recently boosted by management to the tune of a 25% increase. This is consistent with previous hikes, as the dividend is growing at about 30% annually going back 10 years. With earnings expected to grow at a slightly lesser rate of 16-17% over the next five years, the dividend may slow down slightly from its torrid pace moving forward. The biggest problem with Starbucks shares at the moment is the price. Starbucks is currently trading at 27X next year's earnings. This valuation prices in very high expectations that could send shares tumbling at the first sign of imperfection. Starbucks is a fantastic company with many years of quality growth ahead of it. However, the past 5 years of growth is a tough act to follow. International expansion - specifically China must work like a charm. I would be a buyer at 23X earnings which would place the price in the high $40s. I understand that it will likely take a nice size market correction to get there, but a fantastic company can be a poor investment if you pay too much.

      "title": "Ember Mug Sold At Starbucks Will Keep Drink At Your Preferred Temperature For Hours",
      "text": "11/23/16 AT 11:35 AM Close \nEmber Technologies recently released a fancy mug to keep your coffee or tea at your preferred temperature for hours, which you can buy at Starbucks . \nThe leak-proof, portable mug keeps your drink at the temperature you want for up to two hours or all day if it’s connected to its charging coaster. \nThe fancy mug has a sleek black look and has no buttons or with complicated instructions to keep your drink warm. The temperature is featured on the mug’s lit display and coffee lovers just need to rotate the dial on the bottom of the mug to the temperature they want. Ember say its design allows consumer feel like they’re drinking from a ceramic mug with its “perfect lip interface and a 360° drinking experience.” \nThe mug can also be controlled by Ember’s smartphone or smartwatch app. With the app, you can adjust the temperature remotely, choose and save temperature presets for different drinks and allows you to name your mug. \nThe Ember mug is the first of its kind and it costs $149.95. \n“The release of the Ember mug is seven years in the making. I started Ember to solve a simple yet universal challenge faced by coffee and tea drinkers everywhere - how can I keep my hot beverage at the ideal temperature for as long as I want,” said Ember Technologies Founder and CEO Clay Alexander in a press release . \nEmber's new mug that keeps drinks at preferred temperature now sold a Starbucks. Photo: Ember Technologies Related Stories Millennials, Climate Change May Be Killing The World's Coffee Supply \nEmber notes on its website the average serving temperature for coffee is 160 degrees fahrenheit, yet the average preferred drinking temperature is around 135 degrees fahrenheit. \n“We put so much effort into making that perfect cup of coffee, so why do we go and pour it into a paper cup or mug only to end up with a coffee that’s scalding hot or lukewarm?” Alexander, who has a background in thermoscience, said in a promo . \nThe Ember has a stainless steel inner vessel, patented microprocessor controlled heating system and the mug’s lid has a push to open mechanism. The Ember mug comes with a charging coaster and high capacity battery, and was designed by Ammunition Group, the same people that designed the Beats by Dre headphones. \nThe mugs are sold at Starbucks stores (check map to see which ones) and the Ember and Starbucks websites.

      "text": "Summary \nStarbucks is set for its first close above its 200-day moving average in over 7 months. \nDespite a massive rally in coffee prices this year, the stock has managed to hold its weekly support at $52.00. \nThe company continues to report growing earnings each year, as well as earnings growth over their previous year's quarters. In a year when coffee prices (NYSEARCA: JO ) have seen a 20% YTD return, Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX ) is still managing to stand its ground. While the stock has certainly not had a year for shareholders to write home about, the slightly negative year to date return is not cause for worry. The stock has been one of the best performers for the past 7 years, posting a 1000% plus return since mid 2009. The stock has been consolidating between a range of $51 and $63 since late 2015, and this is perfectly normal after the run it has had. Click to enlarge Click to enlarge (Source: TC2000.com) Starbucks used to be everyone's most loved company on the long side, but it seems that sentiment came to a screeching halt this year. There has been a wealth of writers recommending shorts on the stock, and even longs have begun to get a little nervous. Just this week CNBC's Dan Nathan recommended a bearish options trade on the stock, with a break-even on the trade of $54.00. With the majority turning bearish despite the stock remaining above support, I am looking the other way. I went long Starbucks stock yesterday at $56.50 as it finally regained its 200-day moving average. Click to enlarge (Source: TC2000.com) My strategy for trading stocks is a trend-following approach as I'm a huge proponent of Richard Dennis. Richard Dennis was a commodities speculator known as the \"Prince of the Pit\" at the Chicago Board of Trade. He had a remarkable career , becoming a millionaire before the age of 26. Richard Dennis later taught complete strangers to trade his Turtle Trading Strategy . Some of the original \"Turtles\" still trade today and have seen massive success from his teachings. Jerry Parker (one of Dennis's disciples) founded Chesapeake Capital in 1988, and currently manages over $1.5 billion. Dennis's success came from his style of hitting massive home run trades on his winners, despite several strikeouts. His strategy was to let his winners run as long as they remained in an uptrend, and cut his losers as soon as they invalidated their uptrend. I have tweaked Dennis's Turtle Trading system in a few ways to better adapt to current markets, and my risk profile. Despite this being a purely technical system, this does not mean I ignore fundamentals. I am also a large believer in William O'Neil's CANSLIM method, and use the \"CAN\" to help select fundamentally strong stocks. The \"CAN\" in his CANSLIM method stands for the following: C - Current Earnings : William pointed out the importance of choosing stocks whose earnings per share (EPS) in their most recent quarter had grown from the previous year. A - Annual Earnings : William also believed annual earnings growth to be very important. Companies being selected for investments according to William should have good annual earnings growth over the past 5 years. As William stated \"Who wants to own part of an establishment showing no growth?\" Due to this, William recommended buying stocks with annual earnings growth of at least 25%. N - New : The N in Williams CANSLIM stock selection approach stood for new, which meant the company recently underwent a change of some type. Whether it be a new product, entering a new market, or a new high in price. In my application of this method, I place the most emphasis on a new high in price as this confirms my primary trading strategy. By combining these two systems, I am able to find fundamentally strong stocks, while timing my entries to generate maximum returns. While most buy and hold investors simply buy good companies and hold for the long term, I wait for confirmation to buy. My confirmation signal is new 3-month highs for the stock, while it trades above its 50-day and 200-day moving averages. Putting Starbucks Through The \"CAN\" Screener Click to enlarge (Source: YCharts.com) C - Current Earnings : As we can see from the above table, Starbucks is a perfect fit for O'Neil's \"C\" requirements. The company has seen growth over all of its previous quarters, and by a wide margin in most cases. Starbucks saw diluted EPS increase 25% in Q3 over the prior year, as well as 24% diluted EPS growth in their Q2 report. I believe this to be extremely impressive given the fact the company is facing headwinds from strength in the price of coffee. Click to enlarge A - Annual Earnings : Zooming out to annual earnings, we can see that growth is not quite up to O'Neil's preferred 25% year over year. Having said that, the company continues to grow diluted EPS year over year, despite also increasing its yield. Starbucks reported $1.63 in diluted EPS last year, and is currently on track to beat that number. The company has reported $1.44 in earnings thus far in the first nine months, and should see more than $0.50 of diluted EPS in Q4. This would place their full year earnings at $1.94, giving them a roughly 20% growth rate in annual earnings over last year. Click to enlarge (Source: TC2000.com) N - New : In terms of the new category, Starbucks has several new positive developments technically. The stock is currently on track for its first close above its 40-week moving average in six months, while the stock makes new 3-month highs. My buy signal for stocks comes when they make new 3-month highs, and my line in the sand for bull and bear markets is the 40-week moving average. These two developments are very bullish for investors in Starbucks, and I expect that the stock will begin to play catch-up with the market going forward. Technical Outlook & Summary Taking a look at the daily chart of Starbucks, we can see that the stock has been locked in a down-sloping channel. This down-sloping channel has obvious lower lows and lower highs, but Starbucks looking to be challenging the top of this channel currently. What's different about this current down-sloping channel test is that the stock is already well above its 200-day moving average (yellow line). This is a very good sign for the channel test as a close above the 200-day moving average puts the momentum back into most stocks. Click to enlarge (Source: TC2000.com) As we can see in the past 2 times the stock got near the top of the channel, Starbucks came up short at its 200-day moving average. Despite poking its head slightly above this level in intra-day trading, it was a brick wall of resistance when it came to closing above it. The fact that Starbucks closed above the 200-day moving average with a vengeance yesterday, tells me that this is likely the beginning of a new uptrend. So what if I am wrong on Starbucks? If I am wrong on this long position from $56.50, I always have a stop on my trade. This is done to protect myself, as the goal of trend following is to cut your losers quickly. My method of placing a stop is to find a level where I believe my trade thesis to be invalidated. Before I enter any long position on a stock, I want to know what my maximum pain is if the trade goes sour. Without knowing my maximum pain, there is no possible way to know how much of a stock I am going to buy. Given my risk profile, I only allow myself 1.0% 1.2% portfolio risk on any one trade. The goal of trend following is to stay in the game as long as possible, in order to give enough time to exploit the edge provided by trend following. My winners tend to be 3 times the size of my losers, which allows me to have a 60% win/loss ratio and still be very profitable. My 1.0 - 1.2 rule is in place to protect myself from losing streaks, and to ensure one bad losing streak does not wipe me out. If my risk on each trade was 10% of my account, one bad distribution of winners to losers could bankrupt my portfolio. My stop on my Starbucks trade is at $50.83 which gives me a risk of $5.67 from my entry at $56.50. This means that I am allowed to use a position size of 10-11% of my account to enter Starbucks to stay within my 1.0 - 1.2 rule. I have shown an example of how I calculate this above to help readers understand my position sizing example better. Given the fact that I bought 100 shares of Starbucks at $56.50, my total risk on this trade is 1.13% of my portfolio. The reason I have used a stop below the $50.83 level is for 2 reasons: Click to enlarge (Source: TC2000.com) 1) A close below $50.83 would completely invalidate this 3-month high breakout, and see the stock well below its 200-day moving average. 2) A close below $50.83 would also constitute new 52-week lows for the stock, and I have no interest in being long from 52-week lows. I believe Starbucks to be an excellent long candidate for those looking for a growth stock for their accounts. While growth has tapered off in the past 2 years, the company is still maintaining modest growth while continuing to raise its dividend. The technical backdrop on the stock has switched to bullish this week, and I believe there is a good chance a new uptrend is beginning. If coffee prices continue to decline from their elevated sentiment readings of 90% bulls during October, this would also help Starbucks bottom line. Despite many looking to the short side on Starbucks, I am taking a stab at the stock from the long side. If I am wrong my downside is protected, and if I'm right I have a low risk entry in a solid company with momentum behind it. (Source: TC2000.com) For full transparency I have shown all of my equity positions above that I have highlighted in the past 12 months in my articles. As you can see while I have only slightly more winners than losers, my winners tend to be much larger than my losers. This is the reason that trend following remains my favorite strategy for my actively managed accounts. Disclosure: I am/we are long SBUX.

      "text": "Starbucks fans, you won’t be pleased about this devastating news The last thing you want to hear during the most expensive time of year is that your favorite coffee drink is going up in price, but that’s the sad news we have to deliver today from Starbucks . The company quietly raised prices on many of its cold beverages and baked goods on November 10th by between $0.10 and $0.30, jacking up the average customer’s bill by about 0.5%.\nThe company last raised prices in July , increasing the cost of select sizes of brewed coffee by $0.10 to $0.20, and the price of espresso and tea latte drinks by between $0.10 and $0.30.\nToasty on the inside, toasty on the outside. #ChestnutPralineLatte \nA photo posted by Starbucks Coffee ☕ (@starbucks) on Nov 3, 2016 at 9:23am PDT \nThis is the fourth time in three years that Starbucks has raised its prices, likely because of lower-than-expected sales growth . A rep for Starbucks explained the rationale for raising prices to Consumerist, saying, “We continually evaluate pricing on a product-by-product and market-by-market basis in our stores in order to balance our business needs while continuing to provide value to our loyal customers and to attract new customers.”\nCelebrating #EarlyThanksgiving with a #TurkeyStuffingPanini... and an ever-growing list of things to be thankful for. \nA photo posted by Starbucks Coffee ☕ (@starbucks) on Nov 21, 2016 at 10:22am PST \nWhile price hikes suck for consumers, the upside is that Starbucks employees recently got a raise of at least 5% nationwide; with more than 150,000 employees working in 7,670 stores, that raise will surely help a lot of individuals and families — especially during the holiday season.\nSo let’s try to look on that bright side, shall we?\nThe post Starbucks fans, you won’t be pleased about this devastating news appeared first on HelloGiggles .",

      "text": "Your Starbucks habit just got even more expensive. Consumerist reports that Starbucks has upped the price of some cold drinks and baked goods by anywhere from 10 to 30 cents. The price hike, which took effect on November 10, will cause a customer's total to go up by 0.5% on average. About 90% of items on the Starbucks menu will stay the same price.\nThe company didn't say why it was raising prices. According to The Street , sales growth has slowed for Starbucks in the United States, so raising prices could help the company's bottom line. Just this past July, Starbucks raised its prices on brewed coffee, espresso, and tea lattes by as much as 30 cents. That's unusual for Starbucks, which usually ups prices between 5 and 20 cents each year.\n \"We continually evaluate pricing on a product-by-product and market-by-market basis in our stores in order to balance our business needs while continuing to provide value to our loyal customers and to attract new customers,\" a representative for Starbucks told Consumerist.\nCustomers weren't too thrilled with the price hike, and posted their sticker shock on Twitter.\nFuck you Starbucks for raising the price of your cold drinks. I'm still going to buy them but fuck you\n— Leanna (@hankheel) November 22, 2016 #starbucks must you raise the price of cold drinks? I already feel I am getting less for my money getting cold given it's mostly water...\n— Lucy Sky (@PaperbackLucy) November 22, 2016 Just stop drinking @Starbucks so they'll lower the prices... You shouldn't be paying the price of a meal for a stupid latte. 👎\n— Lauren Mayhew (@LaurenMayhew_) November 22, 2016 @Starbucks did a price hike back in July and now they're doing another price hike? #greedy\n— jazuela (@jazuela34) November 21, 2016 @Starbucks as much as I love my daily grande iced coffee, yet another price increase this year means a decrease in my visits. Too damn high!\n— Layla S. (@TVTweets101) November 21, 2016\nFrom: Delish\n ",

      "text": "This Pumpkin Spice Latte Comes With a Miniature Pumpkin Pie on Top Your move, Starbucks share The pumpkin spice latte market is getting crowded, forcing would-be PSL purveyors to innovate in order to stand out from the crowd. Since the beverage’s flavor profile is inspired by pumpkin pie, and not actual pumpkin, one Los Angeles coffeeshop has come up with the perfect garnish. Behold: The miniature pumpkin pie-topped PSL at Go Get Em Tiger . A photo posted by Go Get Em Tiger (@ggetla) on Nov 23, 2016 at 8:15am PST The beverage, available this Thursday from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m., has become a Thanksgiving tradition for the shop in recent years. Break the pie into the beverage, consume, and let the autumn-inspired basicness wash over you. The next-level PSL isn’t the only eye-popping Turkey Day special from Go Get Em Tiger. Eater LA has a look at the full menu , which includes a gingerbread latte (actually a milkshake garnished with a gingerbread cookie), peppermint mocha (peppermint ganache mixed with espresso, topped with mint-infused whipped cream and a candied mint leaf, served in an edible chocolate cup), and toffee nut latte (an homage to Cup O’ Noodles: a cup of toffee, instant coffee, steamed almond macadamia milk). Starbucks might have a PSL mascot with its own Twitter account , but Go Get Em Tiger is bringing the heat. It might be time for the Seattle-based behemoth to step up its game.",

      "text": "Image courtesy of Louis Abate \nNovember 22, 2016 12:40 pm EST By Ashlee Kieler @akieler here we go again starbucks coffee cool coffee at a price Price Increase expensive drinks baked goods \nFour months after Starbucks surprised customers by accidentally pushing out its annual price increase two weeks early , the company had another shocker for guests: a second price increase for some drinks and food items. \nStarbucks increased the price for certain cold drinks and bakery items by $0.10 to $0.30 earlier this month, the company confirmed to Consumerist. \nA rep for the coffee giant says the increases don’t affect about 90% of the company’s beverages, such as hot tea, brewed coffee, espresso and prepared items. Still, the company expects affected customers’ tabs to increase by 0.5% on average. \n“We continually evaluate pricing on a product-by-product and market-by-market basis in our stores in order to balance our business needs while continuing to provide value to our loyal customers and to attract new customers,” the rep said. \nWhile the second price increase only affects cold beverages, which might not have that much appeal during these chilly months, some Starbucks customers expressed their displeasure on Twitter at paying more at the counter. So apperntly in the past 2 months I've been away at college, the price of frappuccinos at @Starbucks went up by 30¢! ",

      "text": "  \n(REUTERS/Ilya Naymushin) Pokemon Go Hub has created a user-friendly chance calculator to help players save limited resources when capturing a Pokemon \nThere's exactly no way to determine whether it's really a clever publicity stunt done by Niantic, Inc. or an honest mistake, but people may now already have a clear idea on when the purported version 2 of the hit augmented reality mobile game, \"Pokemon Go\" will come out. \nRumors have been plaguing the fandom that the developers are looking to add a hundred more Pokemon into the game. As early as October, it's been heard that this new slate of Pokemon will come from Generation 2 which avid followers of the franchise may consider the most popular among the \"Pokemon\" generations. \nIn a report , it says that there's already been some mention of that particular generation in \"Pokemon Go's\" code, but it was only now that the a specific date has been mentioned. \nIn what way was the public able to get hold of the information? Advertisement \nAccording to iDigital Times , a Redditor who claims to be working for Starbucks did what is considered as a breach of confidentiality by sharing what looks like an internal memo with the details pertaining to a certain \"Version 2\" update of \"Pokemon Go.\" There's also the talk of Groupon promotions, Facebook, and Verizon promotions but the highlight pertains to that of the hit mobile game. \nAs indicated in the image of the memo shared over the publication, it says that the update will be rolled out this Dec. 7 which the coffee chain store will \"take a great part\" of. \"Lures will be dropped...\" the memo added. \nThe person in question did clarify in his post that he really can't be sure if the memorandum really refers to the \"Pokemon\" Generation 2 and or Starbucks and Niantic are collaborating on this particular event. However, the \"Pokemon Frapuccino\" is quite indicative of the case. \nWatch out for more updates.  ",
