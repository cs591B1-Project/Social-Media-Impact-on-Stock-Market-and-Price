      "text": "Trump On Twitter: Ford Won’t Move Lincoln Assembly To Mexico   07:05 AM) \nPresident-elect Donald Trump took to Twitter Thursday night to announce that Ford Motor Co. won’t be moving Lincoln production from Kentucky to Mexico. \nBill Ford, the company’s executive chairman, telephoned him with the news that a Lincoln plant would stay in Louisville, Trump said in the tweet claiming credit for the decision. \nFord doesn’t have a plant that exclusively builds Lincolns, but it had planned to move production of the Lincoln MKC small SUV out of the Louisville Assembly Plant so it could make more Ford Escapes there. A company spokeswoman confirmed Thursday that Ford was considering MKC production at a factory in Cuautitlan, Mexico. The move was negotiated with the United Auto Workers union in 2015. Ads By Artscroll: \nCompany spokeswoman Christin Baker said she didn’t know when the decision was made to keep the MKC in Louisville or if Trump had any impact on it. It’s possible the decision was made before the election, because Escape sales have been falling since July, so additional production capacity in Louisville may not be needed. \n“We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States,” Baker said in an e-mail. \nThe development is the latest in a yearlong feud between Trump and Ford over plans to move production south of the border. The company plans to shift small-car production from suburban Detroit to Mexico to improve profitability of the lower-priced cars. CEO Mark Fields said Tuesday that the presidential election didn’t change the company’s plan. \nTrump wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and has called for a 35 percent tariff on goods shipped from Mexico in an effort to preserve U.S. manufacturing jobs. \nFord plans to move production of the Focus and C-Max small cars to Mexico from a plant in Wayne, Michigan. But jobs at the Wayne plant would be preserved because it’s getting a new SUV and small pickup truck. \n“I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!,” Trump said in a tweet. \nBill Ford met with Trump during the summer and spoke with him on Thursday, Baker said. \n(AP)",

      "text": "News Trump on Twitter: Ford won’t move Lincoln assembly to Mexico A police officer locks the gate to the parking garage at President-elect Donald Trump’s transition office in Washington, Thursday. Molly Riley — The Associated Press By Tom Krisher, The Associated Press Posted: # Comments Retired Lt. Gen Michael Flynn gives the thumbs-up as he arrives at Trump Tower, Thursday in New York. Carolyn Kaster — The Associated Press \nDETROIT >> President-elect Donald Trump took to Twitter Thursday night to announce that Ford Motor Co. won’t be moving Lincoln production from Kentucky to Mexico. \nBill Ford, the company’s executive chairman, telephoned him with the news that a Lincoln plant would stay in Louisville, Trump said in the tweet claiming credit for the decision. \nFord doesn’t have a plant that exclusively builds Lincolns, but it had planned to move production of the Lincoln MKC small SUV out of the Louisville Assembly Plant so it could make more Ford Escapes there. A company spokeswoman confirmed Thursday that Ford was considering MKC production at a factory in Cuautitlan, Mexico. The move was negotiated with the United Auto Workers union in 2015. \nCompany spokeswoman Christin Baker said she didn’t know when the decision was made to keep the MKC in Louisville or if Trump had any impact on it. It’s possible the decision was made before the election, because Escape sales have been falling since July, so additional production capacity in Louisville may not be needed. Advertisement \n“We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States,” Baker said in an e-mail. \nThe development is the latest in a yearlong feud between Trump and Ford over plans to move production south of the border. The company plans to shift small-car production from suburban Detroit to Mexico to improve profitability of the lower-priced cars. CEO Mark Fields said Tuesday that the presidential election didn’t change the company’s plan. \nTrump wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and has called for a 35 percent tariff on goods shipped from Mexico in an effort to preserve U.S. manufacturing jobs. \nFord plans to move production of the Focus and C-Max small cars to Mexico from a plant in Wayne, Michigan. But jobs at the Wayne plant would be preserved because it’s getting a new SUV and small pickup truck. \n“I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!,” Trump said in a tweet. \nBill Ford met with Trump during the summer and spoke with him on Thursday, Baker said.",

But company spokeswoman Christin Baker says she doesn’t know when the decision was made to keep the MKC in Louisville or if Trump had any impact on it.\nTrump has been feuding with Ford over plans to move small-car production from suburban Detroit to Mexico.

      "text": "comments \nDETROIT -- The expansion of Detroit's Motown Museum is getting a $6 million boost from Ford Motor Co. and Ford-UAW. And, in turn, the automaker's Blue Oval will have a prominent presence in the new space. \nThe automaker and the union announced Friday they're investing the money as lead donor of the $50 million project, which calls for 50,000-square-feet of new space, including more interactive exhibits, a \"state-of-the-art\" theater, recording studios and expanded retail. \nThe expansion will be built around the 10,000 square feet of existing space at two homes on West Grand Boulevard, where Berry Gordy, Jr. founded the legendary Motown Records label and gave rise to the likes of Marvin Gaye, the Jackson Five, the Four Tops, the Supremes and Stevie Wonder. \nFord and Ford-UAW said the $6 million investment will go toward creating: Ford Motor Company Theater, a state-of-the-art performance venue Educational, music and other programming tied to Ford's ongoing student and community outreach initiatives CARaoke Experience, in which visitors take part in an interactive Ford-branded activity that incorporates music with Ford vehicles \nAnd Ford will be the official vehicle of Motown Museum, the automaker said. \nGordy first called the label Tamla Records, then changed the name to Motown, with its name and business model rumored to have been inspired by Ford's assembly line. \n\"Motown and Ford Motor Company have wide and deeply connected roots,\" Robin R. Terry, chairwoman and CEO of Motown Museum, said in a release. \"As two Detroit born brands, they have had -- and continue to have today -- a transformative and profound impact on creativity and innovation around the world. \nThe $6 million investment is part of $10 million the Ford Fund, the Dearborn automaker's philanthropic arm, is contributing to Detroit over the next five years in a variety of initiatives. \nJimmy Settles, Ford-UAW vice president, grew up near the museum, which includes the iconic Hitsville U.S.A. house. \n\"It is very gratifying to support the expansion of the Motown Museum, and in doing so, we strengthen an institution that has great historical and cultural significance to our region and the world,\" Settles said in a statement. \"This partnership also allows us to continue our commitment to the Motown Museum's surrounding community, which is a community that many Detroit natives treasure.\" \nThe non-profit Motown Museum has also launched a donor-led fundraising campaign to raise other money needed, and the project's schedule depends on funding, Crain's Detroit Business reported last month.

      "text": "Friday, Nov 18, 2016 1:02 PM UTC Donald Trump pats self on back for saving Ford plant that wasn’t going to close The President-elect tweeted he \"worked hard\" to save a Louisville plant that wasn't ever planning to shutter Topics: Donald Trump , ford , Kentucky , Louisville , Manufacturing , Mexico , Trade , Business News , Politics News (Credit: Reuters/Gary Cameron) \nIf Donald Trump’s pair of tweets from shortly after 9 PM on Thursday night are to be believed, he did a major solid for the automotive workers in Louisville, Kentucky. \nThe problem, unfortunately, is that the tweets aren’t truthful. Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky – no Mexico \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 18, 2016 I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 18, 2016 As The New York Times explained on Friday morning, Ford was never actually planning on closing its Louisville plant, which manufactures the Lincoln MKC sport utility vehicle. Their plan had been to expand production of the Ford Escape, which is also made in Louisville, and move production of the Lincoln MKC to Mexico. No jobs were in danger of being lost at the Louisville plant. \nPerhaps out of deference to the president-elect, Ford announced shortly after Trump’s tweets that it would keep MKC production in Louisville. \n“Our small Lincoln utility vehicle made at the Louisville Assembly plant will stay in Kentucky,” Ford spokeswoman Christin Baker said in a statement. “We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States.” \nOne of the defining issues of Trump’s presidential campaign was his denunciation of American trade policies, which he claimed among other things allowed companies to move American jobs overseas. If elected, Trump vowed to flex his executive muscle to compel businesses to keep jobs in this country, frequently singling out Ford’s exportation of jobs to Mexico as a prime example. He has even threatened to impose a 35 percent tariff on vehicles manufactured in that country. Matthew Rozsa is a Ph.D. student in history at Lehigh University and a political columnist.

      "title": "Volkswagen to shed 30,000 jobs, cutting costs after scandal",
      "text": "Ford headquarters outside Detroit evacuated after fire FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Volkswagen announced plans Friday to cut 30,000 jobs in a wide-ranging restructuring of its namesake brand as it tries to recover from a scandal over cars rigged to cheat on diesel emissions tests. The German company said the job cuts are part of a long-term plan to improve profitability and shift resources and investment to electric-powered vehicles and digital services. Company officials at a news conference at its headquarters in Wolfsburg said 23,000 of the job cuts will come in Germany and that the measures will save some 3.7 billion euros ($4 billion) a year from 2020. CEO Matthias Mueller said it was \"the biggest reform package in the history of our core brand.\" In addition to Volkswagen, the company also makes cars under other brands including Porsche, Audi, SEAT, Skoda and Lamborghini. The layoffs cap a difficult year for Volkswagen, which has been embroiled in an emissions-rigging scandal that damaged the company's reputation and cost it billions. In response, Volkswagen has agreed to pay $15 billion to U.S. authorities and owners of some 500,000 vehicles with software that turned off emissions controls. Around 11 million cars worldwide have the deceptive software. The scandal has been a spur for the company to address longstanding problems such as high fixed costs at its manufacturing locations in Germany and excessively top-down management that many say created an environment that enabled the cheating. Herbert Diess, head of the core Volkswagen brand, conceded that Volkswagen had let its costs rise and \"lost ground in terms of productivity.\" The changes, he said, would make the company \"leaner and more efficient.\" The cuts are aimed at addressing Volkswagen's longstanding cost issue. Volkswagen, with 624,000 employees, sells roughly the same number of cars as Toyota and General Motors, around 10 million a year. But Toyota does it with 349,000 workers and GM with 202,000. One reason for VW's higher cost-base and headcount is the role that employee representatives play at the company. As at other large German companies, employees have half the seats on the board, a power they can use to resist moving production outside Germany or to suppliers. In addition, the state of Lower Saxony, where the headquarters is located, owns a stake in the company and tends to support employee interests as well. The cuts will mainly fall on its 120,000-strong German workforce. However, job cuts are also foreseen in Brazil and Argentina. The company has said it aims to cut nonessential costs and investments and shift resources toward battery-powered cars and internet-based services such as car-sharing and ride-sharing. The company had been slower than some competitors to move toward electric cars but has shifted its view after the scandal underlined diesel's limitations. Volkswagen now says it plans to introduce more than 30 electric-powered vehicles by 2025, and to sell 2 to 3 million of them a year. To make the job cuts, the company has cut a deal with its powerful worker representatives. Under the terms of the deal, Volkswagen has agreed to keep much of the future investment in new technology in Germany and to rely on voluntary departures such as early retirement, with no firings. Top employee representative Bernd Osterloh said \"the next generation of electric vehicles will be made here in Germany, not abroad.\" Volkswagen's package of measures received a lukewarm welcome in markets. The company's share price was down 0.3 percent at 128.75 euros, in line with the broader decline in Germany's benchmark DAX stock index.",

      "text": "| License Photo LOUISVILLE, Ky., Nov. 18 (UPI) -- President-elect Donald Trump credited himself with keeping a Ford Motor Company plant in Kentucky open, a facility Ford said it did not intend to close or move to Mexico.\nIn a Twitter message Thursday, Trump said Ford chairman William Clay Ford Jr. told him the Louisville plant was not closing, and production of the Lincoln MKC models manufactured there would not move to Mexico.\nJust got a call from my friend Bill Ford , Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky - no Mexico\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 18, 2016 Another message from Trump, minutes later, said he \"worked hard\" to keep the plant open in a state in which he received 62.5 percent of the popular vote in last week's presidential election.\nI worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 18, 2016 The company previously said it might move production of the vehicle from the Louisville plant, with Mexico the likely destination, but Thursday announced the sport utility vehicle would continue to be made in Kentucky.\nFord never intended to close the Louisville plant, instead planned to increase production of its popular Ford Escape, another vehicle made at the plant, after potentially moving the production of the MKC to Mexico. The manufacturing change was not expected to result in job losses in Louisville, let alone a plant closure, but current plans call for Lincoln MKCs and Ford Escapes to continue being built in Louisville.\nIn 2015, United Auto Workers union official Jimmy Settles told the Detroit Free Press , \"Whatever happens in Louisville it will not lose employment. They cannot make enough Escapes.\"\nFord had previously said it had no plans to close any of its U.S. plants.\nIn a statement, Ford did not mention Trump's alleged contribution to the production decision, but said \"We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States.\"\n Donald Trump will save us, Colorado oil and gas advocates say Hillary Clinton surpasses 1M popular vote lead over Donald Trump Poll: Most Americans say Donald Trump doesn't have a mandate to complete his agenda",

      "text": "Donald Trump tweets that Ford won't move 'Lincoln plant' to Mexico Tom Krisher, AP Auto Writer Business | Friday, November 18, 2016 at 9:13 am \nDETROIT — President-elect Donald Trump took to Twitter Thursday night to announce that Ford Motor Co. won't be moving Lincoln production from Kentucky to Mexico. Share E-mail this story Print this story Save this story Sponsor \nBill Ford, the company's executive chairman, telephoned him with the news that a Lincoln plant would stay in Louisville, Trump said in the tweet claiming credit for the decision. Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky - no Mexico \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 18, 2016 \nFord doesn't have a plant that exclusively builds Lincolns, but it had planned to move production of the Lincoln MKC small SUV out of the Louisville Assembly Plant so it could make more Ford Escapes there. A company spokeswoman confirmed Thursday that Ford was considering MKC production at a factory in Cuautitlan, Mexico. The move was negotiated with the United Auto Workers union in 2015. \nCompany spokeswoman Christin Baker said she didn't know when the decision was made to keep the MKC in Louisville or if Trump had any impact on it. It's possible the decision was made before the election, because Escape sales have been falling since July, so additional production capacity in Louisville may not be needed. \n\"We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States,\" Baker said in an e-mail. \nThe development is the latest in a yearlong feud between Trump and Ford over plans to move production south of the border. The company plans to shift small-car production from suburban Detroit to Mexico to improve profitability of the lower-priced cars. CEO Mark Fields said Tuesday that the presidential election didn't change the company's plan. \nTrump wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and has called for a 35 percent tariff on goods shipped from Mexico in an effort to preserve U.S. manufacturing jobs. \nFord plans to move production of the Focus and C-Max small cars to Mexico from a plant in Wayne, Michigan. But jobs at the Wayne plant would be preserved because it's getting a new SUV and small pickup truck. \n\"I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!,\" Trump said in a tweet. \nBill Ford met with Trump during the summer and spoke with him on Thursday, Baker said.",

USA TODAY NETWORK Trump has repeatedly criticized Ford over the past 18 months for its plans to move small car production to Mexico even though all other automakers are also expanding in Mexico Buy Photo Bill Ford, the Executive Chairman of Ford Motor Company, during a press conference at The Henry Ford Academy on Thursday, September 10, 2015, in Dearborn, MI. Ford Motor Company Fund and USC Shoah Foundation announced a partnership to expand the Witness multimedia program in the Detroit area. The program is an educational website providing access to life histories, testimonies of survivors and witnesses of genocides, from the Institute's Visual History Archive. (Photo: Salwan Georges ) Buy Photo \nFord Executive Chairman Bill Ford told president-elect Donald Trump on Thursday the automaker no longer plans to move production of its Lincoln MKC from Louisville to Mexico. \nFord currently makes both the Ford Escape compact SUV and the MKC in Louisville. Ford said last year it planned to move MKC production to another plant so it could increase production of the Escape. The automaker said at the time no jobs would be lost in Louisville because of plans to boost Escape production. \nThe Dearborn automaker also made a commitment in its 2015 contract with the UAW to invest $700 million in the Louisville plant over the next four years. \n► Related: Motown Museum expansion gets $6 million from Ford \nTrump took credit for causing Ford to change its plans in two tweets Thursday night.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 18, 2016 \nFord spokeswoman Christin Baker said Ford's plant in Cuautitlan, Mexico was the \"likely\" location for the MKC in 2019. \nBaker did not say why the automaker changed is plans for the Lincoln SUV. She did confirm that Bill Ford spoke with President-elect Trump yesterday. \n\"Bill shared Ford's continued commitment to invest in the U.S.,\" Ford said in a statement. \"We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States.\" \nFord employs about 4,700 people at its plant in Louisville. The vast majority of the vehicles built at the plant are Escape SUVs. It also has a separate truck plant in Louisville, where it builds pickups and larger SUVs. \nRepublican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks during a press conference March 8 at the Trump National Golf Club Jupiter in Jupiter, Fla. (Photo: Joe Raedle, Getty Images) \nTrump has repeatedly criticized Ford over the past 18 months for its plans to move the production of its Ford Focus and Ford C-Max hybrids to Mexico even though nearly all other automakers also have built new plants in recent years or are expanding their presence. \nTrump also has promised to bring manufacturing jobs back to the U.S., has said he wants the U.S. to withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement and has talked about imposing a 35% tariff on cars made in Mexico as well as other products. \n► Related: Ford is moving fast to create mobility partnerships \nFields also said the automaker sent Trump a congratulatory letter after he won the Nov. 8 election. \nSeveral other top-ranking executives at the Los Angeles Auto Show declined to comment directly on Trump's comments about NAFTA or the tariff. Instead, most automotive executives say it's too early to comment on Trump's comments on the campaign trail because he hasn't formally proposed anything yet. \n\"Well obviously, we are in a transition at the moment. I think it’s important with all of the speculation that’s out there just to see once the transition is finished, what the environment looks like,\" Mike Manley, head the Ram and Jeep brands for Fiat Chrysler Automobiles said Wednesday. \"Like every other automaker we are in contact with the administration, we welcome that contact, we are looking forward to that continuing and will see what happens.\" \n► Related: Ford CEO Fields: 35% tariff would hurt U.S. economy \nFord, on Friday, emphasized that it has created 28,000 new jobs and has invested $12 billion in the U.S. over the past five years. \n\"We continue to engage with President-elect Trump's team - and the new Congress - as they shape the policy agenda for 2017. We have shared our commitment to continue investing in the U.S. and creating American jobs,\" Ford said in a statement. \nContact Brent Snavely: 313-222-6512 or bsnavely@freepress.com.

      "title": "Donald Trump and Ford: Trump's claim he kept the auto manufacturer in Kentucky is false",
      "text": "Donald Trump repeatedly told his supporters on the campaign trail that if elected, he would strong-arm American companies to keep production and manufacturing jobs in the United States. \"We can stop them from leaving. We have to stop them from leaving,\" Trump said in the first presidential debate, saying he would slap an import tax on products manufactured by American companies that moved production overseas.\nOn Thursday night, the president-elect implied via Twitter that he'd had his first victory in the war to keep jobs in America: Ford Motor Company would continue manufacturing cars in Kentucky instead of Mexico.\nJust got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky - no Mexico\nI worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!\nTrump's tweet suggested that through hard work, he somehow convinced Ford to continue production of Lincoln cars in the U.S. But however Trump wants to spin this news, the reality is that Ford was never moving a \"plant in Kentucky\" to Mexico.\nDetails matter In a statement to the Washington Post , Ford said that it did plan to shift production of the Lincoln MKC — one model — from Louisville, Kentucky, to Mexico. But the company informed Trump production of the MKC would remain in Louisville.\nCNN reported that production of the MKC in Louisville was relatively small. Annually, Ford produces 20,000 Lincoln MKCs and 306,000 Ford Escapes at its Louisville plant. Last year , Ford announced it planned to move MKC production out of Louisville, but increased Escape production was planned to offset the loss of the MKC, meaning there would be no jobs cuts.\nDespite Trump victory lap, Ford says it wasn't planning to move its assembly plant to Mexico https://t.co/xR259mnfYE\nThe key word in this exchange: \"plant.\" Tweeting that Ford planned to keep relatively small production of one vehicle in Kentucky does not sound substantial. But saying Ford kept a plant in the U.S. suggests thousands of jobs were saved, and frames Trump as successful and honest to his campaign promises.\nHis supporters immediately spread the false news on Twitter.\nFord and now Apple. Businesses are already talking about coming home and Trump isn't even sworn in yet.\nThank you to President-Elect Trump for working with FORD to keep its plant in Kentucky. Not even President &amp; he's getting things done!\nAnd then, this As the car manufacturer announced earlier this year, Ford still plans to move a good portion of its production to Mexico. But the shift away from Detroit will be balanced by a commitment to invest $9 billion in its American plants, Ford's CEO said , adding that \"zero\" jobs will be lost in the U.S.\nThe statement was prompted by Trump's assertion in the first presidential debate that \"Ford is leaving; their small car division leaving. Thousands of jobs leaving Michigan, leaving Ohio.\"\nAs New York magazine's Jesse Singal pointed out, Trump's statement contributes to a proliferation of fake news, especially when he is the one generating it.\n4/ Have simply made up that he saved a plant and American jobs. But he knows what he's doing -- there are now fake stories all over the\n5/place confirming that yes, the election of Trump saved a bunch of jobs. Kept American jobs American.

      "text": "November 18, 2016 1:17 AM Trump on Twitter: Ford won't move Lincoln assembly to Mexico By TOM KRISHER AP Auto Writer DETROIT \nPresident-elect Donald Trump took to Twitter Thursday night to announce that Ford Motor Co. won't be moving Lincoln production from Kentucky to Mexico. \nBill Ford, the company's executive chairman, telephoned him with the news that a Lincoln plant would stay in Louisville, Trump said in the tweet claiming credit for the decision. \nFord doesn't have a plant that exclusively builds Lincolns, but it had planned to move production of the Lincoln MKC small SUV out of the Louisville Assembly Plant so it could make more Ford Escapes there. A company spokeswoman confirmed Thursday that Ford was considering MKC production at a factory in Cuautitlan, Mexico. The move was negotiated with the United Auto Workers union in 2015. \nCompany spokeswoman Christin Baker said she didn't know when the decision was made to keep the MKC in Louisville or if Trump had any impact on it. It's possible the decision was made before the election, because Escape sales have been falling since July, so additional production capacity in Louisville may not be needed. \n\"We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States,\" Baker said in an e-mail. \nThe development is the latest in a yearlong feud between Trump and Ford over plans to move production south of the border. The company plans to shift small-car production from suburban Detroit to Mexico to improve profitability of the lower-priced cars. CEO Mark Fields said Tuesday that the presidential election didn't change the company's plan. \nTrump wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and has called for a 35 percent tariff on goods shipped from Mexico in an effort to preserve U.S. manufacturing jobs. \nFord plans to move production of the Focus and C-Max small cars to Mexico from a plant in Wayne, Michigan. But jobs at the Wayne plant would be preserved because it's getting a new SUV and small pickup truck. \n\"I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!,\" Trump said in a tweet. \nBill Ford met with Trump during the summer and spoke with him on Thursday, Baker said.

      "text": "Print Ford Motor Co. Chairman Bill Ford called Donald Trump to tell the president-elect the auto maker won't move production of Lincolns out of Kentucky, a sign the car company aims to work with a new administration on protecting American manufacturing workers. \nContinue Reading Below Mr. Trump, in a tweet posted to his Twitter account late Thursday, said he had \"just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky -- no Mexico.\" He then added in a second tweet \"I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky.\" The auto maker confirmed in a statement that production of the Lincoln MKC crossover will remain at its assembly plant in Louisville, Ky. Ford had initially planned to move output of the Lincoln model to another plant to boost production of the Escape, which is built at the same factory. The company didn't say where it had planned to move production of the Lincoln crossover. Ford communicated that plan to the United Auto Workers in 2015 as part of a broader contract negotiation. The Louisville plant, employing about 4,700 workers, wasn't in danger of closing. \"We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States,\" the company said. Mr. Trump campaigned on a pledge to bring U.S. manufacturing jobs back and took aim at Ford's separate plans to move small-car production from Michigan to a new $1.6 billion factory it is building in Mexico. That product, the Focus, is separate from the Lincoln Mr. Trump referred to, and Ford is still planning to move those small cars to Mexico, Chief Executive Mark Fields said earlier this week. \nContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT As the Republican candidate for president, Mr. Trump proposed a 35% tariff on vehicles or other products built abroad and imported by the U.S. by companies like Ford. Mr. Fields said a tariff would have negative consequences for the broader auto industry and the U.S. economy. A spokeswoman for Mr. Trump didn't immediately return a request for comment. Ford executives, including Mr. Ford, have repeatedly stressed the company's shift in factory output to Mexico won't cost any U.S. jobs and the Michigan factory losing small-car production will eventually get new models to keep the assembly lines running. Ford says it has invested $12 billion in its U.S. factories over the past five years creating 28,000 jobs. Mr. Fields told reporters Ford has talked to Mr. Trump's transition team and believes the company can work with the new administration. \"We all share the same objective,\" Mr. Fields said. Ford's Chief Financial Officer Bob Shanks was also encouraged by Mr. Trump's recent remarks, saying earlier Thursday he believes the president-elect is pursuing \"pro-growth\" policies, including on trade. Like many of its rivals, Ford is increasing production of more profitable trucks and sport-utility vehicles in the U.S. while investing to boost output in Mexico for lower-margin small cars. Mr. Trump has said he would begin renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement that covers Canada, the U.S. and Mexico. If Mexico doesn't agree to improve terms, the U.S. will leave the pact, Mr. Trump said. He blames unfair trade, in particular with Mexico and China, for the loss of millions of factory jobs�a message that resonated with voters in Michigan during the election. Mr. Trump won Michigan, the first Republican candidate to do that since 1988. Write to Christina Rogers at christina.rogers@wsj.com What do you think? ",

      "text": "Tweet \nFord’s Louisville, Kentucky assembly plant will continue to crank out Lincoln MKC crossovers, rather than head down south for a Mexican vacation. \nThe news, which Ford confirmed after an enthusiastic President-elect Donald Trump tweeted it, means the automaker will need to look elsewhere for more Escapes. It doesn’t, however, mean a factory closing was averted. \nLouisville Assembly currently builds the Ford Escape and Lincoln MKC, but production of the littlest Lincoln was scheduled to go elsewhere once the automaker’s UAW contract expires in 2019. According to Automotive News , Ford spokeswoman Christin Baker had previously said the likely destination was the Cuautitlán assembly plant in Mexico. \nNot anymore. In a tweet posted last night , Trump stated “Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky – no Mexico.” \nFord has confirmed that the MKC will remain in the Bluegrass State. \nCritics pounced on the president-elect’s word usage and declared the tweet misleading, as the Louisville plant — which employs about 4,700 workers — was in no danger of closing. Simply swap out the word “plant” for “assembly” in Trump’s tweet, and there’s no problem. Semantics aside, what does the change in heart mean for the Escape? \nThe planned MKC move was supposed to free up plant space to boost production of the popular compact crossover. If it wants more Escapes for the domestic market, Ford will need to find space elsewhere. However, it might not have to — at least for now. North American Escape sales reached a plateau in 2014, and despite the popularity of crossovers and SUVs, overall new vehicle sales in the U.S. are on the decline. MKC sales haven’t budged beyond the high-water mark set last year. \nOf course, the revamped production plans concern the next-generation Escape and MKC. The marketplace could change by then, and Ford could find itself with extra demand for updated models. Interestingly, a production forecast prepared last year by accounting firm UHY LLP shows Ford Escape assembly added to the Cuautitlán, Mexico plant, with production starting in December of 2018. \n[Image: Ford Motor Company]",

      "text": "By Christina Rogers\nFord Motor Co. Chairman Bill Ford called Donald Trump to tell the president-elect the auto maker won't move production of Lincolns out of Kentucky, a sign the car company aims to work with a new administration on protecting American manufacturing workers.\nMr. Trump, in a tweet posted to his Twitter account late Thursday, said he had \"just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky -- no Mexico.\" He then added in a second tweet \"I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky.\"\nThe auto maker confirmed in a statement that production of the Lincoln MKC crossover will remain at its assembly plant in Louisville, Ky. Ford had initially planned to move output of the Lincoln model to another plant to boost production of the Escape, which is built at the same factory. The company didn't say where it had planned to move production of the Lincoln crossover.\nFord communicated that plan to the United Auto Workers in 2015 as part of a broader contract negotiation. The Louisville plant, employing about 4,700 workers, wasn't in danger of closing.\n\"We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States,\" the company said.\nMr. Trump campaigned on a pledge to bring U.S. manufacturing jobs back and took aim at Ford's separate plans to move small-car production from Michigan to a new $1.6 billion factory it is building in Mexico. That product, the Focus, is separate from the Lincoln Mr. Trump referred to, and Ford is still planning to move those small cars to Mexico, Chief Executive Mark Fields said earlier this week.\nAs the Republican candidate for president, Mr. Trump proposed a 35% tariff on vehicles or other products built abroad and imported by the U.S. by companies like Ford. Mr. Fields said a tariff would have negative consequences for the broader auto industry and the U.S. economy.\nA spokeswoman for Mr. Trump didn't immediately return a request for comment.\nFord executives, including Mr. Ford, have repeatedly stressed the company's shift in factory output to Mexico won't cost any U.S. jobs and the Michigan factory losing small-car production will eventually get new models to keep the assembly lines running.\nFord says it has invested $12 billion in its U.S. factories over the past five years creating 28,000 jobs.\nMr. Fields told reporters Ford has talked to Mr. Trump's transition team and believes the company can work with the new administration. \"We all share the same objective,\" Mr. Fields said.\nFord's Chief Financial Officer Bob Shanks was also encouraged by Mr. Trump's recent remarks, saying earlier Thursday he believes the president-elect is pursuing \"pro-growth\" policies, including on trade.\nLike many of its rivals, Ford is increasing production of more profitable trucks and sport-utility vehicles in the U.S. while investing to boost output in Mexico for lower-margin small cars.\nMr. Trump has said he would begin renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement that covers Canada, the U.S. and Mexico.\nIf Mexico doesn't agree to improve terms, the U.S. will leave the pact, Mr. Trump said. He blames unfair trade, in particular with Mexico and China, for the loss of millions of factory jobs--a message that resonated with voters in Michigan during the election. Mr. Trump won Michigan, the first Republican candidate to do that since 1988.\nWrite to Christina Rogers at christina.rogers@wsj.com\n 18, 2016 00:43 ET (05:43 ",

      "text": "Trump: Ford plant to stay in Kentucky Danielle Lerner , @Danielle_Lerner 9:42 a.m. EST November 18, 2016 Ford Motor Co. (Photo: David Zalubowski) \nPresident-elect Donald Trump tweeted Thursday that a Kentucky Ford Motor Co. assembly plant would not be moving to Mexico, but the company released a statement clarifying that the messages were referencing the production of a specific vehicle. \nIn two tweets sent out around 9 p.m. Thursday night, Trump said that Ford Motor chairman Bill Ford had told him the company would not be moving one of its Kentucky plants to Mexico. \n\"Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky - no Mexico,\" the first tweet read. Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky - no Mexico — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 18, 2016 Ford has repeatedly denied that it was planning to close any U.S. plants that would result in workers losing their jobs. Since July 2015, the automotive maker has disputed Trump's comments about its investments. Trump doubled down on his claim in a second tweet 15 minutes later, writing, \"I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!\" I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 18, 2016 Ford sent out an official statement late Thursday night clarifying Trump's statement, saying that the tweets were in reference to continuing production of a specific Lincoln vehicle in Kentucky, not an entire assembly plant. \"We continue to engage with President-elect Trump’s team – and the new Congress – as they shape the policy agenda for 2017. We have shared our commitment to continue investing in the U.S. and creating American jobs – building on the $12 billion we have invested in our U.S. plants and the nearly 28,000 U.S. jobs Ford has created in the past five years. Ford continues to employ more American autoworkers and produce more American made vehicles than anyone. \nToday, we confirmed with the President-elect that our small Lincoln utility vehicle made at the Louisville Assembly Plant will stay in Kentucky. We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States. \nWe will have more details to share on our future plans at the appropriate time.\"​ On Friday, Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer's office bypassed questions about Trump taking credit for the Lincoln production line staying in the city. But Fischer \"is glad to see Ford continuing its commitment to Louisville,\" spokesman Chris Poynter said. ► ON THE GO? Download the CJ app for iPhone, Android and iPad Ford operates two plants in Kentucky, both located in Louisville — the Kentucky Truck Plant and the Louisville Assembly Plant. It is unclear which plant Trump was referring to in his tweets, since both locations manufacture Lincoln automobile parts. The Courier-Journal previously reported that the Louisville Assembly Plant would be temporarily shut down for two weeks in October to keep production levels in line with demand. At 10 p.m. Thursday, Kentucky governor Matt Bevin tweeted, \"2 days ago, @RealDonaldTrump told me he was working w/ @Ford to keep smaller vehicle production in KY & USA. Tonight they delivered... TY!\"",

      "text": "Ford Motor ( F ), cutting its 2017 profit forecast for the second time in three months, said it sees a bumpier future as President-elect Donald J. Trump translates his campaign promises into new policies on trade, tariffs and regulation.\n\"It feels like a world that's even more volatile,\" Bob Shanks, Ford's chief financial officer, said in a presentation to analysts today. The Trump administration \"is going to be an opportunity for substantial change.\"\nComplicating matters, those changes are coming just as U.S. auto sales are slowing after a record six straight years of growth — meaning there's now a glut of used cars that is hurting profit at its Ford Credit unit. On an optimistic note, Shanks said the automaker does expect Trump to have a \"pro-growth\" strategy for the economy. That might include easing tough fuel-economy regulations to reflect consumers' preference for trucks and sport utility vehicles — instead of electric cars — in an era of cheap gasoline.\n\"If the new government is serious about accelerating and growing in a very healthy way the U.S. economy — and I believe it is — I think it will take measures that will enable that,\" Shanks said. Hitting Ford with a 35 percent duty on cars it makes in Mexico and brings back to the U.S., as Trump threatened during the campaign, \"would be contrary to that.\"\nIBD'S TAKE: Automakers were looking to the future this week. Check out IBD's coverage of the L.A. Auto Show . \nShanks said he noticed a \"change in tone post-election\" from Trump that \"is very encouraging.\"\n\"When Mr. Trump met President Obama, the tone, the dialogue, the mutual respect, the desire to work together, I thought was very, very positive,\" Shanks said.\nFord is talking to Trump's transition team, while also speaking with federal regulators about how low gas prices are undermining efforts to get Americans to buy electric cars and hybrids so that automakers can achieve a goal to average more than 50 miles per gallon by 2025.\nEV Demand Lags \"There's been no movement whatsoever for electrified products, which is probably driven by the fact that gas prices are so low,\" Shanks said. \"It's just not what any of us had expected, including the government. And it's going to be very difficult, therefore, to get there without pushing on the customers things they just don't want.\"\nMore immediately, Ford is still adjusting to a slowing auto market — cutting its forecast for 2017 pretax profits because of declining auction values for used cars. Ford shares fell 1.1 percent to 11.87 on the stock market today . The stock had declined 15 percent this year through Wednesday.\nPretax earnings for the automaker's credit unit next year will be about $1.5 billion, $300 million lower than its previous estimate, the company said Thursday in a regulatory filing. In September, Ford reduced its 2017 profit prediction by $600 million due to rising recall costs. The second-largest U.S. automaker reiterated that it expects total company adjusted pretax profit to drop in 2017 as it invests in \"emerging opportunities,\" and forecast improvement in 2018.\nHertz Global Holdings ( HTZ ) last week cut its annual earnings forecast, citing a drop in used-car values, especially for compact and mid-sized cars, which have come under pressure as American buyers shift to pickups and sport utility vehicles.\nFord has undertaken an extensive, expensive effort to transform itself to take on interlopers including Uber Technologies and Alphabet ( GOOGL ) unit Google. The carmaker has said it will be selling 100,000 robot taxis — without a steering wheel, gas or brake pedals — annually by 2021. It's also investing $4.5 billion to convert 40 percent of its product lineup to electrified vehicles by 2020 and has begun offering bike sharing and a commuter van service in San Francisco.\n\"Clearly the investments we're making in emerging opportunities, whether it's electrification or autonomy or mobility, will impact our earnings,\" Chief Executive Officer Mark Fields said on Bloomberg TV last month. \"Further out, those businesses will start to contribute to the company's bottom line.\"",

      "text": "Trump did not stop Ford from moving a plant to Mexico, but the media is letting him say he did anyway Posted By Lee DeVito   10:04 AM Photo via Shutterstock On Thursday night, President-elect Donald Trump tweeted that he saved a Ford plant from moving to Mexico — apparently fulfilling one of his many campaign promises before even taking office. \"Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky - no Mexico,\" he wrote. But as outlets like The Washington Post and The New York Times quickly pointed out, there were never any plans for Ford to move the entire plant to Mexico. A statement issued by the company after Trump's tweet clarified that Ford told Trump the company cancelled plans to move production of its low-selling Lincoln MKC from Louisville to Mexico. But since the same plant also manufactures the popular Ford Escape, the company wasn't planning on closing the plant — or even losing any jobs. Nevertheless, the media glibly parroted Trump's agitprop. Reuters published a brief article that simply quoted Trump's tweet, with no other analysis. (It has since been updated .) Even the Detroit Free Press took the bait, publishing both Trump's tweets and the actual statement from Ford — but without calling out the obvious dissonance between the two. It's not the first time Trump has erroneously tweeted about Ford. Last year, he claimed he influenced Ford from moving production to Ohio and not Mexico — apparently referencing a fake news article from a website that prints political campaign materials. So what's going on here? It seems like either A) Trump is so stupid that he really can't follow the nuance here or B) he knows most of his supporters are. Either case spells for an Orwellian nightmare. If this is a taste of what the next four years are like (please, America, no more than four), buckle up. It's going to be a rough ride.",

      "text": "Home | International Business | Trump On Twitter: Ford Won't Move Lincoln Assembly To Mexico President-elect Donald Trump took to Twitter Thursday night to announce that Ford Motor Co. won't be moving Lincoln production from Kentucky to Mexico. Associated Press | Last  43 (IST) Associated Press EMAIL COMMENTS Detroit: President-elect Donald Trump took to Twitter Thursday night to announce that Ford Motor Co. won't be moving Lincoln production from Kentucky to Mexico.Bill Ford, the company's executive chairman, telephoned him with the news that a Lincoln plant would stay in Louisville, Trump said in the tweet claiming credit for the decision.Ford doesn't have a plant that exclusively builds Lincolns, but it had planned to move production of the Lincoln MKC small SUV out of the Louisville Assembly Plant so it could make more Ford Escapes there. A company spokeswoman confirmed Thursday that Ford was considering MKC production at a factory in Cuautitlan, Mexico. The move was negotiated with the United Auto Workers union in 2015. Company spokeswoman Christin Baker said she didn't know when the decision was made to keep the MKC in Louisville or if Trump had any impact on it. It's possible the decision was made before the election, because Escape sales have been falling since July, so additional production capacity in Louisville may not be needed.\"We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States,\" Baker said in an e-mail.The development is the latest in a yearlong feud between Trump and Ford over plans to move production south of the border. The company plans to shift small-car production from suburban Detroit to Mexico to improve profitability of the lower-priced cars. CEO Mark Fields said Tuesday that the presidential election didn't change the company's plan.Trump wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and has called for a 35 percent tariff on goods shipped from Mexico in an effort to preserve U.S. manufacturing jobs.Ford plans to move production of the Focus and C-Max small cars to Mexico from a plant in Wayne, Michigan. But jobs at the Wayne plant would be preserved because it's getting a new SUV and small pickup truck.\"I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!,\" Trump said in a tweet.Bill Ford met with Trump during the summer and spoke with him on Thursday, Baker said.

      "text": "Washinton DC , Washington, D.C. Monday, November 14, 2016 During the Civil War, the nation's capital, Washington DC, was an important military headquarters. A priority during the war was to protect the capital. In some ways, the Civil War transitioned Washington DC from a rural town to an urban city; also becoming an important area for national government. This set the course for most of Washington DC's expansion in the 1800s. Located in Washington DC, is Ford's Theatre. On April 14th, 1865, 16th President Abraham Lincoln was shot in Ford's Theatre by a man by the name of John Wilkes Booth. He later died in http://military.wikia.com/wiki/Washington,_D.C.,_in_the_American_Civil_War",

      "text": "Thomson Reuters \nLate Thursday night, president-elect Donald Trump tweeted that he \"got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky — no Mexico.\"\nAs Business Insider's Chris Sanchez reported Thursday night , Trump followed that tweet with this one:  \"I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!\" \nApart from Trump potentially making trouble for Ford's executive team by revealing details of conversations he had with Bill Ford — who has far as I know has never publicly commented on anything related to the automaker's production since stepping down as CEO in 2006 — the core issue here is that Ford wasn't contemplating any job cuts at the Louisville Assembly Plant, but wanted to replace production of a Lincoln vehicle, the MKC luxury crossover, with a mass-market SUV, the Ford Escape. \nThe vehicles share a manufacturing platform, which was developed in Europe as a vehicle called the Kuga. \nFord confirmed that it had considered moving MKC production to Mexico, but had jettisoned that idea . \nMKC production in at Louisville is dwarfed by Escape production — the former has sold around 20,000 units year-to-date, while the latter has sold more than 258,000, amid a boom in smaller crossovers and record sales levels in the US. The Lincoln sales are respectable, but the Escape sales are evidence of strong demand that Ford wants to meet.  \nCommitment to the Kentucky plant In fact, back in 2010, the carmaker invested $600 million in the Louisville plant, with financial support from the state of Kentucky, to be able to more effectively shift production from vehicle to vehicle, depending on consumer demand. The plant has been in operation since 1955. \nWhat's ultimately going on here is that Ford wants to adjust its product mix in the US, building fewer slow-selling small cars in the US and introducing new pickups and SUVs, vehicles that the market is hungry for right now and that can bring in higher profits.  \nThomson Reuters \nThe game plan is to shift small-passenger-car production to Mexico, to a new plant. It's worth noting that Ford isn't breaking new ground south of the border; the automaker opened its first Mexican plant in the mid-1960s and established a second during the Reagan administration. \nThe current US workforce will be reoriented to build more trucks and SUVs. If punitive tariffs were enacted, as Trump has proposed, on vehicles entering the US from Ford's Mexican plants, then Ford would have to consider  discontinuing small-car production amid current market conditions.  \nThis would be bad, as Ford needs the small vehicles in its lineup both to meet federal fuel-economy regulations and to hedge against future increases in gas prices and changing market conditions. \nFactories everywhere Now, you could ask why Ford doesn't just keep all vehicle production in the US (as if it ever has — Ford operates factories all over the world and has for decades). The problem is that it can't make enough money on smaller vehicles to justify devoting manufacturing capacity to them at the moment, or adding new capacity — but it can repurpose that capacity to build the more profitable vehicles that consumers want. \nFord — and for that matter the rest of the industry — doesn't want to add new capacity because the US market is at a sales peak. Building new factories now would mean idled factories later, when the market inevitably declines.  \nAll of this enables Ford to do a better job of taking care of its existing and retired workforce. As the company continues to post good financial results quarter after quarter, it can share the wealth: earlier this year, the automaker and United Auto Workers announced that workers would get $9,300 apiece in profit-sharing payouts.  \nProfits also enable Ford to keep its pension plans nearly fully funded, making for a better overall balance sheet. \nThomson Reuters \nFord and the political football The bottom line here is that Ford has ended up on the short end of a debate about jobs, at a time when the last thing the automaker is contemplating is long-term layoffs or plant closures. If Ford were planning to move significant truck production to Mexico, then there might be something going on with the carmaker using NAFTA to lower its labor costs — a move that would rile up the UAW in a major way. \nThat hasn't happened, so what Trump is suggesting here — in as much as 120 characters can suggest something meaningful — is that his cordial businessman's relationship with Bill Ford has convinced Ford to \"keep\" jobs in the US that it didn't intend to get rid of. \nInstead, Ford looks set to keep  production in the US that it was considering shifting to Mexico. \nWeirdly, that's a sort of win-win and could signal the end of a war of words between Trump and Ford that escalated during the campaign. (For what it's worth, Trump and Bill Ford has reportedly been discussing these issues since before the election.) \nUnfortunately, the dustup also shows that the president-elect doesn't yet have a very strong understanding of an industry that's one of the most important drivers of the entire US economy. \nNOW WATCH: Ford CEO responds to Trump’s criticism of the company \n",

      "text": "Trump took credit for saving a Ford plant that was never in any danger in the first place. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump addresses the Faith and Freedom Coalition’s Road to Majority Conference in Washington, Friday, June 10, 2016 CREDIT: AP Photo/Cliff Owen President-elect Donald Trump fired off two tweets on Thursday bragging about having saved American jobs. A Ford plant in Kentucky that was planning to move to Mexico, he alleged, was now going to stay in Kentucky because of his election.\nThe problem? There was never a Ford plant in Kentucky that was going to be moved to Mexico. Trump manufactured a crisis, and then took credit for solving it — and without pausing to verify the story, the media spread Trump’s version of reality far and wide.\nJust got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky - no Mexico\n —  @realDonaldTrump \nI worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!\n —  @realDonaldTrump \nOver the course of his campaign, Trump repeatedly swung at Ford for “leaving” the U.S. and taking away jobs. With his tweets on Thursday, he appears to be taking credit for fulfilling his campaign promises.\nBut the plant that Trump is referencing here was never in danger of closing or moving. In fact, Ford has previously said that under its current contract with the United Auto Workers Union, which doesn’t expire until 2019, they likely can’t close any U.S. plants to move them elsewhere.\n@Plumcrazy909 #Ford will maintain its U.S. jobs because two new vehicles are planned for Wayne, MI plant beginning in 2018.\n —  @Ford \nA spokeswoman for the company clarified in a statement on Thursday that Bill Ford had actually told the president-elect that the production of one type of vehicle, the Lincoln MKC SUV, would be staying in Louisiana. Ford had previously considered moving that production line to Mexico so that the company could ramp up production of the better-selling Ford Escape.\nSince the production of the Escape would replace any production of the Lincoln, union leaders said that no U.S. jobs would be lost, according to reporting by the Washington Post .\nMany major media outlets immediately jumped on Trump’s narrative without checking the facts.\nReuters :\nFortune :\nBloomberg: \nABC: \nThe New York Post :\nSome outlets, like the Wall Street Journal , suggested that Ford’s statement validated Trump:\nHowever, Trump tweeted about the plant , not the production of the vehicle. It’s not until four paragraphs in that the Wall Street Journal article notes the plant was never in danger of closing.\nThe entire plant was never going to move to Mexico. It’s unclear when the company made the decision to keep the one production line in Kentucky, and whether it was made before or after the election, as ABC News reports.\nWhile some of these articles clarify the facts in the body of the piece, research shows that more than half of Americans take their news just from the headlines — without reading the full articles themselves.\nAnd despite Trump’s victory lap, Ford confirmed to Reuters on Tuesday that the company will be moving ahead with plans to move small car production to Mexico by 2019, regardless of Trump’s election.\nCEO Mark Fields emphasized that there would be “no job impact whatsoever with this move.”\nTrump lied on Twitter, and the media spread it far and wide was originally published in ThinkProgress on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.",

      "text": "Trump took credit for saving a Ford plant that was never in any danger in the first place. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump addresses the Faith and Freedom Coalition’s Road to Majority Conference in Washington, Friday, June 10, 2016 CREDIT: AP Photo/Cliff Owen President-elect Donald Trump fired off two tweets on Thursday bragging about having saved American jobs. A Ford plant in Kentucky that was planning to move to Mexico, he alleged, was now going to stay in Kentucky because of his election.\nThe problem? There was never a Ford plant in Kentucky that was going to be moved to Mexico. Trump manufactured a crisis, and then took credit for solving it — and without pausing to verify the story, the media spread Trump’s version of reality far and wide.\nJust got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky - no Mexico\n —  @realDonaldTrump \nI worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!\n —  @realDonaldTrump \nOver the course of his campaign, Trump repeatedly swung at Ford for “leaving” the U.S. and taking away jobs. With his tweets on Thursday, he appears to be taking credit for fulfilling his campaign promises.\nBut the plant that Trump is referencing here was never in danger of closing or moving. In fact, Ford has previously said that under its current contract with the United Auto Workers Union, which doesn’t expire until 2019, they likely can’t close any U.S. plants to move them elsewhere.\n@Plumcrazy909 #Ford will maintain its U.S. jobs because two new vehicles are planned for Wayne, MI plant beginning in 2018.\n —  @Ford \nA spokeswoman for the company clarified in a statement on Thursday that Bill Ford had actually told the president-elect that the production of one type of vehicle, the Lincoln MKC SUV, would be staying in Louisiana. Ford had previously considered moving that production line to Mexico so that the company could ramp up production of the better-selling Ford Escape.\nSince the production of the Escape would replace any production of the Lincoln, union leaders said that no U.S. jobs would be lost, according to reporting by the Washington Post .\nMany major media outlets immediately jumped on Trump’s narrative without checking the facts.\nReuters :\nFortune :\nBloomberg: \nABC: \nThe New York Post :\nSome outlets, like the Wall Street Journal , suggested that Ford’s statement validated Trump:\nHowever, Trump tweeted about the plant , not the production of the vehicle. It’s not until four paragraphs in that the Wall Street Journal article notes the plant was never in danger of closing.\nThe entire plant was never going to move to Mexico. It’s unclear when the company made the decision to keep the one production line in Kentucky, and whether it was made before or after the election, as ABC News reports.\nWhile some of these articles clarify the facts in the body of the piece, research shows that more than half of Americans take their news just from the headlines — without reading the full articles themselves.\nAnd despite Trump’s victory lap, Ford confirmed to Reuters on Tuesday that the company will be moving ahead with plans to move small car production to Mexico by 2019, regardless of Trump’s election.\nCEO Mark Fields emphasized that there would be “no job impact whatsoever with this move.”\nTrump lied on Twitter, and the media spread it far and wide was originally published in ThinkProgress on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.",

      "title": "Trump on Twitter: Ford Won’t Move Lincoln Assembly to Mexico",
      "text": "  9:21   9:21 am Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks to a campaign rally, Monday, Nov. 7, 2016, in Manchester, N.H. (AP Photo/Charles Krupa) \nPresident-elect Donald Trump took to Twitter Thursday night to announce that Ford Motor Co. won’t be moving Lincoln production from Kentucky to Mexico. \nBill Ford, the company’s executive chairman, telephoned him with the news that a Lincoln plant would stay in Louisville, Trumpsaid in the tweet claiming credit for the decision. \nFord doesn’t have a plant that exclusively builds Lincolns, but it had planned to move production of the Lincoln MKC small SUV out of the Louisville Assembly Plant so it could make more Ford Escapes there. A company spokeswoman confirmed Thursday that Ford was considering MKC production at a factory in Cuautitlan, Mexico. The move was negotiated with the United Auto Workers union in 2015. \nCompany spokeswoman Christin Baker said she didn’t know when the decision was made to keep the MKC in Louisville or if Trump had any impact on it. It’s possible the decision was made before the election, because Escape sales have been falling since July, so additional production capacity in Louisville may not be needed. \n“We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States,” Baker said in an e-mail. \nThe development is the latest in a yearlong feud between Trump and Ford over plans to move production south of the border. The company plans to shift small-car production from suburban Detroit to Mexico to improve profitability of the lower-priced cars. CEO Mark Fields said Tuesday that the presidential election didn’t change the company’s plan. \nTrump wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and has called for a 35 percent tariff on goods shipped from Mexico in an effort to preserve U.S. manufacturing jobs. \nFord plans to move production of the Focus and C-Max small cars to Mexico from a plant in Wayne, Michigan. But jobs at the Wayne plant would be preserved because it’s getting a new SUV and small pickup truck. \n“I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!,” Trump said in a tweet. \nBill Ford met with Trump during the summer and spoke with him on Thursday, Baker said. Editor’s Picks",

      "text": "Posted on November 17, 2016 by Editor - Stock Markets News \n  DETROIT (Reuters) – Ford Motor Co Chief Financial Officer Bob Shanks told investors on Thursday it is too early to assess the impact of the election of Donald Trump U.S. president on its business over the next several years. Shanks said that Ford officials are communicating with the Trump transition team and that he was encouraged by the “change in tone” in Trump’s comments since his election last week. Shanks, speaking with Wall Street industry analysts in New York, said he expects that the North American Free Trade Agreement will be revised in a Trump administration. He said, however, that he is encouraged that the president-elect has said it wants the U.S. economy to grow, and that any changes to NAFTA would be “pro-growth, overall.” The Ford CFO said the automaker also expects a Trump administration to alter regulations on fuel economy and emissions, adding that while Ford still expects those regulations to stiffen in the next few years, that the pace toward more stringent fuel economy and emissions targets may slow. The market’s reaction to Trump’s election has not been overly dramatic, which tells him, Shanks said, that there are expectations of positive effects on the U.S. economy. “Look at how people seem to be responding, acting, now that (Trump) needs to govern as opposed to campaign. I think it’s different. So let’s just wait and see,” said Shanks. (Reporting by Bernie Woodall; editing by Chizu Nomiyama, G Crosse) Share This:",

      "text": "Trump touted a Ford factory staying in the US as an election win — but it was never leaving \nLate Thursday night, president-elect Donald Trump tweeted that he \"got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky — no Mexico.\" \nAs Business Insider's Chris Sanchez reported Thursday night , Trump followed that tweet with this one: \"I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!\" \nApart from Trump potentially making trouble for Ford's executive team by revealing details of conversations he had with Bill Ford — who has far as I know has never publicly commented on anything related to the automaker's production since stepping down as CEO in 2006 — the core issue here is that Ford wasn't contemplating any job cuts at the Louisville Assembly Plant, but wanted to replace production of a Lincoln vehicle, the MKC luxury crossover, with a mass-market SUV, the Ford Escape. \nThe vehicles share a manufacturing platform, which was developed in Europe as a vehicle called the Kuga. \nFord confirmed that it had considered moving MKC production to Mexico, but had jettisoned that idea . \nMKC production in at Louisville is dwarfed by Escape production — the former has sold around 20,000 units year-to-date, while the latter has sold more than 258,000, amid a boom in smaller crossovers and record sales levels in the US. The Lincoln sales are respectable, but the Escape sales are evidence of strong demand that Ford wants to meet. Commitment to the Kentucky plant \nIn fact, back in 2010, the carmaker invested $600 million in the Louisville plant, with financial support from the state of Kentucky, to be able to more effectively shift production from vehicle to vehicle, depending on consumer demand. The plant has been in operation since 1955. \nWhat's ultimately going on here is that Ford wants to adjust its product mix in the US, building fewer slow-selling small cars in the US and introducing new pickups and SUVs, vehicles that the market is hungry for right now and that can bring in higher profits. \nThe Ford Escape crossover. Matthew DeBord/Business Insider \nThe game plan is to shift small-passenger-car production to Mexico, to a new plant. It's worth noting that Ford isn't breaking new ground south of the border; the automaker opened its first Mexican plant in the mid-1960s and established a second during the Reagan administration. \nThe current US workforce will be reoriented to build more trucks and SUVs. If punitive tariffs were enacted, as Trump has proposed, on vehicles entering the US from Ford's Mexican plants, then Ford would have to consider discontinuing small-car production amid current market conditions. \nThis would be bad, as Ford needs the small vehicles in its lineup both to meet federal fuel-economy regulations and to hedge against future increases in gas prices and changing market conditions. Factories everywhere \nNow, you could ask why Ford doesn't just keep all vehicle production in the US (as if it ever has — Ford operates factories all over the world and has for decades). The problem is that it can't make enough money on smaller vehicles to justify devoting manufacturing capacity to them at the moment, or adding new capacity — but it can repurpose that capacity to build the more profitable vehicles that consumers want. \nFord — and for that matter the rest of the industry — doesn't want to add new capacity because the US market is at a sales peak. Building new factories now would mean idled factories later, when the market inevitably declines. \nAll of this enables Ford to do a better job of taking care of its existing and retired workforce. As the company continues to post good financial results quarter after quarter, it can share the wealth: earlier this year, the automaker and United Auto Workers announced that workers would get $9,300 apiece in profit-sharing payouts. \nProfits also enable Ford to keep its pension plans nearly fully funded, making for a better overall balance sheet. \nFord Chairman Bill Ford. William Thomas Cain/Getty Ford and the political football \nThe bottom line here is that Ford has ended up on the short end of a debate about jobs, at a time when the last thing the automaker is contemplating is long-term layoffs or plant closures. If Ford were planning to move significant truck production to Mexico, then there might be something going on with the carmaker using NAFTA to lower its labor costs — a move that would rile up the UAW in a major way. \nThat hasn't happened, so what Trump is suggesting here — in as much as 120 characters can suggest something meaningful — is that his cordial businessman's relationship with Bill Ford has convinced Ford to \"keep\" jobs in the US that it didn't intend to get rid of. \nInstead, Ford looks set to keep production in the US that it was considering shifting to Mexico. \nWeirdly, that's a sort of win-win and could signal the end of a war of words between Trump and Ford that escalated during the campaign. (For what it's worth, Trump and Bill Ford has reportedly been discussing these issues since before the election.) \nUnfortunately, the dustup also shows that the president-elect doesn't yet have a very strong understanding of an industry that's one of the most important drivers of the entire US economy.",

      "text": "Trump on Twitter: Ford won't move Lincoln assembly to Mexico by TOM KRISHER, AP Auto Writer \nFILE - In this Tuesday, Nov. 8, 2016 file photo, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at a campaign rally in Grand Rapids, (AP Photo/Paul Sancya, File) A A \nDETROIT (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump took to Twitter Thursday night to announce that Ford Motor Co. won't be moving Lincoln production from Kentucky to Mexico. \nBill Ford, the company's executive chairman, telephoned him with the news that a Lincoln plant would stay in Louisville, Trump said in the tweet claiming credit for the decision. \nFord doesn't have a plant that exclusively builds Lincolns, but it had planned to move production of the Lincoln MKC small SUV out of the Louisville Assembly Plant so it could make more Ford Escapes there. A company spokeswoman confirmed Thursday that Ford was considering MKC production at a factory in Cuautitlan, Mexico. The move was negotiated with the United Auto Workers union in 2015. \nCompany spokeswoman Christin Baker said she didn't know when the decision was made to keep the MKC in Louisville or if Trump had any impact on it. It's possible the decision was made before the election, because Escape sales have been falling since July, so additional production capacity in Louisville may not be needed. \n\"We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States,\" Baker said in an e-mail. \nThe development is the latest in a yearlong feud between Trump and Ford over plans to move production south of the border. The company plans to shift small-car production from suburban Detroit to Mexico to improve profitability of the lower-priced cars. CEO Mark Fields said Tuesday that the presidential election didn't change the company's plan. \nTrump wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and has called for a 35 percent tariff on goods shipped from Mexico in an effort to preserve U.S. manufacturing jobs. \nFord plans to move production of the Focus and C-Max small cars to Mexico from a plant in Wayne, Michigan. But jobs at the Wayne plant would be preserved because it's getting a new SUV and small pickup truck. \n\"I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!,\" Trump said in a tweet. \nBill Ford met with Trump during the summer and spoke with him on Thursday, Baker said. close ",

      "text": "President-elect Donald Trump tweeted Thursday night that he had convinced Ford to not close a factory in Kentucky. “I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky,” Trump tweeted . “I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!” \nThere was just one problem: The automaker wasn’t planning on closing the factory . (It was going to move production of the Lincoln MKC SUV to Mexico, but increase production of the Ford Escape, which is made in the same facility.) \nRegardless of Ford’s plans, the incident is just another illustration of how social media has been utilized to spread false information .\nEvery single one of these headlines is completely wrong, easily fact checked, and peddling a fake news story spread by the president-elect. pic.twitter.com/vsE41hFjZw \n— Matt McDermott (@mattmfm) November 18, 2016 \n\nIt’s an issue even President Barack Obama has been thinking about. He addressed the issue in a press conference in Germany this week. \nObama: \"If we are not serious about facts, and what's true and what's not… then we have problems.\" https://t.co/pO2n4KtSJv \n— Brian Stelter (@brianstelter) November 17, 2016 \n\nObama also, according to a profile by New Yorker editor David Remnick , had “talked almost obsessively” about a recent BuzzFeed story about how teens in Macedonia were creating pro-Trump websites that peddled fake stories. \nFacebook and sites like these have resulted in an environment where “everything is true and nothing is true,” Obama said: \n“An explanation of climate change from a Nobel Prize-winning physicist looks exactly the same on your Facebook page as the denial of climate change by somebody on the Koch brothers’ payroll. And the capacity to disseminate misinformation, wild conspiracy theories, to paint the opposition in wildly negative light without any rebuttal—that has accelerated in ways that much more sharply polarize the electorate and make it very difficult to have a common conversation.”\nThat marked a decisive change from previous political eras, he maintained. “Ideally, in a democracy, everybody would agree that climate change is the consequence of man-made behavior, because that’s what ninety-nine per cent of scientists tell us,” he said. “And then we would have a debate about how to fix it. That’s how, in the seventies, eighties, and nineties, you had Republicans supporting the Clean Air Act and you had a market-based fix for acid rain rather than a command-and-control approach. So you’d argue about means, but there was a baseline of facts that we could all work off of. And now we just don’t have that.”\nEven members of Trump’s incoming administration have shared these stories. \nIncoming NSC adviser retweeted an insane story about Hillary and sex crimes with children https://t.co/sJ99wYAw8a \n— Ryan Lizza (@RyanLizza) November 18, 2016 \n\nFor his part, Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg said hoaxes or fake news account for less than 1 percent of what people see in their News Feeds. Still, the issue is not going away, and it appears that journalists and news consumers will continue to find ways to address the spread of false narratives on platforms such as Facebook and Google. \n1. New reality for the press: the president-elect’s Twitter account is a competing media outlet spreading fake news. https://t.co/VPvjKnW5PI \n— James Poniewozik (@poniewozik) November 18, 2016 \n\n2. Starts out when Trump tweets the claim that he saved a factory that, in fact, wasn’t going to close: https://t.co/TMoLGKv5IZ \n— James Poniewozik (@poniewozik) November 18, 2016 \n\n3. Reuters then runs a story reporting “Trump says Ford not moving U.S. plant to Mexico,” with no corroboration: https://t.co/wm86o3sIg3 \n— James Poniewozik (@poniewozik) November 18, 2016 \n\n4. Detroit FP reports it as Ford keeping MKC production (true) w/o correcting false claim a factory was saved: https://t.co/g2DmPLIUgY \n— James Poniewozik (@poniewozik) November 18, 2016 \n\n5. By morning, several news outlets have debunked Trump’s claim: https://t.co/DWBj5Wrg7N \n— James Poniewozik (@poniewozik) November 18, 2016 \n\n6. But by this point, people are happily spreading “Trump saved a factory!” on social media: https://t.co/YkBesmyyi4 \n— James Poniewozik (@poniewozik) November 18, 2016 \n\n7. Oh, and as of 8:24 a.m., that weak USAT/Detroit FP story leads the Google News section on the topic. pic.twitter.com/RaYqMoXGnA \n— James Poniewozik (@poniewozik) November 18, 2016 \n\n8. The Reuters story is there, updated & w hed “Ford tells Trump no Lincoln SUV production going to Mexico”: https://t.co/xUllHevNMl \n— James Poniewozik (@poniewozik) November 18, 2016 \n\n9. But the fact that jobs that weren’t going to be lost *still aren’t going to be lost* is not the story. It's the fake news from PEOTUS.\n— James Poniewozik (@poniewozik) November 18, 2016 \n\n10. Pushing back on fake news—some spread by the president—is going to become a bigger part of the media’s job.\n— James Poniewozik (@poniewozik) November 18, 2016 \n\n11. I have no great answer. But at least news organizations could refrain from *helping* the fake news.\n— James Poniewozik (@poniewozik) November 18, 2016 \n\n12. A lie goes around the world while the truth is tying its shoes. At least don’t give the lie a ride to the airport. /end\n— James Poniewozik (@poniewozik) November 18, 2016 \n\n",

The investment will also fund educational and music programming at the museum, along with a CARaoke Experience that integrates music with Ford vehicles. \nFord and Ford-UAW announced a $6 million investment as lead donor in a $50 million expansion of Motown Museum.

It also fits with our commitment to investing in the cultural heritage of Detroit and southeast Michigan.” \nSaid Motown Museum chairwoman and CEO Robin Terry: “Motown and Ford Motor Company have wide and deeply connected roots. As two Detroit-born brands, they have had — and continue to have today — a transformative and profound impact on creativity and innovation around the world.\" Buy Photo \nThe Motown Museum's expansion includes this area, near Ferry Park and Holden streets in Detroit, behind the present-day museum.

Boone, Detroit Free Press) \nUAW vice president Jimmy Settles grew up in the area near the West Grand Boulevard site, and he told the Free Press last month he was enthusiastic about the prospect of Motown Museum growth. \nWith today's Ford announcement, Settles said: “It is very gratifying to support the expansion of the Motown Museum, and in doing so, we strengthen an institution that has great historical and cultural significance to our region and the world. This partnership also allows us to continue our commitment to the Motown Museum’s surrounding community, which is a community that many Detroit natives treasure.” 1564 CONNECT 5 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.freep.com/2fBNfLr More Stories",

      "text": "Thu, 17 Nov 2016 15:39 UTC © John Sommers/European Pressphoto Agency The Lincoln MKC on the assembly line at a Ford factory in Louisville, Ky., in 2014. Ford said it now planned to keep production of the vehicle at the plant. President-elect Donald Trump suggested on Twitter that he convinced Ford Motor Co. to keep production of a Lincoln sport utility vehicle in the U.S. instead of moving it to Mexico. And the automaker doesn't dispute that. \"Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky -- no Mexico,\" Trump wrote in a Twitter post. Ford builds the Lincoln MKC small SUV at its Louisville Assembly Plant in Kentucky alongside the Ford Escape SUV. Ford had never said it was considering shifting MKC production south of the border. But the company confirmed Friday that it had been \"likely\" to move the work to Mexico in 2019 when its current contract with the United Auto Workers union expires. \"We had planned to move the Lincoln MKC out of Louisville Assembly Plant,\" probably to the Cuautitlan factory in Mexico, Christin Baker, a Ford spokeswoman, said in an e-mail. Trump has criticized Ford for planning to move all its North American small-car production to Mexico, where wages are 80 percent lower than in the U.S. Ford also builds the Lincoln MKZ sedan at a factory in Hermosillo, Mexico. During the campaign, Trump threatened to slap Ford's Mexican-built cars with a 35 percent tariff . He also said he would terminate the North American Free Trade Agreement, which lets goods flow between Mexico, the U.S. and Canada without tariffs. Automaker 'Encouraged' Ford, which has expressed a willingness to work with Trump since he was elected, confirmed late Thursday it told the future president the Lincoln SUV will stay in Kentucky. \"We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the U.S.,\" the automaker said in an e-mailed statement. Bill Ford met with Trump during the campaign in an unsuccessful attempt to get the candidate to stop targeting the automaker, which says it has created nearly 28,000 jobs in the U.S. during the past five years. In his first answer of the first debate with Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, Trump attacked the automaker for plans to move production of the Focus small car and C-Max hybrid from a plant in Michigan to Mexico. \"We are everything that he should be celebrating about this country,\" Bill Ford told reporters in September. \"We pulled ourselves up by our bootstraps, we paid back our borrowings, we are healthy again, we've been adding jobs in the U.S. and we are the largest manufacturer of cars and trucks in the U.S.\"",

      "text": "Sprint Cup Series Ford EcoBoost 400 weekend TV and radio schedule By Ted Fleming/Fansided Nov 18, 2016 at 10:48a ET 0Shares Here is your complete viewing and listening guide for the Sprint Cup season finale from practice through qualifying and the race on Sunday at Homestead-Miami Speedway. \nOther than the Daytona 500, this Sunday is the most anticipated day on the Sprint Cup calendar because it is the final race of the season where a champion will be crowned after the Ford EcoBoost 400. Will it be Kyle Busch snaring his second consecutive title or will Jimmie Johnson come away with the seventh of his career? Carl Edwards or Joey Logano might have something to say about that as each seek their first. \nJohnson is looking to make history because he would become just the third Cup driver to reach seven championships tying him with Hall of Famers Richard Petty and Dale Earnhardt. It also marks the ten-year anniversary of Johnson’s first title, however, he has not won at this track over the course of his storied career. \nIt really doesn’t matter who wins the EcoBoost 400 because the highest finisher of the Championship Four will head into the winter wearing the crown. \nFor those who cannot make it to the track, he is all the information you will need to watch or listen to the Ford EcoBoost 400: \nVOICES: In the TV booth for the weekend are Rick Allen, Jeff Burton and Steve Letarte with pit reporters Dave Burns, Mike Massaro, Marty Snider, and Kelli Stavast. Rutledge Wood will provide featured reports. NBCSN and NBC pre/post-race hosts are Krista Voda, Kyle Petty, and Dale Jarrett. \nFRIDAY 12:30 p.m. – Sprint Cup Series first practice (NBC Sports Network, NBC Sports App)6:00 p.m. – Sprint Cup Series Coors Light Pole Qualifying (NBC Sports App, Performance Racing Network, Sirius XM NASCAR Radio, Channel 90 \nSATURDAY 10:00 a.m. – Sprint Cup Series second practice (CNBC, NBC Sports App)1:00 p.m. – Sprint Cup Series final practice (NBCSN, NBC Sports App) \nSUNDAY 11:30 a.m. – NASCAR RaceDay (Fox Sports 1)2:00 p.m. – NASCAR Sprint Cup Series Countdown to Green (NBC)3:00 p.m. – NASCAR Sprint Cup Series Ford EcoBoost 400, 400.5 miles | 267 laps (NBC, Performance Racing Network, Sirius XM NASCAR Radio, Channel 90) More from FanSided",

      "text": "print Workers assemble a Ford truck at the new Louisville Ford truck plant in Louisville. Bryan Woolston/Reuters \nLate Thursday night, president-elect Donald Trump tweeted that he \"got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky — no Mexico.\" \nAs Business Insider's Chris Sanchez reported Thursday night , Trump followed that tweet with this one: \"I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!\" \nApart from Trump potentially making trouble for Ford's executive team by revealing details of conversations he had with Bill Ford — who has far as I know has never publicly commented on anything related to the automaker's production since stepping down as CEO in 2006 — the core issue here is that Ford wasn't contemplating any job cuts at the Louisville Assembly Plant, but wanted to replace production of a Lincoln vehicle, the MKC luxury crossover, with a mass-market SUV, the Ford Escape. \nThe vehicles share a manufacturing platform, which was developed in Europe as a vehicle called the Kuga. \nFord confirmed that it had considered moving MKC production to Mexico, but had jettisoned that idea . \nMKC production in at Louisville is dwarfed by Escape production — the former has sold around 20,000 units year-to-date, while the latter has sold more than 258,000, amid a boom in smaller crossovers and record sales levels in the US. The Lincoln sales are respectable, but the Escape sales are evidence of strong demand that Ford wants to meet. Commitment to the Kentucky plant \nIn fact, back in 2010, the carmaker invested $600 million in the Louisville plant, with financial support from the state of Kentucky, to be able to more effectively shift production from vehicle to vehicle, depending on consumer demand. The plant has been in operation since 1955. \nWhat's ultimately going on here is that Ford wants to adjust its product mix in the US, building fewer slow-selling small cars in the US and introducing new pickups and SUVs, vehicles that the market is hungry for right now and that can bring in higher profits. \nThe Ford Escape crossover. Matthew DeBord/Business Insider \nThe game plan is to shift small-passenger-car production to Mexico, to a new plant. It's worth noting that Ford isn't breaking new ground south of the border; the automaker opened its first Mexican plant in the mid-1960s and established a second during the Reagan administration. \nThe current US workforce will be reoriented to build more trucks and SUVs. If punitive tariffs were enacted, as Trump has proposed, on vehicles entering the US from Ford's Mexican plants, then Ford would have to consider discontinuing small-car production amid current market conditions. \nThis would be bad, as Ford needs the small vehicles in its lineup both to meet federal fuel-economy regulations and to hedge against future increases in gas prices and changing market conditions. Factories everywhere \nNow, you could ask why Ford doesn't just keep all vehicle production in the US (as if it ever has — Ford operates factories all over the world and has for decades). The problem is that it can't make enough money on smaller vehicles to justify devoting manufacturing capacity to them at the moment, or adding new capacity — but it can repurpose that capacity to build the more profitable vehicles that consumers want. \nFord — and for that matter the rest of the industry — doesn't want to add new capacity because the US market is at a sales peak. Building new factories now would mean idled factories later, when the market inevitably declines. \nAll of this enables Ford to do a better job of taking care of its existing and retired workforce. As the company continues to post good financial results quarter after quarter, it can share the wealth: earlier this year, the automaker and United Auto Workers announced that workers would get $9,300 apiece in profit-sharing payouts. \nProfits also enable Ford to keep its pension plans nearly fully funded, making for a better overall balance sheet. \nFord Chairman Bill Ford. William Thomas Cain/Getty Ford and the political football \nThe bottom line here is that Ford has ended up on the short end of a debate about jobs, at a time when the last thing the automaker is contemplating is long-term layoffs or plant closures. If Ford were planning to move significant truck production to Mexico, then there might be something going on with the carmaker using NAFTA to lower its labor costs — a move that would rile up the UAW in a major way. \nThat hasn't happened, so what Trump is suggesting here — in as much as 120 characters can suggest something meaningful — is that his cordial businessman's relationship with Bill Ford has convinced Ford to \"keep\" jobs in the US that it didn't intend to get rid of. \nInstead, Ford looks set to keep production in the US that it was considering shifting to Mexico. \nWeirdly, that's a sort of win-win and could signal the end of a war of words between Trump and Ford that escalated during the campaign. (For what it's worth, Trump and Bill Ford has reportedly been discussing these issues since before the election.) \nUnfortunately, the dustup also shows that the president-elect doesn't yet have a very strong understanding of an industry that's one of the most important drivers of the entire US economy.",

      "text": "DETROIT (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump claimed Thursday that he convinced the chairman of Ford Motor Co. not to move an assembly plant from Kentucky to Mexico. But Ford never intended to move the plant, just production of one of the vehicles it makes.\nTrump said in a tweet that Bill Ford, the company’s executive chairman, telephoned him with the news that a “Lincoln plant” would stay in Louisville. Instead Ford decided to keep production of the Lincoln MKC small SUV at the Louisville Assembly Plant. Ford had previously said it would move production of the MKC out of the plant in order to build more Ford Escapes there.\nA factory in Cuautitlan, Mexico, was likely to get the MKC. Under a contract negotiated last year with the United Auto Workers, Ford agreed to invest $700 million in the Louisville plant in return for moving the MKC production. Because Escape production would increase, no Louisville jobs would be lost. It’s possible the decision to keep the MKC in Kentucky was made before the election, because Escape sales have been falling since July and additional production capacity in Louisville may not be needed. Ford spokeswoman Christin Baker said she didn’t know when that decision was made or if Trump had any impact on it. “I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!,” Trump said in the tweet claiming credit for Ford’s decision. Ford Motor Co. and Trump have engaged in a yearlong feud over the automaker’s plans to move production south of the border. The company plans to shift small-car production from suburban Detroit to Mexico to improve profitability of the lower-priced cars. CEO Mark Fields said Tuesday that the presidential election didn’t change the company’s plan. Trump wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and has called for a 35 percent tariff on goods shipped from Mexico in an effort to preserve U.S. manufacturing jobs. Ford plans to move production of the Focus and C-Max small cars to Mexico from a plant in Wayne, Michigan. But jobs at the Wayne plant would be preserved because it’s getting a new SUV and small pickup truck. Bill Ford met with Trump during the summer and spoke with him on Thursday, Baker said. “We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States,” she said in an e-mail.

      "text": "US President-Elect Donald Trump Claims To Halt Ford’s Move To Mexico But Did Ford Really Plan To Move Out Of The US? By Monique Austin , Parent Herald November 18, 11:10 am TAG Ford , US President-Elect Donald Trump , claims , Trump rumors TROY, MI - NOVEMBER 3: A Ford Motor Company sign stands at a Ford dealership November 3, 2008 in Troy, Michigan. Ford reported its October sales were down thirty percent from the same month last year, and General Motors reported a forty-five percent decline for October.(Photo : Photo by Bill Pugliano/Getty Images) \nUS President-elect Donald Trump took credit on Thursday that he has successfully halted Ford's move to Mexico and keep its Lincoln plant in the state of Kentucky. Ford, however, denied they never had such plans to begin with. Advertisement \nIn a tweet , US President-elect Donald Trump proudly said he received an \"advise\" from his friend Bill Ford, who is currently the Chairman of Ford, that the company will stay in the US. He further added that he \"worked hard\" to stop Ford's move to Mexico and that he was able to do it with the support of the people of Kentucky. Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky - no Mexico \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 18, 2016 I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 18, 2016 \n\nHowever, some things appear to be inconsistent with the tweet of US President-elect Donald Trump. Ford revealed through an official statement on Thursday night that they never confirmed anything about Ford's move to Mexico. Neither Ford's Kentucky Truck Plant in Louisville, the plant that produces Lincoln Navigator, nor the company's Louisville Assembly Plant, which manufactures the Ford Escape and the Lincoln MKC will be moved to Mexico. \nIn an official company statement, Ford said: \"Today, we confirmed with the President-elect that our small Lincoln utility vehicle made at the Louisville Assembly Plant will stay in Kentucky.\" Ford further added that they are \"encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve US competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States.\" \nDuring a follow-up email exchange, a spokeswoman from Ford revealed that the production of MKC models is scheduled to move to Mexico. Mark Fields, the chief executive at Ford, reiterated that Ford's move to Mexico from Michigan is still bound to happen. \nIt seems that this is not the first time that US President-elect Donald Trump has claimed credit for something that Ford has not actually planned or done. Trump also jumped on the issue about Ford's move to Mexico in October 2015 and claimed credit about halting the \"plan\" and convincing the company to have its plant in Ohio instead. \nDo you think Ford will move out of the US soon?

      "text": "COMMENTS (Wikipedia) \nFord Motor Company and UAW-Ford have announced a $6 million investment towards a planned expansion of the Motown Museum in Detroit. The figure makes the auto giant and union the lead donors in a recently announced $50 million upgrade that will create a new Ford-branded theater, space for interactive exhibits and a recording studio at the tourist attraction. \n\"We are thrilled to play a role in the next chapter of a global music icon,\" said Joe Hinrichs, president, The Americas, Ford Motor Company. \"The enhanced museum will not only upgrade the visitor experience, it also fits with our commitment to investing in the cultural heritage of Detroit and southeast Michigan.\" \nAs part of the Ford/UAW investment, the expanded Motown Museum will include a new venue to be called the Ford Motor Company Theater, as well as a new interactive activity called the CARaoke Experience that will incorporate music with Ford vehicles. The donation will also fuel educational, music and other programming. \n\"Motown and Ford Motor Company have wide and deeply connected roots,\" said Robin R. Terry, chairwoman and CEO, Motown Museum. \"As two Detroit born brands, they have had -- and continue to have today -- a transformative and profound impact on creativity and innovation around the world.\" \nThe Motown Museum is located in the Hitsville U.S.A. house where record company founder Berry Gordy launched his music empire in 1959. Scores of stars and hits were created there before the label moved to California in 1972. \nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.",

(Source: WAVE 3 News file photo) \nLOUISVILLE, KY (WAVE) - Ford Motor Co. confirmed Friday that it will continue to build its Lincoln MKC in Louisville. \nThe auto giant, which produces both Escapes and the MKC at one of its two Louisville-area facilities, made the confirmation following a pair of tweets Trump posted Thursday night. Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky - no Mexico — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 18, 2016 \nNearly 15 minutes later, Trump sent out another tweet. I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 18, 2016 \nThe tweets caused some confusion, particularly locally, prompting some Ford workers to reach out to WAVE 3 News for clarification. \nTo be clear, there is no Lincoln-specific plant in Kentucky, as Trump implied in both of the tweets. \nThe MKC is currently built at the Louisville Assemby Plant, and Ford has made it clear that there were never any plans to close that facility or reduce its workforce. The company has said publicly that it would shift MKC production so that it could produce more Escapes in Louisville. \nFord credited Trump's policies for its decision to keep producing the MKC in Louisville. \n\"Today, we confirmed with the President-elect that our small Lincoln utility vehicle made at the Louisville Assembly Plant will stay in Kentucky,\" Ford said in a release issued late Thursday. \"We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States.\" \nMORE FROM WAVE3.COM",

      "text": "(LINK) \nKentucky Governor Matt Bevin responds: 2 days ago, @realDonaldTrump told me he was working w/ @Ford to keep smaller vehicle production in KY & in USA..Tonight they delivered..TY! \n— Matt Bevin (@MattBevin) November 18, 2016 \nThe deep-dive back story that was only discussed here is below: \nSEPTEMBER 15TH 2016 – This is a really important interview to grasp the scope of the America-First economic challenge in front of Donald Trump and specifically U.S. workers. Unfortunately, what follows below is the best version of the interview we can find and it has edits, significant edits by CNN, to the initial portion of the interview as it originally aired. \nFor those unfamiliar with how structured these types of interviews are, there are a few key aspects worth noting in advance of watching the video: \n♦ CEO Mark Fields is not alone in this interview. Off camera there are key corporate executive advisers, PR, Marketing, HR, Risk Mgmt., etc. positioned to give immediate feedback toward any sound bites that can have an adverse impact on the corporate objectives. There’s a few times when you can see Fields taking cues from those voices. \n♦ The CEO corporate culture (starts in MBA school) teaches executives how to use code words and phrases to avoid pitfalls, and unless you are skilled -or familiar- in detecting the nuance, much of the significant verbiage can be missed. Words and phrases matter. \nThere’s a big difference between a major corporate CEO saying “ investment in North America “, and “ investment in America “. The former references international trade agreements such as NAFTA which apply to Mexico the U.S. and Canada, the latter is directed to the United States. Pay close attention and you’ll note the importance. \n♦ Notice how Mark Fields will not answer key and specific questions directly. Instead choosing to use parseltongue and politispeak coded language. This is a trained skill much like a professional politician is trained in non-answers that leave the viewer/listener the impression of an answer. \n♦ Pay additional attention to phrases such as: \n• “ retained or created jobs “, you’ll notice the similarity to “saved or created jobs” vis-a-vis the Obama stimulus. The use of the phrases holds a similar intent. \n• “ most of our investment is here in the U.S. “, this is a slight-of-word use. Of course Ford has most of their investment here in the U.S., the historic valued infrastructure is part of that phrase. \nThe issue for this conversation is “future investment or reinvestment”, and that’s where you see the verbiage shift (use of) “North America” coming into play. \n• “value market” is the term for cheaper cars. In this example the Ford Focus model. \nNotice also Poppy Harlow was finally able to pin Fields down on “40% labor savings”. That specific number is where you hear the counter Trump approach of a 35% tariff which would eliminate that incentive. If Ford saves 40% labor cost on Ford Focus vehicles by building in Mexico, and they face a 35% Tax upon re-import, the incentive to have Mexican workers build the vehicle is lost. Notice Mark Fields avoids answering that question. \nNotice also Harlow asks about the 40% savings and where that profit is reinvested. Notice how Fields says the monies return to the corporate structure (U.S.A.) where reinvestment determinations are made. However, the reinvestment determination, as previously outlined, is “a North American” and/or “global” determination. Parseltongue. \nOn one hand the CEO states the goal is to remain competitive in the “value market” (ie. cheap car market like Kia etc.), however, at the same time Fields never mentions lowering the price, because it’s the profit margin actually driving the decision – not any consumer savings. The U.S.A market (consumer) will not see Ford Focus vehicles drop in price; instead they’re just made in Mexico at a lower cost. \nThis key distinction is the heart of the Economic Patriotism argument. \nAn argument that Bernie Sanders has made effectively, Donald Trump has also recognized, and one which through the course of time -and history has empirically evidenced- creates terrible long-term consequences for the rapidly diminishing middle class U.S. worker. \nThe economic patriotism distinction is also where traditionally minded conservatives, like myself, have reevaluated the bigger picture and accepted the following: In a global world the concept of traditional economic models (for free-market capitalism) are no longer working on behalf of the United States of America – because there is no national pride or incentive attached to the end goal, profit. \nPaul Samuelson, the Nobel laureate from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, recalled that John Maynard Keynes once was challenged for altering his position on some economic issue: \n“When my information changes,” said Keynes “ I change my mind. What do you do Sir?” \nWhile I have never agreed with Keynesian economic theory, Keynes attributed quote itself is never more apropos than today’s 2016 American economics argument amid various conservatives. What good is Mark Levin’s definition of conservatism, when there’s no middle class America left to conserve? \nWhat good are George Will’s free market theories when the end result is the outflow of American wealth into poorer, less economically developed countries, while we EBT ourselves into a national debt crisis because we are trying to sustain the diminished value of the American worker? \nNot only is this historic approach now rapidly becoming the pathway into an unrecoverable American economic death spiral, it is also global wealth distribution done by Wall Street, not Main Street. \nThe result, our result, is an ever expanding, seemingly impossible to stop, wealth gap, creating an unnatural and profoundly unhealthy class system, in America, between the “Rich” and “Poor”. \nWe do not need socialism to fix the problem, we need economic patriotism from industrial giants, Main Street, who value the principles behind putting American-workers-First. \nNow, watch the video [*Note* ignore the pontificating liberalism of Poppy Harlow or you’ll miss important stuff]: \nFord is willing to spend $1.6 BILLION to create 2,800 jobs in Mexico, to save 40% on the price of their “value product line” of automobiles. \nIf a Ford Focus costs $8,000 to manufacture (in Mexico). How many Focus’s would they need to sell at an additional 40% profit margin to make up for their initial investment of $1.6 BILLION. Do the math, and you’ll realize why I shall never again purchase a Ford vehicle. \nFord CEO Mark Fields, like many modern vulture capitalists, is a globalist – not an America-First CEO.",

      "title": "Trump lied to make it look like he saved American jobs at Ford",
      "text": "10 \nIt’s going to be relevant quite often in the next four years, so say it with me, media: “Donald Trump lied.” That’s L-I-E-D. As in, knowingly told a falsehood. Today’s edition: Donald Trump lied about keeping Ford from closing a plant in Kentucky and moving it to Mexico. “ Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford,” Trump tweeted , continuing that Ford “ advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky—no Mexico.” That is seriously misleading but not yet a lie. This is: x \nI worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 18, 2016 \nFord is keeping its Kentucky plant. But there’s a reason we know Trump had nothing to do with that decision—that’s because Ford never planned to close the plant , and had announced what its real plans were last year: \nFord has never announced plans to move to Mexico either its Kentucky Truck Plant in Louisville, which produces the Lincoln Navigator, or the Louisville Assembly Plant, which produces the Lincoln MKC and the Ford Escape. \nIn a statement on Thursday night, following Trump's tweet, the company said it had told Trump it would cancel a plan to shift production of a single model — the MKC — from Kentucky to Mexico. The company last year indicated it would be moving MKC production out of Louisville, though it did not announce where it was going. At the time, union leaders said the shift would not cost any jobs in Kentucky, because Escape production would replace lost MKC production. \nSo let’s ditch the euphemisms. Once you’ve laid out the facts, established that Trump was wrong about said facts, and established that Trump had every opportunity to know what the facts were, call a lie a lie. A misstatement is when he says that November 28 is Election Day. This is not a misstatement: \nThis isn't the first time Trump has misstated facts about a Ford move. In October 2015, he tweeted that the company had halted plans to build a factory in Mexico and would locate in Ohio instead, and he claimed credit for the decision. The company said he was wrong, and that it was continuing to build its plant in Mexico. \nThat’s a lie. It’s a lie told for an obvious purpose—to make it look like Donald Trump is keeping jobs in the U.S. And if he lies about enough jobs being kept in the U.S. because of him, he could fool some people into believing that he is better for the economy than he is. \nIt’s a short word. It’s not hard to spell. It has a clear meaning. L-I-E.",

      "text": "President-elect Donald Trump took credit this week for stopping Ford from moving an assembly plant from the U.S. to Mexico--but the automaker actually had no plans to relocate the plant.\nTrump wrote in a pair of tweets on Thursday evening that he \"worked hard\" with Ford Motor Co.

Trump said Thursday that the executive called to tell him \"he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky--no Mexico.\"\n\"I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!\" Trump added.\nHowever, U.S. jobs were never at stake, according to reports. Ford currently produces the Lincoln MKC and the Ford Escape at its Louisville Assembly Plant, the Washington Post reports. The company had considered moving production of the Lincoln MKC from Kentucky to Mexico in order to build more Ford Escapes at the Kentucky plant, but Ford had previously said the change wouldn’t lead to any lost jobs in Kentucky.\nNow, though, the company is keeping Lincoln MKC production in Kentucky and will not produce additional Ford Escapes there. It was not immediately clear when Ford made the decision.\n \nFord issued a statement after Trump's announcement, saying the company \"confirmed\" with Trump that \"our small Lincoln utility vehicle made at the Louisville Assembly Plant will stay in Kentucky,\" according to the Post .\n\"We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States,\" the statement said.\nJust got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky – no Mexico\n— Donald J.

      "text": "By Rafa Fernandez De Castro \nDonald Trump once again appears to be overstating his negotiating skills. \nOn Thursday night the Twitter-happy president-elect claimed he had successfully stopped the Ford Motor Company from relocating one of its assembly plants from Kentucky to Mexico. Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky – no Mexico \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 18, 2016 I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 18, 2016 \nBut the company says it never planned to close the plant or even reduce jobs there, according to NPR. \nInstead, the company was reportedly planning to relocate production of its Lincoln MKC utility vehicle to Mexico to make more room at the Kentucky plant to scale-up production on the Ford Escape. But the company changed its plans and will now keep Lincoln production at the Kentucky plant and make fewer Escapes there, according to the New York Times . \nEither way, the Kentucky plant wasn’t going anywhere and Trump probably didn’t save any jobs. Ford does, however, plan to move forward on moving other small-car production to Mexico. \n“We’re going forward with our plan to move production of the Ford Focus to Mexico, and importantly that’s to make room for two very important products we’ll be putting back into Michigan plants,” Ford CEO Mark Fields told Reuters last week during the Los Angeles Auto Show. “There will be no job impact whatsoever with this move.” \nFusion reached out to Ford for comment but didn’t receive an immediate response. \nDuring the primaries, Trump called Ford’s plans to invest $1.6 billion to build a new factory in Mexico “an absolute disgrace” and promised to impose tariffs on U.S. companies that move to Mexico. \n“These ridiculous, job-crushing transactions will not happen when I am president,” he promised.

      "text": "LOUISVILLE, KY (WAVE) - Ford Motor Co. confirmed Friday that it will continue to build its Lincoln MKC in Louisville.\nThe auto giant, which produces both Escapes and the MKC at one of its two Louisville-area facilities, made the confirmation following a pair of tweets Trump posted Thursday night.\nJust got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky - no Mexico\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 18, 2016 Nearly 15 minutes later, Trump sent out another tweet.  \nI worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 18, 2016 The tweets caused some confusion, particularly locally, prompting some Ford workers to reach out to WAVE 3 News for clarification.\nTo be clear, there is no Lincoln-specific plant in Kentucky, as Trump implied in both of the tweets. \nThe MKC is currently built at the Louisville Assemby Plant, and Ford has made it clear that there were never any plans to close that facility or reduce its workforce. The company has said publicly that it would shift MKC production so that it could produce more Escapes in Louisville.\nFord credited Trump's policies for its decision to keep producing the MKC in Louisville.\n\"Today, we confirmed with the President-elect that our small Lincoln utility vehicle made at the Louisville Assembly Plant will stay in Kentucky,\" Ford said in a release issued late Thursday. \"We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States.\" \nMORE FROM WAVE3.COM\n+  Building The Bridges: Who'll pay to keep the East End tunnels safe, clear? \n+  Churchill Downs announces another expansion project \n+  KSP trooper, Good Samaritan save child after accident \nCopyright 2016  WAVE 3 News .

      "text": "Donald Trump takes credit for helping to save a Ford plant that wasn’t closing Friday November 18, 2016 Print Article \nWASHINGTON, Nov 18 — President-elect Donald J. Trump claimed credit last night for persuading Ford to keep an automaking plant in Kentucky rather than moving it to Mexico. The only wrinkle: Ford was not actually planning to move the plant. \nTrump wrote on Twitter shortly after 9pm Eastern time that Ford’s chairman, William Clay Ford Jr., had just told him that Ford “will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky — no Mexico”. \nBill Ford Jr, cited in Donald Trump tweet. — Reuters file pic Minutes later, Trump wrote in a second post: “I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!” Trump won 62.5 per cent of the state’s popular vote in the presidential election. \nDuring the campaign, he repeatedly criticised Ford for moving production to Mexico, and he threatened to impose a 35 per cent tariff on vehicles made there. \nFord makes the Lincoln MKC, a sport utility vehicle, at a factory in Louisville. Last week, Ford said it planned to move production of the vehicle elsewhere. Last night, after Trump’s Twitter messages, the company said that Mexico had been the intended destination and that it would now keep MKC production in Kentucky. \nBut Ford had not planned to close the Louisville factory. Instead, it had planned to expand production of another vehicle made in Louisville, the Ford Escape. And the change had not been expected to result in any job losses. \n“Whatever happens in Louisville, it will not lose employment,” Jimmy Settles, a union official, told The Detroit Free Press . “They cannot make enough Escapes.” \nNow, thanks to Trump, the plant will make fewer Escapes — and more MKCs. \n“We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve US competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States,” Ford said in a statement. — New York Times",

      "text": "  Ford To Stay In America, Two Trump Thumbs Up On This One November 18, 2016 By Jeremy Lutz Leave a Comment \nHello MarketClub members everywhere. You've probably heard by now that the Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) is not going to be moving one of its plants to Mexico. Finally, the U.S. is waking up and realizing that it cannot be a superpower while having a service economy. Whether you voted for Trump or not, I think we have to give him credit for this save. Hopefully, some of the other promises he made will also help the U.S. economy like lowering taxes and nixing some of the onerous regulations that are handicapping businesses in the U.S. \nSo far the markets seem to like what they see with all of the indexes higher for the week. The big winner this week was the NASDAQ (NASDAQ:COMP) which jumped +1.84%. \nHowever, the biggest winner for the week is Crude Oil (NYMEX:CL.Z16.E) which is up +5.32% for the week. The big loser is gold (NYMEX:GC.Z16.E) which is down -0.87%. Let’s examine how the Trade Triangles are positioned in both of these markets. \nCrude Oil: The Trade Triangles are mixed - indicating a sidelines position. \nDecember Gold: All of the Trade Triangles are Red - indicating a negative trend. \nOnce again, MarketClub’s Trade Triangles point the way to successful trading. If you are not tracking the Trade Triangles, you may decide to do so after looking how they are positioned in many of the markets. \nLooking at the major indices here are the changes so far this week (Thursday Closes).",

      "text": "WASHINGTON — President-elect Donald J. Trump claimed credit on Thursday night for persuading Ford to keep an automaking plant in Kentucky rather than moving it to Mexico. The only wrinkle: Ford was not actually planning to move the plant.\nTrump wrote on Twitter shortly after 9 p.m. Eastern time that Ford’s chairman, William Clay Ford Jr., had just told him that Ford “will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky — no Mexico.”\nJust got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky – no Mexico\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 18, 2016\nMinutes later, Trump wrote in a second post: “I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!” Trump won 62.5 percent of the state’s popular vote in the presidential election.\nI worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 18, 2016\nDuring the campaign, he repeatedly criticized Ford for moving production to Mexico, and he threatened to impose a 35 percent tariff on vehicles made there.\nFord makes the Lincoln MKC, a sport utility vehicle, at a factory in Louisville. Last week, Ford said it planned to move production of the vehicle elsewhere. On Thursday night, after Trump’s Twitter messages, the company said that Mexico had been the intended destination and that it would now keep MKC production in Kentucky.\nBut Ford had not planned to close the Louisville factory. Instead, it had planned to expand production of another vehicle made in Louisville, the Ford Escape. And the change had not been expected to result in any job losses.\n“Whatever happens in Louisville, it will not lose employment,” Jimmy Settles, a union official, told The Detroit Free Press . “They cannot make enough Escapes.”\nNow, thanks to Trump, the plant will make fewer Escapes — and more MKCs.\n“We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States,” Ford said in a statement.",

      "text": "  18 2016 11:18 AM Trump Bragged About Saving a Ford Factory That Was Never Closing Ford Chairman Bill Ford has described himself as \"frustrated\" and \"infuriated\" by Trump's past mischaracterizations of the company's plans. Photo by Allison Shelley/Getty Images \nSeemingly unable to contain his pride, President-elect Trump on Thursday night boasted on Twitter that Ford won’t be moving its production facility to Mexico after all. Will Oremus \nWill Oremus is Slate ’s senior technology writer. Email him at or follow him on Twitter . \nOn the campaign trail earlier this year, Trump had railed against Ford’s plans to build a new assembly line for small cars, including the Ford Focus, in Mexico. He called the planned shift in production from U.S.-based Ford facilities “ an absolute disgrace ” and an example of the problems with the North American Free Trade Agreement, and he proposed to slap a 35 percent tariff on cars made in Mexico. Advertisement \nSo his supporters on Twitter greeted with glee a pair of tweets on Thursday in which Trump appeared to claim victory and take credit for changing Ford’s mind: Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky - no Mexico — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 18, 2016 I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 18, 2016 \nAw shucks, Kentucky, it was the least he could do! @realDonaldTrump We love you Potus Trump pic.twitter.com/UEhUzqWIgy — oregon4TRUMP (@shawgerald4) November 18, 2016 \nOne problem: Ford never said it was planning to move its \"Lincoln plant in Kentucky\" to Mexico. In fact, it has been steadily adding jobs at its Kentucky Truck Plant and recently began building a new Super Duty pickup there , a move that Ford has touted as evidence of its commitment to U.S. manufacturing. There has been talk of shifting production of the Lincoln MKC utility vehicle from its Louisville Assembly Plant, but as of last year the rumored destination was Chicago , not Mexico. \nRather, Ford has said all along that it was planning to shift small-car production to Mexico from plants in Michigan. But it has also said that the shift would make room for two new products in Michigan, and that no jobs would be lost as a result of the move. Advertisement \nFord reaffirmed just this week that it will go ahead with the Mexico plant as planned regardless of Trump’s election. \nSo what’s the truth behind Trump’s tweet? Contacted by Slate for comment, Ford issued an emailed statement that read, in part: Today, we confirmed with the President-elect that our small Lincoln utility vehicle made at the Louisville Assembly Plant will stay in Kentucky. We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States. \nFord did not respond to a follow-up question as to whether it ever had plans to move production of the MKC to Mexico, and if so, why it didn’t disclose those plans. But the company told the Washington Post 's Jim Tankersley that it had been planning such a move , and that it would not proceed with it. Regardless, Reuters reports that Ford had no plans to close either of its Kentucky facilities , or any U.S. factories, and no jobs were slated to be lost in Kentucky as a result of the MKC's production shift. Instead, as the New York Times explains, the plan was to build more Ford Escapes at the Louisville Assembly Plant . The Escape has proven far more popular than the MKC. Advertisement \nWhether Trump had anything to do with Ford's decision was not immediately clear, as the company deflected questions Thursday night about the president-elect's influence on its plans. On Friday, however, the company had adjusted its story, telling the Houston Chronicle 's Lydia DePillis that Trump had in fact played a role in the announcement. It remains to be seen whether Trump offered the company anything in return, such as dropping his Mexican tariff plan. \nThis is not the first time Trump has convinced people he had successfully persuaded Ford to keep jobs in the United States. More than a year ago he issued an eerily similar tweet taking credit for altering the automaker’s plans: Top Comment \n\"Just noticed that the sun came up today, you're welcome, America!\"\"Thanks to my leadership, the Statue of Liberty will not be moving to Malawi! Thanks for your support, New York!\" I could do this all day. More...",

      "text": "Ford Motor Co., cutting its 2017 profit forecast for the second time in three months, said it sees a bumpier future as President-elect Donald J. Trump translates his campaign promises into new policies on trade, tariffs and regulation.\n\"It feels like a world that's even more volatile,\" Bob Shanks, Ford's chief financial officer, said in a presentation to analysts today. The Trump administration \"is going to be an opportunity for substantial change.\"\nComplicating matters, those changes are coming just as U.S. auto sales are slowing after a record six straight years of growth -- meaning there's now a glut of used cars that is hurting profit at its Ford Credit unit. On an optimistic note, Shanks said the automaker does expect Trump to have a \"pro-growth\" strategy for the economy. That might include easing tough fuel-economy regulations to reflect consumers' preference for trucks and sport utility vehicles -- instead of electric cars -- in an era of cheap gasoline.\nFord CEO says production plans on track despite election Tribune news services Ford Motor Co. CEO Mark Fields says the presidential election won't change the company's plans to move small car production to Mexico.\nPresident-elect Donald Trump has repeatedly criticized Ford for moving production to Mexico. Trump wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement ...\nFord Motor Co. CEO Mark Fields says the presidential election won't change the company's plans to move small car production to Mexico.\nPresident-elect Donald Trump has repeatedly criticized Ford for moving production to Mexico. Trump wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement ...\n(Tribune news services) \"If the new government is serious about accelerating and growing in a very healthy way the U.S. economy -- and I believe it is -- I think it will take measures that will enable that,\" Shanks said. Hitting Ford with a 35 percent duty on cars it makes in Mexico and brings back to the U.S., as Trump threatened during the campaign, \"would be contrary to that.\"\nFord is talking to Trump's transition team, while also speaking with federal regulators about how low gas prices are undermining efforts to get Americans to buy electric cars and hybrids so that automakers can achieve a goal to average more than 50 miles per gallon by 2025.\n\"There's been no movement whatsoever for electrified products, which is probably driven by the fact that gas prices are so low,\" Shanks said. \"It's just not what any of us had expected, including the government. And it's going to be very difficult, therefore, to get there without pushing on the customers things they just don't want.\"\nMore immediately, Ford is still adjusting to a slowing auto market -- cutting its forecast for 2017 pretax profits because of declining auction values for used cars. Ford shares fell 1.1 percent to $11.87 in New York and had declined 14 percent this year through Thursday.\nPretax earnings for the automaker's credit unit next year will be about $1.5 billion, $300 million lower than its previous estimate, the company said Thursday in a regulatory filing. In September, Ford reduced its 2016 profit prediction by $600 million due to rising recall costs. The second-largest U.S. automaker reiterated that it expects total company adjusted pretax profit to drop in 2017 as it invests in \"emerging opportunities,\" and forecast improvement in 2018.\nFord to build small-car factory in Mexico, adding 2,800 jobs Tribune news services Ford Motor Co. plans to build a new $1.6 billion auto assembly plant in Mexico, creating about 2,800 jobs and shifting small-car production from the U.S. at a time when moving jobs south of the border has become a major issue in the U.S. presidential campaign.\nThe company announced the plant in...\nFord Motor Co. plans to build a new $1.6 billion auto assembly plant in Mexico, creating about 2,800 jobs and shifting small-car production from the U.S. at a time when moving jobs south of the border has become a major issue in the U.S. presidential campaign.\nThe company announced the plant in...\n(Tribune news services) Hertz Global Holdings Inc. last week cut its annual earnings forecast, citing a drop in used-car values, especially for compact and mid-sized cars, which have come under pressure as American buyers shift to pickups and sport utility vehicles.\nFord has undertaken an extensive, expensive effort to transform itself to take on interlopers including Uber Technologies Inc. and Google. The carmaker has said it will be selling 100,000 robot taxis -- without a steering wheel, gas or brake pedals -- annually by 2021. It's also investing $4.5 billion to convert 40 percent of its product lineup to electrified vehicles by 2020 and has begun offering bike sharing and a commuter van service in San Francisco.\n\"Clearly the investments we're making in emerging opportunities, whether it's electrification or autonomy or mobility, will impact our earnings,\" Chief Executive Officer Mark Fields said on Bloomberg TV last month. \"Further out, those businesses will start to contribute to the company's bottom line.\"\n  Automotive Industry Trucks, SUVs and Crossovers Donald Trump",

      "text": "OK, President-elect Donald Trump's spin on Ford's ( F ) statement about keeping Lincoln SUV production in Kentucky was an exaggeration wrapped in overstatement wrapped in hyperbole.\nIn fact, Ford hadn't previously stated any intention to move the Lincoln MKC crossover to Mexico. Yet Trump took to Twitter on Thursday evening to take credit for \"working things out\" with Bill Ford Jr., Ford's executive chairman, to the benefit of Kentucky.\nOr, as he tweeted in his @realDonTrump account: \"I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!\"\nThe temptation might be to criticize Trump as the nonsensical, uninformed blowhard he proved himself to be not infrequently during the presidential campaign. Rather, I see his latest statement -- however awkward -- as a hopeful development, perhaps an indication that the president-elect has gained an appreciation for the importance of brisk automotive trade among the countries of North America.\nFord is moving its car production to Mexico in order to lower costs and perhaps make a profit, or at least lose less, on that difficult part of the business. The reason Ford continues to manufacture cars at all is that it's necessary to comply with federally mandated fuel-efficiency rules, which make little sense but are the law.\nIn terms of trade, the tariff-free movement of parts, components and vehicles across the Canadian and Mexican borders with the U.S. has been continuous for years and remains a vital ingredient in the profitability of Ford and General Motors ( GM ) , not to mention Fiat Chrysler Automobiles   ( FCAU ) and thousands of suppliers and suppliers to suppliers.",

      "text": "DETROIT (AP) -- President-elect Donald Trump claimed Thursday that he convinced the chairman of Ford Motor Co. not to move an assembly plant from Kentucky to Mexico. But Ford never intended to move the plant, just production of one of the vehicles it makes.\nTrump said in a tweet that Bill Ford, the company&apos;s executive chairman, telephoned him with the news that a \"Lincoln plant\" would stay in Louisville. Instead Ford decided to keep production of the Lincoln MKC small SUV at the Louisville Assembly Plant. Ford had previously said it would move production of the MKC out of the plant in order to build more Ford Escapes there.\nA factory in Cuautitlan, Mexico, was likely to get the MKC. Under a contract negotiated last year with the United Auto Workers, Ford agreed to invest $700 million in the Louisville plant in return for moving the MKC production. Because Escape production would increase, no Louisville jobs would be lost.\nIt&apos;s possible the decision to keep the MKC in Kentucky was made before the election, because Escape sales have been falling since July and additional production capacity in Louisville may not be needed.\nOn Friday, Ford would say only that the MKC decision was \"recent,\" but spokeswoman Christin Baker wouldn&apos;t say exactly when it was made or whether Trump directly influenced it.\nThe MKC and Escape are essentially the same vehicle and are now built by the same workers on the same assembly line. But while Ford has sold over 258,000 Escapes so far this year, it&apos;s only sold about 21,000 MKCs. So, moving the MKC would have had little impact on the factory even if Escape production was not increased.\nStill, Trump claimed credit for saving a factory from moving to Mexico. \"I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!\" Trump said in one of two tweets on the subject. His initial tweet said: \"Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky - no Mexico.\"\nFord Motor Co. and Trump have engaged in a yearlong feud over the automaker&apos;s plans to move production south of the border. The company plans to shift small-car production from suburban Detroit to Mexico to improve profitability of the lower-priced cars. CEO Mark Fields said Tuesday that the presidential election didn&apos;t change the company&apos;s plan.\nTrump wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and has called for a 35 percent tariff on goods shipped from Mexico in an effort to preserve U.S. manufacturing jobs.\nFord plans to move production of the Focus and C-Max small cars to Mexico from a plant in Wayne, Michigan. But jobs at the Wayne plant would be preserved because it&apos;s getting a new SUV and small pickup truck.\n\"We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States,\" Baker said in an email.\n ",

      "title": "President-elect Trump lies about getting Ford to keep auto plant in Kentucky",
      "text": "In Politics by Drew Salisbury / November 18, 2016 Share < br />this article: Follow @raisedinthecity \nPresident-elect Trump lied to the American public Thursday by implying on Twitter that he had successfully pressured the Ford Motor Company to keep a plant in Kentucky instead of moving it to Mexico, saving thousands of U.S. jobs. In reality, Ford never had any intention to close any U.S. auto plant, and indeed, is legally unable to do so under terms of a United Auto Workers contract that doesn’t expire until 2019. Nevertheless, Trump took credit for the non-existent accomplishment. Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky – no Mexico \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 18, 2016 \nI worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 18, 2016 \nEarlier this year, Ford had announced a plan to eventually move the assembly of a specific auto line, the MKC, from Louisville to Mexico, but no jobs would be lost because production would be replaced by the Escape model. In fact, Ford had previously announced an investment in the Kentucky plant of $1.3 billion that will result in the creation of 2,000 American jobs, according to the automaker. \n“Whatever happens in Louisville, it will not lose employment,” Jimmy Settles, a union official, told The Detroit Free Press last year. “They cannot make enough Escapes.” \nWhile the Ford company supported President-elect Trump throughout the 2016 race, it regularly took issue with statements the then-Republican nominee made about the automaker it said were either misleading or completely untrue . When the company announced similar plans to move assembly of the C-Max and Focus from Michigan to Mexico but replace production with a new Ranger pick and the Bronco SUV, Trump said Ford was going to “fire all of their employees in the United States” and “we can’t allow it to happen.” However, again, the assembly production was not going to cost a single American their job. \nFord released a statement after Trump’s tweet stating they had confirmed to the president-elect their decision to keep production of the MKC in Kentucky. They did not correct his false assertion that they had planned on closing and moving a plant. \nTrump’s bald-faced lie is already being shared by conservatives and faux news outlets as a success by the president-elect, however. It’s clear that this will be one of the major battles of his administration — figuring out how to combat a commander-in-chief who doesn’t care about facts when the country is happy to be spoon-fed fake bullshit on Facebook . How do you fight a liar in a post-truth world? It’s enough to make you long for the “truthiness” of the Bush years.",

      "text": "DETROIT (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump claimed Thursday that he convinced the chairman of Ford Motor Co. not to move an assembly plant from Kentucky to Mexico. But Ford never intended to move the plant, just production of one of the vehicles it makes. Trump said in a tweet that Bill Ford, the company’s executive chairman, telephoned him with the news that a “Lincoln plant” would stay in Louisville. Instead Ford decided to keep production of the Lincoln MKC small SUV at the Louisville Assembly Plant. Ford had previously said it would move production of the MKC out of the plant in order to build more Ford Escapes there. A factory in Cuautitlan, Mexico, was likely to get the MKC. Under a contract negotiated last year with the United Auto Workers, Ford agreed to invest $700 million in the Louisville plant in return for moving the MKC production. Because Escape production would increase, no Louisville jobs would be lost.\nIt’s possible the decision to keep the MKC in Kentucky was made before the election, because Escape sales have been falling since July and additional production capacity in Louisville may not be needed. Ford spokeswoman Christin Baker said she didn’t know when that decision was made or if Trump had any impact on it.\n“I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!,” Trump said in the tweet claiming credit for Ford’s decision.\nI worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 18, 2016 \nFord Motor Co. and Trump have engaged in a yearlong feud over the automaker’s plans to move production south of the border. The company plans to shift small-car production from suburban Detroit to Mexico to improve profitability of the lower-priced cars. CEO Mark Fields said Tuesday that the presidential election didn’t change the company’s plan.\nTrump wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and has called for a 35 percent tariff on goods shipped from Mexico in an effort to preserve US manufacturing jobs.\nFord plans to move production of the Focus and C-Max small cars to Mexico from a plant in Wayne, Michigan. But jobs at the Wayne plant would be preserved because it’s getting a new SUV and small pickup truck.\nBill Ford met with Trump during the summer and spoke with him on Thursday, Baker said.\n“We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve US competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States,” she said in an e-mail.\n ",

      "text": "Donald Trump tried to take credit for keeping a Kentucky Ford plant in the US that was never going to leave. A union contract was the real reason why the plant was always going to stay in the United States. \nPresident-elect Trump tried to take credit for keeping the Ford plant in Kentucky on Thursday night: Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky – no Mexico \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 18, 2016 I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 18, 2016 \nFord’s CEO said that the plant was never moving to Mexico, but that production was shifting to make room for new products that will be produced at plants in Michigan and Kentucky. Reuters reported that even if Ford wanted to move the plant to Mexico, they couldn’t, due to a union contract, “But Ford has repeatedly said it has no plans to close any U.S. plants and likely could not do so under the terms of the current United Auto Workers contract that expires in 2019.” \nDonald Trump took credit for something that was never going to happen because the workers in that Ford plant are protected by a union. \nIt wasn’t Donald Trump who saved those jobs. It was collective bargaining. \nWithout a union, Ford would have been free to move the plants anywhere. \nPresident-elect Trump is anti-union, but it is unions who are capable of saving manufacturing jobs from going overseas. \nTrump didn’t do anything. He “prevented” a plant from moving that was never going to move due to collective bargaining rights that he opposes. \nThe real hero is the union, not a president-elect who is trying to take credit for something that he had nothing to do with.",

Or at least it would be if it were true. \nThe President-elect claims to have heard from Ford chairman Bill Ford that the car company will be keeping its Lincoln plant in Kentucky, rather than moving it to Mexico. \n*a cheer goes up* Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky - no Mexico \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 18, 2016 \nBut wait, let's take a closer look. That plant Trump has been speaking about to Ford in an effort to ensure it remains in America? There were never any plans to move it. \nAs Reuters notes, Trump has been critical of Ford moving smaller car production south of the border, something which is still going to happen . \nSo, and I'll say this loudly for those of you at the back, he's not stopped what he wanted to stop, while the thing he's proudly announcing is - wait for it - exactly what was going to happen anyway.

The 'no Mexico' line is basically window-dressing as that was never in the equation for the Lincoln SUV plant. \nSlate 's Will Oremus has been doing some fact-checking throughout, including claiming that even Reuters fell for the President-elect's spin before amending their follow-up story. \nAnd this is corroborated by NYMag 's Jesse Singal , in this Twitter thread which raises some important questions. 1/ Something really really scary appeared to have just happened and I hope people understand why it matters amidst all the other chaos. \n— Jesse Singal (@jessesingal) November 18, 2016 2/ Our president-elect tweeted something that clearly implies his election prevented a plant from moving south https://t.co/YCwitwgdmX \n— Jesse Singal (@jessesingal) November 18, 2016 Advertisement 3/As @ddale8 points out, there's no such plant in that area that was slated to move to Mexico. https://t.co/vO2m78iYVB …PEOTUS appears to \n— Jesse Singal (@jessesingal) November 18, 2016 4/ Have simply made up that he saved a plant and American jobs.

      "text": "(AP Photo/Evan Vucci) “Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky – no Mexico” \n“I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!”\n— President-Elect Donald Trump, posts on Twitter, Nov. 17, 2016 \nOn Thursday evening, the president-elect tweeted that he “worked hard” with the chairman of the Ford Motor Company, who had called to inform him that the company would keep its plant in Kentucky.\nOne of Trump’s key campaign promises was to keep companies from outsourcing U.S. jobs overseas, and Trump took credit on Twitter for keeping the Lincoln plant from leaving Louisville, Ky. (As a businessman, Trump had a long history of outsourcing Trump brand products and has acknowledged doing so.)\nTweets have been widely shared on social media, and he’s clearly trying to claim credit for already having an impact on the U.S. economy, even before he officially takes the oath of office.\nJust got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky – no Mexico\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 18, 2016 \n\nI worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 18, 2016 \n\nIs Trump’s claim correct?\nThe Facts As our colleague Jim Tankersley wrote , Ford never announced plans to move either of its plants in Kentucky to Mexico. The Kentucky Truck Plant in Louisville produces the Lincoln Navigator, and the Louisville Assembly Plant produces the Lincoln MKC and the Ford Escape.\nFord had planned to move production of the Lincoln MKC to Mexico, likely to Ford’s Cuautitlan Stamping and Assembly Plant , per the contract Ford negotiated with the United Auto Workers in 2015, Ford spokeswoman Christin Baker said. Ford Fiesta models are currently produced at the Cuautitlan plant, which employs just over 2,000 people.\nFord had no plans to shutter the Louisville Assembly Plant, or to move production of the Ford Escape out of the plant. Ford committed to investing $700 million in the plant over four years, per its 2015 contract with the UAW, the Detroit Free Press reported .\nFord announced last year that it would move Lincoln MKC production to another factory to increase its Ford Escape production at the plant, the Detroit Free Press reported. (During a presidential debate, Trump complained about Ford moving its small car production to Mexico. Those plans have not changed, and Ford has said the expansion will not affect U.S. workers.)\nThe company had been reviewing where to make its Lincoln MKC model, and decided to keep production in Kentucky, Baker said. During their phone call on Thursday, Ford Chairman Bill Ford “shared our recent decision to keep Lincoln MKC in Kentucky,” she said.\nTrump claimed he “worked hard with Bill Ford,” and Baker said Trump played a role in the company’s decision to keep its Lincoln MKC model production at its plant in Kentucky. But Baker would not clarify what exactly Trump’s role was.\n“We are encouraged the economic policies he will pursue will help improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the U.S.,” Baker said.\nBaker said that “jobs at the plant will remain steady.” In other words, the decision makes no difference in terms of Ford jobs in the United States or Mexico.\nTrump’s staff did not respond to our request for clarification about his tweets or his role in Ford’s decision.\nThe Pinocchio Test Trump claimed that he had received a call from Ford Chairman Bill Ford, who had advised him that he “will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky – no Mexico.” He said he “worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky,” suggesting he was saving American jobs.\nBut Ford had never planned to move the Louisville Assembly Plant out of Kentucky to Mexico. In fact, the automaker committed to investing $700 million in the plant over four years. Instead, Ford had planned to move the production of a single model — the Lincoln MKC — to Mexico, so that it can increase production of another model at the plant. Ford decided not to move its Lincoln MKC production, and Trump apparently played some role in the company’s decision. But the impact on jobs is nil.\nTrump may be able to take some credit for Ford changing its mind on moving Lincoln MKC production out of its Louisville plant. But it’s incorrect to claim Ford is keeping the Louisville Assembly Plant in Kentucky rather than moving it to Mexico. Trump can’t take credit for stopping something that was never going to happen.\nThree Pinocchios \n\n\n( About our rating scale )\n\nSend us facts to check by filling out this form \nCheck out our guide to all Trump and Clinton fact checks \nSign up for The Fact Checker weekly newsletter",

Such an accomplishment would have burnished the anti-trade reputation of the future president.\nIt wasn’t the plant – which employs 4,700 people – that Ford was going to move, but the production of the Lincoln MKC, a sport utility vehicle.\nBut even if MKC production had moved south, zero American jobs would have suffered, according to the United Auto Workers union, which represents Ford workers, and last year negotiated with the Dearborn, Mich. automaker to invest $700 million in the Louisville plant over the next four years, reported the Detroit Free Press. Ford had planned to replace MKC production in Louisville with the Escape SUV.\nRecommended: Car logos quiz Still, the MKC is staying in Louisville; it’s unclear if that will impact production of the Escape there.\nTest your knowledge Car logos quiz “Today, we confirmed with the President-elect that our small Lincoln utility vehicle made at the Louisville Assembly Plant will stay in Kentucky,” the company said in a statement, according to The Washington Post. “We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve US competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States.”\nDespite the change in the MKC's plans, Ford has said that it plans to move all North American production of its smaller cars from the US to Mexico. There, cheap labor and the country’s extensive trade relationships (which make exporting from Mexico cheaper than from other parts of the world) have made it a hub of global manufacturing in the 22 years since the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) negotiated trade among the US, Canada, and Mexico. Ford’s US plants will continue to make the company's larger, more expensive cars, which are more cost-effective to make here.\nAnd while Mr. Trump has singled Ford out as a trade boogeyman , criticizing the company for moving US jobs to Mexico – where his own clothing line is made – all other automakers are doing the same. Over the next decade, almost every major automaker will be producing some cars in Mexico, including General Motors, Ford, Toyota, Honda, Volkswagen, Audi, BMW, Hyundai and Mazda, according to an analysis by the Free Press .\nThe wave of investment by 2015 had turned Mexico into the seventh-largest producer of cars in the world and the fourth-largest auto exporter after Germany, Japan, and South Korea. Employment in Mexico’s auto sector has shot up 40 percent over the past decade , as international companies have poured $7 billion into the country. The United States saw a 15 percent increase in the same period.\nTrump has promised to reverse these trends by renegotiating NAFTA and other trade deals in order to bring back American jobs. Some economists, however, are skeptical that this will meaningfully stimulate the economy. They blame automation , not trade deals, for the manufacturing job losses.\nManufacturing output in the US is actually at an all-time high, as the Monitor has reported, worth $2.2 trillion in 2015, up from $1.7 trillion in 2009. The jobs are becoming increasingly skilled , though, and companies complain that they have trouble finding qualified or interested US workers for positions that don’t require a college degree, but at least some formal training.\n“The gap is between the jobs that take no skills and those that require a lot of skill,” Rob Spohr, a business professor at Montcalm Community College near Grand Rapids, told the Monitor’s Simon Montlake in June. “There’s enough people to fill the jobs at McDonalds and other places where you don’t need to have much skill. It’s that gap in between, and that’s where the problem is.”\nAccording to the National Skills Coalition, a Washington-based career-training advocacy group, the need for workers in middle-skilled jobs in the US will remain one of the economy’s most pronounced in the near term. Indeed, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics data show a surplus of bachelor’s degrees in the workforce, while moderately skilled positions languish.\nSome labor experts and economists call on the federal government to expand funding for technical skills training to close the jobs gap. It is unclear yet whether Trump supports that idea.",

Operations headers, Irate Diesel Performance regulated-return–style fuel system, 3.5-inch leveling kit, and 22x12.25 milled Alcoa super-single wheels with 325/50/22 Toyo A/T tires Owner says: “I bought this truck as a bone-stock dualie in May 2011. In February 2012, I was broadsided in the bed. The bed was destroyed and the Dana 80 rearend and the frame were bent. Over the next year and a half, I rebuilt the truck as a single-rear wheel with an ’08 interior. Since being back together, the truck has seen countless power setups. The current configuration makes just shy of 600 hp. This truck is my daily driver and spends more than half its life hooked to my 32-foot gooseneck trailer hauling farm equipment, steel, or one of my 750-plus-horsepower 7.3L-powered race trucks. My future plans are to install ’05 axles with full air-ride suspension, a little more fuel, and a BorgWarner S364.5/S480 compound-turbocharger setup. In the end, I would like a nearly smoke-free 700hp tow rig.” Photo 3/9 | Readers Rides Diesel Dodge Red Front Driver Side Old School Odometer: 110,000 miles Fuel Economy: 16 mpg city, 19 mpg highway Modifications: 5x0.12 injectors, 16 degrees of timing, Denny T Performance fuel pin, Diamond Eye Performance 4-inch exhaust, BD Diesel Performance 16cm2 turbo housing, custom cold-air intake, and seats out of a second-generation Dodge Ram Owner says: “I bought this truck with the idea of restoring it. After driving it for five years, I decided it was time to start. I painted parts of the engine, the outside, and the whole frame. The inside was completely gutted and redone. I have truly enjoyed this project. I drive it some on the weekends and love taking it to truck shows.” Photo 4/9 | Readers Rides Diesel Ford Front Driver Side Red Widow Engine: 6.7L Power Stroke V-8 Transmission: 6R140 Torqshift six-speed automatic Odometer: 35,000 miles Fuel Economy: 17 to 24 mpg Modifications: Confederate Diesel BorgWarner S366 Pro turbocharger with billet compressor wheel, dash-mounted H&S Motorsports Mini Maxx race tuner with Midwest Diesel and Auto tuning, AFE Power Stage 2 cold-air intake and 5-inch straight-piped exhaust with 6-inch powdercoated Ruby Red tip, Industrial Injection 33-percent-over-stock CP4 injection pump (after having two Bosch stock pumps grenade), PureFlow AirDog II-4G lift pump, Pro Comp ladder bars, Snyder Performance Engineering Full Lock Diff kit, Snow Performance MPG-Max water-methanol injection kit, color-matched emblems, and Recon Super Duty illuminated doorsills and side emblems Owner says: “I can’t say enough about my pride and joy. I am very impressed with how far it has come along from the time when it was stock, especially with being a single-pump, single-turbo setup. I am looking to either go for connecting rods or a built transmission and then some slightly bigger sticks…but as she sits, she is a tough one to stay out of that skinny pedal!” Photo 5/9 | Readers Rides Diesel Jeep Wrangler Front Passenger Side One-Ton Wrangler Engine: 3.9L Cummins 4BT I-4 Transmission: M5OD five-speed manual Odometer: 1,000 miles Fuel Economy: 25 mpg Modifications: Engine: 3,800-rpm governor spring, Holset HX35 turbocharger, custom exhaust manifold with external wastegate, front-mounted intercooler, custom-built intake plenum, custom-built three-link front suspension with coil springs, Dana 60 front axle, GM 14-bolt rear axle with disc brakes, rear traction bars, 37-inch tires, Smittybilt 9,500-pound winch, custom dash with Intellitronix digital gauges, and factory-replacement seats from Quadratec Owner says: “I built this Jeep over the course of two years. I built the chassis with “builder” parts from Ballistic Fabrication and was never let down with the quality of its parts. Off-the-shelf, bolt-on parts for this Jeep are few and far between, but that’s what made it fun. The project changed courses more than once, but I am very happy with the end result. I ended up with a fun Jeep that can be daily driven, as well as a fairly capable trail rig.” Photo 6/9 | Readers Rides Diesel Ram Front Driver Side Camper Haul Hometown: Delta, Vancouver B.C., Canada Engine: 6.7L Cummins I-6 Odometer: 8,000 miles Fuel Economy: 15 to 18 mpg Modifications: Zone Offroad Products 2-inch leveling kit, Lakesea Tyres Crocodile Off Road Exreme MT tires, Fuel Vector wheels, AirLift WirelessOne air suspension, Bushwacker fender flares, and Torklift International front and rear camper tie-downs Owner says: “It all started from a blank canvas.

Ever since then, I’ve been a Duramax guy. So I bought this truck, and it is a real head turner.

But about two weeks after I bought it, I found out the head gaskets were blown. With the help of a family friend, we did the head gaskets and studs. I’ve been slowly adding to it since then, and I hope to do a transmission build and either install a bigger turbocharger or compound turbos, as well as a 6-inch suspension lift.",

      "text": "11:14am November 18, 2016   \nOne of the issues that Donald Trump talked the most about on the trail was jobs. \nHow are we going to stop American companies from shipping manufacturing jobs to other countries? \nTrump said he was the guy who could make it happen. \nApparently, he has already gotten started… \nThat’s big time… \nLiberal outlets are bashing Trump of course and saying that the plant was never going to close . \nThey have been discredited and exposed so badly during this election cycle so it’s really impossible to take anything they say seriously. \nThe point here obviously is that Trump is committed to rebuilding manufacturing in this c0untry. \nHere’s more. \nFrom Townhall : \nThe company issued a statement about the decision. \n“Today, we confirmed with the President-elect that our small Lincoln utility vehicle made at the Louisville Assembly Plant will stay in Kentucky. We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the U.S,” the company’s statement read. \nAccording to the Washington Post, Ford was planning to move its production of the Lincoln MKC to Mexico, but was not planning on moving the factory. Some of its smaller cars will be moving from Michigan to Mexico, however, although the company said it won’t cost American jobs. \n“We continue to engage with President-elect Trump’s team—and the new Conress—as they shape the policy agenda for 2017. We have shared our commitment to continue investing in the U.S. and creating American jobs—building on the $12 billion we have invested in our U.S. plants and the nearly 28,000 U.S. jobs Ford has created in the past five years,” the statement read. “Ford continues to employ more American autoworkers and produce more American made vehicles than anyone.” \nThis is a positive development no matter how you look at it.

      "text": "TWEET Donald Trump repeatedly told his supporters on the campaign trail that if elected, he would strong-arm American companies to keep production and manufacturing jobs in the United States. \"We can stop them from leaving. We have to stop them from leaving,\" Trump said in the first presidential debate, saying he would slap an import tax on products manufactured by American companies that moved production overseas. On Thursday night, the president-elect implied via Twitter that he'd had his first victory in the war to keep jobs in America: Ford Motor Company would continue manufacturing cars in Kentucky instead of Mexico. \nJust got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky - no Mexico \nI worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me! Trump's tweet suggested that through hard work, he somehow convinced Ford to continue production of Lincoln cars in the U.S. But however Trump wants to spin this news, the reality is that Ford was never moving a \"plant in Kentucky\" to Mexico. Details matter In a statement to the Washington Post , Ford said that it did plan to shift production of the Lincoln MKC — one model — from Louisville, Kentucky, to Mexico. But the company informed Trump production of the MKC would remain in Louisville. CNN reported that production of the MKC in Louisville was relatively small. Annually, Ford produces 20,000 Lincoln MKCs and 306,000 Ford Escapes at its Louisville plant. Last year , Ford announced it planned to move MKC production out of Louisville, but increased Escape production was planned to offset the loss of the MKC, meaning there would be no jobs cuts. \nDespite Trump victory lap, Ford says it wasn't planning to move its assembly plant to Mexico https://t.co/xR259mnfYE The key word in this exchange: \"plant.\" Tweeting that Ford planned to keep relatively small production of one vehicle in Kentucky does not sound substantial. But saying Ford kept a plant in the U.S. suggests thousands of jobs were saved, and frames Trump as successful and honest to his campaign promises. His supporters immediately spread the false news on Twitter. \nFord and now Apple. Businesses are already talking about coming home and Trump isn't even sworn in yet. \nThank you to President-Elect Trump for working with FORD to keep its plant in Kentucky. Not even President &amp; he's getting things done! And then, this As the car manufacturer announced earlier this year, Ford still plans to move a good portion of its production to Mexico. But the shift away from Detroit will be balanced by a commitment to invest $9 billion in its American plants, Ford's CEO said , adding that \"zero\" jobs will be lost in the U.S. The statement was prompted by Trump's assertion in the first presidential debate that \"Ford is leaving; their small car division leaving. Thousands of jobs leaving Michigan, leaving Ohio.\" As New York magazine's Jesse Singal pointed out, Trump's statement contributes to a proliferation of fake news, especially when he is the one generating it. \n4/ Have simply made up that he saved a plant and American jobs. But he knows what he's doing -- there are now fake stories all over the \n5/place confirming that yes, the election of Trump saved a bunch of jobs. Kept American jobs American.

      "text": "\nThis article was written by Tyler Durden and originally published at Zero Hedge . \nEditor’s Comment: Though his administration is still taking shape, President-elect Trump may be able to claim his first tangible victory. Though Ford Motors were resistant to Trump’s trade policy positions and threatened to move jobs to Mexico, the CEO has now announced that, instead, production will remain American. \nIs Trump pulling televangelist-style miracles – with arrangements ahead of time in the back room – or is he making things happen because he is in a position to make good on his policy promises? Either way, Ford and other big companies will be keeping optics in mind when they decide whether or not to play ball with the wild card Trump administration (at this point, still to be). If this actually becomes the trend, perhaps there is a lot of positive that can be done for the economy, and perhaps good paying jobs can return for struggling working class Americans. Only time will tell, but he hasn’t even assumed office yet. \nFord CEO Folds? Trump Confirms Carmaker Won’t Move Production To Mexico \nby Tyler Durden\nJust hours after Ford CEO complained of the “huge impact” of Donald Trump’s proposed trade plans, following the company’s plan to move a substantial portion of its passenger-car production to Mexico from a factory in Michigan, Donald Trump tweeted “Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky — no Mexico,” seemingly winning his first ‘america-first’ victory.\nAs WSJ reported yesterday, Ford Motor Co. Chief Executive Mark Fields issued a warning about President-elect Donald Trump’s proposed trade policies, saying high tariffs on automobiles and other products coming into the U.S. would be a blow to the auto industry and broader U.S. economy.\nMr. Fields, speaking with reporters on the sidelines of the Los Angeles Auto Show on Tuesday, said Ford has talked to Mr. Trump’s transition team and believes the company can work with the new administration. During a separate interview, he said, “We all share the same objective; we want a vibrant and healthy U.S. economy.” \nThe two sides, however, appear to be at odds on how to achieve that goal.\nFord’s plan to move a substantial portion of its passenger-car production to Mexico from a factory in Michigan was heavily criticized by Mr. Trump on the campaign trail. Like many of its rivals, Ford is building more-profitable light trucks in the U.S. while investing in new capacity in Mexico to produce lower-margin small cars.\nAnd then hours later, Donald Trump tweeted…\nJust got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky – no Mexico\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 18, 2016 \n\nI worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 18, 2016 \n\nWhich was followed by a statement from Ford confirming Trump’s comment…\nThis article was written by Tyler Durden and originally published at Zero Hedge . \n",

      "text": "Just days after the New York Times promised to “rededicate” the paper to honest reporting, they’re up to their own tricks again. Just earlier today they ran a story headlined “Donald Trump Takes Credit for Helping to Save a Ford Plant That Wasn’t Closing” in Louisville, Kentucky. The catch? “Ford had not planned to close the Louisville factory. Instead, it had planned to expand production of another vehicle made in Louisville, the Ford Escape. And the change had not been expected to result in any job losses,” according to the Times.\nOh – and did we mention the Times is completely full of it? Yes, Trump technically oversold what happened when he said he stopped a plant from closing and moving to Mexico, but he did prevent some production from being set up in Mexico as opposed to domestically.\nAdvertisement - story continues below Related Stories Libs in Trump meltdown when Ford finally ADMITS... Oops! Here's yet another EMBARRASSING fact to torpedo Hillary's campaign... While Obama’s out touting his legacy, we just learned the AWFUL truth...\nAs Bloomberg reported yesterday: President-elect Donald Trump suggested on Twitter that he convinced Ford Motor Co. to keep production of a Lincoln sport utility vehicle in the U.S. instead of moving it to Mexico. And the automaker doesn’t dispute that .\nFord builds the Lincoln MKC small SUV at its Louisville Assembly Plant in Kentucky alongside the Ford Escape SUV. Ford had never said it was considering shifting MKC production south of the border. But the company confirmed Friday that it had been “likely” to move the work to Mexico in 2019 when its current contract with the United Auto Workers union expires .\n“ We had planned to move the Lincoln MKC out of Louisville Assembly Plant ,” probably to the Cuautitlan factory in Mexico, Christin Baker, a Ford spokeswoman, said in an e-mail.\nFord said in a statement “We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the U.S.”\nWhen the Times said they were going to commit themselves to honest journalism, we probably all said we’d believe it when we saw it. It looks like they couldn’t keep that promise for even a week.\n[Note: This post was written by The Analytical Economist]",

Story \nPresident-elect Donald Trump took to Twitter Thursday to claim credit for halting the kind of outsourcing of jobs he decried during his campaign. \n\"Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky - no Mexico,” he tweeted . \nTrump went on to say he \"worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky.\" \nBut Ford only changed its plans with respect to production of the slow-selling Lincoln MKC crossover SUV, not the plant itself. It had announced intentions to move the vehicle’s assembly elsewhere. But it was still going to keep assembly of the Ford escape at that Louisville factory. The plant was not slated for closure. \nAnd while the company is shifting some production to Mexico, where labor costs are lower, Ford has said it has no plans to shutter U.S. plants. Instead, domestic production of vehicles with higher profit margins continues. \n\"Right now there's no question that high-profit, high-margin products like SUVs and pickups are very well situated within in the U.S.,\" said Mike Jackson, head of North American light-vehicle forecasting at IHS Markit. \nThat nuance didn't prevent Trump from criticizing companies like Ford during his presidential campaign.

      "text": "November 18, 2016 12:42 PM Keeping a 1940 Ford coupe all in the family Jim and Vickie Delzer’s 1940 Ford DeLuxe Coupe has been restored to even better condition than it was in when Vickie rode in the car as an infant in the mid-1960s. The beautiful Lyon Blue coupe was treated to a complete body-off-frame, nut-and-bolt restoration over a period of more than seven years. Mike Berry The Wichita Eagle i Order Reprint of this Story \nFor Jim and Vickie Delzer, their stunning 1940 Ford DeLuxe Coupe is a link in a family tradition extending back more than a half century. \nSomeone had traded the coupe in on a new car at a dealership in Enid, Okla. in 1964. And that’s where Vickie’s parents found the car, which they bought to use as a daily driver. \n“Her parents used to put her up on the package tray behind the seat when she was little,” Jim Delzer noted. \n“My cousin and I both took our driving tests in that car,” added Vickie. \nBut at some point, the old Ford fell out of favor and was parked. Then along came Jim Delzer, who fell for Vickie. \n“When we first met, her mom told me, ‘That car has got to get out of my yard.’ But I really had no interest in the car. I was more interested in Mustangs at the time,” Delzer recalled. \nIn fact, he and his wife would eventually buy an early Mustang convertible from her mom and restore it. \nSo the ’40 coupe sat, unappreciated and unwanted. Until the Delzers spotted a ’40 Ford coupe that had been mildly street-rodded by some friends. \n“That’s when I decided we’d better get down to Oklahoma and bring that car up here. That was in the mid-’80s. We had it in storage a long time,” he said. When the couple started work on the car, they figured it would be a three-year project. By the time it was finished last year, it had been more than seven years. \n“It was a full body-off-frame restoration. I wanted to do it in depth. I wanted to keep the car as original as possible. It was in excellent condition when we got it, with very little rust.” \nThe odometer showed 73,000 original miles. \n“That’s the original engine that was in it,” added Vickie. “At car shows, when you open the hood, people are waiting to see what you have under there.” \nThere was never a temptation to replace the flathead V-8 with a later model small block V-8. \nThe coupe was stripped down to its bare essentials, with the flathead taken to Jerry Livingston at United Engine Specialists for minimal machine work, which included replacing one cylinder sleeve. A friend and fellow Mustang enthusiast, Harold Farrier, helped Delzer reassemble the engine, which got one significant upgrade. \n“I’m not a purist,” Delzer confessed. “But obviously you have to put duals on a flathead.” \nA Red’s Headers dual exhaust kit, including exhaust headers, pipes and a pair of “Smitty” mufflers took care of that part of the project. The resulting low-key rumble proves the point that nothing sounds quite like a flathead through duals. \n“We do get a lot of comments from people who say, `I love it that you left it original and left the flathead in it.’” Delzer said. \nAnother buddy, Butch Dysart, handled what little body work was needed, including patching a rusty spot in the trunk floor, before prepping the coupe’s body for paint. \n“The color is called Lyon Blue. Most (’40 Fords) are either black or that nice maroon color,” Delzer said, noting that the deep blue hue is, however, a factory Ford color. \nHe chose to use a single stage R-M formula, rather than going the modern basecoat-clearcoat route, again for maximum authenticity. \nDysart and Zach Noel teamed up to spray the car. Then it was Delzer’s turn to learn a new skill, as it was up to him to color-sand the entire vehicle. \nInside, Vickie wasn’t sure she wanted to go with a stock mohair interior, remembering her itchy days as a child riding in the car. \n“But the only other option involved three different colors of material and that would have clashed with the dash,” she said. \nSo they ordered a Cartouche mohair interior kit and installed it themselves. \n“We didn’t have as much problem as we did with the vinyl kits we did in the Mustangs we restored,” she said. \nThey also took on the daunting task of woodgraining the metal windshield and window moldings, applying a maroon paint and then carefully applying black ink with a special tool to replicate the grain. \nThe interior features Ford’s first column-shift three-speed manual transmission, along with a two-tone dashboard. A horizontal speedometer is set in a cream-colored panel, along with individual gauges. \nThe decision was made to keep the old lever-action shock absorbers, instead of replacing them with modern tubular shocks. For rolling stock, Delzer did go with larger steel wheels and a set of BF Goodrich Silvertown radial wide whitewall tires, P235/75/15’s in back and smaller P205/75/15’s up front. \n“I wanted a little bit of a rake to the stance,” he explained. \n“We don’t drive it a lot. It’s definitely not a daily driver,” Jim Delzer said. “I was really surprised for 85 horsepower how much power it has. Sixty-five is as fast as I’ve taken it and I still had throttle left. It really goes down the road nice.” \nThe Delzers do enjoy sharing their car with others at area car shows. \n“At shows, it’s nice to see grandparents talking to their grandkids about these old cars,” said Vickie Delzer, who can tell a few tales of her own about their old family Ford. \nMike Berry:",

      "text": "DETROIT -- Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford told President-elect Donald Trump on Thursday the automaker no longer plans to move production of its Lincoln MKC from Louisville, Ky., to Mexico.\nFord currently makes both the MKC and the Ford Escape, a compact SUV, in Louisville. Ford said last year it planned to move MKC production to another plant so it could increase production of the Escape. The automaker said at the time no jobs would be lost in Louisville because of plans to boost Escape production.\nThe Detroit-area automaker also made a commitment in its 2015 contract with the United Auto Workers union to invest $700 million in the Louisville plant over four years.\nTrump took credit for causing Ford to change its plans in two tweets Thursday night.\nFord spokeswoman Christin Baker did not say why the automaker changed its plans for the Lincoln SUV. She did, however, confirm that Bill Ford spoke with Trump.\n\"Bill shared Ford's continued commitment to invest in the U.S.,\" Ford said in a statement. \"We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States.\"\nFord employs about 4,700 people at its plant in Louisville. The vast majority of the vehicles built at the plant are Escape SUVs. It also has a separate truck plant in Louisville, where it builds pickups and larger SUVs.\nTrump has repeatedly criticized Ford over the past 18 months for its plans to move the production of its Ford Focus and Ford C-Max hybrids to Mexico even though nearly all other automakers have also built new plants or have been expanding their presence there in recent years.\nTrump also has promised to bring manufacturing jobs back to the U.S., has said he wants the U.S. to withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement and has talked about imposing a 35 percent tariff on cars made in Mexico as well as other products.\n\"A tariff like that would be imposed on the entire auto sector, and that could have a huge impact on the U.S. economy,\" Ford CEO Mark Fields said Tuesday at the Los Angeles Auto Show.\nFields also said the automaker sent Trump a congratulatory letter after he won the election.\nSeveral other top-ranking executives at the Los Angeles Auto Show declined to comment directly on Trump's comments about NAFTA or the tariff. Instead, most automotive executives say it's too early to comment on Trump's remarks on the campaign trail because he hasn't formally proposed anything yet.\n\"Well, obviously, we are in a transition at the moment. I think it's important with all of the speculation that's out there just to see once the transition is finished, what the environment looks like,\" Mike Manley, head the Ram and Jeep brands for Fiat Chrysler Automobiles said Wednesday. \"Like every other automaker, we are in contact with the administration, we welcome that contact, we are looking forward to that continuing and will see what happens.\"\nFord, on Friday, emphasized that it has created 28,000 new jobs and has invested $12 billion in the U.S. over the past five years.\n\"We continue to engage with President-elect Trump's team -- and the new Congress -- as they shape the policy agenda for 2017. We have shared our commitment to continue investing in the U.S. and creating American jobs,\" Ford said in a statement.\n(c)2016 Detroit Free Press\nVisit the Detroit Free Press at www.freep.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\nShare Comment",

      "title": "Trump: 'I Worked Hard' To Keep Ford Plant in Kentucky",
      "text": "Share Tweet \nDonald Trump tweeted on Thursday that the chairman of Ford motors told him the company will not be moving the production of one of their vehicles to Mexico, seeming to suggest he played a role in that decision. \n“Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford … who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky,” Trump tweeted. “[N]o Mexico.” \n“I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!” \nThe company issued a statement about the decision. \n“Today, we confirmed with the President-elect that our small Lincoln utility vehicle made at the Louisville Assembly Plant will stay in Kentucky. We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the U.S,\" the company’s statement read. \nAccording to the Washington Post, Ford was planning to move its production of the Lincoln MKC to Mexico, but was not planning on moving the factory. Some of its smaller cars will be moving from Michigan to Mexico, however, although the company said it won’t cost American jobs. \n“We continue to engage with President-elect Trump’s team—and the new Conress—as they shape the policy agenda for 2017. We have shared our commitment to continue investing in the U.S. and creating American jobs—building on the $12 billion we have invested in our U.S. plants and the nearly 28,000 U.S. jobs Ford has created in the past five years,” the statement read. “Ford continues to employ more American autoworkers and produce more American made vehicles than anyone.”",

      "text": "More Ford confirmed Friday that it will keep production of one SUV model in Kentucky, rather than relocating as planned, a decision US President-elect Donald Trump claimed as a personal victory. \"Just hung up on the phone with my friend Bill Ford, the chairman of Ford's board, who let me know he was going to keep the Lincoln site in Kentucky - No Mexico,\" Trump wrote on Twitter Thursday night. Trump's declaration was met with some derision since Ford had not publicly announced plans to move the Lincoln MKC production. And just this week Ford confirmed it will proceed with plans to move production of the Focus to Mexico from Michigan, a state Trump narrowly won in last week's election. But under the last year's contract agreement with the powerful United Automobile Workers union, Ford had made plans to move the smaller Lincoln MKC production line to make room for the Escape. Ford's Louisville plant produces the Lincoln MKC as well as the Ford Escape, both small SUVs. \"Cuautilan plant in Mexico was likely the plant for MKC,\" Ford spokesman Christine Baker, told AFP in an email Friday. Ford already produces the Lincoln MKZ sedan on the Hermosillo site, and in early April announced a $1.6 billion investment in a new site in Mexico. But, the company said in a statement, \"Today, we confirmed with the President-elect that our small Lincoln utility vehicle made at the Louisville Assembly Plant will stay in Kentucky.\" One of the main themes of Trump's campaign was to bring back manufacturing jobs that American companies had moved overseas in search of cheap labor. Ford and the IT giant Apple (NasdaqGS: AAPL - news ) were his favorite targets. Trump even threatened to impose a 35 percent punitive import duty on cars produced in Mexico, and to renegotiate the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). His rhetoric seems to have worked since several states where the car industry is strongly represented and that traditionally voted Democratic, such as Michigan and Wisconsin, voted for Trump, tipping the election. Ford said of the decision, \"We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve US competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States.\" But the company defended its record, saying it employs more American auto workers and produces more American-made vehicles than any other company, and has invested $12 billion US plants in the past five years and created nearly 28,000 US jobs. \"We continue to engage with President-elect Trump's team -? and the new Congress -? as they shape the policy agenda for 2017. We have shared our commitment to continue investing in the US and creating American jobs,\" Ford said. Reblog",

      "title": "Ford on Trump tweet: We'll keep Lincoln MKC in Kentucky",
      "text": "DETROIT -- Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford told President-elect Donald Trump on Thursday the automaker no longer plans to move production of its Lincoln MKC from Louisville, Ky., to Mexico.\nFord currently makes both the MKC and the Ford Escape, a compact SUV, in Louisville. Ford said last year it planned to move MKC production to another plant so it could increase production of the Escape. The automaker said at the time no jobs would be lost in Louisville because of plans to boost Escape production.\nThe Detroit-area automaker also made a commitment in its 2015 contract with the United Auto Workers union to invest $700 million in the Louisville plant over four years.\nTrump took credit for causing Ford to change its plans in two tweets Thursday night.\nFord spokeswoman Christin Baker did not say why the automaker changed its plans for the Lincoln SUV. She did, however, confirm that Bill Ford spoke with Trump.\n\"Bill shared Ford's continued commitment to invest in the U.S.,\" Ford said in a statement. \"We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States.\"\nFord employs about 4,700 people at its plant in Louisville. The vast majority of the vehicles built at the plant are Escape SUVs. It also has a separate truck plant in Louisville, where it builds pickups and larger SUVs.\nTrump has repeatedly criticized Ford over the past 18 months for its plans to move the production of its Ford Focus and Ford C-Max hybrids to Mexico even though nearly all other automakers have also built new plants or have been expanding their presence there in recent years.\nTrump also has promised to bring manufacturing jobs back to the U.S., has said he wants the U.S. to withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement and has talked about imposing a 35 percent tariff on cars made in Mexico as well as other products.\n\"A tariff like that would be imposed on the entire auto sector, and that could have a huge impact on the U.S. economy,\" Ford CEO Mark Fields said Tuesday at the Los Angeles Auto Show.\nFields also said the automaker sent Trump a congratulatory letter after he won the election.\nSeveral other top-ranking executives at the Los Angeles Auto Show declined to comment directly on Trump's comments about NAFTA or the tariff. Instead, most automotive executives say it's too early to comment on Trump's remarks on the campaign trail because he hasn't formally proposed anything yet.\n\"Well, obviously, we are in a transition at the moment. I think it's important with all of the speculation that's out there just to see once the transition is finished, what the environment looks like,\" Mike Manley, head the Ram and Jeep brands for Fiat Chrysler Automobiles said Wednesday. \"Like every other automaker, we are in contact with the administration, we welcome that contact, we are looking forward to that continuing and will see what happens.\"\nFord, on Friday, emphasized that it has created 28,000 new jobs and has invested $12 billion in the U.S. over the past five years.\n\"We continue to engage with President-elect Trump's team -- and the new Congress -- as they shape the policy agenda for 2017. We have shared our commitment to continue investing in the U.S. and creating American jobs,\" Ford said in a statement.\n(c)2016 Detroit Free Press\nVisit the Detroit Free Press at www.freep.com\n ",

It will be designed and built around the existing museum, which includes the Motown studio with its \"Hitsville U.S.A.\" facade. \nDesigners and architects are collaborating on details of the expanded space. \nThe museum is located in the house where record company founder Berry Gordy launched his cultural and commercial music empire. The label started in 1959 and scores of stars and hits were created before Motown moved to California in 1972. Related content",

      "text": "Louisville Assembly Plant employees work to assemble the new 2013 Ford Escape on the production line in 2012. Photo by REUTERS/John Sommers II/File Photo\nDETROIT — President-elect Donald Trump claimed Thursday that he convinced the chairman of Ford Motor Co. not to move an assembly plant from Kentucky to Mexico. But Ford never intended to move the plant, just production of one of the vehicles it makes.\nJust got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky – no Mexico\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 18, 2016 \n\nI worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 18, 2016 \n\nTrump said in a tweet that Bill Ford, the company’s executive chairman, telephoned him with the news that a “Lincoln plant” would stay in Louisville. Instead Ford decided to keep production of the Lincoln MKC small SUV at the Louisville Assembly Plant. Ford had previously said it would move production of the MKC out of the plant in order to build more Ford Escapes there.\nA factory in Cuautitlan, Mexico, was likely to get the MKC. Under a contract negotiated last year with the United Auto Workers, Ford agreed to invest $700 million in the Louisville plant in return for moving production of the MKC. Because Escape production would increase, no Louisville jobs would be lost.\nIt’s possible the decision to keep the MKC in Kentucky was made before the election, because Escape sales have been falling since July and additional production capacity in Louisville may not be needed.\nOn Friday, Ford would say only that the MKC decision was “recent,” but spokeswoman Christin Baker wouldn’t say exactly when it was made or whether Trump directly influenced it.\nThe MKC and Escape are essentially the same vehicle and are now built by the same workers on the same assembly line. But while Ford has sold over 258,000 Escapes so far this year, it’s only sold about 21,000 MKCs. So, moving the MKC would have had little impact on the factory even if Escape production was not increased.\nStill, Trump claimed credit for saving a factory from moving to Mexico. “I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!” Trump said in one of two tweets on the subject. His initial tweet said: “Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky – no Mexico.”\nFord Motor Co. and Trump have engaged in a yearlong feud over the automaker’s plans to move production south of the border. The company plans to shift small-car production from suburban Detroit to Mexico to improve profitability of the lower-priced cars. CEO Mark Fields said Tuesday that the presidential election didn’t change the company’s plan.\nTrump wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and has called for a 35 percent tariff on goods shipped from Mexico in an effort to preserve U.S. manufacturing jobs.\nFord plans to move production of the Focus and C-Max small cars to Mexico from a plant in Wayne, Michigan. But jobs at the Wayne plant would be preserved because it’s getting a new SUV and small pickup truck.\n“We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States,” Baker said in an email.\n  auto industry ford kentucky manufacturing PREVIOUS POST Obama blocks new oil, gas drilling in Arctic Ocean Are  ",

      "text": "Ford Move, Cited as Victory by Trump, Has No Effect on U.S. Jobs By NEAL E. BOUDETTE Continue reading the main story Although President-elect Donald J. Trump claimed on Thursday night a hard-won victory to persuade Ford Motor to keep making a small Lincoln sport utility vehicle in a Louisville, Ky., plant rather than move its production to Mexico, Ford’s decision to maintain production in Kentucky will have no impact on jobs at the factory. The plant is already operating virtually around the clock at full capacity. The decision, which Ford Motor said it made before Mr. Trump spoke by phone on Thursday with William Clay Ford Jr., the company’s executive chairman, will simply keep the current product mix in place at the factory. The Louisville plant will continue making a far larger number of Ford Escapes, a small S.U.V. that is essentially the same, if less luxurious, vehicle as the Lincoln MKC, which Ford said it would continue to make in Louisville. Ford, which during the election campaign was a frequent target of Mr. Trump’s criticism for moving jobs to Mexico, was no doubt waving a political olive branch by deciding to keep Lincoln MKC production in Kentucky. But the move was largely symbolic. And that Mr. Trump seemingly overstated its impact — if it proves emblematic of his future dealings with the industry — could indicate that his rhetoric about saving and restoring auto jobs may not necessarily require significant changes on the part of carmakers. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Trump’s vows to protect manufacturing jobs in the United States helped him win the support of working-class voters, including many factory workers in Michigan, Ohio and Kentucky. He sought to underscore the message Thursday night. “Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky - no Mexico,” Mr. Trump wrote in a Twitter message. Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky - no Mexico — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) Nov. 18, 2016 In a subsequent post, he wrote: “I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!” I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) Nov. 18, 2016 Both posts overstated certain issues. Ford never planned to move the Louisville plant to Mexico. It only intended to shift the production of the MKC, which represents less than 10 percent of the plant’s total output. The MKC is a more expensive version of the Ford Escape , which is a much bigger seller than the MKC and alone is enough to keep the Louisville plant running at full capacity. Moreover, the decision to keep the MKC in Louisville was made before the two men spoke on Thursday, not as a result of their conversation, according to Ford. “We have been reviewing the sourcing of this product, and Bill Ford spoke to the President-elect yesterday and shared our recent decision to keep Lincoln MKC in Kentucky,” a Ford spokeswoman, Christin Baker, said in a statement on Friday. “We are encouraged the economic policies he will pursue will help improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the U.S.” Ford’s chief financial officer, Robert L. Shanks, held a conference call with analysts on Thursday morning in which he expressed hope that Mr. Trump’s policies would ‘‘provide an environment where it makes economic sense to build back up manufacturing jobs here.’’ But how Mr. Trump governs may be “a bit different” from his campaign rhetoric, Mr. Shanks said. “So let’s just wait and see.’’ \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story During the campaign, Mr. Trump heavily criticized Ford for deciding to shuffle its manufacturing operations so that all its small cars are made in Mexico. At times, he even suggested hitting the company and others with a 35 percent tariff on vehicles imported from Mexico. Ford has countered that moving small-car assembly to Mexican plants would have no impact on American jobs. For example, a factory in Wayne, Mich., that now makes the weakly selling Ford Focus compact will be retooled to make trucks and S.U.V.s, which are selling briskly. Ford says the higher profit margins on trucks and S.U.V.s allow the company to absorb the higher labor costs of building the vehicles in the United States. The Wayne plant is expected to remain fully staffed with 3,700 workers. In October, speaking to reporters at an auto technology conference, Mr. Ford voiced frustration with the harsh criticism Mr. Trump was then aiming at the company. “Look, we are everything he should be celebrating about this country,’’ Mr. Ford said, noting that the company makes more cars and trucks in United States plants than any of its rivals and is investing in its American operations and adding jobs. “He knows all that,” Mr. Ford said of Mr. Trump at the time. “I can’t control what he says.” This week, Ford’s chief executive, Mark Fields, spoke at the Los Angeles Auto Show and reiterated the company’s commitment to shift assembly of small cars like the Focus to Mexico. The decision on the MKC gave Mr. Ford some good news to pass on to Mr. Trump. The Louisville plant’s work force would remain unchanged even if the MKC were moved to a new factory. The factory employs 4,500 hourly workers and is operating on three shifts, producing vehicles, mostly Ford Escapes, almost around the clock. In the first 10 months of this year, the plant made nearly 300,00 Ford Escapes and just over 37,000 Lincoln MKCs. \nAdvertisement",

      "text": "DETROIT - Ford Motor Co. and UAW-Ford are investing $6 million in the $50 million expansion of the Motown Museum in Detroit.\nThe investment by the automaker and its collaboration with United Auto Workers members will fund a state-of-the-art performance centre and other programming.\nMuseum officials have said the expansion will create space for interactive exhibits at the Detroit tourist attraction. It will be designed and built around the existing museum, which includes the Motown studio with its \"Hitsville U.S.A.\" facade.\nDesigners and architects are collaborating on details of the expanded space.\nThe museum is located in the house where record company founder Berry Gordy launched his cultural and commercial music empire. The label started in 1959 and scores of stars and hits were created before Motown moved to California in 1972.\nReport Error Submit a Tip Refund Refund",
