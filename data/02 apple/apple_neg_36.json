      "text": "Reddit \nA Wells Fargo analyst has noted that Apple has ceased to disclose its advertising spend in its latest 10-K annual report , instead bundling it into a more general category of ‘selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses.’ Apple has in the past always specifically disclosed its ad spend, notes Business Insider . \nApple last year increased its ad spend by a massive 50% to a record $1.8B. While the 10-K suggests that this year’s spend is lower by one measure, Wells Fargo suggests that might not be telling the whole story … While SG&A expenses were down year-on-year on a dollar basis, S&GA expenses as a percentage of overall sales were up one percentage point to 7%. Wells Fargo’s analysts also point out that Apple ended 2016 with its lowest operating margin since 2009, which could be in part due to Apple seeing less leverage — or in other words, spending more ad dollars to drive total revenue. \nPut another way, Wells Fargo thinks Apple doesn’t want people to see that it’s having to work harder to maintain sales. \nThe research note is speculative, so there may be other explanations, but it does seem to be a logical one. Apple had not responded to request for comment at the time of writing. Guides",

      "title": "This is Apple’s special tool to help customers recover data from the MacBook Pro’s non-removable SSD",
      "text": "Reddit When the first teardown of Apple’s new 2016 MacBook Pro was published earlier this month, a couple notable changes were spotted related to the machine’s SSD. Components for the SSD are now soldered onto the logic board, which likely allows for some design and thinness enhancements, but hurts overall repairability. On top of not being upgradeable , some speculated that meant that if the logic board fails, your data is gone with it. Not necessarily… Also present is a new mystery connector on the logic board that repair guide site iFixit noted in its teardown wasn’t connected to anything. It turns out that the mystery connector is actually there BECAUSE of the soldered down SSD, giving Apple a way to access data on a dead MacBook Pro. Apple stores have a special tool to assist, and they will be offering any 2016 MacBook Pro customers still under warranty attempted data transfer in the event the device doesn’t boot, according to sources familiar with Apple’s repair process. Apple’s new customer data migration tool is specifically designed for the new 2016 MacBook Pro and includes a logic board holder with power adapter that allows repair staff to insert your logic board and connect it via USB-C to a MacBook Pro. That’s what the “connector to nowhere” is for, and below is a photo of the new migration tool in action with a logic board inserted in the holder ready to transfer data: Apple never guarantees that it will be able to recover your data, but it recognizes that having a non-removable SSD makes things more difficult for users, so it’s providing Apple stores and service providers with this tool to help customers. Apple will attempt to transfer your data for any logic board, SSD, Touch ID, or wireless card failures, because all of those components are attached to the main logic board on the new MacBook Pros. Apple will provide that service to anyone still covered under their one year hardware warranty or AppleCare. This solution means Apple can transfer over data from a dead machine during a repair or personal setup appointment in the event the customer needs a new device. So there is still the downside of not being able to upgrade the new SSDs, but at least you know Apple has a solution to help you recover your lost data in the event your MacBook Pro dies. As a side note, since Touch ID is also attached to the logic board, Apple will have to replace both together if one or the other fails.",

      "text": "Apple’s Black Friday Deal Goes Live in Australia and New Zealand; Offers Up to $200 Gift Cards on Older Products Posted by Rajesh Pandey   Apple’s Black Friday deals have gone live in Australia and New Zealand, and they are not particularly impressive. Instead of giving discounts on its products, the company is bundling gift cards on purchase of iPhome and Mac. Even worse, Apple is only bundling gift cards on purchase of its older products. This means that you are not eligible for a gift card if you buy an iPhone 7 or an Apple Watch 2. If you buy an older product like the Apple Watch Series 1 or the Apple TV, you’ll get a $25 ($AUS35) gift card. And if you buy a Mac, you’ll be entitled to receive a $150 ($AUS 200) gift card. With the iPad Air or an iPad Pro, Apple is bundling a $100 ($AUS140) gift card. The maximum gift card that Apple is offering is $150 ($AUS 200) that you’ll get when you purchase a Mac. This includes the 12-inch MacBook and older Macs like Mac Pro. The 2016 edition non-Touch Bar MacBook is also eligible for this discount, but its Touch Bar siblings are not. Product iMac, Mac Pro, MacBook, MacBook Pro $AUS200",

      "text": "Reuters/Issei Kato \nBad news for people with iPhones: Apple's messenger service, iMessage, has been targeted by spammers. \nYou may have already received one of these annoying messages. It's an unfortunate side effect of any big social network. \nBut the good news is that iMessage spam isn't really that dangerous, if you know what it is and what you can do about it. What does iMessage spam look like? \nHere's a spam message I've received: \nScreenshot/iMessage \nObviously, there are not really deals on Michael Kors products at that URL. \nHere are some other examples: \niMessage spam. — Greg Koenig (@gak_pdx) November 20, 2016 \n— Jason Toews (@ToewsJa) September 15, 2016 What should I do about it? \nIt should go without saying that if someone you don't know is messaging you, offering discount designer brands, you absolutely should not give them any personal information. \nApple also won't iMessage you to change your password. So don't fall for that, either. \nThe easiest thing you can do is to filter iMessages from people who aren't saved in your contacts. Go to Settings > Messages > turn on Filter Unknown Sender . \nApple \nApple \nTo block a specific sender, open the spam message. Tap Details > Info > Block this Caller , then confirm with Block Contact . \nTo report the spammer, you'll see a blue Report Junk option underneath the spam message. Tap it and select Delete and Report Junk . Otherwise, you can send an email to with a screenshot of the spam, and the phone number that sent it. What if I am sending out the spam? \nThis is the bigger problem. If your iMessage conversations look like this: \nMy iMessage was hijacked - looks like these were test messages in prep for sending out spam. +86 is China. pic.twitter.com/i4IflwCnVI — Dave Lee (@DaveLeeBBC) September 19, 2016 \nOr this: \nYou'll need to take action. First, change your Apple ID password — your attacker could have it. Second, turn on two-factor authentication . \nThat should take care of your iMessage spam problem. \nHaving a particularly hard time with iMessage spam or have another iPhone problem?

      "title": "MacBook Pro (Touch Bar) vs. Microsoft Surface Book",
      "text": "Last month, Apple and Microsoft announced upgrades to its MacBook Pro and Surface Book hybrid respectively.\n\nApple’s key innovation was a Touch Bar , replacing the row of function keys on the keyboard. The Touch Bar has received mixed reviews. Some say it brings the “iPhone to the MacBook” in ease of use, some others see it as a gimmick and some oldtimers sorely miss the function keys.\nMicrosoft’s Surface Book had no visible changes – only a minor reduction in the gap when the hybrid tablet is attached to the keyboard. But in its higher-end models, Microsoft packed the Nvidia GeForce GTX 965M graphics card with 2GB of GDDR5 memory, compared with the Radeon Pro 460 with 4GB memory in the top-of-the-line MacBook Pro.\nThe MacBook Pro and Surface Book began shipping early this month and head-to-head comparisons have emerged. The verdict: MacBook Pro wins on speed, while the Surface Book is a runaway winner in gaming.\nThe verdict on Surface Book’s graphics is not surprising. PC World was among the early ones to hail it. Last month, just as the hybrid was launched, executive editor Gordon Mah wrote: “Microsoft claims its new Surface Book is ‘twice’ as fast as its equivalent MacBook Pro. Well, we ran some benchmarks, and hate to say it, but Microsoft lied. The Surface Book isn’t twice as fast. It’s three times as fast.”\nRunning the game Tomb Raider , PC World found the MacBook Pro running at a “pathetic sub-24 fps,” while the Surface Book recorded 74 fps.\nNow it seems to be acknowledged by everybody else. Even Gizmodo , which still reckons the Surface Book is “ridiculously overpriced,” concedes: “The Surface Book rendered frames (on the new game Civilization VI) at a speedy 59.4ms, while the MacBook Pro took nearly twice as long, averaging 98.8ms between frames.”\nIn overall speed, the MacBook Pro still scores with 3.3GHz dual-core Intel Core i7 in its priciest model versus an Intel Core i7 with Performance Base in the best Surface Book.\nIn PC World’s adapted tests – Cinebench R15 and Geek Bench 3 – the MacBook Pro was found to be running on consistently higher clock speeds, and a comfortable winner over the Surface Book.\nGizmodo tested the two devices on Adobe Photoshop, “the number one software choice for artists and photographers,” and on a web benchmark, and found MacBook Pro nosing ahead in both.\n“We batch processed two dozen RAW image files, cropping and resizing them. The MacBook Pro’s quad-core Core i7-6700HQ Skylake processor scorches compared to the dual-core Core i7-6600U Skylake processor in the Surface Book. It accomplished the batch process in just 49 seconds. The Surface Book took 66 seconds to do the same.” \nOn the WebXPRT benchmark – which tests the “ability to render images, process big chunks of numbers and even analyse DNA sequences” – the MacBook Pro scored a speedy 449, compared to Surface Book’s 395.\nSurface Book i7 prices start at $2,399 for the lowest-end configuration (256GB SSD, 8GB RAM). The highest-priced model (1TB, 16GB RAM) costs $3,299.\nThe MacBook Pro 13” with Touch Bar starts at $1,799. The 15” models start at $2,399.\nThe post MacBook Pro (Touch Bar) vs. Microsoft Surface Book appeared first on ValueWalk .\n",

      "title": "Donald Trump’s Latest Pipe Dream: Bring Apple’s Manufacturing to the US",
      "text": "| Analysis \nDonald Trump thinks it’s time for Apple to start manufacturing its products in the United States, and told CEO Tim Cook as much. Mr. Trump said Mr. Cook called him, and that he wants to give companies like Apple big tax breaks and remove industry regulations to get new factories in the country. That’s a pretty big dream considering the U.S. hasn’t ever had the production capacity to meet Apple’s needs. Donald Trump to Tim Cook: Make Apple factories in the U.S. \nIn an New York Times interview, Mr. Trump—the President Elect of the United States—said he got phone calls from both Tim Cook and Bill Gates earlier this week. Apple, Microsoft, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation chose not to comment on whether or not the calls took place, or who may have initiated them if they did. \nMr. Trump told the New York Times , \nI was honored yesterday, I got a call from Bill Gates, great call, we had a great conversation, I got a call from Tim Cook at Apple, and I said, ‘Tim, you know one of the things that will be a real achievement for me is when I get Apple to build a big plant in the United States, or many big plants in the United States, where instead of going to China, and going to Vietnam, and going to the places that you go to, you’re making your product right here.’ He said, ‘I understand that.’ \nHe went on to say his administration would use tax breaks to get Apple’s manufacturing in the United States. Mr. Trump told reporters he said, “I think we’ll create the incentives for you, and I think you’re going to do it. We’re going for a very large tax cut for corporations, which you’ll be happy about.” \nIt’s hard to see big tax breaks for corporations sitting well with Congress considering the sentiment that companies are gaming the system to avoid paying their fair share. Giving companies a way to pay even lower taxes ultimately translates into less money for the government—something law makers have been trying to stop, at least under President Obama’s administration. Trump Wants Apple Factories \nGetting companies to bring their manufacturing into the U.S. will take more than tax breaks in Mr. Trump’s estimation. He says Apple and other corporations shouldn’t be shackled by industry regulations. \n“But we’re going for big tax cuts, we have to get rid of regulations, regulations are making it impossible. Whether you’re liberal or conservative, I mean I could sit down and show you regulations that anybody would agree are ridiculous,” he said. “It’s gotten to be a free-for-all. And companies can’t, they can’t even start up, they can’t expand, they’re choking.” \nIn other words, what we need to bring big-time manufacturing into the U.S. are massive tax cuts for corporations and greatly scaled back industry regulations. That doesn’t, however, take into account that the U.S. doesn’t have—and never has had—the infrastructure to produce on the same scale as China. \nFoxconn’s Chinese factories where iPhones, iPads, and a long list of other devices from Apple and its competitors are made employ thousands of workers. The infrastructure to support the work force needed to build iPhones on the scale Apple needs requires what amounts to a city of workers, and that’s what Foxconn built. Its factories are essentially towns with living quarters, places to eat, activities, and other services a community needs. \nThe thousands of workers Foxconn employs to manufacture the electronic devices we want simply aren’t available in the U.S., and the days of company towns are long gone. This isn’t a matter of bringing jobs back to the country; it’s about creating a manufacturing system that never existed here. Tax cuts and industry deregulation won’t change that. \nApple already manufactures some of its products in the States, albiet on a small scale. It’s possible we could see more Apple production in the U.S., but don’t count on seeing Foxconn’s factories in China close down so all iPhones can be made here, no matter what Mr. Trump wants.

(Photo : Getty Images/Spencer Platt ) Advertisement \nRecently, President Elect Donald Trump said in an interview that he had a talk with Apple CEO, Tim Cook and he said to get Apple to build its product in the US rather than outside and offered him incentives. \nIt is given in the full transcript of the interview by New York Times , Trump said that \"I got a call from Tim Cook at Apple, and I said, 'Tim, you know one of the things that will be a real achievement for me is when I get Apple to build a big plant in the United States, or many big plants in the United States, where instead of going to China, and going to Vietnam, and going to the places that you go to, you're making your product right here.' He said, 'I understand that.' I said: 'I think we'll create the incentives for you, and I think you're going to do it. We're going for a very large tax cut for corporations, which you'll be happy about.' \" \nCook has said before that Apple makes its products in China because they have manufacturing skill and expertise in this field. Which indicates that he do not agree with Trump at this point. \nTrump has been critical of Apple's use of Chinese manufacturing for years, and it became a talking point of his while on the campaign trail. In January, he said that \"we're gonna get Apple to start building their damn computers and things in this country, instead of in other countries.\" He made similar comments in March, also calling out iPhone production. As written in The Verge . \nApple CEO Tim Cook was supporting Hillary Clinton and he hosted a fundraiser for the Democratic candidate. Convincing Apple to move its manufacturing in the US will not be easy and Trump has to put a lot of efforts for it. Apple is a huge company and if it moves back to the US, there will be many job opportunities as there are approximately 116k employees who work in Apple currently and there are half million jobs directly and indirectly. © 2016 Enstarz, All rights reserved.

      "text": "apple iphone us manufacturing More Apple\nRestoring thousands of manufacturing jobs to the United States’ struggling Rust Belt communities was one of President-Elect Donald Trump’s biggest campaign promises, and at least one major technology company is considering following through. According to The New York Times and Nikkei Asian Review , iPhone maker Apple has begun exploring the possibility of moving smartphone production to the United States.\nMore: Apple scales back production of iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, expects lower sales in 2016\nIn an interview with The New York Times published on Wednesday, Trump recounted a phone conversation with Tim Cook during which he urged the CEO to move part of Apple’s production line to the U.S.:\n“I was honored yesterday, I got a call from Bill Gates, great call, we had a great conversation, I got a call from Tim Cook at Apple, and I said, ‘Tim, you know one of the things that will be a real achievement for me is when I get Apple to build a big plant in the United States, or many big plants in the United States, where instead of going to China, and going to Vietnam, and going to the places that you go to, you’re making your product right here.’ He said, ‘I understand that.’ I said: ‘I think we’ll create the incentives for you, and I think you’re going to do it. We’re going for a very large tax cut for corporations, which you’ll be happy about.’”\nTrump is a vocal supporter of U.S. companies that build their products in the U.S., and has proposed levying steep tariffs — potentially as high as 45 percent — on competing Chinese importers.\nMore: Apple’s “touch disease” repair program for the iPhone 6 Plus is not free\nNikkei, citing a source familiar with Apple’s plans, reports that the Cupertino, California-based company has tasked Foxconn and Pegatron, the two tech firms responsible for assembling more than 200 million of Apple’s iPhones annually, with investigating the feasibility of building plants in the U.S.\n“We’re going to get Apple to build their damn computers and things in this country instead of other countries,” Trump said in a speech in January. “How does it help us when they make it in China?”\nPegatron reportedly demurred, citing logistical concerns. Foxconn agreed to compile report as soon as June, but company chairman Terry Gou warned that it would show drastically higher productions costs. The potential result? An iPhone made in the U.S. could retail for as much as anywhere between $740 and $1,300 for a 32GB iPhone 7 versus $650 today, according to Nikkei.\nApple has previously declined to move iPhones production stateside, citing costs.\nQuestion: Would you pay $80 more for your next iPhone if you knew it was Made in the USA?\n— Jeremy Kaplan (@SmashDawg) November 18, 2016\nA thorough report in the MIT Technology Review found that moving iPhone assembly to the U.S. would add $30 to $40 to the cost of an iPhone thanks to “transportation and logistics expenses [that] would arise from shipping parts.”\nMore: Superior silicon: How Apple is beating chipmakers at their own game\nManufacturing the smartphone’s hundreds of components domestically is an even pricier — and vastly more complex — proposition. Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook told CBS’ 60 Minutes in December 2015 that the U.S. labor pool lacked the skills necessary to carry out iPhone production, and Apple executives have estimated that it would take as long as nine months to recruit the roughly 8,700 industrial engineers that oversee Chinese assembly lines. And that’s before efficiency is taken into account: A 2012 CNN Money report noted that Chinese factories house workers in employee dormitories and “can send hundreds of thousands to the assembly lines at a moment’s notice.”\nThen there’s the U.S.’s lack of natural resources to consider. MIT Technology Review points out that few of the 75 elements required to manufacture the iPhone are available commercially in the U.S. Aluminum, for instance, requires bauxite, and there are no bauxite mines in the U.S. China, on the other hand, produces 85 percent of the world’s rare earth metals.\nMore: Spendy but indispensable: Breaking down the full $650 cost of the iPhone 5\nFurther complicating matters is Apple’s sprawling supply chain of more than 750 firms in over 20 countries. Taiwan Semiconductor produces crucial iPhone chips; South Korea’s SK Hynix and Japan’s Toshiba produce the handset’s memory modules; and Japan’s Japan Display and Sharp provide the iPhone’s display. “To make iPhones, there will need to be a cluster of suppliers in the same place, which the U.S. does not have at the moment,” an industry executive familiar with iPhone production told economics blog NorthCrane .\nRead More But Apple’s plan isn’t without precedent. In 2013, Motorola Mobility employed more than 3,800 employees to assemble the Moto X, a flagship Android phone, at a factory in Fort Worth, Texas. Just a year later, though, it was forced to shutter production as a result of “exceptionally tough” market conditions, according to Motorola president Rick Osterloh. The company subsequently moved production to China.\napple iphone manufacturing More Apple\nOthers have been more successful. Foxconn established a stateside iMac computer assembly line in 2012. A year later, Singapore-based Flextronics, manufacturer of Apple’s Mac Pro desktop computer, built a production line in Austin, Texas.\nMore: When will the iPhone use an OLED screen? Here are all the rumors\nIn October 2015, Sharp president Tai Jeng-wu suggested that if Apple were to begin producing smartphones in the United States, it would likely follow suit. “We are now building a new [advanced organic light-emitting diode] facility in Japan. We can make [OLED panels] in the U.S. too,” he said. “If our key customer demands us to manufacture in the U.S., is it possible for us not to do so?”\nBut China’s reaction could be severe. In an opinion piece published in a state-backed newspaper, the Chinese government warned of retaliatory measures if such trade restrictions were to go into effect. “A batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus. U.S. auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and U.S. soybean and maize imports will be halted. China can also limit the number of Chinese students studying in the U.S.,” a Global Times article read.\nView photos\nTim-Cook (1) More A move of production by Apple could also threaten the company’s relationship with Chinese leadership. Earlier this year, in what was widely seen as a protectionist move by regulators, Apple’s iBooks and iMovies were temporarily blocked within the country. And in June, China’s Beijing-based intellectual Property Office found that Apple’s iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus infringed on a design patent held by Chinese company Shenzhen Baili.\nApple has extended olive branches in recent months. The company invested $1 billion in China-based ridesharing app Didi Chuxing. It’ll open its first research and development facility in the country — a $45 million office within Beijing’s Zhongguancun Science Park — by the end of this year. And in October, it pledged to build a second facility in China’s Shenzhen province.\nMore: Apple planning a second research and development center in China\nEven if Apple were to move iPhone production to the U.S., it likely wouldn’t be enough to stem the country’s losses. Foxconn employed roughly 690,000 workers in China as of the end of April, down slightly from a peak of 1.3 million in 2012. The Economic Policy Institute, a U.S. think tank, estimated that the U.S. had lost five million manufacturing jobs between 2000 and 2014.\nBut politics may trump economics in the end. U.S. automaker Ford may prove the precursor of developments to come: On Friday, the company shelved plans to move production of its Lincoln crossover SUV from Kentucky to Mexico. “The Apple supply chain must treat Trump’s campaign pledge seriously and not write it off,” an industry executive told NorthCrane.\nArticle originally published in November 2016.

      "text": "Reuters/Issei Kato \nBad news for people with iPhones: Apple's messenger service, iMessage, has been targeted by spammers. \nYou may have already received one of these annoying messages. It's an unfortunate side effect of any big social network. \nBut the good news is that iMessage spam isn't really that dangerous, if you know what it is and what you can do about it. What does iMessage spam look like? \nHere's a spam message I've received: \nScreenshot/iMessage \nObviously, there are not really deals on Michael Kors products at that URL. \nHere are some other examples: \niMessage spam. — Greg Koenig (@gak_pdx) November 20, 2016 \n— Jason Toews (@ToewsJa) September 15, 2016 What should I do about it? \nIt should go without saying that if someone you don't know is messaging you, offering discount designer brands, you absolutely should not give them any personal information. \nApple also won't iMessage you to change your password. So don't fall for that, either. \nThe easiest thing you can do is to filter iMessages from people who aren't saved in your contacts. Go to Settings > Messages > turn on Filter Unknown Sender . \nApple \nApple \nTo block a specific sender, open the spam message. Tap Details > Info > Block this Caller , then confirm with Block Contact . \nTo report the spammer, you'll see a blue Report Junk option underneath the spam message. Tap it and select Delete and Report Junk . Otherwise, you can send an email to with a screenshot of the spam, and the phone number that sent it. What if I am sending out the spam? \nThis is the bigger problem. If your iMessage conversations look like this: \nMy iMessage was hijacked - looks like these were test messages in prep for sending out spam. +86 is China. pic.twitter.com/i4IflwCnVI — Dave Lee (@DaveLeeBBC) September 19, 2016 \nOr this: \nYou'll need to take action. First, change your Apple ID password — your attacker could have it. Second, turn on two-factor authentication . \nThat should take care of your iMessage spam problem. \nHaving a particularly hard time with iMessage spam or have another iPhone problem?

      "title": "Apple and Samsung Oppose New 'Extreme' Guideline to Modify Smartphones to Reduce Driver Distraction",
      "text": "Comment US Department of Transportation's NHTSA has issued voluntary guidelines for smartphone makers to modify their electronic devices. This is to reduce the risk of drivers getting distracted. One of the features that the NHTSA is requesting are portable devices that will pair with a car's infotainment system. Car Leasing Made Simple via Flickr \nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administrations (NHTSA) has issued new voluntary guidelines that will address concerns over an increase in traffic fatalities. Smartphone makers are asked to modify their electronic devices in a way that drivers would not be distracted by them. However, they seem to oppose it. \nThe said guidelines encourage manufacturers to install features that would pair a portable device to the car's infotainment system. They also need to have the Driver Mode feature. Both of these may \"reduce the potential for unsafe driver distraction.\" In this way, drivers won't have to take their eyes off the road. The NHTSA also mentioned that the pairing and Driver Mode will still \"preserve the full functionality of these devices\" that the driver can use once he/she is not already driving. \nThe threat of using the smartphone while driving is severe. NHTSA Administrator Dr. Mark Rosekind said that they encourage drivers to \"put down their phones and other devices, and just drive.\" Amidst the rise of fatalities connected to drivers getting distracted by their devices, he added that NHTSA is \"committed to working with the [smartphone] industry to ensure that mobile devices are designed to keep drivers' eyes where they belong, on the road.\" \nThough the NHTSA has the best of intentions, the proposed guidelines have drawn immediate opposition from the electronic industry, according to Bloomberg . Notably, the Consumer Technology Association (CTA) has described the guidelines as \"extreme.\" Apparently, they may have quite expected this move by the safety regulators. The affected companies had urged the NHTSA not to give into advocates that blame the government for not doing enough. This is with regards to at least 3,500 highway deaths in 2015 caused by distractions. \nThe CTA, in which tech giants Apple and Samsung are members, added that it's a \"regulatory overreach.\" CTA's President Gary Shapiro said that it would only impede the innovative technologies that are being developed to actually \"help drivers make safer decisions.\" Shapiro also mentioned in an emailed statement to Bloomberg that the NHTSA is not authorized to \"dictate the design of smartphone apps and other devices used in cars.\" Its legal jurisdiction should be limited to motor vehicle equipment. \nHe claimed that this might be an \"attempt by the outgoing administration to push out highly questionable, de facto regulations.\" The proposed guidelines also received criticism from a trade group of wireless companies, the CTIA. They say that it is a \"wrong approach for consumers.\" \nThe reaction of the smartphone makers is contrary to that of the automakers. Ford Motor Co's spokesperson Elizabeth Weigandt revealed that the automaker is encouraged that NHTSA is addressing the problem. The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers also shares the same sentiment. The group's spokesman Wade Newton said that \"it's important to encourage drivers to use in-vehicle systems rather than handheld personal devices.\" \nSafety advocates think that the guidelines fall short of what they expect the government should do. With all the conflicting parties, the drivers and passengers themselves stand the most to lose. The regulators, advocates, smartphone makers and car manufacturers should all work together and come up with a definite solution to alleviate highway deaths caused by distracted drivers. It remains to be seen if a compromise can be achieved.",

Oh, pull-down bar and notification shade, what would we do without you on Android! And you, pull-up iOS Control Center, how's that for a handy toggle access! Those hidden interface panels where phone makers place shortcuts for quick access to connectivity toggles, and host app, call or message notifications, are one of the more diverse interface segments that can make or brake the respective user experience. From background to layout, from iconography to notification access - each and every one of the major phone brands approaches the notification and toggle shades' visuals in a different manner, and provides different ways to access them. This interface element is usually tucked away from plain sight, and only visible when you pull up or down to preview a message or turn on, say, Bluetooth. The way you access the shade, however, and its layout, could make interaction with your device easier, or an exercise in frustration, that is why we wanted to do a brief listing of who does it how, so you can gauge what you are missing, or where the toggle panel of your phone maker excels compared to the rest. Check them out and tell us whose approach is your fav in the poll below. Apple vs Samsung vs LG vs Pixel and more notification shade solutions Popular galleries NEXT › image Apple's solution is not all-in-one like on Android phones. The iOS interface has a pull-up Control Center for the connectivity toggles, brightness, music or other controls, and a pull down panel for notifications, widgets and the like. We have to admit that this is a fine idea, as a/ you don't get a cluttered panel, and b/ it is much easy to pull the toggles from the bottom of the screen, instead of stretching all the way up every time if your interface doesn't have a quick access option. Apple image The world's largest phone maker has gotten plenty of flak through the years about its interface, and the notification shade used to be one of the culprits. Not only is it impossible to pull it by just swiping down on an empty screen area, but its background and iconography often clashed with the rest of the interface significantly. With the latest Nougat update, however, Samsung's UX has a new light background in the notification panel, new toggles iconography and entries like Night mode, and it has always had the handy brightness slider there ready for your input. Samsung image LG also reworked its notification/toggle panel in the newest G5 UX iteration, with a contrasting white background, flat, pleasant for the eyes icons, and a handy brightness and volume sliders there. The connectivity toggles are of the scrolling type by default, which makes the panel compact, but requires a bit of stretching if you want to reach a second-tier switch. LG image HTC has a very simplified approach to the shade - it pretty much went stock Android for it, with toggle grid on a dark background, a brightness slider up top, and a rectangular notification visuals. It's an acquired taste, but Android purists would like the flat, spartan, Material-ly designed layout. HTC image Motorola is also betting on a near-stock Android interface, and the notification shade is no exception, so you can expect the same dull grey background you would see on a Pixel phone, with barely any extra functionality but a grid of toggles. Moto image When it comes to an authentic Android interface, nothing can beat Google's Pixel phones - as you can see, the stock notification shade is pretty barebones, and a far cry in terms of visuals and options present in richer manufacturer overlays. It almost feels like it hasn't moved in looks and features in the past few Android editions. Google Pixel image The Chinese interface approaches are wiggling their way into the mainstream with the landing of brands like honor or ZTE in the US market, and the Emotion UI here is a pretty good example of what they bring - rich, well-crafted shades with transparent backgrounds that are pleasant to look at, and chockful of functionality. The EMUI 5.0 version does away with the annoying separation of the notification and toggle panels, and fuses them together for one less swipe needed. honor and Huawei image Last but not least, Sony also doesn't fluff away from the stock Android notification and connectivity toggles shade, so that makes it 4 out of 8 popular brands that went for the grayish grid look - bummer or a blessing, depends on how you feel about stock.

      "text": "November 23, 2016 — 7:01 PM EST Objections to Irish data center approval to be heard by judge Tiny village in west of country fears investment may be lost \n“An Apple a day keeps the bank man away -- stop objecting!” \nSo read the handwritten sign in Athenry, the tiny village close to Ireland’s Atlantic coast chosen by Apple Inc. for a vast $1 billion data facility. The message was for three people contesting the potential environmental impact and economic benefits from locals worried the company might scrap the project because of more than a year of delays. Meanwhile, the forestry site remains untouched before a judge hears another round of arguments in March. \nSpotted locally this morning #wasntme #athenryforapple Posted by PÃ³l O'Cathain on Tuesday, April 12, 2016 \n“This doesn’t just affect Athenry, but it affects Ireland as well,” said Paul Keane, 39, whose family has lived in the area for generations. “If Apple is turned away, what does it say about Ireland? It’s right that we have a fair and open system, but it can’t be dragged out.” \nWhat would be one of the most high-profile European investments for Apple is an even bigger deal for Ireland Inc. in what’s turned out to be a torrid year.

You will now receive the Game Plan newsletter Britain’s vote to leave the European Union has threatened to upend arrangements with one of its largest trading partners, while Donald Trump’s election victory might undermine Ireland’s status as a haven for U.S. companies in Europe. That was already in question after the EU ordered Apple to pay 13 billion euros ($13.8 billion) relating to its Irish tax arrangements. Both the company and government are appealing.\nFor some, Athenry illustrates a deeper issue: the difficulty executing large infrastructure developments in Ireland compared with other countries regardless of how attractive the tax regime might be. Apple has already broken ground on a similar project in Denmark that Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook announced simultaneously more than 18 months ago. \nAt that point, Cook expected the Irish data center to start operations in 2017. Now, it’s unlikely the project will be completed before March 2019 at the earliest based on the timeline company laid out at planning hearings. When asked about the delays, Apple pointed to Cook’s comment in September following the EU tax decision that the company remains “committed to Ireland.” \nApple Data Center Plans Source: Apple Inc. \nThe data center in the Derrydonnell forest is due to cover 166,000 square meters, the equivalent to about 23 soccer fields on completion. When Cook announced his plan, it was welcomed in a region that had become a byword for economic gloom, immortalized in a folk ballad in the mid-19th century. \nQuickly, the project became bogged down in planning objections. Last week, a Dublin court agreed to fast-track a second legal challenge to the planning approval, though that still means the case won’t be heard for another four months. While the court probably won’t block the center altogether, it could send the project back into the planning process if it finds flaws in the earlier procedure. Local Objections \nTwo of the objectors making the court challenges, Allan Daly and Brian McDonagh, declined to comment, while a third, Sinead Fitzpatrick, didn’t respond to calls to her office seeking comment. \nA flavor of their objections can be found in the submission by the Concerned Residents of Lisheenkyle made during the planning process. That includes concerns that the development may hurt the biodiversity of the wood, the lack of services linked to it and the limited employment associated with data centers. \nLocal supporters fear that Apple may grow impatient, prompting community leaders to organize a rally in favor of the project earlier this month. Organizers say a couple of thousand people showed up, including children carrying signs emblazoned with “‘Athenry for Apple” and “Athenry says Yes.” \n“It was a gesture of solidarity with Apple, to show that the vast majority of people in the area support the project, ” said Peter Feeney, a local councilor with Prime Minister Enda Kenny’s Fine Gael party. “There are only a few opponents. People are beginning to get fed up. This project means an awful lot to the area.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal. ",

      "text": "Reuters/Issei Kato \nBad news for people with iPhones: Apple's messenger service, iMessage, has been targeted by spammers. \nYou may have already received one of these annoying messages. It's an unfortunate side effect of any big social network.\nBut the good news is that iMessage spam isn't really that dangerous, if you know what it is and what you can do about it. \nWhat does iMessage spam look like?  Here's a spam message I've received:\nReuters/Issei Kato \nObviously, there are not really deals on Michael Kors products at that URL. \nHere are some other examples:\nTweet Embed:\nhttps://twitter.com/mims/statuses/800486632302358528\niMessage spam.\nIs this a thing now? pic.twitter.com/mTYZEFnpkb \n  Tweet Embed:\nhttps://twitter.com/mims/statuses/776412791871856640\nWhere does text message spam come from? https://t.co/PliuXbaeNw pic.twitter.com/TAEyZbZBpA \n What should I do about it?  It should go without saying that if someone you don't know is messaging you, offering discount designer brands, you absolutely should not give them any personal information.\nApple also won't iMessage you to change your password. So don't fall for that, either.\nThe easiest thing you can do is to filter iMessages from people who aren't saved in your contacts. Go to Settings > Messages > turn on Filter Unknown Sender . \nReuters/Issei Kato \nThat will put all iMessages from unknown contacts into a separate folder: \nReuters/Issei Kato \nTo block a specific sender, open the spam message. Tap Details > Info > Block this Caller , then confirm with Block Contact . \nTo report the spammer, you'll see a blue Report Junk option underneath the spam message. Tap it and select Delete and Report Junk . Otherwise, you can  send an email to  imessage.spam@apple.com  with a screenshot of the spam, and the phone number that sent it.\nMore recommendations from Apple here . \nWhat if I am sending out the spam? This is the bigger problem. If your iMessage conversations look like this:\nTweet Embed:\nhttps://twitter.com/mims/statuses/777732750405021696\nMy iMessage was hijacked - looks like these were test messages in prep for sending out spam. +86 is China. pic.twitter.com/i4IflwCnVI \n Or this:\nReuters/Issei Kato \nYou'll need to take action. First, change your Apple ID password — your attacker could have it. Second, turn on two-factor authentication .\nThat should take care of your iMessage spam problem.\nHaving a particularly hard time with iMessage spam or have another iPhone problem?

      "text": "Apple will release three new iPhone 8 models next year, according to reports from a source with an outstanding track record. The new models will supposedly include a flagship handset that features an OLED display, and then there will also be two LCD versions. The LCD iPhones would still come in 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch flavors, while the OLED model would measure 5.1-inch or 5.2-inch — that’s tipped to be the active area of a curved screen, not the full diagonal measurement. While the OLED iPhone will be the talk of the town in 2017, the same source believes that the 4.7-inch iPhone 8 will launch along with a big surprise that Apple fans (and analysts) are going to love.\nContinue reading... \nTrending right now: \nBest Buy’s Black Friday 2016 sale is now live: Here are the best deals you’ll find You don’t have to be a T-Mobile customer to get its best Black Friday deal Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade will be livestreamed in 360-degree video ",

      "text": "By Christopher White News Editor Neowin LLC @fezmid · 7 minutes ago with 1 comment \nThere's been a lot of talk about how to bring high-paying jobs back to the United States, especially in the manufacturing space. Apple has always been one of the main targets due to the fact that the company makes a lot of profit and outsources all of their manufacturing. There's also been reports that the companies that produce Apple's products work in less-than-ideal environments . \nDonald Trump, speaking with the New York Times, stated that he began a high level conversation with Apple's CEO to bring manufacturing of Apple's devices back to the United States. \nTim, you know one of the things that will be a real achievement for me is when I get Apple to build a big plant in the United States, or many big plants in the United States, where instead of going to China, and going to Vietnam, and going to the places that you go to, you’re making your product right here. \nIn order to entice companies like Apple to go down this path, he supports tax cuts and reduced regulations. However even with major cuts, it will still be more expensive to build products like the iPhone in the United States. It's estimated that labor currently costs are a mere $5 per phone. While it's unknown how much it would cost to make the same device in the United States, it's clear that it will be far higher than $5, even if there was enough skilled labor to perform the tasks. \nIf production was moved out of Asia, how much more would you be willing to pay for your iPhone? Let us know by answering the poll and commenting below.",

      "text": "\nBlack Friday isn’t usually kind toward shoppers looking for discounts on new Apple products. While a variety of other consumer electronics, such as television sets, are always a sure shot to be included among the best Black Friday deals, Apple’s iPhones, iPads, and Watch don’t usually get included among the top discounted products. But that doesn’t mean there aren’t any deals for those products – you just have to look a little harder for them.\nTalking about Apple’s current flagship phone, the iPhone 7 isn’t exactly discounted, but there are several “deals with a twist” which you may consider. According to MacWorld , you can get a $100 gift card from Best Buy if you purchase an iPhone 7 on a Sprint installment plan or lease agreement. That’s not much, however, compared to the $250 gift cards offered by Target and Walmart. These deals are similar in nature, but have their share of differences – Target’s iPhone 7 deal applies to monthly installments or lease agreements from AT&T, Sprint, or Verizon, while Walmart’s applies to any iPhone model available, but only covers installment plans or leases from AT&T or Verizon.\nBest Buy and Target have iPhone 7 Black Friday deals you shouldn’t miss https://t.co/bI6hKhuoI8 #BestBuy #target #iPhone7 #blackfriday \n— PhoneAngel (@findlostphone) November 11, 2016 \n\nT-Mobile also has its own iPhone 7 “deal with a twist,” meaning you don’t get a discount off the price of the phone, but get another way to save money on Black Friday. A report from BGR details the program , which allows shoppers to trade in their old flagship-caliber phones, such as the iPhone 6s, Samsung Galaxy S6, or similar devices, in exchange for an iPhone 7, with no extra cost. Owners of the iPhone 6, Galaxy Note 4, or Galaxy S5 can pay $100 to trade up to the iPhone 7, while those who own the even older iPhone 5 or 5c have to pay $350.\nWhile this is one of the best Black Friday deals for Apple’s iPhone 7, it also comes with a bit of a gotcha – you have to be signed up to T-Mobile’s One or Simply Unlimited plans.\nWhile it’s virtually impossible to find actual price cuts on the iPhone 7, you can save big-time if you’re looking to buy a new iPad. Over at Best Buy, you can save $125 off the price of all iPad mini 4 models, as well as all iPad Air 2 and 9.7-inch iPad Pro variants, provided you’re buying the bigger tablets in-store. The 9.7-inch iPad Pro, which usually costs $599, is priced at just $449 at Target, while Walmart shoppers don’t have much to pick from, but can still buy Apple’s older iPad mini 2 in-store for $199, instead of the regular price of $269.\n[Image by Stephen Lam/Getty Images] Other Apple gadgets are also selling at lower prices this Black Friday 2016. The original, first-generation Apple Watch carries a starting price of $189 for the standard aluminum Watch Sport flavor, or $250 for those who prefer the stainless steel models. MacWorld add that most first-generation Watch models are discounted “$350 to $ 400 from their original prices,” but also notes that newer Apple Watch models are still selling at full retail. You can, however, save $69 off the list price by purchasing the Apple Watch Series 1 at Target, as the retailer has that model available for just $200.\nBest Buy, once again, has the best Black Friday pricing on Apple laptops. According to MacWorld , you can save $100 off the price of the newest, entry-level configuration 13-inch MacBook Pro, as the retailer is selling it for $1,399 instead of $1,499. Other than that, savings can go as high as $200 on select MacBook variants. If you don’t mind an older MacBook Pro with Retina Display, B&H Photo has that model selling for $100 to $400 off, depending on the configuration, as well as all 12-inch MacBook and MacBook Air configurations selling for $100 less than full retail.\nThat wraps up our list of best Black Friday deals on Apple products, but before you start shopping and taking advantage of the discounts, take note of the usual disclaimer for holiday shopping discounts, or any similar deals, for that matter – offers are always good while supplies last.\n[Featured Image by Spencer Platt/Getty Images]\nBlack Friday 2016: Where To Get Best Black Friday Deals On Apple Gadgets is an article from: The Inquisitr News \n",

      "text": "Comment The US Patent and Trademark Office has granted Apple's patent of a possible foldable iPhone. In order to achieve, Apple has to use the flexible OLED display instead of its usual LCD display. Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge is integrated with OLED. Hence, its curved display. Răzvan Băltărețu via Flickr \nThe US Patent and Trademark Office has granted Apple's US Patent of \"flexible display devices\". The tech giant's patent of foldable iPhone seems to be a step ahead of Samsung. The patent application of the Korean-based company was previously published. It revealed a foldable display. Now, time will tell how soon it is for a foldable smartphone to finally hit the market. \nThe Apple Insider has reported that the Apple patent No. 9,504,170 described an iPhone that has a \"foldable full-screen display\". Apparently, the patent was first filed for in July 2014. Fletcher R. Rothkopf, Andrew J. M. Janis and Teodor Dadov were listed as the inventors. In order to achieve this innovation, Apple has to use a flexible \"metal-backed OLED display\". This seems to support the previous report that Apple is venturing more into using the OLED technology. The iPhone models that have been released all feature LCD display. This might be a sign that the company has already planned even back in 2014 of utilizing the new display technology. \nFor iPhone users, the possibility of this is a device that can be folded into two. This will provide more convenience and portability. Aside from the required OLED display, there needs to be a metal support structure. The nitinol, a nickel and titanium alloy have been proposed for that. According to the Apple Insider, the latter is known for its elasticity and unique shape memory abilities. Other alternatives include flexible polymers. \nThe idea is certainly music to one's ears. However, since Apple has to use an OLED display, it will take some time before a foldable iPhone will actually be commercially released. \nSamsung is Apple's primary supplier of OLED along with LG. Sharp is set to join by 2018. The maker of Samsung Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge have already been using the technology in some of its devices compared to Apple. It's the one leading when it comes to this display technology. \nSince an OLED display will open the way for such innovation, it's also possible that Samsung could come up with its own bendable smartphone. In fact, CNET previously reported that the published patent application of Samsung showed a phone that can be folded half down in the middle. There are also other reports that the tech company might release this smartphone next year . \nSam Mobile went as far as to say that one of the possible devices that could have this feature is the Galaxy X. If it's true, the said phone will probably be the first one to have completely foldable display. Based on that leaked image of the patent application, its hinge is akin to that of the Microsoft Surface Book. \nThe tech industry is a competitive market. It's important to keep consumers interested. Innovations are part of moving forward. Smartphone makers have to create devices that will provide convenience, portability and good performance to their buyers. \nWith the constant advancement of technology, Apple and Samsung will both end up with their own foldable smartphones. Though the date of when that will exactly happen is still out in the open.

Rothkopf , Andrew J. M. Janis , Teodor Dadov Related Apple vs. Samsung: The Battle Of Smartphone Giants - Samsung's Galaxy S8 Poses A Big Challenge For Apple's iPhone 8 It's public knowledge that Samsung and Apple are the biggest rivals in the smartphone industry. Each tech giant wants to outdo the other. Though the said market is suffering a decline in shipments, Samsung still tops Apple based on the preliminary data released by global research firm International Data Corporation for the third quarter of 2016. The two tech companies are set to clash again next year with the release of its new flagship devices the Galaxy S8 and iPhone 8. Will Apple Finally Say Goodbye To LCD Display And Hello To the Innovative OLED Display? Tech giant Apple is not a company associated with OLED or organic light-emitting diode display. In fact, Apple is yet to use the new display technology on its iPhones since it has been using LCD displays for the longest time. However, among other rumors surrounding the upcoming iPhone 8, Apple is supposedly working to integrate the said innovative technology. One obvious sign is by tapping the services of Samsung as its primary supplier. Samsung To Release Glossy Black Galaxy S7 To Compete Against iPhone 7's Hit Variants Samsung's Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge have taken the reigns after the whole Galaxy Note 7 fiasco. The Korean-based tech company has something up its leave before this year ends. Samsung plans to release a new glossy black Galaxy S7 in early December. The decision of adding a new hue may have been motivated by Apple's hit iPhone 7 shiny Jet Black and the Matte Black variants. Top Stories",

      "title": "Vince Staples Announces Beats 1 Radio Show, Premieres Sunday",
      "text": "It’s a good day to be a Beats 1 listener. Earlier today, the Apple radio show unveiled an in-depth profile with The Weeknd , who was interviewed by Zane Lowe on the creation of his impending album Starboy . But it has also just been announced that Vince Staples will be getting his very own show on the station, the first program of which will premiere this Sunday, November 27.\nThe show is titled “S E A B S,” which is an acronym for Section Eight Arthouse Broadcast System. According to a press release, it was created by Staples to be a “pirate radio-style broadcast full of music and interviews curated by Vince and designated to illuminate and distract the mind.” And if the trippy trailer is anything to go by, it looks like one hell of a distraction. Watch it below:\n\nIn the meantime, check out the video we made with Vince Staples where he took us shopping for streetwear:\n\nIn other music news, Nas has created an adorable line of holiday sweaters, the proceeds of which will go to charity. Take a look at them right here .\n",

      "text": "Analyst: Apple iPhone sales face ten years of \"malaise\" after next year Analyst: Apple iPhone sales face ten years of \"malaise\" after next year Posted: Tags : iOS - iOS + Apple - Apple + The future for the Apple iPhone after next year's 10th anniversary is not so bright according to a report by Oppenheimer analyst Andrew Uerkwitz. The banking and securities house expects sales of the iPhone to peak next year (Apple's 2018 fiscal year starts September 30th, 2017) with 245 million units rung up. That would be a 9% increase from the consensus estimate of 225 million units that FactSet is calling for during fiscal 2017. Uerkwitz says that next year will give Apple \"one last growth hurrah\" thanks to the 10th anniversary hoopla.The analyst says that after next year, consumers will start to \"drift away\" from the high prices Apple charges for its handsets. He also says that lack of new hardware features, and the closing of the performance gap between the iPhone and other high-end models will make it difficult for Apple to hike iPhone prices in the future.According to Uerkwitz, \"The risks to the company (Apple) have never been greater. We believe Apple is about to embark on a decade-long malaise.\" Another analyst, James Cakmak form Monness Crespi Hardt says that \"Apple wonât have it easy again for a while, if ever.\" He bases that on longer upgrade cycles, new focuses on VR and AR and competition from Google and Amazon.Another trend that could take a bite out of Apple is one that Apple is actually now a part of. From 2015 to 2020, IDC expects the used smartphone market to triple. Earlier this month, Apple started selling refurbished iPhone units through its online store. Prices are about $100 lower for these previously used models. PhoneArena is on Instagram . Follow us to stay updated with fresh news and flashy media from the world of mobile!",

      "text": "Reddit \nAs it has done in the past , Apple has released the open source Darwin code for macOS 10.12 Sierra. The code, located on Apple’s open source website, can be accessed via direct link now , although it doesn’t yet appear on the site’s home page . \nThe release builds on a long-standing library of open source code that dates all the way back to OS X 10.0. There, you’ll also find the Open Source Reference Library, developer tools, along with iOS and OS X Server resources. \nThe lowest layers of macOS, including the kernel, BSD portions, and drivers are based mainly on open source technologies, collectively called Darwin. As such, Apple provides download links to the latest versions of these technologies for the open source community to learn and to use. \nApple usually updates its open source Darwin code for public consumption not long after the public release of its latest update to OS X. Although the recently released macOS Sierra is the first version to adopt a new name , Apple has maintained the open source tradition with this release.

      "text": "Story highlights Ads for Apple, Amazon and others in 2016 ask if we can all just get along A Macy's ad reuniting a Santa parade balloon with an old friend will thaw even the iciest hearts (CNN) There is an unspoken list of requirements for blockbuster holiday ads: Adorable children, a tender piano score, a moment of crystallizing melancholy and maybe a cute dog. \nIt all builds to a heart-bursting crescendo of emotions that leaves you sobbing like a baby no matter how many times you've told yourself to stop crying at TV commercials. The marquee ads for 2016 are no different. And at a time when the world seems so divided, some of the biggest brands have gone with the most traditional of holiday messages: Togetherness. Go somewhere safe and dark where no one will judge you, watch and let the tears roll. Apple Read More Apple shelved their slick minimalist aesthetics and celebrity cameos for a cinematic spot starring, of all people, Frankenstein's monster. The ending card sends the message home: \"Open your heart to everyone.\" Amazon Some say Amazon's getting a little political with their latest offering, which features a priest and imam laughing over their shared struggles. Regardless of any controversy ( more on that here ), weepy viewers have been praising the ad on social media. \"It is the America I want to live in,\" one person wrote . John Lewis Year after year, this UK-based department store produces some of the most iconic and hyped-up holiday ads. After last year's sob-fest , they went a little lighter for 2016. Don't worry. You'll still cry, but you'll feel a little weirder about it because it's sweet, animated foxes making you do it. Marks & Spencer Don't be so dazzled by Marks & Spencer's glamorous, bad-ass Mrs. Claus that you miss the message of this one: A perpetually warring brother and sister who get real and set enmity aside for kindness and understanding. Macy's In this piece of weaponized wistfulness, Macy's wields their most iconic holiday institution to go straight for the jugular. The Santa balloon at the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade breaks loose to be reunited with an old friend. Mercy! Heathrow Airport Finally, there are always sleeper brands who surprise us with some truly touching ads. Take this one from the UK's Heathrow Airport, which features a twist ending. The ad closes with this universal sentiment: \"Coming home: The best gift of all.\"",

      "text": "Download our iOS app Apple to Roll Out 10.5-inch Bezel-Free iPad in 2017 With the 10.5-inch bezel-free iPad, Apple may provide us enough trailer about how the iPhone with edge-to-edge display will look like and work. \nApple is likely to launch the all new 10.5-inch iPad in 2017. The tablet will come with the latest A10X processor. \nThe production of 10.5-inch “education and enterprise” tablet is expected to begin next month. The latest report from DigiTimes further strengthens the rumor that a new iPad model is set to debut. Apple to Launch 10.5-inch iPad in 2017 \n“Apple is launching the 10.5-inch iPad mainly because 10-inch and larger tablets have been popular among enterprises and the education sector in the US, the sources said. Its existing 9.7-inch iPad may be too small and the 12.9-inch iPad Pro too expensive for such procurement, the sources indicated.” DigiTimes . \nRecently, a number of reports have claimed that Apple is going to introduce a new tablet. Some have even stated that the 10.5-inch model will be bezel-free and debut alongside 9.7 and 12.9-inch iPads. Powered by the advanced CPU A10X, the tablet will run more smoothly. \n“The 10.5-inch iPad will be equipped with Apple-developed CPU A10X which is also used in 12.9-inch iPad Pro.” \nFollowing the huge decline in iPad sales recently, the tech giant is putting more efforts to attract Android users. The launch of the lower-price versions of the 9.7-inch iPad is also on the radar with a view to making inroads into Android tablets. \nThe edge-to-edge display on the iPad could also provide fair amount of idea about how a bezel-free iPhone 8 would look like. \nThe 10.5-inch iPad is likely to boost the sales with two million units are expected to be sold in the first-quarter of 2017 and may reach 5-6 million units in the year. \nThere is not much known with regard to the new features which will arrive with the 2017 model of iPads. If there is anything that most users would want to see in the latest tablet has to be the ability to be a more competent alternative to laptops.

      "text": "33 shares \nIt’s hard to imagine modern-day Apple ever struggling. The company is the most valuable one in the world, and it sits upon a veritable Mount Everest of cash. But one industry analyst thinks that the good times are about to come to an end , with the company will soon enter a “decade-long malaise.” Oh dear. \nModels created by Oppenheimer analyst Andrew Uerkwitz suggest that sales of the iPhone (which accounts for an astronomical share of Apple’s profits) are going to peak with next year’s 10th anniversary model. \nWhile it’s expected that Apple will sell 245 million iPhones in the 2018 fiscal year, which runs from October 2017 to September 2018, representing a sales increase of 9%, Uerkwitz believes that this will be “one last growth hurrah.” After that, sales will start to stagnate, or even drop. \nAccording to Uerkwitz, this is because Apple itself has stagnated somewhat. The latest iPhone (and indeed, MacBook Pro ) launches were deeply underwhelming affairs. Apple continues to command large sums for devices that, simply put, can’t justify their price tag. Eventually, consumers are going to drift away. \n“The risks to the company have never been greater,” said Uerkwitz. “We believe Apple is about to embark on a decade-long malaise.” \nEchoing the sentiments expressed by Uerkwitz, another analyst believes that Apple’s woes will be exacerbated by an increasing appetite by the public for used and refurbished smartphones. This market is expected to triple between 2015 and 2020. \nMonness Crespi Hardt’s James Cakmak suggested that Apple’s refurbished-phone-program may potentially cannibalize sales of new iPhones, which could further depress average selling prices, resulting in a lower markup for the company. \nMake no mistake. In the short-to-medium term, Apple is going to be fine. It’s too big and too rich to fail. \nBut as we all saw with Blackberry , and indeed with Apple in the 1990’s, it’s incredibly easy to fall into a downward spiral that results in the gradual strangulation of the company. The difference is that this time around, there’s no visionary Steve Jobs to save it.",

      "text": "Donald Trump Offers Tim Cook ‘Very Large Tax Cut’ If Apple Brings iPhone Production To United States Posted by Rajesh Pandey on Nov 24, 2016 | No Comments tweet \nThe full transcript of President-Elect Donald Trump with the New York Times from earlier this week . In the interview, Donald Trump had revealed that Apple’s CEO Tim Cook had called him up after he won the presidential race. \nIn the phone call, Trump told Cook that he would consider it a “real achievement” for himself if he managed to get Apple to build a plant in the United States instead of the company building them in China or Vietnam. For this, Trump is ready to provide Apple with incentives like “large tax cut” \nI said: ‘I think we’ll create the incentives for you, and I think you’re going to do it. We’re going for a very large tax cut for corporations, which you’ll be happy about.’ But we’re going for big tax cuts, we have to get rid of regulations, regulations are making it impossible. Whether you’re liberal or conservative, I mean I could sit down and show you regulations that anybody would agree are ridiculous. It’s gotten to be a free-for-all. And companies can’t, they can’t even start up, they can’t expand, they’re choking. \nOne of the key highlights of Trump’s presidential campaign was to make the United States great again by bringing manufacturing of key products back in the country. While the move may help create more jobs in the country, it could lead to a substantial increase in the cost of production for most companies that could directly affect the final prices of the product. \nA recent report claimed that Tim Cook had asked Apple’s chief suppliers Foxconn and Pegatron to study the cost and effects of moving iPhone production to the United States. While Foxconn has complied with Apple’s request and has started looking into the matter, the company’s chairman is not particularly happy with this due to the increased cost of production. \nAlmost all of Apple products and devices are manufactured outside of the United States. Majority of the products are manufactured in Asian countries like China and Taiwan due to their low labour cost and expertise in certain technology. Mac Pro is the only product in Apple’s lineup that is currently being manufactured in the United States, but its production yields are very low.",

The code, located on Apple's open source website, can be accessed via direct link now , although it doesn't yet appear on the site's home page. The release builds on a long-standing library of open source code that dates all the way back to OS X 10.0. There, you'll also find the Open Source Reference Library, developer tools, along with iOS and OS X Server resources. The lowest layers of macOS, including the kernel, BSD portions, and drivers are based mainly on open source technologies, collectively called Darwin. As such, Apple provides download links to the latest versions of these technologies for the open source community to learn and to use.",

      "text": "Home / Mobile / Samsung / Judge: Samsung didn’t ‘willfully’ infringe Apple patents Judge: Samsung didn’t ‘willfully’ infringe Apple patents Admin January 30, 2013 Samsung Samsung didn’t ‘willfully’ infringe \nU.S. District Court Judge Lucy Koh handed down some of her first post-trial rulings from the much publicized Apple v. Samsung patent case this evening. \nIn a 32-page order filed today, the judge said she predominantly agreed with the jury’s decision that Samsung infringed on seven of Apple’s design and utility patents. However, she disagreed with one finding — that Samsung “willfully” infringed on Apple’s patents. \nWhat this means is that Apple will now be unable to triple its damage awards. If Koh had agreed with the jury on this decision, Apple could have collected up to as much as three times in damages from Samsung. \nThe trial between the two tech giants wrapped up in August after the jury awarded Apple $1.05 billion in damages. However, the two sides have been duking it out over a final judgment on damages. Apple has been trying to tack on more than $500 million, while Samsung has been trying to shave off $600 million. \nKoh wrote in her ruling that in order to find Samsung willfully infringed on the patents, Apple would have to prove “by clear and convincing evidence that the infringer acted despite an objectively high likelihood that its actions constituted infringement of a valid patent.” Samsung has argued that it didn’t think Apple’s patents were valid and therefore didn’t believe it was infringing. Koh has accepted Samsung’s argument for the “willful” standard. \nDespite Koh ruling that no “willful” infringement took place, she still maintains the jury’s findings that Samsung did infringe on Apple’s patents.

      "text": "Apple Launches iPhone 6s Repair Program for Faulty Batteries By PC Mag ME Team Nov. 22, 2016, 10 a.m. Unlike the Touch Disease fix, this one won't cost $149. \nLast week, Apple launched a repair program after acknowledging the iPhone 6 Plus had a touchscreen issue widely dubbed as \"Touch Disease.\" The program was not received well as Apple blames users for the problem rather than concluding there is a design fault on the phone. Because of that, the repair will cost iPhone 6 Plus owners $149. And now we have a second repair program underway , only this one is for the iPhone 6s. \nA small batch of iPhone 6s handsets manufactured between September and October 2015 have a battery issue. There's no threat of injury or phone damage, but your 6s may unexpectedly shut down. The battery is at fault and Apple will happily replace it for you for free. Related Articles Apple iPhone 7 vs. iPhone 6s: Should You Upgrade? \nIf you have been experiencing the unexpected shut downs, take your iPhone 6s to an Apple retail store or an authorized Apple service provider. The serial number of your phone will be checked to verify it is carrying one of the faulty batteries. If it is, expect a replacement to be fitted to solve the issue. \nBefore taking your smartphone to be checked, Apple recommends backing up your data to iTunes or iCloud, turning off the \"Find my iPhone\" feature, and erasing data and settings in Settings > General > Reset > Erase all Content and Settings. \nThere are two ways this \"free repair\" could end up costing you money. If your iPhone 6s is experiencing the shut down problem and ends up not being eligible for the repair program, you can probably expect to pay for the fix. Also, if your phone has another issue that interferes with a battery replacement, for example, the screen is cracked, Apple won't replace the battery unless you agree to have that fault repaired as well, which won't be free.",

      "title": "IPad Pro, iPad Air 2 And Kindle Fire Black Friday Deals With Up To $150 Sales Revealed",
      "text": "Black Friday SALES on Apple iPads, Bluetooth Keyboard iPad Cases and Kindle Fire Cases announced by Tablet XRay\nChicago, IL, USA – November 24,\nThere are several generations of Apple iPads in the market and all of them have received price cuts this Black Friday 2016. Both, the 9.7” and 12.9” versions of the iPad Pro are on sale. Some deals are available only online, while others are available both in-store and online.\nThis list of up to $150 off Apple iPad and Kindle Fire Black Friday DEALS summarizes some of the best Amazon Kindle and Apple iPad-related deals available this Black Friday. Some of them are already live, some will start on Thanksgiving Day, and others will be exclusively available on Black Friday.\nGo to http://TabletXRay.com/Holiday-Deals to learn about all the sales offered on different stores like Target, Staples, Best Buy, and Amazon.\nOne of the major dilemmas iPad deal hunters face this year is whether to go with an iPad Pro or iPad Air 2. They have their similarities, but they also have a few major differences. “In spite of these differences, for most shoppers this year, spending the extra $100 – $200 on a 9.7” iPad Pro cannot be justified given how good the iPad Air 2 already is” explains Chase Pray, a spokesperson for Tablet XRay. The iPad Pro comes with an A9X processor which is more powerful than the A8X of the iPad Air 2. However, both of them have the same super high-resolution 2048 X 1536, 264 PPI HD display.\n“There are 3 major strengths of iPad Pro compared to the iPad Air 2; the iPad Pro (1) supports the Apple Pencil, (2) has up to 256GB of internal storage, and (3) offers 4K video shooting. These are all great features, however, not many tablet users will ever use these. This is why the Apple iPad Air 2 may be the better option for most tablet shoppers this Black Friday” elaborates Pray.\nTablet XRay also goes on to list multiple models of iPad cases with and without Wireless Bluetooth keyboards whose prices have been slashed by up to 70% this November 25th, 2016. While some of the more expensive smart iPad covers are made with 100% genuine leather, aluminum-made and plastic smart covers are also on sale this Black Friday sales week.\n“The Amazon Kindle Fire range of tablets are much cheaper than Apple iPads this year” exclaims Pray. “While the 12.9” iPad Pro can cost nearly $1000, the entry-level 7 inch Kindle Fire will be cheaper than $35. That is a huge difference that will make a huge difference in shoppers’ buying behaviors this holiday season. Almost every model of the Kindle Ereader range are also on sale this year. The Kindle reader, the Kindle Paperwhite and the Kindle Voyage E-reader, all have received handsome price cuts. The only model that is not currently on sale is the high-end eReader, the Kindle Oasis” concludes Pray.\n http://TabletXRay.com/\nContact Info:\nName: Chase Pray\nOrganization: Tablet XRay\nSource: http://marketersmedia.com/ipad-pro-ipad-air-2-and-kindle-fire-black-friday-deals-with-up-to-150-sales-revealed/149226\nRelease ID: 149226\n ",

      "text": "TOP The new iPhone SE is displayed during an Apple special event at the Apple headquarters on March 21, 2016 in Cupertino, California. Apple announced the iPhone SE and a 9.7\" version of the iPad Pro. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) 5339273 \nFor every holiday season in recent years, Apple has been a go-to for shoppers looking to get their loved ones electronics. This year’s offering, however, has a fair share of defects. \nApple announced Sunday that it “has determined that a very small number of iPhone 6s devices may unexpectedly shut down.” The tech company stressed that it is not a safety issue, perhaps to assuage any painful memories of Samsung’s recent problems with exploding devices. \nCustomers can have their battery replaced or exchanged if they prove the phone was made between September and October 2015. The offer came only a few days after Apple made another announcement on its own website offering repair programs for the iPhone 6 Plus — for $150. \nA lawsuit was filed roughly a couple months ago, according to Reuters, because plaintiffs complained that the touchscreens of their iPhone 6 Plus was not working properly. \nApple claims that this is only triggered due to dropping the devices, while another private tech company, iFixit, asserts that the malfunction stems from “a design defect.” \n“Apple has determined that some iPhone 6 Plus devices may exhibit display flickering or Multi-Touch issues after being dropped multiple times on a hard surface and then incurring further stress on the device,” the official blog post reads. The kink is being colloquially referred by some as the “Touch Disease.” \nCustomers with this issue are eligible for a repair at a reduced-price as long as the screen is not cracked or broken (which would disqualify a large portion of consumers). (RELATED: Apple May Be Flirting With The Idea Of An All-Glass iPhone) \nIt was also recently reported that not all of Apple’s iPhone are made in the same way, which causes some devices to perform functions slower than others . \n“The data indicates that the iPhone 7 is not taking advantage of all of Verizon’s network capabilities,” Gabriel Tavridis, head of product at Twin Prime, told Bloomberg. “I doubt that Apple is throttling each bit on the Verizon iPhone, but it could have chosen to not enable certain features of the network chip.” \nBut Apple combats that accusation. \n“Every iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus meets or exceeds all of Apple’s wireless performance standards, quality metrics, and reliability testing,” Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller told Bloomberg. \nSend tips to [email protected] .

Were going for a very large tax cut for corporations, which youll be happy about. But were going for big tax cuts, we have to get rid of regulations, regulations are making it impossible. Whether youre liberal or conservative, I mean I could sit down and show you regulations that anybody would agree are ridiculous. Its gotten to be a free-for-all.

      "title": "How Apple lost China to local smartphone makers",
      "text": "Two years ago, Oppo and Vivo couldn't crack the top five in China's smartphone market. Now they outrank everyone after elbowing Apple aside, thanks to people like Cheng Xiaoning.\nCheng runs a thriving electronics store in the rural town of Miaoxia, tapping into her WeChat social media account to promote the brands that pay the biggest commission, and in her case that's Oppo and Vivo.\nWhile such payments start at about 40 yuan ($6), they escalate for more expensive handsets and reach almost 200 yuan for Oppo's high-end smartphones.\n\"That's why I like to introduce the Oppo R9 Plus to potential customers,\" she said. \"Business has been perfect, actually never been better.\"\nVIDEOS TOP JOBS Cheng and tens of thousands of like-minded boosters form the vanguard of the pair's charge against Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. Working with the local stores that dominate sales in China's far-flung provinces, Oppo and Vivo came out of nowhere to upend the industry order and squeeze out former local darling Xiaomi Corp. Their labels graced one out of every three smartphones sold within China in the third quarter, while the iPhone's market share at 7 percent stood at its lowest in almost three years.\nOppo and Vivo trace their origins to reclusive billionaire Duan Yong Ping and employ similar strategies. That includes harnessing the spending power of rural customers away from top-tier cities such as Beijing and Shanghai. It's where Apple's vulnerable given the iPhone's lofty price tag. They eschewed e-commerce to instead court the stores where three-quarters of smartphone sales take place. Apple has been more reluctant to relinquish the retail experience to local free-agents, who sometimes charge brands for in-store displays and posters.\n\"Oppo and Vivo are willing to share their profit with local sales. The reward was an extremely active and loyal nationwide sales network,\" said Jin Di, an IDC analyst based in Beijing. While they declined to detail their subsidy program, she estimates the two were the top spenders in the past year. \"They're doing something different -- they do local marketing.\"\nChina had for years driven Apple's and Samsung's growth. The U.S. company generated almost $59 billion of sales from the region in fiscal 2015, which was more than double the level just two years earlier. During that time its shares surged more than 60 percent. At its peak, Greater China yielded almost 30 percent of its revenue and Apple was neck-and-neck with Xiaomi for the mantle of market leader as users clamored for the larger iPhone 6 models. Even as the domestic economy began to sputter, Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook spent a good chunk of an earnings call last year talking up the country's promise, saying Apple's investing there \"for the decades ahead.\"\nThen the country's slowdown and regulatory tangles took their toll. Authorities intervened, blocking iTunes Movies and iBooks, ending a period of near-unimpeded growth in the country. But perhaps most crucial was the ascendancy of cheaper but just-as-good local alternatives. Oppo and Vivo's gains have come mainly at the expense of lower-tier names thus far, but if they climb further into the premium segment, the U.S. company will need an answer. Some think the 10th-anniversary iPhone due in 2017 could deliver.\n\"Apple needs to offer something cutting-edge to appeal to maturing Chinese smartphone users,\" Counterpoint Research director Neil Shah writes. Oppo and Vivo can use the time until then to cement their positions, he said.\nTogether Oppo and Vivo shipped about 40 million smartphones in the third quarter, about 34 percent of devices sold in the world's biggest market, according to IDC. In 2012, their combined share was about 2.5 percent. IPhone shipments plunged more than a third to 8.2 million during the period -- less than half of Vivo's. Samsung, which once led the market, now settles for roughly 5 percent, according to Counterpoint.\nAs Apple has faltered in China, Cook has stepped up his courtship of decision-makers. He visited the country several times this year, unveiled plans for research centers in Beijing and Shenzhen, and invested $1 billion in Uber rival Didi Chuxing. Cook said on his last earnings call he remains confident of a return to growth this quarter.\nSamsung declined to comment for this story, while Apple directed Bloomberg to Cook's previous remarks on China.\nIt's unclear how Apple can reclaim lost ground in the interim. Previous attempts to drift down-market -- with the iPhone 5c and SE, for instance -- fizzled as local users shunned seemingly inferior devices. Apple doesn't run a vibrant online social community for users the way some of its local rivals do. And competing on price will jeopardize the industry's fattest profit margins.\nOppo and Vivo pack high-end specs into a phone that sells for a fraction of its rival's in China, where iPhone 7s start at 5,388 ($784). Consider the Oppo R9 plus: for 2,999 yuan, buyers get an aluminum body, 6-inch display, 16-megapixel camera and a battery that claims 19 hours of calls, photo and web browsing. Vivo's high-end Xplay6, with a price tag of 4,498 yuan, also undercuts Apple.\n\"Both companies invested heavily in marketing,\" said Nicole Peng, Asia Pacific research director at consultancy Canalys. Oppo and Vivo have a strong grip on the middle market for phones from $200 to $500, she said. \"Their offline channel strategy paid off.\"\nThe man who's clobbering Apple started out low on the tech spectrum. Duan made his fortune selling DVD players, telephones and game consoles similar to Nintendo's. Bubugao Communication Equipment Co. Ltd., the parent of Vivo, emerged from a restructuring in 1999 that split his company. The billionaire later teamed with long-time colleague Tony Chen and others to found what came to be known as Guangdong Oppo Electronics Co.\nWhile Duan has kept a low profile since moving to the U.S. in 2001, he occasionally makes his way into the spotlight. In 2006, he bid a then-record $620,100 to have lunch with Warren Buffett. Oppo's first smartphone came in 2011, when it unveiled a device with a BlackBerry-like keyboard. The same year, Bubugao created the business that would become Vivo. » Next page... Single page",

Oppo said it sells its products through roughly 240,000 privately owned stores as of June -- six times the global count of McDonald's. Vivo manages about half that, said Jin. Oppo, which doesn't disclose sales figures, said about 90 percent of its phones were sold offline. \nWhile Xiaomi shot to international prominence with flash online promotions, that success has been concentrated in densely packed cities. That doesn't work so well in the countryside, where novice buyers want advice and demonstrations. By cultivating a physical network, Oppo and Vivo are building a platform difficult to replicate in the short run. About Us",

Only 20 of Apple’s 107 executives are women, and only 5 of those executives are members of a minority group. Those numbers are pretty much unchanged from a year ago. \nMore: Microsoft to begin rewarding executives for diversity hiring \nOne layer down, things get a little better — but not by much. While women made up 27 percent of management, 65 percent of those managers are white, 23 percent Asian, and 11 percent from other minority groups. This data comes from a form called the EEO-1, which companies must file with the U.S. Equal Emplo yment Opportunity Commission. \nApple, along with a number of other companies, has pledged to boost diversity, and has said in the past that increased diversity isn’t just good for society, but also makes sense from a business perspective. While these numbers aren’t that great, Apple says that the data on them does not reflect how the company breaks down its workforce internally, nor how it measures its diversity. \nApple does seem to be moving in the right direction, even if its changes are small — the company’s new hires were 37 percent women and 27 percent underrepresented minorities. Microsoft, on the other hand, seems to be moving in the wrong direction — the company’s latest reports showed that the number of women at Microsoft has declined for the second year in a row.

      "text": "Apple will release three new iPhone 8 models next year, according to reports from a source with an outstanding track record. The new models will supposedly include a flagship handset that features an OLED display, and then there will also be two LCD versions. The LCD iPhones would still come in 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch flavors, while the OLED model would measure 5.1-inch or 5.2-inch — that’s tipped to be the active area of a curved screen, not the full diagonal measurement. While the OLED iPhone will be the talk of the town in 2017, the same source believes that the 4.7-inch iPhone 8 will launch along with a big surprise that Apple fans (and analysts) are going to love.\nDEAL ALERT: The best Black Friday sale of the year is happening right now!\nAn update to the iPhone SE isn’t expected for early next year, which could suggest that the 4.7-inch might replace it. Apple’s 2017 iPhones are expected to feature all-glass, buttonless designs, which means the 4.7-inch iPhone 8 could be smaller in size than its predecessors.\nAnalyst Ming-Chi Kou said in a research note seen by Apple Insider that the 4.7-inch iPhone 8 could become either a new mid-range or low-end iPhone for Apple. In other words, the big (and much appreciated) surprised that could come along with the smaller iPhone 8 next year is a price drop. The 5.5-inch iPhone 8 would still be more expensive than the 4.7-inch version, but likely cheaper than the OLED iPhone 8.\nThe LCD iPhones are expected by Kuo to account for 30-35% of sales in the fiscal year 2017, while the OLED iPhone could account for as much as 50-55% of sales. The iPhone 8 Plus would account for between 10-15% of new iPhone shipments next year.\nKuo expects Apple to sell anywhere from 90 million to 110 million new iPhone units in 2017. The analyst also explained recently that the new all-glass design coming to next year’s iPhone 8 lineup will accommodate an exciting new feature: Wireless charging .\nTrending right now:\nBest Buy’s Black Friday 2016 sale is now live: Here are the best deals you’ll find You don’t have to be a T-Mobile customer to get its best Black Friday deal Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade will be livestreamed in 360-degree video See the original version of this article on BGR.com",

Only 20 of Apple’s 107 executives are women, and only 5 of those executives are members of a minority group. Those numbers are pretty much unchanged from a year ago. \nMore: Microsoft to begin rewarding executives for diversity hiring \nOne layer down, things get a little better — but not by much. While women made up 27 percent of management, 65 percent of those managers are white, 23 percent Asian, and 11 percent from other minority groups. This data comes from a form called the EEO-1, which companies must file with the U.S. Equal Emplo yment Opportunity Commission. \nApple, along with a number of other companies, has pledged to boost diversity, and has said in the past that increased diversity isn’t just good for society, but also makes sense from a business perspective. While these numbers aren’t that great, Apple says that the data on them does not reflect how the company breaks down its workforce internally, nor how it measures its diversity. \nApple does seem to be moving in the right direction, even if its changes are small — the company’s new hires were 37 percent women and 27 percent underrepresented minorities. Microsoft, on the other hand, seems to be moving in the wrong direction — the company’s latest reports showed that the number of women at Microsoft has declined for the second year in a row. Microsoft blames layoffs in its phone division. \nThis article was originally posted on Digital Trends Content provided by INFORMATIONAL DISCLAIMER The information contained on or provided through this site is intended for general consumer understanding and education only and is not intended to be and is not a substitute for professional financial or accounting advice.

      "title": "New report details the crazy next-gen camera supposedly coming to Apple’s iPhone 8",
      "text": "Apple’s iPhone 8 is going to offer buyers mostly the same camera setup as the current iPhone 7 family, according to rumors so far. That means the 4.7-inch model will have a single-lens rear camera, while the 5.5-inch Plus and the OLED iPhone 8 will both have cameras featuring two lenses. But a new report from Korea says that Apple is now working with LG on a new kind of camera for the iPhone 8, and it could be a game changer.\nDEAL ALERT: The best Black Friday sale of the year is happening right now!\nAccording to ETNews , Apple and LG Innotek “united forces” to develop a camera module that will support 3D photography. The next-gen 3D camera will combine LG Innotek’s technology with Apple’s own dual camera tech based on its LinX acquisition.\n“Apple is now studying how to apply its 3D camera technology into LG Innotek’s smartphone camera,” sources supposedly familiar with the matter said. “Since LG Innotek also has its own 3D camera and related technologies, such joint efforts will likely to bear fruit sometime within next year.”\nThe report notes that LG Innotek is currently the exclusive supplier of the iPhone 7 Plus’s dual lens camera. It also highlights the fact that LG Innotek has its own 3D camera technology which it used for the LG Optimus 3D smartphone back in 2011. That sounds a bit disconcerting, considering that LG hasn’t released any phones with 3D cameras since then.\nOn the other hand, Apple is only expected to build on its dual-camera hardware going forward. 3D photography and video, as well as AR and VR features are among the possible camera innovations that Apple may be toying with for next year’s iPhone.\nTrending right now:\nYou don’t have to be a T-Mobile customer to get its best Black Friday deal Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade will be livestreamed in 360-degree video Looking for a NES Classic deal over Thanksgiving?

      "title": "5 Best Free VPN Services for iOS and OS X",
      "text": "1 \nApple revolutionized technology with the release of the iPhone and the MacBook. The launch of every new model has been met with tremendous fanfare and mass media coverage. All of this has caused the popularity of the company to surge upwards. Unfortunately, the increased attention comes not just from buyers and fans, but from hackers and other cyber criminals as well. This is exactly why you don’t want your digital footprints all over the Internet and it is your responsibility to safeguard your personal information. The most effective method of doing so is to set up a Virtual Private Network (VPN) for your iOS (iPhone) and OS X (MacBook) devices. This keeps your gadget encrypted and maximizes the security potential during online activity. Or if you’re looking for best vpn for torrenting then you also came into the right place. Let’s take a look at the five best VPN services available for the OS X and iOS platforms that you can download for free. Opera (iOS) \nSetting up a VPN for your iOS device is often an expensive affair. However, Opera has launched a free, unlimited VPN for iPhones that enable users to safely log onto the Internet from different locations. This iOS app is very user-friendly and offers online connectivity in the United States. You even have the option of routing your traffic through Germany, Singapore, Canada, or Netherlands. Apart from providing you with a new region, this VPN tool efficiently blocks all trackers and ads. The company claims that this VPN will be available free for life to users. Being relatively new, there are no immediate plans for the app to serve up ads in the near future. TunnelBear (iOS, OS X) \nBoth OS X and iOS platforms are supported by the TunnelBear VPN service. The reason why TunnelBear is so popular among users is its user interface; the developers designed it for regular people instead of IT administrators, and it shows. This is definitely one of the most “beautiful” VPN apps available on the Internet. You get free VPN services up to 500 MB each month. Setting up this tool is very simple, and all you need to do is download it and then create an account. The iOS platform takes care of the VPN configuration by itself. On the OS X side, you need to choose the country you wish to use and then secure your traffic with the flick of a switch. By connecting to the servers of different countries, you get access to region-specific content. The service works very smoothly, and though VPN connections are supposed to be a bit slower than direct connections, it is barely noticeable with TunnelBear. Blocked and censored websites are now easier to bypass and your digital privacy level also receives a boost with this VPN. Auto-reconnection options are available for hibernating devices. Hotspot Shield (iOS, OS X) \nIf you don’t mind ads, then the free version of Hotspot Shield is for you. This VPN tool comes jam-packed with some amazing features and is compatible with OS X and iOS platforms. Users find it helpful to know when the VPN connection is on or off, and the service alerts you when you’re trying to access a site that’s been linked to phishing or malware. The developers update the VPN on a regular basis and it has come a long way in terms of stability. Users are sure to appreciate the speed and usability aspects of this VPN. Hotspot Shield is one of the most popular VPNs for iOS and MacBook users, with a dedicated user base of more than 175 million. VPNBook (OS X) \nVPNBook is clearly meant for more serious Internet users, and though the service is entirely free, the process of installation might be a bit tougher than other VPN tools in the industry. On the plus side, you do not have to register before you use this VPN, which means the process of setting it up is less time-consuming. Though several platforms are supported by this virtual private network, iOS is not one of them. However, MacBook users on the OS X platform have plenty of reason to celebrate as there is no limit on the bandwidth. Even if you do get confused about some aspect, the VPNBook site comes with detailed guides that help with the installation of your VPN connection. VPN Express (iOS, OS X) \nThe only drawback of VPN Express – the reason why it places last on this list – is registration is mandatory if you want to enjoy surfing the Internet anonymously. Once the installation and registration process is done, you can enjoy up to 300 MB of free bandwidth. The installation process for VPN Express is a breeze, thanks to the auto setup feature which does most of the work on behalf of the user. \nA limited budget shouldn’t deter you from getting the best online security tools for your iOS and OS X platform-based devices. Your private information and data are just too important! Even though free VPNs for Apple devices do not provide access to all the features of their paid counterparts, at least you get to enjoy a secure connection along with a data allowance that you can use when you require it the most.

      "text": "apple accessories deals power time watch More It’s expensive being an Apple fanboy. Not only do you typically pay a premium for Cupertino’s latest hardware, but Apple’s accessories can often also cause sticker shock. Fortunately, when it comes to shopping for accessories, the Apple Store isn’t your only source.\nWhether you’re looking to pair your newly minted iPhone with wireless headphones or simply need to restock on a few Lightning cables, we’ve rounded up a few accessory deals for everything from your iPhone to your MacBook. Some of these are on our DT Shop, and others are on Best Buy, MacMall, Amazon, or Newegg. We will add to these over time and swap out deals.\nApple Pencil for iPad Pro 13696634_xxlg_0 More Your iPad Pro isn’t just another tablet, so don’t get just another stylus for it. The Apple Pencil allows you to work on your iPad with precision and also helps to expand the versatility of multi-touch. While you’re not writing with any actual ink, you might as well be using a real pen.\n$89 on MacMall\nLogitech Bluetooth Keyboard Case for iPad Air 2 9483426_sd More If you’ve been craving a physical keyboard for your iPad 2, this is the product for you. This Logitech Type+ 920-006912 case features a Bluetooth keyboard with iOS shortcuts, allowing you to remain productive no matter where you are. The case also offers ergonomic viewing angles for both reading and typing.\n$79 on Best Buy\nBeats Solo 2 Wireless Headphones 9928349_sd More Read More Now that the iPhone has gone headphone jack-less, you’re more in need of wireless headphones than ever.

The fine-tuned acoustics offer clear audio.\n$200 on Best Buy\n10-Foot Lightning cable 3-pack MFi-Certified Lightning Cable More Lightning cables are a must-have item for any Apple household.

More >> \nA California mother of six could end up in jail for up to a year for selling homemade food on Facebook. The details surrounding Marina Ruelas' arrest, and that of her fellow social sellers, is even more fascinating than her crime. \nBy Christian de Looper \nProvided by \nApple may be all about diversity on the surface, but the numbers show that the company hasn’t made strides in becoming more diverse over the last year — its leadership is still overwhelmingly comprised of white men. \nApple has released new data showing that the company’s high-ranking employees are made up of a higher percentage of white men than the rest of the company. Only 20 of Apple’s 107 executives are women, and only 5 of those executives are members of a minority group. Those numbers are pretty much unchanged from a year ago. \nMore: Microsoft to begin rewarding executives for diversity hiring \nOne layer down, things get a little better — but not by much. While women made up 27 percent of management, 65 percent of those managers are white, 23 percent Asian, and 11 percent from other minority groups. This data comes from a form called the EEO-1, which companies must file with the U.S. Equal Emplo yment Opportunity Commission. \nApple, along with a number of other companies, has pledged to boost diversity, and has said in the past that increased diversity isn’t just good for society, but also makes sense from a business perspective. While these numbers aren’t that great, Apple says that the data on them does not reflect how the company breaks down its workforce internally, nor how it measures its diversity. \nApple does seem to be moving in the right direction, even if its changes are small — the company’s new hires were 37 percent women and 27 percent underrepresented minorities. Microsoft, on the other hand, seems to be moving in the wrong direction — the company’s latest reports showed that the number of women at Microsoft has declined for the second year in a row. Microsoft blames layoffs in its phone division. \nThis article was originally posted on Digital Trends Content provided by INFORMATIONAL DISCLAIMER The information contained on or provided through this site is intended for general consumer understanding and education only and is not intended to be and is not a substitute for professional financial or accounting advice.

      "text": "Learn More \nIt’s expensive being an Apple fanboy. Not only do you typically pay a premium for Cupertino’s latest hardware, but Apple’s accessories can often also cause sticker shock.

Some of these are on our DT Shop, and others are on Best Buy, MacMall, Amazon, or Newegg. We will add to these over time and swap out deals.

      "text": "Two years ago, Oppo and Vivo couldn’t crack the top five in China’s smartphone market. Now they’re on top after elbowing Apple aside, thanks to people like Cheng Xiaoning.\nCheng runs a thriving electronics store in the rural town of Miaoxia, tapping in to her WeChat social-media account to promote the brands that pay the biggest commission, and in her case that’s Oppo and Vivo. While such payments start at about 40 yuan ($6), they escalate for more expensive handsets and reach almost 200 yuan for Oppo’s high-end smartphones.\n“That’s why I like to introduce the Oppo R9 Plus to potential customers,” she said. “Business has been perfect, actually never been better.”\nCheng and tens of thousands of like-minded boosters form the vanguard of the pair’s charge against Apple and Samsung Electronics Working with the local stores that dominate sales in China’s far-flung provinces, Oppo and Vivo came out of nowhere to upend the industry order and squeeze out former local darling Xiaomi. Their labels graced one out of every three smartphones sold within China in the third quarter, while the ­iPhone’s market share at 7 percent stood at its lowest in almost three years.\n  Oppo and Vivo trace their origins to reclusive billionaire Duan Yong Ping and employ similar strategies. That includes harnessing the spending power of rural customers away from top-tier cities such as Beijing and Shanghai. It’s where Apple’s vulnerable, given the­ ­iPhone’s lofty price tag. They eschewed e-commerce to instead court the stores where three-quarters of smartphone sales take place. Apple has been more reluctant to relinquish the retail experience to local free-agents, who sometimes charge brands for in-store displays and posters.\n“Oppo and Vivo are willing to share their profit with local sales. The reward was an extremely active and loyal nationwide sales network,” said Jin Di, an IDC analyst based in Beijing. While they declined to detail their subsidy program, she estimates the two were the top spenders in the past year. “They’re doing something different — they do local marketing.”\nChina had for years driven Apple’s and Samsung’s growth. The U.S. company generated almost $59 billion of sales from the region in fiscal 2015, which was more than double the level just two years earlier. \nThen the country’s slowdown and regulatory tangles took their toll. Authorities intervened, blocking iTunes Movies and iBooks, ending a period of near-unimpeded growth in the country. \nBut perhaps most crucial was the ascendancy of cheaper but just-as-good local alternatives. Oppo and Vivo’s gains have come mainly at the expense of lower-tier names thus far, but if they climb further into the premium segment, the U.S. company will need an answer. Some think the 10th-anniversary iPhone due in 2017 could deliver.\n“Apple needs to offer something cutting-edge to appeal to maturing Chinese smartphone users,” Counterpoint Research director Neil Shah writes. Oppo and Vivo can use the time until then to cement their positions, he said.\nTogether Oppo and Vivo shipped about 40 million smartphones in the third quarter, about 34 percent of devices sold in the world’s biggest market, according to IDC.\nSamsung declined to comment for this story, while Apple didn’t respond to requests for comment.\nThe man who’s clobbering Apple started out low on the tech spectrum. Duan made his fortune selling DVD players, telephones and game consoles similar to Nintendo’s. Bubugao Communication Equipment Co., the parent of Vivo, emerged from a restructuring in 1999 that split his company. The billionaire later teamed with longtime colleague Tony Chen and others to found what came to be known as Guangdong Oppo Electronics Co.\nOppo’s first smartphone came in 2011, when it unveiled a device with a BlackBerry-like keyboard. The same year, Bubugao created the business that would become Vivo. \nWhile Xiaomi shot to international prominence with flash online promotions, that success has been concentrated in densely packed cities. That doesn’t work so well in the countryside. By cultivating a physical network, Oppo and Vivo are building a platform difficult to replicate in the short run. \nApple, in contrast, has fewer than 40 stores across the country, most of which are in large cities. While its retail network is lauded for helping weave an aura of exclusivity and chic around its higher-priced gadgets, Chinese consumers value access to someone local. For now, neither Oppo nor Vivo appear overly concerned with the world’s most valuable company. \n“We have to keep our minds clear in the fast-changing market,” said Allen Wu, Oppo’s vice-president in charge of sales.All we need to do is to keep our heads down and make the correct moves.”\nSeattle Times staff Email Newsletter Sign-up Custom-curated news highlights, delivered weekday  ",

Meanwhile, if you go to the top charts free section, Modi app on top of all the apps. \nOn Google Play too, the Modi app is one of the most popular apps. \nAs opposition escalated its attack over demonetisation, Prime Minister Narendra Modi early week reached out to people directly for feedback by asking the public to convey their views to him via his App by answering a set of questions. \nMore than 93 percent of the five lakh people who participated in a survey on Narendra Modi App have supported demonetisation. \nMore than 93 percent people support the move to demonetize the old 500 and 1000 rupee notes, it said. Of the over 5 lakh responses so far, only 2 per cent have rated the move as 'very poor' or 'one star', the survey result said. \nMore than 90 percent of the respondents feel the government's move to tackle black money is above four-star rating, the survey result says. 73 percent of them give it five-star rating of 'brilliant'. \nOn the overall fight against corruption, more than 92 percent of respondents either rate the government as 'very good' or 'good' while 57 percent of them rate the fight as 'very good'. \nPM Modi has thanked the people for taking this survey. He tweeted: I thank people for the historic participation in the survey. Its satisfying to read the insightful views & comments. https://t.co/xf14LEiQHT pic.twitter.com/cGSBPlCnE5 \n— Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) November 23, 2016 \n\"As high as 86 percent people believe that some so- called anti-corruption activists are now actually batting in support of black money, corruption and even terrorist financing!\", the write-up said.

      "text": "Sources inside Apple has indicated that Jony Ive is still very much in control of product design at Apple. No details of actual projects he is involved in have been made available. ( Kimberly White | Getty Images ) Advertisement \nJony Ive, Apple's chief design officer, is said to be still very much in the loop amid rumors that his storied career at Apple is nearing its end. That is according to Daring Fireball blogger John Gruber. The Exit Is Not True \nGruber, who is considered by some as the dean of Apple bloggers, is largely credited for the recent speculations after his controversial comment at Jason Snell's The Talk Show podcast. \n\"I've heard that he has lately been checked out or not as directly involved with product design and that he's been largely focused on architecture, meaning the spaceship campus and the new stores,\" Gruber said . \nNow, it appears that Apple has taken notice of the minor controversy preoccupying the tech world. Some sources within the company seemed to have reached out to Gruber to clarify that there is no truth to the rumored Ive exit and that the designer is still very much involved in designing Apple products such as the iPhone . \n\"Every aspect of every new product remains as much under his watchful eye as ever,\" Gruber said in a blog update. \"That his chief design officer title isn't the least bit ceremonial, and instead is an accurate representation of his increased authority.\" All About Ive's Swan Song \nOne can say that it sounds more of a statement to reassure Ive as much as the Apple fans. To provide some context in this respect, Gruber has previously pointed out that there are sources who believe that Ive is on the way out and that his promotion is largely for show. \nWith his elevation to the chief design officer title, the positions that are really involved in design at Apple were taken over by two key officials. These are Alan Dye and Richard Howarth, who both directly report to Tim Cook . \nGruber has referred to the skeptics' take that there is really nothing much left to do for Ive so his position is almost ceremonial. \nIve has maintained his silence on the issue and so has Apple. Except for the anonymous inside sources cited by Gruber, the company maintained no official position so far. \nFor those wanting more insights into this Ive business, there are other information available so you can draw your own conclusions. For example, Ive recently designed a Christmas tree for Claridge several months after he commented that it is part of his bucket list if he is no longer designing at Apple. There is also the \"Designed by Apple in California\" book release, which some are considering a tribute to Ive but could also serve as his swan song.  ",

      "title": "New report details the crazy next-gen camera supposedly coming to Apple's iPhone 8 - BGR",
      "text": "Shop ▾ Image Source: Aflo/REX/Shutterstock \nApple’s iPhone 8 is going to offer buyers mostly the same camera setup as the current iPhone 7 family, according to rumors so far. That means the 4.7-inch model will have a single-lens rear camera, while the 5.5-inch Plus and the OLED iPhone 8 will both have cameras featuring two lenses. But a new report from Korea says that Apple is now working with LG on a new kind of camera for the iPhone 8, and it could be a game changer. \nDEAL ALERT: The best Black Friday sale of the year is happening right now! \nAccording to ETNews , Apple and LG Innotek “united forces” to develop a camera module that will support 3D photography. The next-gen 3D camera will combine LG Innotek’s technology with Apple’s own dual camera tech based on its LinX acquisition. \n“Apple is now studying how to apply its 3D camera technology into LG Innotek’s smartphone camera,” sources supposedly familiar with the matter said. “Since LG Innotek also has its own 3D camera and related technologies, such joint efforts will likely to bear fruit sometime within next year.” \nThe report notes that LG Innotek is currently the exclusive supplier of the iPhone 7 Plus’s dual lens camera. It also highlights the fact that LG Innotek has its own 3D camera technology which it used for the LG Optimus 3D smartphone back in 2011. That sounds a bit disconcerting, considering that LG hasn’t released any phones with 3D cameras since then. \nOn the other hand, Apple is only expected to build on its dual-camera hardware going forward. 3D photography and video, as well as AR and VR features are among the possible camera innovations that Apple may be toying with for next year’s iPhone.

      "title": "IPad Pro, iPad Air 2 And Kindle Fire Black Friday Deals With Up To $150 Sales Revealed",
      "text": "Black Friday SALES on Apple iPads, Bluetooth Keyboard iPad Cases and Kindle Fire Cases announced by Tablet XRay\nChicago, IL, USA – November 24, 2016 /MarketersMedia/ —\nThere are several generations of Apple iPads in the market and all of them have received price cuts this Black Friday 2016. Both, the 9.7” and 12.9” versions of the iPad Pro are on sale. Some deals are available only online, while others are available both in-store and online.\nThis list of up to $150 off Apple iPad and Kindle Fire Black Friday DEALS summarizes some of the best Amazon Kindle and Apple iPad-related deals available this Black Friday. Some of them are already live, some will start on Thanksgiving Day, and others will be exclusively available on Black Friday.\nGo to http://TabletXRay.com/Holiday-Deals to learn about all the sales offered on different stores like Target, Staples, Best Buy, and Amazon.\nOne of the major dilemmas iPad deal hunters face this year is whether to go with an iPad Pro or iPad Air 2. They have their similarities, but they also have a few major differences. “In spite of these differences, for most shoppers this year, spending the extra $100 – $200 on a 9.7” iPad Pro cannot be justified given how good the iPad Air 2 already is” explains Chase Pray, a spokesperson for Tablet XRay. The iPad Pro comes with an A9X processor which is more powerful than the A8X of the iPad Air 2. However, both of them have the same super high-resolution 2048 X 1536, 264 PPI HD display.\n“There are 3 major strengths of iPad Pro compared to the iPad Air 2; the iPad Pro (1) supports the Apple Pencil, (2) has up to 256GB of internal storage, and (3) offers 4K video shooting. These are all great features, however, not many tablet users will ever use these. This is why the Apple iPad Air 2 may be the better option for most tablet shoppers this Black Friday” elaborates Pray.\nTablet XRay also goes on to list multiple models of iPad cases with and without Wireless Bluetooth keyboards whose prices have been slashed by up to 70% this November 25th, 2016. While some of the more expensive smart iPad covers are made with 100% genuine leather, aluminum-made and plastic smart covers are also on sale this Black Friday sales week.\n“The Amazon Kindle Fire range of tablets are much cheaper than Apple iPads this year” exclaims Pray. “While the 12.9” iPad Pro can cost nearly $1000, the entry-level 7 inch Kindle Fire will be cheaper than $35. That is a huge difference that will make a huge difference in shoppers’ buying behaviors this holiday season. Almost every model of the Kindle Ereader range are also on sale this year. The Kindle reader, the Kindle Paperwhite and the Kindle Voyage E-reader, all have received handsome price cuts. The only model that is not currently on sale is the high-end eReader, the Kindle Oasis” concludes Pray.\nFor more information, please visit http://TabletXRay.com/\nContact Info:\nName: Chase Pray\nOrganization: Tablet XRay\nSource: http://marketersmedia.com/ipad-pro-ipad-air-2-and-kindle-fire-black-friday-deals-with-up-to-150-sales-revealed/149226\nRelease ID: 149226\n ",

      "text": "During the campaign, President-elect Donald Trump complained that the US had lost too many manufacturing jobs and promised to force big companies like Apple to bring that work home. “I’m going to get Apple to start making their computers and their iPhones on our land, not in China,” he said.\nFor a host of reasons, Apple is unlikely to produce iPhones in the US. But opening a smartphone factory in the US is not the only way to provide solid employment for working-class Americans who lack college degrees.\nApple’s overall contribution to the US economy is significant. Beyond the 80,000 people it directly employs in the US, it says 69 supplier facilities in 33 states manufacture parts that go into its products. Hundreds of thousands of software developers also write apps for iPhones and iPads.\nApple’s rapid growth in central Texas, where it employs about 6,000 people, up from 2,100 seven years ago, provides a window into the vast constellation of jobs at the world’s largest technology company and their economic impact. At the sparkling new complex in northwest Austin, workers who are spread throughout seven limestone-and-glass buildings field about 8,000 customer tech-support calls a day, manage the company’s vast network of suppliers and figure out how to move around millions of iPhones a week to ensure they get into the hands of customers when they want them.\nEmployees help run Apple’s iTunes music and app stores, handle the billions of dollars going in and out of the company’s US operations and continuously update the Maps software that is integral to iPhones and iPads. At another Austin location, about 500 engineers work on the chips that will run the next round of Apple’s products. \nThe Austin campus — the company’s largest outside its headquarters in Cupertino, California — offers plenty of perks, too. When employees are not working, they can lounge on chairs shaded from the Texas sun, dine at a two-storey cafeteria that serves an abundance of food, including barbecued ribs and banana-bread gelato, and visit a full-service medical clinic, which includes dentists, acupuncturists and a robot-assisted pharmacy.\nAlthough contractors at the Austin technical support call centre earn as little as $14.50 an hour, equivalent to about $30,000 a year, many of them become permanent staff members, which means better pay, after the typical one-year contract is up. Experienced call centre employees earn around $45,000 a year, plus generous benefits and small annual stock grants.\nPay is even higher for more senior advisers and managers. Apple says that, excluding benefits and stock compensation, the average salary of its Austin employees, including management, is $77,000 a year.\n“Apple has created over two million jobs in the US since the introduction of the iPhone nine years ago, including explosive growth in iOS developers, thousands of new supplier and manufacturing partners, and a 400 per cent increase in our employee teams,” the company said in a statement. “We made the unique decision to keep and expand our contact centers for customers in the Americas in the US, and Austin is home to many of those employees. We plan to continue to invest and grow across the US.”\nGenny Lopez, who went to college for two years and used to work as a bartender, joined Apple as a contractor handling tech support calls. She is now on staff, troubleshooting difficult customer problems. “You don’t need a crazy technical background to do this job,” Lopez said. “A lot of the training is getting really good at talking to people.”\nApple prides itself on providing top-notch phone service in 26 languages — 12 are spoken at the Texas call centre alone — and the people who handle the calls are expected to follow up on any problem that cannot be quickly resolved. During the recent visit, Stephanie Dumareille, a senior adviser on iOS issues who is fluent in English and Spanish, patiently answered questions from a customer who was worried about saving her resume online and did not know whether she was using a Windows or a Mac computer. \nEmployees say that Apple encourages them to move within and across teams, and the company is instituting a formal programme to allow workers to try a completely different role for six months to see it if suits them and the company. Brisa Carillo, who started out in the call centre fresh out of college five years ago, now handles international payroll matters and is studying for her MBA so she can move up the ranks of the finance department within Apple.\nThe region’s economy has deep roots in technology and is home to a number of big tech employers, most notably Dell. Apple’s influence in the area extends beyond the people on its direct payroll. It has 350 suppliers in Texas alone.\nAnd about 3,400 construction workers helped build the Austin campus. Apple ensured that they all got paid at least $12 an hour. It also provided workers’ compensation insurance and safety training, and it allowed the monitoring of conditions by an outside labour group, the Workers Defense Project, which has been trying to improve safety and pay in Texas construction.\n“There is a high road, and Apple followed that path,” said Bo Delp, director of the Better Builder programme at the Workers Defense Project. “It sent a pretty strong message to others in Austin.” \nA mile from its Austin campus, Apple is involved in manufacturing, through Flex, a global contract manufacturer. Flex assembles Apple’s Mac Pro desktop computers to meet the exact requirements of customers, who can choose among more than 4,000 combinations of features and hardware.\nFlex added about 2,000 jobs for the Apple project. Although Apple and Flex declined to discuss details of their arrangement, the assembly jobs start at $11 an hour and pay an average of about $30,000 a year, according to testimony by Flex officials in 2014, when they sought government aid for the expansion.\nApple could in theory build more products in the US through contractors like Flex. But the company and industrial experts say that would be very difficult and could easily add $100 to the final cost of an iPhone.\nChina has built a whole ecosystem of suppliers for nearly every electronic part imaginable. Vast pools of trained labour make it easy to quickly scale production up or down to meet demand.\nLarger products, or ones that require more customising, such as PCs, make more sense to build close to the final customer.\n“It’s easy to ship a phone, and it’s harder to ship a computer,” said Andy Tsay, a professor at Santa Clara University who has studied global manufacturing patterns. “And it’s harder still for cars and refrigerators.” \nOver time, the value of Apple’s business is shifting away from hardware like the iPhone and into software such as apps and services like Apple Music, Tsay said. And those jobs can be much better for workers. “There are fewer industrial accidents working in a call centre,” he said. “There is probably more gender equity. And it’s probably better for customers, too.”\nAlan Marquis, a former Army officer who spent a couple of years streamlining processes on a manufacturer’s assembly line before joining Apple, now manages part of the complex software that integrates Apple’s suppliers into the company’s production systems. “Here, there’s a lot more openness and creativity,” he said. “In manufacturing, it’s a lot more widgets dropping off the line.”\nMayor Steve Adler of Austin, a Democrat, does not sweat the details of the jobs companies create in his city. He is more concerned that the work pays enough — at least $20 an hour — to support the city’s middle-class, which is being squeezed by rising home prices.\nSome of the new jobs, like those at the Austin chip factory owned by Samsung, Apple’s biggest rival in the smartphone business, will be in manufacturing. Others, like the ones Apple brings, will be in services.\n“The best kind of jobs are those that allow someone to continue to grow and climb the ladder,” Adler said.\nAsked about Apple’s lack of manufacturing in the US, Lopez said: “The product that Apple builds here is us.” \nNew York Times News Service",

      "text": "0 Apple's new iPhone 7 Plus is displayed after the new iPhone 7 Plus went on sale at the Apple Store at Tokyo's Omotesando shopping district, Japan, September 16, 2016. Reuters/Issei Kato \nLatest reports suggest that the upcoming Apple iPhone 8 will have a 3D camera and that the Cupertino tech giant could be partnering with LG for the high-end cameras. Apple has already worked with LG Innotek for the iPhone 7 Plus dual digital camera. It is likely that two of the three iPhone 8 variants will have the rear-facing twin camera setup. \nApple may already be working with LG Innotek to enable 3D photographing in Apple iPhone 8 2017. The handset may have added bokeh effects, new portrait mode, 3D features and depth-of-field upgrades. \nAs per iPhone Hack s , The Korea Economic Daily published an article this week wherein internal sources revealed that Apple is currently analysing how to apply its own 3D camera tech into LG Innotek’s smartphone camera. As LG Innotek also has its own 3D camera, the integration of technologies of both companies will likely bear fruit in 2017. \nHowever, it’s too early to get excited about capturing 3D photos in Apple iPhone 8. However, Apple may use LG Innotek’s 3D camera module for enhancing the Portrait Mode in iOS 10. As per reports, Apple is planning a complete redesign of its iPhone in 2017. The iPhone 8 could have an all-glass body, OLED Display and Touch ID fingerprint sensor. \nThe Apple iPhone 8 will most-definitely feature wireless charging technology. A concept video of the iPhone 8 with all the anticipated specs can be viewed here . As Apple hardly teases specs and features of its upcoming products, fans have to rely on leaked specs and rumours to keep themselves updated. \nOne such crazy rumour suggests that Apple could be taking cues from 90s Motorola phobes to make the iPhone 8 foldable. The upcoming Apple iPhone 8 could be a flip phone. The handset is expected to release in the latter half of 2017.",

      "text": "0 Apple CEO Tim Cook speaks under a graphic of the new MacBook Pro during an Apple media event in Cupertino, California, U.S. October 27, 2016. Reuters/Beck Diefenbach \nApple’s new baby, the MacBook Pro 2016, is sure to impress its fans. The 13-inch basic MacBook Pro is a beautiful-looking device, in its space gray or silver colours. It’s lightweight, slim and sturdy. Its build gives a feel that it would replace the MacBook Air for portability. The entry-level device does not have the Touch Bar or the Touch ID fingerprint sensor. \nThe other new 13-inch or 15-inch models do have the Touch Bar though. The basic MacBook Pro 13-inch has two USB-C Thunderbolt 3 ports. These are expected to become the new industry standard. Uploading photos and videos will be a breeze as these ports allow data transfer speeds of up to 40 billion bits per second, reports Brisbane Times . \nCharging is also done via these ports though the MagSafe connector is missing. Apple has included a larger touchpad for more gesture-based commands. The Retina Display screen has high contrast, making images sharper and colours brighter. The 13-inch MacBook Pro 2016 has some awesome speakers that produce some very high-quality sound. \nThe speakers deliver enough bass and the sound is powerful and clear. People who want a small Apple laptop can very well go for this 13-inch MacBook Pro 2016 basic model. It costs $2,199. According to TIME , even though the newly-introduced Touch Bar is an intriguing concept, it’s occasionally helpful. Hence, many may not find justifiable to spend an extra $300 on the Touch Bar. \nTech enthusiasts have praised the Apple MacBook Pro 2016 13-inch basic version’s balance of power and portability. The flatter, larger keys with less travel distance are a pleasure to use. Users however need to carry more converter cables for USB sticks and other devices. At 1.37 kg, the MacBook Pro 2016 13-inch basic model could be one’s perfect travel companion. \nStay tuned on IBT AU for more updates on Apple MacBook Pro 2016 models.",

      "text": "Published: 4:00   \nDUBLIN — “An Apple a day keeps the bank man away — stop objecting!” \nSo read the handwritten sign in Athenry, the tiny village close to Ireland’s Atlantic coast chosen by Apple for a vast US$1 billion (S$1.43 billion) data facility. The message was for three people contesting the potential environmental impact and economic benefits from locals worried the company might scrap the project because of more than a year of delays. Meanwhile, the forestry site remains untouched before a judge hears another round of arguments in March. \n“This doesn’t just affect Athenry, it affects Ireland as well,” said Mr Paul Keane, 39, whose family has lived in the area for generations. “If Apple is turned away, what does it say about Ireland? It’s right that we have a fair and open system, but it can’t be dragged out.” \nWhat would be one of the most high-profile European investments for Apple is an even bigger deal for Ireland in what has turned out to be a torrid year. \nBritain’s vote to leave the European Union has threatened to upend arrangements with one of its largest trading partners, while Mr Donald Trump’s election win might undermine Ireland’s status as a haven for American firms in Europe. That was already in question after the EU ordered Apple to pay €13 billion (S$19.6 billion) relating to its Irish tax arrangements. Both the company and the government are appealing. \nFor some, Athenry illustrates a deeper issue: The difficulty of executing large infrastructure developments in Ireland compared with other countries regardless of how attractive the tax regime might be. Apple has already broken ground on a similar project in Denmark that chief executive officer Tim Cook announced simultaneously more than 18 months ago. \nAt that point, Mr Cook expected the Irish data centre to start operations next year. Now, it is unlikely the project will be completed before March 2019 at the earliest based on the timeline the company laid out at planning hearings. When asked about the delays, Apple pointed to Mr Cook’s comment in September following the EU tax decision that the company remains “committed to Ireland”. \nThe data centre in the Derrydonnell forest is due to cover 166,000 sqm, the equivalent of about 23 football fields on completion. When Mr Cook announced his plan, it was welcomed in a region that had become a byword for economic gloom, immortalised in a folk ballad in the mid-19th century. \nQuickly, the project became bogged down in planning objections. Last week, a Dublin court agreed to fast-track a second legal challenge to the planning approval, though that still means the case will not be heard for another four months. While the court probably will not block the centre altogether, it could send the project back into the planning process if it finds flaws in the earlier procedure. \nTwo of the objectors making the court challenges, Mr Allan Daly and Mr Brian McDonagh, declined to comment, while a third, Ms Sinead Fitzpatrick, did not respond to calls to her office seeking comment. A flavour of their objections can be found in the submission by the Concerned Residents of Lisheenkyle made during the planning process. That includes concerns that the development may hurt the biodiversity of the wood, the lack of services linked to it and the limited employment associated with data centres. \nLocal supporters fear Apple may grow impatient, prompting community leaders to organise a rally in favour of the project earlier this month. Organisers say a couple of thousand people showed up, including children carrying signs emblazoned with “’Athenry for Apple” and “Athenry says Yes”. \n“It was a gesture of solidarity with Apple, to show that the vast majority of people in the area support the project,” said Mr Peter Feeney, a local councillor with Prime Minister Enda Kenny’s Fine Gael party. “There are only a few opponents. People are beginning to get fed up. This project means an awful lot to the area.” BLOOMBERG",

      "text": "Apple's Black Friday Deals Go Live With Gift Cards; Microsoft Store offering Discount deals on Products Xbox One S available at $249 as part of sale Apple's gift card deals do not include iPhone 7 and 7 Plus Apple's deals include 13-inch MacBook Pro 2016 model without Touch Bar \nThe Black Friday deals have already started pouring out and all the major companies seem to have pulled their socks up in order to provide tough competition to local retailers. In order to celebrate the occasion, Apple is offering gift cards for specified product purchases while Microsoft has now started offering discounted deals on its products on the Microsoft Store. \nEarlier this week, a dedicated webpage on the Apple's website teased a one-day shopping event on November 25 on account of Black Friday. Even though the company doesn't have a reputation of offering big discounted deals, the teaser raised hopes that it might offer something special this year. However, as it turns out, Apple is still offering gift cards for specified product purchases as part of its Black Friday celebration. It should be noted that company's recent products are not a part of this deal. Apple's Black Friday deals are reportedly live in just New Zealand and Australia for, but the listings confirm the approximate discount that can be expected in other regions in including US. The gift cards range from AUD 35 (roughly Rs. 1,800) to AUD 200 (roughly Rs. 10,200). The deals notably exclude iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus , Apple Watch Series 2, and the Touch Bar models of MacBook Pro 2016. However, the deals do cover the 13-inch model of MacBook Pro 2016 without the Touch Bar.\nOn the other hand, Microsoft is now offering some of its premium products at discounted prices as part of its Black Friday sale on the Microsoft Store. The Redmond-based company is now offering its Surface Pro 4 variant with Intel Core i5 processor and 8GB of RAM with 256GB SSD for $999 (roughly Rs. 68,400), which is $430 (roughly Rs. 29,400) less than its usual price. \nFurther, the company is offering the Surface Book model with Core i5 processor and 8GB RAM with 256GB SSD at $1,499 (roughly Rs. 1. 02 lakhs) compared with its usual price tag of $1,899 (roughly Rs. 1.3 lakhs). The Microsoft Store also lists the Dell Inspiron 15 i5559 Signature Edition at $399 (roughly Rs. 27,300), which is $350 (roughly Rs. 23,950) less than its standard price. \nThe Microsoft Store has also slashed the price of Alienware 15 Touch Signature Edition gaming laptop to $1,497 (roughly Rs. 1.02 lakhs) from its retail price of $2,499 (roughly Rs. 1.7 lakhs) as part of its sale. Microsoft is also offering its gaming console Xbox One S at a discount of $50 (roughly Rs. 3,400) for $249 (roughly Rs. 17,000) as part of its Black Friday sale. The company is also giving away a gift code worth $25 (roughly Rs. 1,700) and a select game as part of this deal.",

      "text": "Apple iPhones and other hand-held devices have long had an airplane mode that shuts off wireless communications to prevent interference with the vast electronics systems that control modern aircraft.\nNow, federal auto safety regulators in the United States want makers of these devices to add a driver mode to modify or block certain apps and features to keep a driver's attention on the road.\nThe initiative comes in the form of voluntary guidelines issued Wednesday by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. They arrive amid a spike in traffic fatalities in the last two years and increasing concerns about the distractions posed by smartphones and the many apps that people are using while behind the wheel.\n\"Your smartphone becomes so many different things that it's not just a communication device,\" Anthony Foxx, secretary of the Transportation Department, said in an interview. \"Distraction is still a problem. Too many people are dying and being injured on our roadways.\"\nThe guidelines call on electronics manufacturers like Apple and Samsung to design future operating systems that limit the functionality and simplify interfaces while a vehicle is in motion and to develop technology to identify when the devices are being used by a driver while driving. That would ensure the limits are placed on drivers and not other vehicle occupants.\nThe new guidelines from NHTSA are the agency's first recommendations specifically for portable devices that are used while driving. The agency cannot force electronics companies to comply, but in the past it issued a set of guidelines for the navigation and entertainment systems built into cars by the manufacturer and carmakers adopted them, for the most part.\nThe airplane mode has been around about as long as smartphones. The Federal Aviation Administration had required turning off electronics before takeoff, but that rule was relaxed to allow the use of smartphones in flight as long as they had their communications shut off. That led to airplane mode, which the iPhone had in 2007.\n\"Unfortunately, there are varying degrees of recognition in the tech community that when you're building an app or a smartphone, or contemplating usage, there's a strong possibility that someone could be trying to use that in the driver's seat,\" Foxx said.\nIn the first six months of 2016, highway deaths in the U.S. increased 10.4 per cent, to 17,775, according to preliminary data compiled by NHTSA. At that rate, more than 100 people die every day in traffic accidents. In 2015, traffic fatalities rose 7.1 per cent; it was the largest annual percentage increase in traffic deaths in 50 years.\nPart of the increase in road deaths can be explained by the improving economy, higher employment numbers and low gasoline prices, all of which are causing Americans to drive more than they did just a few years ago, during the depths of the recession.\nIn an interview in October, Mark Rosekind, the NHTSA administrator, said the increase in miles travelled was not enough by itself to explain this spike in crashes, injuries and deaths. Indeed, fatalities are occurring more frequently even when the increased travel is factored in.\nRosekind and other safety experts think one factor is distracted driving. In their view, distractions and the allure of smartphones, other devices and in-car electronics have multiplied greatly since the dangers of distracted driving entered the national consciousness years ago.\nAt that time, the main phone-related distracting activities were texting and talking on the phone. Now a wide range of apps and games also tempt drivers to reach for their phones.\nMakers of smartphones have added some technology that can be used to reduce the distraction of electronics. Apple's iPhones have a do-not-disturb feature that can block incoming calls and texts, and a silent mode that eliminates the chimes and other audio cues that signal the arrival of a new message or posting on Facebook.\nMany carmakers now include Apple's CarPlay software in their newest models. When an iPhone is connected to the vehicle via CarPlay, the software limits the apps drivers can use to Apple Maps, the music service Pandora and others that are used while travelling. Drivers can have the system read new texts aloud and dictate responses.\nThere are apps and other products that can be used to block incoming communications in cars. One called DriveSafe Mode lets parents monitor if a child's phone is used for texting or email while in a vehicle.\nThe guidelines encourage smartphone makers to ensure their devices pair up with in-car electronics so drivers can use their steering-wheel buttons and in-dash screen to control apps.\nA driver mode would present a simplified interface and detect when the device is being used by a driver. In this mode, a smartphone would block any video or distracting graphics; eliminate scrolling text; and prohibit keypad use for texting or email. Any social media content or content from web pages like news reports should be blocked as well, the guidelines say.\nNew York Times",

      "text": "Two years ago, Oppo and Vivo couldn't crack the top five in China's smartphone market. Now they outrank everyone after elbowing Apple aside, thanks to people like Cheng Xiaoning.\nCheng runs a thriving electronics store in the rural town of Miaoxia, tapping into her WeChat social media account to promote the brands that pay the biggest commission, and in her case that's Oppo and Vivo. While such payments start at about 40 yuan ($6), they escalate for more expensive handsets and reach almost 200 yuan for Oppo's high-end smartphones.\n\"That's why I like to introduce the Oppo R9 Plus to potential customers,\" she said. \"Business has been perfect, actually never been better.\"\nCheng and tens of thousands of like-minded boosters form the vanguard of the pair's charge against Apple and Samsung. Working with the local stores that dominate sales in China's far-flung provinces, Oppo and Vivo came out of nowhere to upend the industry order and squeeze out former local darling Xiaomi. Their labels graced one out of every three smartphones sold within China in the third quarter, while the iPhone's market share at seven per cent stood at its lowest in almost three years.\nOppo and Vivo trace their origins to reclusive billionaire Duan Yong Ping and employ similar strategies. That includes harnessing the spending power of rural customers away from top-tier cities such as Beijing and Shanghai. It's where Apple is vulnerable given the iPhone's lofty price tag. They eschewed e-commerce to instead court the stores where three-quarters of smartphone sales take place. Apple has been more reluctant to relinquish the retail experience to local free-agents, who sometimes charge brands for in-store displays and posters.\n\"Oppo and Vivo are willing to share their profit with local sales. The reward was an extremely active and loyal nationwide sales network,\" said Jin Di, an IDC analyst based in Beijing. While they declined to detail their subsidy program, she estimates the two were the top spenders in the past year. \"They're doing something different — they do local marketing.\"\nChina had for years driven Apple's and Samsung's growth. The U.S. company generated almost $59 billion of sales from the region in fiscal 2015, which was more than double the level just two years earlier. At its peak, Greater China yielded almost 30 per cent of its revenue and Apple was neck-and-neck with Xiaomi for the mantle of market leader as users clamoured for the larger iPhone 6 models. Even as the domestic economy began to sputter, CEO Tim Cook spent a good chunk of an earnings call last year talking up the country's promise, saying Apple's investing there \"for the decades ahead.\"\nThen the country's slowdown and regulatory tangles took their toll. Authorities intervened, blocking iTunes Movies and iBooks, ending a period of near-unimpeded growth in the country. But perhaps most crucial was the ascendancy of cheaper but just-as-good local alternatives. Oppo and Vivo's gains have come mainly at the expense of lower-tier names thus far, but if they climb further into the premium segment, the U.S. company will need an answer. \"\nApple needs to offer something cutting-edge to appeal to maturing Chinese smartphone users,\" Counterpoint Research director Neil Shah wrote. Oppo and Vivo can use the time until then to cement their positions, he said.\nTogether, Oppo and Vivo shipped about 40 million smartphones in the third quarter, about 34 per cent of devices sold in the world's biggest market, according to IDC. In 2012, their combined share was about 2.5 per cent. iPhone shipments plunged more than a third to 8.2 million during the period — less than half of Vivo's. Samsung, which once led the market, now settles for roughly five per cent, according to Counterpoint.\nAs Apple has faltered in China, Cook has stepped up his courtship of decision-makers. He visited the country several times this year, unveiled plans for research centres in Beijing and Shenzhen, and invested $1 billion in Uber rival Didi Chuxing. Cook said on his last earnings call he remains confident of a return to growth this quarter.\nIt's unclear how Apple can reclaim lost ground. Previous attempts to drift down-market — with the iPhone 5c and SE, for instance — fizzled as local users shunned seemingly inferior devices. Apple doesn't run a vibrant online social community for users the way some of its local rivals do. And competing on price will jeopardize the industry's fattest profit margins.\nOppo and Vivo pack high-end specs into a phone that sells for a fraction of its rival's in China, where iPhone 7s start at 5,388 (US$784).\n\"Both companies invested heavily in marketing,\" said Nicole Peng, Asia Pacific research director at consultancy Canalys. Oppo and Vivo have a strong grip on the middle market for phones from $200 to $500, she said. \"Their off-line channel strategy paid off.\"\nOppo's first smartphone came in 2011, when it unveiled a device with a BlackBerry-like keyboard. The same year, the business that would become Vivo was created.\nToday, Vivo touts its cameras and Oppo focuses on rapid-charging and battery life. But their off-line strategies remain the same: mobilizing tens of thousands of private shop owners. Oppo said it sells its products through roughly 240,000 privately owned stores as of June — six times the global count of McDonald's. Vivo manages about half that. Oppo, which doesn't disclose sales figures, said about 90 per cent of its phones were sold off-line.\nWhile Xiaomi shot to international prominence with flash online promotions, that success has been concentrated in densely packed cities. That doesn't work so well in the countryside, where novice buyers want advice and demonstrations. By cultivating a physical network, Oppo and Vivo are building a platform difficult to replicate in the short run.\nApple, in contrast, has fewer than 40 stores across the mainland, most of which are in large cities. Cook has said its iPhones are also sold through about 40,000 locations, though that includes stores controlled by wireless carriers and spots within nationwide electronics chains. While its retail network is lauded for helping weave an aura of exclusivity and chic around its higher-priced gadgets, Chinese consumers — particularly in smaller, poorer cities — value access to someone local who can work out kinks. That sort of after-sales support is in itself a powerful marketing tool, IDC's Jin said.\nFor now, neither Oppo nor Vivo appear overly concerned with the world's most valuable company. Their executives say they'll stick to their winning strategies, while exploring ways to keep pushing the smartphone envelope.\n\"We have to keep our minds clear in the fast-changing market,\" said Allen Wu, Oppo's vice-president in charge of sales. \"All we need to do is to keep our heads down and make the correct moves.\"\nTo Vivo, that means targeting younger users with higher-performance devices. \"Camera and music will be our key focuses in the future. We are seeing greater customer expectations out of these two areas,\" company vice-president Ni Xudong said.\nThat message resonates with the likes of Chen Siyu, an accountant who uses her Vivo phone at least four hours a day to chat with friends, watch videos and apply for jobs.\n\"I chose Vivo because of its design and photographing capability,\" said the 26-year-old who lives in the town of Pu'tian in Fujian. \"It is not expensive and doesn't slow down after longtime use like many Android phones do.\"",

      "text": "Donald Trump says he spoke to Apple CEO Tim Cook about making iPhones in US Donald Trump says he spoke to Apple CEO Tim Cook about making iPhones in US Donald Trump wasn't exactly an Apple fan in his campaign, but he has spoken to Apple CEO Tim Cook since the results. Updated: November 25, 2016 10:55 am US President-elect Donald Trump has spoken to Apple CEO Tim Cook about manufacturing iPhones in the US. \nUS President-elect Donald Trump wasn’t exactly an Apple fan during the course of his campaign, but he has spoken to Apple CEO Tim Cook since the results. Trump revealed this during the course of an interaction with the New York Times; the paper has put out a full transcript of the meeting with the President-elect. \nWhen the Apple vs FBI fight was unfolding, Donald Trump had tweeted against the Cupertino giant and called for a boycott of their products. Incidentally he had called for the boycott using an Apple iPhone. He had also spoken during the campaign about how he would get Apple to make their ‘damned computers’ in the US, instead of China. But things between Apple and Donald Trump are not so bad anymore, and CEO Tim Cook has called on him as well. \n“I got a call from Bill Gates, great call, we had a great conversation, I got a call from Tim Cook at Apple…” revealed Trump. According to the President elect, he told Apple CEO Tim Cook that he wants the company to build plants and products in the US. \nTrump’s exact quote reads: “ Tim, you know one of the things that will be a real achievement for me is when I get Apple to build a big plant in the United States, or many big plants in the United States, where instead of going to China, and going to Vietnam, and going to the places that you go to, you’re making your product right here. ” Trump revealed that Tim Cook said he understands that, and the President-elect has also spoken about incentives in the form of a very large tax cut for corporations. \n“ But we’re going for big tax cuts, we have to get rid of regulations, regulations are making it impossible. Whether you’re liberal or conservative, I mean I could sit down and show you regulations that anybody would agree are ridiculous. It’s gotten to be a free-for-all. And companies can’t, they can’t even start up, they can’t expand, they’re choking ,” said Trump. \nAlso read: iPhones could be manufactured in US as Apple considers idea: Report \nOf course for Apple to start manufacturing iPhones in US and not China will need more than just tax cuts. While reports claim that Apple is exploring the idea of manufacturing phones in the US, it won’t be so easy given that labour and the entire supply chain is now comfortably set in China and the South-East Asia region. For companies like Apple, China’s labour has the right skill set, and exporting all of that to the US can’t be done overnight or even in the next four years. \nA recent report by Nikkei Asian review claims Apple asked both Foxconn and Pegatron to look into the possibility of making iPhones in US in June. While Foxconn complied, Pegatron declined due to cost concerns. © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd Tags:",

      "text": "SEATTLE – With all eyes on “The Game” in Columbus this weekend, “The Other Game” that threatens to shake up the college football playoff picture kicks off Friday in the most remote outpost of the Pac-12 Conference.\nThe most consequential Apple Cup since 1981 is also the biggest game in the country this week not being played in Columbus.\nAnd if No. 23 Washington State upsets No. 5 Washington in Pullman, Wash., it assures a two-loss team makes the playoff field for the first time – possibly setting the stage for a scrum that could send a second, who-knows-who, two-loss team into the four-team field.\n“We’re just really excited to play for something that hasn’t been done in a long time,” Washington junior safety Budda Baker said of the first Apple Cup in 35 years with a conference title at stake for both teams.\nWashington safety Budda Baker, a preseason All-America, sacks Arizona State quarterback Manny Wilkins during UW's victory Saturday in Seattle.\nEven if it’s happening in the sizable shadow of Saturday’s Michigan-Ohio State game – not to mention the middle-of-nowhere Palouse.\n“We like that,” Baker said. “It’s cool to be in the spotlight and all that type of stuff. But we like to lay low, do our thing, and hopefully that all comes later.”\nThe Huskies have done an exceptional job of lying low in the more than two decades since they contended for national titles in Don James’ final three seasons (1990-92).\nUnder third-year coach Chris Petersen, this is Washington’s first 10-win season since 2000. They’ve had a winless season since their last conference title.\n“There’s some good ball played over here,” UW linebacker Keishawn Bierria said. “I don’t know if everybody’s tuning in for it. But I’ve got some fantastic teammates. If you don’t know about [receiver] John Ross yet, I don’t know where you’re at.”\nRoss owns three school kick return records, and his 15 receiving touchdowns this season are three short of the UW record.\n“Wazzu’s having a good year, but it all starts with us,” Washington receiver Chico McClatcher said. “We’re not really worried about if we’re overlooked or the best team in the country. We just want to play our best, and then they’ll say all that stuff after the season.\n“It was a hyped season for us at the beginning of the year, and we just have to prove it.”\n# College football Chico McClatcher seattle",

The details surrounding Marina Ruelas' arrest, and that of her fellow social sellers, is even more fascinating than her crime. \nBy Christian de Looper \nProvided by \nApple may be all about diversity on the surface, but the numbers show that the company hasn’t made strides in becoming more diverse over the last year — its leadership is still overwhelmingly comprised of white men. \nApple has released new data showing that the company’s high-ranking employees are made up of a higher percentage of white men than the rest of the company. Only 20 of Apple’s 107 executives are women, and only 5 of those executives are members of a minority group. Those numbers are pretty much unchanged from a year ago. \nMore: Microsoft to begin rewarding executives for diversity hiring \nOne layer down, things get a little better — but not by much. While women made up 27 percent of management, 65 percent of those managers are white, 23 percent Asian, and 11 percent from other minority groups. This data comes from a form called the EEO-1, which companies must file with the U.S. Equal Emplo yment Opportunity Commission. \nApple, along with a number of other companies, has pledged to boost diversity, and has said in the past that increased diversity isn’t just good for society, but also makes sense from a business perspective. While these numbers aren’t that great, Apple says that the data on them does not reflect how the company breaks down its workforce internally, nor how it measures its diversity. \nApple does seem to be moving in the right direction, even if its changes are small — the company’s new hires were 37 percent women and 27 percent underrepresented minorities. Microsoft, on the other hand, seems to be moving in the wrong direction — the company’s latest reports showed that the number of women at Microsoft has declined for the second year in a row.

      "text": "Allo is a Smart New Messaging App That Comes Packed With Google Assistant T he primary purpose of any computing platform is to get work done . Earlier, this was done by mainframes, then came PCs and they were then followed by smartphones. With the smartphone market facing just single-digit overall growth and with almost everyone in the developed countries owning smartphones, the hunt for the next computing platform is at an all-time high. There are many upcoming computing platforms but conversational computing platforms have been garnering quite some interest over time. A lot of major tech companies are invested in this. Conversational computing platforms and its origin \nAlthough, till date, most of the computing platforms have owed their existence to the US, conversational computing platforms might be something that would owe its existence to the east and China in particular. It wouldn’t be incorrect to say that China’s Tencent pioneered the concept of conversational computing platform through its WeChat application. The Chinese application is a world in itself and allows you to chat, send money, book rides and do a whole lot of other things from the app itself. All these things are facilitated by official accounts that users can follow and interact with to be notified about new offers or perform various interactions with a particular company. \nWeChat has been highly lucrative for Tencent, the average revenue per user on WeChat is pegged around $7 and WeChat is pegged to have around 800 million users according to Statista . Looking at the kind of success Tencent received with WeChat, American tech companies wanted to implement something similar as well. However, their approach differs and conversational computing platforms aren’t necessarily restricted to messaging alone. Types of Conversational Computing Platforms \nThere are two types of conversational computing platforms that are being worked upon right now. One of it relies on voice while the other one relies on text. The voice-based conversational computing platform is what companies like Amazon and Google are working upon with their products such as Amazon Echo and Google Home . On the other hand, companies such as Facebook and Apple are working on text-based conversational computing platforms with their products such as Messenger and iMessage. \nIt’s important to note that some companies are hedging their bets by having a presence in both text-based and voice-based conversational computing platforms. For example, while Google has Google Home as its voice-based platform, they also have Allo as their text-based platform. Similarly, while Apple has iMessage as its text-based platform, they also have AirPods and are rumored to be developing an Amazon Echo competitor which would act as their voice based conversational computing platform. The core \nThe core behind both text and voice conversational computing platforms is a smart assistant. For Google, it’s Google Assistant , for Amazon, it’s Alexa, for Apple, it’s Siri and for Facebook. it’s M. An AI-powered smart assistant is the backbone of every conversational computing platform that’s being created by major tech companies around the world. The AI-powered assistant acts as a butler, helping make sense of your words and carrying out your commands while trying to reply in the most human way possible. Now, I’ll try and analyze the various tech companies when it comes to conversational computing platforms – their strengths and weaknesses. Google \nGoogle has two forms of conversational computing platforms which they are trying to promote. One is Google Home and the second one is Allo. I personally feel that Google should try and focus all its efforts on Google Home. I have tried Google Allo and honestly it’s not a bad chat app. It has a few cool tricks up its sleeve and Google assistant has been pretty good so far. But chat apps require network effects to be successful and Google Allo lacks that. Very few people would be interested in using Google Allo if their friends are not using it. Sure, there’s going to be some initial excitement surrounding Allo but ultimately everyone would want to go back to their regular chat apps. Also considering that almost every country now has a dominant chat app, there’s no clear path for Allo to dominate. \nAlso Read: The only way Google Allo can Succeed is if it’s Everywhere \nAlthough Allo lacks the network effects, Google has a pretty impressive lead over its competitors when it comes to AI. This was very visible during my use with Allo when the app was able to suggest smart replies even when the conversation was happening in Hindi. Google’s lead in machine learning and AI is hardly matched by any other company as of now. Combine this with the vast amounts of data Google has about you thanks to the numerous searches you have made, email exchanges on Gmail, usage of maps, data from Android etc and Google’s bot can be smarter than most others out there, at least on paper. \nChat apps require network effects and as of now, it’s very difficult for a new chat app to try and gain users. The future and success for Google primarily lie in voice based conversational computing platforms. Voice based conversational computing platforms also require network effects. The network effects of voice based conversational computing platforms are very similar to that of the smartphone market. The smart AI can be the OS. For example, in case of Amazon, Alexa becomes the OS. The devs that develop use cases revolving the smart AI can make the apps. The apps are basically skills in case of Alexa. Then there is the terminal device/smartphone, which is Amazon Echo in the case of Amazon. \nNow whichever smart AI has a higher reach will attract more developers and whichever smart AI has more apps built around it will attract more users. Although Amazon Echo has had an early start, the voice based conversational computing market is far from saturated. By comparison, everyone has a smartphone that’s running either iOS or Android and every country has a chat app that’s now considered integral for communication. The voice based conversational computing platform market is nowhere near as saturated. \nIt is true that Amazon has had a lead with Amazon Echo but this lead can easily be broken. Google already has an excellent AI smart assistant in the form of Google Assistant, Google Home already makes use of that just like how Amazon Echo makes use of Amazon Alexa. \nAfter Google launched Google Home, they also released an SDK. Developers can tap into the Assistant SDK to make Actions for Google Home. Actions are basically what skills are on Echo. Facebook \nThe biggest benefit Facebook has in this war is obviously its user base. Facebook has two chat apps with a user base of 1 billion and above namely Messenger and Whatsapp. Although Whatsapp was destined to hit the 1 billion mark, Facebook’s decision to unbundle messaging from the core Facebook app did help a lot in Messenger’s growth. Starting in April this year, Facebook completely opened the floodgates for bots on Messenger. Facebook eventually plans to make Whatsapp a platform. It’s very clear here the Facebook is trying to take a page out of WeChat’s book. Just like how WeChat allows its users to perform a host of functions from right within the app, Facebook wants to enable the same on Messenger/WhatsApp. \nThere was a lot of enthusiasm in the beginning but as it turns out, the enthusiasm on paper didn’t really pan out in real life. Bots were riddled with bugs and had received largely negative reviews from the public. Most of the times, the bots simply weren’t able to comprehend and execute even the simplest of commands. This was made apparent when at this year’s TechCrunch Disrupt, David Marcus, head of Messenger at Facebook himself admitted that bots weren’t what they were hyped to be. Although Marcus said that the lack of quality in bots was down to the low preparation times developers had, the damage had been done; Facebook has added payments and web views but how far extra time and these extra features help in improving bots remains to be seen. \nSome people feel text-based conversational computing platforms might never take off in the US like they did in China because of the vast cultural differences between the two countries. There are many reasons why WeChat became successful in China. First of all, the Chinese directly leap frogged to mobile payments. It is literally possible to leave your wallet at your house and go out and make all sorts of payments for all sorts of services through your smartphone alone. This kind of ubiquity of mobile payments in China provided a solid base for apps like WeChat to be an all in one hub for all your needs. Secondly, apps in China are judged depending on the number of functionality they can provide whereas apps in Western countries are judged depending on how well the app can do that one function that the app claims to do. There are quite a few other reasons as well but the end point that matters is that bots on Messenger have had a bad first impression. \nWhile Facebook’s two chat apps are definitely a great moat, bots themselves have failed to make a great first impression. While bots haven’t lived up to the hype, voice based conversational computing products such as Amazon Echo has made a great first impression. Amazon Echo has sold close to 3 million units till date and almost everyone who has used has found it to be extremely useful. The conversational computing platform market as a whole is still at an early stage. Maybe both text and voice based conversational computing platforms might survive or maybe either or both of them might die. Anything can be possible, no one knows. \nBut if first impressions are any indication then people have definitely been more attracted towards stand-alone voice based computing platforms than text based. If the future entails voice as the winner then Facebook is in trouble as the company has no Amazon Echo or Google Home competitor and even Facebook M is still in testing. Apple \nApple, just like Google, has its presence in both the forms of conversational computing platforms i.e voice based as well as text. As far as text based is concerned, Apple has iMessage which it has opened up to a particular set of developers for building integrations. As far as voice is concerned, Apple has entered this arena in some form through AirPods and according to the reputable journalist, Mark Gurman, famous for his Apple scoops, Apple is also building an Amazon Echo competitor. Apple really needs a new stream of revenue considering the falling iPhone shipments and the accompanying revenue loss. But I really feel Apple is in quite some dilemma when it comes to conversational computing platforms. \nIf iMessage is to be converted into a conversational computing platform, it needs to go cross-platform. Android commands more than 80% market share of the global smartphone market. I know some would point that global market share isn’t accurate as Apple is heavily disadvantaged in emerging countries and I agree with that. But even in its home country of USA, Apple has less than 50% market share and the same is true for several other countries where Apple is the dominant manufacturer. The market share of Apple wouldn’t have been a problem but other chat apps exist as well, and leaving iMessage, all of them are cross-platform. It makes sense for developers to build bots for the chat app that’s supported by smartphone OSes rather than develop for iMessage and miss out on as much as half the market. There are two things Apple can do, one is to make iMessage cross-platform just like how Apple Music is available for Android or weave iMessage even deeper into iOS such that competing chat apps such as Facebook Messenger aren’t able to provide the same experience. \nBut even if Apple manages to do either of the above, I still feel Apple might not be able to do well. The biggest problem, in my opinion, is privacy. For bots in chat apps to be extremely useful, they need to mine a lot of data from the end device. If access to this data isn’t allowed then the job of the bot becomes even more difficult. Apple’s answer to this is differential privacy but I wonder if it’s going to help. After all, Google had to back from its initial privacy claims of Allo in order to make sure that Google Assistant would perform at its best. I am pretty sure, the folks at Google would have tried to keep privacy intact if it didn’t have a hit on performance. \nComing to conversational computing platforms, although AirPods can be considered as terminal devices, it’s difficult to think that users would wear the AirPods always, sure AirPods can help act as terminal devices when you are listening to music but if you aren’t a music junkie, are AirPods really all that helpful? Thankfully, it’s being reported that Apple is already working on an Amazon Echo competitor. Now Apple is great at designing hardware and I’m pretty sure the Apple smart speaker will be a charm to look at for the most part but I feel Apple might find itself disadvantaged in the smart speaker market. Since there’s no UI to work upon when it comes to a smart speaker, all that matters is the smart AI that’s powering the smart speaker and Google Assistant beats Siri in most cases. \nAmazon and Google make money through alternate routes and have never heavily depended on hardware. Every time you make a purchase through Echo, Amazon’s purpose is served. Similarly, Google mostly relies on ads, even if ads can’t be served through Google Home in the near term, the data collected will help in targeting ads with even more precision on other Google properties like Search, Maps, Gmail etc. Apple’s reliance on hardware profits, for the most part, makes the smart speaker a tough proposition. Amazon \nIf there’s one company that has had a runaway hit with conversational computing platforms, it’s Amazon. The company had been trying its hand at hardware for quite some time. Although the Fire range of tablets and streaming boxes have done decently well, the Fire Phone was an absolute disaster. Almost everyone had predicted that the Fire Phone would be a flop and unsurprisingly, Amazon had to a take a write-down of several hundred millions of dollars for its Fire Phone series. But to the extent that Fire Phone was a flop, Amazon Echo has been a hit. \nAmazon has managed to sell 3 million Amazon Echo devices and even introduced a smaller Amazon Echo Dot product. Nearly, every single review of Amazon Echo has been very positive and the average rating on Amazon.com is above 4.4 stars. Fire Phone being a flop is more than compensated by the hit that is Amazon Echo. Amazon’s Alexa already has more than 3000 skills developed for it. Amazon has also opened Alexa to third party manufacturers making it all the more attractive to developers. \nWhat Amazon gains from Amazon Echo is pretty straight forward. It’s an always available assistant. Amazon’s entire e-commerce business is heavily reliant on reducing the gap between the intent to buy something and actually being able to order it while making sure it reaches you at the shortest possible time. If you think about eating chocolates and can order the same with least difficulty, Amazon’s mission is accomplished. Now what better way to order stuff than have a constantly available assistant right by your side and that’s exactly what Amazon Echo is. It’s an always available assistant which you can summon to book taxis, check weather and of course buy stuff from Amazon. I personally feel Echo can be the best consumer-facing product Amazon has ever made and it fits so perfectly with the rest of Amazon. There’s only one disadvantage that Amazon has. While Google, Facebook, and Apple have tons of data upon you that they can feed to their AI assistants, Amazon, by comparison, has only shopping data for the most part. Apart from this, Amazon is uniquely placed to do well in the smart speaker/ voice based conversational computing field. Conclusion \nI would again reiterate that the future of conversational computing platform is far from certain. For all you know, they can be a fad that might go away or they can also be the next big computing platform. But whatever be the case, almost every major tech company is invested in this in some way or the other. It would be interesting to see how all of this plays out in the years to come.",

      "text": "SHOW LESS Hundreds of fake retail and product apps have popped up in Apple’s App Store in recent weeks — just in time to deceive holiday shoppers. The counterfeiters have masqueraded as retail chains like Dollar Tree and Foot Locker, big department stores like Dillard’s and Nordstrom, online product bazaars like Zappos.com and Polyvore, and luxury-goods makers like Jimmy Choo, Christian Dior and Salvatore Ferragamo. “We’re seeing a barrage of fake apps,” said Chris Mason, chief executive of Branding Brand, a Pittsburgh company that helps retailers build and maintain apps. He said his company constantly tracks new shopping apps, and this was the first time it had seen so many counterfeit iPhone apps emerge in a short period of time. Some of them appeared to be relatively harmless — essentially junk apps that served up annoying pop-up ads, he said. But there are serious risks to using a fake app. Entering credit card information opens a customer to potential financial fraud. Some fake apps contain malware that can steal personal information or even lock the phone until the user pays a ransom. And some fakes encourage users to log in using their Facebook credentials, potentially exposing sensitive personal information. The rogue apps, most of which came from developers in China, slipped through Apple’s process for reviewing every app before it is published.",

Subscribe Samsung Is Going To Include An Ai Assistant In Its Next Phone iPhone 6S / Photo Credit: Apple Apple has acknowledged that there are battery problems on some iPhone 6S models that cause the devices to shut down unexpectedly. Fortunately, the battery problem is not a safety hazard. The battery replacement program may have been in response to a request by the China Consumers Association (CCA) asking Apple to investigate complaints about permanent iPhone 6 and iPhone 6S shutdowns last week, according to AppleInsider . “Apple has determined that a very small number of iPhone 6s devices may unexpectedly shut down. This is not a safety issue and only affects devices within a limited serial number range that were manufactured between September and October 2015,” said Apple on a support page . “If you have experienced this issue, please visit an Apple Retail Store or an Apple Authorized Service Provider and have your device’s serial number checked to confirm eligibility for a battery replacement, free of charge.” The iPhone 6S battery cannot be replaced through your wireless carrier. And Apple said that the iPhone 6S battery replacement program does not extend the standard warranty coverage. It’s also worth mentioning that the battery replacement program covers affected iPhone 6S batteries for 3 years after the first retail sale of the unit. If your iPhone 6S has a cracked screen that impairs the replacement of the battery, then that issue will have to be resolved before the battery can be replaced. And there might a cost associated with the repair. Apple is offering the iPhone 6S battery replacement program worldwide, but the repairs are restricted to the country or region where the device was purchased. Over the last few months, Samsung has been dealing with major smartphone battery problems of its own. Samsung had to recall and shut down the distribution of the Galaxy Note7 smartphones due to battery combustion problems — which caused many of the devices to catch on fire. This is not the only repair program that Apple launched this month. Apple set up a separate repair program for the iPhone 6 Plus about a week ago because some of those devices may flicker or experience Multi-Touch issues after being dropped multiple times on a hard surface. If your iPhone 6 Plus has these problems, then Apple will repair it for a service price of $149. According to Forbes contributor Ewan Spence , iPhone 6 Plus owners that paid for a service on their device can contact Apple for a reimbursement if they were charged more than the $149 charge. What are your thoughts about the iPhone 6S battery replacement program? Were you affected by this problem? Please leave a comment! ",

      "text": "0 Apple CEO Tim Cook describes new models of the iMac desktop computers during an Apple event in San Jose, California October 23, 2012. Reuters/Robert Galbraith \nRecent reports suggest that the Apple iMac 2017 will be further delayed mainly because of the inclusion of the Intel Kaby Lake processor. However, certain reports claim that Apple may also be considering an Intel Xeon core processor for the iMac. \nApple fans have been waiting for the upgraded iMac for quite some time and they were thoroughly disappointed when the Cupertino tech giant did not even mention the device at the October media event, hosted by Apple. \nMany believe that the next product to be launched by Apple would be the iMac. However, now it seems the device will arrive only in 2017. However, fans are ready to wait as the wait brings with it hopes of the best specs and features in the iMac 2017. Apart, from the Kaby Lake chipset, Apple is said to revamp the iMac design altogether, adding a touch of freshness. \nThe Apple iMac 2017 could have a 27-inch 5K Display, come equipped with VR capabilities and the latest OLED touch bar. As nothing has been confirmed by Apple, fans need to rely on rumours for the time being to get an idea about what the iMac 2017 could be like. The last time the iMac received an update was in 2015, writes The Bitbag . \nAnother set of reports claim that Apple could also go with an impressive Intel Xeon core processor. It is difficult to track the source of these rumours but such processors are generally used on high-end workstation and servers. The Xeon chipset is capable of supporting error-correcting code memory. \nThis results in amazing computing performance as it limits the errors on data transfers between memory locations. However, Xeon processors are immensely expensive than the standard Intel chipsets and such a processor in an Apple iMac 2017 seems totally implausible. Moreover, a Xeon processor in an iMac may render other Apple computers, laptops and tabs useless as users will be drawn towards this device only. \nStay tuned on IBT AU for more updates on Apple iMac 2017.",

Furthermore, the battery of the laptop is also affixed. The iFixit teardown also revealed that the repair of the 2016 MacBook Pro is more difficult than that of its predecessor.\n\nread more",
