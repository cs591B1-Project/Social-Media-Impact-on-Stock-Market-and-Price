      "text": "After several delays, The Founder is kicking off a limited one-week run in Los Angeles starting December 7th to boost its Oscar chances prior to a nationwide release in January of next year. The Michael Keaton -starring biopic, directed by The Blind Side ’s John Lee Hancock , is the true story of Ray Kroc, a struggling salesman, and how he acquired Mac and Dick McDonald’s 1950s Southern California fast food restaurant from right underneath their feet.\nThe trailer shows a slick talking Keaton breaking the fourth wall before it runs through his discovery and ambitious franchising of the McDonald brothers’ then-revolutionary fast food operation. The Founder co-stars Nick Offerman as Dick McDonald, John Carroll Lynch as Mac McDonald, and Laura Dern as Kroc’s wife.\n“There’s a wolf in the henhouse, we let him in,” Offerman’s character laments, realizing his predicament far too late. Film audiences will have a chance to watch his business unravel in theaters nationwide on January 20th, 2017.",

Here's where to find them 2016-12-07T16:29:00.000Z \nWe can always count on McDonald's to fulfill our guilty fast food fantasies, and they’ve done it again: the mega chain has just added waffle fries to their holiday menu. Shutterstock \nHere's the thing. They're only at McDonald's locations in Canada. But if you live near the border, we think it's it's totally worth the trip. ",

Like Us on Facebook   \n\"Beyond Belief,\" which was published last week by independent think tank ResPublica , analyzes how laws, such as the Equality Act 2010, which are meant to strengthen anti-discrimination laws and the rights of minorities, have instead led to an erosion of religious liberties. \nWhat is more, the report claims, they have fueled an \"atmosphere of deep mutual distrust\" between groups, and have \"suffocated,\" rather than stimulated, public debate in society about equality and difference.",
