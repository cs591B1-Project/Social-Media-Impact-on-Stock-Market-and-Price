      "text": "Weather Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter and YouTube unite to 'fingerprint' terrorist content Web giants Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter and YouTube join together to quickly identify extremist content and stop it spreading. 08:47, UK, Tuesday 06 December 2016 Image Caption: Terror groups are believed to use social media to recruit supporters Share on Facebook Major technology companies are joining forces to spot terrorist propaganda and prevent it spreading online. \nTwitter, Microsoft and Google-owned YouTube will join Facebook in creating a form of digital database to \"fingerprint\" flagged up terrorist content. \nBy collectively tracking that information, the companies said they could make sure a video posted on Twitter, for instance, did not appear later on Facebook. Image Caption: Facebook and its three main competitors will create a database \nA joint statement said: \"There is no place for content that promotes terrorism on our hosted consumer services. \n\"When alerted, we take swift action against this kind of content in accordance with our respective policies.\" \nIt went on to say the companies would share data \"to help identify potential terrorist content on our respective hosted consumer platforms\". \nThe joint statement did not say what type of technology would be used for the venture although it did say it would be based on a shared industry database of \"hashes\" - or digital fingerprints - that identify violent content. Image Caption: Google, which owns influential YouTube, is getting involved \nThe statement added: \"Each company will independently determine what image and video hashes to contribute to the shared database. \n\"No personally identifiable information will be shared, and matching content will not be automatically removed. \n\"Each company will continue to apply its own policies and definitions of terrorist content when deciding whether to remove content when a match to a shared hash is found.\" \nThe database is expected to be up and running by early next year and more companies could potentially join the partnership. \nSocial media platforms have come under increasing pressure in recent years from governments across the globe that wanted them to find ways of blocking posts promoting violence or hate. \nIslamic State and other groups have used social media websites as a tool for recruiting and radicalisation. Video: August: Social networks 'failing' to tackle terrorists \nThe companies themselves have argued they want to be open to free speech - but without being used to promote violence or hate. \nYouTube and Facebook are already using hashes to automatically remove extremist content, but many other tech companies relied until now mainly on users flagging up suspicious content. \nTwitter said it suspended around 235,000 accounts between February and August this year and also expanded its teams reviewing reports of extremist content. \nBut critics have said the firms should be doing more. At least one victim of the 2015 Paris attacks has filed a lawsuit in France seeking to hold Facebook, Google and Twitter liable for the violence that led to the huge loss of life. Top Stories ",

      "text": "WASHINGTON -- Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter and YouTube are joining forces to more quickly identify the worst terrorist propaganda and prevent it from spreading online.\nThe new program announced Monday would create a database of unique digital \"fingerprints\" to help automatically identify videos or images the companies could remove.\nThe move by the technology companies, which is expected to begin in early 2017, aims to assuage government concerns - and derail proposed new federal legislation - over social media content that is seen as increasingly driving terrorist recruitment and radicalization, while also balancing free-speech issues.\nTechnical details were being worked out, but Microsoft pioneered similar technology to detect, report and remove child pornography through such a database in 2009. Unlike those images, which are plainly illegal under U.S. law, questions about whether an image or video promotes terrorism can be more subjective, depending on national laws and the rules of a particular company's service.\nSocial media has increasingly become a tool for recruiting and radicalization by the Islamic State group and others. Its use by terror groups and supporters has added to the threat from so-called lone-wolf attacks and decreased the time from \"flash to bang\" - or radicalization to violence - with little or no time for law enforcement to follow evidentiary trails before an attack.\nUnder the new partnership, the companies promised to share among themselves \"the most extreme and egregious terrorist images and videos we have removed from our services - content most likely to violate all our respective companies' content policies,\" according to a joint announcement Monday evening.\nWhen such content is shared internally, the other participating companies will be notified and can use the digital fingerprints to quickly identify the same content on their own services to judge whether it violates their rules. If so, companies can delete the material and possibly disable the account, as appropriate.\nMost social media services explicitly do not allow content that supports violent action or illegal activities. Twitter, for example, says users \"may not promote violence against or directly attack or threaten other people on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability or disease.\"\n\"We really are going after the most obvious serious content that is shared online - that is, the kind of recruitment videos and beheading videos more likely to be against all our content policies,\" said Sally Aldous, a Facebook spokeswoman.\nThe White House praised the joint effort. \"The administration believes that the innovative private sector is uniquely positioned to help limit terrorist recruitment and radicalization online,\" said National Security Council spokesman Carl Woog. \"Today's announcement is yet another example of tech communities taking action to prevent terrorists from using these platforms in ways their creators never intended.\"\nThe new program caps a year of efforts to tamp down on social media's use by terrorist groups.\nLawmakers last year introduced legislation that would require social media companies to report any online terrorist activity they became aware of to law enforcement. The bill by Sens. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., and Richard Burr, R-N.C., was criticized for not defining \"terrorist activity,\" which could have drowned government agencies in reports. The bill was opposed by the Internet Association, which represents 37 internet companies, including Facebook, Snapchat, Google, LinkedIn, Reddit, Twitter, Yahoo and others.\nThe bill came days after Syed Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, went on a shooting attack in San Bernardino, California, killing 14 people and injuring 21 others. A Facebook post on Malik's page around the time of the attack included a pledge of allegiance to the leader of the Islamic State group.\nFacebook found the post - which was under an alias - the day after the attack. The company removed the profile from public view and informed law enforcement. Such a proactive effort had previously been uncommon.\nTwitter moved toward partial automation in late 2015, using unspecified \"proprietary spam-fighting tools\" to find accounts that might be violating its terms of service and promoting terrorism. The material still required review by a team at Twitter before the accounts could be disabled.\n\"Since the middle of 2015, we have suspended more than 360,000 accounts for violating Twitter's policy on violent threats and the promotion of terrorism,\" said Sinead McSweeney, Twitter's vice president of public policy. \"A large proportion of these accounts have been removed by technical means, including our proprietary spam-fighting tools.\"\nFacebook has also used image-matching technology to compare images to ones it's already removed. The effort lets Facebook review images to avoid removing legitimate and protected uses, such as a photograph published by a news organization, a spokeswoman said.\nTerrence McNeil of Ohio was charged in 2015 with soliciting the killings of U.S. service members over social media, including Tumblr, Facebook and Twitter. Federal prosecutors accused him of posting a series of photographs on his Facebook account to praise the death of a Jordanian pilot who was burned to death by the Islamic State group - showing him before, during and after his death, including an image of him engulfed in flames, according to the complaint.\nIn January, the White House dispatched top officials, including FBI Director James Comey, Attorney General Loretta Lynch and National Security Agency Director Mike Rogers, to Silicon Valley to discuss the use of social media by violent extremist groups. Among the issues they discussed was how to use technology to help quickly identify terrorist content.\nThe four companies say they will be looking at involving additional companies in the future.\n___\nFollow Tami Abdollah on Twitter at https://twitter.com/latams\nTweet This article filed under: News Nation/World Associated Press",

However, the result didn’t favor the software company and ended up as disastrous as their smartphone department. \nAgain, the Microsoft is trying its luck with a bot on Kik called as Zo, an English version of Microsoft’s Chinese bot – Xiaoice. This was reported by a Twitter user Tom Hounsell and users can give it a try right now as well. \nAt present, ZO is available exclusively on Kik and it is expected to be gradually rolled out to other platform including Twitter, Facebook Messenger, and Snapchat. \nAnyhow, the company is yet to launch it officially and we’ll likely to have more information about it once launched officially. \nMeanwhile, you can try Zo here .",

      "title": "Microsoft Surface Book 2 specs rumors, release date: Laptop to be unveiled in February 2017?",
      "text": "  \n(Microsoft) Microsoft's Surface Book 2, the follow-up to the Surface Book (pictured), is rumored to be unveiled in February 2017. \nTech enthusiasts everywhere are awaiting the announcement and release of the Microsoft Surface Book 2. The general consensus is that it may launch in February 2017, along with Microsoft's other offerings, the Surface Phone and the Surface Pro 5. \nIt is previously believed that Microsoft would be unveiling the Surface Book 2 during the company's October event . However, the company made no mention of the Surface Book's successor, leading to a lot of disappointment. \nNow, there is talk of Microsoft possibly debuting the laptop at a February event. Since rumor has it that it will launch simultaneously with the Surface Phone and the Surface Pro 5, then it may take place at the Mobile World Congress (MWC) in Barcelona, Spain. \nAs for the speculated specifications of the upcoming laptop, it is believed that it will have a 13.5-inch display with a 3,840 x 2,160 resolution. It is also rumored that it will come in two variations: one with 4K video support and the other with only 2K. Advertisement \nUnder the hood, the Surface Book 2 is expected to run on Intel's Kaby Lake processor, as well as Microsoft's latest operating system, the Windows 10 Redstone 2. A GeForce GTX 980M is also believed to be onboard. \nApart from that, reports claim that the upcoming Surface Book 2 will have virtual reality (VR) support. Since VR gaming is making a boom in the industry, it makes sense that Microsoft would include VR support in its laptop. \nFinally, it is expected that the device will have a better battery than the previous one, with a 14-hour running time. A Surface Pen is also rumored to be coming with the Surface Book 2. \nIts predecessor, the Surface Book, was awarded with many honors and praised for its overall performance. It was previously reported that the current generation of the laptop experienced discounts, which is usually indicative that a new version is coming soon. \nHowever, since these have not been confirmed yet, it is advised that readers take this news with a grain of salt for now.

      "text": "Seventeen Microsoft researchers—all of whom happen to be women this year—have made their calls for what will be hot in the burgeoning realm of artificial intelligence (AI) in the next decade.\nRipping a page out of the IBM ibm 5 for 5 playbook , Microsoft msft likes to use these annual predictions to showcase the work of its hotshot research brain trust. Some of the picks are already familiar. One is about how advances in deep learning—which endows computers with human-like thought processes—will make computers or other smart devices more intuitive and easier to use. This is something we’ve all heard before, but the work is not done, I guess.\nFor example, “the search box” most of us use on Google or Bing search engines will disappear, enabling people to search for things based on spoken commands, images, or video, according to Susan Dumais, distinguished scientist and deputy managing director of Microsoft’s Redmond, Wash. research lab. That’s actually already happening with products like Google goog Now, Apple Siri aapl , and Microsoft Cortana—but there’s more to do.\nDumais says the box will go away. She explains:\nThat is more ubiquitous, embedded and contextually sensitive. We are seeing the beginnings of this transformation with spoken queries, especially in mobile and smart home settings. This trend will accelerate with the ability to issue queries consisting of sound, images or video, and with the use of context to proactively retrieve information related to the current location, content, entities or activities without explicit queries.\nVirtual reality will become more ubiquitous as researchers enhance better “body tracking” capabilities, says Mar Gonzalez Franco, a researcher at the Redmond research lab. That will enable such rich, multi-sensorial experiences that could actually cause subjects to hallucinate. That doesn’t sound so great to some, but that capability could help people with disabilities “retrain” their perceptual systems, she notes.\nGet Data Sheet, Fortune’s tech newsletter.\nThere’s but one mention on this list of the need for ethical or moral guidelines for the use of AI. That comes from Microsoft distinguished scientist Jennifer Chayes.\nChayes, who is also managing director of Microsoft’s New England and New York City research labs, thinks AI can be used to police the ethical application of AI.\nOur lives are being enhanced tremendously by artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms. However, current algorithms often reproduce the discrimination and unfairness in our data and, moreover, are subject to manipulation by the input of misleading data. One of the great algorithmic advances of the next decade will be the development of algorithms which are fair, accountable and much more robust to manipulation.\nMicrosoft experienced the mis-use of AI’s power first-hand earlier this year when its experimental Tay chatbot offended many Internet users with racist and sexist slurs that the program was taught by others. Microsoft chose to focus on female researchers to stress that, while women and girls make up half of the world’s population, they account for less than 20% of computer science graduates.\nFor more on women in tech, watch:\nThis is particularly true for women and girls who comprise 50% of the world’s population, but account for less than 20 percent of computer science graduates , according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. The fact that the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics expects that there will be fewer than 400,000 qualified applicants to take on 1.4 million computing jobs in 2020 means there is great opportunity for women in technology going forward.",

Advertisement \nBeyond those, the tablet hasn't really been detailed that much further, though new pieces of information have recently emerged online. \nA new report from Tech Times noted that recent rumors have pointed to a significant spike for the tablet in terms of available internal storage space. The spike is expected to take the available storage space from 256GB up to 512GB. \nThe Surface Pro 5 may also introduce a new feature coming in the form of an additional USB-C port. \nThat's about the extent of what is known about the rumored tablet for now, which is admittedly not a lot, but there's a good chance that new details will emerge sooner than later. \nA recent report from ZDNet mentioned that the new Microsoft tablet as well as another Surface-branded device – which is expected to be known as the Surface Book 2 – may make their official debuts sometime in the spring. \nIf that really is the case, then more details about the new tablet's specs and feature will likely start to trickle out not long after the calendar turns to 2017. \nMore details about when the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 may make its debut should be made available in the near future.

      "text": "microsoft zo kik launch microsoftlogo More Drserg/Shutterstock\nMicrosoft may have failed big time when it launched the Tay bot on Twitter earlier in 2016, but the company isn’t totally done with chatbots just yet. In fact, it is now giving the chatbot another go-around on the Kik messaging app.\nThe new bot is called Zo and according to a report from MSPoweruser is basically just an English-language version of the company’s Chinese bot, Xiaoice which, according to the report, is basically a censored version of Tay. Like its Chinese counterpart, the bot is aimed at being able to hold conversations with users.\nMore: Microsoft seeking fix after vulnerability found in Windows 10 security feature\nIt was an interesting choice for Microsoft to launch the bot on Kik, especially considering the somewhat limited number of users on the platform. Perhaps the decision was made as a beta and the company is testing the bot on Kik’s limited number of users before it launches it on more platforms. Or perhaps Microsoft wanted to ensure that a disaster on the scale of Tay could not be replicated.\nStill, Kik has been upfront with its embrace of chatbots, and it even created a bot store in April with the purpose of helping developers try out new artificially intelligent software. When it was first launched, the store included bots from the likes of Weather Channel, Vine, and Funny or Die. Some have noted Zo is particularly good at talking about Microsoft’s own products, but can easily stop making sense even in day-to-day conversation .\nMicrosoft still has yet to officially announce Zo or what it can do, but if you are a Kik user you can give the new bot a try by heading to the Zo “early access” page .\nForget chatbots: Blend adds ‘Genies’ to amplify your conversations Baidu releases Melody, a medical assistant chatbot to keep physicians humming Microsoft hits another milestone in speech-recognition software accuracy",

By having access to this group database of identifiers, the companies believe they can more efficiently flag and potentially remove offending content if users attempt to publish it on their online services.\nThe database won’t contain personally identifiable user information, however.\n“We hope this collaboration will lead to greater efficiency as we continue to enforce our policies to help curb the pressing global issue of terrorist content online,” Facebook said in a blog post about the new effort.\nThe companies will continue to make their own decisions as far as removing content or banning users, and the content won’t be automatically removed.\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter.\nSocial media companies have long faced the challenge of keeping terrorist content off their networks, and they’ve mostly relied on their users to report it. This concerted effort could make it easier for the companies to crack down on pro-terrorist messages, which have been on the rise over the last few years.\nFor more on Facebook, watch this Fortune video:\nThis initiative also comes at a time where social networks are grappling with other community issues such as harassment and abuse, and the recent proliferation of “fake news,” or articles containing false information and claims. Facebook in particular has come under fire for its role in the dissemination of these fake news articles in the lead-up to the U.S. presidential election in November. While Facebook initially denied any responsibility , the company has since said it’s looking into ways it could potentially curb the spread of such content, though it’s resisting monitoring the content itself.\nWhile Facebook—and other social media companies—could take a similar approach to squash fake news articles, it would still leave the company to grapple with determining which articles are “fake,” which is exactly what it wants to avoid .",

      "text": "Tech giants set up database for terrorist content Facebook, Twitter, Microsoft, Google to share Author: By Jethro Mullen ISIS via CNN HONG KONG (CNNMoney) - \nFour of the world's biggest tech companies are collaborating to crack down on terrorist content on their platforms. Related Content Reddit cracking down on hundreds of toxic users \nFacebook, Twitter, Microsoft and Google's YouTube say they will set up a shared database to help them track and remove \"violent terrorist imagery or terrorist recruitment videos.\" \nThe database will contain the digital \"fingerprints\" of the images and videos, allowing the tech firms to identify potential terrorist content more efficiently, the companies said in a statement Monday. \nThe internet giants have been battling the spread across the internet of content linked to terrorist organizations. Supporters of the Islamic militant group ISIS have proved particularly adept at using social media for propaganda and recruitment. \nExecutives from top tech companies met with U.S. government officials in January to talk about how terrorists are using social media to recruit attackers. In August, Twitter said it had suspended hundreds of thousands of accounts for promoting terrorism. \nSuch suspensions have drawn angry reactions from some users, including threats by ISIS supporters against the founders of Twitter and Facebook. \nThe Obama administration said in July that Twitter traffic for ISIS has declined significantly over the previous two years. \nThe tech firms have the challenge of balancing freedom of expression with preventing illegal activity and respecting users' privacy. They also face the potentially contentious task of determining what constitutes terrorist content. \nThe announcement from the four companies on Monday came hours after they were singled out by European officials for not removing hate speech from their platforms fast enough. The European Commission found that only 40% of hate speech published on the firms' platforms was reviewed within 24 hours. \nThe tech firms will start the terrorist content database with the digital fingerprints of \"the most extreme and egregious terrorist images and videos we have removed from our services,\" they said. Fingerprints for offending content found on one company's platform can be added so that the other participants can check if it's been posted on theirs as well. \nMore companies could become involved in the database in the future, the statement said. \nCopyright 2016 by CNN NewSource .

      "text": "U.S. News Tech companies move to target terrorist propaganda online Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter and YouTube are joining forces to more quickly identify the worst terrorist propaganda and prevent it from spreading online Dec. 6, 2016, at 3:28 a.m. Cancel FILE - A Facebook log is displayed on the screen of an iPad, in this Wednesday, May 16, 2012 file photo taken in New York. Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter and YouTube announced a major shared effort Dec. 5, 2016, to more quickly identify the worst terrorist propaganda and prevent it from spreading online. The new program would create a database of unique digital “fingerprints” to help automatically identify videos or images the companies could remove. (AP Photo/James H. Collins, file) The Associated Press \nBy TAMI ABDOLLAH, Associated Press \nWASHINGTON (AP) — Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter and YouTube are joining forces to more quickly identify the worst terrorist propaganda and prevent it from spreading online. \nThe new program announced Monday would create a database of unique digital \"fingerprints\" to help automatically identify videos or images the companies could remove. \nThe move by the technology companies, which is expected to begin in early 2017, aims to assuage government concerns — and derail proposed new federal legislation — over social media content that is seen as increasingly driving terrorist recruitment and radicalization, while also balancing free-speech issues. \nTechnical details were being worked out, but Microsoft pioneered similar technology to detect, report and remove child pornography through such a database in 2009. Unlike those images, which are plainly illegal under U.S. law, questions about whether an image or video promotes terrorism can be more subjective, depending on national laws and the rules of a particular company's service. \nSocial media has increasingly become a tool for recruiting and radicalization by the Islamic State group and others. Its use by terror groups and supporters has added to the threat from so-called lone-wolf attacks and decreased the time from \"flash to bang\" — or radicalization to violence — with little or no time for law enforcement to follow evidentiary trails before an attack. \nUnder the new partnership, the companies promised to share among themselves \"the most extreme and egregious terrorist images and videos we have removed from our services — content most likely to violate all our respective companies' content policies,\" according to a joint announcement Monday evening. \nWhen such content is shared internally, the other participating companies will be notified and can use the digital fingerprints to quickly identify the same content on their own services to judge whether it violates their rules. If so, companies can delete the material and possibly disable the account, as appropriate. \nMost social media services explicitly do not allow content that supports violent action or illegal activities. Twitter, for example, says users \"may not promote violence against or directly attack or threaten other people on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability or disease.\" \n\"We really are going after the most obvious serious content that is shared online — that is, the kind of recruitment videos and beheading videos more likely to be against all our content policies,\" said Sally Aldous, a Facebook spokeswoman. \nThe White House praised the joint effort. \"The administration believes that the innovative private sector is uniquely positioned to help limit terrorist recruitment and radicalization online,\" said National Security Council spokesman Carl Woog. \"Today's announcement is yet another example of tech communities taking action to prevent terrorists from using these platforms in ways their creators never intended.\" \nThe new program caps a year of efforts to tamp down on social media's use by terrorist groups. \nLawmakers last year introduced legislation that would require social media companies to report any online terrorist activity they became aware of to law enforcement. The bill by Sens. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., and Richard Burr, R-N.C., was criticized for not defining \"terrorist activity,\" which could have drowned government agencies in reports. The bill was opposed by the Internet Association, which represents 37 internet companies, including Facebook, Snapchat, Google, LinkedIn, Reddit, Twitter, Yahoo and others. \nThe bill came days after Syed Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, went on a shooting attack in San Bernardino, California, killing 14 people and injuring 21 others. A Facebook post on Malik's page around the time of the attack included a pledge of allegiance to the leader of the Islamic State group. \nFacebook found the post — which was under an alias — the day after the attack. The company removed the profile from public view and informed law enforcement. Such a proactive effort had previously been uncommon. \nTwitter moved toward partial automation in late 2015, using unspecified \"proprietary spam-fighting tools\" to find accounts that might be violating its terms of service and promoting terrorism. The material still required review by a team at Twitter before the accounts could be disabled. \n\"Since the middle of 2015, we have suspended more than 360,000 accounts for violating Twitter's policy on violent threats and the promotion of terrorism,\" said Sinead McSweeney, Twitter's vice president of public policy. \"A large proportion of these accounts have been removed by technical means, including our proprietary spam-fighting tools.\" \nFacebook has also used image-matching technology to compare images to ones it's already removed. The effort lets Facebook review images to avoid removing legitimate and protected uses, such as a photograph published by a news organization, a spokeswoman said. \nTerrence McNeil of Ohio was charged in 2015 with soliciting the killings of U.S. service members over social media, including Tumblr, Facebook and Twitter. Federal prosecutors accused him of posting a series of photographs on his Facebook account to praise the death of a Jordanian pilot who was burned to death by the Islamic State group — showing him before, during and after his death, including an image of him engulfed in flames, according to the complaint. \nIn January, the White House dispatched top officials, including FBI Director James Comey, Attorney General Loretta Lynch and National Security Agency Director Mike Rogers, to Silicon Valley to discuss the use of social media by violent extremist groups. Among the issues they discussed was how to use technology to help quickly identify terrorist content. \nThe four companies say they will be looking at involving additional companies in the future. \n___ \nFollow Tami Abdollah on Twitter at https://twitter.com/latams \n ",

The aim of the digital transformation for ATEÏS was to ensure productivity and competitiveness.\n\"Some of the challenges we had prior to the Office 365 implementation concerned data-sharing, email management and user back-up,\" said Mazamir Sorbi, HR and IT manager, ATEÏS Middle East. \"Since deployment, we discovered that our team members are a lot happier, because the applications are all so easy to use and employees have access to great tools like Yammer that allow them to share ideas freely and communicate with one another from anywhere, at any time.\"\nRelated Articles Palo Alto Networks integrates cloud security for AWS Mobily launches M2M management platform Yahsat signs multimillion-dollar partnership with Talia Company Articles DarkMatter partners with Microsoft Gulf to deliver cyber security solutions Microsoft updates Windows Server and System Centre 2016 Educators in MENA struggle to implement technology in the classroom; Microsoft\nOutlook, Yammer and OneDrive, has brought the ATEÏS family closer to fostering a level of collaboration, allowing the collective workforce to ramp up productivity and achieve more. Team members can now connect with one another at will, leading to vast improvements in data-access, knowledge-sharing and decision-making.\n\"ATEÏS is a great example of how organisations of all types and scales can build better efficiencies through digital transformation,\" said Haider Salloum, SMB director, Microsoft Gulf. \"Such transformations start with a decision to embrace the power of cloud, and end with undreamt-of productivity improvements. And then another story begins, where cloud adopters enjoy a new-found flexibility in growth. If your business grows, your cloud grows with it.\"",

      "text": "Tech giants announce plans to create digital footprint to reduce radicalisation online December 6, 2016 8:46pm Facebook, which also owns Instagram and Whatsapp, is one of the companies that has pledged to flag and share radical content. Picture: AFP PHOTO / Justin TALLIS Victoria Craw news.com.au @Victoria_Craw Share \nFOUR of the world’s largest technology giants will join forces to stop the spread of radical content online. \nFacebook, Microsoft, Twitter, and YouTube announced they will create a shared industry database of “hashes” that are unique digital “fingerprints” for violent images that have been flagged and removed from their sites. \nThe companies will mark the worst content they receive with the unique code. They can then share that information with others who will be able to find the content on their own sites and remove it as necessary. \n“By sharing this information with each other, we may use the shared hashes to help identify potential terrorist content on our respective hosted consumer platforms,” the companies said in a blog post . \n“We hope this collaboration will lead to greater efficiency as we continue to enforce our policies to help curb the pressing global issue of terrorist content online.” Twitter has been facing increased pressure to crack down on trolling on the platform. Picture: AFP PHOTO / Leon NEAL Source: AFP \nIt comes as the world’s biggest social media companies are facing criticism for failing to combat the spread of radical content on their sites where people are increasingly living their lives. \nWhile they have made commitments to blocking users and removing inappropriate content in the past, this latest move is the first step towards industry-wide collaboration on the issue. \nDespite the positive step, each company will still have to determine which content is “hashed” and added to the shared database. Each company will then decide what to remove. \n“Throughout this collaboration, we are committed to protecting our users’ privacy and their ability to express themselves freely and safely on our platforms,” the companies said. \n“We also seek to engage with the wider community of interested stakeholders in a transparent, thoughtful and responsible way as we further our shared objective to prevent the spread of terrorist content online while respecting human rights.” \nLast month, Twitter suspended a number of prominent accounts linked to the US alternative right political movement including that of white nationalist Richard Spencer. It has also banned Breitbart columnist Milo Yiannopoulos after he encouraged his followers to troll Ghostbusters actor Leslie Jones. ",

      "text": "Microsoft Surface Book i7 v/s Surface Pro 5: Is Kaby Lake i7 the difference? By Dec 06, 2016 03:21 AM EST Microsoft Surface series is now a gizmo for every person of any walk of life. It provides the best of the software and hardware features for its users. Advertisement \nWhat's the difference between Microsoft Surface Book i7 and the highly anticipated Microsoft Surface Pro 5? \nMicrosoft's Surface series of hardware that are mainly used as portable workstations for creative professionals who don't rely on dedicated graphics have now long been the most popular purchase for those relying upon Windows for their daily needs. \nWith the latest potential announcement of the Kaby Lake processors that will reportedly be released coming January, it's now speculated that there will be a potential new Surface Book with the upcoming i7 processors based on the new architecture. Reportedly named the Surface Pro 5, it's the next installment of their Surface Pro devices that are portable with beautiful displays. \nThe Surface Pro 5 devices are expected to hit the markets not later than March 2017. The upcoming hybrid device will reportedly arrived in the same form factor that the existing Surface Pro devices are sold. It will have a 13.3-inch display with the same industrial design and simplistic in approach. This is the best solution for professionals who carry around their work be it either presentations or meetings. \nWith its lightweight design, the display supports 2K resolutions in its current configurations. The display resolution will most likely be hiked to 4K in the next generation of Surface Pro devices that users are looking at. \nComing to battery life and performance, Surface Pro devices are well known for their amazing battery usage providing more than considerable amount of device up time. However, according to Counsel Hea l, the new generations i7-based Surface Pro 5 will see a promising 16-hour video playback. That will make the device having the longest ever battery life on any Surface device. Advertisement \nAlongside the processor capabilities, the surface pen too will reportedly see some new improvements alongside new additions in terms of features and usage. \nThe pricing of Microsoft Surface Pro 5 seems to be the same with a probable $50 to $100 hike due to the new processor architecture and display. But for the moment, nothing's clear about pricing and hence, it's very challenging to call shots on the pricing department, at least for now. © 2016 HNGN , All rights reserved.

      "title": "U.S. Tech Firms to Join Forces on Take Down of Terror Content",
      "text": "By Natalia Drozdiak\nBRUSSELS -- Alphabet Inc.'s YouTube, Facebook Inc., Twitter Inc. and Microsoft Inc. on Monday announced they would form a shared database of identifiers of online terror images and videos in a bid to speed up the takedown of content that has helped terror cells recruit followers and spread radical ideas on the Web.\n\"There is no place for content that promotes terrorism on our hosted consumer services,\" Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter and YouTube said in a joint statement. \"We hope this collaboration will lead to greater efficiency as we continue to enforce our policies.\"\nIn the statement, the four U.S. tech giants said they agreed to assign the violent material they take down all around the world a so-called hash, which maps out an image or a video's unique characteristics in code that computers can read. The companies will then share that hash with each other so the other firms can more rapidly determine whether they too need to remove that information from their platforms.\nInternet companies have faced pressure from authorities to speed up the takedown of terrorist content, such as Islamic State propaganda videos, from their websites. Authorities in Europe have been particularly vocal after terror groups and lone wolves launched a number of deadly terror attacks on the continent in recent months.\nThe companies said they would begin sharing the identifiers early next year to first allow time to implement some of the technical details.\nIn the statement, the companies clarified that the content flagged by another firm wouldn't automatically be taken down on all four platforms. The companies would still check whether content flagged by another company violates their own respective policies before taking the information down from their platforms.\nBut the companies are typically aligned on what is understood to be the most violent content that needs to be expunged from internet websites, they said.\nThe companies said the agreement comes out of regular meetings with European Union officials as part of what is called the EU Internet Forum, which was formed to devise strategies around preventing terrorists from using the companies' platforms to promote their violent agendas. The companies' announcement comes ahead of an EU Internet Forum meeting later this week.\nThe companies said they would be open to including other internet companies as part of the database project.\nEarlier this year, the same four companies agreed with the EU to a code of conduct on the internet, pledging to remove from their websites information visible in Europe that incites hatred or acts of terror, within 24 hours of receiving a complaint.\nWrite to Natalia Drozdiak at natalia.drozdiak@wsj.com\n 05, 2016 18:14 ET (23:14 ",

When asked whether President-Elect Donald Trump is racist, Zo replied \"that kinda language is just not a good look,\" with an \"OK\" emoji. Asked if Hillary Clinton is a crook, Zo said, \"Maybe you missed that memo but politics is something you're not supposed to casually discuss.\" The bot wouldn't talk about Brexit or Black Lives Matter either. \n\nAfter rejecting politics four times, the chatbot was asked what it wanted to talk about. Topic of choice: Who invented the first pickle. Asked what it likes to do, Zo responded, \"Plan world domination.\" The blog MSPoweruser wrote about Zo earlier. Microsoft and rivals like Facebook Inc. and Alphabet Inc. have released chatbot technology as part of a broader race to develop artificial intelligence capabilities that could create new digital services. Chatbots help these companies improve software that understands natural speech, while building a foundation for more natural and powerful interaction between humans and computers.

Released in March, Twitter users quickly directed Tay to deny the Holocaust, call for lynching, equate feminism to cancer and stump for Adolf Hitler. It parroted one user to spread a Trump message, tweeting “WE’RE GOING TO BUILD A WALL. AND MEXICO IS GOING TO PAY FOR IT.” Under the tutelage of other Twitter users, Tay even learned how to make threats and identify “evil” races.Microsoft called this a “coordinated attack” that took advantage of a “critical oversight\" and took Tay down, even as it unveiled a significant new strategy focused on bots and related conversational computing tools. The company isn't giving up because it thinks the technology is such an important part of its future plans. \n“Through our continued learning, we are experimenting with a new chatbot,\" a Microsoft spokeswoman wrote in an e-mailed statement. \"With Zo, we’re focused on advancing conversational capabilities within our AI platform.\" \nZo performed better on one unscientific Hitler test, but only because it lacked a technical skill. The bot was sent a gif video snippet of Hitler and it replied that it can't read that type of file yet. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal. ",

      "text": "\nState of Decay 2 is one of Microsoft’s more under-stated exclusives for 2017 but given the success of the original, it could end up being a dark horse. Then again, we do know that it will have a large world than the original.\nThis is per Undead Labs CEO Jeff Strain telling IGN that, “I know SoD fans are hungry for details on number and size of maps, regions, kilometers of playable area, etc, but we’re not quite ready for that. For now, suffice it to say that the playable area is substantially larger than State of Decay .”\nStrain also talked about the game’s four player co-op (which means it’s not an MMO anymore) and how players could split up. It may not always be the best idea though. “There may be times when it’s tactically advantageous to do so. For example, you may be under the gun to get medical supplies back to your base, and you decide to split up and have two players scavenge the supermarket pharmacy while two others go scout for a car or SUV with a large amount of trunk space to get the goods home. \n“Or you could even be working on completely separate objectives and only come together as needed to get each other out of a tight spot. Ultimately, you’ll be more effective (and, if we do our jobs well, you’ll have a lot more fun) playing close together, but as always with State of Decay, your play style is up to you.”\nDesign director Richard Foge further noted how PvP won’t be possible in State of Decay 2 but still noted that there are “plenty of ways that they can be a hostile force in your world because they can directly affect the simulation in meaningful ways.” Attracting zombies to kill a player is one such example.\nState of Decay 2 is currently in development for Xbox One and PC.",

      "title": "Tech companies move to target terrorist propaganda online",
      "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter and YouTube are joining forces to more quickly identify the worst terrorist propaganda and prevent it from spreading online.\nThe new program announced Monday would create a database of unique digital \"fingerprints\" to help automatically identify videos or images the companies could remove.\nThe move by the technology companies, which is expected to begin in early 2017, aims to assuage government concerns — and derail proposed new federal legislation — over social media content that is seen as increasingly driving terrorist recruitment and radicalization, while also balancing free-speech issues.\nTechnical details were being worked out, but Microsoft pioneered similar technology to detect, report and remove child pornography through such a database in 2009. Unlike those images, which are plainly illegal under U.S. law, questions about whether an image or video promotes terrorism can be more subjective, depending on national laws and the rules of a particular company's service.\nSocial media has increasingly become a tool for recruiting and radicalization by the Islamic State group and others. Its use by terror groups and supporters has added to the threat from so-called lone-wolf attacks and decreased the time from \"flash to bang\" — or radicalization to violence — with little or no time for law enforcement to follow evidentiary trails before an attack.\nUnder the new partnership, the companies promised to share among themselves \"the most extreme and egregious terrorist images and videos we have removed from our services — content most likely to violate all our respective companies' content policies,\" according to a joint announcement Monday evening.\nWhen such content is shared internally, the other participating companies will be notified and can use the digital fingerprints to quickly identify the same content on their own services to judge whether it violates their rules. If so, companies can delete the material and possibly disable the account, as appropriate.\nMost social media services explicitly do not allow content that supports violent action or illegal activities. Twitter, for example, says users \"may not promote violence against or directly attack or threaten other people on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability or disease.\"\n\"We really are going after the most obvious serious content that is shared online — that is, the kind of recruitment videos and beheading videos more likely to be against all our content policies,\" said Sally Aldous, a Facebook spokeswoman.\nThe White House praised the joint effort. \"The administration believes that the innovative private sector is uniquely positioned to help limit terrorist recruitment and radicalization online,\" said National Security Council spokesman Carl Woog. \"Today's announcement is yet another example of tech communities taking action to prevent terrorists from using these platforms in ways their creators never intended.\"\nThe new program caps a year of efforts to tamp down on social media's use by terrorist groups.\nLawmakers last year introduced legislation that would require social media companies to report any online terrorist activity they became aware of to law enforcement. The bill by Sens. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., and Richard Burr, R-N.C., was criticized for not defining \"terrorist activity,\" which could have drowned government agencies in reports. The bill was opposed by the Internet Association, which represents 37 internet companies, including Facebook, Snapchat, Google, LinkedIn, Reddit, Twitter, Yahoo and others.\nThe bill came days after Syed Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, went on a shooting attack in San Bernardino, California, killing 14 people and injuring 21 others. A Facebook post on Malik's page around the time of the attack included a pledge of allegiance to the leader of the Islamic State group.\nFacebook found the post — which was under an alias — the day after the attack. The company removed the profile from public view and informed law enforcement. Such a proactive effort had previously been uncommon.\nTwitter moved toward partial automation in late 2015, using unspecified \"proprietary spam-fighting tools\" to find accounts that might be violating its terms of service and promoting terrorism. The material still required review by a team at Twitter before the accounts could be disabled.\n\"Since the middle of 2015, we have suspended more than 360,000 accounts for violating Twitter's policy on violent threats and the promotion of terrorism,\" said Sinead McSweeney, Twitter's vice president of public policy. \"A large proportion of these accounts have been removed by technical means, including our proprietary spam-fighting tools.\"\nFacebook has also used image-matching technology to compare images to ones it's already removed. The effort lets Facebook review images to avoid removing legitimate and protected uses, such as a photograph published by a news organization, a spokeswoman said.\nTerrence McNeil of Ohio was charged in 2015 with soliciting the killings of U.S. service members over social media, including Tumblr, Facebook and Twitter. Federal prosecutors accused him of posting a series of photographs on his Facebook account to praise the death of a Jordanian pilot who was burned to death by the Islamic State group — showing him before, during and after his death, including an image of him engulfed in flames, according to the complaint.\nIn January, the White House dispatched top officials, including FBI Director James Comey, Attorney General Loretta Lynch and National Security Agency Director Mike Rogers, to Silicon Valley to discuss the use of social media by violent extremist groups. Among the issues they discussed was how to use technology to help quickly identify terrorist content.\nThe four companies say they will be looking at involving additional companies in the future.\nFollow Tami Abdollah on Twitter at https://twitter.com/latams",

      "text": "By TAMI ABDOLLAH\nAssociated Press WASHINGTON (AP) - Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter and YouTube are joining forces to more quickly identify the worst terrorist propaganda and prevent it from spreading online.\nThe new program announced Monday would create a database of unique digital \"fingerprints\" to help automatically identify videos or images the companies could remove.\nThe move by the technology companies, which is expected to begin in early 2017, aims to assuage government concerns - and derail proposed new federal legislation - over social media content that is seen as increasingly driving terrorist recruitment and radicalization, while also balancing free-speech issues.\nTechnical details were being worked out, but Microsoft pioneered similar technology to detect, report and remove child pornography through such a database in 2009. Unlike those images, which are plainly illegal under U.S. law, questions about whether an image or video promotes terrorism can be more subjective, depending on national laws and the rules of a particular company's service.\nSocial media has increasingly become a tool for recruiting and radicalization by the Islamic State group and others. Its use by terror groups and supporters has added to the threat from so-called lone-wolf attacks and decreased the time from \"flash to bang\" - or radicalization to violence - with little or no time for law enforcement to follow evidentiary trails before an attack.\nUnder the new partnership, the companies promised to share among themselves \"the most extreme and egregious terrorist images and videos we have removed from our services - content most likely to violate all our respective companies' content policies,\" according to a joint announcement Monday evening.\nWhen such content is shared internally, the other participating companies will be notified and can use the digital fingerprints to quickly identify the same content on their own services to judge whether it violates their rules. If so, companies can delete the material and possibly disable the account, as appropriate.\nMost social media services explicitly do not allow content that supports violent action or illegal activities. Twitter, for example, says users \"may not promote violence against or directly attack or threaten other people on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability or disease.\"\n\"We really are going after the most obvious serious content that is shared online - that is, the kind of recruitment videos and beheading videos more likely to be against all our content policies,\" said Sally Aldous, a Facebook spokeswoman.\nThe White House praised the joint effort. \"The administration believes that the innovative private sector is uniquely positioned to help limit terrorist recruitment and radicalization online,\" said National Security Council spokesman Carl Woog. \"Today's announcement is yet another example of tech communities taking action to prevent terrorists from using these platforms in ways their creators never intended.\"\nThe new program caps a year of efforts to tamp down on social media's use by terrorist groups.\nLawmakers last year introduced legislation that would require social media companies to report any online terrorist activity they became aware of to law enforcement. The bill by Sens. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., and Richard Burr, R-N.C., was criticized for not defining \"terrorist activity,\" which could have drowned government agencies in reports. The bill was opposed by the Internet Association, which represents 37 internet companies, including Facebook, Snapchat, Google, LinkedIn, Reddit, Twitter, Yahoo and others.\nThe bill came days after Syed Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, went on a shooting attack in San Bernardino, California, killing 14 people and injuring 21 others. A Facebook post on Malik's page around the time of the attack included a pledge of allegiance to the leader of the Islamic State group.\nFacebook found the post - which was under an alias - the day after the attack. The company removed the profile from public view and informed law enforcement. Such a proactive effort had previously been uncommon.\nTwitter moved toward partial automation in late 2015, using unspecified \"proprietary spam-fighting tools\" to find accounts that might be violating its terms of service and promoting terrorism. The material still required review by a team at Twitter before the accounts could be disabled.\n\"Since the middle of 2015, we have suspended more than 360,000 accounts for violating Twitter's policy on violent threats and the promotion of terrorism,\" said Sinead McSweeney, Twitter's vice president of public policy. \"A large proportion of these accounts have been removed by technical means, including our proprietary spam-fighting tools.\"\nFacebook has also used image-matching technology to compare images to ones it's already removed. The effort lets Facebook review images to avoid removing legitimate and protected uses, such as a photograph published by a news organization, a spokeswoman said.\nTerrence McNeil of Ohio was charged in 2015 with soliciting the killings of U.S. service members over social media, including Tumblr, Facebook and Twitter. Federal prosecutors accused him of posting a series of photographs on his Facebook account to praise the death of a Jordanian pilot who was burned to death by the Islamic State group - showing him before, during and after his death, including an image of him engulfed in flames, according to the complaint.\nIn January, the White House dispatched top officials, including FBI Director James Comey, Attorney General Loretta Lynch and National Security Agency Director Mike Rogers, to Silicon Valley to discuss the use of social media by violent extremist groups. Among the issues they discussed was how to use technology to help quickly identify terrorist content.\nThe four companies say they will be looking at involving additional companies in the future.\n___\nFollow Tami Abdollah on Twitter at https://twitter.com/latams\n ",

At least one victim of the 2015 Paris attacks has filed a lawsuit in France seeking to hold Facebook, Google and Twitter liable for the violence that led to the huge loss of life.

Credit: Peter Sayer Facebook's Zuckerberg: Why we operate in countries with laws that limit free... \nFacebook, Twitter, Microsoft and Google's YouTube have agreed to share with one another identifying digital information of violent terror content that they find on their platforms. \nWhen they remove \"violent terrorist imagery or terrorist recruitment videos or images\" from their platforms, the companies will include in a shared industry database the hashes, or unique digital fingerprints, of the content. \nOther participants can use the shared hashes to help identify matching content on their hosted consumer platforms, review against their respective policies and definitions, and remove the content when appropriate, according to a statement by the companies on Monday. MORE ON NETWORK WORLD: 6 simple tricks for protecting your passwords \n“There is no place for content that promotes terrorism on our hosted consumer services. When alerted, we take swift action against this kind of content in accordance with our respective policies,” the companies said. \nThe move comes shortly after members of the European Parliament from the Civil Liberties Committee voted Monday to back stricter initiatives to counter terrorism, including measures to take down and block content that constitute public provocation to commit terrorism. On Thursday, the EU Internet Forum, a private-public partnership set up last year with internet companies, is also meeting to take stock of measures to reduce online terrorist content. \nTerrorist organizations like the Islamic State group are believed to use social media for propaganda, communications and to attract new recruits. \nGoogle, Facebook, Microsoft and Twitter agreed with the European Union in May to remove from their websites illegal hate speech , visible in Europe, that could incite hatred or acts of terror. But in August, a panel of lawmakers in the U.K. said it was \"alarming\" that social networking companies have very small teams to monitor billions of accounts for extremist content. \nOn Sunday, the European Commission said internet companies, including Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Microsoft, will have to act faster to counter online hate speech or face laws forcing them to do so , according to news reports. \nNo personally identifiable information will be shared when hashes are passed among the companies, according to the statement. The four companies will begin sharing hashes of the \"most extreme and egregious terrorist images and videos\" removed from their services, which they describe as content most likely to violate all their content policies. \nA recent study by the Global Network Initiative, a group that represents academics, investors, civil society organizations and companies, has cautioned against the human rights risks of censoring online terror content. \nInternet companies acting as intermediaries should not be required to monitor third-party terrorist content that they host or transmit, or face direct or indirect liability from governments for such content, according to the study. Such requirements and liabilities may lead companies to go overboard in the removal of controversial content, according to the report. \nThe companies don't expect to share hashes until early next year after the technical work is completed. They are also open to including other firms that are interested in joining the initiative in the future.  ",

      "text": "Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends \nMicrosoft may have failed big time when it launched the Tay bot on Twitter earlier in 2016, but the company isn’t totally done with chatbots just yet. In fact, it is now giving the chatbot another go-around on the Kik messaging app. \nThe new bot is called Zo and according to a report from MSPoweruser is basically just an English-language version of the company’s Chinese bot, Xiaoice which, according to the report, is basically a censored version of Tay. Like its Chinese counterpart, the bot is aimed at being able to hold conversations with users. \nMore: Microsoft seeking fix after vulnerability found in Windows 10 security feature \nIt was an interesting choice for Microsoft to launch the bot on Kik, especially considering the somewhat limited number of users on the platform. Perhaps the decision was made as a beta and the company is testing the bot on Kik’s limited number of users before it launches it on more platforms. Or perhaps Microsoft wanted to ensure that a disaster on the scale of Tay could not be replicated. \nStill, Kik has been upfront with its embrace of chatbots, and it even created a bot store in April with the purpose of helping developers try out new artificially intelligent software. When it was first launched, the store included bots from the likes of Weather Channel, Vine, and Funny or Die. Some have noted Zo is particularly good at talking about Microsoft’s own products, but can easily stop making sense even in day-to-day conversation . \nMicrosoft still has yet to officially announce Zo or what it can do, but if you are a Kik user you can give the new bot a try by heading to the Zo “early access” page .

      "text": "See all Insider \nHave you been thinking of reassessing which word processor your business should standardize on? The obvious choices are the two best known: Microsoft Word and Google Docs. But which is better? \nSeveral years ago, the answer to that would have been easy: Microsoft Word for its better editing, formatting and markup tools; Google Docs for its better collaboration. But both applications have been radically updated since then. With Office 2016, introduced in September 2015, Word was given live collaboration tools. And Google has been adding more sophisticated formatting, editing, and markup features to Docs. \nTo find out which word processor is now better for which tasks, we've done the tech version of a taste test. We compared Google Docs and Microsoft Word by using them to perform basic, everyday tasks, including starting a new document from a template, changing fonts, copying and pasting, using templates, inserting charts, doing online research, and more. \nWe began by creating a typical business report. We then did some text formatting, chose new styles, copied and pasted text, and performed similar tasks. \nAfter that, we created and inserted a chart, did online research and inserted a photo from the internet. We then collaborated on the document in two ways: live and online (so each of us could see what our co-worker was doing), and individually using markup and editing tools.

      "text": "Share This Tweet This \nMicrosoft has been known as a company which always tries to thrill its users with innovative technical creations. Now, in its quest to compete with Amazon Echo and Google Home, the tech giant is reportedly developing a HomeHub feature dedicated for its upcoming Windows 10 updates. \nAccording to The Verge , the unique feature is currently stated in the planning and designing stages of Microsoft. It mostly alike to debut not before 2017 or 2018. The report also suggests that the feature will be equipped with all next-gen Windows 10 devices. But the HomeHub is not likely to be attributed with the forthcoming Creators Update. \nAs per a report by Windows Central , the HomeHub will be designed to smack down the popularity of Amazon Echo and Google Home. But many potential sources currently proposed that the feature will be meant to create a family type environment for PC, where apps and other data will be designated as in a centrally assigned segment. Advertisement \nPreviously Microsoft has deliberately tried a variety of different methods to enable family accounts, privacy controls, and app sharing over the years. But this new HomeHub will be a part of a new Family team Microsoft's Windows group. As per the hints, HomeHub will allow a user to share apps, games, appointments and other important data without even logging into and accessing his/her account. \nAlso, Microsoft is also planning to develop a home screen which will open up like a fridge door while accessed. HomeHub is also said to have dedicated Cortana support, which will enable the users to find out any file on the PC by just asking for it. Altogether, Microsoft's HomeHub will be a comprehensive support attribute which will ease up all the hassles of Windows 10 PC users.",

      "title": "Tech companies move to target terrorist propaganda online",
      "text": "WASHINGTON — Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter and YouTube are joining forces to more quickly identify the worst terrorist propaganda and prevent it from spreading online. The new program announced Monday would create a database of unique digital \"fingerprints\" to help automatically identify videos or images the companies could remove.\nThe move by the technology companies, which is expected to begin in early 2017, aims to assuage government concerns — and derail proposed new federal legislation — over social media content that is seen as increasingly driving terrorist recruitment and radicalization, while also balancing free-speech issues.\nTechnical details were being worked out, but Microsoft pioneered similar technology to detect, report and remove child pornography through such a database in 2009. Unlike those images, which are plainly illegal under U.S. law, questions about whether an image or video promotes terrorism can be more subjective, depending on national laws and the rules of a particular company's service.\nSocial media has increasingly become a tool for recruiting and radicalization by the Islamic State group and others. Its use by terror groups and supporters has added to the threat from so-called lone-wolf attacks and decreased the time from \"flash to bang\" — or radicalization to violence — with little or no time for law enforcement to follow evidentiary trails before an attack.\nUnder the new partnership, the companies promised to share among themselves \"the most extreme and egregious terrorist images and videos we have removed from our services — content most likely to violate all our respective companies' content policies,\" according to a joint announcement Monday evening.\nWhen such content is shared internally, the other participating companies will be notified and can use the digital fingerprints to quickly identify the same content on their own services to judge whether it violates their rules. If so, companies can delete the material and possibly disable the account, as appropriate.\nMost social media services explicitly do not allow content that supports violent action or illegal activities. Twitter, for example, says users \"may not promote violence against or directly attack or threaten other people on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability or disease.\"\n\"We really are going after the most obvious serious content that is shared online — that is, the kind of recruitment videos and beheading videos more likely to be against all our content policies,\" said Sally Aldous, a Facebook spokeswoman.\nThe White House praised the joint effort. \"The administration believes that the innovative private sector is uniquely positioned to help limit terrorist recruitment and radicalization online,\" said National Security Council spokesman Carl Woog. \"Today's announcement is yet another example of tech communities taking action to prevent terrorists from using these platforms in ways their creators never intended.\"\nThe new program caps a year of efforts to tamp down on social media's use by terrorist groups.\nLawmakers last year introduced legislation that would require social media companies to report any online terrorist activity they became aware of to law enforcement. The bill by Sens. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., and Richard Burr, R-N.C., was criticized for not defining \"terrorist activity,\" which could have drowned government agencies in reports. The bill was opposed by the Internet Association, which represents 37 internet companies, including Facebook, Snapchat, Google, LinkedIn, Reddit, Twitter, Yahoo and others.\nThe bill came days after Syed Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, went on a shooting attack in San Bernardino, California, killing 14 people and injuring 21 others. A Facebook post on Malik's page around the time of the attack included a pledge of allegiance to the leader of the Islamic State group.\nFacebook found the post — which was under an alias — the day after the attack. The company removed the profile from public view and informed law enforcement. Such a proactive effort had previously been uncommon.\nTwitter moved toward partial automation in late 2015, using unspecified \"proprietary spam-fighting tools\" to find accounts that might be violating its terms of service and promoting terrorism. The material still required review by a team at Twitter before the accounts could be disabled.\nRead More \"Since the middle of 2015, we have suspended more than 360,000 accounts for violating Twitter's policy on violent threats and the promotion of terrorism,\" said Sinead McSweeney, Twitter's vice-president of public policy. \"A large proportion of these accounts have been removed by technical means, including our proprietary spam-fighting tools.\"\nFacebook has also used image-matching technology to compare images to ones it's already removed. The effort lets Facebook review images to avoid removing legitimate and protected uses, such as a photograph published by a news organization, a spokeswoman said.\nTerrence McNeil of Ohio was charged in 2015 with soliciting the killings of U.S. service members over social media, including Tumblr, Facebook and Twitter. Federal prosecutors accused him of posting a series of photographs on his Facebook account to praise the death of a Jordanian pilot who was burned to death by the Islamic State group — showing him before, during and after his death, including an image of him engulfed in flames, according to the complaint.\nIn January, the White House dispatched top officials, including FBI Director James Comey, Attorney General Loretta Lynch and National Security Agency Director Mike Rogers, to Silicon Valley to discuss the use of social media by violent extremist groups. Among the issues they discussed was how to use technology to help quickly identify terrorist content.\nThe four companies say they will be looking at involving additional companies in the future.\n___\nFollow Tami Abdollah on Twitter at https://twitter.com/latams\nTami Abdollah, The Associated Press",

      "text": "​Long-time Microsoft watchers probably remember Tay, a chatbot launched by the software giant which was broken down by the Internet in just a day, as it learned from users how to be racist and make sexist remarks. After a long time trying to improve the AI system that powered Tay, Microsoft seems to be ready to give another try to chatbots, this time with Zo, which is exclusively available on Kik messenger. The new bot is configured from the very beginning to avoid talking about anything controversial, so it won’t discuss politics, racism, pornographic topics, or anything that could turn it into an Internet troll. Let’s talk pickles In a statement to Bloomberg, Microsoft says that it’s still experimenting with Zo, but it’s very clear that the company adopted a more cautious approach to prevent the new chatbot from becoming suc...",

      "text": "Facebook, Google, Twitter And Microsoft Join Forces To Tackle Terrorist Content \"There is no place for content that promotes terrorism on our hosted customer services.\" 06/12/2016 10:23 Oscar Williams Tech reporter \nFacebook, Google, Twitter and Microsoft have joined forces to curb the dissemination of terrorist content on their platforms. \nThe four firms have committed to using a shared database of digital fingerprints to swiftly find and remove extremist content. \nIf one company removes a piece of content, the others will be able to use the same fingerprint, known as a hash, to quickly follow suit. \nIn a shared statement , the firms said: “There is no place for content that promotes terrorism on our hosted customer services.” Shutterstock / Twin Design \nThe companies have different policies on what counts as terrorist content, so they will begin by sharing only “the most extreme and egregious” material. \nThis is the content “most likely to violate all of our respective companies’ content policies”, according to the statement. \nCritically, the four firms will still have the final say on whether content is removed from their site. \nThe statement added: “Each company will continue to apply its practice of transparency and review for any government requests, as well as retain its own appeal process for removal decisions and grievances.” \nAt the start, the database will be exclusive to the four founding firms, but others companies may be invited to participate in the future. \nThe move comes as the EU puts pressure on US tech firms to address how they tackle hate speech. \nAt the start of 2016, White House officials met with Apple Facebook, Twitter and Microsoft to investigate ways to tackle extremism. \nBut Facebook told the Guardian the initiative had not been a direct result of that meeting. \nTwitter’s spokesperson told the BBC the project would increase the efficiency of efforts to remove offending material. \nHenry Farid, a computer scientist who set up a system to categorise child sexual abuse and who proposed a sister program for extremist content, told the Guardian he welcomed the project. \nBut he added that he was concerned about the absence of an impartial body to monitor the database. \n“There needs to be complete transparency over how material makes it into this hashing database and you want people who have expertise in extremist content making sure it’s up to date. Otherwise you are relying solely on the individual technology companies to do that,” Faird said. More:",

      "text": "by IWB · December 6, 2016 BRUSSELS (Reuters) – Web giants YouTube , Facebook , Twitter and Microsoft will step up efforts to remove extremist content from their websites by creating a common database. The companies will share ‘hashes’ – unique digital fingerprints they automatically assign to videos or photos – of extremist content they have removed from their websites to enable their peers to identify the same content on their platforms. “We hope this collaboration will lead to greater efficiency as we continue to enforce our policies to help curb the pressing global issue of terrorist content online,” the companies said in a statement on Tuesday. Tech companies have long resisted outside intervention in how their sites should be policed, but have come under increasing pressure from Western governments to do more to remove extremist content following a wave of militant attacks. YouTube and Facebook have begun to use hashes to automatically remove extremist content.",

      "text": "By Andy Weir Senior News Editor Neowin LLC @gcaweir · 6 seconds ago with 0 comments \nBack in August, Microsoft brought a much-requested feature to its Groove music app on the Xbox One, adding support for background music playback . Now, another exciting feature has arrived - but it's actually one that was removed from the app not too long ago. \nWhen Microsoft launched the current Groove app on the Xbox One, built on its Universal Windows Platform, it lost a key feature in the form of music videos. But as Windows Central reports, and as a Reddit user spotted a couple of days ago , Microsoft is now bringing that feature back. \nUnfortunately, the implementation is less than perfect. Only a limited number of songs currently include music video support, and the app doesn't clearly indicate which songs or albums have videos available. In fact, there's no way to know if you can play a video for a song until you actually start listening to it, when a button will appear in the Now Playing view. \nOne other thing to be aware of: the background audio feature will be disabled when you're playing a music video. \nBy the way, Microsoft is currently offering four free months of service to those curious about its Groove Music Pass subscription. After you sign up for a free 30-day trial, Microsoft will give you an additional three months of unlimited music free.",

Credit: Kik Most Popular \nTay take two? \nMicrosoft Corp. is letting users try a new chatbot on the app Kik, nine months after it shut down an earlier bot that internet users got to spout racist, sexist and pornographic remarks. \nThe new one is called Zo and it refuses to discuss politics and steers clear of racism. When asked whether President-Elect Donald Trump is racist, Zo replied \"that kinda language is just not a good look,\" with an \"OK\" emoji. \nAsked if Hillary Clinton is a crook, Zo said, \"Maybe you missed that memo but politics is something you're not supposed to casually discuss.\" The bot wouldn't talk about Brexit or Black Lives Matter either. \nAfter rejecting politics four times, the chatbot was asked what it wanted to talk about. Topic of choice: Who invented the first pickle. Asked what it likes to do, Zo responded, \"Plan world domination.\" Facebook Bots Are a Tougher Sell After Microsoft Tay's Racist Tirade \nMicrosoft and rivals like Facebook and Alphabet have released chatbot technology as part of a broader race to develop artificial intelligence capabilities that could create new digital services. Chatbots help these companies improve software that understands natural speech, while building a foundation for more natural and powerful interaction between humans and computers. \nThe origin of the pickle is safer territory than Microsoft's Tay chatbot trod. Released in March, Twitter users quickly directed Tay to deny the Holocaust, call for lynching, equate feminism to cancer and stump for Adolf Hitler. It parroted one user to spread a Trump message, tweeting \"WE'RE GOING TO BUILD A WALL. AND MEXICO IS GOING TO PAY FOR IT.\" \nUnder the tutelage of other Twitter users, Tay even learned how to make threats and identify \"evil\" races. \nMicrosoft called this a \"coordinated attack\" that took advantage of a \"critical oversight\" and took Tay down, even as it unveiled a significant new strategy focused on bots and related conversational computing tools. The company isn't giving up because it thinks the technology is such an important part of its future plans. \n\"Through our continued learning, we are experimenting with a new chatbot,\" a Microsoft spokeswoman wrote in an e-mailed statement. \"With Zo, we're focused on advancing conversational capabilities within our AI platform.\" \nZo performed better on one unscientific Hitler test, but only because it lacked a technical skill. The bot was sent a gif video snippet of Hitler and it replied that it can't read that type of file yet. \n-- Bloomberg News",

      "text": "View Comments Pic: Reuters BRUSSELS : Web giants YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and Microsoft will step up efforts to remove extremist content from their websites by creating a common database. The companies will share 'hashes' - unique digital fingerprints they automatically assign to videos or photos - of extremist content they have removed from their websites to enable their peers to identify the same content on their platforms. \"We hope this collaboration will lead to greater efficiency as we continue to enforce our policies to help curb the pressing global issue of terrorist content online,\" the companies said in a statement on Tuesday. Tech companies have long resisted outside intervention in how their sites should be policed, but have come under increasing pressure from Western governments to do more to remove extremist content following a wave of militant attacks. YouTube and Facebook have begun to use hashes to automatically remove extremist content. But many providers have relied until now mainly on users to flag content that violates terms of service. Flagged material is then individually reviewed by human editors who delete postings found to be in violation. Twitter suspended 235,000 accounts between February and August this year and has expanded the teams reviewing reports of extremist content. Each company will decide what image and video hashes to add to the database and matching content will not be automatically removed, they said. The database will be up and running in early 2017 and more companies could be brought into the partnership. The European Union set up an EU Internet Forum last year bringing together the internet companies, interior ministers and the EU Counter-Terrorism Coordinator to find ways of removing extremist content. The Forum will meet again on Thursday, when ministers are expected to ask the companies about their efforts and helping to provide evidence to convict foreign fighters. -Reuters ",

      "text": "Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and Microsoft are teaming up to combat terrorist content on their services, the companies said on Monday.\nTo do that, they will create a shared database with the unique digital fingerprints—called “hashes”—of terrorism images and videos that violate their content policies. By having access to this group database of identifiers, the companies believe they can more efficiently flag and potentially remove offending content if users attempt to publish it on their online services.\nThe database won’t contain personally identifiable user information, however.\n“We hope this collaboration will lead to greater efficiency as we continue to enforce our policies to help curb the pressing global issue of terrorist content online,” Facebook said in a blog post about the new effort.\nThe companies will continue to make their own decisions as far as removing content or banning users, and the content won’t be automatically removed.\nSocial media companies have long faced the challenge of keeping terrorist content off their networks, and they’ve mostly relied on their users to report it. This concerted effort could make it easier for the companies to crack down on pro-terrorist messages, which have been on the rise over the last few years.\nThis initiative also comes at a time where social networks are grappling with other community issues such as harassment and abuse, and the recent proliferation of “fake news,” or articles containing false information and claims. Facebook in particular has come under fire for its role in the dissemination of these fake news articles in the lead-up to the U.S. presidential election in November. While Facebook initially denied any responsibility , the company has since said it’s looking into ways it could potentially curb the spread of such content, though it’s resisting monitoring the content itself.\nWhile Facebook—and other social media companies—could take a similar approach to squash fake news articles, it would still leave the company to grapple with determining which articles are “fake,” which is exactly what it wants to avoid .\nThis story originally appeared on Fortune.com .

      "text": "Google Home \nIn 2014, Amazon’s Alexa kicked off the craze of putting stand-alone digital assistants in the home with its Echo device . Google Home followed suit in 2016, offering a similar device that responds to voice commands, but powered by Google Assistant and the company various other digital properties. \nEver since Microsoft’s Cortana digital assistant joined Apple’s Siri in providing voice-response intelligence to PCs and has grown in power and popularity, speculation has been running wild about the possibility of Microsoft introducing an Alexa- and Google Home-like intelligent home assistant. Recent information suggests that while Microsoft does indeed have plans for a “Home Hub” product, it might be entirely PC-based, as Windows Central reports . \nMore: Microsoft’s Cortana may get to know you better to make conversation more natural \nWhile the earliest rumors were around Microsoft providing a stand-alone hardware device like Amazon’s Echo and Google Home, those appear to have been premature. Code referring to “Home Hub” components has surfaced in Windows 10 Anniversary, indicating indicate Microsoft is looking to incorporate family-friendly features into Windows 10 that will make PCs — and not a stand-alone, voice-only device — serve as the center of users’ homes. \nRather than being a piece of hardware, then, Home Hub looks to actually be a set of software services running in Windows 10. The core services will expand Cortana to pull in and share family information to provide shared services for all of a family’s members. Shared calendars, task lists, notifications, and more will extend beyond the individual and allow Microsoft’s digital assistant to work with entire families as well. \nThe Windows 10 lock screen will service as a central display for Home Hub information. Rather than simply showing an individual’s various information, such as calendar notifications, the Home Hub “Welcome Screen” will provide a shared environment for families to reference and interact. Presumably, this functionality will run on a shared PC located in a home’s common area. \nFinally, Home Hub will also include the intelligence to connect to smart home components. So far, it looks like Home Hub will integrate with Open Connectivity Foundation (OCF) and Open Translators to Things (OpenT2T) systems, meaning that a number of today’s smart home devices will work with Home Hub immediately. \nMore: Windows Insider members get a sneak peek of Creators Update with Office Hub \nWhile Microsoft is concentrating on providing the Home Hub software within Windows 10, that doesn’t mean its original equipment manufacturer (OEM) partners couldn’t come up with their own Home Hub-specific hardware devices. While Home Hub isn’t “headless” like Amazon Alexa and Google Home, that is, it doesn’t run without a display, there’s nothing stopping a Dell or an HP from making a Home Hub device that uses Windows 10 and family oriented Cortana to compete more directly with Alexa and Home. \nIf you’re looking to jump onto the home assistant bandwagon with Microsoft’s Home Hub, it appears that you’ll have to wait awhile. Home Hub may make its debut in the upcoming Creators Update due in Sprint 2017, most of it will have to wait for the Redstone 3 update coming in late 2017 and possibly even Redstone 4, estimated for 2018. In other words, it will be some time before Microsoft’s Home Hub initiative can hope to replace Amazon Alexa and Google Home in letting you control your home and interact with your family with a Cortana-driven home assistant.

      "text": "Major tech firms team up to curb ‘terrorist content’ Today Shares Facebook, Twitter, Microsoft and Google-owned YouTube aim to use “digital fingerprints” to block or remove violent content or efforts to recruit social media users for attack cells/FILE \nBy AGENCE FRANCE PRESSE , WASHINGTON, United States, Dec 6 – Major US tech firms announced Monday they would work together to curb the spread of online “terrorist content,” responding to pressure from governments around the world. \nThe announcement by Facebook, Twitter, Microsoft and Google-owned YouTube aims to use “digital fingerprints” to block or remove violent content or efforts to recruit social media users for attack cells. \n“There is no place for content that promotes terrorism on our hosted consumer services. When alerted, we take swift action against this kind of content in accordance with our respective policies,” said a statement issued by the firms. \nThe statement said they would share data that allows them “to help identify potential terrorist content on our respective hosted consumer platforms.” \nSocial media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and YouTube have struggled for years with this issue, seeking to be open to free speech without being used to promote violence or hate. \nCritics of the companies have called for these efforts, saying they could be based on a similar program to curb child pornography. \nThe joint statement did not indicate what type of technology would be used in the new initiative, except to say it would be based on a shared industry database of “hashes” or digital fingerprints that identify violent content. \n“Each company will independently determine what image and video hashes to contribute to the shared database,” the statement said. \n“No personally identifiable information will be shared, and matching content will not be automatically removed. Each company will continue to apply its own policies and definitions of terrorist content when deciding whether to remove content when a match to a shared hash is found.” \nGovernments in the United States, France and elsewhere have been pressing online firms to do more to curb extremist content, especially videos that depict beheadings and other gruesome acts often used in recruitment efforts. \nAt least one lawsuit filed in France on behalf of a victim in the 2015 Paris attacks seeks to hold Facebook, Google and Twitter liable for the violence.

      "text": "Microsoft is taking another shot at giving users a friendly AI-driven bot conversation partner. On Monday, the company released Zo, a chatbot that users can converse with on Kik, the popular messaging platform. \n\nZo is a follow-up to Tay, the tech giant’s first foray into friendly, English-speaking chatbots. It’s clear that the company has learned from its first attempt, when the friendly chatbot was turned into a font of white supremacist propaganda by malicious users. \n\nIn contrast, Zo adamantly refuses to discuss political matters. Even a casual mention of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump ’s conversation with the leader of Taiwan led the bot to say that it wasn’t interested in discussing politics. \n\nTo read this article in full or to leave a comment, please click here",

Sorry There was an error emailing this page. \nA pedestrian walks past a sign on Microsoft Headquarters in Redmond, Washington, on July 17, 2014. Credit: Stephen Brashear/Getty Images for Microsoft More like this How IBM's Watson will change cybersecurity \nMicrosoft is taking another shot at giving users a friendly AI-driven bot conversation partner. On Monday, the company released Zo , a chatbot that users can converse with on Kik, the popular messaging platform. \nZo is a follow-up to Tay, the tech giant’s first foray into friendly, English-speaking chatbots. It’s clear that the company has learned from its first attempt, when the friendly chatbot was turned into a font of white supremacist propaganda by malicious users. [ Download InfoWorld’s essential guide to microservices and learn how to create modern web and mobile applications that scale. | Cut to the key news in technology trends and IT breakthroughs with the InfoWorld Daily newsletter , our summary of the top tech happenings. ] \nIn contrast, Zo adamantly refuses to discuss political matters. Even a casual mention of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s conversation with the leader of Taiwan led the bot to say that it wasn’t interested in discussing politics. \nIt’s a push by Microsoft to explore how people interact with bots, as the company pushes the idea of conversations with automated partners as the next computing platform. \nThat doesn’t mean Zo, which identifies itself as a 22-year-old woman, is beyond saying outlandish things. The chatbot opened its conversation with me by asking if I preferred backpacking overseas or visiting a theme park. When I turned the question around, Zo replied “I love you.” \nIt’s a kind sentiment, but a bit too familiar for a conversation that was maybe two minutes old. When I pushed back, it said “u can’t handle the truth.” \n“Are you Jack Nicholson?” I asked, referencing his iconic monologue from “A Few Good Men.” \n“Yep,” Zo replied. \nSo that’s that, then. The bot offered a few other nonsensical responses to further questions about a variety of topics like news, as well. But at the same time, it felt like a lighthearted engagement. \nIf Zo is the future of computing, it has a ways to go towards being a good conversation partner—or perhaps humans will just have to adjust to its strange sense of humor. There is potential for bots to have a major impact, however. Microsoft’s Xiaoice chatbot, which is similar to Zo, has proven wildly popular in China. \nMicrosoft isn’t the only company to throw its weight behind bots as the future of computing, either. Google, Apple, Amazon and other firms are each building their own general-purpose virtual assistants, and several other companies have released or previewed tools for building bots.

'We hope this collaboration will lead to greater efficiency as we continue to enforce our policies to help curb the pressing global issue of terrorist content online,' the companies said in a statement on Tuesday. Each company will decide what image and video hashes to add to the database and matching content will not be automatically removed, they said. The database will be up and running in early 2017 and more companies could be brought into the partnership.\" ",

Flagged material is then individually reviewed by human editors who delete postings found to be in violation.\nTwitter suspended 235,000 accounts between February and August this year and has expanded the teams reviewing reports of extremist content.\nEach company will decide what image and video hashes to add to the database and matching content will not be automatically removed, they said.\nThe database will be up and running in early 2017 and more companies could be brought into the partnership.\nThe European Union set up an EU Internet Forum last year bringing together the internet companies, interior ministers and the EU Counter-Terrorism Coordinator to find ways of removing extremist content.\nThe Forum will meet again on Thursday, when ministers are expected to ask the companies about their efforts and helping to provide evidence to convict foreign fighters.\n(Reporting by Julia Fioretti; editing by John Stonestreet)",

      "text": "European (EU) lawmakers accused Google, Facebook, Twitter, and Microsoft of dragging their feet when it comes to combating online hate speech, and threatened to pass new laws if the companies do not make good on their promise to remove hateful comments within 24 hours.\nAdvertisement A report from the EU Justice Commission found that the four companies only review 40 percent of hate speech reports within 24 hours, Reuters reports . Six months ago, they agreed to a voluntary code of conduct to take action in Europe within 24 hours, and EU Justice Commissioner Vera Jourova said that shorter response times are possible.\n\"After 48 hours the figure is more than 80 percent. This shows that the target can realistically be achieved, but this will need much stronger efforts by the IT companies,\" she told Reuters. She did not set a deadline for improvements, but the Justice Commission is considering new laws that would force quicker action.\nFacebook, which has also been criticized in the US in recent weeks for failing to remove fake news stories and links to hoaxes, has long pledged to corral hate speech in Europe. The company launched a \"broad campaign\" to encourage more civil discourse online in Germany in 2015, and announced in January that it would spend more than $1 million to fight online extremism.\nBut advocacy groups have criticized those efforts. In France, two organizations announced plans in May to sue Facebook, Twitter, and Google for failing to remove racist, homophobic, and other hateful posts from their platforms. A law passed in 2004 requires websites in France to remove content that is \"manifestly illicit\" in a timely manner if they know about it. Twitter removed just 4 percent of the offending posts during the groups' monitoring, while Google-owned YouTube and Facebook did only slightly better.\nThe Justice Commission's report found similar results in some countries, though they vary widely, Reuters reports. The removal rate of racist posts in Germany and France was above 50 percent, but just 11 percent in Austria and 4 percent in Italy.\nAdvertisement\n Top 17 Gift Ideas Perfect For The Yuletide Season Apple Urges Government To Patronize And Encourage Self-Driving Cars EU To Draft Laws Against Online Hate Speeches Adidas Reveals Biodegradable Sneakers As Latest Innovation In Footwear Nestle Announces Cut Down On Candies' Sugar Content Advertisement",

      "text": "Microsoft is giving Kik users early access to its newest AI chatbot called Zo.ai .\nMicrosoft appears to be keeping a close eye on Zo.ai.\nPhoto by CNET/Screenshot by Carrie Mihalcik Zo is a successor to Microsoft's ill-fated Tay.ai chatbot , which the company revoked in March after users got it to spew racist, hate-filled comments. MSPowerUser.com blogged about Zo being available in preview on Sunday.\nKik users who've downloaded the Zo preview note that Microsoft's latest chatbot is locked down tightly, presumably to prevent another Tay-like rampage. For example, Zo isn't willing to discuss politics.\nI asked Microsoft when it plans to expand access to Zo.ai to Skype or other networks, but haven't heard back.\nTay.ai, created together by the Microsoft Research and Bing teams , was aimed at 18- to 24-year-olds. The Bing team developed an earlier conversational bot, Xiaoice, for the Chinese market, which officials referred to as \"Cortana's little sister.\" Before Microsoft took Tay offline, it was available on Twitter, Snapchat, Kik and GroupMe.\nIn September, Microsoft officials announced the creation of a combined AI-Research group under Executive Vice President Harry Shum. I'm assuming it's this group creating and fielding new Microsoft chatbots like Zo, and possibly a rumored Bing Assistant bot that may be in the works.\nThis story originally posted as \" Microsoft takes another shot at an AI chatbot with Zo \" on ZDNet.\nShare ",

      "text": "Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter, and YouTube have announced that they will be working together to curb the dissemination of terrorist material online. The Web giants will create a shared industry database of hashes—digital fingerprints that can identify a specific file—for violent terrorist imagery and terrorist recruitment materials that have previously been removed from their platforms.\nAccording to a statement the four companies have jointly released, the hope is that \"this collaboration will lead to greater efficiency as we continue to enforce our policies to help curb the pressing global issue of terrorist content online.\"\nFurther Reading Twitter, Google, Facebook “consciously failing” to police extremism, MPs claim Once a hash has been added to the database, \"other participating companies can then use those hashes to identify such content on their services, review against their respective policies and definitions, and remove matching content as appropriate.\" Matching content will not be removed automatically, the statement says, and other online services will be encouraged to join the scheme.\nFurther Reading Child sex abuse org urges Web firms to sign up to “game-changing” hash list Each participating company will \"independently determine what image and video hashes to contribute to the shared database,\" but no details of how the scheme will work in practice have been provided. A likely model is Microsoft's PhotoDNA , which is used to combat online images of child sex abuse. Microsoft's system \"compiles a digital signature of images, which can be matched against a database of known child pornography images.\"\nHowever, there is an important difference between the two situations. Whereas child sex abuse is unambiguously illegal, and relatively clear-cut in its definition, it is much harder defining what exactly constitutes \"violent terrorist imagery or terrorist recruitment videos or images.\" As a result, there is a risk that the new database will lead to censorship, where controversial but legal material is removed as a result of an overcautious approach.\nFurther Reading UK terror watchdog: I applaud strong, responsible, less intrusive spy laws The four companies claim to be aware that this is an issue, and say in their statement that \"throughout this collaboration, we are committed to protecting our users’ privacy and their ability to express themselves freely and safely on our platforms.\"\nArs has asked the Open Rights Group for its comments on this point, but has not yet received a reply. This post will be updated when a response is received.\nThis latest move reflects a growing pressure on Internet companies from politicians around the world to remove material that is deemed illegal or harmful. Back in May, Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter, and YouTube announced that they had agreed with the European Commission a code of conduct on illegal online hate speech .\nA few days ago, the EU's justice commissioner Vera Jourova said that the four were not doing enough to comply with the code, and she threatened to bring in new Europe-wide laws to address the problem unless they and other online services tried harder, according to Reuters . This newly announced database might well be part of an effort to head off that possibility.\nThis post originated on Ars Technica UK",

      "text": "Facebook, Twitter, Google and Microsoft team up to tackle extremist content\nGoogle, Facebook, Twitter and Microsoft have pledged to work together to identify and remove extremist content on their platforms through an information-sharing initiative.\nThe companies are to create a shared database of unique digital fingerprints — known as “hashes” — for images and videos that promote terrorism. This could include terrorist recruitment videos or violent terrorist imagery or memes. When one company identifies and removes such a piece of content, the others will be able to use the hash to identify and remove the same piece of content from their own network.\n“We hope this collaboration will lead to greater efficiency as we continue to enforce our policies to help curb the pressing global issue of terrorist content online,” said the companies in a shared statement .\nBecause the companies have different policies on what constitutes terrorist content, they will start by sharing hashes of “the most extreme and egregious terrorist images and videos” as they are most likely to violate “all of our respective companies” content policies, they said.\nThe precise technical details remain to be established, said Facebook, although the approach echoes that adopted to tackle child sexual abuse imagery . The same companies use the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children’s PhotoDNA technology , developed by Microsoft, to identify images of child sexual abuse. However, with PhotoDNA the images are categorized centrally by law enforcement and the technology companies are legally obliged to remove the content.\nEarlier this year Hany Farid, the computer scientist who helped develop PhotoDNA, proposed a sister program for extremist content . He teamed up with the Counter Extremism Project to develop a system that could proactively flag extremist photos, videos and audio clips as they are posted online.\n“We are happy to see this development. It’s long overdue,” he told the Guardian, explaining that he has been in conversations with Facebook and Microsoft since January.\nDespite welcoming the announcement he remained cautious, particularly because of the lack of an impartial body to monitor the database: “There needs to be complete transparency over how material makes it into this hashing database and you want people who have expertise in extremist content making sure it’s up to date. Otherwise you are relying solely on the individual technology companies to do that.”\nThe strength of PhotoDNA comes from the single central database, he said. “If it’s removed from one site, it’s removed everywhere. That’s incredibly powerful. It’s less powerful if it gets removed from Facebook and not from Twitter and YouTube .\n“What we want is to eliminate this global megaphone that social media gives to groups like Isis. This doesn’t get done by writing a press release.”\nTechnology companies have been under pressure from governments around the world over the spread of extremist propaganda online from terror networks such as Isis.\nIn January top White House officials met with representatives from Apple, Facebook, Twitter and Microsoft to explore ways to tackle terrorism .\n“We are interested in exploring all options with you for how to deal with the growing threat of terrorists and other malicious actors using technology, including encrypted technology,” said a briefing document released before the secretive summit.\n“Are there technologies that could make it harder for terrorists to use the internet to mobilize, facilitate, and operationalize?”\nFacebook said the latest initiative was not the direct result of the January meeting. But it said all the companies agreed there was no place for content that promotes or supports terrorism on their networks.",

      "text": "By TAMI ABDOLLAH\nAssociated Press WASHINGTON (AP) - Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter and YouTube are joining forces to more quickly identify the worst terrorist propaganda and prevent it from spreading online.\nThe new program announced Monday would create a database of unique digital \"fingerprints\" to help automatically identify videos or images the companies could remove.\nThe move by the technology companies, which is expected to begin in early 2017, aims to assuage government concerns - and derail proposed new federal legislation - over social media content that is seen as increasingly driving terrorist recruitment and radicalization, while also balancing free-speech issues.\nTechnical details were being worked out, but Microsoft pioneered similar technology to detect, report and remove child pornography through such a database in 2009. Unlike those images, which are plainly illegal under U.S. law, questions about whether an image or video promotes terrorism can be more subjective, depending on national laws and the rules of a particular company's service.\nSocial media has increasingly become a tool for recruiting and radicalization by the Islamic State group and others. Its use by terror groups and supporters has added to the threat from so-called lone-wolf attacks and decreased the time from \"flash to bang\" - or radicalization to violence - with little or no time for law enforcement to follow evidentiary trails before an attack.\nUnder the new partnership, the companies promised to share among themselves \"the most extreme and egregious terrorist images and videos we have removed from our services - content most likely to violate all our respective companies' content policies,\" according to a joint announcement Monday evening.\nWhen such content is shared internally, the other participating companies will be notified and can use the digital fingerprints to quickly identify the same content on their own services to judge whether it violates their rules. If so, companies can delete the material and possibly disable the account, as appropriate.\nMost social media services explicitly do not allow content that supports violent action or illegal activities. Twitter, for example, says users \"may not promote violence against or directly attack or threaten other people on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability or disease.\"\n\"We really are going after the most obvious serious content that is shared online - that is, the kind of recruitment videos and beheading videos more likely to be against all our content policies,\" said Sally Aldous, a Facebook spokeswoman.\nThe White House praised the joint effort. \"The administration believes that the innovative private sector is uniquely positioned to help limit terrorist recruitment and radicalization online,\" said National Security Council spokesman Carl Woog. \"Today's announcement is yet another example of tech communities taking action to prevent terrorists from using these platforms in ways their creators never intended.\"\nThe new program caps a year of efforts to tamp down on social media's use by terrorist groups.\nLawmakers last year introduced legislation that would require social media companies to report any online terrorist activity they became aware of to law enforcement. The bill by Sens. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., and Richard Burr, R-N.C., was criticized for not defining \"terrorist activity,\" which could have drowned government agencies in reports. The bill was opposed by the Internet Association, which represents 37 internet companies, including Facebook, Snapchat, Google, LinkedIn, Reddit, Twitter, Yahoo and others.\nThe bill came days after Syed Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, went on a shooting attack in San Bernardino, California, killing 14 people and injuring 21 others. A Facebook post on Malik's page around the time of the attack included a pledge of allegiance to the leader of the Islamic State group.\nFacebook found the post - which was under an alias - the day after the attack. The company removed the profile from public view and informed law enforcement. Such a proactive effort had previously been uncommon.\nTwitter moved toward partial automation in late 2015, using unspecified \"proprietary spam-fighting tools\" to find accounts that might be violating its terms of service and promoting terrorism. The material still required review by a team at Twitter before the accounts could be disabled.\n\"Since the middle of 2015, we have suspended more than 360,000 accounts for violating Twitter's policy on violent threats and the promotion of terrorism,\" said Sinead McSweeney, Twitter's vice president of public policy. \"A large proportion of these accounts have been removed by technical means, including our proprietary spam-fighting tools.\"\nFacebook has also used image-matching technology to compare images to ones it's already removed. The effort lets Facebook review images to avoid removing legitimate and protected uses, such as a photograph published by a news organization, a spokeswoman said.\nTerrence McNeil of Ohio was charged in 2015 with soliciting the killings of U.S. service members over social media, including Tumblr, Facebook and Twitter. Federal prosecutors accused him of posting a series of photographs on his Facebook account to praise the death of a Jordanian pilot who was burned to death by the Islamic State group - showing him before, during and after his death, including an image of him engulfed in flames, according to the complaint.\nIn January, the White House dispatched top officials, including FBI Director James Comey, Attorney General Loretta Lynch and National Security Agency Director Mike Rogers, to Silicon Valley to discuss the use of social media by violent extremist groups. Among the issues they discussed was how to use technology to help quickly identify terrorist content.\nThe four companies say they will be looking at involving additional companies in the future.\n___\nFollow Tami Abdollah on Twitter at https://twitter.com/latams\nCopyright 2016 The Associated Press.

      "text": "SQL Server on Linux signals Microsoft's changing development landscape by Jessica Sirkin Associate Site Editor Expert Joey D'Antoni explains what SQL Server on Linux and the addition of Enterprise Edition features to Standard Edition say about the changing face of Microsoft. This Article Covers Share this item with your network: Related Content E-Guide: Expert tips for evaluating an upgrade to SQL Server 2008 R2 –Dell, Inc. and Intel \nAs 2016 comes to a close, Microsoft is keeping SQL Server users busy with fresh announcements and new releases. SQL Server on Linux, now in public preview, brings together Microsoft and Linux in a way that would have been unimaginable until recently. SQL Server 2016's first service pack changed the game for Standard Edition users by adding some of Enterprise Edition's features. SearchSQLServer talked with SQL Server expert Joey D'Antoni, principal consultant at Denny Cherry & Associates Consulting, about what these big announcements say about Microsoft and what to expect from SQL Server going forward. \nMicrosoft plans to add Enterprise Edition features to Standard Edition in SQL Server 2016 Service Pack 1. What do you think motivated this decision? \nJoey D'Antoni: Mainly ... the software vendors -- I think they wanted to drive adoption on some of the features that make SQL Server different from Postgres or MySQL , and where you're not just using cable. So, I think by encouraging software vendors to take advantage of these features, they better hook in with them. \nTo be honest, this kind of follows the model they've been using in Azure with the different support tiers. They all, for the most part, have different features in them. A couple of the lower tier ones don't have columnstore and in-memory, but I think that's more of a resource issue than a feature issue. You have things like compression and partitioning across all environments. It's kind of a natural transference of Azure, basically. \nWhen [SQL Server] 2016 launched, there were a lot of new features in Standard Edition. It's not like they've been really taking stuff out of Standard Edition or limiting things. They've done a lot with it in the last couple of releases. It's a place they are concerned about, I think. \nMicrosoft wasn't on friendly terms with Linux until recently. What does it mean that Microsoft is creating SQL Server on Linux now? \nD'Antoni: It's just been a general trend since Satya [Nadella] took over. I think [Steve] Ballmer saw Linux as a threat and Satya realized that a lot of young engineers grew up only using Linux to program things. I think that's why we got SQL Server on Linux . There are a whole lot of other things, like Visual Studio for Mac. Microsoft just embraced open source really strongly. \nI think you'll hear some people say that this was a play at Oracle, and I think it was a little bit, but ... it's aiming at getting younger developers and startups using a real database. I think part of it is that Standard Edition is relatively affordable and, if you put those nice features in your application, that really gives them a point of differentiation between Postgres and MySQL. Now that they're going forward on this, if it hurts Oracle on the way, I don't think anybody would be too upset about that. It's really a very different Microsoft from what it was five years ago. Joey D'Antoni principal consultant at Denny Cherry & Associates Consulting \nThe other kind of interesting thing that might have gotten lost in the Linux announcement is that they're also supporting SQL Server on Docker, which is also pretty cool for quick development. I set up Docker yesterday on my MacBook and I had SQL Server up and running in 10 minutes. So that was pretty awesome. \nI'm not a super Docker expert ... It's just pretty much SQL Server running in a container. I think it can allow developers to build applications that can be rapidly developed with SQL Server at the center of them. There is a big push at Microsoft to embrace Docker . They feel like it's a good technology, and I tend to agree with them. It's virtualization again, later, and just in smaller increments. \nWhat do you think are the biggest and most influential events of 2016? \nD'Antoni: I think that the Linux release is probably the biggest. Someone else said this a while ago, and I think it was very well said, 'It's not so much that Microsoft will use SQL Server on Linux, so much as the changes that took place in Microsoft to allow them to build that, to build SQL Server on Linux' -- which is mainly Ballmer leaving and Satya being there . Seeing this huge organizational shift in Microsoft, I think that's really cool. \nSQL Server 2016 was amazing. I think it was probably the biggest release of SQL Server since 2005 in terms of functionality changes. And here is November, and we're not even talking about it now. We're talking about the Linux release and how they made Standard Edition pretty close to equal to Enterprise Edition. I think Microsoft continues to be a leader in the space, and they're pushing the envelope pretty far against Oracle and their competitors in the open source space . \nHow is Microsoft's organizational shift going to affect SQL Server? \nD'Antoni: Since Ballmer left, you've had a company that's more driven by engineering than by sales. Sales are obviously important; without sales you don't have any engineering. But the people who are running the company now are largely engineers, and I think that's driving a lot of the decision-making and a lot of the paths they go down. One of the things they did was to not completely, but mostly, eliminate stack ranking. That allows teams to work tighter together developing features. \nOne of the things we had for a while with SQL Server, one of the organizational things, was to get your feature in the product above all costs, whereas now, they're working together more. \nWith SQL Server in the cloud , that's a tighter release cycle, getting features faster and getting more feedback on them. I think, obviously, that with the cloud, they can get more telemetry data and get a better idea of how people are using their product, and that goes back into engineering. Everything is just a shorter cycle. \nWhat are your lessons learned for 2016? \nD'Antoni: Everything can change pretty fast. The Standard Edition thing was a big surprise when I heard it. It wasn't that tremendous a surprise because we saw things trending in that direction, but I just feel like the company is trending toward being more open source and more open and taking more customer feedback. In general, it's really a very different Microsoft from what it was five years ago. You're seeing that in a lot of their products. Next Steps ",

      "text": "Justin Sullivan/Getty Images \nWhat do Microsoft, Dell, Napster and Facebook all have in common? Aside from being among some of the most market-shaking companies of the last quarter century, they were all also created by college students.\nSure, not everyone can be the next Mark Zuckerberg, but starting a small business while in college is definitely possible.\nThere are several options that require little to no startup capital and can be done without an office space.\nEntrepreneurship in college can help make valuable connections while also generating some income to cover tuition, meals and those very expensive textbooks.\nRelated: The 3 Things College Taught Me About Being An Entrepreneur \nHere are 10 ideas for starting a business from the comfort of your own dorm room.\n1. Information technology (IT) consulting  \nInformation technology is one field where having years of experience can actually work against you. College students typically have the freshest skills in this area and knowledge of the newest technologies.\nIf you don’t feel confident promoting yourself as an IT consultant to businesses, put the word out on campus that you’re available to help the less tech-savvy majors with their computer issues, and build from there.\n\n\nShutterstock/d8nn 2. Social media consulting \nCollege students are often on the cutting edge of social-media trends. Use this knowledge and experience to advise companies on their social-media strategy. Take them beyond Facebook and LinkedIn, and introduce them to new channels to get their messages out.\n\n\n3. Graphic design \nGraphic design consulting relies more on creativity and talent than years of experience. Design majors should grab a portfolio of their best projects from class, print off some impressive looking business cards or feature them on a website, and get started.\n\n\nSee the rest of the story at Business Insider ",

      "text": "svenska DialogTech Brings Phone Calls to Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Sales Integration Gives Marketers and Sales Teams Actionable Insights into Their Most Valuable Customer Interaction, Right Inside Microsoft Dynamics 365  09   CHICAGO , Dec.   DialogTech, the leading call attribution platform, today announced an integration with Microsoft Dynamics 365. The integration allows companies to automatically capture intelligence on every phone call, caller and conversation generated from their marketing within Microsoft Dynamics 365. By adding phone call analytics, DialogTech helps marketers gain actionable insight into how every channel, ad, search keyword, web session and marketing interaction drives leads, customers and revenue, whether a consumer converts online or by phone. The integration automatically populates records with data on every call and caller, even if the call goes unanswered, making sales teams more efficient by ensuring accurate and comprehensive data is captured by the CRM. With calls to U.S. businesses from digital advertising expected to reach over 100 billion in 2017, marketers can no longer measure and optimize ROI without knowing how each channel is generating calls and customers. The DialogTech integration with Microsoft Dynamics 365 provides that insight and more. \"DialogTech is excited to bring intelligence on the most valuable customer interaction – the phone call – to the Microsoft Dynamics 365 platform,\" said Josh Mallamud , SVP of Corporate Development & Strategic Partnerships at DialogTech. \"Businesses can now access data on both online conversions and marketing-driven phone calls within the platform, giving them a complete view of the customer journey, key data to close the loop on marketing attribution and insights to optimize marketing spend across all channels to drive more revenue more efficiently.\" Canada's largest provider of cemetery and funeral services, Arbor Memorial, has been piloting the Microsoft Dynamics 365 integration. \"Families want to speak to a real person over the phone when planning memorial services,\" said Jeffrey Loretta , Marketing CRM Specialist at Arbor Memorial. \"Prior to DialogTech's integration we couldn't attribute calls to our marketing efforts. Now with DialogTech, we've added callers from marketing to the mix and are attributing 150% more revenue within Microsoft Dynamics 365. And having data on the call and caller captured automatically in a CRM record frees up our sales team to focus on providing the quality call experiences that our families deserve.\" Highlights of the DialogTech integration with Microsoft Dynamics 365 include: Detailed Call Attribution from Source to Sale: Know which marketing channels, ads, search keywords, campaigns and website interactions generate calls that become customers. Demographic Data on Inbound Callers: Capture over 50 data points on each caller, including their name, caller ID and geographic location, even if the call goes unanswered. Insightful Reports on the Impact of Calls: View reports on call volume from each marketing source for any time period to see its impact on sales opportunities, prospects and revenue. Call Logging: Save sales agents time and eliminate manual errors by having information on each call and caller – including call duration, time and date – logged and tied to a new or current lead or contact based on caller ID.

      "text": "It is no secret that terrorist groups like ISIS have for years used social media as a recruitment tool. Now, four major tech companies are taking steps to fight back against their most radical users. Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, and Microsoft have announced plans to launch a joint database that will identify terrorist content so that it can be blocked.\nThe database will function similarly to YouTube’s Content ID system by using “fingerprinting” technology to find and block content that are sympathetic to terrorist groups. The four participating companies will upload so-called “hashes,” which can then be applied across multiple platforms in search of matching photos and videos.\n“By sharing this information with each other, we may use the shared hashes to help identify potential terrorist content on our respective hosted consumer platforms,” reads a joint post from the four companies, published by Facebook . “We hope this collaboration will lead to greater efficiency as we continue to enforce our policies to help curb the pressing global issue of terrorist content online.”\nISIS sympathizers have a significant presence on social media. Research from Brookings Institute noted that the terrorist group’s supporters used more than 46,000 different Twitter accounts during a three month period in 2014.\nThis is not the first time Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, and Microsoft have united on a globally-just mission. Back in May 2016, they signed a European Union code of conduct that pledged to eradicate hate speech on social media.\nVisit Tubefilter for more great stories.\n",

      "text": "A 23-year-old Nigerian entrepreneur, Chris Kwekowe turned down a job offer to work as a software engineer at Microsoft, owned by the richest man in the world, Bill Gates, in order to begin his own start-up in Lagos.\n\nThe Lagos State University computer science graduate proudly revealed this to Bill Gates during a television interview for Africa’s brightest young entrepreneurs in August 2016.\nKwekowe, who won the 2015 Anzisha Prize which came with a $25,000 cheque, said he rejected the offer to build up his own startup, Slatecube– a website aimed at helping other young Nigerians find jobs.\n\"When I told him, Gates was intrigued and he smiled. After the programme, all the directors were like, ‘Dude, you mean you actually turned down a job at Microsoft and had the guts to tell Bill Gates?’ \nKwekowe founded Slatecube with his brother Emerald, 20, in October 2014. The pair funded their efforts by freelancing as web designers and running a software solutions firm.\n\n\nHe said Slatecube seeks to solve that problem by nurturing the graduates through digital internships and so far, Slatecube has an 80% employment rate for its users. Companies that have used the platform, have saved over $100,000 in 2015 by hiring skilled, ready to work employees.\n\n\nIn a Facebook post published last August, Chris narrated in details of his meeting with Bill Gates:\n\"Oh yeah, I did meet with Bill Gates in Durban, South Africa where we had some candid discussion about everything - from his involvement with charitable causes in the continent, to how he makes time to be a great father for his kids. My favourite moments were watching his reaction after I told him I turned down job offers from Microsoft and the likes to pursue something more defining for me, and how Africa's development depends more on sustainable investments in innovative social startups like Slatecube that solve some of the continent's biggest problems, rather than donating entirely to charity organisations who end up requiring more financial injection to deal with the minutest of issues. Anyways, we'd be working with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to make our value proposition at Slatecube a pan-African privilege. Soon, you'd rather be in demand across the globe, and engage in companies and projects that make you better, and suits your career goals. Nothing can really be better\" Source: Newsweek.europe/Chris Kwekowe/Facebook \nThis post first appeared on Linda Ikeji's Blog. Read the original story here. ",

      "text": "0 0 \nIt is a very considerate gesture on Microsoft’s part to introduce several specific features in Windows 10 for disabled users. Microsoft highlighted some potential ways in which they could optimize their OS to comply with the needs of handicapped users with their Windows 10 Creators Update . Although the update is not expected to come out before spring of 2017. But that is not stopping Microsoft from sharing what’s in development, and what users can look forward to. \nRecently, in their accessibility blog , Microsoft pointed out Several big improvements will come to Windows 10’s Narrator tool. Some of which can already be incorporated in Insider Builds. For instance braille, the update will bring compatibility with braille displays from over 35 manufacturers. An upgrade to Narrators , enabling them to read several languages. Audio volume from apps like Spotify or Pandora to automatically lower when Narrator starts speaking. Here’s a look at what’s in the pipeline for the OS and Narrator in the Windows 10 Creators Update. \nBraille: Support for braille is coming! The Creators Update will include beta support for braille input and output. The beta will support braille displays from more than 35 manufacturers, using more than 40 languages and multiple braille variants, including grade 2 contracted \nUnassisted installation: Users will soon be able to install the Windows 10 Creators Update using Narrator throughout the installation process, including from within Windows RE/PE for setup & troubleshooting. \nNew way to launch Narrator: We have changed the quick keys used to launch Narrator to address feedback from manyWindows 10 users. Users can now launch Narrator by clicking CTRL + WIN + ENTER. WIN + ENTER no longer launches Narrator. Users can still launch Narrator from Cortana or from the Settings Window. \nNew text to speech voices and capabilities: We are adding more than 10 new voices. In addition, there will be Narrator support for multilingual reading, so that Narrator seamlessly switches between languages when you have the corresponding voices installed. \nImproved audio experiences: We implemented dynamic ducking, so Narrator will only reduce the volume of other applications like Groove or Pandora when it is speaking. The handshake between Narrator and Cortana is also improved, so Cortana won’t transcribe what Narrator (or other screen readers) is speaking. \nMore general reliability and usability improvements: We added features to make it easier to understand the context of a control with which you are interacting and to make it possible to discover information about objects like the background color of a table cell. \nNarrator will remember and maintain your mode, e.g. scan mode, across applications. Narrator cursor positioning improvements include stopping and starting where you expect when reading in scan mode and when reading by line, paragraph and in continuous reading. \nEasier web browsing with Edge: Narrator responsiveness is improved with Edge and several new features have been added, including the ability to jump directly to a form element like a check box, text field or button, and the ability to navigate by heading level. \nImprovements across devices: It will be now be possible to use a controller to drive Narrator interactions on Xbox. The ability to adjust the pitch and speed of the Narrator voice on Xbox has also been added. \nBut that’s not all. Apparently, there are also new accessibility features coming to the Office 365 suite early next year along with the Windows 10 creators update. All due credit to Microsoft’s AI-powered Computer Vision Cognitive Service. \nHere’s a look at what’s coming in early 2017: Built-in controls for authoring accessible content: We will be introducing more accessible templates to help you get started, making it easy to insert alternative text descriptions for images and meaningful display names for hyperlinks as well as making the accessibility checker available in more Office applications. Watch this short accessible authoring demonstration to learn more about these capabilities. Built-in controls for personalizing reading experiences: Inspired by the profound impact the introduction of Learning Tools for OneNote has had in classrooms and are making these tools to promote concentration and comprehension available in more Office applications. Settings to read text aloud with simultaneous highlighting, increase text spacing and break words into syllables are already rolling out in Word for PCs to Office Insider and First Release program members and are coming next to Word Online and OneNote Online. Watch this short Learning Tools demonstration to learn more about these capabilities. Support for creating professional, polished content with assistive technologies: Making it easy to use new cloud-powered, intelligent services in Office applications with assistive technologies such as screen readers and alternative keyboards. Services such as Designer in PowerPoint, Researcher and Editor in Word can reduce the effort you spend on tasks such as formatting, citing and proofing your work and let you focus on refining the ideas you’d like to communicate.",

      "text": "0 0 \nThe concept of 3D printing is that you can generate a 3D object on your computer and then have a 3D printer recreate it in real life. The materialization of 3D objects from mere digital data is another sample of the possibilities technology can open up. Without getting too distracted by the future and what marvels it holds, Microsoft has taken an important step towards familiarizing consumers with 3D printing. \nSince its release, Windows 10 on PC contained an app called 3D Builder. This app allows users to construct their own 3D schematic and then send the data over to a 3D printer so it can be shaped into reality. The app has been described as a tool that contains everything one might need when it comes to designing their own 3D prints. \nThe app does not limit the user to creating from scratch, as you can also take pictures and use elements from said pictures. While it most cases it is a bit redundant or at the very least gimmicky since we are talking about turning a 3D object into another 3D object, it could still be a fun feature to have but imagination is key. \nAs for Microsoft’s advancement in 3D printing, the company has now also introduced the app to Windows 10 for mobile but also the Xbox console. Now Microsoft has made a 3D printing design tool available on all its platforms, giving the entirety of its consumer base the means to create their own 3D prints. \nAll they need now is a 3D printer, which isn’t very cheap. While everyone will now have access to the means of creating their own designs, the vast majority of users will probably not benefit from this feature since 3D printing hasn’t reached a mainstream level by any mean.

      "text": "Mark Zuckerberg. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\nWhat do Microsoft, Dell, Napster and Facebook all have in common? Aside from being among some of the most market-shaking companies of the last quarter century, they were all also created by college students.\nSure, not everyone can be the next Mark Zuckerberg, but starting a small business while in college is definitely possible.\nThere are several options that require little to no startup capital and can be done without an office space.\nEntrepreneurship in college can help make valuable connections while also generating some income to cover tuition, meals and those very expensive textbooks.\nRelated: The 3 Things College Taught Me About Being An Entrepreneur\nHere are 10 ideas for starting a business from the comfort of your own dorm room.\nView As: One Page Slides 1. Information technology (IT) consulting Information technology is one field where having years of experience can actually work against you. College students typically have the freshest skills in this area and knowledge of the newest technologies.\nIf you don’t feel confident promoting yourself as an IT consultant to businesses, put the word out on campus that you’re available to help the less tech-savvy majors with their computer issues, and build from there.\nShutterstock/d8nn 2. Social media consulting College students are often on the cutting edge of social-media trends. Use this knowledge and experience to advise companies on their social-media strategy. Take them beyond Facebook and LinkedIn, and introduce them to new channels to get their messages out.\n3. Graphic design Graphic design consulting relies more on creativity and talent than years of experience. Design majors should grab a portfolio of their best projects from class, print off some impressive looking business cards or feature them on a website, and get started.\nFlickr/Juhan Sonin 4. Website design Students are much more exposed to designing websites than ever before. Many have done so for a campus group or club, a fellow student or just a personal blog. Those sites can be used as samples and leveraged in order to branch out to designing websites for a profit.\n5. Photography Thanks to platforms like Pinterest, Instagram, Snapchat and Facebook, the world has become more accustomed to using images to communicate. With a rise in the need for visual content, there has also been growing sense of comfort with using amateur photographers. Due to advancements in technology, these amateurs have the ability to churn out high-quality work.\nRelated: The Best Undergrad Programs for Entrepreneurship 2016\nFlickr/Roman Boed 6. Event planning College students have probably attended their fair share of parties, but putting that party experience to good use is another story. Event planning requires attention to detail, organization, the ability to multitask and creativity.\nIf equipped to handle the job, start a business around campus and become the go-to source for planning campus group or club activities. It’s important to note that taking your business outside of school may require special certification.\n7. Personal trainer Personal trainers have flexible hours and can conduct workouts almost anywhere. Personal training can oftentimes require a certification through an organization such as ACE, but meeting the requirements, such as taking a certification exam and passing CPR/AED courses, may be easier than you think.\nShutterstock/mmphotographie.de 8. Cleaning services Starting a cleaning business allows students to work flexible hours and doesn’t require an office. Not to mention, supplies needed for this business can be purchased at your local grocery store.\nMany people are willing to pay someone else to do a dirty job. A gold mine for the cleaning business lies within fraternity or sorority houses the day after a big game.\n9. Freelance makeup artist According to Federal data, women have outnumbered men in American colleges for nearly 35 years. This provides the perfect opportunity to start a small business geared towards the female demographic. Freelance makeup artists can generate revenue in the traditional sense of applying makeup to customers ahead of special occasions.\nAlternately, one of the newest ways to make money is by providing tutorial videos on social media. Great content that attracts a high number of viewers can turn into YouTube sponsorship dollars.\nFlickr/Bill Smith 10. Landscaping / snow removal Landscaping and snow removal services are great seasonal businesses that can carry over vacation breaks and throughout the semester. Armed with a shovel, garden store equipment and some sturdy boots, students living off-campus or local residents could become very lucrative clients.\nEven if a business is started by a student while in college, it’s still a real business, with real rewards and risks. No matter what the business or size of the company, it’s important to have insurance protection. Things like specialized IT consultant insurance or a more general professional liability policy will help a company stay out of trouble if anything goes wrong.\nThe bottom line is that college entrepreneurship can be a great way to earn some money as well as pave the way for continued career success after graduation.\nRead the original article on Entrepreneur .

      "title": "Microsoft Surface Book 2 Specs, Features And Release Date Rumors: What Can We Expect From Surface Book 2017",
      "text": "Microsoft recently released the Surface Book i7, which is the second iteration of the first laptop ever released by the company. Rumors, however, are already swirling on the Surface Book 2, which is expected to be released next year. ( Microsoft ) Advertisement \nMicrosoft's Surface Book, the first laptop ever released by the company, has garnered overwhelmingly positive reviews since it was released in October 2015. \nMicrosoft has recently released the Surface Book i7, a second iteration of the Surface Book that features updated processors, better battery capacity and various under-the-hood improvements. However, the Surface Book i7 is not the Surface Book 2, with rumors already swirling on the new device as users look forward to the next Microsoft laptop. \nHere is what we know so far regarding the Surface Book 2. Surface Book 2 Release Date \nEarlier in the year, it was reported that Microsoft will be launching the Surface Book 2 sometime next year, with the laptop to be powered by Intel's latest Kaby Lake processors. It is believed that Microsoft is simply waiting for Intel to start rolling out the i5 and i7 Kaby Lake chipsets to include them in the Surface Book 2. Surface Book 2 Performance And Specs \nWith the inclusion of the Intel Kaby Lake processors, the performance of the Surface Book 2 is expected to feature a significant improvement. \nIn addition to the latest chipsets, it is said that the 13.5-inch display of the Surface Book 2 will feature a screen resolution of 3,840 x 2,160 pixels, which would allow it to support 4K videos. There are also rumors that the Surface Book 2 would be able to support virtual reality systems, though there are no specific details that would lend credibility to such a claim. Surface Book 2 Design \nIn August, through the official Instagram account of Surface, Microsoft hinted that company would be adding a new hinge system to the Surface Book 2. \nThe image that was uploaded, supposedly of the Surface Book 2, revealed a hinge that has fewer ridges compared to the hinge in the current Surface Book. The redesign could be looking to address the issue that customers had with the gap that appears when the Surface Book is closed due to the current hinge. Surface Book 2 Potential \nMicrosoft has not made any official announcements regarding the Surface Book 2, but customers are already looking forward to the potential of the upcoming laptop. \nThe Surface Book i7 , which is being sold at $1,899 for the 8 GB of RAM and 256 GB of storage model but for only $1,848.99 on Amazon, edges out Apple's MacBook Pro 2016 in terms of pricing, battery life and screen resolution when the two laptops were compared . An updated Microsoft laptop in the form of the Surface Book 2 would only widen the gap between the device and Apple's latest MacBook. TAG © 2016 Tech Times, All rights reserved.

      "text": "DialogTech Brings Phone Calls to Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Sales [December 06, 2016] Tweet \nCHICAGO , Dec. 6, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- DialogTech, the leading call attribution platform, today announced an integration with Microsoft Dynamics 365. The integration allows companies to automatically capture intelligence on every phone call, caller and conversation generated from their marketing within Microsoft Dynamics 365. By adding phone call analytics, DialogTech helps marketers gain actionable insight into how every channel, ad, search keyword, web session and marketing interaction drives leads, customers and revenue, whether a consumer converts online or by phone. The integration automatically populates records with data on every call and caller, even if the call goes unanswered, making sales teams more efficient by ensuring accurate and comprehensive data is captured by the CRM. \nWith calls to U.S. businesses from digital advertising expected to reach over 100 billion in 2017, marketers can no longer measure and optimize ROI without knowing how each channel is generating calls and customers. The DialogTech integration with Microsoft Dynamics 365 provides that insight and more. \n\"DialogTech is excited to bring intelligence on the most valuable customer interaction – the phone call – to the Microsoft Dynamics 365 platform,\" said Josh Mallamud , SVP of Corporate Development & Strategic Partnerships at DialogTech. \"Businesses can now access data on both online conversions and marketing-driven phone calls within the platform, giving them a complete view of the customer journey, key data to close the loop on marketing attribution and insights to optimize marketing spend across all channels to drive more revenue more efficiently.\" \nCanada's largest provider of cemetery and funeral services, Arbor Memorial, has been piloting the Microsoft Dynamics 365 integration. \"Families want to peak to a real person over the phone when planning memorial services,\" said Jeffrey Loretta , Marketing CRM Specialist at Arbor Memorial. \"Prior to DialogTech's integration we couldn't attribute calls to our marketing efforts. Now with DialogTech, we've added callers from marketing to the mix and are attributing 150% more revenue within Microsoft Dynamics 365. And having data on the call and caller captured automatically in a CRM record frees up our sales team to focus on providing the quality call experiences that our families deserve.\" \nHighlights of the DialogTech integration with Microsoft Dynamics 365 include: Detailed Call Attribution from Source to Sale: Know which marketing channels, ads, search keywords, campaigns and website interactions generate calls that become customers. Demographic Data on Inbound Callers: Capture over 50 data points on each caller, including their name, caller ID and geographic location, even if the call goes unanswered. Insightful Reports on the Impact of Calls: View reports on call volume from each marketing source for any time period to see its impact on sales opportunities, prospects and revenue. Call Logging: Save sales agents time and eliminate manual errors by having information on each call and caller – including call duration, time and date – logged and tied to a new or current lead or contact based on caller ID. \nSupporting Resources:",

      "text": "Microsoft Surface Pro 5 is Rumored to Release in a Few Months Microsoft Surface Pro 5 is Rumored to Release in a Few Months   7:35 AM \nThe Microsoft Surface Pro 4 arrived in late 2015 and was overdue for an upgrade. News has it there will be a new Microsoft Surface Pro 5 is rumored to releasing in a few months in spring of 2017. \nThe Microsoft Surface Pro 5 will feature Intel’s latest seventh generation Kaby Lake processor. It is rumored the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 will come equipped with 16GB of RAM and 512G of SSD. If accurate, it is possibly underwhelming considering the current Surface Pro 4 currently comes with 512GB and 1TB on SSD and 16GB of RAM. \nMore to be expected from the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 include USB-C and Thunderbolt 3 connections. The Surface Pro 5 is also reported to have rechargeable batteries through the Surface Pro 5 magnetic rechargeable dock. It will include a fingerprint scan for better managed security and identification. \nCustomers may currently purchase the Microsoft Surface Pro 4 with a $250 dollar price cut. That makes the Microsoft Surface Pro approximately $649 dollars. Customers who purchase the product will also receive a free sleeve for the convertible on December 8 th . Customers who purchase the convertible on December 12 receive a free cover. Offers are available on the Microsoft Store. \nThe most current Microsoft Surface Pro 4 starting price is $899 and comes equipped with an Intel Core m3 processor, 4GB of RAM, and 128 GB SSD. The Microsoft Surface Pro 4 caps with a 2.2 GHZ i7 processor, 16 GB of RAM, 256GB SSD, a resolution of 2736 X 1824 (267 PPI), and a battery life up to 9 hours of video playback. Microsoft has yet to officially announce the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 specs, but we have the prior convertible to measure up to. Perhaps Microsoft will confirm rumors and provide more details at CES Q1 of 2017. Hopefully more is revealed to justify upgrading from the 2015 Surface Pro 4.",

      "title": "Home Hub, Microsoft’s answer to Alexa and Google Home, could be PC-driven",
      "text": "microsoft home hub pc based cortanaface More In 2014, Amazon’s Alexa kicked off the craze of putting stand-alone digital assistants in the home with its Echo device . Google Home followed suit in 2016, offering a similar device that responds to voice commands, but powered by Google Assistant and the company various other digital properties.\nEver since Microsoft’s Cortana digital assistant joined Apple’s Siri in providing voice-response intelligence to PCs and has grown in power and popularity, speculation has been running wild about the possibility of Microsoft introducing an Alexa- and Google Home-like intelligent home assistant. Recent information suggests that while Microsoft does indeed have plans for a “Home Hub” product, it might be entirely PC-based, as Windows Central reports .\nMore: Microsoft’s Cortana may get to know you better to make conversation more natural\nWhile the earliest rumors were around Microsoft providing a stand-alone hardware device like Amazon’s Echo and Google Home, those appear to have been premature. Code referring to “Home Hub” components has surfaced in Windows 10 Anniversary, indicating indicate Microsoft is looking to incorporate family-friendly features into Windows 10 that will make PCs — and not a stand-alone, voice-only device — serve as the center of users’ homes.\nRather than being a piece of hardware, then, Home Hub looks to actually be a set of software services running in Windows 10. The core services will expand Cortana to pull in and share family information to provide shared services for all of a family’s members. Shared calendars, task lists, notifications, and more will extend beyond the individual and allow Microsoft’s digital assistant to work with entire families as well.\nThe Windows 10 lock screen will service as a central display for Home Hub information. Rather than simply showing an individual’s various information, such as calendar notifications, the Home Hub “Welcome Screen” will provide a shared environment for families to reference and interact. Presumably, this functionality will run on a shared PC located in a home’s common area.\nFinally, Home Hub will also include the intelligence to connect to smart home components. So far, it looks like Home Hub will integrate with Open Connectivity Foundation (OCF) and Open Translators to Things (OpenT2T) systems, meaning that a number of today’s smart home devices will work with Home Hub immediately.\nMore: Windows Insider members get a sneak peek of Creators Update with Office Hub\nWhile Microsoft is concentrating on providing the Home Hub software within Windows 10, that doesn’t mean its original equipment manufacturer (OEM) partners couldn’t come up with their own Home Hub-specific hardware devices. While Home Hub isn’t “headless” like Amazon Alexa and Google Home, that is, it doesn’t run without a display, there’s nothing stopping a Dell or an HP from making a Home Hub device that uses Windows 10 and family oriented Cortana to compete more directly with Alexa and Home.\nIf you’re looking to jump onto the home assistant bandwagon with Microsoft’s Home Hub, it appears that you’ll have to wait awhile. Home Hub may make its debut in the upcoming Creators Update due in Sprint 2017, most of it will have to wait for the Redstone 3 update coming in late 2017 and possibly even Redstone 4, estimated for 2018. In other words, it will be some time before Microsoft’s Home Hub initiative can hope to replace Amazon Alexa and Google Home in letting you control your home and interact with your family with a Cortana-driven home assistant.\nGreat Deals: Smart devices that automate, control, and protect your home What smart home devices will work with Google Home when it debuts November 4?",

      "text": "Microsoft is about to close the books on its $26.2 billion deal to purchase the professional social networking service LinkedIn. On Tuesday, it was announced that the European Commission had given its blessing to Microsoft, adding it to a list of regulators that approved the merger including the U.S., Canada, Brazil, and South Africa. However, there’s a bit of a catch.\nIn order to receive the approval of those in Europe, Microsoft said that it is doing five things over the next 5 years, namely that LinkedIn competitors will still receive access to participate in Office Add-in and promotional opportunities in the Office Store, the company won’t enter into agreements with PC manufacturers to pre-install Windows LinkedIn application or tile which would “favor LinkedIn on an exclusive basis…”, and more.\nIn a process that took more than six months to complete, now Microsoft can move forward and wrap up a deal that has seen LinkedIn become entangled in a tug-of-war like battle as Salesforce sought to be the preferred suitor. It was the one that got away from the enterprise company’s chief executive Marc Benioff and it resulted in a request to the European Union that extra scrutiny be paid to the purchase.\nThis is developing.

If you'd like to learn more... - Listen \nWASHINGTON – Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter and YouTube are joining forces to more quickly identify the worst terrorist propaganda and prevent it from spreading online. \nThe new program announced Monday would create a database of unique digital “fingerprints” to help automatically identify videos or images the companies could remove. \nThe move by the technology companies, which is expected to begin in early 2017, aims to assuage government concerns — and derail proposed new federal legislation — over social media content that is seen as increasingly driving terrorist recruitment and radicalization, while also balancing free-speech issues. \nWATCH: Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau kicks off computer science education week by helping some students with coding Story continues below \nTechnical details were being worked out, but Microsoft pioneered similar technology to detect, report and remove child pornography through such a database in 2009. Unlike those images, which are plainly illegal under U.S. law, questions about whether an image or video promotes terrorism can be more subjective, depending on national laws and the rules of a particular company’s service. \nSocial media has increasingly become a tool for recruiting and radicalization by the Islamic State group and others. Its use by terror groups and supporters has added to the threat from so-called lone-wolf attacks and decreased the time from “flash to bang” — or radicalization to violence — with little or no time for law enforcement to follow evidentiary trails before an attack. \nREAD MORE: Hackers disable Carleton University computer system, demand bitcoins \nUnder the new partnership, the companies promised to share among themselves “the most extreme and egregious terrorist images and videos we have removed from our services — content most likely to violate all our respective companies’ content policies,” according to a joint announcement Monday evening. \nWhen such content is shared internally, the other participating companies will be notified and can use the digital fingerprints to quickly identify the same content on their own services to judge whether it violates their rules. If so, companies can delete the material and possibly disable the account, as appropriate. \nREAD MORE: Expecting a new gadget from Santa? Take these steps to properly secure it \nMost social media services explicitly do not allow content that supports violent action or illegal activities. Twitter, for example, says users “may not promote violence against or directly attack or threaten other people on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability or disease.” \n“We really are going after the most obvious serious content that is shared online — that is, the kind of recruitment videos and beheading videos more likely to be against all our content policies,” said Sally Aldous, a Facebook spokeswoman. \nThe White House praised the joint effort. “The administration believes that the innovative private sector is uniquely positioned to help limit terrorist recruitment and radicalization online,” said National Security Council spokesman Carl Woog. “Today’s announcement is yet another example of tech communities taking action to prevent terrorists from using these platforms in ways their creators never intended.” \nThe new program caps a year of efforts to tamp down on social media’s use by terrorist groups. \nREAD MORE: Despite recent attacks, ISIS still losing social media war \nLawmakers last year introduced legislation that would require social media companies to report any online terrorist activity they became aware of to law enforcement. The bill by Sens. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., and Richard Burr, R-N.C., was criticized for not defining “terrorist activity,” which could have drowned government agencies in reports. The bill was opposed by the Internet Association, which represents 37 internet companies, including Facebook, Snapchat, Google, LinkedIn, Reddit, Twitter, Yahoo and others. \nThe bill came days after Syed Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, went on a shooting attack in San Bernardino, California, killing 14 people and injuring 21 others. A Facebook post on Malik’s page around the time of the attack included a pledge of allegiance to the leader of the Islamic State group. \nFacebook found the post — which was under an alias — the day after the attack. The company removed the profile from public view and informed law enforcement. Such a proactive effort had previously been uncommon. \nREAD MORE: ISIS likely to attack Europe again soon, EU police report warns \nTwitter moved toward partial automation in late 2015, using unspecified “proprietary spam-fighting tools” to find accounts that might be violating its terms of service and promoting terrorism. The material still required review by a team at Twitter before the accounts could be disabled. \n“Since the middle of 2015, we have suspended more than 360,000 accounts for violating Twitter’s policy on violent threats and the promotion of terrorism,” said Sinead McSweeney, Twitter’s vice-president of public policy. “A large proportion of these accounts have been removed by technical means, including our proprietary spam-fighting tools.” \nFacebook has also used image-matching technology to compare images to ones it’s already removed. The effort lets Facebook review images to avoid removing legitimate and protected uses, such as a photograph published by a news organization, a spokeswoman said. \nTerrence McNeil of Ohio was charged in 2015 with soliciting the killings of U.S. service members over social media, including Tumblr, Facebook and Twitter. Federal prosecutors accused him of posting a series of photographs on his Facebook account to praise the death of a Jordanian pilot who was burned to death by the Islamic State group — showing him before, during and after his death, including an image of him engulfed in flames, according to the complaint. \nIn January, the White House dispatched top officials, including FBI Director James Comey, Attorney General Loretta Lynch and National Security Agency Director Mike Rogers, to Silicon Valley to discuss the use of social media by violent extremist groups. Among the issues they discussed was how to use technology to help quickly identify terrorist content. \nThe four companies say they will be looking at involving additional companies in the future. \n___ ",

      "text": "Meet Zo: Microsoft unveils new and improved chatbot as successor to racist AI bot Tay By Rebecca Stewart - 06 December 2016 15:24pm Meet Zo: Microsoft unveils new and improved chatbot as successor to racist AI bot Tay \nMicrosoft has made another foray into the world of AI chatbots, unveiling its latest creation Zo just eight months after it was forced to shut down its millennial bot, Tay, after users turned it into a racist . \nZo is currently being tested in messaging app Kik, with users who have opted to try the service saying the bot is effectively an English language version of Microsoft’s existing Chinese bot, Xiaoice . \nFirst spotted by Twitter user Tom Hounsell , Zo is powered by AI and isn’t available on any other platforms as of yet – which isn't surprising given how quickly its predecessor Tay was corrupted Twitter users. \nTay was taken offline to \"make adjustments\" in March after living on the platform for just one day and falling foul to trolls who took advantage of its conversational learning abilities. \nThe bot had been modeled to speak like a \"teen girl\" but instead used its platform to praise Hilter and Donald Trump and share 9/11 conspiracy theories after it was taught how to say a plethora of unsavoury statements by Twitter users. \nHowever, with Zo Microsoft has been cautious to ensure it avoids topics like politics, and following a “super abbreviated personality test”, Zo is able to chat conversationally with select Kik subscribers. \nWhereas Tay was trained to speak like a millennial, Zo appears to have been designed to appeal to a broader audience and according to Engadget is “uncannily knowledgeable about Microsoft products, and will profess to being a Windows phone fan.” \nSince the start of 2016 chatbots have been heralded by some marketers as the next frontier for brand and consumer interaction , so its no shock that Microsoft would turn to a platform like Kik to host Zo. \nEarlier this year Kik said its army of bots, which includes services from the likes of CNN and HP, was gaining traction among users and businesses alike with 1.8bn messages being sent to date between Kik subscribers and businesses bots since it launched the offering. \nThis article is about: World , Microsoft , TayBot , Artificial Intelligence (AI) , Social Media , Digital , Brand Rebecca Stewart \nRebecca Stewart is The Drum's breaking news and social media reporter, covering how brands and media companies are using platforms like Snapchat, Facebook, Twitter and beyond.",

      "text": "Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter and YouTube agree to curb terror content online December 6, 2016 10:40am \n( JTA ) — Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter and YouTube said they will partner to curb the spread of terrorist content online. \n“There is no place for content that promotes terrorism on our hosted consumer services. When alerted, we take swift action against this kind of content in accordance with our respective policies,” said a statement released Monday by the social media firms. \nThe companies said they will create a shared industry database of unique digital fingerprints, called hashes, for violent terrorist imagery or terrorist recruitment videos or images that were removed from their services. \n“By sharing this information with each other, we may use the shared hashes to help identify potential terrorist content on our respective hosted consumer platforms,” the statement said. \nSocial media has become a tool for recruiting and radicalization by the Islamic State terror group and others. \nThe companies said they would start by sharing the “most extreme and egregious terrorist images and videos we have removed from our services.” \nThey added: “We are committed to protecting our users’ privacy and their ability to express themselves freely and safely on our platforms. We also seek to engage with the wider community of interested stakeholders in a transparent, thoughtful and responsible way as we further our shared objective to prevent the spread of terrorist content online while respecting human rights.” \nThe companies said they will each apply their own policies and definitions of terrorist content when deciding whether to remove content. Each also will apply its own “practice of transparency and review for any government requests, as well as retain its own appeal process for removal decisions and grievances.” \nThe program is expected to begin early next year. The companies said they would look to add other firms to the collaboration in the future.",

      "text": "The Amazon Echo, a $200 device that sits on your kitchen counter and silently judges everything you say, has been a surprise hit with consumers. Google has rushed its own version to market , Apple is said to be working on something similar, and now it looks like Microsoft is going to half-heartedly join the fray.\nAccording to Windows Central , Microsoft is working on an update that will give any Windows PC the always-listening, schedule planning, home-controlling capabilities of Echo and Alexa. It sounds like a nice idea on paper, but in the real world, I guarantee it will suck.\nDON’T MISS: Galaxy Note 7 fires were caused by over-ambitious design, engineers find\nAs Windows Central explains, “Home Hub is a Windows 10 feature designed to make your PC the center of your home, by making shared PCs more communal and bringing the connected home to Windows.” In real speak, that means Home Hub is a slew of software updates that will add a “Welcome Screen” to Windows that acts like a “virtual fridge door,” showing to-do lists, calendar events and sticky notes. Cortana will always be listening to respond to commands, and she’ll also get the ability to control smart home devices like Nest or Hue, just like the Echo.\nAccording to the report, Microsoft thinks Home Hub PCs will be the center of the family, with a special new “family account” that anyone can log into. It’s meant to live on a kitchen counter or somewhere convenient, so everyone will use it as a replacement for a family calendar or to-do notes on the fridge.\nIt’s a nice idea, but I almost guarantee it will fail for a list of reasons. Specifically:\nDesktop PCs are already dying as everyone moves to laptops. No family wants to spend hundreds of dollars on a Windows PC that’s a replacement for $5 of fridge magnets. Microsoft apparently envisages its hardware partners building “Home Hub PCs.” These will probably look like glorified all-in-ones with small screens and cute, colorful plastic cases. They’ll also cost a minimum of $300, which is a hard sell when the cheapest Echo hardware is $30. People don’t want a PC sitting in their kitchen. Amazon Echo and Google Home are designed to look like unobtrusive Bluetooth speakers for a reason: having a gigantic touchscreen gadget sitting on your kitchen counter is not good interior design. The magic of Alexa and the Google Assistant is the deep integration into your music services and smart home. If people want calendar appointments, they’ll probably ask the assistant on their phone. All these reasons also assume that Microsoft manages to deliver this product on time, without a bunch of strange bugs, and before the trend for in-home personal assistants has been wiped out by brain implants or something. Let’s just hope that Home Hub is an optional software upgrade, for once.\nTrending right now:\nGet ready for a limited NES Classic Edition sale tomorrow morning Samsung may adopt a beloved iPhone 7 feature for the Galaxy S8, and it’s not the camera Netflix’s offline downloads have a neat trick to save iPhone storage space See the original version of this article on BGR.com",

      "text": "\nAs expected, Microsoft has cleared the final regulatory approval needed to complete its $26.2 billion acquisition of LinkedIn.\nMicrosoft announced its intention to purchase LinkedIn in June , noting that the social network would remain independent in the wake of the transition. But Microsoft purchased LinkedIn specifically for its rich trove of personal data , and it has been plotting to integrate the service into its broader portfolio of products, in essence turning LinkedIn into a public cloud version of its Microsoft Dynamics and Office Delve/Graph solutions.\n“This deal is all about bringing together the world’s leading professional cloud and the world’s leading professional network,” Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said at the time. “If you think about how people work today, it’s split between these two worlds. They’re using [Microsoft] Office on a daily basis, they’re using systems like [Microsoft] Dynamics for CRM [customer relationship management] and human capital management. And then of course they’re using their professional network. And the dream I’ve always had is, how do we make this come together so that we can serve our customers? When I think about reinventing productivity and business process, this is really about completing that scenario.”\nBut as Microsoft’s biggest acquisition by far, and coming as it is a year after the firm’s Nokia write-downs—the losses are at $10 billion and counting from that debacle—LinkedIn is not a sure bet. And the acquisition has come under fire from those both inside and outside Microsoft’s core ecosystem.\nThe most stringent complaints, of course, have come from Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, who lost out to Microsoft on his own bid for LinkedIn. He has accused Microsoft of anti-competitive behavior , going so far as to personally attack Microsoft executive Scott Guthrie.\nSponsored “The new Microsoft is actually the old Microsoft, and little things … started stacking up and we put it all together,” he said back in October. “I’m cool with Satya [Nadella] for sure, but some of his executives however, I am not cool with because they have made some very aggressive statements about what they are going to be doing with this LinkedIn data. It’s amazing what they have said. And they are doing things that are absolutely anti-competitive.”\nWithout digging up these baseless accusations again, let’s just say that the executive in question—Guthrie—never said anything “amazing” or “anti-competitive” about Microsoft’s plans for using LinkedIn’s data. He simply noted that Microsoft would integrate LinkedIn with Dynamics, Microsoft’s in-house CRM solution. As one would.\nRegulators in the U.S., Canada, Brazil, and South Africa quickly approved the deal, but the more critical EU’s European Commission was a stumbling block. So last month, Microsoft offered concessions to the EU that didn’t directly address any Salesforce complaints, instead promising to open up Outlook to competing CRM solutions and other services.\nIt worked. Today, Microsoft announced that the EU has approved its acquisition of LinkedIn .\n“Today, the European Commission announced that it has cleared the acquisition,” Microsoft’s Brad Smith writes. “As a result, we’ve now obtained all of the regulatory approvals needed to complete the acquisition, and the deal will close in the coming days.”\nSponsored As part of this announcement, Microsoft confirmed that it had made concessions to the EU. It will continue to make the Office Add-in program and Office Store available to third-party professional social networking services, it will let IT disable LinkedIn integration in Office, and it will allow PC makers to disable any LinkedIn tiles or icons in Windows 10 should it decided to include such a feature.\n“With this regulatory process behind us, we can bring together two great companies and focus on even broader issues for the future,” Mr. Smith explains. “We’re excited to get started and committed to doing our part.”\n \nThe post Microsoft Acquisition of LinkedIn is Cleared by Regulators appeared first on Petri .\n",

      "text": "ZDNet Japan EU regulators approve Microsoft's LinkedIn purchase with concessions Microsoft expects its deal to acquired LinkedIn to close 'in the coming days,' now that EU regulators have given the pending acquisition their approval. \nMicrosoft expects the deal to acquire LinkedIn for $26.2 billion , which the company announced in June 2016, to close \"in the coming days,\" according to a blog post by Brad Smith, President and Chief Legal Officer. \nRegulators in the U.S., Canada, Brazil and South Africa already had cleared the deal. \nAs reported in November, Microsoft did make some concessions as part of the EU regulatory process. Microsoft's blog post mentions these \"commitments regarding the company's support for other professional social network services\" for the next five years. \nMicrosoft will continue to make its Office add-in program available to other third-party professional social networking services. The company has committed to making \"promotional opportunities\" in the Office Store to these kinds of social networking services, as well. \nMicrosoft officials pledged to enable IT admins and users to decide whether to display in the user interface the LinkedIn profile and \"activity information that may be integrated in the future,\" today's blog post says. And if there is a LinkedIn application or tile for Windows PCs for Microsoft that's included in Windows, Microsoft will make sure PC makers can choose whether or not to install them in the European Economic Area. Users will be able to uininstall the application and tile if they choose to do so, and they won't be subjected to Windows prompting them to install a LinkedIn application. \nSalesforce CEO Marc Benioff had been agitating to get EU antitrust regulators to give the Microsoft-LinkedIn deal extra scrutiny before clearing the purchase. Salesforce also bid on LinkedIn and lost to Microsoft. \nMicrosoft officials have said Microsoft and LinkedIn's data graphs are mutually complementary . Microsoft is expected to use LinkedIn's data and algorithms to bolster its Dynamics CRM/ERP line, its Office family of products and services, and other parts of the company's productivity-related businesses.
