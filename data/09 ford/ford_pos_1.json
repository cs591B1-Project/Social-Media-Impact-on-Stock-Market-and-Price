      "text": "Large \nFord is adding a new model to its crossover lineup here in North America. \nAutomotive News says Ford , with the help of DJ Khaled, will debut the EcoSport for the North American market just in time for the Los Angeles Auto Show. The debut is taking place on Monday, just days ahead of the show opening its doors to the public. \nOne Ford spokesman confirmed the news, but didn’t say when it’ll go on-sale in North America. Exact details are still under wraps, but the EcoSport has been available pretty much everwhere except North America since 2003. \nThe current, second-generation EcoSport debuted in 2013. Given it shares its underpinnings with the current Fiesta , it wouldn’t be too crazy to expect the Fiesta’s 1.6-litre four-cylinder and 1.5L turbo-three under the skin, but we’re not holding our breath for the Fiesta ST’s turbo-four. \nWe’ll bring you the latest on the Ford EcoSport when it’s revealed next Monday, plus many more L.A. debuts throughout the week.

      "text": "Copy \nA Ford that can park itself \nFord is taking assisted parking to another level. Its Enhanced Active Park Assist will control steering, gear selection and forward and reverse motion at a push of a button. \nThe system can automatically enter and exit a parallel parking space and can reverse the vehicle into a perpendicular space. \nIt also uses sensors to locate suitable spaces. \nThe car will even brake if it is backing out in the path of a vehicle or pedestrian. \nFord is also developing a new technology that could help drivers steer around stopped or slower vehicles to help avoid collisions. \nAnother driver assistance on the cards is Wrong Way Alert, which uses a windscreen-mounted camera and information from the car's navigation system to provide drivers with audible and visual warnings when driving through two \"No Entry\" signs on a motorway ramp. \nThe system will first be available for customers in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. \nMercedes-Benz launches S-class Cabriolet \nThe Mercedes-Benz S-class Cabriolet (pictured) is back after 45 years. \nThe car will satisfy those who find a convertible from Bentley or Rolls- Royce ostentatious. \nThe S500 Cabriolet's 4.7-litre biturbo V8 makes 455bhp and 700Nm of torque to propel the 5m-long 2.1-tonne topless cruiser to 100kmh in 4.6 seconds. \nThe roof can be operated at up to 60kmh. The S500 Cabriolet is retailing at $679,888. \nBorneo Motors donates $100,000 to Singapore Children's Society \nLast Friday, the Singapore Children's Society received a donation of $100,000 from Toyota agent Borneo Motors at the 27th Edition of Toyota Classics. \nThe presentation was held at Capitol Theatre. \nThis year's Toyota Classics marks the start of Borneo Motors' 50th- anniversary celebration as well as the 50th anniversary of Singapore-Japan diplomatic relations. \nIce-drive in Lapland \nJaguar-Land Rover has opened its first ice driving academy, offering enthusiasts a driving-and-travel adventure on the edge of the Arctic Circle. \nBased at the company's cold-weather testing facility in Lapland, Sweden, guests at the Ice Academy will have the opportunity to push themselves to the limit in Jaguar and Land Rover high-performance vehicles. \nExperts will be on hand to guide participants. \nModels such as the Jaguar MKII, MKVII and XK150, and Land Rover Series I, Series II and Series III without modern brakes, power steering or traction control will also be available alongside modern models. \nA three- and four-night programme starts at €2,490 (S$3,812) and includes accommodation, meals and transfers. \nFor more information, visit jaguar.com/icedrivesweden or landrover.com/icedrivesweden . \nAudi A5 Cabriolet is larger and lighter \nAudi's new A5 Cabriolet (pictured) boasts a larger interior, more comfort, convenience and class. \nIts torsional rigidity is said to have increased by 40 per cent, making it the stiffest topless car in its calls. Yet its weight has fallen by as much as 40kg. \nThree engines will be available initially - a 190bhp 2-litre turbodiesel, 218bhp 3-litre turbodiesel and a 252bhp 2-litre turbo petrol. \nA 190bhp 2-litre turbo petrol and 286bhp 3-litre turbodiesel will follow. \nSeat belt microphones and automatic acoustic hood with new one-touch operation will be standard fare. \nAn S5 Cabriolet with a 354bhp turbocharged V6 and all-wheel-drive will also be available. \nBMW 320i Gran Turismo M Sport gets an upgrade \nThe BMW 320i Gran Turismo M Sport (pictured) has arrived. \nAt 4,824mm long, the car is about 200mm longer than the other members of the 3-series family. \nIt comes with LED headlights for dipped and high beam and the LED front fog lamps. \nThe interior boasts upgraded materials and accents. Extra chrome around the controls and new decorative wood elements, colours and leather trim add to its premium feel. \nA wheelbase lengthened by 110mm (to 2,920mm) ensures lots of legroom. \nA large tailgate opens to reveal a 520-litre boot. The car has 184bhp going to its rear wheels. \nNissan Micra comes with car-sharing programme \nNissan is pioneering a new car-sharing scheme with the latest Micra hatch. \nNissan Intelligent Get & Go Micra hinges on social networking, allowing Nissan to profile-match consumers. \nLaunching initially in Paris later this year, cars are expected on the road by April next year. \nThe service, based on a unique algorithm that uses social profiling and geo-localisation technology, will match compatible owners with complementary driving needs to form a shared ownership community. \nWith bespoke monthly invoicing based on car usage, members can expect no surprises. \nSingapore-designed electric bike to debut at international design fair \nMotochimp (pictured), a Singapore-designed electric scooter, is launching at the Shenzhen International Industrial Design Fair this week. \nIt goes on sale first in Japan, with the rest of Asia, the United Kingdom and Europe to follow. \nPriced from US$2,000 (S$2,802), Motochimp can be charged in 60 minutes and has a range of up to 60km. \nIt is designed by Singapore's Vanda Electrics, the same company behind the upcoming Dendrobium electric supercar. \nChristopher Tan A version of this article appeared in the print edition of The Straits Times on November 12, 2016, with the headline 'Fast Lane'.

      "text": "Ford is betting on America's love of cars Published by Business Insider on Sun, 13 Nov 2016 This week Ford Motor Company unveiled a handful of technological ideas, like driver-assist features that use radar and sensors to give your car an extra pair of eyes on the road.One feature alerts you before you drive in the wrong direction. Another helps you steer away from an obstacle in situations where it's too late to apply the brakes.In the time that it takes for the driver to fully recognize that he or she is about to crash, the car is programmed to swerve into safety. Perhaps more exciting is that these features could come as early as the next two years.Then there's the sneak peek of finalists from the company's internal Last Mile Mobility Challenge, which asks employees to dream up ways to get drivers from the car to their final destination.The ideas revealed so far include a self-loading wheelchair for drivers with physical disabilities, a folding electric tricycle that doubles as a shopping cart, and intriguingly, a Segway-hoverboard hybrid that looks somewhat like an oversized Roomba, as TechCrunch keenly observes.These innovations come at a time when self-driving cars have yet to hit the road en masse, though the driver-assist technology seems subtly to be preparing us to get comfortable with the idea of yielding (almost) full control of the wheel to our vehicles. One feature the company is touting, for example, will park the car for you at the press of a button ''like magic,' says a test driver in Ford's promotional video. She sits back in her seat and watches as the car reverses itself into a spot along the curb, the steering wheel spinning all on its own.Despite the growing number of cities dreaming of a car-free future, or at least a multimodal one, Ford's latest ideas bet on Americans holding onto their love of cars and their tendency to commute alone. Unless the trunk of a Ford Focus can fit five of those Carr-E's, as the circular transport devices are called, it's an idea meant for the driver, and the driver alone. After all, as Richard Florida reported last year, the Census Bureau finds that 86 percent of U.S. workers still commute by car and more than 75 percent do so alone.At the same time, though, Americans don't experience the same enthusiasm and excitement as they once did for buying cars, a trend the Washington Postrecently described as 'America's once magical'now mundane'love affair with cars.' That's true at least among the younger crowd, according to a handful of studies out there.For city dwellers in general, the Post writes, owning a car is a hassle, especially when it comes to parking and traffic. And perhaps, that's one of the problems that car companies are trying to tackle, in particular with Ford's parking assistant feature and its Last Mile Mobility challenge. (Ford has not responded to a request for comment.)Ford is no stranger to how the world is rethinking commuting. For one thing, the company recently invested in mass- and microtransit, partnering with the ridehailing company Bridj to bring on-demand public transit to Kansas City, Missouri.But Ford is, after all, a car company and it's in their interest to keep the thrill of automobiles'autonomous or otherwise'alive. If you remember, the company was recently awarded a patent for rear wheel that doubles a 'self-propelled unicycle,' for when drivers want to ditch their cars in dense cities for the last mile and, as my colleague Adam Sneed writes, try feeling like Batman.SEE ALSO:Silicon Valley was worried about the wrong bubbleJoin the conversation about this storyNOW WATCH: This hidden iPhone feature will boost your reception",

      "text": "As a young journalist, I thrilled at invitations from automobile manufacturers to drive exotic cars in exotic locations. But there always was a troubling disconnect.\nWe journalists would arrive a day or night before the drive, which often would be arranged to run against the rush hour of the host location. The idea was to provide us the luxury of enjoying the luxury cars without traffic jams.\nWe could concentrate on the design and engineering of the subject automobiles without paying much attention to reality, which is that few of the world's roads are traveled by exotic cars because few of the world's motorists can afford them.\nThat reality is seen daily on highways such as Interstate 66, where models such as the subject of this week's review, the 2017 Ford Focus S sedan, abound.\nIt is a well-constructed compact car -- safe and fuel-efficient, affording 30 miles per gallon in the city and 42 miles per gallon on the highway using regular-grade gasoline. It has been around since 1998 and is a common sight on streets as diverse as those of the District of Columbia, London and Moscow.\nTechnology has kept the little Focus updated. But it has been aggressively matched in that endeavor by the South Koreans, who have loaded with value and likability models such as the Hyundai Elantra and Kia Forte. The Japanese, of course, understand the global market and have countered with affordable rides such as the Mazda 2 and Toyota Yaris.\nBut the little Focus keeps rolling on primarily because it is designed to safely and efficiently get you where you are going at a base price -- $18,175 -- that makes the car reasonably accessible.\nAccessibility and reliability trump the romance of \"fun to drive\" here, although the Focus is a nice, tight compact car that can be had with performance credibility if purchased as a Focus ST or RS. But most people who buy it are looking for the basics of reliability and economy and thus will get it in one of the more popular trim levels of S, SE, SEL or Titanium. The Focus also is available as an electric and hatchback SE EcoBoost.\nThe Focus S is basic personal transportation. You don't buy it to impress. Nor do you get it to zoom past the competition. You get it to get there. Period. And the little car does a very decent job of doing that.\nIt is equipped with a 2-liter, four-cylinder gasoline engine delivering 160 horsepower and 146 pound-feet of torque. A five-speed manual transmission is standard. A six-speed automatic is optional. Spend the extra money on the automatic. It will be worth it in one of the Washington area's traffic jams.\nI found the Focus S to be a good little get-about, although somewhat disconcerting after spending weeks in models that have jettisoned pieces such as ignition keys and locks in favor of push-button ignition. The Focus can be had with lots of modern safety technology. But it does appear to be getting a bit long in the tooth.\nStill, it makes sense as a basic transportation car, particularly in S trim. It remains a \"buy\" here.\n-- -- --\nBottom line: The 2017 Focus S, practically unchanged from the 2016 model year, is safe, reliable and, depending on traffic patterns, enjoyable basic transportation.\nRide, acceleration and handling: It gets decent marks in all three areas.\nHead-turning quotient: It has the styling signature of the larger Ford Fusion, which clearly has \"borrowed\" styling cues from the Aston Martin, which once was a Ford property.\nBody style/layout: The Ford Focus is a compact, front-engine, front-wheel-drive economy car available as a sedan or hatchback. An electric version is also for sale.\nEngine/transmission for Focus S: It comes with a 2.0-liter, 16-valve, four-cylinder gasoline engine with variable valve timing (160 horsepower, 146 pound-feet of torque). A five-speed manual transmission is standard. A six-speed automatic is optional.\nCapacities: Seating is for five people. Cargo capacity is 13.2 cubic feet. The fuel tank holds 12.4 gallons of gasoline. Regular grade is fine.\nMileage: I averaged 36 miles per gallon mostly in highway driving.\nSafety: Standard equipment includes ventilated front disc brakes, rear drum brakes; four-wheel anti-lock brake protection; traction and stability control; post-collision safety system; side and head air bags.\nPricing: The 2017 Ford Focus S starts at $18,175 with a dealer's invoice price of $17,357. Price as tested is $21,190, including $2,140 in options (automatic transmission, cosmetics and other items) and an $875 factory-to-dealer shipment charge. Dealer's price as tested is $20,266.\n  Business Autos Washington Post",

      "text": "Joey Logano won the CAN-AM 500 at Phoenix on Sunday to advance into the Championship 4.   Joey Logano, Ford win NASCAR at Phoenix as Sprint Cup final four is set Team Penske driver will be joined by Edwards, Johnson and Kyle Busch \n  \nJoey Logano earned a return trip to the Championship 4 at Homestead-Miami Speedway after a year’s absence.Kyle Busch will head to the South Florida track to try to defend his 2015 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series title.And Kevin Harvick won’t be competing for the title for the first time since NASCAR debuted its elimination Chase format in 2014. Needing a victory to advance, as it turned out, Harvick finished fourth in Sunday’s Can-Am 500 at Phoenix International Raceway.In a race that featured spectacular side-by-side racing and a substitute driver who dominated the first 250 laps of the event after starting from the pole, Logano beat Busch to the finish line by .587 seconds in the second of two overtimes.Logano’s first victory at the 1-mile track couldn’t have been timelier. The win -- his third of the season and the 17th of his career -- gave Logano an automatic berth in the Championship 4 race, set for next Sunday.“This feels so good,” said Logano, who took the lead from the fourth position when a wreck involving race leader Matt Kenseth, Busch and polestitter Alex Bowman ended the first attempt at overtime. “I've never felt this good about a win before. There was so much on the line and everyone brings their A game when it comes to winning championships, and this team did it.“Man, this feels so good. I had a good restart there at the end (in the second overtime) and holding off Kyle to try to get this thing into Miami. We're racing for a championship now. We did exactly what we had to do. We've got to go to Homestead and do the same thing…“I'm speechless right now. I feel like I just won the Daytona 500 again.”Busch earned the last available spot in the season finale with his runner-up finish, but it came at the expense of Kenseth, his Joe Gibbs Racing teammate. Kenseth led the field to the first overtime restart on Lap 317, with Bowman beside him.From the third spot, Busch had a strong run and dived to the inside of Bowman, who went low to block. Busch shoved Bowman forward, and when Kenseth turned down from the outside lane in turn one, thinking he was clear, contact from Bowman’s Chevrolet sent Kenseth’s Toyota spinning in an accident that knocked the 2003 series champion out of the Championship 4.For Busch, the incident made advancing to the finale bittersweet.“Well, right now it feels pretty (lousy), but tomorrow it might feel a lot better,” Busch said. “I'm not sure, depends on what Matt's interpretation is, and whether or not he can forgive. You know, I just feel really bad about what happened there on that last restart. It just wasn't what I anticipated having happen, and I just feel bad. The 20 (Kenseth) should have been the Gibbs car to go through, and I was just trying to make a position there on the 88, felt like I was to his inside and had the position…“It translated into the 20 crashing. That's not how at all I foresaw that going. I was hoping I could get the 88 underneath him and force him up and have him kind of block the 22 and check up the outside row and then I could have a position between me and the 22 and get myself and the 20 in. Math just didn't quite work out that way today.”In a race that went 12 laps beyond its scheduled distance of 312 laps, Kyle Larson ran third, followed by Harvick, Kurt Busch, Bowman and Denny Hamlin. Like Kenseth, who finished 21st after the late wreck, Harvick, Hamlin and Kurt Busch all were eliminated from the Chase.Hamlin finished six points behind JGR teammate Kyle Busch in the race for the last Championship 4 berth.Driving in place of Dale Earnhardt Jr., Bowman led the first 92 laps and 194 overall in posting the best finish of his career. But his strong performance was tinged with regret.“We're all here to win races and doing everything we can to win races,” said Bowman, who grew up in nearby Tucson. “I don't think Kyle wrecked Matt. I don't think I wrecked Matt. I think the situation, it just all, it all happened like that.“It's unfortunate. But I don't think you can really place the blame on one person. It just sucks for Matt. I don't know Matt. He's probably really mad at me right now, I'd imagine, but hopefully we can move past it and race clean at Homestead.” \nRace Results 1. (4) Joey Logano (C), Ford, 324. 2.

      "text": "share Usagi Tsukino, otherwise known as Sailor Moon, is a teenage girl with pretty basic tastes: She likes eating cake, fighting evil by moonlight, winning love by daylight and the new Ford Fusion. That last one is according to the American automobile manufacturer, whose latest ad stars the classic anime character fawning over the 2017-model sedan. It’s a bizarre 45 seconds, made all the more so by Usagi’s talking cat companion Luna chiming in about the Fusion’s fancy new features. Neither one can drive, but they’re apparently both well-versed in the world of motor vehicles. We can’t complain about some new Sailor Moon content in the style of the original cartoon, which premiered nearly 25 years ago. Viz Media released a new English dub for the anime in 2014, and it’s those voice actors who wax rhapsodic over the Fusion in Ford’s ad. Fellow Western-based anime distributor Funimation has collaborated with Ford as well, showing Dragon Ball Z fans that its super-powered fighters are just as taken with the company’s cars . Metal Gear Solid even got in on the action earlier this year , giving Konami’s stealth classic and Sailor Moon something in common beyond a love of anime. All of the ads are part of a campaign that Ford calls, appropriately, “Overdubs.” We’re now taking bets on which series will be co-opted for the next installment. More From Polygon",

      "text": "Jeremy Korzeniewski You knew it was coming , and here it is: Ford officially pulled the covers off its EcoSport subcompact SUV today ahead of the LA Auto Show. The timing could hardly be better. According to Ford, there were about 70,000 subcompact 'utes sold in 2011, which makes the 276,000 sold in 2015 a four-fold increase. And by 2020, the Blue Oval expects 2015's total to double. Considering the Ford EcoSport is the best-selling compact SUV outside the United States, the automaker seems likely to become a segment leader in short order. The Ford EcoSport is nothing if not cute. The automaker's well-worn and angular fascia leads the way, followed by a steeply raked windshield. Upright sides and muscular wheel arches lead the eyes to a prominent C-pillar. Faux skid plates front and rear join lower-bodyside cladding to lend a modestly appropriate off-road look. Not that anyone will ever actually take an EcoSport very far off the beaten path, of course. Four trim levels will be available, starting with S, moving to SE, SES, and finally Titanium. Pricing has not yet been announced. Inside, the EcoSport can look mature or extroverted, with the SES model getting copper trim and seat accents. An eight-inch screen floats above the center stack and features Sync 3, Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, all of which can send tunes through an optional 10-speaker, 675-watt B&O PLAY audio system from Harman. Power comes from either a 1.0-liter turbocharged EcoBoost three-cylinder for front-wheel-drive models or a 2.0-liter four-cylinder for buyers who opt for four-wheel drive. Horsepower and fuel efficiency aren't yet available, but both engines will be paired with a six-speed automatic transmission when the EcoSport goes on sale in early 2018. If you want to see the new EcoSport in person, you're in luck... assuming you live near Hollywood, that is. Register here for tickets to Ford's Go Small, Live Big experience, which runs on for two nights starting on Tuesday, November 15. There'll be plenty of live music and Snapchatting, along with lots of local food vendors, and, um... tiny houses. And even a bunch of tiny rescue animals – hedgehogs! – and exercise equipment.",

      "text": "A \nLOS ANGELES: Ford Motor Co is moving ahead with plans to shift production of small cars to Mexico from Michigan, while \"two very important products\" will be built in its U.S. factories, Chief Executive Officer Mark Fields told Reuters on Tuesday. \n\"We’re going forward with our plan to move production of the Ford Focus to Mexico, and importantly that’s to make room for two very important products we’ll be putting back into Michigan plants,\" Fields said in an interview on the sidelines of the Los Angeles Auto Show. \"There will be no job impact whatsoever with this move.\" \nPresident-elect Donald Trump has criticized Ford for the decision to shift production of Focus small cars to Mexico in 2018, and said he would consider levying tariffs on Mexican-made Fords. \nFord Chairman Bill Ford Jr. said last month he met with Trump to discuss the issue. Ford has countered Trump's criticism, saying the automaker, founded by his great-grandfather, makes more cars and trucks in the United States than any other automaker. \nFord also is moving ahead with plans to use factory capacity in other markets to fill gaps in its U.S. lineup. Company executives used the Los Angeles auto show to promote a small sport utility vehicle called the EcoSport that the company plans to ship into the United States from India. \n\"We already have the plants and investment in other parts of the world. It frees us up to make further investments in the U.S.,\" Fields said, pointing to the money invested to launch a new SuperDuty pickup at a plant in Kentucky. \nFord has cautioned investors that it sees demand for cars and light trucks hitting a plateau in the United States. Fields said heading into the last two months of the year \"we are seeing a tougher pricing environment.\" \n\"We expect the industry to be about the same as it was last year, probably a little lower on the retail side, and a continuing competitive pricing environment,\" Fields said. \n(Writing by Joe White; Editing by Lisa Shumaker and Jeffrey Benkoe) - Reuters",

      "text": "  11:04 am Ford has revealed its all-new EcoSport ahead of the Los Angeles Auto Show, providing the first look at the company's newest addition to its North American product lineup.Officially pronounced 'ek-oh sport' (not 'ee-koh sport'), the nameplate has been produced for other countries since 2003. In fact, Ford claims it is the best-selling compact SUV outside the US.The crossover borrows styling elements from the Blue Oval's larger crossovers, including the Escape. It features a streamlined profile and pronounced wheel arches, while lower unpainted cladding brings a slightly rugged appearance.Buyers can opt for a front-wheel-drive edition powered by a 1.0-liter turbocharged EcoBoost three-cylinder engine, while a 2.0-liter four-cylinder mill is mated to an intelligent four-wheel-drive system.The compact crossover is presumably budget focused, but Ford offers a few high-end features in top trim levels. The Titanium edition boasts a Ford-exclusive B&O Play sound system with 10 speakers and a 675-watt amplifier. Alternatively, the 4WD SES package brings sport-tuned suspension and steering, along with copper accents for the interior and sport seats.Reflecting the clear focus on youth buyers, Ford claims the EcoSport is the first-ever vehicle reveal on Snapchat. Additional details will likely be announced at the LA Auto Show. \n ",

      "title": "Meet the Facelifted, India-bound Ford EcoSport",
      "text": "The updated EcoSport, which will be launched in India next year, has received a fresh new face, cabin and additional features\n \n\nIn what the makers claim to be the first ever Snapchat reveal for a vehicle, Ford has introduced the facelifted EcoSport on the social media platform. The facelifted compact SUV will make its public debut at the upcoming LA Motor Show and will hit showrooms in the USA by early 2018. What’s interesting is that the compact SUV will be exported from Ford’s Chennai plant, making it the first made-in-India Ford vehicle to hit the North American market. Also, this move suggests that we will get almost every new update and additional goodies that Ford has offered with the EcoSport facelift. Let us see what we can expect for the Indian market from the revealed American version. \n\nDesign \nFord has subtly updated the EcoSport on the whole, but it is the front profile that seems to have gone under the knife the most. The front fascia now features a chunkier chrome grille – a design element that’s in line with the other SUVs by the Blue Oval, such as the Kuga and the Edge. It is somewhat similar to the one in the second-gen Endeavour as well.\n \n\nThough the headlamps feature a profile similar to the current version, they look bulky and incorporate projector plus halogen lighting. And this time around, the indicators are placed lower in the fog lamp housing. There are no changes to the sides of the vehicle, save for the new set of alloys. \n\nAt the rear, the tail lamps are largely unchanged, but the American version of the EcoSport will not sport the mounted spare wheel. The outgoing EcoSport in the European market currently comes with a similar option. The Indian facelifted EcoSport, in all probability, will continue to feature the mounted spare wheel when the facelift goes on sale. \n\n\n\nCabin And Features \nAlthough the exterior hasn’t been altered much, Ford has completely overhauled the cabin, which perhaps will be the highlight of the facelifted EcoSport. It now features a brand-new steering wheel and a twin-dial instrument cluster, which is clearer to read and has grown in size compared to the outgoing version.\n\nThe central console features the ‘floating’ type touchscreen infotainment system, which was sorely missing in the present EcoSport. Like its American version, the EcoSport will probably share the Ford SYNC 3 infotainment system with the Endeavour in India ( the Endeavour has recently received the SYNC 3 unit ). It is a massive eight-inch unit that supports both Apple CarPlay and Google Android Auto, including Apple/Google maps for navigation. Most importantly, in the USA, the SYNC 3 in the EcoSport will be coupled to a 675-watt 10-speaker B&O (Bang and Olufsen) Play audio system, including B&O PLAY-branded tweeters and woofers in the front doors and a subwoofer in the back. This sound system is not likely to be offered in India. \n\nOne of the versions in the American market will also get copper accents for the interior and sport seats (as seen in the picture above). Though they look cool, the Indian version is unlikely to be offered with such options. We might get the all-black cabin with glossy black highlights (see the picture below). The updated EcoSport also comes with seven ambient lighting options.\n\nIt also features a new layout for the automatic climate control and new switch gears, which are borrowed from the Endeavour. Additionally, it offers two fast-charging USB ports placed below the climate control unit, along with a regular 12-volt socket at the front. It will also come with a 110-volt outlet positioned behind the centre console and another 12-volt outlet, allowing rear-seat passengers to stay plugged in. \n\nMechanicals \nIn the American market, the EcoSport will be available with the 1.0-litre three-cylinder EcoBoost turbo petrol along with a naturally aspirated 2.0-litre petrol. The latter will come standard with an AWD (all-wheel-drive) system. In the Indian market, the facelifted EcoSport is likely to remain unaltered and will continue to come with the 1.5-litre TDCi diesel along with the 1.5-litre Ti-VCT and the 1.0-litre EcoBoost petrol engine options. The probability of us getting the 2.0-litre petrol with AWD is very low.\nLaunch \nThe updated EcoSport will take on its existing rivals – such as the Maruti Suzuki Vitara Brezza and the Mahindra TUV300 and NuvoSport – when Ford launches it in India in mid-2017. Moreover, the 2017 EcoSport will also have to compete against the Honda WR-V since it will be launched in the first half of next year. The prices of the updated EcoSport are likely to shoot up because of the additional features and aesthetic upgrades, but the compact SUV is expected to be aggressively priced like the current version.\n\nRead More on: Ford Ecosport review \nRead full article on cardekho.com",

      "text": "MORE LOS ANGELES — Ford is moving fast to seize opportunities with cities to reduce traffic congestion in cities as it strives toward becoming a mobility company.\nThe Dearborn automaker and businessman Michael Bloomberg reached an agreement to work together less than a month after the former New York mayor announced the creation of a new philanthropic organization that will help cities prepare for self-driving cars and how best to use them to address city challenges.\nThe initiative was initially announced by Bloomberg Philanthropies and the Washington, D.C.-based Aspen Institute in October.\nOn Tuesday, Fields announced that Ford would join forces with Bloomberg Philanthropies.\n\"We’re discussing how we can work together to help create the city of tomorrow, incubating ideas around mobility and to accelerate solutions in cities,\" Fields said during his keynote speech at the Los Angeles Auto Show. \"Working with Bloomberg, we will collect the best ideas from around the world and put them into action.\"\nFord CEO Mark Fields takes a break from interviews with the broadcast media at the Los Angeles Auto Show on Tuesday, Nov. 15, 2016. (Photo: Brent Snavely)\nLater, Ford told the Free Press that the partnership came together in a matter of weeks.\n\"When the announcement came out from Bloomberg…our City Solutions Group immediately reached out,\" Fields said. \"That’s the benefit of having a team, this Ford City Solutions Group, that is living and working and eating this stuff 24/7.\"\nFord's City Solutions team was created to work with cities and study their transportation needs and to figure out how the self-driving cars, ride-sharing services and shuttle services can interact with more traditional mass transit systems.\nThe idea is to create better links between the vehicles the automotive industry produces, the services automakers can provide and transportation services.\nThe City Solutions team is just one part of a Ford Smart Mobility, a division Ford created earlier this year to oversee its mobility and autonomous vehicle development efforts.\n► Related: Bill Ford: Here's how we'll make a buck off mobility\n► Related: Toyota to test peer-to-peer car-sharing system that doesn't use keys\nJust six months ago, industry observers were saying Ford was moving slower than its competitors to develop self-driving vehicles and get involved in the emerging ride-sharing industry with companies like Uber and Lyft.\nBut after several acquisitions, Ford's declaration it will launch an autonomous car by 2020, Fields said that skepticism is dying down.\n\"We are just going through a very disciplined process of where to play, how to win and then what capabilities do we think we need,\" Fields said. \"From our standpoint, as you know, we are not in a race to make announcements. We want to do what’s right for the business and what’s right for the customers.\"\nContact Brent Snavely: 313-222-6512 or bsnavely@freepress.com. Follow him on Twitter @BrentSnavely.",

      "text": "Hemmings contributor on at 8:00 am Share \nBuilding Fords in the new San Jose plant, 1955. Black and white photos courtesy Ford Motor Company archives. \n[Editor’s Note: This piece comes to us from Myles Kornblatt, the curator at the Miami Auto Museum. He contributes to multiple automotive publications and is the Automotive Correspondent for the Florida Weekly.] \nA complete transformation can sometimes eclipse a lifetime of significance. Some people only know Clint Eastwood as a director, MTV used to be Music Television, and few realize some of the most iconic Fords came from where people now buy Grand Theft Auto. \nFord’s San Jose Plant is now a shopping center known as The Great Mall. It was the birthplace of the Skyliner hardtop convertible, entry-level Edsels, and the three generations of Mustangs (including all of the 1965-67 cars that would become Shelby GTs). And today this former factory still has a secret hidden within its retail walls. \nNew Mustangs on the line, 1964. \nBack in 1953, Ford was replacing its pre-WWII bay front Richmond plant in Northern California with a facility that offered more space. Inexpensive land was purchased north of San Jose, and so the facility is often linked to that city. But that’s not entirely true. The town of Milpitas officially incorporated that area in-between the time Ford secured the land and the plant opened on March 1, 1955. \nThe huge 1.4 million square-foot facility often served as Ford’s outpost to produce the most popular models for distribution along the west coast. By 1962, the busy factory churned out 135,963 vehicles annually. Over the years it was home to Falcons, Escorts, Rancheros, F-Series pickups, Pintos, many Mercury vehicles, and of course, Mustangs. But as competition increased throughout the 1970s and 80s, this boomtown went bust. \nAssembling Pintos and Mustang IIs, 1974. \nThe factory closed its doors on May 20, 1983. It would remain unused for over a decade since there are very few operations that need this amount of space. The huge indoor structure could only serve as a large-scale way to offer products to the masses, thus it seems only fitting that in 1994 it reopened as The Great Mall of the Bay Area. \nA Ford exhibit pays homage to the mall’s former purpose. This and remaining photos by Myles Kornblatt. \nToday the one-time industrial complex is far more bright and airy, and the most mass-produced item is likely the food court’s corndog. But the echoes of iconic cars are still felt throughout the complex. It permeates everything from the industrial roof trusses to how the feeder roads bear names like Falcon, Comet, and Mustang. There’s even a storefront at the entrance to Neighborhood #4 that has a factory timeline, artifacts, and a 1957 Fairlane 500 Skyliner. \nWhile this makes for a worthwhile visit for Ford fans in the area, there is one more hidden piece that is the most interesting. Fire codes are important to all buildings, and in this case, they also saved a portion of the original factory. \nAs this fire corridor demonstrates, the Great Mall has plenty of space to work with. \nThe standard mall is one continuous hallway with emergency exits leading from a store’s rear directly to the outside. But this former Ford factory is so massive that developers created an entire interior and exterior loop of shops under one roof. That means all of the inner stores have emergency exits that filter into one central location that then channels people outside of the building. \nArea street signs hint at the site’s former purpose. \nSound confusing? Just think of it as a large jelly donut, except instead of a gooey center, it’s hallowed Mustang ground. \nUnlike the public spaces, the interior fire exit corridor did not need to be remodeled from its factory days. The space is purposely uncluttered, but the tracks on the cement floor are still visible. The roof remains unpainted and largely untouched from its industrial days. \n2016: The roof truss of the Great Mall looks remarkably similar to the building’s assembly line years. \nOur tour guide for this private space was Michael Strle, General Manager of The Great Mall. He is a local with connections to the Ford days, which makes him the exact person enthusiasts want as a gatekeeper to this secret. Strle’s sister-in-law’s father was a blacksmith in the factory, and he might even pass along a tale or two that friends have told him over the years. Some of these go against the better-known histories of very rare cars (including one about a Cobra that went missing within these walls). Strle might be spreading folklore to keep the spirit alive, or maybe he has some exclusive million-dollar info…either way, we all WANT his stories to be true. \nIt’s not suggested that anyone reading this try to view the inside corridor. Designed for high traffic use, the space is meticulously litter-free – all those loose Mustang bolts have been swept away decades ago. So sneaking back there will only set off alarms, and a chat with authorities is not worth the price of admission. Instead, the idea is to enjoy the pictures, tour the public history, and know that any classic Ford from the San Jose family can still find its soul (and a snow cone) at The Great Mall.",

Fields announced in September that small-car production will shift from a plant in Michigan to Mexico, to cut costs. The Michigan plant will stay open and shift to making more profitable mid-size cars, pickups and SUVs.\nLate Thursday, Ford “confirmed with the President-elect that our small Lincoln utility vehicle made at the Louisville Assembly plant will stay in Kentucky,” Reuters reported. However, Ford’s statement did not indicate Lincoln production ever planned to move to Mexico.\nTrump had been highly critical of Ford on the campaign trail, calling the shift to Mexico “a disgrace.” and threatening heavy tariffs on Fords made in Mexico.\nIn an interview with Reuters earlier this week , Fields specifically cited the Louisville truck plant, where Ford will build a new line of pickups, as a beneficiary of production shifts to other countries: “We already have the plants and investment in other parts of the world. It frees us up to make further investments in the U.S.”\nFord plans to build two plants in Mexico by 2019, but has said no U.S. jobs would be lost.\nFord employs almost 10,000 workers at its two Kentucky plants.\nLincoln production had been proposed to shift out of Louisville in 2015 — but to Chicago , not Mexico.\nMore from MarketWatch Donald Trump's Possible Cabinet Picks Opinion Journal: The New Trump Democrats How Might Donald Trump Shape the Supreme Court?",

By Jim Tankersley November 17 at 10:56 PM Follow @jimtankersley US President-elect Donald Trump speaks to the press following a meeting with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell at the Capitol in Washington, DC, on November 10, 2016 / AFP / NICHOLAS KAMM (Photo credit should read NICHOLAS KAMM/AFP/Getty Images) \nPresident-elect Donald Trump claimed credit on Thursday for keeping a Ford plant in Kentucky from moving to Mexico. But the company never planned to move the entire plant, only one of its production lines. Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky - no Mexico \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 18, 2016 I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 18, 2016 \nFord has never announced any plans to move either its Kentucky Truck Plant in Louisville, which produces the Lincoln Navigator, or the Louisville Assembly Plant, which produces the Lincoln MKC, to Mexico. \nIn a statement on Thursday night, following Trump's tweet, the company said it had told Trump it would cancel a plan to shift production of a single model — the MKC — from Kentucky to Mexico. The company last year indicated it would be moving MKC production out of Louisville, though it did not announce where it was going. At the time, union leaders said the shift would not cost any jobs in Kentucky. \n\"Today, we confirmed with the President-elect that our small Lincoln utility vehicle made at the Louisville Assembly Plant will stay in Kentucky,\" the company said in a statement. \"We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States.\" \nIn a follow-up email exchange, a Ford spokeswoman confirmed that the MKC production had been slated to move to Mexico. \nThis week, Ford chief executive Mark Fields reiterated that it was moving forward with plans to shift production of the Ford Focus to Mexico from Michigan. \nTrump has criticized those plans, which the company says will not cost any American jobs, because other models will be produced in the Michigan plant instead. \nIn an interview with Reuters , Fields highlighted the investments the company was making in domestic plants -- most notably, in Kentucky. \nFord announced a $1.3 billion investment in the Kentucky Truck Plant late last year. It said the move would create 2,000 new jobs. \nBill Ford Jr., the company's executive chairman, said in October that he had met with Trump over the then-candidate's frequent campaign attacks on Ford's decision to move small-car production to Mexico. \n\"I've had a very good meeting with him,\" Ford Jr. told the Economic Club of Washington. \"He's a very good listener and he knows the facts.\" \nThis isn't the first time Trump has misstated facts about a Ford move. In October 2015, he tweeted that the company had halted plans to build a factory in Mexico and would locate in Ohio instead, and he claimed credit for the decision. The company said he was wrong, and that it was continuing to build its plant in Mexico. \nTrump appeared to be relying on information gleaned from an article posted on a website of a shop that sells business cards and door hangers.",

      "text": "U.S. Trump just took credit for stopping Ford from moving a plant to Mexico. But it wasn't planning to. \nIn this Sept. 30, 2016 photo from Ford Motor Company, the automotive giant officially welcomed the 2017 Ford F-Series Super Duty to Kentucky Truck Plant. Ford officials confirmed Thursday that company representatives discussed with President-elect Donald Trump that their \"small Lincoln utility vehicle made at the Louisville Assembly Plant will stay in Kentucky,\" but never had plans to move the entire factory after investing $1.3 billion in the plant last year. \nSam VarnHagen/Courtesy of the Ford Motor Company More \nBy Jim Tankersley | The Washington Post | Published: November 17, 2016 \nPresident-elect Donald Trump claimed credit on Thursday for keeping a Ford plant in Kentucky from moving to Mexico. But the company never planned to move the entire plant, only one of its production lines. \nOn Thursday night, Trump tweeted: Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky - no Mexico \nThen followed it up with this tweet: I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me! \nFord has never announced any plans to move either its Kentucky Truck Plant in Louisville, which produces the Lincoln Navigator, or the Louisville Assembly Plant, which produces the Lincoln MKC, to Mexico. \nIn a statement on Thursday night, following Trump's tweet, the company said it had told Trump it would cancel a plan to shift production of a single model - the MKC - from Kentucky to Mexico. The company last year indicated it would be moving MKC production out of Louisville, though it did not announce where it was going. At the time, union leaders said the shift would not cost any jobs in Kentucky. \n\"Today, we confirmed with the President-elect that our small Lincoln utility vehicle made at the Louisville Assembly Plant will stay in Kentucky,\" the company said in a statement. \"We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States.\" \nIn a follow-up email exchange, a Ford spokeswoman confirmed that the MKC production had been slated to move to Mexico. \nThis week, Ford chief executive Mark Fields reiterated that it was moving forward with plans to shift production of the Ford Focus to Mexico from Michigan. \nTrump has criticized those plans, which the company says will not cost any American jobs, because other models will be produced in the Michigan plant instead. \nIn an interview with Reuters, Fields highlighted the investments the company was making in domestic plants -- most notably, in Kentucky. \nFord announced a $1.3 billion investment in the Kentucky Truck Plant late last year. It said the move would create 2,000 new jobs. \nBill Ford Jr., the company's executive chairman, said in October that he had met with Trump over the then-candidate's frequent campaign attacks on Ford's decision to move small-car production to Mexico. \n\"I've had a very good meeting with him,\" Ford Jr. told the Economic Club of Washington. \"He's a very good listener and he knows the facts.\" related articles",

The Washington Post 46 mins ago Jim Tankersley © Luke Sharrett/Bloomberg Newly manufactured Ford and Lincoln sports utility vehicles (SUV) are seen before undergoing an assembly audit at the Ford Motor Co. assembly plant in Louisville, Kentucky, U.S., on Tuesday, April 28, 2015.\nPresident-elect Donald Trump claimed credit on Thursday for keeping a Ford plant in Kentucky from moving to Mexico.

Ford CEO Mark Fields announced in September (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/ford-to-shift-us-small-car-production-to-mexico-2016-09-14)that small-car production will shift from a plant in Michigan to Mexico, to cut costs. The Michigan plant will stay open and shift to making more profitable mid-size cars, pickups and SUVs.\nLate Thursday, Ford \"confirmed with the President-elect that our small Lincoln utility vehicle made at the Louisville Assembly plant will stay in Kentucky,\" Reuters reported. However, Ford's statement did not indicate Lincoln production ever planned to move to Mexico.\nTrump had been highly critical of Ford on the campaign trail, calling the shift to Mexico \"a disgrace.\" (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/trump-rips-fords-move-to-shift-us-small-car-production-to-mexico-2016-09-15) and threatening heavy tariffs on Fords made in Mexico.\nIn an interview with Reuters (http://www.reuters.com/article/us-ford-ceo-idUSKBN13A2LK)earlier this week (http://fortune.com/2016/11/15/ford-move-mexico-trump/), Fields specifically cited the Louisville truck plant, where Ford will build a new line of pickups, as a beneficiary of production shifts to other countries: \"We already have the plants and investment in other parts of the world.

      "text": "By Mike Murphy\nNo indications that Kentucky Lincoln plants were planning to move production\nPresident-elect Donald Trump took credit Thursday night for keeping a Ford plant in Kentucky -- even though there were no indications the factory was leaving in the first place.\nIn a pair of tweets, Trump said he worked with Ford Motor Co. (F) CEO Mark Fields to keep a Lincoln plant in Kentucky instead of Mexico.\n(https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/799432403727028224)\n(https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/799435824622252032)\nFord has two factories in Louisville, Ky., that make Lincolns, but neither plant was scheduled to close or to have production shift to Mexico. Fields announced in September (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/ford-to-shift-us-small-car-production-to-mexico-2016-09-14)that small-car production will shift from a plant in Michigan to Mexico, to cut costs. The Michigan plant will stay open and shift to making more profitable mid-size cars, pickups and SUVs.\nLate Thursday, Ford \"confirmed with the President-elect that our small Lincoln utility vehicle made at the Louisville Assembly plant will stay in Kentucky,\" Reuters reported. However, Ford's statement did not indicate Lincoln production ever planned to move to Mexico.\nTrump had been highly critical of Ford on the campaign trail, calling the shift to Mexico \"a disgrace.\" (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/trump-rips-fords-move-to-shift-us-small-car-production-to-mexico-2016-09-15) and threatening heavy tariffs on Fords made in Mexico.\nIn an interview with Reuters (http://www.reuters.com/article/us-ford-ceo-idUSKBN13A2LK)earlier this week (http://fortune.com/2016/11/15/ford-move-mexico-trump/), Fields specifically cited the Louisville truck plant, where Ford will build a new line of pickups, as a beneficiary of production shifts to other countries: \"We already have the plants and investment in other parts of the world. It frees us up to make further investments in the U.S.\"\nFord plans to build two plants in Mexico by 2019, but has said no U.S. jobs would be lost.\nFord employs almost 10,000 workers at its two Kentucky plants.\nLincoln production had been proposed to shift out of Louisville in 2015 -- but to Chicago (http://www.courier-journal.com/story/money/companies/2015/11/09/ford-workers-could-get-10k-signing-bonus/75457372/), not Mexico.\n-Mike Murphy; 2322ET\n ",

      "text": " Google+\nDamon Winter/The New York Times\nPresident-elect Donald Trump.\nBy Jim Tankersley The Washington Post November 18, 2016\nPresident-elect Donald Trump claimed credit on Thursday for keeping a Ford plant in Kentucky from moving to Mexico. But the company never planned to move the entire plant, only one of its production lines.\nOn Thursday night, Trump tweeted: Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky - no Mexico\nAdvertisement\nThen followed it up with this tweet: I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!\nFord has never announced any plans to move either its Kentucky Truck Plant in Louisville, which produces the Lincoln Navigator, or the Louisville Assembly Plant, which produces the Lincoln MKC, to Mexico.\nGet Breaking News in your inbox: Find out about important news stories as soon as they break Sign In a statement on Thursday night, following Trump’s tweet, the company said it had told Trump it would cancel a plan to shift production of a single model - the MKC - from Kentucky to Mexico. The company last year indicated it would be moving MKC production out of Louisville, though it did not announce where it was going. At the time, union leaders said the shift would not cost any jobs in Kentucky.\n‘‘Today, we confirmed with the President-elect that our small Lincoln utility vehicle made at the Louisville Assembly Plant will stay in Kentucky,’’ the company said in a statement. ‘‘We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States.’’\nIn a follow-up email exchange, a Ford spokeswoman confirmed that the MKC production had been slated to move to Mexico.\nAdvertisement\nThis week, Ford chief executive Mark Fields reiterated that it was moving forward with plans to shift production of the Ford Focus to Mexico from Michigan.\nTrump has criticized those plans, which the company says will not cost any American jobs, because other models will be produced in the Michigan plant instead.\nIn an interview with Reuters, Fields highlighted the investments the company was making in domestic plants -- most notably, in Kentucky.\nFord announced a $1.3 billion investment in the Kentucky Truck Plant late last year. It said the move would create 2,000 new jobs.\nBill Ford Jr., the company’s executive chairman, said in October that he had met with Trump over the then-candidate’s frequent campaign attacks on Ford’s decision to move small-car production to Mexico.\n‘‘I’ve had a very good meeting with him,’’ Ford Jr. told the Economic Club of Washington. ‘‘He’s a very good listener and he knows the facts.’’",

But Advertisement Trump just took credit for stopping Ford from moving a plant to Mexico. But it wasn’t planning to. https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk.../#comments \"This isn't the first time Trump has misstated facts about a Ford move. In October 2015, he tweeted that the company had halted plans to build a factory in Mexico and would locate in Ohio instead, and he claimed credit for the decision. The company said he was wrong, and that it was continuing to build its plant in Mexico. Trump appeared to be relying on information gleaned from an article posted on a website of a shop that sells business cards and door hangers.\" LoP Guest Post: #2 RE: Trump just took credit for stopping Ford from moving a plant to Mexico. But President-elect tweeting outright lies to his adoring fans who increasingly resemble Jonestown with the f*cking kool-aid in hand. totally going to pivot any day now..it's coming..just you wait. His modus operandi is telling the people lies and instilling fears in groups of people. By January the country will be engulfed in mass hysteria. Post: #3 RE: Trump just took credit for stopping Ford from moving a plant to Mexico. But Who gives a f*#k about small fries in the big picture the man campaigned against nafta, speaking out against 3 former globalist traitor presidents and he did so 25+ years ago. He has an extremely lengthy track record warning people against Nafta. ImagineHOW MANY f*cking FACTORIES HE WOULD HAVE SAVED HAD THEY LISTENED 25 f*cking YEARS AGO.

      "title": "UPDATE: Trump takes credit for keeping Ford factory -- but was it ever moving?",
      "text": "By Mike Murphy\nNo indications that Kentucky Lincoln plants were planning to close\nPresident-elect Donald Trump took credit Thursday night for keeping a Ford plant in Kentucky -- even though there were no indications the factory was leaving in the first place.\nIn a pair of tweets, Trump said he worked with Ford Motor Co. (F) Chairman Bill Ford Jr. to keep a Lincoln plant in Kentucky instead of Mexico.\n(https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/799432403727028224)\n(https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/799435824622252032)\nFord has two factories in Louisville, Ky., that make Lincolns, but neither plant was scheduled to close. Ford CEO Mark Fields announced in September (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/ford-to-shift-us-small-car-production-to-mexico-2016-09-14)that small-car production will shift from a plant in Michigan to Mexico, to cut costs. The Michigan plant will stay open and shift to making more profitable mid-size cars, pickups and SUVs.\nLate Thursday, Ford \"confirmed with the President-elect that our small Lincoln utility vehicle made at the Louisville Assembly plant will stay in Kentucky,\" Reuters reported (http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-ford-motor-idUSKBN13D08J). \"We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States,\" Ford said in the statement.\nHowever, that statement did not indicate that Ford ever planned to close either Lincoln plant.\nThe Washington Post reported (https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/11/17/trump-just-took-credit-for-stopping-ford-from-moving-a-plant-to-mexico-but-it-was-planning-to/?hpid=hp_hp-top-table-main_wonk-ford-1120pm%3Ahomepage%2Fstory)late Thursday that Ford told Trump it was canceling a plan to shift a single line of production -- of Lincoln MKC models -- from Louisville to Mexico. Ford told the Post that the shift would not have resulted in any job losses in Kentucky.\nTrump had been highly critical of Ford on the campaign trail, calling the shift to Mexico \"a disgrace.\" (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/trump-rips-fords-move-to-shift-us-small-car-production-to-mexico-2016-09-15) and threatening heavy tariffs on Fords made in Mexico.\nIn an interview with Reuters (http://www.reuters.com/article/us-ford-ceo-idUSKBN13A2LK)earlier this week (http://fortune.com/2016/11/15/ford-move-mexico-trump/), Fields specifically cited the Louisville truck plant, where Ford will build a new line of pickups, as a beneficiary of production shifts to other countries: \"We already have the plants and investment in other parts of the world. It frees us up to make further investments in the U.S.\"\nFord plans to build two plants in Mexico by 2019, but has said no U.S. jobs would be lost.\nFord employs almost 10,000 workers at its two Kentucky plants.\nLincoln production had been proposed to shift out of Louisville in 2015 -- but to Chicago (http://www.courier-journal.com/story/money/companies/2015/11/09/ford-workers-could-get-10k-signing-bonus/75457372/), not Mexico.\n-Mike Murphy;\n 18-16 0101ET\n ",

      "text": "Discuss: ! \n\"President-elect Donald Trump claimed credit on Thursday for keeping a Ford plant in Kentucky from moving to Mexico. But the company never planned to move the entire plant, only one of its production lines. Ford has never announced plans to move to Mexico either its Kentucky Truck Plant in Louisville, which produces the Lincoln Navigator, or the Louisville Assembly Plant, which produces the Lincoln MKC and the Ford Escape. \nIn a statement on Thursday night, following Trump's tweet, the company said it had told Trump it would cancel a plan to shift production of a single model — the MKC — from Kentucky to Mexico. The company last year indicated it would be moving MKC production out of Louisville, though it did not announce where it was going. At the time, union leaders said the shift would not cost any jobs in Kentucky, because Escape production would replace lost MKC production. \n“Today, we confirmed with the President-elect that our small Lincoln utility vehicle made at the Louisville Assembly Plant will stay in Kentucky,” the company said in a statement. “We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States.” \nIn a follow-up email exchange, a Ford spokeswoman confirmed that the MKC production had been slated to move to Mexico. \nThis week, Ford chief executive Mark Fields reiterated that it was moving forward with plans to shift production of the Ford Focus to Mexico from Michigan. \nTrump has criticized those plans, which the company says will not cost any American jobs, because other models will be produced in the Michigan plant instead. \nIn an interview with Reuters ....\" \n\nContinue reading; links and tweets in seed: https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/11/17/trump-just-took-credit-for-stopping-ford-from-moving-a-plant-to-mexico-but-it-was-planning-to/  ",

      "title": "Trump just took credit for stopping Ford from moving a plant to Mexico. But it wasn’t planning to. - The Boston Globe",
      "text": "Damon Winter/The New York Times President-elect Donald Trump. By Jim Tankersley The Washington Post November 18, 2016 \nPresident-elect Donald Trump claimed credit on Thursday for keeping a Ford plant in Kentucky from moving to Mexico. But the company never planned to move the entire plant, only one of its production lines. \nOn Thursday night, Trump tweeted: Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky - no Mexico Advertisement \nThen followed it up with this tweet: I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me! \nFord has never announced any plans to move either its Kentucky Truck Plant in Louisville, which produces the Lincoln Navigator, or the Louisville Assembly Plant, which produces the Lincoln MKC, to Mexico.

Sign up for more newsletters here \nIn a statement on Thursday night, following Trump’s tweet, the company said it had told Trump it would cancel a plan to shift production of a single model - the MKC - from Kentucky to Mexico. The company last year indicated it would be moving MKC production out of Louisville, though it did not announce where it was going. At the time, union leaders said the shift would not cost any jobs in Kentucky. \n‘‘Today, we confirmed with the President-elect that our small Lincoln utility vehicle made at the Louisville Assembly Plant will stay in Kentucky,’’ the company said in a statement. ‘‘We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States.’’ \nIn a follow-up email exchange, a Ford spokeswoman confirmed that the MKC production had been slated to move to Mexico. Advertisement \nThis week, Ford chief executive Mark Fields reiterated that it was moving forward with plans to shift production of the Ford Focus to Mexico from Michigan. \nTrump has criticized those plans, which the company says will not cost any American jobs, because other models will be produced in the Michigan plant instead. \nIn an interview with Reuters, Fields highlighted the investments the company was making in domestic plants -- most notably, in Kentucky. \nFord announced a $1.3 billion investment in the Kentucky Truck Plant late last year. It said the move would create 2,000 new jobs. \nBill Ford Jr., the company’s executive chairman, said in October that he had met with Trump over the then-candidate’s frequent campaign attacks on Ford’s decision to move small-car production to Mexico. \n‘‘I’ve had a very good meeting with him,’’ Ford Jr. told the Economic Club of Washington. ‘‘He’s a very good listener and he knows the facts.’’ You're reading 1 of 5 free articles.

      "text": "President-Elect Trump woke up this morning with great news and had to share it on Facebook. Ford had been thinking about moving operations to Mexico because of U.S. regulations which in turn would have hurt workers here in America.\nTrump has said throughout the campaign, he promised to bring jobs back to America, and he would be willing to work with corporations to bring them back home, but if they chose to leave, then they would have to pay to come back.\n\nThis has to be tremendous news for Ford workers in Kentucky. Here are a few responses from some facebook users on the news:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmerica get ready for the good times! It’s not all going to happen at once. A little piece at a time but when it adds up, it’s going to be HUGE.\nHelp support conservative news and views by sharing this post on Facebook and Twitter. \nDon’t forget to follow the Wayne Dupree Show on Facebook , Google Plus , & Twitter .

The Washington Post 8 hrs ago Jim Tankersley © Luke Sharrett/Bloomberg Newly manufactured Ford and Lincoln sports utility vehicles (SUV) are seen before undergoing an assembly audit at the Ford Motor Co. assembly plant in Louisville, Kentucky, U.S., on Tuesday, April 28, 2015.\nPresident-elect Donald Trump claimed credit on Thursday for keeping a Ford plant in Kentucky from moving to Mexico. But the company never planned to move the entire plant, only one of its production lines.\nPopular Searches Apple Inc AAPL\n▼ 109.95 -0.04 -0.04% Amazon.com Inc AMZN\n▲ 756.40 +9.91 +1.33% SolarCity Corp SCTY\n▲ 20.40 +0.58 +2.90% Porsche Automobil Holding SE POAHY\n= 4.89 0.00 0.00%\nJust got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky - no Mexico\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 18, 2016\nI worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 18, 2016\nFord has never announced any plans to move either its Kentucky Truck Plant in Louisville, which produces the Lincoln Navigator, or the Louisville Assembly Plant, which produces the Lincoln MKC, to Mexico.\nIn a statement on Thursday night, following Trump's tweet, the company said it had told Trump it would cancel a plan to shift production of a single model — the MKC — from Kentucky to Mexico. The company last year indicated it would be moving MKC production out of Louisville, though it did not announce where it was going. At the time, union leaders said the shift would not cost any jobs in Kentucky.\n\"Today, we confirmed with the President-elect that our small Lincoln utility vehicle made at the Louisville Assembly Plant will stay in Kentucky,\" the company said in a statement. \"We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States.\"\nIn a follow-up email exchange, a Ford spokeswoman confirmed that the MKC production had been slated to move to Mexico.\nThis week, Ford chief executive Mark Fields reiterated that it was moving forward with plans to shift production of the Ford Focus to Mexico from Michigan.\nTrump has criticized those plans, which the company says will not cost any American jobs, because other models will be produced in the Michigan plant instead.\nIn an interview with Reuters , Fields highlighted the investments the company was making in domestic plants -- most notably, in Kentucky.\nFord announced a $1.3 billion investment in the Kentucky Truck Plant late last year. It said the move would create 2,000 new jobs.\nBill Ford Jr., the company's executive chairman, said in October that he had met with Trump over the then-candidate's frequent campaign attacks on Ford's decision to move small-car production to Mexico.\n\"I've had a very good meeting with him,\" Ford Jr. told the Economic Club of Washington. \"He's a very good listener and he knows the facts.\"\nThis isn't the first time Trump has misstated facts about a Ford move. In October 2015, he tweeted that the company had halted plans to build a factory in Mexico and would locate in Ohio instead, and he claimed credit for the decision. The company said he was wrong, and that it was continuing to build its plant in Mexico.\nTrump appeared to be relying on information gleaned from an article posted on a website of a shop that sells business cards and door hangers.\nGo to MSN Home",

      "text": "Image gallery: 2017 Ford EcoSport A detailed look at the refreshed compact SUV Overdrive Team OD Staff \nThe Ford EcoSport has just received a face lift, and the compact SUV was showcased ahead of the the 2016 Los Angles Auto Show in the US. Ford has tweaked the exterior as well as the interior, in order to keep it relevant in light of the competition. The interior, especially, had begun to show its age and you’l be surprised to see how the refresh has managed to transform the interior. There’s better equipment too. We expect Ford India to launch the new EcoSport in the country, sometime next year. While the 2017 version for the US loses the tailgate mounted spare wheel, expect the Indian Eco-Sport to continue with the feature. Scroll through the image gallery and discover what’s new on the 2017 Ford EcoSport. \nThe 2017 model gets a new hexagonal grille with twin slats. The projector headlamps and large fog lamps look contemporary, and the faux skid plate adds to the rugged looking front end The removal of the tailgate mounted spare wheel results in the number plate holder moving to the tail gate. Note the rear faux skid plate. It does look neater without the spare wheel at the back New alloy wheels look quite sporty The interior looks far more upmarket than the predecessor’s There’s new switch gear, new steering wheel and an 8-inch touchscreen infotainment system with SYNC3 \nTo stay at the cutting edge of automotive news in India, follow Overdrive on Twitter ( @odmag ) or on Facebook ( facebook.com/odmag ).

      "title": "Trump celebrates as Ford decides not to move production of SUV model to Mexico",
      "text": "  Fox News Latino Getty Images \nDETROIT (AP) –   President-elect Donald Trump claimed Thursday that he convinced the chairman of Ford Motor Co. not to move an assembly plant from Kentucky to Mexico. But Ford never intended to move the plant, just production of one of the vehicles it makes.\nTrump said in a tweet that Bill Ford, the company's executive chairman, telephoned him with the news that a \"Lincoln plant\" would stay in Louisville. Instead Ford decided to keep production of the Lincoln MKC small SUV at the Louisville Assembly Plant. Ford had previously said it would move production of the MKC out of the plant in order to build more Ford Escapes there.\nA factory in Cuautitlan, Mexico, was likely to get the MKC. Under a contract negotiated last year with the United Auto Workers, Ford agreed to invest $700 million in the Louisville plant in return for moving the MKC production. Because Escape production would increase, no Louisville jobs would be lost.\nIt's possible the decision to keep the MKC in Kentucky was made before the election, because Escape sales have been falling since July and additional production capacity in Louisville may not be needed. Ford spokeswoman Christin Baker said she didn't know when that decision was made or if Trump had any impact on it.\n\"I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!,\" Trump said in the tweet claiming credit for Ford's decision.\nFord Motor Co. and Trump have engaged in a yearlong feud over the automaker's plans to move production south of the border. The company plans to shift small-car production from suburban Detroit to Mexico to improve profitability of the lower-priced cars. CEO Mark Fields said Tuesday that the presidential election didn't change the company's plan.\nTrump wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and has called for a 35 percent tariff on goods shipped from Mexico in an effort to preserve U.S. manufacturing jobs.\nFord plans to move production of the Focus and C-Max small cars to Mexico from a plant in Wayne, Michigan. But jobs at the Wayne plant would be preserved because it's getting a new SUV and small pickup truck.\nBill Ford met with Trump during the summer and spoke with him on Thursday, Baker said.\n\"We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States,\" she said in an e-mail.\nLike us on Facebook \nFollow us on Twitter & Instagram",

      "text": "Donald Trump Takes Credit For Saving a Ford Plant That Wasn’t Actually Moving to Mexico by Ken Meyer | 10:39   \nPresident-elect Donald Trump has boasted about how his promise to bring jobs and manufacturing back to America is happening even before he takes office in another two months. There’s one snag though: the factory he’s referring to was never going anywhere, and neither were any jobs. \nOn Thursday night, Trump took to Twitter to talk about a conversation he had with the Ford Motor Company’s chairman about a manufacturing plant in Kentucky: Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky – no Mexico \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 18, 2016 I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 18, 2016 \nFord had plans to move its production of the Lincoln MKC model to Mexico, though the company says they weren’t going to shut down their plant in Louisville. Earlier this week, Ford told The Detroit Free Press that the company was going to re-shuffle some of its manufacturing operations, but it wouldn’t cost their workers any jobs once the factory focused exclusively on their Ford Escape production. \nAfter Ford’s discussion with Trump, the company released a statement that they would keep their manufacturing operations as they are right now: \n“Today, we confirmed with the President-elect that our small Lincoln utility vehicle made at the Louisville Assembly Plant will stay in Kentucky. We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States.” \nThroughout his campaign, Trump has railed against companies moving jobs abroad, and has threatened them with tariffs if they sell their products in the United States. \n[Image via screengrab]",

      "title": "Trump aside, Ford and other automakers have already moved to Mexico",
      "text": "In a move that was widely criticized Friday morning, President-elect Donald Trump on Thursday night took credit on social media for convincing Ford to keep a Kentucky plant put, instead of moving it to Mexico. Such an accomplishment would have burnished the anti-trade reputation of the future president.\nIt wasn’t the plant – which employs 4,700 people – that Ford was going to move, but the production of the Lincoln MKC, a sport utility vehicle.\nBut even if MKC production had moved south, zero American jobs would have suffered, according to the United Auto Workers union, which represents Ford workers, and last year negotiated with the Dearborn, Mich. automaker to invest $700 million in the Louisville plant over the next four years, reported the Detroit Free Press. Ford had planned to replace MKC production in Louisville with the Escape SUV.\nRecommended: Car logos quiz Still, the MKC is staying in Louisville; it’s unclear if that will impact production of the Escape there.\nTest your knowledge Car logos quiz Photos “Today, we confirmed with the President-elect that our small Lincoln utility vehicle made at the Louisville Assembly Plant will stay in Kentucky,” the company said in a statement, according to The Washington Post. “We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve US competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States.”\nDespite the change in the MKC's plans, Ford has said that it plans to move all North American production of its smaller cars from the US to Mexico. There, cheap labor and the country’s extensive trade relationships (which make exporting from Mexico cheaper than from other parts of the world) have made it a hub of global manufacturing in the 22 years since the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) negotiated trade among the US, Canada, and Mexico. Ford’s US plants will continue to make the company's larger, more expensive cars, which are more cost-effective to make here.\nAnd while Mr. Trump has singled Ford out as a trade boogeyman , criticizing the company for moving US jobs to Mexico – where his own clothing line is made – all other automakers are doing the same. Over the next decade, almost every major automaker will be producing some cars in Mexico, including General Motors, Ford, Toyota, Honda, Volkswagen, Audi, BMW, Hyundai and Mazda, according to an analysis by the Free Press .\nThe wave of investment by 2015 had turned Mexico into the seventh-largest producer of cars in the world and the fourth-largest auto exporter after Germany, Japan, and South Korea. Employment in Mexico’s auto sector has shot up 40 percent over the past decade , as international companies have poured $7 billion into the country. The United States saw a 15 percent increase in the same period.\nTrump has promised to reverse these trends by renegotiating NAFTA and other trade deals in order to bring back American jobs. Some economists, however, are skeptical that this will meaningfully stimulate the economy. They blame automation , not trade deals, for the manufacturing job losses.\nManufacturing output in the US is actually at an all-time high, as the Monitor has reported, worth $2.2 trillion in 2015, up from $1.7 trillion in 2009. The jobs are becoming increasingly skilled , though, and companies complain that they have trouble finding qualified or interested US workers for positions that don’t require a college degree, but at least some formal training.\n“The gap is between the jobs that take no skills and those that require a lot of skill,” Rob Spohr, a business professor at Montcalm Community College near Grand Rapids, told the Monitor’s Simon Montlake in June. “There’s enough people to fill the jobs at McDonalds and other places where you don’t need to have much skill. It’s that gap in between, and that’s where the problem is.”\nAccording to the National Skills Coalition, a Washington-based career-training advocacy group, the need for workers in middle-skilled jobs in the US will remain one of the economy’s most pronounced in the near term. Indeed, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics data show a surplus of bachelor’s degrees in the workforce, while moderately skilled positions languish.\nSome labor experts and economists call on the federal government to expand funding for technical skills training to close the jobs gap. It is unclear yet whether Trump supports that idea.",

      "text": "Print What is the greatest power of the presidency? Is it the power to enact laws? Is it the power to order military attacks? How about the power to pardon criminals and commute prison sentences? All of those are awesome weapons in the chief executive's arsenal. But the most powerful thing the President of the United States can do is send a clear message via the bully pulpit. \nWithout having to sign a bill or use an Executive Order, a president can make things happen simply by saying it's the right thing to do. And even though he's still only President-elect, Donald Trump is using this power and getting results. \nWe learned that last night when Ford finally came out and definitively promised it would not move its Lincoln MKC plant from Louisville, Kentucky to Mexico. Trump happily made the announcement on his Twitter account: Tweet \nSkeptics and Trump detractors jumped all over the tweets, insisting that Ford had never made any solid plans to move the plant in the first place. But as CNBC Auto and Airline Industry Reporter Phil Lebeau explained , Trump can indeed claim a victory here by \"getting Ford to reverse plans to move the MKC out of Louisville at some point in the future.\" \nAnd that's not all, Trump's \"Made in America\" message also seems to have spurred Apple to consider some form of iPhone production in the United States. One report says the company asked its Chinese-based suppliers to start coming up with ideas on how to move some production to America. It's probably no coincidence that June was when even the ever-faulty pre-election polls showed Trump at his strongest levels of the campaign. \nThere could be more announcements and stories like this in the coming months through the first 100 days and even first year of Trump's presidency. And even if none of them individually or even collectively actually make a difference in economic growth, it's important to remember that perception is almost always greater than reality in politics. \nThese kinds of small public relations victories will be helpful for Trump who is coming into office with such high unfavorable ratings and so many Americans actively refusing to accept his election victory. But all you have to do is ask the Clinton campaign and the Democratic Party about how perceptions can change and it's best to have real accomplishments on your side in the long run. \nPresident Obama was able to point to the very slow recovery in the most positive light for most of his two terms in office. It helped him win re-election in 2012 and it seems to be keeping his approval rating above 50 percent as he begins his final two months in office. But Hillary Clinton's happy talk about the economy during the election fell flat because there just wasn't enough economic growth to justify it. Call it bad luck or just bad timing, Clinton found out there is indeed an expiration date on positive political perceptions. \nTrump isn't likely to get the kind of grace period President Obama enjoyed. The best he can probably hope for is the timetable president Reagan faced when he took office in 1981. The nation actually went into recession in 1982 and had not shown much real recovery through most of 1983. \nBy September of '83, Reagan's poll numbers were weak as the period of optimism he initiated was waning. Had the first few months of 1984 not produced the kind of stronger economic numbers that they did, it's arguable even the enormously popular Reagan would have been defeated in November instead of winning a 49-state landslide. \nTrump is going to need solid numbers, starting with some form of sustained GDP growth at or very close to the three percent level to win over more suspicious voters and keep most of his existing base. \nReal wage growth will need to be higher by 2019 or so. And if higher interest rates are coming, they'll have to find a sweet spot that keeps retirees and cash investors happy without destroying the housing market with soaring mortgage rates. Trump and his team believe reducing corporate taxes, repatriating cash held overseas, and creating large amounts of infrastructure and defense manufacturing jobs will do the trick. \nBut with a Republican Congress in tow, Trump will have few excuses in the years to come if his favored economic bills are passed and they don't produce the promised results. For now, and maybe for another year or so, little symbolic victories like the Ford announcement and the Apple story will be fine enough. But at some point, Trump will have to deliver the goods. \nCommentary by Jake Novak, CNBC.com senior columnist.

      "text": "For real-life roads, Ford's Focus is still sharp   Warren Brown The Washington Post \nAs a young journalist, I thrilled at invitations from automobile manufacturers to drive exotic cars in exotic locations. But there always was a troubling disconnect.\nWe journalists would arrive a day or night before the drive, which often would be arranged to run against the rush hour of the host location. The idea was to provide us the luxury of enjoying the luxury cars without traffic jams.\nWe could concentrate on the design and engineering of the subject automobiles without paying much attention to reality, which is that few of the world's roads are traveled by exotic cars because few of the world's motorists can afford them.\nThat reality is seen daily on highways such as Interstate 66, where models such as the subject of this week's review, the 2017 Ford Focus S sedan, abound.\nIt is a well-constructed compact car - safe and fuel-efficient, affording 30 miles per gallon in the city and 42 miles per gallon on the highway using regular-grade gasoline. It has been around since 1998 and is a common sight on streets as diverse as those of the District of Columbia and Moscow.\nTechnology has kept the little Focus updated. But it has been aggressively matched in that endeavor by the South Koreans, who have loaded with value and likability models such as the Hyundai Elantra and Kia Forte. The Japanese, of course, understand the global market and have countered with affordable rides such as the Mazda 2 and Toyota Yaris.\nBut the little Focus keeps rolling on primarily because it is designed to safely and efficiently get you where you are going at a base price - $18,175 - that makes the car reasonably accessible.\nAccessibility and reliability trump the romance of \"fun to drive\" here, although the Focus is a nice, tight compact car that can be had with performance credibility if purchased as a Focus ST or RS. But most people who buy it are looking for the basics of reliability and economy and thus will get it in one of the more popular trim levels of S, SE, SEL or Titanium. The Focus also is available as an electric and hatchback SE EcoBoost.\nThe Focus S is basic personal transportation. You don't buy it to impress. Nor do you get it to zoom past the competition. You get it to get there. Period. And the little car does a very decent job of doing that.\nIt is equipped with a 2-liter, four-cylinder gasoline engine delivering 160 horsepower and 146 pound-feet of torque. A five-speed manual transmission is standard. A six-speed automatic is optional. Spend the extra money on the automatic. It will be worth it in one of the Washington area's traffic jams.\nI found the Focus S to be a good little get-about, although somewhat disconcerting after spending weeks in models that have jettisoned pieces such as ignition keys and locks in favor of push-button ignition. The Focus can be had with lots of modern safety technology. But it does appear to be getting a bit long in the tooth.\nStill, it makes sense as a basic transportation car, particularly in S trim. It remains a \"buy\" here.\nNuts & Bolts\n2017 FORD FOCUS S\nBottom line: The 2017 Focus S, practically unchanged from the 2016 model year, is safe, reliable and, depending on traffic patterns, enjoyable basic transportation.\nRide, acceleration and handling: It gets decent marks in all three areas.\nHead-turning quotient: It has the styling signature of the larger Ford Fusion, which clearly has \"borrowed\" styling cues from the Aston Martin, which once was a Ford property.\nBody style/layout: The Ford Focus is a compact, front-engine, front-wheel-drive economy car available as a sedan or hatchback. An electric version is also for sale.\nEngine/transmission for Focus S: It comes with a 2.0-liter, 16-valve, four-cylinder gasoline engine with variable valve timing (160 horsepower, 146 pound-feet of torque). A five-speed manual transmission is standard. A six-speed automatic is optional.\nCapacities: Seating is for five people. Cargo capacity is 13.2 cubic feet. The fuel tank holds 12.4 gallons of gasoline. Regular grade is fine.\nMileage: I averaged 36 miles per gallon mostly in highway driving.\nSafety: Standard equipment includes ventilated front disc brakes, rear drum brakes; four-wheel anti-lock brake protection; traction and stability control; post-collision safety system; side and head air bags.\nPricing: The 2017 Ford Focus S starts at $18,175 with a dealer's invoice price of $17,357. Price as tested is $21,190, including $2,140 in options (automatic transmission, cosmetics and other items) and an $875 factory-to-dealer shipment charge. Dealer's price as tested is $20,266.",

      "text": "Search for: ‘This is classic Trump’– Stuart Varney on Ford’s decision to keep SUV production in the US 0 \nIn what’s being seen as an olive branch, Ford Motor Co. Chairman Bill Ford called President-elect Donald Trump this week to say the auto maker nixed plans to move production of a Lincoln sport-utility vehicle from Kentucky to Mexico. \nAnd while there’s some question over the impact the move will have on jobs in the U.S., Fox News’ Stuart Varney said the outcome was “classic Trump.” \nEither way, Trump took to Twitter Thursday night to declare victory. I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 18, 2016 \nVarney joined the “Fox & Friends” crew Saturday morning to explain what took place. \n“Here’s what happened. Before the election, Donald Trump said ‘Hey, you build cars in Mexico and try to bring them back here, we’re going to punish you,'” he said. “He wins the election, Ford and the other car-makers get kind of worried.” ‘Hamilton’ actor embarrasses Mike Pence on stage, crowd boos new VP; Americans respond by cancelling tickets \nThe next thing you know, Varney pointed out, Ford is calling Trump to extend an olive branch. \n“Look, this is classic Trump. The man negotiates,” he said. “He sets up a hard line position… he’s waiting for the other side to make an offer.” \nAnd the left “is classically worried that it might work,” Varney added.",

The company last year indicated it would be moving MKC production out of Louisville, though it did not announce where it was going. At the time, union leaders said the shift would not cost any jobs in Kentucky.\n\"Today, we confirmed with the president-elect that our small Lincoln utility vehicle made at the Louisville Assembly Plant will stay in Kentucky,\" the company said in a statement. \"We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States.\"\nFord CEO says production plans on track despite election Tribune news services Ford Motor Co.

Trump wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement ...\n(Tribune news services) In a follow-up email exchange, a Ford spokeswoman confirmed that the MKC production had been slated to move to Mexico.\nThis week, Ford chief executive Mark Fields reiterated that it was moving forward with plans to shift production of the Ford Focus to Mexico from Michigan.\nTrump has criticized those plans, which the company says will not cost any American jobs, because other models will be produced in the Michigan plant instead.\nIn an interview with Reuters, Fields highlighted the investments the company was making in domestic plants — most notably, in Kentucky.\nFord announced a $1.3 billion investment in the Kentucky Truck Plant late last year. It said the move would create 2,000 new jobs.\nBill Ford Jr., the company's executive chairman, said in October that he had met with Trump over the then-candidate's frequent campaign attacks on Ford's decision to move small-car production to Mexico.\n\"I've had a very good meeting with him,\" Ford Jr. told the Economic Club of Washington. \"He's a very good listener and he knows the facts.\"\n Mexico Donald Trump The Lincoln Motor Company",

      "title": "Ford works towards driverless car with new autonomous tech - One News Page",
      "text": "Ford will launch its first driverless vehicle in 2021\n\nFord UK marketing director said more driver assist systems will arrive before 2021 driverless model\n\nFord will gradually introduce more driver assist technology to its models in the coming years before producing its first fully autonomous car in 2021.\n\nSpeaking to Autocar at Ford's Driving Skills For Life event at London’s Excel, Lisa Brankin, Ford of Britain marketing director, said she believed this incremental approach to driverless technology would ensure Ford’s cars stay relevant to market demand.\n\n“I don’t believe fully autonomous cars [that can drive from door-to-door without any input] will be on our roads in any big number for at least another decade,” she said. “When [fully autonomous technology] comes, it won’t come all at once; driverless cars won’t be everywhere straight away.”\n\nBrankin said Ford is, therefore, adding driverless systems to its cars, such as Active Park Assist and Lane Keep, using a step-by-step approach, before introducing them all into a new autonomous model in 2021.\n\n“At the moment driver assist systems and safety improving headlight technology are making their way onto more models,” she explained. “Each system will become available further down the range while the top cars will get more driver aids added, that’ll then trickle down.”\n\nBrankin said this trend would continue, gradually giving Ford models more driverless features. “With each iteration the technology gets better and better,” she added, suggesting a semi-autonomous model could arrive before the 2021 car.\n\nEarlier this month Ford announced new auto braking technology that works with its reversing camera. Due to make it to market within two years , the technology can apply the brakes to avoid an impact when a driver is reversing.\n\nThe car maker also confirmed it’s working on evasive steering technology that can swerve the car around hazards. These systems, said Brankin, are an example of the steady but significant progress the brand is making towards full autonomy.\n\nThe brand's first fully autonomous model, which is planned for launch in 2021, will use 3D mapping, LIDAR and radar and camera sensors. It'll be launched for the mass-market without a steering wheel or pedals.",

      "text": "A few selections from the Ford family photo album A few selections from the Ford family photo album By Toronto Life | 11/22/2016 \nDoug Ford’s new book, Ford Nation , purports to tell “the real story” behind Rob Ford’s mayoralty. Whether or not it achieves that goal, the tome does include one thing that will be of interest even to people who feel like they’ve already heard more than enough about the ex-mayor: 18 photos of life with the Ford clan, dating back to the early 1970s, when Rob was an infant. Q&A: Doug Ford, whose new book aims to set the record straight on his brother’s disastrous mayoralty \nThroughout the Ford mayoralty, journalists went to extreme lengths in their attempts to reconstruct the troubled family dynamics that gave rise to Rob Ford’s very complicated personality. Reporters at the Globe and the Star were eventually able to trace Rob’s problems with drugs and self-esteem back to his experience growing up with a successful, domineering father and three extremely troublesome older siblings. \nNow, thanks to these photos, it’s possible for the public to see what the Ford family looked like during those formative years. Looking at pictures of Rob Ford as a child won’t change anyone’s mind about his legacy, but it does manage to provide some context where there was little before. Here are a few of the shots. \nRob Ford as an infant, next to a gun rack. His father Doug Ford Sr., was a fan of hunting: \nHere’s the entire Ford clan, in 1972. Randy, on the far left, and Kathy, on the far right, are the two Ford siblings who never made their way into politics. Rob is the one with Doug Sr.’s hand on his shoulder. The woman in the middle of the frame is Diane Ford, Rob’s mother: \nRob (below) and Doug (above) at the family home, on Weston Wood Road: \nAt one point shortly after the end of his term as mayor, Rob Ford claimed to have grown up with a muslim sibling , whom his father had adopted in 1982. In Ford Nation , Doug clears up the story. Mohsine Hanfi (right) came from Morocco to stay with the family for a few days and ended up living with them for eight years: \nRob, at age 17. This is what a Ford family Christmas looked like: \nAnd here, from Rob’s wedding in 2000, is the most complete Ford family portrait ever published (to the best of our knowledge). From left to right, we have Doug, Doug’s wife Karla, Lisa Dolson (Randy’s ex-girlfriend and the mother of his two children), Kathy, Randy, Doug Sr., Rob and his wife Renata. Michael Ford (who is now a city councillor) is in the middle, in the blue vest. The girl in the blue dress in the far right is Kathy Ford’s seldom-mentioned daughter, Jennifer. The four girls in the bottom row are Doug’s daughters:",

      "text": "How Taylor Morgan beat Ford and got a full refund on dodgy Focus John Rolfe, Public Defender columnist, The Daily Telegraph November 24, 2016 7:40am While up to 70,000 owners of dodgy Fords fume over a decision by their class action law firm to give up on pursuing refunds, one determined driver has motored to a big win. \nTaylor Morgan took on the car giant by herself and won. “I got a full refund,” Ms Morgan said. \nHer car woes were the result of her 2011 Focus repeatedly stopping suddenly in traffic. \nMs Morgan, 25, had joined the Bannister Law class action against Ford on behalf of owners of 22 different models of Fiesta, Focus and EcoSport vehicles made between 2011 and this year. But then she decided to go it alone. media_camera Taylor Morgan with her faulty Ford Focus. Picture: Jay Town \n“I didn’t want to have to wait until 2017 for a result,” the Sydneysider said. “The car might have killed me before then.” \nMs Morgan believes the turning point in her dispute came when the dealership told her in writing she had to deal with the manufacturer. It’s a common ploy used by retailers — and it’s untrue. \nAs the ACCC website says, a “consumer can ask the seller to provide a remedy, and the seller is required by law to oblige.” \nShe knew her rights and told the dealership what it had said was wrong. A full $22,000 refund offer came shortly ­afterwards. \nHer decision to go it alone has paid dividends as Bannister has now stopped battling for full refunds. \nThe lead applicant in the class action, Billie Capic, said she was disappointed the firm was now instead seeking damages for the decrease in value as a result of the models’ faulty transmission. “A refund or replacement is what we had been looking at,” Ms Capic said. “I ­really don’t know what we are going to get now, I’d be happy with anything.” media_camera Ms Capic is the lead applicant says she is looking for a refund or a replacement. Picture: Paul Loughnan \nBannister Law said it had come to realise not all class members had a transmission problem from the day they drove the car off the lot. \n“For those owners who experienced problems after many months, asking for a full refund after having possessed their vehicles for too long a period of time will make their claim less reasonable, less meritorious and less likely to succeed,” Bannister’s Milan Cakic said. \nIn July I wrote about Focus owners Paul and Vicki Letcher and their plan to take Ford to court. They did so and appear to have had as much if not more success than the class action. “We’ve settled, but I can’t provide details of the agreement,” Mr Letcher said yesterday. “We no longer have the car.” \nLike this reporter’s work on Facebook here \nIN RELATED NEWS: ‘CAN MY BARGAIN RING BE MADE QUICKER?’ The price is wrong 1:27 \nYou've found a bargain online but the site says it was a mistake.

      "title": "The 2017 Ford F150 is Laughably Good",
      "text": "First off, let it be said that the full size truck segment is well and alive. Some manufacturers have shifted their focus towards smaller, light duty pickups for the common buyer, leading some to forget about the half-ton class. Ford wants to let you know that it's still their number one priority, as shown here in the 2017 F-150. With capability and comfort abundant, the repeatedly praised pickup continues to build its empire with more livability then you'd think to find anywhere near a worksite. Oh, and the power. Don't forget about the power. Not to worry -- Ford won't let you. The F-150 has undergone the first major changes since the introduction of their alumnimum body in 2015. Their premium engine selection, the 3.5L Ecoboost, has been boosted up 10 horsepower and a momentous 50 lb. ft. to bring the numbers to 375 and 470, respectively. This model year also introduces the company's new 10-speed automatic transmission that was co-developed with their unlikely partner, General Motors. And if you have any reason to doubt the twin-turbo V6, the ever-present 5.0L V8 will give you proven reliability with plenty of oomph. As more 2017 F-150's are built, we will see the new powertrain options pop up more frequently. And don't forget about the oncoming Raptor that should turn these figures up to 11.\nView photos\nThe Drive More Along with the truck's performance, luxury has become standard for the F-150. It trickles down throughout the range, with the Platinum and King Ranch being the stars of the show. Comfort is remarkably exceptional in the lower XL, XLT, and Lariat trim levels as well. Its cockpit provides plenty of space for both the driver and passengers, leaving enough room in the back for the legs and head of construction workers and family members alike. The higher you go on the trim ladder, the more goodies you will get -- those features including power-folding steps as well as massaging seats, like you see in Mercs and Bentleys of today. All of these creature comforts in a crazy, go-like-stink pickup. Go figure!\nTech is largely the same for 2017, and that's a good thing. The rejuvenated SYNC 3 infotainment system is back, providing easy to use controls for navigation, audio, and even climate control in some models. This is a beautifully simple setup that outperforms RAM and Chevrolet in terms of design and accessibility. Adaptive Cruise Control bolsters that next-level concept of convenience along with Blindspot Information and Lane Keep Assist, helping the F-150 achieve a five-star NHTSA safety rating. The new Sync Connect functionality works in tandem with the Ford Pass app so that you can lock the vehicle's doors and even set up scheduled remote starts, just to add a little bit of flair. You won't find a truck that outplays the Ford in technology.\nThis all inclusive package aids the Ford in improving year after year. A new powertrain option here, a convenience feature there, it all adds up to make the F-150 an unstoppable motif in the best-seller winner's circle. 2017's rendition plays on prior years to make up what is one of the most capable vehicles available. After unmeasurable amounts of attention, the details of this truck are what make it so special. We can't wait to see how Ford follows this class-act.",

      "text": "Having established its self-driving car projects in the US, Ford has confirmed that it will set up a similar research programme in Europe next year\n\nFord will begin testing autonomous cars on European roads in 2017 as the next step in its pledge to make self-driving vehicles available to millions of people.\n\nWith its self-driving car development programme already up and running in the US, Ford is turning its attention to tackling the complex challenge of making an autonomous system work across European boundaries.\n\n*Ford works towards driverless cars with new autonomous tech*\n\nFord’s ambition is to be a global leader in connectivity, mobility and autonomous vehicles. Earlier this year announced its intention to have a “high-volume, fully autonomous vehicle in commercial operation in 2021 in a ride-hailing or ride-sharing service”.\n\nFord expects that the car used for that service in five years' time will be capable of level four autonomy on the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) scale, which is classified as ‘high automation’ and is one step away from full autonomy.\n\nThomas Lukaszewicz, Ford of Europe’s autonomous driving manager, said: “We have already announced plans to use an autonomous vehicle for a ride-sharing service in the US in 2021 and it is important that we extend our testing to Europe.\n\n“Rules of the road vary from country to country here, traffic signs and road layouts are different and drivers are likely to share congested roads with cyclists.”\n\n*Ford semi-autonomous emergency steering system under development*\n\nDuring 2016 Ford has tripled the size of its autonomous test fleet of Fusion Hybrids on the roads of California , Arizona and Michigan and plans to triple it again in 2017. The manufacturer claims it has the most advanced self-driving test fleet of any car maker.\n\nFord has already claimed a number of firsts in self-driving car research, including being the first manufacturer to test autonomous vehicles in the snow and at night. In the US it has conducted extensive testing at Mcity, a 32-acre, full-scale simulated real-world urban environment at the University of Michigan.\n\n*Ford to release mass-market autonomous car in 2021*",

Ford, in fact, has revealed four production variants in the form of Fiesta Titanium, Fiesta ST-Line, the upscale Fiesta Vignale and a crossover called Fiesta Active.\nFeaturing revised exteriors, a more ergonomically laid out interior including a floating touchscreen display and Ford’s SYNC 3 infotainment system, the new Fiesta is here to take on existing mid-size hatchbacks in the US and Europe.\nUnderneath the revised exterior is Ford’s Global B platform from the old car. Ford has soldiered on with the platform to keep R&D costs in check. As for the powertrain, the big change comes with the 1-litre EcoBoost engine. Ford has introduced cylinder deactivation technology to improve fuel efficiency and CO2 emissions. The new tech can disengage or re-engage the cylinder in 14 milliseconds.\nThe new Fiesta is set to go on sale in European markets during the first half of next year.",

      "text": "Black and Blue special edition Ford Mustangs revealed Text: Marcus De Guzman / Photos: Ford |   07:39 Euro-exclusive Black Shadow and Blue edition Ford Mustangs launched \nFord has just revealed two special edition trim models for their pony car over in Europe. Called the Black Shadow and Blue editions, each car receives unique add-ons that give both Mustangs a sportier look. \n“The Ford Mustang has no trouble standing out on European roads, and with the new Ford Mustang Black Shadow Edition and Blue Edition models, Mustang drivers will be turning even more heads. Special edition Ford Mustangs have been an important part of the Mustang story for more than 50 years, and now customers in Europe can play their own part in the iconic car’s rich special edition history,” said Roelant de Ward, vice president, marketing, sales & service at Ford of Europe. \nStarting off with the Mustang Blue edition, this brightly-colored pony pays tribute to the Grabber colors which were available for the 1969 Shelby GT350 and GT500 specials. Aside from the distinct Grabber Blue seen here, other colors like Grabber Orange, Grabber Yellow and Grabber Lime are also available. \nEngines available for the Blue Edition Mustang include the 317 PS 2.3-liter EcoBoost and the more powerful 421 PS 5.0-liter V8. Six-speed automatic or manual transmissions can also be specified, as well as the following: SYNC 3, hood and roof stripes, 19-inch black alloy wheels and black leather seats with heating and cooling functions. \nNext up is the Mustang Black Shadow Edition that is only available with the top-of-the-range 5.0-liter V8. As the name implies, the dark-themed pony car gets a plethora of black trim accents which include the: pony emblem on the GT grill, exclusive 19-inch Y-spoke alloy wheels, black stripes on the hood and sides and black 5.0-liter badging. In terms of color, the Black Shadow can be painted in Platinum White, Triple Yellow, Race Red and Grabber Blue. \nOther standard features present in the blacked-out special are: heated and cooled front seats, premium ShakerPro audio with 12-speakers and an 8-inch subwoofer, and premium black leather upholstery. \nThere is no word if Ford plans to offer the Black Shadow and Blue Edition specials outside of Europe.

      "text": "Dan Brooks has championship priorities, Boyd and Ford working scout team by Nikki Hood - Staff Writer - Wednesday, November 30, 2016 9:41 PM Swinney said he hopes Clemson fans make the trip to Orlando \nCLEMSON – Dan Brooks has his priorities in order. \nClemson’s defensive tackles coach was honored Wednesday as the American Football Coaches Association Assistant of the Year, but Brooks isn’t planning on attending the banquet to receive his award. \nHead coach Dabo Swinney talked about Brooks – and his plans – following Wednesday’s practice. \n“There isn't anybody better than Dan Brooks. The first thing he said was, 'I don't plan on being at the banquet.' That's typical Dan Brooks fashion,” Swinney said. “I said, 'Well, when's the banquet?' He said, 'It's Monday night of the national championship,' and I told him that I hope he's not there either. I'm really happy for Dan. I'm serious, he's just unbelievable as a person, coach, father, husband, you name it. I've been in this business a long time and I've never met anyone finer. I'm just happy for him. He's very, very well-deserving.” \nThe next step in the march to the College Football Playoff is Saturday when the Tigers take on Virginia Tech in the ACC Championship in Orlando’s Camping World Stadium, and Swinney said the game is important for recruiting purposes. \n“We've been recruiting Florida a long time and we've recruited well. We have a strong brand in the state,” Swinney said. “Guys have come here and had great success and graduated. That's the main thing. They've had a good experience, so that's resonated. We lost one of those games, we've gotten beat at Florida State and that didn't change anything. We've got kids down there right now that are going to come to Clemson. It definitely doesn't hurt. It's always a plus, but I think our brand in the state of Florida is very, very strong and has been for a long time.” \nThe Clemson defense will have its hands full with Tech quarterback Jerod Evans, who leads the Hokies in rushing. \n“He reminds me of Tajh (Boyd) as far as his ability and his size and his thickness. They run in between the tackles,” Swinney said. “He runs the zone read stuff but they're going to run the quarterback power, quarterback counter, jet motion power. He's reading that stuff and he's giving it or he's pulling it. He can split your defense. They do an excellent job of that and it's just what they do. Then the play actions that come off of it and if you get too aggressive all of a sudden that guy that's been coming out blocking, he's gone and they're throwing over the top. They know what they're doing and they've got a good plan. He's similar to Tajh as far as his ability to run. He's big, thick, strong. He's not a burner. He's not Lamar (Jackson), who's chasing Usain Bolt out here. He's fast. This kid runs well. He's athletic and he's smart. He's a smart runner. He's very, very effective.” \nPreparing the defense – as scout team quarterback Jimmy Greenbeans – is defensive coordinator Brent Venables . \n“Just Jimmy Greenbeans this week,” Swinney said. “That's it. It's so funny, we're coming in on game day on Saturday we're coming in up by the Hendrix Center and we come down and take a right on Perimeter and I swear on the corner there was a fan and he's standing up wearing an authentic Clemson jersey. On the back, it says Jimmy Greenbeans. I just fell out laughing. Brent was sitting right next to me and I was like, 'Hey man, there you go. You've got a big game today.' It was so funny. He's getting better.” \nSwinney has also been using former players – like Alabama’s Nick Saban – to help simulate opponents in practice. \n“We've already done it. We borrowed Tajh and Jacoby (Ford) for the Florida State game,” he said. “Y'all just never asked. It's new. I didn't know you could do that, so we brought Tajh and Jacoby in for that Florida State game, but that's the only time we've done it. I've been trying to talk DeAndre McDaniel into getting out there and Danny Pearman into getting out there for some scout tight end work. I haven’t had any takers yet. You can do it anytime but it has to be occasional. It can't be every day.” \nHe then said he hopes Clemson’s fans make the trip and support the football team in Orlando. \n“I was just saying that I hope we have a great crowd. I hope we don't get complacent and say, 'Oh well, we'll go win that game and let's think about the next one.' This is the biggest game of the year and I hope people will appreciate what this team has done because it is so hard,” he said. “It's one thing to have an expectation. It's another thing to have an appreciation. I think our fans that's one of the things that sets Clemson apart is there's always been that appreciation - a genuine appreciation for each other, for the role that everybody plays. I know it's a game that's been moved and all of that and there's probably some frustration with that stuff, but at the end of the day, we're playing for a championship. I don't want anyone to ever get complacent with that like there's bigger fish to fry. \n“No there's not. We don't worry about anything. The biggest game is this game and winning this conference. In the end, whatever comes after that, we'll deal with, but we're putting our best foot forward. That was really all I was saying. Hopefully, we have a great turnout and everybody is excited to be there because I know I am. I guarantee that Virginia Tech is going to be excited to be there. I want our fans to be the same way. I'm sure we'll have a great crowd. We always do. Obviously, it's not in Charlotte and that was the main message there.” \nInjury notes \n“Richard (Yeargin) will be out. He and Scott (Pagano) will be out this week, so nothing has changed there. John (Simpson) will be with us. He's done well. He's done really well.” \nOn covering tight end Bucky Hodges \n“We'll get one of those basketball guys, I guess, and bring them out here. He's a big, long guy. You just do the best you can. At the end of the day, the ball goes up and you still have to play with good technique and attack the ball at the high point. Those are 50-50 type plays when you have those one-on-one matchups and the ball is put up in the air. You just have to win your share of them more than you don't win your share, from our defensive standpoint. Offensively, we have to win more than our share on that side. It's the same thing. You've just got to win with great technique and hopefully you can win at the line of scrimmage and not allow them to get in a rhythm or get comfortable - get clean, free releases and things like that to where he can get down the field. That's the first thing you try to do. He's really good. He's made one-handed catches. \n\"He's had a little bit of everything all year long. They're a lot like us in that they're going to take those one-on-one matchups and there will be opportunities that will be presented. Just the same, we'll have opportunities that will be presented. That's what football comes down to, ultimately, is who wins those matchups, who wins those competitive plays when they present themselves. We just practice harder, work on our technique, work on high-pointing the balls and things like that because that's the main thing. It's normal route running then it's being where you're supposed to be and timing things up front and disrupting rhythm. It's those 50-50 balls outside that go up.” Rate this Story: Send Feedback to Nikki Hood: | Comment",

If that happens the belts may not hold people. Ford says it knows of two injuries related to the problem.\nPre-tensioners tighten seat belts when they sense that cars are stopping.\nDealers will inject insulation into the pre-tensioners to protect the cables from heat at no cost to owners. The recall is expected to begin on Jan. 16.\nMost of the cars are in the U.S., Canada and Mexico.",

      "text": "  Because It's the best - and only - way to celebrate a birthday. Of anything. \nIs there a better way of celebrating a car factory’s birthday than having a rally car rip around it, Gymkhana-style? \nOf course there isn’t. So Ford of Romania did exactly that to mark the 40th anniversary of its production facility in Craiova. And it’s pretty epic. Not far off Ken Block levels of epicness, in fact. \nLocal hero Simone Tempestini is the man at the wheel of the Fiesta R5 rally machine. The 22-year-old won his second consecutive Romanian Rally Championship title this year in the R5, and found the time to claim both the Junior and WRC3 crowns in the World Rally Championship with a R2-spec Fiesta. \nThe Craiova plant was originally built in 1976 as the base for local automaker Oltcit, a joint venture with Citroen. It was bought by Daewoo in the mid-1990s and produced several of the South Korean company’s models for the local market. It stumbled on for a few years after General Motors acquired Daewoo, continuing to build badly outdated models like the Matiz and Nubira, having been denied access to more up-to-date products. And export markets. \nFord stepped in to rescue the plant in 2008, which started turning out the Transit Connect van . Since 2012, it has been the sole source of the slow-selling, Fiesta-based B-MAX minivan , and the second-generation EcoSport crossover will be built there for the European market from next year. \nAs would expect of any good Gymkhana film, there are many, many donuts, a few brushes with objects much more solid than a Fiesta rally car, a couple of ginormous jumps, and lots and lots of smoke. Not just tire smoke, either. There’s a few canisters on the rear wing putting out smoke in the colors of the Romanian flag. \nMy favorite bit, though, is a magnificently sketchy leap onto a raised lawn from an oddly angled concrete ramp.

      "text": "Source: Ford\nIt’s one of the great hypocrisy of fandom: When you guys win, it’s “We,” when they lose, its “Them.”\nHonestly, it isn’t that much different in the automotive world. Everyone has their pet brands, and everyone knows that their brands have all made awful, awful mistakes. In almost every business, products come out that look like a mistake as soon as they leave the factory, but due to the auto industry’s inherent exposure to the public, automotive flops tend to be more spectacular than most — and potentially more damaging to the brand responsible.\nHere we’ve compiled a collection of 10 of the most high-profile offenders. Although these cars may have seemed right at the time to somebody, they probably should have been put through a little more development — and at least a focus group or two.\n1. 1975-’80 AMC Pacer Source: YouTube\nIn the 1970s, tiny Wisconsin-based American Motors was strapped for cash, and increasingly relying on its aging Gremlin/Hornet platform (which would eventually underpin its Concord, Spirit, and Eagle models). That’s what makes the Pacer so baffling. On paper, it was a pioneer: The second American car to have rack-and-pinion steering, an integrated rollbar, a longer passenger door for rear seat access, and an interior designed for safety and class-leading space. But in reality, it was “ The Flying Fishbowl ,” a gawky, unbelievably hot (all that glass), and expensive failure. The struggling company sank $60 million (nearly $360 million today) into developing the car “from the inside out.” Customers took one look at the slow (100 horsepower), heavy (nearly two tons) Pacer, and said “no, thanks.” In 2007, Hagerty Insurance issued a poll asking for the enthusiasts to name the worst car design of all time, and the Pacer was bestowed with the unfortunate honor.\n2. 1981-’84 Cadillac Fleetwood V8-6-4 Source: De La Fuente Cadillac via YouTube\nToday, GM’s performance cars like the Corvette and Camaro use cylinder deactivation systems in their V8s to hit fuel economy numbers that would’ve been thought impossible a generation ago – and that’s largely because of the failure of Cadillac’s V8-6-4 engine. In order to keep up with rising CAFE standards, Caddy offered a novel and complex electromechanical cylinder deactivation system on its flagship Fleetwood models beginning in 1981. Unfortunately, technology hadn’t caught up with the idea just yet, and it was besieged with warranty issues well after the V8-6-4 left production in 1984. Turns out buyers didn’t want a jerky ride, stalling, or bizarre engine noises from their $16,000 (around $45k today) Fleetwoods after all.\n\n3. 1971-’80 Ford Pinto Source: Ford\nThe Pinto was supposed to be Ford’s car of the ’70s; a modern compact perfectly in tune with what buyers wanted. Instead, it nearly destroyed the company. At risk of adding $11 to the manufacturing costs of every car, Ford decided to place the Pinto’s gas tank in a place where it could be punctured by the rear differential and snap at the filler neck in rear-end collisions over 25 miles per hour, spraying gasoline into the interior (a shield to prevent this would’ve added $1 to manufacturing costs), and igniting the car. The reasoning? Ford’s bean counters decided it would be cheaper to pay off any wrongful death claims than fix the problem.\nIn 1978, Ford finally recalled over 1.5 million Pintos, and began years of slogging through civil suits that would push the company to the brink of bankruptcy. While the Pinto astonishingly soldiered on through the 1980 model year, it’s estimated that as many as 900 people died from the defect.\n\n4. 1995-’97 Suzuki X90 Source: Men and Motors via YouTube\nThe X90 wasn’t really an off-roader like the earlier Samurai, or a targa-topped sporty car like the Honda Civic del Sol, but sort of a odd and impractical combination of both. It had all the drawbacks of a small SUV (increased rollover risk, road noise), coupled with the worst parts of a sports car, like the conspicuous lack of seating for more than two people. Needless to say, it sold terribly , but found limited success as the choice car for Red Bull — that is, until Red Bull moved on and adopted the Mini.\n\n5. 1989-’91 Chrysler TC by Maserati Source: WorldAutoMotors via YouTube\nIn the late ’80s, Chrysler president Lee Iacocca partnered with Maserati in the late ’80s to develop a competitor to Cadillac Allanté (a close runner-up for this list). Astonishingly, the two managed to make a car that was even more underwhelming than the Cadillac. The TC was lightly restyled, K-Car-based, front-wheel drive LeBaron convertible mounted on a shortened (also K-Car-based) Daytona chassis, manufactured in Italy, and branded with Maserati’s iconic trident set inside Chrysler’s Pentastar logo. And instead of a free-revving Maserati engine under the hood, there was an Italian-built version of the turbocharged 2.2. liter V6 that was available in the Dodge Caravan.\nUnsurprisingly, the Chrysler TC by Maserati was a bit of an embarrassment for both companies, and it disappeared after just two years and 7,000 examples. Ironically, Chrysler and Maserati are both owned by Fiat today.\n\n6. 1982-’88 Cadillac Cimarron Source: Cadillac\nIn the ’80s, the BMW 3-Series was making huge inroads in the U.S. thanks to its combination of luxury, performance, and style. But to GM, it was just an expensive compact, so it responded with what it thought was a BMW-killer: The Cimarron. Little more than a front-wheel drive Chevy Cavalier with leather and a $15,000 price tag (the Chevy sold for $6,400), the public blanched at the Cimarron, and by 1988, it had disappeared in a cloud of ignominy. In the words of Pulitzer-prize winning automotive journalist Dan Nei l , “Everything that was wrong, venal, lazy, and mendacious about GM in the 1980s was crystallized in this flagrant insult to the good name and fine customers of Cadillac.”\n\n7. 1997-’02 Plymouth Prowler Source: Fiat Chrysler Automobiles\nAround the mid-nineties, Plymouth set out to create a factory-rendition of the iconic hotrod. It’s open wheel design, wedge-shaped fuselage, and sloping arches hit all the right hotrod notes… until you opened the hood to see Chrysler’s 3.5-liter V6 and all of its 250 horsepower: The car was more of a rod, but not really a hot one. While 250 horsepower could be written off as respectable when it was released, the lack of a manual transmission humbled the car’s performance significantly, and the $38,300 ($56k today) base price didn’t help matters either. In recent years, Plymouth’s last grasp at relevancy has begun to be reconsidered in enthusiast circles . Astonishing.\n\n8. 1958-’60 Ford Edsel Source: Teddy Pieper/RM Sotheby’s\nThe Ford Edsel is one of, if not the most, famous — or infamous — of automotive blunders. But despite being kind of homely and pricey, the Edsel wasn’t actually a bad car. Meant to slot just below Lincoln, Ford sunk $400 million (over $4 billion today) into developing the brand from scratch, hiring experts and market researchers to “find out what the public wants” – without actually showing anyone the car it was building.\nWhen the brand that “Makes History by Making Sense” debuted on a special prime-time program on September 4, 1957, it was met with shock. Even in the late ’50s its styling was considered garish, and its trademark upright grille became known as the “horse collar” in polite company (it was compared to the female anatomy behind closed doors). While history has softened on the brand’s outrageous cars (this one fetched $35,750 at an RM Sotheby’s auction ), the Edsel has become a lesson in how not to launch a brand. Ironically enough, the Edsel’s big block V8 soldiered on long after the brand disappeared, remaining available in Lincoln models through 1968.\n\n9. 1985-’92 Yugo GV Source: Motorweek via YouTube\nThe Yugo. The pinnacle of automotive imperfection. The gold standard of inferior craftsmanship that gave off the impression “of something assembled at gunpoint.” It’s the car that all crappy, poorly made subcompacts strive to be when they grow up. The Yugo GV (for “Great Value!”) reached our shores in 1985 as the cheapest car in America: $3,995 ($8,500 today). In other parts of the world, the Yugo was known as the Zastava Koral, a Serbian-built clone of a ’70s-era Fiat 124. In America, the engine had a tendency of not working, bits of the car would fall off, and the electrical system seemed to be more for show than anything else – and that was before it left dealerships. Yugo quietly left our shores in 1992, and despite NATO bombing the factory in 1999, the car astonishingly remained in production until 2008.\nToday, the former Yugo plant is owned by Fiat Chrysler, and it builds the Fiat 500L there, leading us to believe the factory is haunted and probably never should’ve been rebuilt.\n\n10. 2001 Pontiac Aztek Daniel Lippitt/AFP/Getty Images\nThere’s the Edsel, the Cimarron, the Yugo, and of course, the Pontiac Aztek. In an effort to appeal to a younger crowd, Pontiac took a promising concept and cosmetically botched it so badly that its outward appearance scared off buyers before they could get close enough to unlock the damn thing. Apologists say that it was one of the first modern crossovers available, but Consumer Reports thought it was so bad, it abandoned its test car on its grounds. Astonishingly, the Aztek’s profile has gotten a serious image boost among Millennials thanks to its cameo on Breaking Bad. To the kids who don’t remember just how bad they were the first time around: Don’t go anywhere near this hunk of plastic, you’ll regret it.\nAdditional Reporting by James Derek Sapienza \nCheck out Autos Cheat Sheet on Facebook and Twitter \nLike classics?

F, -1.53% Chief Executive Mark Fields said the car maker still plans to move production of Focus sedans to Mexico despite criticism from President-elect Donald Trump, according to an interview with The Wall Street Journal Friday. Such move will mean no loss of U.S. jobs and is expected for 2018, Fields told the newspaper. The Michigan plant would produce more profitable, larger vehicles. Fields said in September the move was aimed at \"reinventing\" Ford's small-vehicle busines s and at cutting costs. Trump said earlier Friday companies moving jobs abroad would face \"consequences.\" Shares of Ford were up 0.1% in the extended session after ending the regular trading day down 1.5%.",

      "text": "10 locally made gifts your foodie friends will love \nThe closure of the Ford auto plant means you can’t buy a Ranger pickup assembled in the Saintly City. \nBut there’s still plenty of stuff, from the hip to the traditional, made right here within the city limits. These are makers who don’t outsource overseas or even across the river. They’re artisans who aren’t in Nordeast or manufacturers who aren’t from Asia. \nSo for St. Paulites who want to shop local-local this holiday season, here’s our gift guide of some merchandise made in the shop just around the corner. LEATHER WORKS MINNESOTA Leather Works Minnesota employee Joe Madsen puts the finishing touches on leather toothpick holders. (Richard Chin) \nLeather Works Minnesota is a mom, pop and son operation that carries a line of handmade leather accessories it makes in its Lowertown shop. That includes wallets, belts, bags, pencil cases, suspenders, key fobs, dog leashes, camera straps and even an old-fashioned slingshot with a leather pouch. Keep your toothpicks safe the way Leonardo DiCaprio does. (Courtesy Leather Works Minnesota) \nBut our favorite item is one of the least expensive, a classy leather toothpick holder for $6. \nWe’re not the only ones who like it. Leather Works Minnesota co-owner Kent Begnaud said he just heard that Leonardo DiCaprio rode his bike to the Northern Grade retail location in New York to buy a toothpick holder for himself. \nYou can buy online or at different retailers or at the retail shop right where the products are made in the Northern Warehouse building, 308 E. Prince St. HAMILTON INK SPOT Some Minnesota-themed posters at Hamilton Ink Spot. (Richard Chin) \nHamilton Ink Spot , 375 N. Wabasha St. in downtown St. Paul, is a nonprofit cooperative print studio, gallery and retail space selling original poster art, prints and cards hand-printed on site on its letterpress. Posters and prints run $10 to $40. \nBut if you don’t like what you see on the walls, the shop will be holding a do-it-yourself letterpress holiday-card-making session from noon to 4 p.m. Dec. 10. It’s $5 per person, or $10 for families. MADEMOISELLE MIEL Chocolate Mademoiselle Miel bon-bons made with honey from hives kept in downtown St. Paul. (Richard Chin) \nYou can buy a locally made Pearson Salted Nut Roll or a bag of Chicago Mix at Candyland, but how many sweet treats exist where the raw ingredients are made in St. Paul? The entrance of Mademoiselle Miel describes what’s inside. (Richard Chin) \nThat’s the case with the Mademoiselle Miel honey bon-bons, where honey collected from nearly 30 bee hives kept on rooftops in downtown St. Paul are encased with chocolate and then hand burnished with 23 karat edible gold leaf. \nThe kitchen, showroom and location for one of the hives is on 342 W. Kellogg Boulevard, across the street from the Minnesota History Center. \nRight now they’re featuring an eight-piece seasonal bon-bon collection for $19, with Ginger-spiced Chai, Maple Caramel, Orange with Peel and Warm Cherry Honey bon-bons. HACKWITH DESIGN HOUSE A team of St. Paul seamsters at Hackwith Design House. (Courtesy Hackwith Design House) \nLisa Hackwith started sewing and selling clothing from her home in 2010. She’s still sewing, but now she’s got six employees in a 4,000-square-foot space and about a half-million dollars in annual sales. HDH Basics black kimono for $130 by Hackwith Design House. (Courtesy Hackwith Design House) \nHackwith Design House designs, cuts, sews, sells and ships its women’s ready-to-wear lifestyle brand all out of a space in what used to be the old King Koil mattress factory, now known as Vandalia Tower, 550 Vandalia St. \nHackwith specializes in ethically-made, sustainable fabrics, making everything from swimwear to bridal dresses, with customers in New York, Los Angeles and the Twin Cities. \nOne of its top sellers is the HDH Basics Kimono for $130. PODIUMWEAR Elite cross country skier Jessie Diggins models a Podiumwear jacket made in St. Paul. (Courtesy of Podiumwear) \nIf you need something more athletic, Podiumwear designs and makes custom team clothing for cycling, cross-country skiing, running, triathlon and ultimate Frisbee at its location at 626 Armstrong Ave., St. Paul. \nRight now they’re carrying a seasonal line of clothing designed, endorsed, modeled by and benefiting Jessie Diggins, a medal-winning World Cup cross-country ski racer from Minnesota. \nThe Diggins women’s Silver Jacket runs $155. J.W. HULME This is your bag if you have $1,475. The large Weekend Satchel by J.W. Hulme is made on West Seventh Street in St. Paul. (Courtesy of J.W. Hulme Co.) \nJ.W. Hulme Co. , a luxury leather goods company, was founded in St. Paul in 1905. Their current location is a modest-looking commercial building on 678 W. Seventh St. \nThe luggage, briefcases and bags made in that building are anything but modest. \nAt $1,475, Hulme’s large leather weekend satchel might be more expensive than anything you pack into it. But it’s sized as a carry-on, so it never has to leave your sight. VANDALIA GLASSWORKS Hand-blown pint glasses like these made at Vandalia Glassworks cost $60 a pair. (Richard Chin) \nAll that craft beer available lately deserves to be drunk in a pint glass that’s equally artisan. Vandalia Glassworks studio manager Rachel Masica at work making a pint glass. (Richard Chin) \nYou can find some, along with glass vases, lamps, bowls, ornaments and sculptures at the year-old Vandalia Glassworks (vandaliaglassworks.com), a glassblowing facility in the Vandalia Tower, 550 Vandalia St. \nStudio manager Rachel Masica makes and sells pint glasses for $60 a pair. \nVISTABULE The Vistabule trailer is made in the Hamline-Midway area of St. Paul. (Courtesy of Vistabule) \nThe Vistabule is described as a tear-drop trailer. But you can think of it as a tiny house on wheels. \nThe airy, stylish, retro-style little camper has a base price of $16,995 and comes outfitted with a Baltic birch interior, sun roof, reading lights, porch lights, galley and a sleeping area that converts into a sofa/table setup. \nYou can add on extras like a two-burner stove, a sink with running water, a refrigerator, furnace and air conditioning, mood lighting, solar panels and exterior color options. \nVistabule , created by furniture designer Bert Taylor, built 58 of the trailers this year in a 16,000-square-foot space in the former Silgan can factory on Prior Avenue in the Hamline-Midway area. \nNext year they hope to double production. URBAN BOATBUILDERS A Wee Lassie canoe built by teenagers in St. Paul. (Courtesy of Urban Boatbuilders) \nThe original Wee Lassie-style canoe was built in the late 1800s by a New York boat builder named J. Henry Rushton. Boat builder Anthony Williams sanding a canoe frame in the Urban Boatbuilders shop. (Richard Chin) \nMore than 100 years later, St. Paul high schoolers are building a similar version of the lightweight, single-person, double-paddle boat on University Avenue in St. Paul. \nUrban Boatbuilders teaches at-risk youth about teamwork, craftsmanship and perseverance while they build wood canoes, kayaks, sailboats, rowing skiffs and stand-up paddleboards at a workshop at 2288 W. University Ave. \nThe boats are launched by the youth apprentices and go on sale to the public to help support the program. \nRight now among the boats they have on sale is a 13-foot Wee Lassie available for $1,350. Its skin-on-frame construction uses white pine, ash and cherry in the frame. The weight: only 22 pounds. Tags:",

      "text": "Report: 2017 Ford GT carries 600-plus horsepower with style 1 / 17 Back to Gallery \nThe new Ford GT is so aerodynamic that its chassis is designed to be as narrow as possible and still hold a driver and passenger, according to Road & Track . \nBob Sorokanich, a writer for the magazine, got to ride along during road testing of 2017 GT prototypes at Las Vegas Motor Speedway on a recent December morning. \nHe learned that the tight squeeze was the result of the designers' putting the driver and passenger as close together as possible and then wrapping the cabin around them. \nHYBRID MINIVAN : Chrysler 2017 Pacifica can go 30-plus miles on battery \nThe center console is no wider than a smartphone, Sorokanich noted. \nWhile some performance-car aficionados have groused that it's just wrong to put a V6 engine in such a robust machine, they're missing the point, Sorokanich said. \n\"I can feel the finesse, the way the car answers to the most delicate inputs, even as the tires scramble for grip,\" he wrote. \nBut he couldn't directly compare the GT with other performance cars because some of the specs were still in final calibration, and Ford declined to divulge others, he said. \nHorsepower? \"More than 600,\" was all the company would tell him. \nTop speed? More than 200 mph. \nTop price? Each GT will be built to order so it's unlikely any two will be the same. According to Road & Track, a price tag of half a million dollars is a \"distinct possibility.\" Latest Cars Video",

      "text": "First came Ford and Carrier. Now Boeing and SoftBank are experiencing the power of Donald Trump 's Twitter feed.\nThe president-elect jumped into corporate affairs again Tuesday, tweeting first to criticize one company and then to hail another. He began at 8:52 a.m. New York time by calling out Boeing Co. over costs to develop new Air Force One jets. Just over five hours later he celebrated a $50 billion investment in the U.S. by Japanese telecommunications firm SoftBank Group Corp.\nThe tweets, coming after Trump last week announced a deal with United Technologies Corp. to cancel plans to close a U.S. factory, dominated news and moved markets even as details in both cases remained sketchy and the impacts unclear. Trump again showed a willingness to use his bully pulpit to criticize or congratulate companies over actions affecting American workers and government spending.\n\"This is extraordinary,\" said Mohan Tatikonda, a professor at Indiana University 's Kelley School of Business. \"For a president to get involved at the level of spot locations, spot companies, spot plants, is I think unprecedented.\"\nThis is extraordinary. For a president to get involved at the level of spot locations, spot companies, spot plants, is I think unprecedented. — Mohan Tatikonda, a professor at Indiana University's Kelley School of Business. The president-elect's moves had consequences for the market, with Boeing falling as much as 1.5 percent before regular trading Tuesday. The shares rose less than 0.1 percent to $152.24 at the close in New York. SoftBank's American depositary receipts climbed 3 percent to $30.99.\nSprint Corp., which is controlled by SoftBank and is the No. 4 U.S. wireless carrier, rose 1.5 percent to $8.17 at the close. T-Mobile US Inc., which has long been mentioned as a possible merger partner for Sprint, rose 1.8 percent to $55.99 on speculation that SoftBank Chief Masayoshi Son's pledges could aid an eventual deal.\nA president who's too eager to pick winners and losers may prompt business owners to seek special treatment in Washington instead of focusing on improving operations, said Anne Krueger, an economics professor at Johns Hopkins University's School of Advanced International Studies.\n\"The rule of law is what prevents crony capitalism, and the minute you have the president-elect, politicians or bureaucrats meeting with business owners to dispense special favors it unlevels the playing field,\" said Krueger, a former first deputy director of the International Monetary Fund . \"We all ought to be screaming now because if we don't, we're going to be a third-world country before we know it.\"\nCarrier union leader says Trump's big deal is a lie Danielle Paquette The Secret Service agents told the Carrier workers to stay put, so Chuck Jones sat in the factory conference room for nearly three hours, waiting for president-elect Donald Trump . He'd grown used to this suspense.\nSeven months earlier, at a campaign rally in Indianapolis, Trump had pledged to save...\nThe Secret Service agents told the Carrier workers to stay put, so Chuck Jones sat in the factory conference room for nearly three hours, waiting for president-elect Donald Trump . He'd grown used to this suspense.\nSeven months earlier, at a campaign rally in Indianapolis, Trump had pledged to save...\n(Danielle Paquette) Trump's tweet about Air Force One -- \"Cancel order!\" he said -- came days after Boeing Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg called on him and Congress to ensure that U.S. companies have the tools to compete in a global economy. Trump said costs for the presidential aircraft program could exceed $4 billion.\nBoeing, the largest U.S. exporter, is currently working under a $170 million contract \"to help determine the capabilities of this complex military aircraft,\" spokesman Todd Blecher said in an e-mail.\nBoeing executives told officials on Trump's transition team that the cost of a new version of Air Force One could be lowered if the government agrees to reduce its technical requirements, Bloomberg News reported. On Wednesday, Trump said he spoke to Boeing and would work to reduce the program's costs.\nTrump's tough tweet goal: Rattle Boeing Robert Reed It didn't take too long for President-elect Donald Trump to send a strong message to Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg.\nAs reported in today's column , the Chicago-based aerospace and defense giant is waiting to see how the incoming Trump administration will affect its business. Such concern especially...\nIt didn't take too long for President-elect Donald Trump to send a strong message to Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg.\nAs reported in today's column , the Chicago-based aerospace and defense giant is waiting to see how the incoming Trump administration will affect its business. Such concern especially...\n(Robert Reed) \"We're going to get the prices down and if we don't get the prices down, we're not going to order them. We're going to stick with what we have,\" he said in a phone interview with NBC.\nThe Pentagon already is budgeting $3.2 billion for research and development, military construction and acquisition of two of the Air Force One planes through fiscal 2021, said Kevin Brancato, the lead government contracts analyst for Bloomberg Government. Boeing 747-8 planes average about $225 million each, he said, which means most of the expenses will go to outfitting the planes with special capabilities for presidential use. They include advanced communications and classified defensive abilities that make them flying fortresses.\nTrump's willingness to attack the program -- one of the most visible symbols of the American presidency -- and go after specific companies generates uncertainty over the scrutiny government contractors may face under the new administration, said Jeff Windau, an Edward Jones analyst.\n\"That's something that investors are at least taking notice of today,\" he said.\nIntervention of this magnitude has little precedent, but past president such as Lyndon Johnson and John F. Kennedy were known for such practices. Johnson, for instance, fought inflation and targeted high prices on products as varied as eggs, steel and televisions.\n'Cancel order!' Trump tweets Air Force One deal 'out of control'; Boeing says it'll deliver 'best value' W.J. Hennigan President-elect Donald Trump took aim at Air Force One on Tuesday, criticizing the cost of the iconic 747 jumbo jet that has served as the president's flying White House and projected America's might wherever it lands.\nThe aircraft used by President Obama, built by Chicago-based Boeing Co., have been...\nPresident-elect Donald Trump took aim at Air Force One on Tuesday, criticizing the cost of the iconic 747 jumbo jet that has served as the president's flying White House and projected America's might wherever it lands.\nThe aircraft used by President Obama, built by Chicago-based Boeing Co., have been...\n(W.J. Hennigan) Johnson's impact was limited. But he didn't have Twitter.\n\"Mr. Trump's leadership style and communication style is abetted by the social media capabilities we have today,\" Tatikonda said. \"With Mr. Trump we will continue to see different kinds of executive models and ways of leadership than we've ever seen before.\"\nFollowing a series of meetings Tuesday with business leaders, the president-elect tweeted that SoftBank will invest in the U.S. and create 50,000 new jobs. Son, CEO of the Tokyo-based telecommunications company, told reporters the funding would go to \"new companies, startup companies in the United States.\" The money will come from SoftBank's previously announced $100 billion technology fund, Bloomberg News reported.\nTrump followed up the tweet with a second saying the company \"would never do this had we (Trump) not won the election!\" On Sunday, Vice President-elect Mike Pence said on ABC's \"This Week\" that Trump would decide whether to intervene with specific companies \"on a day-by-day basis.\"\nWhile Trump has turned Twitter into a powerful tool, the companies in his sights may not do the same.\n\"I know the right answer is not going to be tweet back, so don't expect us to be doing that,\" David Melcher, president and chief executive officer of the Aerospace Industries Association trade group, said after Trump's Boeing statement. \"The president-elect is going to have to decide how he wants to use that tool.\"\nWith assistance from Mike Dorning Thomas Black Alan Levin and Ben Brody",

      "text": "By Mary Conway 2016-12-07 21:35 2016 Ford F-150 owners debate the best floor mats Now that wintry weather is moving in through out the United States, drivers of 2015 and 2016 Ford F-150s are trying to determine the best floor mats for fit, coverage and wear. \nI don’t know why drivers wait until the wintry weather moves in to worry about floor mats, I guess it is just their nature to procrastinate. One of the hottest topics right now on a Ford F-150 forum is asking, “What is the best floor mat for a 2015 or 2016 Ford F-150?” \nThe Ford F-series has been the best-selling vehicle for decades and drivers are very opinionated about what seems to work the best. A vendor is the first to answer, “The Husky X-Acts are amazing mats on par with Weather Tech top of the line. The Huskys are going to cost less and get to you faster then the WT.” \nHusky apparently has two well-known offerings, the X-acts and the WeatherBeaters. The X-acts are more expensive but cheaper than the WeatherTechs. The interesting new design is a full panel than covers the entire floor of the back seat. No more little mats that slide around and allow dirt to get everywhere. \n“Another vote for Husky E-Act. Had WT's on last truck. IMO, Husky's are a big improvement.” It is amazing to me how many drivers have tried different companies over the years. Stan says “Had the Weathertech mats in the 350. they were great. Got the Husky Xact fit for the 150. I like them because I think they're a better looking mat and have a similar function. \nA driver from Georgia figures that Ford knows best. He says, “I bought the F-150 OEM tray style \"all weather\" floor mats, I like them!!” \nNot everyone is thrilled with the Husky X-act liners. A driver who calls himself Goat says the fit isn’t right. “Okay, just received my x-act front mats. love the mats, great looking! Fit is only okay though. There is a small 1/2\" to 1\" gap on the console side. i could probably push it over but that would mean not using the 'locking pin' for holding the mat in place. which brings me to the next problem; both 'locking pins' do not work with this mat-only the one closest to the door.” Now that would drive me crazy! \nAnother drawback for the Husky’s is that right now, they only come in one color. “If they had them in tan I would have tried them, but the only color choice being black was a deal breaker for me.” \nMike from Pennsylvania throws another option into the mix. “I have the 3D Maxxpider Mats and I love them. I purchased them in my wifes SUV first and we liked them so much that they were the first thing I purchased for the truck.” \nTodd from St. Louis weighed in, “My Husky WB, arrived today! These are way better than the oem rubber and carpet mats, my truck came with!Love the coverage, and slop protection.” \nAn Oklahoma driver is dedicated to WeatherTech. “Nothing but Weathertech in the last four (4) F150's. I even put a Weathertech Liner in the trunk of my Shelby GT500.”",
