      "text": "Members Only. Please Sign Up or Log In first. \nBookmark of this page has been deleted. The Continuing Story of Apple Pay Now the 5th-largest payment platform, can company keep it up? November 17, 2016 | About: AAPL +0% AMZN +0% \nIn two years Apple Pay has grown into the fifth-largest payment platform by transaction volume. \nAccording a report by The Country Caller , it was the release of Apple Pay on the web that helped Apple ’s ( NASDAQ:AAPL ) digital wallet scale these heights, beating competitors Google and Amazon ( NASDAQ:AMZN ). Another report by The Verge shows how the utility can be used on Apple devices. \n“ If you have an iPhone, iPad or Mac running these most recent releases, you should be able to select 'checkout with Apple Pay' when completing a purchase on a participating site, letting you authorize your purchase with Touch ID. Apple Pay will only work on the Safari browser, though, and if you're paying via desktop you'll have to have the Continuity feature enabled to hand the payment over to your mobile, tablet or Apple Watch.” – Verge , Sept. 15 Peter Lynch Chart of AAPL \nIt was after the release of iOS 10 that support for Apple’s digital wallet was made available on mobile as well as desktops. By taking things to the web, Apple is making sure that it is not just a mobile payment system but a proper payments transactor, allowing in-store payments and the ability to pay using any Apple device. Though mobile payments have been growing in the last few years, web transactions still account for the lion’s share of online payments as people tend to be more comfortable in pulling out their details when they are on a bigger screen. \nSource: Adyen \nAccording to Adyen, a payments platform, only one-third of global online transactions happened through mobile in the fourth quarter of 2015, but it’s been growing. \n\" Our latest Mobile Payments Index, which tracked mobile web payment transaction data around the world across select payment methods for the fourth quarter of 2015, has found that for the first time, more than one-third (34%) of online payments are now made on a mobile device, compared to just over 30% last quarter.\" – Adyen \nThat leaves a considerable amount of market on the table even if Apple chose to keep Apple Pay as a mobile-only service. By expanding into the web, Apple has made sure that hole has been filled. If it really steps up the game on the merchants' side, then Apple can give a serious run for PayPal’s money in the not-too-distant future. \nIt is well known that Apple users are generally more ready to open up their wallets to digital payments than the average Android user. Apple targets the high end of the smartphone spectrum. It’s logical that an average Apple user’s disposable income will tend to be higher than that of an Android user. Android has the user base volume, but iOS has better buying power per user. \nWith millions of potential users under its belt, Apple Pay can only get bigger and bigger from here. Apple needs to push a bit harder on the merchant side and keep adding more stores to its list. As the list grows, total payment volume will escalate. \nSeen from a revenue contribution perspective Apple Pay is still a small part of Apple’s services ecosystem. But Apple’s future now depends on the company finding a viable and sustainable source of revenue outside devices – more specifically, outside of iPhone sales, which currently contribute to more than 60% of overall revenue. As such, Apple Pay is possibly the one segment within its services portfolio that is making all the right moves in the right direction. \nAlthough the services segment only contributed to 11.29% of overall income in 2016 – $24.348 billion against a total of $215.639 billion – that has grown significantly from the 8.52% contribution that Apple posted in 2015 – $19.909 billion against a total of $233.715 billion. The contribution is growing, and the gap between iPhone sales and services revenue is slowly but surely growing smaller. In fact, in 2016 services contributed more toward overall revenues than iPad or Mac sales, which came in at $20.628 billion and $22.831 billion. \nThat small but significant movement is what Apple Pay currently represents for Apple – a gradual shift from heavy dependency on iPhone sales. And that is what Apple needs for the future. \nDisclosure: I have no positions in the stock mentioned above and no intention to initiate a position in the next 72 hours. \nStart a free seven-day trial of Premium Membership to GuruFocus.

      "text": "\nEverything you need to know about call history and the latest sensationalized Apple 'security' non-scandal.\n\nRene Ritchie has been covering Apple and the personal technology industry for almost a decade. Editorial director for Mobile Nations, analyst for iMore, video and podcast host, you can follow him on Snapchat, Instagram, or Twitter @reneritchie.\n\nApple has been accused of secretly, surreptitiously backing up and syncing your iPhone call history, in a hidden, and implicitly nefarious way. Sadly, the only thing nefarious here are the motivations of the publications that chose to invent the story. When I asked Apple about the accusation, here's the statement they gave me.\n\"We offer call history syncing as a convenience to our customers so that they can return calls from any of their devices,\" an Apple spokesperson told iMore. \"Apple is deeply committed to safeguarding our customers' data. That's why we give our customers the ability to keep their data private. Device data is encrypted with a user's passcode, and access to iCloud data including backups requires the user's Apple ID and password. Apple recommends all customers select strong passwords and use two-factor authentication.\"\nI'm guessing that was after an epic double face palm, head desk, or both.\nWait, back up, what is this all about? Forbes posted the following:\nApple has a hidden feature for you in its iPhones: call logs going back as far as four months are stored in near real-time in the iCloud. That's the warning today from a Russian provider of iPhone hacking tools, Elcomsoft, which claimed the feature was automatic and there was no way to turn it off bar shutting down iCloud Drive altogether.\nYowza! \"Hidden\" feature, really? The Information called it \"secretly\" and \"surreptitiously\", but it's not only wicked obvious why Apple is syncing call history, it's fully disclosed in Apple's security white paper :\nHere's what iCloud backs up:\nInformation about purchased music, movies, TV shows, apps, and books, but not the purchased content itself Photos and videos in Camera Roll Contacts, calendar events, reminders, and notes Device settings App data PDFs and books added to iBooks but not purchased Call history Home screen and app organization iMessage, text (SMS), and MMS messages Ringtones HomeKit data HealthKit data VisualVoicemail Why is it \"wicked obvious\"? Because, when you restore an iPhone from backup, including a new iPhone that replaces your old one, or you enable continuity calling so you can make phone calls from your iPad or Mac, you see your call history.\nIf Apple wasn't backing up and syncing that information, you would lose it every time you restored your iPhone, and you'd have frustratingly different calling lists across your devices.\nIt's like setting up your email in Mail on multiple machines and then being told Apple is secretly backing up and syncing your inbox. Or bookmark sync for your browser.\nBut what about security and privacy?! Security and privacy are continually at war with convenience. It's incredibly touch to balance both.\nI make 50% of my calls off the call history list (the rest are with Siri), and maybe that makes me a terrible person, but it also makes it an indispensable service for me both to back up and to sync.\nIf call history sync concerns you, you can disable iCloud Drive in preferences and it'll stop. (It'd be nice if Apple made those all separate settings in iCloud.com, though others may argue it would result in settings fatigue.)\nIs there anything Apple could do to make this more secure? Always! Security is an uphill battle, especially when you're designing systems for mainstream consumers that need to be accessible and approachable. Storing call history in iCloud Drive may be workable but there may also be a better, more granular option as well.\niOS 9 brought 2-factor authentication and iOS 10 made it easier to use. I expect that pattern will continue and we'll keep getting better protection and easier management going forward.\nFor now, as always, be informed but don't be panicked.\niOS \niOS 10 Review iOS 10 FAQ iOS 10 News Hub iOS help guide iOS Discussion ",

      "text": "Google Plus Image: Apple Inc. \niCloud is Apple's cloud file storage and services platform. The service permits users to leverage secure and highly reliable cloud computing features and capabilities to store and share a wide variety of files, locate lost equipment, and synchronize information across multiple devices. \nApple's iCloud includes multiple features and components. The features included with iCloud are iCloud Drive, iCloud Storage Plans (additional file storage), iCloud Photo Library (cloud-based photo storage), Family Sharing (account and resource sharing), Safari and iCloud Keychain services, and more. \nWe'll periodically update this resource guide when new information is available about iCloud. \nSEE: Cloud Computing Policy (Tech Pro Research) Executive summary What it is: The cloud service permits users to store and share files across multiple devices and platforms, including with other authorized users. Using iCloud, users can also locate lost equipment, share web surfing status with other devices, share passwords across multiple authorized devices, and synchronize common personal information management components such as mail, Calendar, and Contacts. Users can leverage iCloud to back up iPhones, iPads, and iPod touches. Why it matters: Cloud services play an increasingly important role fulfilling file sharing, collaboration, and application needs. Apple's iCloud service adds more features, including the ability to locate misplaced devices, calendar and contact synchronization, and cloud-based backup. Who this affects: Apple customers benefit most from iCloud. Mac, iPhone, iPad, and iPod users can all leverage the cloud platform to add functionality and serviceability to such Apple devices. While iCloud components, including bookmark synchronization, web-based file access, creation, editing and sharing, and limited application access are all available to Windows users, Apple users—for whom iCloud integration is baked into devices' operating systems—receive additional functionality. When it was released: Apple iCloud entered service October 12, 2011 after being announced at the 2011 Apple Worldwide Developer's Conference (WWDC) on June 6, 2011. The predecessor service MobileMe launched January 5, 2000 and was re-launched as part of Apple's .Mac effort on July 17, 2002. MobileMe was ultimately discontinued June 30, 2012. How to get it: An iCloud setup assistant is built into iPhones, iPads, iPod touches, and Macs. Apple offers directions for setting iCloud up on iOS devices , Macs , and Windows machines . Apple includes 5 GB of free storage with each iCloud account. In the US, 50 GB additional storage costs $0.99 per month; 200 GB costs $2.99 a month; 1TB costs $9.99 a month; and 2 TB costs $19.99 a month. File storage capacity and pricing options vary by country . \nSEE: Check out all of TechRepublic's smart person's guides (TechRepublic) What it is \nThe cloud service permits users to store, back up, access, view, edit, and share a variety of files and information, including documents, spreadsheets, presentations, photos, videos, music, email, bookmarks, and more across multiple devices and platforms, including with other authorized users. The devices across which iCloud users can share files include Macs, iPhones, iPads, iPod touches, and Windows PCs and tablets. \niCloud System Preferences enable customizing the cloud-computing operation. \nUsing iCloud, users can also locate lost equipment. The Find My iPhone feature permits iCloud users to track iPhones, iPads, and Macs. Users can sign into iCloud or use the Find My iPhone app to determine the location of a missing device for which the feature was previously enabled. \nIf a device is lost, iCloud users can remotely send the device a command placing it in Lost Mode, which helps protect the device's data against unauthorized use and encourages whoever retrieves the device to call the owner. iCloud users can also implement a remote erase operation, if necessary to remove personal data from a lost device.

      "text": "\n© 2016 Time Inc. All rights reserved. The iPhone 8 Is Coming and It’s Going to Be Big \nThe staff of Fortune recently assembled its predictions for 2017 . Here’s one of our forecasts. \nLoyal Apple aapl fans have had mixed feelings about the company’s 2016 offerings. The iPhone 7 had a few improvements, but lost its headphone jack and kept the same increasingly dated exterior design that debuted in 2014 with the iPhone 6. \nFans’ sense of ennui likely that won’t be a problem next year, though. The rumor mill is already cranking with leaks about the iPhone 8. Marking the 10th anniversary of Steve Jobs’ original iPhone, the new model is expected to include significant changes, like a super high resolution OLED screen that stretches from edge to edge of the device—with the home button transforming into a virtual on screen button. Other possible features include wireless charging capability. For more on the new iPhone, watch this Fortune video: \nAfter the mildly disappointing iPhone 7, look for the next update to be more radical—and a more radical hit. ",

      "text": "Report: Apple exploring possibility of manufacturing iPhones in U.S. By Jesse Hollington @jhollington ● 13 minutes ago \nApple has been asking its suppliers to study the possibility of moving iPhone production to the U.S., according to a new report by Nikkei Asian Review . Back in June, Apple reportedly approached both of its major iPhone assemblers, Foxconn and Pegatron, asking them to look into making iPhones in the U.S.; Foxconn agreed, but Pegatron declined due to cost concerns. Sources for the report indicated that although Foxconn has been working on outlining a plan for Apple, Foxconn Chairman Terry Gou had been “less enthusiastic” about it as production costs would inevitably rise — the cost of producing an iPhone in the U.S. would be expected to more than double. The move from Apple appears to be due to concerns about U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s promises to push U.S. based companies back to domestic manufacturing, promising to slap a 45 percent import tariff on any goods made in China. In addition to increased costs, however, moving full iPhone production into to U.S. may not even be feasible due to a lack of skilled workers and a cluster of domestic suppliers of components.",

      "text": "I generally prefer product ads that focus on the product. Apple's recent Midnight spot for iPhone 7 and Go Time spot for Watch are terrific examples of that. I especially prefer ads where it doesn't take until the very end to see what they're about. So, by all rights, I shouldn't like Apple's new MacBook Pro spot, Bulbs , any more than I did their recent iOS spot, Balloons. But I do. I like it quite a lot.\nI think what works for me here is the fun factor. The popping lightbulbs set to that classic score is delightful and, when it becomes clear we're being taken on a journey through the history of human technological achievement, it's beyond delightful.\nI can't tell if that's a Lisa or a Mac in the sequence — shame on me! — but the choice of an iPhone 4s to represent that milestone, as opposed to the original, is super interesting. The glass-wrapped steel design is absolutely iconic, though, isn't it?\nThe bulbs bursting seem to echo the explosive, brief nature of ideas over time, and lead, of course, to the new MacBook Pro .\nI hope Apple juxtaposes it with ads showing off features like Touch Bar and Touch ID, but I'm surprised to find I like this as a starting point. It almost challenges you to pick up a Pro and become that next bulb.\nLet me know what you think of it in the comments below!\n",

      "text": "Home / News / Mobile Phone News / Apple might be about to make Donald Trump very happy Apple might be about to make Donald Trump very happy \nby Chris Smith Read Comments \nApple is reportedly considering bringing iPhone manufacturing back to the United States. \nNikkei sources say Cupertino has asked its manufacturing partners to investigate the possibility of moving the operation to home soil. \n\"Apple asked both Foxconn and Pegatron, the two iPhone assemblers, in June to look into making iPhones in the U.S.,\" the source said. \"Foxconn complied, while Pegatron declined to formulate such a plan due to cost concerns.\" \nAccording to the resort, Foxconn is willing to comply given Apple makes up 50% of its business, but is concerned about the rise in production costs. \n\" Making iPhones in the US means the cost will more than double ,\" the source said. \nApple is likely to come under pressure from President-elect Donald Trump, who vowed to make Tim Cook’s company build “their damn computers and things” in the US during the campaign. \nTrump has pledged to hit US companies with a 45% levy on importing goods manufactured abroad, something Apple that could offset much of the savings Apple makes by producing iPhones in China. \nThe former Apprentice host wants those manufacturing positions to be filled by American workers. \nThere are an estimated 690,000 people currently employed at Foxconn in China, although the company recently replaced 60,000 factory workers with robots. \nApple briefly experimented with US manufacturing by building the Mac Pro on a production line in Austin, Texas but there’s been nothing since 2013. \nIn an interview on 60 Minutes late last year CEO Tim Cook said returning manufacturing to the US would present serious logistical issues for the company. \nHe said: \"To make iPhones, there will need to be a cluster of suppliers in the same place, which the U.S. does not have at the moment,\" the executive said. \"Even if Trump imposes a 45% tariff, it is still possible that manufacturers will decide to continue production overseas as long as the costs together with the tariffs are lower than the amount they need to spend on building and running production lines in the U.S.\" \nWill Trump force Apple into Making America iPhone Makers Again?

      "text": "Above: The iPhone 7 in jet black. Image Credit: Jordan Novet/VentureBeat \nApple has asked two companies that make its iPhones in China, Foxconn and Pegatron, to explore the idea of moving iPhone manufacturing to the U.S., according to a new report. \nThe report today from Nikkei Asian Review , citing unnamed sources, comes one week after Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election. Trump said in January that he wants to “get Apple to build their damn computers and things in this country instead of other countries.” \nWhile iPhone sales have declined and cut overall sales for the company as a whole, Apple remains the most valuable company in the world, and profit margins owing to its manufacturing methods certainly contribute to that position. But Trump has shown he wants to push Apple to change, not only in the area of manufacturing but also when it comes to encryption. He proposed an Apple boycott during the Apple-FBI controversy earlier this year because Apple would not help law enforcement access an iPhone. And now Trump is president-elect. \nThe report today quotes one person as saying that U.S. iPhone manufacturing would more than double the cost, on a per-unit basis. \nApple does assemble its 2013 Mac Pro desktop computer in the U.S. \nPreviously Foxconn came under fire for its workplace practices during iPhone manufacturing. Earlier this year BuzzFeed was allowed to visit a Chinese Foxconn factory. \nApple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

      "text": "President-elect Donald Trump really wants Apple to move its iPhone production to the U.S. And he may be happy to learn that Apple is considering it, according to a published report.\nIn June, Apple asked two of its chief iPhone manufacturers, Foxconn Technology Group and Pegatron, to explore shifting their iPhone production to the U.S., the Nikkei is reporting , citing an unidentified source who claims to have knowledge of the talks. Pegatron ultimately declined to pursue the idea because of fear of “cost concerns,” the source told Nikkei. But Foxconn continues to weigh it, the source said.\nApple gets iPhone components from all over the world, but relies on Pegatron and Foxconn to manufacture the smartphone in China in part because of cheaper labor.\nThat reduced cost has been a boon for Apple, which sells hundreds of millions of iPhones annually and generates billions of dollars in profits on those sales each quarter.\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune's technology newsletter \nApple’s AAPL success didn’t go unnoticed by President-elect Donald Trump, who in March voiced concerns the iPhone maker’s reliance on China. He said during a speech that he would “get Apple to start making their computers and their iPhones on our land, not in China.” Trump this year also called for a boycott of Apple products after the company declined to provide the FBI with a method for unlocking an iPhone used by San Bernardino terrorist Syed Farook.\nTrump has also said that he would slap China with expensive tariffs on its goods and accused it of being a “ currency manipulator .” While Trump’s comments were viewed merely as rhetoric earlier this year, his election has caused many to question whether he could make good on his promise.\nFor more about Apple’s iPhone 7, watch: \nEarlier this week, the Chinese government published an editorial through state-run Global Times warning of the possibility of Trump ruining “Sino-U.S. trade.” The editorial specifically cited Apple’s iPhones as a potential victim in that possible trade war.\n\"China will take a tit-for-tat approach then,\" the Global Times said in its editorial. \"A batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus. U.S. auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and U.S. soybean and maize imports will be halted. China can also limit the number of Chinese students studying in the U.S.\"\nWhile it’s unclear why Apple asked its manufacturing partners to explore building iPhones in the U.S., the company could be coming to the realization that it might not make sound financial sense to move to the U.S. According to one Nikkei source, moving iPhone production from China to the U.S. would “more than double” what Apple pays now to have its iPhones manufactured.\nThat comment follows similar statements that industry experts made this week in interviews with The Wall Street Journal . According to the Journal , those experts, including Sanford C. Bernstein’s Alberto Moel, say it’s possible that Apple would move iPhone manufacturing to the U.S., but the effort would be exceedingly difficult, costly, and take a considerable amount of time. The chances, then, are slim.\nStill, Apple does do some manufacturing in the U.S. That includes the company’s high-end desktop computer, the Mac Pro, while nearly all of its research-and-development efforts are done in its home country.\nApple declined to comment on the Nikkei report. Foxconn and Pegatron did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

      "title": "Can Apple’s new MacBook Pro ad convince you on the Touch Bar?",
      "text": "Reddit \nApple didn’t quite get the reception it was expecting for the new MacBook Pro, particularly when it comes to the contentious Touch Bar. Now, it’s turning to a new advert to try to hammer the message home that its slim strip of customizable buttons above the keyboard on the new notebook is more dramatic an innovation than, say, the full touchscreen you might find on a Windows 10 machine. To do so, it’s going on a memory trip through old breakthroughs. \nThe commercial, dubbed “Bulbs”, has the tagline “Ideas push the world forward.” It certainly doesn’t hold back in putting the new MacBook Pro and its Touch Bar in important company, either. Things kick off with the discovery of fire and the invention of the wheel, and escalate from there. \nSo, we’ve got the agricultural contributions of the plow, metal working, the realization of gravity by Sir Isaac Newton, and the steam engine. Human flight, motorbikes, clockwork, and modern lenses as used in binoculars, spectacles, and telescopes also get a namecheck. More recently, the telephone, the microwave, and television are cited. \nApple even gives itself an extra pat on the back, with the iPhone showing up in the roster of achievements. Whether it’s considered more or less important than the personal jet pack, Tamagotchi, zip fly, or Sony AIBO robot dog is unclear. The whole thing is punctuated with exploding light bulbs chasing through a darkened city. \nThe Touch Bar’s petition for inclusion in such an illustrious list is “introducing a tool for all ideas to come.” That’s no small ambition, though Apple made an earnest pitch for its vision of how touch and notebooks should co-exist at the new laptop’s introduction. Rather than forcing you to lift your hands off the keyboard and stretch up to tap the display, so the Cupertino firm’s argument goes, it makes much more sense to leave your hands in something near to their regular position and simply have you reach out to tap the touchscreen strip that replaces – though can also replicate – the function keys. \nAs we found in our review of the new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar , the reality is a little more complicated, at least as it stands today. The hardware certainly integrates nicely into the revamped laptop, and the addition of a Touch ID sensor is most welcome, but right now there are only a few applications which actually have Touch Bar functionality. Those that do – mostly Apple’s own apps – for the most part just replicate keyboard shortcuts. \nThat’s something which has left professional users that would generally go straight for a new MacBook Pro wondering whether Apple has forgotten them in the process of “innovating.” More third-party software will follow in time, and indeed Microsoft has committed to supporting the Touch Bar in Office, as will Adobe in Photoshop, but some power-user-friendly features like being able to pin Automator workflows to the strip aren’t supported. Check out the new “Bulbs” advert below, and let us know if you’re convinced in the comments. Story Timeline",

      "text": "Trending Articles: Trending Articles: Iphones secretly send your call history to Apple's cloud, even after you tell them not to   Source: Boing Boing \nApple has acknowledged that its Icloud service is a weak link in its security model, because by design Apple can gain access to encrypted data stored in its customers' accounts, which means that the company can be hacked, coerced or tricked into revealing otherwise secure customer data to law enforcement, spies and criminals. \nSo it's alarming to learn that Iphones are designed to synch your call history -- which includes calls placed over Skype, Whatsapp and Viber -- to your Icloud account, even if you have turned this setting off. To make things worse, this synch operation is hidden from you: this data is not visible when you browse your Icloud account, but Apple still has it. \nThe discovery came from Russian security firm Elcomsoft, who make tools that help law-enforcement, private security and Apple customers gain access to data on Apple devices without the logins and passwords that are normally used to access this data. \nApple has acknowledged that this undocumented, secret synchronization takes place and advises its customers to use two-factor authentication as an additional protective measure, though it's not clear whether this would protect Apple users against secret search warrants served against Apple itself. \nApple has announced plans to redesign Icloud so that customers can opt to keep their data private from the company, but there is no public timeline for this, and as things stand today, Icloud data can be decrypted by Apple. \nChris Soghoian, chief technologist for the American Civil Liberties Union, said he’s not surprised that Apple is collecting the information. \n“It’s arguably not even the worst thing about iCloud,” he told The Intercept. “The fact that iCloud backs up what would otherwise be end-to-end encrypted iMessages is far worse in my mind. There are other ways the government can obtain [call logs]. But without the backup of iMessages, there may be no other way for them to get those messages.” \nStill, he said it’s further proof that “iCloud really is the Achilles heel of the privacy of the iPhone platform. The two biggest privacy problems associated with iCloud don’t have check boxes [for users to opt out], nor do they require that you opt in either.”",

      "title": "Apple Might Make iPhones in America?",
      "text": "  Apple Might Make iPhones in America? Apple Might Make iPhones in America? November   So there I am reading my tech blogs today. I took a little break, scoured the tech blogs. Not to delve deeply; just to see what was popping. And I saw a headline: \"Apple Could Make iPhones in US in Future.\" And I said, \"Whoa! Now wait a minute.\" Remember during the campaign Trump said he was gonna make Apple make iPhones in America. And everybody said, can't happen, including me. I said this cannot happen, and the reason it can't happen -- well, there are many reasons why I thought it couldn't happen. \nI mean, I can go through some of them right now. I mean, you could do it, but you couldn't keep the price what they are now. They would be significantly more expensive simply because of the volume. We don't have, in the United States, factory infrastructure to manufacture iPhones. Not if they were all made here. They could make a few here, if they wanted to split it up. But the factories in China where iPhones are made, there's two companies that make iPhones. One's called Hon Hai Precision, and the Anglicized name is Foxconn. And another company is called Pegatron. \nFoxconn makes the vast majority. They have factories where there are as many as 300 to 500,000 people on the assembly lines. The iPhone is one of the greatest technological marvels in consumer electronics ever. The amount of research and development and precision and technology in an iPhone, I guarantee you, 99% of people who use them have no idea. Not that they should. They just use them. That's what they're for. They just work. But the technology in these things is mind-boggling, how far we've advanced, the precision of manufacturing, the miniaturization in sizes. It's mind-boggling if you get into it and find out about it. \nApple's procedures and manufacturing, just the cases for the phones, just the glass -- well, they subcontract that out to Corning, but trust me, it's an amazing undertaking. They are not machine made. Parts of them are, but the final assembly has to be done by hand. And to manufacture these things in the quantities that Apple needs them, they have numerous factories of anywhere from a hundred thousand to 300,000 people. And the people who work at the factories live there. The factories are all-inclusive. They are residential, have hospitals, parks, and they run 24/7. \nWe don't have anything like that in America. It's all been, I don't want to say farmed out, but it's the stuff that American manufacturing doesn't do. So, anyway, Trump on the campaign trail starts talking about jobs that have been shipped overseas, and he says he's gonna boycott Apple, and he has been, he's been using Samsung phones to tweet. Gonna boycott Apple until they're made in America, and everybody said it's not possible, including me, certainly not to shift the entire manufacturing load. \nSo I get up today and I read this and I see that the two manufacturers, Foxconn actually, has been told by Apple to look into establishing manufacturing centers in the United States for iPhones. Now, whether it happens or not, stop and think of what has happened here. Over the course of these many years since NAFTA, as manufacturing jobs have fled, we've been told it's the way of the world. We like buying cheap, quality products. And we can't manufacture those products with American labor and sell 'em at the same prices. \nAnd manufacturers also always want to sell at the lowest price they can while maintaining a significant profit margin, and competition forces you to do what you can to keep prices low. Apple's a little insulated from that because they've carved out a niche where they don't mind being the most expensive in the field. They don't mind being the most expensive smartphone, and they don't mind that people are willing to pay a little bit more for theirs than other people pay for other brands. \nBut even so, they're very, very cost conscious. So with just one claim by a candidate who's now become president, now look. Now something everybody, including me, thought no way, and somebody better tell Trump -- he may not know what all goes into making an iPhone and the supply chain -- look, folks, the number of parts, the number of products in a smartphone would blow you away. And it's not just the factories that are in China, but all of the manufacturers of all the parts are in China, Taiwan, Vietnam, they're all over there. And if you're at Foxconn and you need a shipment, say, of LTE modems, they're down the road. \nThe manufacturers, even if it's Qualcomm, manufacturing's over there, they're down the road. If you're manufacturing an iPhone in America, say San Diego, you'd have to bring back onshore a lot of the parts manufacturing as well. If you're gonna assemble them here, the parts are gonna have to be available. It would be a massive undertaking. But, anyway, the fact is that Apple is now, whether they mean it or not, acknowledging that they're looking into doing it. And they were not Trump supporters. Well, the executive team wasn't. I find the whole thing fascinating. It probably isn't gonna happen, but they nevertheless thought it wise to float the idea that they are looking into the possibility. \nEND TRANSCRIPT",

      "text": "Black Friday is fast approaching but, just like last year, [entity display=\"Apple\" type=\"organization\" subtype=\"company\" active=\"true\" activated=\"true\" deactivated=\"false\" key=\"apple\" ticker=\"AAPL\" exchange=\"NASDAQ\" natural_id=\"fred/company/280\"]Apple[/entity] isn’t playing ball. Thankfully Apple retailers are stepping up, however, so here is my guide to the best Black Friday deals and those you should treat with caution… Note: my thanks to BestBlackFriday.com which has worked with me to collate these deals and create order from the inevitable annual chaos Star Buys These are the standout deals for Apple kit on Black Friday 2016. Retailers are expected to set these deals live on Friday 25th November morning, but keep an eye on their websites because it is a long established tradition to let some deals loose early as a publicity win. [caption id=\"attachment_17203\" align=\"\" width=\"1200\"] There are standout deals on all iPhones this Black Friday. Image credit: Target via BestBlackFriday [/caption] Relevant retailers are highlighted in italics for each deal:\niPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus - get up to a $250 Best Buy Gift Card with an installment billing agreement with Verizon, Sprint, and AT&T t iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus - $0 Down + $250 Target Gift Card for well-qualified guests at Verizon, Sprint, and AT&T iPad Pro 9.7\" - starting at $449 (save $150.99) - Target iPad Air 2 (All Models) - $125 Off - Best Buy iPad Air 2 - from $274 (save $125.99) - Target t Apple Watch Series 2 38mm + $105 in Kohl 's Cash for $369 - This is the same price that other stores are selling the Apple Watch Series 2 for, but it also includes the $105 in Kohl's Cash, which is valid for a future purchase. Apple Watch Series 1 starting at $198 (save $71.99) - Target (this beats Best Buy’s Black Friday offer which is $219, more below) Read more - Walmart 'Black Friday' 2016 Deals: How Good Are They? Solid Deals While Star Buys can lead to impulse purchases, I would argue Solid Deals should only attract you if you’re already in the market for one of these devices. The Black Friday deals here are good, but not game changers: Apple Watch Series 2 starting at $369 - Best Buy Apple Watch Series 2 Nike+ starting at $369 - Best Buy Apple Watch Series 2 starting at $369.99 - Target iPhone 5s 16GB (Straight Talk) for $99 (save $50) - Walmart (an ageing model but it will still do a job at this price) Apple iPhone SE starting at $9.99/mo. for 24 months, 0% APR for qualified Verizon, Sprint, and AT&T customers - Best Buy Treat With Caution Not all Black Friday 2016 deals are worth pursuing. Here are some deals which may appear good on paper, but do not live up to their billing: Any iPhone - $0 Down + $250 Walmart Gift Card for qualifying AT&T Next or Verizon Payment (a good deal, but Target offers the same deal for AT&T, Verizon and Sprint) iPad Pro 9.7\" Tablet (All Models) for $125 Off - Best Buy (in isolation a decent deal, but Target is offering it for $150.99 off so avoid this) t Apple Watch Series 1 38mm + $75 in Kohl's Cash for $269 - More expensive than deals elsewhere so only for those really invested in Kohl's Cash. t Apple Watch Series 1 starting at $219 (save $50) - Best Buy (Target has this for $198, so you need to be a real Best Buy loyalist to choose this) t iPad Mini 2 starting at $199.79 (save $70.20) - Target t iPad Mini 2 32GB for $199 (save $70) - Walmart The iPad Mini 2 deals are flagged here because these are recycled deals from 2015. The iPad Mini 2 is also over three years old and I would not recommend it as a good investment at this stage. Apple will refresh the iPad lineup in early 2017 and software support for the iPad Mini 2 is unlikely to last much longer. ___ Follow Gordon on Twitter , Facebook and Google+ More On Forbes Apple Leak Reveals Massive New iPhone iPhone 7 Vs iPhone SE: What's The Difference? iPhone 7 Vs iPhone 6: What's The Difference? iPhone 7 Vs iPhone 7 Plus Review: Should You Upgrade?

Post to Facebook Report: Apple considering making iPhones in U.S. An iPhone \"Designed in California\" and made in the USA? It could happen soon.  //usat.ly/2fB7M2M   Join the Nation's Conversation   Report: Apple considering making iPhones in U.S. Eli Blumenthal , USA TODAY 6:13 p.m. EST November 17, 2016 A worker inspects an iPhone at a final assembly facility in Zhengzhou, China. (Photo: Apple) \nNEW YORK — An iPhone \"Designed in California\" and made in the USA? It could happen soon. \nApple asked Asian-based manufacturers Foxconn and Pegatron in June to explore the possibility of manufacturing the popular smartphone in the U.S., according to a report in financial magazine Nikkei Asian Review , citing unnamed people familiar with the matter. \nFoxconn agreed to look into the possibility though Pegatron declined over concerns that the cost of doing so would be too high, the report said. \nThe report comes one week after Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election. While on the campaign trail in January, then-candidate Trump warned he would try to force Apple into manufacturing its products in the U.S. \n“We’re going to get Apple to build their damn computers and things in this country instead of in other countries,” he told a crowd a Liberty University in Lynchburg, Va. Apple faces challenges from every flank \nThat isn't all. As a candidate, Trump also called for a boycott of Apple when it didn't cave to the FBI's request to hack the iPhone of one of the San Bernardino, Calif., shooters. \nApple declined to comment on the report, though it provided a statement about its efforts in the U.S. \n“Apple is responsible for creating more than 2 million jobs across the United States, from engineers, retail and call center employees to operations and delivery drivers,\" the company said, citing a jobs creation link on its website. \"We work with over 8,000 suppliers from coast to coast and are investing heavily in American jobs and innovation.” \nBringing iPhone manufacturing to the U.S. could be seen as a big win for the President-elect, though at exactly what cost remains to be seen. Market researcher IHS Markit said it costs roughly $225 to build the 32GB iPhone 7, the cheapest new model Apple makes. It retails for $649. \nAlthough it may not sound like a lot, the phone is $36.89 pricier than last year's iPhone 6S, and that is with IHS factoring in $5 for manufacturing costs. \nFoxconn has similarly expressed concerns over cost, including from chairman Terry Gou. One unnamed source told Nikkei magazine that \"making iPhones in the U.S. means the cost will more than double.\" \nThere is also the risk of Chinese push-back. Amid concerns over Trump vow to impose a 45% tax on all Chinese imports, Chinese state-backed paper Global Times published an op-ed saying China would respond \"tit-for-tat,\" and that \"US auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback.\" Trump's vague plans could reverberate in tech \nIf Apple does bring the iPhone to the U.S., it would not be the first product the company has manufactured domestically. \nWhile the company already builds a variety of parts for its iPhones, iPads, and Macs in the U.S., in 2013 the company notably announced that its updated Mac Pro computer would be assembled in the U.S. \nFollow Eli Blumenthal on Twitter @eliblumenthal CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE",

      "text": "Report: Apple considers building the iPhone in the U.S. Report: Apple considers building the iPhone in the U.S. Posted: Tags : iOS - iOS + Apple - Apple + During the primary season that led up to the recent election of Donald Trump as president, the billionaire real estate developer and reality television star had some rough words for Apple. Besides trying to start a boycott of the company for its failure to unlock a terrorist's iPhone, Trump was upset at the tech titan for building its products overseas . Trump had floated the idea of a 35% tax on imported products made outside of the U.S. A Trump administration, said The Donald, would force Apple \"to build their damn computers in this country instead of other countries.\"Today, a story in the Nikkei Asian Review cited an anonymous source for its report that Apple is investigating the possibility of manufacturing the iPhone in the states. Apple allegedly spoke with Foxconn and Pegatron, the two contract manufacturers it uses to build its smartphones and tablets. Apple allegedly brought the idea of moving production to the attention of the two companies back in June. That was five months after Trump originally made his comments about Apple's overseas device production, but five months prior to his election.According to the source, Foxconn agreed to help Apple come up with a plan to move iPhone production to the U.S. Pegatron, on the other hand, refused to get involved because the cost would be prohibitive.The source told the publication that moving iPhone production to the U.S. would more than double the cost of making the device. One of the problems facing Apple is that not all of the components for the iPhone can be produced in the U.S. The report added that the Taiwan based supply chain believes that Trump will force Apple to make a certain percentage of iPhone components in the states.",

      "text": "Technically Incorrect offers a slightly twisted take on the tech that's taken over our lives.\nEnlarge Image The MacBook Pro. Waiting for your light bulb to explode.\nPhoto by Apple/YouTube screenshot by Chris Matyszczyk/CNET Recent political thought has shown us that one of the best ways of selling is to say it loud, say it extravagantly and people will believe you.\nThe truth, in all this, can hang. It's all about the simple words and the uplift.\nApple might be following this in its new ad for the MacBook Pro . It enjoys all the sprawling opulence of Trump Tower.\nThe music suggests that this is less a computer ad, but more a race to the very pinnacle of human thought.\nHere we have light bulbs bursting. Not one, not ten, but hundreds and hundreds.\nWe see images of some of the greatest ideas ever conceived (light bulbs? geddit?). Such as fire, writing and the Apple Newton . Actually, it's not quite the Apple Newton. It's the Apple falling on Sir Isaac Newton's head. But this is hyperbole. Very high perbole.\nThe motorbike, the magnifying glass and the toilet roll all make a fleeting appearance in these 90 seconds. So do the television and the paper clip. Oh, and the drone. Yes, there's a little wit here. After all, the great Tamagotchi makes an appearance.\nWhat's the point of all this? Well, could all these things have been invented on a MacBook Pro? No, it's that the MacBook Pro has been meticulously constructed to help you create the next great idea.\nMore Technically Incorrect Stephen Hawking sets time limit for mankind New Balance official shoe of white people, say neo-Nazis 'Post-truth' declared word of the year Like the TV that takes pictures of you watching it. Or the robot that runs for Congress and actually does something when it gets there.\n\"Ideas push the world forward,\" says the ad. \"Introducing a tool for all the ideas to come.\"\nI struggle a little with all this noise.\nHere's a computer that doesn't seem drastically different from the last MacBook, one that demands you buy a whole array of dongles in order to use it and one that costs rather more than the computer it's supposed to replace. This is somehow being shoehorned into a litany of the world's greatest ideas.\nI am happy to concede, though, that the Tamagotchi did indeed push the world forward. Into a well of Pokemon Go -induced numbness, that is.",

      "text": "50 shares \nFor the iPhone 6 Plus owner, a flickering gray bar atop the screen could only mean one thing: the dreaded ‘Touch Disease.’ For those affected, this issue often presented itself gradually, becoming worse over time. Eventually, the screen would lose responsiveness or stop working altogether. \nThe problem stems from a shoddy controller chip soldered to the logic board. iFixit, and dozens of others all agree it’s a design flaw, and that Apple is responsible. We reported as much back in August and even pointed readers to a class action lawsuit filed in response to the problem. \nUntil now, Apple has been unwilling to work with iPhone owners affected unless the phone was still under warranty. Being two-generations-old now, few were. For those that didn’t have AppleCare on the device, they were just out of luck. \nToday, Apple revealed its plan to offer a reduced-price repair for affected iPhone 6 Plus devices. Apple is, however, foregoing any responsibility for the iPhone 6. Even though the 6 features the same complaints of a flickering gray bar, Apple’s data points to this primarily being an issue with the Plus model. Sorry guys. \nWorse, the repair will still run you $149, half what the repair normally costs. Generous by Apple’s standards but still, you’re paying out of pocket for what many believe to be a design flaw. \nFor its part, Apple suggests the entire ordeal isn’t due to flawed design. Instead, it argues the issue is due to being ‘dropped multiple times on a hard surface and then incurring further stress on the device.’ Put simply, you’re either dropping the phone regulary or applying too much pressure to the touchscreen and thus damaging critical components, at least according to Apple.",

      "text": "The jet black iPhone 7 made headlines following its release in September. Now, Apple might have another design up its sleeve: Rumors suggest the company is preparing to unveil a jet white iPhone 7 in the near future.\nThe report comes by way of Japanese Apple blog M ac Otakara , who refers to it as \"pure white\" (others are sticking with \"jet white\" ). While the site does have a knack for accurately predicting Apple's dealings (it foresaw the elimination of the headphone jack ), it did warn that the information provided \"might not be credible.\" Nevertheless, Mac Otakara cites \"supplier parties,\" though these sources did not indicate a potential release date.\nThe iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus may be seeing a \"Jet White\" option. https://t.co/EePAs5HeO6\nhttps://pbs.twimg.com/media/CwzdLXRVIAESsS-.jpg:large Despite the lack of conclusive evidence, a jet white iPhone 7 isn't out of the realm of possibility. The jet black model was absurdly successful, almost instantly selling out in stores and delaying online shipping time for weeks . Even at the time of writing, Apple's website says the jet black iPhone 7 Plus won't ship for another 3-4 weeks. Perhaps Apple is planning on capitalizing on consumer demand with a similarly shiny new color.\nRight now, the iPhone 7 is available in five colors, including matte black. Fortune points out that the prospective white option could implement the ceramic material used in the Apple Watch Series 2. As with all iPhone rumors, however, this report must be taken with a grain of salt. Mic will update you if the jet white iPhone 7 comes to fruition.",

(Reuters) iPhones may soon be made in US as Apple has asked Foxconn and Pegatron to look into this possibility, reports said.\nAccording to Nikkei Asian Review, key Apple assembler Hon Hai Precision Industry, also known as Foxconn Technology Group, has been studying the possibility of moving iPhone production to the US.\n“Apple asked both Foxconn and Pegatron, the two iPhone assemblers, in June to look into making iPhones in the US Foxconn complied, while Pegatron declined to formulate such a plan due to cost concerns,” sources said.\nBut the sources have said that making of iPhones in the US will cost will more than double.\nThe general perception among Americans that they are losing manufacturing jobs to other countries overlaps the Apple’s ‘rumoured’ prospect move.\nPresident-elect, Donald Trump referred to Apple multiple times during his campaign and vowed to slap a 45 per cent tariff on goods made in China.\n“We’re going to get Apple to build their damn computers and things in this country instead of in other countries,” Trump said at Liberty University in Virginia in January.\nApple’s Chief Executive Tim Cook was Quote: d by CBS’ 60 Minutes programme in December 2015 that America simply did not have enough skilled workers for the production of iPhones.\n“To make iPhones, there will need to be a cluster of suppliers in the same place, which the US does not have at the moment. Even if Trump imposes a 45 per cent tariff, it is still possible that manufacturers will decide to continue production overseas as long as the costs together with the tariffs are lower than the amount they need to spend on building and running production lines in the US,” sources familiar with the iPhone production process were Quote: d by Nikkei Asian Review.\nSources said that to make iPhones, America will need US government to subsidise local companies for domestic productions.",

      "text": "Apple working on augmented reality features for the iOS camera app Apple working on augmented reality features for the iOS camera app Posted: Tags : iOS - iOS + Business Insider reports that Apple is working on integrating augmented reality technology inside the iOS camera app. It is said the effort involves teams from several companies acquired by Apple, such as Metaio and Flyby Media. The goal is to be able to point the camera at a real-world object, be it an inanimate one or a person's face, and have it recognized and manipulated.Apple has already featured face recognition technology into the most recent version of its Photos gallery and editing app. In 2015, it also purchased FaceShift, a company whose developments are dedicated to digital facial transformation.As the AR functionality is incorporated into the iOS camera app, Apple will open them up for app developers by turning them into an SDK. The features could be realized in the next version of iOS, which is expected to be widely available in September next year.Some smartphone makers have already experimented with integrating AR functionality inside the camera app. For example, Sony's high-end Xperia smartphones let users superimpose animated 3D objects, such as dinosaurs, inside their photos, which is an entertaining, but hardly essential feature. Apple's plans probably stretch beyond such basic implementations.",

A camera without a lens? Hitachi is on it 0 Share: Enlarge Image Photo by N-Photo Magazine \nIf you thought Apple making an iPhone without a headphone jack was wild, wait until you hear this. \nHitachi is working on building cameras that don't have lenses. Instead, the company claims, pictures taken with the camera will be refocused after being captured. \nSimilar to Apple's claim that taking out the headphone jack allows for bigger batteries and other parts to be put in, Hitachi says cameras that use this lensless tech will be considerably slimmer and lighter. \nLensless cameras are possible thanks to a pattern development technique called \"Moiré fringes\" -- you can find the company's explanation, rife with technical mumbo jumbo, here . Hitachi is planning on making cameras that use this technology by 2018. \nThe company also hopes to utilise lensless photography in automated driving, vehicles and robotics. With surveillance tech such as CCTV, faces of people are often blurred due to low focal ranges. With Hitachi's lensless camera tech, for instance, still images could theoretically be adjusted on the fly from a range of depths to identify people more clearly.",

      "text": "Continue reading the main story Share This Page Continue reading the main story Photo Credit Brian Rea When you are raised to be a good Christian girl, you don’t just go to church; you date the church. Church is the significant other with whom you spend weekends and evenings, the boyfriend whose friends become your friends, the girlfriend with whom you share all your dreams.\nI was a really good Christian girl, so I didn’t just date the church; I married it.\nAfter graduating from a Midwestern college whose motto is “For Christ and His Kingdom,” I moved to New York City. It was my first time out of the evangelical cocoon, and my priority was finding a church I could love, commit my life to, and make my spiritual and social center.\nMy search ended in Brooklyn, where I found a church of young creative people and fledgling professionals who, like me, were looking for a faith less burdened by fundamentalism. We forged a quick camaraderie, including with our pastor, who was as much friend and peer as spiritual leader. We hung out in the pews on Sundays, but also in bars and each other’s living rooms throughout the week.\nSoon this congregation became my beloved. I took my membership vows and began leading a Bible study, teaching Sunday school, attending weekly planning meetings and signing up for countless other duties. I committed to this church with the vigor and joy of a new bride.\nContinue reading the main story Advertisement\nContinue reading the main story Like most single women in my position, my next priority was finding a husband in this church. There is a motif of love triangles in Christianity. Like the love of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, Evangelicalism 101 also teaches the holy trinity of matrimony: man, woman, church. So I scanned the pews each week looking for someone with an unadorned ring finger.\nOne Sunday, I noticed a new woman in a suede jacket, her short dark hair tucked under a brimmed hat. Our conversation was unremarkable, and yet I was captivated. I tossed out the most evangelical invite: “Do you want to come to my Bible study?”\nShe did. Then she came over for dinner. Then she began sleeping on my couch. We met for coffee and whiskey and eventually lost track of who paid for each other’s tabs. I convinced her that biking in New York wasn’t too hazardous, so she bought a bicycle on Craigslist.\nNYT Living Newsletter Get lifestyle news from the Style, Travel and Food sections, from the latest trends to news you can use.\nSign-up for free NYT Newsletters Morning Briefing Subscribed News to start your day, weekdays Opinion Today Subscribed Thought-provoking commentary, weekdays Cooking Subscribed Delicious recipes and more, 5 times a week Race/Related Subscribed A provocative exploration of race, biweekly Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.\nInvalid email address.

Privacy Policy When she crashed — twice! — we went back to my apartment, where I cleaned pebbles out of her skin and bandaged her ankle. Then we unknowingly went to a museum exhibition featuring gay and lesbian art, and I was forced to think about us. But I wouldn’t let myself acknowledge what was so painfully obvious.\nOver the following months, however, as Jess began stashing extra shoes in my closet and bringing home groceries to expand my diet of frozen burritos, I couldn’t deny that I was falling in love. And with that realization, I fell off cloud nine and stared into the fires of hell.\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story I finally came out to myself. Then I scrambled right back in. At stake was my soul and identity, my entire worldview and spiritual cosmology, my relationships with friends, family, God. That holy trinity of husband, wife and church haunted me even as it slipped out of reach.\nIt was a crisis of eternal proportions. I fell deep into an inferno of shame and panic. My fear of hell shut down any capacity to imagine a future with Jess. I repented of what Christians call my “struggle with same-sex attraction,” but still I found incomparable delight in her. I read countless books on homosexuality, and yet clarity escaped me. Fighting for solace, I convinced myself that Jess and I were just friends.\nThat worked until one night when we went to the ballet, and I kissed her, and she told me she loved me. For the first time, I felt complete, loved, known. Lying beside her healed my past and present self. It also confirmed my worst fears. I woke up terrified. I needed to kick Jess out and end things with her immediately.\nBut first, we had to go to brunch. It was the kind of brunch we couldn’t skip: a going-away celebration for a good friend.\nWe barely endured the long mimosas and eggs Benedicts as we contemplated our catastrophically changed lives à la Adam and Eve postfruit, full guilt. Finally, the check was squared, and we left to confront the reality of us.\nAs we walked, Jess noticed a distraught homeless man standing in traffic. Never one to ignore a person in need, she called him over to the sidewalk, where he began to share his story of the wounds life had inflicted upon him. Jess listened patiently. I stood aloof and awkward while she offered to buy him lunch.\nWhen they exited a nearby bodega, the man had a bag of food, a hot coffee and something like a smile on his face.\n“How much?” the man asked.\n“Oh, nothing. It’s a gift.”\n“How much?” the man insisted.\n“O.K., well,” Jess hesitated. “A dollar.”\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story He reached into his jacket and pulled out a coin purse, counting out four quarters and placing them in Jess’s hand. Then he left.\nJess looked at the quarters. “These are the most valuable things anyone has ever given me,” she said. “I don’t even know what to do with them.”\nFor most of my life, I had been given a slew of definitions around love and relationships that were easy to verify with Scripture, just as a flat Earth was once confirmed by looking at the horizon. But watching Jess interact with this man, I saw a new horizon, one that was more complicated.\nIn Jess, I saw the love Jesus preached, one unconstrained by conditions and extended to everyone, especially the forgotten, the stranger. Jesus never mentioned homosexuality. His cosmology was not studded with creeds, crimes and contempt; its essence was loving the marginalized. Every fiber of Jess’s being reflected this. She embodied the attributes Jesus was most passionate about: compassion, kindness, justice. How could loving someone who loved so well be wrong?\nI felt my cramped religious framework of false dichotomies and moral starkness beginning to collapse. What once seemed like a bleak choice between losing my soul or losing my most cherished friend was in fact a lesson that true love is the only thing that could save me.\nThere was still much turmoil ahead. Many people opposed our relationship and insisted that if we loved each other, we didn’t love God. Our pastor was one. We had first gone to him to confess what we then considered our sinful relationship. But over time, we discussed our evolved thinking with him, hoping that our years of faithfully serving the church would be our witness, and that our pastor — a friend — would agree to disagree where our theology diverged.\nInstead, he gave us an ultimatum: break up or lose our church memberships. Soon after, the church divorced us.\nLooking back through that messy love triangle between Jess, our church and me, I kept asking myself what Christ’s love required, and the refrain I kept hearing was “love your neighbor as yourself.” Jess didn’t usher me into only true romantic love, but also true agape love, showing me that the most foundational precept is the trinity of loving God and your neighbor as you love yourself. We eventually found a new church that champions this belief and embraces all people. I now have the joy of serving as an elder there.\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story Two years after our first kiss, Jess and I sneaked onto an empty Rhode Island beach. Only a few stars and a cloudy moon illuminated our running and jumping as we let freedom eradicate our shame. As our eyes adjusted to the darkness, we saw a lifeguard tower and clambered up. With the ocean at our feet and the horizon at eye level, we sat side by side in the night air.\n“Let’s write something,” Jess suggested, pulling out the journal we shared.\n“No, let’s just enjoy this,” I insisted. The moment seemed perfect as is.\n“Well, I’ll write something, and we can read it later.”\nJess scribbled and then handed me the open notebook, shining her phone’s flashlight on it. The light was a shocking intrusion upon our private darkness, so I asked her to turn it off.\nInstead, she pushed the journal into my hands. When I looked down, I saw a hole cut out in the middle of all the pages. Inside lay a ring.\nMy head spun. I waited for her to ask me those four fated words, but she was silent. The moment didn’t need words.\nI took the pen and wrote “yes” on the page.\nShe put the silver band on my finger and gave me a matching ring to place on hers. Then she asked if I remembered the homeless man we met that morning after brunch.\nI laughed. “Of course! Why?”\n“I figured out what to do with those quarters. They were melted into our rings. Fifty cents each.”",

      "text": "Apple Reportedly Exploring The Idea Of Making iPhones In The US  14 PST \nGiven that Donald Trump is pretty much going to be the next President of the United States, we can expect changes to be made as per his promises during the campaign. One of those changes is that Trump plans to bring back jobs to the US by making sure that American companies manufacture their products stateside. \nAs it stands it is cheaper to manufacture in countries such as China, and Apple is one of those companies who has used this to their advantage. However like we said, Trump winning the presidential race means that things will change, which is why it is not surprising to learn that Apple could be exploring the idea of bringing back manufacturing stateside . \nThis is according to a report from Nikkei in which they claim that Apple has spoken to their manufacturers about the possibility of setting up shop in the US. Foxconn is apparently on board with the idea, while Pegatron seems to be deadset against it. Given that Apple accounts for more than 50% of Foxconn’s sales, we guess the company doesn’t really have much of a choice. \nNow as to whether or not Apple actually decides to go through with their plan remains to be seen. It could simply be that Apple is preparing themselves for the possibility that they might have to start manufacturing more of their products stateside and that they are seeing what their options are. There is no guarantee that will happen, although we can only imagine that prices of Apple’s products will be going through the roof were that to happen. \nFiled in Apple > Cellphones > Rumors .

      "text": "Reddit \nApple’s new design book ‘Designed by Apple in California’ is now on sale for $199/$299 at Apple Stores in a handful of countries — and it has already become the joke of Stephen Colbert’s late night TV show. In the fake Apple ad, the video mixes real shots of the actual book and shots of mock Apple executives, creating a pretty hilarious parody. \nThe executives make jokes out of the book’s revolutionary sequential page design, the ‘touch page’ technology allowing users to simply swipe to navigate, and — of course — the $300 price point. \nThe amusing skit ends with a nod to the iPhone 7, “the new Apple book is the future and you know it’s the future because no headphone jack”. The IKEA Book spoof really has come full circle . \nFor those unaware, Apple announced a design book about the last twenty years of Apple products, from the 1998 iMac to the 2015 Apple Pencil. The book features 450 photos of iPhone, iPads, iPods, iMacs and Apple Watch across 300 pages and its published by Apple using gilded edges and custom inks. \nEntitled ‘Designed by Apple in California’, it comes in two sizes, small or large for $199 and $299, and is dedicated to Steve Jobs. See how Apple wants to present its new portfolio coffee table book with its official video from the other day.",

      "text": "Apple considers making iPhone in America, reports claim Donald Trump has said he will get Apple to make its products in the US Credit: AFP James Titcomb 18 November 2016 • 1:14pm \nA pple is exploring the idea of making iPhones in the US after Donald Trump’s victory in the presidential election raised the prospect of a crackdown on American companies that manufacture abroad. \nFoxconn, the Taiwanese electronics giant that assembles the iPhone at enormous facilities in China, has been told to study how feasible it would be to move production to the US, according to reports in Asia. \nMr Trump repeatedly criticised Apple on the campaign trail for making its products abroad and has threatened to slap import tariffs of 45pc on Chinese goods. “We're going to get Apple to build their damn computers and things in this country instead of in other countries,” he said in January. Workers at a Foxconn factory in China Credit: Reuters \nB eijing cautioned Mr Trump against a trade war this week, with the state-run Global Times newspaper warning of a retaliation that would see sales of US goods including iPhones cut off in China. \n“A batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by [France’s] Airbus. US auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and US soybean and maize imports will be halted,” it said. \nApple already assembles some high-end Mac computers in the US, but shifting the 200m iPhones it makes a year to the country would be a much more significant and costly undertaking. \nThe immediate impact of the switch could, however, be limited since the majority of the iPhone’s components are not made by Foxconn itself, but manufactured by suppliers and put together in China. The cost of an iPhone would rise if production was moved to the US Credit: David Rose/Telegraph \nE stimates have suggested that the cost of assembling the iPhone in the US would only increase the cost of making the device by around $30 (£24), much of it in additional transportation. \nThe Nikkei Asian Review reported that Apple had asked its two manufacturers, Foxconn and Pegatron, to assess the cost of US assembly in June - several months before the election - but that only Foxconn had complied. \nThe company may simply be assessing the measure to prove it would be prohibitively expensive, rather than seriously considering the matter. Apple did not comment. ",

      "text": "\nApple's iPhone supply chain manufacturers say sales of iPhone 7 will be ahead of iPhone 6s but are otherwise largely flat, say analysts Shawn Harrison and Gausia Chowdhury at Longbow Research. \nApple will grow iPhone sales by about 2.5%, Longbow believes, but there are caveats to that. \nFor obvious reasons, Longbow did not reveal who its sources were. They are likely employees or people with internal knowledge of Apple's OEMs, or \"original equipment manufacturers.\" Those are the companies who actually assemble iPhones, often in Asia, like Cirrus Logic (semiconductors) and MFLEX (circuit boards). Longbow published this list of companies that derive their revenues from Apple manufacturing contracts: \nLongbow Research \n\"All contacts see iPhone 7 volumes as slightly ahead of the iPhone 6s,\" said Harrison and Chowdhury in a recent note to investors . \n\"Contacts saw order upside during late CY3Q and during early CY4Q, particularly for the iPhone 7 Plus model, and are typically running at full capacity utilization. Contacts forecast at the midpoint 2.5% growth in orders vs. 2.0% previously.\" \nA worker in the Foxconn factory in Longhua, southern Guangdong province. Foxconn is one of Apple's suppliers. REUTERS/Bobby Yip \nThe pair published this list of quotes from their secret sources: \"iPhone 7 production will peak in October and November. It is benefiting from Samsung's incident.\" \"We are producing with our full capacity for Apple now and we did receive some extra iPhone 7 orders since October. Now our 4Q iPhone volume is almost 15% higher than expectations, and I think the order increase is mainly for iPhone 7 Plus.\" \"2H iPhone 7 volumes can reach over 78M, while total 2H iPhone volumes are up over 30% compared to 1H, but flat compared to last year.\" \"iPhone 7 Plus orders are above expectations and inventory levels are low. So, many Apple suppliers are busy expanding production lines.\" \"iPhone orders are about flat compared to last year.\" \"Total iPhone volume in 4Q is about 75M, but still below expectations and flat or even down compared to last year. I think iPhone 7 production peak season is almost over, and Apple may start to cut orders in late December.\" \"I heard Macbook order volume is quite large in 4Q, but still down compared to last year.\" \"Apple may start another round of pricing cuts in December on several Apple suppliers such as flexible PCB and panel suppliers, but the pricing cuts will not affect other competitive suppliers such as DRAM and NAND and chip suppliers such as TSMC.\" \"It is too early to say how Trump's policy changes will affect Apple's supply chain, but I think it is unrealistic to move the whole supply chain to the U.S.\" \nThe \"wild card\" in all of this is China. \niPhone sales to the Chinese now form about 30% of all Apple's smartphone revenues, according to UBS analyst Stephen Milunovich, and sales there tanked 30% in the last quarter . So in order for iPhone sales to grow, they most grow faster everywhere else to offset Apple's customer losses in China. \n\"If China units are down by 5% in F17, we think the rest of world (RoW) would need to grow 10% in order to reach our 6% unit estimate. This is not unreasonable given higher growth rates in prior cycles but is not a slam dunk, so our 6% growth is on the optimistic side,\" Milunovich said in a recent note. ",

      "text": "Stephen Colbert’s ‘The Late Show’ Has Jokes About the ‘Designed by Apple in California’ Picture Book Posted by Evan Selleck on Nov 18, 2016 | No Comments tweet \nSome products are more susceptible to parody than others, and of course Apple’s methodology for talking about new products make them an easy target. \nListening to Jony Ive talk about something like a new iPhone, for instance, can open up the parody opportunities, and a show like The Late Show with Stephen Colbert is mor than willing to take advantage of those openings. Throw in something like the “Designed by Apple in California” design picture book , which tops out at $300, and was launched earlier this week. \nIn the video, we see a variety of people talking up the new design book, noting its fantastic features like “touch page” technology, making it easier to turn those big pages with beautiful pictures of Apple products you “probably already have in your basement.” \nThere’s even a joke in there about the design book not having a headphone jack! \nYou can check out the video below.

Let’s Not Rush to Conclude, Says JP Morgan Following a report Wednesday by Nikkei Asian Review that Apple ( AAPL ) asked suppliers to look into the prospects of making an iPhone in the united States, J.P. Morgan ’s Rod Hall today writes that one shouldn’t rush to presume anything until President-elect Donald Trump actually starts to formulate some policy. The Nikkei piece, citing multiple unnamed sources, notes that Hon Hai Precision , for one, has been exploring whether its Foxconn Technology Group subsidiary could move production to the U.S., after Apple approached both Foxconn and assembler Pegatron .",

      "text": "Are You Going to Buy the ‘Designed by Apple in California’ Book? Posted by Evan Selleck on Nov 18, 2016 | No Comments tweet \nApple has been receiving a lot of flak recently, but it really started to pile on recently when they unveiled a coffee table picture book . \nThe company itself saw an opportunity to talk about, or, more accurately, show off 20 years of design work from the Cupertino-based company’s history. It’s a brand new, hardbound coffee table book the comes in two sizes, one bigger than the other, and it offers hundreds of pages showing off things like iPods, iPhones, Macs, and other Apple-branded products. \nFor a fan of Apple’s devices, a book like this, with big, beautiful and vibrant photos of the company’s devices, I can see this being a must-have product. Apple’s design history is certainly worth showing off, especially in the form of a coffee table book like this. At face value, in conception and, yes, even in execution, the “Designed By Apple In California” design book is pretty cool. \nBut then Apple ran itself into a wall when it unveiled the pricing for each version of the picture book. \nThe smaller option retails for $199. The bigger one is accompanied with a $299 price tag. \nCoffee table books can be pretty expensive, especially those that present original artwork. There are some pretty cheap options out there, too, of course, but right around the $100 mark seems to be the sweet spot. There are options out there that are more expensive than Apple’s $300 picture book, and some that are much cheaper. None of that should really be that surprising. \nAnd there is indeed something to be said about pricing reigning in demand. It’s probably a safe assumption that, had Apple priced these things at something like $75 and $100, or even $100 and $150, they would have flown off the shelves. Maybe they can avoid the parody videos, too , in the process. (Probably not.) \nSpiking up the price not only tempers demand, but it also does the very Apple thing of hoisting it onto a different pedestal all on its own. Apple’s not shy about its confidence — it never has been. But, just as we’ve seen with comments from executives following the launch of the new MacBook Pro lineup, there’s probably too far to go. \nI’m still personally laughing about the $300 picture book. It honestly just seems ridiculous to me. Not the concept of it, because like I said above I think it’s a good idea. But that price tag is silly. The $200 price tag for the smaller book is silly, too. Apple may think the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar is an $1,800 experience, and they could be right! But a picture book that offers a $300 experience? Come on now. \nHowever, there’s a market out there for this book. I have no doubt about that. And one would imagine that fans of Apple products, who are not strangers to paying for Apple’s experiences, are the target audience for a (picture) book like this. After all, it’s hard to imagine someone who hates Apple would fork over the cash to stare at pictures of their products. \nSo I’m curious: Are you the target audience for Apple’s new design book? Are you planning on buying one of these books? Either for yourself or as a gift for the holidays? Or does Apple’s pricing make it not an option? If Apple dropped the price, on either (or both!) option, would you reconsider? Like this post? Share it!",

      "text": "2 \nIs Apple still the same company Steve Jobs developed into one of the most innovative tech firms in the world? For the most part, this is still the case; however, Apple has gone through substantial changes related to their products and services in recent years. It might not seem like much has changed in the grand scheme, but looking back at the various products and new innovations, we can see how things have developed. Here are five trends that provide a glimpse at the way Apple is changing while maintaining its status as one of the most important firms in technology. Replacing Old Standards \nIn 2016, Apple delivered on its controversial promise to eliminate the standard headphone jack from the iPhone 7. Months later, Apple introduced the new MacBook Pro, which kept the 3.5 mm audio jack but eliminated many standard ports such as USB and HDMI. This radical decision is the company’s new way to force hardware buyers to adopt future standards that will improve user-experience. It’s definitely a risky move and only time will tell if it will pay off. Making Hardware that Lasts \nAlthough Apple continues to stick to a fast-paced product release schedule, the company is committed to manufacturing durable devices that users will enjoy for many years. Early versions of the iPhone and iPad were not as sturdy as they are these days. Apple wants users to be able to hold on to their devices for a few years before they start considering an upgrade. The idea is to have more than 10 percent of iPhone and iPad owners who keep their devices for more than three years. So while you may see sites that sell iPhone 6 models, getting cash for phones is often easier with newer models. Cutting Down on Innovation \nApple has been more interested in improving its existing products and services than on pushing its trademark innovation. This change is not exclusive to Apple though. Other hardware manufacturers are going through a period of diminished innovation, which can be explained by looking at all the advances made in terms of personal computing thus far in the 21st century. Refurbishing \nApple’s new iPhone refurbishing program is something the company had placed on hold for nearly a decade. Prior to November 2016, a few stores selling iPhones online offered devices refurbished by third-party technicians. Apple’s new program offers Certified Refurbished versions of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. Attracting Enterprise Customers \nHardware designed by Apple has traditionally attracted musicians, graphic artists, filmmakers, and educators. Once the company noticed that the iPhone was being used as a replacement for the Blackberry, a new effort to cater to corporate and enterprise users was born, and this can be appreciated in the new Apple iWork suite, which has been upgraded to include real-time collaboration. \nThe changes above are probably the beginning of a new era for Apple. Though it may be too early to tell the direction that the company will take in the next few decades, these changes show where they are headed.

      "text": "Report claims Apple is looking to bring iPhone manufacturing to the US Apple manufacturing partner Foxconn is investigating the move on Nov 18, 2016, 1:45 PM TechSpot \nOne of President-elect Trump’s pre-election promises was to make Apple manufacture its products on US soil instead of China. Now that the Republican is on his way to the White House, such a move could be possible - and it seems an Apple manufacturing partner has been preparing for it. \nAccording to Japanese website Nikkei Asian Review , Apple asked the two firms that assemble the iPhone - Foxconn and Pegatron - to look into assembling the devices in America back in June. Pegatron is said to have rejected the idea due to the increased costs, whereas Foxconn “has been studying the possibility” of opening US-based facilities. \n\"Apple asked both Foxconn and Pegatron, the two iPhone assemblers, in June to look into making iPhones in the U.S.,\" an anonymous source told the publication. \"Foxconn complied, while Pegatron declined to formulate such a plan due to cost concerns.\" \nIt had been suggested that moving production to the US would see the price of Apple products shoot up – the Nikkei’s source said \"making iPhones in the US means the cost will more than double.” The Wall Street Journal, meanwhile, recently outlined why Trump’s plan would be impractical, and wouldn’t necessarily create US jobs. \nHowever, some estimates claim that an iPhone assembled in the States would only cost about $30 extra, most of which would be a result of additional transportation expenses arising from shipping parts to the US. \nWith Apple’s orders making up half of all Foxconn’s business, it’s not surprising that the Taiwanese company is looking into the possibility of a move, rather than face losing Apple as a customer. But whether Trump really does \"get Apple to build their damn computers and things in this country instead of in other countries\" remains to be seen. \nEarlier this week, China promised to cut iPhone and US automobile sales in the country if Trump imposed his promised 45 percent tariff on imports from the Asian nation.

      "text": "A team of experts is working on augmented reality for Apple's camera app Specialists from several start-ups are involved in the project, rumours says Users could have access to futuristic spatial recognition and mapping Apple is also developing AR smart glasses for release in 2018 \nBy Harry Pettit For Mailonline \nPublished: 12:42 EST, 18 November 2016 | Updated: 12:50 EST, 18 November 2016 \nApple could soon be bringing augmented reality to its camera app. \nAccording to recent reports, the firm's goal for the project is to give users access to futuristic spatial recognition and mapping. \nUsing augmented reality (AR), Apple would use the iPhone’s advanced sensors to generate real-time views of the user’s surroundings while superimposing digital information. \nScroll down for video \nAugmented reality in Apple's camera could enrich a live view of a city street with a map for directions, facts about nearby buildings, or add an animated video game character to the scene. Pictured is an earlier patent Apple filed on the technology TIM COOK IS 'HIGH ON AR' \nAt a conference in July, Apple CEO Tim Cook provided some insight on the firm’s work in artificial intelligence and augmented reality. \nAugmented reality and artificial intelligence are often regarded as an uneasy fit for Apple, a hardware maker that tends not to embrace new technology until it matures. \nBut, raving about hit smartphone game Pokemon GO, Cook stressed that Apple is 'high on [augmented reality] for the long-run' and investing heavily. \nStill, the firm has remained tight-lipped about any possible developments. \nSpecialists from several AR start-ups are involved in the project, an anonymous expert told Business Insider. \nAugmented reality in Apple's camera could enrich a live view of a city street with a map for directions, facts about nearby buildings, or add an animated video game character to the scene. \nUsers could even be provided multiple views based on the angle of the device. \nThey may instead see an illustrated or schematic map view if the angle indicates the device is being pointed at the ground where there would be few objects of interest. \n'Apple wants consumers to be able to point the phone at a real-world object and have it be recognised,' the anonmyous expert told Business Insider. \nAlongside AR mapping, facial recognition and manipulation may be an additional goal for Apple, Business Insider reports. \nThis would allow users to apply Snapchat-style filters to their faces from the camera app. \nAugmented reality is an exploding area of technology in which digital imagery and information can be superimposed over the real world. \nUsers can point their phone at a real-world object and have it recognised by their device. \nAR technology was used in the popular mobile game Pokemon Go. \nThird party apps would also have access the iPhone's new augmented reality technology, if it were to go ahead, opening the door for a host of new AR apps. \n'Eventually,' the expert said, 'after the AR features are built into the iPhone camera app, Apple will release the technology behind them as an SDK for app developers.' \nUser may instead see an illustrated or schematic map view if the angle indicates the device is being pointed at the ground where there would be few objects of interest (pictured) THE POPULARITY OF AUGMENTED REALITY \nAugmented reality is an exploding area of technology in which digital imagery and information can be superimposed over the real world. \nUsers can point their phone at a real-world object and have it recognised by their device. \nAR technology was used in the popular mobile game Pokemon Go. \n'At that point, Apple will become a competitor to companies like Vuforia and Blippar.' \nBloomberg reported on Monday that Apple is also working on creating augmented reality smart glasses, possibly in addition to this AR project. \nGoogle, Microsoft, Facebook Snapchat and Apple are all racing to develop such a product. \nThe glasses would connect wirelessly to the phone and project images and data to the wearer. \nApple has recently hired expert John Border, specialist in head-mounted displays and plastic optics, hinting at a possible foray into smart glasses in the near future. \nApple's work on smart-glasses is still in its early stages, with no new product expected until at least 2018. \nIt would appear Apple is investing in an augmented reality camera app until then. \nApple is also working on creating augmeted reality smart glasses (pictured). These glasses would connect wirelessly to the phone and project images and data to the wearer \nSpeaking to Buzzfeed News , Tim Cook has previously suggested the firm may instead be focusing on augmented reality, explaining that technology should encourage human contact. This comes just months after the Apple CEO remarked that the firm is ‘high on AR’ \nOver the past few years, Apple has remained tight-lipped about its plans for future systems, the firm has made numerous moves in the direction of AR. \nThis includes the acquisition of PrimeSense in 2013 – the company responsible for the motion-capture system in the original Microsoft Kinect – and the hiring of numerous researchers with VR backgrounds. \nApple has previously used machine learning technology to develop basic object-recognition software into the photos app, which can read 2D objects. \nThe programme will scan your photos for objects and scenes and place them into categories of either 'people' or 'places'. \nBut the new augmented feature would be a big step up, with the camera capable of complex, real-time recognition of 3D objects too. \nBusiness Insider report Apple declined to comment, and at the time of writing Apple had not responded to MailOnline's request for comment. AUGMENTED REALITY MAPPING \nUsing augmented reality, Apple would use the iPhone’s advanced sensors to generate real-time views of the user’s surroundings with digital information superimposed. \nThe system could even overlay directional indicators to the live video stream, visualizing the course and any upcoming turns on the way to a given location, and letting the user know if they’re facing the wrong direction. \nIn some forms, the system would allow for users to see search results on top of the live video, even if these points are not viewable in real life, allowing them to visualize the way to more distant objects. \nAnd in another embodiment, the user could even be provided multiple display views based on the angle of the device. \nWhen held between 45 and 180 degrees relative to the ground, the augmented reality view may appear. \nBut, when held at a smaller angle, the user may instead see an illustrated or schematic map view. \nThe news follows on from a patent filed by Apple earlier this month for an augmented mapping system. \nThe firm was granted a patent for ‘Augmented reality maps’ November 8. \nThe patent was first filed in 2011 but has now been published by the US Patent and Trademark Office with minimal changes, Apple Insider reported. \nAccording to the document, it will use GPS, a digital compass, and an accelerometer to determine location, camera direction, and the device’s orientation. \nCombined with the device's on-board camera, this could give users an interactive mapping tool that incorporates their actual surroundings. \n‘By interpreting the data describing the surrounding areas, the device can determine what objects are presently being viewed on the display,’ the patent says. \n‘The device can further overlay information regarding the presently viewed objects, thus enhancing reality.’ \nThe patent came shortly after Tim Cook, speaking to Buzzfeed News, suggested the firm may be focusing on augmented reality, explaining that technology should encourage human contact. \nThe Apple CEO had previously remarked that the firm is ‘high on AR’ and raved about Pokémon Go. \n‘There’s no substitute for human contact,’ Cook said in an exclusive interview with Buzzfeed News. \n‘And so you want the technology to encourage that.’ \nAnd, according to Buzzfeed News, the Apple has been having meetings with immersive content companies, including Jaunt. \nThe firm’s latest handsets also feature what could be the means to support AR, with the iPhone 7 plus hosting a Wide Color display and two-camera system that can gather stereoscopic data and generate image depth maps, Buzzfeed reports. \n‘VR has some interesting applications, but I don’t think it’s a broad-based technology like AR,’ Cook told Buzzfeed. \n‘Augmented reality will take some time to get right, but I do think that it’s profound. We might…have a more productive conversation, if both of us have an AR experience standing here, right? \n‘And so I think that things like these are better when they’re incorporated withouta becoming a barrier to our talking. \n'You want the technology to amplify it, not be a barrier.’ \nWhen it launched, Pokémon Go was applauded for getting people out of their bedrooms and off their sofas, and walking or cycling in the real world. But the game has also had its fair share of issues, including causing thousands of road accidents Read more:",

      "text": "\nWhat are the best ways to set up and start using the Photos app on my Mac?\n\nApple's Photos for Mac have built upon the reliable foundations laid out by iPhoto and Photos for iOS to offer users like you a speedy and functional way to manage, edit, and share all their images (without any of the stress.)\nPlus, with the new Markup editor , you can really get creative with your memories and make something awesome!\nWhether this is your first time using a photo management app, you're upgrading from iPhoto, or you're exploring a non-Aperture or Lightroom avenue, here's what you need to know about Photos for OS Sierra.\nFollow along – we're more than happy to help!\nGetting started with Photos on the Mac \nThe first time you open Photos, you're shown an overview of what exactly the app will look like once you upload all your pictures, videos, and memories. You'll get a quick run-down of what you can expect.\n\nOne option with the Photos app is being able to make physical memories, like calendars, collages, mugs, and more, but they're only available in the US, Canada, Japan, and certain European and Asia Pacific countries.\n\nThe introduction will show you how you can organize and categorize your photos.\nShould you use iCloud Photo Library? From here, your path diverges a bit depending on whether you're new to photo management or a former iPhoto, Aperture, or Lightroom user.\nIf you're brand-new to managing photos on your Mac \nDo you have folders of unorganized images glaring at you from your desktop? Have you never used one of Apple's other Mac photo programs like iPhoto or Aperture? Photos makes it simple to get that content off your desktop and iPhone and into Photos on the Mac and in the cloud. Here's how to do it:\n\nOnce you've finished the initial setup process, you can get started by uploading your pictures and videos, or by taking a tour. If you are unfamiliar with Photos, then the tour is the best way to go!\n\n\nOnce you're finished the tour, you can go ahead and either...\nConnect a camera or memory card Drag pictures directly into Photos Choose import from the file menu Turn on iCloud Photo Library in Preferences \n... And just like that, you're good to start uploading photos!\nIf you're upgrading from iPhoto or Aperture \nApple announced in 2014 that it would no longer continue developing for iPhoto or Aperture, its older photo storage and editing programs for the Mac. Instead, the company launched Photos. If you've been resisting the transition, but have finally decided to switch to Photos on the Mac, it isn't as painful as you might thing.\nIf you only had a single iPhoto library on your Mac, it should upgrade automatically as soon as you open the Photos app. Your old iPhoto library will still remain if you need to use iPhoto for whatever reason, but changes made to those older images won't automatically sync to your new Photos library.\n\nIf you had multiple libraries on your machine, Photos will ask you to select which library you'd like to import. Unfortunately, you can't consolidate multiple libraries into a single Photos library — you have to pick which one you want to use. (If you need to do this, you can use Aperture first to consolidate libraries, then import that unified library into Photos.)\nHow to import multiple libraries into Photos on the Mac Time to adventure! \nOnce you've imported your first batch of photos or your initial library, then the fun really begins.\nYou can poke around the app yourself (don't forget to play with Markup!), or for more help with Photos on the Mac, you can check out our full Ultimate Guide below!\nPhotos for OS X Photos for OS X review Photos for OS X guide Photos for OS X FAQ Photos for OS X news hub Photos for OS X discussion iCloud Photo Library Photos for iOS ",

      "text": "By Tiernan Ray Following a report Wednesday by Nikkei Asian Review that Apple ( AAPL ) asked suppliers to look into the prospects of making an iPhone in the united States, J.P. Morgan ’s Rod Hall today writes that one shouldn’t rush to presume anything until President-elect Donald Trump actually starts to formulate some policy.\nThe Nikkei piece, citing multiple unnamed sources, notes that Hon Hai Precision , for one, has been exploring whether its Foxconn Technology Group subsidiary could move production to the U.S., after Apple approached both Foxconn and assembler Pegatron .\nThe article suggests Hon Hai chairman Terry Gou is not enthusiastic about what might be a jump in production costs in the U.S.\nWrites Hall,\nThough Donald Trump indicated he thought forcing Apple to move production to the US was a good idea, we note that many contradictory statements/Tweets/comments were made during the election. We doubt any of these is a particularly good indicator of policy; so, we await actual policy decisions in 2017 to make up our minds on what this means for Apple, etc. We do note that robotic manufacturing might not increase costs as much as is indicated in this article, but we understand the move to fully automated production has been difficult for other consumer electronics companies.\nApple shares today are up 10 cents at $110.05.",

Todd Rosenbluth of CFRA , scoured the changes made by American Funds during the recently-ended third quarter.\nManagers who wield more than $100 million in assets are required to file 13f reports with the SEC every quarter listing stocks they own, as well as the size and value of each stake.\nNotable changes, by American Funds during the three-month period ended Sept. 30 include a 28% increase in its stake in Exxon Mobil ( XOM) to 53 million shares. Also, the firm increased stakes in the oil patch equipment and services companies Schlumberger ( SLB ) and Halliburton ( HAL ) by 16% and 11%, respectively, in the September quarter.\nTechnology is American Funds largest sector. The firm raised its stake in Apple ( AAPL ) by 28% to 62 million, while its position in Intel ( INTC ) rose 7.7%.\nHowever, American Funds trimmed its position in Texas Instruments ( TXN ) by 7.7% to 162 million. The firm also lowered the share count for Costco Wholesale ( COST ), Kroger ( KR ) and Philip Morris International ( PM ), by 16%, 23% and 7.8%, respectively.",

      "text": "MacBook Pro review: The Touch Bar bridges the gap between iPad and Mac \nEarlier this week, Apple let go of Sal Soghoian , who was the company’s Product Manager of Automation Technologies—meaning he was responsible for AppleScript and Automator. The news about Soghoian, who worked at Apple for nearly 20 years, raised concern in the Mac community that Apple no longer was interested in automation features in macOS. \nMaybe the latest news from Apple will help ease the concerned. According to 9to5Mac , one of its readers sent an email to Apple Senior VP Craig Federighi about the future of macOS automation. The reader received the following response and forwarded it to 9to5Mac, which has verified the email: \nHi [redacted], \nWe have every intent to continue our support for the great automation technologies in macOS! Thanks for being an Apple customer! \n— craig \nAs you can see, the email lacks details. We don’t know a roadmap for AppleScript and Automator, nor do we have any insight as to how automation is being handled on the macOS team. As 9to5Mac notes, it’s possible that automation is in maintenance mode, a status of a feature that’s still supported but isn’t set to have any new features. \nWhy this matters: Automation features like AppleScript and Automator let users create scripts that can perform tasks. It’s especially handy for performing repetitive tasks. You can create a script and have macOS do all the work for you. iOS doesn’t have any automation features, so third-party solutions such as Workflow are used. It could be possible that if AppleScript and Automator aren’t upgraded in future macOS releases, third-party scripting tools will have to be considered.

      "title": "Here’s what companies like Google, Facebook and Apple lost when Trump’s win killed the Trans-Pacific Partnership",
      "text": "share Win McNamee / Getty The giant international trade deal known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership died last week . It was supposed to be the largest regional trade deal in history . The TPP itself was a massive 30-chapter lawbook that would have freed access to markets for things like car manufacturing, data storage, online commerce, intellectual property and medicines. Hoards of technology and media companies supported the trade deal. Google was pro TPP . As was Microsoft , Apple and Facebook. The Motion Picture Association of America supported it too. The deal would have allowed them to make it easier to store user data across borders, offer stricter copyright protections and clamp down on digital pirating. President-elect Donald Trump positioned his opposition to the trade deal as one of the defining issues of his campaign. He compared the TPP to the North American Free Trade Agreement of the 1990s that allowed U.S. manufacturers to move jobs to Mexico. President Obama, on the other hand, was betting on the trade accord to be a part of his foreign policy legacy, refocusing the American economy toward Asian countries and hedging against China’s growing power. But after Trump’s unexpected win, there are no hopes for the Republican majority Congress to ratify it. China, meanwhile, has a trade deal of its own the country is hoping to pass in the wake of the TPP’s failure. Now that deal is off the table, the large companies that supported it will have to go back to the foreign policy drawing board. Here’s what American technology companies would have gotten had the deal been finalized. The TPP’s e-commerce chapter included the world’s first set of international trade rules that would have barred governments from blocking how companies share data across national borders . The internet works by freely moving data across the world. It’s how an artist in Mexico is able to have a fanbase in the U.K. just by posting a video on YouTube. Now governments can impose laws on how data is ferried outside of their country, potentially blocking content and balkanizing the internet. On the flip side, technology companies cooperate with digital surveillance operations across borders too, and the TPP would have muddled the way countries would have been able to pass national privacy laws. In many of the participating countries it is not currently illegal to break the digital rights management, a digital lock that technology companies can add to their products to prevent piracy, tinkering and repair. But DRM is easy to circumvent, and hackers as well as media pirates have found ways to break to digital locks to make pirated copies of movies and music. In the U.S., it’s illegal to break DRM under copyright law, and the TPP would have expanded that internationally. Several countries would have had to make bans for repairing or tinkering with software or devices if DRM was circumvented, which would have been a win for the digital music and movie industry’s battle against piracy, as well as device manufacturers. Six of the twelve participating countries would have expanded their copyright terms an additional 20 years. Under the TPP, it would have taken over 70 years for a copyrighted work to enter the public domain, which is what happens when a song or film is so old that it’s legal to access it for free. Tech companies also were in favor of the TPP’s ban on “forced localization,” or laws that require a company to keep its citizens’ user data stored within its borders. Technology companies oppose these statutes on the grounds that they inhibit their increasingly cloud-based business models. When a country requires that data generated in the country stay stored within its borders, tech companies are forced to build data centers there in order to do business. Forced localization could also open a technology company or website to being compelled to follow a country’s censorship laws by dint of operating servers there. recode_divider",

      "text": "McLaren confirms talks were held with Apple 114 views By: Jonathan Noble , Formula 1 Editor 19/11/2016 09:18 McLaren has confirmed that it did hold talks with Apple earlier this year about a potential partnership, but the discussions never got as far as a bid being put on the table. \nSpeculation several months ago suggested that Apple had put together a takeover bid for McLaren , something that was denied at the time. \nHowever, in an interview with news agency Reuters, McLaren Automotive’s chairman Mike Flewitt has revealed exactly what happened. \n\"There wasn't a bid from Apple,\" said Flewitt. \"They visited. We talked. We talked about what they did. We talked about what we did. They toured. It never matured to a definitive proposition.” \nInterest in the future ownership of McLaren has accelerated in recent days, following a boardroom battle that resulted in the ousting of chairman Ron Dennis. \nA recent story by Sky suggested that the move to get rid of Dennis came after fellow shareholders – the Bahraini investment fund Mumtalakat and Mansour Ojjeh – rejected a takeover offer from Chinese investors. \nFlewitt confirmed that there had been interest from several parties about buying the team, but said the Bahrainis and Ojjeh were committed to keeping the current shareholding in place. \n\"There have been a number of bids,\" Flewitt said. \n\"I am comfortable with where our current shareholders are that they want to retain ownership of the company... They want to develop both companies. I genuinely believe they are very committed to them.”  ",

      "text": "apple iphone us manufacturing logo More Restoring thousands of manufacturing jobs to the United States’ struggling Rust Belt communities may have been one of the promises of Donald Trump’s campaign, but at least one major technology company is considering doing just that. According to the Nikkei Asian Review , iPhone maker Apple has begun exploring the possibility of moving smartphone production to the U.S.\nThe report, published on Friday, cites a source familiar with Apple’s plans. The Cupertino, California-based company has tasked Taiwanese tech firms Foxconn and Pegatron, which are responsible for assembling more than 200 million iPhones annually, to investigate the feasibility of assembling iPhones in the U.S.\nMore: Apple’s “touch disease” repair program for the iPhone 6 Plus is not free\nPegatron declined, citing logistical concerns. Foxconn agreed to begin compiling a report as soon as June, but company chairman Terry Gou warned that production costs would rise drastically as a result. An iPhone made in the U.S. could retail for as much as twice the going rate, or $1,300 for a 32GB iPhone 7 versus $650 today, some studies say. Other analysts theorize the retail cost could change as little as $80 – $90.\nApple has previously declined to move iPhones production stateside, citing costs.\nQuestion: Would you pay $80 more for your next iPhone if you knew it was Made in the USA?\n— Jeremy Kaplan (@SmashDawg) November 18, 2016\nA thorough report in the MIT Technology Review found that moving iPhone assembly to the U.S. would add $30 to $40 to the cost of an iPhone thanks to “transportation and logistics expenses [that] would arise from shipping parts.”\nMore: Superior silicon: How Apple is beating chipmakers at their own game\nManufacturing the smartphone’s hundreds of components domestically is an even pricier — and vastly more complex — proposition. Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook told CBS’ 60 Minutes in December 2015 that the U.S. labor pool lacked the skills necessary to carry out iPhone production, and Apple executives have estimated that it would take as long as nine months to recruit the roughly 8,700 industrial engineers that oversee Chinese assembly lines. Another stumbling block is efficiency: A 2012 CNN Money report noted that Chinese factories house workers in employee dormitories and “can send hundreds of thousands to the assembly lines at a moment’s notice.”\nThen there’s the U.S.’s lack of natural resources to consider. MIT Technology Review points out that few of the 75 elements required to manufacture the iPhone are available commercially in the U.S. Aluminum, for instance, requires bauxite, and there are no bauxite mines in the U.S. China produces 85 percent of the world’s rare earth metals.\nMore: Spendy but indispensable: Breaking down the full $650 cost of the iPhone 5\nFurther complicating matters is Apple’s sprawling supply chain of more than 750 firms in over 20 countries. Taiwan Semiconductor produces crucial iPhone chips; South Korea’s SK Hynix and Japan’s Toshiba produce the handset’s memory modules; and Japan’s Japan Display and Sharp provide the iPhone’s display. “To make iPhones, there will need to be a cluster of suppliers in the same place, which the U.S. does not have at the moment,” an industry executive familiar with iPhone production told economics blog NorthCrane .\nBut Apple’s plan isn’t without precedent. In 2013, Motorola Mobility employed more than 3,800 employees to assemble the Moto X, a flagship Android phone, at a factory in Fort Worth, Texas. Just a year later, though, it was forced to shutter production as a result of “exceptionally tough” market conditions, according to Motorola President Rick Osterloh. The company subsequently moved production to China.\nOthers have been more successful. Foxconn established a stateside iMac computer assembly line in 2012. A year later, Singapore-based Flextronics, manufacturer of Apple’s Mac Pro desktop computer, built a production line in Austin, Texas.\nMore: When will the iPhone use an OLED screen? Here are all the rumors\nIn October 2015, Sharp President Tai Jeng-wu suggested that if Apple were to begin producing smartphones in the U.S., it would likely follow suit. “We are now building a new [advanced organic light-emitting diode] facility in Japan. We can make [OLED panels] in the U.S. too,” he said. “If our key customer demands us to manufacture in the U.S., is it possible for us not to do so?”\nRead More News of Apple’s plan follows Trump’s victory in the presidential election. The president-elect has been a vocal supporter of U.S. companies that build their products in the U.S., and has proposed levying steep tariffs — potentially as high as 45 percent — on competing Chinese importers.\n“We’re going to get Apple to build their damn computers and things in this country instead of other countries,” Trump said in a speech in January. “How does it help us when they make it in China?”\nMore: Apple scales back production of iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, expects lower sales in 2016\nIn an opinion piece published in a state-backed newspaper, the Chinese government warned of retaliatory measures if such trade restrictions were to go into effect. “A batch of Beoing orders will be replaced by Airbus. U.S. auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and U.S. soybean and maize imports will be halted. China can also limit the number of Chinese students studying in the U.S.,” a Global Times article read.\nA move of production by Apple could also threaten the company’s relationship with Chinese leadership. Earlier this year, in what was widely seen as a protectionist move by regulators, Apple’s iBooks and iMovies were temporarily blocked within the country. And in June, China’s Beijing-based intellectual Property Office found that Apple’s iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus infringed on a design patent held by Chinese company Shenzhen Baili.\nApple has extended olive branches in recent months. The company invested $1 billion in China-based ridesharing app Didi Chuxing. It’ll open its first research and development facility in the country — a $45 million office within Beijing’s Zhongguancun Science Park — by the end of this year. And in October, it pledged to build a second facility in China’s Shenzhen province.\nMore: Apple planning a second research and development center in China\nEven if Apple were to move iPhone production to the U.S., it likely wouldn’t be enough to stem the country’s losses. Foxconn employed roughly 690,000 workers in China as of the end of April, down slightly from a peak of 1.3 million in 2012. The Economic Policy Institute, a U.S. think tank, estimated that the U.S. had lost five million manufacturing jobs between 2000 and 2014.\nBut politics may trump economics in the end. U.S. automaker Ford may prove the precursor of developments to come: On Friday, the company shelved plans to move production of its Lincoln crossover SUV from Kentucky to Mexico. “The Apple supply chain must treat Trump’s campaign pledge seriously and not write it off,” an industry executive told NorthCrane.\nChinese consumers complain about issues with Apple’s iPhone 6 and 6S Apple planning a second research and development center in China Apple's new China R&D center will open by the end of the year, develop hardware",

      "text": "E-mail \nWe already knew that Apple will likely use OLED displays for the upcoming iPhone 8, and it now looks like the rumors have been true. Bloomberg and its sources indicate that the next generation of iPhones will indeed feature an edge-to-edge OLED display, which would definitely help as far as battery life is concerned, not to mention that these screens offer richer colors when compared to other offerings. Apple will reportedly offer a lower-end iPhone 8 with an LCD screen, while the OLED variant will represent a premium offering. The OLED screens in question will probably be larger than 5 inches, which seems to be the norm nowadays anyway. \nScreens aside, the same sources point out that the iPhone 8 will be encased in a single piece of glass. This can be both a good thing and a bad thing depending on who you ask, but the important part to remember is that the home button at the front will not be a physical one but a virtual one placed under the glass. The iPhone 8 will be released as part of Apple’s 10th anniversary, and its edge-to-edge design and new display have a good chance to improve the company’s smartphone sales. \nAre you looking forward to the iPhone 8?",

      "text": "By : Jonathan Noble , Formula 1 Editor McLaren has confirmed that it did hold talks with Apple earlier this year about a potential partnership, but the discussions never got as far as a bid being put on the table. \nSpeculation several months ago suggested that Apple had put together a takeover bid for McLaren, something that was denied at the time. \nHowever, in an interview with news agency Reuters, McLaren Automotive’s chairman Mike Flewitt has revealed exactly what happened. \n\"There wasn't a bid from Apple,\" said Flewitt. \"They visited. We talked. We talked about what they did. We talked about what we did. They toured. It never matured to a definitive proposition.” \nInterest in the future ownership of McLaren has accelerated in recent days, following a boardroom battle that resulted in the ousting of chairman Ron Dennis. \nA recent story by Sky suggested that the move to get rid of Dennis came after fellow shareholders – the Bahraini investment fund Mumtalakat and Mansour Ojjeh – rejected a takeover offer from Chinese investors. \nFlewitt confirmed that there had been interest from several parties about buying the team, but said the Bahrainis and Ojjeh were committed to keeping the current shareholding in place. \n\"There have been a number of bids,\" Flewitt said. \n\"I am comfortable with where our current shareholders are that they want to retain ownership of the company... They want to develop both companies. I genuinely believe they are very committed to them.” Source: Be part of something big McLaren confirms talks with Apple About this article",

      "text": "\nScree on your iPhone 6 Plus no longer responding to touch? Apple has a new repair program — at a price.\nApple has launched a new repair program for iPhone 6 Plus owners who are experiencing problems using their Multi-Touch screens. \"Touch disease\" — a coined term some people use to describe the issue — has been known to cause several issues with iPhone 6 Plus screens including a gray flickering box at the top of the screen, trouble interacting with the screen, or even a complete failure of the touchscreen.\nApple 's statement on the new Multi-Touch Repair Program for iPhone 6 Plus is as follows:\n\"Apple has determined that some iPhone 6 Plus devices may exhibit display flickering or Multi-Touch issues after being dropped multiple times on a hard surface and then incurring further stress on the device. If your iPhone 6 Plus is exhibiting the symptoms noted above, is in working order, and the screen is not cracked or broken, Apple will repair your device for a service price of $149.\"\nIf you have an iPhone 6 Plus with AppleCare+, this won't affect you, but customers whose warranties have expired or never had a warranty, will not have to pay the standard repair price of $329. On top of that, if you already paid for a repair for this issue Apple is offering reimbursements.\n\"The reimbursement amount will equal the difference between the price you paid for the original service to your iPhone 6 Plus and the $149 service price.\"\nThis program is only for the iPhone 6 Plus and not any other models as of right now.

      "title": "Suppliers can't keep up with Apple's demand for OLED in iPhones",
      "text": "Apple Inc. has big plans to outfit its next iPhone with vibrant, energy-sipping organic LED displays, seeking to entice consumers with new technology that's already been embraced by other high-end smartphone makers.\nThe trouble is that the four main suppliers for such components won't have enough production capacity to make screens for all new iPhones next year, with constraints continuing into 2018, people familiar with the matter said, presenting a potential challenge for the Cupertino, California-based company.\nOLED screens are more difficult to produce, putting Apple at the mercy of suppliers that are still working to manufacture the displays in mass quantities, the people said. The four largest producers are Samsung Display Co., LG Display Co., Sharp Corp., and Japan Display Inc.\nWhile Samsung is on track to be the sole supplier for the new displays next year, the South Korean company may not be able to make enough due to low yield rates combined with increasing iPhone demand.\nThe supply constraints may force Apple to use OLED in just one version of the next-generation iPhone, push back adoption of the technology or cause other snags.\n\"Apple has already figured in there will be high demand for the OLED model and they've also figured out there will be constraints to these panels,\" said Dan Panzica, a supply chain analyst at IHS Markit. The combination of Apple's stringent quality requirements and the difficulty of producing OLED panels will likely lead to supply constraints, he said.\nApple plans to ship at least one new iPhone with an OLED screen next year, the 10th anniversary of the smartphone's debut, people with knowledge of the matter said. A pair of other new iPhone models will likely feature screens that use older LCD technology, partly because there won't be enough OLED displays to satisfy anticipated demand, according to KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.\n\"Display technology is still a pretty key driver of the purchasing experience,\" said Ben Bajarin, an analyst at Creative Strategies. Apple has previously used new display features as iPhone selling points. For example, the iPhone 4 in 2010 added Apple's first Retina Display, the iPhone 5 in 2012 introduced the iPhone's first display size increase, and the iPhone 6 in 2014 brought new 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch screen options.\nThe OLED iPhone, at least, will have a new look that extends glass from the display to the device's back and edges, according to a person familiar with Apple's plans. This all-glass design will have a virtual Home button embedded in an edge-to-edge screen, rather than a physical button that can be pressed, the person added.\nAn Apple spokeswoman declined to comment.\nApple typically introduces new technologies for its iPhones across all models when they're unveiled every September, as it did for 3D Touch and Apple Pay. Using different core, user-facing technology in the same iPhone generation would be an unusual step. All current iPhone 7 models have LCD screens. Still, Apple may have no choice.\nSharp and Japan Display are still working on test procedures for OLED screens and have said that they are on track for production in 2018, while seeking to manage expectations.\n\"There is all this talk about OLEDs, but I'm not at all sure about their future,\" Sharp President Tai Jeng Wu told reporters recently. \"We need to work on developing the technology, but whether we can succeed remains to be seen.\"\nShuji Aruga, president of Japan Display, said earlier this month that he sees a 50-50 split between OLEDs and LCDs that will be used in high-end phone screens. \"We are not yet at a stage where we can decisively choose between OLED and LCD,\" he said. \"We need to develop OLED capacity so that we are not caught empty-handed if the technology does end up capturing a majority.\"\nLG Display is the laggard. \"It's true that we were late in OLED investment for smaller electronics devices compared to that of televisions,\" LG Display Chief Executive Officer Han Sang-beom said earlier this year, adding that the company now understands OLED's importance for smartphones.\nApple and Samsung have an exclusive OLED supply deal for 2017, people with knowledge of the agreement said. Still, that doesn't guarantee the South Korean technology giant will have enough output to meet demand for the revamped iPhone. For example, Samsung's OLED supplies have even been constrained for its own mobile division's smartphones. A representative for Samsung Display declined to comment.\nApple's initial OLED order from Samsung is for 100 million units over one year, according to people familiar with the agreement. Even so, Samsung will probably only be able to deliver a portion of that for the 2017 holiday period. Apple shipped about 75 million iPhones in the 2015 holiday quarter, and some analysts estimate that as many as 90 million could be sold in the last three months of 2017.\nThe OLED screens ordered by Apple in the Samsung deal are for displays larger than 5 inches, a person familiar with the matter said. If Samsung sees supply constraints in its ramp up of OLED panels for the fall 2017 iPhone launch, Apple may not have another major provider to fall back on. That's why Apple usually has multiple suppliers for key components. For example, it has sourced LCD panels from all of the major Asia-based display makers. For next year, at least, it appears that OLED supply chain may be a single-company affair.\nApple has run into supply problems before, for example when it sought to adopt tough sapphire screens for the iPhone 6 in 2014. Even though it financed a sole supplier, GT Advanced Technologies Inc., to ramp up production and deliver the material, the manufacturer wasn't able to deliver enough sapphire glass of acceptable quality. As a result, Apple abandoned plans to use stronger screens, and GT Advanced ended up seeking bankruptcy protection.\n---\nBloomberg's Takashi Amano, Gao Yuan and Pavel Alpeyev contributed.\n  Business Technology Bloomberg",

      "text": "How Make a Dinner Reservation in Apple Maps By Conner Carey on Sat, 11/19/2016 \nWith iOS 10, Apple Maps can work with third-party apps to do all kinds of things including call an Uber, look at restaurant reviews with Yelp, and make dinner reservations with OpenTable. More apps will have extensions for use in Apple Maps as developers catch up. But you can make a dinner reservation in Apple Maps now. Let’s dive in; here’s how to make dinner reservations in Apple Maps. \nRelated: How to Avoid Toll Roads on Apple and Google Maps How to Set Up OpenTable for Making Dinner Reservations in Apple Maps \nTo make dinner reservations (or call an Uber or see reviews from Yelp), you’ll need to have the accompanying app downloaded on your iPhone. If you don’t already have OpenTable: \nOpen the App Store. \nSearch for the app. \nDownload OpenTable. \nOpen OpenTable and log in or create an account. If OpenTable has all your information, you don’t even need to open the app to make your dinner reservation. \nNow that you have the app, you have to turn on the extension for it within Settings. To do this: \nOpen the Settings app. \nScroll down to Extensions and toggle on OpenTable. How to Make Dinner Reservations in Apple Maps \nNow that OpenTable is set up to work with Maps, \nOpen the Maps app. \nIf you’re making reservations for a restaurant not in your area, search for the destination to bring up the map. \nFrom the map, tap on the restaurant you want to make reservations with. You can also search for a specific restaurant that you’re looking for. This brings up the information card for that restaurant. \nIf that restaurant supports OpenTable, you’ll see the option to select Reservations. If that option is not available, the restaurant either doesn’t accept reservations or isn’t set up with OpenTable. \nTo make the reservations once you’ve found a restaurant, tap Reservations. \nFrom here, you can choose what day and for how many your reserved table will be. Then select your time. \nTap Book with OpenTable. \nYou’ll see a confirmation page with the reservation information. \nIf you haven’t previously used or logged in to OpenTable, it may have you complete the reservation within the app the first time. But once OpenTable has all your information, you can make the dinner reservation within Apple Maps without ever leaving the app. \nTop image credit: Denys Prykhodov / Shutterstock.com Master your iPhone and iPad: Sign up here to get our FREE Tip of the Day delivered right to your inbox.

      "text": "Bonus Miles at Apple and Final Day for 5,000 Mile Bonuses! November 20, 2016 by Mommy Points Leave A Comment \nPlease note this site has financial relationships with American Express and this post may contain affiliate links. Read my Advertiser Disclosure policy here to learn more about my partners. \nToday is the last day to trigger the sitewide airline shopping bonuses of up to 3,000 – 5,000 bonus miles as outlined below, and if all I do this holiday season is help you earn more miles while shopping then I think I’m okay with that. So, not only do I want to offer that reminder that those sitewide bonuses are ending, but I also want to point out that there are a few increased retailers today in the American AAdvantage Shopping Site today, including Apple! Increased AAdvantage Retailer Mileage Payouts \nApple rarely goes above 1x miles per dollar, but today it is paying out at 3x American Airlines miles per dollar + the sitewide bonus of up to 5,000 miles, depending on your cumulative spending total. That is about as good as it gets from Apple in terms of earning airline miles for your iPhones, MacBooks, and more. American Girl 12x ShoeMall.com 14x Which Credit Card to Use at Apple? \nIf you have The Business Gold Rewards Card from American Express OPEN and have selected the category of “computer hardware, software, and cloud computing purchases made directly from select providers” as your 3x bonus category for the year then that 3x Membership Reward points earned for your Apple purchase would stack with the 3x American Airlines miles you earn by going through the AAdvantage shopping portal. Some folks like to use Apple gift cards they purchased at a bonus rate with a rewards credit card to make their Apple purchases, but I prefer to have the built-in protections that some credit cards provide in case your phone has a problem . Factor in Purchase Protection Benefits \nWhile we are on the topic of cell phones and purchase protection, it is worth a mention that the brand new Ink Preferred Business card has a cool benefit that provides up to $600 per claim worth of cell phone protection against covered theft or damage for you and your employees listed on your monthly cell phone bill when you pay it with that card – up to 3 claims in a 12 month period with a $100 deductible per claim. You would also then earn 3x points for paying your cell phone bill each month with the Ink Preferred Business Card. Final Day for Online Shopping Bonuses \nWhether you are shopping Apple.com or elsewhere, remember that the sitewide shopping bonuses from United, American, Southwest, and Alaska Airlines as detailed below are ending today. \nEarn a one-time bonus of the following amounts for eligible purchases made through the MileagePlus Shopping Mall from 10/31/16 – 11/20/16. 500 miles for qualifying purchases of at least $150 2,500 miles for qualifying purchases of at least $750 5,000 miles for qualifying purchases of $1,500 or more \nEarn a one-time bonus of the following amounts for eligible purchases made through the AAdvantage Shopping Mall from 10/31/16 – 11/20/16. 500 miles for qualifying purchases of at least $150 2,500 miles for qualifying purchases of at least $750 5,000 miles for qualifying purchases of $1,500 or more \nEarn a one-time bonus of the following amounts for eligible purchases made through the Alaska Mileage Plan Shopping Mall from 10/31/16 – 11/20/16. 500 miles for qualifying purchases of at least $150 1,500 miles for qualifying purchases of at least $500 3,000 miles for qualifying purchases of $1,000 or more \nEarn a one-time bonus of the following amounts for eligible purchases made through the Rapid Rewards Shopping Site from 11/07/16 – 11/20/16. 500 points for qualifying purchases of at least $150 1,000 points for qualifying purchases of at least $500 3,000 points for qualifying purchases of $1,000 or more Have you made use of any of the recent online shopping bonuses? \n\nEditorial Note: The opinions expressed here are mine and not provided, reviewed, by any bank, card issuer, or other company unless otherwise stated.",

And sure, maybe no one was shocked either, aside of course from the deluge of snarky Internet commenters who were quick to blast Apple for having the gall to release a book for $300.\nContinue reading... \nTrending right now: \nMicrosoft is offering major discounts on Xbox One games and consoles for Black Friday Today’s your last chance to get a NES Classic All the best pre-Black Friday deals you can buy right now at Walmart, Best Buy and Amazon ",

      "title": "iFixit criticizes Apple's iPhone 6 Plus multi-touch repair program",
      "text": "  First reports about problems with the touch screen on iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus models that came out in 2014 and suffered from Bendgate shortly after their launch started to appear last year already. Still it took Apple more than a year to offer an official response and acknowledge the problem, which they now did by starting a worldwide multi-touch repair program for the iPhone 6 Plus. Owners of such a model, who experience symptoms of touch disease like a grey bar at the top of the screen or a malfunctioning touch screen are now eligible for the repair program that will cost $149. If you had your iPhone 6 Plus fixed by an authorized service provider or Apple before, Apple will reimburse the difference in price you paid for the repair and the $149 service fee. However, iFixit and others are not happy with Apple's response to the problem. In an initial response, iFixit states , that the program only applies for the plus-model, but some regular iPhone 6 models have also been reported to suffer from the problem. iFixit also criticizes the fact, that Apple does not acknowledge the structural faults in the iPhone 6 hardware design. Instead Apple blames customers for having mistreated their phones in the past by saying that \"some iPhone 6 Plus devices may exhibit display flickering or Multi-Touch issues after being dropped multiple times on a hard surface and then incurring further stress on the device\". Some iPhone 6 models were never dropped and were always kept in cases but still suffered from touch disease, iFixit wrote in their statement and also said, that Apple Geniuses confirmed to them, that Apple does not actually repair the phones but merely exchange them. Some exchanged phones start to suffer from the same symptoms after a certain period of time. Instead of charging for the repair, iFixit recommends Apple to offer an extended warranty for both the iPhone 6 and the iPhone 6 Plus and repair the phones for free under that warranty.  ",

      "text": "Continue reading the main story At Apple’s sparkling new complex in northwest Austin, workers who are spread throughout seven limestone-and-glass buildings field about 8,000 customer tech-support calls a day, manage the company’s vast network of suppliers and figure out how to move around millions of iPhones a week to ensure they get into the hands of customers when they want them. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Employees here help run Apple’s iTunes music and app stores, handle the billions of dollars going in and out of the company’s American operations and continuously update the Maps software that is integral to iPhones and iPads. At another Austin location, about 500 engineers work on the chips that will run the next round of Apple’s products. The Austin campus — the company’s largest outside its headquarters in Cupertino, Calif. — offers plenty of perks, too. When employees are not working, they can lounge on chairs shaded from the Texas sun, dine at a two-story cafeteria that serves an abundance of food options, including barbecued ribs and banana-bread gelato, and visit a full-service medical clinic, which includes dentists, acupuncturists and a robot-assisted pharmacy. Although contractors at the Austin technical support call center earn as little as $14.50 an hour, equivalent to about $30,000 a year, many of them become permanent staff members, which means better pay, after the typical one-year contract is up. Experienced call center employees earn around $45,000 a year, plus generous benefits and small annual stock grants. Pay is even higher for more senior advisers and managers. Apple says that, excluding benefits and stock compensation, the average salary of its Austin employees, including management, is $77,000 a year. Apple declined to discuss its future expansion plans in Austin and in the United States. “Apple has created over two million jobs in the United States since the introduction of the iPhone nine years ago, including explosive growth in iOS developers, thousands of new supplier and manufacturing partners, and a 400 percent increase in our employee teams,” the company said in a statement. “We made the unique decision to keep and expand our contact centers for customers in the Americas in the United States, and Austin is home to many of those employees. We plan to continue to invest and grow across the U.S.” Last week, a reporter and photographer visited the Austin campus and interviewed more than a dozen workers, from managers to a prep cook on the kitchen staff. Apple’s public relations staff monitored some of the conversations, but others were unsupervised. Genny Lopez, who has a two-year associate’s degree and used to work as a bartender, joined Apple as a contractor handling tech support calls. She is now on staff, troubleshooting difficult customer problems. “You don’t need a crazy technical background to do this job,” Ms. Lopez said. “A lot of the training is getting really good at talking to people.” Apple prides itself on providing top-notch phone service in 26 languages — 12 are spoken at the Texas call center alone — and the people who handle the calls are expected to follow up on any problem that cannot be quickly resolved. During the recent visit, Stephanie Dumareille, a senior adviser on iOS issues who is fluent in English and Spanish, patiently answered questions from a customer who was worried about saving her résumé online and did not know whether she was using a Windows or a Mac computer. Photo Alan Marquis, who works on integrating Apple’s suppliers into the company’s production systems. Credit Tamir Kalifa for The New York Times Employees say that Apple encourages them to move within and across teams, and the company is instituting a formal program to allow workers to try a completely different role for six months to see it if suits them and the company. Brisa Carillo, who started out in the call center fresh out of college five years ago, now handles international payroll matters and is studying for her M.B.A. so she can move up the ranks of the finance department within Apple. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story The region’s economy has deep roots in technology and is home to a number of big tech employers, most notably Dell. Apple’s influence in the area extends beyond the people on its direct payroll. It has 350 suppliers in Texas alone. And about 3,400 construction workers helped build the Austin campus. Apple ensured that they all got paid at least $12 an hour. It also provided workers’ compensation insurance and safety training, and it allowed the monitoring of conditions by an outside labor group, the Workers Defense Project , which has been trying to improve safety and pay in Texas construction. “There is a high road, and Apple followed that path,” said Bo Delp, director of the Better Builder program at the Workers Defense Project. “It sent a pretty strong message to others in Austin.” A mile from its Austin campus, Apple is involved in manufacturing, through Flex, a global contract manufacturer. Flex assembles Apple’s Mac Pro desktop computers to meet the exact requirements of customers, who can choose among more than 4,000 combinations of features and hardware. Flex added about 2,000 jobs for the Apple project. Although Apple and Flex declined to discuss details of their arrangement, the assembly jobs start at $11 an hour and pay an average of about $30,000 a year, according to testimony by Flex officials in 2014, when they sought government aid for the expansion. Apple could in theory build more products in the United States through contractors like Flex. But the company and industrial experts say that would be very difficult and could easily add $100 to the final cost of an iPhone. China has built a whole ecosystem of suppliers for nearly every electronic part imaginable. Vast pools of trained labor make it easy to quickly scale production up or down to meet demand. Larger products, or ones that require more customizing, such as PCs, make more sense to build close to the final customer. “It’s easy to ship a phone, and it’s harder to ship a computer,” said Andy Tsay, a professor at Santa Clara University who has studied global manufacturing patterns. “And it’s harder still for cars and refrigerators.” \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Over time, the value of Apple’s business is shifting away from hardware like the iPhone and into software such as apps and services like Apple Music, Mr. Tsay said. And those jobs can be much better for workers. “There are fewer industrial accidents working in a call center,” he said. “There is probably more gender equity. And it’s probably better for customers, too.” Alan Marquis, a former Army officer who spent a couple of years streamlining processes on a manufacturer’s assembly line before joining Apple, now manages part of the complex software that integrates Apple’s suppliers into the company’s production systems. “Here, there’s a lot more openness and creativity,” he said. “In manufacturing, it’s a lot more widgets dropping off the line.” Mayor Steve Adler of Austin, a Democrat, does not sweat the details of the jobs companies create in his city. He is more concerned that the work pays enough — at least $20 an hour — to support the city’s middle class, which is being squeezed by rising home prices. Some of the new jobs, like those at the Austin chip factory owned by Samsung, Apple’s biggest rival in the smartphone business, will be in manufacturing. Others, like the ones Apple brings, will be in services. “The best kind of jobs are those that allow someone to continue to grow and climb the ladder,” Mr. Adler said. Asked about Apple’s lack of manufacturing in the United States, Ms. Lopez said: “The product that Apple builds here is us.”",

      "text": "A singularly ordinary person. Human. Philosopher. Software Programmer at Apple. Ho hum. 18 mins ago Donald Trump shows us extensive and important parts of our political processes are based on the assumption that leaders act ethically and responsibly. As a programmer, I believe “if the system won’t enforce your assumption, it will be shown to be untrue.” It is not illegal for a president elect to admonish comedy shows and complain about them. It is irresponsible for a president elect to be going against free speech and artistic expression especially when it’s benign. It is not illegal for a president to give top secret clearance to any family member and make her just an “advisor”, not a holder of any federal position. All of us have the inalienable right to free speech, to rail against Trump, but I’m sure he will stay firmly in the murky area between legal and illegal, ethical and unethical, responsible and reckless.",

      "text": "Apple, Palo Alto, Applied Materials Near Buy Points: Stocks To Watch (Investor's Business Daily) \nThanksgiving is a mere few days away, which means the unofficial countdown toward Christmas can begin. With that, investors can now also being the unofficial countdown to tracking holiday sales. \nJoanna Stern, a technology columnist for Wall Street Journal was a guest on CNBC's \"Squawk Alley\" to discuss Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) holiday expectations. \nAccording to Stern, Apple's Airpods could prove to be an excellent stocking-stuffer given its low cost — at least by Apple's standards — of $159. The only problem is that Apple delayed the release of the device, and it has yet to be seen if it will even be available in time for the holiday. Likely Not A Production Issue \nStern noted that it is likely Apple is facing some sort of technical issue with the Airpod , since if it was a production issue, the company could have at the very least released a limited number of devices to the market. \nFarhad Manjoo, a tech columnist with the New York Times, jumped in and said that not being able to sell the Airpods is not a huge problem, but still a problem nonetheless. \n\"It's sort of one of these accumulations of problems we have seen from Apple over the last couple of years.\" \nManjoo and Stern both agreed that the review model of the Airpod they received works just fine and are of good enough quality. © 2016 Benzinga.com.

      "title": "Apple debuts new Apple Music ad starring Drake as it ramps up marketing for holiday season",
      "text": "Reddit \nDuring the AMAs this evening, Apple debuted a new ad for Apple Music starring its long-time advocate , Drake. The ad is essentially a mirror of an ad that starred Taylor Swift and was released earlier this year . Apple has shared its new Drake ad on YouTube with the title “Drake vs. Bench Press.” \nIn the ad, Drake is seen lifting weights and listening Apple Music for his workout entertainment. The rapper uses the “Pop Workout” playlist, which presents him with Taylor Swift’s song “Bad Blood.” After dancing to the song for a while, Drake gets back to work, only to be so distracted by the music and singing along that he ends up dropping the bench press on his chest and rolling to the ground. \nApple, of course, released a similar ad starring Taylor Swift earlier this year, which saw the singer running on a treadmill and listening to Drake and Future’s song “Jumpman.” Swift, lost in the music, proceeded to fall face first into the treadmill. Apple re-uploaded this video to its YouTube channel tonight, as well. \nBoth ads end with the tagline “Distractingly good” and tout that there are over 40 million songs on the service and playlists suitable for every moment. \nAs we head into the holiday season, Apple has seemingly been ramping up its Apple Music advertising. The company has started displaying massive window signs in large, big box retailers around the world, including Best Buy. Apple Music subscriptions will likely be a hot gift item this year and Apple is surely trying to do everything it can to remind people of that. \nApple’s ads for its streaming music budget have been notoriously high budget, as well. In addition to the pieces starring Drake and Taylor Swift , Apple has also brought in celebrities like DJ Khaled and James Corden to promote the service, taking a different approach than it has traditionally used with its advertising. \nThe new Apple Music ad entitled “Drake vs. Bench Press” can be seen below. Let us know what you think of it in the comments. Additionally, be sure to let us know if you’ve seen any notable Apple Music signage out there lately, such as the Best Buy image below. Best Buy in Pensacola, first time I've seen one of these ads pic.twitter.com/u3Iiw5ENNj \n— Zac Hall (@apollozac) November 13, 2016 @apollozac saw something similar at a big electronics retailer here in Germany yesterday, too. Has Apple to push Music for some reason?",

But Apple says that this is not a safety issue and the number of iPhone 6s handsets affected are limited to a small range of phones produced in September and October 2015. Apple says that any iPhone 6s owner whose device is experiencing these shutdowns will be entitled to a free battery replacement.Apple says that iPhone 6s users around the world who are suffering with the random shutdown issue, can bring their phone into any Apple retail store or authorized service center. There, it will be determined whether a particular iPhone 6s was built during the time period that would make it eligible for the free battery replacement.The China Consumers Association , a consumer protection group in China, said last week that it has been receiving reports from owners of the Apple iPhone 6s that their phones have been shutting down, even though half of the battery life remained. Apple says that the problem affects iPhone 6s units around the world, so its promise to replace defective batteries covers iPhone 6s models owned globally. \"Apple has determined that a very small number of iPhone 6s devices may unexpectedly shut down. This isn't a safety issue and only affects devices within a limited serial number range that were manufactured in September and October 2015.\"-Apple Some Apple iPhone 6s units are shutting down randomly Popular galleries",

      "text": "Apple offers new battery for iPhone 6s phones that suddenly shut down Apple said the problem has been discovered in a few iPhone 6s smartphones Bangalore Correspondent, IDG News Service | November 20, 2016 Email a friend Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. \nApple's iPhone 6s Amazon Discounts Kindle E-Readers Up To $30 Through 11/28 - Deal Alert \nApple has said that a few iPhone 6s smartphones are unexpectedly shutting down, confirming a problem reported last week by a Chinese consumer protection group. \nThe company said the problem is restricted to a small number of phones within a limited serial number range that were manufactured between September and October last year. \nApple said it was not a safety issue, and appeared to suggest that the problem would be resolved by a replacement battery which the company offered free. It did not say how many iPhone 6s phones were affected and in which markets. \nThe China Consumers Association asked Apple to investigate problems with iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s phones that were automatically shutting off. The unexpected shutdowns were said to happen when the phone’s battery charge dropped to between 60 and 50 percent. \nThe battery replacement comes less than a week after Apple offered to repair for a reduced price of US$149 iPhone 6 Plus devices that had display flickering or multitouch issues. \nThat problem was called “touch disease” in August by repair guide website iFixit, as it was characterized by a gray, flickering bar at the top of the display and an unresponsive touchscreen . Those who had already fixed their phones for the issue were offered a refund on the difference in the cost. \nApple's wireless carrier partners are not participating in the battery replacement program for the iPhone 6s, so eligible users have to contact Apple retail stores, authorized service providers or technical support. Users have been advised to back up their data to iTunes or iCloud, turn off their 'Find My iPhone' facility, and erase all content and settings in preparation for the battery change. \n“If your iPhone 6s has any damage such as a cracked screen which impairs the replacement of the battery, that issue will need to be resolved prior to the battery replacement. In some cases, there may be a cost associated with the repair,” Apple said while announcing the program . \nUsers who believe their iPhone 6s phones was affected by the issue, and have already paid to replace the battery, can contact Apple about a refund, the company said.

      "text": "Apple offers new battery for iPhone 6s phones that suddenly shut down Apple said the problem has been discovered in a few iPhone 6s smartphones Bangalore Correspondent, IDG News Service | Nov 20, 2016 11:44 PM PT Email a friend Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. \nApple's iPhone 6s 10 tablets for under $500 \nApple has said that a few iPhone 6s smartphones are unexpectedly shutting down, confirming a problem reported last week by a Chinese consumer protection group. \nThe company said the problem is restricted to a small number of phones within a limited serial number range that were manufactured between September and October last year. \nApple said it was not a safety issue, and appeared to suggest that the problem would be resolved by a replacement battery which the company offered free. It did not say how many iPhone 6s phones were affected and in which markets. \nThe China Consumers Association asked Apple to investigate problems with iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s phones that were automatically shutting off. The unexpected shutdowns were said to happen when the phone’s battery charge dropped to between 60 and 50 percent. \nThe battery replacement comes less than a week after Apple offered to repair for a reduced price of US$149 iPhone 6 Plus devices that had display flickering or multitouch issues. \nThat problem was called “touch disease” in August by repair guide website iFixit, as it was characterized by a gray, flickering bar at the top of the display and an unresponsive touchscreen . Those who had already fixed their phones for the issue were offered a refund on the difference in the cost. \nApple's wireless carrier partners are not participating in the battery replacement program for the iPhone 6s, so eligible users have to contact Apple retail stores, authorized service providers or technical support. Users have been advised to back up their data to iTunes or iCloud, turn off their 'Find My iPhone' facility, and erase all content and settings in preparation for the battery change. \n“If your iPhone 6s has any damage such as a cracked screen which impairs the replacement of the battery, that issue will need to be resolved prior to the battery replacement. In some cases, there may be a cost associated with the repair,” Apple said while announcing the program . \nUsers who believe their iPhone 6s phones was affected by the issue, and have already paid to replace the battery, can contact Apple about a refund, the company said.
