(AP Photo/Matt Rourke) AP CVS Health's 3Q profit jumps, but revenue disappoints By LINDA A. JOHNSON AP Medical Writer Updated 49 min ago Matt Rourke \nThis Friday, Oct. 21, 2016, photo shows a CVS drugstore and pharmacy location in Philadelphia. CVS Health Corp.'s third-quarter profit jumped on a boost in prescription volume and higher retail sales, the company reported Tuesday, Nov. 8, 2016. (AP Photo/Matt Rourke) \nCVS Health Corp. missed Wall Street's revenue expectations in the third quarter, despite sales jumping due to acquisitions. The company trimmed its profit forecast for this year, triggering a stock sell-off. \nThe drugstore chain and pharmacy benefits manager also noted significant headwinds that forced it to reduce its 2016 profit forecast by a nickel per share. Those include a soft seasonal business, slowing prescription growth in the overall market and recent pharmacy network changes expected to reduce the number of prescriptions filled at its pharmacies this year. Those network changes will have a bigger effect in 2017, CVS predicted. \nIts shares fell $9.86, or 11.8 percent, to close at $73.53, with trading volume reaching nearly 10 times the daily average. \nThe operator of the second-largest U.S. drugstore chain reported a 23.5 percent boost in profit to $1.54 billion, or $1.43 per share. Earnings, adjusted for one-time gains and costs, were $1.64 per share, topping Wall Street forecasts of $1.57 per share. \nQuarterly revenue jumped 15.5 percent to $44.62 billion, getting a lift from a boost in prescription volume and higher retail sales at its drugstores. Still, that missed Street expectations for revenue of $45.31 billion. \nThe bulk of the revenue boost came from the CVS pharmacy benefits unit, with an increase of 19.2 percent to $4.9 billion. The key driver was a 23.3 percent surge in prescription claims processed, to a total of 282.6 million. \nThe retail and long-term care unit had a 12.5 percent revenue boost to $20.1 billion, mainly on operations within Omnicare, a provider of pharmacy services to nursing homes and other clients. CVS Health bought Omnicare in 2015. CVS also benefited from its December 2015 acquisition of the pharmacy business of retailer Target. \nFor the fourth quarter, CVS Health expects its per-share earnings to range from $1.64 to $1.70, well below the $1.79 analysts had forecast. \nThe Woonsocket, Rhode Island-based company expects full-year earnings in the range of $5.77 to $5.83 per share, down from prior guidance of $4.92 to $5. It did not provide a forecast for its revenue. \nThe company announced on Nov. 3 that it was cutting about 600 jobs — out of more than 240,000 nationwide — to streamline its operations. \nMeanwhile, CVS Health's two main competitors in the U.S. drugstore market, Walgreens and Rite Aid, are planning to team up in a $9.41 billion deal that is still being reviewed by federal regulators. That combination could create a drugstore chain with more than 12,700 U.S. locations, or far more than CVS Health operates. It now owns more than 9,600 drugstores globally, counting the Target business. \nThe company noted that its retail pharmacy market share increased more than 2 percentage points in the third quarter, to 23.8 percent. \nCVS also runs the country's second-largest pharmacy benefits manager, or PBM. PBMs run prescription drug plans for employers, insurers and other customers. They process mail-order prescriptions, handle bills for prescriptions filled at retail pharmacies and set up formularies that determine patient coverage and copayments for individual prescription drugs. \n\"While we expect a healthy increase in PBM operating profit growth in 2017, we expect a decrease in retail operating profit growth,\" CVS Chief Executive Larry Merlo said in a statement. \nThe company noted its board approved a new, multiyear share repurchase program worth up to $15 billion, on top of the $3.7 billion remaining under its December 2014 share buyback program. Companies typically buy back large numbers of shares to boost their stock price and mollify disappointed investors.",

But it seems investors only looked at the downside of the news. \nThe U.S. Defense Department's health care program Tricare is leaving the CVS network as well. \n  \nReproduction in whole or in part without permission is prohibited. \n© 2016 Charter Communications.

      "text": "CHICAGO — Walgreens’ recent partnerships with companies that manage prescription drug benefits are putting a serious dent in the business of one of its retail pharmacy competitors.\nCVS Health announced Tuesday that it expects to lose 40 million retail prescriptions next year because of new retail pharmacy networks that don’t include CVS, such as those created by Walgreens’ partnerships.\nThis year, Walgreens, headquartered in Chicago, formed partnerships with a number of pharmacy benefit managers, which are companies that manage prescription drug benefits for insurers and employers. Those partnerships make Walgreens a preferred pharmacy for people with certain health insurance plans, meaning medications for those customers are significantly cheaper at Walgreens and other in-network pharmacies than at drugstores that aren’t part of those networks.\nIn September, Express Scripts, the pharmacy benefit manager for the U.S. military’s health insurance program, announced that on Dec. 1 it would add Walgreens to the military health insurance program’s network and drop CVS. That means those with military health insurance, known as Tricare, will have to get their prescriptions at Walgreens or other in-network pharmacies starting Dec. 1 or pay significantly higher rates for them elsewhere.\n",

(AP Photo/Matt Rourke) AP CVS Health's 3Q profit jumps, but revenue disappoints By LINDA A. JOHNSON AP Medical Writer Updated ( … ) Matt Rourke \nThis Friday, Oct. 21, 2016, photo shows a CVS drugstore and pharmacy location in Philadelphia. CVS Health Corp.'s third-quarter profit jumped on a boost in prescription volume and higher retail sales, the company reported Tuesday, Nov. 8, 2016. (AP Photo/Matt Rourke) \nCVS Health Corp. missed Wall Street's revenue expectations in the third quarter, despite sales jumping due to acquisitions. The company trimmed its profit forecast for this year, triggering a stock sell-off. \nThe drugstore chain and pharmacy benefits manager also noted significant headwinds that forced it to reduce its 2016 profit forecast by a nickel per share. Those include a soft seasonal business, slowing prescription growth in the overall market and recent pharmacy network changes expected to reduce the number of prescriptions filled at its pharmacies this year. Those network changes will have a bigger effect in 2017, CVS predicted. \nIts shares fell $9.86, or 11.8 percent, to close at $73.53, with trading volume reaching nearly 10 times the daily average. \nThe operator of the second-largest U.S. drugstore chain reported a 23.5 percent boost in profit to $1.54 billion, or $1.43 per share. Earnings, adjusted for one-time gains and costs, were $1.64 per share, topping Wall Street forecasts of $1.57 per share. \nQuarterly revenue jumped 15.5 percent to $44.62 billion, getting a lift from a boost in prescription volume and higher retail sales at its drugstores. Still, that missed Street expectations for revenue of $45.31 billion. \nThe bulk of the revenue boost came from the CVS pharmacy benefits unit, with an increase of 19.2 percent to $4.9 billion. The key driver was a 23.3 percent surge in prescription claims processed, to a total of 282.6 million. \nThe retail and long-term care unit had a 12.5 percent revenue boost to $20.1 billion, mainly on operations within Omnicare, a provider of pharmacy services to nursing homes and other clients. CVS Health bought Omnicare in 2015. CVS also benefited from its December 2015 acquisition of the pharmacy business of retailer Target. \nFor the fourth quarter, CVS Health expects its per-share earnings to range from $1.64 to $1.70, well below the $1.79 analysts had forecast. \nThe Woonsocket, Rhode Island-based company expects full-year earnings in the range of $5.77 to $5.83 per share, down from prior guidance of $4.92 to $5. It did not provide a forecast for its revenue. \nThe company announced on Nov. 3 that it was cutting about 600 jobs — out of more than 240,000 nationwide — to streamline its operations. \nMeanwhile, CVS Health's two main competitors in the U.S. drugstore market, Walgreens and Rite Aid, are planning to team up in a $9.41 billion deal that is still being reviewed by federal regulators. That combination could create a drugstore chain with more than 12,700 U.S. locations, or far more than CVS Health operates. It now owns more than 9,600 drugstores globally, counting the Target business. \nThe company noted that its retail pharmacy market share increased more than 2 percentage points in the third quarter, to 23.8 percent. \nCVS also runs the country's second-largest pharmacy benefits manager, or PBM. PBMs run prescription drug plans for employers, insurers and other customers. They process mail-order prescriptions, handle bills for prescriptions filled at retail pharmacies and set up formularies that determine patient coverage and copayments for individual prescription drugs. \n\"While we expect a healthy increase in PBM operating profit growth in 2017, we expect a decrease in retail operating profit growth,\" CVS Chief Executive Larry Merlo said in a statement. \nThe company noted its board approved a new, multiyear share repurchase program worth up to $15 billion, on top of the $3.7 billion remaining under its December 2014 share buyback program. Companies typically buy back large numbers of shares to boost their stock price and mollify disappointed investors.",

      "text": "CVS' stock price plummets 12% following disappointing earnings forecasts Tuesday Nov 8, 2016 at 7:55 AM Nov 8, 2016 at 6:54 PM The company expects to lose more than 40 million retail prescriptions annually as two major insurers decide to exclude CVS from their pharmacy networks. Bloomberg \nWoonsocket-based CVS Health Corp.'s earnings forecasts for 2016 and 2017 came in below analysts' estimates as more prescriptions will be filled outside of its drugstores, sending the shares plunging Tuesday. \nCVS expects to lose more than 40 million retail prescriptions annually as the military's Tricare health insurance program and Prime Therapeutics, which manages drug benefits for many states' Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans, will exclude CVS from pharmacy networks, Chief Executive Officer Larry Merlo said on a quarterly conference call. \nThe report sent CVS stock skidding $9.86 a share, or 11.8 percent, to close at $73.53 a share. \nCVS is both a drugstore operator and pharmacy-benefit manager, negotiating prices with drugmakers for health insurers and companies that pay for drug coverage. Rivals such as Express Scripts Holding Co. and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. are cutting into CVS's retail pharmacy dominance by taking away some of the company's best business. \n\"While this earnings season has taught us in health care that gloom and doom is around every quarter, this was a shocking outcome for CVS despite materially lowered expectations,\" Ross Muken, an analyst with Evercore ISI who rates the shares buy, said in a note to clients. \nExpress Scripts said on Sept. 30 that starting in December, CVS pharmacies would be removed from the retail pharmacy network for Tricare, the military health insurance program. Prime Therapeutics said on Aug. 29 that a new alliance with Walgreens Boots made the CVS rival the core participant in Prime's national preferred pharmacy network, beginning Jan. 1, 2017. \nThe changes will take CVS's retail pharmacies \"entirely out of those networks,\" Merlo said on the conference call. CVS learned of them very recently, he said. \n\"We became aware of the network changes after the fact and were not given the opportunity to respond,\" he said. \nCVS has also seen continued compression of its profit margins, Merlo said on the call. The company is also \"currently experiencing slowing prescription growth in the overall market as well as a soft seasonal business,\" he said in the statement. \nAdjusted earnings for 2017 will be $5.77 to $5.93 a share, CVS said, compared with analysts' estimates of $6.53. In addition, the company announced a \"multi-year\" plan to buy back an additional $15 billion of its own stock. \nCVS' third-quarter earnings, excluding some items, were $1.64 a share, compared with the $1.57 average of analysts' estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The beat was partly from lower-than-expected taxes in the third-quarter. \nCVS has been bulking up in the past year, buying nursing-home pharmacy Omnicare Inc. at an announced enterprise value of $12.9 billion, and spending $1.9 billion to buy the pharmacy locations inside Target Corp. stores. Rivals are also getting bigger — Walgreens agreed last year to purchase Rite Aid Corp., in a move that would enlarge one of CVS's top competitors in the retail pharmacy market. \nRevenue at the drugstore and pharmacy benefits management company grew 15 percent, to $44.6 billion, helped by the acquisitions. Analysts had expected $45.3 billion. \nOther details from the third-quarter results: \nn Net income attributable to CVS rose 24 percent to $1.54 billion, or $1.43 a share, from $1.25 billion, or $1.11 a share, a year earlier. \nn Pharmacy same-store sales increased 3.4 percent. \nn Pharmacy front-of-store-retail sales declined 1 percent as fewer customers came to the stores. \nn The company lowered its full-year 2016 adjusted earnings forecast to $5.77 to $5.83 a share, down from the $5.81 to $5.89 projection the company gave in August. Analysts had predicted $5.85 a share. \nCVS announced Nov. 3 that it was cutting about 600 jobs, including 250 in Rhode Island, to streamline its operations. CVS Health employs more than 240,000 people nationwide and 7,600 in Rhode Island. About Us",

(AP Photo/Matt Rourke) AP CVS Health's 3Q profit jumps, but revenue disappoints By LINDA A. JOHNSON AP Medical Writer Updated 0 Matt Rourke \nThis Friday, Oct. 21, 2016, photo shows a CVS drugstore and pharmacy location in Philadelphia. CVS Health Corp.'s third-quarter profit jumped on a boost in prescription volume and higher retail sales, the company reported Tuesday, Nov. 8, 2016. (AP Photo/Matt Rourke) \nCVS Health Corp. missed Wall Street's revenue expectations in the third quarter, despite sales jumping due to acquisitions. The company trimmed its profit forecast for this year, triggering a stock sell-off. \nThe drugstore chain and pharmacy benefits manager also noted significant headwinds that forced it to reduce its 2016 profit forecast by a nickel per share. Those include a soft seasonal business, slowing prescription growth in the overall market and recent pharmacy network changes expected to reduce the number of prescriptions filled at its pharmacies this year. Those network changes will have a bigger effect in 2017, CVS predicted. \nIts shares fell $9.86, or 11.8 percent, to close at $73.53, with trading volume reaching nearly 10 times the daily average. \nThe operator of the second-largest U.S. drugstore chain reported a 23.5 percent boost in profit to $1.54 billion, or $1.43 per share. Earnings, adjusted for one-time gains and costs, were $1.64 per share, topping Wall Street forecasts of $1.57 per share. \nQuarterly revenue jumped 15.5 percent to $44.62 billion, getting a lift from a boost in prescription volume and higher retail sales at its drugstores. Still, that missed Street expectations for revenue of $45.31 billion. \nThe bulk of the revenue boost came from the CVS pharmacy benefits unit, with an increase of 19.2 percent to $4.9 billion. The key driver was a 23.3 percent surge in prescription claims processed, to a total of 282.6 million. \nThe retail and long-term care unit had a 12.5 percent revenue boost to $20.1 billion, mainly on operations within Omnicare, a provider of pharmacy services to nursing homes and other clients. CVS Health bought Omnicare in 2015. CVS also benefited from its December 2015 acquisition of the pharmacy business of retailer Target. \nFor the fourth quarter, CVS Health expects its per-share earnings to range from $1.64 to $1.70, well below the $1.79 analysts had forecast. \nThe Woonsocket, Rhode Island-based company expects full-year earnings in the range of $5.77 to $5.83 per share, down from prior guidance of $4.92 to $5. It did not provide a forecast for its revenue. \nThe company announced on Nov. 3 that it was cutting about 600 jobs — out of more than 240,000 nationwide — to streamline its operations. \nMeanwhile, CVS Health's two main competitors in the U.S. drugstore market, Walgreens and Rite Aid, are planning to team up in a $9.41 billion deal that is still being reviewed by federal regulators. That combination could create a drugstore chain with more than 12,700 U.S. locations, or far more than CVS Health operates. It now owns more than 9,600 drugstores globally, counting the Target business. \nThe company noted that its retail pharmacy market share increased more than 2 percentage points in the third quarter, to 23.8 percent. \nCVS also runs the country's second-largest pharmacy benefits manager, or PBM. PBMs run prescription drug plans for employers, insurers and other customers. They process mail-order prescriptions, handle bills for prescriptions filled at retail pharmacies and set up formularies that determine patient coverage and copayments for individual prescription drugs. \n\"While we expect a healthy increase in PBM operating profit growth in 2017, we expect a decrease in retail operating profit growth,\" CVS Chief Executive Larry Merlo said in a statement. \nThe company noted its board approved a new, multiyear share repurchase program worth up to $15 billion, on top of the $3.7 billion remaining under its December 2014 share buyback program. Companies typically buy back large numbers of shares to boost their stock price and mollify disappointed investors.",

      "text": "CVS Health Corporation ( CVS - Free Report ) reported third-quarter 2016 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.64, up 28.1% year over year. The adjustment considers certain asset amortization, acquisition-related integration costs and the loss incurred on early extinguishment of debt.\nThe quarter‘s adjusted EPS beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.57 by 4.5% and exceeded the company’s guided range of $1.55−$1.58.\nWithout the one-time adjustments, reported EPS from continuing operations in the third quarter increased 30% year over year to $1.43.\nCVS HEALTH CORP Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise \n\nCVS HEALTH CORP Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | CVS HEALTH CORP Quote \nQuarter in Details \nNet revenue in the third quarter increased 15.5% year over year to $44.6 billion but missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $45.3 billion. The upside was driven by balanced growth in the Pharmacy Services and Retail Pharmacy segments.\nPharmacy Services revenues increased 19.2% to $30.4 billion in the reported quarter on growth in the specialty pharmacy business and higher pharmacy network claims.\nPharmacy network claims processed during the quarter went up 23.3% to 282.6 million, backed by net new business growth. Moreover, the continued adoption of Maintenance Choice offerings reached the Mail Choice processed claim count to 22.4 million, up 2.5%.\nRevenues from CVS Health’s Retail/LTC improved 12.5% year over year to $20.1 billion, primarily driven by the addition of long-term care (LTC) operations from the Omnicare acquisition, the inclusion of pharmacies and clinics of Target Corporation which was taken over in Dec 2015 and pharmacy same-store sales growth. Same-store sales improved 2.3%, while front-end same-store sales were down 1% year over year.\nFront-end same-store sales were impacted by soft customer traffic, which was partially offset by an increase in basket size.\nPharmacy same-store sales increased 3.4% in the reported quarter. Sales were affected approximately 340 basis points (bps) due to recent generic drug introductions. Moreover, Pharmacy same-store prescription volumes rose 3% on a 30-day equivalent basis.\nThe generic dispensing rate (the proportion of all generic prescriptions to total number of prescriptions dispensed) soared 160 bps to 85.4% at the Pharmacy Services segment and 100 bps to 85.8% at the Retail/LTC segment.\nAlthough gross profit rose 12.4% to $7.4 billion, gross margin contracted 44 bps to 16.7%. Total operating margin during the quarter expanded 28 bps to 6.3% despite a 7.9% increase in operating costs.\nCVS Health exited the third quarter of 2016 with cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $2.26 billion, compared with $1.21 billion at the end of the second quarter. Year to date, net cash provided by operating activities was $7.94 billion, up 64.1% from the year-ago period.\nDuring the third quarter, CVS Health opened 48 new retail stores and closed 10. Further, the company relocated 11 retail stores. As of Sep 30, 2016, CVS operated 9,694 retail stores, including pharmacies in Target stores across 49 U.S. states, as well as the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Brazil.\n2016 Guidance Updated \nCVS Health has lowered its full-year 2016 earnings expectations. The company currently expects adjusted EPS in the range of $5.77–$5.83 (earlier expectation $5.81–$5.89). The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $5.86 for 2016, above the projected range.\nThe company however raised its cash flow guidance for 2016. It currently expects to free cash flow of $6.8–$7.0 billion ($6.3–$6.6 billion) and cash flow from operations of $9.3–$9.5 billion ($8.8–$9.1 billion) for 2016.\nCVS Health has also issued its fourth-quarter 2016 adjusted EPS projection. The company forecasts adjusted EPS in the range of $1.64−$1.70. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.79 is above the guided range.\nPreliminary 2017 Outlook \nThe company has issued its full-year 2017 preliminary outlook. Adjusted earnings are expected in the band of $5.77–$5.93. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.53 is above the guided range.\nOur Take \nCVS Health posted mixed third-quarter results with adjusted EPS beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate and revenues missed the mark. It is also disappointing to see the narrowed guidance which indicates the absence of any near-term catalyst. Nonetheless, year-over-year growth remained impressive with the Pharmacy Services segment benefiting from the upside in the Specialty Pharmacy and the Retail Pharmacy segments.\nWe take note of the recently completed Omnicare and Target Pharmacy acquisitions, which are currently undergoing the integration process. According to the company, both the acquisitions are strategic fits. CVS Health expects to benefit with multiple opportunities for driving enterprise value from Omnicare and Target in both the near and long term.\nZacks Rank & Key Picks \nCVS Health currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Better-ranked medical stocks are GW Pharmaceuticals plc ( GWPH - Free Report ) , Baxter International Inc. ( BAX - Free Report ) and Bovie Medical Corp. ( BVX - Free Report ) . GW Pharmaceuticals and Baxter sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) while Bovie Medical carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. \nGW Pharmaceuticals surged 71.6% year to date compared to the S&P 500’s 4.3% over the same period. The company has a four-quarter positive average earnings surprise of 41.6%.\nBaxter International rallied 26.5% in the past one year, comparing favorably with the S&P 500’s 2.6%. It has a trailing four-quarter average positive earnings surprise of 27%.\nBovie Medical recorded a 153.5% gain in the past one year, way better than the S&P 500’s 2.6%. The company has a trailing four-quarter positive average earnings surprise of 28.7%.\nConfidential from Zacks \nBeyond this Analyst Blog, would you like to see Zacks' best recommendations that are not available to the public?

CVS Health Corp.'s third-quarter profit jumped on a boost in prescription volume and higher retail sales, the company reported Tuesday, Nov. 8, 2016. (AP Photo/Matt Rourke) AP CVS Health's 3Q profit jumps, but revenue disappoints By LINDA A. JOHNSON AP Medical Writer Updated ( … ) Matt Rourke \nThis Friday, Oct. 21, 2016, photo shows a CVS drugstore and pharmacy location in Philadelphia. CVS Health Corp.'s third-quarter profit jumped on a boost in prescription volume and higher retail sales, the company reported Tuesday, Nov. 8, 2016. (AP Photo/Matt Rourke) \nCVS Health Corp. missed Wall Street's revenue expectations in the third quarter, despite sales jumping due to acquisitions. The company trimmed its profit forecast for this year, triggering a stock sell-off. \nThe drugstore chain and pharmacy benefits manager also noted significant headwinds that forced it to reduce its 2016 profit forecast by a nickel per share. Those include a soft seasonal business, slowing prescription growth in the overall market and recent pharmacy network changes expected to reduce the number of prescriptions filled at its pharmacies this year. Those network changes will have a bigger effect in 2017, CVS predicted. \nIts shares fell $9.86, or 11.8 percent, to close at $73.53, with trading volume reaching nearly 10 times the daily average. \nThe operator of the second-largest U.S. drugstore chain reported a 23.5 percent boost in profit to $1.54 billion, or $1.43 per share. Earnings, adjusted for one-time gains and costs, were $1.64 per share, topping Wall Street forecasts of $1.57 per share. \nQuarterly revenue jumped 15.5 percent to $44.62 billion, getting a lift from a boost in prescription volume and higher retail sales at its drugstores. Still, that missed Street expectations for revenue of $45.31 billion. \nThe bulk of the revenue boost came from the CVS pharmacy benefits unit, with an increase of 19.2 percent to $4.9 billion. The key driver was a 23.3 percent surge in prescription claims processed, to a total of 282.6 million. \nThe retail and long-term care unit had a 12.5 percent revenue boost to $20.1 billion, mainly on operations within Omnicare, a provider of pharmacy services to nursing homes and other clients. CVS Health bought Omnicare in 2015. CVS also benefited from its December 2015 acquisition of the pharmacy business of retailer Target. \nFor the fourth quarter, CVS Health expects its per-share earnings to range from $1.64 to $1.70, well below the $1.79 analysts had forecast. \nThe Woonsocket, Rhode Island-based company expects full-year earnings in the range of $5.77 to $5.83 per share, down from prior guidance of $4.92 to $5. It did not provide a forecast for its revenue. \nThe company announced on Nov. 3 that it was cutting about 600 jobs — out of more than 240,000 nationwide — to streamline its operations. \nMeanwhile, CVS Health's two main competitors in the U.S. drugstore market, Walgreens and Rite Aid, are planning to team up in a $9.41 billion deal that is still being reviewed by federal regulators. That combination could create a drugstore chain with more than 12,700 U.S. locations, or far more than CVS Health operates. It now owns more than 9,600 drugstores globally, counting the Target business. \nThe company noted that its retail pharmacy market share increased more than 2 percentage points in the third quarter, to 23.8 percent. \nCVS also runs the country's second-largest pharmacy benefits manager, or PBM. PBMs run prescription drug plans for employers, insurers and other customers. They process mail-order prescriptions, handle bills for prescriptions filled at retail pharmacies and set up formularies that determine patient coverage and copayments for individual prescription drugs. \n\"While we expect a healthy increase in PBM operating profit growth in 2017, we expect a decrease in retail operating profit growth,\" CVS Chief Executive Larry Merlo said in a statement. \nThe company noted its board approved a new, multiyear share repurchase program worth up to $15 billion, on top of the $3.7 billion remaining under its December 2014 share buyback program. Companies typically buy back large numbers of shares to boost their stock price and mollify disappointed investors.",

CVS also provided an updated on its long-term guidance at +10%, which is below current of +10-14% but inline (or better) than Street expectations given the lack of generic introduction in the coming years versus previous long-term guidance.\nAlthough 2017 initial guidance was a disappointment due to competitive pressures from retail networks, long term guidance remains intact. We suspect the loss of the Tricare business in October was a surprise and CVS needs to right-size it business for the new reality of limited retail networks. That being said, this is a top-notch management team, with a solid balance sheet and cash flow. We would buyers on today’s weakness.\nCVS Health’s market capitalization fell to $78.4 billion today from $88.9 billion yesterday.\nBarron’s Teresa Rivas recommended buying shares of CVS Health back in May when the stock traded $103.43.

Leerink’s David Larsen and Matt Dellelo have the details:\nGetty Images This morning CVS reported 3Q:16 earnings . While earnings in the quarter were solid, guidance was disappointing. Adjusted EPS of $1.64 came in ahead of Leerink/consensus of $1.55/$1.57, which includes a $0.05 tax benefit. While the quarter was good, 4Q:16 guidance of $1.64-$1.70 is below Leerink/consensus of $1.79/$1.75. CVS also provided preliminary 2017 adjusted EPS guidance of $5.77-$5.93, which is well below Leerink/consensus of $6.60/$6.50. The lower than expected outlook is due to changes in the retail networking landscape, and soft volumes in the industry.\nWhile 3Q results were decent 4Q:16 guidance is disappointing and the preliminary outlook for 2017 is well below expectations. The midpoint of 2017E EPS guidance of $5.85 is well below consensus of $6.50. The reduced outlook is due to lighter volumes in the industry, and changes in retail contracting – we think driven by Walgreens Boots Alliance’s ( WBA ) new Tricare deal and its agreements with Optum, Prime and Envision.\nShares of CVS Health have tumbled 11% to$73.88 at 12:43 p.m. today, while Walgreens Boots Alliance has fallen 1.6% to $80.18.",

      "text": "By Johanna Bennett Shares of CVS Health ( CVS ) are free falling today, down more than 12% after the company cut its full-year guidance , and that’s dragging some retail-focused ETFs along for the ride.\nThat’s right! — Retail, not healthcare. You won’t find CVS in the holdings of any of the three largest health-care ETFs – the Health Care Select Sector SPDR ETF ( XLV ), the iShares U.S. Healthcare ETF ( IYH ) and the Vanguard Healthcare ETF ( VHT ).\nBut the shares are among the top 10 holdings of both the VanEck Vectors Retail ETF ( RTH ) and PowerShares Exchange-Traded Fund Trust Dynamic Retail Portfolio ( PMR ), which have fallen 0.9% and 0.7% respectively.\nCVS Health, which operates both a retail pharmacy chain and a pharmacy benefit manager that helps health plans manage drugs benefits, warned that its pharmacy business stands to lose 40 million prescriptions next year as customers like the Department of Defense take their business elsewhere.\nIt seems that all that effort by rival Walgreens Boots Alliance ( WBA ) pursuing deals that make its stores part of preferred networks where patients can fill their prescriptions at a discount could shut out rival CVS stores.\nIn short, CVS is losing a ton of business. And Wall Street got caught off guard, as Barclays analyst Eric Percher and his team reports:\nWhile we fully expected that changes in the TRICARE network and increased alignment between WBA and OptumRx/ESRX/Prime would depress retail pharmacy script growth and profits in FY17, we appear to have underestimated the total impact (put at 40mn Rx by CVS) and even more so the potential all-in retail profitability associated with these scripts. CVS also noted a slowdown in prescription growth in the overall market and soft seasonal business, all of which led to preliminary FY17 guidance of $5.77-$5.93, flat relative to FY16 and below our expectation for 11% y/y growth.\nCVS isn’t suffering alone. Walgreen’s share price has fallen more than 2% in recent market action.",

      "text": "Investors were be looking to hear how CVS's ( CVS ) continued transition into a pharmacy benefits manager is going and what the longer term impact of exiting Tricare will be.\nCVS, which reported this morning, saw shares drop 16% in pre-market trading after the company lowered its profit outlook for this year. The drug store giant recently exited Tricare -- the military health program for the Department of Defense -- a curious move to investors, which has impacted the company's pharmacy market share.\nHowever, Leerink analyst David Larsen didn't believe the impact will be that large. \"While there are ~127M+ scripts associated with Tricareeach year, we estimate that just ~30.6M of these prescriptions are 'retail' and as a result we do not believe that CVS' exclusion from the Tricare network will be material,\" Larsen wrote in a note to clients.\nDespite Larsen's tempered negativity, he did note that many investors believe the move will have an \"unfavorable EPS impact to CVS will be much higher than what we estimate.\"\nCredit Suisse analyst Robert Willoughby cut his 2017 earnings estimates to $6.55 a share, down from $6.60 a share, because of the loss of the contract. However, other aspects of the company's business, like \"another solid PBM selling season in 2017, deal synergies from recent transactions including Target pharmacies,\" and the ability to add more stores are \"tailwinds\" for the company.\nAnalysts surveyed by Yahoo! Finance expect the company to earn cents a share on $45.3 billion in revenues.\nIn addition to the impact from the loss of Tricare, investors are looking to hear how CVS's role as a pharmacy benefits manager (PBM) is going, as well as how taking over Target's ( TGT ) pharmacies is going.",

      "text": "With one bit of bad news, CVS Health has lost more than $12 billion of its stock market value.\nThe pharmacy benefits manager and drugstore chain’s shares fell 16% on Tuesday morning after it said recent moves by health insurers seeking to cut costs by limiting pharmacy choices would slam CVS Health. Those insurers are bringing their business to arch rival Walgreens, costing CVS a big chunk of its drug-filling business.\nCVS warned investors of a likely “loss of more than 40 million retail prescriptions related to new restricted pharmacy networks,” the company said in its third-quarter earnings release. Last year, CVS filled or managed approximately 1 billion prescriptions, giving it 21.7% of the market and making it the biggest player.\nCVS’ prescription business has lost a lot of ground to Walgreens WBA of late: In September, CVS lost a contract to fill prescriptions through the Tricare pharmacy network. Tricare, the health care program with 9.7 million members made up of uniformed service members and their families, is owned by large Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans, which are restricting health plan enrollees to Walgreens as of Jan. 1.\nCVS also recently lost a contract with the fourth-largest U.S. PBM, Prime Therapeutics, which has 22 million members, to Walgreens.\n“Very recent pharmacy network changes in the marketplace are expected to cause some retail prescriptions to begin migrating out of our pharmacies this quarter,” said CVS CEO Larry Merlo.\nThat combined with slowing growth in the overall U.S. prescriptions market led CVS Health, the No.7 company on the Fortune 500, to lower its profit forecast for 2017.\nCVS relies on filling prescriptions to bring people into its stores to also buy general merchandise like toothpaste. But dispensing drugs generates about 73% of its retail revenues, which came out to $50 billion in 2015. In the most recent quarter, same-store sales for general merchandise fell 1% as fewer people came into CVS stores. CVS’ Caremark business last year generated $100 billion and is the second largest PBM behind Express Scripts . esrx\nThe company now expects 2017 adjusted profit in the range of $5.77-$5.93 per share, below analysts’ estimate of $6.52 per share, according to Thomson Reuters.",

      "text": "News and commentary about the stocks you need to know about today Search Stocks to Watch2 November 8, 2016, 4:25 P.M. ET The Biggest Loser: CVS Sinks 12% By Ben Levisohn \nCVS Health ( CVS ) suffered the biggest drop in the S&P 500 today after beating earnings forecasts but offering disappointing guidance . Getty Images \nShares of CVS Health tumbled 12% to $73.53, while the S&P 500 rose 0.4% to 2,139.53. \nMizuho’s Ann Hynes and Michael Pruell “would be buyers on today’s weakness.” They explain why: \nCVS reported a 3Q beat (adjusted EPS of $1.64 versus consensus $1.57E), but lowered 2016E guidance by 1% at the midpoint. 2017E initial guidance was provided early (usually given in December) and its 10% below our and Street estimates at the mid-point. CVS also provided an updated on its long-term guidance at +10%, which is below current of +10-14% but inline (or better) than Street expectations given the lack of generic introduction in the coming years versus previous long-term guidance. \nAlthough 2017 initial guidance was a disappointment due to competitive pressures from retail networks, long term guidance remains intact. We suspect the loss of the Tricare business in October was a surprise and CVS needs to right-size it business for the new reality of limited retail networks. That being said, this is a top-notch management team, with a solid balance sheet and cash flow. We would buyers on today’s weakness. \nCVS Health’s market capitalization fell to $78.4 billion today from $88.9 billion yesterday. \nBarron’s Teresa Rivas recommended buying shares of CVS Health back in May when the stock traded $103.43.

      "text": "CVS Health Corp. ( CVS ) saw its share price plummet Tuesday morning after it lowered earnings guidance for 2016 and reported an expected loss of prescriptions in 2017 as a part of its third quarter results.\nShares fell nearly 16% ahead of market's open, but bounced back slightly, hitting $72.47 per share, a drop of 13% since yesterday's close price. CVS' results came as a shock to investors, who began a sell off before markets opened Tuesday.\n\"While this earnings season has taught us in healthcare that gloom and doom is around every quarter, this was a shocking outcome for CVS despite materially lowered expectations,\" Evercore analyst Ross Muken wrote in a note.\nThe retail pharmacy and pharmacy benefit manager announced that it will lower its full year guidance for 2016 from $5.81-$5.89 per share to $5.77-$5.83 per share. CVS also projected a loss of 40 million prescriptions for 2017.\n\"Obviously we're not happy with our outlook for 2017,\" CEO and president of the company, Larry Merlo said during the company's third quarter earnings call Tuesday morning.\nCVS lost prescriptions to Walgreens Boots Alliance ( WBA ) , particularly through the military's Tricare program and Prime Therapeutics, both of which now restrict patient access to CVS.\nThe big surprise, though, wasn't the fact that CVS lost those prescriptions.\n\"\"What is a surprise is the profitability impact of these lost scripts,\" Mizuho analyst Ann Hynes wrote in a note. \"Given most of the lost scripts are government, we had assumed a lower gross profit than the company average.\"",

      "text": " 02 AM CVS revenue fails forecast Triggers stock sell-off despite third-quarter profit gains LINDA A. JOHNSON | Associated Press \nCVS Health Corp. missed Wall Street’s revenue expectations in the third quarter, despite sales jumping due to acquisitions. The company trimmed its profit forecast for this year, triggering a stock sell-off. \nThe drugstore chain and pharmacy benefits manager also noted significant headwinds that forced it to reduce its 2016 profit forecast by a nickel per share. Those include a soft seasonal business, slowing prescription growth in the overall market and recent pharmacy network changes expected to reduce the number of prescriptions filled at its pharmacies this year. Those network changes will have a bigger effect in 2017, CVS predicted. \nIts shares fell $9.86, or 11.8 percent, to close at $73.53, with trading volume reaching nearly 10 times the daily average. \nThe operator of the second-largest U.S. drugstore chain reported a 23.5 percent boost in profit to $1.54 billion, or $1.43 per share. Earnings, adjusted for one-time gains and costs, were $1.64 per share, topping Wall Street forecasts of $1.57 per share. \nQuarterly revenue jumped 15.5 percent to $44.62 billion, getting a lift from a boost in prescription volume and higher retail sales at its drugstores. Still, that missed Street expectations for revenue of $45.31 billion. \nThe bulk of the revenue boost came from the CVS pharmacy benefits unit, with an increase of 19.2 percent to $4.9 billion. The key driver was a 23.3 percent surge in prescription claims processed, to a total of 282.6 million. \nThe retail and long-term care unit had a 12.5 percent revenue boost to $20.1 billion, mainly on operations within Omnicare, a provider of pharmacy services to nursing homes and other clients. \nCVS Health bought Omnicare in 2015. CVS also benefited from its December 2015 acquisition of the pharmacy business of retailer Target.",

      "title": "Health Plans Squeeze Out CVS -- WSJ",
      "text": "Health Plans Squeeze Out CVS -- WSJ  48:  By Paul Ziobro \nCVS Health Inc. is getting a taste of its own medicine. \nThe biggest U.S. drugstore chain warned that it stands to lose 40 million prescriptions next year as deals signed by rival Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. with other participants in the drug supply chain shut out CVS pharmacies. \nChief Executive Larry Merlo said two recent partnerships that Walgreens struck with health plans that entirely excluded CVS drugstores from their networks were the main reason for the expected decline in prescriptions. CVS filled 1.03 billion prescriptions in 2015, the last full year available, up from 722 million five years earlier. \n\"We have always said that our last scripts are our most profitable,\" Mr. Merlo said on a conference call with analysts. \"Unfortunately, this means that the scripts we lose will tend to be our most profitable scripts.\" \nPharmacy-benefits managers, which include companies like Express Scripts Holding Co. and CVS Health's Caremark, operate as middlemen between insurance companies, corporations that pay for health coverage, drugmakers, and pharmacies. They help process claims for prescriptions drugs while also negotiating with drugmakers and insurance companies over the price of medications. \nBy owning Caremark as well as thousands of drugstores, CVS Health has been able to closely align both businesses to encourage patients to fill their prescriptions somewhere within the CVS empire. For instance, under its Maintenance Choice program, patients can get 90-day prescriptions filled either through the pharmacy-benefit program's mail-order business or at CVS stores at the same lower price. \nBut that leaves an opening for Walgreens to partner with other pharmacy-benefit managers. \"CVS can't have that same relations with other competing PBMs,\" said Adam Fein of Philadelphia-based Pembroke Consulting, who tracks drug distribution. \"Walgreens is using CVS Health's strengths against it.\" \nUnder CEO Stefano Pessina, Walgreens Boots has been aggressively pursuing deals that make its pharmacies part of preferred networks where patients can fill their prescriptions at a discount. It has had a number of wins, too, including becoming the preferred pharmacy for United Healthcare Inc.'sOptumRx and for Prime Therapeutics, which manages drug benefits for 14 Blue Cross and Blue Shield health plans. \nLast month, Walgreens signed a deal to become the preferred network for Tricare, the Defense Department's health- care network, supplanting CVS Health. It has also struck a deal to acquire the No. 3 U.S. chain, Rite Aid Corp., though the transaction awaits regulatory approval. Walgreens filled 929 million prescriptions in the fiscal year ended Aug. 31. \n\"Walgreens is trying to be the best friend of every PBM that's not named Caremark,\" said Mr. Fein. Walgreens is courting prescriptions because it wants to drive more traffic to its stores, so it can sell shoppers beauty and other products. CVS Health has been less willing to chase foot traffic with discounts, and even encourages customers to fill prescriptions by mail. \nMr. Merlo said Walgreens' deals with Prime and Tricare cut out CVS pharmacies entirely, and that weighs on profitability because of the fixed costs tied to running the locations. It also means fewer people coming into stores and spending money on snacks, household items and other sundries. \nBut Mr. Merlo defended the CVS Health model compared with the partnerships that Walgreens has made. \"While they may get part of the way there, we don't believe they can extract the full value that we do through our truly integrated model,\" he said. \nIn 4 p.m. trading Tuesday, CVS Health shares were down 12% at $73.53. The shares had already fallen nearly 15% this year, as investors fretted over pushback to rising drug prices and unease over the presidential election. Shares of Walgreens Boots fell 4% on Tuesday. \nCVS Health lowered its financial targets. For 2017 it now expects adjusted earnings per share of $5.77 to $5.93. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had expected earnings per share of $6.52. \nThe Woonsocket, R.I.-based giant has increasingly relied on its Caremark division for growth. In the latest quarter, CVS Health had a profit of $1.54 billion, or $1.43 a share, up from $1.25 billion, or $1.11 a share, a year earlier. \nRevenue increased 15% to $44.62 billion, Revenue in the pharmacy services segment, which includes Caremark, rose 19.2% to $30.4 billion. \nSales at existing pharmacy locations rose 2.3%, with a 3.4% increase in prescription sales offset by a 1% decline in the front-end of the business. \nAusten Hufford contributed to this article \nWrite to Paul Ziobro at Paul.Ziobro@wsj.com (END) Dow Jones Newswires 11-09-160248ET Copyright (c) 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.",

The company trimmed its profit forecast for this year, triggering a stock sell-off.\nThe drugstore chain and pharmacy benefits manager also noted significant head winds that forced it to reduce its 2016 profit forecast by a nickel per share. Those include a soft seasonal business, slowing prescription growth in the overall market and recent pharmacy network changes expected to reduce the number of prescriptions filled at its pharmacies this year. Those network changes will have a bigger effect in 2017, CVS predicted.\nIts shares fell $9.86, or 11.8 percent, to close at $73.53, with trading volume reaching nearly 10 times the daily average.\nThe operator of the second-largest U.S. drugstore chain reported a 23.5 percent boost in profit to $1.54 billion, or $1.43 a share.

      "text": "The Ticker Herald Staff Wednesday, November 09, 2016 comments CVS sales jump, but revenue disappoints\nCVS Health Corp. missed Wall Street’s revenue expectations in the third quarter, despite sales jumping due to acquisitions. The company trimmed its profit forecast for this year, triggering a stock sell-off.\nThe drugstore chain and pharmacy benefits manager also noted significant headwinds that forced it to reduce its 2016 profit forecast by a nickel per share. Those include a soft seasonal business, slowing prescription growth in the overall market and recent pharmacy network changes expected to reduce the number of prescriptions filled at its pharmacies this year. Those network changes will have a bigger effect in 2017, CVS predicted.\nThe operator of the second-largest U.S. drugstore chain reported a 23.5 percent boost in profit to $1.54 billion, or $1.43 per share. Earnings, adjusted for one-time gains and costs, were $1.64 per share, topping Wall Street forecasts of $1.57 per share.\nQuarterly revenue jumped 15.5 percent to $44.62 billion, getting a lift from a boost in prescription volume and higher retail sales at its drugstores. Still, that missed Street expectations for revenue of $45.31 billion.\nU.S. employers post more job openings\nU.S. employers posted slightly more job openings in September, a likely sign that the steady job gains of recent months could continue.\nThe Labor Department said that job openings edged up to 5.49 million in September, a modest increase from 5.45 million openings in August. Openings had plunged to an eight-month low in August.\nThe data affirms recent evidence that hiring has been more tempered after setting a robust pace of the prior two years. Still, the economy is generating enough jobs to reduce unemployment and boost incomes. And most economists have expected monthly job growth to slow as the number of unemployed has decreased.\nOpenings increased in September in construction, manufacturing and financial activities, among other sectors. But openings slipped at restaurants and in the logistics sector.\nTripAdvisor misses Wall St. targets\nTripAdvisor Inc. yesterday reported a third-quarter profit of $55 million.\nOn a per-share basis, the Needham-based company said it had net income of 37 cents.\nEarnings, adjusted for stock option expense and amortization costs, came to 53 cents per share.\nThe results did not meet Wall Street expectations. The average estimate of 12 analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research was for earnings of 54 cents per share. The travel website operator posted revenue of $421 million in the period, also missing Street forecasts. Eight analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $439.4 million.\nDrug co. Valeant posts poor results\nFormer Wall Street darling Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc., now more of a dog for its reviled strategy of huge drug price hikes, posted dismal third-quarter results and sharply reduced its profit forecast for 2016, driving down its stock price.\nThe Canadian drug maker, the target of multiple government probes over its pricing practices and questionable financial reporting, reported a third-quarter loss yesterday and missed the Street’s profit expectations by a wide margin.\nThe Laval, Quebec-based drug maker lost $1.22 billion, or $3.49 per share, after posting a profit a year earlier.",

      "text": "By Ben Levisohn CVS Health ( CVS ) suffered the biggest drop in the S&P 500 today after beating earnings forecasts but offering disappointing guidance .\nGetty Images Shares of CVS Health tumbled 12% to $73.53, while the S&P 500 rose 0.4% to 2,139.53.\nMizuho’s Ann Hynes and Michael Pruell “would be buyers on today’s weakness.” They explain why:\nCVS reported a 3Q beat (adjusted EPS of $1.64 versus consensus $1.57E), but lowered 2016E guidance by 1% at the midpoint. 2017E initial guidance was provided early (usually given in December) and its 10% below our and Street estimates at the mid-point. CVS also provided an updated on its long-term guidance at +10%, which is below current of +10-14% but inline (or better) than Street expectations given the lack of generic introduction in the coming years versus previous long-term guidance.\nAlthough 2017 initial guidance was a disappointment due to competitive pressures from retail networks, long term guidance remains intact. We suspect the loss of the Tricare business in October was a surprise and CVS needs to right-size it business for the new reality of limited retail networks. That being said, this is a top-notch management team, with a solid balance sheet and cash flow. We would buyers on today’s weakness.\nCVS Health’s market capitalization fell to $78.4 billion today from $88.9 billion yesterday.\nBarron’s Teresa Rivas recommended buying shares of CVS Health back in May when the stock traded $103.43.

      "text": "Overreaction to CVS Earnings Makes Stock Cheap For Long Term Investors November 08, 2016, 10:06:06 AM EDT By Martin Tillier Shutterstock photo \nI have said many times in the past that one thing that traders and investors need to understand is that markets have a tendency to overreact to news, at least in the short term. In the scramble immediately following something like a bad earnings report, buyers become rarer and sellers become more desperate, and there are often big gaps between actual trades. \nThat is also exaggerated by the fact that earnings are released when the market is closed and there is very little liquidity. Identifying instances when that happens can provide investors with a longer term outlook some great opportunities to pick up cheap stock. I would say that CVS ( CVS ) fits that description this morning. \nThe action following Hertz’s third quarter earnings release after hours yesterday was the kind of thing that frequently mystifies those new to the markets, and even, in an extreme case like that of CVS, several old timers like myself. CVS reported an extremely good third quarter. They beat Earnings per Share (EPS) expectations of $1.57 by a decent margin, with bottom line profits of $1.64. Admittedly they did miss on revenue, with $44.6 billion vs. estimates of $45.29, but both the top and bottom line showed significant growth. Sales were up 15.5% and EPS grew by 28% year on year. \nIt should be understood that $0.05 of that EPS beat came from a one off tax benefit, but that still leaves a beat and the company also announce $15 billion in stock buybacks. \nWhat really hurt CVS was a decidedly downbeat tone to accompanying comments and, most of all, lower guidance for the full year. I understand that guidance is the most important factor in determining a stock’s reaction to earnings, but for the stock to lose over 16% as it did is a huge overreaction. \nThere are undoubtedly problems, as the above chart would indicate, but the decline over the last six months suggests that they were, at least to some extent, already priced in before yesterday’s earnings. CVS’s push into the specialty pharmacy business came just at the time when reimbursement rates for those businesses came under scrutiny and the move towards clinical care at CVS locations has not been as smooth as expected. \nThat said, like most companies, CVS management has a tendency to be overly pessimistic with their outlook. Anybody who is in business learns early that it is better to underpromise and overdeliver than to do things the other way around, and most executives apply that principle to earnings forecasts. \nThe underlying fact here is that CVS’s business is hardly spiraling downwards. Growth, particularly from the clinics, may be moving at a slower than optimal pace but in what was a difficult quarter for many companies they continued to grow. Same store sales increased 2.3% in Q3, with same store pharmacy sales up 3.4%. Similarly, while the margins in the specialty pharmacy business may not be as massive as they once were, it is still a profitable area. \nSo, if we take a step back from the conservative guidance for a minute, what we have in CVS is a company that is having more issues than were anticipated with some transitions, but which is still achieving respectable growth. Add in the $15 billion buyback program and a dividend that stood at over 2% before the stock’s drop yesterday, it becomes pretty clear that for those with a longer term outlook CVS is oversold at around $70 and represents a solid investment. \nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.

      "text": "Walgreens’ prescription partnerships sting competitor CVS By Lisa Schencker/Chicago Tribune Fredericksburg.com \nCHICAGO — Walgreens’ recent partnerships with companies that manage prescription drug benefits are putting a serious dent in the business of one of its main retail pharmacy competitors. \nCVS Health announced Tuesday that it expects to lose 40 million retail prescriptions next year because of new retail pharmacy networks that don’t include CVS, such as those created by Walgreens’ partnerships. \nThis year, Walgreens, headquartered in suburban Chicago, formed partnerships with a number of pharmacy benefit managers, which are companies that manage prescription drug benefits for insurers and employers. Those partnerships make Walgreens a preferred pharmacy for people with certain health insurance plans, meaning medications for those customers are significantly cheaper at Walgreens and other in-network pharmacies than at drugstores that aren’t part of those networks. \nIn September, Express Scripts, the pharmacy benefit manager for the U.S. military’s health insurance program, announced that on Dec. 1 it would add Walgreens to the military health insurance program’s network and drop CVS. That means those with military health insurance, known as Tricare, will have to get their prescriptions at Walgreens or other in-network pharmacies starting Dec. 1 or pay significantly higher rates for them elsewhere. \nIn August, Walgreens announced a partnership with pharmacy benefit manager Prime Therapeutics, which is owned by 14 Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans and has 22 million members. Walgreens also partnered in March with benefit manager OptumRx, which is part of UnitedHealth Group and has 66 million members. \nWalgreens has been particularly aggressive in pursuing such deals, said Vishnu Lekraj, a senior equity analyst at Morningstar in Chicago. The benefit managers restrict which drugstores can be part of their networks to get better discounts on drugs from pharmacies such as Walgreens, he said. \n“This has been to the detriment of CVS,” Lekraj said. “Walgreens has been willing to take lower profitability from its drugs it’s selling in order to participate in these restricted networks. CVS has been unable or unwilling to do that.” \nThose deals, along with other factors, led CVS on Tuesday to reduce its guidance this year to earnings per share of $5.77 to $5.83, down from $5.81 to $5.89. After the news, CVS stock dropped about 12 percent Tuesday, closing at $73.53 per share. \nCVS has its own pharmacy benefit manager business, and CVS President and CEO Larry Merlo said in a news release Tuesday the he expects a “healthy increase” in operating profit growth next year in that area. He said, however, that he expects a decrease in retail operating profit growth.",

CVS Health Corp.'s third-quarter profit jumped on a boost in prescription volume and higher retail sales, the company reported Tuesday, Nov. 8, 2016. (AP Photo/Matt Rourke) AP CVS Health's 3Q profit jumps, but revenue disappoints By LINDA A. JOHNSON AP Medical Writer Updated ( … ) Matt Rourke \nThis Friday, Oct. 21, 2016, photo shows a CVS drugstore and pharmacy location in Philadelphia. CVS Health Corp.'s third-quarter profit jumped on a boost in prescription volume and higher retail sales, the company reported Tuesday, Nov. 8, 2016. (AP Photo/Matt Rourke) \nCVS Health Corp. missed Wall Street's revenue expectations in the third quarter, despite sales jumping due to acquisitions. The company trimmed its profit forecast for this year, triggering a stock sell-off. \nThe drugstore chain and pharmacy benefits manager also noted significant headwinds that forced it to reduce its 2016 profit forecast by a nickel per share. Those include a soft seasonal business, slowing prescription growth in the overall market and recent pharmacy network changes expected to reduce the number of prescriptions filled at its pharmacies this year. Those network changes will have a bigger effect in 2017, CVS predicted. \nIts shares fell $9.86, or 11.8 percent, to close at $73.53, with trading volume reaching nearly 10 times the daily average. \nThe operator of the second-largest U.S. drugstore chain reported a 23.5 percent boost in profit to $1.54 billion, or $1.43 per share. Earnings, adjusted for one-time gains and costs, were $1.64 per share, topping Wall Street forecasts of $1.57 per share. \nQuarterly revenue jumped 15.5 percent to $44.62 billion, getting a lift from a boost in prescription volume and higher retail sales at its drugstores. Still, that missed Street expectations for revenue of $45.31 billion. \nThe bulk of the revenue boost came from the CVS pharmacy benefits unit, with an increase of 19.2 percent to $4.9 billion. The key driver was a 23.3 percent surge in prescription claims processed, to a total of 282.6 million. \nThe retail and long-term care unit had a 12.5 percent revenue boost to $20.1 billion, mainly on operations within Omnicare, a provider of pharmacy services to nursing homes and other clients. CVS Health bought Omnicare in 2015. CVS also benefited from its December 2015 acquisition of the pharmacy business of retailer Target. \nFor the fourth quarter, CVS Health expects its per-share earnings to range from $1.64 to $1.70, well below the $1.79 analysts had forecast. \nThe Woonsocket, Rhode Island-based company expects full-year earnings in the range of $5.77 to $5.83 per share, down from prior guidance of $4.92 to $5. It did not provide a forecast for its revenue. \nThe company announced on Nov. 3 that it was cutting about 600 jobs — out of more than 240,000 nationwide — to streamline its operations. \nMeanwhile, CVS Health's two main competitors in the U.S. drugstore market, Walgreens and Rite Aid, are planning to team up in a $9.41 billion deal that is still being reviewed by federal regulators. That combination could create a drugstore chain with more than 12,700 U.S. locations, or far more than CVS Health operates. It now owns more than 9,600 drugstores globally, counting the Target business. \nThe company noted that its retail pharmacy market share increased more than 2 percentage points in the third quarter, to 23.8 percent. \nCVS also runs the country's second-largest pharmacy benefits manager, or PBM. PBMs run prescription drug plans for employers, insurers and other customers. They process mail-order prescriptions, handle bills for prescriptions filled at retail pharmacies and set up formularies that determine patient coverage and copayments for individual prescription drugs. \n\"While we expect a healthy increase in PBM operating profit growth in 2017, we expect a decrease in retail operating profit growth,\" CVS Chief Executive Larry Merlo said in a statement. \nThe company noted its board approved a new, multiyear share repurchase program worth up to $15 billion, on top of the $3.7 billion remaining under its December 2014 share buyback program. Companies typically buy back large numbers of shares to boost their stock price and mollify disappointed investors.",

      "text": "Shares of CVS Health ( CVS ) plunged on Tuesday in its biggest intraday loss in more than a year after the company released its earnings forecasts for 2017.\nThe company's chief executive said that the company would suffer from slowing prescription sales.\nShares of CVS fell 11%.\nThe 2017 projections soured what might have been an otherwise decent third-quarter earnings report.\nFor the quarter, CVS soundly beat a few of the analyst expectations.\nEarnings clocked in at $1.64 a share, versus the consensus estimate of $1.57 a share. Net income attributable to CVS's pharmacies rose by 24% year over year, to $1.54 billion or $1.43 a share, from $1.25 billion, or $1.11 a share.\nTo be sure, revenue of $44.6 billion was below analysts' forecasts.\nBut that's not the biggest disappointment to come out of Tuesday's earnings announcement.\nFor fiscal 2017, CVS announced that it expects adjusted earnings to range from $5.77 to $5.93 per share. That is far from the $6.53 per share that the Wall Street consensus forecast. And the company further displeased investors by announcing a \"multiyear\" plan to buy back another $15 billion of its own stock.\nPart of the company's expected woes next year is attributable to restrictive changes to pharmacy networks. \"Very recent pharmacy network changes in the marketplace are expected to cause some retail prescriptions to begin migrating out of our pharmacies this quarter,\" said CVS CEO Larry Merlo on Tuesday. \"In addition, we are currently experiencing slowing prescription growth in the overall market as well as a soft seasonal business.\"",

      "text": "Four states approve minimum wage increases (Seeking Alpha) \nA day after CVS Health Corp (NYSE: CVS ) offered downbeat forecasts for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2017, Argus found three reasons behind these guides and subsequently reduced its target price from $120 to $85 while retaining the Buy rating. \nThe price target implies an upside potential of more than 10 percent, significant following the 11.8 percent hammering the stock undertook on the back of tepid outlook Tuesday . Why The Lackluster Guides? \nAnalyst Chris Graja cited the following three reasons for the pharmacy's weak forecast: CVS is set to lose about 40 million scripts resulting in a drop of EBIT in 2017. Lower accretion expected from Target Corporation (NYSE: TGT ) pharmacy and the Omnicare acquisitions. The company sees $0.09 a share lower than CVS initially estimated. Though the integration of these acquisitions is ongoing, the tangible benefits are taking longer than expected to materialize. Erosion of gross margin is seen from lower rates of reimbursement apart from mix in business. Argus' Bottom Line \nThe brokerage said in a research note, “Despite intense competition, we believe that the company’s integrated model, which includes the CVS retail pharmacies, the Caremark PBM, a growing Specialty pharmacy business, pharmacies within Target Stores, and MinuteClinic, is the right structure to deliver cost savings, better care, and attractive shareholder returns.” \nArgus is encouraged by CVS efforts to sharpen its capabilities to offer more services for an expanded customer base. The firm sees more proof of proprietary technology and clinical programs that improve CVS's position as a heathcare partner. The brokerage is confident that the company could deliver incremental gains with the help of customer interactions. \nAt last check, CVS was up 2.37 percent at $75.27. \nImage Credit: By WhisperToMe at English Wikipedia [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons Latest Ratings for CVS",

      "text": "  CVS Not in the Pink After Earnings Call 40 million prescription losses through 2017 has taken the wind out of CVS stock   CVS +0% WBA +0% \nCVS Health ( NYSE:CVS ) stock slid by more than 10% after the company lowered its guidance for the current fiscal. CVS said the company expects full-year adjusted earnings to come in the range of $5.77 to $5.83 instead of the previously announced $5.81 to $5.89 due to a slowdown in prescription sales and soft seasonal business. \nCVS stock has been under intense pressure since May of this year and has lost more than 23% of its value in the last 12 months. \nThe company posted net revenue growth of 15.5% for the quarter, which was not enough to shore up the market’s confidence as the company missed analyst estimates by a wide margin. Wall Street was expecting the company to post $45.5 billion in net revenues while the actual number came in at $44.6 billion. Peter Lynch Chart of CVS \nCVS Health’s EPS of $1.64 for the quarter was much better than the $1.57 the market expected, but the damage was done when the revenue miss was coupled with a downward revision of earnings outlook. Competition in the market seems to be the reason behind the lowering of expectations, and that is not something investors really like to see. \n\"The company said it expects to lose more than 40 million retail prescriptions in 2017. About 40% of those prescription losses are due to competitor Walgreens' ( NASDAQ:WBA ) new mail-order pharmacy tie-up with Prime Therapeutics and U.S. Department of Defense health care program TRICARE exiting the CVS network, CVS CEO Larry Merlo told investors. The rest is just the normal churn that takes place.\" - USA Today \nThe loss of prescriptions is a serious setback for CVS Health as they will lose some of their most profitable ones. As such, the outlook for the entire year ahead is bleak, hence the belligerent market sentiment towards the company. Merlo said that the deals were “unexpected,” but fact remains that CVS has been left out in the cold by the Department of Defense on the Tricare deal for active and retired military personnel, and the company needs something to offset the losses. \nCan CVS Health bounce back from this unfortunate series of events? Possibly, but they will need to look beyond organic growth to make that happen. Merlo insists that CVS will post a 10% growth in adjusted EPS over the long term, but we will have to wait and see how he plans to achieve that target. \nDisclosure: I have no positions in the stock mentioned above and no intention to initiate a position in the next 72 hours.

      "text": "Stocks opened modestly lower Tuesday as quarterly reports spurred some highly charged trading.\nThe Dow industrials fell nearly 0.3% while the Nasdaq composite was off nearly 0.4% and S&P 500 0.3%.\nIn Motion: Priceline, Hertz, CVS Health, Momo Earnings season is in full swing, with a host of big names busy in the premarket session and travel stocks receiving special attention.\nPriceline Group ( PCLN ) booked a 6% gain as analysts hustled to raise price targets following a stronger-than-expected third-quarter report late Monday. Management guided fourth-quarter earnings below consensus views, but pointed to 29% growth in room night bookings and announced interim Chief Executive Brett Keller would take over as permanent chief, effective immediately. Priceline is rebounding from support at its 10-week moving average.\nHertz Global Holdings ( HTZ ) collapsed more than 48% after third-quarter revenue and earnings slumped even more than expected, and the company dropped its full-year earnings guidance to well below targets. Already more than 11 million shares changed hands, or 15% of its 71-million-share float.\nCVS Health ( CVS ) tanked as much as 15% in early trading. The pharmacy chain and prescription benefits manager reported third-quarter earnings that exceeded forecasts, but a 15% gain in revenue stopped short of consensus estimates.\nAmong IBD 50 names, China-based Momo ( MOMO ) keyed in an 5% loss at the open, getting as low as 24.25 but holding above its rising 50-day moving average. The social networking phenom strode past expectations as third-quarter earnings multiplied to 24 cents a share from 2 cents. Revenue more than quadrupled to $157.1 million from $37.5 million. Management guided fourth-quarter revenue growth to between $185 million-$190 million, vs. a consensus target of $140.2 million.\nMomo shares bolted 12% higher Monday, leaving shares extended from a rebound off its 50-day moving average.\nHomebuilder D.R. Horton ( DHI ) dropped 6% after missing analysts third-quarter projections on both its revenue and earnings lines. Home closings rose 16% and values gained 19%, but a steep drop in lot and land sales disappointed expectations.\nJohnson Controls ( JCI ) gapped up at the open and jumped nearly 4%. The maker of electronic security systems and fire protection products reported adjusted third-quarter earnings that easily cleared analyst expectations. Revenue climbed 17% to $10.2 billion. The stock topped the 42.18 early buy point in a flat base that also shows double-bottom characteristics.\nSeptember JOLTS Report; Commodities, Global Markets Quiet The Labor Department's Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) for September is expected at 10 a.m. ET. Chicago Federal Reserve Bank President Charles Evans continues his busy schedule this week, speaking at 7:45 a.m. ET and 12:20 p.m. ET.\nOil futures continued to slump, as West Texas Intermediate crude fell 0.9% to $44.49 a barrel. Gold edged up a fraction to above $1,281 an ounce. The dollar traded up against the yen, flat vs. the euro. Bonds flattened with the 10-year yield at 1.82%.\nOverseas, China's markets closed with benchmarks in Shanghai and Hong Kong up 0.5%. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 clocked a flat finish, and markets in Europe were flat-to-lower in afternoon trade.",

      "text": "MarketWatch: CVS is about to lose more than 40 million prescriptions \nReduced Guidance Moving Forward \nAs I've said, CVS updated their earnings guidance. This applies for both fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017. For the current fiscal year: Full year GAAP diluted EPS lowered and narrowed to $4.84 to $4.90 from $4.92 to $5.00, including third quarter acquisition-related integration costs Full year Adjusted EPS lowered and narrowed to $5.77 to $5.83 from $5.81 to $5.89 Provided fourth quarter GAAP diluted EPS of $1.52 to $1.58, excluding acquisition-related integration costs Provided fourth quarter Adjusted EPS of $1.64 to $1.70, up 7.00% to 10.75% Raised full year cash flow from operations to $9.3 to $9.5 billion; free cash flow to $6.8 to $7.0 billion \nFor fiscal year 2017 (which is a preliminary outlook): Provided full year GAAP diluted EPS of $5.16 to $5.33 Provided full year Adjusted EPS of $5.77 to $5.93 Both include the projected loss of more than 40 million retail prescriptions related to new restricted pharmacy networks GAAP diluted EPS includes impact of previously announced termination of pension plan \nWhile guidance has been reduced, this will still present suitable growth over last year's numbers. \nCurrent Valuation \nNow that we understand the dynamics behind the company's dropoff, let's evaluate their current valuation. More specifically, does this dropoff present a buying opportunity? \nPrice-to-Earnings Ratio \nBased on earnings, the valuation of CVS is very attractive compared with its primary peer Walgreens Boot Alliance (NASDAQ: WBA ). \nPrice-to-Book Ratio \nThis valuation trend continues if we look at their price-to-book-value ratios, as CVS trades at a discount to both its main competitor and its short-term historical average. \nDividend Yield \nAs you can see, the trend again continues with dividend yield, where CVS is again attractively valued. \nThe Bottom Line \nThe drop in share price after CVS' earnings report comes after a much longer period of stock price deterioration. However, the iShares US Healthcare ETF (NYSEARCA: IYH ) experienced a similar decline, suggesting that the long-term decline in CVS is due to industry dynamics rather than company-specific dynamics. CVS data by YCharts \nI believe that for investors that have faith in the future of CVS, this presents an excellent buying opportunity. After all, the stock has already recovered significantly from its post-earnings drop, and I believe the business is still fundamentally strong based on its financial performance this quarter. It is also attractively valued. Thus, I believe CVS is a buy. Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

      "text": "© 2016 North Jersey Media Group November 9, 2016   5:03 PM Lexington Ave CVS will replace one on Lakeview Ave By Tony Gicas Staff Writer | Clifton Journal \nCLIFTON - CVS will build its new store on a Lexington Avenue vacant lot, but residents aren't happy about it. Courtesy rendering A new CVS pharmacy store will open on Lexington Avenue on the lot which formerly housed the Norselander and Lee's Hawaiian Islander. It will replace the CVS on Lakeview Avenue. \nThe board of adjustment unanimously approved an application which calls for the construction of a 14,700-square-foot CVS building standing nearly 30 feet high at the empty lot at the corner of Lexington and Piaget avenues. \nThe property at 635 Lexington Ave. formerly housed the Norselander Restaurant and then the Lee's Hawaiian Islander tiki bar until it was destroyed by a fire in 2003. The lot has remained vacant ever since. \nDue to the objections of City officials, the CVS will not be open 24 hours as it originally proposed, officials said. \nThe retail and health-service provider's planner, William Martin, confirmed the current CVS pharmacy located at 90 Lakeview Ave. will close when the approved store is operational. Martin said the new design will provide an \"aesthetic enhancement\" to the neighborhood. \n\"We are very pleased that our plans have been approved by the town,\" said Stephanie Cunha, the drug store chain's public relations manager. \"We look forward to continuing to offer the community of Clifton our best-in-class pharmacy services and a wider range of better-for-you snacks, and health and beauty products when the store opens in 2019.\" \nGlenn Peterson, the attorney representing the applicant, Turabdin Realty LLC, said it \"speaks volumes\" that no residents formally objected to the application. \n\"When a catering facility was approved for the site (in 2011) the owner was met with substantial opposition,\" Peterson said. \"Our application had the resident who lives adjacent to our property actually speak in favor.\" \nThe resident, Margarita McGrath, of 20 Piaget Ave., said she has \"no issues\" and approved of the proposed CVS plans. \nMany residents, however, are not as happy about the news. \n\"Enough with the retail crap!\" said Donna Pinte, a Clifton High School graduate currently living in Wayne. She advocated the construction of a dog park to be used in tandem with Nash Park. \nOne former resident said the CVS approval is an example of the City \"pushing\" small businesses out of Clifton. \nSeveral stakeholders floated the idea of low-cost, senior housing as a fit for the empty lot. \nAnother local resident had hoped a new restaurant would pick up where Lee's tiki bar and restaurant left off. \nJoseph Jaworski, an engineer representing the retailer, said the store's hours run from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. Monday through Saturday and from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. on Sunday. The drive-thru and pharmacy accepts customers from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. Monday to Saturday and 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Sunday. \n\"The drive-thru is seldom-used - typically one or two cars queue at a time - but it's very important to the operation,\" Jaworski said. \nThe property will include two entrances, with the Lexington Avenue driveway limiting motorists to right turns in and out. A physical concrete island to prevent left turns in or out of the parking lot is currently up for Passaic County approval. \nAccording to Joseph Staiger, the traffic engineer representing CVS, the drug store will create less intense traffic than The Gate restaurant approved in 2011. \n\"Traffic will be spread out throughout the day but, at a banquet hall, when a party starts or ends, everybody runs in or out at the same time,\" said Staiger. \nThe vacant lot will include new sidewalks, evergreen trees and other landscaping to improve the property's perimeter. \nCVS reps said the drug store chain is currently embarking on a \"new look\" which is more modern and colorful than its predecessors. \nOne local merchant is not surprised by the chain's decision to leave a leased property and relocate nearby where they can build a store from the ground up. \nMustafa Faraj, a registered pharmacist in New Jersey and New York, will manage the new Lakeview Pharmacy when it opens its doors at 244 Lakeview Ave. the week of Nov. 21. \nIronically, Faraj previously worked at CVS for nine years as a pharmacy technician, intern and graduate intern. He was offered a full-time position with the chain in 2013 as a newly licensed pharmacist but instead pursued an offer at an independent pharmacy. \nHe contended that the retailer's new location is \"extremely positive\" for his new business venture, suggesting that it will \"only help\" Lakeview Pharmacy which, he says, offers many different services to \"CVS-loyal\" patients. \n\"I would not necessarily use the word 'compete' because, at the end of the day, I am a health care professional who follows a code of ethics to better assist the public in making the best use of their medications,\" Faraj said. \"As a community pharmacist, I am here to provide personalized service for each and every patient.\" \nHe said the independent drug store received its state pharmacy permit on Nov. 1. \nDue to its proximity to Nash Park, which Martin called \"a major recreational area for Clifton citizenry,\" he said the store will serve as a pedestrian destination for residents utilizing the recreational area. \nCVS representatives did not provide the reasoning behind its decision to close the Lakeview branch in favor of the Lexington Avenue location. \n\"Why the move? I would say progress,\" contended Commissioner George Foukas. \"They're gaining a drive-thru that they didn't have before. And, it's a beautiful building.\" \nThe approval is subject to reports from police, fire and engineering departments as well as a developer's agreement and county approval. \n\"I think this is a positive because you're taking one existing pharmacy and putting a more attractive, futuristic [building] on another site that really needs new life,\" Commissioner Louis DeStefano said. \"This is going to serve the needs of the residents of Clifton and have a positive impact on an area that needs something developed there.\" \nAccording to tax records, Turabdin Realty purchased the abandoned property in October of 2014 for $790,000 from Fadi Salim, who originally acquired the tract for $1.5 million in 2006. \nCVS currently operates four locations in Clifton: Allwood Road, Main Avenue, Kingsland Road and Lakeview Avenue. \nThe Rhode Island-based giant's three-letter abbreviation first stood for \"Customer Value Stores\" when it was a subsidiary of the Melville Corporation. \nEmail: gicas@northjersey.com",

I would say progress,\" contended Commissioner George Foukas. \"They're gaining a drive-thru that they didn't have before. And, it's a beautiful building.\"\nThe approval is subject to reports from police, fire and engineering departments as well as a developer's agreement and county approval.\n\"I think this is a positive because you're taking one existing pharmacy and putting a more attractive, futuristic [building] on another site that really needs new life,\" Commissioner Louis DeStefano said. \"This is going to serve the needs of the residents of Clifton and have a positive impact on an area that needs something developed there.\"\nAccording to tax records, Turabdin Realty purchased the abandoned property in October of 2014 for $790,000 from Fadi Salim, who originally acquired the tract for $1.5 million in 2006.\nCVS currently operates four locations in Clifton: Allwood Road, Main Avenue, Kingsland Road and Lakeview Avenue.\nThe Rhode Island-based giant's three-letter abbreviation first stood for \"Customer Value Stores\" when it was a subsidiary of the Melville Corporation.\nEmail: gicas@northjersey.com\nNorthJersey.com : News : Business NorthJersey.com : News : Business November 9, 2016   5:03 PM Lexington Ave CVS will replace one on Lakeview Ave Buy this photo Courtesy rendering A new CVS pharmacy store will open on Lexington Avenue on the lot which formerly housed the Norselander and Lee's Hawaiian Islander. It will replace the CVS on Lakeview Avenue. By Tony Gicas Staff Writer |  Clifton Journal Pages: 1 2 > display on one page CLIFTON - CVS will build its new store on a Lexington Avenue vacant lot, but residents aren't happy about it.\nThe board of adjustment unanimously approved an application which calls for the construction of a 14,700-square-foot CVS building standing nearly 30 feet high at the empty lot at the corner of Lexington and Piaget avenues.\nThe property at 635 Lexington Ave. formerly housed the Norselander Restaurant and then the Lee's Hawaiian Islander tiki bar until it was destroyed by a fire in 2003. The lot has remained vacant ever since.\nDue to the objections of City officials, the CVS will not be open 24 hours as it originally proposed, officials said.\nThe retail and health-service provider's planner, William Martin, confirmed the current CVS pharmacy located at 90 Lakeview Ave. will close when the approved store is operational. Martin said the new design will provide an \"aesthetic enhancement\" to the neighborhood.\n\"We are very pleased that our plans have been approved by the town,\" said Stephanie Cunha, the drug store chain's public relations manager. \"We look forward to continuing to offer the community of Clifton our best-in-class pharmacy services and a wider range of better-for-you snacks, and health and beauty products when the store opens in 2019.\"\nGlenn Peterson, the attorney representing the applicant, Turabdin Realty LLC, said it \"speaks volumes\" that no residents formally objected to the application.\n\"When a catering facility was approved for the site (in 2011) the owner was met with substantial opposition,\" Peterson said. \"Our application had the resident who lives adjacent to our property actually speak in favor.\"\nThe resident, Margarita McGrath, of 20 Piaget Ave., said she has \"no issues\" and approved of the proposed CVS plans.\nMany residents, however, are not as happy about the news.\n\"Enough with the retail crap!\" said Donna Pinte, a Clifton High School graduate currently living in Wayne. She advocated the construction of a dog park to be used in tandem with Nash Park.\nOne former resident said the CVS approval is an example of the City \"pushing\" small businesses out of Clifton.\nSeveral stakeholders floated the idea of low-cost, senior housing as a fit for the empty lot.\nAnother local resident had hoped a new restaurant would pick up where Lee's tiki bar and restaurant left off.\nJoseph Jaworski, an engineer representing the retailer, said the store's hours run from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. Monday through Saturday and from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. on Sunday.

The beat was partly from lower-than-expected taxes in the third-quarter. \n\n© Copyright 2016 Bloomberg News. All rights reserved. Click Here to comment on this article Close ",

Strepay said the damage to the building was \"significant.\" \n- Monica Vendituoli",

      "text": "CVS Health ( CVS ) sank to a more than two-year low Tuesday after the drugstore giant and pharmacy-benefit manager cut full-year and 2017 EPS guidance, saying it expected to lose more than 40 million retail prescriptions next year amid tougher competition.\nCVS Health cut its full-year 2016 EPS target to $5.77-$5.83 from $5.81-$5.89. Analysts had expected $5.85.\nIn cutting 2016 guidance, company said that \"very recent pharmacy network changes in the marketplace are expected to cause some retail prescriptions to begin migrating out of our pharmacies this quarter.\" It added that \"slowing prescription growth\" and a \"soft seasonal business\" were also hurting.\nThose network changes, CVS said, had \"more significant implications\" for 2017, and the company said it expects retail operating profit growth to decrease. CVS sees 2017 EPS at $5.77-$5.93, far below analyst targets for $6.53.\nThe forecast comes as Walgreens Boots Alliance ( WBA ) tries to lure pharmacy-benefit managers away from CVS with better prices. The landscape could become more difficult if Walgreens and Rite-Aid ( RAD ) merge.\nFor this year's third quarter, earnings per share rose 28% to $1.64, topping views for $1.57. Revenue climbed 15.5% to $44.6 billion, missing estimates for $45.29 billion. Same-store sales increased 2.3%, with pharmacy same-store sales up 3.4%.\nCVS also announced a new $15 billion stock buyback program.\nShares tumbled 11.8% to 73.53 on the stock market today . CVS hit 69.30 intraday, its lowest since early 2014. Walgreens Boots fell 1.7% to 80.09 while Rite Aid surged by 5.4% to 6.86.\nCVS has been investing in its specialty pharmacy business, to provide drugs for rheumatoid arthritis and other chronic conditions and spent $10.1 billion acquisition of Omnicare last year.\nBut shares have suffered since May amid reimbursement rate pressures across the sector, weak earnings and guidance from drug distributor McKesson ( MCK ), and reports that the Justice Department will bring charges against makers of generic drugs for price collusion.\nMeanwhile, CVS hasn't been as invested in the front end of the business, unlike Walgreens, which has revamped its beauty offerings.",

      "text": "A major contract loss hurt CVS this week. EPS - Still expected to hit record levels in 2016 and 2017.\nSlower growth seems overly discounted.\nBad News = Good News for Investors\nBuying high quality shares right after they've sold off sharply on negative news is one of the surest ways to make nice returns.\nThe key to knowing when to be bold or when to stay away comes from examining a stock's own previous trading history when under similar circumstances. CVS Health (NYSE: CVS ) reported better than expected Q3 earnings of $1.64 per share on Tuesday. They simultaneously cut full year estimates slightly, to about $5.80 from $5.85 for 2016.\nThe big surprise came when CVS told analysts that 2017 appeared to be looking like only $5.88 against previous estimates of around $6.50. Boom! The shares plunged to under $70 early, down over 15% from Monday's closing quote and off by almost 39% from last summer's $113.60 peak.\nA quick review of CVS Health's fundamentals was just what the doctor ordered.\nCVS commanded an average multiple of 15.0x along with a 1.37% yield during the six post-recession years from 2010 through 2015. The four 'best buying opportunities' (green-starred below) came with P/Es ranging from 10x to 16x accompanied by 1.30% to 1.60% dividends.\nKnowing what CVS Health's 'normal' looked like makes understanding the drop from 2015's peak quite easy. The shares were quite pricey last summer at about 22x earnings (red-starred) while carrying a somewhat sub-par yield. 2016's pinnacle also suggested the stock was expensively valued.\n\nJust after the opening on Nov. 8, 2016, CVS was offered at $70.48. That represented only 12.1 times this year's already lowered estimate. The dividend sat at an attractive and well-covered 2.41%, the best in modern times for shareholders of this firm.\nThe past six years have been very solid. Tuesday's price showed that the stock price, after the election day fall, had stilled paralleled the rise in CVS's fundamentals (see table below).\nClick to enlarge \nNote that 2010 - 2011 also marked a slow-growth period for CVS. EPS grew just 2.3% and 4.1% year-over-year while the shares trended sideways. Once the profit pace picked back up, CVS ran from about $31 to $72 in under three years.\nCVS Health might tread water for a while but it's likely to have higher revenues, profits and dividends looking out over the next few years.\nWhat is CVS worth today? Applying a normalized 15x multiple to the company's, now flattish, 2016 estimate of $5.88 would justify a 12-month target price of $88. That leaves about 25% upside and appears entirely reasonable. Eighty-eight bucks falls about midway between today's quote and the stock's 52-week peak just north of $106.\nThat goal is far from an upper limit. CVS traded as high as $98.60 back in 2014 on EPS of $4.51. CVS's dividends is up 54.5% since then, providing additional support.\nOption sellers can take advantage of the pullback without trying to call an exact bottom. January 2019 puts at strikes of $70 to $80 were paying juicy premiums on Tuesday.\nI was able to snag $10.60 for the more conservative $70 strike dropping the potential 'if exercised' price to just $59.40. That would establish an implied P/E of just under 10.3x this year's estimate, right in line with the best entry points of 2010-2011.\nClick to enlarge \nFuture share price movement can never be guaranteed. WE do know for sure, though, that CVS hasn't changed hands for less than $60 since 2013. The break-even point on the 2019 LEAP put illustrated would have been profitable 100% of the time over the trailing three years.\nMaximum gains on this, or any other option sale, is keeping 100% of the premium received up front. Those desiring bigger upside might prefer writing the Jan. 2019, $80 put @ around $16 - $17 per share. The 'if put' price drops to $63 - $64 while expanding potential gain to at least $1,600 per contract sold.\nCVS remains a solid bet to be higher a couple of years down the road. Buy the shares, sells some puts or consider doing both.\nDisclosure: Long CVS shares, Short CVS 2018 & 2019 expiration date puts.\nDisclosure: I am/we are long CVS SHARES. \nI wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.
