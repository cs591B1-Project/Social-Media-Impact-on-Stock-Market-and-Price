      "text": "Apple iPhone 7 smartphone sporting ‘Jet White’ colour (Photo: Mac Oktara) The new Apple iPhone 7 models were launched in two completely new colours— Jet Black and Matte Black, apart from the usual Rose Gold, Silver and Gold.\nHowever, since Apple began shipping the new iPhone 7 variants customers witnessed that the supplies of the iPhone 7 are getting exhausted in Jet Black shade . Apple is facing difficulty to manufacture Jet Black units of iPhone 7, reports suggested. Still, Apple is trying to ramp up the production.\nAlso read: iPhone 7 Jet Black variant low on production\nIn fact, according to a Japanese website Mac Oktara , Apple is working on another colour variant for its latest iPhone mode. According to an Apple supply chain the colour variant will be ‘Jet White’, which will be made of same material like the one used to develop Jet Black, except, this time it would be white in colour, reported Mac Oktara.\nThose who are unaware, Apple did confirm that the Jet Black colour is prone to “fine micro abrasions.” Therefore, the Jet White variant will also face a similar issue. Where it is difficult to find a scratch on black colour, the Jet White colour will be more vulnerable, as it is easy to spot a scratch on white colour.\nAlso read: The shortfalls of iPhone 7 smartphone\nHowever, the Mac Oktara has warned readers that the information could be unreliable and should be trusted only after an official statement from the Apple itself.\nAlso read: Apple reveals ‘most advanced’ iPhone 7 series smartphones",

      "text": "InqPOP! Apple Feature Lifestyle Tech Apple makes technology accessible for PWDs in this empowering video Apple makes technology accessible for PWDs in this empowering video Gillan Lasic | November 8th, 2016 \n“People think that having a disability is a barrier.” \nApple does everything to help people with disabilities (PWDs) to prove others wrong. \nCreating new technology should be beneficial not only for some people, but for everyone — including people with disabilities. \nApple launched its new Accessibility site that guides PWD users into understanding technologies of Apple products such as: Mac, iPad, iPhone, Apple Watch, and Apple TV — with features especially designed to make their everyday lives better. Along with the site is a video that features Sady Paulson, a woman with Cerebral Palsy narrating how she sees things different from people who think that having a disability is a barrier. \nThe video opens with Sady getting ready for the day as a woman brushes her hair and helps her put on some clothes. When she gets to her Mac computer, she uses Apple’s Switch Control where she uses the pads on her chair as she shifts her head side to side to navigate through her computer. \nThe video features a blind man who capture photos from his iPhone using image recognition, friends who communicate through sign language via Facetime, a woman who controls her window blinds from her iPhone before she gets to her wheelchair, a schoolboy focuses on his reading as his iPad reads out and highlights words from the screen, and a woman who pushes herself to achieve her wheelchair workout goals with the help of her Apple Watch. \nIt shows how PWDs enhance their everyday lives using their Apple devices — proving how technology can truly be accessible for everyone. \nThen, the video goes into reverse and reveals that Sady has been editing it the whole time using Switch Control on her Mac. \nWith Accessibility, Apple believes that “the most powerful technology in the world is technology that everyone, including people with disabilities, can use.” \nApple also released a second version of the video with audio descriptions.

      "text": "ciderrules \nYou’re doing it wrong. \nYou need to take a page from the lawyers always suing Apple. You need to file your class action lawsuit no more than 10 minutes after you first hear of a potential problem. Dimitri \nTook this long to do it?. It won’t go anywhere as Samsung started the recall September 2nd for the first recall and the last one was October 13th to terminate the Note 7 line and return all of them back. \nSad to see people are doing this for money but the judge will most likely dismiss this as there is no way this persons phone went in fire or exploded.. Second it took them 2 months to do this.. Captain Henry Morgan \nIt is always about the money in the first place. Why would they waste their time going through this. \nI am glad we’re not US because it could get much worst in the land of I’ll sue your “a*s” off. Joh \ncustomers has all the right to get frustrated because the recall of note 7 is very slow in Canada I have contacted Samsung more than a dozen in past 3 weeks but still no luck . they have not yet responded to any of my enquiries. very disappointed. Dimitri \nMost bought their Note 7s from carriers. So it’s only a small % that got it from Samsung. \nThat being said it does seem like Samsung Canada hasn’t done much here. In the end I don’t think Samsung Canada will lose as they did all the steps necessary to cover them. St. Misery \nShameless weasels, I hope they get nothing. If you were injured by an exploding phone, that’s one thing. What are these people suing for, the inconvenience of having to exchange your phone? Get lost. Dimitri \nSo if they do that, that means the millions upon millions have to sue all the companies which do recalls?. \nPeople like this have nothing better to do honestly. They only want money and know because Samsung is going through all this, thing they can get money. Mr_Smoosh \nThe article is not clear on whether the suit is in response to the original phones, or the so-called 2nd wave which were supposed to be fixed. I’d have a little more sympathy if the latter is the case. Dimitri \nYes but it doesn’t matter. A company did a recall and asked all owners to turn the devices in and get their money back or exchange devices. Everyone does that and only one or two people are upset because they had to make a trip down the street to their carrier stores or Samsung store and do it?. Give me a break. We can see it, it’s about the money and nothing else for this person doing the lawsuit. I can guarantee that nothing happened to them other them a emotional trauma that they had to give back their device. Boohoo I say. I had to do 7 recalls on my car due to faulty seatbelt, transmission problems and was without a car for well over 3 weeks. They fixed the problems and got my car back. Very simple. h2oflyer \nIf it’s successful the lawyers will get 60% and the claiments will probably get $29 each. Mo Dabbas \nWhile apple has multiple lawsuits in different countries regarding touch disease, this website remained quiet about it. But when it’s any company but apple, an articles comes out within minutes (see the Financial Post article time and this article’s time). Great job on biased reporting mobilesyrup. \nNow we’ll see Brad commenting here trying to convince everybody that’s not the case. Dimitri \nOh it’s been like this since the Daniel days don’t you remember?. MS has always been like this. They rather not post anything bad about Apple but post stuff like this about all the other companies. \nI believe that of they down talk Apple, they won’t get the tester devices or free devices to give out. Unless they are biased as you said. Jon Duke \nI agree 100% with everything you said. And I’m also waiting for Brad to come argue. It’s my new hobby to contradict him and “it’s me”. Zach Gilbert \nDon’t forget about our community guidelines: http://mobilesyrup.com/mobilesyrup-community-guidelines/ Dimitri \nDo those guidelines get taken seriously by your staff as well? In piticulare Patrick and your ex staff member Daniel? If i recall your staff member Patrick was trolling me and another user a while back and Daniel decided to get added into it. So those guidelines should also be taken seriously by your staff as well. Not just users. It’s Me \nAhh, that makes sense. I was wondering why your replies never make any sense. If you say it’s because you were just trying to be contradictory, facts and reason don’t matter, that helps explain the nonsense. \nThanks. Sunny Lee \nIn their defense, the lawsuit hasn’t been certified yet in Canada, last time I checked. And since this is a Canadian website, they tend to focus on Canada-specific news. \nBut yeah… it’s unfortunate they didn’t report at least that the claim was made against Apple, whereas this Samsung news was reported almost instantly. Dimitri \nThey have done a few articles for lawsuits on another companies outside of Canada plenty of times.. So in reality it’s only Apple they haven’t said anything about and won’t. \nIt seems again MS is Pro Apple and reports anything and everything about other companies instantly it seems. Brad Fortin \nLeave it to Mo to make any non-Apple article all about Apple. \nIf you have suggestions for articles, there is a submission section on this website, and you can contact any of the staff on social media with questions or concerns. It’s Me \nThis story isn’t about Apple? Max Fireman \nAll I wanted was a refund to get another phone. Sh!t happens. Oh well. Shoey5 \nI think people who purchased them second hand or through unauthorized means have a case as I don’t think it’s easy for them to return the units. As well as people who may have purchased accessories they can’t return. The rest of the users don’t really have a case as they would have to prove Samsung new about the flaw, they got their money back/exchange and some and (I’m assuming) rest of their arguments are (probably) covered in the disclaimer no one ever bothers to read. southerndinner \nThis’ll be tossed in no time. Vito R. \nYou think? They sold a phone that catches fire – they then said it was safe and the new ones caught fire too. \nAll a class action suit means is that a bunch of people are suing because of the same thing – not that they’re going to get a million dollars each. \nI don’t think this will get thrown out and I think Samsung will settle – probably for lawyers fees and a few hundred bucks off a new phone. Jon Duke \nThat moment you realize your country is more stupid than the US.. Smh Haseeb S \nI have been back and forth with Samsung from last 5 weeks to have my phone replaced for even Samsung S7 or S7 Edge , but since I bought this phone from a third party and don’t have proof of purchase, they are giving me hard times, no one even got back to me in 5 weeks. Every time I call them , they have a new story for me ” its been escalated, its been taken care, blah blah. where I have been a loyal customer of Samsung from last 10 year and I bought this phone for $900 which is my 2 weeks pay. Phone has been sitting in my drawer for 5 weeks, and I don’t even have a phone because I spent all my money on this.So what I bought this phone from third party, it doesn’t change a thing. it still Samsung’s product and they need to take care of this. but nope who cares stevedion \nI’ve had the same experience, just last Friday they sent me the return box after more than a few calls. The entire saga has been really badly handled. At least we got to keep the accessories and got the free pre-order gift (in my case at least). Haseeb S \nWere you asked to email the info on “enrsupport@samsung.com” or did you provide them info over the phone ? stevedion \nI emailed it to them after they contacted me about a few rants on twitter that I had done. Also I told them I was going to email about my issues. Apparently CBC has some sort of dossier they are putting together. Troll \nYeah thats BS, Samsung got the money for that device regardless of where you purchased it. They should reimburse the current owner of the device no matter what. Samsung deserves to be sued. Earthman \nHow do you get the attention of big business?Punch them in the wallet.Why so many issues with smart devices recently?Is this bad design? or by design?Peace. thomas nguyen \nI think it’s over design in a specific format that caused more and more issues. The manufacturer are trying to fit in more and more stuff into a smaller and smaller form factor. gommer strike \nWhy is this necessary? \nSamsung has already issued the recall and this is not news. What’s with the class action lawsuit? Return the phone, get a refund or get a different phone. Simple. Dimitri \nThe person feels the need to get money somehow. So this is one way of doing it. The person and the lawyer may not understand things so they think a lawsuit will be best. Unfortunately they will lose as Samsung Corporation has taken all precautions and has done all to get people to turn their phones off and back to the Samsung or carriers. Unfortunately the ones that still use them are either ones that bought them from a third party site or don’t want to give them up. Also some may think because they have to get another device, they have the right to sue. So the thousands and thousands of customers which deal with recalls on foods, cars and every electronic system that has been recalled should sue too?.",

      "text": "InqPOP! Apple Feature Lifestyle Tech Apple makes technology accessible for PWDs in this empowering video Apple makes technology accessible for PWDs in this empowering video Gillan Lasic | November 8th, 2016 \n“People think that having a disability is a barrier.” \nApple does everything to help people with disabilities (PWDs) to prove others wrong. \nCreating new technology should be beneficial not only for some people, but for everyone — including people with disabilities. \nApple launched its new Accessibility site that guides PWD users into understanding technologies of Apple products such as: Mac, iPad, iPhone, Apple Watch, and Apple TV — with features especially designed to make their everyday lives better. Along with the site is a video that features Sady Paulson, a woman with Cerebral Palsy narrating how she sees things different from people who think that having a disability is a barrier. \nThe video opens with Sady getting ready for the day as a woman brushes her hair and helps her put on some clothes. When she gets to her Mac computer, she uses Apple’s Switch Control where she uses the pads on her chair as she shifts her head side to side to navigate through her computer. \nThe video features a blind man who capture photos from his iPhone using image recognition, friends who communicate through sign language via Facetime, a woman who controls her window blinds from her iPhone before she gets to her wheelchair, a schoolboy focuses on his reading as his iPad reads out and highlights words from the screen, and a woman who pushes herself to achieve her wheelchair workout goals with the help of her Apple Watch. \nIt shows how PWDs enhance their everyday lives using their Apple devices — proving how technology can truly be accessible for everyone. \nThen, the video goes into reverse and reveals that Sady has been editing it the whole time using Switch Control on her Mac. \nWith Accessibility, Apple believes that “the most powerful technology in the world is technology that everyone, including people with disabilities, can use.” \nApple also released a second version of the video with audio descriptions.",

      "title": "Apple's New USB-C/Thunderbolt Adapters Are Extremely Unreliable",
      "text": "Apple's New USB-C/Thunderbolt Adapters Are Extremely Unreliable 0 11 Comments \nApple has been causing controversy within the world of \"working professionals\" after releasing the new Macbook Pro laptops and replacing all old ports including USB, HDMI, power, and MiniDisplay, with Thunderbolt 3 ports. To use almost any accessory with your laptop you'll now need to buy a dongle... but the dongle doesn't even work. \nToday I was pointed to a video review of the new Macbook Pro 13 that appeared to be filmed in real time, without any editing. The video shows the Macbooks internet dropping out when different dongles are used, it shows the HDMI signal flickering, it shows the USB slot turning on and off, and it shows the entire computer lagging, so much so that the mouse movements aren't even smooth. \nAfter watching this video I assumed that something was wrong with this guys particular laptop or his particular dongle but if you head over to Apple's website you can see the reviews of their dongle. It very well may be the lowest rated product ever made by Apple. \nThe only issue it that i use it to connect a wacom tablet to my 12\" inch macbook, and there is a lag on the tablet, which wacom support says is because of the adapter. \nThis adapter is making the monitor flicker. If you move the MacBook or the cable my a millimeter the connection fails. \nHDMI connections have bad problems with flickering. Can crash the laptop when waking from sleep. \nIf you do decide to call support, expect to be on the phone for an hour only to be told \"try plugging it into another port\" on your single port usb-c macbook... \nFor both adapters, frequent restarts are necessary to get a USB peripheral to be recognized. Unplug from the charger, plug in the adapter and a USB HD, and nothing. Restart the computer and there it is. Until you sleep the computer, that is. Restart again!! \nI tried several less expensive adaptors but were all junk and would not properly work via HDMI connection. So I decided to splash the cash and get the Apple one assuming you'll need to pay a premium for this to work. Unfortunately it was the same scenario. \nI have had it for 4 days now and the USB connection to my keyboard and mouse has become intermittent. \nI've gone through 3 of these already, on the first 2, the charge-thru didn't work, so I couldn't use it with a second peripheral. Now the 3rd has stopped working reliably. \nHopefully this is simply a software issue that can be fixed but many fear that this is an issue with USB-C/Thunderbolt in general. It's not just this particular dongle that has negative reviews. And as we can see from the video, these adapters appear to work on other laptops just fine. O ther dongles and adapters seem to have similar issues as well which either means the market is flooded with unreliable adapters or there is something unreliable about USB-C in general. Hopefully Apple will come out with a fix soon. Posted In:",

      "text": "Apple could add 'Jet White' option for iPhone 7 & 7 Plus: rumor  16   Apple is planning to add a \"Jet White\" color option for the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus , a rumor claimed on Monday, November 7, according to AppleInsider. \nThe information was shared with Japanese site Macotakara by supply chain sources. The site itself, however, suggested that the information could be unreliable, and didn't mention when the change might take place. \nThe glossy Jet Black color has so far proven popular with iPhone 7 buyers, despite it being prone to scratching and scuffing. It can still take weeks for a Jet Black model to ship from Apple's U.S. online store —between 3 and 5 weeks in the case of 7 Plus buyers. \nA Jet White phone could prove equally as popular. Apple hasn't sold an iPhone with a white back since the iPhone 5c though, and the company typically avoids introducing new colors in the middle of a product cycle. \nThe Jet Black phone is also more complicated to make, as it requires a nine-step anodization and polishing process. Adding a second \"Jet\" color could be too much, but might be feasible once iPhone 7 demand has cooled somewhat. Related links:",

      "text": "  According to a recent report coming out of Japan, Apple may prepare a jet white version of the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus . The popular Macotakara blog recently wrote , that according to suppliers, Apple may have plans to release a glossy white version of the iPhone as well. The fact, that the jet black color option is the most successful color option of the iPhone series by far certainly favors that rumor. However, in the whole of iPhone history, Apple never released a new color option after the release, as 9to5Mac reports , so this move would certainly be unusual for Apple. Also, the jet black version is more difficult to produce than the other colors. Apple even warned buyers about potential abrasions and recommends to use a case. Still, holiday season is coming soon, so Apple may want to offer an additional incentive for potential buyers. Treat the rumor with a grain of salt!  ",

Digitimes reports that Apple is upping component orders for the new MacBook Pros, expected to continue at least until the end of 2016. Apple is apparently “optimistic” about fourth quarter sales. \nThe new 13-inch MacBook Pro and 15-inch MacBook Pro feature high-speed Thunderbolt 3 USB-C ports, faster SSDs, Skylake processors, better GPU options, larger trackpad and an OLED display ‘Touch Bar’ touchscreen panel to replace the physical row of function keys. \nApple is also selling a cheaper new 13-inch MacBook Pro that does not include the Touch Bar but includes the other upgrades, which Apple seems to be positioning as a higher-tier model of the MacBook Air. All new Pros are thinner and lighter with new chassis designs. \nThe Digitimes report backs up Phil Schiller’s public statement that early orders for the new MacBook Pro have bested all previous pro Apple notebook launches in online sales. \nThe supply chain report says Apple originally intended to launch the new laptops in the previous quarter but had to delay the release due to low production yields of hinges, batteries and keyboards. Now that the product has been unveiled, Apple is ramping orders significantly which is a strong indication of positive customer reception. \nThe new MacBook Pro design has been widely criticised in the community because of three main reasons: higher prices, the lack of traditional USB-A ports and the inability to upgrade the internal RAM above 16 GB. Although the negativity does not seem to be impacting sales, the customer response provoked Apple to lower USB-C adaptor/dongle prices . Apple SVP Marketing Phil Schiller also confronted some of the criticisms in a newspaper interview. \nThe (non Touch Bar) 13 inch MacBook Pro has been available for just over a week but the Touch Bar models have not arrived in customer’s hands. Delivery estimates for the hotly-anticipated Touch Bar MacBook Pros indicate a launch around November 15th. On the Apple Online Store, Touch Bar MacBook Pros are backordered by more than a month. Digitimes expects to see Mac laptop revenue growth through the end of the year and 2017. Guides",

      "text": "Apple continues to shear its sheep :pimphand: — Drew Breunig (@dbreunig) October 28, 2016 In a surprise move, Apple is slashing prices on its dongles and accessories. The news follows complaints from potential shoppers that the new MacBook Pro laptop isn't compatible with current device accessories. Apple's (AAPL, Tech30) suite of new MacBook Pro computers, which was announced last week, only include USB-C and Thunderbolt 3 ports. This means even new iPhones can't plug into new MacBook Pros without an adapter. To use MacBook Pros with existing accessories, people need to buy adapters, and the cost adds up. Apple is attempting to placate some critics with an unusual pivot on pricing. Related: Apple has the 'courage' to eliminate headphone jack As listed on the website, price cuts include $10 off its USB-C to traditional USB adapter, which now costs $9. It also lowered the price on its Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 2 adapter from $49 to $29. The discounts are available through the end of the year. While it's possible to purchase low-cost adapters on Amazon and elsewhere around the web, official Apple adapters are generally better quality and more reliable than the cheaper products offered online. The MacBook Pro isn't the only new Apple product product flooded with criticism for its dongle and accessory requirements. slim_d20",

      "text": "Apple said to be 'aggressive' in ordering MacBook Pro units, strong sales expected through 2017 By Tuesday, November 08, 2016, 05:02 am PT (08:02 am ET) Apple is said to be bullish on sales prospects for its long-awaited MacBook Pro update, placing significant orders with suppliers through the end of the year and into 2017, according to a new supply chain report. Citing its usual supply chain sources, DigiTimes reported this week that Apple has been \"aggressive\" in placing orders for new MacBook Pro models. The report characterized Apple as \"optimistic\" about holiday quarter sales, and that the company expects those high levels to continue into 2017. Sources said that wasn't always the case— initial orders for the MacBook Pro weren't as strong. Apple was even said to have delayed orders for the MacBook Pro by a quarter due to low yield rates on some components. Specifically, hinges, battery and keyboard were also said to be problem parts. MacBook Pro shipments for 2016 are expected to reach 15 million units, with Apple maintaining that pace next year as well, supply chain insiders predict. Apple has already dynamic Touch Bar , an OLED display strip that sits above the keyboard and replaces the function keys. Apple began charging customers for the new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar on Monday, suggesting shipments could begin soon. The core model is priced starting at $1,799. Topics:",

Dongles.\nJason Skidmore/YouTube screenshot by Chris Matyszczyk/CNET When new Apple products come along, many so-called experts express their views.\nBut what about the insiders?\nWhile Apple's executives do interviews to explain the official company line, those who know the secrets are left to sit in silence.\nExcept for one intrepid Apple engineer. The Spanish one who laughs all the time. (Okay, he's not really an Apple employee, but his laugh is just what Silicon Valley needs.)\nYou might remember him from last year, when he revealed that Apple's engineers forgot to put in more than one port on the new MacBook.\nNow that the MacBook Pro has emerged, to a mixed reception , he's back.\nIn a new parody video , he explains that CEO Tim Cook angrily walked into the Laptop Division's office.\n\"He said...'iPhone division is generating way more income than laptops .'\"\nThe engineers knew they had to please him. Finally, a genius offered: \"Remove all the ports and sell them as dongles.\"\nAnd there a great (profit-making) idea was born.\n\"Maybe we should get rid of the keyboard and sell a dongle for that,\" mused the giggling engineer. That would be something.\nApple now sells many dongles . Some calculate it's 17. I got up to 19. Indeed, the company may have been surprised at the backlash after the MacBook Pro launch, as it decided to reduce the price of its dongles to assist in assimilation.\nMore Technically Incorrect Obama laughs at Trump for losing his Twitter privileges Benedict Cumberbatch mocks Apple in 'cool toilet' SNL ad Apple's new iPhone 7 ad drowns us in confusion Jason Skidmore, who made this video, explained on YouTube that he isn't anti-Apple.\n\"I actually made this video on my pre-2016 MacBook,\" he said. \"In my view it was a mistake to go USB-C only.\"\nHis masterwork, which was posted November 2, has already been viewed more than 1 million times on YouTube.\nAs for the laughing Apple engineer, he admitted he's finally quitting.\nHe's starting a dongle company.",

But all that changed on Monday when Google announced a major update for Android Auto, version 2.0, that enables the in-car entertainment system on supported Android devices and tablets.\nIt is a boon for folks with older rides. Previously, you could only get Android Auto in one of two expensive ways: buying a new car that had it built into the factory stereo, or buying and installing a pricey head unit yourself. “[We] know there are millions of older cars on the road that are not compatible with Android Auto, and many don’t have a screen at all,” Gerhard Schobbe, Android Auto’s project manager, wrote in a blog post . “We wanted to bring the same connected experience to these drivers too.”\nRelated: Android Auto review\nThe new Android Auto client, which supports phones running Android 5.0 or newer, provides access to much the same interface as the one on high-end head units. It is hardware agnostic, Google said, meaning it will work regardless of whether or not you have a certain car display or mount. It launches automatically when your phone is paired to your car via Bluetooth. It will include enhanced hands-free voice commands, which include improved accessing features in Google Maps, music, and messaging apps, that Google said will launch in the coming weeks.\nFor the uninitiated, the Android Auto experience centers around the home screen, which shows three cards containing the most relevant bits of information at any given moment. If you receive a phone call or text, you will see the content of the message. If there is a road closure ahead, you will see detour details. And if there is inclement weather projected for your trip, you will receive an alert.\naav_home_day_framed_q5jr89i-width-2000 More Apps are the other half of Android Auto’s equation and the platform is practically overflowing with them. They are informally divided into categories. Navigation apps include Maps, which provides turn-by-turn directions with distances, ETA to destinations, voice prompts, and pop-up notifications about upcoming lane switches and turns. Among the music apps are Google Play Music, Spotify, iHeart Radio, TuneIn, Joyride, Stitcher, podcast player Pocket Casts, and NPR One, all of which show album artwork and playback controls. Communication apps comprise Android Auto’s built-in messaging client, which let you send texts and initiate calls with voice. Voice apps — principally Google’s autonomous assistant, Google Now — provide navigational assistance, allowing you to launch apps, begin music playlists, pull up directions, get the local temperature, and even learn about the elevation of nearby geographic features all by shouting commands.\nRelated: Kia offers Apple CarPlay and Android Auto for cars new and old\nAndroid Auto on any old smartphone or tablet will not necessarily deliver the same experience as an integrated head unit. Hyundai, for instance, recently introduced MyHundai, an Android Auto app that provides access to Hyundai Roadside Assistance, monthly vehicle reports, maintenance alerts, and a Valet mode that notifies you if your car exits a pre-determined boundary. But it provides a pretty good approximation of the experience on head units and new cars. Considering it is free, perhaps that is good enough.\nGoogle said more than 200 new car models from 50 brands now support Android Auto. The most recent to climb aboard include, Kia, which recently added Android Auto as a free software update on cars spanning model years 2014 through 2017, and Hyundai, which rolled out the platform as part of an update for certain models of the carmaker’s Genesis, Elantra GT and Tucson, and Santa Fe.\nHands on: Navdy car dashboard projector",

      "text": "Apple hasn't yet managed to keep up with iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus demand, suggesting that the company's new iPhones are a hit. In fact, iPhone sales in the September quarter came in slightly higher than Wall Street was expecting, even though supply of both new models was severely constrained. But even though Apple's iPhone 7 and 7 Plus have been so far, demand for next year's new iPhones is expected to dwarf this year's models thanks to a massive iPhone redesign that Apple fans have been waiting for. As exciting as next year's new iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus sound, however, new evidence suggests that Apple is working to bring an exciting new feature to its iPhone lineup that could be the biggest smartphone game-changer the world has seen since the first iPhone was released nearly a decade ago in 2007.\n\n(more…) Trending right now: \nHey Apple, why are you trolling us? OnePlus is officially releasing an even faster smartphone What happens if today’s Presidential election ends in a tie? ",

      "title": "Now you don't have to buy a fancy new car just to get Android Auto",
      "text": "Android Auto began as Google’s answer to Apple’s CarPlay: in-car entertainment software that would play nicely with your phone. It provided seamless access to car-optimized apps like Google Play Music, Maps, Pandora, and useful real-time information like traffic incidents and weather. Since Android Auto’s launch nearly a year ago, though, it has been relegated to expensive new cars. But all that changed on Monday when Google announced a major update for Android Auto, version 2.0, that enables the in-car entertainment system on supported Android devices and tablets.\nIt is a boon for folks with older rides. Previously, you could only get Android Auto in one of two expensive ways: buying a new car that had it built into the factory stereo, or buying and installing a pricey head unit yourself. “[We] know there are millions of older cars on the road that are not compatible with Android Auto, and many don’t have a screen at all,” Gerhard Schobbe, Android Auto’s project manager, wrote in a blog post . “We wanted to bring the same connected experience to these drivers too.”\nRelated: Android Auto review\nThe new Android Auto client, which supports phones running Android 5.0 or newer, provides access to much the same interface as the one on high-end head units. It is hardware agnostic, Google said, meaning it will work regardless of whether or not you have a certain car display or mount. It launches automatically when your phone is paired to your car via Bluetooth. It will include enhanced hands-free voice commands, which include improved accessing features in Google Maps, music, and messaging apps, that Google said will launch in the coming weeks.\nFor the uninitiated, the Android Auto experience centers around the home screen, which shows three cards containing the most relevant bits of information at any given moment. If you receive a phone call or text, you will see the content of the message. If there is a road closure ahead, you will see detour details. And if there is inclement weather projected for your trip, you will receive an alert.\naav_home_day_framed_q5jr89i-width-2000 More Apps are the other half of Android Auto’s equation and the platform is practically overflowing with them. They are informally divided into categories. Navigation apps include Maps, which provides turn-by-turn directions with distances, ETA to destinations, voice prompts, and pop-up notifications about upcoming lane switches and turns. Among the music apps are Google Play Music, Spotify, iHeart Radio, TuneIn, Joyride, Stitcher, podcast player Pocket Casts, and NPR One, all of which show album artwork and playback controls. Communication apps comprise Android Auto’s built-in messaging client, which let you send texts and initiate calls with voice. Voice apps — principally Google’s autonomous assistant, Google Now — provide navigational assistance, allowing you to launch apps, begin music playlists, pull up directions, get the local temperature, and even learn about the elevation of nearby geographic features all by shouting commands.\nRelated: Kia offers Apple CarPlay and Android Auto for cars new and old\nAndroid Auto on any old smartphone or tablet will not necessarily deliver the same experience as an integrated head unit. Hyundai, for instance, recently introduced MyHundai, an Android Auto app that provides access to Hyundai Roadside Assistance, monthly vehicle reports, maintenance alerts, and a Valet mode that notifies you if your car exits a pre-determined boundary. But it provides a pretty good approximation of the experience on head units and new cars. Considering it is free, perhaps that is good enough.\nGoogle said more than 200 new car models from 50 brands now support Android Auto. The most recent to climb aboard include, Kia, which recently added Android Auto as a free software update on cars spanning model years 2014 through 2017, and Hyundai, which rolled out the platform as part of an update for certain models of the carmaker’s Genesis, Elantra GT and Tucson, and Santa Fe.\nHands on: Navdy car dashboard projector Lynk & Co isn’t just a new car brand, it’s a new way of thinking about transportation Roger 2.0 turns your phone into a walkie-talkie with push-to-talk TalkHeads",

It’s significant because, according to 9to5Mac , it includes the TV app that Apple debuted at its MacBook Pro event last month. It’s a new way for Apple TV users to see what’s on and instantly start watching.\nAnd it considerably adds to iOS 10, which first became available to everyone in September . \nOther new features that come with iOS 10.2 public beta 2 include more emojis, new wallpapers for the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, the ability to enable star ratings again through Apple Music’s settings, and the ability to hit the power button five times to trigger the SOS feature, according to 9to5Mac. There are also larger buttons for shuffle and repeat in Apple Music, according to MacRumors .\nAt last month’s event, Apple said the TV app would launch in December. So if you can’t wait till then, you can install this beta, if you’re already a member of Apple’s Beta Software Program, or you can sign up now, free of charge, here .\nGet more stories like this on Twitter & Facebook ",

( Macrumors reports the new feature will be available in the US, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Hong Kong, India, Italy, Japan, Russia, Spain and the UK.)\nSOS does include a short countdown before the call goes through and calls also trigger a siren, which should help avoid accidental calls. You can also choose to disable the feature in the main Settings app. Here's what the feature looks like in action:\n🚨New \"SOS\" emergency calling feature in the latest iOS 10 beta 🚨 pic.twitter.com/lPRPfQfzYJ \n— Karissa Bell (@karissabe) November 8, 2016 \niPhones have included emergency calling from the lock screen for years but the new feature gives iPhone owners an additional way to make a call should they get into trouble and are not able to use emergency feature from the lock screen or make a call normally. \nIt's hard to say when the feature will roll out more widely. For now, SOS is only available to develoeprs who have the iOS 10.2 Beta 2 update installed, but the feature should make its way to the public iOS beta next before eventually becoming part of an official iOS 10 update.",

      "text": "How to Use Siri to Control Your Philips Hue Lights \nThanks to Apple’s HomeKit home automation system and the versatility of Siri, you can now control your home lighting with nothing but your voice. Read on as we demonstrate this using Philips Hue. \nIn order to control your smart home lighting you need a handful of things. First and foremost, you need an iOS device that both runs Siri and is updated to at least iOS 8.1 or above for HomeKit support. RELATED ARTICLE What’s the Difference Between 1st- 2nd-, and 3rd-Generation Philips Hue Bulbs? \nYou’ll also need a HomeKit-enabled light system. For demonstration purposes we are using the Philips Hue 2nd-generation system (which features an updated bridge that supports HomeKit). \nNote: If you were a Hue early adopter you can keep your existing Hue bulbs but you will need to upgrade your 1st-gen Hue Bridge to a 2nd-gen model. How to Set Up Siri Control for Philips Hue RELATED ARTICLE How to Reset Your HomeKit Devices and Configuration \nMake sure you set this up on the iOS device in your household that the owner/parent/person in control of the home automation stuff uses and is logged into, since HomeKit is linked to your iCloud login. You wouldn’t want to use your child’s iPad to set up your HomeKit settings (if that child has their own iCloud ID), because then you’d always need to return to their iPad to make changes and you would have to share their HomeKit configuration with your other devices (instead of you, the controlling agent, sharing the HomeKit setup with them). If you do accidentally set up your HomeKit system under the wrong Cloud ID, don’t panic, Simply reset the HomeKit configuration on the device you erroneously used to setup your system. \nTo link the Hue Bridge to HomeKit and enable Siri control, start by opening up the Hue app and tap the settings button in the upper-left corner of the screen. \nFrom there, select “Siri voice control”. \nAt the bottom, tap on “Pair bridge”. \nIf you haven’t yet set up HomeKit, you’ll be prompted to create a “home” and name it whatever you want. Hit “Create home” when you’re done. \nNext, you’ll be prompted to scan the number on the back of the Hue Bridge unit, but you can also manually enter in the number by tapping on “Enter Code Manually”. Since my Hue Bridge is all the way downstairs (as are most of my other hubs), I have the codes written down on my computer and I just type them in manually, which is easier and quicker than running all the way downstairs just to scan the number. \nOnce you scan or enter in the code, it will take a few seconds to pair it. Once it’s done, you’ll be taken the the Siri voice control screen where you can manage which lights, rooms, and scenes you want to use with Siri, and which ones you don’t. Some may not sync with Siri properly, and you’ll get an orange dot off to the right. Tap on that to fix it. \nFrom there, tap on the check boxes next to the rooms that have orange exclamation points to fix the sync. However, if you don’t want these rooms connected to Siri, you can just leave them be. \nOnce you’re done, go back to the previous screen and tap “Done” in the top-right corner to save changes and finalize the Siri voice control. \nDifferent HomeKit-enabled systems and apps will have different methods of selection, but the general rule is that you can always select groupings (called scenes, rooms, or zones depending on how they are organized within the app) and/or individual components of the system like the separate light bulbs or fixtures. How to Control Your Lights \nOnce you’ve gone through the hassle of setting up the physical system and jumped through the minor hoop of linking the Hue app to your HomeKit system, it’s just a matter of kicking back and issuing commands to Siri. \nOne important note before we proceed, some names can be tricky for Siri because they are part of other common commands. Siri, for example, desperately wants to parse out names and dates into contact actions and calendar actions. \nAs such, it’s just asking for a headache to name the bedroom lamp on your spouse’s side of the bed “Nicole Lamp” because half the time you say “Nicole” in a voice command Siri will want to do something related to Nicole’s contact information. The same goes for any words that sound like they’re related to calendar actions (today, tonight, Tuesday, you get the idea). Siri is way happier when your potential commands are very clear. Naming a scene “Movie Mode” or just “Movies” is much safer, because it is very unlikely to cause any Siri-related confusion. \nWith that in mind, you can use the following commands to communicate with Siri and your Philips Hue light system: “Turn all lights [on/off]” “Turn the [room] lights [on/off]” “Set [scene name] ” Set lights to [X %] brightness” “Set lights [color]” (Hue color bulbs only) “Set scene [scene name]” (adding “scene” to the command works well if you have a scene name that is tripping Siri up) \nThere may be others (Hue’s documentation doesn’t even include all of the above commands), but these are some we’ve tested and confirmed to work. You may discover some others as you experiment.",

      "text": "Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends \nIn September 2014, Apple quietly acquired startup studio Typesoft Technologies, which developed a virtual keyboard called Dryft. While the Swype virtual keyboard ruled the screens on smartphones, Dryft aimed to do the same for tablets, providing a natural typing experience and enabling speeds of up to 100 words per minute on the bigger touch screens. Typesoft co-founder and chief technology officer Randy Marsden eventually moved on to serve as Apple’s iOS keyboard manager after the acquisition, and now Apple officially owns the patent that powers the unique Dryft keyboard. \nThe United States Patent and Trademark Office published on Tuesday a whopping 63 patents recently granted to Apple, one of which is called “ Finger Hover Detection for Improved Typing ” for virtual keyboards. It was originally filed in April 2014, and apparently obtained through Apple’s acquisition of Typesoft. Marsden is listed as one of the inventors along with Rob Chaplinsky, managing partner at the venture capital firm Bridgescale Partners. Apple officially acquired the patent in July despite the patent going public on Tuesday. \nMore: Apple patent could force you to put down your iPhone at “sensitive events” \n“I am hands-on in developing, testing, and debugging the various algorithms used in Dryft that are breaking new ground in human-computer interface technology,” Marsden’s LinkedIn profile reads. “I manage the product specifications and manage the company’s IP and Patent portfolio. My knowledge in developing Dryft solutions ranges from low-level signal analysis of sensor data right up to higher-level algorithms for language models, pattern recognition, and UI design.” \nDryft is actually a virtual spinoff of Marsden’s previous invention, the physical Cleankeys computer keyboard. The peripheral’s biggest selling point was how easily it could be cleaned, targeting health care scenarios and other “clean” environments. The device didn’t provide moving keys, but touch and tap sensors instead that mimicked the physical typing experience on a flat surface. The company aspect of Cleankeys only remained in business for four years before Marsden co-founded Typesoft. \nMarsden’s patent, now owned by Apple, describes a method of providing home-row keys on a virtual keyboard while the user’s fingers hover just above the screen surface. These are a row of keys fingers rest upon when not in motion, thus the invention enables users to type on a tablet surface without having to look at the screen. \n“The location of each of the user’s fingers while hovering and/or resting is monitored,” the abstract states. “Correlation between the hover sensor data and touch sensor data increases the confidence level by which the system can determine which of the user’s fingers were used to select a key. By determining which finger was used to make the selection, the system accurately disambiguates which letter the user intended to type.” \nA provided diagram in the patent (seen above) shows an iPad-type form factor and a user typing on the touchscreen diagonally. The keyboard is split into two sections so that the hands aren’t crammed together on the screen, enabling a more fluent typing experience. Additional notes state that the technology will detect the location of the user’s hands, record the “hand print,” and then readjust the virtual keyboard’s position to reside under the hovering fingers. \nOf course, the patent depends on a tablet packed with hover sensors as well as touch sensors, vibration sensors, and haptics output.

      "text": "Home / News / Mobile Phone News / Apple’s plan to halt slide in iPhone sales? Sell you refurbished ones Apple’s plan to halt slide in iPhone sales? Sell you refurbished ones \n  \nLet’s be real for a second; the new iPhones are bloody expensive, especially for Brits who’ve been screwed over by the post-Brexit vote collapse of the pound . \nLikewise, Apple is dealing with a falling global appetite for its handsets amid more modest hardware improvements over the last two years. \nThese two factors don’t mix well for Cupertino. \nSo, the company has devised a solution that could help all parties; it has stared selling refurbished iPhones online (via VentureBeat ). \nIt is only selling the iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus at the moment and each handset costs 15% less than the asking price for new models. \nApple has long sold refurbished iPads, iPods and Mac computers, but this is the first time it has embraced second hand sales of its bread and butter gadget . \nThe devices come with all the gear you’d expect with a new phone and will feature at least the iOS 9 software they originally shipped with. They’ve been cleaned, inspected, fully tested and fitted with replacement parts if needs be. \nThey also come with a one-year limited warranty. \nRight now the scheme appears to be limited to the US as Apple is yet to update its UK ‘Certified Refurbished’ store . \nIs 15% off a year-old iPhone worth it to you?

      "text": "Apple hasn't yet managed to keep up with iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus demand, suggesting that the company's new iPhones are a hit. In fact, iPhone sales in the September quarter came in slightly higher than Wall Street was expecting, even though supply of both new models was severely constrained. But even though Apple's iPhone 7 and 7 Plus have been so far, demand for next year's new iPhones is expected to dwarf this year's models thanks to a massive iPhone redesign that Apple fans have been waiting for. As exciting as next year's new iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus sound, however, new evidence suggests that Apple is working to bring an exciting new feature to its iPhone lineup that could be the biggest smartphone game-changer the world has seen since the first iPhone was released nearly a decade ago in 2007.\nMUST READ:  Hey Apple, why are you trolling us? \nAccording to a number of solid early reports, next year's iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus are going to feature huge improvements in a number of key areas. First, they'll sport the first big iPhone redesign since 2014, when Apple released the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. Since then, Apple has used roughly the same design on 2015's iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, as well as on the new iPhone 7 series.\nIn 2017, the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus will supposedly feature a fresh new design with a glass front and back that are connected by metal around the edges. The display, which is believed to be an OLED screen for the first time ever on an iPhone, will reportedly take up much more of the iPhone's face thanks to the removal of the home button on the front of the phone. A next-generation Touch ID fingerprint scanner will then be embedded beneath the display, and 3D Touch gestures will take care of the rest of the home button's functionality.\nApple's upcoming new iPhones are expected to feature plenty of other enhancements as well, such as better cameras and a new A11 Fusion processor that is even faster than the A10 Fusion chip in Apple's iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. But mounting evidence suggests that the company is working on the biggest game-changer that the smartphone industry has seen since the very first iPhone was unveiled nearly 10 years ago at the Macworld convention in January 2007.\nWhen someone asks you about your biggest pain point, what's the first thing that comes to mind? Survey after survey suggest that battery life is at the top of most lists. Even the iPhone 7 Plus, which is among the best smartphones in the world when it comes to battery performance , needs to be charged at least once each day. Many phones won't even carry you through a full day of usage without needing to be recharged.\nFast-charging tech is great and current wireless charging solutions are nifty as well, but what if you never had to even think about charging your smartphone again?\nEarlier this year, we turned your attention to some early evidence that suggested Apple was working with a company called Energous to build next-generation wireless charging into future iPhones. When I write \"wireless charging,\" I'm not referring to the technology that's already on the market in a number of Android phones and other devices. This is something completely different, as I mentioned almost two years ago when I first previewed the tech.\nUsing technology developed by Energous, a smartphone or just about any other gadget can be charged wirelessly from across the room. A small chip on the phone's main board connects wirelessly to a base station and can charge a device's battery from distances of 15 feet. In other words, a view strategically placed base stations in your home and office could ensure that your iPhone is charging constantly while it's in use or sitting in your pocket, on your desk or anywhere else.\nAhead of Energous' third-quarter earnings report on Monday, new evidence surfaced that seems to further suggest the company may be working with Apple to build this exciting new technology into iPhones in the near future. I don't need to go back through all of the earlier indications that tie the two companies together, but in a nutshell: Energous has repeatedly stated on earnings calls that it is working with a \"tier 1\" smartphone manufacturer, and all signs in the past have pointed to Apple.\nRead More Now, the company announced that it is has taken a $10 million strategic investment from Dialog Semiconductor, a company that builds power management solutions for consumer electronics. As noted by technology analyst and Disruptive Tech Research founder Louis Basenese, Dialog Semi's top customer is Apple. Energous also took an investment earlier this year from Pegatron, another major Apple partner.\nThe other possible partner that has been tossed around as the mysterious \"tier 1\" smartphone maker Energous keeps referring to is Samsung, but that's looking less likely as time moves on.\n\"According to Bloomberg data, 68.56% of Dialog’s sales come from Apple (AAPL),\" Basenese wrote in a note to investors on Monday. \"The next biggest contributor is Panasonic at 1.23%. Samsung checks-in at a scant 1.03%. So this is another [Energous] partner that is a major AAPL supplier. You’ll recall, Pegatron, which WATT announced as a partner in March 2016, derives 52.98% of sales from AAPL and 0% from Samsung. The evidence in support of APPL as the Tier 1 continues to outweigh evidence pointing to Samsung.\"\nAgain, this is all just speculation until Energous or Apple confirm something. Also, the biggest question surrounding this potential partnership remains unchanged: Why wouldn't Apple simply acquired Energous for peanuts (the company's market cap was about $280 million as of Monday's close, and that was after a big spike from these new rumors) and lock in exclusivity?\nOnly time will tell if these rumors pan out, but don't expect anything to materialize from this supposed partnership in 2017 with the iPhone 8. If and when Apple does add long-distance wireless charging to its iPhone lineup, however, it will be the biggest disruption the industry will have seen in more than a decade.\nTrending right now: \nHey Apple, why are you trolling us?

Image source: Apple.\nThis happens every couple of years; it's just a lot louder this time around.\nIn the wake of Apple 's (NASDAQ: AAPL) release of new MacBook Pros, which were unveiled last month, there has been considerable user backlash surrounding the company's decision to completely transition all input/output jacks to USB-C (Apple's implementation also supports Thunderbolt 3). The criticisms aren't misplaced, as creative professionals looking to upgrade to the newest models will undoubtedly be inconvenienced by the sheer number of dongles and adaptors that they'll need for their daily workflow. The irony is that USB-C's potential as a universal port is precisely why the controversy is magnified this time. Apple isn't just swapping out one old port for one new port -- it's swapping out a handful of old ports for one new port.\nApple's fastest growing product category. pic.twitter.com/d1sel4N5Yc\nDrew Breunig (@dbreunig) October 28, 2016\nMore From Fool.com Motley Fool Founders Issue New Stock Buy Alert Forget GE!

      "text": "  \nSamsung emerges as the market leader in smartwatch makers only after Apple. Currently, Samsung’s Gear smartwatches have been upgraded. The previous version of the smartwatches launched in the market ranked amongst the best performers in Consumer’s Report ratings. \nSamsung’s new Gear S3 class and Gear S3 Frontier costing around $350, is impressive indeed. Retailers have already started accepting pre-order requests, the likes of which include Best Buy, Macy’s, Amazon and at Samsung.com. The watch will formally go on sale Nov. 18. \nThe Classic, whichstaying true to its name’s implications, has a silver-toned, polished-and-brushed-metal finish appropriate for becoming a dress watch, whereas the Frontier, which is mainly matte-black, has the athletic look of a dive watch. \nBoth the watches have round cases that are approximately 1.9 inches wide by 0.55 inches thick. Both of them are composed of high-grade 316L stainless steel and share the same specs and features more or less. Some of the features include a big, 1.3-inch colour watch face. \nAsufficient 380mAh battery accompanied by an accelerometer; a gyro and a heart-rate monitor which comes equipped with a GPS chip for tracking fitness. \nThe Gears also come in with in-built microphone and speaker for conversing with a voice -activated assistant. This enables the wearer to make phone calls when the watch is paired to a handset via Bluetooth. The watches come bestowed with standard 22mm watch bands. \nThe Frontier provides an additional cellular network connection through SIM card that lets it function independently of a phone. One can make and receive phone calls using the Gear S3 alone. The SIM-equipped variety is accessible only from AT&T and T-Mobile. \nWhile not being as water compatible as the Series 2 versions of the Apple Watch, which is capable of swimming at depths of fifty metres for 24 hours. The Samsung’s new Gear smart watches can endure a 30-minute submergence in about 5 feet of water. \nHence proving the point that while, the Samsung watches are not swim watches, but it ought to provide enough peace of mind around sinks and bathtubs . The interface on the Samsung Gear S3 is more or less the same as it was on the S2, which is a good thing. \nWhile many smartwatches need an excessive amount of time swiping and pecking at tiny almost dot-like apps to get what one wants, which is frankly annoying. Like in the case of an Apple Watch, the app collection is clustered together, on what appears to a spider’s egg-sack on the screen. Making any app that is not in the dock harder to get one’s hands on. \nHowever, the S3 has got a rotating bezel, which is like a simple turn around clicking-wheel that lets you access your apps without the unwanted squinting and fumbling. \nSpinning the dial of the bezel lets you quickly get to all the essential functions, such as weather, important contacts, current messages, health stats, and so on. The apps for making calls, altering settings, and opening the app drawer are fairly large and conveniently situated on one screen. \nThe click-wheel also makes it easy to dive deeper into your app drawer, by letting you dial your way to apps on other levels of the interface. You can arrive back at a previous activity by tapping the Back key on the S3’s, which is on its lower right side. The button on the upper right side of the device will always take you to the S3’s clock face or home screen. \nPretty much all smartwatches have on board accelerometers that indicate the screen to wake up when you lift your wrist. This enables you check the time or see other notifications without having to tap the screen. Page 1 of 2 1 2 »",

According to new rumors, the iEmpire is considering a rather unusual move and will release a new color for the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus -- the jet white. More You can’t have ebony without ivory, right? It would appear that Apple is in agreement. According to new rumors, the iEmpire is considering a rather unusual move and releasing a new color for the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus — the jet white.\nWith the jet black and matte black iPhones already on the market, it’s rumored that Apple could be making the glossy white addition. The reports come from Japanese Apple blog Mac Otakara , which does have a pretty good track record of breaking news early and accurately.\nAccording to Mac Otakara, Apple is weighing its options, though there’s been no solid confirmation quite yet of the next steps. If Apple did release a new color, however, it could potentially help its sales, which have already been quite impressive (though Apple adoption as a whole hasn’t been quite as rosy).\nRelated : We took the Google Pixel and iPhone 7 Plus to France for an epic camera shootout\nShould the whispers be true, this would certainly be an unexpected decision from Apple, though not unprecedented. In fact, as Mashable points out, the white iteration of the iPhone 4 came to market nearly a year after the original black model was released. That delay was due to manufacturing challenges, with some outlets reporting that the Home buttons didn’t quite match.\nIn most other cases, Apple has exclusively released new colors upon new launches. For example, the iPhone 5S was the first to have a gold version, whereas the iPhone 6S saw the first rose gold. And the iPhone 5C infamously came with its rather short-lived yet bright plastic color. Remember that blue iPhone?\nIn any case, if a new white version of the iPhone does make its way to the market, it’ll set up more color options for the next iteration of the smartphone. So if you’re holding out for the iPhone 7S or 8, you may be able to select from silver, gold, rose gold, black, jet black, and glossy jet white.\nHow to order the new iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, Apple Watch Series 2, and Nike+ Apple Watch 15 of the best iPhone 7 cases and covers for your shiny new phone",

      "text": "In September 2014, Apple quietly acquired startup studio Typesoft Technologies, which developed a virtual keyboard called Dryft. While the Swype virtual keyboard ruled the screens on smartphones, Dryft aimed to do the same for tablets, providing a natural typing experience and enabling speeds of up to 100 words per minute on the bigger touch screens. Typesoft co-founder and chief technology officer Randy Marsden eventually moved on to serve as Apple’s iOS keyboard manager after the acquisition, and now Apple officially owns the patent that powers the unique Dryft keyboard.\nThe United States Patent and Trademark Office published on Tuesday a whopping 63 patents recently granted to Apple, one of which is called “ Finger Hover Detection for Improved Typing ” for virtual keyboards. It was originally filed in April 2014, and apparently obtained through Apple’s acquisition of Typesoft. Marsden is listed as one of the inventors along with Rob Chaplinsky, managing partner at the venture capital firm Bridgescale Partners. Apple officially acquired the patent in July despite the patent going public on Tuesday.\nMore: Apple patent could force you to put down your iPhone at “sensitive events”\n“I am hands-on in developing, testing, and debugging the various algorithms used in Dryft that are breaking new ground in human-computer interface technology,” Marsden’s LinkedIn profile reads. “I manage the product specifications and manage the company’s IP and Patent portfolio. My knowledge in developing Dryft solutions ranges from low-level signal analysis of sensor data right up to higher-level algorithms for language models, pattern recognition, and UI design.”\nDryft is actually a virtual spinoff of Marsden’s previous invention, the physical Cleankeys computer keyboard. The peripheral’s biggest selling point was how easily it could be cleaned, targeting health care scenarios and other “clean” environments. The device didn’t provide moving keys, but touch and tap sensors instead that mimicked the physical typing experience on a flat surface. The company aspect of Cleankeys only remained in business for four years before Marsden co-founded Typesoft.\nApple virtual keyboard patent More Marsden’s patent, now owned by Apple, describes a method of providing home-row keys on a virtual keyboard while the user’s fingers hover just above the screen surface. These are a row of keys fingers rest upon when not in motion, thus the invention enables users to type on a tablet surface without having to look at the screen.\n“The location of each of the user’s fingers while hovering and/or resting is monitored,” the abstract states. “Correlation between the hover sensor data and touch sensor data increases the confidence level by which the system can determine which of the user’s fingers were used to select a key. By determining which finger was used to make the selection, the system accurately disambiguates which letter the user intended to type.”\nA provided diagram in the patent (seen above) shows an iPad-type form factor and a user typing on the touchscreen diagonally. The keyboard is split into two sections so that the hands aren’t crammed together on the screen, enabling a more fluent typing experience. Additional notes state that the technology will detect the location of the user’s hands, record the “hand print,” and then readjust the virtual keyboard’s position to reside under the hovering fingers.\nOf course, the patent depends on a tablet packed with hover sensors as well as touch sensors, vibration sensors, and haptics output.

      "title": "Apple's new dongle-happy MacBook Pros not fully compatible with Thunderbolt 3 peripherals",
      "text": "Well, this is a touch embarrassing. When Apple unveiled its latest MacBook Pro hardware a few weeks back, it declared that USB-C-compatible Thunderbolt 3 ports (and lots of dongles) were the future of the company’s Mac division. We disagreed with that decision, while acknowledging that yes, Apple does have a long history of sunsetting old standards and introducing new ones ahead of the rest of the industry (whether or not this situation is analogous is a topic we discussed ). Now, news has surfaced that Apple’s newest MacBook Pro hardware may not be compatible with Thunderbolt 3 peripherals already on the market.\nFirst, some context: Thunderbolt 3 is the third iteration of Intel’s Thunderbolt interconnect standard and is the first version of that standard to be physically compatible with USB Type-C connectors. It debuted in early June 2015, and support began shipping with Skylake hardware towards the end of last year. Thunderbolt 3 is used in the external GPU XConnect standard jointly developed by Intel, AMD, and Razer. It’s USB-C compatible (an extremely smart move from Intel) and should be a plug-and-play solution for Apple’s MacBook Pro. After all, Thunderbolt 3 is Thunderbolt 3… right? Apparently, no — not when Apple deploys it.\nAccording to peripheral manufacturer Plugable , Intel’s Thunderbolt 3 standard specifically calls for certain TI chips to handle power delivery and alternate mode negotiation. The chip specified by Intel, and used by Plugable (and possibly the entire rest of the industry) is the TPS65982. It’s described by Texas Instruments as: “a stand-alone USB Type-C and power delivery (PD) controller providing cable-plug and orientation detection at the USB Type-C connector. Upon cable detection, the TPS65982 device communicates on the CC wire using the USB PD protocol. After successful USB PD negotiation is complete, the TPS65982 enables the appropriate power path and configures alternate mode settings for internal and (optional) external multiplexers.”\nAccording to Plugable, none of its existing hardware currently on the market is compatible with the MacBook Pro because OS X expects all devices to use the second-generation TPS6598 3 solution. Here’s how the company describes the problem:\nThe version of OS X on the new MacBook Pros (late 2016) will not work with existing Thunderbolt 3 docks and adapters that were certified for Windows prior to the release of the MacBook Pro. These existing devices use first generation of TI USB-C chipset (TPS65982) in combination with Intel’s Thunderbolt 3 chipset (Alpine Ridge). Apple requires the 2nd generation TPS65983 chipset for peripherals to be compatible. Certification of solutions across different device types is still in-progress for this 2nd generation chipset. From the Plugable product line, our dual display graphics adapters for DisplayPort and HDMI (TBT3-DP2X and TBT3-HDMI2X) are affected… We’ve also postponed our TBT3-UD1 Docking Station to update to the TPS65983 chipset and re-certify to make this docking station MacBook-compatible. Our Flagship TBT3-UDV dock with Power Delivery/Charging was already planned to use the next generation controller chip from TI, and will be compatible with the 2016 Thunderbolt 3 MacBooks.\nPlugable’s Joshua Henry offered some additional information in a follow-up thread response. “The Intel reference design calls for the use of the TI chipset to handle Power Delivery and Alternate Mode negotiation. The Intel Thunderbolt 3 chipsets cannot do this on their own, or if they can, it hasn’t been implemented yet. To our knowledge, all current Thunderbolt 3 products incorporate the TPS65982 chipset into their design and will be incompatible with the new MacBook Pro until new versions with the TPS65983 are released.”\nAnswering compatibility questions We’ve got questions in to Intel about this, but here’s what we know thus far. First, this problem appears to be specific to Thunderbolt 3 peripherals. If you have a Thunderbolt 2 device plugged into a Thunderbolt 3 port via an adapter, it seems to work fine. That limits the amount of hardware likely to be incompatible, since not that many Thunderbolt 3 peripherals have been built yet.\nThe flip side to this, however, is that Apple appears to have asleep at the switch when it comes to the hardware already on the market. It’s one thing to be on the cutting-edge of technology, but declaring that your users are all expected to convert to a new cable standard while simultaneously releasing hardware incompatible with all of the Thunderbolt 3 hardware currently on the market is really, really dumb. What happens to Apple buyers who pulled the trigger on a MacBook Pro and some new Thunderbolt 3 peripherals at the same time?\nWhat makes all of this even stranger is that the hardware Apple isn’t supporting isn’t some random Thunderbolt 3 controller made by a third party. These are chips that are part of Intel’s own reference design for Thunderbolt 3 devices. A little digging on TI’s forums turned up several answers, including one from TI employee Brian Berner: “The TPS65983 is a special product for ThunderBolt 3 devices (for example: hard drives, docks, and monitors) that connect to ThunderBolt 3 hosts (such as tablets, notebooks, and workstations.)” That may be true, but Intel’s own release notes for its Thunderbolt 16.2.52.250 driver, released on 9/30, state: ” Added support for TI TPS65983 PD Controller in SW, SDK API and samples.” Other comments from various places in TI suggest that the TI TPS65983 controller wasn’t available until January 2016 at the very earliest. Development support for the chip was still limited to by request only as of April, and the configuration tools TI offers for other chips weren’t available until the very end of March.\nIn short, the bulk of the evidence suggests that full support for the TPS65983 controller has taken 6-10 months to appear and was only recently added to Intel’s own SDKs. It’s also unclear what the actual difference is between the two chips. I’m certain TI is right when it calls the 983 chip a “special product,” but I’ve paged through the data sheets for the 982 and the 983 and found nothing at all to distinguish them. They have identical circuit diagrams, identical layouts, and once you correct for some small variation in verbiage, identical features.\nHow many people are going to be harmed by this? Probably not very many. Thunderbolt 3 is new, the MacBook Pro is new, and new hardware variants will adopt the 983 chip. Nonetheless, this is something Apple could’ve entirely prevented by either supporting the 982 chip in macOS or simply telling people from stage that only new Thunderbolt 3 peripherals would be compatible with the MacBook Pro. But I suppose it was just easier to call the whole thing “courageous” and leave it at that. This isn’t going to put a shine on the new MacBook Pro systems, and it’s an absurd situation all around. The type of controller chip used inside a peripheral interconnect should be of absolutely no regard to anyone looking for a new laptop. Having to juggle which hardware is compatible with which systems when they all support the same standard is absurd. Hopefully Apple will patch support for the TPS65982 chip into macOS.",

      "text": "For the first time in nearly a decade, Apple is offering its customers the opportunity to get refurbished iPhones.\nThe tech giant this week launched a new sales program for the iPhone, known as the Apple Certified Refurbished store. Customers who head over there will be able to pick up a refurbished iPhone 6s or iPhone 6s Plus. The iPhone joins Apple’s many other products, including Macs, iPods, and other items already on sale in its digital marketplace for refurbished devices.\nThe move is a notable one for Apple AAPL , which has focused most of its retail attention in recent years on selling brand-new devices. While Apple has offered refurbished Macs for years, its online marketplace has only been home to new iPhones. In fact, Apple hasn’t sold refurbished iPhones at retail since the smartphone’s launch in 2007.\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune's technology newsletter \nSelling a refurbished iPhone, however, is in keeping with Apple’s desire to be a leader in electronics recycling and other green initiatives. Apple is investing heavily in recycling programs in hopes of getting its old hardware back from customers. It then decides whether to refurbish the hardware and sell it again or break it down and mine its parts for recycling. The company even has a sophisticated robot, named Liam, that can systematically remove components in devices like the iPhone so they can be reused in other units.\nAlthough there is still a bit of a stigma attached to buying refurbished electronics and some will wonder what might be wrong with the hardware that it needed to be fixed up, some of that fear is unfounded. In many cases, devices are returned to companies for little reason other than the customer didn’t want it after purchase. In other cases, refurbished devices might never have been opened and returned before the owner could even try them out. In those cases, customers are effectively getting a brand-new handset that Apple or any other company simply can’t sell as new any longer.\nGetting a refurbished iPhone also saves folks some cash. Apple’s iPhone 6s has a starting price of $549 when it’s purchased new. Buying a refurbished iPhone 6s from Apple will set customers back $449 to start. On the iPhone 6s Plus side, customers can similarly save $100 or more off the sticker price.\nFor more about Apple MacBook Pro, watch: \nLike brand-new iPhones, the refurbished handsets Apple is selling come with new batteries and outer shells. They also come with a one-year warranty.",

      "text": "Candidate Donald Trump had tough words for Apple. What will President Trump do? Apple’s best hope has to be that a lot of what Trump said was campaign rhetoric. share Getty Donald Trump had some harsh words for Apple during the campaign, but what will his attitude be toward the world’s biggest company now that he is the President-elect? During the campaign, Trump said he would call for a boycott of Apple products if the company didn’t reverse its strong pro-encryption stance. He also criticized the company for not making more of its products in the U.S. Boycott all Apple products until such time as Apple gives cellphone info to authorities regarding radical Islamic terrorist couple from Cal Apple, for its part, distanced itself from Trump. It reversed its longstanding practice and didn’t provide support to this year’s Republican National Convention . CEO Tim Cook told Time in March that he hadn’t talked directly with Trump about the issues. “The way I look at it is, Apple is this great American company that could have only happened here,” he said, speaking about the encryption matter. “And we see it as our responsibility to stand up on something like this and speak up for all these people that are thinking what we’re thinking but don’t have the voice.” He noted at the time that Apple wasn’t the decision maker on this, or other policy matters, but said he felt a calling to stand up to the government. “I mean, too many times in history has this happened, where the government over reached, did something that in retrospect somebody should have stood up and said ‘Stop.’ We see that this is our moment to stand up and say ‘Stop.’” But, in a clearly prescient move, Cook maintained some ties to the GOP, hosting a fundraiser for House speaker Paul Ryan this summer . Tim Cook’s biggest hope has to be that Donald Trump didn’t mean a lot of what he said, and that it was the rhetoric of a politician looking to get elected. “Certainly the tech industry should be rooting against literalism: not only has Trump attacked companies directly, particularly Amazon because of Jeff Bezos' ownership of the Washington Post, as well as Apple for manufacturing abroad, but his trade rhetoric taken to its logical conclusion will hurt Silicon Valley more than almost anyone else,” Stratechery’s Ben Thompson wrote on Wednesday. Another key question — for Apple, in particular — is what a Trump election and presidency does for the economy. Apple, even more than its peers, depends on a healthy economy with consumers that have disposable income to spend on pricey phones, tablets and computers. The silver lining for Apple (and other cash-rich tech companies) is that they may finally get to bring home billions of dollars in profits recorded and stored overseas. And if Trump follows through on plans to lower corporate taxes in general, Apple and other tech companies won't have the same incentive to store cash overseas in the future. Cook has been silent on Twitter since Trump’s election and Apple did not immediately respond to requests for comment. recode_divider",

      "text": "Apple TV? Amazon Prime? Roku? What’s the easiest... | 17 minutes ago | Vote 0 0 Apple TV? Amazon Prime? Roku? What’s the easiest way to get Netflix on your TV Netflix A reader sent a message this week asking about my preferred method for watching Netflix on a TV. Such a simple question. So many different answers. Since they asked, I'm guessing they don't have a smart TV, one with a built-in Netflix app. So we are talking about adding a streaming box to their current TV. For this, you should have an open HDMI port on the TV. Almost all the choices we'll talk about here need to connect to your TV via HDMI. Now we need to ask a few questions that might lead us to a specific box. Do you have any brand allegiances? For instance, do you have Macs (or iPads or iPhones) at home that would make you predisposed to picking Apple TV ($149.99)? Are you a subscriber to Amazon's Prime service? Amazon has a video streaming service that's included in the Prime subscription. The easiest and cheapest way to take advantage of Prime video is through an Amazon Fire TV Stick ($39.99). Roku also makes a full line of streaming devices that can be added to any TV. The easiest and most inexpensive is its Streaming Stick, which is on sale for $39.99 at Roku.com. The Roku has the most video sources, both free and paid, including Netflix. Apple TV is nice. It has a bunch of apps to stream different video services, and it has games, but at such a price premium, I can't recommend it for people who want simple streaming. I should also mention Google's Chromecast ($35), which is a streaming dongle you attach to your TV's HDMI port. It enables you to \"cast\" video playing from your phone or tablet or computer to your TV screen. This means that the device you already have (Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, Chromebook) is the source and Chromecast is the receiver. Casting a show or movie isn't difficult, but it's not the easiest choice. So if all you want is Netflix, the cheapest and simplest way is either Amazon's or Roku's streaming sticks. Of those two, I'd say Roku has a bit cleaner interface. | Join The Conversation Sign Up Login Most Read",

      "text": "How to Get Your Mac’s Esc Key Back by Remapping Caps Lock \nThe touch bar on Apple’s new MacBook Pro makes sense. The top row of keys have served specific functions on Macs for over a decade; why not let those specific functions change depending on which application you’re using? \nBut there’s one key that old-school UNIX users—particularly Emacs fans—are going to miss: Escape. The touch bar completely replaces this key, which is going to make a lot of Terminal-based applications nearly impossible to use. And while the touch bar can add an Esc key when necessary, programmers and others might prefer a physical key while typing. \nGood news: the latest Sierra update lets you re-maps Caps Lock, a key most people never use, to Esc. We’ve shown you how to disable the caps lock key on a Mac , and the process is similar. \nFirst, head to System Preferences, then to Keyboard. \nAt the bottom-right, you’ll see a button called “Modifier Keys.” Click it. \nFrom here you can replace what four keys do: Caps Lock, Control, Option, and Command. \nClick the Caps Lock drop-down. As you can see, Escape is an option. \nSelect it and your Caps Lock key will serve as an improvised Esc key. This will take a little getting used to, but it’s better than not having an alternative. \nThere’s one other downside: if you want to YELL AT PEOPLE, you’ll have to hold down the Shift key. Our official recommendation: only yell at people when it’s worth the effort of holding down the Shift key.",

      "title": "Best Windows alternatives to Apple's new MacBook Pro",
      "text": "Despite the fact that most people have not used one of Apple's new MacBook Pros, there are some creative professionals -- including graphic designers, photographers, and video editors -- who are already disappointed by them . For them, it's all about the specs.\nApple's new machines don't feature the latest Intel and Nvidia processors, don't offer more than 16GB of memory, and ditch nearly all the traditional ports -- including full size USB ports and the SD card reader -- in favor of the new Thunderbolt 3 standard .\nSome pros are even considering a switch to Windows instead. But which PCs are worthy replacements for the MacBook Pro? Here are five Windows laptops alternatives that creative professionals should consider.\nThe Dell XPS 4K Touch comes closest to the 15-inch MacBook Pro in balancing price and specs.\nSarah Tew/CNET The all-around creative The Dell XPS 15 laptop matches up nicely in both price and specs against the new 15-inch MacBook Pro. Its practical design houses a 15-inch 4K display which renders 100 percent of the Adobe RGB color space -- a plus for editing photos or color-correcting videos. Its $1,850 US price tag is another win. Check out our full review of the Dell XPS 15 here .\nAdvantages over the 15-inch MacBook Pro: 4K display, touchscreen, 32GB of RAM and ports including HDMI, Thunderbolt 3, USB 3.0 and an SD card reader.\nDisadvantages: The Nvidia graphics card is not VR ready. The battery life is just okay. And the 15-inch MacBook Pro's design looks better than the clunky wedge-shape of the Dell.\nThe Razer Blade Pro is a 17-inch behemoth that packs power and ports.\nJosh Miller/CNET Photo/video workstation If you are looking for pure power in a laptop, meet the new 17-inch Razer Blade Pro. This computer has pretty much every spec you could ask for: a giant 4K touchscreen with a wide color gamut, loads of ports, the best graphics chip you can get in a laptop, 32GB of RAM and even a scroll wheel! Read our in-depth look at the Razer Blade Pro .\nAdvantages over the 15-inch MacBook Pro: 4K touchscreen, NVIDIA GTX 1080 (8GB) graphics, an SD card slot, 32GB RAM, and a 2TB PCIe SSD (in RAID 0, which means up to twice the read and write speed by combining two drives together).\nDisadvantages: Weight (it's nearly twice the weight of a 15-inch MacBook Pro), price ($3,699 US where the 15-inch MacBook Pro starts at $2,399 US) and it's unable to run Final Cut Pro (which is true of any Windows laptop)\nMicrosoft now sells a Surface Book with a 6th generation i7 processor.\nSarah Tew/CNET Designers and artists Recently, Microsoft announced that it was going to offer a premium version of its Surface Book with an i7 processor. In our review of the Surface Book , we gave \"Archie\" comic book artist Dan Parent some time with the laptop/tablet hybrid. He viewed the Surface Book as a serious contender to replace his Wacom tablet and stylus.\nAdvantages over the 13-inch MacBook Pro: A top-of-the-line Surface Book comes with better (game-capable) graphics, more ports (including an SD card reader) as well as both a touchscreen and the Microsoft Surface pen stylus.\nDisadvantages: A top-of-the-line 13-inch MacBook Pro is cheaper, lighter, smaller and comes with a faster processor and Thunderbolt 3 ports. It can also charge with a standard USB-C power adapter, where the Surface Book still requires a proprietary cable.\nThis 13-inch gaming laptop has a stunning OLED display and new graphics card that supports virtual reality headsets.\nSarah Tew/CNET VR and game developers The new Alienware 13 is basically a 15-inch laptop crammed into a 13-inch body. The quad-core processor, heavy-duty Nvidia graphics chip and particularly the optional OLED display make this an ideal machine for developers previewing HDR game content. You can even buy the optional Alienware Graphics Amp ($199 US) to boost its performance even further. For more on the new Alienware 13 check out our review .\nAdvantages over the 13-inch MacBook Pro: A plethora of ports (Thunderbolt 3, USB-3, HDMI, Mini Display Port), a quad-core processor, 32GB of RAM, 2TB PCIe SSD and Nvidia 1060 graphics.\nDisadvantages: A fully-loaded new Alienware 13 ($3,425 US) costs much more than a top-of-the-line 13-inch MacBook Pro ($2,899 US). It's also nearly 2 pounds heavier and lacks an SD card slot.\nWith an 18 hour battery-life, the ThinkPad T460 is a great all-day work laptop.\nScreenshot by Patrick Holland/CNET Value and battery-life The 14-inch ThinkPad T460 offers a lot for a relatively low price -- a top-specced machine only costs $2,034 US and comes complete with 32 GB of RAM, a touchscreen, and a fingerprint reader. One of the nicest features is the tremendous battery life -- Lenovo claims 18 hours on a charge.\nAdvantages over the 13-inch MacBook Pro: A comfy keyboard, 32GB RAM, touchscreen, price, dual batteries (the rear one is swappable) for tremendous battery life, an SD card reader and an HDMI port.\nDisadvantages: Smaller capacity slower SSDs, average screen resolution, and no Thunderbolt 3 or USB-C ports.\nFinal word It is a great time to buy a computer, even if you're a creative professional. If you were pining for a new MacBook Pro but disappointed by the specs, I'd recommend waiting a bit to read our review on the higher end models with Touch Bar. Specs are just one part of the story. Here's our review of the new baseline 13-inch MacBook Pro without Touch Bar .\nIf your creative workflow allows for a Windows based-machine, these five deserve your consideration. Though, one of the complaints some creative pros had against Apple, was its choice of a 6th generation Intel processor instead of a 7th generation version. All five Windows machines in this article also have a 6th generation Intel processor. So there are some specs, that will take time to make it into our creative machines.\nIf you can't make that jump to a Windows machine, you should also consider last year's MacBook Pro . While the specs are 2015 (which in computer years is old), a top-of-the-line model costs $2,899 US and comes with a 2.8GHz 4-core Intel i7 processor, 16GB of memory, a 1TB SSD and all the ports you're used to (USB-3, SD card reader and Thunderbolt 2).\nTake a look below to compare the specs of the new MacBook Pro against these Windows alternatives -- all specs are for the top-of-the-line model of each computer.\n13-inch MacBook Pro (2016, w/Touch Bar) 13-inch Surface Book (2016) Alienware 13 (2016) 14-inch ThinkPad T460 15-inch MacBook Pro (2016) Dell XPS 15 (2016) 17-inch Razer Blade Pro (2016) 15-inch MacBook Pro w/ Retina display (2015) Price (USD) $2,899 $3,299 $3,425 $2,034 $4,299 $2,650 $3,699 (base price) $2,899 Display 13.3-inch 2,560x1,600-pixel 13.5-inch 3,000x2,000-pixel 13.3-inch 2,560x1,440-pixel 14-inch 1,920x1,080-pixel 15.4-inch 2,880x1,800-pixel 15.6-inch 3,840x2,160-pixel 17.3-inch 3,840x2,160-pixel 15.4-inch 2,880x1,800-pixel Pixel density 227 PPI 267 PPI 221 PPI 157 PPI 220 PPI 282 PPI 255 PPI 220 PPI Dimensions (imperial) 11.97 x 8.36 inches 12.3 x 9.14 inches 15.35 x 10.20 inches 13.35 x 9.15 inches 13.75 x 9.48 inches 14.06 x 9.27 inches 16.7 x 11 inches 14.13 x 9.73 inches Dimensions (metric) 304 x 212 mm 312.3 x 232.1 mm 390 x 259 mm 339 x 232.5 mm 349 x 241 mm 357 x 235 mm 424 x 281 mm 358.9 x 247.1 mm Thickness 0.59 in (14.9mm) 0.51 - 0.90 in (13.0 - 22.8mm) 0.92 in (23.3mm) 0.83 in (21mm) 0.61 in (15.5mm) 0.45 - 0.66 in (11-17mm) 0.88 in (22.5mm) 0.71 in (18mm) Weight 3.02 lb (1.37kg) 3.63 lb (1.65kg) 5 lb (2kg) 3.8 lb (1.7kg) 4.02 lb (1.83kg) 4.4 lb (2kg) 7.8 lb (3.54kg) 4.49 lb (2.04kg) Processor 3.3GHz 2-core Intel Core i7 \"Skylake\" 2.6GHz 2-core Intel Core i7 \"Skylake\" 2.6GHz 4-core Intel Core i7 \"Skylake\" 2.6GHz 2-core Intel Core i7 \"Skylake\" 2.9GHz 4-core Intel Core i7 \"Skylake\" 2.6GHz 4-core Intel Core i7 \"Skylake\" 2.6GHz 4-core Intel Core i7 \"Skylake\" 2.8GHz 4-core Intel Core i7 \"Haswell\" Graphics Intel Iris 550 NVIDIA GeForce GTX 965M (2GB) NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 (6GB) Intel Iris 520 AMD Radeon Pro 460 (4GB) NVIDIA GeForce GTX 960M (2GB) NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 (8GB) Intel Iris Pro / AMD Radeon Pro 450 (2GB) Storage (SSD) 1TB 1TB 1TB SSD (boot) + 1TB SSD (storage) 512GB 2TB 1TB 2TB 1TB RAM 16GB 16GB 32GB 32GB 16GB 32GB 32GB 16 GB Ports 4x Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C connector), 1x 3.5mm headset 2x USB 3.0, 1x Mini Display Port, 1x Surface Connect; 1x SD card reader, 1x 3.5mm headset 1x Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C connector), 3x USB 3.0, 1x Mini Display Port, 1x HDMI, 1x DC Power port, 1x Alienware Graphics, 1x 3.5mm Audio out, 1x 3.5mm headset 3x USB 3.0, 1x SD card reader, 1x HDMI, 1x AC power, 1x Mini Display Port, 1x Ethernet, 1x 3.5mm headset 4x Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C connector), 1x 3.5mm headset 1x Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C connector), 2x USB 3.0, 1x HDMI, 1x AC power, 1x SD card reader, 1x 3.5mm headset 1x Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C connector), 3x USB 3.0, 1x HDMI, 1x SDXC card reader, 1x Ethernet, 1x 3.5mm headset 1x MagSafe 2, 2x Thunderbolt 2, 2x USB 3.0, 1x HDMI, 1x SDXC reader, 1x 3.5mm headset Touchscreen No Yes Yes Yes No Yes Yes No Touch Bar/Fingerprint Sensor Touch Bar and Touch ID No No Finger Print Reader Touch Bar and Touch ID No No No Colors Space Gray, Silver Silver Silver Black Space Gray, Silver Silver Black Silver",

      "text": "by Patrick Holland \nDespite the fact that most people have not used one of Apple's new MacBook Pros, there are some creative professionals -- including graphic designers, photographers and video editors -- who are already disappointed by them . For them, it's all about the specs. \nApple's new machines don't feature the latest Intel and Nvidia processors, don't offer more than 16GB of memory, and ditch nearly all the traditional ports -- including full-size USB ports and the SD card reader -- in favor of the new Thunderbolt 3 standard . \nSome pros are even considering a switch to Windows instead. But which PCs are worthy replacements for the MacBook Pro? Here are five Windows laptops alternatives that creative professionals should consider. \nThe Dell XPS 4K Touch comes closest to the 15-inch MacBook Pro in balancing price and specs. Sarah Tew/CNET The all-around creative \nThe Dell XPS 15 laptop matches up nicely in both price and specs against the new 15-inch MacBook Pro. Its practical design houses a 15-inch 4K display that renders 100 percent of the Adobe RGB color space -- a plus for editing photos or color-correcting videos. Its $1,850 US price tag is another win. Check out our full review of the Dell XPS 15 here . \nAdvantages over the 15-inch MacBook Pro: 4K display, touchscreen, 32GB of RAM and ports including HDMI, Thunderbolt 3, USB 3.0 and an SD card reader. \nDisadvantages: The Nvidia graphics card is not VR-ready. The battery life is just OK. And the 15-inch MacBook Pro's design looks better than the clunky wedge shape of the Dell. \nThe Razer Blade Pro is a 17-inch behemoth that packs power and ports. Josh Miller/CNET Photo/video workstation \nIf you are looking for pure power in a laptop, meet the new 17-inch Razer Blade Pro. This computer has pretty much every spec you could ask for: a giant 4K touchscreen with a wide color gamut, loads of ports, the best graphics chip you can get in a laptop, 32GB of RAM and even a scroll wheel! Read our in-depth look at the Razer Blade Pro . \nAdvantages over the 15-inch MacBook Pro: 4K touchscreen, NVIDIA GTX 1080 (8GB) graphics, an SD card slot, 32GB RAM, and a 2TB PCIe SSD (in RAID 0, which means up to twice the read and write speed by combining two drives together). \nDisadvantages: Weight (it's nearly twice the weight of a 15-inch MacBook Pro), price ($3,699 US where the 15-inch MacBook Pro starts at $2,399 US) and it's unable to run Final Cut Pro (which is true of any Windows laptop). \nMicrosoft now sells a Surface Book with a sixth-generation i7 processor. Sarah Tew/CNET Designers and artists \nRecently, Microsoft announced that it was going to offer a premium version of its Surface Book with an i7 processor. In our review of the Surface Book , we gave \"Archie\" comic book artist Dan Parent some time with the laptop/tablet hybrid. He viewed the Surface Book as a serious contender to replace his Wacom tablet and stylus. \nAdvantages over the 13-inch MacBook Pro: A top-of-the-line Surface Book comes with better (game-capable) graphics, more ports (including an SD card reader) as well as both a touchscreen and the Microsoft Surface pen stylus. \nDisadvantages: A top-of-the-line 13-inch MacBook Pro is cheaper, lighter, smaller and comes with a faster processor and Thunderbolt 3 ports. It can also charge with a standard USB-C power adapter, where the Surface Book still requires a proprietary cable. \nThis 13-inch gaming laptop has a stunning OLED display and new graphics card that supports virtual-reality headsets. Sarah Tew/CNET VR and game developers \nThe new Alienware 13 is basically a 15-inch laptop crammed into a 13-inch body. The quad-core processor, heavy-duty Nvidia graphics chip and particularly the optional OLED display make this an ideal machine for developers previewing HDR game content. You can even buy the optional Alienware Graphics Amp ($199) to boost its performance even further. For more on the new Alienware 13 check out our review . \nAdvantages over the 13-inch MacBook Pro: A plethora of ports (Thunderbolt 3, USB-3, HDMI, Mini Display Port), a quad-core processor, 32GB of RAM, 2TB PCIe SSD and Nvidia 1060 graphics. \nDisadvantages: A fully loaded new Alienware 13 ($3,425) costs much more than a top-of-the-line 13-inch MacBook Pro ($2,899). It's also nearly 2 pounds heavier and lacks an SD card slot. \nWith an 18 hour battery-life, the ThinkPad T460 is a great all-day work laptop. Screenshot by Patrick Holland/CNET Value and battery life \nThe 14-inch ThinkPad T460 offers a lot for a relatively low price -- a top-specced machine only costs $2,034 US and comes complete with 32GB of RAM, a touchscreen, and a fingerprint reader. One of the nicest features is the tremendous battery life -- Lenovo claims 18 hours on a charge. \nAdvantages over the 13-inch MacBook Pro: A comfy keyboard, 32GB of RAM, touchscreen, price, dual batteries (the rear one is swappable) for tremendous battery life, an SD card reader and an HDMI port. \nDisadvantages: Smaller-capacity slower SSDs, average screen resolution, and no Thunderbolt 3 or USB-C ports. Final word \nIt is a great time to buy a computer, even if you're a creative professional. If you were pining for a new MacBook Pro but disappointed by the specs, I'd recommend waiting a bit to read our review on the higher end models with Touch Bar. Specs are just one part of the story. Here's our review of the new baseline 13-inch MacBook Pro without Touch Bar . \nIf your creative workflow allows for a Windows based-machine, these five deserve your consideration. Though, one of the complaints some creative pros had against Apple, was its choice of a sixth-generation Intel processor instead of a seventh-generation version. All five Windows machines in this article also have a sixth-generation Intel processor. So there are some specs, that will take time to make it into our creative machines. \nIf you can't make that jump to a Windows machine, you should also consider last year's MacBook Pro . While the specs are 2015 (which in computer years is old), a top-of-the-line model costs $2,899 US and comes with a 2.8GHz 4-core Intel i7 processor, 16GB of memory, a 1TB SSD and all the ports you're used to (USB-3, SD card reader and Thunderbolt 2). \nTake a look below to compare the specs of the new MacBook Pro against these Windows alternatives -- all specs are for the top-of-the-line model of each computer. 13-inch MacBook Pro (2016, w/Touch Bar) 13-inch Surface Book (2016)",

      "text": "  Apple is Making it Easier to Download Apple TV Apps From an iOS Device or Computer by Brent Dirks November 9, 2016 \nApple is making easier for users to view and download tvOS apps from their iPhone, iPad, or computer. Link time Link time \nYou can view any tvOS apps on an iPhone, iPad, or computer. \nIn a new note posted to the developer center , Apple announced that developers (or anyone else) can now create a link to a tvOS app using the iTunes Link Maker . \nWith the link, users can view tvOS apps on their iPhone, iPad, and through iTunes on a Mac or PC. \nAnyone who has enabled their Apple TV to automatically install apps can download a title directly to their streaming box. \nBefore Apple unveiled the new feature, you could only view a tvOS app if it also was in the iOS App Store. \nSo this new development is great for anyone who uses an Apple TV. Late last month, at the MacBook Pro media event, Apple’s Tim Cook said that there are now more than 10,000 apps available for the fourth-generation device. View Comments Copyright 2016 AppAdvice LLC.

      "text": "For the past several years, Apple has been using LCD screens in its iPhones. Recently, there have been rumors that the Cupertino company is planning to switch to OLED displays for the next-gen iPhone 8 as part of a major design overhaul. Analysts who studied Apple’s latest 10-K filing have found that Apple is going to buy OLED displays in large quantities.\nImage Source: YouTube Apple all set to switch from LCD to OLED with iPhone 8 JPMorgan analysts said in a research note (via Apple Insider ) that Apple has placed multi-billion dollar purchase orders for OLED displays. The orders extend over one year in duration. Though Samsung Display is said to be the largest beneficiary, other companies such as Japan Display and Sharp have also been investing heavily to ramp up OLED display production.\nAnalysts found that Apple had placed purchase orders worth at least $4 billion. The third-quarter 10-K filing has “off-balance sheet obligation” for the same amount. JPMorgan believes that it is related to the sourcing of OLED screens for the iPhone 8. In the past, factors like cost and supply availability might have prevented Apple from using OLED displays in the iPhones. But that is likely to change next year.\nProducing OLED displays is still pretty difficult Apple has also made some changes in its risk related to the component acquisition statement. The tech giant says in its 10-K filing that it might have trouble purchasing certain parts on “commercially reasonable terms.” OLED display production is a complex process. Even minor errors could cause the loss of an entire batch of screens, raising the cost for buyers.\nApple currently uses OLED screens in the Apple Watch, and the new touch bar in the latest MacBook Pro. Reports suggest that the iPhone 8 will have an edge-to-edge display. The fingerprint sensor and home functionality will be embedded in the display itself. The 2017 iPhone is expected to be powered by an A11 Fusion processor.\niPhone 8 may feature AR mapping system Earlier this week, Apple was granted patent for an augmented reality mapping system that uses the smartphone’s hardware and sensors to give users a real-time augmented view of their surroundings. Apple CEO Tim Cook has been bullish on augmented reality, and experts believe that the iPhone 8 could feature AR technology. Cook says AR will eventually become a bigger opportunity than VR.\nThe iPhone 8 is also rumored to feature long-distance wireless charging technology from Energous. Energous’ WattUp technology allows users to charge their devices from a distance of up to 15 feet. Apple’s manufacturing partner Foxconn has been producing and testing wireless charging modules for the iPhone 8. However, the technology will be incorporated in the upcoming iPhone only if Foxconn can improve yield rates to satisfactory levels.\n \nThe post iPhone 8: Apple Inc. Places $4 Billion Purchase Orders For OLED Display appeared first on ValueWalk .\n",

      "text": "Reddit \nAs we approach World AIDS Day in December, Apple today has unveiled new (PRODUCT)RED color variants for the Beats Pill+ and Beats Solo3 headphones. Specifically, Apple is calling the red color “Citrus Red.” The new color options aren’t available just yet, but are currently listed as “coming soon” on Apple’s website. \nThe price points for the (RED) offerings are the same as the normal color variants. The Beats Pill+ in the “Citrus Red” choice comes in at $229.95, while the Solo3 headphones come in at $299.95. \nApple has long partnered with the (PRODUCT)Red charity, originally offering iPods in the bright red color option. The charity works to raise awareness and funds to help eliminate HIV/AIDS around the globe. A portion of the proceeds from sales of (PRODUCT)Red devices goes to the global fund for fighting the disease. \nIn the past, Apple has also worked with the (RED) by donating a portion of total product sales on days such as Black Friday and Cyber Monday to the cause . When you buy (PRODUCT)RED ™ merchandise, you’re supporting the fight for an AIDS-free generation. So far, over $320 million has been raised for the Global Fund — more than $100 million by Apple alone — to provide education and medical care to those most affected. \nWorld AIDS Day 2016 will be held Thursday, December 1st and Apple has generally honored the day in the past. Last year, the company turned store logos red and heavily promoted (RED) products on World AIDS Day, something it has done in prior years , as well. Earlier this year, Jony Ive reflected on Apple’s participation in the (PRODUCT)Red campaign, noting of the 10-year anniversary of the fight. \nIt’s unclear when the (RED) variants of the Beats Pill+ and Solo3 headphones will be available, but it will likely be sooner rather than later. When available, the products will be for sale online and in Apple retail stores. Guides",

      "text": "GoPro’s Karma drone crashes into a recall – but is there hope in the smoke?\nFollowing last week’s financial near-death experience with their stock, now comes news that GoPro is recalling ALL of its recently sold Karma drones . Following reports from users that a small number of the drones have shut off and plummeted to the ground mid-flight, GoPro is telling buyers to return the drones now for a full refund . Additionally, GoPro says that replacement drones are not in the mix – at least, not yet.\nA recall like this could not have come at a worse time: just before the holidays – you know a lot of those drones were going to be gifts – and right after GoPro had a dismal quarter that saw its stock fall by nearly half. Yet, we have to give the company’s leaders due respect for doing the right thing. Following the bungling of the Note 7 recall by Samsung, GoPro’s quick action is a lesson in corporate responsibility no matter the consequences, even if it kills the company.\nIndeed, while the drone recall is another gut-punch for the company, it might help it in the long run in terms of good faith and renewed sales from consumers down the road. GoPro said about 2,500 Karma drones were sold before sales were halted. So far there have been no reports of injuries from malfunctioning Karma drones, and we have a link here to get you started on returning yours.\nA new (but also really old) way to think about charging stuff up\nDespite solid sales of Apple’s new iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, the tech world continues to look forward to the iPhone 8, which will arrive on the 10 th anniversary of the original iPhone and is expected to be a radical departure from current designs, with an OLED screen, possibly top to bottom, a glass back, better cameras and so forth. But BGR is reporting they are seeing solid information that the phone could house a very novel wireless charging ability.\nBGR says Apple has been working with Energous , a tech outfit that is developing a kind of wireless charging system that charges the phone in your pocket while you’re in your house or at work, no matter where you are in the building for the most part. In truth, it’s not new tech or even that complex: genius inventor Nicola Tesla demonstrated such a system over a century ago. But so far, no one has incorporated the tech into a cell phone, and it could be a game changer.\nImagine your phone charging up in your pocket wherever you are: at home, work, on the train, in your car, wherever. More than any fancy new camera or appearance change, it’s a feature that could change the way we think about charging up our phones – or charging anything at all.\nApple’s new Touch Bar MacBook Pro is touching some stellar sales numbers\nMore Apple news now: the new MacBook Pro, with its fancy video Touch Bar, is a certified monster hit, according to Slice Intelligence.\nSlice analyzed data from over 4 million shoppers and says that in just its first five days on sale, it outsold the Microsoft Surface Book sale totals for all of the last year by a factor of four. Apple has also indicated the new laptops are on full hot, with Phil Shiller saying Cupertino is ramping up production to meet demand. Granted, there was a lot of pent-up demand for the new MacBooks after a four-year stretch of no real redesign, but these sales results are unexpected.\nWant one for yourself right now? Good luck! Right now, it’s looking like a four or five week wait for new units to ship.\nGoPro is recalling its Karma drone Returned your Note 7? Good, now steer clear of your Samsung clothes washer GoPro takes off with a new foldable Karma drone, Hero5 cam, and more",

      "text": "Tim Cook calls for unity at Apple following Trump's victory Apple CEO seeks to reassure employees after divisive presidential campaign share Stephen Lam/Getty Images \nApple CEO Tim Cook sought to reassure employees following Donald Trump's shocking electoral victory this week, according to an internal memo obtained by Buzzfeed News . In the memo, sent Wednesday, Cook called on Apple employees to come together after the bitter presidential campaign, and reaffirmed the company's commitment to diversity. \n\"We have a very diverse team of employees, including supporters of each of the candidates,\" Cook said in the memo. \"Regardless of which candidate each of us supported as individuals, the only way to move forward is to move forward together.\" \n\"Our company is open to all.\" \nTrump was sharply critical of Apple during the campaign, calling for a boycott of the company's products over its refusal to unlock an iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino shooters. \"To think that Apple won't allow us to get into her cellphone? Who do they think they are?\" he said of the company's pro-encryption stance during a TV interview in February. In January, Trump made a fantastical promise to \"get Apple to start building their damn computers and things in this country,\" rather than overseas. \nApple also distanced itself from Trump during the campaign, after withdrawing its support of the Republican National Convention, though Cook held a fundraiser for Speaker of the House Paul Ryan and other Republicans in June. The memo sent this week did not mention Trump by name, though it implicitly repudiated much of the hateful rhetoric upon which the Republican nominee based his campaign. \n\"While there is discussion today about uncertainties ahead, you can be confident that Apple’s North Star hasn’t changed,\" Cook said, adding: \"Our company is open to all, and we celebrate the diversity of our team here in the United States and around the world — regardless of what they look like, where they come from, how they worship or who they love.\"",

      "text": "AP\nDonald Trump's surprise win in the Presidential race has shocked liberal Silicon Valley and now Apple chief executive Tim Cook has written to staff to reassure them about the outcome.\nCook celebrated diversity, as well as the differing political views among its 76,000 employees in the US, according to a memo obtained by Buzzfeed .\nThe boss of the biggest tech company in the world urged people to move forward and \"move forward together\", quoting Martin Luther King while assuring them that Apple's priorities have not changed.\n\"While there is discussion today about uncertainties ahead, you can be confident that Apple’s North Star hasn’t changed,\" he said.\n\"Our products connect people everywhere, and they provide the tools for our customers to do great things to improve their lives and the world at large. Our company is open to all, and we celebrate the diversity of our team here in the United States and around the world - regardless of what they look like, where they come from, how they worship or who they love.\"\nTrump was a vocal critic of the company during campaigning, calling for a boycott of the brand after it said it would not give the FBI access to the iPhone of the San Bernadino shooter .\nThe President-elect also slammed the company for manufacturing the iPhone in China and said he would force it to return the work to the US.\n\"We're going to get Apple to build their damn computers and things in this country instead of in other countries,\" he said in January.\nDonald Trump at the third presidential debate. Win McNamee/Getty Images\nShares in Apple slid in the immediate aftermath of the shock election result on Wednesday along with other tech stocks . Trump has mad little reference to tech policies throughout the campaigning, the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation notes , while comments about the sector directly have sometimes been critical.\nThe group cited four \"general philosophies\" on tech and innovation:\nGenerally conservative position of significantly reducing business taxes and regulations, including a significant reduction of corporate taxes. Unclear position on high-skill immigration. Supports strong homeland security with potential effects on weakening encryption. Would strengthen trade enforcement, including by renegotiating existing trade deals. Trump's biggest known policy which would effect the tech industry is his promise to lower the rate of corporation tax on foreign earnings. Currently, at around 40 per cent, the move would mean the big tech companies would be more likely to repatriate earnings made abroad.\nRead the original article on City AM .

      "text": "Here’s what CEOs Tim Cook, Satya Nadella and Mark Zuckerberg had to say about it. Apple \nOne of the biggest concerns for the Cupertino giant is how new policy might affect production. \nIn the run-up to the election, Trump voiced his desire for the Big A to rely less on foreign manufacturers and transition to building its products locally – a stance he’s upheld even prior to his foray into politics . \nWhile it remains unclear whether Trump has any intentions to follow up on these comments, his forthcoming entrance to the White House later in January is worrisome to many at Apple. \nIn the immediate aftermath of the election, Tim Cook sent out an internal memo company-wide, reassuring employees that “Apple’s North Star hasn’t changed” and urging them to “move forward together” despite opposing political affiliations. \nWhile the iPhone -maker CEO opted not to go into too much detail about policy and other implications of the electoral outcome, what’s particularly intriguing is that Cook made no explicit mention of Trump’s name or his previous comments. \nRead his full statement (as obtained by BuzzFeed ) below: \nTeam, \nI’ve heard from many of you today about the presidential election. In a political contest where the candidates were so different and each received a similar number of popular votes, it’s inevitable that the aftermath leaves many of you with strong feelings. \nWe have a very diverse team of employees, including supporters of each of the candidates. Regardless of which candidate each of us supported as individuals, the only way to move forward is to move forward together. I recall something Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. said 50 years ago: “If you can’t fly, then run. If you can’t run, then walk. If you can’t walk, then crawl, but whatever you do you have to keep moving forward.” This advice is timeless, and a reminder that we only do great work and improve the world by moving forward. \nWhile there is discussion today about uncertainties ahead, you can be confident that Apple’s North Star hasn’t changed. Our products connect people everywhere, and they provide the tools for our customers to do great things to improve their lives and the world at large. Our company is open to all, and we celebrate the diversity of our team here in the United States and around the world — regardless of what they look like, where they come from, how they worship or who they love. I’ve always looked at Apple as one big family and I encourage you to reach out to your co-workers if they are feeling anxious. \nLet’s move forward — together! \nBest, Microsoft \nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella was equally calculated when he addressed Trump’s triumph. \nNadella took it to recently acquired LinkedIn to congratulate the newly-announced President-elect and assure employees Microsoft’s goals and ambitions haven’t changed. \nHere’s Nadella’s full statement: \nYesterday we witnessed the democratic process in action here in the US. The results are of importance around the world, and I know that interest is shared among Microsoft employees. We congratulate the president-elect, and look forward to working with all those elected yesterday. Our commitment to our mission and values are steadfast, and in particular fostering a diverse and inclusive culture. \nWhile, in a similar fashion to Cook, Nadella refrained from engaging into politics, he also linked to a blog post by Microsoft chief legal office Brad Smith. \nTitled “Moving forward together: Our thoughts on the US election,” the piece treads relatively lightly, but does touch upon Trump’s anti-immigration policies, emphasizing Microsoft’s varied employee base as well as devoted committment to diversity. \nThings get a little more interesting when Smith approaches the issue of policies on technology and business. \nDespite its generally diplomatic tone, Microsoft reminds of its readiness to stand up to administration and fight for “clearer and more modern” policy and laws, pointing out it has previously done so on a number of occasions. \nWe’re committed to developing technology that is secure and trusted, both for Americans and for people around the world. We literally have thousands of employees who make this their focus and priority. And we know that we’ll benefit from stronger government policies as well. That’s why we’ve not only advocated for clearer and more modern U.S. laws, but have filed lawsuits four times in the past three years against the current administration, standing up for what we believe are the vital rights of people both here and abroad. As we’ve won the cases we’ve brought, we’ve been reminded of one of this country’s greatest strengths, its strong Constitution, independent judiciary, and the overarching rule of law. Facebook \nNo different than Cook and Nadella, Mark Zuckerberg adopted an identically optimistic and neutral attitude in his statement on the results of the election. \nThe Facebook boss appealed to citizens and employees by asking them to remain devoted to creating “the world we want for our children,” further adding this cause is “bigger than any presidency.” \nZuckerberg chose not to address earlier accusations Facebook faced for distributing a slew false stories, which might have in turn shifted the electoral outcome in favor of Trump. \nAlthough the Facebook CEO steered away from controversy, a company spokesperson acknowledged the platform’s crucial role in the election earlier in a statement to Bloomberg on Wednesday. \nWhile Facebook played a part in this election, it was just one of many ways people received their information and one of the many ways people connected with their leaders, engaged in the political process and shared their views. \nFor whatever reason, Zuckerberg didn’t veer into the impact Trump’s win might have on Facebook. What does that all mean? \nWell, not much at this point. \nStill, given Trump’s prolonged critique of the tech industry and his advocacy of policies that might very well have negative repercussions for the future of the sector, the passive tone in each and all of these statements strikes me as odd, to say the least. \nPolitics is a touchy issue – especially when your words reach millions of people. And while I understand the motivation behind the reserved approaches Cook, Nadella and Zuckerberg all took, I still wish they spoke out more openly – regardless of their personal political believes. \nOver the last few years, Apple has been much more verbal about its political leanings under Cook’s guidance, but it doesn’t seem to be the case this time around. \nWhen Sillicon Valley cried out in distress following Trump’s presidential triumph, Apple elected to play it safe – and so did Microsoft and Facebook.",

      "text": "Trades from $ 3 Apple Inc ( AAPL - Free Report ) might launch its latest iPhone 7 and 7 Plus models in jet white color, reports Mac Otakara, citing supply chain sources. However, Mac Otakara didn’t mention the time frame of the launch. At present, iPhone 7 and 7 Plus are available in jet black color along with a second black color, as well as gold, rose gold and silver finishes. Analysts observe that Mac Otakara has been precise on numerous occasions about leaking Apple’s information but has also faltered many a times. As far as the jet white color iPhone 7 is considered, the publication itself has added that the information may not be reliable. There are very high chances of this rumor fizzling out soon. iPhone is one of the primary growth drivers for the company. At its Sep 7 event, Apple announced new iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. It does mark a significant improvement over iPhone 6 and paves the way for iPhone 8, which is rumored to be launched around the 10 th anniversary of the first iPhone, i.e., next year. Furthermore, the company is expected to gain from the upgrade cycle, especially in mature markets. To further push its advantage, the new iPhones were made available in more than 130 countries, representing the fastest rollout in the history of iPhones. But the macroeconomic headwinds remain for now, especially in China, one of the biggest markets for Apple. Stiff competition is an added concern.

More >> \nA California mother of six could end up in jail for up to a year for selling homemade food on Facebook. The details surrounding Marina Ruelas' arrest, and that of her fellow social sellers, is even more fascinating than her crime. \nBy Cristian de Looper \nProvided by \nThe tax debate between Apple, Ireland, and the European Union may escalate in the next few months. According to recent reports, the Irish Finance Minister, Michael Noonan, will bring the debate to the EU court, a move that could trigger a years-long court battle. \nThe battle stems from a European Commission finding that Ireland had been giving Apple tax breaks, something that has attracted a number of multinational employers to Ireland. The EU, however, has ordered the practices to change. \nMore: Ireland to appeal $14.5 billion tax penalty imposed on Apple, EU remains adamant \nAfter a three-year probe into Ireland’s relationship with Apple, the European Commission ordered Ireland to collect $14.5 billion in back taxes from the company. That is the largest state-aid payback demand in history. \nThe decision has been the subject of criticism, particularly from this side of the Atlantic. The U.S. Treasury Department says the decision is a threat “to undermine foreign investment, the business climate in Europe, and the important spirit of economic partnership between the U.S. and the EU.” \nApple has also vowed to fight against the EU decision, and those appeals will follow the ones already pending in Luxembourg, where the EU is headquartered. Those pending appeals include cases against Starbucks. \nOf course, Apple and Ireland will face tough competition in the European Commission’s Jean-Claude Juncker, who said that the ruling against Apple is clearly based on facts, arguing that the decision is not one against the U.S., but rather against unfair business practices. \nThe issues stem from the fact that Ireland’s corporate tax rate is currently 12.5 percent, however, Apple was paying far less thanks to a deal between it and Ireland that dates back to the 1990s. The deal essentially allowed Apple to record all sales as being in Ireland rather than other countries where Apple products were sold. In return, Apple brought thousands of jobs to the country. \n\nThis article was originally posted on Digital Trends Content provided by INFORMATIONAL DISCLAIMER The information contained on or provided through this site is intended for general consumer understanding and education only and is not intended to be and is not a substitute for professional financial or accounting advice.

According to recent reports, the Irish Finance Minister, Michael Noonan, will bring the debate to the EU court, a move that could trigger a years-long court battle. \nThe battle stems from a European Commission finding that Ireland had been giving Apple tax breaks, something that has attracted a number of multinational employers to Ireland. The EU, however, has ordered the practices to change. \nMore: Ireland to appeal $14.5 billion tax penalty imposed on Apple, EU remains adamant \nAfter a three-year probe into Ireland’s relationship with Apple, the European Commission ordered Ireland to collect $14.5 billion in back taxes from the company. That is the largest state-aid payback demand in history. \nThe decision has been the subject of criticism, particularly from this side of the Atlantic. The U.S. Treasury Department says the decision is a threat “to undermine foreign investment, the business climate in Europe, and the important spirit of economic partnership between the U.S. and the EU.” \nApple has also vowed to fight against the EU decision, and those appeals will follow the ones already pending in Luxembourg, where the EU is headquartered. Those pending appeals include cases against Starbucks. \nOf course, Apple and Ireland will face tough competition in the European Commission’s Jean-Claude Juncker, who said that the ruling against Apple is clearly based on facts, arguing that the decision is not one against the U.S., but rather against unfair business practices. \nThe issues stem from the fact that Ireland’s corporate tax rate is currently 12.5 percent, however, Apple was paying far less thanks to a deal between it and Ireland that dates back to the 1990s. The deal essentially allowed Apple to record all sales as being in Ireland rather than other countries where Apple products were sold. In return, Apple brought thousands of jobs to the country. \n\nThis article was originally posted on Digital Trends Content provided by INFORMATIONAL DISCLAIMER The information contained on or provided through this site is intended for general consumer understanding and education only and is not intended to be and is not a substitute for professional financial or accounting advice.

      "text": "Tim Cook has a message for Apple employees after Donald Trump's election as U.S. president. \nThe Apple chief executive sent a memo to all U.S. Apple employees, according to BuzzFeed News . The memo, obtained by BuzzFeed , emphasized Apple's commitment to diversity and progress around the world. \nLike President Barack Obama , Hillary Clinton and others who have spoken about the results of the election, Cook said \"the only way to move forward is to move forward together.\" \nRead the full memo below: \nTeam,\nI’ve heard from many of you today about the presidential election. In a political contest where the candidates were so different and each received a similar number of popular votes, it’s inevitable that the aftermath leaves many of you with strong feelings.\nWe have a very diverse team of employees, including supporters of each of the candidates. Regardless of which candidate each of us supported as individuals, the only way to move forward is to move forward together. I recall something Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. said 50 years ago: “If you can’t fly, then run. If you can’t run, then walk. If you can’t walk, then crawl, but whatever you do you have to keep moving forward.” This advice is timeless, and a reminder that we only do great work and improve the world by moving forward.\nWhile there is discussion today about uncertainties ahead, you can be confident that Apple’s North Star hasn’t changed. Our products connect people everywhere, and they provide the tools for our customers to do great things to improve their lives and the world at large. Our company is open to all, and we celebrate the diversity of our team here in the United States and around the world — regardless of what they look like, where they come from, how they worship or who they love.\nI’ve always looked at Apple as one big family and I encourage you to reach out to your co-workers if they are feeling anxious.\nLet’s move forward — together!\nBest,\nTim",

      "text": "Reddit \nApple has released its holiday gift guide for 2016 , including a variety of accessories for its core products: iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch and Apple TV. The list of recommendations is more focused than the vast 2015 guide , presenting four collections: music, photography, games, and a general Apple products category. \nThe primary category only features Apple’s first-party products, like Apple Watch bands, iPhone cases, Beats headphones and Apple Pencil for iPad Pro. The music, photography and toy collections recommend a selection of third-party accessories … \nThe ‘Apple gifts’ collection leads with iPhone 7 and accompany cases; the Leather Case and the Smart Battery Case . It also prominently shows off the Apple Watch with nylon bands, the iPad Pro plus keyboard cover and Apple Pencil, the 12-inch MacBook and Apple TV. \nFor music lovers, Apple recommends Beats Solo3 headphones , a ROLI Lightpad Block , two types of SONOS wireless speakers which integrate Apple Music streaming and the Ultimate Ears BOOM wireless speaker as an on-the-go alternative. It also includes the recently-released Powerbeats 3 , Apple’s latest earbuds with the W1 chip. \nThe photography gift collection revolves around accessories that enhance the iPhone 7’s camera, like the Manfrotto TwistGrip tripod mount and DJI OSMO mobile Gimbal , as well as the DJI Mavic Pro Drone for aerial photography. \n‘Games & Toys’ focuses on products for younger audience, which Apple describes as “this year’s most innovative toys”. The chosen items all work in combination with an iPad or iPhone in some way. For example, the Play-Doh Touch attaches to the back of an iPad and comes with an app to drive the experience. Apple also suggests some ‘toy’ gadgets for adults like the BB-8 droid , Parrot Swing Minidrone and a SteelSerius Nimbus MFI gamepad to enhance the iOS gameplay experience. \nSeveral of the items listed are available ‘only at Apple’ although most are widely available from any retailer, so it’s worth shopping around for the best deals. Apple is offering free two-day delivery on in-stock items purchased by 5.00 pm or you can buy items for in-store pickup, depending on availability. Guides",

      "text": "Occipital \nA startup that makes a special sensor that integrates with Apple iPads wants to make home improvement easier for people who are more comfortable with a mouse and keyboard than with a tape measure.\nCanvas, a free new app from Occipital, lets iPad users capture a scale model of any room. Once users have scanned a room, they can go back and pull any measurement from it — like how wide a window is, or exactly how tall the ceilings are. \nIt's pretty easy. I saw Occipital CEO Jeff Powers accurately scan a lounge at Business Insider headquarters in 30 seconds. \nOccipital \nCanvas requires Occipital's Structure Sensor, though, and a wide-angle lens attachment. The Structure Sensor plugs into your iPad's Lightning port, and attaches to it with a customized bracket. Inside its aluminum hull is a 3D sensor which can accurately determine the distance of objects.\nCombined with some pretty complicated math, it means an app can accurately tell that your ceiling is, say, 14 feet high nearly instantaneously. It can produce detailed models that actually look like your rooms. \nAlthough the Canvas app is free, the Structure Sensor costs $379, and the required wide-angle lens costs $20. And if you want to export the Canvas model into an CAD file, for further manipulation, it costs $29 per model. \nPowers says the main target market for Canvas is professional interior designers and contractors, but he suspects some do-it-yourselfers will find it useful, too.\nHere's a screenshot of the scanning process on an iPad:\nOccipital \nTake a closer look at how Canvas works: \nYoutube Embed:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/embed/XA7FMoNAK9M\nWidth: 640px\nHeight: 360px \n \nNOW WATCH: How the ‘perfect body’ for men has changed over the last 150 years \n",

      "title": "You Can Tell Apple’s Siri to Send Money Via PayPal",
      "text": "PayPal just made it a lot easier to send money on your iPhone. On Thursday, the payments giant debuted an integration with Apple’s voice assistant Siri to allow users to send money to contacts via voice commands.\nPayPal pypl previously unveiled a similar integration with Siri and its Venmo app, which allows people to send money to one another. Venmo and PayPal competitor Square Cash also debuted a voice-controlled feature with Siri earlier this year.\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune's technology newsletter. \nIt’s not surprising that PayPal is tapping into voice commands to send money. Tapping into voice-based assistants, like Siri, is becoming a more intense battle for tech giants, including Amazon amzn and Google googl .\nPayPal is also potentially gearing up for a busy holiday season with payments. The company predicts that people will use its services to send 17 million transactions in December alone. Last year, the company processed $41 billion in transactions sent from one contact to another using PayPal, Venmo, and Xoom.\nThe feature is now available in 30 countries.",

      "text": "\nWith Handoff , part of Apple's Continuity features, you can start something on one devices (like an iMessage on your iPhone) and finish it off on another (like your Mac or iPad). Handoff makes it not only possible to move your activities between your devices without interrupting your workflow, but it makes it easy to do!\nUpdated Nov. 8, 2016\nHandoff requirements Handoff broadcasts activities using Bluetooth Low Energy (BT LE) and transfers them using Wi-Fi, either directly or via iCloud . In order to use Handoff, your Mac(s) and your other device need to be:\nUsing a Mac that supports Bluetooth LE (Anything mid-2012 or later) Logged into the same Apple ID (iCloud account) on all your devices.\\ Connected to the same Wi-Fi network. Running OS X Yosemite 10.10 or later Bluetooth LE is required because it both uses very little power and it only works within a very close range. You want Handoff to always be available, but not unnecessarily draining your battery. Likewise, you only want devices that are nearby and under your physical control to pick up your activities. Security and privacy first.\nHandoff compatibility Apple has added Handoff support to the following built-in apps:\nMail, Safari, Maps, Messages, Reminders, Calendar, Contacts, Pages, Numbers, and Keynote Developers can also add Handoff support to Mac App Store apps. Check the app's description for compatibility.\nBest Handoff apps for iPhone, iPad, and Mac How to enable or disable Handoff on the Mac Handoff should be enabled by default. If it isn't, or if you need to toggle it:\nLaunch System Preferences from the Dock or by clicking the  button and System Preferences on the top left of your screen. Click on General . Check the box to the left of Allow Handoff between this Mac and your iCloud devices .\n\nTo disable Handoff, repeat the same steps but set the uncheck the box. When you're using an app on one device and it's available for Handoff, its icon will appear on the far right (or top) of your Dock.\nIt can take a few seconds or more for the app to launch and your activity to transfer over. Once it has, you can continue working right where you left off.\nHow to access Handoff from the fast app switcher If you find using the keyboard quicker than using the dock, you can also get to Handoff via the fast app switcher. It'll be at the far left side.\nPress Command-Tab to activate the fast app switcher. Press Command-Tab again and again until you cycle all the way to the Handoff icon . It can take a few seconds or more for the app to launch and your activity to transfer over. Once it has, you can continue working right where you left off.\nQuestions?

      "text": "Apple’s Tim Cook Makes a Statement About Donald Trump Tim Cook says that Apple \"celebrates the diversity\" of its employees. Nov 10th, 2016 Image Credit: Stephen Lam / Getty Images \nApple CEO Tim Cook has penned some thoughts regarding Donald Trump being elected as the next US president, saying that Apple will continue to “celebrate the diversity of our team.” \nDonald Trump has previously criticized Apple for refusing to allow the FBI access to the iPhone of one of the San Bernardino shooters, tweeting: “Boycott all Apple products until such time as Apple gives cellphone info to authorities regarding radical Islamic terrorist couple from Cal.” Trump has also previously stated that he will force Apple to make its hardware in the US, saying: “I’m going to get Apple to start making their computers and their iPhones on our land, not in China.” Also See: How President Donald Trump Could Change the Internet \nWith the relationship between Trump and the multi-billion dollar company being less than favorable, Cook sent an email to his staff in which he outlined how the company would proceed from here on out. In a thinly veiled jab at Trump’s comments regarding various minority groups in the US, the CEO said that he values his staff “regardless of what they look like, where they come from, how they worship or who they love.” Credit: Christopher Furlong / Getty Images \nHere’s the email in full: Team, I’ve heard from many of you today about the presidential election. In a political contest where the candidates were so different and each received a similar number of popular votes, it’s inevitable that the aftermath leaves many of you with strong feelings. We have a very diverse team of employees, including supporters of each of the candidates. Regardless of which candidate each of us supported as individuals, the only way to move forward is to move forward together. I recall something Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. said 50 years ago: “If you can’t fly, then run. If you can’t run, then walk. If you can’t walk, then crawl, but whatever you do you have to keep moving forward.” This advice is timeless, and a reminder that we only do great work and improve the world by moving forward. While there is discussion today about uncertainties ahead, you can be confident that Apple’s North Star hasn’t changed. Our products connect people everywhere, and they provide the tools for our customers to do great things to improve their lives and the world at large. Our company is open to all, and we celebrate the diversity of our team here in the United States and around the world — regardless of what they look like, where they come from, how they worship or who they love. I’ve always looked at Apple as one big family and I encourage you to reach out to your co-workers if they are feeling anxious. Let’s move forward — together! Best, Tim \nDespite Trump’s comments regarding Apple, the tech giant could prove to benefit financially from his presidency. As outlined by Fortune , the president-elect previously proposed that he would cut taxes on money companies had stored overseas. Apple is one of many companies in the tech industry to have distributed its money outside the US, in an effort to avoid paying the 35% US corporate tax.",

      "text": "Bank stocks and industrials surged on Thursday while Apple and other technology shares sank as Wall Street rearranged its bets to benefit from Donald Trump’s presidency.\nThe S&P 500 financial sector surged 4 percent to its highest level since the 2008 financial crisis, bringing its gain since Trump’s surprise victory in Tuesday’s election to 8.1 percent. That put it on track for its biggest two-day gain since 2011.\nWells Fargo & Co jumped 7.6 percent, JPMorgan Chase rallied 4.66 percent and Bank of America surged 5.34 percent, also helped by a rise bond yields that are the result of expectations of inflationary spending by Trump.\nTrump has also sided with leading conservatives in calling for the repeal of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Financial Reform Act largely opposed by banks.\n“The Trump campaign did say it would repeal Dodd-Frank. Rates are higher and the yield curve is steeper. Those are all good things for the banks,” said Warren West, principal at Greentree Brokerage Services in Philadelphia.\nApple dropped 2 percent while Amazon.com fell 3.65 percent and the S&P 500 technology index fell 1.1 percent.\nAt 2:28 pm ET, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 1.39 percent at 18,847.8 points and the S&P 500 had gained 0.49 percent to 2,173.84.\nThe Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.43 percent to 5,228.41.\nHigh-dividend sectors utilities, telecom services and consumer staples sold off as bond yields rose due to expectations of higher interest rates.\nThe market got a lift after St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said the Republican sweep of the White House and Congress could break the current gridlock over national policy in a potential boon to the U.S. economy.\nIndustrials trailed the financials with a 2.15 percent advance.\nMacy’s rose 5.9 percent after the department store operator raised its full-year sales forecast and announced a partnership to monetize some of its real-estate assets.\nWalt Disney and Nordstrom were expected to report earnings after the market closes.\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.02-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.67-to-1 ratio favored advancers.\nThe S&P 500 posted 82 new 52-week highs and 6 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 320 new highs and 40 new lows.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google WhatsApp Email Copy Filed under donald trump ,  dow jones ,  nasdaq ,  stock markets ,  wall street",

More >> \nThe Obama administration has just announced comprehensive support for the shift to electric vehicles (EVs). In a White House press release the administration committed to steps that will reduce the United States’ dependence on oil, increase access to clean energy, and fight climate change by supporting EV deployment and the necessary charging infrastructure. \nBy Cristian de Looper \nProvided by \nThe tax debate between Apple, Ireland, and the European Union may escalate in the next few months. According to recent reports, the Irish Finance Minister, Michael Noonan, will bring the debate to the EU court, a move that could trigger a years-long court battle. \nThe battle stems from a European Commission finding that Ireland had been giving Apple tax breaks, something that has attracted a number of multinational employers to Ireland. The EU, however, has ordered the practices to change. \nMore: Ireland to appeal $14.5 billion tax penalty imposed on Apple, EU remains adamant \nAfter a three-year probe into Ireland’s relationship with Apple, the European Commission ordered Ireland to collect $14.5 billion in back taxes from the company. That is the largest state-aid payback demand in history. \nThe decision has been the subject of criticism, particularly from this side of the Atlantic. The U.S. Treasury Department says the decision is a threat “to undermine foreign investment, the business climate in Europe, and the important spirit of economic partnership between the U.S. and the EU.” \nApple has also vowed to fight against the EU decision, and those appeals will follow the ones already pending in Luxembourg, where the EU is headquartered. Those pending appeals include cases against Starbucks. \nOf course, Apple and Ireland will face tough competition in the European Commission’s Jean-Claude Juncker, who said that the ruling against Apple is clearly based on facts, arguing that the decision is not one against the U.S., but rather against unfair business practices. \nThe issues stem from the fact that Ireland’s corporate tax rate is currently 12.5 percent, however, Apple was paying far less thanks to a deal between it and Ireland that dates back to the 1990s. The deal essentially allowed Apple to record all sales as being in Ireland rather than other countries where Apple products were sold. In return, Apple brought thousands of jobs to the country. \n\nThis article was originally posted on Digital Trends Content provided by INFORMATIONAL DISCLAIMER The information contained on or provided through this site is intended for general consumer understanding and education only and is not intended to be and is not a substitute for professional financial or accounting advice.

Like every other major player out there, it's clear the tech giant wants to run your living room. And while it appears set to do that through its new software, tech evangelist Robert Scoble believes Apple could be working on an actual TV, too. Seem like an odd move? Well, if it was gearing up to compete with any ordinary set, it would be. But Scoble believes that the Cupertino company will incorporate mixed reality technology into the box. Ooh. Related: Apple is letting you pick up an iPhone with a 15 percent discount Speaking at the Web Summit in Lisbon, Scoble indicated that the fresh project has been around since Steve Jobs was head of the company, and, more importantly, will be revealed within the next year(!). \"Tim Cook and Steve Jobs, I believe, sat down and talked about the future of TV and in 11 months they are going to show you the future of TV – because they are building the PrimeSense sensor right into the television, into the iPad and into the iPhone… so you can do this kind of mixed reality,\" Scoble said. He added: \"Apple has 600 engineers working on it. There was a patent released this morning – they've been working on mixed reality, or augmented reality, for five years… minimum. \"What's coming in 11 months is going to blow even my mind.\" PrimeSense is, of course, the company that worked with Microsoft to create the Kinect Sensor — a solid addition despite never being embraced. Scobel seems supremely confident in his sources that Apple will finally be entering different realms with innovative tech, also posting this to Facebook. The patent he links out to involves an augmented reality mapping system for the iPhone, though how exactly this could be linked to a potential TV product remains to be seen. While the thought of Apple releasing something revolutionary and finally rediscovering its innovative streak is a captivating thought, this can only be categorised as speculation for now. ",

      "text": "By Cristian de Looper\nProvided by\nThe tax debate between Apple, Ireland, and the European Union may escalate in the next few months. According to recent reports, the Irish Finance Minister, Michael Noonan, will bring the debate to the EU court, a move that could trigger a years-long court battle.\nThe battle stems from a European Commission finding that Ireland had been giving Apple tax breaks, something that has attracted a number of multinational employers to Ireland. The EU, however, has ordered the practices to change.\nMore: Ireland to appeal $14.5 billion tax penalty imposed on Apple, EU remains adamant\nAfter a three-year probe into Ireland’s relationship with Apple, the European Commission ordered Ireland to collect $14.5 billion in back taxes from the company. That is the largest state-aid payback demand in history.\nThe decision has been the subject of criticism, particularly from this side of the Atlantic. The U.S. Treasury Department says the decision is a threat “to undermine foreign investment, the business climate in Europe, and the important spirit of economic partnership between the U.S. and the EU.”\nApple has also vowed to fight against the EU decision, and those appeals will follow the ones already pending in Luxembourg, where the EU is headquartered. Those pending appeals include cases against Starbucks.\nOf course, Apple and Ireland will face tough competition in the European Commission’s Jean-Claude Juncker, who said that the ruling against Apple is clearly based on facts, arguing that the decision is not one against the U.S., but rather against unfair business practices.\nThe issues stem from the fact that Ireland’s corporate tax rate is currently 12.5 percent, however, Apple was paying far less thanks to a deal between it and Ireland that dates back to the 1990s. The deal essentially allowed Apple to record all sales as being in Ireland rather than other countries where Apple products were sold. In return, Apple brought thousands of jobs to the country.\nThis article was originally posted on Digital Trends\nContent provided by",

      "text": "0 Comments Mapal’s IPad demo. Pictured right: SAP Mentor Dick Hirsch \nSAP’s new Apple development partnership was announced with vigor at Sapphire Now 2016, but the announcement was short on specifics. When would developers get their hands on the SAP Apple SDK? \nAt SAP TechEd 2016, we got a clearer answer, thanks to a customer meeting with “pre-early-adopter” Mapal , along with SAP’s Rick Knowles, SVP & GM, Apple Partnership. Knowles clarified the iOS SDK timeframe (General Availability is targeted for March 2017), but the highlight was hearing from Mapal. \nMattie Maier , SAP HANA Cloud Platform Solution Architect and Sebastian Lange, Software Developer and Technical Lead explained why they chose to be one of the very first SAP ioS SDK customers. \nThen a cool thing happened. As our blogger group got further into Mapal’s story, it expanded from an ioS story to how Mapal’s iPad deployments are tied to a bigger IoT play that is changing their company. Mapal is a precision tool supplier that focuses on customized tools. These tools are not inexpensive, but based on customer specs, Mapal can provide one tool that does the job of five or six tools. From cumbersome process to iPad \nBut every now and then, even the finest tool will break. And that’s where the SAP iOS project comes in. Prior to building their iOS iPad app, Mapal’s customers would go through a cumbersome process every time a tool broke. The original process required a worker to write down notes on the issue, and contract their shift or line manager to write down more notes about what the worker was doing when the tool broke. Then Mapal’s field managers are contacted. The incident is usually described from memory after the night shift. Eventually, the issue gets sent to Mapal’s research and development. iPad – parts in scanning process \nThat’s the short version, but even with rigor, that process takes a couple of days. Lange: \nIt’s not a thing where you talk about hours; it could be as long as a couple of days. Now we have the possibility to shorten this time span to a couple of minutes, because when the worker sees the tool is broken, he gets his iPad and takes a photo on the defect report… He can even attach a document or a photo of the machine he has been using. \nDepending on the size of the customer, you’re talking about a reporting process that affects thousands of tools. I asked Lange and Maier: why iOS native? They could have considered HTML5 or other app options rather than diving into an early IoS SDK project with SAP. \nTurns out they did look at building the app in UI5, but the Mapal team soon realized they would need a tool manager app with native capabilities. As soon as you need access to a scanner to scan a barcode, native matters. As for taking on the learning curve of being an early pre-adopter, Lange and Maier told us their team was feeling an urgency to push ahead. Once their customers found out about this functionality, they wanted it yesterday. Maier scanning part on iPad \nAs of now, two customers are live on the new parts scanning app. Once they complete these pilots, Mapal will scale up. Early feedback has been “very positive.” They got quite a bit of feedback on the UI, and adapted accordingly. \nEspecially for the machine workers, the iPad is a new thing. Activating the process with greasy plant floor fingers proved a problem, but now the app is operated with a pen, and it’s smooth to use. The data from the app pulls into their back-end SAP ERP system. They use the HANA database to process the app queries, and the BusinessObjects Cloud to build the reports. \nMaier said with SAP’s support, they were able to build the app in just a few weeks: \nIn the implementation phase, there were a few detours that we had to take. Of course the SDK is not publicly released, so obviously it’s still work in progress. \nLange added: \nSAP did a really did a great job with just preventing us from running into every problem – because they have the experience there already. \nKnowles said the feedback from Mapal has helped SAP get their SDK ready for GA: \nThey definitely pushed us, and they’re still pushing us. Plot twist – the app powers Mapal’s IoT platform play \nThe app goes far beyond solving a tedious process. It’s also a vital part of Mapal’s new IoT platform. Lange: \nThe platform is much more than just having defect reports or having any report on the tool… It starts really with our production time; the complete tool lifecycle is going to be put on that platform. \nUsing sensors to track stock movements, and using apps like this one to collect data, Mapal has built a new IoT platform which they call c-Com. This platform runs on top of the HANA Cloud Platform. They are planning on opening this platform to their partners – and even their competitors – as they build out a whole new aspect of their business model. \nKnowles shared the view from SAP’s side: \nMapal has already made the transition in their business model away from just selling the tool, to actually providing a service… Because they’ve made that shift, how do they hedge their risk to make sure that they’re pricing right and providing the right pieces and getting the right units of production for this? \nThe last mile is the tool manager, and that could be an employee of a car manufacturer on the shop floor, or it could be a Mapal employee that’s been placed there. This then necessitated them to take their model and extend it all the way down to how do we manage and change that value of that worker, that tool manager. \nMaier explained that in the manufacturing process, the “A-part” is the engine itself, the work product. The “B-part” is the machinery. The “C-part” are the tools. They asked themselves: why not develop a platform for the C-part ecosystem? Maier: \nWe said, “Hey, there’s different suppliers of C-parts that all have the same problem.” Mapal is just one of the suppliers of tools, and we have other partners and competitors that have the same customers, and they want to purchase from various customers. They want a life cycle manager of all the tools, not only from Mapal. \nMaier shared how they built the platform: \nSAP provides us the HCP platform as a service as the technical foundation. Then we built the c-Com platform on top. It basically adds the semantics, the data model and all that stuff. \nIn this new IoT play, an app like Mapal’s tool manager becomes a crucial source of on-the-ground data: \nThe iOS tool manager app obviously connects to c-Com, because you’ve got to save those defect reports somewhere. You got to get this machine data. You’ve to get the master data for the tools, the pictures, the documents and so on. \nTo get access to that type of data, you need to be a subscriber to the c-Com platform. An app like tool manager becomes a client on that platform, and a new business model emerges. c-Com goes beyond Mapal’s data: their platform supports multiple suppliers and multiple customers that share lifecycle information about C-parts. \nSAP is instrumental to this model, particularly when it comes to establishing platform credibility. Maier: \nWe can’t say, “Dear competitor, we store your data.” We tell them, “The data is stored with SAP; SAP has the key to the data.” Then they’re like, “Okay, this is a trusted third party, we know who SAP is. We work with SAP as well. We’ll jump on the platform.” \nMapal must earn platform trust: \nIf we, as a small player in the huge metal cutting industry, say, “We’re the big company to provide the platform in our industry,” nobody would take us seriously. If we say, “We work together with SAP and others to make this a success,” then it puts a lot more weight into what we say. The wrap –“This will change the role of the tool manager” \nIt’s early days, but Mapal has big ambitions here: \nWe want to become the C-part platform for managing the life cycle of C-parts, improving that with machine data, and [eventually] with things like specific forecasting and machine learning. \nLange ties the app directly to their IoT prospects. The customer gets a change for the better: \nThis will be a big supply of data for us. This application really is the use case for the field application which will bring us data into the platform. As Rick said, it will change the role of the tool manager. \nFinal note: SAP’s iOS partnership is more than building an SDK; they want to build a developer community around this offering. They will offer hands-on training sessions via the Cupertino lab, and eventually in SAP Apphaus locations. Some of the training coursework will also be free via SAP’s openSAP MOOCs. You can now sign up for a free SAP Fiori for iOS introductory MOOC , which begins on November 15. We’ll revisit the iOS SDK partnership as it progresses, as well as Mapal’s initiatives. \nImage credit - on-site photos by Jon Reed. \nDisclosure - SAP paid the bulk of my expenses to attend SAP TechEd Barcelona.

      "text": "Best Low-P/E Tech Stocks to Buy in November IBM, Baidu, and Apple are all trading at discounts to the overall market. Leo Sun ( TMFSunLion ) Nov 11, 2016 at 8:21AM \nWith the market near all-time highs, it can be tough to find \"cheap\" tech stocks worth starting new positions in. However, three well-known tech stocks -- IBM ( NYSE:IBM ) , Baidu ( NASDAQ:BIDU ) , and Apple ( NASDAQ:AAPL ) -- all still trade at steep discounts to the S&P 500's P/E of 23 and their industry averages. Let's take a look at why investors don't seem interested in these three tech giants, and why they could be great long-term plays at current prices. Image source: Pixabay. IBM \nIBM currently trades at 13 times trailing earnings, which is much lower than the average P/E of 21 for the IT services industry. IBM's 13% gain has outperformed the S&P 500's 4% gain this year, but that rally was likely fueled by its 3.7% forward yield in a low interest rate environment instead of any notable strengths in its business. IBM has hiked its dividend, which is comfortably supported by its payout ratio of 44%, for 16 consecutive years. \nBig Blue's main problem is its lack of revenue growth. Its quarterly revenue has fallen year-over-year for 18 consecutive quarters due to rising competition and sluggish enterprise demand for its aging IT services, software, and hardware. IBM's core strategy is to offset those declines with its higher-growth \"strategic imperatives\" (cloud, analytics, mobility, social, and security) businesses. Revenue from those businesses rose 16% annually to $8 billion last quarter, and accounted for 40% of IBM's trailing-12-month revenue. Unfortunately, that growth didn't fully offset the weakness of its other businesses, which caused its total revenue to dip 0.4% annually. \nLooking ahead, IBM's painful shift away from older products toward higher-growth ones should eventually pay off. Analysts still expect IBM's revenues to fall through 2017, but its earnings -- boosted by buybacks and a shift toward higher-margin services -- should improve 3.5% next year. It's a long road back for IBM, but its low multiple and high dividend should set a floor under the stock. Baidu \nBaidu, China's largest search engine, trades at just 13 times trailing earnings, which is much lower than the industry average P/E of 50 for internet information providers. Shares of Baidu have slumped 9% this year due to concerns about its spending and new regulations for its ads. \nTo remain competitive in the rapidly evolving Chinese internet market, Baidu has been adding O2O (online-to-offline) features -- like mobile payments, ride hailing, ticket bookings, and restaurant reservations -- to its core app. These investments are expected to cause its earnings to decline 12% this year. \nBaidu's top line has been weighed down by more strict regulations regarding ads for healthcare services and pharmaceutical products. The sale of its stake in online travel agency Qunar to Ctrip further distorted year-over-year comparisons. As a result, Baidu's revenue is expected to rise just 6% this year, compared to 35% growth in 2015. But looking further ahead to 2017, Baidu is expected to post 21% sales growth and 33% earnings growth as its O2O investments start paying off. Apple \nDespite being the most valuable company in the world by market cap, Apple trades at just 13 times trailing earnings -- a discount to the industry average of 17 for electronic equipment makers. The stock has barely outperformed the S&P 500, with a 5% gain this year, mainly due to ongoing concerns about sales of the iPhone, which generated 60% of the company sales last quarter. Image source: Apple. \nShipments of iPhones, iPads, and Macs all fell annually last quarter, causing Apple to post its first year-over-year revenue decline since 2001. Apple's response has been to diversify its hardware business with the Apple Watch, and its services business with Apple Music, Apple Pay, and other software platforms. But these businesses still only generate a small portion of the tech giant's overall revenues. \nBut looking ahead, Apple still has plenty of cash to spend on acquisitions, buybacks, and dividends to keep investors interested. New acquisitions could reduce the weight of its hardware business and give Apple new pillars of growth. Buybacks could boost its earnings growth, and its forward yield of 2% (supported by a low payout ratio of 26%) could easily be doubled to attract income investors. It's tough to see what comes next for Apple, but I certainly wouldn't bet against the tech giant's long-term prospects. Patience pays off... \nInvestors should remember that stocks generally have low P/Es because investors aren't eager to buy them. However, investing in companies with sound long-term growth prospects while their stocks are at low multiples could pay off over the long run. There's no guarantee that investors will suddenly fall in love with IBM, Baidu, or Apple again, but I believe the potential rewards outweigh the risks at their current prices. \nLeo Sun has no position in any stocks mentioned.
