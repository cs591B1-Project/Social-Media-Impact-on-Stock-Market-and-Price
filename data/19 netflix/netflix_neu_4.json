      "text": "Choosing our words wisely will impact relationships. Netflix/\"Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt\"\nLet's face it: We are responsible for what comes out of our mouths .\nAnd while people are 100 percent responsible for how they react to our words , choosing our words wisely will impact relationships. It starts with the speaker.\nSo what can you say consistently as a person of integrity that will cause others to gravitate toward you, and eventually say, \"This is someone I can trust?\"\nYou can start with these phrases:\n'How did you think that went?' A question all great mentor-coaches in influential roles ask. Reserve your judgment to avoid defensiveness and use this question to let someone else gauge her success by her own standards. This puts the other person at ease, and she is free to decide how successful the task, presentation, performance, or meeting was, and what she wants to talk about in relation to the question.\n'That was my fault.' Put your ego aside because admitting to being human and making mistakes actually increases trust. Dr. Paul Zak, author of \" Trust Factor: The Science of Creating High Performance Companies \" says, \"People who are imperfect are more attractive to us. We like them more than people who seem too perfect.\"\n'Would you mind giving me a hand?' This is especially tactful after you've admitted a short-coming, an oversight, or that you've royally messed up. Asking for help extends your honesty and your humble disposition makes you more trustworthy to the other person.\n'Can I get your advice on this?' Dr. Wood Brooks, author of a study linking people that ask for advice to being perceived as more competent says: \"In our research, we find that people are hesitant to ask for advice because they are afraid they will appear incompetent.\" She says that this is misplaced fear. The reality is that \"people view those who seek their advice as more competent than those who do not seek their advice.\"\n'I trust your judgment.' Trust is a two-way street. By extending it as a gift to others, they'll be more inclined to return the favor and trust you back. This gives workplaces clear competitive advantage and brings teams closer together to produce excellent, cohesive work. Darlene Price , president of Well Said, Inc. and author of Well Said! Presentations and Conversations That Get Results , says \"avoid the 'Do It Yourself' attitude; find ways to rely on others in the workplace. Show that you value and celebrate their input and give them opportunities to earn your trust.\"\n'I couldn't have done it without you.' This is quite possibly the highest form of saying \"thank you.\" By acknowledging someone else's effort for going above and beyond, especially if it makes you look good, put that person on the pedestal he or she deserves! When reinforced as a cultural trait, this simple act of encouragement is mental booster that will send ripples of trust across the organization.\n'Here's what this means for you ...' People want to know where they stand, they want to feel safe, and certainly be ensured that you (especially a boss) have their best interests in mind. If you're selling an idea, getting buy-in to a challenging vision, or requesting money for a project, communicate clearly to your audience the benefits — short and long-term.\n'I'm all ears.' This will instantly send a message to the listener that you're open to dialog and are genuinely interested in what they have to say. Just make sure your body language matches so you are truly giving the other person your undivided attention with no distractions. Add some flattery, acknowledge them for their ideas or suggestions, and you may just spark a productive exchange.\n'What can I do to help?' This phrase can move mountains when deadlines are due, stress is high, and desperation is setting in. Servant leaders that demonstrate action through this question by genuinely helping their employees and having their backs will create a ripple effect.\n'What can I do differently?' Employees with a growth mindset will and should use this phrase often as they learn new things. It demonstrates to their bosses that they're open to suggestions, and are eager to see something from another angle to accelerate their development. And as managers, they should allow their employees the freedom to express their opinions and validate those that add value. It may be that you, the manager, are the one that may benefit from an employee's expertise to help you see something different.\nRead the original article on Inc. . Copyright 2016.

      "text": "Share Tweet \nThe final month of 2016 is quickly approaching, and Netflix is getting us ready by hitting us with a wind of nostalgia. From The Little Rascals to the second season of Fuller House , it looks like we’re poised to revisit the ’80s and ’90s this holiday season. Check out everything that is coming to Netflix in December 2016. Be sure to keep reading for the full list below ! 1 Picture Perfect (December 1st) 20th Century Fox In this '90s classic, Jennifer Aniston stars as a career driven single gal named Kate who upon discovering that her boss is more inclined to give promotions to married people, lies about her engagement.

      "text": "Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life | Official Trailer [HD] | Netflix 16 min ago ( … ) \nGilmore girls makes its much-anticipated return with four memorable chapters from the lives of Lorelai, Emily, Rory and countless more Stars Hollow stalwarts. Picking up nine years after we last ​dropped in on the whimsical Connecticut town, Gilmore girls: A Year in the Life finds each of our ​leading ladies at a major crossroad: Lorelai’s relationship with Luke is at an unnerving standstill; Rory’s budding journalism career in New York has stalled before it's even begun; and Emily’s world is turned upside down following the untimely passing of her beloved husband, Richard. \nGilmore girls: A Year in the Life is told through four 90-minute chapters -- each spanning one season: Winter, Spring, Summer, Fall -- and brings back to life everything from the quaint corner diner to the dreamy Dragonfly Inn to a fast-talking, quick-witted mother-daughter love story unlike any other. Gilmore girls: A Year in the Life launches Friday, November 25, everywhere that Netflix is available.",

      "text": "Lorelai and Rory Gilmore are back in Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life. Netflix Early in Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life , Rory Gilmore ( Alexis Bledel ) is trying to answer a phone call, with little success. Could it be — as her mother, Lorelai ( Lauren Graham ), surmises — because the little burg of Stars Hollow, Connecticut, where the pair resides, has bad reception due to the giant snow globe it exists within? \nRating 3.5 It’s a joke, of course. Gilmore Girls is not revealed, at least at this juncture, to be a stealth sequel to Under the Dome . But it’s a particularly telling one at this moment in pop culture, in the Year of Our Bubble 2016. In a world where, post-presidential election, seemingly everyone has an opinion about how modern progressives are too ensconced in their own bubble — or, no, conservatives are too trapped in their bubble — here is a TV show that takes place in what often seems to be a literal progressive bubble. Nothing too serious ever happens; the characters might struggle, but they take care of each other, and if genuine neo-Nazis started marching through the middle of Stars Hollow, it’s all but certain the town would shut them down like a body rejecting a virus. Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life is a gauzy bit of frippery. It struggles to see beyond its limited world view, and even aside from that, it has all of the typical problems you’d expect with a TV revival — where it’s always impossible to recapture exactly what made a show work the first time around. (That particular difficulty is especially pronounced with A Year in the Life , for reasons I outlined here .) It feels, at all times, like it’s making easy choices instead of hard ones, like it’s content to let the audience soak in a warm bath of nostalgia instead of forcing us to consider hard truths. Goodness, did I enjoy it. Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life is more than just an excuse to get the gang back together And don’t forget Emily Gilmore (Kelly Bishop, left)! Netflix At times, it feels like A Year in the Life exists solely to let series creator Amy Sherman-Palladino re-immerse herself in the world that made her one of TV’s gentlest auteurs. Sherman-Palladino hasn’t always had the best of luck since she was forced to leave Gilmore Girls in 2006, before its seventh and final season began production. Her 2008 Fox comedy The Return of Jezebel James flailed when she tried to put her signature whiplash-inducing dialogue in front of a live studio audience. Her dance dramedy Bunheads , which ran for one season on ABC Family in 2012 and 2013, was tremendous television, but tremendous television that nobody watched. And there were several failed pilots and abandoned projects in between. Related Every episode of Gilmore Girls, ranked Even when she was working on other stuff, Sherman-Palladino used to tease the idea that she would love to return to Gilmores’ world, either for a movie or something more substantial. She even suggested that she already knew the series’ final four words of dialogue and refused to reveal them to journalists, hoping she would eventually get to put them on screen. (Yes, they cap off A Year in the Life , and they’re a little bizarre.) Now she’s finally fulfilled her dream of going back to Stars Hollow — and the result is messy. Every one of A Year in the Life ’s four episodes — one for each season of the year — is 90 minutes long, introducing Gilmore Girls to the concept of Netflix bloat. They all contain long scenes that just sort of sit there, seemingly just to fill space. Like most Netflix shows, A Year in the Life might be better at two-thirds or three-quarters of its current running time. Rory and Lorelai still have a really co-dependent relationship. Netflix Sherman-Palladino collaborated on the revival with her husband, Daniel Palladino ; she wrote and directed \"Winter\" and \"Fall,\" and he wrote and directed \"Spring\" and \"Summer.\" The couple has made an effort to incorporate cameos for nearly every character from the original series, major or minor, and while a few of them are fun ( Liza Weil’s Paris Geller will always be Gilmore Girls ’ stealth scene-stealer), the majority end up feeling like pointless time-sucks. When they’re not indulging in Gilmore Girls nostalgia, they’re ceding the stage to lengthy bits featuring either actors from Bunheads (including that show’s star, Sutton Foster , in a bit that’s hilarious but goes on forever ) or actors from Parenthood , the show Graham went on to star in after Gilmore Girls ended. So, yes, it’s self-indulgent. But A Year in the Life succeeds despite its \"getting the gang back together\" vibe. Both Palladinos use this opportunity to interrogate the core insecurities of the three most prominent Gilmore women — Lorelai, Rory, and grandmother Emily ( Kelly Bishop ) — and to explore the trio’s grief in the wake of Gilmore patriarch Richard’s death. ( Edward Herrmann , who played the character, died in 2014.) This turns out to be surprisingly masterful. In the final two installments of A Year in the Life , the Palladinos flirt with touching the third rail of their own show — namely, the notion that even if you’re stuck in a charming, quaint little town that takes care of its citizens, you’re still stuck. As Lorelai realizes that other people in her life are moving on to better things and Rory finds herself ensnared in career frustrations, the two start to wonder if living in Stars Hollow is more of a curse than blessing. Gilmore Girls might be a bubble, but it’s one you’ll want to live in This tension between blessing and curse has always made Gilmore Girls a great TV show, more bittersweet and less twee than its reputation. Essentially everything about the series that makes you say, \"Oh, I wish my life was like that!\" is also the sort of thing that becomes harder to take if you consider it from a slightly different angle. Rory and Lorelai are more like friends than family, but their co-dependence makes it hard for Rory to escape both her home and Stars Hollow. It also leads, in both the original series and this one, to some genuinely terrible arguments, where neither participant is right but both say horrible things. Similarly, Stars Hollow is a perfect, idyllic little town, but it’s also too perfect, like the sort of town you might visit on vacation and wish to stay in forever in a Twilight Zone episode, only to realize your wish had become literal truth. Nothing ever changes in Stars Hollow, just as nothing ever changes on our favorite television shows. To quote a very Gilmore Girls -y band, The Decemberists: What a terrible world, what a beautiful world. Town hall meetings for everyone! Netflix Gilmore Girls has always struggled to depict the world beyond Stars Hollow, because its central tensions require the town to be a hazy oasis, slightly untouched by time. (It has the internet and smartphones, but otherwise might as well exist in 1985 or 1945.) That’s especially true in A Year in the Life , as Rory flits between the big, wide world and Stars Hollow itself, or as the show takes side-trips to California, London, and New York. But it also underlines why Gilmore Girls has become such a pivotal show for many of its biggest fans, and why its name has become synonymous (sometimes with an unmerited and snide cynicism) with the idea of watching TV for comfort and warmth. Stars Hollow might be a bubble, but it’s a kind, loving bubble. You might yearn to escape it. You might even need to escape it for your own personal growth, but it will always take you back. Gilmore Girls aired at the dawn of TV’s antihero age, when Tony Soprano and his progeny strode the primetime landscape like colossi. As such, the show, with its goofy asides, episodes where nothing happened, and fleet of small-townweirdos, was too often written off as a candy-covered trifle — good, but insubstantial. Those criticisms missed how smart the show is about money and class (particularly when it comes to Lorelai’s attempts to put her own upper-class past behind her), or how beautifully it deals with intergenerational strife. And they occasionally made too much of the show’s sealed-off quality, the sense that, yes, everything took place inside a snow globe. But A Year in the Life only underlines that those criticisms also missed how aware the series is of the bubble it exists in. Stars Hollow isn’t real. With its perfect surfaces, cascade of strange but lovable characters, and willingness to believe that understanding and compassion are stronger than fear, how could it be? We see evidence to the contrary every day. And yet, here it is, again, like Brigadoon, the legendary Scottish village from the musical of the same name, which disappears for centuries at a time, only to resurface whenever you might need it most. Look again, before the dream fades once more. Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life begins streaming on Netflix Friday, November 25. Watch: How a TV show gets made Was this article helpful?",

If you’d like BosTen delivered to your inbox every Thursday, click here . Want more things to do? Check\nHigh School Football at Fenway Park High school rivals across the state will be facing off in their annual Thanksgiving games, but if you don’t have a local alma mater to cheer on, what better place to catch a game than Fenway Park? The home of the Red Sox will be hosting doubleheaders on Wednesday and Thursday between local powerhouses like Xaverian, St. John’s Prep, BC High, and Catholic Memorial. (Wednesday, November 23 at 4 p.m. and Thursday, November 24 at 9 a.m.; Fenway Park; $20; all ages)\nRun a Turkey Trot Hoping to work up an appetite before the big meal? Many towns in the area are holding Turkey Trots on Thanksgiving morning, including Boston , Lowell , and Attleborough . No matter where you are in the state, there should be a Thanksgiving-themed 5K nearby. (Thursday, November 24; various times, locations, and prices; all ages)\nManchester by the Sea Manchester by the Sea has been getting lots of positive buzz for months now, including a recent four-star review from The Boston Globe ‘s Ty Burr. Now, the film set on the North Shore about a Quincy janitor (Casey Affleck) forced into raising his nephew is in theaters this weekend. Burr tries to avoid building the film up too much in his review, but we’ll say it: Kenneth Lonergan’s latest is a masterpiece. (Limited engagement begins Thursday, November 24; various times, locations, and prices; rated R)\nThe Nutcracker Along with the arrival of many other holiday standbys, Boston Ballet’s first performance of The Nutcracker is on Friday. Choreographed by Boston Ballet artistic director Mikko Nissinen, the performance is sure to be masterful as always. (Opens Friday, November 25; various times; The Boston Opera House; $35+)\nSkating at Frog Pond With a cold but successful free opening day of skating on Tuesday, the Frog Pond ice rink reopened for the season. Even though skating was only free for opening day, the prices (and the atmosphere) make the Frog Pond a bargain. (Friday November 25 and Saturday, November 26 from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. and Sunday, November 27 from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m.; Boston Common Frog Pond; $6 for skaters 58 inches and over, free for skaters 58 inches and under; all ages)\nPhotos on the Field with Santa at Gillette Stadium Ever dreamed of standing on the same gridiron that Tom Brady patrols on any given Sunday? Patriot Place is opening its doors for a chance to step on the field and snap a photo with Kris Kringle in exchange for a donation of a gently used coat or hat and glove set to Cradles to Crayons . There will also be free grilled cheese, music from 103.3 AMP Radio, and ice skating while you wait. (Saturday, November 26 from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m; Gillette Stadium; donation of clothing or $20; all ages)\nHelping the Homeless Thanksgiving isn’t just about giving thanks, it’s about giving back. We highlighted 60 ways you can give back this holiday season, but one in particular is the Blessing Bags for the Homeless event, hosted by the United Sisters of Color , a local organization that hits the streets each November to hand out bags full of living essentials like toothpaste, soap, and pairs of socks to those in need. (Saturday, November 26 from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m.; Lena Park Community Center; free; all ages)\nThe Charles Hotel Annual Tree Lighting Event Though it may not match the pageantry (or television coverage) of the Faneuil Hall tree lighting, Cambridge has a holiday tree lighting ceremony of its own outside the Charles Hotel in Harvard Square. Along with live performances and an appearance from Santa Claus, this family-themed event will also have free hot chocolate and cookies from Shake Shack and Henrietta’s Table, respectively. (Saturday, November 26; entertainment starts at 4 p.m., tree lighting at 5:30 p.m.; The Charles Hotel; free; all ages)\nBoston Tuba Christmas Concert More than 150 tuba players will serenade Faneuil Hall with loads of holiday tunes for the 31st consecutive year. (Saturday, November 26 at 2 p.m.; Faneuil Hall Marketplace; free; all ages)\nStar Wars Night and Zoo Lights at Stone Zoo With Rogue One flying into theaters next month, the Stone Zoo is celebrating with a themed Star Wars night that coincides with the opening of Zoo Lights , the festive animal-themed light display that takes over the zoo each winter. Scattered among the animals and twinkling displays will be local members of the 501st Legion dressed in movie-quality Star Wars costumes, on hand to take photographs with adoring fans. The zoo is encouraging visitors to wear their own Star Wars costumes as well. (Sunday, November 27 from 5 p.m. to 8 p.m.; $9 general admission, $8 for zoo members; all ages)",

      "text": "Netflix \nThe 10-year wait for a \"Gilmore Girls\" television reunion will be over on Friday when Netflix releases the miniseries \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life.\"\nOnce a seemingly impossible feat, it took one event and the right content company to make the revival happen.\n\"I lobbied for it for years,\" Scott Patterson, who played diner owner and Lorelai's love interest Luke on the series, recently told Business Insider. \"I really tried to take up the cause for the fans, because I know they wanted it so badly and deservedly so. It was a concerted effort over a number of years.\"\n\"Gilmore Girls\" followed young, single mom Lorelai (Lauren Graham) and her daughter/best friend Rory (Alexis Bledel), who live in a small, quirky New England town. Lorelai's past comes back to haunt her when she realizes that she has to ask her parents (played by Kelly Bishop and the late Edward Herrmann) for a loan so she can send Lorelai to a highly regarded private high school.\nPatterson and many of the WB-turned-CW show's stars went on to pretty successful careers. Meanwhile, the fan base for \"Gilmore Girls\" grew to include its original viewers and a whole new generation of fans who were able to watch the show via DVD, On Demand, and streaming.\nBuzz around the show seemed at an all-time high when a growing TV festival held in Austin, Texas, the ATX Festival, planned to reunite the show's creator Amy Sherman-Palladino and its cast for a panel in 2015.\nNetflix \"I had virtually given up hope, but then ATX Festival in Austin in the summer of 2015 kind of changed the temperature on the whole thing,\" Patterson said. \"I saw that it might happen and it did.\"\nAt the festival's reunion , Sherman-Palladino said that a reunion was not in the works, but left the possibility open.\n\"It would have to be the right everything — the right format, the right timing,\" she said of the potential project. \"It would have to be honored in a certain way. If it ever came around, I think we would all jump in and do it. If it ever happened, I promise we’ll do it correctly.\"\nPatterson told us he got a phone call from  Sherman - Palladino not long after the festival. In an interview with TVLine , the show's creator said she got verbal agreements from the four leads — Graham, Bledel, Bishop, and Patterson — before pitching the show to three outlets, including Netflix.\nNetflix was an ideal creative partner for several reasons. Not only does it stream all seven seasons of the \"Gilmore Girls\" run, but its programming president counted the show among the company's most popular offerings . Second, ratings aren't the bottom line at Netflix. Its business is in signing up more subscribers. After all, \"Gilmore Girls\" was never a highly rated show and ranked No. 129 on TV  during its final season. Those aren't promising numbers for outlets that depend on ratings.\n\"I knew Amy and [producing partner and husband] Dan [Palladino] would write good material given the newfound freedom they had with Netflix, that they didn’t have to adhere to any deep ratings considerations,\" Patterson said. \"Netflix is filled with very bright people who had a vision for this and how to reboot it.\"\nNOW WATCH: The 7 best TV shows on Netflix you've probably never heard of \n",

      "text": "print \nLauren Graham, left, and Alexis Bledel star on \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life.\" Netflix \nThe 10-year wait for a \"Gilmore Girls\" television reunion will be over on Friday when Netflix releases the miniseries \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life.\" \nOnce a seemingly impossible feat, it took one event and the right content company to make the revival happen. \n\"I lobbied for it for years,\" Scott Patterson, who played diner owner and Lorelai's love interest Luke on the series, recently told Business Insider. \"I really tried to take up the cause for the fans, because I know they wanted it so badly and deservedly so. It was a concerted effort over a number of years.\" \n\"Gilmore Girls\" followed young, single mom Lorelai (Lauren Graham) and her daughter/best friend Rory (Alexis Bledel), who live in a small, quirky New England town. Lorelai's past comes back to haunt her when she realizes that she has to ask her wealthy, judgmental parents (played by Kelly Bishop and the late Edward Herrmann) for a loan so she can send Lorelai to a highly regarded private high school. \nPatterson and many of the WB-turned-CW show's stars went on to pretty successful careers. Meanwhile, the fan base for \"Gilmore Girls\" grew to include its original viewers and a whole new generation of fans who were able to watch the show via DVD, On Demand, and streaming. \nBuzz around the show seemed at an all-time high when a growing TV festival held in Austin, Texas, the ATX Festival, planned to reunite the show's creator Amy Sherman-Palladino and its cast for a panel in 2015. \nScott Patterson, Lauren Graham, and Alexis Bledel on \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life.\" Saeed Adyani/Netflix \n\"I had virtually given up hope, but then ATX Festival in Austin in the summer of 2015 kind of changed the temperature on the whole thing,\" Patterson said. \"I saw that it might happen and it did.\" \nAt the festival's reunion , Sherman-Palladino said that a reunion was not in the works, but left the possibility open. \n\"It would have to be the right everything — the right format, the right timing,\" she said of the potential project. \"It would have to be honored in a certain way. If it ever came around, I think we would all jump in and do it. If it ever happened, I promise we’ll do it correctly.\" \nPatterson told us he got a phone call from Sherman - Palladino not long after the festival. In an interview with TVLine , the show's creator said she got verbal agreements from the four leads — Graham, Bledel, Bishop, and Patterson — before pitching the show to three outlets, including Netflix. \nNetflix was an ideal creative partner for several reasons. Not only does it stream all seven seasons of the \"Gilmore Girls\" run, but its programming president counted the show among the company's most popular offerings . Second, ratings aren't the bottom line at Netflix. Its business is in signing up more subscribers. After all, \"Gilmore Girls\" was never a highly rated show and ranked No. 129 on TV during its final season. Those aren't promising numbers for outlets that depend on ratings. \n\"I knew Amy and [producing partner and husband] Dan [Palladino] would write good material given the newfound freedom they had with Netflix, that they didn’t have to adhere to any deep ratings considerations,\" Patterson said. \"Netflix is filled with very bright people who had a vision for this and how to reboot it.\"",

      "text": "(Lauren Graham, left, and Alexis Bledel star on \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life.\"Netflix) \nThe nine-year wait for a \"Gilmore Girls\" television reunion will be over on Friday when Netflix releases the miniseries \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life.\" \nOnce a seemingly impossible feat, it took one event and the right content company to make the revival happen.\n\"I lobbied for it for years,\" Scott Patterson, who played diner owner and Lorelai's love interest Luke on the series, recently told Business Insider. \"I really tried to take up the cause for the fans, because I know they wanted it so badly and deservedly so. It was a concerted effort over a number of years.\"\n\"Gilmore Girls\" followed young, single mom Lorelai (Lauren Graham) and her daughter/best friend Rory (Alexis Bledel), who live in a small, quirky New England town. Lorelai's past comes back to haunt her when she realizes that she has to ask her wealthy, judgmental parents (played by Kelly Bishop and the late Edward Herrmann) for a loan so she can send Lorelai to a highly regarded private high school.\nPatterson and many of the WB-turned-CW show's stars went on to pretty successful careers. Meanwhile, the fan base for \"Gilmore Girls\" grew to include its original viewers and a whole new generation of fans who were able to watch the show via DVD, On Demand, and streaming.\nBuzz around the show seemed at an all-time high when a growing TV festival held in Austin, Texas, the ATX Festival, planned to reunite the show's creator Amy Sherman-Palladino and its cast for a panel in 2015.\n(Scott Patterson, Lauren Graham, and Alexis Bledel on \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life.\"Saeed Adyani/Netflix) \n\"I had virtually given up hope, but then ATX Festival in Austin in the summer of 2015 kind of changed the temperature on the whole thing,\" Patterson said. \"I saw that it might happen and it did.\" \nAt the festival's reunion , Sherman-Palladino said that a reunion was not in the works, but left the possibility open.\n\"It would have to be the right everything — the right format, the right timing,\" she said of the potential project. \"It would have to be honored in a certain way. If it ever came around, I think we would all jump in and do it. If it ever happened, I promise we’ll do it correctly.\"\nPatterson told us he got a phone call from Sherman - Palladino not long after the festival. In an interview with TVLine , the show's creator said she got verbal agreements from the four leads — Graham, Bledel, Bishop, and Patterson — before pitching the show to three outlets, including Netflix.\nNetflix was an ideal creative partner for several reasons. Not only does it stream all seven seasons of the \"Gilmore Girls\" run, but its programming president counted the show among the company's most popular offerings . Second, ratings aren't the bottom line at Netflix. Its business is in signing up more subscribers. After all, \"Gilmore Girls\" was never a highly rated show and ranked No. 129 on TV during its final season. Those aren't promising numbers for outlets that depend on ratings.\n\"I knew Amy and [producing partner and husband] Dan [Palladino] would write good material given the newfound freedom they had with Netflix, that they didn’t have to adhere to any deep ratings considerations,\" Patterson said. \"Netflix is filled with very bright people who had a vision for this and how to reboot it.\"\nNOW WATCH: The 7 best TV shows on Netflix you've probably never heard of \n\nMore From Business Insider \nNetflix's 'Gilmore Girls' revival is almost everything fans wanted from it \nDave Chappelle is reportedly making $60 million for his Netflix comedy specials \nNetflix is releasing 3 new comedy specials from Dave Chappelle",

      "text": "You’ve heard of “Netflix and Chill?” It turns out if could be just the opposite.\nA new study out of Denmark suggests all that binge-watching could be lowering your sperm count.\nAccording to FoxNews.com, men who logged 5 or more hours of TV per day had 29 percent lower sperm concentration and 34 percent lower sperm counts than men who didn’t watch any TV.\nSo is this the same for all sedentary activity? Apparently not.\nMen who played on the computer for the same amount of time didn’t experience a drop in those semen parameters.\nResearchers said they can’t yet pinpoint what it is about TV that is so harmful to sperm.\nStudy coauthor Lærke Priskorn, Ph.D.(c) of the University of Copenhagen said it’s possible all the stillness increases the temperature in the scrotum, which can mess with sperm production.\nShe said the lack of exercise could also be to blame.\nOr it could just be the men who watch a ton of TV are also more likely to be overweight or drink excessively, both of which hurt your sperm, Priskorn notes.\nSee the full story on FoxNews.com.

      "text": "Tweet \nThe announcement of three new brand new stand-up specials starring Dave Chappelle who is on somewhat of a comeback 2016 has brought many of you to our site searching for whether or not the famed Chapelle’s Show is streaming on Netflix. Let’s take a look. \nDave Chappelle, a well-known comedian is mostly known for his hit show back in the mid-2000’s called Chappelle’s show. The series only lasted for two seasons after Dave walked and has gone very quiet ever since. The network it aired on, Comedy Central, managed to scrape together enough for a third season but that meant the end of Dave Chappelle. \nA newly signed deal allegedly has hit the $60 million mark will see Dave bring three new stand-up specials to the service alongside many other well-known comics that have made the leap onto Netflix. The news comes off the back of him presenting Saturday Night Live the Saturday after the US election. \nThe sketch comedy series to this day ranks well on major top lists in both comedy and TV in general. It’s produced some memes which are still very much rampant today. \nSadly, Chappelle’s Show isn’t available on Netflix in the US nor is it available anywhere else in the world so let’s first take a look as to why, whether it will be coming and alternative places to stream it. \nComedy Central is owned by Viacom which famously pulled the majority of their catalog away from Netflix a few years a go favoring their own and other platforms. \nWhen Netflix picks up some shows it often buys the back-catalog too but given that Netflix is only buying Chappelle’s time for three unique comedy specials, unrelated to the show in question, that’s unlikely to happen here. \nFinally, if you’re in the US, you’re in luck as the Comedy Central website hosts all of the episodes across all seasons on their website for free but with advertisements. \nHopefully that gives you some insight as to why it’s not streaming on Netflix.

      "text": "5 things to know about the actor playing Barack Obama in Netflix film, Barry 4 hours ago Image: Netflix/YouTube Print Devon Terrell totally nailed President Barack Obama's accent, so it's hard to imagine this is his first major role Share \nMore: Witness the moments that defined Barack Obama in new Netflix film Barry \nThe film is a biopic about President Barack Obama during his years at Columbia University, and focuses on the challenges Obama faced growing up, including brushes with racism and a feeling of not fitting in as a mixed-race man. What you may not know is that the actor taking on the role of Obama is Australia's Devon Terrell — yes, he nailed Obama's accent — and he's just as interesting. Here's why... 1. It's Terrell's first acting credit \nJudging from the trailer of the film, Terrell is perfect for the role (and it must be a daunting task taking on the role of the 44th president of the United States) so it's even more surprising to learn that this is actually his first acting credit. Impressive, right? 2. Although he did previously land another role \nMore: Barack and Michelle Obama go way back with Hamilton 's Lin-Manuel Miranda 3. He transformed his life in preparation for the role \nAccording to the Sydney Morning Herald , Terrell had two months to prepare for the role before they began filming, and during this time, he was dedicated to making his performance as authentic as possible. Some examples include the fact that he started writing with his left hand and practised playing basketball from the left. 4. He actually shares some similarities with Obama \nTerrell was born in Long Beach, California, before moving to Perth at age 5, but one similarity he shares with Obama is the fact that he too was born to parents of different races: an African-American father and an Anglo-Indian mother. Meaning the scenes in Barry that portray a conflicted Obama struggling with his background are ones that Terrell can deeply relate to. \n\"I read the story and I had such an emotional connection to it and I said that's me, someone just summed up my life,\" he said. \"I've had very similar experiences, moving to Australia and having to change my accent and go to school. And I've never met a person who's Anglo-Indian and African-American.\" \nMore: Here's what President Obama said to Malia and Sasha about the election 5. He wants to do Obama justice \nWhile it's not easy taking on the role of such an incredible man, Terrell does hope that Barack Obama gets to see the movie, and that he gives him the thumbs up. \"I hope he goes, 'Yeah, I think you were close enough,'\" he said. \nThe film premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival earlier this year and will make its debut on Netflix on Dec. 16.

      "text": "When Netflix announced that the release date for the \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life\" revival would be Nov. 25, the day after Thanksgiving , one fact became clear: Many relatives will be ignored during this holiday.\nThe most-anticipated show of the year will land on Netflix at 3:01 a.m. ET on Friday, and it's not a stretch to say that quite a few people will wake up the next morning and immediately start streaming the series, which is four 90-minute episodes. Sorry, parents who need help cleaning the kitchen or cousins who want to go Black Friday shopping -- \"Gilmore Girls\" is top priority.\nIf you need help explaining to your family why you're barricading yourself in your room on Friday, and potentially into the weekend, here's a guide, with questions from the perspective of a non-\"Gilmore Girls\" viewer:\nQ: Why is the Internet melting down over this revival? Don't old TV shows come back all the time these days?\nA: Fair point! But \"Gilmore Girls\" is still a pretty big deal. The show went off-air in 2007 after the seventh and final season, but the ending was a huge disappointment for fans. Creator Amy Sherman-Palladino and her husband, executive producer Dan Palladino, walked away after the sixth season when they couldn't come to a financial agreement with the studio. It was complicated.\nQ: Why is that a big deal?\nA: Not to get too cliche here, but the Palladinos were the heart and soul of the series. \"Gilmore Girls\" is known (and loved) for its rapid-fire, whip-smart dialogue filled with pop-culture references, and it takes a very specific person to carry that voice.\n\"It's horrifying. It's like a freaking nightmare,\" Sherman-Palladino said in response to passing off the show to a new executive producer for the final season. Yet that's what happened -- and it was too obvious in the seventh season that new people were in charge. The dialogue dragged, storylines were nonsense, and a beloved series limped away to the disappointment of a fiercely loyal fanbase.\n'Gilmore Girls' Saeed Adyani / Netflix Alexis Bledel, left, and Lauren Graham star as Rory and Lorelai in the highly anticipated \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life.\"\nAlexis Bledel, left, and Lauren Graham star as Rory and Lorelai in the highly anticipated \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life.\"\n(Saeed Adyani / Netflix) Anyway, the Palladinos are back in charge of the revival. This is very exciting closure for fans, because now they'll be able to see the end of the series the way the creator originally intended. Also, for years, Sherman-Palladino has teased that she's always known what the last four words of the show would be; the mystery surrounding the final line has reached almost mythical status. Mythical!\nQ: So what's the show about again?\nA: I would be shocked that you asked that, except as my friend Nick recently put it, \"Sure, I know the Gilmore girls. Lisa Gilmore and Juanita Gilmore. One's a mom, one's a girl, something something Yale.\"\nUh, close. \"Gilmore Girls\" is about the adventures of Lorelai ( Lauren Graham ) and Rory (Alexis Bledel), a quirky mother-daughter duo who are best friends. They live in a small, dreamy New England town. Lorelai got pregnant when she was 16, which caused a lifelong rift with her wealthy, traditional parents, and she ran away from home once Rory was born. The series starts as Rory is 16 and gets into a fancy private school, and Lorelai is forced to ask her parents for money for Rory's tuition. They say yes, but as a condition, her mother (Kelly Bishop) insists that they come to dinner every Friday night. And so the generational drama begins. (And yes, Rory eventually goes to Yale.)\nQ: Why are people still so excited about a show that ended almost 10 years ago?\nA: I could write a book about why \"Gilmore Girls\" is so magical, but in practical terms, the show got a second life a couple years ago when Netflix made all seven seasons available. The enormous response showed Netflix executives that they should probably capitalize on this momentum (there's basically a cottage industry of \"Gilmore Girls\" memorabilia, GIFs, quizzes and thinkpieces) and order up a revival.\nQ: Can I watch it if I've never seen the show before?\nA: The revival is almost 100 percent fan service, full of inside jokes and callbacks to the original show. But if you want to spend time with your family member who is ignoring you, go for it! You just might not understand anything -- and you might not want to interrupt with questions.\nRELATED STORIES:\n'Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life' review: Overstuffed, but warm and reassuring\nFrom a pile of index cards to the rebirth of Stars Hollow: Inside 'Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life'\nFive reasons the 'Gilmore Girls' revival needed Melissa McCarthy\nFirst-look photos from the new 'Gilmore Girls' revival\nCheck out the latest movie reviews from Michael Phillips and the Chicago Tribune.\nCheck out reviews for all new music releases from Tribune music critic Greg Kot.",

      "text": "When Netflix announced that the release date for the \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life\" revival would be Nov. 25, the day after Thanksgiving , one fact became clear: Many relatives will be ignored during this holiday.\nThe most-anticipated show of the year will land on Netflix at 3:01 a.m. ET on Friday, and it's not a stretch to say that quite a few people will wake up the next morning and immediately start streaming the series, which is four 90-minute episodes. Sorry, parents who need help cleaning the kitchen or cousins who want to go Black Friday shopping -- \"Gilmore Girls\" is top priority.\nIf you need help explaining to your family why you're barricading yourself in your room on Friday, and potentially into the weekend, here's a guide, with questions from the perspective of a non-\"Gilmore Girls\" viewer:\nQ: Why is the Internet melting down over this revival? Don't old TV shows come back all the time these days?\nA: Fair point! But \"Gilmore Girls\" is still a pretty big deal. The show went off-air in 2007 after the seventh and final season, but the ending was a huge disappointment for fans. Creator Amy Sherman-Palladino and her husband, executive producer Dan Palladino, walked away after the sixth season when they couldn't come to a financial agreement with the studio. It was complicated.\nQ: Why is that a big deal?\nA: Not to get too cliche here, but the Palladinos were the heart and soul of the series. \"Gilmore Girls\" is known (and loved) for its rapid-fire, whip-smart dialogue filled with pop-culture references, and it takes a very specific person to carry that voice.\n\"It's horrifying. It's like a freaking nightmare,\" Sherman-Palladino said in response to passing off the show to a new executive producer for the final season. Yet that's what happened -- and it was too obvious in the seventh season that new people were in charge. The dialogue dragged, storylines were nonsense, and a beloved series limped away to the disappointment of a fiercely loyal fanbase.\n'Gilmore Girls' Saeed Adyani / Netflix Alexis Bledel, left, and Lauren Graham star as Rory and Lorelai in the highly anticipated \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life.\"\nAlexis Bledel, left, and Lauren Graham star as Rory and Lorelai in the highly anticipated \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life.\"\n(Saeed Adyani / Netflix) Anyway, the Palladinos are back in charge of the revival. This is very exciting closure for fans, because now they'll be able to see the end of the series the way the creator originally intended. Also, for years, Sherman-Palladino has teased that she's always known what the last four words of the show would be; the mystery surrounding the final line has reached almost mythical status. Mythical!\nQ: So what's the show about again?\nA: I would be shocked that you asked that, except as my friend Nick recently put it, \"Sure, I know the Gilmore girls. Lisa Gilmore and Juanita Gilmore. One's a mom, one's a girl, something something Yale.\"\nUh, close. \"Gilmore Girls\" is about the adventures of Lorelai ( Lauren Graham ) and Rory (Alexis Bledel), a quirky mother-daughter duo who are best friends. They live in a small, dreamy New England town. Lorelai got pregnant when she was 16, which caused a lifelong rift with her wealthy, traditional parents, and she ran away from home once Rory was born. The series starts as Rory is 16 and gets into a fancy private school, and Lorelai is forced to ask her parents for money for Rory's tuition. They say yes, but as a condition, her mother (Kelly Bishop) insists that they come to dinner every Friday night. And so the generational drama begins. (And yes, Rory eventually goes to Yale.)\nQ: Why are people still so excited about a show that ended almost 10 years ago?\nA: I could write a book about why \"Gilmore Girls\" is so magical, but in practical terms, the show got a second life a couple years ago when Netflix made all seven seasons available. The enormous response showed Netflix executives that they should probably capitalize on this momentum (there's basically a cottage industry of \"Gilmore Girls\" memorabilia, GIFs, quizzes and thinkpieces) and order up a revival.\nQ: Can I watch it if I've never seen the show before?\nA: The revival is almost 100 percent fan service, full of inside jokes and callbacks to the original show. But if you want to spend time with your family member who is ignoring you, go for it! You just might not understand anything -- and you might not want to interrupt with questions.\nRELATED STORIES:\n'Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life' review: Overstuffed, but warm and reassuring\nFrom a pile of index cards to the rebirth of Stars Hollow: Inside 'Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life'\nFive reasons the 'Gilmore Girls' revival needed Melissa McCarthy\nFirst-look photos from the new 'Gilmore Girls' revival\nCheck out the latest movie reviews from Michael Phillips and the Chicago Tribune.\nCheck out reviews for all new music releases from Tribune music critic Greg Kot.\n Thanksgiving Lauren Graham Black Friday (shopping)",

      "title": "Binge-Watching The Story Of Queen Elizabeth With Netflix ‘The Crown’",
      "text": "\nAfter watching the first few episodes of Netflix The Crown, it’s clear that the show is rich in so many things, from scenery to costuming, to acting, but with only ten episodes in the first season, it is over too fast, and it will be about another year before season two is ready. But with The Crown, there are so many details and intricacies that are easily missed, watching season one on Netflix a second time makes sense. That’s why The Crown is perfect binge-watching for the Thanksgiving holiday (at least until Gilmore Girls is released on Friday).\nPeter Morgan, the creator of Netflix The Crown set out to make the story of the life of Queen Elizabeth an epic, and a piece of modern history that could be easily digested in a Netflix serial format, says the Inquisitr . Morgan wants to tell the full story without rushing it, and the best place to start seemed to be with the wedding of Princess Elizabeth and Prince Philip.\nHad the story started when Elizabeth rose to the throne, then viewers might not have understood all the bedlam that the abdication of King Edward VIII caused when his brother, King George VI was forced to take the crown in his absence. Even after the death of Queen Elizabeth’s father, Edward VIII, and his wife, Wallis Warfield Simpson, the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, continue to be a thorn in the side of the royals.\nIt’s November 20th, 1947. The day of the royal wedding is upon us. What a momentous occasion it is! pic.twitter.com/fPao8rZWC3 \n— The Crown (@TheCrownNetflix) November 20, 2016 \n\nEspecially in the United States, Queen Elizabeth is a little old lady, with a vast collection of hats, that enjoys the company of a pack of Corgis , but The Star says that the Netflix series The Crown shows Queen Elizabeth as a mother, a wife, a sister, and a daughter, at first ahead of being a queen. The Crown shows Claire Foy as Queen Elizabeth, practicing walking back and forth with the five pound crown she will wear for her coronation, while her children, Princess Anne and Prince Charles toddle behind her. The stoic queen we have come to know looks like a young woman playing dress-up.\nRELATED REPORTS BY INQUISITR\nNetflix ‘The Crown’ Is Portraying Prince Philip As A Bit Of A Jerk \nNew Series ‘The Crown’ Is The Most Expensive Yet By Netflix \nNetflix: ‘The Crown’ Creator Talks Season Two And Hints At Season… \nNetflix ‘The Crown’ Season 2 Is Official, But The Main Cast Is Being… \nThe Crown is the most expensive Netflix series yet, and it seems they got what they paid for, as the costuming, down to the pearls, shoes, and royal accoutrements are spot on. Even the horses are adorned in beyond their Sunday best. So if fans of the series just spend the day, bingeing to watch the costume changes, it is time well spent for a royal watching junkie.\nA Netflix Show Just For Me #StreamTeam #TheCrown https://t.co/zK7465dD3p via @julienowell \n— Teresa Bowen (@myquiltinglife) November 24, 2016 \n\nThe Daily Mail says that though Claire Foy as Queen Elizabeth and John Lithgow as Winston Churchill are amazing, the real stars to watch for are the 20k costumes in the first season alone of The Crown . Michele Clapton is one of the costume designers and dressers on the set of The Crown , and she is in charge of tightening Foy’s Queen Elizabeth into her corsets.\n“She has a tiny 23 in waist Little by little, I’d tighten it to give her that neat shape — though I did let her take it off to eat.”\nClapton, a designer out of Oxfordshire, says that 20k costumes is probably a conservative estimate, and the whole idea was overwhelming.\n“It was a daunting prospect,’ she admits — and, with 293 speaking parts, 7,000 extras and a costume department of up to 100 people.”\nJust to create a replica of Queen Elizabeth’s wedding gown cost over $40k to recreate. Clapton said she had to use fabric spray to age many fabrics to make them look older on-screen.\nİlk bölümden sardı. İzlenmesi gereken bir dizi; The Crown @netflix pic.twitter.com/7wRVUbRxDp \n— Ozan Tatar (@ozantatar) November 23, 2016 \n\nSo, perhaps doing a binge round just as a twentieth century fashion show might be an option for the diehard viewer on a long holiday weekend.\nHave you watched The Crown yet?

      "text": "Steven Avery , the subject of the Netflix series Making a Murderer , has something to give thanks for this Thanksgiving after a judge on Wednesday ordered new testing of evidence for his case.\nAvery’s lawyer, Kathleen Zellner, said an agreement to start independent scientific testing on critical pieces of evidence was signed, according to CBS News .\nThe agreement comes nearly three months after Zellner pledged she had a plan to overturn his 2007 conviction.\nAvery was sentenced to life in prison after being convicted of first-degree intentional homicide in the 2005 death of photographer Teresa Halbach in Manitowoc County, Wisconsin.\nAmong the evidence to be tested, Avery’s blood sample will be included.\nZellner said she feels encouraged that the attorney general’s office was “helpful in expediting these tests.”\nEarlier this month, a judge granted the release of Brendan Dassey , Avery’s nephew, who was convicted in 2007 of helping his uncle allegedly rape, kill and mutilate Halbach. He was a 16-year-old high school sophomore when he received a life sentence in prison. Dassey remains in prison after a federal appeals court blocked his release .\nDassey confessed to police but later recanted, while Avery has long stood by his innocence. Making a Murderer shed light on the crime they were both convicted of, but questioned, among other things, the testing of evidence linking Avery to Halbach’s murder.\nAvery was previously convicted of rape and served 18 years in prison before being exonerated after DNA testing proved his innocence.",

      "text": "Email Netflix \nSteven Avery , the subject of the Netflix series Making a Murderer , has something to give thanks for this Thanksgiving after a judge on Wednesday ordered new testing of evidence for his case. \nAvery’s lawyer, Kathleen Zellner, said an agreement to start independent scientific testing on critical pieces of evidence was signed, according to CBS News . \nThe agreement comes nearly three months after Zellner pledged she had a plan to overturn his 2007 conviction. \nAvery was sentenced to life in prison after being convicted of first-degree intentional homicide in the 2005 death of photographer Teresa Halbach in Manitowoc County, Wisconsin. \nAmong the evidence to be tested, Avery’s blood sample will be included. \nZellner said she feels encouraged that the attorney general’s office was “helpful in expediting these tests.” \nEarlier this month, a judge granted the release of Brendan Dassey , Avery’s nephew, who was convicted in 2007 of helping his uncle allegedly rape, kill and mutilate Halbach. He was a 16-year-old high school sophomore when he received a life sentence in prison. Dassey remains in prison after a federal appeals court blocked his release . \nDassey confessed to police but later recanted, while Avery has long stood by his innocence. Making a Murderer shed light on the crime they were both convicted of, but questioned, among other things, the testing of evidence linking Avery to Halbach’s murder. \nAvery was previously convicted of rape and served 18 years in prison before being exonerated after DNA testing proved his innocence.

      "text": "3 Thanksgiving films you can stream on Netflix By Francis Navarro, Komando.com \nIf you want to binge watch and chill out during the holidays, there's no shortage of Christmas movies on Netflix - just try searching for \"Christmas\" and you'll be gifted with quite a vast selection. \nThanksgiving movies, on the other hand, are in short supply. They do exist, though. Here are three Thanksgiving-themed movies you can stream on Netflix right now: 1. Dutch \nConsidered a flop when it was released in 1991, the John Hughes-penned \"Dutch\" is actually a very underrated Thanksgiving comedy movie that's worth a look. \nStarring Ed O'Neill of \"Married With Children\" as Dutch Dooley, it's about a working-class man who volunteers to go on a road trip to pick up his girlfriend's son, only to find out that he's not exactly the nicest kid around. 2. Four Brothers \nNot your typical holiday movie, \"Four Brothers\" is a revenge thriller directed by John Singleton and it stars Mark Wahlberg and Tyrese Gibson. It tells the story of four adopted children seeking to avenge the murder of their foster mother. \nAlthough this movie is framed with the Thanksgiving holiday as a theme, it has violent action scenes, so be forewarned, it is not suitable for children. 3. Son in Law \n\"Son in Law\" is a 1993 fish-out-of-water comedy movie starring Pauly Shore and Carla Gugino. It's about a college girl returning home to her small town farm home just in time for Thanksgiving. The only problem? \nShe's accompanied by her obnoxious best friend who's pretending to be her fiancé, and he's not all that used to farm life. \nMore articles you will enjoy:",

      "text": "By Michael Storey This article was published today at 1:54 a.m. The final episode of Gilmore Girls saw Rory meet her idol, Christiane Amanpour. The episode, which aired May 15, 2007, starred (from left) Amanpour, Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel. a A Font Size \nWelcome back, Lorelai and Rory. Gilmore Girls returns to TV on Friday. \nAnd yes, fellow boomers, Netflix really, really counts as TV even though it's an online streaming service and not what we grew up with. Times have changed since the rabbit ears and rooftop antennas of our youth. \nRaise your hand if you ever wrapped strips of aluminum foil around the rabbit ears to help them work better. \nWhat some are calling Season 8 of Gilmore Girls launches on Netflix early Friday. All four 90-minute episodes of the revival, Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life , will be available at 2:01 a.m. I might wait until the sun comes up before diving in, but I guarantee you there will be plenty of fans making a night of it. \nInstead of Season 8, let's call the revival a miniseries. The last regular season episode wrapped the series on May 15, 2007, on The CW after six seasons on The WB. \nGilmore Girls (which generated a passionate following) brought us the adventures of single mother Lorelai Gilmore (Lauren Graham) and her overachieving daughter Rory (Alexis Bledel), along with her wealthy parents and all the colorful characters in the postcard-perfect Connecticut town of Stars Hollow. \nThat final episode, \"Bon Voyage,\" found Rory meeting her idol, CNN correspondent Christiane Amanpour, then accepting a position with an online magazine covering Barack Obama's bid for the Democratic presidential nomination. \nI guess that turned out OK. \nAll of Stars Hollow threw Rory a graduation/farewell party and the final scene shows the girls making one last early morning stop at Luke's Diner, making it a mirror image of the final scene in the pilot episode. \nFlash-forward nine years. What has happened in Stars Hollow that we can piece together from the trailers? \nRory is now unemployed and feeling down on herself. \"I have no job,\" she complains to her former boyfriend Jess Mariano (Milo Ventimiglia). \"I have no credit. I have no underwear.\" \nLorelai's father, Richard (Edward Herrmann), has died (as Herrmann did in real life) and her mother, Emily (Kelly Bishop), is at loose ends. \nLorelai and Luke (Scott Patterson) are still together and seemingly happy. Probably. Maybe. We'll see. \nLorelai's best friend, Sookie (Melissa McCarthy), is still the chef at the Dragonfly Inn. \nThat's not much to go on, but plenty to whet our appetites. \nThe four new episodes are titled \"Winter,\" \"Spring,\" \"Summer,\" and \"Fall\" and that's how we get \"A Year in the Life.\" \nThe first and last episodes were written by series creator Amy Sherman-Palladino, with the middle two being penned by her husband, Daniel Palladino. \nSeason 7 saw no involvement by the duo, which some fans and critics said was reflected in a sub-par final season. \nGraham and Bledel didn't rest on their laurels when the series folded. Both have been busy. \nThe 49-year-old Graham made her Broadway debut ( Guys and Dolls ) and had a six-season run as single mother Sarah Braverman on NBC's Parenthood . She also wrote a couple of novels. \nGraham and her Parenthood co-star Peter Krause have been an item since 2010. \nBledel, now 35, has been in a dozen movies and appeared in a handful of episodes on several TV shows since Gilmore Girls. \nShe was in three episodes of Mad Men and ended up marrying her co-star Vincent Kartheiser (he played Pete Campbell) in June 2014. The couple welcomed a son in the fall of 2015. \nTHANKSGIVING \nMeanwhile, there are parades and football games to get us through all the turkey and trimmings today. \n• The Parade. The Thanksgiving Day Parade kicks off at 8 a.m. today on CBS from New York and runs until 11. Co-anchors oooing and ahhing over the balloons and floats will be Entertainment Tonight's Kevin Frazier and The Insider's Keltie Knight. \nNote: This is actually the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, but CBS can't call it that because NBC has dibbies. \nIf you prefer the A-team Today show anchors on NBC, Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade airs from 9 a.m. to noon with Matt Lauer, Savannah Guthrie and Al Roker. \n• Football. Football? We got your football right here. You can settle back at 11:30 a.m. and not get up until almost 11 p.m. Take bathroom breaks at halftimes: \nMinnesota at Detroit, 11:30 a.m., CBS. \nWashington at Dallas, 3:30 p.m., Fox. \nPittsburgh at Indianapolis, 7:30 p.m., NBC. \nOn the college scene, LSU visits Texas A&M at 6:30 p.m. on ESPN. \n• Hogs. And don't forget, the Razorbacks travel to Missouri on Friday for the last regular season game. The contest will air at 1:30 p.m. on CBS. \nThe TV Column appears Sunday, Tuesday and Thursday.

      "text": "Is Netflix doing nostalgia better than anyone else right now?   \nBy Bethonie Butler, The Washington Post \nNostalgia has swept through television and film in recent years, but our collective throwback obsession has been particularly fruitful at Netflix.\nIn addition to channeling past decades with Baz Luhrmann's hip-hop saga \"The Get Down\" and the '80s-era phenomenon that is \"Stranger Things,\" the streaming network has revamped animated kids' favorites such as \"Popples\" and \"Voltron\" and released a film adaptation of the beloved novel \"The Little Prince.\" \"Beat Bugs,\" another animated series, combines kid-friendly stories with songs by the Beatles. Netflix will release \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,\" a four-episode revival of the popular WB-turned-CW show \"Gilmore Girls,\" on Friday.\nOf course, Netflix isn't the first to evoke bygone eras — Nickelodeon was a pioneer of nostalgia programming, resurfacing popular teen shows such as \"All That\" and \"Clarissa Explains It All\" in 2011. But that was before the days of \"peak TV\" and before streaming (as opposed to, say, Netflix's early DVD mailers) became ubiquitous. At Netflix, nostalgia's reign is less about fitting in with pop culture trends than it is about the streaming network's ambitious plans for original content.\n\"We're looking, always, for the great stories,\" said Netflix chief content officer Ted Sarandos. \"We're not setting out to find nostalgic projects, but sometimes in the hunt for great stuff, somebody has a great take on something that is hugely familiar.\"\nAs reported by Variety and others, the streaming network announced recently that it is raising $1 billion through a new debt offering to fund more original content. In September, Netflix reiterated its focus on original series and films. Netflix planned to release about 600 hours of original programming in 2016. Next year, the network expects to release more than 1,000 hours of original content.\n\"Stranger Things\" wasn't a traditional reboot, but it paid homage to pop culture mainstays of the late '70s and '80s, including Ridley Scott's \"Alien,\" Rob Reiner's 1986 film \"Stand By Me\" and '80s film fare from Steven Spielberg, including \"E.T.\" Similarly, \"The Get Down\" added to the nostalgia craze with an extravagant but well-researched take on the early days of hip-hop in the Bronx.\n\"Stranger Things\" was a surprise summer hit, though Sarandos said the network \"definitely knew we had something special\" after watching the early cuts of the episodes. According to research released by Netflix in September, most people who became big enough fans to watch all 10 episodes of the sci-fi thriller did so after finishing the second installment.\nSarandos said \"Stranger Things\" is popular on a global scale, although that's difficult to quantify because Netflix doesn't share ratings information. Sarandos said the company knows viewing numbers \"with incredible granularity,\" but it doesn't consider viewership the best measure of success because it doesn't sell advertising. Instead, the company focuses on subscriber growth, which is on an upswing.\nAnecdotally, Sarandos points to the the immense social media following that \"Stranger Things\" and the members of its largely unknown cast earned after the premiere in August as evidence of the show's dedicated fan base. \"There's no question when something is working in America or anywhere else in the world because everyone is talking about it,\" Sarandos said.\nWhen it comes to more traditional reboots, Netflix has arguably been more discerning than other networks about which shows are revived. \"Full House\" and \"Gilmore Girls\" both have multigenerational fan bases (the result of longtime syndication and treasured DVD box sets) that make the idea of continuing those stories appealing.\nAnd Netflix isn't just remaking these series the way that, say, CBS did with its short-lived \"Rush Hour\" reboot - \"Fuller House\" and the \"Gilmore Girls\" miniseries are essentially sequels. (Not that the broadcast networks haven't succeeded, at times, with the remake format - \"MacGyver\" has done well on Friday night for CBS, \"Lethal Weapon\" has held its own in the ratings despite mixed reviews, and \"The Exorcist,\" which isn't a ratings hit, is surprisingly worth watching if you're a fan of the horror genre.)\nSarandos credits the easy availability of old movies and shows with enabling younger audiences to find familiar references in \"Stranger Things\" and \"The Get Down.\" \"It's all in the rich details that you think would be completely lost on the young audience,\" he said, using the rotary phones in \"Stranger Things\" as an example.\n\"My 20-year-old son never said 'What's that?' because he's so used to seeing it (on) film and television,\" Sarandos said. \"It's almost like life and art just happen on a constant continuum now and are played out through television.\"",

      "text": "&&&&& To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video \nAfter nine years away from our screens, Gilmore Girls is back with four feature-length episodes on Netflix.\nStarring Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel the show followed the trials and tribulations of a mother and daughter in the small town of Stars Hollow, but Lauren and Alexis are refusing to call the conclusion to the revival an ending.\nSo could there be more episodes to come?\nSpeaking exclusively to Metro.co.uk, Lauren said: ‘It’s hard to say.\n‘I love it so much that I would just want to do what’s best for the show. I think what we’ve done was such a great piece, this mini-series to me was incredibly gratifying.’\nBut then she revealed that show creator Amy Sherman-Palladino always had ‘the Sherlock model in mind’ for the series: ‘Some years it’s three, some years it’s one, some year’s they go back in time. So perhaps we need to go back in time? I don’t know, it’s hard to say.’\n\nAlexis added: ‘To me the conclusion was definitely a surprise.\n‘But it’s the sort of conclusion only Amy could design so hopefully fans will love it because it will be authentic.’\n&&&&& To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video \nLauren also revealed that the feeling of ‘unfinished business’ made it easier to return to her iconic role as Lorelai Gilmore in the upcoming Netflix revival.\nSpeaking during the recent press tour, Lauren revealed: ‘[Gilmore Girls] was some of the best material I have ever had in my life and I missed it and I wanted it again.’\nLauren Graham and Alexis Bledel in Gilmore Girls (Picture: Netflix) Known for low stakes drama, in a world of TV where every show is about – as Lauren puts it – ‘vampire killer policemen fireman’, the return of Gilmore Girls is also a return to TV drama which focuses on the small connections between families and friends and neighbours.\nMore: TV Gilmore Girls' Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel admit 'surprise' for the show's final four words \nI'm A Celeb camp divided into royals and subjects after horrifying Vicious Circle trial \nRebecca Ferguson breaks down as she reveals she was sexually abused in a children's home \n‘It’s not a message show, it was never going to hit you over the head,’ says Lauren, who recently called the show ‘sneakily feminist’.\n‘I loved that it wasn’t a show about women taking on the world in an overt way.’\n\nGilmore Girls doesn’t fit into the current TV mould but as Lauren adds, ‘one of the reasons we are here is because it doesn’t fit, it didn’t fit back then’.\nShe added: ‘I watched the pilot and I was really struck by the fact that nothing happens for most of it, for a long time it’s just entertaining.’\nThe cheesiest smile for one of my favourite moments so far.

We’re catching up with the Gilmores’ nine years later and in that time a lot has changed.\nThe formidable Edward Hermann, who played the patriarch of the family Richard Gilmore, passed away in December 2014, and so within the show, his family are now having to deal with their loss – as well wife Emily and daugher Lorelai finally attempting to come to terms with their fractious relationships which have never improved over time.\nKelly Bishop is back as Emily (Picture: Netflix) Rory meanwhile is feeling lost as her career in journalism has yet to take off, and she finds herself listless, crashing on friend’s couches and travelling the world.\nHow many episodes are there?

      "text": "\nMaking A Murderer\nBig developments are coming in case behind Netflix’s true crime documentary Making A Murderer . Last week we learned that Steven Avery’s post-conviction lawyer Kathleen Zellner and the State of Wisconsin had come to an agreement on what pieces of evidence from Avery’s trial could and could not be tested. Now we get to learn what exactly is on that list. While the actual Agreed Testing Order documents still haven’t made their way onto the internet due to Thanksgiving weekend, John Ferak of Post-Crescent / USA Today got his hands on it and here’s the nine pieces of evidence to be re-examined.\nThere are seven items of blood evidence pulled from murder victim Teresa Halbach’s Toyota RAV4, namely blood flakes under the central console, a blood stain on the driver’s seat, and a blood stain on the passenger seat. The flakes themselves and cuttings of the bloodstains will all go for testing. Then there are swabs of blood pulled from the RAV4 ignition area, the rear passenger’s door, and a CD case found in the front passenger seat. Last but not least, a swab used on the RAV4 hood latch that tested positive for Avery’s DNA will also be tested.\n\nNetflix\nOutside of the vehicle, the controversial 1996 vial of Avery’s blood his trial lawyers claimed was used to plant his DNA in the RAV4 will also be subject to a battery of tests. Finally, the spare key and lanyard for the vehicle found by Manitowoc County Sheriff’s deputies James Lenk and Andrew Colborn in Avery’s home will also be re-examined.\nJudge just entered order for scientific testing to proceed. Steven Avery says \"it will be a Happy Thanksgiving after all.\" #MakingAMurderer \n— Kathleen Zellner (@ZellnerLaw) November 23, 2016 \n\nWhile Kathleen Zellner told USA Today “It’s encouraging that the Attorney General’s Office was so cooperative and helpful in expediting these tests,” it’s worth noting that the state refused to allow testing for many of the items included in her motion for scientific testing. That includes things in the RAV4 that were never tested at all like the hood prop bar, interior hood release latch, severed battery cable, a broken blinker light, and a lug wrench found inside the trunk. Zellner also wanted to try and pull DNA from fingerprints on the RAV4 using a new technique not available in 2007. \nOther pieces of evidence not being re-tested: the pelvic bone used to identify charred material on Avery’s property as Teresa Halbach’s remains, the RAV4 license plate and a pair of purple thong underwear recovered from the Avery salvage yard, and the bullet fragments found in Steven Avery’s garage. So it seems like his legal team was limited largely to blood samples and the three pieces of evidence most likely to have been tampered with – the hood latch, the RAV4 key, and the blood vial.\n\nNetflix\nZellner plans to subject all the evidence to a battery of new testing that didn’t exist when Avery was convicted in 2007. Radiocarbon 14c testing will determine the exact age of all blood evidence and can also detect the potential presence of EDTA. Body fluid source testing will determine what kind of DNA was recovered – for example, if Avery DNA pulled from the RAV4 hood latch is skin DNA from his hands, or saliva DNA from bucchal swabs taken by Manitowoc law enforcement.\nNow that the ruling is done with and testing can begin, things could begin to speed up in the case. It took just over three months from the court approving Zellner’s motion for scientific testing to this point where the testing can actually begin. And while Zellner said it could take months for that testing to be completed, the limited scope of items she’s allowed to test could mean a much faster turnaround with results. Based on past behavior from Zellner, we wouldn’t be surprised if she tweeted about any shocking discoveries rather than saving them for her official appeal.\nZellner isn’t going into this testing blindly, just hoping something turns up. She told ABC News that her investigation “points to one person. And that’s a person that I think was right there the whole time but never investigated. Because Mr. Avery was framed on this case right away.” This evidence testing is just the latest step towards her goal of exonerating Steven Avery. Considering Zellner has exonerated all 17 of her previous wrongful conviction clients, there’s good reason to expect some pretty big results from all this.\n(via Post-Crescent / USA Today) \n",

      "text": "What's coming and going on Netflix in December By Francis Navarro, Komando.com Denys Prykhodov / Shutterstock.com \nDecember is upon us and as usual with every new month, Netflix movies and TV shows will be arriving and leaving. \nThe good news is that there are not a whole lot of movies exiting Netflix in this season of giving. But better catch some of these gems before they're gone. Movies on the chopping block include the rom-com hit \"50 First Dates,\" 2000 Oscar Awards best picture \"American Beauty,\" the sci-fi thriller \"Event Horizon,\" and the 1980's classic \"Top Gun .\" \nAll six seasons of \" Hercules: The Legendary Journeys\" are also saying goodbye, so binge on this series while you can. \nThe big event of this month's content is the addition of the blockbuster superhero hit \"Captain America: Civil War,\" coming on Christmas Day. There's also a variety of Netflix originals coming our way - a new season of \"Fuller House,\" the Obama biopic \"Barry,\" and Mythbusters' spiritual descendant, \"White Rabbit Project.\" \nOther movie classics coming in December include \"Beverly Hills Cop,\" action epic \"The Rock\" and the comedy classic \" National Lampoon’s Animal House .\" \nHere's the full list of what's coming and going in December: Coming in December:",

      "text": "What are you thankful for?\nFamily? Country? Netflix?\nMight I suggest the humble brick? Or is brick beneath you?\nThere's a fair chance, as you read this, brick is holding you upright. Brick is thousands of years old; sun-dried mud bricks date to the Middle East, circa 7000 B.C. From there, brick spread east and west, the first international superstar of manufactured building materials. Chicago — rich in clay deposits used for brick making, having burned down in 1871 — was a ripe canvas, rebuilt as a brick metropolis. By the 1890s, the area boasted more than 60 brickyards, clustered near Blue Island; manufacturers pumped out 600 million bricks a year. Before the industry peaked in the 1920s, before steel and concrete competed for attention, Chicago had become an international hub for brick production.\nTrouble is, the brick did its job too well.\nDurable and ubiquitous is no way to stay appreciated.\n\"Architects see the brick as so fundamental we tend to forget the remarkable, you aggregate a bunch of bricks, you get a building,\" said Gunny Harboe, whose Chicago-based Harboe Architects focuses on preservation. \"But when you're matching brick on a building 50 years old, in need of preservation, and you're having trouble because they don't make that brick now, you understand — even the brick needs its connoisseurs.\"\nWhich is where the brick admirers of America step in.\nThey are fanboys of the prosaic, champions of the everyday. They want to know everything there is to know — origins and makers and whatnot — about brick. They are amateur historians; sometimes amateur archaeologists. They are often retired. Some collect thousands and thousands of bricks; and some trade bricks. Some wax poetic about the patterns laid in an old hospital; some hunt for rarities. These are real people.\nThey live among us.\nThey are, for one, Will Quam, Chicago theater teacher, St. Paul, Minn., native, brick lover. He stood on a (brick) sidewalk in Buena Park the other day and looked out at hues and patterns of (brick) facades on the buildings around him — sun-kissed bricks, bricks the color of blue cornmeal, bricks as green as moss, bricks staggered like stairs, bricks set in Mondrian grids, bricks still scarred with ghosts of old graffiti — and he looked happy.\n\"Some bricks,\" he said, \"at a distance you think you know what you're seeing. Up close, it's so different. You almost see brush strokes — there are Van Goghs all over Chicago!\"\nFive months ago, Quam, who works for Northlight Theatre and Evanston Children's Theatre among others, created an Instagram account named Brick of Chicago. It's become a clearinghouse for, at last count, almost 200 photos of brick facades and patterns around the Chicago area, most of them taken on his cellphone. He used to drive home from work the same way every day, and now, because of bricks, he takes a new route every day and stops frequently, increasing the odds he'll spot a beauty. And yet, like other admirers of brick, Quam is self-effacing about this hobby; he said even close friends think of it as random and odd. Walking through Buena Park, he found himself looking up at a particularly pretty precipice and let slip that he bought a selfie stick for pictures of hard-to-reach bricks. But he felt ridiculous and he left it at home.\nWe walked down Kenmore.\nA dog at the end of a leash noticed Quam noticing a brick wall and looked at the wall. The dog's owner also looked at the wall. Not seeing anything, they continued on past.\nQuam kept looking.\nHe held his phone in front of him and stood back a bit from the mid-century apartment building. He shot photos as he talked: \"So it started as a way to pay more attention to the world around me, and now I'm never bored — oh look, that's Flemish bond on those bricks! We take bricks for granted, yet this building doesn't need a strip of different color bricks there, and that mailbox didn't have to be set inside a brick alcove. I'm learning so much about bricks and brick bonding now, it's like I'm thinking in a second language.\"\nHe stopped, caught himself geeking out, and said: \"Funny how interesting the world is if you focus on a single thing.\" Then he looked across the street. \"Wow! What a brick!\"\nLouis Kahn was the original brick fanboy, the 20th century's brick whisperer. The man, whose work included the Salk Institute in California and Kimbell Art Museum in Texas, talked to bricks. And bricks talked back. As he famously said: \"If you think of brick, you say to brick, 'What do you want, brick?' And brick says to you, 'I like an arch.'\" The brick wants what it wants, he felt, making him the creative conscience of anyone with Legos.\nIt is a shame then: Louis Kahn died in 1974, nine years before the formation of his spiritual homestead, the International Brick Collectors Association. He would have liked these guys (and mostly, they are guys). The IBCA started in the Southwest in the early 1980s, evolving out of a barbed-wire collectors group. There are almost 2,000 registered members today (500 of whom are active). Three times a year, they publish a newsletter, full of collecting tips and brick-making lore. \"I don't go to their swap meets,\" said Allan Gilbert, professor of anthropology and founder of the 3,000-item New Netherland/New York Brick Archive at Fordham University . \"But I'm impressed with them. They're passionate, do lots of research. It may not be professional, but it's useful.\"\nGilbert started his archive as scholarly study, a way to learn more about where and how colonial America acquired building materials. The IBCA, like collectors of \"Star Wars\" and matchbooks alike, value rarity, pedigree. Beauty can be its own reward. Asked why he collects, Terry Taraba, the Louisiana-based IBCA president, mainly lists: \"Austin bricks are beautiful, Wisconsin bricks beautiful. There are bricks with camels on them, bricks with cellos. Lots of bricks from Chicago! Some members collect only a certain kind of brick. One only collects bricks used to pave roads in Ohio, and he has 1,000.\"\nAn hour south of Chicago, in the farm community of Gardner, IBCA secretary Jim Kraft walked to the field beside his home, to a pair of lean-tos he built against a white tool shed. His jeans were baggy, his cap faded. He's retired 14 years, a former high school art teacher. He headed for his collection, which lines the long insides of the lean-tos, from floor to ceiling. He's a newish collector, he says. He has only 4,000 bricks.\nHe built shelves so that each brick gets a cubbyhole, the stamp of the brick-maker's name or the origin of the brick facing outward: Ajax and Aetna and Altoona, Grape Creek and Falls Creek and Duck Creek. He has bricks from Bill Clinton's childhood home in Hope, Ark., and bricks from Vince Foster's childhood home (also in Hope); he has old bricks stamped with Abraham Lincoln silhouettes and new bricks branded with flocks of geese; he has novelty \"Merry Christmas\" bricks and \"Happy Hanukkah\" bricks.\n\"When you get started is always the most fun,\" he said. \"I started a decade ago, with everything still to find. So you drive up and down alleys, you visit where buildings are being torn down, where streets are being repaired. I don't do the river thing, though.\"\nThe river thing is for his friend, Frank Clement, who lives outside Buffalo, N.Y. Like a lot of brick collectors, Clement will get very dirty: \"You take a 14-foot boat, do a lot of map reading and research. You find places where old brickyards were or buildings knocked into the water. Then you climb in and root around. That's how I found a lot of bricks, all over, Missouri, Ohio.\" A former New York bridge welder with a love of archaeology, he started a brick museum in his garage. Open by appointment only, it has 8,500 bricks — tiles from the Roman Empire and bricks from the White House and bricks from a Kansas campaign to stem the spread of tuberculosis (\"Don't Spit on the Sidewalk\").\n\"I like to think we're documenting history,\" Clement said. \"But it's getting harder.\"\nMOST READ ENTERTAINMENT NEWS THIS HOUR\nTalk to brick collectors, you hear patterns: They want to slow the world down long enough to observe it closer, and the world is not willing. Young members are hard to find, and building sites grind up old bricks now. They complain about construction fencing, Homeland Security. (\"Don't think of going near a bridge these days,\" Clement said.) They hold swap meets three times a year. \"Set your bricks behind your vehicle, whistle blows, pick what you want, 15 minutes and done,\" Taraba said, but added: \"People used to just give bricks. But now you hear about people wanting to know what a brick's worth.\"\nKraft is an outlier of sorts: He came to brick collecting with a practical purpose, then stayed for the history. He wanted a footbridge over the small creek behind his home, but he wanted it assembled from a hodgepodge of bricks. So he gathered, and gathered. That was 11 years ago. Today, his lovely patchwork stands over the slow rushing gurgle of Gooseberry Creek, built out of 200 bricks, from Illinois and parts elsewhere.\nQuam is not a member of the IBCA.\nHe wasn't even aware of it. But he's the future they're looking for. He's in his 20s. His Instagram brick page has, at last count, 556 followers, strangers send him pictures of bricks, Chicago set designers send compliments, he reads constantly about brick. To walk through Lakeview with him is to hear: \"That's Scottish bond. A row of short (bricks), five rows of long, then a row of short. More than five rows of stretchers (long bricks), it's American bond. Three, it's English. I should show you a brick wall using Rat Trap bond!\"\nLike any connoisseur, he's discerning; pointing to the large sand-colored brick on a hospital, he says: \"Huge bricks, soulless, not interesting. But cheap, right?\" He's ambitious. He opens the gates of apartment complexes and walks up to the sides of homes and takes pictures.\nAnd he doesn't see an end to his fascination with brick, only a world to discover. Approaching a storefront on Irving Park, he says: \"Oh, very Chicago World's Fair -y brick! Not that I know. I mean, my education, it's cobbled together. Like so many bricks.\"\ncborrelli@chicagotribune.com\nRELATED STORIES:\nIf art can't fix problems, what good is it?\n New Iron Man blasts through stereotypes\nCheck out the latest movie reviews from Michael Phillips and the Chicago Tribune.\nCheck out reviews for all new music releases from Tribune music critic Greg Kot.\n Art Architecture Fordham University World Columbian Exposition (1893)",

      "text": "× ‘Netflix and Chill’? It could be lowering your sperm count \nYou’ve heard of “Netflix and Chill?” It turns out it could be just the opposite. \nA new study out of Denmark suggests all that binge-watching could be lowering your sperm count. \nAccording to FoxNews.com, men who logged 5 or more hours of TV per day had 29 percent lower sperm concentration and 34 percent lower sperm counts than men who didn’t watch any TV. \nSo is this the same for all sedentary activity? Apparently not. \nMen who played on the computer for the same amount of time didn’t experience a drop in those semen parameters. \nResearchers said they can’t yet pinpoint what it is about TV that is so harmful to sperm. \nStudy coauthor Lærke Priskorn, Ph.D.(c) of the University of Copenhagen said it’s possible all the stillness increases the temperature in the scrotum, which can mess with sperm production. \nShe said the lack of exercise could also be to blame. \nOr it could just be the men who watch a ton of TV are also more likely to be overweight or drink excessively, both of which hurt your sperm, Priskorn notes.

      "text": "Arrival stars Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life is available on Netflix Charlize Theron is part of the voice cast on Kubo and the Two Strings \nOver the past weekend, Disney announced that Game of Thrones’ Emilia Clarke – she plays dragon-queen Daenerys Targaryen, if you’re unaware – had been cast in the as-yet untitled Han Solo Star Wars standalone spin-off film. She joins Alden Ehrenreich and Donald Glover — who will be portraying Han Solo and Lando Calrissian, respectively – in the film set before the original Star Wars trilogy, just like the upcoming Rogue One. The untitled Han Solo film, directed by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, is set to release May 25, 2018. \nThere was another Disney announcement at the start of the week too, in the form of a teaser for Pixar’s Cars 3 . It seems to be taking a much grittier tone compared to the earlier movies, with desaturated tones and no joyous/ funny moments present. We will find out how good an idea that is on June 16, 2017. Over on the third Disney front, Marvel said that Angela Bassett (American Horror Story) had been cast as the mother of Chadwick Boseman’s Black Panther – first seen in Captain America: Civil War – for his character’s solo film. The film, simply titled Black Panther, is scheduled for February 16, 2018.\nAfter the release of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them last week, author and screenwriter JK Rowling took to Twitter to reveal some details about the next four films in the same franchise. She said that the films will cover a 19-year timeline, starting in 1926 and ending in 1945. She also confirmed that Alison Sudol’s Queenie Goldstein would be part of the second film. \nThe upcoming Tomb Raider film reboot, pegged for a March 16, 2018 release, will explore Lara Croft’s (Alicia Vikander, of Ex Machina) roots as she searches for her lost father, producer Graham King revealed in an interview . He has said in the past that the film will be more character-driven, unlike the action-heavy movies starring Angelina Jolie. \nPassengers, a sci-fi film with Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt, now has a release date in India. It will arrive in cinemas on January 6, 2017 – a couple of weeks after its December 21 international launch. If you’re wondering what the film is about, here’s a trailer . \nFilm studio Fox provided a few release dates for some of its upcoming films, and may have given a clue about Avatar 2. Fox has set the date of December 21, 2018 for a film from James Cameron’s Lightstorm Entertainment, which we believe might just be the rather delayed sequel to 2009's $2-billion-plus hit, Avatar. \nThat’s all to come, though. Welcome back to The Weekend Chill , and here are the best picks for your upcoming weekend: \nTV: Search Party Starring Alia Shawkat of Arrested Development fame in the lead, Search Party is about five self-absorbed twenty-somethings who are pulled into finding a former college acquaintance named Chantal after her disappearance. Dory (Shawkat) is obsessed with knowing what happened to someone she barely knew and cared about in college, and she forces her four reluctant friends - her sheltered and spoon-fed doofus boyfriend Drew Gardner (John Reynolds), her self-diagnosed narcissist gay friend Elliott Goss (John Early), her bubbly actress friend who craves the spotlight Portia Davenport (Meredith Hagner), and her journalist ex-boyfriend Julian (Brandon Micheal Hall) - into helping. \nThe show, created by Sarah-Violet Bliss, Charles Rogers, and Michael Showalter, has been described as a dark comedy, with a sprinkle of mystery and suspense thrown in – what with the missing person’s case. The first season of 10 episodes is available in its entirety on network TBS’ website, and the channel started airing episodes on TV at the start of this week – two per day to complete the full season by Friday. If you’re still on the fence about it, here’s a preview: \nHow to access: TBS Time commitment: 5 hours \nGilmore Girls: A Year in the Life During its seven-year run that started in 2000, Gilmore Girls’ fame came not only from the idiosyncrasies of its characters but also the heavy referencing of other pop culture phenomena peppered throughout. That was down to the consistent presence of creator-showrunner Amy Sherman-Palladino, and her husband Daniel behind the camera, who were together responsible for a lot of the writing. That changed towards the show’s end as the two quit in 2006 after failing to negotiate a new deal. \nAnd the show didn’t last for long after they left, ending abruptly in 2007 itself. Now with showrunner Amy Sherman-Palladino back in the hot seat for the mini-series revival powered by Netflix, fans were hoping the four 90-minute episodes – which span four seasons – would deliver some closure after that abrupt departure. \nAccording to early reviews, the new season does deliver on that front. Rory (Alexis Bledel) and Lorelai (Lauren Graham) Gilmore are back in Star Hollow, and so is the witty repartee. \nHow to access: Netflix \nMovies: Arrival Canadian director Denis Villeneuve has made a name for himself internationally in recent years, first with crime-thriller Prisoners in 2013 – starring Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal, and Viola Davis – and then another crime-thriller, Sicario, in 2015 – starring Emily Blunt, Benicio Del Toro, and Josh Brolin. So naturally, there were a lot of expectations when his next venture, a sci-fi drama called Arrival, was announced with Amy Adams, Jeremy Renner, and Forest Whitaker. \nThe film is based on Ted Chiang’s short story “Story of Your Life”, but the final script that made into production is a drastically different tale. The basic premise goes like this: alien spacecrafts have arrived on planet Earth, and the aliens are emitting sounds no one understands. Enter Adams’ Dr Louise Banks, a professor of comparative linguistics, who is called in to help translate. \nArrival had its premiere back in September at the Venice Film Festival, and has garnered much praise after its wider release for its story, atmosphere, and Adams’ performance. If you love thinking person’s sci-fi, Arrival is right up your alley. \nHow to access: Out in cinema hallsTime commitment: 1 hour and 56 minutes \nKubo and the Two Strings Travis Knight's directorial debut, stop-motion animated fantasy Kubo and the Two Strings is about a boy named Kubo, with magical powers, and without his left-eye. Using his shamisen, the Japanese musical instrument with three strings, Kubo can not only magically make origami with his tunes but also have them move as he likes. He lives alone at the top of a mountain with his mother Sariatu, who escaped with a young Kubo years ago after his father – a samurai warrior named Hanzo – went missing. \nProduced by Laika, and involving the voices of Art Parkinson, Charlize Theron, Matthew McConaughey, Ralph Fiennes, Rooney Mara, and George Takei, Kubo and the Two Strings is a moving story – dark yet delivered with love – and is an excellent portrayal of how to deal with grief. Easily one of the best animated films of 2016, the film’s release on home media is your best chance to catch it since it never released in India. \nTime commitment: 1 hour and 42 minutes \nLo and Behold, Reveries of the Connected World German film-maker Werner Herzog has a knack for documentaries; he’s been making them since 1969. The topic for his second latest – he has released two docs just this year – is the Internet, and its impact on our civilisation. More specifically though – Lo and Behold, Reveries of the Connected World is a look at our relationship with machines – be it robotics, AI, the Internet of Things, and more – and how the inter-connected and dependent nature of it is changing and affecting us on a day-to-day basis. \nFor the film, Herzog spoke with not only the pioneers of the technology world – Bob Kahn, Elon Musk, and Sebastian Thrun – but also with regular people who will bring in the next big thing or have been deeply affected by the Internet – including a computer scientist at Carnegie Mellon teaching robots to play soccer, or a group of people who claim to have electromagnetic hypersensitivity and live in a cellular-free environment in the Appalachian Mountains. \nLo and Behold focuses on a timely topic when our society would be lost without the Internet, which makes it required viewing, even during its least engaging moments. \nTime commitment: 1 hour and 38 minutes \nOther mentions: Hell or High Water may have flown under the radar upon release – it never made it to India, if you’re wondering – but it was a solid film, starring Chris Pine and Ben Foster, penned by Sicario writer Taylor Sheridan, and directed by David Mackenzie, who was also behind the gritty prison drama Starred Up in 2014. It’s now available on home media, and a whole bunch of streaming services. \nOn the television front, the third season of The Affair – a show we recommended back in August as well – began airing earlier this week in the US on Showtime, and on Star World Premiere in India every Thursday at 10pm. \nVideo games: Unfortunately, there were no good releases this week. But with Black Friday mania in the US, all of the online stores – PlayStation , Microsoft , Steam , and Origin – are hosting big sales on hundreds of games. Here are some deals on games that we’ve recommended previously in this column: PlayStation 4 Watch Dogs 2 Deluxe Edition – 31 per cent off, now at Rs. 2,750 Battlefield 1 + Titanfall 2, Deluxe Bundle – 38 per cent off, now at Rs. 4,162 Dirt Rally – 50 per cent off, now at Rs. 1,999 \nMicrosoft Store Forza Horizon 3 – 35 per cent off, now at Rs. 2,599 Deus Ex: Mankind Divided – 40 per cent off, now at Rs. 2,394 Batman – The Telltale Series – Episode 1: Realm of Shadows – 85 per cent off, now at Rs. 57 ; free if you’re on PC, or have Xbox Live Gold \nSteam Doom – 67 per cent off, now at Rs. 989 Rise of the Tomb Raider: 20 Year Celebration – 50 per cent off, now at Rs. 499 Lego Star Wars: The Force Awakens – 40 per cent off, now at Rs. 1,139 Tom Clancy’s The Division – 50 per cent off, now at Rs. 739 \nOrigin FIFA 17 – 40 per cent off, now at Rs. 2,099 Mirror’s Edge Catalyst – 47 per cent off, now at Rs. 1,065 \nHappy gaming, folks.

      "text": "Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends \nWith the holiday season in full swing, Netflix returns with a healthy new batch of original films, comedy specials, and TV shows this December. \nRelated: How much does Netflix cost these days? Here’s the lowdown \nThe company once again follows up on its pledge to become 50 percent original content with a huge number of new options for streaming viewers as the year nears its end. \nThe most-anticipated house-brewed film this month is Barry , a drama about President Barack Obama’s life while he attended Columbia University in the early 1980s. Relative newcomer Devon Terrell plays Obama in the film, which has recieved fairly high praise industrywide. The streaming giant also recently purchased the rights to Spectral , an action sci-fi film about a scientist looking to learn more about phantom agressors in a war-torn city. Emily Mortimer, Bruce Greenwood, and James Badge Dale star in the film, which was produced by Legendary Pictures. \nIn TV land, the streaming giant will release the second seasons of its revamped sitcom Fuller House and popular Spanish-language soccer drama Club de Cuervos, along with the debut seasons of Archer -style animated spy comedy Pacific Heat and White Rabbit Project , a new unscripted series from the supporting cast of Mythbusters . \nComedy specials also abound this month, with new releases from Reggie Watts, Racardo O’Farril, and Gabriel Inglesias to keep you chuckling into the new year. \nThose looking outside the house-made fare will be happy to see classic comedies like Animal House and cult films like Lucky Number Slevin making their way to the streaming service in December. \nAs always, some great movies will be heading into the ether by the year’s end, so be sure to catch American Beauty, Don’t Be A Menace , and Top Gun before they hit the pavement. \nBelow is the full list of fresh content you can see this December, and what will be leaving Netflix for the time being: New on Netflix in December December 1",

      "text": "Oy with the signs already! Gilmore Girls fans may be anxiously awaiting the Netflix revival of the beloved mother-daughter series, but the cast has been trying to make the reboot work for years. Star Lauren Graham visited The Ellen DeGeneres Show , airing Tuesday, to talk about the experience and one particularly telling sign she got in the costume department.\nWATCH: EXCLUSIVE: 'Gilmore Girls' Cast Reunites at Netflix Revival Premiere Party, Lauren Graham Gushes 'I'm So Thankful We Made It'\n\"On the very first day I was so nervous and I couldn't decide what to wear because it was the scene where you first see my character,\" Graham explained. \"I kept changing, changing, changing. Finally I had to go so I picked something off the rack, and my dresser pinned it because it was a little big.\"\nThe pin poked her in the back several times that day, so her dresser cut the tag off her shirt. When the first day of filming was over, the shocked costume designer visited Graham's dressing room to show her the tag.\n\"The tag from the shirt I picked on the first day playing this character for the second time and the tag says, 'Lorelai 2,'\" Graham said as DeGeneres' audience gasped. \"The shirt was called the Lorelai 2. It became such a symbol for me of all the special, magical, incredible things that had to come together and there were a bunch of those.\"\nWith that incredible symbol driving them forward, the original stars of the show filmed A Year in the Life – four extended episodes of the show split by seasons of the year.\n\"I snapped back into it like no time had passed,\" Graham said. \"I have never had an experience like it. It was one of the happiest times of my life.\"\nAt the recent premiere for the revival, Graham spoke with ET's Leanne Aguilera about working on the secret project.\nWATCH: EXCLUSIVE: Lauren Graham Spills on Mae Whitman's 'Wonderful' (but Brief!) Role in 'Gilmore Girls' Revival\n\"I'm just so thankful! I'm so thankful we made it,\" Graham said . \"And it's been such a big part of my life. I just got the feeling today, like, 'Oh, we can start to enjoy it now and share it with fans and not have to say no comment after we're asked any question.' So, it just feels really good.\"\nGilmore Girls: A Year in the Life premieres Friday on Netflix.

      "text": "Close Netflix / provided \nFour old favorites are back, clockwise from top left: ‘Stranger Things,’ the Beatles-singing ‘Beat Bugs,’ Rory and Lorelei Gilmore in ‘Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life’ and a ‘Voltron: Legendary Defender.’ spotlight Is Netflix doing nostalgia better than anyone else right now? Bethonie Butler The Washington Post 17 hrs ago ( … ) Netflix / provided \nFour old favorites are back, clockwise from top left: ‘Stranger Things,’ the Beatles-singing ‘Beat Bugs,’ Rory and Lorelei Gilmore in ‘Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life’ and a ‘Voltron: Legendary Defender.’ \nNostalgia has swept through television and film in recent years, but our collective throwback obsession has been particularly fruitful at Netflix. \nIn addition to channeling past decades with Baz Luhrmann’s hip-hop saga “The Get Down” and the ’80s-era phenomenon “Stranger Things,” the streaming network has revamped animated kids’ favorites including “Popples” and “Voltron” and released a film adaptation of the novel “The Little Prince.” \n“Beat Bugs,” another animated series, combines kid-friendly stories with songs by the Beatles. \nNetflix started “Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,” a four-episode revival of the WB-turned-CW show “Gilmore Girls,” Friday. \nNetflix isn’t the first to evoke bygone eras. Nickelodeon was a pioneer of nostalgia programming, resurfacing popular teen shows, such as “All That” and “Clarissa Explains It All” in 2011. But that was before the days of “peak TV” and before streaming (as opposed to, say, Netflix’s early DVD mailers) became ubiquitous. At Netflix, nostalgia’s reign is less about fitting in with pop culture trends than it is about the streaming network’s ambitious plans for original content. \n“We’re looking, always, for the great stories,” Netflix Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos said. “We’re not setting out to find nostalgic projects, but sometimes in the hunt for great stuff, somebody has a great take on something that is hugely familiar.” \nVariety reported the streaming network announced it is raising $1 billion through a new debt offering to fund more original content. \nIn September, Netflix reiterated its focus on original series and films. Netflix planned to release about 600 hours of original programming in 2016. Next year, the network expects to release more than 1,000 hours of original content. \n“Stranger Things” was not a traditional reboot, but it paid homage to pop culture mainstays of the late ’70s and ’80s, including Ridley Scott’s “Alien,” Rob Reiner’s 1986 film “Stand By Me” and ’80s film fare from Steven Spielberg, including “E.T.” Similarly, “The Get Down” added to the nostalgia craze with an extravagant but well-researched take on early hip-hop in the Bronx. \n“Stranger Things” was a surprise summer hit, though Sarandos said the network “definitely knew we had something special” after watching the early cuts. According to research released by Netflix in September, most people who became big enough fans to watch all 10 episodes of the sci-fi thriller did so after finishing the second installment. \nSarandos said “Stranger Things” is popular on a global scale, although that’s difficult to quantify because Netflix doesn’t share ratings information. Sarandos said the company knows viewing numbers “with incredible granularity,” but it doesn’t consider viewership the best measure of success because it doesn’t sell advertising. Instead, the company focuses on subscriber growth, which is on an upswing. \nAnecdotally, Sarandos points to the the immense social media following that “Stranger Things” and the members of its largely unknown cast earned after the premiere in August as evidence of the show’s dedicated fan base. “There’s no question when something is working in America or anywhere else in the world because everyone is talking about it,” Sarandos said. \nWhen it comes to more traditional reboots, Netflix has arguably been more discerning than other networks about which shows are revived. \n“Full House” and “Gilmore Girls” have multigenerational fan bases (helped by syndication and treasured DVD box sets) that continuing those stories appealing. \nAnd Netflix isn’t just remaking these series the way that, say, CBS did with its short-lived “Rush Hour” reboot. “Fuller House” and the “Gilmore Girls” miniseries are essentially sequels. (Not that the broadcast networks haven’t succeeded, at times, with the remake format — “MacGyver” has done well on Friday night for CBS, “Lethal Weapon” has held its own in the ratings despite mixed reviews, and “The Exorcist,” which isn’t a ratings hit, is surprisingly worth watching.) \nSarandos credits the easy availability of old movies and shows with helping young audiences find familiar references in “Stranger Things” and “The Get Down.” \n“It’s all in the rich details that you think would be completely lost on the young audience,” he said, using the rotary phones in “Stranger Things” as an example. \n“My 20-year-old son never said ‘What’s that?’ because he’s so used to seeing it (on) film and television,” Sarandos said. “It’s almost like life and art just happen on a constant continuum now and are played out through television.” Tags ",

      "text": "Let’s start with the good news: The Netflix revival of “Gilmore Girls” has everything fans want.\nLorelai and Rory return as the mother-daughter best-friend duo who live in the gloriously quirky town of Stars Hollow, Connecticut.\nThe original creator and executive producers are in charge, ensuring that the highly anticipated reboot is chock-full of callbacks, inside jokes and life updates on favorite supporting characters.\nThe bad news: It’s not perfect — not at all. The revival has four 90-minute chapters; and, it turns out, 42-minute episodes were the perfect amount of time before the famously sparkling dialogue and wacky plotlines start to drag — and characters’ flaws go from endearing to irritating.\nThe best news: Fans won’t care — because “Gilmore Girls” is back.\nAlthough television is cluttered with nostalgia projects, nothing quite strikes a chord like “ Gilmore Girls,” which ran on the WB and, later, the CW from 2000 to 2007.\nExecutive producers Amy Sherman-Palladino and Dan Palladino couldn’t reach a financial deal with the studio and left before the seventh and final season — a huge disappointment for fans because the final season was bogged down by nonsensical storylines.\nIt all adds an extra layer of excitement to the revival, because viewers finally get to see the “ real” ending.\nBefore viewing the episodes, Netflix required reporters to sign agreements in which we swore not to reveal any spoilers or surprises or specific plot points or twists or turns or — any significant details whatsoever, especially about various romantic entanglements.\nBut here’s what I can tell you: The first episode is delightfully surreal. As in: Is this really happening? Are Lorelai (Lauren Graham) and Rory (Alexis Bledel) bantering about coffee and trading pop-culture references as if no time has passed? The Stars Hollow Gazette gets a shout-out? Wait, town weirdo Kirk (Sean Gunn) has a pet pig? (Actually, that seems about right.)\nViewers get swept back into the all-consuming “Gilmore” world.\nThe theme of the revival is arriving at a crossroads (yes, Lorelai would make a Britney Spears joke here) and what to do when there are no easy answers. When we last saw Rory — the straight-A student with dreams of being a foreign correspondent — she had just graduated from Yale University with a job for a political website covering then-Sen. Barack Obama’s presidential campaign.\nNow 32, Rory is struggling to find a permanent foothold in the fiercely competitive journalism world. On a trip home to Stars Hollow, she repeatedly assures her mother that she has a lot of irons in the fire (“I heard. You should become a blacksmith,” Lorelai deadpans), although she’s clearly terrified about her daughter’s future.\nLorelai, meanwhile, is dealing with a midlife crisis of sorts, spending a fair amount of time in a (mostly bewildered) therapist’s office. She’s not just dealing with her complicated family issues: getting pregnant at 16 and running away from her wealthy, stifling parents. She’s also thinking about the future of the Dragonfly Inn, her dream business that she opened with best friend Sookie (Melissa McCarthy). Plus, she and grumpy diner owner Luke (Scott Patterson), the fan-favorite choice for her soulmate, aren’t all smooth sailing — even though the trailer features them sharing a kiss.\nThreaded through the stories is the grief over the death of Edward Herrmann, who played Richard, Lorelai’s father; Herrmann died of cancer two years ago. In the revival, his widow, Emily (Kelly Bishop), grapples with life without her husband of 50 years.\nSherman-Palladino was upset when Netflix refused to release the episodes one week at a time — instead planning to drop them all at once, which is customary.\nIndeed, some advice: Ninety-minute “Gilmore Girls” episodes are not for binge-watching, at least not all in one sitting.\nNot only do some of the characters become insufferable, but some expanded scenes are ones that don’t necessarily need expanding.\nThen again, maybe you love Stars Hollow musicals. Maybe you can’t get enough of Taylor Doose (Michael Winters) running the town meetings; or Paris Geller’s (Liza Weil) insults; or Lane’s (Keiko Agena) band, Hep Alien; or references to Tori Spelling and Neil Patrick Harris.\nThat’s the one benefit of a “Gilmore Girls” mini-movie: With extended time and the producers’ creative freedom, it becomes a veritable buffet of every “Gilmore” experience imaginable.\nAnd, for this show in particular, that’s all that fans really care about, anyway.",

      "text": "  Steven Avery case has fascinated the world ever since Making A Murderer premiered on Netflix last Christmas, and people have continued to vaguely follow the progress that his new lawyer Kathleen Zellner has been making in it all year without any real breakthroughs to report. Featured Image VIA \nDespite this though, I’m sure that everyone probably realises that there’s been a lot of behind the scenes work going on on behalf of Steven Avery over the past few months. Finally now it seems like we’re actually getting somewhere as Zellner’s just announced that nine pieces of evidence are going to be re-examined as part of the appeals process. \nYou’ve probably forgotten the details of the case, but here are the critical nine pieces of evidence that Zellner has managed to get retested: \nBlood flakes under the central console of the RAV4 (Thersea Halbach’s car). \nA blood stain on the driver’s seat of the RAV4. \nA blood stain on the passenger seat of the RAV4. \nSwabs of blood pulled from the RAV4 ignition area, the rear passenger’s door, and a CD case found in the front passenger seat. \nA swab used on the RAV4 hood latch that tested positive for Avery’s DNA. \nThe 1996 vial of Avery’s blood his trial lawyers claimed was used to plant his DNA in the RAV4. \nThe spare key and lanyard for the vehicle found by Manitowoc County Sheriff’s deputies James Lenk and Andrew Colborn in Avery’s home. \nFair play – it looks like Zellner has stepped up to the plate big time and managed to get a lot of the evidence that actually led to Avery’s conviction in the first place re-examined. However, it’s also worth noting that there were a lot of other items that Zellner tried to retest that were denied, and these included: \nThe hood prop bar, interior hood release latch, severed battery cable, a broken blinker light, and a lug wrench found inside the RAV4. \nThe pelvic bone used to identify charred material on Avery’s property as Teresa Halbach’s remains, \nThe RAV4 license plate. \nA pair of purple thong underwear recovered from the Avery salvage yard. \nThe bullet fragments found in Steven Avery’s garage. \nSo it turns out there’s actually a lot of stuff that could help in the case that’s not being reexamined and the original list might not look as good in hindsight. However, it’s important to remember that all those blood samples that are being retested are the pieces of evidence that are most likely to have been tampered with by the cops if they did indeed frame Avery, so the fact that they’re going to be retested is definitely a win for Avery and Zellner. \nUnfortunately, it’s probably going to take months for them to be reexamined thoroughly, so it’s going to be a while until we hear anything back about them, but at least we now know that progress is being made in the case. The legal world is a slow and particular place though and these things take time – I’m sure Steven Avery won’t mind an extra few months in jail if he gets released at the end of them though. I mean he’s been in there without a hope at all for long enough, right? \nFor all the other updates in the Making A Murderer case since the show came out, click here . It’s been a wild ride.",

(Emily Yahr) \n\"So good to be home,\" Rory says. It is, isn't it? \nAfter the town tour, Lorelai and Rory head home, where Luke is making the girls dinner. Luke's wardrobe also hasn't changed in the last decade. And the love that Lorelai and Luke share hasn't either, as Luke has moved in, and all is right with the world. \nLuke is incredibly proud of Rory for getting a piece published in the New Yorker. So much so that he has the piece reprinted in its entirety on the back of his new menus. He scolds the girls for eating tacos before dinner is served, to which Lorelai has the perfect response: \"Wow, so I'm fat? Body shaming. Trigger warnings. War on Christmas!\" \nWe get a bit more of Rory's backstory, as we learn that she has been living in Brooklyn until very recently. But she is without much of a regular gig, doing freelance journalism. She has a prospective new project in London, but she really feels like this is her time to be rootless. Rootless would imply no romantic ties, and Rory doesn't have anything serious going on in that realm. \nOh, except for Paul! But everyone keeps forgetting that Paul exists, in a great running gag throughout the episode. Paul is Rory's boyfriend of two years who has shown up in Stars Hollow, but everyone finds him utterly forgettable. I really enjoyed this gag, as well as the jab at Marvel movies in Lorelai's dialogue. \nAfter dinner, Luke and Lorelai get ready for bed. Luke attempts to clear the DVR, while Lorelai tries to put off sleep by \"...organizing my magazines by Kardashian.\" After finally getting to sleep, Lorelai is awakened by a bad dream and heads to the kitchen to find Rory stress-tap dancing. Mother and daughter continue to catch up over coffee. Rory talks about her career struggles, while Lorelai admits that she's been feeling stressed and very aware of her mortality. Rory theorizes that Lorelai's existential thoughts are related to the family patriarch's recent passing. They raise their mugs to toast Richard: \"To absent friends.\" \nThe next day begins with the girls heading to Luke's Diner for a to-go breakfast. After, Lorelai heads to work at the Dragonfly, and we catch up with Michel. Michel shares that his husband has recently changed his anti-children stance, while trying to sell Lorelai on Sookie's replacement. We learn that Sookie hasn't left the inn officially, but that she has taken a sabbatical that is extending longer than she had promised, much to Michel's annoyance. \n\"Why on earth aren't you on Xanax? It was invented for you,\" Michel deadpans to Lorelai. \nThat night, Lorelai employs Kirk's new business, while Gypsy fixes her Jeep. They arrive to Friday night dinner at Emily's just a bit before Rory. Lorelai won't go inside until Rory shows up, so we know that the Emily/Lorelai relationship is still as frosty as ever. \nWe learn that Emily is especially angry with her daughter for a faux pas at the reception following Richard's funeral. Lorelai drank too much, and when Emily asked her to tell a favorite Richard story, she told stories about his abandoning her during a hide-and-seek game, and of him walking in on her with a boy. \nEmily was embarrassed and grieving and didn't need an excuse to be upset with her daughter, but she used it as one anyway. Emily accuses Lorelai of making a premeditated decision to besmirch her late father at his funeral reception. \n\"You never do anything unless it's exactly what you want to do,\" Emily says. \nEmily continues, starting in on Luke and Lorelai's relationship, and how selfish Lorelai was for only considering whether or not she wanted children, and for never thinking of Luke's wants and needs. \n\"None of that matters to Lorelai Gilmore. Nothing matters to her except what she wants and feels,\" she says. \nLorelai takes that bit of her mother's criticism to heart, and asks Luke whether or not he wants \"a fresh kid,\" later that night. Luke admits that there was a time a few years earlier when he would have wanted to have another child. \n\"Nobody gets to have everything they want in life. All in all, I think I did pretty good,\" Luke says. \nLorelai isn't convinced that he's OK with not having a child of their own together and takes Luke to visit Paris at the surrogacy clinic she operates. Luke is too overwhelmed by the whole process and dismisses the possibility of a new baby with a simple \"No.\" \nWhile Lorelai and Luke visit Paris, Rory is in London, visiting with renowned feminist Naomi Shropshire. Naomi wants to work with Rory on her autobiography, and with no roots to tie her down, Rory is intrigued. \n\"It's not really what I do, but it's good for now,\" she tells Logan later. \nWhen in London, Rory and Logan hook up, we learn. \nHey, I get the Logan thing. I do. He's very charming. But he's not right for Rory. And by the way, I find the whole Team Logan/Jess/Dean thing pretty trite. As a character, Rory is so much more than which guy she chooses to spend her alone time with, and it drives me crazy that every actor on the show had to answer questions about Logan, Jess and Dean in doing media to promote the show. I digress. \nBack in Stars Hollow, Taylor is intent on getting Luke's support for his new town septic tank initiative, Paris visits to try to sell Luke on a surrogate, we catch up with Hep Alien, and Rory calls Lorelai to encourage her to work on patching things up with Emily. \n\"Did you ever imagine there'd be a Grandma without a Grandpa?\" Rory asks, and tells Lorelai to cut her some slack as she grieves. \nWith that in mind, Lorelai visits Emily, who is de-cluttering her life, and wearing (gasp) blue jeans. In her grief and loneliness and not thinking clearly, Emily has allowed her maid to move her family in and to start taking away the possessions that don't bring her joy. She also informs Lorelai that there's an envelope labeled \"body-shipping cash\" in her safe. \nLorleai tells her that nothing will bring her joy right now because her husband has just died. Emily admits that she's right. \n\"I was married for 50 years. Half of me is gone,\" she says. \nLorelai suggests a visit to a therapist, to which Emily surprisingly agrees. Even more surprisingly, Emily enjoys the therapy and asks Lorelai to join her for a session. Stunned and perhaps in shock, Lorelai agrees. \n\"Are you crazy? You're going to therapy with your mother,\" Luke reminds her. \n\"Oh, crap. I'm going to therapy with my mother!\" Lorelai says, coming to her senses. \nThis should certainly make for some wonderful storytelling as we continue traveling through the seasons in a year in the life of the Gilmore Girls.",

      "text": "Who is the King of Streaming Content? Netflix or Amazon? November 22, 2016, 03:49:00 PM EDT By David Bartosiak, Zacks.com Shutterstock photo \nHey everybody Dave Bartosiak with Trending Stocks at Zacks.com. Make no mistake about it, content is King. It's how HBO became a powerhouse. It's what transformed Netflix NFLX into a household name. And it's what makes me and the guys back worth our weight in gold. #BeardGameStrong. \nThe mad land grab for talent used to be restricted to the cable networks just like ugly guys with nice voices were trapped in radio before Sirius XM SIRI made Howard Stern into a bazillionaire. Now every streaming service in the world is bidding for content. \nMy favorite car show ever, Top Gear, was cancelled after the host punched a producer. But Amazon AMZN rushed in to offer the team a contract to put their show on Amazon Prime. The Grand Tour debuted last week and frankly, it was awesome. \nNow Netflix announced the funniest man of my generation is coming back to do three specials. Dave Chappelle just landed a deal worth $60 million. That's $10 million more than Comedy Central offered him for season 3 of the Chappelle Show. Netflix already has a huge deal in place with Disney DIS it struck back in 2012 and has been producing great original content like \"Narcos\" and \"House of Cards\" for years. If you're looking to learn a little financial literacy and laugh at the stock market, hey, Netflix, #WhatAboutDave. The bidding starts at $10 million. Cash. \nHow can you profit from the growth of streaming TV? You could check out the companies that are bundling streaming services together like Dish Network's DISH Sling TV. But frankly, I don't feel like there is any barrier to entry there other than your ability to negotiate a contract. So maybe the best way to play this is to load up on Netflix and hope they reach international audiences before Amazon does. Amazon is at a better price point at $90 a year and includes a subscription to Prime. \nAs for our take, Netflix is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) right now. That means that analysts that follow the stock keep increasing the amount of money they think Netflix is going to make this year and next year. In fact, 13 analysts have pushed up their earnings estimates for the current year. The average of their estimates or our Zacks Consensus Estimate has gone from 31 cents to 41 cents for this year. Next year's average has gone from 96 cents to $1.02. \nEvery time you share this video, I get one step closer to the What About Dave Netflix special. Chime in the comments section below, let me know if you subscribe to Netflix or you're just stealing your ex's log-in info.

      "text": "What's on Netflix > Other > What does Donald Trump mean for Netflix? What does Donald Trump mean for Netflix? Tweet \nDonald Trump’s journey from property magnate to the most powerful man in the world has begun. You might have noticed since the story has dominated world headlines since he became President-Elect. \nOf all of Trump’s policies, the one that has the potential to impact Netflix the most is Trump’s stance on Net Neutrality. He’s against it. \nWhat, you may well ask, is Net Neutrality? Simply put, it’s the rule that requires the big Internet providers (AT&T and Verizon for example) to distribute all content evenly. In effect, they are not allowed to favour their products over those of Netflix and the like. \nTrump has appointed two advisors to his “landing” team who are opposed to Net Neutrality and since the rules were brought in by President Obama, they are likely to be seeking to repeal them. This will be an act of pure political difference rather than any great attempt to make the world a better place. \nAnd what the effect of this change in the rules – if it happens – be on Netflix? The loyal fans will continue to navigate directly there, the people who join through word of mouth will continue to do so and the advertising campaigns to draw in new subscribers will go on. But here’s the bad news. If Net Neutrality is withdrawn, Netflix may have to pay premium rates to the delivery services and this increase in costs may well be passed on to subscribers. \nThe Netflix Originals are a powerful product in their portfolio, but Netflix has a substantial advantage as an aggregator of content from many other sources. The reality is that people will never want hundreds on subscriptions to watch hundreds of channels and the aggregators will always win out in this respect. A repeal of Net Neutrality won’t change this but the cost of delivery will rise. Is Donald Trump on Netflix? \nSo we wondered to what extent he features on Netflix. The answer is not a lot. \nThere’s the satirical parody from the Funny or Die Presents team: Donald Trump’s The Art Of The Deal. This is a TV movie that spoofs Trump’s bestselling book and stars Johnny Depp. While the movie was released this year, the book was published in 1987, so the material is dated and is best presented as a mockumentary. While Depp doesn’t look or sound like Donald Trump, he does a reasonable job in an otherwise unfunny offering. It leaves you wondering if the production team bothered to read the book. There’s certainly little informative research to help you understand the mind of the future president. \nAnd there’s 13th, a powerful documentary about the criminalization of African Americans in which Trump typically mouths off. And some of the comedians have a go at him. \nAnd that’s about it. None of his celebrated cameos (Home Alone 2 and Zoolander for example) is currently streaming although they have done in the past and might again in the future. \nFinally, will we see more of Donald Trump on Netflix in the future? Surely it’s inevitable. The documentary makers, the comedians, the satirists and the movie makers are going to be all over this presidency like never before. Trump is a character who attracted controversy and the cameras before this latest chapter in his life, and that will now be amplified a hundredfold.

      "title": "Today Is The Day You Finally Make Yourself The Famous ‘Moist Maker’ From ‘Friends’",
      "text": "\nNBC\nEveryone who has a Netflix account rejoiced when “ Friends ” was finally added last year. Fans of the show were once again treated to Chanandler Bong, ugly naked guy and Ross’ pet monkey Marcel. With Thanksgiving in the rearview, the time is right to unearth another “Friends” classic: “The Moist Maker” \nRecently, Youtuber Binging with Babish (AKA Andrew Rea) set out to create the memorable sandwich that became famous when Ross Geller explained that someone at work had eaten his Thanksgiving leftovers. Although similar to the sandwich people all over the country make in the days following Thanksgiving, there was one clear difference. The secret is an extra slice of gravy-soaked bread in the middle that Ross affectionately refers to as “The Moist Maker” \nTo make his version of the sandwich, Rea used turkey, cranberry sauce, home-made sausage stuffing, gravy and white bread. The video details each step including the preparation of stuffing (in an “aggressively” buttered casserole dish), gravy, cranberry sauce, the roasted turkey as well as the sandwich itself. It’s a fairly long process, but so so worth it. \n\nThe sandwich itself starts with a piece of toasted white bread. He then adds thick slices of turkey and some stuffing. After this comes “The Moist-Maker”, a toasted slice of bread that has been dipped in gravy. He finishes it with a layer of dark meat, more stuffing, cranberry sauce and finally another piece of toasted bread. Quick q: Why no bacon? Add bacon, folks. \nHe didn’t skimp on the traditional-nature of the sandwich by using store-bought turkey cold cuts. He prepared his own turkey from start to finish and even made his own gravy using stock from the nasty bits of the turkey. The video goes into so much detail that someone who has never even cooked a turkey could likely make this sandwich if they had enough time and patience to do so. He even explains how to slice your turkey once it has cooked, something that gives people fits all over the country.\n",

      "text": "Critics Weigh In on Netflix's Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life Next Up The Walking Dead : What's Next for Daryl? \n[Warning! This story contains spoilers from the final episode of Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life ! Read at your own risk!] \nWhen Netflix announced it was reviving the beloved WB/CW series Gilmore Girls , there were three subjects fans desperately wanted and needed the revival to address. First, there was the topic of the infamous \" final four words \" that fans were denied when series creator Amy Sherman-Palladino and her husband and executive producer, Daniel Palladino , left amid contract disputes following Season 6. \nSecond, fans wanted closure regarding the battle for Rory's ( Alexis Bledel )'s heart. It sounds trivial -- and it totally is -- but friendships have been straight up ruined over the never-ending argument surrounding whether Rory belonged with first love Dean ( Jared Padalecki ), bad-boy-turned-author Jess ( Milo Ventimiglia ) or college boyfriend Logan ( Matt Czuchry ). And lastly, fans needed to know if Lorelai ( Lauren Graham ) and Luke ( Scott Patterson ) eventually received the happy ending they were cheated in the original series. \nWell, the good news is that Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life delivered on all fronts. We learned the somewhat shocking but still somehow fitting final four words, the mystery of Rory's love life was finally (sort of) resolved, and Luke and Lorelai tied the knot during an intimate ceremony in the middle of the night with just Rory, Lane ( Keiko Agena ) and Michel ( Yanic Truesdale ) in attendance. \nWhy Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life is not going to be enough for fans Lauren Graham and Scott Patterson, Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life \nAhead of their planned wedding the next day, the two swapped vows during a fantastical sequence that saw Stars Hollow's town square transformed by a glitter gun-wielding Kirk into a fairy tale-like setting befitting of a town so whimsical and strange it could only exist in fiction. The only way the sequence, which occurred in the final minutes of the final episode, could have been improved is if Lane and Michel were swapped out for Jess and Sookie ( Melissa McCarthy ). Their appearance at the late night ceremony, while not wholly out of left field given that Lane worked for Luke for years and Michel -- though he'd never admit it -- is one of Lorelai's closest friends, still felt a bit like they were merely standing in for the people who should have been there but couldn't because of logistics. \nOf course, just because Luke and Lorelai finally received a happy ending doesn't mean the road traveled was without hurdles. Lorelai chose not to tell Luke she continued to go to therapy even after Emily ( Kelly Bishop ) chose to stop, and Luke never revealed to Lorelai that he accompanied Emily to look at possible locations for a Luke's franchise, which was one of Richard's ( Edward Herrmann ) dying wishes. Their respective secrets, and a complicated storyline in which they explored surrogacy, eventually created a rift between the couple, and when Lorelai announced she was going to hike the Pacific Crest Trail after reading Wild , Luke incorrectly assumed her need for space meant she was leaving him. \nTo be honest, Lorelai going hiking -- and without cute hiking boots! -- was so out of character that it's hard to fault Luke for jumping to conclusions. It certainly didn't help that Jess agreed her actions appeared to signal a dramatic shift in their relationship, but in the end Lorelai didn't need to go hiking to find what she was looking for. She found closure regarding her father's death and a sense of peace near, what else, a diner with a view. When she returned -- and after Luke broke out into a typical Luke rant about all the reasons they shouldn't break up -- Lorelai told him she thought they should get married. \nAfter seven seasons, marriages to other people, a surprise daughter and years of waiting and scowling, Luke and Lorelai finally got the happy ending they deserved, and it was perfect. \nAll four episodes of Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life are now streaming on Netflix.",

      "text": "Michel (Yanic Truesdale) on Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life . Suzanne Hanover / Netflix ID: 10053708 Gilmore Girls is great at many things; diversity has never been one of them. But there’s a sense in the Netflix revival, Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life , that Amy Sherman-Palladino and co. realize they had to make up for lost time.\nThe first line Michel (Yanic Truesdale) speaks in the revival, for example, tell us more about his personal life than we learned throughout the series’ original seven-season run: “I just don’t understand it. Before we got married, Frederick was more indifferent to children than I am.” It’s hardly surprising that Michel is married to a man — but it certainly took long enough for Gilmore Girls to confirm that he’s gay.\nIn the second episode, “Spring,” Taylor (Michael Winters) announces the first ever Stars Hollow Gay Pride Parade — then laments that there aren’t enough gay people in town to march in it. “How is that possible?” Lorelai (Lauren Graham) wonders. “We have such cute houses,” Babette (Sally Struthers) adds. It’s not the most nuanced joke, but it does at least allow the show to look at its past failings a bit more critically.\nView this image ›\nSam Pancake as Donald. Netflix\nID: 10053847 To Gilmore Girls ’ credit, the same scene introduces a new character named Donald (Sam Pancake), who could easily turn into the Little Britain sketch about “the only gay in the village,” but is actually pretty charming. It’s also implied that Taylor himself could be in the closet when Gypsy (Rose Abdoo) and other Stars Hollow dwellers push him on the parade issue, wondering if there’s anyone else (wink wink) who could march. Sadly, we’ll have to wait until there’s another season of the revival to see if he ever decides to march alongside Donald. (Michel, of course, would never.)\nA Year in the Life doesn’t deserve too much credit for its minor uptick in gay representation, but Michel’s casual coming out is still something to be celebrated — it’s both matter-of-fact and integral to his storyline, as we learn Frederick wants to adopt a child and Michel isn’t exactly a kid person. A parade would be a bit much at this point, but we can give Gilmore Girls a smattering of applause.",

      "text": "Did anyone really need a “Gilmore Girls” revival? No more so than an updated “Full House,” which doesn’t mean the practice isn’t smart business-wise for Netflix — not just tapping into nostalgia, but offering fans an excuse to revisit old episodes.\nEnter “Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,” four 90-minute installments — length-wise the equivalent of about eight TV episodes — served up as a bountiful Thanksgiving weekend binge. Series creator Amy Sherman-Palladino has reassembled practically the entire gang (with the sad absence of the late, great Edward Herrmann), plus some bonuses, kicking off with “Winter” and proceeding through the seasons.\nNetflix loaded up its screeners with detailed spoiler warnings, which seems silly given the contours of the exercise. All that really needs to be said — not quite a decade after the show concluded its seven-year run — is that 32-year-old Rory (Alexis Bledel) comes back to visit Stars Hollow, where she finds her mom Lorelai (Lauren Graham) as feisty and fast-talking as ever, along with a lot of other familiar faces.\nThose include Lorelai’s mom (Kelly Bishop), still wrestling with the grief of her loss; and Luke (Scott Patterson), who in one of the amusing recurring gags keeps giving out wrong passwords for his diner’s Wi-Fi access.\nThe four-season structure actually creates some problems. At 90 minutes, the story tends to meander, providing lots of time for rat-a-tat banter (and references to things that weren’t on the radar when the show signed off, like “Game of Thrones”) but moving the plot along at a snail’s pace.\nSo while there’s plenty of trademark whimsy, there are also indulgences like the musical number in the third episode, which is clever but drags on too long.\nThose pacing issues also apply to the closing chapter, which, without giving anything away, allowed Sherman-Palladino to craft an ending she was denied, having left before the show completed its network run.\nGranted, this tepid appraisal comes from someone who, unlike much of the critical community, wasn’t gaga for “Gilmore” during its original incarnation. For the faithful, just seeing the cast re-inhabit these characters — or savoring interludes like Lorelai and her mom awkwardly braving therapy sessions — is probably reward enough.\nNetflix’s pragmatism in bankrolling such revivals nevertheless contains a whiff of cynicism, inasmuch as it’s so obviously designed to bolster the “If you just watched” part of its algorithm, while exploiting a media sphere that increasingly caters to the passions of small fan bases, in essence serving as its eager marketing partner.\nIt’s hard to argue with the strategy, validated by the fact “Gilmore Girls” has been trending since the review embargo broke November 16. To borrow from a Carole King song, that’s because the streaming service has recognized that even if something like “Gilmore Girls” isn’t a showstopper, where it leads, we will follow.\n“Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life” premieres November 25 on Netflix.",

And lastly, fans needed to know if Lorelai (Lauren Graham) and Luke (Scott Patterson) eventually received the happy ending they were cheated in the original series. \nWell, the good news is that   delivered on all fronts. We learned the somewhat shocking but still somehow fitting final four words, the mystery of Rory's love life was finally (sort of) resolved, and Luke and Lorelai tied the knot during an intimate ceremony in the middle of the night with just Rory, Lane (Keiko Agena) and Michel (Yanic Truesdale) in attendance. \nWhy   is not going to be enough for fans Lauren Graham and Scott Patterson,  \" data-image-credit=\"Saeed Adyani/Netflix\" data-image-alt-text=\"161123-gilmore-girls-news.jpg\" data-image-credit-url=\"\" data-image-target-url=\"\" data-image-title=\"Lauren Graham, Scott Patterson,  \" data-image-filename=\"161123-gilmore-girls-news.jpg\" data-image-date-created=\"2016/11/23\" data-image-crop=\"\" data-image-crop-gravity=\"\" data-image-aspect-ratio=\"\" data-image-height=\"1380\" data-image-width=\"2070\" data-image-do-not-crop=\"\" data-image-do-not-resize=\"\" data-image-watermark=\"\" data-lightbox=\"\">\nAhead of their planned wedding the next day, the two swapped vows during a fantastical sequence that saw Stars Hollow's town square transformed by a glitter gun-wielding Kirk into a fairy tale-like setting befitting of a town so whimsical and strange it could only exist in fiction. The only way the sequence, which occurred in the final minutes of the final episode, could have been improved is if Lane and Michel were swapped out for Jess and Sookie (Melissa McCarthy). Their appearance at the late night ceremony, while not wholly out of left field given that Lane worked for Luke for years and Michel -- though he'd never admit it -- is one of Lorelai's closest friends, still felt a bit like they were merely standing in for the people who should have been there but couldn't because of logistics. \nOf course, just because Luke and Lorelai finally received a happy ending doesn't mean the road traveled was without hurdles. Lorelai chose not to tell Luke she continued to go to therapy even after Emily (Kelly Bishop) chose to stop, and Luke never revealed to Lorelai that he accompanied Emily to look at possible locations for a Luke's franchise, which was one of Richard's (Edward Herrmann) dying wishes. Their respective secrets, and a complicated storyline in which they explored surrogacy, eventually created a rift between the couple, and when Lorelai announced she was going to hike the Pacific Crest Trail after reading Wild, Luke incorrectly assumed her need for space meant she was leaving him. \nTo be honest, Lorelai going hiking -- and without cute hiking boots! -- was so out of character that it's hard to fault Luke for jumping to conclusions. It certainly didn't help that Jess agreed her actions appeared to signal a dramatic shift in their relationship, but in the end Lorelai didn't need to go hiking to find what she was looking for. She found closure regarding her father's death and a sense of peace near, what else, a diner with a view. When she returned -- and after Luke broke out into a typical Luke rant about all the reasons they shouldn't break up -- Lorelai told him she thought they should get married. \nAfter seven seasons, marriages to other people, a surprise daughter and years of waiting and scowling, Luke and Lorelai finally got the happy ending they deserved, and it was perfect. \n  now   GirlsLauren GrahamScott Patterson About Us",

First, there was the topic of the infamous \"final four words\" that fans were denied when series creator Amy Sherman-Palladino and her husband and executive producer, Daniel Palladino, left amid   \nSecond, fans wanted closure regarding the battle for Rory's (Alexis Bledel)'s heart. It sounds trivial -- and it totally is -- but friendships have been straight up ruined over the never-ending argument surrounding whether Rory belonged with first love Dean (Jared Padalecki), bad-boy-turned-author Jess (Milo Ventimiglia) or college boyfriend Logan (Matt Czuchry). And lastly, fans needed to know if Lorelai (Lauren Graham) and Luke (Scott Patterson) eventually received the happy ending they were cheated in the original series. \nWell, the good news is that   delivered on all fronts. We learned the somewhat shocking but still somehow fitting final four words, the mystery of Rory's love life was finally (sort of) resolved, and Luke and Lorelai tied the knot during an intimate ceremony in the middle of the night with just Rory, Lane (Keiko Agena) and Michel (Yanic Truesdale) in attendance. \nWhy   is not going to be enough for fans Lauren Graham and Scott Patterson,  \" data-image-credit=\"Saeed Adyani/Netflix\" data-image-alt-text=\"161123-gilmore-girls-news.jpg\" data-image-credit-url=\"\" data-image-target-url=\"\" data-image-title=\"Lauren Graham, Scott Patterson,  \" data-image-filename=\"161123-gilmore-girls-news.jpg\" data-image-date-created=\"2016/11/23\" data-image-crop=\"\" data-image-crop-gravity=\"\" data-image-aspect-ratio=\"\" data-image-height=\"1380\" data-image-width=\"2070\" data-image-do-not-crop=\"\" data-image-do-not-resize=\"\" data-image-watermark=\"\" data-lightbox=\"\">\nAhead of their planned wedding the next day, the two swapped vows during a fantastical sequence that saw Stars Hollow's town square transformed by a glitter gun-wielding Kirk into a fairy tale-like setting befitting of a town so whimsical and strange it could only exist in fiction. The only way the sequence, which occurred in the final minutes of the final episode, could have been improved is if Lane and Michel were swapped out for Jess and Sookie (Melissa McCarthy). Their appearance at the late night ceremony, while not wholly out of left field given that Lane worked for Luke for years and Michel -- though he'd never admit it -- is one of Lorelai's closest friends, still felt a bit like they were merely standing in for the people who should have been there but couldn't because of logistics. \nOf course, just because Luke and Lorelai finally received a happy ending doesn't mean the road traveled was without hurdles. Lorelai chose not to tell Luke she continued to go to therapy even after Emily (Kelly Bishop) chose to stop, and Luke never revealed to Lorelai that he accompanied Emily to look at possible locations for a Luke's franchise, which was one of Richard's (Edward Herrmann) dying wishes. Their respective secrets, and a complicated storyline in which they explored surrogacy, eventually created a rift between the couple, and when Lorelai announced she was going to hike the Pacific Crest Trail after reading Wild, Luke incorrectly assumed her need for space meant she was leaving him. \nTo be honest, Lorelai going hiking -- and without cute hiking boots! -- was so out of character that it's hard to fault Luke for jumping to conclusions. It certainly didn't help that Jess agreed her actions appeared to signal a dramatic shift in their relationship, but in the end Lorelai didn't need to go hiking to find what she was looking for. She found closure regarding her father's death and a sense of peace near, what else, a diner with a view. When she returned -- and after Luke broke out into a typical Luke rant about all the reasons they shouldn't break up -- Lorelai told him she thought they should get married. \nAfter seven seasons, marriages to other people, a surprise daughter and years of waiting and scowling, Luke and Lorelai finally got the happy ending they deserved, and it was perfect. \n  now   GirlsLauren GrahamScott Patterson About Us",

      "text": "Gilmore Girls: Did Luke and Lorelai Get the Happy Ending They Deserve?   8:  \nWhen Netflix announced it was reviving the beloved WB/CW series Gilmore Girls, there were three subjects fans desperately wanted and needed the revival to address. First, there was the topic of the infamous \"final four words\" that fans were denied when series creator Amy Sherman-Palladino and her husband and executive producer, Daniel Palladino, left amid   \nSecond, fans wanted closure regarding the battle for Rory's (Alexis Bledel)'s heart. It sounds trivial -- and it totally is -- but friendships have been straight up ruined over the never-ending argument surrounding whether Rory belonged with first love Dean (Jared Padalecki), bad-boy-turned-author Jess (Milo Ventimiglia) or college boyfriend Logan (Matt Czuchry). And lastly, fans needed to know if Lorelai (Lauren Graham) and Luke (Scott Patterson) eventually received the happy ending they were cheated in the original series. \nWell, the good news is that   delivered on all fronts. We learned the somewhat shocking but still somehow fitting final four words, the mystery of Rory's love life was finally (sort of) resolved, and Luke and Lorelai tied the knot during an intimate ceremony in the middle of the night with just Rory, Lane (Keiko Agena) and Michel (Yanic Truesdale) in attendance. \nWhy   is not going to be enough for fans Lauren Graham and Scott Patterson,  \" data-image-credit=\"Saeed Adyani/Netflix\" data-image-alt-text=\"161123-gilmore-girls-news.jpg\" data-image-credit-url=\"\" data-image-target-url=\"\" data-image-title=\"Lauren Graham, Scott Patterson,  \" data-image-filename=\"161123-gilmore-girls-news.jpg\" data-image-date-created=\"2016/11/23\" data-image-crop=\"\" data-image-crop-gravity=\"\" data-image-aspect-ratio=\"\" data-image-height=\"1380\" data-image-width=\"2070\" data-image-do-not-crop=\"\" data-image-do-not-resize=\"\" data-image-watermark=\"\" data-lightbox=\"\">\nAhead of their planned wedding the next day, the two swapped vows during a fantastical sequence that saw Stars Hollow's town square transformed by a glitter gun-wielding Kirk into a fairy tale-like setting befitting of a town so whimsical and strange it could only exist in fiction.

      "text": "Netflix 's Gilmore Girls : A Year in the Life debuted Friday, Nov. 25 on the streaming service, and fans are already champing at the bit for more. It was the cliffhanger to end all cliffhangers, especially since Logan was engaged to be married to another woman and Rory had finally closed the door on their complicated relationship earlier in the episode. [...] yet it was also a perfect ending to a series about the often complicated relationships between mothers and daughters. The show came full circle in that moment, and although many fans want to know what happens next -- especially since Jess (Milo Ventimiglia) does not appear to be over Rory if that longing look through the window in \"Fall\" was any indication -- it's also not necessary for the show to continue at this point.",

      "title": "Gilmore Girls: Did Luke and Lorelai Get the Happy Ending They Deserve?",
      "text": "Gilmore Girls: Did Luke and Lorelai Get the Happy Ending They Deserve?   8:  \nWhen Netflix announced it was reviving the beloved WB/CW series Gilmore Girls, there were three subjects fans desperately wanted and needed the revival to address. First, there was the topic of the infamous \"final four words\" that fans were denied when series creator Amy Sherman-Palladino and her husband and executive producer, Daniel Palladino, left amid   \nSecond, fans wanted closure regarding the battle for Rory's (Alexis Bledel)'s heart. It sounds trivial -- and it totally is -- but friendships have been straight up ruined over the never-ending argument surrounding whether Rory belonged with first love Dean (Jared Padalecki), bad-boy-turned-author Jess (Milo Ventimiglia) or college boyfriend Logan (Matt Czuchry). And lastly, fans needed to know if Lorelai (Lauren Graham) and Luke (Scott Patterson) eventually received the happy ending they were cheated in the original series. \nWell, the good news is that   delivered on all fronts. We learned the somewhat shocking but still somehow fitting final four words, the mystery of Rory's love life was finally (sort of) resolved, and Luke and Lorelai tied the knot during an intimate ceremony in the middle of the night with just Rory, Lane (Keiko Agena) and Michel (Yanic Truesdale) in attendance. \nWhy   is not going to be enough for fans Lauren Graham and Scott Patterson,  \" data-image-credit=\"Saeed Adyani/Netflix\" data-image-alt-text=\"161123-gilmore-girls-news.jpg\" data-image-credit-url=\"\" data-image-target-url=\"\" data-image-title=\"Lauren Graham, Scott Patterson,  \" data-image-filename=\"161123-gilmore-girls-news.jpg\" data-image-date-created=\"2016/11/23\" data-image-crop=\"\" data-image-crop-gravity=\"\" data-image-aspect-ratio=\"\" data-image-height=\"1380\" data-image-width=\"2070\" data-image-do-not-crop=\"\" data-image-do-not-resize=\"\" data-image-watermark=\"\" data-lightbox=\"\">\nAhead of their planned wedding the next day, the two swapped vows during a fantastical sequence that saw Stars Hollow's town square transformed by a glitter gun-wielding Kirk into a fairy tale-like setting befitting of a town so whimsical and strange it could only exist in fiction. The only way the sequence, which occurred in the final minutes of the final episode, could have been improved is if Lane and Michel were swapped out for Jess and Sookie (Melissa McCarthy). Their appearance at the late night ceremony, while not wholly out of left field given that Lane worked for Luke for years and Michel -- though he'd never admit it -- is one of Lorelai's closest friends, still felt a bit like they were merely standing in for the people who should have been there but couldn't because of logistics. \nOf course, just because Luke and Lorelai finally received a happy ending doesn't mean the road traveled was without hurdles. Lorelai chose not to tell Luke she continued to go to therapy even after Emily (Kelly Bishop) chose to stop, and Luke never revealed to Lorelai that he accompanied Emily to look at possible locations for a Luke's franchise, which was one of Richard's (Edward Herrmann) dying wishes. Their respective secrets, and a complicated storyline in which they explored surrogacy, eventually created a rift between the couple, and when Lorelai announced she was going to hike the Pacific Crest Trail after reading Wild, Luke incorrectly assumed her need for space meant she was leaving him. \nTo be honest, Lorelai going hiking -- and without cute hiking boots! -- was so out of character that it's hard to fault Luke for jumping to conclusions. It certainly didn't help that Jess agreed her actions appeared to signal a dramatic shift in their relationship, but in the end Lorelai didn't need to go hiking to find what she was looking for. She found closure regarding her father's death and a sense of peace near, what else, a diner with a view. When she returned -- and after Luke broke out into a typical Luke rant about all the reasons they shouldn't break up -- Lorelai told him she thought they should get married. \nAfter seven seasons, marriages to other people, a surprise daughter and years of waiting and scowling, Luke and Lorelai finally got the happy ending they deserved, and it was perfect. \n  now   GirlsLauren GrahamScott Patterson About Us",

      "title": "Gilmore Girls: Did Luke and Lorelai Get the Happy Ending They Deserve?",
      "text": "Gilmore Girls: Did Luke and Lorelai Get the Happy Ending They Deserve?   8:  \nWhen Netflix announced it was reviving the beloved WB/CW series Gilmore Girls, there were three subjects fans desperately wanted and needed the revival to address. First, there was the topic of the infamous \"final four words\" that fans were denied when series creator Amy Sherman-Palladino and her husband and executive producer, Daniel Palladino, left amid   \nSecond, fans wanted closure regarding the battle for Rory's (Alexis Bledel)'s heart. It sounds trivial -- and it totally is -- but friendships have been straight up ruined over the never-ending argument surrounding whether Rory belonged with first love Dean (Jared Padalecki), bad-boy-turned-author Jess (Milo Ventimiglia) or college boyfriend Logan (Matt Czuchry). And lastly, fans needed to know if Lorelai (Lauren Graham) and Luke (Scott Patterson) eventually received the happy ending they were cheated in the original series. \nWell, the good news is that   delivered on all fronts. We learned the somewhat shocking but still somehow fitting final four words, the mystery of Rory's love life was finally (sort of) resolved, and Luke and Lorelai tied the knot during an intimate ceremony in the middle of the night with just Rory, Lane (Keiko Agena) and Michel (Yanic Truesdale) in attendance. \nWhy   is not going to be enough for fans Lauren Graham and Scott Patterson,  \" data-image-credit=\"Saeed Adyani/Netflix\" data-image-alt-text=\"161123-gilmore-girls-news.jpg\" data-image-credit-url=\"\" data-image-target-url=\"\" data-image-title=\"Lauren Graham, Scott Patterson,  \" data-image-filename=\"161123-gilmore-girls-news.jpg\" data-image-date-created=\"2016/11/23\" data-image-crop=\"\" data-image-crop-gravity=\"\" data-image-aspect-ratio=\"\" data-image-height=\"1380\" data-image-width=\"2070\" data-image-do-not-crop=\"\" data-image-do-not-resize=\"\" data-image-watermark=\"\" data-lightbox=\"\">\nAhead of their planned wedding the next day, the two swapped vows during a fantastical sequence that saw Stars Hollow's town square transformed by a glitter gun-wielding Kirk into a fairy tale-like setting befitting of a town so whimsical and strange it could only exist in fiction. The only way the sequence, which occurred in the final minutes of the final episode, could have been improved is if Lane and Michel were swapped out for Jess and Sookie (Melissa McCarthy). Their appearance at the late night ceremony, while not wholly out of left field given that Lane worked for Luke for years and Michel -- though he'd never admit it -- is one of Lorelai's closest friends, still felt a bit like they were merely standing in for the people who should have been there but couldn't because of logistics. \nOf course, just because Luke and Lorelai finally received a happy ending doesn't mean the road traveled was without hurdles. Lorelai chose not to tell Luke she continued to go to therapy even after Emily (Kelly Bishop) chose to stop, and Luke never revealed to Lorelai that he accompanied Emily to look at possible locations for a Luke's franchise, which was one of Richard's (Edward Herrmann) dying wishes. Their respective secrets, and a complicated storyline in which they explored surrogacy, eventually created a rift between the couple, and when Lorelai announced she was going to hike the Pacific Crest Trail after reading Wild, Luke incorrectly assumed her need for space meant she was leaving him. \nTo be honest, Lorelai going hiking -- and without cute hiking boots! -- was so out of character that it's hard to fault Luke for jumping to conclusions. It certainly didn't help that Jess agreed her actions appeared to signal a dramatic shift in their relationship, but in the end Lorelai didn't need to go hiking to find what she was looking for. She found closure regarding her father's death and a sense of peace near, what else, a diner with a view. When she returned -- and after Luke broke out into a typical Luke rant about all the reasons they shouldn't break up -- Lorelai told him she thought they should get married. \nAfter seven seasons, marriages to other people, a surprise daughter and years of waiting and scowling, Luke and Lorelai finally got the happy ending they deserved, and it was perfect. \n  now   GirlsLauren GrahamScott Patterson About Us",

      "text": "Jason Reynolds \nThere’s no denying that one of the most anticipated Netflix shows this year has been the revival of the Gilmore Girls property; let’s get caught up on the first two episodes in the four-episode season with a Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life recap of Winter . If you read our spoiler of Winter , you knew pretty much what was going to happen, but the devil, as they say, is in the details. \nWinter opens up with a series of voice overs that highlight some of the best episodes from the seven seasons (“I love you, you idiot!,” and “How many cups have you had this morning?”), ending with Lauren Graham saying, “I smell snow…” It smells like snow. [Image by Netflix] \nCue the familiar opening music and a slop a slow panning shot to Lorelai sitting on the steps of the gazebo in the middle of the Star’s Hollow commons, taking a deep breath, and we’re home again. Rory comes up behind her and plops down. Cue the fast talking, and it’s like only a week has passed, not the almost-decade since Rory left on her political junket. A joke about how it’s been a while since Rory has done this gives a subtle nod to the time passing, and then it’s off to an abbreviated town tour. \nAfter a brief catch-up on what’s been going on in town (Le Chat closed, parking meters have come and gone, and Taylor is trying to get a town sewer system), Rory gets a phone call on one of her three phones and runs around trying to get reception. She finally finds it next to the produce case in Doose’s, where she juggles a conversation with Lane, talking on the phone, and handing out cabbages. It’s like we never left Star’s Hollow. \nOutside, Lorelai runs into Kirk, who has a pet pig named Petal. Apparently, when he and Lulu were discussing having a kid, the town chipped in and bought them a pet pig, which, hopefully bought the town a couple of years. That Lulu and Kirk having a kid would be a disaster is sort of a given, but it would probably be a great kid, because it would be raised by the entire town at some point. Tacos and mini donuts don’t count as real food. [Image by Netflix] \nLorelai and Rory head home and there’s Luke, cooking away in the kitchen. Two separate main courses, mac and cheese, and parmesan cutlets with garlic bread. No tater tots, however, even if they do go great in tacos. \nA short while later, a dinner guest arrives. Paul, Rory’s boyfriend, shows up, and nobody remembers him. This is a running gag throughout all four episodes, and it’s used sparingly enough that it’s still funny. Trust Luke to remember the wrench, though. \nLuke and Lorelai head to bed, with some Gilmore Girl -level bed talk about how Rory could hear the two of them rollicking. After they go to bed, Lorelai wakes up from a recurring nightmare about a dirty bathroom (who doesn’t have those types of dreams?). She hears some tapping from somewhere in the house (I had some horrified concern that it was Rory and Paul rollicking). Turns out it’s Rory in the kitchen, doing stress tap dancing. Yes. Tap dancing to relieve stress. \nThe next day, Rory leaves on a plane to London (cue another Paul bit), where we learn that Paul drinks tea. Seriously, how did Rory end up with this guy? We follow Lorelai to the Dragonfly, where we get confirmation of what we all really knew. Michel’s husband, Frederick, wants children, while the thought of them sends Michel into conniptions. \nWe also find out what happened to Sookie. She went on a retreat for a six-month sabbatical and ended up staying for a year. Lorelai says she’s developing food-growing techniques to help people who eat them, while Michel is less kind. “…she’s squatting in a cabin with no phone service, trying to grow a pineapple out of a coat rack.!” \nLater that day, Lorelai is forced to take Kurt’s new ride-sharing venture, Öööber (not to be mistaken with Uber), to her mother’s house for the weekly Friday Night Dinner. His ride service comes complete with complementary water in a Brita-filter pitcher, and music in the form of Kurt singing any song as long as it’s by The Carpenters. \nLorelai arrives at her mother’s house just as Kurt’s car dies. Rory arrives a few minutes later, and we meet Emily’s new maid and an entire new family that has moved in. Emily shows off a new portrait of Richard, but it’s so big it covers almost an entire wall. Lorelai pesters her mom until Emily breaks down and admits it was a mistake, sniping at Lorelai, “I’m a screw up! I admit it! Just please, don’t let this be the only thing you remember to say at my funeral!” Wait. What? [Image by Netflix] \nCue a flashback to Richard’s funeral, where Digger makes an appearance. Apparently, after Luke drove Rory to the airport, a very drunk Lorelai was coerced into sharing her favorite Richard story. A panicked Lorelai (and that’s never a good thing) comes up with a story where Lorelai was left in a steam trunk when her dad went on a business trip, and another tale of him walking in on her and Teddy Wiedemier III rollicking. If ever there is a way to kill a conversation, Lorelai can find it. \nAfter the guests leave, Emily and Lorelai have a fight in the kitchen. Emily accuses Lorelai of premeditating the entire thing, while a flustered Lorelai tries to assure her mother that it was a combination of drinking her weight in Scotch, and being surprised. Emily calls Lorelai a natural disaster, and starts in on Lorelai’s relationship with Luke. Did Lorelai ever ask Luke what he wanted? Emily kicks Lorelai out of her house, and here we are, full-freaking circle. \nBack in the present, everyone is at the Friday Night Dinner, including Kirk. Luke shows up to take everyone home, and along the way, Lorelai asks if he wants more kids. Luke says that he had thought about it in the past, but that now he doesn’t. Of course Lorelai can’t help but think that he’s missing out on something, so she makes an appointment for them at a surrogacy clinic. \nThe surrogacy and fertility clinic, Dynasty Makers, is run by none other than Paris Gellar, who takes a personal hand in helping them select the perfect candidate. Luke seems out of his depth, pointing out that he doesn’t want to have sex with any of these women. And when Paris mentions that Neil Patrick Harris is a client, Luke is out the door, heading for the hills. No adoption, no surrogacy, and that means no kids. \nFlash to Rory in London, meeting up with Naomi (played by Alex Kingston), the person she wrote her New Yorker piece about. It’s a fairly humorous scene, with plenty of nods to Doctor Who for those of you paying attention. A score for Team Logan. [Image by Netflix] \nOf course, that’s just a detail when we find out that Rory is staying with Logan (Score one for Team Logan) and still sleeping with him in an open relationship. He’s still engaged to Odette, who lives in Paris, so Logan and Rory have a set of “Vegas rules” for their relationship. What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas. However, remember that the last time they did this, it didn’t end well. \nThe following day, Rory is back in Star’s Hollow and bumps into Paris, who has brought two of her top surrogates by Luke’s Diner. She tells them to close the deal, and that isn’t threatening or ominous at all. Paris talks about how she’s getting divorced from Doyle, who apparently is now a big screenwriter and has gone a little hipster on her. \nTaylor comes in to Luke’s and asks him for testimonial on the transition from septic tanks to a town-wide sewer system. Luke blows him off and Taylor explodes into a rant. Watching him go off on everything and everyone around him is hilarious and a sober reminder that Lorelai and Rory aren’t the only fast talkers on the show. A sympathetic Luke follows Taylor as he leaves and gives him what he asked for. Emily Gilmore in jeans and a t-shirt. We’ve seen it all now. [Image by Netflix] \nWorried about her mother, Lorelai swings by her house to check up on her, finding Emily in a Candie’s t-shirt and jeans. She’s taking decluttering advice and throwing everything out that doesn’t bring her joy. Which is everything. Lorelai tells her that nothing will bring her joy right now, and suggests talking to a therapist. \nThe next day, Luke and Lorelai come to the realization and agreement that they aren’t going to go the surrogacy route. No kids, just drinks. They meet Kirk who has put an end to Öööber, and tells them that if they see any handsome attorneys from Uber, that it was Dirk who ran that business and so recklessly violated trademark laws. Oh, Kirk. On to your next job, I suppose. \nEmily calls Lorelai and tells her that she has found a therapist. Emily invites Lorelai to stop by, and Lorelai agrees while Luke sighs in the background. After Lorelai gets off the phone, Luke reminds Lorelai that she is now going to therapy with her mother. Lorelai protests until the realization truck hits her and says, “Oh crap. I’m going to therapy with my mother.” \nThis episode was a great return to Star’s Hollow and a nice way to show how everything has changed. Despite some rough patches, the show continues to charm, and I’m even more impressed with Kelly Bishop’s acting as Emily Gilmore than ever. \nGilmore Girls: A Year in the Life is currently available for streaming on Netflix wherever Netflix is available. \n[Featured Image by Netflix]",

      "title": "Here's How Richard's Death Affects Each of the Gilmore Girls",
      "text": "Critics Weigh In on Netflix's Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life     \nTo say that the death of revered actor Edward Herrmann in 2014 greatly influenced the interconnected narratives of Netflix's   , which debuted Friday on the streaming service, would be an understatement. \nFor seven seasons, Herrmann played respected family patriarch Richard Gilmore, a wealthy and sophisticated graduate of Yale University who, like his granddaughter Rory ( Alexis Bledel ), loved books. Married to Emily ( Kelly Bishop ), who was the picture of WASP society, Richard was an all-around good man despite not being around much when Lorelai ( Lauren Graham ) was growing up. Within the context   , Richard's death occurred four months prior to the start of the first episode, titled \"Winter,\" and his death reverberated through all four of the revival's 90-minute season-themed chapters. \nMuch like when he was alive, Richard affected each of the Gilmore women in a different way in death, and even when he wasn't the topic of conversation, his presence hung over each scene. Here's how each of the three Gilmore women were affected. \nGilmore Girls' four episodes won't ever be enough for fans \nEmily \nWithout Richard, Emily didn't recognize her life or who she was. For the first time in 50 years, she was on her own, and although her grief eventually worked to thaw her heart and release a more relaxed Emily, it wasn't easy to get from point A to point B. She was so overcome with her own grief that she initially failed to recognize the feelings of others, and although this wasn't exactly a new development, it nevertheless still stung. After Lorelai struggled to recall a positive memory of her father at his wake and thus embarrassed her mother in front of Richard's friends, Emily shut Lorelai out until Rory returned home from London four months later. Eventually, she started decluttering the large Hartford home she and Richard had shared in an attempt to reclaim her former joy, but it wasn't until a trip to Nantucket that Emily found true peace, chose to sell the family estate and move permanently to the shore. \nEmily spent much of the revival's second episode, \"Spring,\" in therapy -- something most of the women on this show probably should have done years ago -- and in subsequent episodes struggled just to get out of bed. She was lost and found that nothing she did had much meaning. As time progressed, and with some subtle nudging by Rory, she started to rediscover who she was as a woman and not just who she was as Richard's wife. She quit the obnoxious DAR in epic fashion and found herself working as a docent at a whaling museum in \"Fall.\" It was a position she was oddly suited for. In the final chapter of the story, she'd found peace (and a normal-sized portrait of Richard), and lived in Nantucket with the family of the first maid she'd ever been able to keep longer than a few weeks. Kelly Bishop, Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel,   \nLorelai \nWithout Richard as a buffer, Emily and Lorelai's relationship was even more strained than it was during the show's seven-season run. His death -- and Emily's barbs about how Lorelai couldn't understand Emily's loss because she didn't know what it was like to be married -- made Lorelai question her relationship status with Luke Scott Patterson and the fact they'd never married or had children of their own together. An investigation into surrogacy -- and a confused Luke who never quite grasped how surrogacy worked -- later and the couple still hadn't made much progress. In fact, by that point they were keeping secrets from one another. Lorelai didn't reveal to Luke that she'd continued to go to therapy after Emily quit, and Luke didn't tell Lorelai that he'd gone with Emily to look at possible locations for a Luke franchise, which was one of Richard's dying wishes. \nEventually, after a failed attempt to hike the Pacific Crest Trail (yes, she'd just read Wild ) ended at a roadside diner with a view, Lorelai was able to unlock her emotional block. She'd found what she was searching for, and in a phone call to Emily, recalled with great detail a fond memory of Richard that showcased the loving father he was to her even though it wasn't always apparent. Lorelai returned home and then married Luke. \nGilmore Girls : Here are the final four words and what they mean \nRory \nWhile Emily struggled to find herself as a widow and Lorelai struggled with unresolved feelings for her father, Richard's death affected the youngest Gilmore in a different, less obvious way. It wouldn't be accurate to say she was unaffected by his passing -- after all, Rory had more in common with Richard than either Emily or Lorelai had -- but rather that his death was simply the latest setback in a string of setbacks. \nFor most   , Rory was unmoored, aimlessly drifting between her childhood bedroom, Paris' New York brownstone and Lane's couch. Without a stable job or even reliable job prospects, she was adrift in the sea of obscurity, and she refused to admit she'd returned home permanently to Stars Hollow at 32 because it meant defeat. For most of her sheltered, privileged life, Rory was led to believe she was special, but once Rory entered the real world and discovered there were many young professionals just like her (and some who were even younger), she struggled to find success much the same way she struggled to find her once so clear identity. \nIn \"Summer,\" Rory took on the job of editing the Stars Hollow Gazette just to give her life some purpose (and because otherwise Taylor was going to let it close), but it wasn't until Jess ( Milo Ventimiglia ) planted the seed of writing   Lorelai that Rory had any real direction. Now, Richard probably would have had some key advice for Rory at each step of the way, and he maybe even would have tried to her her land a job, but it was through his absence and his constant memories that she was able to find the woman she was meant to be. In the final episode, Rory found peace and inspiration in Richard's office, and it was where her book, The Gilmore Girls -- which Lorelai later suggested be shortened to just Gilmore Girls -- was born. \n  now streaming on Netflix.",

      "text": "Gilmore Girls: Did Luke and Lorelai Get the Happy Ending They Deserve?   8:  \nWhen Netflix announced it was reviving the beloved WB/CW series Gilmore Girls, there were three subjects fans desperately wanted and needed the revival to address. First, there was the topic of the infamous \"final four words\" that fans were denied when series creator Amy Sherman-Palladino and her husband and executive producer, Daniel Palladino, left amid   \nSecond, fans wanted closure regarding the battle for Rory's (Alexis Bledel)'s heart. It sounds trivial -- and it totally is -- but friendships have been straight up ruined over the never-ending argument surrounding whether Rory belonged with first love Dean (Jared Padalecki), bad-boy-turned-author Jess (Milo Ventimiglia) or college boyfriend Logan (Matt Czuchry). And lastly, fans needed to know if Lorelai (Lauren Graham) and Luke (Scott Patterson) eventually received the happy ending they were cheated in the original series. \nWell, the good news is that   delivered on all fronts. We learned the somewhat shocking but still somehow fitting final four words, the mystery of Rory's love life was finally (sort of) resolved, and Luke and Lorelai tied the knot during an intimate ceremony in the middle of the night with just Rory, Lane (Keiko Agena) and Michel (Yanic Truesdale) in attendance. \nWhy   is not going to be enough for fans Lauren Graham and Scott Patterson,  \" data-image-credit=\"Saeed Adyani/Netflix\" data-image-alt-text=\"161123-gilmore-girls-news.jpg\" data-image-credit-url=\"\" data-image-target-url=\"\" data-image-title=\"Lauren Graham, Scott Patterson,  \" data-image-filename=\"161123-gilmore-girls-news.jpg\" data-image-date-created=\"2016/11/23\" data-image-crop=\"\" data-image-crop-gravity=\"\" data-image-aspect-ratio=\"\" data-image-height=\"1380\" data-image-width=\"2070\" data-image-do-not-crop=\"\" data-image-do-not-resize=\"\" data-image-watermark=\"\" data-lightbox=\"\">\nAhead of their planned wedding the next day, the two swapped vows during a fantastical sequence that saw Stars Hollow's town square transformed by a glitter gun-wielding Kirk into a fairy tale-like setting befitting of a town so whimsical and strange it could only exist in fiction. The only way the sequence, which occurred in the final minutes of the final episode, could have been improved is if Lane and Michel were swapped out for Jess and Sookie (Melissa McCarthy). Their appearance at the late night ceremony, while not wholly out of left field given that Lane worked for Luke for years and Michel -- though he'd never admit it -- is one of Lorelai's closest friends, still felt a bit like they were merely standing in for the people who should have been there but couldn't because of logistics. \nOf course, just because Luke and Lorelai finally received a happy ending doesn't mean the road traveled was without hurdles. Lorelai chose not to tell Luke she continued to go to therapy even after Emily (Kelly Bishop) chose to stop, and Luke never revealed to Lorelai that he accompanied Emily to look at possible locations for a Luke's franchise, which was one of Richard's (Edward Herrmann) dying wishes. Their respective secrets, and a complicated storyline in which they explored surrogacy, eventually created a rift between the couple, and when Lorelai announced she was going to hike the Pacific Crest Trail after reading Wild, Luke incorrectly assumed her need for space meant she was leaving him. \nTo be honest, Lorelai going hiking -- and without cute hiking boots! -- was so out of character that it's hard to fault Luke for jumping to conclusions. It certainly didn't help that Jess agreed her actions appeared to signal a dramatic shift in their relationship, but in the end Lorelai didn't need to go hiking to find what she was looking for. She found closure regarding her father's death and a sense of peace near, what else, a diner with a view. When she returned -- and after Luke broke out into a typical Luke rant about all the reasons they shouldn't break up -- Lorelai told him she thought they should get married. \nAfter seven seasons, marriages to other people, a surprise daughter and years of waiting and scowling, Luke and Lorelai finally got the happy ending they deserved, and it was perfect. \n  now   GirlsLauren GrahamScott Patterson About Us",

Because of it, the podcast dream team, aka your grandma’s favorite sitting pillow got to talk to the woman, the myth, the legend. Ms. Pam Grier, as she’s partnered up with the blackest streaming service there is so that we can all have blaxploitation for our consumption.\nThis episode starts with Ms. Grier saying Danielle’s name all cool and 70s-like and I immediately get jealous. It wasn’t my coolest moment, but we only have one the sexiest, baddest, women to beat the sh—\nMs. Patti-Patti: Shut yo mouth! \nJust talking about my ingrained jealousy over you and Ms. Grier’s connection.\nAnyway, I don’t waste anytime telling Pam Grier that I love her. Because, I do. She raised me just like most young men born in the 70s. Pam Grier is a part of the black family. Like plastic on the good couches, and that painting of a muscular hand reaching down to pull up another muscular hand, Ms. Grier was there through it all.\nTurns out, she was not on any of the Ohio Players album covers like I suspected as those album covers were also a part of Black American male DNA.\nMs. Grier is amazing. She has done and seen it all. So where is the baddest woman to every carry a gun in her afro now?\nA farm.\nFacts! (In my Bronx voice.)\nShe grew up on a farm shooting guns and basically being a pre-movie badass before venturing off to become a Hollywood badass.\nSomehow in all of this Danielle and Ms. Grier sing “Shotgun” and I get jealous for obvious reasons.\nI don’t want to spoil it for our listeners, but Ms. Grier and I are friends now and the conversation ends with Ms. Grier asking me out on a date and saying that I would be better as a solo podcaster because Patti La Danielle is dead-weight.\nDanielle: She never said any of this. \nShut yo mouth, you jive turkey!\n\nCheck out the episode below:\n\nListen and subscribe on iTunes .\nListen and subscribe on Soundcloud .\n",

      "text": "'Gilmore Girls' follows TV's nostalgia wave to Netflix Posted: Updated: Courtesy Netflix \n(CNN) -- Did anyone really need a \"Gilmore Girls\" revival? No more so than an updated \"Full House,\" which doesn't mean the practice isn't smart business-wise for Netflix -- not just tapping into nostalgia, but offering fans an excuse to revisit old episodes. \nEnter \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,\" four 90-minute installments -- length-wise the equivalent of about eight TV episodes -- served up as a bountiful Thanksgiving weekend binge. Series creator Amy Sherman-Palladino has reassembled practically the entire gang (with the sad absence of the late, great Edward Herrmann), plus some bonuses, kicking off with \"Winter\" and proceeding through the seasons. \nNetflix loaded up its screeners with detailed spoiler warnings, which seems silly given the contours of the exercise. All that really needs to be said -- not quite a decade after the show concluded its seven-year run -- is that 32-year-old Rory (Alexis Bledel) comes back to visit Stars Hollow, where she finds her mom Lorelai (Lauren Graham) as feisty and fast-talking as ever, along with a lot of other familiar faces. \nThose include Lorelai's mom (Kelly Bishop), still wrestling with the grief of her loss; and Luke (Scott Patterson), who in one of the amusing recurring gags keeps giving out wrong passwords for his diner's Wi-Fi access. \nThe four-season structure actually creates some problems. At 90 minutes, the story tends to meander, providing lots of time for rat-a-tat banter (and references to things that weren't on the radar when the show signed off, like \"Game of Thrones\") but moving the plot along at a snail's pace. \nSo while there's plenty of trademark whimsy, there are also indulgences like the musical number in the third episode, which is clever but drags on too long. \nThose pacing issues also apply to the closing chapter, which, without giving anything away, allowed Sherman-Palladino to craft an ending she was denied, having left before the show completed its network run. \nGranted, this tepid appraisal comes from someone who, unlike much of the critical community, wasn't gaga for \"Gilmore\" during its original incarnation. For the faithful, just seeing the cast re-inhabit these characters -- or savoring interludes like Lorelai and her mom awkwardly braving therapy sessions -- is probably reward enough. \nNetflix's pragmatism in bankrolling such revivals nevertheless contains a whiff of cynicism, inasmuch as it's so obviously designed to bolster the \"If you just watched\" part of its algorithm, while exploiting a media sphere that increasingly caters to the passions of small fan bases, in essence serving as its eager marketing partner. \nIt's hard to argue with the strategy, validated by the fact \"Gilmore Girls\" has been trending since the review embargo broke November 16. To borrow from a Carole King song, that's because the streaming service has recognized that even if something like \"Gilmore Girls\" isn't a showstopper, where it leads, we will follow. \n\"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life\" premieres November 25 on Netflix. \nBy Brian Lowry \nThe-CNN-Wire™&© 2016 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

      "text": "This is more than fan service. “Stay photogenic. I beg of you.” \nThe Netflix -funded revival of the beloved Gilmore Girls is great. If you loved the show back in its 2000-07 WB/CW run, caught up with it through ABC Family repeats, or through said streaming service, you’ll still love it. I did. My wife did. For better and worse Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life is the same as it ever was. \nThe theme of the familiar looms large over the course of the four 90-minute episodes. (Or movies, however you want to define it is up to you.) Nearly everyone you want to see is here, with the notable absence of Edward Herrmann, who passed away before the reunion. There are callbacks to decade-old jokes, and most importantly the show’s beating heart—creator Amy Sherman-Palladino—is back to play ringmaster. \nBut as the quote above implies, everything changes: Pictures and memories will always hold a magic that can’t be recaptured. That’s where this revival finds its dramatic thrust. The characters, and the show, wrestle with change and that struggle proves rewarding, even if everything doesn’t always click. Things can’t stay the same—and they shouldn’t. \nIn the second episode, Spring , Luke (Scott Patterson) and Lorelai (Lauren Graham) have a conversation about the merits of change versus keeping things the same that is so meta it would make Community blush. One of the ways the show pushes forward is by leaning into Lorelai and Rory (Alexis Bledel) becoming their respective mothers. Rory has broken free of her good-girl tendencies to be a nomadic woman looking for direction. Like Lorelai before her, Rory goes back to Stars Hollow to help get her life in order. This world-worn Rory has an edge that suits Bledel. \nHer story takes her to a few places that fans of the show never would’ve imagined back in the halcyon days. Lorelai’s journey has her taking on more of Emily’s (Kelly Bishop) tendencies than she would ever admit. But it’s there in Lorelai’s judgments of Rory, and more obviously mirrored in her constant firing of replacement chefs at the Dragonfly Inn. It’s funny that Luke recognizes the value of change, as he’s the character defined by his commitment to routine and reluctance to evolve. \nAs always Gilmore ’s strongest moments are between the girls and this is where the new season hits its highest points. Much of that drama revolves around the absence of family patriarch Richard (replacing Hermann's “Special appearance by” credit with “In memory of” is the biggest tearjerker moment of the whole six hours). Emily is wracked with grief, and leads to Emily and Lorelai in therapy, which is enough to justify the revival on its own. \nThe dynamic between Lorelai and Rory, the show’s signature element, doesn’t have the same finish-sentences effect as before, and they’ve settled into something more casual. There are still moments that feel like before (the opening scene panders in all the right ways), but the girls are more confrontational in their dynamic. \nIt’s great spending time with the potpourri of familiar faces. The sense of community the show worked so hard to establish pays off with an emotive curtain call. Kirk (Sean Gunn) is still works a different job every episode and even blesses us with “a second film by kirk,” which immediately goes into the pantheon of the show’s greatest bits. Miss Patty, Babette, Taylor, and Gypsy prove to be great points for the “change is dumb” argument. To no one’s surprise, Rory’s old boyfriends all reappear. Dean, Jess, and Logan are all in significantly better places than when we last crossed paths, so all the shippers won’t gain any new ammo to work with. (If you’re not down with Jess, then I don’t want to hear it.) \nWith every revival and reboot, hope springs eternal until the new thing is devoured by fans and fails to live up with unreachable expectations. There’s a reason high school reunions are spent reliving the past instead of focusing on the future. The reason for hope this time is the return of Sherman-Palladino, who was famously absent from the show’s final broadcast season, denying fans the ending she had planned, including the elusive final four words. By the time those words hit and we’ve seen another year in the life of the Gilmore girls, there’s genuine satisfaction to be had. \nThis project is more than fan service (shout out to Luke’s new diner rules, the town hall meetings); more than just a roll call of old characters and cameos (we see you Jackson, Digger (!), Rachael Ray (?), superfans the Gilmore Guys and Jason Mantzoukas). This is a trip down memory lane that builds on what came before it, and lays the groundwork for future (hopefully) trips.",

      "text": "There’s a key scene in the sumptuous new Netflix series The Crown in which the young Queen Elizabeth is talking to her grandmother, Queen Mary, about whether she should intervene in what could become a national crisis.\nThe bracingly strict Mary tells Elizabeth she must always be neutral, that she is not allowed the luxury of a point of view. She shouldn’t smile too much or approve too much or do too much. In fact, she must do nothing.\nTo do nothing is no job at all, worries the young queen.\nOn the contrary, Queen Mary tells her, it is the hardest job there is.\nThat rather stern paradox is the pivot on which this series turns. It might seem as if the queen, played with game determination by Claire Foy (Wolf Hall), is the main character — there are those publicity photos of her wearing that titular crown — but she’s not the dramatic centre. She isn’t supposed to be. She isn’t allowed to be.\nGroomed but not glamorous, highly visible but never exposed, she embodies public duty, not private drama. She is reliable, predictable, steadfast, always wearing that same shade of Windsor Rose lipstick, as the social and political currents of postwar Britain whirl around her.\nReportedly the most expensive series Netflix has undertaken, The Crown combines magnificent trappings with clipped dialogue and rigorously tamped-down emotion. Even in private — if you can talk about the notion of privacy in the cavernous, servant-strewn rooms of Buckingham Palace — the queen rarely lets go. In one crucial exchange with her wayward sister, Margaret, she allows herself to emote only by saying, \"Oh,\" a word she can stretch out to two, even three syllables in moments of extreme stress.\nSince Elizabeth is essentially an anti-drama queen, the supporting characters take up the slack. Prince Philip (played by Matt Smith, looking, as ever, like a very dapper Neanderthal) lounges about moodily or careens about town with a bunch of Hooray Henrys.\nHe is gung-ho about modernizing the monarchy, but somewhat dismayed by his very modern marriage, in which his life and career must defer to his wife’s job. Searching for something to do, he is intent on learning how to fly but requires official cabinet permission \"to do rolls and spins.\"\nPrincess Margaret (Vanessa Kirby), embarking on her doomed romance with group captain Peter Townsend, is already a bit of a tragic party girl, her future hinted at by gin bottles and a penchant for dark eyeliner.\nThen there’s the Duke of Windsor (Alex Jennings), whose affair with \"that woman,\" Wallis Simpson, brought about the abdication crisis in 1936. He comes off as a ghostly exile, condemned to wander through foreign pleasure spots in exquisite dove-grey suits, perpetually performing his Grand Romance.\nThe queen’s father, George VI (given a lovely poignancy by Jared Harris), is a deeply shy man who seems surprised to suddenly find himself \"anointed by God\" after his brother renounces the kingship. John Lithgow has a whale of a time as Winston Churchill, failing but still wily, bringing in rhetorical flourishes about \"the sprit of the blitz\" whenever his political fortunes are threatened.\nFinally, there is the Great British Public. In the early instalments of what is projected to be a multi-season series, they are still living through rationing and wearing woolen mittens indoors.\nWith all this going on around her, it sometimes seems as if Queen Elizabeth herself has been sidelined. Ultimately, though, her silences, her strict sublimation of her inner self to outer protocol, command our attention.\nFor all its grand historical trappings, The Crown is really about the burden of living not as a woman, but as a kind of allegorical symbol. The queen’s role, in the increasingly impossible institution of the so-called modern monarchy, is to be unchanging in a changing world. Her job, in fact, requires her to be a bit boring.\nOdd as it seems, that might be why this prickly, pomp-filled series is so interesting.\nalison.gillmor@freepress.mb.ca\nRead more by Alison Gillmor  ",

      "text": "What's on Netflix > Other > Is Season 1 and 2 of Blindspot on Netflix? Is Season 1 and 2 of Blindspot on Netflix? Tweet Blindspot / Copyright NBC \nBlindspot is one of NBC’s biggest shows of 2016, and it’s quickly become one of the most wanted shows to arrive on Netflix. NBC has a good working relationship with Netflix so let’s take a look as to what the chances are of Netflix getting season 1 of Blindspot in 2017 and beyond. \nThe show which holds a distinct steampunk vibe with a woman found in a bag on times square, wiped of her memory and holding many secrets in the form of tattoos. The series is a mixture of mystery, thriller and a dosage of your everyday crime drama too. \nBlindspot is streaming on some Netflix regions which includes Argentina, Brazil, Ecuador and Mexico. Most of these regions received the first season of Blindspot in October 2016 which is normally when NBC shows renew in other regions too. \nLet’s now take a look at some other regions and discover whether Netflix will be picking up Blindspot there. \nThe United States, where the show is produced and first aired, is a Netflix region that almost definitely looks like it won’t be getting the show. As of right now, NBC has decided to keep the show exclusively available on catch up through their website and apps and available on demand (both seasons 1 and 2) on Hulu Plus exclusively. This is no surprise given NBC’s stake in Hulu, but with deals like the one with The Blacklist, it’s a little disappointing that Netflix didn’t at least try and grab the show. \nIn the United Kingdom, Blindspot isn’t showing up on any streaming services so there’s a chance Netflix could grab it. \nAs for any timelines, Netflix usually renews all of their NBC content around September/October across all Netflix regions so if we are to get Blindspot, that’s when it’d likely happen.

      "text": "Nostalgia has swept through television and film in recent years, but our collective throwback obsession has been particularly fruitful at Netflix.\nIn addition to channeling past decades with Baz Luhrmann's hip-hop saga \"The Get Down\" and the '80s-era phenomenon that is \"Stranger Things,\" the streaming network has revamped animated kids' favorites such as \"Popples\" and \"Voltron\" and released a film adaptation of the beloved novel \"The Little Prince.\" \"Beat Bugs,\" another animated series, combines kid-friendly stories with songs by the Beatles. Netflix will release \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,\" a four-episode revival of the popular WB-turned-CW show \"Gilmore Girls,\" on Friday.\nOf course, Netflix isn't the first to evoke bygone eras - Nickelodeon was a pioneer of nostalgia programming, resurfacing popular teen shows such as \"All That\" and \"Clarissa Explains It All\" in 2011. But that was before the days of \"peak TV\" and before streaming (as opposed to, say, Netflix's early DVD mailers) became ubiquitous. At Netflix, nostalgia's reign is less about fitting in with pop culture trends than it is about the streaming network's ambitious plans for original content.\n\"We're looking, always, for the great stories,\" said Netflix chief content officer Ted Sarandos. \"We're not setting out to find nostalgic projects, but sometimes in the hunt for great stuff, somebody has a great take on something that is hugely familiar.\"\nAs reported by Variety and others, the streaming network announced recently that it is raising $1 billion through a new debt offering to fund more original content. In September, Netflix reiterated its focus on original series and films. Netflix planned to release about 600 hours of original programming in 2016. Next year, the network expects to release more than 1,000 hours of original content.\n\"Stranger Things\" wasn't a traditional reboot, but it paid homage to pop culture mainstays of the late '70s and '80s, including Ridley Scott's \"Alien,\" Rob Reiner's 1986 film \"Stand By Me\" and '80s film fare from Steven Spielberg , including \"E.T.\" Similarly, \"The Get Down\" added to the nostalgia craze with an extravagant but well-researched take on the early days of hip-hop in the Bronx.\nMOST READ ENTERTAINMENT NEWS THIS HOUR\n\"Stranger Things\" was a surprise summer hit, though Sarandos said the network \"definitely knew we had something special\" after watching the early cuts of the episodes. According to research released by Netflix in September, most people who became big enough fans to watch all 10 episodes of the sci-fi thriller did so after finishing the second installment.\nSarandos said \"Stranger Things\" is popular on a global scale, although that's difficult to quantify because Netflix doesn't share ratings information. Sarandos said the company knows viewing numbers \"with incredible granularity,\" but it doesn't consider viewership the best measure of success because it doesn't sell advertising. Instead, the company focuses on subscriber growth, which is on an upswing.\nAnecdotally, Sarandos points to the the immense social media following that \"Stranger Things\" and the members of its largely unknown cast earned after the premiere in August as evidence of the show's dedicated fan base. \"There's no question when something is working in America or anywhere else in the world because everyone is talking about it,\" Sarandos said.\nWhen it comes to more traditional reboots, Netflix has arguably been more discerning than other networks about which shows are revived. \"Full House\" and \"Gilmore Girls\" both have multigenerational fan bases (the result of longtime syndication and treasured DVD box sets) that make the idea of continuing those stories appealing.\nAnd Netflix isn't just remaking these series the way that, say, CBS did with its short-lived \"Rush Hour\" reboot - \"Fuller House\" and the \"Gilmore Girls\" miniseries are essentially sequels. (Not that the broadcast networks haven't succeeded, at times, with the remake format - \"MacGyver\" has done well on Friday night for CBS, \"Lethal Weapon\" has held its own in the ratings despite mixed reviews, and \"The Exorcist,\" which isn't a ratings hit, is surprisingly worth watching if you're a fan of the horror genre.)\nSarandos credits the easy availability of old movies and shows with enabling younger audiences to find familiar references in \"Stranger Things\" and \"The Get Down.\" \"It's all in the rich details that you think would be completely lost on the young audience,\" he said, using the rotary phones in \"Stranger Things\" as an example.\n\"My 20-year-old son never said 'What's that?' because he's so used to seeing it (on) film and television,\" Sarandos said. \"It's almost like life and art just happen on a constant continuum now and are played out through television.\"\nRELATED STORIES:\n'Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life' review: Overstuffed, but warm and reassuring\nFive reasons the 'Gilmore Girls' revival needed Melissa McCarthy\n'Stranger Things' pulls Ravenswood actor into its orbit\nWinona Ryder is great in 'Stranger Things,' but don't ask if this is her big comeback\nEarth tones, rotary phones and Winona Ryder: Netflix's 'Stranger Things' is totally '80s\nCheck out the latest movie reviews from Michael Phillips and the Chicago Tribune.\nCheck out reviews for all new music releases from Tribune music critic Greg Kot.\n Steven Spielberg",

      "text": "TWEET For most pop culture savants who are also Netflix subscribers, Nov. 25 is a special day, considering it's when we'll be treated to the highly anticipated return of G ilmore Girls . The revival series is an ideal post-Thanksgiving binge-watch for fans who want to be swept away to Stars Hollow and forget about all the horrible things that are happening in the real world. But if you want something more on the nose, you might want to try 3%. The first Netflix original to be named after a percentage point (it's pretty weird), the series has an interesting post-apocalyptic premise: Only 3% of the Earth's population is allowed to go to the \"better side\" of the world, known as the Offshore. The remaining people will live in unsparing poverty. It appears teenagers are given equal opportunity to make it to the Offshore, but must face a grueling set of obstacles to get there. It looks like an entertaining mix of Battle Royale and City of God , the latter of which makes sense considering 3% is also set in Brazil (and thus, is in Portuguese). When can Netflix users check it out? Source: Netflix US & Canada/YouTube Like Gilmore Girls, 3% arrives on Friday, and probably the earliest you'd be able to watch the series is 3 a.m. Eastern. This is based on the previous release times for other Netflix series, like The Crown and Orange Is the New Black , and this appears to be so Netflix users on the West Coast can start their binge at midnight. That means East Coast watchers who are seriously anxious to check out 3% can stay up until 3 a.m. to watch the show. Or, if you're stuffed full of turkey and pass out beforehand, it'll be waiting for you in the morning. How do you watch it? You go on Netflix if you're already a subscriber and press play — you can do this, you're smart — which can also work when hooked to the TV or Netflix's mobile app. Or, if you're not yet a Netflix user, you can sign up and get the first month free. It's not hard. Seriously, things could be worse: You could be forced to fight other reasonably handsome teenagers in post-apocalyptic Brazil to live in a shiny utopia. ",

      "text": "Warning: This post contains discussion of the famous “last four words” of Netflix’s Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life . Do NOT read on if you don’t want to know what they are. And we repeat: Do NOT read on if you don’t want to know what they are.\nThis is your last chance to hit the nearest exit! OK, we warned ya!\n“Mom?”\n“Yeah?”\n“I’m pregnant.”\nVIDEOS Lauren Graham Reacts to Final 4 Gilmore Girls Words: ‘It’s Like in a Horror Movie When… ‘\nWith those four little words, Gilmore Girls got turned on its ear — and the mother-daughter duo of Lorelai and Rory Gilmore came full-circle. (FYI: Our recaps of “ Winter ,” “ Spring ,” “ Summer ,” and “ Fall ” are now live.)\nSitting in the iconic Stars Hollow gazebo in the final moments of “Fall,” the two drank Champagne and talked about growing old together. Lorelai teased Rory for being in love with Pee-Wee Herman as a kid, and Rory got a break-up text from her forgettable boyfriend Paul. (“Who?”) But Rory seemed distracted, and Lorelai asked, “What’s going on in there?” Rory said wistfully, “I want to remember it all. Every detail.” Then she dropped the P-bomb on her unsuspecting mother. We saw Lorelai’s shocked face, then… Bam! Credits.\nPHOTOS Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life : Ausiello’s 10 Favorite Moments Ranked\nCreator Amy Sherman-Palladino has teased us for years that the ending she dreamed up for Gilmore Girls (before she left the show prior to its final CW season) consisted of four words of dialogue. And fans have furiously speculated for nearly a decade about what those words could possibly be. But in retrospect… it’s kind of obvious, isn’t it?\nGilmore Girls Review More Of course the final four words would be between Lorelai and Rory — the core relationship that the entire series was built around. And of course it makes sense that, since the show began with a 32-year-old Lorelai and her 16-year-old daughter Rory, it would end with a now 32-year-old Rory having a child of her own, continuing the circle of life. (And making Emily a great-grandmother!)\nWe are still left with a few lingering questions: Like, who’s the father? (It’s easy to assume Logan, but they broke up at the end of “Summer”… and Jess was staring pretty longingly at Rory through the window at the end there.) And does this mean Rory will quit jet-setting and settle down in Stars Hollow, where her kid can nibble on waffles at Luke’s Diner and annoy Michel at the Dragonfly?\nRELATED Michael Ausiello’s Review: The Gilmore Girls Revival Is Everything I Wanted It to Be (and So Much More)\nAll in all, though, the last four words were a lovely summation of Lorelai and Rory’s unbreakable bond — and a tantalizing hint of all the stories still left to tell.\nBut what did you think of the last four words? Vote in the poll below, then hit the comments to share your thoughts.

REUTERS/Mike Blake \nOnline streaming giant Netflix has a new collection of movie offerings every month, but December always seems to be a bit more special compared to the other months, and this year is no exception. The most notable high-profile showcase for next month is Marvel's \"Captain America: Civil War,\" but it's not the only one worth watching on the streaming service. \nPer IGN , the other notable films for next month include \"The Rock,\" \"Honey, I Shrunk the Kids,\" \"Hannibal,\" and \"The Angry Birds Movie.\" Aside from those mentioned, there also is a full lineup of Netflix originals, including the season 2 of \"Fuller House,\" \"White Rabbit Project,\" \"Spectral,\" and \"Pacific Heat,\" among others. \n\"Captain America: Civil War\" needs no refresh since it was released earlier this year, so might as well talk about the next best things for next month. The 1996 American action thriller film \"The Rock\" stars Nicolas Cage, Sean Connery, and Ed Harris in the lead roles. The movie is about an unlikely partnership between a chemist from the FBI and a prisoner/former Special Air Service operative against a group of rogue government troops blackmailing the government to paying $100 million for them not to release missiles which contain VX gas from the prison island of Alcatraz. Sponsored Watch Your Favorite Christian Films, 24/7. Click Here To Start Your Free Trial Today \n\"Honey, I Shrunk the Kids\" and \"The Angry Birds Movie\" are obviously Netflix's offerings directed for young audiences. The former is a 1989 comedy/science fiction family film about a scientist who invents a ray gun that can shrink objects, only to accidentally use it on his kids, in turn shrinking them. The latter, on the other hand, is the film adaptation of the massively popular mobile game from Rovio, \"Angry Birds.\" \nTo learn more about Netflix's lineup of films and shows for the upcoming holiday season, simply visit the official website .

Clockwise from top left: The youngsters of \"Stranger Things\"; the Beatles-singing \"Beat Bugs\"; Rory and Lorelei Gilmore in \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life\"; and a scene from \"Voltron: Legendary Defender.\" Is Netflix doing nostalgia better than anyone else right now? Bethonie Butler The Washington Post Nov 22, 2016 Buy Now Netflix \nNostalgia in four ways. Clockwise from top left: The youngsters of \"Stranger Things\"; the Beatles-singing \"Beat Bugs\"; Rory and Lorelei Gilmore in \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life\"; and a scene from \"Voltron: Legendary Defender.\" Nostalgia has swept through television and film in recent years, but our collective throwback obsession has been particularly fruitful at Netflix. \nIn addition to channeling past decades with Baz Luhrmann's hip-hop saga \"The Get Down\" and the '80s-era phenomenon that is \"Stranger Things,\" the streaming network has revamped animated kids' favorites such as \"Popples\" and \"Voltron\" and released a film adaptation of the beloved novel \"The Little Prince.\" \"Beat Bugs,\" another animated series, combines kid-friendly stories with songs by the Beatles. Netflix will release \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,\" a four-episode revival of the popular WB-turned-CW show \"Gilmore Girls,\" on Friday. \nOf course, Netflix isn't the first to evoke bygone eras — Nickelodeon was a pioneer of nostalgia programming, resurfacing popular teen shows such as \"All That\" and \"Clarissa Explains It All\" in 2011. But that was before the days of \"peak TV\" and before streaming (as opposed to, say, Netflix's early DVD mailers) became ubiquitous. At Netflix, nostalgia's reign is less about fitting in with pop culture trends than it is about the streaming network's ambitious plans for original content. \n\"We're looking, always, for the great stories,\" said Netflix chief content officer Ted Sarandos. \"We're not setting out to find nostalgic projects, but sometimes in the hunt for great stuff, somebody has a great take on something that is hugely familiar.\" \nAs reported by Variety and others, the streaming network announced recently that it is raising $1 billion through a new debt offering to fund more original content. In September, Netflix reiterated its focus on original series and films. Netflix planned to release about 600 hours of original programming in 2016. Next year, the network expects to release more than 1,000 hours of original content. \n\"Stranger Things\" wasn't a traditional reboot, but it paid homage to pop culture mainstays of the late '70s and '80s, including Ridley Scott's \"Alien,\" Rob Reiner's 1986 film \"Stand By Me\" and '80s film fare from Steven Spielberg, including \"E.T.\" Similarly, \"The Get Down\" added to the nostalgia craze with an extravagant but well-researched take on the early days of hip-hop in the Bronx. \n\"Stranger Things\" was a surprise summer hit, though Sarandos said the network \"definitely knew we had something special\" after watching the early cuts of the episodes. According to research released by Netflix in September, most people who became big enough fans to watch all 10 episodes of the sci-fi thriller did so after finishing the second installment. \nSarandos said \"Stranger Things\" is popular on a global scale, although that's difficult to quantify because Netflix doesn't share ratings information. Sarandos said the company knows viewing numbers \"with incredible granularity,\" but it doesn't consider viewership the best measure of success because it doesn't sell advertising. Instead, the company focuses on subscriber growth, which is on an upswing. \nAnecdotally, Sarandos points to the the immense social media following that \"Stranger Things\" and the members of its largely unknown cast earned after the premiere in August as evidence of the show's dedicated fan base. \"There's no question when something is working in America or anywhere else in the world because everyone is talking about it,\" Sarandos said. \nWhen it comes to more traditional reboots, Netflix has arguably been more discerning than other networks about which shows are revived. \"Full House\" and \"Gilmore Girls\" both have multigenerational fan bases (the result of longtime syndication and treasured DVD box sets) that make the idea of continuing those stories appealing. \nAnd Netflix isn't just remaking these series the way that, say, CBS did with its short-lived \"Rush Hour\" reboot — \"Fuller House\" and the \"Gilmore Girls\" miniseries are essentially sequels. (Not that the broadcast networks haven't succeeded, at times, with the remake format — \"MacGyver\" has done well on Friday night for CBS, \"Lethal Weapon\" has held its own in the ratings despite mixed reviews, and \"The Exorcist,\" which isn't a ratings hit, is surprisingly worth watching if you're a fan of the horror genre.) \nSarandos credits the easy availability of old movies and shows with enabling younger audiences to find familiar references in \"Stranger Things\" and \"The Get Down.\" \"It's all in the rich details that you think would be completely lost on the young audience,\" he said, using the rotary phones in \"Stranger Things\" as an example. \n\"My 20-year-old son never said 'What's that?' because he's so used to seeing it (on) film and television,\" Sarandos said. \"It's almost like life and art just happen on a constant continuum now and are played out through television.\"",
