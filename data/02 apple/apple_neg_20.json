      "text": "  \n(REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson) Apple's iPhone 7 displayed \nThough it has only been several weeks since the release of the highly regarded iPhone 7, many are already curious about what Apple's next installment could bring. \nAfter the changes presented during the release of Apple's iPhone 7, reports have been speculating on what the iPhone 8 could bring. According to supply chain analyst firm KGI Securities, the big technology company will reveal three new models for the iPhone 8. \nReports state that one of the variants for the iPhone 8 will utilize an OLED display. Meanwhile, the rest of the models will retain the TFT-LCD technology that has been used in the most recent versions of the iPhone. \nIn addition, the dual camera presented on the iPhone 7 Plus will be included in two of the variants, which are the possible 5.5-inch iPhone with LCD Display as well as the 5.5-inch iPhone with OLED display. The 4.7-inch iPhone with LCD display will only have a single camera. Advertisement \nAs for the aesthetics, it was rumored that the iPhone 8 will boast an all-glass design, something that was last presented on the iPhone 4 and iPhone 4s. This is expected to complement the jet black casing used on the iPhone 7. However, this could pose some disadvantages as well as it is most likely to get cracked. \nAside from that, the upcoming model is said to take away the home button. Instead, the phone could include a finger scanner on the screen itself, which will make the device more functional. \nAlso, experts believe that the new device will no longer include the audio jack. This was removed on the iPhone 7 in order to usher in new sets of headphones that could be connected via the lightning cable. The feature was removed for the first time on the iPhone 7 which is why it is believed that this will still be the case for Apple's future devices. \nWith that, there is a lot of anticipation for the release of Apple's iPhone 8. Fans will have to wait for more news on the matter.  ",

      "title": "Apple invention integrates Siri into iMessage, aids in peer-to-peer financial transactions",
      "text": "Apple invention integrates Siri into iMessage, aids in peer-to-peer financial transactions By Wednesday, November 16, 2016, 11:59 pm PT (02:59 am ET) An Apple patent application published Thursday suggests the company is investigating the potential of integrating its Siri virtual assistant into Messages, with claims suggesting the feature might assist users with peer-to-peer payments. As published by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, Apple's application for a \" Virtual assistant in a communication session \" grants iMessage users inline chat access to artificial intelligence software like Siri. In Messages, Siri would be able to automatically decipher incoming requests and complete tasks like scheduling appointments, providing navigation directions and retrieving movie times, among other functions. In some embodiments, the implementation is similar to Google's incorporation of Google Assistant in the recently released Allo app . In particular, Apple's document notes users in chat sessions with two or more people can instantly access Siri by simply directing a message to the AI. Using semantic analysis, the AI module detects that a user is invoking Siri and not another user. The message is parsed to suss out a potential task, which is subsequently carried out, if possible. Though detected messages are not displayed in the public chat feed, Siri is able to tap into data from iMessage participants to complete tasks. For example, a first user might enter, \"Siri, help us schedule a meeting,\" into the chat window to schedule an in-person meeting with other members of the Messages session. The assistant detects the message and classifies it a task, cross-references open calendar dates from all chat participants and suggests an appropriate meeting date and time. In some embodiments, members of a chat will be notified that a user is utilizing a virtual assistant. Those who are not also using Siri can choose whether they, too, would like to activate AI functionality. Further, Messages participants are also able to approve or deny AI accesses to personal data during the communications session. Other examples show Siri pulling data directly from an ongoing chat session. In one case, Siri is asked to schedule dinner for participants in an iMessage conversation. The assistant —with permission from chat members —accesses GPS data from each member and offers a selection of nearby restaurants as an in-chat poll. Participants then vote for a preferred time and place, and Siri schedules the reservation and adds the appointment to their respective calendars.. Interestingly, Apple's document makes specific mention of potential peer-to-peer payment functionality, In particular, the invention suggests an in-app virtual assistant can be used to facilitate financial transactions by determining which financial apps are available or utilized by each chat member. A safe choice for Apple would be to restrict payments Apple Pay, though the filing appears to allow for third-party service integration. In-app access to virtual assistant software is not a new idea —companies like Slack have been doing it for some time. Apple arguably popularized AI assistants with Siri, but the company's ongoing quest for data privacy precluded most third-party apps from integrating services, thereby limiting its utility. It was only with the launch of iOS 10 in September that developers were granted access to Siri APIs. As it applies to today's patent application, certain financial firms like PayPal already integrate Siri functionality, but are limited to Siri's dedicated software module. Given Siri's quickly expanding ecosystem, it is plausible Apple might one day soon integrate a variant of the assistant into Messages and perhaps other apps. Siri has been able to process typed commands for over two years, suggesting a jump to a text-based app like Messages would be a relatively straightforward transition. Apple's patent application covering Siri integration for iMessage was first filed for in May 2015 and credits Mehul K. Sanghavi and Jeffrey P. Schwerdtfeger as its inventors. Topics:",

      "title": "HP’s Z2 Mini wants to kill the Mac mini",
      "text": "There was no shortage of Apple fans who were disappointed with the lack of Mac mini love at the company’s October event , and while nothing will make the wait for an update to the pint-sized aluminum beast any less excruciating, HP is hoping it can tempt you with a “mini” of its own.\nThe Z2 Mini is a Intel-powered mini PC built for professionals working with demanding 3D applications, but who apparently don’t have very much desk space. At 8.5 inches wide and 2.3 inches tall, it’s still a big larger than the 7.7-inch by 1.4-inch Mac mini, but not by much.\nDON’T MISS: Here’s a new gallery of images from the $300 Apple book people can’t stop talking about\nView photos\nThe default configuration comes with an Intel i3-6100 and Intel’s integrated graphics, but the Z2 can made a great deal more powerful than that, with an optional 3.5GHz Intel Xeon processor and discrete graphics courtesy of the Nvidia Quadro M620. Support for up to 32GB of memory and a maximum storage capacity of 1.5TB round out the specs sheet.\nHP boasts that the Z2 is certified to run “over 20 professional software applications” such as AutoCAD, MicroStation, and Vectorworks, thanks to 368,000 hours of testing. And if you’re a port snob, you’ll be happy to see a total of six USB ports on the front and back of the small chassis, with four USB 3.0 and a pair of USB-C connections.\nView photos\nThe Z2 comes with Windows 10 Pro preinstalled, but you can also roll the OS back to Windows 7 Pro if that’s more your style. There’s also support for HP Linux, Red Hat, and SUSE built in.\nOn the pricing front, HP is starting the Z2 at a fairly reasonable $699, which will score you the base configuration. If you’re looking for the top-of-the-line Z2, HP isn’t quite ready to share that figure, so you’ll have to save your pennies and hope the number isn’t too insane when the computer debuts in December.\nTrending right now:\nWalmart will give you a chance to buy the NES Classic every day this week Sam’s Club full Black Friday 2016 ad leaked: Here are the best deals Best Buy just released an updated Black Friday ad: Here’s what’s new See the original version of this article on BGR.com",

      "text": "This coming January, Donald Trump will be sworn in as the 45th President of the United States. In turn, many have started to wonder if Trump will actually take steps to put into motion many of the grandiose promises he made during his election campaign. One of the more curious promises Trump made was that he, if elected President, would make sure Apple “builds their damn computers in this country.”\nTrump’s promise, which obviously fits in nicely under his pledge to ‘make America great again’, was immediately met with skepticism by everyone who understands the logistics involved in manufacturing consumer electronics. Indeed, it’s hardly a coincidence that nearly all major hardware companies in the United States outsource their manufacturing to factories in China.\nDON’T MISS: Walmart’s pre-Black Friday sale starts right now – here are the best deals so far\nWith respect to Apple in particular, Trump said that he’d like the California-based company to begin manufacturing a multitude of devices in the United States.\nTrump’s remarks on the matter read as follows: “We have such amazing people in this country: smart, sharp, energetic, they’re amazing. I was saying ‘make America great again’, and I actually think we can say now, and I really believe this, we’re gonna get things coming. We’re gonna get Apple to start building their damn computers and things in this country, instead of in other countries.”\nIf Trump’s remarks were said in earnest, the new President-elect will be in for a rude awakening once he officially takes office. As laid out in a recent article in The Wall Street Journal , there’s no getting around the fact that the Asian supply chain that many companies like Apple rely on simply can’t be replicated here in the United States.\nThe reality is that companies like Apple have incredibly stringent manufacturing needs that can only be met by factories in China, many of which were designed from the ground-up to accommodate the needs of large-scale consumer electronics companies.\nTo this point, the Journal highlights the following story involving Apple supplier Jabil.\nWhen Jabil Circuit Inc., the world’s third-largest contract manufacturer by revenue, needed to quickly ramp up production of its electronics components a few years ago, the company was able to add 35,000 workers in China in less than six weeks.\n“In no other country can you scale up so quickly,” said John Dulchinos, vice president of digital manufacturing at Jabil, a St. Petersburg, Fla., supplier to companies such as Apple Inc. and Electrolux SA. “You have the ability to move quickly and there’s a really strong electronics supply chain in Asia centered around China.”\nThe idea of relocating specialized Chinese factories to the United States and hiring thousands upon thousands or workers with the requisite skills to operate them is essentially a practical impossibility at this point.\nIn a similar example which highlights how efficient Chinese factories are, the New York Times a few years ago relayed a story about how Apple needed a last-minute manufacturing change implemented on the iPhone production line.\nOne former executive described how the company relied upon a Chinese factory to revamp iPhone manufacturing just weeks before the device was due on shelves. Apple had redesigned the iPhone’s screen at the last minute, forcing an assembly line overhaul. New screens began arriving at the plant near midnight.\nA foreman immediately roused 8,000 workers inside the company’s dormitories, according to the executive. Each employee was given a biscuit and a cup of tea, guided to a workstation and within half an hour started a 12-hour shift fitting glass screens into beveled frames. Within 96 hours, the plant was producing over 10,000 iPhones a day.\nEven we if ignore the fact that Trump’s plan, if put into practice somehow, would raise the price of the iPhone considerably, there’s no getting around the fact that Chinese factories are unique insofar as they offer Apple the flexibility it needs along with the unrivaled ability to ramp up production aggressively or quickly scale production down as demand warrants.\n“The entire supply chain is in China now,” a former Apple executive told the Times on the topic. “You need a thousand rubber gaskets? That’s the factory next door. You need a million screws? That factory is a block away. You need that screw made a little bit different? It will take three hours.”\nTim Cook even addressed Apple’s manufacturing partners in China during a 60 Minutes interview last year.\n“China put an enormous focus on manufacturing,” Cook explained. “The U.S., over time, began to stop having as many vocational kind of skills. I mean, you can take every tool and die maker in the United States and probably put them in a room that we’re currently sitting in. In China, you would have to have multiple football fields.”\nTrending right now:\nWalmart will give you a chance to buy the NES Classic every day this week Best Buy just released an updated Black Friday ad: Here’s what’s new Sam’s Club full Black Friday 2016 ad leaked: Here are the best deals See the original version of this article on BGR.com",

      "title": "Apple Faces a Tough Chinese Consumer Agency Over iPhone Battery Fail",
      "text": "After numerous reports in China of iPhones shutting off unexpectedly with ample battery power remaining, Apple faces a Chinese regulator that has forced two other foreign companies into recalls since the summer. \nThe China Consumers Association is a Beijing regulator lobbying on behalf of consumer rights and dispute resolution. It recently noticed a rare flood of complaints on Chinese social media about Apple products shutting down because of cooler temperatures despite having 50% battery remaining. \n\"In view that Apple iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s series cellphones in China have a considerable number of users, and the number of people who've reported this problem is rather many, China Consumer Association has already made a query with Apple,\" the CCA said in an open letter on Tuesday. The CCA said Apple should investigate the reported problems. \nApple responded today, telling the state-run ThePaper.cn news site that it was working to help a small number of consumers and said it was in contact with government agencies--presumably the CCA--to assist customers. \nBut by stopping short of promising replacements, Apple may face more pressure in China. The CCA has earned a reputation for coercing foreign companies into recalls in the country. \n \nIt began this summer when Ikea recalled 36 million dressers in North America that had displayed a propensity to fall on top of children if not bolted to the wall. Ikea did not extend the recall to China, which inflamed state media, who said the company treated China with a double standard. But after conferencing with the CCA and China’s General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine (AQSIQ), Ikea quickly extended the recall to 1.7 million Chinese dressers. The CCA and AQSIQ hurried to react to public sentiment turning against Ikea . \nThe pattern repeated itself in September. Samsung initially resisted extending its recall of exploding Galaxy Note 7 smartphones in China. It explained that the Chinese-sold phones used different batteries from those around the world, even as several cases of exploding batteries were fluttering around Chinese social media. A CCA deputy secretary said China had always opposed double standards and Samsung was ignoring the safety of Chinese consumers. Samsung later included China in its full recall as Chinese social media users turned against Samsung ssnlf . \nApple's situation today in China isn't the same. Apple hasn't recalled iPhones elsewhere for faulty batteries, and the problem appears minor and not related to safety. But the tide could turn against Apple if enough consumers complain that the iPhone’s steep price in China isn’t commensurate with quality. \nThe China Consumers Association has built its reputation on fighting perceived double standards in China, and on calling out foreign companies for not respecting their Chinese consumers. Apple could be another target. ",

      "text": "FAIRFAX, CA – DECEMBER 13: The Google Maps app is seen on an Apple iPhone 4S on December 13, 2012 in Fairfax, California. Three months after Apple removed the popular Google Maps from its operating system to replace it with its own mapping software, a Google Maps app has been added to the iTunes store. Apple Maps were widely panned in tech reviews and among customers, the fallout resulting in the dismissal of the top executive in charge of Apple’s mobile operating system. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)\nThanksgiving is upon us. Whether you’re planning a trip outside the city or a staycation in town, there’s one concern we all likely have: traffic. The Google Maps team recently took a look a historic data from Thanksgiving weekend to determine the best and worst times to travel, as well as where in the city you’re likely to see a lot of San Francisco residents spending the holiday.\nWhen it comes to traffic, the best day for you to leave is the Sunday before Thanksgiving, preferably before 6 a.m. If that’s too early for you, then try to get out of the house before 3 p.m. when traffic picks back up again for the evening. For those of us that have to work Monday and Tuesday, traffic will be a bit heavier than it is typically on those days. If you can head out of town then, aim to travel midday when traffic is at its lightest.\nNo surprise, the worst day to leave town is the day before Thanksgiving (Wednesday). If you leave then, you should try to hit the road at 7 a.m., when traffic will be 45 percent lighter than normal. Try to avoid driving around 3 p.m. when folks will start heading home from work.\nWhen it comes to return times, the best time to come back is the day after Thanksgiving. The worst is the Saturday after the holiday.\nThanksgiving Day, top stops in the Bay include the botanical gardens, Vista Point and electronics stores. The same places remain popular on Black Friday and the week leading up to the big day. The only big difference in searches comes the day before Thanksgiving, when there’s an uptick in search for wine stores, bus charters, and bakeries.",

      "text": "Appointment brings entrepreneurial and Fortune 500 experience from Apple, SGI, and Dolby toward developing a comprehensive brand and sales strategy within 3D manufacturing marketplace.\nSan Leandro, CA.\nType A Machines, the industry leader in delivering real world 3D manufacturing solutions, today announced the addition of tech industry veteran Shawn Hopwood as Chief Marketing Officer and Vice President of Sales. Mr. Hopwood will oversee marketing and sales strategy across the company. Mr. Hopwood is founder and former CMO at ClikPop, a pioneering brand management agency serving hyper-growth companies within the Silicon Valley community. Prior experience includes leadership positions at Apple, SGI, and Dolby.\n\"As we continue our journey to becoming a world-class technology organization, it’s critical for us to deliver a clear, articulate message around our “Factory of the Future” vision, a forward-looking initiative disrupting conventional manufacturing,\" said Andrew Rutter, CEO & CTO, Type A Machines. \"Shawn’s entrepreneurial and Fortune 500 experiences bringing advanced technologies to market makes him ideally suited for directing a comprehensive marketing and sales strategy to position Type A Machines as a preferred brand in the Additive Manufacturing industry.\"\n\"Type A Machine’s ambitious vision and industry leading products will be the cornerstones of the future of 3D manufacturing,\" said Type A Machines’ new Chief Marketing Officer, Shawn Hopwood. “We’re at the starting point of an amazing new age of digital fabrication, and I feel privileged to have the opportunity to join the Type A Machines team to turn vision into reality.”\nHopwood’s history in the 3D graphics industry goes back to 1985 when he founded the first graphics- and CAD-focused Macintosh magazine. He later launched the first parametric-based 3D modeling software for Pixar’s rendering platform, served as Apple’s first 3D Graphics Evangelist, and led SGI’s industry-wide adoption of OpenGL, including negotiating a license directly with Apple’s Steve Jobs. Mr. Hopwood was instrumental in bringing to market Health Buddy, the first Internet Healthcare appliance, and in driving the adoption of Coding Technologies' audio successor to MP3. The company was later acquired by Dolby where Mr. Hopwood served as Director of Internet Technologies.\nMr. Hopwood joins Apple alums Tim Holmes and Mitch Huitema, who serve as Type A Machines’ Chief Strategy Officer and Board Member respectively.\nAbout Type A Machines\nType A Machines is leading the 3D manufacturing revolution with the first, and only scalable 3D fabrication system. Building on their established Series 1 3D printers , the company’s Print Pod delivers parallel production at lower cost-per-part than injection molding, backed by the services manufacturing demands.

      "text": "Apple Might Not Have Enough OLEDs For 2017’s iPhone By Tyler Lee on 11/17/2016 01:44 PST \nIf you were hoping to see OLED iPhones in 2017, you might be disappointed. The rumors are saying that OLED iPhones will be released in 2017 , but apparently there could be supply constraints. A report from Bloomberg revealed that Apple’s OLED suppliers might not be able to meet the demand, and that these constraints are expected to last until 2018. \nIf you might recall, a few days ago we reported that Apple was rumored to launch 3 versions of the iPhone. We would have the standard 4.7-inch model, a 5.5-inch Plus model, and another Plus model that would have a 5.5-inch OLED display. The report from Bloomberg seems to corroborate those claims, suggesting that Apple will either be forced to launch one iPhone with an OLED display, or push back the adoption of the technology to 2018 where all their iPhone models will be outfitted with the display. \nBoth have their downsides, with the former creating fragmentation amongst iPhone users, while the latter means that we’ll have one more year of a “boring” iPhone, which obviously won’t be doing the declining iPhone sales any favors, nor will it sit well with Apple’s investors. However this is largely out of Apple’s hands as OLED screens are said to be harder to manufacture, thus for suppliers to be able to meet the demand not just in terms of numbers but quality will be hard. \nEither way we guess we’ll have to wait until 2017 to find out how Apple plans on dealing with this, so until then take it with a grain of salt, and maybe don’t get your hopes up too high just yet. \nFiled in Apple > Cellphones > Rumors .

      "text": "Apple's four main OLED suppliers won't be able to meet the production capacity necessary to match demand for the 2017 iPhone, according to a new report from Bloomberg. Supply constraints are expected to last until 2018.\n\nOLED screens are more difficult to produce in mass quantities than LCD screens, which means Apple is \"at the mercy\" of suppliers who are willing to produce them in the necessary quantities. Bloomberg notes that the supply constraints may force Apple to either restrict OLED use to one version of the next iPhone or push adoption of the technology back.\n\nWhile Apple and Samsung have an exclusive OLED deal for 2017, it doesn't guarantee that the company will be able to meet Apple's demand. For example, Samsung's OLED supplies have already been constrained due to its own smartphones, like the Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge.\n\nApple's OLED screen order is for displays larger than 5 inches, according to Bloomberg. The Cupertino company has ordered an initial round of 100 million units over the next year, but Samsung will only be able to provide a portion of that for the Holliday 2017 quarter. Apple may face troubles if Samsung can't meet its demand.If Samsung sees supply constraints in its ramp up of OLED panels for the fall 2017 iPhone launch, Apple may not have another major provider to fall back on. That’s why Apple usually has multiple suppliers for key components. For example, it has sourced LCD panels from all of the major Asia-based display makers. For next year, at least, it appears that OLED supply chain may be a single-company affair.\n\nOn Tuesday, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said that he believes Apple will launch an all-new OLED iPhone alongside 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch LCD iPhones. While all three iPhones are likely to sport a new design with a glass back, the new OLED iPhone will have a curved edge-to-edge display. Kuo previously said the OLED iPhone would sport a 5.8-inch display with a bezel-free design.Related Roundup: iPhone 8 (2017)\nTags: bloomberg.com, OLED\n\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

      "text": "Apple reportedly plans to cut App Store video fees CNET 9 mins ago Steven Musil © Provided by CNET Apple reportedly plans to cut App Store video fees Apple is planning to cut in half the amount it charges to sell video services over the App Store, a move seen as assuaging concerns of its partners, Bloomberg reported Wednesday.\nThe tech titan plans to reduce the amount of revenue it collects from subscription video streaming apps from the current 30 percent to 15 percent, Bloomberg reported, citing unidentified people familiar with the company's plans. Apple takes a 30 percent cut of sales for app subscriptions, but if an app maker holds onto a subscriber for a year or longer, Apple's cut will shrink to 15 percent.\nThe concession could go a long way toward soothing the feelings of partners, who have long accused Apple of using the App Store as a means for stifling rival services. The move also underscores the growing importance video is playing to Apple, which next month will launch a new TV app that showcases TV shows and movies from apps that a customer subscribes to.\nApple representatives did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nGo to MSN Home",

      "text": "Text We've inexplicably fumbled our phones into toilet basins enough times to understand why Apple made waterproof technology a priority with the iPhone 7. But did you know that the far majority of Japanese mobiles have been waterproof for over a decade already? And you probably put that down to the fact that the Japanese are just technologically superior to us in every single way – but the real reason is a lot weirder. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Smartphones became popular in Japan years before they arrived on our shores – and they become such a cultural phenomenon that, according to Mashable , Japanese people couldn't help but take them into the shower. According to Fujitsu, which covers 20% of the Japanese smartphone market: \"The mobile phone is with us 24 hours a day. It accompanies us to the bathroom, to the shower, or under the rain. So it is a necessity for the phone to be robust,\" said a senior vice president of the company.\" The result is that nearly 95 percent of phones in Japan are now waterproof – meaning that they are sealed, and not made to be tinkered with. \"In Japan, being waterproof is far more important than being able to remove your phone's battery,\" said Ken Hong, LG's global communications director. And you thought you were addicted to your phone. ",

      "text": "Apple Might Reduce Their Cut Of App Store Video Subscription Revenue  51 PST \nThere are rumors that Apple apparently wants to get into the video business. So far Apple TV has been the company’s efforts but from what we hear, that’s not their full vision. Apparently Apple has huge plans to offer up original programming , essentially turning themselves into platforms like Netflix, Hulu, and so on. \nUnfortunately Apple isn’t quite there yet. We’re not sure what’s with the hold up, but could money be a reason? We suppose it is possible because according to a report from Bloomberg , Apple is apparently thinking about reducing their cut from video subscription revenue from the app store, reducing it from 30% to about 15%. \nAccording to the report, it seems that some of Apple’s video partners have been pretty frustrated with the 30% cut that Apple takes. This isn’t just an issue with video partners, but other apps that rely on in-app purchases. This is why Amazon does not sell ebooks within its Kindle app on iOS, and also why Spotify had at one point in time encouraged customers to buy a subscription from their website directly instead of through the iTunes App Store. \nSo will the cutting of revenue Apple gets from videos be enough to convince content creators to join up with the Cupertino company? We guess only time will tell, but in the meantime it looks like Apple’s competitors will be getting a very long head start. \nFiled in Apple > Rumors . Read more about iOS . Related Articles",

      "text": "  06:00 AM EST Apple's Newer iPhones and iPads Fail Almost Twice as Much as Android Devices \nATLANTA and LONDON , Nov. 17, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- With Apple and Android waged in a perpetual battle for smartphone market share every quarter, device performance can often play a role in shaping the final results. According to the Q3 2016 State of Mobile Device Performance and Health report released today by Blancco Technology Group (LON: BTLG), Apple has once again lost the performance battle to Android with its iPhones and iPads failing at a rate of 62 percent worldwide, compared to the 47 percent failure rate of Android devices. \nOn July 6, 2016 , the augmented reality game Pokemon GO was released in North America , Australia and New Zealand . Within days of its launch, the game became an overnight sensation. Data from SensorTower estimates that the average iPhone user spends 33 minutes in Pokémon GO, which is more than Facebook, Snapchat, Twitter and Instagram. But users' obsession with the game also caused the app to crash frequently and the server to go down for many users. This is supported by our Q3 2016 mobile diagnostics data, which found that the Pokemon GO app was highly prone to crash on iOS devices (5 percent). \n\"Our data suggests that the problems resulting from playing Pokemon GO were not only limited to iOS users,\" said Richard Stiennon , Chief Strategy Officer of Blancco Technology Group. \"Battery charging ranked in the list of the top five performance issues plaguing Android devices in Q3 2016. Since users must keep both their device screen and GPS on in order to play the virtual reality game, both of these functions are known to drain the device's battery charge.\" \nKey highlights from the Q3 2016 trend report include: Newer iPhone and iPad models struggled with higher failure rates, including iPhone 6 (13 percent), iPhone 6S (9 percent), iPhone 5S (9 percent) and iPad Air 2 (2 percent). Apps crashed on 65 percent of iOS devices, which is nearly triple the rate of crashing apps on Android devices (25 percent). Pokemon GO app ranked as one of the most instable iOS apps (5 percent), while the Google Play Services app crashed frequently (10 percent) on Android devices. LeEco's Le 2 had the highest failure rate (13 percent) among the failing Android devices, followed by Xiaomi's Redmi 3S (9 percent), Xiaomi's Redmi Note 3 (9 percent), Samsung's Galaxy S7 Edge (5 percent) and Lenovo's Vibe K5 Note (4 percent). Android users worldwide experienced repeated difficulties with their devices' battery charging (7 percent) and screens (6 percent). \nTo understand the correlation between device diagnostics and NTF returns, try the NTF Savings Calculator and get a breakdown of the annual costs mobile service providers are needlessly incurring from inaccurately diagnosing device issues. \nAbout Blancco Technology Group Blancco Technology Group is a leading, global provider of mobile device diagnostics and secure data erasure solutions.

      "text": "ATLANTA and LONDON , Nov. 17, With Apple and Android waged in a perpetual battle for smartphone market share every quarter, device performance can often play a role in shaping the final results. According to the Q3 2016 State of Mobile Device Performance and Health report released today by Blancco Technology Group (LON: BTLG), Apple has once again lost the performance battle to Android with its iPhones and iPads failing at a rate of 62 percent worldwide, compared to the 47 percent failure rate of Android devices.\nOn July 6, 2016 , the augmented reality game Pokemon GO was released in North America , Australia and New Zealand . Within days of its launch, the game became an overnight sensation. Data from SensorTower estimates that the average iPhone user spends 33 minutes in Pokémon GO, which is more than Facebook, Snapchat, Twitter and Instagram. But users' obsession with the game also caused the app to crash frequently and the server to go down for many users. This is supported by our Q3 2016 mobile diagnostics data, which found that the Pokemon GO app was highly prone to crash on iOS devices (5 percent).\n\"Our data suggests that the problems resulting from playing Pokemon GO were not only limited to iOS users,\" said Richard Stiennon , Chief Strategy Officer of Blancco Technology Group. \"Battery charging ranked in the list of the top five performance issues plaguing Android devices in Q3 2016. Since users must keep both their device screen and GPS on in order to play the virtual reality game, both of these functions are known to drain the device's battery charge.\"\nKey highlights from the Q3 2016 trend report include:\nNewer iPhone and iPad models struggled with higher failure rates, including iPhone 6 (13 percent), iPhone 6S (9 percent), iPhone 5S (9 percent) and iPad Air 2 (2 percent). Apps crashed on 65 percent of iOS devices, which is nearly triple the rate of crashing apps on Android devices (25 percent). Pokemon GO app ranked as one of the most instable iOS apps (5 percent), while the Google Play Services app crashed frequently (10 percent) on Android devices. LeEco's Le 2 had the highest failure rate (13 percent) among the failing Android devices, followed by Xiaomi's Redmi 3S (9 percent), Xiaomi's Redmi Note 3 (9 percent), Samsung's Galaxy S7 Edge (5 percent) and Lenovo's Vibe K5 Note (4 percent). Android users worldwide experienced repeated difficulties with their devices' battery charging (7 percent) and screens (6 percent).

      "title": "Apple MacBook Pro 13 Touch Bar: Zum Zerlegen eine Katastrophe",
      "text": "  Apple und das neue MacBook Pro 13 mit und ohne Touch Bar sorgen für viel Zündstoff in Diskussionen. Ohne Frage: Apples MacBook Pro 2016 polarisiert und erhitzt die Gemüter. Jüngst ärgern sich Besitzer des neuesten MacBook Pro Notebooks über eine mangelnde Kompatibilität zu bestehendem Thunderbolt-3-Zubehör. Und auch im Teardown von iFixit.com blamiert sich das Apple MacBook Pro 13 Touch Bar mit einer schlicht unterirdisch schlechten Reparierbarkeit. Schon das Apple MacBook Pro 13 (Late 2016) in der \"Escape Editon\" ohne Touch Bar outete sich im Teardown von iFixit.com nicht gerade als Musterbeispiel für Reparaturfreundlichkeit. Ganz im Gegenteil: Auch Apples neuestes Laptop schaffte nur einen Repairability Score von 2 aus maximal 10. Dass es noch schlechter geht, zeigt das MacBook Pro 13 mit Touch Bar. iFixit vergibt an das Apple-Notebook in der Modellvariante MacBook Pro 13 Touch Bar nur 1 Punkt. Setzen, 6! Das von iFixit zerlegte Modell A1706 mit Touch Bar hat zwei zusätzliche Thunderbolt-Ports, dafür aber \"kleinere\" Batterien. Laut iFixit kommt der Akku im MacBook Pro 13 mit Touch Bar auf 49,2 Wh während das Modell mit den konventionellen Funktionstasten eine Gesamtkapazität von 54,5 Wh ausweist. Zudem verfügt das Touch-Bar-Modell über keine SSD-Card, dafür aber über zwei Lüfter und zwei Heatpipes. Auf dem Mainboard des Apple MacBook Pro 13 Touch Bar finden sich unter anderem ein Intel Core i5-6267U Dualcore-Prozessor der Generation Skylake mit integrierter Intel Iris Graphics 550 IGP, ein Intel JHL6540 Thunderbolt-3-Controller, 2x 64 GB NAND Flash Memory SanDisk SDRQKBDC4 064G (128 GB) sowie 4x 2 GB Samsung K4E6E304EB-EGCE DDR3-DRAM (8 GB) als RAM und an der Rückseite nochmals 128 GB Flashmemory für eine Gesamtkapazität von 256 GB. Als Gründe für die sehr schlechte Reparierbarkeit des MacBook Pro 13 Touch Bar nennt iFixit die Verwendung von proprietären Spezialschrauben, die komplett eingeklebte Akkueinheit, den aufgelöteten Prozessor, RAM und Systemspeicher (Flash Memory). Mit dem Touch Bar und dem Touch-ID-Sensor kommen weitere Komponenten hinzu, die sich im Falle eines Defekts nur sehr schwer selbst oder nur über den Apple-Service austauschen lassen. Tests",

      "text": "Apple Explores Potential Chat Interactions With Siri in Messages Threads Thursday November 17, 2016 3:45 AM PST by Tim Hardwick Apple is looking into integrating its Siri virtual assistant into the company's Messages platform, according to a patent published today, enabling the AI to provide directions, retrieve movie times, and assist with peer-to-peer payments, among other potential uses. Picked up by AppleInsider , Apple's application for a \" Virtual assistant in a communication session \" appeared on the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office's website on Thursday, and details a system in which iMessage users can invoke Siri from within chat threads to get answers to relevant queries, complete scheduling tasks, and more. One scenario describes an instance in which users chatting amongst themselves bring Siri into the conversation simply by including it in the group thread. Using semantic analysis, the AI detects when it may be of help to complete a task and pitches in accordingly - such as finding a place to eat nearby, and telling the user how long it will take for their friends to arrive. Although Siri's responses don't appear to other users, the assistant is able to parse their messages in order to work out whether it can help with a task. For instance, in another example, the user asks \"Siri, help us schedule a meeting,\" in a group chat thread and the AI cross-checks open calendar dates for the present users to suggest a potential meeting date and time. Participants can then vote for a preferred time and place, after which Siri schedules the meeting in everyone's calendar. In another example, chat members are notified that a user is utilizing Siri and are asked if they would like to do the same, and participants can approve or deny AI access to personal data about them during the chat session. Meanwhile other scenarios depict AI interactions during peer-to-peer payments, for example by determining which financial apps are being used by each chat member. Some of the implementations in the patent bear similarities to actions already offered by Google Assistant in Google's Allo app, and by chat bots in Facebook Messenger, while third-party apps like PayPal and Uber currently offer Siri functionality following Apple's release of the Siri SDK to developers. Whether or not Apple decides to integrate Siri in Messages in a future update, the AI is likely to require extensive development before users consider inviting Siri to conversations and extending access to their data.",

      "text": "2016-11-17T11:00:36+00:00 Getty Images \nApple emerged as a guardian of user privacy this year after fighting FBI demands to help crack into San Bernardino shooter Syed Rizwan Farook’s iPhone. The company has gone to great lengths to secure customer data in recent years, by implementing better encryption for all phones and refusing to undermine that encryption. \nBut private information still escapes from Apple products under some circumstances. The latest involves the company’s online syncing service iCloud. \nRussian digital forensics firm Elcomsoft has found that Apple’s mobile devices automatically send a user’s call history to the company’s servers if iCloud is enabled — but the data gets uploaded in many instances without user choice or notification. \n“You only need to have iCloud itself enabled” for the data to be sent, said Vladimir Katalov, CEO of Elcomsoft. \nThe logs surreptitiously uploaded to Apple contain a list of all calls made and received on an iOS device, complete with phone numbers, dates and times, and duration. They also include missed and bypassed calls. Elcomsoft said Apple retains the data in a user’s iCloud account for up to four months, providing a boon to law enforcement who may not be able to obtain the data either from the user’s carrier, who may retain the data for only a short period, or from the user’s device, if it’s encrypted with an unbreakable passcode. \n“Absolutely this is an advantage [for law enforcement],” Robert Osgood, a former FBI supervisory agent who now directs a graduate program in computer forensics at George Mason University, said of Apple’s call-history uploads. “Four months is a long time [to retain call logs]. It’s generally 30 or 60 days for telecom providers, because they don’t want to keep more [records] than they absolutely have to. So if Apple is holding data for four months, that could be a very interesting data repository and they may have data that the telecom provider might not.” \nIt’s not just regular call logs that get sent to Apple’s servers. FaceTime, which is used to make audio and video calls on iOS devices, also syncs call history to iCloud automatically, according to Elcomsoft. The company believes syncing of both regular calls and FaceTime call logs goes back to at least iOS 8.2, which Apple released in March 2015. \nAnd beginning with Apple’s latest operating system, iOS 10, incoming missed calls that are made through third-party VoIP applications like Skype, WhatsApp, and Viber, and that use Apple CallKit to make the calls, also get logged to the cloud, Katalov said. \nBecause Apple possesses the keys to unlock iCloud accounts, U.S. law enforcement agencies can obtain direct access to the logs with a court order. But they still need a tool to extract and parse it. \nElcomsoft said it’s releasing an update to its Phone Breaker software tool today, that can be used to extract the call histories from iCloud accounts, using the accountholder’s credentials. Elcomsoft’s forensic tools are used by law enforcement, corporate security departments, and even consumers. The company also leases some of its extraction code to Cellebrite, the Israeli firm the FBI regularly uses to get into seized phones and iCloud data. \nIn some cases Elcomsoft’s tool can help customers access the iCloud even without account credentials, if they can obtain an authentication token for the account from the accountholder’s computer, allowing them to get iCloud data without Apple’s help. The use of authentication tokens also bypasses two-factor authentication if the accountholder has set this up to prevent a hacker from getting into their account, Elcomsoft notes on its web site. \nApple’s collection of call logs potentially puts sensitive information at the disposal of people other than law enforcement and other Elcomsoft customers. Anyone else who might be able to obtain the user’s iCloud credentials, like hackers, could potentially get at it too. In 2014, more than 100 celebrities fell victim to a phishing attack that allowed a hacker to obtain their iCloud credentials and steal nude photos of them from their iCloud accounts . The perpetrator reportedly used Elcomsoft’s software to harvest the celebrity photos once the accounts were unlocked. \nGenerally, if someone were to attempt to download data in an iCloud account, the system would email a notification to the account owner. But Katalov said no notification occurs when someone downloads synced call logs from iCloud. \nApple acknowledged that the call logs are being synced and said it’s intentional. \n“We offer call history syncing as a convenience to our customers so that they can return calls from any of their devices,” an Apple spokesperson said in an email.”Device data is encrypted with a user’s passcode, and access to iCloud data including backups requires the user’s Apple ID and password. Apple recommends all customers select strong passwords and use two-factor authentication.” \nThe syncing of iCloud call logs would not be the first time Apple has been found collecting data secretly. A few months ago, The Intercept reported about similar activity occurring with iMessage logs . \nChris Soghoian, chief technologist for the American Civil Liberties Union, said he’s not surprised that Apple is collecting the information. \n“It’s arguably not even the worst thing about iCloud,” he told The Intercept. “The fact that iCloud backs up what would otherwise be end-to-end encrypted iMessages is far worse in my mind. There are other ways the government can obtain [call logs]. But without the backup of iMessages, there may be no other way for them to get those messages.” \nStill, he said it’s further proof that “iCloud really is the Achilles heel of the privacy of the iPhone platform. The two biggest privacy problems associated with iCloud don’t have check boxes [for users to opt out], nor do they require that you opt in either.” \nJonathan Zdziarski, an iOS forensics expert and security researcher, said he doesn’t think Apple is doing anything nefarious in syncing the call logs. But he said that Apple needs to be clear to users that the data is being collected and stored in the cloud. Authorized and Unauthorized iCloud Collection \niCloud is Apple’s cloud service that allows users to sync data across multiple Apple devices, including iPhones, iPads, iPods, and Macs. The iPhone menu corresponding to the service gives users the option of syncing mail, contacts, calendars, reminders, browser history and notes and wallet data. But even though call logs are automatically getting synced as well, the menu does not list them among the items users can choose to sync. Because there’s no way to opt-in to sync call logs, there is also no way to opt out — other than turning off iCloud completely, but this can cause other issues, like preventing apps from storing documents and data (such as WhatsApp backups) in the cloud. \n“You can only disable uploading/syncing notes, contacts, calendars and web history, but the calls are always there,” Katalov said. One way call logs will disappear from the cloud, is if a user deletes a particular call record from the log on their device; then it will also get deleted from their iCloud account during the next automatic synchronization. \nKatalov said they’re still researching the issue but it appears that in some cases the call logs sync almost instantly to iCloud, while other times it happens only after a few hours. \nIn addition to syncing data among their devices, users can also configure their iCloud account to automatically back up and store their data. Katalov said that call logs get sent to the cloud with these backups as well, but this is separate from the trafficking his company discovered: Even if users disable the backups, their call logs will still get synced to Apple’s servers. \n“I would suggest Apple to add a simple option to disable call log syncing, as they do that for calendars and other things,” Katalov told The Intercept, though he acknowledges this would likely take some re-architecting on Apple’s part. Nonetheless, he says “they should allow people to disable that if they want to.” \nEven as Apple has increased the security of its mobile devices in recent years, the company has been moving more and more data to the cloud, where it is less protected. Although iCloud data is encrypted on Apple’s server, Apple retains the encryption keys in almost every instance and can therefore unlock the accounts and access data for its own purposes or for law enforcement. \n“All of your [iCloud] data is encrypted with keys that are controlled by Apple, but the average user isn’t going to understand that,” Zdziarski said. “You and I are well aware that Apple can read any of your iCloud data when they want to.” \nA report in the Financial Times nine months ago indicated Apple plans to re-architect iCloud to resolve this issue and better protect customer data, but that has yet to occur. \nApple discusses the privacy implications of iCloud collection on its website, and does say that implementing backups will send to iCloud “nearly all data and settings stored on your device.” A 63-page white paper on the site discloses more clearly that call logs get uploaded to Apple servers when iCloud backups are enabled. But neither document mentions that the logs still get uploaded even if backups aren’t enabled. \nEven law enforcement seems to be in the dark about the availability of these logs, especially logs going back four months. Osgood told The Intercept he was not aware of them. And in an online document about handling legal requests from law enforcement , Apple never mentions that call logs are available through iCloud. It says that it possesses subscriber information that customers provide, including name, physical address, email address, and telephone number. It also says it retains IP connection logs (for up to 30 days), email metadata (for up to 60 days), and content that the user chooses to upload, such as photos, email, documents, contacts, calendars, and bookmarks. The law enforcement document also says that Apple’s servers have iOS device backups, which may include photos and videos in the user’s camera roll, device settings, application data, iMessages, SMS and MMS messages and voicemail. \nThe only time it mentions call logs is to say that iCloud stores call histories associated with FaceTime, but it says it maintains only FaceTime call invitation logs, which indicate when a subscriber has sent an invitation to someone to participate in a FaceTime call. Apple says the logs “do not indicate that any communication between users actually took place.” It also says it only retains these logs for “up to 30 days.” \nBut Elcomsoft said this is not true. Katalov said the FaceTime logs contain full information about the call, including the identification of both parties to the call and the call duration. He said his researchers also found that the FaceTime call logs were retained for as long as four months. Early Clues from Frustrated Apple Customers \nSome users are aware that their call logs are being synced to Apple’s servers, because a by-product of the automatic syncing means that if they have the same Apple ID as someone with a different device — for example spouses who have different phones but use the same Apple ID — they will see calls from one device getting synced automatically to the device of the other person who is using the same ID. \n“Its very irritating,” one user complained in a forum about the issue. “My wife and I both have iPhones, we are both on the same apple ID. When she gets a call my phone doesn’t ring but when she misses that call my phone shows a missed call icon on the phone app and when I go to the phone app its pretty clearly someone who wasn’t calling my phone. Any way to fix this so it stops?” \nAnother user expressed frustration at not knowing how to stop the syncing . “I use my phone for business and we have noticed in the last few days that all of the calls I make and receive are appearing in my wife’s iPhone recent call history? I have hunted high and low in settings on both phones but with no joy.” \nThere’s no indication, however, that these customers realized the full implications of their logs being synced — that the same data is being sent to and stored on Apple’s servers for months. \nApple isn’t the only company syncing call logs to the cloud. Android phones do it as well, and Windows 10 mobile devices also sync call logs by default with other Windows 10 devices that use the same Microsoft Account. Katalov said there are too many Android smartphone versions to test but his company’s research indicates that call log syncing occurs only with Android 6.x and newer versions. As with Apple devices, the only way for a user to disable the call history syncing is to disable syncing completely. \n“In ‘pure’ [stock versions of] Android such as one installed on Nexus and Pixel devices, there is no way to select categories to sync,” Katalov said. “For some reason, that is only able on some third-party Android versions running on Sony, HTC, Samsung etc.” The company already produces a tool for harvesting call logs associated with Android devices . \nThere’s little that subscribers can do to prevent law enforcement from obtaining their iCloud call logs. But to protect against a hacker who might obtain your AppleID from doing the same, they can use two-factor authentication. But Zdziarski said there’s another solution. \n“The takeaway really is don’t ever use iCloud. I won’t use it myself until I can be in control of the encryption keys,” he said. Related",

      "text": "While many were left a little deflated with the release of Apple’s latest MacBook Pro, users of the high-spec laptop can at least take solace in the fact that they will be able to skip annoying YouTube ads at the stroke of a Touch Bar. The hack was discovered on Reddit by user RomansFiveEight . He wrote:\n“In Safari, the touchbar [sic] will pop up a scrubbing control whenever a video begins to play. Amazingly, you can use that to scrub THROUGH an ad, even a non-skippable 30 second pre-roll ad; and begin your video right away! \n“Who knows how long this ‘feature’ will exist. But, hey; pretty neat!” \nThe new Apple MacBook Pro lineup was met with criticism by some for an apparent lack of innovation in comparison to competitors, like Microsoft . However, it’s a still a powerful machine with more than enough new features for your average user to part with their cash (all $1,789 of it for the Touch Bar-equipped one) and not experience an all-consuming bout of buyer’s guilt.\nThis handy hack mightn’t convince anybody to buy one, but it is a nice added bonus.\nIn other tech news, WhatsApp just added a big new feature .\n",

But Apple 's initial iOS 10.2 update changed the peach emoji, a longtime representative of the behind, into less of a butt and into more of an actual peach.\nThat grave wrong, protested around social media , has now been undone. The third beta version of iOS 10.2, released today, brings back the peach we all know and love. And people are pretty excited.\nAs if a return to form for the peach emoji isn't enough, iOS 10.2 has plenty of other new stuff, too. There are new wallpapers, bug fixes and new camera preservation settings .",

      "text": "Reddit \nWith Apple’s $199/$299 Designed by Apple in California photo book having received mixed reactions, Jony Ive told Dazed that the company didn’t necessarily actively want to create the book, but felt obligated to do so. This follows an earlier interview with a Japanese design website. We started the project about eight years ago, with the feeling that we had a responsibility to try and create an archive of what we’ve done. Honestly, it felt more of an obligation than something that we felt really compelled to do. The reason for that, and I guess it’s a fairly obvious one, is that as designers, we are far more interested in and consumed by the future; in what doesn’t exist yet. But we’ve been working together for 20, 25 years, and it felt like the right and appropriate thing to do. You get a sense of what we’ve learned as a team and of how technology is evolving. \nHe also said that there were times when the design team really felt that the iPhone project wasn’t going to work out … The scariest thing is how a very fragile idea, a very vulnerable idea can become an incredibly powerful, influential and profound product. There were multiple stages while we were working on the phone when solving problems wasn’t inevitable and we really did have concerns that it wasn’t viable, that it wasn’t going to work. \nHe gave the example of how placing a touchscreen against your ear created problems that they were ultimately only able to solve with a combination of hardware (light sensor) and software solutions. \nIve also addressed the oft-raised criticism that Apple’s pace of innovation is too slow. There can be completely disproportional efforts that are required that make one step forward in one area and require the most extraordinary focus and effort and investment to make what may appear a relatively incremental improvement. Then you can have other areas where there could be extraordinary progress, but yes I think the challenge is that things don’t all share a uniform velocity in their development. \nHe also repeated a point he often makes: that it’s easy to create something that’s new, much harder to create something that’s better. \nIve said that Steve Jobs’ influence was still very much present in this regard: being willing to wait for all the pieces of the puzzle to come together to create the perfect solution. There’s an unseen part of the discipline which is, ‘Okay look there’s a technology here that has this affordance that means we could do this, but we can’t yet because we need technology A, B and C, or we need this new material that doesn’t exist right now’. So we put things to one side, knowing that at some point we will carry on working on them again. There are things that we would partially prototype, that we couldn’t complete. \nIve also said that the battered iPhone seen on page 135 of the book belongs to one of the designers in the studio who ‘destroys her objects.’ \nThe release of the book seems to have created renewed interest in the rather more affordable book Iconic: A Photographic Tribute to Apple Innovation , the latest edition of which is shown as out of stock but can be ordered in anticipation of new stock.

      "title": "Apple patent shows Siri interjecting in iMessage chats, scheduling dinner & more",
      "text": "Reddit \nAn Apple patent published today describes how Siri could interject in iMessage chats to do things like help schedule meetings based on the location and availability of chat participants. \nIn one illustration, when one chat participant asks ‘How long ’til you guys get here?’ Siri interjects by checking everyone’s location and then answering the question. In another, a chat participant asks Siri when the group could get together for lunch, and it checks each of their diaries to offer slots when all are free … \nIn short, it seems to offer exactly the sort of proactive intelligence I called for in a Feature Request last year. In time, I’d like Siri to be able to handle tasks like ‘ Arrange lunch with Sam next week.’ Siri knows who Sam is, so that bit’s fine. It has access to my calendar, so knows when I have free lunch slots. Next, it needs to know when Sam has free lunch slots. This shouldn’t be complicated. Microsoft Outlook may be one of my least-favorite apps in the world, but it has for years offered delegated access to calendars, where work colleagues are allowed to check each other’s diaries for free slots, and authorized people are allowed to add appointments. So what we need here is the iCloud equivalent. \nThe patent says that this is exactly the kind of manual task that could be automated by Siri. While current systems enable users to communicate and perform tasks, users are required to manually perform the tasks. For example, a group of users attempting to schedule lunch needs to determine an available day and time that works for each member of the group. This can require each user to check their calendar and share available times with other users. Likewise, a group of users attempting to perform a financial transaction needs to determine a payment method for performing the transaction. This can require each user to determine the payment methods available to the individual user and then share this data amongst the other members of the group. Accordingly, improvements are needed. \nThe patent spends considerable time discussing the obvious privacy concerns raised. Each participant in the chat would have the ability to approve or decline a request for access to data such as calendar and location. This is particularly important given that one of the features described in the patent is facilitating peer-to-peer payments – though here Apple suggests a less scary alternative to allowing Siri to actually complete the transaction. A task can include scheduling a meeting, performing a financial transaction, determining an estimated time of arrival, providing directions, providing weather information, alerting a user of relevant information, etc […] Alternatively, to assist with performing a financial transaction amongst multiple participant users of a communication session, a virtual assistant can determine the financial applications available and/or utilized by each of the participant users and recommend a financial application to perform the financial transaction. \nEither way, Touch ID would be used to authorize the transaction. \nAs ever with Apple patents, there’s no telling whether the company will ever implement the ideas described, but with Siri competitors like Viv and Google Assistant continually pushing the boundaries of what they can do, I’d say it’s more likely than not that at least some of this will make it into iPhones at some stage.",

      "text": "Apple's Newer iPhones and iPads Fail Almost Twice as Much as Android Devices   \nQ3 2016 State of Mobile Device Performance & Health Report Points to Crashing Apps and Overheating as Big Annoyances for iOS Users, With Pokemon GO App Highly Prone to Crashes \nATLANTA and LONDON , Nov. 17, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- With Apple and Android waged in a perpetual battle for smartphone market share every quarter, device performance can often play a role in shaping the final results. According to the Q3 2016 State of Mobile Device Performance and Health report released today by Blancco Technology Group (LON: BTLG), Apple has once again lost the performance battle to Android with its iPhones and iPads failing at a rate of 62 percent worldwide, compared to the 47 percent failure rate of Android devices. \nLogo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151006/274522LOGO \nOn July 6, 2016 , the augmented reality game Pokemon GO was released in North America , Australia and New Zealand . Within days of its launch, the game became an overnight sensation. Data from SensorTower estimates that the average iPhone user spends 33 minutes in Pokémon GO, which is more than Facebook, Snapchat, Twitter and Instagram. But users' obsession with the game also caused the app to crash frequently and the server to go down for many users. This is supported by our Q3 2016 mobile diagnostics data, which found that the Pokemon GO app was highly prone to crash on iOS devices (5 percent). \n\"Our data suggests that the problems resulting from playing Pokemon GO were not only limited to iOS users,\" said Richard Stiennon , Chief Strategy Officer of Blancco Technology Group. \"Battery charging ranked in the list of the top fve performance issues plaguing Android devices in Q3 2016. Since users must keep both their device screen and GPS on in order to play the virtual reality game, both of these functions are known to drain the device's battery charge.\" \nKey highlights from the Q3 2016 trend report include: Newer iPhone and iPad models struggled with higher failure rates, including iPhone 6 (13 percent), iPhone 6S (9 percent), iPhone 5S (9 percent) and iPad Air 2 (2 percent). Apps crashed on 65 percent of iOS devices, which is nearly triple the rate of crashing apps on Android devices (25 percent). Pokemon GO app ranked as one of the most instable iOS apps (5 percent), while the Google Play Services app crashed frequently (10 percent) on Android devices. LeEco's Le 2 had the highest failure rate (13 percent) among the failing Android devices, followed by Xiaomi's Redmi 3S (9 percent), Xiaomi's Redmi Note 3 (9 percent), Samsung's Galaxy S7 Edge (5 percent) and Lenovo's Vibe K5 Note (4 percent). Android users worldwide experienced repeated difficulties with their devices' battery charging (7 percent) and screens (6 percent). \nTo understand the correlation between device diagnostics and NTF returns, try the NTF Savings Calculator and get a breakdown of the annual costs mobile service providers are needlessly incurring from inaccurately diagnosing device issues. \nAbout Blancco Technology Group Blancco Technology Group is a leading, global provider of mobile device diagnostics and secure data erasure solutions.

      "text": "November 17, 2016 at 07:00 AM EST Garmin Pilot™ adds suite of new tools for pre-flight planning and in-flight operations to Apple mobile devices Garmin International today announced integrated weight and balance calculations, as well as aircraft performance tables and calculations within the Garmin Pilot app on Apple mobile devices. \nGarmin International Inc., a unit of Garmin Ltd. ( NASDAQ: GRMN ), today announced integrated weight and balance calculations, as well as aircraft performance tables and calculations within the Garmin Pilot app on Apple mobile devices. Also new to Garmin Pilot, Freehand flight planning allows for quick and easy flight plan editing from the moving map page. Pilot-configurable checklists are also integrated within Garmin Pilot, providing pilots the option to create custom checklists that are accessible within the app. These new features and more are available as a free update for existing customers and provide pilots with even more tools to aid in flight planning and in-flight navigation all within a single mobile application. This Smart News Release features multimedia. View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20161117005181/en/ \nGarmin Pilot displaying weight and balance calculations. (Photo: Business Wire) \n“We continue to pack more features and incorporate more capabilities into Garmin Pilot to provide our customers with a premier, all-inclusive application,” said Carl Wolf, Garmin vice president of aviation sales and marketing. “Pilots have been requesting an all-in-one app that merges their flight plan with other information pertaining to the flight, such as performance calculations, weight and balance and more. We’re excited to be the first to bring our customers this fully integrated experience so pilots have everything they need - from pre-flight to post-flight – all within Garmin Pilot.” \nIntegrated weight & balance \nGarmin Pilot is the first application that incorporates weight and balance calculations into a flight plan or a saved trip, taking into account fuel burn and more for a comprehensive look at weight and balance characteristics throughout an entire flight. Pilots can take advantage of pre-loaded aircraft types or enter aircraft weight and balance figures manually, noting the arm, moment and station of each point from the Pilot’s Operating Handbook (POH). Figures such as center of gravity (CG) are easily referenced in the application relative to an active flight plan. In the event CG limits entered within the app are exceeded, pilots receive a visual alert. Additionally, customized weight and balance profiles can be shared across multiple Garmin Pilot accounts. For example, pilots that operate a single airplane in a club can easily share the same weight and balance profile across different Garmin Pilot accounts. \nEnhanced performance calculation \nNew performance tables conveniently calculate climb, cruise and decent profiles so pilots can easily reference performance characteristics specific to their aircraft within Garmin Pilot. Pilots are provided with an interactive and graphically-rich interface to input figures that calculate aircraft performance, including variables such as power setting, fuel and distance to climb and cruise. All aircraft performance calculations also take into account pertinent factors such as outside air temperature (OAT) and altitude. Several of the most popular fixed-wing aircraft models among Garmin Pilot users are pre-populated within the app, however, similar to weight and balance data, aircraft performance tables that are manually created may be shared across multiple Garmin Pilot accounts. Additional aircraft types are expected to be added to the aircraft library in upcoming Garmin Pilot releases. \nAdditional flyGarmin ® integration \nEnhanced flyGarmin integration provides customers with more opportunities to easily customize and save data within the Garmin Pilot app. Pilots now have the option to input and save their own aircraft performance characteristics manually within the flyGarmin website, which can be shared across individualized aircraft profiles with other pilots across different accounts. Customized checklists can also be created within flyGarmin and synced to the Garmin Pilot app on a mobile device. \nFreehand \nWith a single tap pilots can utilize new Freehand flight plan editing, which can be quickly accessed via the radial menu within Garmin Pilot. Freehand allows pilots to easily plan or fly around weather, airspace, terrain or other pertinent features without leaving the moving map. Simply access Freehand by long-pressing over an active flight plan route on the map. By selecting the graphically edit icon within the radial menu, pilots can either tap individual waypoints or utilize Freehand mode to dynamically draw a route, which uses a combination of NavAids, intersections and airports to generate a new flight plan with a simple finger swipe across the map. \nCustomized Checklists \nChecklists can now easily be created and displayed within the Garmin Pilot app. Similar to an aircraft POH, these checklists can be categorized by normal, abnormal and emergency and then sorted even further by phase of flight, such as preflight, before take-off and before landing. Customized checklists are also interactive, allowing pilots to select each individual checklist item. When selected, the checklist item turns green and a green checkmark confirms the step has been completed. \nAdditional features Pilots can easily import multiple user-defined waypoints into Garmin Pilot using a CSV file format from a computer. Flight plans can now be created online using AOPA’s Flight Planner or SkyVector on a computer and sent to Garmin Pilot on a mobile device. Pilots can configure home screen icons to suit their flight planning preferences. \nGarmin Pilot 8.5 for Apple mobile devices is available immediately as a free update, providing existing customers access to these latest features. For new customers, Garmin Pilot is available in the Apple App Store SM as a free download for the first 30 days. After the 30-day trial period, customers may purchase an annual subscription of Garmin Pilot for the U.S. starting at $74.99.

      "text": "Suppliers may not be able to match Apple's demands Apple tipped to introduce OLED only in one model iPhone 8 is pegged to have an edge-to-edge curved display \nThe iPhone 8 next year is said to come with big changes, the most exciting one being the shift to OLED screens . However, a fresh report says that Apple's suppliers are facing production issues, and this hurdle could force the Cupertino giant to abandon OLED display plans for all of iPhone 8 models - sticking to one. \nBloomberg reports that four main suppliers - Samsung, LG, Sharp, and Japan Display - are not ready to produce OLED in a sufficiently large capacity to make screens for all new iPhone models next year. In fact, the companies have said that the production limitations could continue well into 2018 as well. \nIf the production capacity is not met, Apple would be unable to introduce OLED screens in all the iPhone 8 models. The report states that Apple has already sealed an exclusive deal with Samsung for 1 million OLED displays, but it remains unsure whether Samsung will be able to fulfil the demand. The South Korean giant is reportedly having trouble managing its own smartphone lineup demands, and to meet Apple's bulk order would require it to ramp up production to another new level. IHS Markit's supply chain analyst Dan Panzica told Bloomberg that Apple will have to succumb to its suppliers' constraints, and embed OLED displays in just one premium model. The other model will have to stick to the traditional LCD display seen on all the iPhone 7 models this year. Panzica also reiterated that the iPhone 8 will sport an all-glass back , and an edge-to-edge curved display screen with a virtual Home Button.\nLG Display Chief Executive Officer Han Sang-Beom does admit that the company was a little late in developing OLED screens for smaller devices. The company ships OLED for television units, and has just recently made investments in OLED for smartphones. Even Sharp President Tai Jeng-wu said that their company is in the process of developing the technology, and its production capacity rests on whether they succeed or not. Jeng-Wu earlier had confirmed that Apple is making the shift to OLED screens on iPhone . \nThe iPhone 8 has been rumoured to sport an advanced wireless charging technology that will enable the iPhone to charge without the need of a charging plate. It is also tipped to sport a new A11 processor, and a new Touch ID system.",

He has steadfastly dedicated much of his life to the improvement and promotion of scripting and automation technologies and, up until very recently, served as Apple's product manager for that group.\nMac OS X Automation :\nQ. I hear you no longer work for Apple; is that true?\nA. Correct. I joined Apple in January of 1997, almost twenty years ago, because of my profound belief that \"the power of the computer should reside in the hands of the one using it.\" That credo remains my truth to this day. Recently, I was informed that my position as Product Manager of Automation Technologies was eliminated for business reasons. Consequently, I am no longer employed by Apple Inc. But, I still believe my credo to be as true today as ever.\nBeyond his enormous technical skill and passion, Sal was an incredibly kind and gracious person. I only had the good fortune of meetings him a few times, but each was an absolute delight.\nOn behalf of everyone here, I wish him well in his future endeavors. We're profoundly lucky he seems to be maintaining his passion and willingness to share his skills beyond Apple.\nQ. Are you still upbeat about the future of user automation?\nA. Absolutely. The need for user automation is a constant. I've seen the benefits and power of individuals being able to automate critical and repetitive tasks. Solution apps are great, emojis are fun, but there's nothing like really great automation tools. I have faith in this community, and that makes me optimistic about what we can do together.\nCheers, Sal, and thank you!\n",

      "text": "iOS market share has nearly halved over the last two years and is now in danger of declining to under 10% of all phones globally. Gartner / Business Insider\nOver the last two years, Apple could not have asked for easier market conditions: The iPhone 6 was a huge hit, and eighteen months later Samsung's phone business collapsed after the disastrous Note 7 launch.\nYet Apple largely failed to take advantage of Samsung's bad luck. Its iPhone business is in decline, in terms of units sold. And its share of the global smartphone market has almost halved since 2014, according to new statistics from the research firm Gartner Inc.\nIn the last quarter, Apple sold 43 million iPhones compared to 328 million Androids, Gartner says. Android now accounts for 88% of all phones sold. iOS market share is barely above 10% worldwide.\niOS global market share: Q4 2014: 20.% Q3 2016: 11.5% Source: Gartner It's not just a story of Apple failing to reach a broader market for its high-end devices. It's also a testament to the resilience and popularity of Android. The operating system, given away free to manufacturers as an open-source product by Google, is often criticised by tech insiders for its fragmentation, the low frequency of software updates for users, and its security holes.\nAnd yet the system that tech bloggers love to hate is kicking Apple's butt.\nAt the end of 2014, when Apple launched the iPhone 6, the new large-screen phablet began eating into Android's share of the market almost immediately. By February 2015, sales of Android devices went into decline for the first time ever — an astonishing defeat for Android, especially given that the product is given away free to manufacturers.\nThen, in summer 2016, Samsung's flagship Galaxy Note 7 was launched and then immediately aborted after dozens of the devices suddenly exploded. Samsung's unit sales collapsed 14% year on year in Q3 2016, according to Gartner.\nApple should have been on the verge of a massive global sea change in its favour.\nInstead the opposite happened. iPhone collapsed and Android stole the market:\nGartner / Business Insider\niPhone didn't benefit much from the gap in the market created by Samsung's absence, Gartner's data shows. Instead, Chinese Android manufacturers stepped up their game. China's passion for new Android phones from companies like Oppo, Vivo, and Huawei have cut into Apple's famously high customer retention rates , according to research from UBS.\nHere is that same data in the form of percentage market share:\nGartner / Business Insider\nFrom this perspective, the launch of iPhone 6 — which looked like a killer blow to rival phones at the time — now looks like a brief bump in an otherwise downward historic trend.\nOf course, Apple has never had a majority market share and it does not want one. Apple sells devices that are among the most expensive, putting them out of reach of most people. Its strategy makes Apple the most profitable smartphone maker on earth. Apple takes 104% of all smartphone profits , globally. (The extra 4 percentage points come from the fact that some rivals sell at a loss.) If Apple were to expand its sales by offering lower prices its profitability — and its stock price — might fall. So Apple likely isn't too bothered that it is not the most popular kid on the block.\nNonetheless, there is a growing chorus of City and Wall Street analysts who want to know what Apple is going to do to either revive the iPhone or launch new products that move the needle the way iPhone did two years ago. The iPhone sales decline is not yet over , they say, because iPhone 7 had lacklustre updates over iPhone 6s. The Apple Watch has proved unpopular with consumers. Rumoured Apple TV and Apple Car devices have failed to materialise.\nThese charts won't help the narrative around Apple — they make iPhone look like a problem rather than a solution to Apple's future.\nHere are the numbers from Gartner we used to create these charts:\nGartner\nEXCLUSIVE FREE REPORT:\n25 Big Tech Predictions by BI Intelligence.

      "text": "Reddit \nSal Soghoian, the man who headed up user automation tools at Apple – including AppleScript and Automator – says that he left the company last month when Apple eliminated his position ‘for business reasons.’ Chicago Sun-Times tech columnist Andy Ihnatko broke the news yesterday, with Soghoian explaining more in a newly-added FAQ on his website. It’s unclear whether other team members have also been let go, but Soghoian says those concerned about the future of user automation in macOS should ask Apple. Ask Apple. Seriously, if you have any questions or concerns about the future of user automation, ask Apple. If user automation technologies are important to you, then now is the time for all good men and women to reach out, speak up and ask questions. The macOS user automation technologies include: UNIX CLI (shell, python, ruby, perl), System Services, Apple Events (JavaScript, AppleScript, AppleScriptObj-C, Scripting Bridge), Automator, Apple Configurator (AppleScript, Automator), and Application scripting support in Photos, iWork, Finder, Mail, and other Apple applications … The decision to lose Soghoian after almost 20 years in the role, together with a statement that makes the future of user automation tools seem uncertain, is bound to cause concern among those of us who depend on them on a daily basis. The fear will be that Apple may gradually cease support for power tools as part of an increasing consumer focus. Daring Fireball ‘s John Gruber said that the news ‘sounds ominous’ given that Apple has eliminated the position altogether rather than simply letting one individual go. (The more cynical among us might observe that it’s not unusual for a corporation to officially eliminate a position as a trouble-free way of letting someone go, before later replacing the position with one that – on paper – looks different. Gruber notes that Soghoian was ‘a bit of a rebel’ within the company, though notes that ‘you’ll never meet a warmer, nicer, more gregarious guy.’) Soghoian says that he will continue to host automation information at his own website ‘for the foreseeable future.’ We’ve reached out to Apple for comment, and will update with any response.",

      "text": " Blancco Technology Group\nQ3 2016 State of Mobile Device Performance & Health Report Points to Crashing Apps and Overheating as Big Annoyances for iOS Users, With Pokemon GO App Highly Prone to Crashes\nATLANTA and LONDON , Nov. 17, With Apple and Android waged in a perpetual battle for smartphone market share every quarter, device performance can often play a role in shaping the final results. According to the Q3 2016 State of Mobile Device Performance and Health report released today by Blancco Technology Group (LON: BTLG), Apple has once again lost the performance battle to Android with its iPhones and iPads failing at a rate of 62 percent worldwide, compared to the 47 percent failure rate of Android devices.\nOn July 6, 2016 , the augmented reality game Pokemon GO was released in North America , Australia and New Zealand . Within days of its launch, the game became an overnight sensation. Data from SensorTower estimates that the average iPhone user spends 33 minutes in Pokémon GO, which is more than Facebook, Snapchat, Twitter and Instagram. But users' obsession with the game also caused the app to crash frequently and the server to go down for many users. This is supported by our Q3 2016 mobile diagnostics data, which found that the Pokemon GO app was highly prone to crash on iOS devices (5 percent).\n\"Our data suggests that the problems resulting from playing Pokemon GO were not only limited to iOS users,\" said Richard Stiennon , Chief Strategy Officer of Blancco Technology Group. \"Battery charging ranked in the list of the top five performance issues plaguing Android devices in Q3 2016. Since users must keep both their device screen and GPS on in order to play the virtual reality game, both of these functions are known to drain the device's battery charge.\"\nKey highlights from the Q3 2016 trend report include:\nNewer iPhone and iPad models struggled with higher failure rates, including iPhone 6 (13 percent), iPhone 6S (9 percent), iPhone 5S (9 percent) and iPad Air 2 (2 percent). Apps crashed on 65 percent of iOS devices, which is nearly triple the rate of crashing apps on Android devices (25 percent). Pokemon GO app ranked as one of the most instable iOS apps (5 percent), while the Google Play Services app crashed frequently (10 percent) on Android devices. LeEco's Le 2 had the highest failure rate (13 percent) among the failing Android devices, followed by Xiaomi's Redmi 3S (9 percent), Xiaomi's Redmi Note 3 (9 percent), Samsung's Galaxy S7 Edge (5 percent) and Lenovo's Vibe K5 Note (4 percent). Android users worldwide experienced repeated difficulties with their devices' battery charging (7 percent) and screens (6 percent).

      "text": "print \niOS market share has nearly halved over the last two years and is now in danger of declining to under 10% of all phones globally. Gartner / Business Insider \nOver the last two years, Apple could not have asked for easier market conditions: The iPhone 6 was a huge hit, and eighteen months later Samsung's phone business collapsed after the disastrous Note 7 launch. \nYet Apple largely failed to take advantage of Samsung's bad luck. Its iPhone business is in decline, in terms of units sold. And its share of the global smartphone market has almost halved since 2014, according to new statistics from the research firm Gartner Inc. \nIn the last quarter, Apple sold 43 million iPhones compared to 328 million Androids, Gartner says. Android now accounts for 88% of all phones sold. iOS market share is barely above 10% worldwide. iOS global market share: Q3 2016: 11.5% Source: Gartner \nIt's not just a story of Apple failing to reach a broader market for its high-end devices. It's also a testament to the resilience and popularity of Android. The operating system, given away free to manufacturers as an open-source product by Google, is often criticised by tech insiders for its fragmentation, the low frequency of software updates for users, and its security holes. \nAnd yet the system that tech bloggers love to hate is kicking Apple's butt. \nAt the end of 2014, when Apple launched the iPhone 6, the new large-screen phablet began eating into Android's share of the market almost immediately. By February 2015, sales of Android devices went into decline for the first time ever — an astonishing defeat for Android, especially given that the product is given away free to manufacturers. \nThen, in summer 2016, Samsung's flagship Galaxy Note 7 was launched and then immediately aborted after dozens of the devices suddenly exploded. Samsung's unit sales collapsed 14% year on year in Q3 2016, according to Gartner. \nApple should have been on the verge of a massive global sea change in its favour. \nInstead the opposite happened. iPhone collapsed and Android stole the market: \nGartner / Business Insider \niPhone didn't benefit much from the gap in the market created by Samsung's absence, Gartner's data shows. Instead, Chinese Android manufacturers stepped up their game. China's passion for new Android phones from companies like Oppo, Vivo, and Huawei have cut into Apple's famously high customer retention rates , according to research from UBS. \nHere is that same data in the form of percentage market share: \nGartner / Business Insider \nFrom this perspective, the launch of iPhone 6 — which looked like a killer blow to rival phones at the time — now looks like a brief bump in an otherwise downward historic trend. \nOf course, Apple has never had a majority market share and it does not want one. Apple sells devices that are among the most expensive, putting them out of reach of most people. Its strategy makes Apple the most profitable smartphone maker on earth. Apple takes 104% of all smartphone profits , globally. (The extra 4 percentage points come from the fact that some rivals sell at a loss.) If Apple were to expand its sales by offering lower prices its profitability — and its stock price — might fall. So Apple likely isn't too bothered that it is not the most popular kid on the block. \nNonetheless, there is a growing chorus of City and Wall Street analysts who want to know what Apple is going to do to either revive the iPhone or launch new products that move the needle the way iPhone did two years ago. The iPhone sales decline is not yet over , they say, because iPhone 7 had lacklustre updates over iPhone 6s. The Apple Watch has proved unpopular with consumers. Rumoured Apple TV and Apple Car devices have failed to materialise. \nThese charts won't help the narrative around Apple — they make iPhone look like a problem rather than a solution to Apple's future. \nHere are the numbers from Gartner we used to create these charts: \nGartner ",

      "text": "Apple Reportedly Plans to Cut App Store Fees for Subscription Video Apps Apple is expected to release its TV app next month The company to cut margin from current 30 to 15 percent Apple announced its unified TV App for Apple TV, iPad, iPhone last month \nApple is reportedly gearing up to cut the amount it charges from video streaming services in half on App Store, a move said to be in-sync with the company's upcoming TV app plans. \nBloomberg is reporting that the move to reduce the amount from video streaming service from current 30 percent to 15 percent citing people familiar with the plans. The move could be seen as an attempt to woo video service providers like Netflix, Amazon, and HBO among others to join Apple's new initiative. \nNotably, Apple has been long criticised for charging a hefty amount on video streaming services on the App Store. The reduction in amount will be applicable to users who have at least paid for a year's subscription. Apple is extending the \"rate to all subscription video services as long as they are integrated with Apple's new TV app,\" claims the report. It adds that some video partners are already paying Apple just 15 percent of monthly subscription fees. To recall, Apple launched the new app, simply called TV, which will be released to Apple TV, iPad, and iPhone for free later this year, and it unifies the content that users buy and subscribe to across multiple services.\nThe report says that Apple plans to officially release the new TV app next month and it will be dedicated to TV shows and movies. The new app will show movies and live events sorted and organised within the TV app's interface. \nAt its MacBook Pro event last month, Apple showcased the TV app and confirmed that people will be able to use Siri to launch into a video just by its name, or by the name of a channel or service, or even by the name of a sports team. \nThe report adds that Apple delayed its plans to launch TV app after it faced difficulty getting rights from programmers and broadcast networks.",

      "text": "OLED: Apple could face supply challenge International / 17 November 2016, 12:07pm Mark Gurman and Jungah Lee \nSan Francisco - Apple has big plans to outfit its next iPhone with vibrant, energy-sipping organic LED displays, seeking to entice consumers with new technology that’s already been embraced by other high-end smartphone makers. \nThe trouble is that the four main suppliers for such components won’t have enough production capacity to make screens for all new iPhones next year, with constraints continuing into 2018, people familiar with the matter said, presenting a potential challenge for the Cupertino, California-based company. File picture: Karen Bleier. Credit: AFP \nOLED screens are more difficult to produce, putting Apple at the mercy of suppliers that are still working to manufacture the displays in mass quantities, the people said. The four largest producers are Samsung Display, LG Display, Sharp and Japan Display. While Samsung is on track to be the sole supplier for the new displays next year, the South Korean company may not be able to make enough due to low yield rates combined with increasing iPhone demand. \nThe supply constraints may force Apple to use OLED in just one version of the next-generation iPhone, push back adoption of the technology or cause other snags. \n“Apple has already figured in there will be high demand for the OLED model and they’ve also figured out there will be constraints to these panels,” said Dan Panzica, a supply chain analyst at IHS Markit. The combination of Apple’s stringent quality requirements and the difficulty of producing OLED panels will likely lead to supply constraints, he said. \nApple plans to ship at least one new iPhone with an OLED screen next year, the 10th anniversary of the smartphone’s debut, people with knowledge of the matter said. A pair of other new iPhone models will likely feature screens that use older LCD technology, partly because there won’t be enough OLED displays to satisfy anticipated demand, according to KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. \n“Display technology is still a pretty key driver of the purchasing experience,” said Ben Bajarin, an analyst at Creative Strategies. Apple has previously used new display features as iPhone selling points. For example, the iPhone 4 in 2010 added Apple’s first Retina Display, the iPhone 5 in 2012 introduced the iPhone’s first display size increase, and the iPhone 6 in 2014 brought new 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch screen options. \nThe OLED iPhone, at least, will have a new look that extends glass from the display to the device’s back and edges, according to a person familiar with Apple’s plans. This all-glass design will have virtual Home button embedded in an edge-to-edge screen, rather than a physical button that can be pressed, the person added. \nAn Apple spokeswoman declined to comment. \nApple typically introduces new technologies for its iPhones across all models when they’re unveiled every September, as it did for 3D Touch and Apple Pay. Using different core, user-facing technology in the same iPhone generation would be an unusual step. All current iPhone 7 models have LCD screens. Still, Apple may have no choice. \nSharp and Japan Display are still working on test procedures for OLED screens and have said that they are on track for production in 2018, while seeking to manage expectations. \n“There is all this talk about OLEDs, but I’m not at all sure about their future,” Sharp President Tai Jeng Wu told reporters recently. “We need to work on developing the technology, but whether we can succeed remains to be seen.” \nShuji Aruga, president of Japan Display, said earlier this month that he sees a 50-50 split between OLEDs and LCDs that will be used in high-end phone screens. “We are not yet at a stage where we can decisively choose between OLED and LCD,” he said. “We need to develop OLED capacity so that we are not caught empty-handed if the technology does end up capturing a majority.” \nLG Display is the laggard. “It’s true that we were late in OLED investment for smaller electronics devices compared to that of televisions,” LG Display Chief Executive Officer Han Sang-beom said earlier this year, adding that the company now understands OLED’s importance for smartphones. \nApple and Samsung have an exclusive OLED supply deal for 2017, people with knowledge of the agreement said. Still, that doesn’t guarantee the South Korean technology giant will have enough output to meet demand for the revamped iPhone. For example, Samsung’s OLED supplies have even been constrained for its own mobile division’s smartphones. A representative for Samsung Display declined to comment. \nApple’s initial OLED order from Samsung is for 100 million units over one year, according to people familiar with the agreement. Even so, Samsung will probably only be able to deliver a portion of that for the 2017 holiday period. Apple shipped about 75 million iPhones in the 2015 holiday quarter, and some analysts estimate that as many as 90 million could be sold in the last three months of 2017. \nThe OLED screens ordered by Apple in the Samsung deal are for displays larger than 5 inches, a person familiar with the matter said. If Samsung sees supply constraints in its ramp up of OLED panels for the fall 2017 iPhone launch, Apple may not have another major provider to fall back on. That’s why Apple usually has multiple suppliers for key components. For example, it has sourced LCD panels from all of the major Asia-based display makers. For next year, at least, it appears that OLED supply chain may be a single-company affair. \nApple has run into supply problems before, for example when it sought to adopt tough sapphire screens for the iPhone 6 in 2014. Even though it financed a sole supplier, GT Advanced Technologies, to ramp up production and deliver the material, the manufacturer wasn’t able to deliver enough sapphire glass of acceptable quality. As a result, Apple abandoned plans to use stronger screens, and GT Advanced ended up seeking bankruptcy protection. \n* With assistance from Takashi Amano, Gao Yuan and Pavel Alpeyev Bloomberg ",

      "text": "Reddit \nThe latest report from KGI suggests Apple will breakaway from the existing two phone strategy next year with another high-end tier. The report says Apple is planning one new iPhone, dubbed iPhone 8, with major chassis redesigns and component upgrades featuring an OLED screen about 5.2-inches in size. It will also make two new iPhones with 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch displays; these will be more iterative successors to the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus . \nThe OLED iPhone appears to be the most interesting phone that will include the most ‘new’ stuff. If the KGI report comes to pass, in 2017 the high-end iPhone will not be the one with the biggest screen. \nThe report notes that the OLED iPhone will have an ‘active screen area’ of 5.1- to 5.2-inches but the panel itself may be up to 5.8-inches diagonally. This probably means the user-interactive touchscreen will be about 5.2 inches with the remaining area wrapping around the edge of the phone, as rumored. \nA detailed description of the OLED iPhone changes was not given but it seems like it will feature a bezel-less front design with the Home Button somehow integrated into the display. The screen panel would extend around the sides of the phone for aesthetics similar to the Galaxy S7 Edge. KGI says the OLED panel for the iPhone will be supplied exclusively by Samsung. \nThe report explains that Apple will put the latest designs and developments into the OLED iPhone, essentially making it the flagship 2017 Apple iPhone despite not having the largest touchscreen. With the current phones, the largest 5.5-inch ‘Plus’ model is technically superior to the 4.7 inch phone with a dual-camera. According to KGI, display size will no longer be the differentiating factor between high-end and low-end iPhone devices. \nThe aforementioned 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch iPhones will still have updates but they will largely resemble the industrial design of the current iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. KGI says that these devices will likely adopt glass casing instead of metal, in the same general design as current iPhone models. \nThe purpose of the iterative 4.7-inch and iPhone 5.5-inch is unknown. KGI speculates they may be offered at lower price points, attracting more price-conscious customers, allowing Apple to pack advanced technology into the premium (undoubtedly more expensive) OLED flagship iPhone. \nThis report implies the biggest shakeup between iPhone SKUs so far as previously iPhones have been pretty similar apart from screen size. It would mean the new iPhones using two different display technologies, external chassis design and more. Keeping OLED to just one model may be a supply chain limitation; last night, Bloomberg said Apple was struggling to secure OLED displays for iPhones in sufficient quantities. Guides",

      "text": "Reddit \nElcomsoft – the Russian company which sells iPhone cracking tools to governments and corporations – says that iPhones send near real-time call logs to Apple servers even when iCloud backup is switched off, and that these logs are stored for up to four months. \nElcomsoft CEO Vladimir Katalov told Forbes that it also isn’t just traditional phone calls that are logged, and that iOS 10 has expanded the scope of the logging … All FaceTime calls are logged in the iCloud too, whilst as of iOS 10 incoming missed calls from apps like WhatsApp and Skype are uploaded, said Elcomsoft, which provides phone forensics tools to police. \nThis is likely as a result of iOS 10’s CallKit support . \nKatalov said that the logs are uploaded from any iPhone which has iCloud Drive enabled. “Syncing call logs happens almost in real time, though sometimes only in a few hours,” he added. “But all you need to have is just iCloud Drive enabled, and there is no way to turn that syncing off, apart from just disabling iCloud Drive completely. In that case many applications will stop working or lose iCloud-related features completely.” \nThe company says that while Apple is open about allowing law enforcement access to iCloud backup data on receipt of a court order, the company doesn’t disclose that it holds call logs even when backups are not enabled. Katalov also challenged the statement on Apple’s website that it only stores FaceTime call logs for 30 days. Synced data contains full information including call duration and both parties. We were able to extract information going back more than four months. \niOS forensics expert Jonathan Zdziarski told Forbes that he believed this was an oversight by Apple rather than any deliberate attempt to obfuscate the information it holds. \nI suspect that this is probably more of an engineering issue around making handoff work when you are answering calls between your phone and your desktop or if you’re using FaceTime on your desktop. They need to be able to sync a lot of that call data. I suspect whatever software engineer wrote that part of it probably decided to just go and stick that data in your iCloud Drive because that’s kind of what its purpose is. I’m convinced it wasn’t very well thought out if that’s the case. \nApple has already indicated an intention to use full end-to-end encryption for iCloud backups at some point in the future. At present, backups are encrypted but Apple holds the key; by switching to end-to-end encryption, Apple would have no access to the data. Guides",

      "text": "* Tuba Gooding Jr. - Kazoo, Banana Shaker, Apple Shaker* Mark Kelley - Kazoo* Frank Knuckles - Bongos* Black Thought - Tambourine, Brown Hat \nAs you read this, METALLICA is in the midst of releasing music videos for every song on its new album, \"Hardwired... To Self-Destruct\" . Half the clips emerged every two hours on Wednesday (November 16), starting with \"Dream No More\" at noon ET, while the rest are expected to arrive at the same rate on Thursday (November 17). \nThe clips will finish premiering just as the clock hits midnight Friday (November 18) in New Zealand, when the new album will be officially available worldwide. Drummer Lars Ulrich told The Pulse Of Radio that METALLICA didn't have a plan in mind when they began to write the album. \"There wasn't really any sort of sitdown powwows or talks or battle cries — I mean, it wasn't like here's the big kind of blueprint,\" he said. \"We just started making music and writing songs. There was no big band meetings about 'what's the direction of the record' or any of that kind of stuff. It just sort of happened organically, really.\" \nThe videos were all filmed around the globe with various directors, with each one debuting through a different website or media outlet. \nThe clips that premiered on Wednesday were \"Dream No More\" , \"Confusion\" , \"ManUNkind\" , \"Now That We're Dead\" , \"Here Comes Revenge\" and \"Am I Savage\" .

      "text": "Apple to launch Google glass version in wearable technology By R. Siva Kumar Nov 17, 2016 08:44 AM EST Smartglasses. Advertisement \nThere is a new possibility in front of Apple Inc. And that is moving on to smartglasses. Even though it is a difficult feat, it unfolds a number of possibilities. \nBeing still in a developmental phase, Smartglass is thought to link in a wireless technique to the user's iPhone. It will enable images as well as Internet browsing. For the purpose, the company might use augmented reality. Advertisement \nWhile Apple has placed orders for a small number of smartglasses, there is not enough for mass production. \nWith the sale of iPhones having come down, Apple has been asked to deliver something new. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said he was excited about the augmented reality. After all, with the rise of Pokemon Go, a location-based game using the technology, there has been a lot of interest generated for it. \nHence, the first venture into the hardware market, targeting Pokemon Go, is expected to be Apple smartglass. It is still in its exploration phase. \nBefore Apple, Alphabet too had introduced the new technology before it was stopped over privacy concerns. Snap's smartglass in 2012 looked too \"awkward\" to last. Combined with privacy concerns, the end of the smartglass was quicker than Snap expected, says Inverse . It was a video-camera sunglass. \nEven though the launch of smartglasses for Apple is going to be a difficult thing to go into, it would be impossible to create small batteries with enough power for virtual reality. However, experts are sure that Apple might be successful in the long run, as the company is reputed for its ability to turn technological advances into \"easy-to-use\" products. \nThe device will be introduced in 2018.",

      "text": "| Editorial \nApple was, it seemed, somewhat late with the 4th generation 1080p Apple TV that shipped in October of 2015. Not delivering at 4K device at that time could be forgiven because High Dynamic Range (HDR) specs hadn’t been formalized during its development. But for the holidays of 2016, most all the 4K/UHD TVs have HDR. The new Roku Ultra has HDR. So what is Apple thinking? \nApple, according to CEO Tim Cook, has an intense interest in TV. To quote Mr. Cook: \n“I would confirm that television has intense interest with me and many other people here. \nApple, by the way, always builds the best product it can. So when I think about Apple having an intense interest in something, I tend to think about both accomplishment and joyful products that amaze and delight. An often frustrating Siri and remote are Apple’s plan for the “best” Apple TV Hurdles \nWhat I keep coming back to is that Apple has involved itself in what I would call Imperial Entanglements. By that I mean that the TV industry is complex. There are many players who all protect their IP and have strong agendas. And so, when Apple plays in in this arena, it’s pitting itself against the vested interests of many entities, all with seasoned executives who know how to maximize revenues and look out for themselves. Is that a place where Apple can flourish? \nRemember when Apple tried to develop a subscription service? It would have undercut the interests of networks, but Apple felt that its impressive stature would convince others to go along with them. Apple TV would be the wave of the future. \nExcept it hasn’t been. \nThe result has been a new TV app that doesn’t support Netflix. Plus, we have an Apple TV that doesn’t have the Amazon Prime app, presumably because Amazon and Apple aren’t getting along well enough to strike a beneficial deal for both parties. \nAmidst all that, Apple isn’t exactly threatening to put Roku out of business with a world-class set-top-box with 4K/UHD, HDR10, perhaps Dolby Vision, optical audio and a stunning industrial design. Roku is the market share leader amongst these devices, and by necessity, always has the best and latest in technology. They have to. Roku acts like a company that’s hungry and works hard to maintain its position. Its customers a loyal and love them for that. As Lily Tomlin once said, Apple is the phone company. It doesn’t have to care . In TV, the Best is Advanced, Flexible, Expandable, Competitive \nIn fact, Apple seems totally disinterested in building fabulous hardware that fits in with lots of different kinds of home systems and has the capacity to get us excited. \nApparently, another year will pass as millions of customers upgrade to 4K/UHD, and one of the first accessories they’ll buy is a 4K/UHD/HDR Roku player. \nMeanwhile, Apple always seems to be struggling to get its act together on the app side and has to settle for incomplete, less than thrilling content deals and technical arrangements. \nA healthy part of me wishes Apple would just build the coolest, best TV hardware on the planet—an impressive and attractive platform on which other content providers want to play. \nRight now, I don’t see how Apple’s “intense interest in TV” and its legacy of always building the best is being achieved.

      "title": "Mozilla updates Firefox Focus for iOS with a stripped-down private browser",
      "text": "Tags: Apple , Firefox , Firefox Focus , Focus , Focus by Firefox , iOS , Mozilla Firefox , Mozilla Foundation , top-stories \nMozilla today launched a new browser for iOS. In addition to Firefox, the company now also offers Firefox Focus, a browser dedicated to user privacy that by default blocks many web trackers, including analytics, social, and advertising. You can download the new app now from Apple’s App Store . \nIf you’re getting a huge feeling of déjà vu, that’s because in December 2015, Mozilla launched Focus by Firefox, a content blocker for iOS . The company has now rebranded the app as Firefox Focus, and it serves two purposes. The content blocker, which can still be used with Safari, remains unchanged. The basic browser, which can be used in conjunction with Firefox for iOS, is new. \nFirefox Focus is basically just an iOS web view with tracking protection. If you shut it down or iOS shuts it down while it’s in the background, the session is lost. There’s also an erase button if you want to wipe your session sooner. But those are really the only features — there’s no history, menus, or even tabs. \nHere is Mozilla’s pitch for Firefox Focus: \nWe live in an age where too many users have lost trust and lack meaningful controls over their digital lives. For some users, it seems as though your web activities can follow you everywhere – across devices, across accounts. To make matters worse, the web can often feel cluttered. That’s why we are introducing Firefox Focus. For the times when you don’t want to leave a record on your phone. \nNick Nguyen, VP of product at Firefox, told VentureBeat that many iOS users still find the whole content blocker setup a little confusing. They are told to launch one app but only see the resulting experience in another app. Firefox Focus addresses this complaint in a very roundabout way. \nNguyen told us the browser started as a proof of concept, but Mozilla employees really liked the prototype so the company decided to ship it. He described using it as “peeking into the web” because you get to load any site you want without leaving a trace. \nFirefox Focus uses the same blocking list as Firefox’s Private Browsing mode on Windows, Mac, Linux, and Android . This list, published under the General Public Licence, is based on the tracking protection rules laid out by the anti-tracking startup Disconnect . Anyone can view that open-source blocklist over on GitHub . \nJust like the content blocker, the basic browser offers not just privacy benefits, but performance gains too. Mobile web pages are often slowed down by trackers, and often more so than desktop pages given that the former load on less powerful devices and on poorer internet connections. \nBut just like with any content blocker, there is a tradeoff. Sites that depend on trackers may not load correctly. In those cases, Firefox Focus gives the user the option to open the given site in either Firefox or Safari. \nSo why not just include Firefox Focus functionality in Firefox itself? \niOS offers two webview options: WKWebView and UIWebView. The former, which Firefox for iOS uses, is supposed to match the performance of Safari, but it doesn’t allow content blocking. The latter, which Firefox Focus for iOS users, is the older option on iOS that allows content blocking. \nAs Nguyen put it, iOS means you “can’t get a good rendering engine with a good content blocker.” Because of these restrictions, this is basically Mozilla’s way of offering tracking protection on iOS. Firefox for Android already has tracking protection, so Mozilla is using iOS to see whether there is a market for a very stripped-down browser before offering it elsewhere. Mozilla is toying with adding an option in Firefox for iOS to launch Firefox Focus, and frankly we think that should be there from the start. \nFirefox for iOS has millions of users, while the current Focus user base is less than a million, a Mozilla spokesperson told VentureBeat. They will all be getting this new private browser when Focus by Firefox updates and becomes Firefox Focus. \nThis major update today is another example in a long list of privacy initiatives by Mozilla. As the developer of the only major browser that isn’t owned by a tech giant, the company is free from ulterior motives.",

After restarting the devices, users found the battery indicators at zero. \nBut after plugging into the chargers, those devices showed partial battery levels again, some customers said, according to the person. \nApple's engineering department has collected a lot of information and is looking into the complaints, the staff said.

      "text": "These Major Changes Could Be Coming to Apple's iPhone and iPad By Don Reisinger / Fortune.com \nT+L Just In newsletter. T+L Newsletters \nA bigger screen is just the beginning. \nThis story originally appeared on Fortune.com . \nApple’s iPhone and iPad could deliver some major improvements next year, analysts say. \nThe tech giant’s next iPhone, which could be known as the iPhone 8, will ship with bigger screen sizes, Barclays analysts Blayne Curtis and Christopher Hemmelgarn said in a note this week. They say the iPhone 8 will offer a 5-inch screen and iPhone 8 Plus will deliver a 5.8-inch display, according to Business Insider, which obtained a copy of the note. The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus offer 4.7- and 5.5-inch screen sizes. \nRelated: British Airways Plans to Add Extra Seats in Economy Class \nThe larger screens would be offered if Apple decides to offer a “bezel-less design” in the iPhone 8, according to the report. Rather than stop the screen before the left and right edges, Apple is expected to offer a design that has the iPhone 8’s display spill over the sides, creating an end-to-end touch surface. On the left and right side, the iPhone 8’s screen would curve, similar to the “edges” in the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge. \nIn order to deliver that feature, the iPhone 8 will need to ship with organic light-emitting diode (OLED) screen technology. It would be the first from Apple to offer OLED. All iPhone versions through the iPhone 7 have run on LCD technology. \n“By using a plastic OLED screen, the screen can bend at the edges to allow a curved bezel-less edge,” the analysts reportedly told investors. \nRelated: Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin Will Take Tourists to Space by 2018 \nTheir comments come after several rumors have surfaced saying Apple is working on an OLED-based curved screen. However, Apple has yet to even confirm it’s working on a new smartphone , let alone new display technology, and the analysts acknowledged that the company hasn’t yet made a final decision on the next iPhone’s screen. But evidence suggests Apple’s next iPhone will come with a big display update. \nIn regards to Apple’s iPad, the analysts said that the company will release new tablets in March. Like the iPhone, the new iPads are expected to come with a “bezel-less” design and offer displays that stretch from one side to another. The 9.7-inch model would become the “low-price” version and complement the higher-end 12.9-inch iPad Pro. What’s more, Apple could announce a new 10.9-inch iPad that would feature the bezel-less design. \nApple currently sells 7.9-, 9.7- and 12.9-inch versions of its iPad. Some had anticipated Apple updating the tablets this year, but the company focused instead on a new iPhone and new MacBook Pro. \nRelated: Airfares Will Be Up Next Year, if Airlines Have Their Way \nThere is some debate over when a bezel-less iPad might surface. Although the Barclays analysts say it’s only a matter of months, a KGI Securities analyst said in a research note recently that Apple likely wouldn’t offer OLED and thus, a curved display, in the iPad until 2018. \nApple hasn’t confirmed any of the rumors and did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Apple Faces a Tough Chinese Consumer Agency Over iPhone Battery Fail \nAfter numerous reports in China of iPhones shutting off unexpectedly with ample battery power remaining, Apple faces a Chinese regulator that has forced two other foreign companies into recalls since the summer. \nThe China Consumers Association is a Beijing regulator lobbying on behalf of consumer rights and dispute resolution. It recently noticed a rare flood of complaints on Chinese social media about Apple products shutting down because of cooler temperatures despite having 50% battery remaining. \n“In view that Apple iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s series cellphones in China have a considerable number of users, and the number of people who’ve reported this problem is rather many, China Consumer Association has already made a query with Apple,” the CCA said in an open letter on Tuesday. The CCA said Apple should investigate the reported problems. \nApple responded today, telling the state-run ThePaper.cn news site that it was working to help a small number of consumers and said it was in contact with government agencies—presumably the CCA—to assist customers. \nBut by stopping short of promising replacements, Apple may face more pressure in China. The CCA has earned a reputation for coercing foreign companies into recalls in the country. \n\nIt began this summer when Ikea recalled 36 million dressers in North America that had displayed a propensity to fall on top of children if not bolted to the wall. Ikea did not extend the recall to China, which inflamed state media, who said the company treated China with a double standard. But after conferencing with the CCA and China’s General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine (AQSIQ), Ikea quickly extended the recall to 1.7 million Chinese dressers. The CCA and AQSIQ hurried to react to public sentiment turning against Ikea . \nThe pattern repeated itself in September. Samsung initially resisted extending its recall of exploding Galaxy Note 7 smartphones in China. It explained that the Chinese-sold phones used different batteries from those around the world, even as several cases of exploding batteries were fluttering around Chinese social media. A CCA deputy secretary said China had always opposed double standards and Samsung was ignoring the safety of Chinese consumers. Samsung later included China in its full recall as Chinese social media users turned against Samsung ssnlf . \nApple’s situation today in China isn’t the same. Apple hasn’t recalled iPhones elsewhere for faulty batteries, and the problem appears minor and not related to safety. But the tide could turn against Apple if enough consumers complain that the iPhone’s steep price in China isn’t commensurate with quality. \nThe China Consumers Association has built its reputation on fighting perceived double standards in China, and on calling out foreign companies for not respecting their Chinese consumers. Apple could be another target. ",

      "text": "In July of this year, Apple and CEO, Tim Cook , celebrated one billion iPhone sales to date, saying , “iPhone has become one of the most important, world-changing and successful products in history. It’s become more than a constant companion. iPhone is truly an essential part of our daily life and enables much of what we do throughout the day.”\nAlthough that figure represents consumers who have purchased multiple phones since Steve Jobs first introduced the innovative product back in 2007, the sheer volume would mean that one out of seven people on the entire planet has had an iPhone in their pocket during the last nine years.\nYes, the design and attributes have shifted to meet both consumer need and Apple’s vision for the future, but the core tenets have remained relatively the same. In fact, the speed and pace at which Apple innovates remains one of its biggest issues with the public. They want to be wowed during every keynote address. They want a device that changes the way we live and communicate. Most of all, they want the next iPhone.\nBut many would be surprised to learn that this iteration of the Apple iPhone is already 33 years in the making and not as nubile as it appears.\nNorman Seeff It has been well-documented that Apple’s early years were marked by infighting between co-founder, Steve Jobs, and the company’s board of directors over failed product launches and overzealous thinking as it related to its earliest product launches – specifically the ill-fated Lisa computer – the first commercial computer with a graphical user interface that would finally make computers usable by people with no special training.\nNot only did the Lisa carry a $10,000 USD price tag, but it was ultimately what led to Jobs shifting his attention to the “Macintosh” project before his untimely firing in 1985.\nAlthough this was a tumultuous time for Steve Jobs, his eyes were always on the future.\n\nDuring a 1983 talk at the International Design Conference in Aspen, Jobs actually described his desire to create a product that one could argue was what would become the iPhone/iPad years later, stating , “Apple’s strategy is really simple. What we want to do is we want to put an incredibly great computer in a book that you can carry around with you and learn how to use in 20 minutes. That’s what we want to do and we want to do it this decade. And we really want to do it with a radio link in it so you don’t have to hook up to anything and you’re in communication with all of these larger databases and other computers.”\nGetty At the time, Apple had been engaged in planning and designing products which they hoped would revolutionize communication. The man tasked with heading up the initiative, Hartmut Esslinger, had come to Apple after working with Sony on their Trinitron and WEGA ranges of televisions and quickly made an impression on Steve Jobs with his unabashed criticisms of the company and their shared desire to create a universal “design language” for Apple.\n“He asked me what I thought of Apple,” Esslinger recalled . “I said it was a cool idea, but bad design. Internally, Steve could already see that they had problems. He didn’t like that I said the products were incredibly ugly and wasteful in production. But when I explained he understood. He said that Apple would do a design competition, which I won. After that it turned out the internal designers were not good enough, so he put me in charge to revamp the entire design effort in Apple – out of the engineers’ hands and working directly with him.”\nCreative Commons Esslingen made an impression by introducing his “Snow White” aesthetics on the Apple IIc whose vertical and horizontal lines were represented for both decoration and ventilation purposes and ultimately became the hallmark aesthetic for computers from Apple for over a decade.\nDuring this period of rapid growth where seemingly no product was deemed “too out there,” Esslinger began working on Apple’s first attempt at peer-to-peer communication through a headset exchange on a prototype commonly referred to as the “MacPhone.”\nMashable Part stylus-operated tablet and part corded landline, the design was the result of stated desires between Steve Jobs and Apple CEO, John Sculley, who recognized that there would eventually be a paradigm shift in the way people talked to each other.\n“He was not a drawer, he was a great visionary but he couldn’t draw,” Sculley said of his work relationship with Steve Jobs. “I could draw, I had studied design. So Steve would describe it to me, I’d draw it out. The best definition of a genius is someone who sees the obvious 20 years ahead of the rest of us.”\nMashable In the early ’80s, the telephone market was dominated by the Western Electric model which was the most popular telephone of the 20th century. According to The Atlantic , “It’s the phone you think of when you think of telephones, and its silhouetted handset shape remains the universal icon for ‘phone’—even on your iPhone’s telephone app.”\nAlthough Apple was still in its relative infancy as a company, all of their earliest products were far from the status quo. Thus, the MacPhone would be nothing like the aforementioned Western Electric model and did much more than just connect two people.\nRenderings and prototypes reveal a device with touchscreen capabilities and a check-writing “app” which fit Steve Jobs’s desire to innovate. Similarly, its outward visual aesthetics – like minimal surface texture, no paint, minimal transitional angles and solitary Apple logo badge with seamless inlay into the design – fit Esslinger’s vision for how Apple products should look.\nOn paper and in the prototype phase, it was seemingly the perfect marriage of form and function.\n\nAs Steve Jobs noted at his keynote address in 1983, the company was slated to dedicate over $50 million USD to research and development that year. It’s unknown to this day if millions of dollars were spent on developing the MacPhone, or if perhaps not a single dollar was spent after Esslinger’s prototype was unveiled.\nOne has to consider that a simple landline product wasn’t forward-thinking enough and that the impulse to create an “enhanced” product couldn’t be realized with technology that was in place at the time. After all, in order to serve any significant purpose, the early ’80s MacPhone would have needed a built-in modem for transferring data to other phones or computers and in 1983 the internet was over a decade away from widespread consumer adoption.\nOver the years, Esslinger has referred to his MacPhone as a “show car” as a means to illustrate what was possible in the future – not unlike what BMW did with its Vision Next 100 series of vehicles .\nIn an interview , Esslingen seemed to suggest that Steve Jobs’s departure from Apple during this key segment of innovation could have been the major reason why the MacPhone never left the prototype phase. But when Jobs returned, he reignited the spirit of the original design when technology finally caught up.\n\n“I think what Steve had, compared to all the others, was the courage that he envisioned that intelligent technology would go into everything,” Esslingen said. “He was also not really singling out computers. The iPod, iPhone, iPad are a logical continuation of his way of thinking and doing. What also helped at his return, was to converge digital technology with entertainment and content into digital consumer electronics, Sony was asleep; Samsung just copied Sony; Phillips didn’t know what to do. But Steve understood—and understands—that both technology and aesthetics are a means to do something else on a higher level.”\n",

      "text": "Apple could lower its cut of subscription fees on video apps Going from (mostly 70/30) split to 85/15 could benefit developers and customers. Share Save \nEarlier this year Apple sweetened the split with iOS developers on subscriptions , by promising to halve its usual 30 percent cut -- once a user has been signed up for a year. Now, Bloomberg reports rumors that the company will move to an 85/15 split for all subscription video apps, with no time restriction. That could make partners and customers alike happy, since some services like Spotify , Netflix and YouTube have tacked on an extra buck or two whenever customers sign up via iTunes, just to cover the extra costs. \nIf it happens, this could also help Apple snag video services to be a part of its new TV app . The just-revealed app has yet to launch officially, the Apple TV is still lacking direct access to Amazon Prime subscription videos, and Netflix has said it won't be a part of the TV guide and its Watch Now menuing. Even if the extra bucks fails to make Netflix friendlier, it could be good for other services considering billing via iTunes vs. being sold as add-ons for services like Prime or Sling TV.",

      "text": "5332919 \n\niPhone 7 and 7 Plus come in a variety of colors including a new black model. Image source: Apple. \nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has set a difficult bar for itself. \nIt can put up numbers that most companies would be thrilled to have and still be considered a failure based on past results. That’s what’s happening with the release sales for the new iPhone 7. Apple has managed to get a seemingly impressive number of customers to buy its latest phones, according to analysis from Consumer Intelligence Research Partners (CIRP), but the iPhone 7/7 Plus launch still lags behind the company’s most-successful release. \nSince the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus launched on Sept. 23, CIRP estimates that 73% of iPhone buyers in the United States purchased one of the two new models. That seems like a very high number, even for a year with a new model number (as opposed to the “s” years which involve a lesser upgrade), but for Apple it’s only a middling result. \nCIRP Partner said Josh Lowitz, in a press release: \nThe iPhone 7 and 7 Plus launch falls between the wildly successful iPhone 6 and 6 Plus launch in 2014, and the somewhat disappointing launch of the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus in 2015…The combined share for the 7 and 7 Plus launch is up slightly from the 71% share for the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus in 2015, and down considerably from the 81% share for the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus in 2014. The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus benefited from a new form factor, a larger screen, and the introduction of the even larger and premium-priced Plus model. \nImage source: CIRP. There is good news for Apple \nEven though the amount of people choosing to buy the new models (rather than a still-available older one) has dropped from the 2014 highs, the company has managed to keep the same percentage of users (about one third) buying the bigger, more-expensive Plus model. That’s up from around 25% who opted for the larger, pricier phone in 2014. \n“Average selling price and gross margins suffered with the launch of the iPhone SE earlier this year, which continues to account for a meaningful percentage of sales. We expect the strength of the higher-priced Plus phones will boost average selling prices and margins,” Lowitz said. Switching from Android was a factor \nOddly enough the percentage of Android users switching to iPhone 7 was sort of the opposite of the overall sales pattern. The number of Android users who switched to the 7 and 7 plus came in at 17%. That’s better than the 6 and 6 plus (12%), but worse than the 6s and 6s Plus (26%). \n“The two more successful iPhone launches in the last three years were driven by existing loyal iPhone owners who upgrade to a new iPhone model, and rely less on Android owners who switch to an iPhone,” said CIRP Partner Mike Levin. “When Apple launched the less compelling iPhone 6S and 6S Plus models in 2015, existing iPhone owners essentially sat out the upgrade cycle.” It’s hard to be upset about any of this \n73% of Apple customers upgrading to the newest, most expensive phones is still pretty impressive. Despite numerous internal upgrades, in reality it’s hard to think Apple will hit its peaks with any model that does not have a noticeable physical change over earlier iPhones — such as with the 6 and 6 Plus. \nIn this case, the 7 and 7 Plus have some minor physical differences from the various 6 models, as well as the expected improved processors, cameras, and more storage on the entry-level models, but they just aren’t that different from their predecessors. Apple has trained people to upgrade every year, but they have also taught some value-seeking buyers that older models get cheaper when new ones come out. \nThese are good numbers which nearly any other company would be happy to be able to deliver. Apple may not have delivered an unquestioned grand slam, but it has served up something between a home run and a stand-up triple. \nForget the 2016 Election: 10 stocks we like better than Apple Donald Trump was just elected president, and volatility is up. But here’s why you should ignore the election: \nInvesting geniuses Tom and David Gardner have spent a long time beating the market no matter who’s in the White House. In fact, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, Motley Fool Stock Advisor , has tripled the market.* \nDavid and Tom just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now… and Apple wasn’t one of them! That’s right — they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. \nClick here to learn about these picks! \n*Stock Advisor returns as of November 7 , 2016 \nDaniel Kline owns shares of Apple.

      "text": "Apple introduced its new series of 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pro at its media event on October 27 featuring the new Touch Bar (Image Source: iFixit) Apple ’s new 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar has been taken apart by iFixit and it looks like the laptop is not so easy to fix, especially the Touch OLED bar. According to the report, the 13-inch model weighs 20 grams lighter (thanks to a smaller battery) and the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar also features a pair of side vents similar to the ones in previous generation Retina MacBook Pros.\niFixit found that the Touch Bar version comes with a smaller battery, lower speakers that do not line up with the grilles and a double-ended heat sink. According to iFixit, the power button on the laptop and the Touch ID are essentially the same on the Touch Bar which makes it difficult to replace one without having to change the entire logic board. The SSD, RAM and processor are soldered to the logic board, make it impossible to upgrade. The battery is also glued down.\nRead: Apple has a new book with ’20 years of product design’, and it costs $299\niFixit has given the new MacBook Pro a 1/10 repairability rating – which means it is not a friendly user-serviceable device. The Touch Bar assembly broke when it was tried to be removed, and iFixit has deemed it as a difficult part to replace.\nApple introduced its new series of 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pro at its media event on October 27, with the new models offering a brighter display. The new lineup features four Thunderbolt 3 USB-C ports and a larger Force trackpad.\n© The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd",

      "text": "Just when we thought were starting to get a handle on Apple's 2017 iPhone lineup, a new Bloomberg report relays that Apple's OLED supplier will likely not be able to meet the demand that Apple is anticipating when it releases what will presumably be called the iPhone 8 next September.\nThough there a handful of OLED suppliers out there, it's believed that Samsung inked a deal to be the exclusive provider of OLED panels for the iPhone 8. Having said that, Samsung's production capacity will reportedly be heavily constrained and may remain an ongoing issue in early 2018.\nContinue reading... \nTrending right now: \nMassive Pokemon Go December update will reportedly bring Pokemon trading and PvP battles Samsung might not be done with the Galaxy Note 7 Microsoft joins the Linux foundation and blows everyone’s mind ",

      "text": "Apple to reduce cut of in-app subscription payments for streaming video services By Jesse Hollington @jhollington ● 24 minutes ago \nApple is planning to reduce its portion of fees for streaming video service subscriptions sold via the App Store, Bloomberg reports, a move that appears to be aimed at encouraging tighter integration streaming video apps on the iOS and Apple TV platforms. This is the second big move in Apple’s attempts to adjust its in-app subscription pricing models, after the company announced earlier this year that developers would see their share increase for every customer subscription that is retained beyond the first year. With this reported change, Apple will be giving streaming video apps such as Netflix, Hulu, and HBO access to the better deal — reducing Apple’s revenue share to 15 percent — right out of the gate in the first year, provided they integrate with Apple’s forthcoming TV app .",

      "title": "Apple patent shows Siri inside iMessage to help with scheduling, payments and more",
      "text": "Apple patent shows Siri inside iMessage to help with scheduling, payments and more Posted Tray.io raises a $5m Series A, led by Mosaic Ventures, to sort out the mess in the Cloud \nGoogle’s smart virtual helper Google Assistant is finding its way into everything from the company’s chat app Allo to Pixel smartphones and its Amazon Echo rival, Google Home. Now it appears that Apple is considering following suit in at least one of those areas. A newly unearthed Apple patent indicates the company is looking into integrating Siri into its own messaging platform, iMessage. \nThe patent explains how Siri could be used during a chat session to answer questions, schedule meetings, offer directions, provide the weather information, check movie times, book dinner reservations, complete financial transactions, and more. \nFor example, a user might ask Siri for help in scheduling a meeting that works with everyone’s schedules in a group chat, and the assistant could then tap into the participants’ calendar information to determine when they’re free or busy. \nIn this case, the assistant bot would show a selection of times when everyone could meet, and the people in the group chat could vote on the best date through an in-conversation poll. \nAnother example mentioned in the patent application, is the ability to use Siri for person-to-person payments. The assistant could look to see which payment methods are installed on each user’s device, and then pick a selection of options the sender of the payment could choose from. This could help ease the problem of not knowing whether to send someone money through PayPal, Venmo or Square Cash, though it seems it could also be used with Apple Pay, if the company desired. \nThe virtual assistant is described as using semantic analysis to understand when it’s being called up in the conversation, plus it knows when its help with a task only needs to be seen by a single individual, instead of the entire group chat. It will then present itself to the conversation participants accordingly. \nIn typical Apple fashion, consideration is given to how users could maintain control over their personal information when Siri is available in iMessage chats. It sounds like one idea suggested by this patent would be to have some sort of opt in/opt out toggle switch, similar to how Apple allows users to turn off ad tracking in iOS’s Privacy options. \nAnd the patent states that “such collection [of personal information] should only occur after receiving the informed consent of the users.” \nWhile a patent application isn’t an indication of a feature that’s actually in development, this one is notable because the trend toward chats and computing that’s augmented by bots doesn’t appear to be going away anytime soon. There are a growing number of virtual helpers available, like Google Assistant, Amazon Alexa, Apple’s Siri, as well as Facebook Messenger bots, and those on other messaging platforms. \nApple rival Samsung also just acquired a next-gen Siri like assistant called Viv, to better compete. And Apple has been buying up machine learning startups itself, though it missed one earlier competitor called Emu, which sold to Google , which could have brought the above capabilities to iMessage given its focus on integrated assistance in chat sessions. \nIf we’re going to spend more time talking with bots, it makes sense that Apple would want to leverage Siri in its own messaging service – especially now that Siri can pull up information from not only Apple’s own services, like its calendaring app, but those from third-parties as well. 0",

      "text": "Reddit \nWhile there had been speculation that Apple might pick up sales from Samsung after its disastrous Note 7 launch , with KGI estimating that Apple could pick up an additional 5-7M orders , this doesn’t appear to be the case. The latest numbers from Gartner suggest that it is Chinese brands that saw the benefit. \nThe September 2 recall of the Note 7 saw Samsung’s Q3 market share fall year-on-year from 23.6% to 19.2%, its worst performance ever, creating an opportunity for other brands to pick up the slack – but the iPhone didn’t manage to do so … \nGartner reports that the iPhone actually saw a year-on-year fall in its own market share, from 13% to 11.5% in the same period, despite the smartphone market as a whole growing by 5.4%. Apple’s iPhone sales continued to fall in the third quarter of 2016, with a 6.6 percent decline. Apple accounted for 11.5 percent of the global smartphone market, its lowest share since the first quarter of 2009. Apple’s sales fell by 8.5 percent in the U.S. and by 31 percent in China, two of its biggest markets. The iPhone 7 struggled to stimulate replacement sales. \nThis performance also saw Huawei’s increasing move into the premium market help it close the gap on Apple, reducing Apple’s lead from 5.3% last year to 2.8% this year. \nThe real winners were two Chinese brands, Oppo and BKK, each of which came close to doubling their market share. “China led the growth in the smartphone market in the third quarter of 2016,” said Anshul Gupta , research director at Gartner. “Sales of smartphones in China grew by 12.4 percent, and the vendors who most successfully exploited the sales opportunities there were Oppo and BBK Communication Equipment. In Oppo’s case, 81 percent of its smartphone sales came from China, while BBK accounted for 89 percent of smartphones sales in China. These two vendors also grew strongly in India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Russia,” he added. \nNone of this is likely to cause too many sleepless nights in Cupertino, however. While Apple may be losing ground in market share, it still takes home almost all the profits in the industry. Guides",

      "text": "Apple   Posted Snapchat’s Spectacles vending machine lands in Santa Monica \nApple has opened up registration for its Hour of Code workshops in partnership with Code.org. This year, Apple will host Hour of Code workshops every day for one week — in conjunction with Computer Science Education Week — from December 5 to December 11 at all of its nearly 500 Apple retail stores across the world. In the past, Apple offered just one day’s worth of workshops. \nApple’s workshops will teach the basics of CS, as well as offer an introduction to Swift Playgrounds, an iPad app for learning how to write Swift code . Apple has also created some tools for educators to help them bring Hour of Code into schools and community centers, including a guide with coding lesson ideas and group activities. \n“Hour of Code embodies our vision for Apple stores as a place for the community to gather, learn and be entertained,” Apple SVP of Retail Angela Ahrendts said in a press release. “We’re proud to introduce the Swift Playgrounds app into the workshops and honored to again work side-by-side with Code.org on this incredibly important initiative. Hour of Code is one of the absolute highlights of the year for both our teams and the families that visit our stores.” Related Articles Code.org introduces Frozen and Star Wars-themed courses Tim Cook, Mark Zuckerberg and others urge Congress to fund K-12 computer science education Apple looks ahead with the new MacBook Pro \nAs part of Apple’s $100 million commitment to provide underserved schools with technology, Apple is also making it possible for ConnectED schools to host their own Hour of Code workshops. \nIn the past year, Apple has stepped up its commitment to education. In June, Apple launched coding camps for kids in its stores and donated 54,500 iPads to students and teachers in September. \nApple has participated in Code.org’s Hour of Code since 2014, but it’s not the only one participating in Hour of Code. Earlier this week, Microsoft announced its Minecraft-inspired coding tutorial for students and teachers. Featured Image: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images 0",

      "text": "An Apple patent published on Thursday hints at a future nobody asked for: more Siri!\nThe patent illustrates texting conversations in which Siri would slide in when it may be of assistance. It would help with tasks like scheduling a get-together, figuring out everyone's ETA to a destination and making payments.\nSiri scheduling a meeting Source: United States Patent and Trademark Office \"While current systems enable users to communicate and perform tasks, users are required to manually perform the tasks,\" the patent states . It also includes examples of tasks Siri would do for you, like \"scheduling a meeting, performing a financial transaction, determining an estimated time of arrival, providing directions, providing weather information, alerting a user of relevant information, etc.\"\nIf you think that might require sacrificing your privacy , you would be correct. In order for Siri to accomplish any of the aforementioned tasks, you would need to grant the virtual assistant access to some of your personal data, including your location, your calendar details and your financial apps.\nSiri checking on arrival time at the destination Source: United States Patent and Trademark Office The feature itself isn't groundbreaking — a slew of bots have been designed to help accomplish tasks like these in a casual messaging format. But this feature would end the need for an iPhone user to use outside bots and instead opt-in to an interjecting Siri.\nThe good news for people who think Siri constantly chiming in sounds obnoxious as hell: A published patent is not a very good indicator of whether a feature or product will come to market. But it does prove Apple is brainstorming ways for Siri to be more involved in your life. It's like Her , only if Joaquin Phoenix hated \"her.\"",

      "text": "Flip \nApple probably has big plans for the iPhone 8, which is expected to be the name of the tenth anniversary edition of the iPhone, and the company has been rumored to be ready to make the switch to OLED displays. With this tech, which is already used by its major rivals, it hopes to attract a larger number of customers to its smartphone. However, supply for such displays is a big issue for the U.S. firm, according to Bloomberg . Image Credit: Veniamin Geskin / Twitter OLED constraint to continue into 2018 \nFor Apple, the problem is that the production capacity with its four main suppliers of such components is not sufficient for all the new iPhones next year. The constraints are expected to continue into 2018, says Bloomberg, citing people familiar with the matter. \nProduction of OLED screens is more difficult compared to LED screens. For this reason, Apple is at the mercy of suppliers that manufacture the displays in mass quantities, notes Bloomberg. Samsung Display, Japan Display, LG Display Co. and Sharp Corp. are the four largest producers of OLED screens. \nDan Panzica, a supply chain analyst at IHS Markit, said, “Apple has already figured in there will be high demand for the OLED model and they’ve also figured out there will be constraints to these panels.” \nSupply constraints are expected due to the combined effect of Apple’s stringent quality requirements and the difficulty of producing OLED panels, the analyst says. What options does Apple have? \nAn analyst at Creative Strategies, Ben Bajarin, notes that display technology still plays an important role in consumers’ smartphone buying decision. Apple used new display features as iPhone selling points in the past as well. For instance, in 2010, the company introduced its Retina Display with the iPhone 4, and in 2012, it introduced its first display size increase with the iPhone 5. \n“There is all this talk about OLEDs, but I’m not at all sure about their future,” Sharp President Tai Jeng Wu told reporters recently. “We need to work on developing the technology, but whether we can succeed remains to be seen.” \nSamsung is working hard to become the sole supplier for the new displays next year. It is possible that the South Korean company will not be able to make enough displays owing to low yield rates and rising demand for the iPhone. Thus, Apple might have no other option but to use OLED in just one version of the next-gen iPhone 8 or even push back adoption of the technology , says Bloomberg.",

      "title": "Report: iOS devices have a higher failure rate than Android devices",
      "text": " \n\nApple just took another hit in the battle against its biggest rival, Google. According to the “State of Mobile Device Performance and Health” report issued by Blancco Technology Group for the third quarter (Q3) of the year, iPhones and iPads are failing at a rate of 62 percent worldwide. In comparison, the failure rate of Android devices stands at 47 percent.\nOut of all iOS devices, the iPhone 6 has experienced the highest failure rate (13 percent), followed by the iPhone 6s (9 percent) and the 5s (9 percent).\nThe report also states that apps crash three times as often on iOS devices compared to Android. According to the report, apps crashed on 65 percent of the surveyed iPhones and iPads, which is significantly worse than the 25 percent of Android devices reported to have crashed.\nSee also: Android achieves record 87.5 percent of global smartphone shipments in Q3 2016 2 weeks ago Over on the Android side, the affordable LeEco Le 2 tops the list of devices with the highest failure rate (13 percent). It’s closely followed by Xiaomi’s Redmi 3S and Redmi Note 3 (9 percent each), while Samsung’s Galaxy S7 Edge occupies 4th place with 5 percent.\nWhen it comes to apps, iOS users experience the most issues when using Instagram (14 percent), Snapchat (12 percent), and Facebook (9 percent). These three apps reportedly crash the most frequently of all on iOS devices, followed by Pokemon Go, Facebook Messenger and Google.\nWhen it comes to Android, the situation is a bit different. The apps that crash the most and cause the most frustration for Android users are IMS Service (32 percent), Address Book (12 percent), and Google Play Services (10 percent). Interestingly, none of the apps that crash the most appear in both platforms’ top ten list.\nAny thoughts regarding this report? Have you experienced any major performance issues with your Android device?",

      "text": "Graphics: Intel Iris Graphics 540 Ports: two Thunderbolt 3 \nBuy Now: $1,499 \nAfter the initial excitement of the event faded, many Mac enthusiasts voiced concerns about whether the Touch Bar models were “pro” enough. For creative professions, the lack of variety of ports (for starters, there’s no SD card slot), non-gamer-friendly graphics cards , and a max 16GB of RAM (which is only available on 15-inch models) simply wasn’t good enough. Plus, at such a premium price (starting at $1,799), there are more value-for-money Windows options to buy. \nAnd while the Touch Bar is beautiful, functional and full of promise, many early reviews are saying it isn’t quite a Pro-level feature . It works well with apps like Safari, Messages, Photos, Photoshop and, as shown at the Apple event, djay Pro. But as of yet, it’s not completely customizable, and for the average MacBook user, although neat, it’s not necessarily a game-changer. \nAt $400 dollars less, the 13-inch MacBook Pro sans Touch Bar is the “responsible” option. It hasn’t garnered the same flack as the Touch Bar models because, quite simply, it isn’t trying to be a “professional” laptop — just a much better MacBook Air. If you’re someone who has been waiting several years to upgrade their MacBook Pro, or MacBook Air, this is the laptop you’ve been waiting for.",

      "text": "Apple design chief Jony Ive says his company had no choice but to release a book detailing some of its product designs over the last two decades.\nSpeaking to cultural site Dazed in an interview published this week, Ive said that the company “had a responsibility to…archive” some of its best designs. He noted that Apple aapl has spent the last eight years developing the book it announced this week, Designed by Apple in California , and felt it was only right to release it to the world.\n“Honestly, it felt more of an obligation than something that we felt really compelled to do,” said Ive. “The reason for that, and I guess it's a fairly obvious one, is that as designers, we are far more interested in and consumed by the future; in what doesn't exist yet. But we've been working together for 20, 25 years, and it felt like the right and appropriate thing to do. You get a sense of what we've learned as a team and of how technology is evolving.”\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune's technology newsletter \nThe coffee table tome details the company’s product design from the 1998 iMac to the 2015 Pencil. While it’s mainly a big picture book, it also includes mention of the materials and design philosophies Apple employed to create its many iconic products. Dedicated to late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, the book comes in two sizes, priced at $199 for the smaller version and $299 for the bigger option.\nIn a statement accompanying the book, Ive said that he wanted it to be “a resource of students of all design disciplines.” In his interview with Dazed, which was earlier discovered by 9to5Mac, he explained in more detail the design philosophy that he believes, makes Apple’s products aesthetically appealing.\n“What we try to do is get to a point where it seems almost undesigned, where it seems so obvious that an alternative would seem contrived and not rational,” he said. “To get to that point of that 'perceived inevitability' is extremely difficult.”\nFor more about Apple’s iPhone 7, watch: \nIve then shifted his attention to other topics, including Jobs, the man for whom the book was made. He said they worked well together and took a holistic approach to design.\n“It's an entire approach, an entire attitude towards the work,” Ive said. “I think it was the all-consuming nature of it being about the product. It begins and ends with the product and if your absolute and complete focus is sincerely to try and make the very best product, then all of the other issues tend to resolve themselves.”",

      "text": "B&H claims Apple's BeatsX earbuds will go on sale Dec. 16 By Thursday, November 17, 2016, 07:41 am PT (10:41 am ET) Apple will finally launch its BeatsX earbuds —equipped with the company's proprietary W1 wireless chip —on Dec. 16, according to retailer B&H. A listing on B&H's website was pointed out by AppleInsider reader Bryce. Apple has never given an official release date for the earbuds, except that they should ship sometime before Christmas. Indeed B&H's date could just be a reasonable prediction —but Apple would presumably share information with retailers when it's ready, especially for a product that isn't supposed to be a major secret. For full disclosure, B&H is an AppleInsider partner, most notably in our Mac Price Guide . While also working with third-party hardware, the W1 chip allows for quicker pairing with Apple devices, and in fact several of them simultaneously thanks to iCloud. The chip also offers extreme range, possibly up to 400 feet or more in the case of the Beats Solo3 Wireless, the first headphones with the technology. So far, the only shipping products with the W1 include the Solo3 Wireless and the Powerbeats3 Wireless . Apple's self-branded AirPods have been delayed, though they might finally arrive later this month . Topics:",

      "title": "Apple automatically uploading iPhone call logs to iCloud, forensics firm says [u]",
      "text": "Apple automatically uploading iPhone call logs to iCloud, forensics firm says [u] By Thursday, November 17, 2016, 06:37 am PT (09:37 am ET) Any iPhone user with iCloud Drive enabled is having their call logs automatically uploaded to Apple servers —without their consent, and whether or not they have backups enabled, a Russian security firm said on Thursday. [Updated with statement from Apple] The uploads happen \"almost in real time, though sometimes only in a few hours,\" Elcomsoft CEO Vladimir Katalov told Forbes . The logs are said to include FaceTime calls as well, and in the case of iOS 10, missed calls from third-party apps like Skype and WhatsApp. iPhone owners can stop the uploads by disabling iCloud Drive, Katalov noted, but this cuts off other iCloud-related features and can stop some apps from working. The data could potentially be useful to government agencies with warrants or other legal access. Officially, though, Apple says the only iCloud data it can provide to agencies includes email logs and content, text messages, photos, documents, contacts, calendars, bookmarks, and iOS device backups. Apple also says it doesn't hold onto FaceTime call data for more than 30 days, but Elcomsoft said it was able to extract call logs going back over four months. Presumably, deleting a call from an iPhone's logs would also delete that from the iCloud Drive backup. Apple mentions call histories being included in iCloud backups as part of security whitepaper , but it's likely that most people haven't seen the document. iOS forensics expert Jonathan Zdziarski suggested to Forbes that the tracking is likely just an oversight related to the handoffs needed for Apple's calling technology, which for instance allows people to seamlessly shift between devices. \"They need to be able to sync a lot of that call data,\" he said. \"I suspect whatever software engineer wrote that part of it probably decided to just go and stick that data in your iCloud Drive because that's kind of what it's purpose is.\" Apple could theoretically add end-to-end encryption to iCloud, but this might create even more conflict with U.S. spy and law enforcement agencies, which are already upset about their inability to break into iOS devices . The company stores the keys for iCloud accounts at its U.S. datacenters, allowing them to serve up (readable) data on demand. Update: An Apple spokesman has provided a statement to AppleInsider : \"We offer call history syncing as a convenience to our customers so that they can return calls from any of their devices. Apple is deeply committed to safeguarding our customers' data. That's why we give our customers the ability to keep their data private. Device data is encrypted with a user's passcode, and access to iCloud data including backups requires the user's Apple ID and password. Apple recommends all customers select strong passwords and use two-factor authentication.\" Topics:",

      "text": "Have you ever wondered what it takes to build apps for Apple’s devices? Why don’t you head over to one of the company’s official retail stores and find out for yourself. Apple has announced today that it’s going to be hosting free “Hour of Code” workshops at its stores starting early next month. Registrations are now open for the workshops that will be held between December 5th and December 11th at all of its 487 retail stores across the globe. Attendees will receive an introduction of the company’s new Swift Playgrounds coding app for the iPad. “Hour of Code embodies our vision for Apple stores as a place for the community to gather, learn and be entertained,” says Angela Ahrendts, senior vice president of retail at Apple. She added that Apple is proud to introduce its Swift Playgrounds app for coding into the workshops.\nThis isn’t the first time that Apple is conducting coding workshops at its retail stores across the globe. It has actually been hosting Hour of Code workshops since 2013 during Computer Science Education week to teach kids and students about coding using Code.org’s programming tools. Code.org is a non-profit website aimed at helping people learn how to code.\nThose who are interested in attending one of these workshops at an Apple store near them can now head over to the Hour of Code page on Apple’s website to register. Spots tend to fill up quickly so you better not waste any time if you’re really interested in attending a workshop.\nFiled in",

      "text": "Reddit \nApple has reportedly asked key iPhone manufacturer partners, namely Foxconn and Pegatron, to investigate ways to bring the iPhone assembly supply chain into the United States. Today, all iPhones (and almost all Apple products) are manufactured and assembled in China. The Nikkei report says Foxconn is actively researching ways to make iPhones in the US although Pegatron apparently refused Apple’s request over cost concerns. A source is quoted as saying that domestic production of iPhones means increasing costs by “more than double”. \nApple has received some criticism over the years for its dependence on Chinese manufacturing but the issue has come into the limelight recently as Donald Trump, now US President elect, claimed that he will force Apple to build its “computers and things” in the United States. \nLike many Trump policies, to what extent he intends to put that plan into action is unknown although it still raises uncertainty about Apple’s supply chain. The report says sources in the Apple supply chain believe Trump will push Apple to make some percentage of iPhones in the United States. Whatever the reality, it makes sense for Apple to explore domestic iPhone production and be necessarily prepared for any eventuality. \nThe report does not say that Apple, Foxconn or Pegatron have any current plans to begin US manufacturing. Whilst Foxconn is conducting the research, it is also not known what will the ruling will be on its practicality. The report notes that Foxconn’s chairman is not very enthusiastic about the idea of moving Apple’s manufacturing line away from China. \nAs it stands today, Apple assembles almost everything it sells in China; iPhones, iPads and Macs. The exception is the low-volume specialist (and expensive) Mac Pro which Apple makes in a US factory. In the past, Apple CEO Tim Cook has dismissed the possibility of making iPhones in the US due to a brain drain of talent and knowledge in the American workforce. Guides",

      "text": "Elcomsoft, a digital forensics company based in Russia, has claimed that iPhones secretly send call history to Apple’s services. It says that this happens automatically if iCloud is enabled on the device. Data is said to be uploaded in most cases without notifying users or even giving them a choice. The data that’s uploaded to Apple’s services is claimed to contain a list of all calls made and received on the iPhone. The list apparently includes dates, times, call duration, and even entire phone numbers. Missed and bypassed calls are included as well. Elcomsoft CEO Vladimir Katalov says that users only need to have iCloud enabled for all of this data to be automatically uploaded to Apple’s servers. Apple is said to retain this data on its servers for up to four months. This can be of tremendous benefit to law enforcement agencies who may not be able to get this data from mobile carriers, they can also obtain this data through a user’s device if they have access to it.\nThe company mentions that it’s not just regular call logs that are being uploaded to Apple’s servers. The company is apparently storing logs for FaceTime voice and video calls as well. It’s of the view that this has been happening for both regular and FaceTime calls since iOS 8.2 which was released back in March last year.\niOS 10 is said to even sync logs of incoming missed calls made through third-party communication apps like WhatsApp, Skype, and Viber which rely on Apple Callkit to make the calls.\nApple has confirmed that call logs are synced with iCloud and says that this is done intentionally. “We offer call history syncing as a convenience to our customers so that they can return calls from any of their devices,” says a spokesperson for Apple, adding that ”Device data is encrypted with a user’s passcode, and access to iCloud data including backups requires the user’s Apple ID and password. Apple recommends all customers select strong passwords and use two-factor authentication.”\nFiled in",

      "text": "ZDNet Japan Dog & Bone Wetsuit topless and Splash44 retail package \nWhile the new Apple iPhone 7 Plus has an IP67 dust and water resistant rating, the Apple standard warranty does not cover water damage. If you plan to use your phone in a wet environment, and not just occasionally get it splashed, then you should consider one of these Dog & Bone cases. \nThe Wetsuit case is available for $89.95 in four different colors. It offers IP68 dust and water resistance with MIL-STD 810G two meter drop protection. It has an interesting approach to the display, which can be seen in later photos. \nThe Splash44 case doesn't increase the water resistance, but it does offer the same MIL-STD 810G two meter drop protection along with a tempered glass screen protector. The camera and Lightning port are also sealed up to try to improve the iPhone's water resistance. It is available in four color options for $59.95. Published: November 17, 2016 -- 15:21 GMT (15:21 GMT) \nCaption by: Matthew Miller Two pieces of the Dog & Bone Wetsuit case \nThe Wetsuit case is composed of a back piece and a front layer that snaps onto the display. There are very specific instructions provided inside the retail package that directs you to test out the case with a dummy insert piece prior to installing your own iPhone 7 Plus. \nYou need to make sure that everything seals properly and that you install your iPhone properly before trusting the case to keep your iPhone 7 Plus protected from the elements. Published: November 17, 2016 -- 15:21 GMT (15:21 GMT) \nCaption by: Matthew Miller Front piece with bright pink O-ring and openings \nDog & Bone placed a bright pink O-ring inside the front piece so that you can easily see it and verify its structural integrity before you snap it in place onto the back piece. \nAlso note that there is no plastic screen cover here on this case. It's topless so that you will interact directly on the display. You can purchase an optional tempered glass screen protector for more protection as well. Published: November 17, 2016 -- 15:21 GMT (15:21 GMT) \nCaption by: Matthew Miller Back piece of the Wetsuit case \nThe back piece has clear plastic covers over the flash and camera lenses. There is also a textured back and rigid side and corner designs on the back cover. Published: November 17, 2016 -- 15:21 GMT (15:21 GMT) \nCaption by: Matthew Miller iPhone 7 Plus mounted in the Wetsuit \nThere are openings for the front camera, speaker, and sensors. The case extends above the display to offer some protection in the case of slips or drops. Published: November 17, 2016 -- 15:21 GMT (15:21 GMT) \nCaption by: Matthew Miller Home button is still accessible \nWhile there is a small piece of plastic that extends over the top of the home button/fingerprint scanner, my experiences show that the fingerprint is still recognized quickly. It may not be quite as responsive as it is without a case, but it works every time. Published: November 17, 2016 -- 15:21 GMT (15:21 GMT) \nCaption by: Matthew Miller Lightning port cover \nThere is a door over the Lightning port to help keep your iPhone safe. I took my iPhone 7 Plus fishing once and after falling in the water I noticed water in the Lightning port that kind of messed things up for a bit. This cover should prevent such issues in the future. Published: November 17, 2016 -- 15:21 GMT (15:21 GMT) \nCaption by: Matthew Miller Large buttons for volume and ringer switch \nThe volume buttons work fine, but I did find that the ringer switch didn't give me much tactile feedback so I had to pay attention to the alert on the display to confirm what mode it was in. There is no indicator on the case to tell you which position you have selected. Published: November 17, 2016 -- 15:21 GMT (15:21 GMT) \nCaption by: Matthew Miller Clear covers over the rear cameras and flash \nEven though there is a protective cover over the cameras and flash, I did not experience any compromise on the photos and videos that I captured while having my iPhone 7 Plus mounted in the case. Published: November 17, 2016 -- 15:21 GMT (15:21 GMT) \nCaption by: Matthew Miller Back texture and orange frame \nThe Dog & Bone branding is found on the back of the case. There is a textured design on the back, but it's hard plastic and slides in and out of your pocket with ease. The raised colored frame piece improves the grip on your iPhone and looks good too. \nI was sent an electric orange color to test. You can also purchase a Wetsuit in silvertail (gray), blackest black, and oceana (teal).

You can choose whether or not to use the screen protector, but if you do use it make sure to first mount your iPhone in the case and then install the protector. \nThe eval unit is clear and orange in color, but you can also select purple, black, or pink as the highlight color of your case. The back is clear plastic so the color of your iPhone will show through as well. Published: November 17, 2016 -- 15:21 GMT (15:21 GMT) \nCaption by: Matthew Miller \nSimilar to the Wetsuit case, the camera lenses and flash have clear plastic covers. Published: November 17, 2016 -- 15:21 GMT (15:21 GMT) \nCaption by: Matthew Miller Left side buttons \nThe left buttons for the ringer switch and volume buttons are similar to the Wetsuit case. \nThe Splash44 case only increases the thickness of your iPhone 7 Plus 1.8 mm, from 7.3 mm to 9.1 mm so it is a nice case for those looking for some protection without added bulk. Published: November 17, 2016 -- 15:21 GMT (15:21 GMT) \nCaption by: Matthew Miller Bottom Lightning port cover \nThere is also a Lightning port cover as the Splash44 case attempts to provide some protection from the elements. Published: November 17, 2016 -- 15:21 GMT (15:21 GMT) \nCaption by: Matthew Miller Raised front edge \nThe clear soft silicone around the case is raised above the display to add some display protection.

      "title": "Apple: Top Hedge Funds' Activity For Q3",
      "text": "Apple's shares have struggled over the past month. \nThis is a list of notable buyers and sellers over the past quarter. \nPresident-elect Trump could provide a catalyst for the company with his tax plan. Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) share price has struggled over the past month. They reported Q3 earnings and investors were nervous about the future of China and its growth. The president-elect Donald Trump has added more fuel to the fire with his trade views, and now China has an open threat to cut/close iPhone sales within the country, even though coincidentally all iPhones are made in China. One possible positive note for Apple with Trump being president is his tax plan. Apple has more than $200 billion in cash overseas. The company has opted to let it sit there because of the hefty repatriation tax the U.S. has. Trump's tax plan isn't final, but big corporations could see a significant reduction in the repatriation tax burden. The following is a list of big hedge funds that bought or sold Apple this past quarter. It will be interesting to see next quarter positions for these hedge funds with now information that Trump is president-elect, and his views on trade and taxes. Notable Buyers Ken Fisher ( Fisher Asset Management ) : Ken had a minimal increase to his position at 57,000 shares. He now owns 11.3 million shares which equates to 2.4% of his portfolio. It is the fourth largest position in his portfolio. Daniel Loeb ( Third Point ) : This was a new position and he bought 2.5 million shares. The estimated average price bought at is $106, which would equate to $265 million. David Tepper ( Appaloosa Management LP ): David Tepper is back at owning Apple with his recent purchase of 800,000 shares. He has been in and out of this stock over the past 4 years. Steven Cohen ( Point72 Asset Management ) : Steven Cohen increased his position by 1644%. He now owns 1.92 million shares. It's also worth noting he has call contracts that allow him to purchase up to 250,000 additional shares at a specific date. Ray Dalio ( Bridgewater Associates ) : This is a small position for Ray Dalio, but he increased his position by 186% and now owns 346,600. Ray has also been in and out of the stock over the past 5 years. Notable Sellers David Einhorn ( Greenlight Capital ) : Einhorn decreased his position by 24% this quarter. He now owns 5.2 million shares valued at $567 million. Joel Greenblatt ( Gotham Asset Management ) : Greenblatt decreased his position by 41% or 319,404 shares. He still owns 459,757 shares, which isn't a major position within the portfolio.

Apple’s in a sales decline and there’s no help for the future because all Apple products arrive pre-failed.\n\nWriting for Barron’s, Alex Eule says “Apple iGlass is a Great Name, But It Won’t Help the Stock.” (Tip o’ the antlers to Philip Speicher.)\n\nGet it? iGlass? Eye Glass?\n\nEule wasn’t the only one to go to the iWell to dredge up that iGem. Gizmodo did, too. Of course, no one uses the singular “eyeglass” unless they’re a steampunk cosplayer looking for their missing monocle. So, we shall have to agree to disagree that it’s a “great” name. Probably doesn’t matter, though, since Apple stopped naming things with a lower-case “i” in the front six years ago.\n\nTo read this article in full or to leave a comment, please click here",

      "text": "Blog This \nApple® today opened registration for Hour of Code workshops at all 487 Apple retail stores worldwide, from December 5 through 11 in celebration of Computer Science Education Week. Among the most popular events at the Apple Store®, Hour of Code workshops teach the basics of computer science with Code.org’s programming tutorials. Apple and Code.org share the goal of giving every student the opportunity to learn computer science. This Smart News Release features multimedia.

(Photo: Business Wire) \n“Hour of Code embodies our vision for Apple stores as a place for the community to gather, learn and be entertained,” said Angela Ahrendts, Apple’s senior vice president of Retail. “We’re proud to introduce the Swift Playgrounds app into the workshops and honored to again work side-by-side with Code.org on this incredibly important initiative. Hour of Code is one of the absolute highlights of the year for both our teams and the families that visit our stores.” \n“Since we started Hour of Code in 2013, Apple has each year upped its participation and found ways to introduce more kids to computer science,” said Hadi Partovi, founder and CEO of Code.org. “The global footprint Apple offers through its stores and talented staff has reached tens of thousands of kids, and with the introduction of Hour of Code in Swift Playgrounds we can introduce coding to even more.” \nSwift Playgrounds \nThis year, Hour of Code programs at many Apple locations will include an introduction to Swift Playgrounds™, the free new app for iPad® that brings coding to life. The interactive interface of Swift Playgrounds encourages beginners to explore working with Swift™, the easy-to-learn programming language from Apple, used by professional developers to create world-class apps. \n“Coding is just like any language, the earlier you’re exposed the more successful you’ll be,” said Craig Federighi, Apple’s senior vice president of Software Engineering. “Whether at an Apple Store, in a classroom, or at home with an iPad, Swift Playgrounds brings real coding concepts to life and empowers the next generation with the skills they need to express their creativity.” \nA new Hour of Code challenge in Swift Playgrounds makes it easy for anyone to set up their own one-hour coding event, and for those continuing to build their coding skills on iPad, Swift Playgrounds adds a new Learn to Code 3 set of lessons and a companion Teacher Guide. \nHour of Code for Educators \nIn addition to in-store workshops, Apple has developed a series of tools to extend Hour of Code into schools and community centers, including a free facilitator guide offering lesson ideas, group activities and more. Apple Teacher, a free, professional self-paced learning program supporting and celebrating teachers in the US, has added resources, badging and recognition for learning and teaching coding with Swift Playgrounds on iPad. \nContinuing Apple’s $100 million commitment and ongoing partnership to provide 114 underserved schools with technology, services and support, Apple will provide materials and resources to assist ConnectED schools around the country to host their own Hour of Code workshops. \nApple revolutionized personal technology with the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984. Today, Apple leads the world in innovation with iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch and Apple TV. Apple’s four software platforms — iOS, macOS, watchOS and tvOS — provide seamless experiences across all Apple devices and empower people with breakthrough services including the App Store, Apple Music, Apple Pay and iCloud. Apple’s more than 100,000 employees are dedicated to making the best products on earth, and to leaving the world better than we found it. \nNOTE TO EDITORS: For additional information visit Apple’s PR website ( www.apple.com/newsroom ), or call Apple’s Media Helpline at (408) 974-2042. \n© 2016 Apple Inc.

      "text": "Apple iPhone 7 Plus vs LG V20 Apple iPhone 7 Plus vs LG V20 Posted: 49 min ago , by Victor H. Comments Introduction In the battle for the best big phone, the Apple iPhone 7 Plus is one device that you cannot overlook.Apple’s iPhone is not only the single best-selling phone out there, it also features one of the most powerful chips ever on a phone, has for a long while been a trend-setter for mobile photography, and – apart from the now dead Nexus series – seems to be the only phone that gets latest updates to its platform quickly and reliably.This year, we see some Android manufacturers stepping up their game when it comes to software currency as well: the LG V20 is a big, 5.7-inch phone that in many ways rivals the iPhone 7 Plus, and – notably – it even comes with the latest version of Android, 7.0 Nougat, right out of the gate.Both featuring dual rear shooters, the two phones have high aspirations as cameras, as well as creativity and productivity machines. But it’s the little differences and nuances that really make each one of them stand out: the V20 with its hi-res audio aspirations and secondary screen will appeal to a certain niche of power users, while the 7 Plus has a more mainstream appeal. Let’s dive in the details to learn the whole story about these two. Design The iPhone 7 Plus features the more streamlined, elegant design, but it’s also a heavy phone with huge bezels. The LG V20 is built like a tank, but lacks in elegance and is not water-proof. Both the Apple iPhone 7 Plus and LG V20 are made of metal, but while the iPhone 7 Plus has a holistic metal construction, the V20 has a large metal back cover with plastic strips on the top and the bottom. And while both feel solidly put together, the iPhone is the one with the more refined design with less seams and more elegant curves, while the V20 feels more like separate pieces put together rather than one inherent whole.When speaking about big phones, or phablets, there are some with more manageable sizes and some truly gigantic ones. While the iPhone 7 Plus is one of the largest 5.5-inch phones out there, the LG V20 goes with an even larger, 5.7-inch display and ends up having an even bigger physical footprint than the iPhone. It’s taller, slightly wider and a hair thicker, slight differences that when considered all together are noticeable. Despite its smaller size, though, the iPhone is the heavier of these two rather weighty phones, and this heft is definitely an inconvenience if you walk with your phone in your pocket a lot.Looking at the details around the body of the two phones, the LG V20 has an interesting button on the side. It has one sole function: press it to pop up the back cover and get easy access to the removable battery. Not everyone needs that, but with all the recent stories about exploding phones and fires, it’s nice to be able to simply remove the battery, or swap it on the go for an emergency battery boost. The V20 has its volume buttons on the side, but it keeps the power key on its back. The round home button actually clicks and also doubles as a fingerprint scanner (just a tap is required for a fingerprint reading) that works quickly and reliably. And yes, there are two rear cameras on the V20, but more on that later, in the camera section.On the iPhone 7 Plus side, you have the familiar iPhone design with two important changes. The home key is no longer a physical button: nope, it does not physically travel and that clicking sensation you get when pressing it comes from the Taptic Engine, the vibration motor inside the iPhone. Is the feeling the same as pressing an actual physical key? Not really. Can you get used to it, though? We know we did easily enough to not consider it a problem, but not an improvement either. Then, there is the no-3.5mm jack situation: put simply, if you use the 3.5mm jack a lot, you’re clearly going to miss it, and the fact that there is a 3.5mm adapter in the box with the iPhone is a work-around, but not a remedy.There is one key new feature on the iPhone 7 Plus that is nowhere to be found on the LG V20: water-resistance. The 7 Plus is IP67-certified, meaning that it can be submerged in water up to 1 meter (3.3 feet) deep for as long as 30 minutes without sustaining any damage. The feature is there to protect the phone in case you accidentally drop it in water or leave it out in the rain for a short while, but it’s not officially meant as an excuse for you to film under water and take it on your surfing trips.",

      "text": "Stock indexes were mostly down modestly in early afternoon trading Wednesday, but Apple ( AAPL ) led a rebound in the Nasdaq. The former superstar of the mid-2000s also kept its fledgling new uptrend alive.\nApple raced 2.2% higher to 109.41, posting its biggest rise since its Sept. 14-15 breakout past a 110.33 buy point in a long bottoming base that features a cup with handle within the bigger pattern. The stock got as high as 110.09 intraday. The bullish move leaves the megacap tech very close to making a second breakout attempt.\nMonday's reversal showed that institutional support for the iPhone maker remains. However, the correct IBD method of buying Apple in this case is to first wait. That is, wait for the stock to reconfirm its strength by climbing back above the original 110.33 cup-with-handle buy point.\nThe Nasdaq composite gained 0.3%, countering losses of 0.4% in the Dow Jones industrials, 0.5% for the NYSE composite, and less than 0.3% for the S&P 500. Volume is running lower on both main exchanges vs. the same time Tuesday.\nSharp declines in generic drug, heavy construction, superregional banking, steel, cement and gold mining shares led the downside.\nApple's bottoming base stretches from an all-time high of 134.54 in the spring of 2015. This means that the global consumer tech play has been sitting out the market's rally to all-time highs as its top- and bottom-line growth slowed down in recent quarters. And in fact, institutions have been reluctant to buy with abandon since both profits and sales have actually fallen for three quarters in a row.\nFrom the perspective of its weekly chart, it could be that Apple simply needs more time to flesh out its long base-building work. Why? The left side of its large, saucerlike pattern took more than a full year to form. So, the right side of the base is just six months long. That shows a lack of visual symmetry in its current construction.\nAs a stock builds the right side and hits 52-week or multimonth highs, it can frequently get pushback by disgruntled shareholders who incorrectly bought at higher prices and have been waiting in the wings to sell their stake and get out with minimal losses or break even. This phenomenon, in IBD speak, is called \"overhead supply.\"\nAlso in the stock market today, Finisar ( FNSR ) led a rebound among telecom gear makers, rising 2.1% to 32.37 in light volume while surpassing a 31.52 buy point in a narrow five-week flat base.\nThat basing action coincides with the stock's successful rebound off the 10-week moving average near 28, which offers an excellent follow-on entry for existing shareholders.\nFinisar is now sharply extended from that bounce off the 10-week line.\nThe first and second pullbacks to the 10-week line, or to the 50-day moving average on a daily chart, also give IBD-style growth investors an opportunity to establish a new position. But it's only recommended when the market itself is in a healthy uptrend.\nIBD upgraded the market's current outlook to \"uptrend resumes\" on Nov. 9, a day after the largely unexpected (but not by our IBD/TIPP Poll!) Trump election win.",

      "text": "Loading the player... Stocks remained near session highs Tuesday going into the last hour of trade, as oil prices surged and tech stocks including Apple ( AAPL ) and Microsoft ( MSFT ) bounced back.\nThe Nasdaq led with a 1.1% gain as it retook its 50-day moving average, the S&P 500 added 0.6% and the Dow Jones industrial average was fractionally higher. Volume was tracking lighter on the NYSE and Nasdaq vs. the same time Monday.\nOil, gold miners and internet stocks spearheaded the advance in the stock market today. West Texas intermediate crude prices surged 5% to above $46 a barrel, as OPEC sought to save its deal to cut production.\nAmong blue chip winners, Microsoft and Verizon Communications ( VZ ) were up more than 2% each, followed by 1.5% or higher moves by Chevron ( CVX ) and Exxon Mobil ( XOM ).\nApple scored a 1.5% gain to create some distance from its 200-day moving average, which it tested during Monday's decline. The stock wasn't fazed by a late Monday regulatory filing that disclosed hedge fund Greenlight Capital cut its stake in the iPhone maker by nearly 1.7 million shares in Q3.\nNewspapers and generic drug makers underperformed, as did retailers -- despite better-than-expected October consumer spending data. Retail sales rose 0.8% in October, above projections for a 0.6% increase. Excluding autos, sales also rose 0.8%; excluding autos and gasoline, sales climbed 0.6%. Economists expected respective gains of 0.5% and 0.3%.\nHome Depot ( HD ) was the Dow's biggest loser, falling 4% to slide below its 50-day moving average in heavy volume. The stock is building a flat base with a potential buy point at 139.10. The home improvement retail giant reported Q3 results that topped views and raised its full-year earnings per share guidance to $6.33, meeting current estimates.\nOn the IBD 50, NetEase ( NTES ) leapt 5% after a buyback plan of up to $1 billion worth of its U.S. shares during the next 12 months. The Chinese online gaming stock is trying to recoup losses from 4% and 8% drops the past two weeks. Shares are 7% below the 50-day line and 15% off an Oct. 14 intraday high.\nStamps.com ( STMP ) scored a 5% gain as it pulls further away from a 100.42 buy point cleared Nov. 7 in brisk trade. It's now extended from that entry. The electronic postage provider earlier this month delivered a fourth straight quarter of triple-digit profit growth and revenue gains above 66%.\nRELATED:\nThe Case For A New Secular Bull Run In Stocks",

      "text": "MORE Posted 1 minute ago by iClarified · 93   has announced that free Hour of Code Workshops will be offered December 5 through 11 at every Apple Store. The company opened registration for the workshops today at 487 Apple retail stores worldwide in celebration of Computer Science Education Week. Among the most popular events at the Apple Store, Hour of Code workshops teach the basics of computer science with Code.org’s programming tutorials. Apple and Code.org share the goal of giving every student the opportunity to learn computer science.“Hour of Code embodies our vision for Apple stores as a place for the community to gather, learn and be entertained,” said Angela Ahrendts, Apple’s senior vice president of Retail. “We’re proud to introduce the Swift Playgrounds app into the workshops and honored to again work side-by-side with Code.org on this incredibly important initiative. Hour of Code is one of the absolute highlights of the year for both our teams and the families that visit our stores.”“Since we started Hour of Code in 2013, Apple has each year upped its participation and found ways to introduce more kids to computer science,” said Hadi Partovi, founder and CEO of Code.org. “The global footprint Apple offers through its stores and talented staff has reached tens of thousands of kids, and with the introduction of Hour of Code in Swift Playgrounds we can introduce coding to even more.” Swift Playgrounds This year, Hour of Code programs at many Apple locations will include an introduction to Swift Playgrounds™, the free new app for iPad that brings coding to life. The interactive interface of Swift Playgrounds encourages beginners to explore working with Swift, the easy-to-learn programming language from Apple, used by professional developers to create world-class apps.“Coding is just like any language, the earlier you’re exposed the more successful you’ll be,” said Craig Federighi, Apple’s senior vice president of Software Engineering. “Whether at an Apple Store, in a classroom, or at home with an iPad, Swift Playgrounds brings real coding concepts to life and empowers the next generation with the skills they need to express their creativity.”A new Hour of Code challenge in Swift Playgrounds makes it easy for anyone to set up their own one-hour coding event, and for those continuing to build their coding skills on iPad, Swift Playgrounds adds a new Learn to Code 3 set of lessons and a companion Teacher Guide. Hour of Code for Educators In addition to in-store workshops, Apple has developed a series of tools to extend Hour of Code into schools and community centers, including a free facilitator guide offering lesson ideas, group activities and more. Apple Teacher, a free, professional self-paced learning program supporting and celebrating teachers in the US, has added resources, badging and recognition for learning and teaching coding with Swift Playgrounds on iPad.Continuing Apple’s $100 million commitment and ongoing partnership to provide 114 underserved schools with technology, services and support, Apple will provide materials and resources to assist ConnectED schools around the country to host their own Hour of Code workshops.",

      "text": "Leon Neal/Getty Images Donald Trump has vowed to get \"Apple to start building their damn computers and things in this country, instead of in other countries,\" but that could mean your iPhone is about to get a whole lot more expensive, The Washington Post reports . Trump has long promised to put an end to the proliferation of Chinese-manufactured products in the U.S., and to do so he has floated instating a tax as high as 45 percent on Chinese goods. \"If [Trump] institutes a 35-percent penal tariff on every export from China, then most of what you buy at Walmart is 35 percent more expensive,\" Roger Entner of Recon Analytics explained. While some analysts say the tariff wouldn't necessarily trigger a parallel jump in prices, it would still make manufacturing iPhones significantly more expensive for Apple — and, in turn, for you to buy. A mere 15 percent tax could push iPhones up $50 in cost. That's not to mention the fact that China has warned of \"countermeasures\" if Trump tries to launch a trade war. But if Trump were to actually try to yank Apple's manufacturing from China altogether, it would spell an even bigger mess: To truly bring Apple's manufacturing back to the United States — meaning not just the final assembly of the phones and computers but the production of components by suppliers — would take tens of billions of dollars in new factory construction costs alone, Entner said. That doesn't consider the additional investments in education the United States would need to make to staff those factories [...] Considering the deficit in skilled U.S. workers, any plan to move Apple's manufacturing back to the United States probably would require hiring more foreign workers until enough Americans could be trained to take those jobs. All of this could be occurring against the backdrop of a trade-induced recession. As many as 4 million U.S. jobs would be lost as a result of Trump's trade war, and 3 million jobs would never be created, according to Moody's Analytics. [ The Washington Post ]",

      "text": "Mobility How to shoot and edit raw iPhone photos Using the right iOS and iPhone combination, Apple users can capture raw images using their smartphones. Here's how to get better photos from your iPhone. By Erik Eckel | November 17, 2016, 7:28 AM PST Google Plus Image: CNET \nApple's iOS 10 release enables better photo capture and image editing than any previous Apple operating system. Support for raw photography, which has been used by professional photographers for a long time, deserves the credit. Mated to a compatible iOS device, iOS 10 introduces the ability for a variety of iOS devices to capture raw photographs, typically using the DNG file format. More about Mobility Subscribe to TechRepublic's Mobile Enterprise newsletter \nSo-called raw photos retain more information than commonly used JPG files. DNG files record more image detail, including exposure, lighting, color, and other elements. The additional image information enables significantly enhanced editing capabilities using a variety of post-production tools, such as Apple's Photos app or Adobe's Lightroom . \nRunning iOS 10 and a compatible app, such as ProCam 4 ($4.99), Camera+ ($2.99), Lightroom (free and subscription versions), or Will Global's Manual ($3.99), users can capture raw photos. Apple states these iOS devices support raw photo capture using the device's back camera: iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, iPhone SE, and iPad Pro 9.7\". Take and edit raw photos using Lightroom on an iPhone 7 running iOS 10 Open Lightroom and permit Lightroom to access the device's camera and photos if you haven't already. Tap the Camera icon found in the bottom right-hand corner of the Lightroom app. Ensure the app is set to capture images as DNG files. An icon reading either JPG or DNG appears at the top center of the screen when taking pictures—tap the icon to change the setting using the File Format radio button that will appear. Once a DNG photo is created using Lightroom, the image can be edited using the Adobe application. Select Organize from the application's top center dropdown menu and tap Lightroom Photos. Tap the DNG photo you wish to edit. Use the supplied Crop, Presets, Edit, and Local Adjust icons to manipulate the photo, including exposure, color, white balance, temperature, tint, contrast, highlights, shadow, vibrance, and saturation. If you wish to edit the raw photo using Photos, transfer the Lightroom photo by selecting the image and tapping the Share icon. Select Save To Camera Roll, which places the file within the iOS device's photos. Edit the file using the familiar Apple Photos interface. \nSEE: The iPhone 7 Plus camera is 'Apple's best' but what does that mean? (CNET) \nAlternatively, an app such as Manual mated to iOS 10 and, in my case, an iPhone 7, places a variety of raw photo capture settings at your fingertips. In addition to supporting RAW files, Manual permits adjusting aperture to better specify the depth of field for a photograph, shutter speed, film speed (ISO), focus, and white balance. Once provided Camera Roll access, Manual automatically saves the images it records to the iOS device's photos storage. Summary \nLeveraging iOS 10 and a compatible iOS device and application, iPhone users can capture raw photos, which better support making everything from subtle to dramatic edits than do traditional JPG files. Whether an image requires a minor enhancement or a dramatic makeover, the iPhone's newfound raw photo support significantly expands the mobile device's capabilities.
