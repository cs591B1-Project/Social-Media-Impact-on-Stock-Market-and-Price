If you'd like to learn more... - Listen \nA Vancouver Island man says he’s been driving his car in fear for 15 months. \nGeoff Fawcett says he’s been waiting to get his 2007 Toyota Corolla repaired after receiving a recall notice from Toyota Canada in July 2015. His car needs a replacement airbag, part of the massive worldwide recall of defective Takata airbags. The notice warns of the front passenger airbag inflator potentially rupturing, sending metal shrapnel that could result in injury, even death. Story continues below \nTo minimize the risk, Toyota Canada is recommending passengers sit in the back seat until notified. \n“I feel very unsafe. You don’t know if you’ll have a little bump and metal fragments are going to come out at you. I mean they could even come my way as well as the passenger,” says Fawcett. \nA total of 12 carmakers have had to recall vehicles because of faulty Takata airbags. To date, over 4.3 million Takata airbag inflators have been subject to a recall in Canada. Meantime, U.S. safety regulators have linked 11 deaths in the U.S. to Takata airbags and 16 worldwide. \nSo far, no reported deaths or injuries in Canada. The defect is said to more likely happen in vehicles exposed to high humidity and temperatures for long periods of time. \nConsumer Matters did contact Toyota Canada to ask why the repairs were taking so long. In a statement Toyota Canada said: \n“although we cannot share specific timelines, rollout of replacement parts for our customers have started in Canada…recalls are being conducted according to priorities determined by the level of risk associated with the involved vehicles.” \nGeorge Iny with The Automobile Protection Association says “the likelihood of an unintended airbag deployment or a deployment with too much force is considered remote in Canada.” Still, he says Toyota should be doing more for its customers. “I think it would have helped if we had more clarity with what they were prepared to do.” \nTransport Canada says it’s in contact with the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to ensure Canadians have the latest information on vehicles affected by Takata recalls. \nThat’s little comfort to Geoff Fawcett who continues to wait and drive in frustration while he waits to hear from his dealer that the replacement parts are available. “It’s going on too long, it’s not a lot of fun,” says Fawcett. \nTo find out if your vehicle is affected by a Takata recall visit Transport Canada’s motor vehicle safety recall database: www.tc.gc.ca/recalls © 2016 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.

Toyota Will Stay Out of Super Bowl 51 Toyota Advertisements Not to Appear During Super Bowl LI Toyota has decided to sit out of Super Bowl 51. \nMany automakers and other franchises launch their new products in the season of Super Bowl. It is the peak occasion to advertise ones products in the year. However Toyota has decided something different. The company won’t be advertising Super Bowl for the first time since 2011. Don't Miss: Sam's Club November 12 Black Friday Sale \nToyota has said that the Super Bowl doesn’t line up with the scheduled launch of its new models. The Camry Sedan and C-HR compact crossover are the vehicles that are getting launched in a few months by company. \nThe promotion and launch activities related to these vehicles are supposed to begin in late spring and summer of next year. This was confirmed by Toyota marketing at Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A. \nThe C-HR is supposed to release in second quarter of next year while the new Camry is supposed to arrive after third quarter of 2017. The NFL rating shave dropped a lot this season. \nSo it was speculated that may be this is the reason that Toyota no longer wants to advertise during the event. However Toyota has said that it has nothing to do with this fact. \nAccording to them the timings of previous Super Bowls were perfectly aligned with new launching cars which made them perfect spot to play the advertisement, reported AutomotiveNews . \nThe upper Bowl 50 saw a 90 seconds advertisement promoting the redesigned Prius in “The Longest Chase”. Hollis the marketing director said that the company, backing away this year from event doesn’t mean that they are drawing back from NFL as well. \nIt is also said that Fox has increased the rates of advertisement during event. They want about $5 to $5.5 million for a 30 second slot. This will make these advertisements, the most expensive up till now. You May Like",

      "text": "Toyota Launches Tank-Like Minivan For Sale Forbes 1 day ago Bertel Schmitt, Contributor\n© Provided by Forbes Media LLC Strictly for peaceful purposes: Toyota's Tank (Photo: Bertel Schmitt) On the day Donald Trump was elected President in America, Toyota launched a Tank in Tokyo. Of course, it was all happenstance, but it also is an omen. Trump’s impending “America First” policy would lead to a rearmament at America’s former foes in Japan and Germany, commentators predicted, and talk about going nuclear as insurance against belligerent neighbors and unreliable allies already is rampant in both countries. Toyota’s Tank, of course, is for entirely peaceful purposes: It is a new compact minivan, built on the bones of Daihatsu’s mini vehicles, or “kei” cars.\nThe Tank was launched at the Daiba Hilton this Tokyo early afternoon, and the present press corps did not give the event its undivided attention. On smartphone after smartphone, big blue and bigger red bars signaled that the body was in Tokyo, but the spirit was in Washington, DC.\nResearch Make (e.g. Mazda) Acura Alfa Romeo AM General Aston Martin Audi Bentley BMW Buick Cadillac Chevrolet Chrysler Daewoo Dodge Eagle Ferrari Fiat Fisker Ford Genesis Geo GMC Honda Hummer Hyundai Infiniti Isuzu Jaguar Jeep Kia Lamborghini Land Rover Lexus Lincoln Lotus Maserati Maybach Mazda McLaren Mercedes-Benz Mercury MINI Mitsubishi Nissan Oldsmobile Plymouth Pontiac Porsche Ram Rolls-Royce Saab Saturn Scion smart SRT Subaru Suzuki Tesla Toyota Volkswagen Volvo The Tank is just one part of a big re-badge exercise between Toyota and its now wholly-owned subsidiary Daihatsu. The Daihatsu-designed and -produced vehicle can be had as a Daihatsu Thor, a Toyota Tank, or, apparently to target a more pacifist-leaning demographic, as a Toyota Roomy. All look like the boxy kei cars common to Japan, but they have a slightly less anemic engine than the 0.6 liter “power” train the kei car is limited to by government edict.\n© Provided by Forbes Media LLC tankengine A “newly developed 1.0-liter turbo engine can produce torque equivalent to that of a 1.5-liter class engine,” Toyota promised today while the red bars on the phones of the assembled reporters grew bigger and bigger. All vehicles cost about the same, between 1,463,400 Japanese yen [$14,286] and 2,008,800 JPY [$19,611], prices only marginally higher than a comparable kei car. All cars are limited to the Japanese market at the moment, and nobody wanted to comment on plans for a foreign deployments of Tanks, or Thors.\nThe dollar conversion of course fluctuated wildly today. The Japanese yen rose sharply against the dollar today as traders fled to the perceived safety of the Japanese currency. A stronger dollar would be bad for Japanese automakers, and good for Japan’s military, which could buy real tanks more cheaply. Both of which is not good.\nFollow MSN Autos on Facebook\nGo to MSN Home",

      "text": "Artificial Intelligence Next Big Thing for Cars \nResearchers from Purdue University and the Toyota Research Institute of North America combine to make hybrid- and battery-electric vehicles cool. \nBut it is not image-enhancement for alternative propulsion; instead, the West Lafayette, IN, college and Toyota ’s Ann Arbor, MI, tech center have developed a high-performance, 2-phase cold-plate design for automotive power-electronics cooling. \nIn cold-plate systems, a coolant flows through a metal plate attached to the device that needs to be cooled. Allowing the coolant liquid to boil on the surface of the plate provides greater cooling and helps maintain a uniform temperature across the surface of the power semiconductor device. \nThe technology has evolved from work originating in the Purdue National Science Foundation Cooling Technologies Research Center formed in 1999. Indiana’s 21st Century Research and Technology Fund provided $3.8 million to the center to help commercialize an advanced cooling system for hybrid-electric- and battery-electric vehicles. \nThe center involves a consortium of corporations, government laboratories and the university working to overcome heat-generation problems in electronic systems by developing new compact cooling technologies. The technology under development uses jet impingement to enhance cooling by flowing the coolant in a perpendicular direction, producing jets that wash across a hot surface and improve heat transfer. \nThe cooling system measures about 2 ins.-by-2 ins. (5 cm-by-5 cm). It has been found to cool power devices operating at a rate equivalent of the heat generated by 10 100-watt light bulbs crammed into the space of 0.2 sq.-in. (1-sq.-cm). \n“This is a big number,” says Suresh Garimella, founder and executive vice president-Research and Partnerships at Purdue. \n“A smartphone might dissipate 5 watts, a laptop 30 watts, and most work stations not more than 100 watts,” Garimella says in a statement. \nTo improve performance, the researchers modified the cold plate’s surface by incorporating porous copper coatings and tiny pin-like fins. Key to the design is a manifold optimized to evenly distribute the coolant through many tiny nozzles. \nThe work began when Toyota, a member of the center, approached Purdue researchers about five years ago seeking ways to further improve efficiency and performance of cooling electronics in electrified vehicles. \nA doctoral student, Matthew Rau, took on the project to study “jet impingement technology” for his Ph.D. thesis. Rau spent a summer at Toyota’s Electronics Research Dept. in Ann Arbor, transferring technology from what Purdue researchers learned in the lab over the course of several years. \n“The reason it was successful was that Toyota put a lot of effort into this research themselves, performing computer modeling and setting up experiments in a more realistic setting at Toyota than a university alone is able to do,” Garimella says. \nTwo patents have been issued, and Toyota has filed a third patent application related to the cooling technology.",

      "title": "Not just Ford: Trump’s trade barbs threaten VW, Toyota too",
      "text": "Ford was a favourite target of Donald Trump, who lambasted the company for producing cars south of the border throughout his campaign. Toyota and Volkswagen, as well as other U.S. carmakers, are just as exposed. Toyota and Nissan, Japan's largest automakers, were spared from Trump's critique by name on the campaign trail. Yet they, along with General Motors and VW, all rely on Mexican plants for millions of vehicles and a high volume of parts. That puts them at risk if the president-elect makes good on his threat to levy hefty taxes on cars assembled across the Rio Grande.\n\"Trump could, or will try to set up trade barriers,\" said Ferdinand Dudenhoeffer, director of the Center for Automotive Research at the University of Duisburg-Essen in Germany. \"Automakers with U.S. factories will therefore be on the winning side. Mexico, the new El Dorado of the auto industry, could suffer.\"\nSince 2010, nine global automakers, including GM, Ford and Fiat Chrysler, have announced more than $24 billion in Mexican investments. VW's Audi, BMW and Daimler each build or plan to assemble luxury vehicles, engines or heavy trucks in the low-cost country, which Trump says has benefited at the expense of the American voters who propelled him to victory. Output in Mexico may more than double this decade, from two million to five million vehicles, according to the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Mich.\nThe Republican candidate and real-estate developer grabbed headlines during his campaign by threatening to slap a 35 per cent tariff on any cars Ford builds in Mexico and ships back to the U.S. He called Ford's plans for a new plant in Mexico \"an absolute disgrace.\"\nTrump would \"start a worldwide trade war\" if he decides to end trade pacts and uses anti-dumping provisions to impose widespread tariffs on other countries, said Donald Grimes, an economist at the Institute for Research on Labor, Employment and the Economy at the University of Michigan. The North American Free Trade Agreement, for example, requires only six months' notice of termination to Canada and Mexico and doesn't specify that the president would need congressional approval, he said.\n\"These other countries would retaliate. Prices consumers would pay would increase sharply. The Federal Reserve would then increase interest rates. It would be ugly,\" Grimes said.\nDespite that threat, U.S. automakers and the United Auto Workers union extended an olive branch to the president-elect.\n\"We agree with Mr. Trump that it is really important to unite the country — and we look forward to working together to support economic growth and jobs,\" Ford said in a statement. The company's plan to shift small-car production from a factory in Michigan to Mexico was attacked by Trump during his first answer of the initial debate with Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in September.\nGM and Fiat Chrysler said in separate statements they would work with Trump and the new Congress on policies that support manufacturing in the U.S.\nGermanexecutives attending an industry conference in Munich on Wednesday also expressed concerns about Trump's views. BMW is building a new car plant in Mexico's San Luis Potosi that's due to start production in 2019, while Audi started assembling autos in San Jose Chiapa in September.\n\"We need open trade,\" said BMW CEO Harald Krueger. The luxury automaker ships many of the SUVs assembled at its South Carolina factory to markets around the world and in turn exports sedans and Mini cars to the U.S. from Europe. \"We live off exports and imports. The U.S. market is fundamental for us.\"\nDaimler CEO Dieter Zetsche is among executives who held out hope that much of Trump's trade talk was campaign rhetoric and would soften with the practicalities needed to govern. \"Many things get said during the heat of an election campaign,\" Zetsche said. \"I hope and believe this is also the case here.\"\nFor Bob Lutz, the retired vice chair of GM, Trump's victory could ultimately help the auto industry if his advisers and Congress keep him from pushing his protectionist agenda too far.\n\"He's not a dictator,\" Lutz said in an interview. \"No one can go in and abrogate trade deals. There are some aspects of NAFTA that will probably be renegotiated, but he will probably be talked out of his crazier ideas.\"\nRather than threaten Japan auto imports with tariffs, Trump has pointed to wealth generated from the cars being sold in the U.S. to bolster his argument for America to pay a smaller share of the costs related to stationing troops in its biggest Asian ally's territory.\n\"Japan is ripping us off with the cars,\" Trump said at an Oct. 12 campaign event in Florida. In remarks to Ohio volunteers in July, he spoke of \"massive ships\" delivering vehicles to the U.S. from Japan, which he told Americans was \"rich because of us.\"\nJapan's automakers have combined capacity to build about 1.36 million vehicles annually in Mexico and have announced plans for new plants capable of assembling another 430,000 vehicles a year. Models built or planned for Mexican production and sale in the U.S. include the Toyota Corolla, the Nissan Versa and Sentra, and the Honda Fit and HR-V. Toyota is shifting production of the Corolla from Cambridge, Ont., to a plant in Guanajuato, Mexico.\"\nIf NAFTA is going to be up for discussion somewhere down the line, that would affect Japanese companies very much, especially auto-related investments in Mexico,\" said Bob Takai, president and CEO of Sumitomo Global Research Co.\nBloomberg",

      "text": "Toyota recalls fresh 5.8m cars globally over faulty airbags Posted on Nov 11 2016 - 1:49am by Paul Ogbuokiri Hyundai names new Benin dealer \nIn a bid to target a broader range of customers, Mercedes- Benz Vans expanded its model series with the introduction of the Mercedes-Benz X-Class pickup truck. At Stockholm, a concrete outlook was given with two concept X-class pickup trucks. The concepts were impressively designed to combine the best of both worlds. \nThe First variant called the powerful adventurer illustrates that the future X-Class will possess all the strengths of a classic pickup – tough, functional, strong, and with off-road capability. The stylish explorer variant on the other hand, possesses a markedly expressive and dynamic appearance with select features that distinguishes Mercedes-Benz from every other automobile. \nMercedes-Benz was the first premium manufacturer to launch a sport utility vehicle (SUV), the M-Class, and completely redefined the off-road segment – with lasting success. \nNow the premium brand has taken another major step by pioneering the first premium pickup trucks which will be launched in late 2017 under the name Mercedes-Benz X-Class. Mercedes-Benz has identified five customer groups for the X-Class, which are of different relevance in the individual countries. \nThe key markets include Argentina, Brazil, Africa, Australia with New Zealand, and Europe. These target groups include families, business owners, land owners, travelers/adventurers and trend conscious individualists. “We will open up and change the segment of mid-size pickups – with the world’s first true premium pickup for the modern urban lifestyle”, says Volker Mornhinweg, Head of Mercedes-Benz Vans. \n“Our future X-Class will be a pickup that knows no compromise. Ladder-type frame, hightorque six-cylinder engine, and permanent all-wheel drive are compulsory for us. As an added value, we bring safety, comfort, agility, and expressive design – in other words, everything that distinguishes vehicles bearing the Mercedes star. \nWe will thus appeal to new customers who have not considered owning a pickup before.” The top-of-the-line model will come with a V6 diesel engine, 4MATIC all-wheel drive, 22-inch alloy wheels ready to tow up to 3.5 tons. The premium truck will also be equipped with exemplary assistance systems including camera, radar and ultrasound sensors. \nCustomers will be able to choose from a variety of equipment scopes for the exterior and interior. High quality materials and infotainment features similar to the C-class and V-class will be readily available to create an elegant ambience inside and out. “The Concept X-CLASS design variants interpret the hallmark brand design idiom of our SUVs in a most expressive form, and embody the dichotomy of our design philosophy: they are hot and cool”, says Gorden Wagener, Head of Design at Daimler AG. \n“With its progressive design the powerful adventurer expresses cool modernity and thirst for adventure, while the stylish explorer on the other hand uses pure emotion to provide a tangible experience of modern beauty.” The market launch of the Mercedes-Benz X-Class in Europe will begin in late 2017. \nThe pickup will be manufactured in a production cooperation with the Renault-Nissan Alliance. Production for the European, Australian and South African markets will start at the Nissan plant in Barcelona, Spain, in 2017. The X-Class for the Latin American market will roll off the assembly lines at the Renault plant in Cordoba, Argentina, starting in 2018. \n“We are extremely pleased with the final unveiling of the concept trucks. The X-Class pickup trucks will be a formidable addition to our fleet. I believe they are perfect for the Nigerian market due to the broad range of needs to be met for different customers. Thus, we look forward to their arrival in 2017” says Mirko Plath, MD/CEO of Weststar Associates, Sole General Distributors of Mercedes-Benz Vehicles in Nigeria. \nWith the X-Class, Daimler AG and the Renault-Nissan Alliance have expanded their strategic cooperation which began six years ago. This affords Mercedes-Benz fast and cost-efficient entrance to the fast-growing segment of mid-size pickups. \nIn addition, both companies benefit from optimal utilization of the production capacity. Nissan is the second-largest manufacturer of mid-size pickups with a payload of one ton in the world, and can look back on more than 80 years of experience in producing and marketing these types of vehicles.

      "text": "By YURI KAGEYAMA\nAP Business Writer TOKYO (AP) - Toyota Motor Corp. reported Tuesday that its July-September profit sank 36 percent as a stronger yen eroded its overseas earnings.\nLagging sales also pinched the Japanese automaker's fiscal second quarter profit, which fell to 393.7 billion yen ($3.8 billion) from 611.7 billion yen in the same period the previous year.\nQuarterly sales slipped nearly 9 percent to 6.48 trillion yen ($62.3 billion).\nThe manufacturer of the Prius hybrid, Camry sedan and Lexus luxury models expects to sell 10.1 million vehicles worldwide through March 2017, including sales by affiliates Hino Motors and Daihatsu Motor Co.\nToyota has led world vehicle sales in recent years but this year is vying with German automaker Volkswagen AG and General Motors Co., which also expect to sell about 10 million vehicles globally, for the top spot.\nVolkswagen's global vehicle sales surpassed Toyota's in the first half of the year despite a scandal over cars it rigged to cheat on U.S. diesel emissions tests.\nToyota raised its annual profit forecast to 1.5 trillion yen ($14.4 billion) from an earlier 1.45 trillion yen ($13.9 billion). But that's still below the 2.3 trillion yen it earned last year.\nToyota said that in the first fiscal half, it carried out cost reductions that added 220 billion yen ($2.1 billion) to the company's operating profit, but the unfavorable currency fluctuations erased 565 billion yen ($5.4 billion).\n___\nFollow Yuri Kageyama on Twitter at https://twitter.com/yurikageyama\nHer work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/content/yuri-kageyama\n ",

Strong yen sends Toyota's quarterly profit sinking 36 pct Associated Press | 0 comments \nTOKYO (AP) — Toyota Motor Corp. reported Tuesday that its July-September profit sank 36 percent as a stronger yen eroded its overseas earnings. \nLagging sales also pinched the Japanese automaker's fiscal second quarter profit, which fell to 393.7 billion yen ($3.8 billion) from 611.7 billion yen in the same period the previous year. \nQuarterly sales slipped nearly 9 percent to 6.48 trillion yen ($62.3 billion). \nThe manufacturer of the Prius hybrid, Camry sedan and Lexus luxury models expects to sell 10.1 million vehicles worldwide through March 2017, including sales by affiliates Hino Motors and Daihatsu Motor Co. \nToyota has led world vehicle sales in recent years but this year is vying with German automaker Volkswagen AG and General Motors Co., which also expect to sell about 10 million vehicles globally, for the top spot. \nVolkswagen's global vehicle sales surpassed Toyota's in the first half of the year despite a scandal over cars it rigged to cheat on U.S. diesel emissions tests. \nToyota raised its annual profit forecast to 1.5 trillion yen ($14.4 billion) from an earlier 1.45 trillion yen ($13.9 billion). But that's still below the 2.3 trillion yen it earned last year. \nToyota said that in the first fiscal half, it carried out cost reductions that added 220 billion yen ($2.1 billion) to the company's operating profit, but the unfavorable currency fluctuations erased 565 billion yen ($5.4 billion). \n___ \nFollow Yuri Kageyama on Twitter at https://twitter.com/yurikageyama \nHer work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/content/yuri-kageyama Discuss Print",

      "text": "By Craig Trudell, Elisabeth Behrmann, Keith Naughton, Bloomberg News\nFord was a favorite target of Donald Trump, who lambasted the company for producing cars south of the border throughout his campaign. Toyota and Volkswagen, as well as other U.S. carmakers, are just as exposed.\nToyota and Nissan, Japan’s largest automakers, were spared from Trump’s critique by name on the campaign trail. Yet they, along with General Motors and VW, all rely on Mexican plants for millions of vehicles and a high volume of parts. That puts them at risk if the president-elect makes good on his threat to levy hefty taxes on cars assembled across the Rio Grande.\n“Trump could, or will, try to set up trade barriers,” said Ferdinand Dudenhoeffer, director of the Center for Automotive Research at the University of Duisburg-Essen in Germany. “Automakers with U.S. factories will therefore be on the winning side. Mexico, the new El Dorado of the auto industry, could suffer.”\nRelated Articles November 10, 2016 Net neutrality “has a big target on its back” under Trump administration, analysts say November 10, 2016 Donald Trump’s build-that-wall pledge has companies bracing for labor shortages November 10, 2016 Donald Trump’s array of economic ideas arms pessimists, optimists alike Since 2010, nine global automakers, including GM, Ford and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, have announced more than $24 billion in Mexican investments. VW’s Audi, BMW AG and Daimler AG each build or plan to assemble luxury vehicles, engines or heavy trucks in the low-cost country, which Trump says has benefited at the expense of the American voters who propelled him to victory. Output in Mexico may more than double this decade, from 2 million to 5 million vehicles, according to the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Mich.\nThe Republican candidate and real-estate developer grabbed headlines during his campaign by threatening to slap a 35 percent tariff on any cars Ford builds in Mexico and ships back to the U.S. He called Ford’s plans for a new plant in Mexico “an absolute disgrace.” A levy would lead to higher prices and hurt demand, said Joe Spak, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets.\nTrump would “start a worldwide trade war” if he decides to end trade pacts and uses anti-dumping provisions to impose widespread tariffs on other countries, said Donald Grimes, an economist at the Institute for Research on Labor, Employment and the Economy at the University of Michigan. The North American Free Trade Agreement, for example, requires only six months’ notice of termination to Canada and Mexico and doesn’t specify that the president would need congressional approval, he said.\n“These other countries would retaliate. Prices consumers would pay would increase sharply. The Federal Reserve would then increase interest rates. It would be ugly,” Grimes said.\nDespite that threat, U.S. automakers and the United Auto Workers union extended an olive branch to the president-elect.\n“We agree with Mr. Trump that it is really important to unite the country — and we look forward to working together to support economic growth and jobs,” Ford said in a statement. The company’s plan to shift small-car production from a factory in Michigan to Mexico was attacked by Trump during his first answer of the initial debate with Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in September.\nGM and Fiat Chrysler said in separate statements they would work with Trump and the new Congress on policies that support manufacturing in the U.S. “It’s obvious there is work to be done,” UAW President Dennis Williams, whose union endorsed Clinton, said in a statement.\nGerman executives attending an industry conference in Munich on Wednesday also expressed concerns about Trump’s views. BMW is building a new car plant in Mexico’s San Luis Potosi that’s due to start production in 2019, while Audi started assembling autos in San Jose Chiapa in September.\n“We need open trade,” said BMW CEO Harald Krueger. The luxury automaker ships many of the SUVs assembled at its South Carolina factory to markets around the world and in turn exports sedans and Mini cars to the U.S. from Europe. “We live off exports and imports. The U.S. market is fundamental for us.”\nDaimler CEO Dieter Zetsche and James Verrier, who heads supplier BorgWarner Inc., are among executives who held out hope that much of Trump’s trade talk was campaign rhetoric and would soften with the practicalities needed to govern. “Many things get said during the heat of an election campaign,” Zetsche said. “I hope and believe this is also the case here.”\nFor Bob Lutz, the retired vice chairman of GM, Trump’s victory could ultimately help the auto industry if his advisers and Congress keep him from pushing his protectionist agenda too far.\n“He’s not a dictator,” Lutz said in an interview. “No one can go in and abrogate trade deals. There are some aspects of NAFTA that will probably be re-negotiated, but he will probably be talked out of his crazier ideas.”\nRather than threaten Japan auto imports with tariffs, Trump has pointed to wealth generated from the cars being sold in the U.S. to bolster his argument for America to pay a smaller share of the costs related to stationing troops in its biggest Asian ally’s territory.\n“Japan is ripping us off with the cars,” Trump said at an Oct. 12 campaign event in Florida. In remarks to Ohio volunteers in July, he spoke of “massive ships” delivering vehicles to the U.S. from Japan, which he told Americans was “rich because of us.”\nRepresentatives for Toyota, Nissan and Honda Motor Co. declined to comment.\nJapan’s automakers have combined capacity to build about 1.36 million vehicles annually in Mexico and have announced plans for new plants capable of assembling another 430,000 vehicles a year. Models built or planned for Mexican production and sale in the U.S. include the Toyota Corolla, the Nissan Versa and Sentra, and the Honda Fit and HR-V.\n“If NAFTA is going to be up for discussion somewhere down the line, that would affect Japanese companies very much, especially auto-related investments in Mexico,” said Bob Takai, president and CEO of Sumitomo Global Research Co. “If the trading and investing is going to be very difficult because of the new presidency, we may go somewhere else.”\n– With assistance from Hideki Asai Ma Jie David Welch Jamie Butters Christoph Rauwald and Stephen Stapczynski",

      "text": "Trades from $ 3 \nWith most of the Q3 earnings season behind us, Toyota Motor Corporation ( TM - Free Report ) was the only major auto sector company to post results over the week. Tesla Motors, Inc. ( TSLA - Free Report ) announced an acquisition, while Winnebago Industries, Inc. ( WGO - Free Report ) completed a previously announced buyout. \nFurther, Ford Motor Co. ( F - Free Report ) and General Motors Co. ( GM - Free Report ) announced record October sales volumes in China. General Motors also announced some investment and production plans. \n(Read the previous roundup here: Auto Stock Roundup for Nov 3, 2016 ) \nRecap of the Week’s Most Important Stories \n1. Toyota recorded earnings of ¥128.54 per share ($2.51 per ADR) in second-quarter (ended Sep 30, 2016) fiscal 2017, down from ¥192.51 per share ($3.16 per ADR) earned in second-quarter (ended Sep 30, 2015) fiscal 2016. Earnings per ADR surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.12. Consolidated revenues decreased 8.6% year over year to ¥6.48 trillion ($63.32 billion). The figure also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $64.56 billion. \nNet earnings for fiscal 2017 are expected at around ¥1.55 trillion ($15 billion), up from the prior view of ¥1.45 trillion ($14.2 billion). The net income guidance reflects expectation of a 33% decrease over fiscal 2016 (read more: Toyota Q2 Earnings Beat, Revenues Lag Estimates ). \nToyota carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). \n2. Tesla announced that it has agreed to buy Grohmann Engineering, a German automated manufacturing specialist. The company will be renamed Tesla Grohmann Automation and should play an integral role in helping Tesla reach its increased production capacity goals. Tesla expects the deal to close by early 2017. Upon approval, its new operations in Germany will bring over 1,000 advanced engineering and skilled technician jobs to the country over the next two years (read more: Here's Why Tesla Just Bought a German Engineering Firm ). \nTesla currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). \n3. General Motors announced that it will invest over $900 million in three U.S. facilities for future vehicle programs.

This is being done to align production with demand for cars built at these facilities. \nCurrently, General Motors has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). \n4. Winnebago has completed the acquisition of privately held towable recreation vehicles (RVs) producer, Grand Design Recreational Vehicle Company, for roughly $500 million.

      "text": "With most of the Q3 earnings season behind us, Toyota Motor Corporation ( TM - Free Report ) was the only major auto sector company to post results over the week. Tesla Motors, Inc. ( TSLA - Free Report ) announced an acquisition, while Winnebago Industries, Inc. ( WGO - Free Report ) completed a previously announced buyout.\nFurther, Ford Motor Co. ( F - Free Report ) and General Motors Co. ( GM - Free Report ) announced record October sales volumes in China. General Motors also announced some investment and production plans.\n(Read the previous roundup here: Auto Stock Roundup for Nov 3, 2016 )\nRecap of the Week’s Most Important Stories\n1. Toyota recorded earnings of ¥128.54 per share ($2.51 per ADR) in second-quarter (ended Sep 30, 2016) fiscal 2017, down from ¥192.51 per share ($3.16 per ADR) earned in second-quarter (ended Sep 30, 2015) fiscal 2016. Earnings per ADR surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.12. Consolidated revenues decreased 8.6% year over year to ¥6.48 trillion ($63.32 billion). The figure also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $64.56 billion.\nNet earnings for fiscal 2017 are expected at around ¥1.55 trillion ($15 billion), up from the prior view of ¥1.45 trillion ($14.2 billion). The net income guidance reflects expectation of a 33% decrease over fiscal 2016 (read more: Toyota Q2 Earnings Beat, Revenues Lag Estimates ).\nToyota carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).\n2. Tesla announced that it has agreed to buy Grohmann Engineering, a German automated manufacturing specialist. The company will be renamed Tesla Grohmann Automation and should play an integral role in helping Tesla reach its increased production capacity goals. Tesla expects the deal to close by early 2017. Upon approval, its new operations in Germany will bring over 1,000 advanced engineering and skilled technician jobs to the country over the next two years (read more: Here's Why Tesla Just Bought a German Engineering Firm ).\nTesla currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n3. General Motors announced that it will invest over $900 million in three U.S. facilities for future vehicle programs. These facilities are the Toledo Transmission Operations in Ohio, Lansing Grand River in Michigan and Bedford Casting Operations in Indiana.\nThe company will also suspend the third shift of production at the Lordstown, OH, and Lansing Grand River, MI assembly plants in the first quarter of 2017. This is being done to align production with demand for cars built at these facilities.\nCurrently, General Motors has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\n4. Winnebago has completed the acquisition of privately held towable recreation vehicles (RVs) producer, Grand Design Recreational Vehicle Company, for roughly $500 million. With this deal, which was announced last month, Winnebago intends to increase its presence in the towables business as well as diversify its portfolio with this merger.\nWinnebago currently carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here .\n5. Ford and General Motors reported their respective China sales figures for Oct 2016. General Motors and its joint ventures in China reported a 5.7% year-over-year increase in deliveries to a record 345,733 vehicles. Meanwhile, Ford’s sales in China increased 14% year over year to 107,618 units during the period, which is an October record for the company.\nPerformance\nThe companies in the auto sector recorded mixed performance last week. General Motors and Honda Motor Co., Ltd. ( HMC - Free Report ) lost the most during the week, while Ford was the biggest loser over the last six months.\nMeanwhile, Harley-Davidson, Inc. ( HOG - Free Report ) gained the most over both the short and longer terms.\nCompany\nLast 1-Week Period\nLast 6 Months\nGM\n-1.6%\n-1.2%\nF\n+1.6%\n-14.2%\nTSLA\n+1.1%\n-8.9%\nTM\n-1.4%\n+6.7%\nHMC\n-1.6%\n-1.1%\nHOG\n+5.0%\n+26.7%\nAAP\n+1.6%\n-7.9%\nAZO\n+0.4%\n-6.1%\nAuto-Tires-Trucks Sector Price Index\nAuto-Tires-Trucks Sector Price Index\nWhat’s Next in the Auto Space?\nA few auto companies, including Advance Auto Parts and Tata Motors, will release their financial results in the coming week.\nFurther, some automakers will report their Europe sales for October in the coming days.\nConfidential: Zacks' Best Investment Ideas\nWould you like to see a hand-picked \"all-star\" selection of investment ideas from the man who heads up Zacks' trading and investing services?

      "title": "Toyota facelifts Corolla Altis in Thailand",
      "text": "Toyota has launched the facelifted version of the Corolla Altis in Thailand, and this comes after the current generation has been selling for the last three years. Prices now range from 799,000 baht to 1,079,000 baht (Rs 15.23 to 20.57 lakh).\nToyota’s latest Corolla Altis gets a sharper fascia with restyled LED head lamps, grille, fog lamps and bumper. While the profile section highlights the use of a freshly designed set of 16-inch alloy wheels the rear section shows off the new tail lamps. On the inside, the cabin now incorporates more soft touch materials along with premium looking white-coloured seams running across the dash.\nToyota has retained the same engines, so the 1.8-litre 141bhp petrol motor and the 1.6-litre 125bhp petrol engine will continue to power the facelifted Corolla Altis. However, Toyota has added a new ‘Sport’ mode for the CVT to enhance response from the powertrain. Engineers have also tweaked the suspension to aid a smoother ride quality.\nOn the features front, seven airbags are now standard across the range, and this is complimented by other features like a rear-view camera, three USB ports, a seven-inch touchscreen which plays DVDs and Toyota’s T-Connect navigation system.\nToyota India has not yet revealed when it plans to bring the facelifted Corolla Altis to our market.",

      "text": "Toyota doubles down on slumping Latin America markets Mon Nov 7, 2016 2:53pm EST [ - ] Text [ + ] \nBy Brad Haynes and Daniel Flynn \nSAO PAULO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T: Quote ) is gearing up for Brazil's battered auto market to return to growth in 2017, after a four-year crisis halved overall vehicle sales, the automaker's top executive in Latin America said. \nYet Steve St. Angelo - who has tripled Toyota's market share in Brazil during the crisis - says he is losing sleep over one scenario: what if the market comes back too quickly? \n\"If that volume comes back, how do we keep our market share?\" said St. Angelo, head of Toyota in South and Central America and the Caribbean, in an interview ahead of this week's Sao Paulo Auto Show. \n\"We don't have the production facilities.

      "text": "Honda, Toyota, Ford, Nissan, Chevrolet, Ford \nIf the Subaru Outback is the leader of a cult, as Dan Neil wrote in the Wall Street Journal \nSubaru of America reported an all-time monthly record of 18,008 Outback sales in October 2016, smashing the nameplate’ \nSUV/crossover sales across America grew just 2 percent in October. Yet in spite of the market’s slowdown, limited supply, and an abbreviated sales month, Outback volume jumped 22 percent, year-over-year.Subaru’s rapid American rise is built on the steady growth of its high-riding models: the Outback, Forester, and Crosstrek. Outback sales have grown by two-thirds over the last five years. The Forester, Subaru’s best-selling model so far this year, is on track for a fourth consecutive record sales year. The Crosstrek now outsells the combined efforts of the car on which it’ \nWith those three models producing nearly three-quarters of Subaru’s U.S. volume, the brand has already produced 76,000 more sales through the first ten months of 2016 than in all of 2013. In fact, the Crosstrek, Forester, and Outback have already generated 31,000 more sales through the first ten months of 2016 than the whole Subaru brand p \nYet plans to improve Subaru’s U.S. production footprint have by no means fully taken hold. “We will add over 100,000 [units] to U.S. capacity for next year,” a Subaru spokesperson told TTAC earlier this fall . Subaru had more vehicles to sell this October than last — a 23-day supply heading into October 2016; only 15 days heading into October 2015, according to Automotive News . The industry as a whole currently has a two-month supply of new vehicles.As a result of Subaru’s limited supply, incentives remain at an industry low. says Subaru spent just $1,130 on incentives per vehicle in October 2016, up significantly from $695 per vehicle in October 2015, up modestly from $1,088 per vehicle in September of this year. \nBut Subaru’s incentive spend this October was still 68-percent lower than the industry average. TrueCar reports that Subaru’s incentive spending as a percentage of Subaru’s average transaction price was just 3.8 percent in October 2016, again the lowest in the industry, and 64 percent below the industry average. Subarus average transaction price jumped 6 percent, year-over-year, to $29,356 in October 2016, 12 percent below the industry average, a reflection of a lineup that lacks a three-row utility vehicle. \nAs for the Outback, specifically, Subaru’s current flagship was responsible for one-third of the brand’s total U.S. volume in October. Year-over-year, Outback sales have increased in nine consecutive months. The 18,008-unit total achieved in October was fully 6 percent better than the Outback’s previous record set just one month earlier (the previous record stood for eight months) and positioned the Outback . \nThe Outback ranks 12th among utility vehicles — unless you consider it a wagon with a lot — so far this year. \nSounds mainstream to me. \n[Images: Subaru] \nTimothy Cain is the founder of GoodCarBadCar.net , which obsesses over the free and frequent publication of U.S. and Canadian auto sales figures.

      "text": "Business on the Move: ITV, Toyota, Perfetti Van Melle and more By Jessica Goodfellow - 11 November 2016 16:00pm I'm a celebrity \nITV has appointed Somethin' Else to produce social media content alongside ITV's in-house team for the channel's forthcoming series of I'm A Celebrity... and other future projects. \nThe appointment follows a competitive pitch involving three agencies, and will see the London-based content shop work with ITV’s in-house digital and social media production arms to initiate design and create assets across multiple platforms. Somethin’ Else will also work on the live show output, with a number of the agency's team joining ITV staff in Australia for I’m A Celebrity filming. \nToyota has appointed The&Partnership as its advertising agency for Europe, replacing Saatchi&Saatchi and Zenith. The creative shop was given the keys to the account without a pitch. Dedicated hubs will be set up for the car business, each designed to steer its creative along a more integrated way of planning campaigns. \nPerfetti Van Melle UK has chosen Maxus as its lead media agency, following a competitive four-way pitch that included the incumbent agency, AMS Media Group. The account is worth £4 million in billings. The Maxus appointment covers the entire Perfetti Van Melle brand portfolio, including: Mentos, Mentos Gum, Chupa Chups, Fruittella and Smint. Maxus will oversee the delivery of fully integrated media campaigns, covering all areas of planning and activation. \nUnicef UK has appointed Manifesto as its digital agency. The agency was previously engaged to create an audience and content strategy for Unicef UK, based on in-depth user research and market analysis. Following this successful initial project, Manifesto has now been appointed as the charity’s ongoing digital agency. The relationship has seen Manifesto completely redesign and rebuild the Unicef UK website and work on an innovative legacies campaign that delivers personalised video to users. \nDigital agency Found has secured significant investment to fund an aggressive growth plan after securing client wins including London hotel chain glh Hotels , retail and leasing group Marshall Motors and personalised greetings cards supplier Funky Pigeon . \nPremier Nutrition Corporation (PNC) , maker of foods and beverages under Premier Protein and PowerBar brands and subsidiary of Post Holdings, Inc, has named Maxus as its media agency of record, replacing incumbent agency Mediavest/Spark. The GroupM agency will lead media planning, buying and analytics across all channels and emerging platforms for PNC’s portfolio of brands in the U.S. \nThe Wool Room appointed Strawman as their lead creative agency following a competitive pitch last month. The integrated campaign will begin in January 2017 and will include print, film, retail activation, social media and creative development of the website.",

      "text": "While the U.S. automotive industry as a whole is currently plateauing, the difference between the performance of Japanese automakers and Detroit automakers is quite stark. While Detroit automakers are cranking out massive profits thanks to accelerated sales of SUVs and full-size trucks, Toyota (NYSE: TM) , Honda (NYSE: HMC) , and Nissan are having a rougher go of it as demand for their flagship passenger cars has taken a hit. Let's look at highlights from the Japanese automakers' recent quarter and zoom in on some potential headwinds.\nToyota's second quarter of its fiscal year 2017 was a bit rough due to exchange-rate pressures and a drop in revenue. Starting from the top, Toyota's second-quarter revenue declined 8.8% from the prior-year period, and its operating income plunged nearly 43%, to 474.6 billion yen ($4.55 billion). That result was slightly weaker than the consensus estimate of 476.26 billion yen, according to Thomson Reuters. \nThe main story behind Toyota's slumping operating income was easy to see: the rising value of the Japanese yen compared to the euro and U.S. dollar. Every dollar generated by Toyota in the U.S. is now worth fewer yen than in the prior year, which leads to huge volatility for the company, as it reports its financial results in Japanese yen. In fact, the effects of foreign exchange rates hindered Toyota's operating income by a staggering 330 billion yen -- this drop was almost entirely responsible for the nearly 353 billion-yen decline in operating income during the quarter.\nContinue reading ",

      "text": "Follow Article \nToyota Motor Co. has reportedly agreed to settle a class action lawsuit alleging it sold certain truck models with rust-prone frames. \nAccording to the settlement documents, Toyota will pay approximately $3.4 billion to resolve the litigation. There are reportedly 1.5 million Toyota trucks that may be affected by the corrosion defect. \nThe Toyota truck frame class action lawsuit was initially filed in March 2015 by a group of truck owners who claimed that the frames on model year 2005 through 2009 Toyota Tacoma trucks were prone to corrosion. \nThe plaintiffs claim that the frames for certain Toyota Tacoma, Sequoia and Tundra trucks rust prematurely because rust protection measures were not properly applied when the frames were manufactured. \n“As a result, the frames can suffer from excessive rust, leading to perforations in the frames that jeopardize their structural integrity, creating a significant risk to the safety of vehicles’ occupants in the event of an accident, among other problems,” the Toyota truck frame defect settlement documents state. \nThe plaintiffs assert that Toyota was aware of the truck frame defect but did not take adequate measures to address the problem. \nAccording to the truck frame defect class action lawsuit, Toyota did offer warranty extensions and recalls, but the plaintiffs say that these measures did not cover all of the affected trucks. The complaint charged Toyota with a number of claims, including breach of warranty and violation of the Unfair Competition Law. \nThe parties commenced settlement negotiations in March 2016, and they filed their proposed class action settlement agreement on Nov. 8. If approved, the settlement will cover 2005 to 2010 Tacomas, 2007 to 2008 Tundras and 2005 to 2008 Sequoias. \nUnder the terms of the proposed Toyota class action settlement, Toyota has agreed to provide free frame inspection for all subject vehicles, and if the truck frame is found to have perforation from rust that is 10 mm or greater, Toyota will replace the frame. \nThe settlement documents indicate that each truck frame inspection costs about $60 per vehicle and each frame replacement costs about $15,000 per vehicle. Under the terms of the truck frame defect class action settlement, Toyota will provide these services at no charge to eligible Class Members. \nToyota will also compensate Class Members who have previously incurred out-of-pocket expenses to replace their truck frame, the class action settlement documents state. \nTop Class Actions will post updates to this class action settlement as they become available.

Roberts of Roberts Law Firm PA, and Jeffrey S. Hurst of Monteleone & Mccory LLP. \nThe Rusty Toyota Truck Frame Class Action Lawsuit is Brian Warner, et al. v.

      "text": "1991 Toyota TownAce 4×4 5-Speed Bidding Open Ends In: Checking for last second bids ... 4x4 w/ 2-Speed Transfer Case Working Air Conditioning Advertise on BaT \nThis 1991 Toyota TownAce is a right hand drive 4×4 model with 131k kilometers (~81k miles) on its 2.0L turbodiesel inline-four and 5-speed manual transmission. Recently imported by the selling dealer from Japan, its four-wheel drive system uses a 2-speed transfer case with high and low ranges along with manually locking hubs. The van reportedly had a single owner prior to importation and is described as an original, unmodified example with working A/C and no outstanding issues. Its sale includes a clean Pennsylvania title. \nSilver paint is said to be original and looks free of any major defects aside from several marks on the roof. Large 4WD decals remain clear and uncut. Body panels line up well and look devoid of notable dings, dents or bends. Sheet metal is free of meaningful corrosion according to the seller. \nPlastic cladding and minimal bright trim are complete and undistorted. Faired-in headlights appear free of cracks, as does the continuous band of taillights and reflectors in the rear. Presentable factory wheels wear older rubber that the seller will replace with new all-season or winter tires at the preference of the winning bidder. \nFabric upholstery, carpets, checkered mats and headliner all show minimal evidence of use. Configurable seating includes foldaway jump seats and the middle row can face forward, rearward, or outward as detailed in the gallery below. All headrests are present along with curtains for middle and rear seating. \nVinyl surfaces and plastic trim are largely presentable despite occasional marking and signs of use. Stock controls, switchgear, and gauges look complete and a period AM radio and cassette deck remain in the dash. Front and rear air conditioning is said to be working. \nThe mid-mounted 2C-T 2.0L turbodiesel inline-four carried an initial rating of 80 horsepower and is linked to a 5-speed manual transmission. A service sticker reportedly indicates a timing belt replacement at 93k kilometers. Clutch feel is described as light and the engine is said to make plenty of power for around-town responsiveness and highway cruising, reportedly averaging over 25 mpg in daily driving.

(Photo: Justin Sullivan / Getty Images) \nWashington — Toyota Motor Corp. has agreed to pay more than $3 billion to compensate owners of trucks with frames that are likely to rust through.\nThe payouts will go to approximately 1.5 million owners of certain Tacoma, Tundra and Sequoia trucks under the agreement approved by U.S. District Judge Fernando in a Los Angeles court on Wednesday. The proposed settlement includes Toyota Tacomas from model years 2005-2010, Tundras from model years 2007-2008 and Sequoia vehicles from model years 2005-2008.\nToyota is being tasked with paying between $1.75 million and $2.5 million to notify owners of the affected vehicles, as well as $9.75 million for attorneys’ fees and up to $150,000 in costs and expenses related to the court cases. The settlement also includes a proposed $2,500 incentive award for each class representative that is named in the case.\nToyota said the final amount of the settlement will be determined by attorneys for plaintiffs that are included in the settlement.\nThe Japanese automaker was accused of designing, manufacturing, distributing, advertising and selling “vehicles that allegedly lacked adequate rust protection on the vehicles’ frames that would allegedly result in premature rust corrosion,” according to the lawsuit that was initially filed by a Tacoma driver in Arkansas. The lawsuit initially focused on the Tacoma pick up, but it was later amended to include the company’s Tundra and Sequoia trucks by plaintiffs in California, Florida, Ohio and Louisiana.\nUnder the agreement, owners of the affected Toyotas will be able to have their frames inspected for up to 12 years from the first use of their vehicles and, if appropriate, have a frame replacement.\nThe settlement agreement states that the deal is not “an admission or concession of any liability or wrongdoing whatsoever” on behalf of Toyota.\nToyota said in a statement “we want our customers to have a great ownership experience, so we are pleased to resolve this litigation in a way that benefits them and demonstrates that we stand behind the quality and reliability of our vehicles.”\n“The ultimate size of the settlement depends on a number of factors, including the valuation of the benefits offered under the settlement,” the company said. “Plaintiffs’ counsel will have to explain how they’re reaching their valuation numbers. More important to us is that the agreement will deliver that value to our customers.”\nklaing@detroitnews.com \n(202) 662-8735 \nTwitter: @Keith_Laing",

      "text": "2015 Toyota 4Runner TRD Pro Test Drive and Review The go-anywhere 4Runner now goes further 2015 Toyota 4Runner TRD Pro. Photo © Toyota By Aaron Gold About.com Rating \nBack in the 1990s, when the SUV craze really started to take off, automakers used to run magazine ads showing their SUVs in remote off-road locations. The promise of adventure was a major selling point, and since most SUVs were based on truck chassis, they really could go pretty far off the beaten path. Over the ensuing two decades, SUVs evolved into road-friendly crossovers, trading the off-road capability that their owners rarely used for the fuel economy they so desperately need. That's a bit of shame, considering we live in a country that offers a treasure trove of scenic adventure for those willing to venture beyond the pavement. \nOne SUV that has remained true to its off-road roots is the Toyota 4Runner . Freshly redesigned for 2014, the 4Runner retains its durable body-on-frame construction and adds some rather impressive off-road hardware from the world-famous Land Cruiser . 2015 sees a new TRD Pro edition, which allows owners to venture even father (and faster) into the wilderness than they might have imagined possible. \nWhat is TRD? \n\" TRD \" stands for Toyota Racing Development, a division that makes go-faster and go-farther parts for Toyota vehicles. Last year, TRD sold $23 million worth of accessories, so it's no surprise that Toyota has decided to take things further with the factory-prepped 4Runner TRD Pro edition. In fact, the 4Runner is one of three new-for-2015 TRD Pro models; there are also special editions of the Tundra and Tacoma pickup trucks. \nBased on the 4Runner Trail trim level, the TRD Pro edition adds a long list of heavy-duty off-road equipment. TRD/ Eibach springs at all four corners soften the ride and raise the front-end ride height by 1.5\", and big Bilstein shocks (2.5\" diameter in front, 2.0\" with remote reservoirs at the rear) increase wheel travel by 1\". Unique black wheels wear Nitto Terra Grappler tires, and a quarter-inch aluminum skid plate protects the front differential and powertrain, supplementing the 4Runner's existing fuel tank and transfer case skid plates. Styling changes include a unique grille, TRD PRO badges, red stitching on the seats, and TRD Pro shift knob and floor mats. Pricing had not been announced at the time of our test drive, but we expect the TRD Pro edition to run several thousand dollars more than the $36,585 4Runner Trail. \nWhere can you go with TRD Pro? \nI've had the opportunity to do slow-speed off-roading with the 4Runner, and it's a very impressive piece of kit. I love the Crawl Control system, which allows the 4Runner to slowly pick its way up and down terrain too uneven to walk over. It automates the off-roaders' mantra of \"Slow as possible, fast as necessary.\" \nThe 4Runner TRD Pro opens up a new kind of off-roading: High-speed, Baja 1000-style trail bashing. Toyota brought us to the outskirts of Las Vegas, Nevada, to put the 4Runner and other TRD Pro models to the test -- and that meant putting the hammer down on trails of dirt and gravel. It's an experience I have never had: I'd see bumps ahead that I thought for sure would bend a wheel, I'd brace for impact, and the 4Runner would float over them as softly as a 1976 Cadillac Coupe deVille , the extra suspension travel soaking up the shock and keeping the 4Runner's suspension bits well clear of their bump stops. If by some chance we did catch a rock, the big Nitto tires and industrial-strength skid plates kept the 4Runner well protected. And as I later discovered back home in California on some steep off-road trails, the TRD Pro bits only enhance the 4Runner's prodigious obstacle-crawling abilities. \nWhat about on-road performance? One of the advantages of factory design (rather than aftermarket parts) is integration with the vehicle, and that shows in the way the TRD Pro 4Runner goes down paved roads. The suspension and tires soften the ride and the steering precision a bit, but not much, and road noise isn't much louder than the regular 4Runner. Of course, the TRD Pro model suffers the same limitations of the 4Runner's body-on-frame construction: Less interior space, slower acceleration, and lower fuel economy than lighter \"crossover\" SUVs like Toyota's own Highlander . \n..And it looks really, really cool! \nLet's not forget that the 4Runner TRD Pro looks really, really cool. Available in just three colors -- black, white, and the orange seen in the photos -- with its nose-high stance, black wheels, and classic \"TOYOTA\" badging on the grille, this thing looks like it's ready to take on whatever surface you choose to put under its wheels, paved or not. \nWhile I'm sure many will buy the Toyota 4Runner TRD Pro on looks alone, this may well be the ultimate family adventure vehicle, one properly equipped to explore parts of this beautiful country that few of her citizens get to see. Let the adventure begin. -- Aaron Gold \nDisclosure: Review samples were provided by the manufacturer. For more information, please see our Ethics Policy .",

      "text": "Reports state that Lexus is all set to follow Toyota into the hydrogen fuel cell car market, and is expected to come up with a new luxury model that should go on sale by the year 2020. Lexus’ anticipated model would follow the footsteps of the Toyota Mirai, the world’s first commercially available fuel cell car, but will showcase the former’s performance and luxury oriented lineage.\nAlain Uyttenhoven, head of Lexus Europe, told reporters that Lexus is currently working on the hydrogen-fuelled technology, that’s developed by the parent company Toyota, for its upcoming cars. “The problem is packaging the technology into a normal sized car,\" he told us. \"It will fit into an SUV. We just need to get the right level of performance for a premium car.”\nThis also means that the market can anticipate a substantial power increment over what’s produced by the hydrogen fuel cell powertrain in the Mirai, which Toyota claims, makes 152bhp from its electric motors. That’s enough performance for the Mirai to despatch the 100kmph sprint from standstill in 9.6sec before hitting an impressive top speed of 178kmph.\nIt sure looks like Lexus is on track to keep exciting customers while conforming to the future emission regulations.",

      "text": "(CNN) - A three-wheeled, two-seater electric vehicle called the Toyota I-Road is being billed as a “personal mobility vehicle” - an innovation that lands somewhere between a car and a motorbike.\nAt 3 feet wide and 7 feet long, the futuristic vehicle is minuscule. It has built-in safety software that controls how deep it leans, based on the driver's speed.If the driver goes too fast, the steering wheel will vibrate as a gentle reminder to slow down to prevent the i-Road from tipping over.\nThe i-Road, developed to accommodate city dwellers, takes about three hours to charge and can go about 30 miles per hour, with a top speed of 37 mph. Two of them can easily fit into a small of parking slot, and the vehicle can weave through traffic while reducing congestion and carbon emissions, the company said.\nCopyright 2016 CNN. ",

      "text": "\nPhoto credit : Demilked via Bored Panda \nThe production of Toyota automobiles was started in 1933 as a division of Toyoda Automatic Loom Works devoted to the production of automobiles under the direction of the founder's son, Kiichiro Toyoda. Its first vehicles were the A1 passenger car and the G1 in 1935. The Toyota Motor Co. was established as an independent company in 1937. Since then, the company's logo has changed many times, but the most recent iteration actually has the letters \"Toyota\" hidden inside it. Continue reading for more hidden meanings in famous logos.

      "text": "Toyota Motor Corp. has agreed to pay up to about $3.4 billion to settle claims that certain of its trucks and sport-utility vehicles lacked proper rust protection, leading to premature corrosion of vehicle frames.\nThe agreement is a substantial financial setback at a time when the Japanese auto giant's record-breaking profit streak has slowed in recent quarters as a strong yen dents its performance. The company also is part of a broader group of auto makers facing plateauing retail sales in the profitable U.S. market.\nThe deal won preliminary approval from a U.S. District Judge in Los Angeles this week and settles litigation in two states over problems with Toyota Tacoma trucks from model years 2005 to 2010, Tundras from 2007 to 2008 and Sequoias from 2005 to 2008.\nAround 1.5 million vehicles in the U.S. are covered by the settlement, court filings show.\nThe agreement represents a significant settlement for the auto industry and follows several costly agreements auto makers have forged in recent years to address quality, safety or emissions issues in vehicles.\nGeneral Motors Co. recalled millions of vehicles in 2014 and spent billions of dollars to address ignition-switch problems linked to 124 deaths; Volkswagen AG forged a $14.7 billion deal more recently to settle with U.S. drivers of diesel-powered cars affected by an emissions-cheating scheme.\nSeveral auto makers, including Toyota, continue to work with Takata Corp. to repair tens of millions of air bags in the largest automotive safety campaign in history.\n\"We want our customers to have a great ownership experience, so we are pleased to resolve this litigation in a way that benefits them and demonstrates that we stand behind the quality and reliability of our vehicles,\" Toyota said.\nThe settlement was reported earlier by The Detroit News.\nToyota and plaintiffs' lawyers said the deal, which is still subject to final court approval, reflects months of negotiation. As part of the agreement, Toyota doesn't admit to any wrongdoing.\nOnce approved, consumers will be entitled to an inspection of their vehicles and ultimately replacement of its frame if the car is found to have the faulty rust protection. Car owners who already have replaced their frames will also be reimbursed.\nCourt documents peg the cost of inspection to Toyota under the accord at $90 a vehicle and to replace each frame at $15,000.\nThe deal also sets aside up to $9.9 million for attorneys' fees and expenses. Toyota said it would pay between $1.75 million and $2.5 million to notify potential affected consumers by mail and through publication notices and internet campaigns.\nAttorneys for consumers called the settlement \"the result of hard-fought litigation\" and a \"complete and total success\" for affected drivers. Toyota said in its own filing that while it \"disputes and contests the allegations in these class actions lawsuits,\" the deal \"represents a reasonable and fair way to end the controversy.\"\nThe litigation dates back to 2014, when consumers filed a lawsuit in Arkansas that was later combined with litigation in California.\n--John D.

      "text": "| License Photo LOS ANGELES, Nov. 12 (UPI) -- Japanese automaker Toyota agreed to a $3.4 billion settlement after metal body frames on its pickups and SUVs were found to lack sufficient rust protection, causing them to prematurely corrode.\nAccording to court filings , the settlement, which won preliminary approval from a federal judge in Los Angeles earlier this week, covers about 1.5 million vehicles in the United States. Toyota owners in two states filed suit over problems with their vehicles, which include Toyota Tacoma trucks from model years 2005 to 2010, Tundras from 2007 to 2008 and Sequoias from 2005 to 2008.\nUnder the terms of the deal, Toyota must notify owners of the affected vehicles and perform annual inspections for up to 12 years from the first year the individual owned the truck. If premature corrosion is found, Toyota will replace the frames at no cost to the vehicle's owner.\nThe Detroit News reported the ultimate size of the settlement could change depending on the number of vehicles the company actually has to repair.\nThe company released a statement confirming the settlement, saying, \"we want our customers to have a great ownership experience, so we are pleased to resolve this litigation in a way that benefits them and demonstrates that we stand behind the quality and reliability of our vehicles.\"\n Yahoo! admits it knew of user data hacks two years before acknowledging them Disney falls short of expectations with $13B revenue in Q4 Google responds to EU antitrust charges, says Android hasn't hurt competition",

      "text": "Toyota to produce first electric car by 2020   6:53pm The 2015 Toyota Mirai. Photo: via In4Ride.net \nThis might sound a bit “duhh”, but Toyota is reportedly developing a new range of electric cars. \nWhile it’s true that Japan’s number one automaker is a pioneer and leader in hybrid systems, it has not actually produced an electric vehicle for the masses. \nThe year 2020 changes all that. 2015 Toyota Mirai. \nWord is, Toyota will begin to produce a full-fledged electric vehicle for the general public – unlike Tesla which makes high-end models only – from the year 2020. \nMind you, in addition to the hybrids, and plug-in hybrids it already makes, the company is now also selling fuel-cell cars, the first of which is the Mirai (pictured here). \nThe first of these cars is said to have a range of around 300km, which is similar to that the BMW i3 REX can achieve.

REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon \nToyota Motor Corp ( 7203.T ) has agreed to a settlement of up to $3.4 billion for a federal class action brought by U.S. owners of pickup trucks and SUVs whose frames could rust through, plaintiffs lawyers have said in court papers. \nThe proposed settlement covers about 1.5 million Tacoma compact pickups, Tundra full-size pickups and Sequoia SUVs alleged to have received inadequate rust protection that could lead to corrosion serious enough to jeopardize their structural integrity, according to court papers. \nAttorneys for the plaintiffs in court papers supporting the settlement estimated the value of frame replacements at about $3.375 billion based on a cost of about $15,000 per vehicle and the inspections at about $90 million at $60 per vehicle. \nToyota admitted no liability or wrongdoing in the proposed settlement filed on Wednesday before U.S. District Judge Fernando Olguin in Los Angeles. \n\"We want our customers to have a great ownership experience, so we are pleased to resolve this litigation in a way that benefits them and demonstrates that we stand behind the quality and reliability of our vehicles,\" Toyota said in a statement. \nUnder the settlement terms, Toyota will inspect the vehicles for 12 years from the day they were first sold or leased to determine whether frames need to be replaced at company expense and reimburse owners who previously paid for frame replacement. \nThe settlement reached on Oct. 31 covers Tacoma trucks from the model years 2005 through 2010, Sequoias from 2005 through 2008 and Tundras from the 2007 and 2008 model years. \nToyota also agreed to pay $9.75 million in attorneys' fees, $150,000 in costs and expenses, and $2,500 each to the named eight class representatives as well as the cost of advertising the settlement. \n(Reporting by David Bailey in Minneapolis; Editing by Bernard Orr) Next In U.S.",

      "text": "Toyota to Pay $3.4 Billion in Tacoma Rusted Frames Lawsuit Toyota Tacoma, Tundra and Sequoia trucks with rusted frames to be fixed for $3.4 billion. Toyota Tacoma, Tundra and Sequoia trucks with rusted frames to be fixed for $3.4 billion. \nNovember 12, 2016 — Toyota Tacoma rusted frames will cost the automaker about $3.4 billion after Toyota agreed to settle a class-action lawsuit that alleges Tacoma frames rust and cause serious safety hazards on the roads. \nThe Toyota Tacoma frame rust lawsuit includes 2005-2010 Tacoma, 2007-2008 Tundra and 2005-2008 Sequoia trucks at risk of corrosion that eats away at the frames. \nThe lawsuit alleges the truck frames rust prematurely because they weren't properly protected with anti-rust chemicals at the factory, leaving the frames too naked against salt water and other elements that corrode the frames. \nThe plaintiffs say this failure causes perforations in the frames that weaken the structural integrity of the trucks, leaving them particularly vulnerable in a crash. \nToyota has suffered from frame rust complaints for years that caused the automaker to issue warranty extensions and certain recalls. But according to some truck owners, the corrosion and rust problems have still caused nothing but grief. \n\"While driving 2 mph, the contact heard an abnormal noise underneath the vehicle. The dealer repaired the vehicle under NHTSA campaign number: 14V604000 (suspension); however, the failure recurred. The vehicle was taken to an independent mechanic who stated that the subframe and rear passenger side leaf spring fractured due to corrosion. The mechanic diagnosed that the subframe needed to be replaced.\" - 2009 Toyota Tacoma owner / Newport, Vermont \nThe \"NHTSA campaign number: 14V604000\" referenced in the complaint above refers to a recall of 690,000 model year 2005-2011 Tacoma trucks for rust and corrosion problems, but the recall involved only the rear suspension leaf springs. \nAnother Toyota truck owner said his Tacoma is a victim of a rusted frame, but his dealership didn't think the problem was serious enough to take action. \n\"Apparently some 2007 Tacoma's have excessive frame rust, and my vehicle is one of them. The frames were not undercoated correctly and have excessive, extreme rust, while the body is fine. Toyota will only cover the repair or correction to the frame, if there is a HOLE through the frame (from rust). Think about it, if your frame is rusted to the point of having a hole through it, you are in serious danger.\" - 2007 Toyota Tacoma owner / San Antonia, Texas \nToyota customers also complain about being blamed for the rust problems for allegedly not cleaning under the trucks. \n\"Had a 1998 Tacoma - frame rotted to the point that the truck was unsafe to drive in early 2007. Traded for $5000 for 2007 Tacoma as was assured by corporate Toyota that frame rot was due to me not washing the undercarriage enough. It's all very disheartening. So much for Toyota quality and dealer integrity!\" - 2007 Toyota Tacoma owner / Kalamazoo, Michigan \nIf the settlement agreement is approved by the court, Toyota will replace the truck frame if rust has perforated the surface 10 mm or more, something that may be a huge expense to the automaker at $15,000 per truck. Based on court documents, it's believed as many as 1.5 million Toyota Tacoma, Tundra and Sequoia trucks may be eligible for repairs. \nThe automaker also agreed to spend about $90 million for inspections, which equals to about $60 per vehicle, and money will also be paid to any affected truck owner who already paid to have their frame replaced. \nThe Toyota Tacoma rusted frame   Central District of California - Brian Warner, et al. v.

      "text": "2017 Hyundai Ioniq Hybrid is ready to fight Toyota's Prius Hyundai's all-new Ioniq Hybrid promises 58 mpg and less controversial aesthetics than Toyota's latest Prius. Read Less \nHyundai's Ioniq Hybrid looks decidedly more conventional than Toyota's new Prius. Published: November 11, 2016 9:21 AM PST Photo by: Hyundai / Caption by: Chris Paukert \nHyundai has not yet released pricing for the Ioniq family, but looking slightly below where Toyota prices its Prius equivalents is probably a good place to start. Published: November 11, 2016 9:21 AM PST Photo by: Hyundai / Caption by: Chris Paukert \nThe Ioniq's teardrop five-door shape is a boon for aerodynamics. Published: November 11, 2016 9:21 AM PST Photo by: Hyundai / Caption by: Chris Paukert \nThe Hybrid will be one of three Ioniq family models by the end of 2018, with the others offering plug-in hybrid and pure electric powertrains. Published: November 11, 2016 9:21 AM PST Photo by: Hyundai / Caption by: Chris Paukert \nThe Ioniq's interior boasts seating for five regardless of powertrain. Toyota's Prius Prime plug-in hybrid only seats four due to its battery-pack placement. Published: November 11, 2016 9:21 AM PST Photo by: Hyundai / Caption by: Chris Paukert \nHyundai says the Ioniq's dual-clutch gearbox affords sportier performance than its continuously variable transmission competition. We'll just see about that.

      "text": "print \nNov 12 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp has agreed to a settlement of up to $3.4 billion for a federal class action brought by U.S. owners of pickup trucks and SUVs whose frames could rust through, plaintiffs lawyers have said in court papers. \nThe proposed settlement covers about 1.5 million Tacoma compact pickups, Tundra full-size pickups and Sequoia SUVs alleged to have received inadequate rust protection that could lead to corrosion serious enough to jeopardize their structural integrity, according to court papers. \nAttorneys for the plaintiffs in court papers supporting the settlement estimated the value of frame replacements at about $3.375 billion based on a cost of about $15,000 per vehicle and the inspections at about $90 million at $60 per vehicle. \nToyota admitted no liability or wrongdoing in the proposed settlement filed on Wednesday before U.S. District Judge Fernando Olguin in Los Angeles. \n\"We want our customers to have a great ownership experience, so we are pleased to resolve this litigation in a way that benefits them and demonstrates that we stand behind the quality and reliability of our vehicles,\" Toyota said in a statement. \nUnder the settlement terms, Toyota will inspect the vehicles for 12 years from the day they were first sold or leased to determine whether frames need to be replaced at company expense and reimburse owners who previously paid for frame replacement. \nThe settlement reached on Oct. 31 covers Tacoma trucks from the model years 2005 through 2010, Sequoias from 2005 through 2008 and Tundras from the 2007 and 2008 model years. \nToyota also agreed to pay $9.75 million in attorneys' fees, $150,000 in costs and expenses, and $2,500 each to the named eight class representatives as well as the cost of advertising the settlement.
