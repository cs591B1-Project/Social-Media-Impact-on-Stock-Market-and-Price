I guess it's a way to get around the GC or GG tax but in some way breaks my idea of what a Math Trade typically is - trading my old unwanted stuff for your old unwanted stuff. I may do this in the future to try to get something good. It is. I'm waiting to see if the admin object at some point since it seems s pretty blatant way to evade the hassle of a gift card. I'm sure those doing it are justifying this by claiming they are just monetizing their existing Prime membership and it's free shipping as a value-add.Unfortunately I'm not sure how easily one can create a rule to stop it since in theory one could innocuously do it - I mean I once did something similar when I had s large (inexpensive) game going to Cali in a math trade. The cost to ship was actually larger than amazon's new price. People are always going to look for a new way to take advantage of things. It's also a way to circumvent the arbitrage rules, and I think that is more of the intent than avoiding the BGG commission (since as the GC giver that isn't a hassle for THEM). No existing rules stopping someone for trading for a $40 GC with a game that costs $35 on Amazon (with free shipping).Instant free $5.This isn't entirely why I stopped moderating, but these sorts of shenanigans contributed to my lack of desire to go forward.",

      "text": "Send Message Summary \nEven with slightly less market share for cyber weekend, Amazon will still do more business than last year. \nHow its competitors fared and what to consider for remainder of 2016. \nThe best way to think of e-commerce going forward. \nOnline sales will continue to grow significantly - this year and over the next several years. Source: multichannel merchant If the figures from cyber weekend are reflective of e-commerce spending in the U.S. during the Christmas season, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) may not do as well this year, as measured by market share, than last year. This year, according to data from Slice Intelligence , Amazon's share of Cyber Weekend fell slightly year-over-year to 30.9 percent. Last year, the e-commerce giant accounted for 31.1 percent of total Cyber Weekend sales. These results aren't a measure of online visits, but online shopping receipts. Slice scanned more than 1 million online receipts when gathering the data. Following far behind Amazon at the e-commerce level was Best Buy (NYSE: BBY ), which garnered 7.4 percent of the total for the weekend. After following a surprisingly solid third quarter, this is good news for its shareholders. Last year, Best Buy had 6.1 percent of market share for the weekend. If that growth continues on for the remainder of the Christmas season, it will surprise shareholders once again with a solid quarter. After Best Buy were Target (NYSE: TGT ) with 4.4 percent of e-commerce sales and Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT ) with 4.1 percent. Other companies making a nice upward move in relationship to market share were Kohl's (NYSE: KSS ), which jumped from 2.3 percent last year to 2.7 percent this year, and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), which climbed from 0.9 percent in 2015 to 1.5 percent in 2016. Source: Slice Intelligence How to think of e-commerce growth and online market share With e-commerce growth going to continue at a hefty pace over the next several years at least, investors need to understand this isn't a zero-sum game. Not only is that true if market leaders continue to grow share, but also for those that may be losing share. The reason for that is the segment of the market is growing so fast, it is overcoming the loss of market share for those companies not hanging on to it during this ongoing growth spurt, meaning they are making more money even while losing share. I'm not saying that's a positive, but as far as short-term results, it will overcome the loss of share, although it points to concerns for the future of companies losing that share. According to Adobe Digital Insights, e-commerce sales for the top 100 U.S. retailers climbed by 7.6 percent to $39.97 billion from Nov. 1 to Nov. 28. It wasn't made clear if sales from Amazon were included in those numbers. Adobe projects that online sales will soar to $91.6 billion in 2016, an increase of 11 percent. Some companies will lose some market share while gaining revenue, and presumably earnings. That's how investors should evaluate the short-term performance of U.S. retailers during this season, and for the next several, until data confirm the pace of e-commerce growth in the U.S. is slowing down. For now, e-commerce growth will overcome slight loss of market share, but it does point to concerns over the \"why\" of that loss of share, and the long-term performance of retailers that are losing it. Click to enlarge Source: StockCharts.com Most visited websites Data from ComScore revealed the most visited websites for Cyber Monday were Amazon, eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY ), Wal-Mart, Kohl's and Target. The immediate concern, assuming the spending trend continues through the remainder of the Christmas season, is why some of these leaders as measured by visits, are losing market share. On the opposite side of that, it's a positive to think in terms of those not getting near the visits being able to boost market share. The two major concerns are Amazon and Wal-Mart, which both lost market share even though they attracted a lot of traffic. In retail, that could suggest a lot of things; the major one being whether or not competitors had to sacrifice margins and earnings to generate higher sales. In other words, did they have to cut prices to generate revenue. Under that scenario, if that is how it is shown to play out for the holiday season, it could mean Wal-Mart and Amazon were better off with smaller share, if it is reflected in earnings. If it's not, then it points to other competitive problems they will have to deal with. Other retailers that could experience a disappointing holiday season are Macy's (NYSE: M ), Nordstrom (NYSE: JWN ) and J. Crew. All of them performed weak during Cyber Weekend. We'll have to wait to see if the failure of Macy's website during the important weekend continues to haunt the company for December. Of all of these, Wal-Mart is the most concerning to me, as its share for the weekend plummeted from 5.1 percent in 2015 to 4.1 percent in 2016. That happened even with solid online traffic. If that continues on, Wal-Mart has a lot of work to do to turn itself around. Conclusion I'm not concerned about Amazon yet, but it does appear, based upon the important data from Cyber Weekend, it is experiencing competitive pressure from a variety of retailers. That makes its job harder in figuring out how to respond and grow its share. Even though Cyber Weekend is important, it's only a snapshot of a small part of overall spending during the Christmas season. A lot of traffic and sales is driven by one-off sales for particular products that don't continue on for the rest of the year. That could easily mean Amazon in particular will rebound through the rest of 2016, as its core Prime members ramp up spending. Wal-Mart may also surprise to the upside, based upon its web traffic numbers. If share for Amazon continues at this pace, it would appear to reflect the possibility discounting on strategic products wasn't all that resulted in it losing share. If that's the case, it will have to quickly figure out why it happened and how to respond to it. For now, Amazon is doing fine, as the growth in the e-commerce segment of the market will easily overcome a loss of share, if that's how it plays out for the last quarter. Amazon will enjoy revenue growth for the quarter and should be rewarded for that in its share price. Further out, shareholders will want to know if it's becoming vulnerable to competitors who are closing the gap in the minds of consumers.

      "text": "Quote from: ie007cheung on December 02, 2016, 04:12:08 AM Quote from: Vod on December 02, 2016, 02:58:09 AM People can go off the mental \"deep end\" for a billion reasons. A company cannot control everything.I could find it cold in my cubicle and go insane shooting everyone in my building because the gunpowder explosions heat up the area. Is the company responsible for that? In this case the employee was under high pressure at the work place. It is not a pure mental problem of this employee.There are plenty of ways Amazon can handle this case better. There are going to be alot of these this time of year. Near the holidays.Alot of depression by people being lonely and everything comes crashing down from the year all at once at the end to deal with. Pathetic douche bags that don't realize they are a fucked up mess.Lonely ? = Mental Illness.I see them wandering around through life and they are almost always insufferable idiots.They want to play this game where they say i'm an \"Extrovert\" etc.No you are just an insecure douche.If you are insecure then you have a mental problem.I had a chat with an ex-girlfriend who told me basically she was afraid to be alone with herself and her thoughts.Basket case !These people crave attention etc and are often kids.. with low self esteem.Get your god damn shit together people !I spent about a month in a cabin in Northern Ontario many years ago by myself in the middle of winter and never left the house aside from occasionally walking a long winding forest road at night to go to an outdoor rink to play hockey with my ice skates and it was the best time of my life.No People ? = Pure god damn fucking bliss. People are irritating fucking idiots.. some worse than others. On-Topic ? Yeah he had pre-existing mental problems.Pushed on further from his work environment.I get it..Your situation can become pretty screwed up and things can look bad.. but !That is just then.. things can change and get better. Ride it out work on your shit and move forward. Again it wraps around back to self esteem again.And once again it becomes obvious when material possessions money and shit like that becomes too important.I would be more understanding if the guy lost his wife or child.. than i would a fucking job at Amazon. It's all about perspective and your agenda.You can sit in a pit of shit if you see the tunnel at the end (hope / goals)Look at the prisoners on the old TV show Hogans Heroes. I think far more people are mentally ill than they realize !What would YOU do if you were cooped up in a cabin like i was like on the movie The Shining for a month ?I guarantee 75% of the little shits in the world would rapidly go back shit insane.Lots would prob jump off a roof.. no attention ? nobody to show how much of a success you are ?Just a matter of the situation popping up to push them to that point.Predisposed to fail.",

      "text": "Amazon, Intel Partner For New Alexa Products Karen Tumbokon Pin it Share At Amazon’s Web Services conference re:Invent this week, the retail giant announced its teaming up with Intel for a smart speaker reference design with Amazon’s Alexa voice assistant to help with tasks. More At Amazon’s Web Services conference re: Invent this week, the retail giant announced it is teaming up with Intel for a smart speaker reference design with Amazon’s Alexa voice assistant to help with tasks. The device is meant to help other companies make their own gadgets using Amazon’s voice tech and Intel’s platform. Developers will be able to get their hands on the device during the first quarter of 2017. Intel’s Smart Home Hub uses Alexa voice controls, making it easy to ask questions and more. This means Intel is helping developers build connected products that can be controlled with voice commands. \"With voice as the central interface, customers have an even more natural way to manage the hundreds of tasks they experience every day,\" said Alexa content marketing manager Ted Karczewski in an Amazon developer blog post . Both Amazon and Intel are looking to expand their network so it integrates into the home. Alexa already has some smart home skills through Echo , like being able to control Logitech’s Harmony Hub. Earlier this year, Intel formed a partnership with Microsoft, Samsung, Qualcomm, Cisco, GE Digital and others to help connected products in your house talk to each other. Intel also announced a chip for the IoT industry in October. This smart speaker reference design \"is intended to help hardware manufacturers accelerate their development of voice-enabled devices with the Intel platform and Alexa Voice Services,” Intel said in a statement today. The speaker will “support the standards needed for PAN connectivity in the home, including Wi-Fi, Zigbee, Z-Wave, and Bluetooth, and is extensible enough to add video capabilities and environment sensors for an all-in-one customer experience,’ Karczewski wrote .

      "text": "View Comments While Muslims in Malaysia have been enraged over the mats stuffed with pages of the Quran, which the Department of Islamic Development Malaysia (Jakim) has said it will take action against its distributor, online retail giant Amazon, has found itself embroiled in a similar controversy. British Muslim politician in Birmingham, Mariam Khan, was alerted by a number of constituents that the e-commerce site was carrying Islamic doormats and dog mats with Allah’s name on it. She took to Twitter to write a complaint and urged for the items to be removed: These mats are extremely offensive to Muslims & out of order. @amazon @AmazonHelp please remove these from your site immediately. pic.twitter.com/b1syDWPDVC — Mariam Khan (@mariamkhan29) November 28, 2016 The product for wiping feet that had Allah’s name featured on it has since been taken down and the councillor has received an apology from Amazon. They claimed the mats were placed on the site by a third party seller, who simply used Amazon as a platform to sell its products, while stressing they were oblivious to the offensive nature of the item, according to Birmingham Mail. “After a lot of confusion, I’ve been told by Amazon that they will remove the items and apologise for offence caused,” she relayed. Amazon spokesman later confirmed with the Sunday Mercury : “We can confirm that the products are no longer for sale.” The grassroots politician went on to say, “I think it would be offensive for anyone of any religious faith to have items such as this on their doorstep with their religious scriptures on them to wipe their feet on. “If these items had words from the Bible on them, they would be just as offensive.” “I feel it is targeting Islam and flies in the face of what is a very good TV advert for Christmas that includes an Imam and priest. It highlights a multi-faith approach,” she said pointing out the sale ironically came in after the current Amazon Christmas advert, promoting racial and religious harmony. Other users joined in to protest the retail giant’s mishap, while others continued to leave offensive remarks. Apart from the blasphemy, many have wrote in to say if Muslims were offended \"then don't buy one\", including conservative talk show host Phil Valentine who also tweeted: “Amazon caves to pressure to remove Allah doormats. What happened to if you’re offended don’t buy it?” However, Amazon’s terms and conditions prohibit them from selling of any items ‘that promote or glorify hatred, violence, racial, sexual or religious intolerance or promote organizations with such views’ – and they have since complied with Mariam’s request.

      "text": "Top Scientists: Amazon's Tapajós Dam Complex \"a Crisis in the Making\" Top Scientists: Amazon's Tapajós Dam Complex \"a Crisis in the Making\" By 0 25 \nThe Tapajós River, Brazil. More than 40 dams would turn this free-flowing river and its tributaries into a vast industrial waterway threatening the Tapajós Basin’s ecosystems, wildlife, people and even the regional and global climate. (Photo: International Rivers on Flickr, licensed under an Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 2.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-SA 2.0) license) \nBrazil is forging ahead with plans to build a vast hydropower dam complex in the heart of the Amazon that would convert the now remote and wild Tapajós river system into a tamed industrial waterway for the purpose of transporting soybeans — development that scientists and NGOs say will threaten Amazonian biodiversity , ecosystems, traditional livelihoods, indigenous cultures, and the global climate. \nA total of 42 large dams are planned or under construction in the Tapajós Basin, a biologically and culturally rich region, and one of eight areas of Amazonian biological endemism . Fed by tributaries in the states of Mato Grosso, Rondônia and Amazonas, the main stem of the Tapajós flows northeast through Pará state, and drains into the Amazon River at the city of Santarém. The Basin covers 189,962 square miles (492,000 square kilometers) and is more than twice the size of the UK. \nIts forests and waterways are home to species such as the jaguar, giant otter, and river dolphin, as well as little-known and range-restricted species found nowhere else in the world. Many plants and animals here remain unknown to science. Traditional river communities and indigenous people rely upon the basin’s natural resources for their livelihoods. \nA lowland tapir (Tapirus terrestris) swimming across a river. This is just one of many threatened species in the Tapajós region, a vast area recognized as one the Amazon’s eight areas of biological endemism.

See the hottest Zuri Tibby photos from the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show 2016 at the Grand Palais in Paris. \nThe Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show 2016 started with a bang in Paris. There were supermodels galore and the Angels looked devilishly hot. It was a time of colors, forms and superbly-designed lingeries. Among one of the attractions of the show was Zuri Tibby. \nSee the Best Photos of the Victoria's Secret Show 2016 \nZuri Tibby was born in Florida in 1995. She is a Virgo. She felt really good about being the first black model for the PINK brand that Victoria’s Secret is so famous for. She said that it felt absolutely amazing to be doing this. Zuri spoke of how she felt proud to be such a role model for many women who looked up to her. She used to work at a mall. \nLater on when she became a model, she could not believe her luck. She even toured here and there in the PINK bus. Like many others she too had never dreamt of becoming a Victoria’s Secret model. \nShe wore a pink-colored cap, bra (with grey shades) and pink sleeves on the runway in Paris. Her back was covered by a large bowtie that was pink in color too. Her white socks and trailing pink cape sure made her prominent as an ebony queen that knew what she wanted and liked to have her own way. \nAfter the show, Zuri wrote on Instagram, \"Yesterday was the most amazing moment of my life! If you know me you know that I have been dreaming of walking the #vsfs runway forever! Thank you for the opportunity and thank you for the amazing trip to Paris.. everyone involved!\" A photo posted by Zuri (@angelzuri) on Dec 1, 2016 at 1:57pm PST \nThe Victoria's Secret Fashion Show is months in the making. This year the show marks the 20th anniversary of the sexiest runway show. The Victoria's Secret fashion show has grown to a global TV event that draws an audience of about 500 million people world-wide. \nCBS will broadcast the 1 hour Victoria's Secret Fashion Show 2016 on December 5 at 10pm ET. The taped show will be shown in 190 countries around the world.",

      "text": "Amazon picks Xilinx UltraScale+ FPGAs to accelerate AWS, launches F1 instance with 8x VU9P FPGAs per instance by sleibso ‎11-30-2016 11:40 AM - edited ‎11-30-2016 04:01 PM (4,620 Views) \n\nJeff Barr, Chief Evangelist at Amazon Web Services, just unveiled the accelerated F1 instance of its AWS (Amazon Web Services) in developer preview form. The rollout came in the form of a blog titled “ Developer Preview – EC2 Instances (F1) with Programmable Hardware . ” \n\nBarr writes: \n\n“One of the more interesting routes to a custom, hardware-based solution is known as a Field Programmable Gate Array, or FPGA. In contrast to a purpose-built chip which is designed with a single function in mind and then hard-wired to implement it, an FPGA is more flexible. It can be programmed in the field, after it has been plugged in to a socket on a PC board. Each FPGA includes a fixed, finite number of simple logic gates. Programming an FPGA is “simply” a matter of connecting them up to create the desired logical functions (AND, OR, XOR, and so forth) or storage elements (flip-flops and shift registers). Unlike a CPU which is essentially serial (with a few parallel elements) and has fixed-size instructions and data paths (typically 32 or 64 bit), the FPGA can be programmed to perform many operations in parallel, and the operations themselves can be of almost any width, large or small. \n\n“This highly parallelized model is ideal for building custom accelerators to process compute-intensive problems. Properly programmed, an FPGA has the potential to provide a 30x speedup to many types of genomics, seismic analysis, financial risk analysis, big data search, and encryption algorithms and applications. \n\n“I hope that this sounds awesome and that you are chomping at the bit to use FPGAs to speed up your own applications! \n\n… \n\n“Today we are launching a developer preview of the new F1 instance. In addition to building applications and services for your own use, you will be able to package them up for sale and reuse in AWS Marketplace. Putting it all together, you will be able to avoid all of the capital-intensive and time-consuming steps that were once a prerequisite to the use of FPGA-powered applications, using a business model that is more akin to that used for every other type of software. We are giving you the ability to design your own logic, simulate and verify it using cloud-based tools, and then get it to market in a matter of days. \n\n“Equipped with Intel Broadwell E5 2686 v4 processors (2.3 GHz base speed, 2.7 GHz Turbo mode on all cores, and 3.0 GHz Turbo mode on one core), up to 976 GiB of memory, up to 4 TB of NVMe SSD storage, and one to eight FPGAs, the F1 instances provide you with plenty of resources to complement your core, FPGA-based logic. The FPGAs are dedicated to the instance and are isolated for use in multi-tenant environments. \n\n“Here are the specs on the FPGA (remember that there are up to eight of these in a single F1 instance): \nXilinx UltraScale+ VU9P fabricated using a 16 nm process. 64 GiB of ECC-protected memory on a 288-bit wide bus (four DDR4 channels). Dedicated PCIe x16 interface to the CPU. Approximately 2.5 million logic elements. Approximately 6,800 Digital Signal Processing (DSP) engines. Virtual JTAG interface for debugging. \n\n“In instances with more than one FPGA, dedicated PCIe fabric allows the FPGAs to share the same memory address space and to communicate with each other across a PCIe Fabric at up to 12 Gbps in each direction. The FPGAs within an instance share access to a 400 Gbps bidirectional ring for low-latency, high bandwidth communication (you’ll need to define your own protocol in order to make use of this advanced feature).” \n\nAmazon is also releasing a developer tool called AMI, “a set of developer tools that you can use in the AWS Cloud at no charge,” for AWS F1 application development. \n\n\n\nNote: For additional information on the extensive support Xilinx provides for hardware acceleration in cloud environments, click over to the Xilinx Acceleration Zone , where you’ll find helpful information about the newly announced Reconfigurable Acceleration Stack. (Also, see “ Xilinx Reconfigurable Acceleration Stack speeds programming of machine learning, data analytics, video-streaming apps .”) \n",

      "text": "Amazon Offers HBO And Cinemax, But At A Full Price \nThere are many things in life that are complicated: rocket science, film profit participation, and human relationships. \nOr more to Delos executive Charlotte’s (the sublime Tessa Thompson) exclamation in tonight’s finale, “This place is as complicated enough as it is.” That’s right, add Westworld to life’s list. \nHowever, that’s a positive testament to the pay cabler moving the needle on complex storytelling. No other network arguably could take a risk, get away with it, and paint such an acute, labyrinth episodic TV series, chock full of subtleties and Easter eggs that move the narrative. And after trying to figure out this Rubik’s Cube of a show for the last two months, “Bicameral Mind” is truly the best of the series 10 at nearly an hour and a half, given how much payoff there is in the episode. \nEven if one was half asleep during USA’s noir complexity Mr. Robot ‘s last summer, it was feasible to comprehend its mid-season twist that Elliot was in jail, and hallucinated the first half of the season as though he was secluding himself in his mother’s house. But with Westworld, it was essential to deep-six a trio of espressos before watching: Its characters quietly and casually tossed lines that pointed to bigger reveals. Ditto for the show’s production design, props and costumes which indicated that the action was taking place across three timelines (35 years ago, 30 years ago and present day). Read when Logan stabs Evan Rachel Wood’s Dolores in episode 9, we see her robotic guts are made of pistons, indicating, the action of the scene is taking place decades ago, because that’s how robots in the park were made then! It’s no wonder that Anthony Hopkin’s Dr. Ford explains a Leonardo Da Vinci painting to robo prairie girl Dolores, about the hidden human vein in it. \nTonight’s finale, “The Bicameral Mind”, marked the second episode to be directed by co-creator Jonathan Nolan after the premiere episode “The Original”. There were a number of twists and turns tonight, so we’ll try to pare it down to the essentials. \nAt the top of the list, we finally have a bingo: Young William (Jimmi Simposon) had grown into the Man in Black (Ed Harris), who invested in Westworld, arguably after the death of Dr. Ford’s partner Arnold. Fans were keen about this for quite some time, and finally, Harris’ black hat sharpshooter downloaded Dolores to the reality of who he really was. \nHow did a good guy go so bad? Well, William kept looking for Dolores. He double-crossed his douche brother in law Logan, whose family ran senior at Delos. And William finally learned who he was at his core — a violent, ruthless guy (“He found himself among the dead,” MIB says about his younger self). In sum, he got tired of chasing Dolores, but acknowledged, “I really ought to thank you Dolores, you really help me find myself”. They’re near the cemetery at the church. This is the center of the maze, and Ford has left a tin with a maze game in it near Dolores’ tombstone. MIB doesn’t get it. He’s pissed. He beats Dolores. She tells him, “One day you will perish…with the rest of your kind in the dirt, your bones will turn to sand, and upon that sand, a new God will walk. One that will never die.” If that isn’t a foreshadowing to the robot revolution, I don’t know what is. Later, later on the show, Ford confirms another point that clever fans had always figure all along: the timeline we’ve been traversing has been 35 years. Ford admits he’s been “trying to fix his mistakes” for the last 35. \nTeddy ultimately shoots MiB down, saves Dolores and trots her off to the sea where she dies in his arms. We later see MIB gets up, he’s approached by Dr. Robert Ford to attend a big soiree that night. Ya see, earlier in the show, Charlotte revealed that the board voted, and Ford will announce his retirement at a big party that night. It turns out part of Ford’s retirement has been the whole show of MIB tracking her down, and Teddy saving her. As Teddy lies with Dolores in his arms on the beach, like the end to some 1950s romance movie, he tells her “If we can find a way Dolores, some day, a path to a new world, and maybe, it’s just the beginning after all, the beginning of a brand new chapter.” He says this before an audience on the beach, clapping as though they’re on the Croisette at Cannes. Anthony Hopkins’ Dr. Robert Ford steps out and says the narrative is “Journey into Night”. It was all a show, and a tuxedo-clad MIB is in attendance. \nIn other news, Thandie Newton’s robo prostitute-turned-freedom fighter Maeve is doing it her way, “No one is controlling me, I’m leaving!” she tells a rebooted Bernard as she seeks to bust her way into our world with her posse of Hector and Armistice. Perhaps, they’re the new Gods in season 2? \nHQ learns about Maeve’s rebellion; they watch video of Armistice killing one of their technicians, however they’re locked in there. A swat-like team chases after them. The unit stands among a series of frozen robots. We see Hector and Armistice. She slices one of the Swat soldier’s necks. Armistice and Hector have guns and begin taking out the squad. Hector, Armistice, Hector, Maeves stumble upon a combat room. Somewhere during this melee, Maeves finds Bernard and wakes him up (which only confuses when all her rebellion is taking place–before, after or at the same time as Ford’s retirement party). He posses takes out more of the HQ’s squad members with their guns. Blood is splattered all over HQ. “The Gods are pussies,” says Armistice. Felix slips Maeves an attache case, “Everything you told me to get, it’s all in there,” he tells her. Possibly all the intel for the park? One piece of paper he leaves her with: the coordinates of her daugther’s whereabouts in the park. \n“I can’t take you with me darling,” Maeves tells Hecktor, I’ve always valued my independence”. The doors open and Maeves heads down the elevator. \nAfter the show, Dr. Ford takes Dolores back to the shop, wakes her and introduces her to Bernard (a new one? He was shot in the last episode). Ford reveals how Arnold re-calibrated Dolores. In short, it’s fair to say that as Arnold lost his child, Dolores was a new one for him to play with. He was trying to make a new free form robot in her (one we can obviously was a terminator-killing machine). Essentially, suffering spurred the motivations of these androids. In a flashback, we see the scene whereby Dolores shoots Arnold (who looks Bernard), then Teddy, before turning the gun on her prairie-dressed self. \nBack in the elevator, Felix tells Maeves that her daughter is alive in the park. “No,” says Maeves, “she was never my daughter any more than I was”. She loads a gun, complements Felix on being a terrible human being, and enters the subway lobby to head out of Westworld HQ. Later on, the pant clad Dolores learns that her prairie dressed-self was talking to her and guiding her all along; not Arnold. \nMaeves sees a mother and daughter, and longs for the daughter she has the memory of in the park. She gets off the train and heads back up the escalator to Westworld…Bernard told her earlier that she really didn’t have freedom; someone futzed with her programming and her destiny has been pre-planned all along. Last shot, Dolores is shooting everyone at Dr. Ford’s human retirement party. \nMORE….",

      "text": "Subscribe on YouTube\nIt’s common knowledge that Santa has his sleigh, but did you also know that former Seattle Seahawks star Marshawn Lynch has a Treasure Truck? Well, it belongs to Jeff Bezos if you want to be specific. The retired NFL star shifted into his trademark “Beast Mode” on Saturday (and we do mean trademark), driving Amazon’s Treasure Truck to his old Seahawks stomping grounds, Seattle’s CenturyLink Field. The truck, which launched earlier this year, motors about the city with deep-discounted items that people can buy through the Amazon app.\ntt-1 More Amazon\nLynch wasn’t precisely Santa though, as that jolly elf drops off your gifts for free. The mobile Amazon retail store had many items to buy, including special Beast Mode-skinned Amazon Echos and Beast Mode hats for $140, or $40 off the sticker price. Lynch, wearing an Amazon “blaze orange” parka, was happily meeting with the many Seahawks fan, passing out his favorite candy (Skittles) to the kids. He played for the team for 6 seasons , leading them to the 2014 Super Bowl title.\nMore: A candid Marshawn Lynch talks frunks, Chick-fil-A and Tesla’s front seat\nGeekWire mentions that the Saturday promotion came just after the Seattle-based juggernaut released a new Amazon Skill for Echo owners. Called “ Marshawn Lynch’s BeastMode ,” you can say things to it as if you were speaking to Lynch. If you say to it “Alexa, will the Seahawks win?,” Alexa will respond with Lynch’s voice.\nLynch has a Beast Mode store just around the corner from CenturyLink Field, and this Treasure Truck stint is his second partnership with Amazon this year. He opened up a new online site in April to sell his own line of Beast Mode clothing as part of the Amazon “Exclusives” line . Despite his success, the former running back seems to march to his own drummer — he still drives a 1986 Civic .\nThis is not Amazon’s first attempt to move past the digital realm and into the physical world. Amazon’s Bookstore, Fresh, Flex, and other innovations have all used The Emerald City as a beta test market.\nDon’t throw away your old Macs, use them to create biological art instead Add these apps to your shopping list and never go to the grocery store again Netflix was down, but not out!",

      "text": "Who is Althouse? * View only LAW posts * Contribute * Use my Amazon Portal December 4, 2016 Reince Priebus calls Trump \"a Socratic method guy\" — \"It kind of reminds me of being back in law school.\" \"He asks a lot of questions, asks questions about questions. And he will keep going until he’s satisfied with the information that he’s getting.\" That was on \"Face the Nation\" today , in answer to probing by John Dickerson about whether Trump is getting intelligence briefings. Priebus says he is — \"it feels like every day.\" And then: I’m not sure if it is every day. But it’s a lot. And that’s who he is. It’s someone who studies and someone that wants to be informed and it’s someone who asks a lot of questions and listens. Dickerson asks if Trump is \"a details guy,\" and Priebus says \"He is a details guy,\" and then \"I would say it’s he’s a Socratic method guy\" and the rest of the quote I've set out above. Dickerson asks Priebus what he does when Trump tweets something that's not true, such as when he said there were millions of illegal votes in California. Priebus's lame response was that we don't know it's not true. Dickerson patiently, politely nailed him: I guess [the] question is, when you’re president, can you just offer a theory that has no evidence behind it, or does he have to tighten up his standard of proof? We all know the answer to that question, but I appreciate that Dickerson had the presence of mind to put it in the form of a question... especially nice, since Priebus had just expressed admiration for the Socratic method. What can Priebus say (except You got me, Socrates )? He makes a lateral leap: I think he’s done a great job. I think the president-elect is someone who has pushed the envelope and caused people to think in this country, has not taken conventional thought on every single issue. And it’s caused people to look at things that maybe they have taken for granted. Priebus distracts us onto the subject of Trump's ability to distract us with some new nutty thing. Hey, here's a theory! Ever think about it that way? Then Priebus brings up the flag-burning issue. That was a faux pas from Trump, wasn't it? So why shift to that? Priebus says flag-burning \" is an 80% issue\" — meaning (I presume) that 80% of Americans want to punish protesters who burn flags as a way of expressing themselves. And then you watch the news media and they say, well, it’s constitutional. Well, right, it is constitutional... He means the Supreme Court has found a constitutional right to burn the flag as symbolic expression. ... and but it doesn’t mean it’s not a subject for debate and discussion for the Supreme Court to revisit down the road. That is, a Supreme Court opinion on a constitutional matter does not stop the conversation about what the constitution means. A case can be overruled. And a Supreme Court appointment is in the offing. What issues will come to the foreground as we grill the new nominee? Why not make it flag burning? Whether the flag-burning decision is ever overruled, there's political advantage in getting us talking about how we feel about it. America! The flag! It's an 80% issue.

      "text": "Akoni Homeware’s Salt & Pepper Grinder Set has continued to steadily rise in Amazon’s category list since its launch on Black Friday 2016.\nBeaverton, United States – December 5, 2016 /PressCable/ —\nSince a successful product launch last week, Akoni Homeware’s Salt & Pepper Grinder Set has continued to see sales increase as category rank has also steadily increased.\nAkoni Homeware chose to launch their debut product onto Amazon.com on one of the busiest shopping days of the year, Black Friday, and have managed to consistently get sales since. The period after Black Friday is well known to be a sales slump as products return to their usual prices and buyers are no longer in the buying mood.\n“Launching on Black Friday was a huge decision for us. We discussed it many times and laid out all of the pros and cons.” said Lisa from Akoni Homeware, “Choosing to launch on one of the busiest shopping days of the year may sound like a walk in the park but it’s actually more challenging than it seems!”\nThe salt and pepper grinder set contains 2 stainless steel and clear glass grinders, 1 collapsible silicone funnel and 1 strong cleaning brush. The entire set has been designed to be both stylish and practical, in order to help the heroes of the home. Each grinder has a fully adjustable mechanism on the top, allowing the coarseness of the granules to be decided by the user.\n“Our target audience are the heroes of the home because our brand name is ‘akoni’, which means ‘hero’ in Yoruba.” continued Lisa, “Ordinary working moms and dads don’t get enough credit for the hard work that they do to keep their homes clean and tidy. All of our products are designed to be useful and convenient for the heroes of the home, making their job much easier overall.”\nAkoni Homeware’s brand new Salt & Pepper Grinder Set is now available from Amazon.com. The tall grinders have a 180ml capacity and offer a fully adjustable grinding mechanism on the top of the product: https://www.amazon.com/Akoni-Homeware-Salt-Pepper-…\nContact Info:\nName: Lisa Miller\nOrganization: Akoni Homeware\nAddress: 9450 SW Gemini Dr #29796, Beaverton United States\nRelease ID: 151108\n ",

      "text": "Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends \nIt’s common knowledge that Santa has his sleigh, but did you also know that former Seattle Seahawks star Marshawn Lynch has a Treasure Truck? Well, it belongs to Jeff Bezos if you want to be specific. The retired NFL star shifted into his trademark “Beast Mode” on Saturday (and we do mean trademark), driving Amazon’s Treasure Truck to his old Seahawks stomping grounds, Seattle’s CenturyLink Field. The truck, which launched earlier this year, motors about the city with deep-discounted items that people can buy through the Amazon app. Amazon \nLynch wasn’t precisely Santa though, as that jolly elf drops off your gifts for free. The mobile Amazon retail store had many items to buy, including special Beast Mode-skinned Amazon Echos and Beast Mode hats for $140, or $40 off the sticker price. Lynch, wearing an Amazon “blaze orange” parka, was happily meeting with the many Seahawks fan, passing out his favorite candy (Skittles) to the kids. He played for the team for 6 seasons , leading them to the 2014 Super Bowl title. \nMore: A candid Marshawn Lynch talks frunks, Chick-fil-A and Tesla’s front seat \nGeekWire mentions that the Saturday promotion came just after the Seattle-based juggernaut released a new Amazon Skill for Echo owners. Called “ Marshawn Lynch’s BeastMode ,” you can say things to it as if you were speaking to Lynch. If you say to it “Alexa, will the Seahawks win?,” Alexa will respond with Lynch’s voice. \nLynch has a Beast Mode store just around the corner from CenturyLink Field, and this Treasure Truck stint is his second partnership with Amazon this year. He opened up a new online site in April to sell his own line of Beast Mode clothing as part of the Amazon “Exclusives” line . Despite his success, the former running back seems to march to his own drummer — he still drives a 1986 Civic . \nThis is not Amazon’s first attempt to move past the digital realm and into the physical world. Amazon’s Bookstore, Fresh, Flex, and other innovations have all used The Emerald City as a beta test market.",

      "text": "Don't Miss: Amazon 12 Days of Deals \nUS-based news website the Intercept said it contacted nine of the most prominent firms to ask if they would sell their services to help create a national Muslim registry -- an idea recently refloated by President-elect Donald Trump's transition team -- and only Twitter said no. \n\"We contacted nine different firms in the business of technology, broadly defined, with the following question: 'Would [name of company], if solicited by the Trump administration, sell any goods, services, information, or consulting of any kind to help facilitate the creation of a national Muslim registry, a project which has been floated tentatively by the President-elect's transition team?',\" the report said. \nAfter two weeks of calls and e-mails, only three companies provided an answer and only one said it would not participate in such a project. \nGoogle, Facebook, Apple, IBM, IT giant SRA International and Canada-based Information technology consulting company CGI did not provide any answer to the query. Management consulting company Booz Allen Hamilton declined to comment. \nTwitter said \"No\", and a link, which states as company policy a prohibition against the use, was shared on the website. \nThe link read: \"To be clear: We prohibit developers using the Public APIs and Gnip data products from allowing law enforcement -- or any other entity -- to use Twitter data for surveillance purposes. Period.\" \nMicrosoft returned with an answer saying, \"We're not going to talk about hypotheticals at this point.\" \nA link to a company blog post states that \"we're committed to promoting not just diversity among all the men and women who work here, but...inclusive culture\" and that \"it will remain important for those in government and the tech sector to continue to work together to strike a balance that protects privacy and public safety in what remains a dangerous time\". \nThe Intercept cleared that the story was not written to say that the companies which did not reply to the request for a comment or declined to comment, were tacitly endorsing the Trump agenda in general or a Muslim registry in particular. \n\"Still, it is asking very little of today's tech companies to prompt them to go on record as unwilling to help create a federal list of Muslims -- or so one would very much hope,\" the report noted.",

See the hottest Devon Windsor photos from the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show 2016 at the Grand Palais in Paris. \nThe Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show 2016 started with a bang in Paris. There were supermodels galore and the Angels looked devilishly hot. It was a time of colors, forms and superbly-designed lingeries. Among one of the attractions of the show was Devon Windsor. \nSee the Best Photos of the Victoria's Secret Show 2016 \nThe 22 years old model Devon Windsor turned all heads in the house as she walked out on the ramp on the Victoria’s Secret fashion show 2016. Her back piece was one of a kind in the entire show and it will be one of the highlights of this year’s show. \nWith such a colorful collection showcased this season, Devon’s back piece was truly a magnificent example of the creativity of the Victoria’s Secret designer. A photo posted by devon windsor (@devwindsor) on Dec 1, 2016 at 6:33am PST \nDevon wore a bright red bra and panties which was then covered by red stones body piece that went all the way from her neck to her feet and incorporated in her nude heel. It was one of the most unique pieces in the collection on its own. \nMore however was added with the radial back piece. A full disk of colors going around in full circumference filled with radiant colors in metallic shades and golden feathers. \nDevon recognized just how special the whole outfit was and she posted a picture of it with a caption that said, \"Wow! Another#VSFashionShow down for the books! I'm so grateful to the hundreds of people who make this show happen. All the angels who train so hard to be able to carry these 30lbs wings. All the lighting, camera, mechanical, security and backstage people who you don't see behind the scenes, but who make this all possible.
