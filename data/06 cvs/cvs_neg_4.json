The sale of cigarettes generated more than $2 billion in annual sales for CVS.\"I think that we recognize that just taking tobacco out of stores is something that's important but something that could be built on,” said Dr. Troy Brennan, CVS's chief medical officer.CVS, which is working with the American Cancer Society on the campaign, will distribute grants to 125 colleges and universities.

      "text": "4 Brands That Zigged When Others Zagged Share this content: Print How REI, Southwest Airlines, CVS, and Facebook are shaking up their industries—and the consequences that they're facing as a result. \nGoing against the grain isn't easy—especially in a world where brands are constantly trying to one-up each other. Here are four examples of companies that completely zigged when others zagged and the consequences that followed. \nREI \nFor many brands, Black Friday (or what now seems like Black November) is a yearly sales pinnacle. So, when REI announced that it was closing its doors on Black Friday last year, the outdoor retailer made headlines. \n“I think it's important for brands to always be true to who they are,\" Jerry Stritzke, president and CEO of REI, told CBS This Morning at the time. “And for us, encouraging people to get outside, particularly on a holiday like Thanksgiving, we do believe that is an important message.” \nREI dubbed the initiative #OptOutside, and it paid its employees to not work on the shopping holiday. The company created a campaign website that featured recommended hiking trails and encouraged people to share their outdoor adventures on social media. And while the brand had a “black takeover screen” on its website urging people to head outdoors, an REI spokesperson told GeekWire that customers could still view products and make online purchases; however, the orders wouldn't be processed until the next day. \nAccording to a 2015 REI press release, more than 150 companies, nonprofits, and agencies joined the retailer in supporting people to spend Black Friday outdoors, prompting “nearly one million endorsements for OptOutside.” GeekWire also cited data from web and app analytics company SimilarWeb claiming that REI.com experienced a 10% lift in traffic on Thanksgiving and a 26% increase on Black Friday. \nThe campaign was such a success that REI is inviting people to #OptOutside again this year. According to a recent REI press release, more than 1.8 million people have stated their intent to spend Black Friday outdoors this year, and 475 companies, nonprofits, and public sectors have pledged to help people spend more time outdoors this season. In fact, many state parks are waiving fees on Black Friday. \nAs Stritzke suggested on CBS This Morning a year ago, REI's move emphasizes the importance of brand authenticity. In today's crowded environment (which is even more jam-packed on Black Friday), it's the brands that stay true to their values and practice what they preach that resonate with consumers. \nSouthwest Airlines \nChecked bag fees, in-flight meal and entertainment costs, flight change penalties: This list of add-on airline expenses can become so costly that it actually dampens travelers' experiences. To stay true to its identity as a “low-fare” carrier, Southwest Airlines abandons many of these time-honored traditions by offering customers two free checked bags; free, in-flight, live TV; and no flight-change fees (although, customers have to pay the difference in flight costs). The airline cheekily refers to this customer service approach as “Transfarency.” \n\"Transfarency is a unique approach to treating customers the way they expect and deserve to be treated,” Kevin Krone, Southwest's VP of marketing and CMO, stated in a press release announcing the brand's 2015 Transfarency campaign launch. “Being a low-fare airline is at the heart of our brand and the foundation of our business model, so we're not going to nickel and dime our customers.” \nSouthwest highlights its Transfarency assets (while jabbing its competitors) through content marketing efforts, like a “Fee or Fake” online quiz and #FeesDontFly Mad Libs. \nCustomer service is certainly a cornerstone in Southwest's business model, and it shows. Southwest ranks second in the low-cost carrier category in the “J.D. Power 2016 North America Airline Satisfaction Study” with a score of 789 out of 1,000 points, falling one point behind top carrier JetBlue. But is this superb service actually impacting Southwest's bottom line? Recent earnings might suggest otherwise. According to a recent earnings release, Southwest's net income for Q3 2016 was $388 million—a significant drop from $584 million in Q3 2015. \nThe bottom line: Delivering an exquisite customer experience is always important, but brands need to evaluate if they actually have the means to deliver on their promises. \nCVS \nHow many brands would turn down $2 billion in annual revenue? That's exactly what CVS Caremark Corp did when the pharmacy chain stopped selling tobacco products in 2014, according to The Wall Street Journal . \n\"While there's never a right time to walk away from $2 billion in revenue, this was the right time,\" CVS President and CEO Larry Merlo told the news outlet. \"Eliminating this obstacle will allow our company to grow over the long term.\" \nIn a 2015 press release announcing the decision, Merlo said that selling tobacco products was “inconsistent” with CVS's purpose of promoting health and aligning itself as a health care company—a purpose that eventually manifested into the brand adopting the name CVS Health. \nCVS's bottom line took a hit: Its front-store-same-store sales fell 4% by the end of 2014 and by 5% in 2015. However, its overall net revenues continued to grow as did its same-store pharmacy sales and prescription volume. In fact, the company's 2015 annual report revealed that CVS Pharmacy filled 21.6% of all retail prescriptions that year, causing the company to take the lead in the U.S. retail drugstore market. \nBut CVS's new company positioning may soon hit another roadblock. As Forbes recently reported, CVS's Q3 2016 earnings report projected a loss of more than 40 million retail prescriptions in 2017 due to new restricted pharmacy networks that exclude CVS Pharmacy drugstores. \nIndeed, pivoting a company based on values and evolving markets (like healthcare) is a brave move, but that's the thing with markets—they'll always evolve again. \nFacebook \nFacebook has grown up quite a bit since Mark Zuckerberg first founded the social network. It's acquired behemoths like Instagram, Whatsapp, and Oculus VR (although, its reported bid for Snapchat was unsuccessful). And while these technologies all sit underneath the Facebook umbrella, Zuckerberg and his teammates have chosen to keep their experiences fairly separate. \nThe reasoning behind this independent structure, according to a Business Insider article , is simplicity. “Apps that do one thing, and do it really well, are the social network's hedge against bloat and user burnout,” it reads. \nThe article also points out that somebody who doesn't like WhatsApp may still enjoy Instagram—giving Facebook more opportunities to acquire data and marketshare. \nSo while trying to be an all-encompassing entity has been the near downfall for some, Business Insider writes, Facebook is letting its acquired apps focus on what they do best—for now.

      "text": "Order Reprint of this Story \nKansas City’s rise in the logistics and distribution business continues with a planned $110 million distribution center for CVS Pharmacy receiving an early approval by the Kansas City Plan Commission. \nThe commission voted unanimously Tuesday to approve plans for a 752,000-square-foot distribution facility in the Northland’s Skyport Industrial Park. The building can expand to more than 1 million square feet. \nAn affiliate of NorthPoint Development owns the property at the southwest corner of Northwest 108th Street and North Congress Avenue and is expected to sell it to CVS, which will then develop the building. \nAnywhere from 362 to 400 employees will work at the facility on three shifts. \nPort KC approved incentives for the building. CVS will receive a 22-year property tax exemption on the land and the building and a 10-year exemption on equipment for the distribution facility. \nThe first 12 years will allow a 90 percent exemption on property taxes, with a 50 percent exemption for the following 10 years. \nSeveral municipalities in the region were vying for the CVS distribution facility, but Kansas City appeared to have won the project on the strength of the Port KC incentives.

      "text": "Friday, November 18, 2016 01:33PM NILES, Ill. (WLS) -- A man and a woman robbed a CVS store in north suburban Niles on Monday and threatened an employee with a hypodermic needle, police said.The pair entered the store in the 9600-block of Milwaukee Avenue around 7:30 a.m. Police said they took over-the-counter medication from a shelf and hid them in bags they brought with them.When they tried to leave the store, an employee approached and told them to put the merchandise down. Police said that's when the man pulled out a hypodermic needle, pointed it at the worker and said, \"You don't want what I have.\"The pair left the store and got into a light-colored vehicle. Police said they got away with about $600 in over-the-counter meds.The man was about 5 ft. 5 in. - 5 ft. 9 in. tall, weighed around 155-175 pounds and had dark hair. He was wearing sunglasses, a dark jacket and dark pants.The woman was about 5 ft. 5 in. - 5 ft. 9 in. tall, weighed around 135-145 pounds and had light hair. She was wearing a baseball cap, a two-tone jacket and tan pants.An investigation is underway. No one is in custody. A similar robbery occurred in southwest suburban Naperville earlier this week, where a robber claimed to have a needle infected with HIV. Related Topics:",

      "text": "For the second time this week, a suburban police department has reported that a man and woman wielded hypodermic needles in a threatening manner while stealing over-the-counter medications from a drugstore.\nThe incident happened Monday morning at a CVS store at 9640 Milwaukee Ave., Niles police said Friday.\nA similar incident took place at a CVS store in Naperville on Tuesday morning, police in that town reported earlier this week.\nNiles police Sgt. Robert Tornabene said the incidents are possibly related, and that they are working with Naperville police to compare the two incidents.\n\"Witnesses have not positively identified them, but the circumstances are extremely similar,\" Tornabene said.\nNaperville Police Cmdr. Jason Arres said the crimes could possibly be related.\n\"Based on the photos/videos, it appears they may be (related,) but nothing is certain at this time,\" Arres said late Friday.\nIn the Niles incident, a man and woman were seen removing over-the-counter medications from store shelves and concealing them inside bags they had brought with them, police said.\nWhen they attempted to leave, a store employee approached them and instructed them to put the items down. According to police, the man then reportedly pulled out a hypodermic needle from his pants pocket, pointed it at the employee and said, \"You don't want what I have.\"\nThe couple left the store and entered a light-colored vehicle. Police said about $600 worth of medications were taken.\nTornabene said if the two are caught they will be charged with felony retail theft and felony aggravated assault. An earlier version of this story described the incident in Niles as a robbery. Tornabene said police are not classifying the crime as a robbery.\n2 wield needle allegedly contaminated with HIV to rob Naperville pharmacy: cops Bill Bird Naperville police are seeking help from the public in finding the man and woman who they said robbed a local pharmacy brandishing a syringe the couple claimed was contaminated with HIV , the virus that causes AIDS.\nThe crime, which police have classified as an armed robbery, occurred at 5:57 a.m....\nNaperville police are seeking help from the public in finding the man and woman who they said robbed a local pharmacy brandishing a syringe the couple claimed was contaminated with HIV , the virus that causes AIDS.\nThe crime, which police have classified as an armed robbery, occurred at 5:57 a.m....\n(Bill Bird) Tornabene said Niles police were working with numerous other law enforcement agencies in the area to identify similar crimes, and that he had contacted CVS with regard to preventing another incident from occurring at another location.\nMike DeAngelis, senior director of corporate communications for CVS Health in Woonsocket, R.I., said Friday company officials \"have made our stores in the (Chicago) market aware of these incidents, and we are cooperating with local police departments in their investigations.\"\n\"We do not comment on our specific security measures, because we do not want to undermine them,\" DeAngelis wrote in an email. \"However, the safety of our employees and customers remains our highest priority.\"\nThe man in the Niles incident was described as 5-foot-5 to 5-foot-9 and 155 to 175 pounds with dark hair. He was wearing sunglasses, a dark jacket and dark pants. The woman was described as 5-foot-5 to 5-foot-9 and 135 to 145 pounds with light-colored hair. She was wearing a baseball-style cap, a two-tone jacket and tan pants.\nAnyone with information is asked to call Niles police at 847-588-6500.\nIn the Naperville incident, a man and woman robbed a CVS store brandishing a syringe they claimed was contaminated with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.\nThe crime, which police have classified as an armed robbery, occurred at 5:57 a.m. Tuesday at the CVS Health store at 1299 E. Ogden Ave. in Naperville. The store is near the Ogden Mall on the city's northeast side.\nArres, of the Naperville police, said two male store employees called police immediately following the holdup. The men told police they confronted the man and woman, who \"threatened (the workers) … with a hypodermic needle alleged to be infected with HIV,\" Arres wrote in a news release.\nThe robbers \"reportedly stole numerous medications from the business\" before leaving, Arres said. It was not known whether they fled on foot or in a vehicle.\nArres said the man was described as being about 50 years old, with dark hair and clad in dark clothing.\nThe woman was described as about 40 years old with dark hair and wore dark clothing.\nArres asked that witnesses to the robbery or those with information about the case to call Naperville police at 630-420-6666, and ask for the investigations division.\nGenevieve Bookwalter is a reporter for Pioneer Press.

But in keeping with his typical \"out of this world deals\" thread here goes.\n\nSo far I'm fairly excited about T on Tuesday with an additional 25% off of beauty and personal care. Should be able to make some decent deals on that. Also a good time to snag items that rarely go on sale or that don't frequently have any Qs. Also if you have any Target mailers or the Q off the Target toy book please remember that some of those expire on Wed. 11/23. BF ads are up so decide when the best time to strike might be for you.\n",

      "text": "For the second time this week, a suburban police department has reported that a man and woman wielded hypodermic needles in a threatening manner while stealing over-the-counter medications from a drugstore.\nThe incident happened Monday morning at a CVS store at 9640 Milwaukee Ave., Niles police said Friday.\nA similar incident took place at a CVS store in Naperville on Tuesday morning, police in that town reported earlier this week.\nNiles police Sgt. Robert Tornabene said the incidents are possibly related, and that they are working with Naperville police to compare the two incidents.\n\"Witnesses have not positively identified them, but the circumstances are extremely similar,\" Tornabene said.\nNaperville Police Cmdr. Jason Arres said the crimes could possibly be related.\n\"Based on the photos/videos, it appears they may be (related,) but nothing is certain at this time,\" Arres said late Friday.\nIn the Niles incident, a man and woman were seen removing over-the-counter medications from store shelves and concealing them inside bags they had brought with them, police said.\nWhen they attempted to leave, a store employee approached them and instructed them to put the items down. According to police, the man then reportedly pulled out a hypodermic needle from his pants pocket, pointed it at the employee and said, \"You don't want what I have.\"\nThe couple left the store and entered a light-colored vehicle. Police said about $600 worth of medications were taken.\nTornabene said if the two are caught they will be charged with felony retail theft and felony aggravated assault. An earlier version of this story described the incident in Niles as a robbery. Tornabene said police are not classifying the crime as a robbery.\n2 wield needle allegedly contaminated with HIV to rob Naperville pharmacy: cops Bill Bird Naperville police are seeking help from the public in finding the man and woman who they said robbed a local pharmacy brandishing a syringe the couple claimed was contaminated with HIV , the virus that causes AIDS.\nThe crime, which police have classified as an armed robbery, occurred at 5:57 a.m....\nNaperville police are seeking help from the public in finding the man and woman who they said robbed a local pharmacy brandishing a syringe the couple claimed was contaminated with HIV , the virus that causes AIDS.\nThe crime, which police have classified as an armed robbery, occurred at 5:57 a.m....\n(Bill Bird) Tornabene said Niles police were working with numerous other law enforcement agencies in the area to identify similar crimes, and that he had contacted CVS with regard to preventing another incident from occurring at another location.\nMike DeAngelis, senior director of corporate communications for CVS Health in Woonsocket, R.I., said Friday company officials \"have made our stores in the (Chicago) market aware of these incidents, and we are cooperating with local police departments in their investigations.\"\n\"We do not comment on our specific security measures, because we do not want to undermine them,\" DeAngelis wrote in an email. \"However, the safety of our employees and customers remains our highest priority.\"\nThe man in the Niles incident was described as 5-foot-5 to 5-foot-9 and 155 to 175 pounds with dark hair. He was wearing sunglasses, a dark jacket and dark pants. The woman was described as 5-foot-5 to 5-foot-9 and 135 to 145 pounds with light-colored hair. She was wearing a baseball-style cap, a two-tone jacket and tan pants.\nAnyone with information is asked to call Niles police at 847-588-6500.\nIn the Naperville incident, a man and woman robbed a CVS store brandishing a syringe they claimed was contaminated with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.\nThe crime, which police have classified as an armed robbery, occurred at 5:57 a.m. Tuesday at the CVS Health store at 1299 E. Ogden Ave. in Naperville. The store is near the Ogden Mall on the city's northeast side.\nArres, of the Naperville police, said two male store employees called police immediately following the holdup. The men told police they confronted the man and woman, who \"threatened (the workers) … with a hypodermic needle alleged to be infected with HIV,\" Arres wrote in a news release.\nThe robbers \"reportedly stole numerous medications from the business\" before leaving, Arres said. It was not known whether they fled on foot or in a vehicle.\nArres said the man was described as being about 50 years old, with dark hair and clad in dark clothing.\nThe woman was described as about 40 years old with dark hair and wore dark clothing.\nArres asked that witnesses to the robbery or those with information about the case to call Naperville police at 630-420-6666, and ask for the investigations division.\nGenevieve Bookwalter is a reporter for Pioneer Press.

      "text": "Editorial: From CVS, a wake-up call Sunday Nov 20, 2016 at 3:00 PM \nTwo years ago, when Gina Raimondo was running for governor, the focus was jobs-jobs-jobs. Ms. Raimondo's campaign stressed economic recovery and job creation, and though she declined to offer specifics, she said that if she were elected, Rhode Island would see “tens of thousands of new jobs in the next 10 years.” \nNearly two years later, the state’s unemployment rate is down to 5.5 percent, but Rhode Island still has not recovered all the jobs it lost in the recession. And this month, we learned that one of its largest employers — CVS Health — is laying off 600 people, including 250 in Rhode Island. \nIt’s understood that encouraging private-sector job creation and turning around a long-moribund state economy takes time. The leaders of large businesses make their decisions not to please states or state leaders but to maximize their profit. They must focus on the needs of customers, employees and shareholders. \nStill, it is always troubling when a large employer announces layoffs, and all the more so in a small state like Rhode Island. Every job counts, and losing middle class jobs — even when the losses are based on industry changes and not on anything the state is or isn’t doing — is cause for concern. The loss of such jobs is yet another reminder that Rhode Island must turn around its economy. To do so, state leaders must be moving forward and addressing the factors that hinder economic growth. \nMs. Raimondo and state lawmakers have taken some of the right steps — revamping job training programs to meet employers’ needs; creating a program to teach computer science in public schools; eliminating the sales tax businesses paid on electricity, natural gas and heating fuels; offering incentives to companies that want to create jobs. The incentives have led companies such as Finlay Extracts and Ingredients USA, a subsidiary of London-based Finlays, to choose Rhode Island. Finlay plans to build a $54.3 million research, development, manufacturing and distribution facility in Quonset Business Park. \nBut companies make decisions every day, and other states are doing all they can to compete. The fact is, Rhode Island’s economy is still sputtering, and its leaders must look at what can be done to make the state an attractive place to do business, with or without incentives that can be used to sweeten the pot. Rhode Island’s leaders need to scale back regulation and red tape, reduce tax burdens and improve the reputation of a state that routinely places near the bottom in rankings for business friendliness. It also must get serious about improving public education. Thus far, the governor's efforts in that area have been weak and timid. \nIn CVS’s case, the state stands to lose up to 250 corporate jobs. At the same time, the company has some 350 openings in Rhode Island — a mix of retail, pharmacy-related, walk-in clinic and corporate positions. It’s good that the company has these openings, but that doesn’t change the fact that many middle class jobs will be lost and people will be displaced. And a company the size of CVS, with its corporate headquarters in the state, would probably have many local openings at any given time. \nIn a fast-changing world where companies are constantly adjusting to market forces, Rhode Island needs a vibrant economy that offers those displaced people, and others, more options. Though progress has been made, Rhode Island needs an economy that offers far more in the way of opportunity. About Us",

      "text": "CHICAGO (CBS) — A Chicago man has been charged with robbing a CVS store while armed with a hypodermic needle last week in north suburban Niles.\nSanjay Malhotra, 49, faces one felony count of armed robbery, according to Niles police.\nAround 7:30 p.m. Nov. 14, a CVS employee spotted a man and woman removing over-the-counter medication from a shelf in the store at 9640 Milwaukee Avenue, police said.\nWhen the suspects attempted to leave, the employee approached and told them to put the items down, police said. The man allegedly pulled out a hypodermic needle from his pants pocket, pointed it at the employee, and said, “You don’t want what I have.”\nThe two suspects then left the CVS and got into a light-colored vehicle, police said.\nMalhotra was arrested about 10:05 p.m. Friday for the armed robbery of a Jewel store in the 2900 block of North Ashland in Chicago, police said. He matched the description of the suspect in the Niles robbery.\n(Source: Sun-Times Media Wire © Chicago Sun-Times 2016. All Rights Reserved.

      "title": "No Evidence of Aloe Vera Found in the Aloe Vera at Wal-Mart, CVS - Bloomberg",
      "text": "Share on Facebook \nThe aloe vera gel many Americans buy to soothe damaged skin contains no evidence of aloe vera at all. \nSamples of store-brand aloe gel purchased at national retailers Wal-Mart, Target and CVS showed no indication of the plant in various lab tests. The products all listed aloe barbadensis leaf juice — another name for aloe vera — as either the No. 1 ingredient or No. 2 after water. \nThere’s no watchdog assuring that aloe products are what they say they are. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration doesn’t approve cosmetics before they’re sold and has never levied a fine for selling fake aloe. That means suppliers are on an honor system, even as the total U.S. market for aloe products, including drinks and vitamins, has grown 11 percent in the past year to $146 million, according to Chicago-based market researcher SPINS LLC. \n“You have to be very careful when you select and use aloe products,” said Tod Cooperman, president of White Plains, New York-based ConsumerLab.com, which has done aloe testing. \nAloe’s three chemical markers — acemannan, malic acid and glucose — were absent in the tests for Wal-Mart, Target and CVS products conducted by a lab hired by Bloomberg News. The three samples contained a cheaper element called maltodextrin, a sugar sometimes used to imitate aloe. The gel that’s sold at another retailer, Walgreens, contained one marker, malic acid, but not the other two. That means the presence of aloe can’t be confirmed or ruled out, said Ken Jones, an independent industry consultant based in Chapala, Mexico. 23,000 Stores \nTarget Corp. declined to comment. Spokesmen for Wal-Mart Stores Inc., CVS Health Corp. and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. said their suppliers confirmed to them that their products were authentic. The four retailers have 23,000 outlets between them. Walmart Equate brand Aloe After Sun Gel Photographer: Daniel Acker/Bloomberg \nThe four gels that Bloomberg had analyzed were Wal-Mart’s Equate Aloe After Sun Gel with pure aloe vera; Target’s Up & Up Aloe Vera Gel with pure aloe vera; CVS Aftersun Aloe Vera Moisturizing Gel; and Walgreens Alcohol Free Aloe Vera Body Gel. The lab that did the testing requested anonymity to preserve its business relationships. \nThe tests used a technique called nuclear magnetic resonance. It found additives such as maltodextrin and other ingredients, like triethanolamine, an emulsifier. In all the samples, lactic acid, a component that indicates degraded aloe vera, was absent. \nFruit of the Earth, a Fort Worth, Texas-based aloe brand founded in 1980, said it made the gels for Wal-Mart, Target and Walgreens. Fruit of the Earth said its aloe supplier was Ormond Beach, Florida-based Concentrated Aloe Corp., which said it uses fair trade, organic aloe that’s farmed and processed in Guatemala. \nBoth companies disputed Bloomberg’s findings. Raw Ingredients \n“We’ve been in the business a long time and we know where the raw ingredients come from,’’ John Dondrea, Fruit of the Earth’s general counsel, said in a telephone interview. “We stand behind our products.’’ CVS brand Aftersun Aloe Vera Moisturizing Gel Source: CVS \nTim Meadows, president of Concentrated Aloe Corp., said that nuclear magnetic resonance isn’t reliable for cosmetics because the presence of multiple ingredients can cause interference and there’s no way to test for aloe in finished products. He added that maltodextrin isn’t an adulterant because it can be used in the drying process, and while some ways of processing aloe remove acemannan, that doesn’t mean the aloe isn’t real, he said. \n“Acemannan has been misinterpreted,’’ Meadows said. “The cosmetics industry requires highly processed aloe. How that affects acemannan is anybody’s guess.’’ \nThough it’s true that nuclear magnetic resonance isn’t a test that’s designed to study aloe vera in cosmetics, the lab results suggest that the plant “is not a major component” of the products, said James Neal-Kababick, director of Flora Research Labs in Grants Pass, Oregon, which tests and researches natural products. Jones, the consultant who also reviewed some of the tests, said he didn’t see evidence of aloe or interfering substances. \nThe CVS aloe gel was made by Product Quest Manufacturing LLC. The Daytona Beach, Florida-based firm declined to comment or identify its supplier. Lawsuits Filed \nSeveral law firms, including Bloomfield Hills, Michigan-based Barbat, Mansour & Suciu PLLC, have filed lawsuits against the four retailers after separate testing failed to find aloe in the companies’ private-label products. They’re seeking class-action status and restitution for all the customers who they say were misled. \n“No reasonable person would have purchased or used the products if they knew the products did not contain any aloe vera,’’ attorneys wrote in a complaint filed in September in Illinois on behalf of plaintiffs represented by 10 law firms. \nFruit of the Earth, Wal-Mart, Target, CVS and Walgreens denied the allegations. \nIndependently, ConsumerLab.com said it had Fruit of the Earth brand Aloe Vera 100% Gel tested using nuclear magnetic resonance and found no evidence of aloe, while a competing brand, Aubrey Organics, did contain the markers that indicate aloe. ConsumerLab said it tested a dozen aloe products, including pills and juices, and just half the items appeared to meet the claims on their labels. Beneficial Properties \nAcemannan is thought to give the plant its beneficial properties, said Jane Wilson, executive director of the International Aloe Science Council in Silver Spring, Maryland, which represents the industry. Walgreens Well brand alcohol free Aloe Vera Body Gel Photographer: Daniel Acker/Bloomberg \nJesper Hummeluhr, founder of Copenhagen-based cosmetics maker Aloe Vera Group APS, said that if acemannan isn’t detected, the aloe was degraded during the manufacturing process or the product contains no aloe. He’s been making aloe products since 1989. \n“What you have there is not aloe,’’ said Hummeluhr, who reviewed some of the results without being told the name of the brands. “It could be a lot of water and a little bit of aloe added.’’ Reliability Questioned \nAcemannan is as much as 15 percent of aloe’s makeup. Levels below 0.01 percent of dry weight won’t register in the tests. Fruit of the Earth’s Dondrea declined to say how much aloe is in the firm’s gels, citing proprietary formulations. \nAloe vera is a succulent farmed in hot climates like Texas and Mexico. Its spiky leaves contain a clear goo that people have used as a topical ointment to treat burns and other skin problems for millennia. Known as the “plant of immortality” in ancient Egypt, it was depicted on stone carvings 6,000 years ago, a burial gift for pharaohs, and it’s been used as a folk remedy for conditions from diabetes to epilepsy, according to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health. Imitation Aloe \nConcerns over imitation aloe aren’t new. The industry created the International Aloe Science Council in the 1980s as more and more products hit store shelves that contained little or no aloe, said Wilson, the group’s executive director. Maltodextrin, a light-colored powder that looks like aloe powder and is used as a food additive, was a common filler or substitute. Maltodextrin is cheaper than aloe, Wilson said. Target brand Aloe Vera Gel Photographer: Daniel Acker/Bloomberg \nJeff Barrie, a Keene, New Hampshire-based sales manager at AloeCorp, one of the biggest suppliers of raw aloe powder, said he’s seen competitors beat his lowest prices by half. That means they’re not selling aloe, he said. Aloe powder can cost as much as $240 a kilogram, he said, while the same amount of maltodextrin can cost a few dollars. \nMaking just 1 kilogram of aloe powder, the ingredient used in finished goods like gels and drinks, requires 400 kilos (882 pounds) of aloe leaves, Barrie said. The process involves removing rinds from the leaves and dehydrating the remaining aloe into a powder form. \n“Aloe is all harvested by hand,” Barrie said. “It’s an involved process and it’s not cheap.” \nThere’s no conclusive body of scientific research affirming aloe’s healing properties. While some studies have shown a benefit for burns and cuts, “there’s nothing to hang your hat on” in terms of clear evidence, partly because there hasn’t been enough research, said D. Craig Hopp, a program director at the National Center for Complementary and Integrated Health in Bethesda, Maryland. Loving Aloe \n“There’s a lot of people that swear by aloe and love it, and if you put it in your product, you’ll sell more of it whether it’s a cream or a lotion for sunburns,’’ said Gary Shreeve, a vice president of global operations at Scottsdale, Arizona-based Forever Living Products, which sells aloe certified by the International Aloe Science Council. \nSome people are old school about aloe. Rather than buying aloe products, they just keep the succulent around the house. \nMeredith Zielke, a documentary filmmaker in Chicago, is one of many aloe lovers who have a simple remedy. She keeps the plant in her home to cool her skin when her Lyme disease acts up. And it works, she said. \n“I like just having it at home to snip it from there,” Zielke said. “I just like the comfort and the knowledge of having a plant in your house that can actually heal you.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

      "title": "No evidence of aloe vera found in the aloe vera at Walmart, CVS, Target",
      "text": "The aloe vera gel many Americans buy to soothe damaged skin contains no evidence of aloe vera at all. Samples of store-brand aloe gel purchased at national retailers Walmart, Target and CVS showed no indication of the plant in various lab tests. The products all listed aloe barbadensis leaf juice — another name for aloe vera — as either the No. 1 ingredient or No. 2 after water.\nThere's no watchdog assuring that aloe products are what they say they are. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration doesn't approve cosmetics before they're sold and has never levied a fine for selling fake aloe. That means suppliers are on an honour system, even as the total U.S. market for aloe products, including drinks and vitamins, has grown 11 per cent in the past year to $146 million, according to Chicago-based market researcher SPINS.\n\"You have to be very careful when you select and use aloe products,\" said Tod Cooperman, president of White Plains, New York-based ConsumerLab.com, which has done aloe testing.\nAloe's three chemical markers — acemannan, malic acid and glucose — were absent in the tests for Walmart, Target and CVS products conducted by a lab hired by Bloomberg News. The three samples contained a cheaper element called maltodextrin, a sugar sometimes used to imitate aloe. The gel that's sold at another retailer, Walgreens, contained one marker, malic acid, but not the other two. That means the presence of aloe can't be confirmed or ruled out, said Ken Jones, an independent industry consultant based in Chapala, Mexico.\nTarget declined to comment. Spokespeople for Wal-Mart Stores, CVS Health and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. said their suppliers confirmed to them that their products were authentic. The four retailers have 23,000 outlets between them.\nThe four gels that Bloomberg had analyzed were Wal-Mart's Equate Aloe After Sun Gel with pure aloe vera; Target's Up & Up Aloe Vera Gel with pure aloe vera; CVS Aftersun Aloe Vera Moisturizing Gel; and Walgreens Alcohol Free Aloe Vera Body Gel. The lab that did the testing requested anonymity to preserve its business relationships.\nThe tests used a technique called nuclear magnetic resonance. It found additives such as maltodextrin and other ingredients, like triethanolamine, an emulsifier. In all the samples, lactic acid, a component that indicates degraded aloe vera, was absent.\nFruit of the Earth, a Fort Worth, Texas-based aloe brand founded in 1980, said it made the gels for Walmart, Target and Walgreens. Fruit of the Earth said its aloe supplier was Ormond Beach, Florida-based Concentrated Aloe Corp., which said it uses fair trade, organic aloe that's farmed and processed in Guatemala.\nBoth companies disputed Bloomberg's findings.\n\"We've been in the business a long time and we know where the raw ingredients come from,\" John Dondrea, Fruit of the Earth's general counsel, said in a telephone interview. \"We stand behind our products.\"\nTim Meadows, president of Concentrated Aloe Corp., said that nuclear magnetic resonance isn't reliable for cosmetics because the presence of multiple ingredients can cause interference and there's no way to test for aloe in finished products. He added that maltodextrin isn't an adulterant because it can be used in the drying process, and while some ways of processing aloe remove acemannan, that doesn't mean the aloe isn't real, he said.\n\"Acemannan has been misinterpreted,\" Meadows said. \"The cosmetics industry requires highly processed aloe. How that affects acemannan is anybody's guess.\"\nThough it's true that nuclear magnetic resonance isn't a test that's designed to study aloe vera in cosmetics, the lab results suggest that the plant \"is not a major component\" of the products, said James Neal-Kababick, director of Flora Research Labs in Grants Pass, Oregon, which tests and researches natural products. Jones, the consultant who also reviewed some of the tests, said he didn't see evidence of aloe or interfering substances.\nThe CVS aloe gel was made by Product Quest Manufacturing. The Daytona Beach, Florida-based firm declined to comment or identify its supplier.\nSeveral law firms, including Bloomfield Hills, Michigan-based Barbat, Mansour & Suciu, have filed lawsuits against the four retailers after separate testing failed to find aloe in the companies' private-label products. They're seeking class-action status and restitution for all the customers who they say were misled.\n\"No reasonable person would have purchased or used the products if they knew the products did not contain any aloe vera,\" attorneys wrote in a complaint filed in September in Illinois on behalf of plaintiffs represented by 10 law firms.\nFruit of the Earth, Walmart, Target, CVS and Walgreens denied the allegations.\nIndependently, ConsumerLab.com said it had Fruit of the Earth brand Aloe Vera 100% Gel tested using nuclear magnetic resonance and found no evidence of aloe, while a competing brand, Aubrey Organics, did contain the markers that indicate aloe. ConsumerLab said it tested a dozen aloe products, including pills and juices, and just half the items appeared to meet the claims on their labels.\nAcemannan is thought to give the plant its beneficial properties, said Jane Wilson, executive director of the International Aloe Science Council in Silver Spring, Maryland, which represents the industry.\nJesper Hummeluhr, founder of Copenhagen-based cosmetics maker Aloe Vera Group APS, said that if acemannan isn't detected, the aloe was degraded during the manufacturing process or the product contains no aloe. He's been making aloe products since 1989.\n\"What you have there is not aloe,\" said Hummeluhr, who reviewed some of the results without being told the name of the brands. \"It could be a lot of water and a little bit of aloe added.\"\nAcemannan is as much as 15 per cent of aloe's makeup. Levels below 0.01 per cent of dry weight won't register in the tests. Fruit of the Earth's Dondrea declined to say how much aloe is in the firm's gels, citing proprietary formulations.\nAloe vera is a succulent farmed in hot climates like Texas and Mexico. Its spiky leaves contain a clear goo that people have used as a topical ointment to treat burns and other skin problems for millennia. Known as the \"plant of immortality\" in ancient Egypt, it was depicted on stone carvings 6,000 years ago, a burial gift for pharaohs, and it's been used as a folk remedy for conditions from diabetes to epilepsy, according to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health.\nConcerns over imitation aloe aren't new. The industry created the International Aloe Science Council in the 1980s as more and more products hit store shelves that contained little or no aloe, said Wilson, the group's executive director. Maltodextrin, a light-coloured powder that looks like aloe powder and is used as a food additive, was a common filler or substitute. Maltodextrin is cheaper than aloe, Wilson said.\nJeff Barrie, a Keene, New Hampshire-based sales manager at AloeCorp, one of the biggest suppliers of raw aloe powder, said he's seen competitors beat his lowest prices by half. That means they're not selling aloe, he said. Aloe powder can cost as much as $240 a kilogram, he said, while the same amount of maltodextrin can cost a few dollars.\nMaking just 1 kilogram of aloe powder, the ingredient used in finished goods like gels and drinks, requires 400 kilos (882 pounds) of aloe leaves, Barrie said. The process involves removing rinds from the leaves and dehydrating the remaining aloe into a powder form.\n\"Aloe is all harvested by hand,\" Barrie said. \"It's an involved process and it's not cheap.\"\nThere's no conclusive body of scientific research affirming aloe's healing properties. While some studies have shown a benefit for burns and cuts, \"there's nothing to hang your hat on\" in terms of clear evidence, partly because there hasn't been enough research, said D. Craig Hopp, a program director at the National Center for Complementary and Integrated Health in Bethesda, Maryland.\n\"There's a lot of people that swear by aloe and love it, and if you put it in your product, you'll sell more of it whether it's a cream or a lotion for sunburns,\" said Gary Shreeve, a vice president of global operations at Scottsdale, Arizona-based Forever Living Products, which sells aloe certified by the International Aloe Science Council.\nSome people are old school about aloe. Rather than buying aloe products, they just keep the succulent around the house.\nMeredith Zielke, a documentary filmmaker in Chicago, is one of many aloe lovers who have a simple remedy. She keeps the plant in her home to cool her skin when her Lyme disease acts up. And it works, she said.\n\"I like just having it at home to snip it from there,\" Zielke said. \"I just like the comfort and the knowledge of having a plant in your house that can actually heal you.\"",

      "text": "Aloe Vera Gel Bought At Walmart, Target, CVS Might Not Actually Contain Aloe Vera Image courtesy of titanium22 burning questions aloe vera aloe barbadensis U.S. Food and Drug Administration cosmetics \nThere’s nothing quite like slathering aloe vera all over a burning, uncomfortable sunburn. But does that aloe vera gel on the drugstore shelf actually contain any aloe vera? \nPerhaps not, according to an in-depth report from Bloomberg News that says samples aloe vera gel products purchased at Walmart, Target, and CVS showed no trace of the plant in multiple lab tests. This, despite the fact that all of the products involved listed aloe barbadensis leaf juice, aka aloe vera, as either the first or second ingredient after water. \nA lab hired by Bloomberg tested four gels: Walmart’s Equate Aloe After Sun Gel with pure aloe vera; Target’s Up & Up Aloe Vera Gel with pure aloe vera; CVS Aftersun Aloe Vera Moisturizing Gel; and Walgreens Alcohol Free Aloe Vera Body Gel. A company called Fruit of the Earth made the gel products for Walmart, Target, and Walgreens. \nThe three chemical markers for aloe were absent in the products from Walmart, CVS, and Target, and instead contained a cheaper substance called maltodextrin. A product sold at Walgreens did have one of the markers, but not the other two, so the presence of aloe can’t be confirmed or ruled out \nHow could this happen? Simple: the U.S. Food and Drug Administration doesn’t approve cosmetics before they hit the shelves, so it’s up to suppliers to make good on their promises. As such, there government has never fined a company for selling fake aloe. \n“You have to be very careful when you select and use aloe products,” Tod Cooperman, president of ConsumerLab.com, which has done aloe testing, told Bloomberg. \nTarget declined to comment to Bloomberg, while Walmart, CVS, and Walgreens Boots Alliance and their suppliers confirmed that their products were authentic aloe products. Fruit of the Earth and its supplier also disputed the report. \nConsumers have already taken note of this aloe vera controversy: several law firms have filed lawsuits against the four retailers and Fruit of the Earth after separate tests showed a lack of the ingredient in the companies’ private label brands. They’re all seeking class-action status and restitution for customers who they claim were misled. \n“No reasonable person would have purchased or used the products if they knew the products did not contain any aloe vera,” attorneys wrote in a complaint filed in September in Illinois on behalf of plaintiffs represented by 10 law firms. \nThe retailers and Fruit of the Earth have denied the allegations.

      "text": "The aloe vera gel many Americans buy to soothe damaged skin contains no evidence of aloe vera at all.\nSamples of store-brand aloe gel purchased at U.S. retailers Wal-Mart, Target and CVS showed no indication of the plant in various lab tests. The products all listed aloe barbadensis leaf juice — another name for aloe vera — as either the No. 1 ingredient or No. 2 after water.\nThere’s no watchdog assuring that aloe products are what they say they are. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration doesn’t approve cosmetics before they’re sold and has never levied a fine for selling fake aloe. That means suppliers are on an honour system, even as the total U.S. market for aloe products, including drinks and vitamins, has grown 11 per cent in the past year to $146 million, according to Chicago-based market researcher SPINS.\n“You have to be very careful when you select and use aloe products,” said Tod Cooperman, president of White Plains, N.Y.-based ConsumerLab.com, which has done aloe testing.\nGetty Images The leaves of an aloe vera plant. Aloe’s three chemical markers — acemannan, malic acid and glucose — were absent in the tests for Wal-Mart, Target and CVS products conducted by a lab hired by Bloomberg News. The three samples contained a cheaper element called maltodextrin, a sugar sometimes used to imitate aloe. The gel that’s sold at another retailer, Walgreens, contained one marker, malic acid, but not the other two. That means the presence of aloe can’t be confirmed or ruled out, said Ken Jones, an independent industry consultant based in Chapala, Mexico.\nTarget declined to comment. Spokesmen for Wal-Mart Stores, CVS Health and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. said their suppliers confirmed to them that their products were authentic. The four retailers have 23,000 outlets between them.\nThe four gels that Bloomberg had analyzed were Wal-Mart’s Equate Aloe After Sun Gel with pure aloe vera; Target’s Up & Up Aloe Vera Gel with pure aloe vera; CVS Aftersun Aloe Vera Moisturizing Gel; and Walgreens Alcohol Free Aloe Vera Body Gel. The lab that did the testing requested anonymity to preserve its business relationships.\nThe tests used a technique called nuclear magnetic resonance. It found additives such as maltodextrin and other ingredients, like triethanolamine, an emulsifier. In all the samples, lactic acid, a component that indicates degraded aloe vera, was absent.\nFruit of the Earth, a Fort Worth, Texas-based aloe brand founded in 1980, said it made the gels for Wal-Mart, Target and Walgreens. Fruit of the Earth said its aloe supplier was Ormond Beach, Fla.-based Concentrated Aloe Corp., which said it uses fair trade, organic aloe that’s farmed and processed in Guatemala.\nBoth companies disputed Bloomberg’s findings.\nRelated ‘Once-a-day’ sun creams a cancer risk, consumer watchdog finds after tests reveal poor UV protection Canada’s consumer protection watchdog Lucie Tedesco could get more bite with new code Health Canada doesn’t regularly test cosmetics for harmful substances, federal audit finds “We’ve been in the business a long time and we know where the raw ingredients come from,” John Dondrea, Fruit of the Earth’s general counsel, said in a telephone interview. “We stand behind our products.”\nTim Meadows, president of Concentrated Aloe Corp., said that nuclear magnetic resonance isn’t reliable for cosmetics because the presence of multiple ingredients can cause interference and there’s no way to test for aloe in finished products. He added that maltodextrin isn’t an adulterant because it can be used in the drying process, and while some ways of processing aloe remove acemannan, that doesn’t mean the aloe isn’t real, he said.\n“Acemannan has been misinterpreted,” Meadows said. “The cosmetics industry requires highly processed aloe. How that affects acemannan is anybody’s guess.”\nWalmart Though it’s true that nuclear magnetic resonance isn’t a test that’s designed to study aloe vera in cosmetics, the lab results suggest that the plant “is not a major component” of the products, said James Neal-Kababick, director of Flora Research Labs in Grants Pass, Ore., which tests and researches natural products. Jones, the consultant who also reviewed some of the tests, said he didn’t see evidence of aloe or interfering substances.\nThe CVS aloe gel was made by Product Quest Manufacturing. The Daytona Beach, Fla.-based firm declined to comment or identify its supplier.\nSeveral law firms, including Bloomfield Hills, Mich.-based Barbat, Mansour & Suciu, have filed lawsuits against the four retailers after separate testing failed to find aloe in the companies’ private-label products. They’re seeking class-action status and restitution for all the customers who they say were misled.\n“No reasonable person would have purchased or used the products if they knew the products did not contain any aloe vera,” attorneys wrote in a complaint filed in September in Illinois on behalf of plaintiffs represented by 10 law firms.\nFruit of the Earth, Wal-Mart, Target, CVS and Walgreens denied the allegations.\nIndependently, ConsumerLab.com said it had Fruit of the Earth brand Aloe Vera 100% Gel tested using nuclear magnetic resonance and found no evidence of aloe, while a competing brand, Aubrey Organics, did contain the markers that indicate aloe. ConsumerLab said it tested a dozen aloe products, including pills and juices, and just half the items appeared to meet the claims on their labels.\nAcemannan is thought to give the plant its beneficial properties, said Jane Wilson, executive director of the International Aloe Science Council in Silver Spring, Md., which represents the industry.\nJesper Hummeluhr, founder of Copenhagen-based cosmetics maker Aloe Vera Group APS, said that if acemannan isn’t detected, the aloe was degraded during the manufacturing process or the product contains no aloe. He’s been making aloe products since 1989.\nTarget “What you have there is not aloe,” said Hummeluhr, who reviewed some of the results without being told the name of the brands. “It could be a lot of water and a little bit of aloe added.”\nAcemannan is as much as 15 per cent of aloe’s makeup. Levels below 0.01 per cent of dry weight won’t register in the tests. Fruit of the Earth’s Dondrea declined to say how much aloe is in the firm’s gels, citing proprietary formulations.\nAloe vera is a succulent farmed in hot climates like Texas and Mexico. Its spiky leaves contain a clear goo that people have used as a topical ointment to treat burns and other skin problems for millennia. Known as the “plant of immortality” in ancient Egypt, it was depicted on stone carvings 6,000 years ago, a burial gift for pharaohs, and it’s been used as a folk remedy for conditions from diabetes to epilepsy, according to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health.\nConcerns over imitation aloe aren’t new. The industry created the International Aloe Science Council in the 1980s as more and more products hit store shelves that contained little or no aloe, said Wilson, the group’s executive director. Maltodextrin, a light-coloured powder that looks like aloe powder and is used as a food additive, was a common filler or substitute. Maltodextrin is cheaper than aloe, Wilson said.\nJeff Barrie, a Keene, N.H.-based sales manager at AloeCorp, one of the biggest suppliers of raw aloe powder, said he’s seen competitors beat his lowest prices by half. That means they’re not selling aloe, he said. Aloe powder can cost as much as $240 a kilogram, he said, while the same amount of maltodextrin can cost a few dollars.\nMaking just one kilogram of aloe powder, the ingredient used in finished goods like gels and drinks, requires 400 kilos of aloe leaves, Barrie said. The process involves removing rinds from the leaves and dehydrating the remaining aloe into a powder form.\nPostmedia News “Aloe is all harvested by hand,” he said. “It’s an involved process and it’s not cheap.”\nThere’s no conclusive body of scientific research affirming aloe’s healing properties. While some studies have shown a benefit for burns and cuts, “there’s nothing to hang your hat on” in terms of clear evidence, partly because there hasn’t been enough research, said D. Craig Hopp, a program director at the National Center for Complementary and Integrated Health in Bethesda, Md.\n“There’s a lot of people that swear by aloe and love it, and if you put it in your product, you’ll sell more of it whether it’s a cream or a lotion for sunburns,” said Gary Shreeve, a vice-president of global operations at Scottsdale, Ariz.-based Forever Living Products, which sells aloe certified by the International Aloe Science Council.\nSome people are old school about aloe. Rather than buying aloe products, they just keep the succulent around the house.\nMeredith Zielke, a documentary filmmaker in Chicago, is one of many aloe lovers who have a simple remedy. She keeps the plant in her home to cool her skin when her Lyme disease acts up. And it works, she said.\n“I like just having it at home to snip it from there,” Zielke said. “I just like the comfort and the knowledge of having a plant in your house that can actually heal you.”\n",

      "text": "The aloe vera gel many Americans buy to soothe damaged skin contains no evidence of aloe vera at all.\nSamples of store-brand aloe gel purchased at national retailers Wal-Mart, Target and CVS showed no indication of the plant in various lab tests. The products all listed aloe barbadensis leaf juice - another name for aloe vera - as either the No. 1 ingredient or No. 2 after water.\nThere's no watchdog assuring that aloe products are what they say they are. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration doesn't approve cosmetics before they're sold and has never levied a fine for selling fake aloe. That means suppliers are on an honor system, even as the total U.S. market for aloe products, including drinks and vitamins, has grown 11 percent in the past year to $146 million, according to Chicago-based market researcher SPINS.\n\"You have to be very careful when you select and use aloe products,\" said Tod Cooperman, president of White Plains, New York-based ConsumerLab.com, which has done aloe testing.\nAloe's three chemical markers - acemannan, malic acid and glucose - were absent in the tests for Wal-Mart, Target and CVS products conducted by a lab hired by Bloomberg News . The three samples contained a cheaper element called maltodextrin, a sugar sometimes used to imitate aloe. The gel that's sold at another retailer, Walgreens, contained one marker, malic acid, but not the other two. That means the presence of aloe can't be confirmed or ruled out, said Ken Jones, an independent industry consultant based in Chapala, Mexico.\nNutrition for sale: How Kellogg worked with 'independent experts' to tout cereal Candace Choi On its website, Kellogg touted a distinguished-sounding \"Breakfast Council\" of \"independent experts\" who helped guide its nutritional efforts.\nNowhere did it say this: The maker of Froot Loops and Frosted Flakes paid the experts and fed them talking points, according to a copy of a contract and...\nOn its website, Kellogg touted a distinguished-sounding \"Breakfast Council\" of \"independent experts\" who helped guide its nutritional efforts.\nNowhere did it say this: The maker of Froot Loops and Frosted Flakes paid the experts and fed them talking points, according to a copy of a contract and...\n(Candace Choi) Target declined to comment. Spokesmen for Wal-Mart Stores, CVS Health and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. said their suppliers confirmed to them that their products were authentic. The four retailers have 23,000 outlets between them.\nThe four gels that Bloomberg had analyzed were Wal-Mart's Equate Aloe After Sun Gel with pure aloe vera; Target's Up & Up Aloe Vera Gel with pure aloe vera; CVS Aftersun Aloe Vera Moisturizing Gel; and Walgreens Alcohol Free Aloe Vera Body Gel. The lab that did the testing requested anonymity to preserve its business relationships.\nThe tests used a technique called nuclear magnetic resonance. It found additives such as maltodextrin and other ingredients, like triethanolamine, an emulsifier. In all the samples, lactic acid, a component that indicates degraded aloe vera, was absent.\nFruit of the Earth, a Fort Worth, Texas-based aloe brand founded in 1980, said it made the gels for Wal-Mart, Target and Walgreens. Fruit of the Earth said its aloe supplier was Ormond Beach, Florida-based Concentrated Aloe Corp., which said it uses fair trade, organic aloe that's farmed and processed in Guatemala.\nBoth companies disputed Bloomberg's findings.\n\"We've been in the business a long time and we know where the raw ingredients come from,'' John Dondrea, Fruit of the Earth's general counsel, said in a telephone interview. \"We stand behind our products.''\nTim Meadows, president of Concentrated Aloe Corp., said that nuclear magnetic resonance isn't reliable for cosmetics because the presence of multiple ingredients can cause interference and there's no way to test for aloe in finished products. He added that maltodextrin isn't an adulterant because it can be used in the drying process, and while some ways of processing aloe remove acemannan, that doesn't mean the aloe isn't real, he said.\n\"Acemannan has been misinterpreted,'' Meadows said. \"The cosmetics industry requires highly processed aloe. How that affects acemannan is anybody's guess.''\nThough it's true that nuclear magnetic resonance isn't a test that's designed to study aloe vera in cosmetics, the lab results suggest that the plant \"is not a major component\" of the products, said James Neal-Kababick, director of Flora Research Labs in Grants Pass, Oregon, which tests and researches natural products. Jones, the consultant who also reviewed some of the tests, said he didn't see evidence of aloe or interfering substances.\nThe CVS aloe gel was made by Product Quest Manufacturing. The Daytona Beach, Florida-based firm declined to comment or identify its supplier.\nSeveral law firms, including Bloomfield Hills, Michigan-based Barbat, Mansour & Suciu, have filed lawsuits against the four retailers after separate testing failed to find aloe in the companies' private-label products. They're seeking class-action status and restitution for all the customers who they say were misled.\n\"No reasonable person would have purchased or used the products if they knew the products did not contain any aloe vera,'' attorneys wrote in a complaint filed in September in Illinois on behalf of plaintiffs represented by 10 law firms.\nFruit of the Earth, Wal-Mart, Target, CVS and Walgreens denied the allegations.\nIndependently, ConsumerLab.com said it had Fruit of the Earth brand Aloe Vera 100% Gel tested using nuclear magnetic resonance and found no evidence of aloe, while a competing brand, Aubrey Organics, did contain the markers that indicate aloe. ConsumerLab said it tested a dozen aloe products, including pills and juices, and just half the items appeared to meet the claims on their labels.\nAcemannan is thought to give the plant its beneficial properties, said Jane Wilson, executive director of the International Aloe Science Council in Silver Spring, Maryland, which represents the industry.\nJesper Hummeluhr, founder of Copenhagen-based cosmetics maker Aloe Vera Group APS, said that if acemannan isn't detected, the aloe was degraded during the manufacturing process or the product contains no aloe. He's been making aloe products since 1989.\n\"What you have there is not aloe,'' said Hummeluhr, who reviewed some of the results without being told the name of the brands. \"It could be a lot of water and a little bit of aloe added.''\nAcemannan is as much as 15 percent of aloe's makeup. Levels below 0.01 percent of dry weight won't register in the tests. Fruit of the Earth's Dondrea declined to say how much aloe is in the firm's gels, citing proprietary formulations.\nAloe vera is a succulent farmed in hot climates like Texas and Mexico. Its spiky leaves contain a clear goo that people have used as a topical ointment to treat burns and other skin problems for millennia. Known as the \"plant of immortality\" in ancient Egypt, it was depicted on stone carvings 6,000 years ago, a burial gift for pharaohs, and it's been used as a folk remedy for conditions from diabetes to epilepsy, according to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health.\nConcerns over imitation aloe aren't new. The industry created the International Aloe Science Council in the 1980s as more and more products hit store shelves that contained little or no aloe, said Wilson, the group's executive director. Maltodextrin, a light-colored powder that looks like aloe powder and is used as a food additive, was a common filler or substitute. Maltodextrin is cheaper than aloe, Wilson said.\nJeff Barrie, a Keene, New Hampshire-based sales manager at AloeCorp, one of the biggest suppliers of raw aloe powder, said he's seen competitors beat his lowest prices by half. That means they're not selling aloe, he said. Aloe powder can cost as much as $240 a kilogram, he said, while the same amount of maltodextrin can cost a few dollars.\nMaking just 1 kilogram of aloe powder, the ingredient used in finished goods like gels and drinks, requires 400 kilos (882 pounds) of aloe leaves, Barrie said. The process involves removing rinds from the leaves and dehydrating the remaining aloe into a powder form.\n\"Aloe is all harvested by hand,\" Barrie said. \"It's an involved process and it's not cheap.\"\nThere's no conclusive body of scientific research affirming aloe's healing properties. While some studies have shown a benefit for burns and cuts, \"there's nothing to hang your hat on\" in terms of clear evidence, partly because there hasn't been enough research, said D. Craig Hopp, a program director at the National Center for Complementary and Integrated Health in Bethesda, Maryland.\n\"There's a lot of people that swear by aloe and love it, and if you put it in your product, you'll sell more of it whether it's a cream or a lotion for sunburns,'' said Gary Shreeve, a vice president of global operations at Scottsdale, Arizona-based Forever Living Products, which sells aloe certified by the International Aloe Science Council.\nSome people are old school about aloe. Rather than buying aloe products, they just keep the succulent around the house.\nMeredith Zielke, a documentary filmmaker in Chicago, is one of many aloe lovers who have a simple remedy. She keeps the plant in her home to cool her skin when her Lyme disease acts up. And it works, she said.\n\"I like just having it at home to snip it from there,\" Zielke said. \"I just like the comfort and the knowledge of having a plant in your house that can actually heal you.\"\n  CVS Health Bloomberg L.P.",

      "text": " 26 A.M. No evidence of aloe vera found in the aloe vera at Wal-Mart, CVS, Target By Lydia Mulvany and Zeke Faux Bloomberg Twitter \nThe aloe vera gel many Americans buy to soothe damaged skin contains no evidence of aloe vera at all. \nSamples of store-brand aloe gel purchased at national retailers Wal-Mart, Target and CVS showed no indication of the plant in various lab tests. The products all listed aloe barbadensis leaf juice – another name for aloe vera – as either the No. 1 ingredient or No. 2 after water. \nThere’s no watchdog assuring that aloe products are what they say they are. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration doesn’t approve cosmetics before they’re sold and has never levied a fine for selling fake aloe. That means suppliers are on an honor system, even as the total U.S. market for aloe products, including drinks and vitamins, has grown 11 percent in the past year to $146 million, according to Chicago-based market researcher SPINS. \n“You have to be very careful when you select and use aloe products,” said Tod Cooperman, president of White Plains, New York-based ConsumerLab.com, which has done aloe testing. \nAloe’s three chemical markers – acemannan, malic acid and glucose – were absent in the tests for Wal-Mart, Target and CVS products conducted by a lab hired by Bloomberg News. The three samples contained a cheaper element called maltodextrin, a sugar sometimes used to imitate aloe. The gel that’s sold at another retailer, Walgreens, contained one marker, malic acid, but not the other two. That means the presence of aloe can’t be confirmed or ruled out, said Ken Jones, an independent industry consultant based in Chapala, Mexico. \nTarget declined to comment. Spokesmen for Wal-Mart Stores, CVS Health and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. said their suppliers confirmed to them that their products were authentic. The four retailers have 23,000 outlets between them. \nThe four gels that Bloomberg had analyzed were Wal-Mart’s Equate Aloe After Sun Gel with pure aloe vera; Target’s Up & Up Aloe Vera Gel with pure aloe vera; CVS Aftersun Aloe Vera Moisturizing Gel; and Walgreens Alcohol Free Aloe Vera Body Gel. The lab that did the testing requested anonymity to preserve its business relationships. \nThe tests used a technique called nuclear magnetic resonance. It found additives such as maltodextrin and other ingredients, like triethanolamine, an emulsifier. In all the samples, lactic acid, a component that indicates degraded aloe vera, was absent. \nFruit of the Earth, a Fort Worth, Texas-based aloe brand founded in 1980, said it made the gels for Wal-Mart, Target and Walgreens. Fruit of the Earth said its aloe supplier was Ormond Beach, Florida-based Concentrated Aloe Corp., which said it uses fair trade, organic aloe that’s farmed and processed in Guatemala. \nBoth companies disputed Bloomberg’s findings. \n“We’ve been in the business a long time and we know where the raw ingredients come from,” John Dondrea, Fruit of the Earth’s general counsel, said in a telephone interview. ”We stand behind our products.” \nTim Meadows, president of Concentrated Aloe Corp., said that nuclear magnetic resonance isn’t reliable for cosmetics because the presence of multiple ingredients can cause interference and there’s no way to test for aloe in finished products. He added that maltodextrin isn’t an adulterant because it can be used in the drying process, and while some ways of processing aloe remove acemannan, that doesn’t mean the aloe isn’t real, he said. \n“Acemannan has been misinterpreted,” Meadows said. ”The cosmetics industry requires highly processed aloe. How that affects acemannan is anybody’s guess.” \nThough it’s true that nuclear magnetic resonance isn’t a test that’s designed to study aloe vera in cosmetics, the lab results suggest that the plant “is not a major component” of the products, said James Neal-Kababick, director of Flora Research Labs in Grants Pass, Oregon, which tests and researches natural products. Jones, the consultant who also reviewed some of the tests, said he didn’t see evidence of aloe or interfering substances. \nThe CVS aloe gel was made by Product Quest Manufacturing. The Daytona Beach, Florida-based firm declined to comment or identify its supplier. \nSeveral law firms, including Bloomfield Hills, Michigan-based Barbat, Mansour & Suciu, have filed lawsuits against the four retailers after separate testing failed to find aloe in the companies’ private-label products. They’re seeking class-action status and restitution for all the customers who they say were misled. \n“No reasonable person would have purchased or used the products if they knew the products did not contain any aloe vera,” attorneys wrote in a complaint filed in September in Illinois on behalf of plaintiffs represented by 10 law firms. \nFruit of the Earth, Wal-Mart, Target, CVS and Walgreens denied the allegations. \nIndependently, ConsumerLab.com said it had Fruit of the Earth brand Aloe Vera 100% Gel tested using nuclear magnetic resonance and found no evidence of aloe, while a competing brand, Aubrey Organics, did contain the markers that indicate aloe. ConsumerLab said it tested a dozen aloe products, including pills and juices, and just half the items appeared to meet the claims on their labels. \nAcemannan is thought to give the plant its beneficial properties, said Jane Wilson, executive director of the International Aloe Science Council in Silver Spring, Maryland, which represents the industry. \nJesper Hummeluhr, founder of Copenhagen-based cosmetics maker Aloe Vera Group APS, said that if acemannan isn’t detected, the aloe was degraded during the manufacturing process or the product contains no aloe. He’s been making aloe products since 1989. \n“What you have there is not aloe,” said Hummeluhr, who reviewed some of the results without being told the name of the brands. “It could be a lot of water and a little bit of aloe added.” \nAcemannan is as much as 15 percent of aloe’s makeup. Levels below 0.01 percent of dry weight won’t register in the tests. Fruit of the Earth’s Dondrea declined to say how much aloe is in the firm’s gels, citing proprietary formulations. \nAloe vera is a succulent farmed in hot climates like Texas and Mexico. Its spiky leaves contain a clear goo that people have used as a topical ointment to treat burns and other skin problems for millennia. Known as the ”plant of immortality“ in ancient Egypt, it was depicted on stone carvings 6,000 years ago, a burial gift for pharaohs, and it’s been used as a folk remedy for conditions from diabetes to epilepsy, according to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health. \nConcerns over imitation aloe aren’t new. The industry created the International Aloe Science Council in the 1980s as more and more products hit store shelves that contained little or no aloe, said Wilson, the group’s executive director. Maltodextrin, a light-colored powder that looks like aloe powder and is used as a food additive, was a common filler or substitute. Maltodextrin is cheaper than aloe, Wilson said. \nJeff Barrie, a Keene, New Hampshire-based sales manager at AloeCorp, one of the biggest suppliers of raw aloe powder, said he’s seen competitors beat his lowest prices by half. That means they’re not selling aloe, he said. Aloe powder can cost as much as $240 a kilogram, he said, while the same amount of maltodextrin can cost a few dollars. \nMaking just 1 kilogram of aloe powder, the ingredient used in finished goods like gels and drinks, requires 400 kilos (882 pounds) of aloe leaves, Barrie said. The process involves removing rinds from the leaves and dehydrating the remaining aloe into a powder form. \n“Aloe is all harvested by hand,“ Barrie said. “It’s an involved process and it’s not cheap.” \nThere’s no conclusive body of scientific research affirming aloe’s healing properties. While some studies have shown a benefit for burns and cuts, ”there’s nothing to hang your hat on“ in terms of clear evidence, partly because there hasn’t been enough research, said D. Craig Hopp, a program director at the National Center for Complementary and Integrated Health in Bethesda, Maryland. \n“There’s a lot of people that swear by aloe and love it, and if you put it in your product, you’ll sell more of it whether it’s a cream or a lotion for sunburns,” said Gary Shreeve, a vice president of global operations at Scottsdale, Arizona-based Forever Living Products, which sells aloe certified by the International Aloe Science Council. \nSome people are old school about aloe. Rather than buying aloe products, they just keep the succulent around the house. \nMeredith Zielke, a documentary filmmaker in Chicago, is one of many aloe lovers who have a simple remedy. She keeps the plant in her home to cool her skin when her Lyme disease acts up. And it works, she said. \n“I like just having it at home to snip it from there,” Zielke said. “I just like the comfort and the knowledge of having a plant in your house that can actually heal you.”  26 a.m.",

      "title": "No evidence of aloe vera found in the aloe vera at Walmart, CVS, Target",
      "text": "The aloe vera gel many Americans buy to soothe damaged skin contains no evidence of aloe vera at all.\nSamples of store-brand aloe gel purchased at national retailers Walmart, Target and CVS showed no indication of the plant in various lab tests. The products all listed aloe barbadensis leaf juice — another name for aloe vera — as either the No. 1 ingredient or No. 2 after water.\nThere's no watchdog assuring that aloe products are what they say they are. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration doesn't approve cosmetics before they're sold and has never levied a fine for selling fake aloe. That means suppliers are on an honour system, even as the total U.S. market for aloe products, including drinks and vitamins, has grown 11 per cent in the past year to $146 million, according to Chicago-based market researcher SPINS.\n\"You have to be very careful when you select and use aloe products,\" said Tod Cooperman, president of White Plains, New York-based ConsumerLab.com, which has done aloe testing.\nAloe's three chemical markers — acemannan, malic acid and glucose — were absent in the tests for Walmart, Target and CVS products conducted by a lab hired by Bloomberg News. The three samples contained a cheaper element called maltodextrin, a sugar sometimes used to imitate aloe. The gel that's sold at another retailer, Walgreens, contained one marker, malic acid, but not the other two. That means the presence of aloe can't be confirmed or ruled out, said Ken Jones, an independent industry consultant based in Chapala, Mexico.\nTarget declined to comment. Spokespeople for Wal-Mart Stores, CVS Health and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. said their suppliers confirmed to them that their products were authentic. The four retailers have 23,000 outlets between them.\nThe four gels that Bloomberg had analyzed were Wal-Mart's Equate Aloe After Sun Gel with pure aloe vera; Target's Up & Up Aloe Vera Gel with pure aloe vera; CVS Aftersun Aloe Vera Moisturizing Gel; and Walgreens Alcohol Free Aloe Vera Body Gel. The lab that did the testing requested anonymity to preserve its business relationships.\nThe tests used a technique called nuclear magnetic resonance. It found additives such as maltodextrin and other ingredients, like triethanolamine, an emulsifier. In all the samples, lactic acid, a component that indicates degraded aloe vera, was absent.\nFruit of the Earth, a Fort Worth, Texas-based aloe brand founded in 1980, said it made the gels for Walmart, Target and Walgreens. Fruit of the Earth said its aloe supplier was Ormond Beach, Florida-based Concentrated Aloe Corp., which said it uses fair trade, organic aloe that's farmed and processed in Guatemala.\nBoth companies disputed Bloomberg's findings.\n\"We've been in the business a long time and we know where the raw ingredients come from,\" John Dondrea, Fruit of the Earth's general counsel, said in a telephone interview. \"We stand behind our products.\"\nTim Meadows, president of Concentrated Aloe Corp., said that nuclear magnetic resonance isn't reliable for cosmetics because the presence of multiple ingredients can cause interference and there's no way to test for aloe in finished products. He added that maltodextrin isn't an adulterant because it can be used in the drying process, and while some ways of processing aloe remove acemannan, that doesn't mean the aloe isn't real, he said.\n\"Acemannan has been misinterpreted,\" Meadows said. \"The cosmetics industry requires highly processed aloe. How that affects acemannan is anybody's guess.\"\nThough it's true that nuclear magnetic resonance isn't a test that's designed to study aloe vera in cosmetics, the lab results suggest that the plant \"is not a major component\" of the products, said James Neal-Kababick, director of Flora Research Labs in Grants Pass, Oregon, which tests and researches natural products. Jones, the consultant who also reviewed some of the tests, said he didn't see evidence of aloe or interfering substances.\nThe CVS aloe gel was made by Product Quest Manufacturing. The Daytona Beach, Florida-based firm declined to comment or identify its supplier.\nSeveral law firms, including Bloomfield Hills, Michigan-based Barbat, Mansour & Suciu, have filed lawsuits against the four retailers after separate testing failed to find aloe in the companies' private-label products. They're seeking class-action status and restitution for all the customers who they say were misled.\n\"No reasonable person would have purchased or used the products if they knew the products did not contain any aloe vera,\" attorneys wrote in a complaint filed in September in Illinois on behalf of plaintiffs represented by 10 law firms.\nFruit of the Earth, Walmart, Target, CVS and Walgreens denied the allegations.\nIndependently, ConsumerLab.com said it had Fruit of the Earth brand Aloe Vera 100% Gel tested using nuclear magnetic resonance and found no evidence of aloe, while a competing brand, Aubrey Organics, did contain the markers that indicate aloe. ConsumerLab said it tested a dozen aloe products, including pills and juices, and just half the items appeared to meet the claims on their labels.\nAcemannan is thought to give the plant its beneficial properties, said Jane Wilson, executive director of the International Aloe Science Council in Silver Spring, Maryland, which represents the industry.\nJesper Hummeluhr, founder of Copenhagen-based cosmetics maker Aloe Vera Group APS, said that if acemannan isn't detected, the aloe was degraded during the manufacturing process or the product contains no aloe. He's been making aloe products since 1989.\n\"What you have there is not aloe,\" said Hummeluhr, who reviewed some of the results without being told the name of the brands. \"It could be a lot of water and a little bit of aloe added.\"\nAcemannan is as much as 15 per cent of aloe's makeup. Levels below 0.01 per cent of dry weight won't register in the tests. Fruit of the Earth's Dondrea declined to say how much aloe is in the firm's gels, citing proprietary formulations.\nAloe vera is a succulent farmed in hot climates like Texas and Mexico. Its spiky leaves contain a clear goo that people have used as a topical ointment to treat burns and other skin problems for millennia. Known as the \"plant of immortality\" in ancient Egypt, it was depicted on stone carvings 6,000 years ago, a burial gift for pharaohs, and it's been used as a folk remedy for conditions from diabetes to epilepsy, according to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health.\nConcerns over imitation aloe aren't new. The industry created the International Aloe Science Council in the 1980s as more and more products hit store shelves that contained little or no aloe, said Wilson, the group's executive director. Maltodextrin, a light-coloured powder that looks like aloe powder and is used as a food additive, was a common filler or substitute. Maltodextrin is cheaper than aloe, Wilson said.\nJeff Barrie, a Keene, New Hampshire-based sales manager at AloeCorp, one of the biggest suppliers of raw aloe powder, said he's seen competitors beat his lowest prices by half. That means they're not selling aloe, he said. Aloe powder can cost as much as $240 a kilogram, he said, while the same amount of maltodextrin can cost a few dollars.\nMaking just 1 kilogram of aloe powder, the ingredient used in finished goods like gels and drinks, requires 400 kilos (882 pounds) of aloe leaves, Barrie said. The process involves removing rinds from the leaves and dehydrating the remaining aloe into a powder form.\n\"Aloe is all harvested by hand,\" Barrie said. \"It's an involved process and it's not cheap.\"\nThere's no conclusive body of scientific research affirming aloe's healing properties. While some studies have shown a benefit for burns and cuts, \"there's nothing to hang your hat on\" in terms of clear evidence, partly because there hasn't been enough research, said D. Craig Hopp, a program director at the National Center for Complementary and Integrated Health in Bethesda, Maryland.\n\"There's a lot of people that swear by aloe and love it, and if you put it in your product, you'll sell more of it whether it's a cream or a lotion for sunburns,\" said Gary Shreeve, a vice president of global operations at Scottsdale, Arizona-based Forever Living Products, which sells aloe certified by the International Aloe Science Council.\nSome people are old school about aloe. Rather than buying aloe products, they just keep the succulent around the house.\nMeredith Zielke, a documentary filmmaker in Chicago, is one of many aloe lovers who have a simple remedy. She keeps the plant in her home to cool her skin when her Lyme disease acts up. And it works, she said.\n\"I like just having it at home to snip it from there,\" Zielke said. \"I just like the comfort and the knowledge of having a plant in your house that can actually heal you.\"",

Photo: Daniel Acker/Bloomberg No evidence of aloe vera found in the aloe vera at Wal-Mart, Target and CVS 1 / 5 Back to Gallery \n(Bloomberg) -- The aloe vera gel many Americans buy to soothe damaged skin contains no evidence of aloe vera at all. \nSamples of store-brand aloe gel purchased at national retailers Wal-Mart, Target and CVS showed no indication of the plant in various lab tests. The products all listed aloe barbadensis leaf juice — another name for aloe vera — as either the No. 1 ingredient or No. 2 after water. \nThere's no watchdog assuring that aloe products are what they say they are. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration doesn't approve cosmetics before they're sold and has never levied a fine for selling fake aloe. That means suppliers are on an honor system, even as the total U.S. market for aloe products, including drinks and vitamins, has grown 11 percent in the past year to $146 million, according to Chicago-based market researcher SPINS LLC. \n\"You have to be very careful when you select and use aloe products,\" said Tod Cooperman, president of White Plains, New York-based ConsumerLab.com, which has done aloe testing. \nAloe's three chemical markers — acemannan, malic acid and glucose — were absent in the tests for Wal-Mart, Target and CVS products conducted by a lab hired by Bloomberg News. The three samples contained a cheaper element called maltodextrin, a sugar sometimes used to imitate aloe. The gel that's sold at another retailer, Walgreens, contained one marker, malic acid, but not the other two. That means the presence of aloe can't be confirmed or ruled out, said Ken Jones, an independent industry consultant based in Chapala, Mexico. \n23,000 Stores \nTarget Corp. declined to comment. Spokesmen for Wal-Mart Stores Inc., CVS Health Corp. and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. said their suppliers confirmed to them that their products were authentic. The four retailers have 23,000 outlets between them. \nThe four gels that Bloomberg had analyzed were Wal-Mart's Equate Aloe After Sun Gel with pure aloe vera; Target's Up & Up Aloe Vera Gel with pure aloe vera; CVS Aftersun Aloe Vera Moisturizing Gel; and Walgreens Alcohol Free Aloe Vera Body Gel. The lab that did the testing requested anonymity to preserve its business relationships. \nThe tests used a technique called nuclear magnetic resonance. It found additives such as maltodextrin and other ingredients, like triethanolamine, an emulsifier. In all the samples, lactic acid, a component that indicates degraded aloe vera, was absent. \nFruit of the Earth, a Fort Worth, Texas-based aloe brand founded in 1980, said it made the gels for Wal-Mart, Target and Walgreens. Fruit of the Earth said its aloe supplier was Ormond Beach, Florida-based Concentrated Aloe Corp., which said it uses fair trade, organic aloe that's farmed and processed in Guatemala. \nBoth companies disputed Bloomberg's findings. \nRaw Ingredients \n\"We've been in the business a long time and we know where the raw ingredients come from,'' John Dondrea, Fruit of the Earth's general counsel, said in a telephone interview. \"We stand behind our products.'' \nTim Meadows, president of Concentrated Aloe Corp., said that nuclear magnetic resonance isn't reliable for cosmetics because the presence of multiple ingredients can cause interference and there's no way to test for aloe in finished products. He added that maltodextrin isn't an adulterant because it can be used in the drying process, and while some ways of processing aloe remove acemannan, that doesn't mean the aloe isn't real, he said. \n\"Acemannan has been misinterpreted,'' Meadows said. \"The cosmetics industry requires highly processed aloe. How that affects acemannan is anybody's guess.'' \nThough it's true that nuclear magnetic resonance isn't a test that's designed to study aloe vera in cosmetics, the lab results suggest that the plant \"is not a major component\" of the products, said James Neal-Kababick, director of Flora Research Labs in Grants Pass, Oregon, which tests and researches natural products. Jones, the consultant who also reviewed some of the tests, said he didn't see evidence of aloe or interfering substances. \nThe CVS aloe gel was made by Product Quest Manufacturing LLC. The Daytona Beach, Florida-based firm declined to comment or identify its supplier. \nLawsuits Filed \nSeveral law firms, including Bloomfield Hills, Michigan-based Barbat, Mansour & Suciu PLLC, have filed lawsuits against the four retailers after separate testing failed to find aloe in the companies' private-label products. They're seeking class-action status and restitution for all the customers who they say were misled. \nSee also: The Parmesan Cheese You Sprinkle on Your Penne Could Be Wood \n\"No reasonable person would have purchased or used the products if they knew the products did not contain any aloe vera,'' attorneys wrote in a complaint filed in September in Illinois on behalf of plaintiffs represented by 10 law firms. \nFruit of the Earth, Wal-Mart, Target, CVS and Walgreens denied the allegations. \nIndependently, ConsumerLab.com said it had Fruit of the Earth brand Aloe Vera 100% Gel tested using nuclear magnetic resonance and found no evidence of aloe, while a competing brand, Aubrey Organics, did contain the markers that indicate aloe. ConsumerLab said it tested a dozen aloe products, including pills and juices, and just half the items appeared to meet the claims on their labels. \nBeneficial Properties \nAcemannan is thought to give the plant its beneficial properties, said Jane Wilson, executive director of the International Aloe Science Council in Silver Spring, Maryland, which represents the industry. \nJesper Hummeluhr, founder of Copenhagen-based cosmetics maker Aloe Vera Group APS, said that if acemannan isn't detected, the aloe was degraded during the manufacturing process or the product contains no aloe. He's been making aloe products since 1989. \n\"What you have there is not aloe,'' said Hummeluhr, who reviewed some of the results without being told the name of the brands. \"It could be a lot of water and a little bit of aloe added.'' \nReliability Questioned \nAcemannan is as much as 15 percent of aloe's makeup. Levels below 0.01 percent of dry weight won't register in the tests. Fruit of the Earth's Dondrea declined to say how much aloe is in the firm's gels, citing proprietary formulations. \nAloe vera is a succulent farmed in hot climates like Texas and Mexico. Its spiky leaves contain a clear goo that people have used as a topical ointment to treat burns and other skin problems for millennia. Known as the \"plant of immortality\" in ancient Egypt, it was depicted on stone carvings 6,000 years ago, a burial gift for pharaohs, and it's been used as a folk remedy for conditions from diabetes to epilepsy, according to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health. \nImitation Aloe \nConcerns over imitation aloe aren't new. The industry created the International Aloe Science Council in the 1980s as more and more products hit store shelves that contained little or no aloe, said Wilson, the group's executive director. Maltodextrin, a light-colored powder that looks like aloe powder and is used as a food additive, was a common filler or substitute. Maltodextrin is cheaper than aloe, Wilson said. \nJeff Barrie, a Keene, New Hampshire-based sales manager at AloeCorp, one of the biggest suppliers of raw aloe powder, said he's seen competitors beat his lowest prices by half. That means they're not selling aloe, he said. Aloe powder can cost as much as $240 a kilogram, he said, while the same amount of maltodextrin can cost a few dollars. \nMaking just 1 kilogram of aloe powder, the ingredient used in finished goods like gels and drinks, requires 400 kilos (882 pounds) of aloe leaves, Barrie said. The process involves removing rinds from the leaves and dehydrating the remaining aloe into a powder form. \n\"Aloe is all harvested by hand,\" Barrie said. \"It's an involved process and it's not cheap.\" \nThere's no conclusive body of scientific research affirming aloe's healing properties. While some studies have shown a benefit for burns and cuts, \"there's nothing to hang your hat on\" in terms of clear evidence, partly because there hasn't been enough research, said D. Craig Hopp, a program director at the National Center for Complementary and Integrated Health in Bethesda, Maryland. \nLoving Aloe \n\"There's a lot of people that swear by aloe and love it, and if you put it in your product, you'll sell more of it whether it's a cream or a lotion for sunburns,'' said Gary Shreeve, a vice president of global operations at Scottsdale, Arizona-based Forever Living Products, which sells aloe certified by the International Aloe Science Council. \nSome people are old school about aloe. Rather than buying aloe products, they just keep the succulent around the house. \nMeredith Zielke, a documentary filmmaker in Chicago, is one of many aloe lovers who have a simple remedy. She keeps the plant in her home to cool her skin when her Lyme disease acts up. And it works, she said. \n\"I like just having it at home to snip it from there,\" Zielke said. \"I just like the comfort and the knowledge of having a plant in your house that can actually heal you.\" Latest Lifestyle Video ",

      "text": "No evidence of aloe vera found in the aloe vera at Wal-Mart, CVS, Target Tuesday Nov 22, 2016 at 12:00 PM Lydia Mulvany, Zeke Faux - Bloomberg \nThe aloe vera gel many Americans buy to soothe damaged skin contains no evidence of aloe vera at all. \nSamples of store-brand aloe gel purchased at national retailers Wal-Mart, Target and CVS showed no indication of the plant in various lab tests. The products all listed aloe barbadensis leaf juice - another name for aloe vera - as either the No. 1 ingredient or No. 2 after water. \nThere's no watchdog assuring that aloe products are what they say they are. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration doesn't approve cosmetics before they're sold and has never levied a fine for selling fake aloe. That means suppliers are on an honor system, even as the total U.S. market for aloe products, including drinks and vitamins, has grown 11 percent in the past year to $146 million, according to Chicago-based market researcher SPINS. \n\"You have to be very careful when you select and use aloe products,\" said Tod Cooperman, president of White Plains, New York-based ConsumerLab.com, which has done aloe testing. \nAloe's three chemical markers - acemannan, malic acid and glucose - were absent in the tests for Wal-Mart, Target and CVS products conducted by a lab hired by Bloomberg News. The three samples contained a cheaper element called maltodextrin, a sugar sometimes used to imitate aloe. The gel that's sold at another retailer, Walgreens, contained one marker, malic acid, but not the other two. That means the presence of aloe can't be confirmed or ruled out, said Ken Jones, an independent industry consultant based in Chapala, Mexico. \nTarget declined to comment. Spokesmen for Wal-Mart Stores, CVS Health and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. said their suppliers confirmed to them that their products were authentic. The four retailers have 23,000 outlets between them. \nThe four gels that Bloomberg had analyzed were Wal-Mart's Equate Aloe After Sun Gel with pure aloe vera; Target's Up & Up Aloe Vera Gel with pure aloe vera; CVS Aftersun Aloe Vera Moisturizing Gel; and Walgreens Alcohol Free Aloe Vera Body Gel. The lab that did the testing requested anonymity to preserve its business relationships. \nThe tests used a technique called nuclear magnetic resonance. It found additives such as maltodextrin and other ingredients, like triethanolamine, an emulsifier. In all the samples, lactic acid, a component that indicates degraded aloe vera, was absent. \nFruit of the Earth, a Fort Worth, Texas-based aloe brand founded in 1980, said it made the gels for Wal-Mart, Target and Walgreens. Fruit of the Earth said its aloe supplier was Ormond Beach, Florida-based Concentrated Aloe Corp., which said it uses fair trade, organic aloe that's farmed and processed in Guatemala. \nBoth companies disputed Bloomberg's findings. \n\"We've been in the business a long time and we know where the raw ingredients come from,'' John Dondrea, Fruit of the Earth's general counsel, said in a telephone interview. \"We stand behind our products.'' \nTim Meadows, president of Concentrated Aloe Corp., said that nuclear magnetic resonance isn't reliable for cosmetics because the presence of multiple ingredients can cause interference and there's no way to test for aloe in finished products. He added that maltodextrin isn't an adulterant because it can be used in the drying process, and while some ways of processing aloe remove acemannan, that doesn't mean the aloe isn't real, he said. \n\"Acemannan has been misinterpreted,'' Meadows said. \"The cosmetics industry requires highly processed aloe. How that affects acemannan is anybody's guess.'' \nThough it's true that nuclear magnetic resonance isn't a test that's designed to study aloe vera in cosmetics, the lab results suggest that the plant \"is not a major component\" of the products, said James Neal-Kababick, director of Flora Research Labs in Grants Pass, Oregon, which tests and researches natural products. Jones, the consultant who also reviewed some of the tests, said he didn't see evidence of aloe or interfering substances. \nThe CVS aloe gel was made by Product Quest Manufacturing. The Daytona Beach, Florida-based firm declined to comment or identify its supplier. \nSeveral law firms, including Bloomfield Hills, Michigan-based Barbat, Mansour & Suciu, have filed lawsuits against the four retailers after separate testing failed to find aloe in the companies' private-label products. They're seeking class-action status and restitution for all the customers who they say were misled. \n\"No reasonable person would have purchased or used the products if they knew the products did not contain any aloe vera,'' attorneys wrote in a complaint filed in September in Illinois on behalf of plaintiffs represented by 10 law firms. \nFruit of the Earth, Wal-Mart, Target, CVS and Walgreens denied the allegations. \nIndependently, ConsumerLab.com said it had Fruit of the Earth brand Aloe Vera 100% Gel tested using nuclear magnetic resonance and found no evidence of aloe, while a competing brand, Aubrey Organics, did contain the markers that indicate aloe. ConsumerLab said it tested a dozen aloe products, including pills and juices, and just half the items appeared to meet the claims on their labels. \nAcemannan is thought to give the plant its beneficial properties, said Jane Wilson, executive director of the International Aloe Science Council in Silver Spring, Maryland, which represents the industry. \nJesper Hummeluhr, founder of Copenhagen-based cosmetics maker Aloe Vera Group APS, said that if acemannan isn't detected, the aloe was degraded during the manufacturing process or the product contains no aloe. He's been making aloe products since 1989. \n\"What you have there is not aloe,'' said Hummeluhr, who reviewed some of the results without being told the name of the brands. \"It could be a lot of water and a little bit of aloe added.'' \nAcemannan is as much as 15 percent of aloe's makeup. Levels below 0.01 percent of dry weight won't register in the tests. Fruit of the Earth's Dondrea declined to say how much aloe is in the firm's gels, citing proprietary formulations. \nAloe vera is a succulent farmed in hot climates like Texas and Mexico. Its spiky leaves contain a clear goo that people have used as a topical ointment to treat burns and other skin problems for millennia. Known as the \"plant of immortality\" in ancient Egypt, it was depicted on stone carvings 6,000 years ago, a burial gift for pharaohs, and it's been used as a folk remedy for conditions from diabetes to epilepsy, according to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health. \nConcerns over imitation aloe aren't new. The industry created the International Aloe Science Council in the 1980s as more and more products hit store shelves that contained little or no aloe, said Wilson, the group's executive director. Maltodextrin, a light-colored powder that looks like aloe powder and is used as a food additive, was a common filler or substitute. Maltodextrin is cheaper than aloe, Wilson said. \nJeff Barrie, a Keene, New Hampshire-based sales manager at AloeCorp, one of the biggest suppliers of raw aloe powder, said he's seen competitors beat his lowest prices by half. That means they're not selling aloe, he said. Aloe powder can cost as much as $240 a kilogram, he said, while the same amount of maltodextrin can cost a few dollars. \nMaking just 1 kilogram of aloe powder, the ingredient used in finished goods like gels and drinks, requires 400 kilos (882 pounds) of aloe leaves, Barrie said. The process involves removing rinds from the leaves and dehydrating the remaining aloe into a powder form. \n\"Aloe is all harvested by hand,\" Barrie said. \"It's an involved process and it's not cheap.\" \nThere's no conclusive body of scientific research affirming aloe's healing properties. While some studies have shown a benefit for burns and cuts, \"there's nothing to hang your hat on\" in terms of clear evidence, partly because there hasn't been enough research, said D. Craig Hopp, a program director at the National Center for Complementary and Integrated Health in Bethesda, Maryland. \n\"There's a lot of people that swear by aloe and love it, and if you put it in your product, you'll sell more of it whether it's a cream or a lotion for sunburns,'' said Gary Shreeve, a vice president of global operations at Scottsdale, Arizona-based Forever Living Products, which sells aloe certified by the International Aloe Science Council. \nSome people are old school about aloe. Rather than buying aloe products, they just keep the succulent around the house. \nMeredith Zielke, a documentary filmmaker in Chicago, is one of many aloe lovers who have a simple remedy. She keeps the plant in her home to cool her skin when her Lyme disease acts up. And it works, she said. \n\"I like just having it at home to snip it from there,\" Zielke said. \"I just like the comfort and the knowledge of having a plant in your house that can actually heal you.\" Authors Information:",

      "text": "No evidence of aloe vera found in the aloe vera at Wal-Mart, CVS, Target Tuesday Nov 22, 2016 at 12:00 PM Lydia Mulvany, Zeke Faux - Bloomberg \nThe aloe vera gel many Americans buy to soothe damaged skin contains no evidence of aloe vera at all. \nSamples of store-brand aloe gel purchased at national retailers Wal-Mart, Target and CVS showed no indication of the plant in various lab tests. The products all listed aloe barbadensis leaf juice - another name for aloe vera - as either the No. 1 ingredient or No. 2 after water. \nThere's no watchdog assuring that aloe products are what they say they are. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration doesn't approve cosmetics before they're sold and has never levied a fine for selling fake aloe. That means suppliers are on an honor system, even as the total U.S. market for aloe products, including drinks and vitamins, has grown 11 percent in the past year to $146 million, according to Chicago-based market researcher SPINS. \n\"You have to be very careful when you select and use aloe products,\" said Tod Cooperman, president of White Plains, New York-based ConsumerLab.com, which has done aloe testing. \nAloe's three chemical markers - acemannan, malic acid and glucose - were absent in the tests for Wal-Mart, Target and CVS products conducted by a lab hired by Bloomberg News. The three samples contained a cheaper element called maltodextrin, a sugar sometimes used to imitate aloe. The gel that's sold at another retailer, Walgreens, contained one marker, malic acid, but not the other two. That means the presence of aloe can't be confirmed or ruled out, said Ken Jones, an independent industry consultant based in Chapala, Mexico. \nTarget declined to comment. Spokesmen for Wal-Mart Stores, CVS Health and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. said their suppliers confirmed to them that their products were authentic. The four retailers have 23,000 outlets between them. \nThe four gels that Bloomberg had analyzed were Wal-Mart's Equate Aloe After Sun Gel with pure aloe vera; Target's Up & Up Aloe Vera Gel with pure aloe vera; CVS Aftersun Aloe Vera Moisturizing Gel; and Walgreens Alcohol Free Aloe Vera Body Gel. The lab that did the testing requested anonymity to preserve its business relationships. \nThe tests used a technique called nuclear magnetic resonance. It found additives such as maltodextrin and other ingredients, like triethanolamine, an emulsifier. In all the samples, lactic acid, a component that indicates degraded aloe vera, was absent. \nFruit of the Earth, a Fort Worth, Texas-based aloe brand founded in 1980, said it made the gels for Wal-Mart, Target and Walgreens. Fruit of the Earth said its aloe supplier was Ormond Beach, Florida-based Concentrated Aloe Corp., which said it uses fair trade, organic aloe that's farmed and processed in Guatemala. \nBoth companies disputed Bloomberg's findings. \n\"We've been in the business a long time and we know where the raw ingredients come from,'' John Dondrea, Fruit of the Earth's general counsel, said in a telephone interview. \"We stand behind our products.'' \nTim Meadows, president of Concentrated Aloe Corp., said that nuclear magnetic resonance isn't reliable for cosmetics because the presence of multiple ingredients can cause interference and there's no way to test for aloe in finished products. He added that maltodextrin isn't an adulterant because it can be used in the drying process, and while some ways of processing aloe remove acemannan, that doesn't mean the aloe isn't real, he said. \n\"Acemannan has been misinterpreted,'' Meadows said. \"The cosmetics industry requires highly processed aloe. How that affects acemannan is anybody's guess.'' \nThough it's true that nuclear magnetic resonance isn't a test that's designed to study aloe vera in cosmetics, the lab results suggest that the plant \"is not a major component\" of the products, said James Neal-Kababick, director of Flora Research Labs in Grants Pass, Oregon, which tests and researches natural products. Jones, the consultant who also reviewed some of the tests, said he didn't see evidence of aloe or interfering substances. \nThe CVS aloe gel was made by Product Quest Manufacturing. The Daytona Beach, Florida-based firm declined to comment or identify its supplier. \nSeveral law firms, including Bloomfield Hills, Michigan-based Barbat, Mansour & Suciu, have filed lawsuits against the four retailers after separate testing failed to find aloe in the companies' private-label products. They're seeking class-action status and restitution for all the customers who they say were misled. \n\"No reasonable person would have purchased or used the products if they knew the products did not contain any aloe vera,'' attorneys wrote in a complaint filed in September in Illinois on behalf of plaintiffs represented by 10 law firms. \nFruit of the Earth, Wal-Mart, Target, CVS and Walgreens denied the allegations. \nIndependently, ConsumerLab.com said it had Fruit of the Earth brand Aloe Vera 100% Gel tested using nuclear magnetic resonance and found no evidence of aloe, while a competing brand, Aubrey Organics, did contain the markers that indicate aloe. ConsumerLab said it tested a dozen aloe products, including pills and juices, and just half the items appeared to meet the claims on their labels. \nAcemannan is thought to give the plant its beneficial properties, said Jane Wilson, executive director of the International Aloe Science Council in Silver Spring, Maryland, which represents the industry. \nJesper Hummeluhr, founder of Copenhagen-based cosmetics maker Aloe Vera Group APS, said that if acemannan isn't detected, the aloe was degraded during the manufacturing process or the product contains no aloe. He's been making aloe products since 1989. \n\"What you have there is not aloe,'' said Hummeluhr, who reviewed some of the results without being told the name of the brands. \"It could be a lot of water and a little bit of aloe added.'' \nAcemannan is as much as 15 percent of aloe's makeup. Levels below 0.01 percent of dry weight won't register in the tests. Fruit of the Earth's Dondrea declined to say how much aloe is in the firm's gels, citing proprietary formulations. \nAloe vera is a succulent farmed in hot climates like Texas and Mexico. Its spiky leaves contain a clear goo that people have used as a topical ointment to treat burns and other skin problems for millennia. Known as the \"plant of immortality\" in ancient Egypt, it was depicted on stone carvings 6,000 years ago, a burial gift for pharaohs, and it's been used as a folk remedy for conditions from diabetes to epilepsy, according to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health. \nConcerns over imitation aloe aren't new. The industry created the International Aloe Science Council in the 1980s as more and more products hit store shelves that contained little or no aloe, said Wilson, the group's executive director. Maltodextrin, a light-colored powder that looks like aloe powder and is used as a food additive, was a common filler or substitute. Maltodextrin is cheaper than aloe, Wilson said. \nJeff Barrie, a Keene, New Hampshire-based sales manager at AloeCorp, one of the biggest suppliers of raw aloe powder, said he's seen competitors beat his lowest prices by half. That means they're not selling aloe, he said. Aloe powder can cost as much as $240 a kilogram, he said, while the same amount of maltodextrin can cost a few dollars. \nMaking just 1 kilogram of aloe powder, the ingredient used in finished goods like gels and drinks, requires 400 kilos (882 pounds) of aloe leaves, Barrie said. The process involves removing rinds from the leaves and dehydrating the remaining aloe into a powder form. \n\"Aloe is all harvested by hand,\" Barrie said. \"It's an involved process and it's not cheap.\" \nThere's no conclusive body of scientific research affirming aloe's healing properties. While some studies have shown a benefit for burns and cuts, \"there's nothing to hang your hat on\" in terms of clear evidence, partly because there hasn't been enough research, said D. Craig Hopp, a program director at the National Center for Complementary and Integrated Health in Bethesda, Maryland. \n\"There's a lot of people that swear by aloe and love it, and if you put it in your product, you'll sell more of it whether it's a cream or a lotion for sunburns,'' said Gary Shreeve, a vice president of global operations at Scottsdale, Arizona-based Forever Living Products, which sells aloe certified by the International Aloe Science Council. \nSome people are old school about aloe. Rather than buying aloe products, they just keep the succulent around the house. \nMeredith Zielke, a documentary filmmaker in Chicago, is one of many aloe lovers who have a simple remedy. She keeps the plant in her home to cool her skin when her Lyme disease acts up. And it works, she said. \n\"I like just having it at home to snip it from there,\" Zielke said. \"I just like the comfort and the knowledge of having a plant in your house that can actually heal you.\" Authors Information:",

      "text": "No evidence of aloe vera found in the aloe vera at Wal-Mart, CVS, Target Tuesday Nov 22, 2016 at 12:00 PM Lydia Mulvany, Zeke Faux - Bloomberg \nThe aloe vera gel many Americans buy to soothe damaged skin contains no evidence of aloe vera at all. \nSamples of store-brand aloe gel purchased at national retailers Wal-Mart, Target and CVS showed no indication of the plant in various lab tests. The products all listed aloe barbadensis leaf juice - another name for aloe vera - as either the No. 1 ingredient or No. 2 after water. \nThere's no watchdog assuring that aloe products are what they say they are. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration doesn't approve cosmetics before they're sold and has never levied a fine for selling fake aloe. That means suppliers are on an honor system, even as the total U.S. market for aloe products, including drinks and vitamins, has grown 11 percent in the past year to $146 million, according to Chicago-based market researcher SPINS. \n\"You have to be very careful when you select and use aloe products,\" said Tod Cooperman, president of White Plains, New York-based ConsumerLab.com, which has done aloe testing. \nAloe's three chemical markers - acemannan, malic acid and glucose - were absent in the tests for Wal-Mart, Target and CVS products conducted by a lab hired by Bloomberg News. The three samples contained a cheaper element called maltodextrin, a sugar sometimes used to imitate aloe. The gel that's sold at another retailer, Walgreens, contained one marker, malic acid, but not the other two. That means the presence of aloe can't be confirmed or ruled out, said Ken Jones, an independent industry consultant based in Chapala, Mexico. \nTarget declined to comment. Spokesmen for Wal-Mart Stores, CVS Health and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. said their suppliers confirmed to them that their products were authentic. The four retailers have 23,000 outlets between them. \nThe four gels that Bloomberg had analyzed were Wal-Mart's Equate Aloe After Sun Gel with pure aloe vera; Target's Up & Up Aloe Vera Gel with pure aloe vera; CVS Aftersun Aloe Vera Moisturizing Gel; and Walgreens Alcohol Free Aloe Vera Body Gel. The lab that did the testing requested anonymity to preserve its business relationships. \nThe tests used a technique called nuclear magnetic resonance. It found additives such as maltodextrin and other ingredients, like triethanolamine, an emulsifier. In all the samples, lactic acid, a component that indicates degraded aloe vera, was absent. \nFruit of the Earth, a Fort Worth, Texas-based aloe brand founded in 1980, said it made the gels for Wal-Mart, Target and Walgreens. Fruit of the Earth said its aloe supplier was Ormond Beach, Florida-based Concentrated Aloe Corp., which said it uses fair trade, organic aloe that's farmed and processed in Guatemala. \nBoth companies disputed Bloomberg's findings. \n\"We've been in the business a long time and we know where the raw ingredients come from,'' John Dondrea, Fruit of the Earth's general counsel, said in a telephone interview. \"We stand behind our products.'' \nTim Meadows, president of Concentrated Aloe Corp., said that nuclear magnetic resonance isn't reliable for cosmetics because the presence of multiple ingredients can cause interference and there's no way to test for aloe in finished products. He added that maltodextrin isn't an adulterant because it can be used in the drying process, and while some ways of processing aloe remove acemannan, that doesn't mean the aloe isn't real, he said. \n\"Acemannan has been misinterpreted,'' Meadows said. \"The cosmetics industry requires highly processed aloe. How that affects acemannan is anybody's guess.'' \nThough it's true that nuclear magnetic resonance isn't a test that's designed to study aloe vera in cosmetics, the lab results suggest that the plant \"is not a major component\" of the products, said James Neal-Kababick, director of Flora Research Labs in Grants Pass, Oregon, which tests and researches natural products. Jones, the consultant who also reviewed some of the tests, said he didn't see evidence of aloe or interfering substances. \nThe CVS aloe gel was made by Product Quest Manufacturing. The Daytona Beach, Florida-based firm declined to comment or identify its supplier. \nSeveral law firms, including Bloomfield Hills, Michigan-based Barbat, Mansour & Suciu, have filed lawsuits against the four retailers after separate testing failed to find aloe in the companies' private-label products. They're seeking class-action status and restitution for all the customers who they say were misled. \n\"No reasonable person would have purchased or used the products if they knew the products did not contain any aloe vera,'' attorneys wrote in a complaint filed in September in Illinois on behalf of plaintiffs represented by 10 law firms. \nFruit of the Earth, Wal-Mart, Target, CVS and Walgreens denied the allegations. \nIndependently, ConsumerLab.com said it had Fruit of the Earth brand Aloe Vera 100% Gel tested using nuclear magnetic resonance and found no evidence of aloe, while a competing brand, Aubrey Organics, did contain the markers that indicate aloe. ConsumerLab said it tested a dozen aloe products, including pills and juices, and just half the items appeared to meet the claims on their labels. \nAcemannan is thought to give the plant its beneficial properties, said Jane Wilson, executive director of the International Aloe Science Council in Silver Spring, Maryland, which represents the industry. \nJesper Hummeluhr, founder of Copenhagen-based cosmetics maker Aloe Vera Group APS, said that if acemannan isn't detected, the aloe was degraded during the manufacturing process or the product contains no aloe. He's been making aloe products since 1989. \n\"What you have there is not aloe,'' said Hummeluhr, who reviewed some of the results without being told the name of the brands. \"It could be a lot of water and a little bit of aloe added.'' \nAcemannan is as much as 15 percent of aloe's makeup. Levels below 0.01 percent of dry weight won't register in the tests. Fruit of the Earth's Dondrea declined to say how much aloe is in the firm's gels, citing proprietary formulations. \nAloe vera is a succulent farmed in hot climates like Texas and Mexico. Its spiky leaves contain a clear goo that people have used as a topical ointment to treat burns and other skin problems for millennia. Known as the \"plant of immortality\" in ancient Egypt, it was depicted on stone carvings 6,000 years ago, a burial gift for pharaohs, and it's been used as a folk remedy for conditions from diabetes to epilepsy, according to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health. \nConcerns over imitation aloe aren't new. The industry created the International Aloe Science Council in the 1980s as more and more products hit store shelves that contained little or no aloe, said Wilson, the group's executive director. Maltodextrin, a light-colored powder that looks like aloe powder and is used as a food additive, was a common filler or substitute. Maltodextrin is cheaper than aloe, Wilson said. \nJeff Barrie, a Keene, New Hampshire-based sales manager at AloeCorp, one of the biggest suppliers of raw aloe powder, said he's seen competitors beat his lowest prices by half. That means they're not selling aloe, he said. Aloe powder can cost as much as $240 a kilogram, he said, while the same amount of maltodextrin can cost a few dollars. \nMaking just 1 kilogram of aloe powder, the ingredient used in finished goods like gels and drinks, requires 400 kilos (882 pounds) of aloe leaves, Barrie said. The process involves removing rinds from the leaves and dehydrating the remaining aloe into a powder form. \n\"Aloe is all harvested by hand,\" Barrie said. \"It's an involved process and it's not cheap.\" \nThere's no conclusive body of scientific research affirming aloe's healing properties. While some studies have shown a benefit for burns and cuts, \"there's nothing to hang your hat on\" in terms of clear evidence, partly because there hasn't been enough research, said D. Craig Hopp, a program director at the National Center for Complementary and Integrated Health in Bethesda, Maryland. \n\"There's a lot of people that swear by aloe and love it, and if you put it in your product, you'll sell more of it whether it's a cream or a lotion for sunburns,'' said Gary Shreeve, a vice president of global operations at Scottsdale, Arizona-based Forever Living Products, which sells aloe certified by the International Aloe Science Council. \nSome people are old school about aloe. Rather than buying aloe products, they just keep the succulent around the house. \nMeredith Zielke, a documentary filmmaker in Chicago, is one of many aloe lovers who have a simple remedy. She keeps the plant in her home to cool her skin when her Lyme disease acts up. And it works, she said. \n\"I like just having it at home to snip it from there,\" Zielke said. \"I just like the comfort and the knowledge of having a plant in your house that can actually heal you.\" Authors Information:",

      "text": "No evidence of aloe vera found in the aloe vera at Wal-Mart, CVS, Target Tuesday Nov 22, 2016 at 12:00 PM Lydia Mulvany, Zeke Faux - Bloomberg \nThe aloe vera gel many Americans buy to soothe damaged skin contains no evidence of aloe vera at all. \nSamples of store-brand aloe gel purchased at national retailers Wal-Mart, Target and CVS showed no indication of the plant in various lab tests. The products all listed aloe barbadensis leaf juice - another name for aloe vera - as either the No. 1 ingredient or No. 2 after water. \nThere's no watchdog assuring that aloe products are what they say they are. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration doesn't approve cosmetics before they're sold and has never levied a fine for selling fake aloe. That means suppliers are on an honor system, even as the total U.S. market for aloe products, including drinks and vitamins, has grown 11 percent in the past year to $146 million, according to Chicago-based market researcher SPINS. \n\"You have to be very careful when you select and use aloe products,\" said Tod Cooperman, president of White Plains, New York-based ConsumerLab.com, which has done aloe testing. \nAloe's three chemical markers - acemannan, malic acid and glucose - were absent in the tests for Wal-Mart, Target and CVS products conducted by a lab hired by Bloomberg News. The three samples contained a cheaper element called maltodextrin, a sugar sometimes used to imitate aloe. The gel that's sold at another retailer, Walgreens, contained one marker, malic acid, but not the other two. That means the presence of aloe can't be confirmed or ruled out, said Ken Jones, an independent industry consultant based in Chapala, Mexico. \nTarget declined to comment. Spokesmen for Wal-Mart Stores, CVS Health and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. said their suppliers confirmed to them that their products were authentic. The four retailers have 23,000 outlets between them. \nThe four gels that Bloomberg had analyzed were Wal-Mart's Equate Aloe After Sun Gel with pure aloe vera; Target's Up & Up Aloe Vera Gel with pure aloe vera; CVS Aftersun Aloe Vera Moisturizing Gel; and Walgreens Alcohol Free Aloe Vera Body Gel. The lab that did the testing requested anonymity to preserve its business relationships. \nThe tests used a technique called nuclear magnetic resonance. It found additives such as maltodextrin and other ingredients, like triethanolamine, an emulsifier. In all the samples, lactic acid, a component that indicates degraded aloe vera, was absent. \nFruit of the Earth, a Fort Worth, Texas-based aloe brand founded in 1980, said it made the gels for Wal-Mart, Target and Walgreens. Fruit of the Earth said its aloe supplier was Ormond Beach, Florida-based Concentrated Aloe Corp., which said it uses fair trade, organic aloe that's farmed and processed in Guatemala. \nBoth companies disputed Bloomberg's findings. \n\"We've been in the business a long time and we know where the raw ingredients come from,'' John Dondrea, Fruit of the Earth's general counsel, said in a telephone interview. \"We stand behind our products.'' \nTim Meadows, president of Concentrated Aloe Corp., said that nuclear magnetic resonance isn't reliable for cosmetics because the presence of multiple ingredients can cause interference and there's no way to test for aloe in finished products. He added that maltodextrin isn't an adulterant because it can be used in the drying process, and while some ways of processing aloe remove acemannan, that doesn't mean the aloe isn't real, he said. \n\"Acemannan has been misinterpreted,'' Meadows said. \"The cosmetics industry requires highly processed aloe. How that affects acemannan is anybody's guess.'' \nThough it's true that nuclear magnetic resonance isn't a test that's designed to study aloe vera in cosmetics, the lab results suggest that the plant \"is not a major component\" of the products, said James Neal-Kababick, director of Flora Research Labs in Grants Pass, Oregon, which tests and researches natural products. Jones, the consultant who also reviewed some of the tests, said he didn't see evidence of aloe or interfering substances. \nThe CVS aloe gel was made by Product Quest Manufacturing. The Daytona Beach, Florida-based firm declined to comment or identify its supplier. \nSeveral law firms, including Bloomfield Hills, Michigan-based Barbat, Mansour & Suciu, have filed lawsuits against the four retailers after separate testing failed to find aloe in the companies' private-label products. They're seeking class-action status and restitution for all the customers who they say were misled. \n\"No reasonable person would have purchased or used the products if they knew the products did not contain any aloe vera,'' attorneys wrote in a complaint filed in September in Illinois on behalf of plaintiffs represented by 10 law firms. \nFruit of the Earth, Wal-Mart, Target, CVS and Walgreens denied the allegations. \nIndependently, ConsumerLab.com said it had Fruit of the Earth brand Aloe Vera 100% Gel tested using nuclear magnetic resonance and found no evidence of aloe, while a competing brand, Aubrey Organics, did contain the markers that indicate aloe. ConsumerLab said it tested a dozen aloe products, including pills and juices, and just half the items appeared to meet the claims on their labels. \nAcemannan is thought to give the plant its beneficial properties, said Jane Wilson, executive director of the International Aloe Science Council in Silver Spring, Maryland, which represents the industry. \nJesper Hummeluhr, founder of Copenhagen-based cosmetics maker Aloe Vera Group APS, said that if acemannan isn't detected, the aloe was degraded during the manufacturing process or the product contains no aloe. He's been making aloe products since 1989. \n\"What you have there is not aloe,'' said Hummeluhr, who reviewed some of the results without being told the name of the brands. \"It could be a lot of water and a little bit of aloe added.'' \nAcemannan is as much as 15 percent of aloe's makeup. Levels below 0.01 percent of dry weight won't register in the tests. Fruit of the Earth's Dondrea declined to say how much aloe is in the firm's gels, citing proprietary formulations. \nAloe vera is a succulent farmed in hot climates like Texas and Mexico. Its spiky leaves contain a clear goo that people have used as a topical ointment to treat burns and other skin problems for millennia. Known as the \"plant of immortality\" in ancient Egypt, it was depicted on stone carvings 6,000 years ago, a burial gift for pharaohs, and it's been used as a folk remedy for conditions from diabetes to epilepsy, according to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health. \nConcerns over imitation aloe aren't new. The industry created the International Aloe Science Council in the 1980s as more and more products hit store shelves that contained little or no aloe, said Wilson, the group's executive director. Maltodextrin, a light-colored powder that looks like aloe powder and is used as a food additive, was a common filler or substitute. Maltodextrin is cheaper than aloe, Wilson said. \nJeff Barrie, a Keene, New Hampshire-based sales manager at AloeCorp, one of the biggest suppliers of raw aloe powder, said he's seen competitors beat his lowest prices by half. That means they're not selling aloe, he said. Aloe powder can cost as much as $240 a kilogram, he said, while the same amount of maltodextrin can cost a few dollars. \nMaking just 1 kilogram of aloe powder, the ingredient used in finished goods like gels and drinks, requires 400 kilos (882 pounds) of aloe leaves, Barrie said. The process involves removing rinds from the leaves and dehydrating the remaining aloe into a powder form. \n\"Aloe is all harvested by hand,\" Barrie said. \"It's an involved process and it's not cheap.\" \nThere's no conclusive body of scientific research affirming aloe's healing properties. While some studies have shown a benefit for burns and cuts, \"there's nothing to hang your hat on\" in terms of clear evidence, partly because there hasn't been enough research, said D. Craig Hopp, a program director at the National Center for Complementary and Integrated Health in Bethesda, Maryland. \n\"There's a lot of people that swear by aloe and love it, and if you put it in your product, you'll sell more of it whether it's a cream or a lotion for sunburns,'' said Gary Shreeve, a vice president of global operations at Scottsdale, Arizona-based Forever Living Products, which sells aloe certified by the International Aloe Science Council. \nSome people are old school about aloe. Rather than buying aloe products, they just keep the succulent around the house. \nMeredith Zielke, a documentary filmmaker in Chicago, is one of many aloe lovers who have a simple remedy. She keeps the plant in her home to cool her skin when her Lyme disease acts up. And it works, she said. \n\"I like just having it at home to snip it from there,\" Zielke said. \"I just like the comfort and the knowledge of having a plant in your house that can actually heal you.\" Authors Information:",

      "text": "No evidence of aloe vera found in the aloe vera at Wal-Mart, CVS, Target Tuesday Nov 22, 2016 at 12:00 PM Lydia Mulvany, Zeke Faux - Bloomberg \nThe aloe vera gel many Americans buy to soothe damaged skin contains no evidence of aloe vera at all. \nSamples of store-brand aloe gel purchased at national retailers Wal-Mart, Target and CVS showed no indication of the plant in various lab tests. The products all listed aloe barbadensis leaf juice - another name for aloe vera - as either the No. 1 ingredient or No. 2 after water. \nThere's no watchdog assuring that aloe products are what they say they are. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration doesn't approve cosmetics before they're sold and has never levied a fine for selling fake aloe. That means suppliers are on an honor system, even as the total U.S. market for aloe products, including drinks and vitamins, has grown 11 percent in the past year to $146 million, according to Chicago-based market researcher SPINS. \n\"You have to be very careful when you select and use aloe products,\" said Tod Cooperman, president of White Plains, New York-based ConsumerLab.com, which has done aloe testing. \nAloe's three chemical markers - acemannan, malic acid and glucose - were absent in the tests for Wal-Mart, Target and CVS products conducted by a lab hired by Bloomberg News. The three samples contained a cheaper element called maltodextrin, a sugar sometimes used to imitate aloe. The gel that's sold at another retailer, Walgreens, contained one marker, malic acid, but not the other two. That means the presence of aloe can't be confirmed or ruled out, said Ken Jones, an independent industry consultant based in Chapala, Mexico. \nTarget declined to comment. Spokesmen for Wal-Mart Stores, CVS Health and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. said their suppliers confirmed to them that their products were authentic. The four retailers have 23,000 outlets between them. \nThe four gels that Bloomberg had analyzed were Wal-Mart's Equate Aloe After Sun Gel with pure aloe vera; Target's Up & Up Aloe Vera Gel with pure aloe vera; CVS Aftersun Aloe Vera Moisturizing Gel; and Walgreens Alcohol Free Aloe Vera Body Gel. The lab that did the testing requested anonymity to preserve its business relationships. \nThe tests used a technique called nuclear magnetic resonance. It found additives such as maltodextrin and other ingredients, like triethanolamine, an emulsifier. In all the samples, lactic acid, a component that indicates degraded aloe vera, was absent. \nFruit of the Earth, a Fort Worth, Texas-based aloe brand founded in 1980, said it made the gels for Wal-Mart, Target and Walgreens. Fruit of the Earth said its aloe supplier was Ormond Beach, Florida-based Concentrated Aloe Corp., which said it uses fair trade, organic aloe that's farmed and processed in Guatemala. \nBoth companies disputed Bloomberg's findings. \n\"We've been in the business a long time and we know where the raw ingredients come from,'' John Dondrea, Fruit of the Earth's general counsel, said in a telephone interview. \"We stand behind our products.'' \nTim Meadows, president of Concentrated Aloe Corp., said that nuclear magnetic resonance isn't reliable for cosmetics because the presence of multiple ingredients can cause interference and there's no way to test for aloe in finished products. He added that maltodextrin isn't an adulterant because it can be used in the drying process, and while some ways of processing aloe remove acemannan, that doesn't mean the aloe isn't real, he said. \n\"Acemannan has been misinterpreted,'' Meadows said. \"The cosmetics industry requires highly processed aloe. How that affects acemannan is anybody's guess.'' \nThough it's true that nuclear magnetic resonance isn't a test that's designed to study aloe vera in cosmetics, the lab results suggest that the plant \"is not a major component\" of the products, said James Neal-Kababick, director of Flora Research Labs in Grants Pass, Oregon, which tests and researches natural products. Jones, the consultant who also reviewed some of the tests, said he didn't see evidence of aloe or interfering substances. \nThe CVS aloe gel was made by Product Quest Manufacturing. The Daytona Beach, Florida-based firm declined to comment or identify its supplier. \nSeveral law firms, including Bloomfield Hills, Michigan-based Barbat, Mansour & Suciu, have filed lawsuits against the four retailers after separate testing failed to find aloe in the companies' private-label products. They're seeking class-action status and restitution for all the customers who they say were misled. \n\"No reasonable person would have purchased or used the products if they knew the products did not contain any aloe vera,'' attorneys wrote in a complaint filed in September in Illinois on behalf of plaintiffs represented by 10 law firms. \nFruit of the Earth, Wal-Mart, Target, CVS and Walgreens denied the allegations. \nIndependently, ConsumerLab.com said it had Fruit of the Earth brand Aloe Vera 100% Gel tested using nuclear magnetic resonance and found no evidence of aloe, while a competing brand, Aubrey Organics, did contain the markers that indicate aloe. ConsumerLab said it tested a dozen aloe products, including pills and juices, and just half the items appeared to meet the claims on their labels. \nAcemannan is thought to give the plant its beneficial properties, said Jane Wilson, executive director of the International Aloe Science Council in Silver Spring, Maryland, which represents the industry. \nJesper Hummeluhr, founder of Copenhagen-based cosmetics maker Aloe Vera Group APS, said that if acemannan isn't detected, the aloe was degraded during the manufacturing process or the product contains no aloe. He's been making aloe products since 1989. \n\"What you have there is not aloe,'' said Hummeluhr, who reviewed some of the results without being told the name of the brands. \"It could be a lot of water and a little bit of aloe added.'' \nAcemannan is as much as 15 percent of aloe's makeup. Levels below 0.01 percent of dry weight won't register in the tests. Fruit of the Earth's Dondrea declined to say how much aloe is in the firm's gels, citing proprietary formulations. \nAloe vera is a succulent farmed in hot climates like Texas and Mexico. Its spiky leaves contain a clear goo that people have used as a topical ointment to treat burns and other skin problems for millennia. Known as the \"plant of immortality\" in ancient Egypt, it was depicted on stone carvings 6,000 years ago, a burial gift for pharaohs, and it's been used as a folk remedy for conditions from diabetes to epilepsy, according to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health. \nConcerns over imitation aloe aren't new. The industry created the International Aloe Science Council in the 1980s as more and more products hit store shelves that contained little or no aloe, said Wilson, the group's executive director. Maltodextrin, a light-colored powder that looks like aloe powder and is used as a food additive, was a common filler or substitute. Maltodextrin is cheaper than aloe, Wilson said. \nJeff Barrie, a Keene, New Hampshire-based sales manager at AloeCorp, one of the biggest suppliers of raw aloe powder, said he's seen competitors beat his lowest prices by half. That means they're not selling aloe, he said. Aloe powder can cost as much as $240 a kilogram, he said, while the same amount of maltodextrin can cost a few dollars. \nMaking just 1 kilogram of aloe powder, the ingredient used in finished goods like gels and drinks, requires 400 kilos (882 pounds) of aloe leaves, Barrie said. The process involves removing rinds from the leaves and dehydrating the remaining aloe into a powder form. \n\"Aloe is all harvested by hand,\" Barrie said. \"It's an involved process and it's not cheap.\" \nThere's no conclusive body of scientific research affirming aloe's healing properties. While some studies have shown a benefit for burns and cuts, \"there's nothing to hang your hat on\" in terms of clear evidence, partly because there hasn't been enough research, said D. Craig Hopp, a program director at the National Center for Complementary and Integrated Health in Bethesda, Maryland. \n\"There's a lot of people that swear by aloe and love it, and if you put it in your product, you'll sell more of it whether it's a cream or a lotion for sunburns,'' said Gary Shreeve, a vice president of global operations at Scottsdale, Arizona-based Forever Living Products, which sells aloe certified by the International Aloe Science Council. \nSome people are old school about aloe. Rather than buying aloe products, they just keep the succulent around the house. \nMeredith Zielke, a documentary filmmaker in Chicago, is one of many aloe lovers who have a simple remedy. She keeps the plant in her home to cool her skin when her Lyme disease acts up. And it works, she said. \n\"I like just having it at home to snip it from there,\" Zielke said. \"I just like the comfort and the knowledge of having a plant in your house that can actually heal you.\" Authors Information:",

      "text": "No evidence of aloe vera found in the aloe vera at Wal-Mart, CVS, Target   12:00 PM Lydia Mulvany, Zeke Faux - Bloomberg \nThe aloe vera gel many Americans buy to soothe damaged skin contains no evidence of aloe vera at all. \nSamples of store-brand aloe gel purchased at national retailers Wal-Mart, Target and CVS showed no indication of the plant in various lab tests. The products all listed aloe barbadensis leaf juice - another name for aloe vera - as either the No. 1 ingredient or No. 2 after water. \nThere's no watchdog assuring that aloe products are what they say they are. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration doesn't approve cosmetics before they're sold and has never levied a fine for selling fake aloe. That means suppliers are on an honor system, even as the total U.S. market for aloe products, including drinks and vitamins, has grown 11 percent in the past year to $146 million, according to Chicago-based market researcher SPINS. \n\"You have to be very careful when you select and use aloe products,\" said Tod Cooperman, president of White Plains, New York-based ConsumerLab.com, which has done aloe testing. \nAloe's three chemical markers - acemannan, malic acid and glucose - were absent in the tests for Wal-Mart, Target and CVS products conducted by a lab hired by Bloomberg News. The three samples contained a cheaper element called maltodextrin, a sugar sometimes used to imitate aloe. The gel that's sold at another retailer, Walgreens, contained one marker, malic acid, but not the other two. That means the presence of aloe can't be confirmed or ruled out, said Ken Jones, an independent industry consultant based in Chapala, Mexico. \nTarget declined to comment. Spokesmen for Wal-Mart Stores, CVS Health and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. said their suppliers confirmed to them that their products were authentic. The four retailers have 23,000 outlets between them. \nThe four gels that Bloomberg had analyzed were Wal-Mart's Equate Aloe After Sun Gel with pure aloe vera; Target's Up & Up Aloe Vera Gel with pure aloe vera; CVS Aftersun Aloe Vera Moisturizing Gel; and Walgreens Alcohol Free Aloe Vera Body Gel. The lab that did the testing requested anonymity to preserve its business relationships. \nThe tests used a technique called nuclear magnetic resonance. It found additives such as maltodextrin and other ingredients, like triethanolamine, an emulsifier. In all the samples, lactic acid, a component that indicates degraded aloe vera, was absent. \nFruit of the Earth, a Fort Worth, Texas-based aloe brand founded in 1980, said it made the gels for Wal-Mart, Target and Walgreens. Fruit of the Earth said its aloe supplier was Ormond Beach, Florida-based Concentrated Aloe Corp., which said it uses fair trade, organic aloe that's farmed and processed in Guatemala. \nBoth companies disputed Bloomberg's findings. \n\"We've been in the business a long time and we know where the raw ingredients come from,'' John Dondrea, Fruit of the Earth's general counsel, said in a telephone interview. \"We stand behind our products.'' \nTim Meadows, president of Concentrated Aloe Corp., said that nuclear magnetic resonance isn't reliable for cosmetics because the presence of multiple ingredients can cause interference and there's no way to test for aloe in finished products. He added that maltodextrin isn't an adulterant because it can be used in the drying process, and while some ways of processing aloe remove acemannan, that doesn't mean the aloe isn't real, he said. \n\"Acemannan has been misinterpreted,'' Meadows said. \"The cosmetics industry requires highly processed aloe. How that affects acemannan is anybody's guess.'' \nThough it's true that nuclear magnetic resonance isn't a test that's designed to study aloe vera in cosmetics, the lab results suggest that the plant \"is not a major component\" of the products, said James Neal-Kababick, director of Flora Research Labs in Grants Pass, Oregon, which tests and researches natural products. Jones, the consultant who also reviewed some of the tests, said he didn't see evidence of aloe or interfering substances. \nThe CVS aloe gel was made by Product Quest Manufacturing. The Daytona Beach, Florida-based firm declined to comment or identify its supplier. \nSeveral law firms, including Bloomfield Hills, Michigan-based Barbat, Mansour & Suciu, have filed lawsuits against the four retailers after separate testing failed to find aloe in the companies' private-label products. They're seeking class-action status and restitution for all the customers who they say were misled. \n\"No reasonable person would have purchased or used the products if they knew the products did not contain any aloe vera,'' attorneys wrote in a complaint filed in September in Illinois on behalf of plaintiffs represented by 10 law firms. \nFruit of the Earth, Wal-Mart, Target, CVS and Walgreens denied the allegations. \nIndependently, ConsumerLab.com said it had Fruit of the Earth brand Aloe Vera 100% Gel tested using nuclear magnetic resonance and found no evidence of aloe, while a competing brand, Aubrey Organics, did contain the markers that indicate aloe. ConsumerLab said it tested a dozen aloe products, including pills and juices, and just half the items appeared to meet the claims on their labels. \nAcemannan is thought to give the plant its beneficial properties, said Jane Wilson, executive director of the International Aloe Science Council in Silver Spring, Maryland, which represents the industry. \nJesper Hummeluhr, founder of Copenhagen-based cosmetics maker Aloe Vera Group APS, said that if acemannan isn't detected, the aloe was degraded during the manufacturing process or the product contains no aloe. He's been making aloe products since 1989. \n\"What you have there is not aloe,'' said Hummeluhr, who reviewed some of the results without being told the name of the brands. \"It could be a lot of water and a little bit of aloe added.'' \nAcemannan is as much as 15 percent of aloe's makeup. Levels below 0.01 percent of dry weight won't register in the tests. Fruit of the Earth's Dondrea declined to say how much aloe is in the firm's gels, citing proprietary formulations. \nAloe vera is a succulent farmed in hot climates like Texas and Mexico. Its spiky leaves contain a clear goo that people have used as a topical ointment to treat burns and other skin problems for millennia. Known as the \"plant of immortality\" in ancient Egypt, it was depicted on stone carvings 6,000 years ago, a burial gift for pharaohs, and it's been used as a folk remedy for conditions from diabetes to epilepsy, according to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health. \nConcerns over imitation aloe aren't new. The industry created the International Aloe Science Council in the 1980s as more and more products hit store shelves that contained little or no aloe, said Wilson, the group's executive director. Maltodextrin, a light-colored powder that looks like aloe powder and is used as a food additive, was a common filler or substitute. Maltodextrin is cheaper than aloe, Wilson said. \nJeff Barrie, a Keene, New Hampshire-based sales manager at AloeCorp, one of the biggest suppliers of raw aloe powder, said he's seen competitors beat his lowest prices by half. That means they're not selling aloe, he said. Aloe powder can cost as much as $240 a kilogram, he said, while the same amount of maltodextrin can cost a few dollars. \nMaking just 1 kilogram of aloe powder, the ingredient used in finished goods like gels and drinks, requires 400 kilos (882 pounds) of aloe leaves, Barrie said. The process involves removing rinds from the leaves and dehydrating the remaining aloe into a powder form. \n\"Aloe is all harvested by hand,\" Barrie said. \"It's an involved process and it's not cheap.\" \nThere's no conclusive body of scientific research affirming aloe's healing properties. While some studies have shown a benefit for burns and cuts, \"there's nothing to hang your hat on\" in terms of clear evidence, partly because there hasn't been enough research, said D. Craig Hopp, a program director at the National Center for Complementary and Integrated Health in Bethesda, Maryland. \n\"There's a lot of people that swear by aloe and love it, and if you put it in your product, you'll sell more of it whether it's a cream or a lotion for sunburns,'' said Gary Shreeve, a vice president of global operations at Scottsdale, Arizona-based Forever Living Products, which sells aloe certified by the International Aloe Science Council. \nSome people are old school about aloe. Rather than buying aloe products, they just keep the succulent around the house. \nMeredith Zielke, a documentary filmmaker in Chicago, is one of many aloe lovers who have a simple remedy. She keeps the plant in her home to cool her skin when her Lyme disease acts up. And it works, she said. \n\"I like just having it at home to snip it from there,\" Zielke said. \"I just like the comfort and the knowledge of having a plant in your house that can actually heal you.\" Authors Information:",

      "text": "No evidence of aloe vera found in the aloe vera at Wal-Mart, CVS, Target   12:00 PM Lydia Mulvany, Zeke Faux - Bloomberg \nThe aloe vera gel many Americans buy to soothe damaged skin contains no evidence of aloe vera at all. \nSamples of store-brand aloe gel purchased at national retailers Wal-Mart, Target and CVS showed no indication of the plant in various lab tests. The products all listed aloe barbadensis leaf juice - another name for aloe vera - as either the No. 1 ingredient or No. 2 after water. \nThere's no watchdog assuring that aloe products are what they say they are. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration doesn't approve cosmetics before they're sold and has never levied a fine for selling fake aloe. That means suppliers are on an honor system, even as the total U.S. market for aloe products, including drinks and vitamins, has grown 11 percent in the past year to $146 million, according to Chicago-based market researcher SPINS. \n\"You have to be very careful when you select and use aloe products,\" said Tod Cooperman, president of White Plains, New York-based ConsumerLab.com, which has done aloe testing. \nAloe's three chemical markers - acemannan, malic acid and glucose - were absent in the tests for Wal-Mart, Target and CVS products conducted by a lab hired by Bloomberg News. The three samples contained a cheaper element called maltodextrin, a sugar sometimes used to imitate aloe. The gel that's sold at another retailer, Walgreens, contained one marker, malic acid, but not the other two. That means the presence of aloe can't be confirmed or ruled out, said Ken Jones, an independent industry consultant based in Chapala, Mexico. \nTarget declined to comment. Spokesmen for Wal-Mart Stores, CVS Health and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. said their suppliers confirmed to them that their products were authentic. The four retailers have 23,000 outlets between them. \nThe four gels that Bloomberg had analyzed were Wal-Mart's Equate Aloe After Sun Gel with pure aloe vera; Target's Up & Up Aloe Vera Gel with pure aloe vera; CVS Aftersun Aloe Vera Moisturizing Gel; and Walgreens Alcohol Free Aloe Vera Body Gel. The lab that did the testing requested anonymity to preserve its business relationships. \nThe tests used a technique called nuclear magnetic resonance. It found additives such as maltodextrin and other ingredients, like triethanolamine, an emulsifier. In all the samples, lactic acid, a component that indicates degraded aloe vera, was absent. \nFruit of the Earth, a Fort Worth, Texas-based aloe brand founded in 1980, said it made the gels for Wal-Mart, Target and Walgreens. Fruit of the Earth said its aloe supplier was Ormond Beach, Florida-based Concentrated Aloe Corp., which said it uses fair trade, organic aloe that's farmed and processed in Guatemala. \nBoth companies disputed Bloomberg's findings. \n\"We've been in the business a long time and we know where the raw ingredients come from,'' John Dondrea, Fruit of the Earth's general counsel, said in a telephone interview. \"We stand behind our products.'' \nTim Meadows, president of Concentrated Aloe Corp., said that nuclear magnetic resonance isn't reliable for cosmetics because the presence of multiple ingredients can cause interference and there's no way to test for aloe in finished products. He added that maltodextrin isn't an adulterant because it can be used in the drying process, and while some ways of processing aloe remove acemannan, that doesn't mean the aloe isn't real, he said. \n\"Acemannan has been misinterpreted,'' Meadows said. \"The cosmetics industry requires highly processed aloe. How that affects acemannan is anybody's guess.'' \nThough it's true that nuclear magnetic resonance isn't a test that's designed to study aloe vera in cosmetics, the lab results suggest that the plant \"is not a major component\" of the products, said James Neal-Kababick, director of Flora Research Labs in Grants Pass, Oregon, which tests and researches natural products. Jones, the consultant who also reviewed some of the tests, said he didn't see evidence of aloe or interfering substances. \nThe CVS aloe gel was made by Product Quest Manufacturing. The Daytona Beach, Florida-based firm declined to comment or identify its supplier. \nSeveral law firms, including Bloomfield Hills, Michigan-based Barbat, Mansour & Suciu, have filed lawsuits against the four retailers after separate testing failed to find aloe in the companies' private-label products. They're seeking class-action status and restitution for all the customers who they say were misled. \n\"No reasonable person would have purchased or used the products if they knew the products did not contain any aloe vera,'' attorneys wrote in a complaint filed in September in Illinois on behalf of plaintiffs represented by 10 law firms. \nFruit of the Earth, Wal-Mart, Target, CVS and Walgreens denied the allegations. \nIndependently, ConsumerLab.com said it had Fruit of the Earth brand Aloe Vera 100% Gel tested using nuclear magnetic resonance and found no evidence of aloe, while a competing brand, Aubrey Organics, did contain the markers that indicate aloe. ConsumerLab said it tested a dozen aloe products, including pills and juices, and just half the items appeared to meet the claims on their labels. \nAcemannan is thought to give the plant its beneficial properties, said Jane Wilson, executive director of the International Aloe Science Council in Silver Spring, Maryland, which represents the industry. \nJesper Hummeluhr, founder of Copenhagen-based cosmetics maker Aloe Vera Group APS, said that if acemannan isn't detected, the aloe was degraded during the manufacturing process or the product contains no aloe. He's been making aloe products since 1989. \n\"What you have there is not aloe,'' said Hummeluhr, who reviewed some of the results without being told the name of the brands. \"It could be a lot of water and a little bit of aloe added.'' \nAcemannan is as much as 15 percent of aloe's makeup. Levels below 0.01 percent of dry weight won't register in the tests. Fruit of the Earth's Dondrea declined to say how much aloe is in the firm's gels, citing proprietary formulations. \nAloe vera is a succulent farmed in hot climates like Texas and Mexico. Its spiky leaves contain a clear goo that people have used as a topical ointment to treat burns and other skin problems for millennia. Known as the \"plant of immortality\" in ancient Egypt, it was depicted on stone carvings 6,000 years ago, a burial gift for pharaohs, and it's been used as a folk remedy for conditions from diabetes to epilepsy, according to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health. \nConcerns over imitation aloe aren't new. The industry created the International Aloe Science Council in the 1980s as more and more products hit store shelves that contained little or no aloe, said Wilson, the group's executive director. Maltodextrin, a light-colored powder that looks like aloe powder and is used as a food additive, was a common filler or substitute. Maltodextrin is cheaper than aloe, Wilson said. \nJeff Barrie, a Keene, New Hampshire-based sales manager at AloeCorp, one of the biggest suppliers of raw aloe powder, said he's seen competitors beat his lowest prices by half. That means they're not selling aloe, he said. Aloe powder can cost as much as $240 a kilogram, he said, while the same amount of maltodextrin can cost a few dollars. \nMaking just 1 kilogram of aloe powder, the ingredient used in finished goods like gels and drinks, requires 400 kilos (882 pounds) of aloe leaves, Barrie said. The process involves removing rinds from the leaves and dehydrating the remaining aloe into a powder form. \n\"Aloe is all harvested by hand,\" Barrie said. \"It's an involved process and it's not cheap.\" \nThere's no conclusive body of scientific research affirming aloe's healing properties. While some studies have shown a benefit for burns and cuts, \"there's nothing to hang your hat on\" in terms of clear evidence, partly because there hasn't been enough research, said D. Craig Hopp, a program director at the National Center for Complementary and Integrated Health in Bethesda, Maryland. \n\"There's a lot of people that swear by aloe and love it, and if you put it in your product, you'll sell more of it whether it's a cream or a lotion for sunburns,'' said Gary Shreeve, a vice president of global operations at Scottsdale, Arizona-based Forever Living Products, which sells aloe certified by the International Aloe Science Council. \nSome people are old school about aloe. Rather than buying aloe products, they just keep the succulent around the house. \nMeredith Zielke, a documentary filmmaker in Chicago, is one of many aloe lovers who have a simple remedy. She keeps the plant in her home to cool her skin when her Lyme disease acts up. And it works, she said. \n\"I like just having it at home to snip it from there,\" Zielke said. \"I just like the comfort and the knowledge of having a plant in your house that can actually heal you.\" Authors Information:",

      "text": "No evidence of aloe vera found in the aloe vera at Wal-Mart, CVS, Target   12:00 PM Lydia Mulvany, Zeke Faux - Bloomberg \nThe aloe vera gel many Americans buy to soothe damaged skin contains no evidence of aloe vera at all. \nSamples of store-brand aloe gel purchased at national retailers Wal-Mart, Target and CVS showed no indication of the plant in various lab tests. The products all listed aloe barbadensis leaf juice - another name for aloe vera - as either the No. 1 ingredient or No. 2 after water. \nThere's no watchdog assuring that aloe products are what they say they are. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration doesn't approve cosmetics before they're sold and has never levied a fine for selling fake aloe. That means suppliers are on an honor system, even as the total U.S. market for aloe products, including drinks and vitamins, has grown 11 percent in the past year to $146 million, according to Chicago-based market researcher SPINS. \n\"You have to be very careful when you select and use aloe products,\" said Tod Cooperman, president of White Plains, New York-based ConsumerLab.com, which has done aloe testing. \nAloe's three chemical markers - acemannan, malic acid and glucose - were absent in the tests for Wal-Mart, Target and CVS products conducted by a lab hired by Bloomberg News. The three samples contained a cheaper element called maltodextrin, a sugar sometimes used to imitate aloe. The gel that's sold at another retailer, Walgreens, contained one marker, malic acid, but not the other two. That means the presence of aloe can't be confirmed or ruled out, said Ken Jones, an independent industry consultant based in Chapala, Mexico. \nTarget declined to comment. Spokesmen for Wal-Mart Stores, CVS Health and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. said their suppliers confirmed to them that their products were authentic. The four retailers have 23,000 outlets between them. \nThe four gels that Bloomberg had analyzed were Wal-Mart's Equate Aloe After Sun Gel with pure aloe vera; Target's Up & Up Aloe Vera Gel with pure aloe vera; CVS Aftersun Aloe Vera Moisturizing Gel; and Walgreens Alcohol Free Aloe Vera Body Gel. The lab that did the testing requested anonymity to preserve its business relationships. \nThe tests used a technique called nuclear magnetic resonance. It found additives such as maltodextrin and other ingredients, like triethanolamine, an emulsifier. In all the samples, lactic acid, a component that indicates degraded aloe vera, was absent. \nFruit of the Earth, a Fort Worth, Texas-based aloe brand founded in 1980, said it made the gels for Wal-Mart, Target and Walgreens. Fruit of the Earth said its aloe supplier was Ormond Beach, Florida-based Concentrated Aloe Corp., which said it uses fair trade, organic aloe that's farmed and processed in Guatemala. \nBoth companies disputed Bloomberg's findings. \n\"We've been in the business a long time and we know where the raw ingredients come from,'' John Dondrea, Fruit of the Earth's general counsel, said in a telephone interview. \"We stand behind our products.'' \nTim Meadows, president of Concentrated Aloe Corp., said that nuclear magnetic resonance isn't reliable for cosmetics because the presence of multiple ingredients can cause interference and there's no way to test for aloe in finished products. He added that maltodextrin isn't an adulterant because it can be used in the drying process, and while some ways of processing aloe remove acemannan, that doesn't mean the aloe isn't real, he said. \n\"Acemannan has been misinterpreted,'' Meadows said. \"The cosmetics industry requires highly processed aloe. How that affects acemannan is anybody's guess.'' \nThough it's true that nuclear magnetic resonance isn't a test that's designed to study aloe vera in cosmetics, the lab results suggest that the plant \"is not a major component\" of the products, said James Neal-Kababick, director of Flora Research Labs in Grants Pass, Oregon, which tests and researches natural products. Jones, the consultant who also reviewed some of the tests, said he didn't see evidence of aloe or interfering substances. \nThe CVS aloe gel was made by Product Quest Manufacturing. The Daytona Beach, Florida-based firm declined to comment or identify its supplier. \nSeveral law firms, including Bloomfield Hills, Michigan-based Barbat, Mansour & Suciu, have filed lawsuits against the four retailers after separate testing failed to find aloe in the companies' private-label products. They're seeking class-action status and restitution for all the customers who they say were misled. \n\"No reasonable person would have purchased or used the products if they knew the products did not contain any aloe vera,'' attorneys wrote in a complaint filed in September in Illinois on behalf of plaintiffs represented by 10 law firms. \nFruit of the Earth, Wal-Mart, Target, CVS and Walgreens denied the allegations. \nIndependently, ConsumerLab.com said it had Fruit of the Earth brand Aloe Vera 100% Gel tested using nuclear magnetic resonance and found no evidence of aloe, while a competing brand, Aubrey Organics, did contain the markers that indicate aloe. ConsumerLab said it tested a dozen aloe products, including pills and juices, and just half the items appeared to meet the claims on their labels. \nAcemannan is thought to give the plant its beneficial properties, said Jane Wilson, executive director of the International Aloe Science Council in Silver Spring, Maryland, which represents the industry. \nJesper Hummeluhr, founder of Copenhagen-based cosmetics maker Aloe Vera Group APS, said that if acemannan isn't detected, the aloe was degraded during the manufacturing process or the product contains no aloe. He's been making aloe products since 1989. \n\"What you have there is not aloe,'' said Hummeluhr, who reviewed some of the results without being told the name of the brands. \"It could be a lot of water and a little bit of aloe added.'' \nAcemannan is as much as 15 percent of aloe's makeup. Levels below 0.01 percent of dry weight won't register in the tests. Fruit of the Earth's Dondrea declined to say how much aloe is in the firm's gels, citing proprietary formulations. \nAloe vera is a succulent farmed in hot climates like Texas and Mexico. Its spiky leaves contain a clear goo that people have used as a topical ointment to treat burns and other skin problems for millennia. Known as the \"plant of immortality\" in ancient Egypt, it was depicted on stone carvings 6,000 years ago, a burial gift for pharaohs, and it's been used as a folk remedy for conditions from diabetes to epilepsy, according to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health. \nConcerns over imitation aloe aren't new. The industry created the International Aloe Science Council in the 1980s as more and more products hit store shelves that contained little or no aloe, said Wilson, the group's executive director. Maltodextrin, a light-colored powder that looks like aloe powder and is used as a food additive, was a common filler or substitute. Maltodextrin is cheaper than aloe, Wilson said. \nJeff Barrie, a Keene, New Hampshire-based sales manager at AloeCorp, one of the biggest suppliers of raw aloe powder, said he's seen competitors beat his lowest prices by half. That means they're not selling aloe, he said. Aloe powder can cost as much as $240 a kilogram, he said, while the same amount of maltodextrin can cost a few dollars. \nMaking just 1 kilogram of aloe powder, the ingredient used in finished goods like gels and drinks, requires 400 kilos (882 pounds) of aloe leaves, Barrie said. The process involves removing rinds from the leaves and dehydrating the remaining aloe into a powder form. \n\"Aloe is all harvested by hand,\" Barrie said. \"It's an involved process and it's not cheap.\" \nThere's no conclusive body of scientific research affirming aloe's healing properties. While some studies have shown a benefit for burns and cuts, \"there's nothing to hang your hat on\" in terms of clear evidence, partly because there hasn't been enough research, said D. Craig Hopp, a program director at the National Center for Complementary and Integrated Health in Bethesda, Maryland. \n\"There's a lot of people that swear by aloe and love it, and if you put it in your product, you'll sell more of it whether it's a cream or a lotion for sunburns,'' said Gary Shreeve, a vice president of global operations at Scottsdale, Arizona-based Forever Living Products, which sells aloe certified by the International Aloe Science Council. \nSome people are old school about aloe. Rather than buying aloe products, they just keep the succulent around the house. \nMeredith Zielke, a documentary filmmaker in Chicago, is one of many aloe lovers who have a simple remedy. She keeps the plant in her home to cool her skin when her Lyme disease acts up. And it works, she said. \n\"I like just having it at home to snip it from there,\" Zielke said. \"I just like the comfort and the knowledge of having a plant in your house that can actually heal you.\" Authors Information:",

      "text": "No evidence of aloe vera found in the aloe vera at Wal-Mart, CVS, Target  00 PM Lydia Mulvany, Zeke Faux - Bloomberg \nThe aloe vera gel many Americans buy to soothe damaged skin contains no evidence of aloe vera at all. \nSamples of store-brand aloe gel purchased at national retailers Wal-Mart, Target and CVS showed no indication of the plant in various lab tests. The products all listed aloe barbadensis leaf juice - another name for aloe vera - as either the No. 1 ingredient or No. 2 after water. \nThere's no watchdog assuring that aloe products are what they say they are. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration doesn't approve cosmetics before they're sold and has never levied a fine for selling fake aloe. That means suppliers are on an honor system, even as the total U.S. market for aloe products, including drinks and vitamins, has grown 11 percent in the past year to $146 million, according to Chicago-based market researcher SPINS. \n\"You have to be very careful when you select and use aloe products,\" said Tod Cooperman, president of White Plains, New York-based ConsumerLab.com, which has done aloe testing. \nAloe's three chemical markers - acemannan, malic acid and glucose - were absent in the tests for Wal-Mart, Target and CVS products conducted by a lab hired by Bloomberg News. The three samples contained a cheaper element called maltodextrin, a sugar sometimes used to imitate aloe. The gel that's sold at another retailer, Walgreens, contained one marker, malic acid, but not the other two. That means the presence of aloe can't be confirmed or ruled out, said Ken Jones, an independent industry consultant based in Chapala, Mexico. \nTarget declined to comment. Spokesmen for Wal-Mart Stores, CVS Health and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. said their suppliers confirmed to them that their products were authentic. The four retailers have 23,000 outlets between them. \nThe four gels that Bloomberg had analyzed were Wal-Mart's Equate Aloe After Sun Gel with pure aloe vera; Target's Up & Up Aloe Vera Gel with pure aloe vera; CVS Aftersun Aloe Vera Moisturizing Gel; and Walgreens Alcohol Free Aloe Vera Body Gel. The lab that did the testing requested anonymity to preserve its business relationships. \nThe tests used a technique called nuclear magnetic resonance. It found additives such as maltodextrin and other ingredients, like triethanolamine, an emulsifier. In all the samples, lactic acid, a component that indicates degraded aloe vera, was absent. \nFruit of the Earth, a Fort Worth, Texas-based aloe brand founded in 1980, said it made the gels for Wal-Mart, Target and Walgreens. Fruit of the Earth said its aloe supplier was Ormond Beach, Florida-based Concentrated Aloe Corp., which said it uses fair trade, organic aloe that's farmed and processed in Guatemala. \nBoth companies disputed Bloomberg's findings. \n\"We've been in the business a long time and we know where the raw ingredients come from,'' John Dondrea, Fruit of the Earth's general counsel, said in a telephone interview. \"We stand behind our products.'' \nTim Meadows, president of Concentrated Aloe Corp., said that nuclear magnetic resonance isn't reliable for cosmetics because the presence of multiple ingredients can cause interference and there's no way to test for aloe in finished products. He added that maltodextrin isn't an adulterant because it can be used in the drying process, and while some ways of processing aloe remove acemannan, that doesn't mean the aloe isn't real, he said. \n\"Acemannan has been misinterpreted,'' Meadows said. \"The cosmetics industry requires highly processed aloe. How that affects acemannan is anybody's guess.'' \nThough it's true that nuclear magnetic resonance isn't a test that's designed to study aloe vera in cosmetics, the lab results suggest that the plant \"is not a major component\" of the products, said James Neal-Kababick, director of Flora Research Labs in Grants Pass, Oregon, which tests and researches natural products. Jones, the consultant who also reviewed some of the tests, said he didn't see evidence of aloe or interfering substances. \nThe CVS aloe gel was made by Product Quest Manufacturing. The Daytona Beach, Florida-based firm declined to comment or identify its supplier. \nSeveral law firms, including Bloomfield Hills, Michigan-based Barbat, Mansour & Suciu, have filed lawsuits against the four retailers after separate testing failed to find aloe in the companies' private-label products. They're seeking class-action status and restitution for all the customers who they say were misled. \n\"No reasonable person would have purchased or used the products if they knew the products did not contain any aloe vera,'' attorneys wrote in a complaint filed in September in Illinois on behalf of plaintiffs represented by 10 law firms. \nFruit of the Earth, Wal-Mart, Target, CVS and Walgreens denied the allegations. \nIndependently, ConsumerLab.com said it had Fruit of the Earth brand Aloe Vera 100% Gel tested using nuclear magnetic resonance and found no evidence of aloe, while a competing brand, Aubrey Organics, did contain the markers that indicate aloe. ConsumerLab said it tested a dozen aloe products, including pills and juices, and just half the items appeared to meet the claims on their labels. \nAcemannan is thought to give the plant its beneficial properties, said Jane Wilson, executive director of the International Aloe Science Council in Silver Spring, Maryland, which represents the industry. \nJesper Hummeluhr, founder of Copenhagen-based cosmetics maker Aloe Vera Group APS, said that if acemannan isn't detected, the aloe was degraded during the manufacturing process or the product contains no aloe. He's been making aloe products since 1989. \n\"What you have there is not aloe,'' said Hummeluhr, who reviewed some of the results without being told the name of the brands. \"It could be a lot of water and a little bit of aloe added.'' \nAcemannan is as much as 15 percent of aloe's makeup. Levels below 0.01 percent of dry weight won't register in the tests. Fruit of the Earth's Dondrea declined to say how much aloe is in the firm's gels, citing proprietary formulations. \nAloe vera is a succulent farmed in hot climates like Texas and Mexico. Its spiky leaves contain a clear goo that people have used as a topical ointment to treat burns and other skin problems for millennia. Known as the \"plant of immortality\" in ancient Egypt, it was depicted on stone carvings 6,000 years ago, a burial gift for pharaohs, and it's been used as a folk remedy for conditions from diabetes to epilepsy, according to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health. \nConcerns over imitation aloe aren't new. The industry created the International Aloe Science Council in the 1980s as more and more products hit store shelves that contained little or no aloe, said Wilson, the group's executive director. Maltodextrin, a light-colored powder that looks like aloe powder and is used as a food additive, was a common filler or substitute. Maltodextrin is cheaper than aloe, Wilson said. \nJeff Barrie, a Keene, New Hampshire-based sales manager at AloeCorp, one of the biggest suppliers of raw aloe powder, said he's seen competitors beat his lowest prices by half. That means they're not selling aloe, he said. Aloe powder can cost as much as $240 a kilogram, he said, while the same amount of maltodextrin can cost a few dollars. \nMaking just 1 kilogram of aloe powder, the ingredient used in finished goods like gels and drinks, requires 400 kilos (882 pounds) of aloe leaves, Barrie said. The process involves removing rinds from the leaves and dehydrating the remaining aloe into a powder form. \n\"Aloe is all harvested by hand,\" Barrie said. \"It's an involved process and it's not cheap.\" \nThere's no conclusive body of scientific research affirming aloe's healing properties. While some studies have shown a benefit for burns and cuts, \"there's nothing to hang your hat on\" in terms of clear evidence, partly because there hasn't been enough research, said D. Craig Hopp, a program director at the National Center for Complementary and Integrated Health in Bethesda, Maryland. \n\"There's a lot of people that swear by aloe and love it, and if you put it in your product, you'll sell more of it whether it's a cream or a lotion for sunburns,'' said Gary Shreeve, a vice president of global operations at Scottsdale, Arizona-based Forever Living Products, which sells aloe certified by the International Aloe Science Council. \nSome people are old school about aloe. Rather than buying aloe products, they just keep the succulent around the house. \nMeredith Zielke, a documentary filmmaker in Chicago, is one of many aloe lovers who have a simple remedy. She keeps the plant in her home to cool her skin when her Lyme disease acts up. And it works, she said. \n\"I like just having it at home to snip it from there,\" Zielke said. \"I just like the comfort and the knowledge of having a plant in your house that can actually heal you.\" Authors Information:",

      "text": "No evidence of aloe vera found in the aloe vera at Wal-Mart, CVS, Target   12:00 PM Lydia Mulvany, Zeke Faux - Bloomberg \nThe aloe vera gel many Americans buy to soothe damaged skin contains no evidence of aloe vera at all. \nSamples of store-brand aloe gel purchased at national retailers Wal-Mart, Target and CVS showed no indication of the plant in various lab tests. The products all listed aloe barbadensis leaf juice - another name for aloe vera - as either the No. 1 ingredient or No. 2 after water. \nThere's no watchdog assuring that aloe products are what they say they are. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration doesn't approve cosmetics before they're sold and has never levied a fine for selling fake aloe. That means suppliers are on an honor system, even as the total U.S. market for aloe products, including drinks and vitamins, has grown 11 percent in the past year to $146 million, according to Chicago-based market researcher SPINS. \n\"You have to be very careful when you select and use aloe products,\" said Tod Cooperman, president of White Plains, New York-based ConsumerLab.com, which has done aloe testing. \nAloe's three chemical markers - acemannan, malic acid and glucose - were absent in the tests for Wal-Mart, Target and CVS products conducted by a lab hired by Bloomberg News. The three samples contained a cheaper element called maltodextrin, a sugar sometimes used to imitate aloe. The gel that's sold at another retailer, Walgreens, contained one marker, malic acid, but not the other two. That means the presence of aloe can't be confirmed or ruled out, said Ken Jones, an independent industry consultant based in Chapala, Mexico. \nTarget declined to comment. Spokesmen for Wal-Mart Stores, CVS Health and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. said their suppliers confirmed to them that their products were authentic. The four retailers have 23,000 outlets between them. \nThe four gels that Bloomberg had analyzed were Wal-Mart's Equate Aloe After Sun Gel with pure aloe vera; Target's Up & Up Aloe Vera Gel with pure aloe vera; CVS Aftersun Aloe Vera Moisturizing Gel; and Walgreens Alcohol Free Aloe Vera Body Gel. The lab that did the testing requested anonymity to preserve its business relationships. \nThe tests used a technique called nuclear magnetic resonance. It found additives such as maltodextrin and other ingredients, like triethanolamine, an emulsifier. In all the samples, lactic acid, a component that indicates degraded aloe vera, was absent. \nFruit of the Earth, a Fort Worth, Texas-based aloe brand founded in 1980, said it made the gels for Wal-Mart, Target and Walgreens. Fruit of the Earth said its aloe supplier was Ormond Beach, Florida-based Concentrated Aloe Corp., which said it uses fair trade, organic aloe that's farmed and processed in Guatemala. \nBoth companies disputed Bloomberg's findings. \n\"We've been in the business a long time and we know where the raw ingredients come from,'' John Dondrea, Fruit of the Earth's general counsel, said in a telephone interview. \"We stand behind our products.'' \nTim Meadows, president of Concentrated Aloe Corp., said that nuclear magnetic resonance isn't reliable for cosmetics because the presence of multiple ingredients can cause interference and there's no way to test for aloe in finished products. He added that maltodextrin isn't an adulterant because it can be used in the drying process, and while some ways of processing aloe remove acemannan, that doesn't mean the aloe isn't real, he said. \n\"Acemannan has been misinterpreted,'' Meadows said. \"The cosmetics industry requires highly processed aloe. How that affects acemannan is anybody's guess.'' \nThough it's true that nuclear magnetic resonance isn't a test that's designed to study aloe vera in cosmetics, the lab results suggest that the plant \"is not a major component\" of the products, said James Neal-Kababick, director of Flora Research Labs in Grants Pass, Oregon, which tests and researches natural products. Jones, the consultant who also reviewed some of the tests, said he didn't see evidence of aloe or interfering substances. \nThe CVS aloe gel was made by Product Quest Manufacturing. The Daytona Beach, Florida-based firm declined to comment or identify its supplier. \nSeveral law firms, including Bloomfield Hills, Michigan-based Barbat, Mansour & Suciu, have filed lawsuits against the four retailers after separate testing failed to find aloe in the companies' private-label products. They're seeking class-action status and restitution for all the customers who they say were misled. \n\"No reasonable person would have purchased or used the products if they knew the products did not contain any aloe vera,'' attorneys wrote in a complaint filed in September in Illinois on behalf of plaintiffs represented by 10 law firms. \nFruit of the Earth, Wal-Mart, Target, CVS and Walgreens denied the allegations. \nIndependently, ConsumerLab.com said it had Fruit of the Earth brand Aloe Vera 100% Gel tested using nuclear magnetic resonance and found no evidence of aloe, while a competing brand, Aubrey Organics, did contain the markers that indicate aloe. ConsumerLab said it tested a dozen aloe products, including pills and juices, and just half the items appeared to meet the claims on their labels. \nAcemannan is thought to give the plant its beneficial properties, said Jane Wilson, executive director of the International Aloe Science Council in Silver Spring, Maryland, which represents the industry. \nJesper Hummeluhr, founder of Copenhagen-based cosmetics maker Aloe Vera Group APS, said that if acemannan isn't detected, the aloe was degraded during the manufacturing process or the product contains no aloe. He's been making aloe products since 1989. \n\"What you have there is not aloe,'' said Hummeluhr, who reviewed some of the results without being told the name of the brands. \"It could be a lot of water and a little bit of aloe added.'' \nAcemannan is as much as 15 percent of aloe's makeup. Levels below 0.01 percent of dry weight won't register in the tests. Fruit of the Earth's Dondrea declined to say how much aloe is in the firm's gels, citing proprietary formulations. \nAloe vera is a succulent farmed in hot climates like Texas and Mexico. Its spiky leaves contain a clear goo that people have used as a topical ointment to treat burns and other skin problems for millennia. Known as the \"plant of immortality\" in ancient Egypt, it was depicted on stone carvings 6,000 years ago, a burial gift for pharaohs, and it's been used as a folk remedy for conditions from diabetes to epilepsy, according to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health. \nConcerns over imitation aloe aren't new. The industry created the International Aloe Science Council in the 1980s as more and more products hit store shelves that contained little or no aloe, said Wilson, the group's executive director. Maltodextrin, a light-colored powder that looks like aloe powder and is used as a food additive, was a common filler or substitute. Maltodextrin is cheaper than aloe, Wilson said. \nJeff Barrie, a Keene, New Hampshire-based sales manager at AloeCorp, one of the biggest suppliers of raw aloe powder, said he's seen competitors beat his lowest prices by half. That means they're not selling aloe, he said. Aloe powder can cost as much as $240 a kilogram, he said, while the same amount of maltodextrin can cost a few dollars. \nMaking just 1 kilogram of aloe powder, the ingredient used in finished goods like gels and drinks, requires 400 kilos (882 pounds) of aloe leaves, Barrie said. The process involves removing rinds from the leaves and dehydrating the remaining aloe into a powder form. \n\"Aloe is all harvested by hand,\" Barrie said. \"It's an involved process and it's not cheap.\" \nThere's no conclusive body of scientific research affirming aloe's healing properties. While some studies have shown a benefit for burns and cuts, \"there's nothing to hang your hat on\" in terms of clear evidence, partly because there hasn't been enough research, said D. Craig Hopp, a program director at the National Center for Complementary and Integrated Health in Bethesda, Maryland. \n\"There's a lot of people that swear by aloe and love it, and if you put it in your product, you'll sell more of it whether it's a cream or a lotion for sunburns,'' said Gary Shreeve, a vice president of global operations at Scottsdale, Arizona-based Forever Living Products, which sells aloe certified by the International Aloe Science Council. \nSome people are old school about aloe. Rather than buying aloe products, they just keep the succulent around the house. \nMeredith Zielke, a documentary filmmaker in Chicago, is one of many aloe lovers who have a simple remedy. She keeps the plant in her home to cool her skin when her Lyme disease acts up. And it works, she said. \n\"I like just having it at home to snip it from there,\" Zielke said. \"I just like the comfort and the knowledge of having a plant in your house that can actually heal you.\" Authors Information:",

      "title": "These products claim to contain aloe vera — they don’t",
      "text": "Skin gels said to contain aloe vera at Walmart, Target, and CVS were found to have no evidence of the plant, according to a Bloomberg News investigation . The store-brand products were tested in a lab for aloe’s chemical markers; the chemicals were absent, indicating that no actual aloe plant is in the skin gels.\nAloe vera is a plant that’s been used for medicinal purposes for thousands of years . Today, aloe is used in products purporting to treat skin burns and cold sores, as well as constipation, although there’s no conclusive evidence aloe vera helps for most of these things. (There’s some evidence it’s a laxative!) The US market for products that say they contain aloe accounts for $146 million, an 11 percent increase in the past year, Bloomberg News reports. The US Food and Drug Administration, however, doesn’t approve cosmetic products before they’re sold, so the agency doesn’t check whether claims on packaging are accurate. \nSeveral law firms have filed lawsuits The aloe gel samples analyzed by Bloomberg News all listed aloe leaf juice as their main ingredient, or the main one after water. However, when they were tested for the plant’s three chemical markers — acemannan, malic acid, and glucose — the products were found to have no evidence of aloe. None of the samples contained lactic acid, either, which would indicate degraded aloe vera. Instead, they contained maltodextrin, a sugar used as a food additive that is sometimes used to imitate aloe and is much cheaper. ( Bloomberg News also analyzed an aloe gel from Walgreens; it contained one aloe marker, meaning that the plant’s presence can’t be confirmed or ruled out.) \nSeveral law firms have filed lawsuits against Walmart, Target, CVS, and Walgreens, after separate tests also found that no aloe is present in the retailers’ store-brand gels. “No reasonable person would have purchased or used the products if they knew the products did not contain any aloe vera,’’ attorneys wrote in a complaint filed in September, according to Bloomberg News .\nTarget declined to comment, while Walmart Stores Inc., CVS Health Corp., and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. all told the news organization that their suppliers had told them their products were authentic. The products Bloomberg tested are Walmart’s Equate Aloe After Sun Gel with pure aloe vera; Target’s Up & Up Aloe Vera Gel with pure aloe vera; CVS Aftersun Aloe Vera Moisturizing Gel; and Walgreens Alcohol Free Aloe Vera Body Gel.",

      "text": "No evidence of aloe vera found in the aloe vera at Wal-Mart, CVS, Target  00 PM Lydia Mulvany, Zeke Faux - Bloomberg \nThe aloe vera gel many Americans buy to soothe damaged skin contains no evidence of aloe vera at all. \nSamples of store-brand aloe gel purchased at national retailers Wal-Mart, Target and CVS showed no indication of the plant in various lab tests. The products all listed aloe barbadensis leaf juice - another name for aloe vera - as either the No. 1 ingredient or No. 2 after water. \nThere's no watchdog assuring that aloe products are what they say they are. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration doesn't approve cosmetics before they're sold and has never levied a fine for selling fake aloe. That means suppliers are on an honor system, even as the total U.S. market for aloe products, including drinks and vitamins, has grown 11 percent in the past year to $146 million, according to Chicago-based market researcher SPINS. \n\"You have to be very careful when you select and use aloe products,\" said Tod Cooperman, president of White Plains, New York-based ConsumerLab.com, which has done aloe testing. \nAloe's three chemical markers - acemannan, malic acid and glucose - were absent in the tests for Wal-Mart, Target and CVS products conducted by a lab hired by Bloomberg News. The three samples contained a cheaper element called maltodextrin, a sugar sometimes used to imitate aloe. The gel that's sold at another retailer, Walgreens, contained one marker, malic acid, but not the other two. That means the presence of aloe can't be confirmed or ruled out, said Ken Jones, an independent industry consultant based in Chapala, Mexico. \nTarget declined to comment. Spokesmen for Wal-Mart Stores, CVS Health and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. said their suppliers confirmed to them that their products were authentic. The four retailers have 23,000 outlets between them. \nThe four gels that Bloomberg had analyzed were Wal-Mart's Equate Aloe After Sun Gel with pure aloe vera; Target's Up & Up Aloe Vera Gel with pure aloe vera; CVS Aftersun Aloe Vera Moisturizing Gel; and Walgreens Alcohol Free Aloe Vera Body Gel. The lab that did the testing requested anonymity to preserve its business relationships. \nThe tests used a technique called nuclear magnetic resonance. It found additives such as maltodextrin and other ingredients, like triethanolamine, an emulsifier. In all the samples, lactic acid, a component that indicates degraded aloe vera, was absent. \nFruit of the Earth, a Fort Worth, Texas-based aloe brand founded in 1980, said it made the gels for Wal-Mart, Target and Walgreens. Fruit of the Earth said its aloe supplier was Ormond Beach, Florida-based Concentrated Aloe Corp., which said it uses fair trade, organic aloe that's farmed and processed in Guatemala. \nBoth companies disputed Bloomberg's findings. \n\"We've been in the business a long time and we know where the raw ingredients come from,'' John Dondrea, Fruit of the Earth's general counsel, said in a telephone interview. \"We stand behind our products.'' \nTim Meadows, president of Concentrated Aloe Corp., said that nuclear magnetic resonance isn't reliable for cosmetics because the presence of multiple ingredients can cause interference and there's no way to test for aloe in finished products. He added that maltodextrin isn't an adulterant because it can be used in the drying process, and while some ways of processing aloe remove acemannan, that doesn't mean the aloe isn't real, he said. \n\"Acemannan has been misinterpreted,'' Meadows said. \"The cosmetics industry requires highly processed aloe. How that affects acemannan is anybody's guess.'' \nThough it's true that nuclear magnetic resonance isn't a test that's designed to study aloe vera in cosmetics, the lab results suggest that the plant \"is not a major component\" of the products, said James Neal-Kababick, director of Flora Research Labs in Grants Pass, Oregon, which tests and researches natural products. Jones, the consultant who also reviewed some of the tests, said he didn't see evidence of aloe or interfering substances. \nThe CVS aloe gel was made by Product Quest Manufacturing. The Daytona Beach, Florida-based firm declined to comment or identify its supplier. \nSeveral law firms, including Bloomfield Hills, Michigan-based Barbat, Mansour & Suciu, have filed lawsuits against the four retailers after separate testing failed to find aloe in the companies' private-label products. They're seeking class-action status and restitution for all the customers who they say were misled. \n\"No reasonable person would have purchased or used the products if they knew the products did not contain any aloe vera,'' attorneys wrote in a complaint filed in September in Illinois on behalf of plaintiffs represented by 10 law firms. \nFruit of the Earth, Wal-Mart, Target, CVS and Walgreens denied the allegations. \nIndependently, ConsumerLab.com said it had Fruit of the Earth brand Aloe Vera 100% Gel tested using nuclear magnetic resonance and found no evidence of aloe, while a competing brand, Aubrey Organics, did contain the markers that indicate aloe. ConsumerLab said it tested a dozen aloe products, including pills and juices, and just half the items appeared to meet the claims on their labels. \nAcemannan is thought to give the plant its beneficial properties, said Jane Wilson, executive director of the International Aloe Science Council in Silver Spring, Maryland, which represents the industry. \nJesper Hummeluhr, founder of Copenhagen-based cosmetics maker Aloe Vera Group APS, said that if acemannan isn't detected, the aloe was degraded during the manufacturing process or the product contains no aloe. He's been making aloe products since 1989. \n\"What you have there is not aloe,'' said Hummeluhr, who reviewed some of the results without being told the name of the brands. \"It could be a lot of water and a little bit of aloe added.'' \nAcemannan is as much as 15 percent of aloe's makeup. Levels below 0.01 percent of dry weight won't register in the tests. Fruit of the Earth's Dondrea declined to say how much aloe is in the firm's gels, citing proprietary formulations. \nAloe vera is a succulent farmed in hot climates like Texas and Mexico. Its spiky leaves contain a clear goo that people have used as a topical ointment to treat burns and other skin problems for millennia. Known as the \"plant of immortality\" in ancient Egypt, it was depicted on stone carvings 6,000 years ago, a burial gift for pharaohs, and it's been used as a folk remedy for conditions from diabetes to epilepsy, according to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health. \nConcerns over imitation aloe aren't new. The industry created the International Aloe Science Council in the 1980s as more and more products hit store shelves that contained little or no aloe, said Wilson, the group's executive director. Maltodextrin, a light-colored powder that looks like aloe powder and is used as a food additive, was a common filler or substitute. Maltodextrin is cheaper than aloe, Wilson said. \nJeff Barrie, a Keene, New Hampshire-based sales manager at AloeCorp, one of the biggest suppliers of raw aloe powder, said he's seen competitors beat his lowest prices by half. That means they're not selling aloe, he said. Aloe powder can cost as much as $240 a kilogram, he said, while the same amount of maltodextrin can cost a few dollars. \nMaking just 1 kilogram of aloe powder, the ingredient used in finished goods like gels and drinks, requires 400 kilos (882 pounds) of aloe leaves, Barrie said. The process involves removing rinds from the leaves and dehydrating the remaining aloe into a powder form. \n\"Aloe is all harvested by hand,\" Barrie said. \"It's an involved process and it's not cheap.\" \nThere's no conclusive body of scientific research affirming aloe's healing properties. While some studies have shown a benefit for burns and cuts, \"there's nothing to hang your hat on\" in terms of clear evidence, partly because there hasn't been enough research, said D. Craig Hopp, a program director at the National Center for Complementary and Integrated Health in Bethesda, Maryland. \n\"There's a lot of people that swear by aloe and love it, and if you put it in your product, you'll sell more of it whether it's a cream or a lotion for sunburns,'' said Gary Shreeve, a vice president of global operations at Scottsdale, Arizona-based Forever Living Products, which sells aloe certified by the International Aloe Science Council. \nSome people are old school about aloe. Rather than buying aloe products, they just keep the succulent around the house. \nMeredith Zielke, a documentary filmmaker in Chicago, is one of many aloe lovers who have a simple remedy. She keeps the plant in her home to cool her skin when her Lyme disease acts up. And it works, she said. \n\"I like just having it at home to snip it from there,\" Zielke said. \"I just like the comfort and the knowledge of having a plant in your house that can actually heal you.\" Authors Information:",

      "text": "No evidence of aloe vera found in the aloe vera at Wal-Mart, CVS, Target   12:00 PM Lydia Mulvany, Zeke Faux - Bloomberg \nThe aloe vera gel many Americans buy to soothe damaged skin contains no evidence of aloe vera at all. \nSamples of store-brand aloe gel purchased at national retailers Wal-Mart, Target and CVS showed no indication of the plant in various lab tests. The products all listed aloe barbadensis leaf juice - another name for aloe vera - as either the No. 1 ingredient or No. 2 after water. \nThere's no watchdog assuring that aloe products are what they say they are. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration doesn't approve cosmetics before they're sold and has never levied a fine for selling fake aloe. That means suppliers are on an honor system, even as the total U.S. market for aloe products, including drinks and vitamins, has grown 11 percent in the past year to $146 million, according to Chicago-based market researcher SPINS. \n\"You have to be very careful when you select and use aloe products,\" said Tod Cooperman, president of White Plains, New York-based ConsumerLab.com, which has done aloe testing. \nAloe's three chemical markers - acemannan, malic acid and glucose - were absent in the tests for Wal-Mart, Target and CVS products conducted by a lab hired by Bloomberg News. The three samples contained a cheaper element called maltodextrin, a sugar sometimes used to imitate aloe. The gel that's sold at another retailer, Walgreens, contained one marker, malic acid, but not the other two. That means the presence of aloe can't be confirmed or ruled out, said Ken Jones, an independent industry consultant based in Chapala, Mexico. \nTarget declined to comment. Spokesmen for Wal-Mart Stores, CVS Health and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. said their suppliers confirmed to them that their products were authentic. The four retailers have 23,000 outlets between them. \nThe four gels that Bloomberg had analyzed were Wal-Mart's Equate Aloe After Sun Gel with pure aloe vera; Target's Up & Up Aloe Vera Gel with pure aloe vera; CVS Aftersun Aloe Vera Moisturizing Gel; and Walgreens Alcohol Free Aloe Vera Body Gel. The lab that did the testing requested anonymity to preserve its business relationships. \nThe tests used a technique called nuclear magnetic resonance. It found additives such as maltodextrin and other ingredients, like triethanolamine, an emulsifier. In all the samples, lactic acid, a component that indicates degraded aloe vera, was absent. \nFruit of the Earth, a Fort Worth, Texas-based aloe brand founded in 1980, said it made the gels for Wal-Mart, Target and Walgreens. Fruit of the Earth said its aloe supplier was Ormond Beach, Florida-based Concentrated Aloe Corp., which said it uses fair trade, organic aloe that's farmed and processed in Guatemala. \nBoth companies disputed Bloomberg's findings. \n\"We've been in the business a long time and we know where the raw ingredients come from,'' John Dondrea, Fruit of the Earth's general counsel, said in a telephone interview. \"We stand behind our products.'' \nTim Meadows, president of Concentrated Aloe Corp., said that nuclear magnetic resonance isn't reliable for cosmetics because the presence of multiple ingredients can cause interference and there's no way to test for aloe in finished products. He added that maltodextrin isn't an adulterant because it can be used in the drying process, and while some ways of processing aloe remove acemannan, that doesn't mean the aloe isn't real, he said. \n\"Acemannan has been misinterpreted,'' Meadows said. \"The cosmetics industry requires highly processed aloe. How that affects acemannan is anybody's guess.'' \nThough it's true that nuclear magnetic resonance isn't a test that's designed to study aloe vera in cosmetics, the lab results suggest that the plant \"is not a major component\" of the products, said James Neal-Kababick, director of Flora Research Labs in Grants Pass, Oregon, which tests and researches natural products. Jones, the consultant who also reviewed some of the tests, said he didn't see evidence of aloe or interfering substances. \nThe CVS aloe gel was made by Product Quest Manufacturing. The Daytona Beach, Florida-based firm declined to comment or identify its supplier. \nSeveral law firms, including Bloomfield Hills, Michigan-based Barbat, Mansour & Suciu, have filed lawsuits against the four retailers after separate testing failed to find aloe in the companies' private-label products. They're seeking class-action status and restitution for all the customers who they say were misled. \n\"No reasonable person would have purchased or used the products if they knew the products did not contain any aloe vera,'' attorneys wrote in a complaint filed in September in Illinois on behalf of plaintiffs represented by 10 law firms. \nFruit of the Earth, Wal-Mart, Target, CVS and Walgreens denied the allegations. \nIndependently, ConsumerLab.com said it had Fruit of the Earth brand Aloe Vera 100% Gel tested using nuclear magnetic resonance and found no evidence of aloe, while a competing brand, Aubrey Organics, did contain the markers that indicate aloe. ConsumerLab said it tested a dozen aloe products, including pills and juices, and just half the items appeared to meet the claims on their labels. \nAcemannan is thought to give the plant its beneficial properties, said Jane Wilson, executive director of the International Aloe Science Council in Silver Spring, Maryland, which represents the industry. \nJesper Hummeluhr, founder of Copenhagen-based cosmetics maker Aloe Vera Group APS, said that if acemannan isn't detected, the aloe was degraded during the manufacturing process or the product contains no aloe. He's been making aloe products since 1989. \n\"What you have there is not aloe,'' said Hummeluhr, who reviewed some of the results without being told the name of the brands. \"It could be a lot of water and a little bit of aloe added.'' \nAcemannan is as much as 15 percent of aloe's makeup. Levels below 0.01 percent of dry weight won't register in the tests. Fruit of the Earth's Dondrea declined to say how much aloe is in the firm's gels, citing proprietary formulations. \nAloe vera is a succulent farmed in hot climates like Texas and Mexico. Its spiky leaves contain a clear goo that people have used as a topical ointment to treat burns and other skin problems for millennia. Known as the \"plant of immortality\" in ancient Egypt, it was depicted on stone carvings 6,000 years ago, a burial gift for pharaohs, and it's been used as a folk remedy for conditions from diabetes to epilepsy, according to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health. \nConcerns over imitation aloe aren't new. The industry created the International Aloe Science Council in the 1980s as more and more products hit store shelves that contained little or no aloe, said Wilson, the group's executive director. Maltodextrin, a light-colored powder that looks like aloe powder and is used as a food additive, was a common filler or substitute. Maltodextrin is cheaper than aloe, Wilson said. \nJeff Barrie, a Keene, New Hampshire-based sales manager at AloeCorp, one of the biggest suppliers of raw aloe powder, said he's seen competitors beat his lowest prices by half. That means they're not selling aloe, he said. Aloe powder can cost as much as $240 a kilogram, he said, while the same amount of maltodextrin can cost a few dollars. \nMaking just 1 kilogram of aloe powder, the ingredient used in finished goods like gels and drinks, requires 400 kilos (882 pounds) of aloe leaves, Barrie said. The process involves removing rinds from the leaves and dehydrating the remaining aloe into a powder form. \n\"Aloe is all harvested by hand,\" Barrie said. \"It's an involved process and it's not cheap.\" \nThere's no conclusive body of scientific research affirming aloe's healing properties. While some studies have shown a benefit for burns and cuts, \"there's nothing to hang your hat on\" in terms of clear evidence, partly because there hasn't been enough research, said D. Craig Hopp, a program director at the National Center for Complementary and Integrated Health in Bethesda, Maryland. \n\"There's a lot of people that swear by aloe and love it, and if you put it in your product, you'll sell more of it whether it's a cream or a lotion for sunburns,'' said Gary Shreeve, a vice president of global operations at Scottsdale, Arizona-based Forever Living Products, which sells aloe certified by the International Aloe Science Council. \nSome people are old school about aloe. Rather than buying aloe products, they just keep the succulent around the house. \nMeredith Zielke, a documentary filmmaker in Chicago, is one of many aloe lovers who have a simple remedy. She keeps the plant in her home to cool her skin when her Lyme disease acts up. And it works, she said. \n\"I like just having it at home to snip it from there,\" Zielke said. \"I just like the comfort and the knowledge of having a plant in your house that can actually heal you.\" Authors Information:",

      "text": "Summary \nValuation metrics favor CVS- furthermore most of the bad news is already priced into the stock. \nWBA is expected to close its Rite Aid acquisition in Q1 of 2017. There are high expectations for synergies but integration issues loom. \nBoth companies’ prospects are good with a virtual duopoly in most US metro areas. Last week I wrote an article about why I was adding to my CVS position after the company lost over ~10% of its market value due disappointing guidance following the loss of some significant business. CVS CEO Larry Mello is quoted as saying: Very recent pharmacy network changes in the marketplace are expected to cause some retail prescriptions to begin migrating out of our pharmacies this quarter. For a bit more color on the loss of business you can read this Forbes article . I received quite a bit of feedback as to why CVS is a bad investment (balance sheet, loss of business) and how Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ: WBA ) is a better alternative. I understand I am in the minority view on this one - why else would WBA price hang in there while CVS sells off? Therein lies the opportunity. Whether I am buying or selling, I prefer to be in contrarian position. After all, if everybody is buying or bought in, price is already bid up. And if everyone is selling, probably not the best time to sell unless the company is going out of business or is in rapid decline. Thus, I wanted write a follow up article to do a detailed side by side comparison of CVS and WBA and the potential impact Rite Aid (NYSE: RAD ) acquisition by WBA will have on both WBA and CVS. Historical Context: First some perspective- both companies are great franchises and have managed their businesses well. If you had bought WBA (ticker symbol was WAG before it merged with Alliance Booth Company- Europe's Largest Pharmaceutical Wholesaler) you would have doubled your investment (not including dividends) over the past decade (see Figure 1). A CVS investor did even better with a 150%+ return (even after the 30%+ stock plunge since 2015). Both returns compare favorably to the ~ 50% appreciation S&P500 index delivered over the past decade. Figure 1- 10 Year Stock Price Comparison Click to enlarge Source: Schwab.com Interestingly, both of these companies have achieved these returns by impressive business results rather than expansion of their PE multiples- especially in CVS case. Charts 1 and 2 show the excellent job the companies did growing their top and bottom-lines. Chart 3 shows the Compound Annual Growth Rates for Revenue, Income and EPS. These are solid numbers no matter how you look at it. However, if one had to pick a winner, CVS clearly stands out- it has grown its Revenue, Net Income and EPS each around ~15% vs. ~10% for WBA. Taken over a 10 year period, that adds up to a meaningful difference. Compounding at 15% annually, one doubles their money every 5 years (quadrupling in 10), whereas at 10% CAGR, doubling occurs every 7 years with a 2.6X return in 10 years. Charts 1&2- 10 Year Financial Performance Click to enlarge Source: Morningstar.com, Company IR Web Sites, Author's Work. Source: Morningstar.com, Company IR Web Sites, Author's Work. This is not to say that over the next 10 years the two companies will continue to grow at historical rates, or that CVS will continue to outperform WBA. There will always be ebbs and flows in business. One will stumble while the other fires on all cylinders. In fact, we do know that over the next few years WBA is going to add significantly to its top-line (and if all goes well to its bottom-line) due to its RAD acquisition while CVS is going to be licking its wounds due to its loss of business to WBA. RAD acquisition: Chart 4 shows the relative size of the 3 companies today and how WBA/RAD combination would look if the two companies were merged today. Click to enlarge Source: Morningstar.com, Company IR Web Sites, Author's Work. Yet all that revenue may not bring commensurate Net income. WBA claims that it will get $1B in synergies out of the combination of the two businesses- and expects to realize those synergies 3-4 years after the close of the acquisition. For Fiscal 2017, they expect to deliver 4.85-5.20 in EPS with 0.05-0.12 coming from RAD acquisition. For those returns, WBA is paying a $17B price tag (see below for further details). That is a lot of money for a company that did not make a dime in the last 10 years (See Chart 5). As a shareholder, I am not sure if I would not be better off had the company returned that money to me thru dividends or buybacks. Although at a PE of 17 based on next year's EPS, one can argue that buying back stock at these levels may not be the best use of company's capital. Source: Morningstar.com, Company IR Web Sites, Author's Work. Now, WBA is a well-run company and thru purchasing power and operational improvement I am sure they will get more out of RAD than if it were a standalone company. Nevertheless, this is going to be a big pill to swallow. There will be systems integrations issues, people issues (think redundancies), store divestiture issues and a whole host of other things no one anticipated. In other words, this acquisition will require a lot of management bandwidth and attention, and even then there are no guarantees it will be smooth. As for the market share issue mentioned earlier: according to a Fortune Article , CVS and WBA with their (9500 and 8000 stores respectively) control over 50% market share in over 75 of the 100 biggest metro areas in the US. And that is before the RAD acquisition. As such, to get regulatory approval, WBA may have divest close 1000 stores. This is an opportunity for CVS to grab more market share and further grow its footprint, with Target Pharmacy acquisition already behind it. Valuation: IF we take WBA management at their word that they will make $5.03 EPS (mid-point of its Fiscal 2017 guidance of $4.85 to $5.20), representing a ~10% EPS Growth year-over-year, the company is trading at a PE of 17 based on Monday's closing stock price of $84.42 and projected 2017 EPS guidance. In contrast, CVS's PE ratio is a much lower 13X based on Monday's closing price of $74.20 and a projected 2017 EPS of $5.85 based on management guidance. In my previous article on CVS, I detailed how the company can achieve their stated long-term EPS growth of 10% over the next 10 years with an aggressive share repurchase program- requiring only a 2% Net Income CAGR in the same time frame. I also stipulated that once the negative sentiment around lower than expected guidance coupled with a resumption of EPS growth turns investor sentiment from negative to neutral, the stock should get back to a more reasonable PE of 16 (see Figure 3. for a historical look at CVS's PE ratio). As a result, the combination of growing EPS and higher PE ratio should enable investors to once again beat the S&P500 over the next decade with a 300% return not including dividends. Figure 2- Historical PE Ratio for CVS Source: Marketwatch.com Contrast that with the higher expectations for WBA- the higher PE starting point does not give much room for investors to see any meaningful PE expansion (See Figure 3). Furthermore, WBA has chosen to spend their cash on acquisitions rather than giving a boost to their EPS thru share buybacks- a smart strategy perhaps as their stock is not undervalued as CVS's. Therefore, investors in WBA will have to rely on EPS growth to fuel their stock price appreciation- which I expect will be in the 7-10% (equal or slightly lower than the past decade due to slowing growth, partially offset by synergies from RAD acquisition), which translates to a doubling to 2.5X returns of the stock (not including dividends). Not too shabby, but I prefer to triple my money with a higher margin of safety. Figure 3- Historical PE Ratio for WBA Source: Marketwatch.com Balance Sheet: According to the most recent company earnings releases (see IR Web sites for CVS and WBA ), WBA has the better balance sheet with more cash and lower Total Liabilities as a percentage of Total Assets. Furthermore, only 20% of WBA's total assets are in Goodwill vs. 40% for CVS's. As for long term debt, CVS carries a debt load of $26.7B (27% of total assets) vs. WBA's $18.7B (25.7% of total assets). For a detailed comparison, see Table 1. Table1- Key Balance Sheet Data Click to enlarge Source: Company Earnings Releases, Marketwatch.com, Author's Work. However, this is all expected to change with the close of RAD acquisition. First, the cash will be substantially reduced. RAD has over 1Billion shares outstanding. WBA's agreed acquisition price of $9/share values the company at ~$9B+. Furthermore, WBA agreed to assume RAD's long-term debt of ~$8B- costing the company roughly $17B (as stated in their news release ). Thus I would expect WBA's ~$10B in cash to be substantially consumed in the purchase, while the assumption of ~$8B debt to increase its long term debt from $18.7B to $26B- ironically just about the same as CVS's. Having said all that, I don't think either company is dangerously over leveraged- a little too high for my comfort, but nothing they cannot handle: Both companies are generating healthy amounts of Operating and Free Cash Flows. CVS is expected to generate over $9B in Operating Cash Flow and close to $7B in Free Cash Flow. The numbers for WBA are similar, with $7.8B in Operating Cash Flow and $6.5B in Free Cash Flow. Conclusion: The bottom line is that both CVS and WBA are great businesses with wonderful prospects. An investor should do well holding either company's stock for the next decade. However, my preference clearly is for CVS, both for valuation and operational reasons. Once sentiment turns more bullish on CVS and the company is done buying back its shares, I would expect a 3X return on my investment over the next decade due to a combination of 10% CAGR of EPS and a PE multiple expansion to 16. For WBA, while I continue to own the stock, I am not adding to my position. I expect some hiccups along the way of RAD acquisition. Moreover, the 17X PE ratio on what I consider to be somewhat optimistic earnings projections do not leave a lot of margin for error Disclosure: I am/we are long WBA, CVS.

      "text": "No evidence of aloe vera found in the aloe vera at Wal-Mart, CVS, Target   11:00 AM Lydia Mulvany, Zeke Faux - Bloomberg \nThe aloe vera gel many Americans buy to soothe damaged skin contains no evidence of aloe vera at all. \nSamples of store-brand aloe gel purchased at national retailers Wal-Mart, Target and CVS showed no indication of the plant in various lab tests. The products all listed aloe barbadensis leaf juice - another name for aloe vera - as either the No. 1 ingredient or No. 2 after water. \nThere's no watchdog assuring that aloe products are what they say they are. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration doesn't approve cosmetics before they're sold and has never levied a fine for selling fake aloe. That means suppliers are on an honor system, even as the total U.S. market for aloe products, including drinks and vitamins, has grown 11 percent in the past year to $146 million, according to Chicago-based market researcher SPINS. \n\"You have to be very careful when you select and use aloe products,\" said Tod Cooperman, president of White Plains, New York-based ConsumerLab.com, which has done aloe testing. \nAloe's three chemical markers - acemannan, malic acid and glucose - were absent in the tests for Wal-Mart, Target and CVS products conducted by a lab hired by Bloomberg News. The three samples contained a cheaper element called maltodextrin, a sugar sometimes used to imitate aloe. The gel that's sold at another retailer, Walgreens, contained one marker, malic acid, but not the other two. That means the presence of aloe can't be confirmed or ruled out, said Ken Jones, an independent industry consultant based in Chapala, Mexico. \nTarget declined to comment. Spokesmen for Wal-Mart Stores, CVS Health and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. said their suppliers confirmed to them that their products were authentic. The four retailers have 23,000 outlets between them. \nThe four gels that Bloomberg had analyzed were Wal-Mart's Equate Aloe After Sun Gel with pure aloe vera; Target's Up & Up Aloe Vera Gel with pure aloe vera; CVS Aftersun Aloe Vera Moisturizing Gel; and Walgreens Alcohol Free Aloe Vera Body Gel. The lab that did the testing requested anonymity to preserve its business relationships. \nThe tests used a technique called nuclear magnetic resonance. It found additives such as maltodextrin and other ingredients, like triethanolamine, an emulsifier. In all the samples, lactic acid, a component that indicates degraded aloe vera, was absent. \nFruit of the Earth, a Fort Worth, Texas-based aloe brand founded in 1980, said it made the gels for Wal-Mart, Target and Walgreens. Fruit of the Earth said its aloe supplier was Ormond Beach, Florida-based Concentrated Aloe Corp., which said it uses fair trade, organic aloe that's farmed and processed in Guatemala. \nBoth companies disputed Bloomberg's findings. \n\"We've been in the business a long time and we know where the raw ingredients come from,'' John Dondrea, Fruit of the Earth's general counsel, said in a telephone interview. \"We stand behind our products.'' \nTim Meadows, president of Concentrated Aloe Corp., said that nuclear magnetic resonance isn't reliable for cosmetics because the presence of multiple ingredients can cause interference and there's no way to test for aloe in finished products. He added that maltodextrin isn't an adulterant because it can be used in the drying process, and while some ways of processing aloe remove acemannan, that doesn't mean the aloe isn't real, he said. \n\"Acemannan has been misinterpreted,'' Meadows said. \"The cosmetics industry requires highly processed aloe. How that affects acemannan is anybody's guess.'' \nThough it's true that nuclear magnetic resonance isn't a test that's designed to study aloe vera in cosmetics, the lab results suggest that the plant \"is not a major component\" of the products, said James Neal-Kababick, director of Flora Research Labs in Grants Pass, Oregon, which tests and researches natural products. Jones, the consultant who also reviewed some of the tests, said he didn't see evidence of aloe or interfering substances. \nThe CVS aloe gel was made by Product Quest Manufacturing. The Daytona Beach, Florida-based firm declined to comment or identify its supplier. \nSeveral law firms, including Bloomfield Hills, Michigan-based Barbat, Mansour & Suciu, have filed lawsuits against the four retailers after separate testing failed to find aloe in the companies' private-label products. They're seeking class-action status and restitution for all the customers who they say were misled. \n\"No reasonable person would have purchased or used the products if they knew the products did not contain any aloe vera,'' attorneys wrote in a complaint filed in September in Illinois on behalf of plaintiffs represented by 10 law firms. \nFruit of the Earth, Wal-Mart, Target, CVS and Walgreens denied the allegations. \nIndependently, ConsumerLab.com said it had Fruit of the Earth brand Aloe Vera 100% Gel tested using nuclear magnetic resonance and found no evidence of aloe, while a competing brand, Aubrey Organics, did contain the markers that indicate aloe. ConsumerLab said it tested a dozen aloe products, including pills and juices, and just half the items appeared to meet the claims on their labels. \nAcemannan is thought to give the plant its beneficial properties, said Jane Wilson, executive director of the International Aloe Science Council in Silver Spring, Maryland, which represents the industry. \nJesper Hummeluhr, founder of Copenhagen-based cosmetics maker Aloe Vera Group APS, said that if acemannan isn't detected, the aloe was degraded during the manufacturing process or the product contains no aloe. He's been making aloe products since 1989. \n\"What you have there is not aloe,'' said Hummeluhr, who reviewed some of the results without being told the name of the brands. \"It could be a lot of water and a little bit of aloe added.'' \nAcemannan is as much as 15 percent of aloe's makeup. Levels below 0.01 percent of dry weight won't register in the tests. Fruit of the Earth's Dondrea declined to say how much aloe is in the firm's gels, citing proprietary formulations. \nAloe vera is a succulent farmed in hot climates like Texas and Mexico. Its spiky leaves contain a clear goo that people have used as a topical ointment to treat burns and other skin problems for millennia. Known as the \"plant of immortality\" in ancient Egypt, it was depicted on stone carvings 6,000 years ago, a burial gift for pharaohs, and it's been used as a folk remedy for conditions from diabetes to epilepsy, according to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health. \nConcerns over imitation aloe aren't new. The industry created the International Aloe Science Council in the 1980s as more and more products hit store shelves that contained little or no aloe, said Wilson, the group's executive director. Maltodextrin, a light-colored powder that looks like aloe powder and is used as a food additive, was a common filler or substitute. Maltodextrin is cheaper than aloe, Wilson said. \nJeff Barrie, a Keene, New Hampshire-based sales manager at AloeCorp, one of the biggest suppliers of raw aloe powder, said he's seen competitors beat his lowest prices by half. That means they're not selling aloe, he said. Aloe powder can cost as much as $240 a kilogram, he said, while the same amount of maltodextrin can cost a few dollars. \nMaking just 1 kilogram of aloe powder, the ingredient used in finished goods like gels and drinks, requires 400 kilos (882 pounds) of aloe leaves, Barrie said. The process involves removing rinds from the leaves and dehydrating the remaining aloe into a powder form. \n\"Aloe is all harvested by hand,\" Barrie said. \"It's an involved process and it's not cheap.\" \nThere's no conclusive body of scientific research affirming aloe's healing properties. While some studies have shown a benefit for burns and cuts, \"there's nothing to hang your hat on\" in terms of clear evidence, partly because there hasn't been enough research, said D. Craig Hopp, a program director at the National Center for Complementary and Integrated Health in Bethesda, Maryland. \n\"There's a lot of people that swear by aloe and love it, and if you put it in your product, you'll sell more of it whether it's a cream or a lotion for sunburns,'' said Gary Shreeve, a vice president of global operations at Scottsdale, Arizona-based Forever Living Products, which sells aloe certified by the International Aloe Science Council. \nSome people are old school about aloe. Rather than buying aloe products, they just keep the succulent around the house. \nMeredith Zielke, a documentary filmmaker in Chicago, is one of many aloe lovers who have a simple remedy. She keeps the plant in her home to cool her skin when her Lyme disease acts up. And it works, she said. \n\"I like just having it at home to snip it from there,\" Zielke said. \"I just like the comfort and the knowledge of having a plant in your house that can actually heal you.\" Authors Information:",

      "text": "If you use Aloe Vera gel from Walmart , CVS , or Target , you might be soothing burns with sugar rather than extract from a plant.\nMultiple lab tests of store-brand aloe gel from Walmart, Target, and CVS showed no traces of aloe vera, even though aloe vera juice is listed as the first or second ingredient in every case, according to an in-depth report Bloomberg published Tuesday. Instead, the samples included a cheaper additive, maltodextrin, which is essentially a sugar made from starch. It’s often used as an aloe substitute, and can also be found in Jello and Splenda.\nBloomberg hired a lab to test four gels: Walmart’s Equate Aloe After Sun Gel with pure aloe vera; CVS’ Aftersun Aloe Vera Moisturizing Gel; Target’s Up & Up Aloe Vera Gel with pure aloe vera; and Walgreens Alcohol Free Aloe Vera Body Gel.\nResults showed that the three chemical markers for aloe were absent in Walmart, CVS, and Target’s samples. The Walgreens sample included just one of the markers, suggesting that the presence of aloe could neither be confirmed nor ruled out.\n \nFort Worth, Texas-based Fruit of the Earth made the gels for Walgreens, Walmart, and Target. Daytona Beach, Fla.-based Product Quest Manufacturing made CVS’s aloe gel. Fruit of the Earth disputed Bloomberg’s findings, while Product Quest declined to comment to Bloomberg.\nThe Food and Drug Administration doesn’t approve cosmetics before they are sold to consumers, which would allow an aloe-less aloe gel onto shelves without being stopped.\n“We hold our suppliers to high standards and are committed to providing our customers the quality of products they expect,” a Walmart representative told Fortune . “We contacted our suppliers and they stand behind the authenticity of their products.”\n“The quality, safety and integrity of our products is of highest priority to us, and we carefully select suppliers who share those priorities as well,” Walgreens said in a statement. ” Our supplier has assured us that the product's ingredients match its labeling.”\nTarget declined to comment to Fortune . We’ve reached out to CVS, Fruit of the Earth, and Product Quest for comment as well, and will update when they respond.",
