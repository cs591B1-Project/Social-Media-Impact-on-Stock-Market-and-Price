      "text": "As Sheryl Connelly, Ford Motor Company&apos;s in-house futurist, and her team started conducting the research in early 2016 that would yield the just-released Looking Further with Ford 2017 global trends report, the U.S. presidential race had yet to be decided, and Brexit hadn&apos;t happened. \"But we had this sense of a growing restlessness,\" reflects Connelly, who was named one of Fast Company &apos;s Most Creative People in 2013.\nSheryl Connelly And now—in the wake of the election, Britain&apos;s vote to leave the European Union, and other world events—we are indeed entering 2017 facing change and uncertainty. \"Everyone is reassessing their priorities, rethinking what they thought they once knew,\" Connelly says.\nTrust in government, corporations, and media, which was on the decline back in 2013 when Ford first began sharing its trends research with the public, has gone off a cliff. We now live in a world where people—85%, according to Ford—are concerned about their personal data being obtained without their consent, and 80% believe media outlets offer more opinion than they do objective news coverage.\nEighty percent of respondents tell Ford they find social media is more about optics than substance, and 65% agree that people in general are less likely to even consider opposing viewpoints these days. \"We tend to only seek out information that already reinforces what we already believe,\" Connelly says. \"There is less room for discourse, for compromise, and people seem to be increasingly wedded to their point of view and unwilling to entertain any divergent perspective.\"\nMeanwhile, fake news is hard to avoid these days. \"Even when you want to do your due diligence, it&apos;s really difficult to figure out whether you’re reading something that&apos;s authentic,\" Connelly says, noting, \"This is an unexpected by-product of having information at our fingertips all the time.\"\nThere is no denying that technology has improved our lives, but we have entered what the Ford trends report describes as a \"tech spiral\" in which people are also starting to see the downsides of always being connected to devices and a nonstop stream of information and entertainment. Technology is making us obese, according to 77% of those surveyed, while a majority of respondents—78% of women and 69% of men—say technology causes sleep deprivation.\nFord&apos;s latest trends report also reveals that people are redefining what it means to live \"the good life,\" becoming less materialistic and pursuing experiences that make life worth living and staying true to their values. The majority of people agree prosperity is more about happiness than wealth, though the percentages vary depending on what country those surveyed live in. To wit: 82% of respondents in India agreed with this statement, while the percentages fell to 70% of those in the U.S. and 64% of those in the U.K. (Ford studied consumers in nine countries.)\nThe need to belong to a community is also strong all around the globe, and people expect businesses to play a role in that community and give back. In fact, 88% f women and 83% of men are more likely to support companies that prioritize purpose over profit. \"What a company stands for will actually have increasing importance in the viability of their brand,\" Connelly says, noting that the days of corporate social responsibility being an ancillary effort as opposed to a core component in the operation of any business are long over.\nThose looking for a deeper dive into all of the trends Ford sees influencing consumer behavior can read the entire Looking Further with Ford 2017 global trends report online.",

\"More than 600,\" was all the company would tell him.\nTop speed? More than 200 mph.\nTop price? Each GT will be built to order so it's unlikely any two will be the same. According to Road & Track, a price tag of half a million dollars is a \"distinct possibility.\"",

      "text": "Ford Touts Second-Gen EcoBoost V-6, 10-Speed Trans for ’17 F-150 \nDETROIT – General Motors releases details on its all-new 9-speed automatic transmission, a technology and patent-packed gearbox the automaker expects will spur a 2% fuel-economy gain and impress customers with smooth drivability. \n“This thing is going to excite our customers,” says Scott Kline, assistant chief engineer for the Hydra-Matic 9T50 9-speed automatic. “When you get in it, you can tell it is a premium product.” \nChris Meagher, executive director-Transmission and Electrification Hardware Engineering at GM, calls the transmission entering the market in the ’17 Chevy Malibu midsize sedan and coming to the ’17 Chevy Cruze Diesel small sedan this summer and ’18 Chevy Equinox midsize CUV later in the year a major step toward meeting future global fuel-economy and emissions regulations. \nBut as pivotal an efficiency role as automatic transmissions with greater than the traditional six forward gears can play, it is unlikely GM will go much beyond nine speeds for front-wheel-drive vehicles and a 10-speed automatic due soon for its rear-wheel-drive applications. \n“We don’t see the benefit of going higher than 10 forward speeds,” Meagher tells WardsAuto following a presentation on the technologies here. \nBut never say never, he adds, noting that when GM deployed its revolutionary lineup of 6-speed automatic transmissions a decade ago no one imagined hardware and software technology would advance so dramatically to permit 9- and 10-speed executions. \n“So you never really know for sure,” he admits. \nLike the old 6-speed units, which GM refined over the years and expects to continue applying to its vehicles into the near future, the 9-speed was developed through a partnership with crosstown rival Ford . \nBoth automakers also derive 10-speed variants from the work. Ford brought that gearbox to market recently in the F-150 large pickup, while GM got first dibs on the 9-speed. GM’s first application of the 10-speed will be in the ’17 Chevy Camaro ZL1, a 640-hp supercharged version of the sports coupe due later this year in the U.S. \n“Think of it as two-for-one,” Meagher says of the cost savings from developing the units with a partner. \nThe GM and Ford transmissions are nearly identical from a hardware perspective, although some parts differ because each automaker links to its engines differently. Each uses its own parts code and is free to source the parts from suppliers of its own choosing. \nThe GM and Ford units differ greatly from a driving dynamics perspective. Each automaker deploys its own software to the transmissions to impart a specific character to each vehicle using them. \nMeagher says the global nature of the 9-speed program and worldwide popularity of vehicles getting the gearbox over the next several years will push volumes high. He declines to offer a production outlook, but WardsAuto forecasting partner AutoForecast Solutions projects global penetration of the unit will rise from 478,518 units in 2017 to 2.16 million in 2023. \nThat means the 9-speed likely someday will replace the current 6-speed altogether, with the latter sticking around until volume deployment of the former brings economies of scale. The 6-speed also may be a good fit for a period in emerging markets where cost sensitivity is more acute. \nAs for now, a fourth model also will receive the 9-speed soon, perhaps on a redesigned GMC Terrain midsize CUV. GM expects 10 vehicle models to use it by the end of 2017. It is built at GM’s San Luis Potosi, Mexico, manufacturing operation after a recent $131 million investment to accommodate its production. \nThe 6-speed automatic transmission remains the popular gearbox in the U.S., appearing on 54.8% of light vehicles in the ’16 model year, according to WardsAuto data.",

      "text": "Advertise Ford Uses Vertical Video To Cleverly Promote Its Blind Spot Information System \nTo promote the Ford Edge’s Blind Spot Information System (BLIS), BBR Saatchi & Saatchi Israel leveraged the growing popularity of Facebook’s vertical video format to launch a mobile commercial that creatively used the top and bottom black bars that appear in regular horizontal videos. \nWhen the video begins, the black bars cover parts of the road that drivers would not be able to see unless they had BLIS. After a few seconds, the bars fall away to reveal how the car’s advanced system helps detect vehicles and other objects in the driver’s blind spot. Watch the full video below \nThe Facebook post generated record high results for the brand with over 600,000 views in four days and a reach of over 1.2 million Israelis (in a country of 8 million). \nIt’s good to see brands coming up with clutter-breaking ideas on social media and using new ad formats effectively. Have you tried Facebook vertical video ads yet?   creative  ",

      "text": "It is hard to know which is cooler, that Sparks Trucks built this monstrous 2011 Ford F-350 Super Duty pickup into a Caterpillar yellow \"Brodozer\" project with hydraulic rear-wheel steering, or that they installed an actual Atari 2600 joystick to steer the rear-wheel steering.\nThis four-door crew cab beast deletes the cargo bed entirely, keeping the Brodozer short enough to maneuver in tight spaces. And now it can never drag its rear bumper coming down off a rock.\nDespite the cool Caterpillar badging and paint, the original Ford PowerStroke 6.7-liter V8 diesel remains under Brodozer's hood, driving all four wheels through the factory six-speed automatic transmission.\nRear suspension is full monster truck-specification equipment, with its steering controlled by a hydraulic system, with that classic Atari joystick commanding it.\nIt features Mickey Thompson 54-inch Claw Tires mounted to 20 x 18-inch double-headlock wheels.\nTogether, all this amazing hardware should make Brodozer unstoppable. And you will be too, if you meet Sparks' $99,000 asking price.\nh/t: HiConsumption",

      "title": "Ford: Buy For Attractive Dividend Yield",
      "text": "Summary \nFord Motor Company has attractive dividend yield and low financial leverage. \nDemand for the company’s production is prone to downturns in the economic cycle and costs are mostly fixed. \nWe believe that Ford’s stock can be a good addition to a low-risk portfolio by increasing risk in exchange for decent dividend compensation. Click to enlarge Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F ) has attractive dividend yield and low financial leverage (on an adjusted basis). It can become a valuable addition to investment portfolio with below-average yield and volatility. Among the threats to earnings stability we primarily see: the company's high dependence on business cycle with mostly fixed costs; the necessity to invest heavily in alternative fuel vehicles' development with uncertain outcome. Demand for the company's production is prone to downturns in the economic cycle and costs are mostly fixed. These factors explain high net income volatility for the last 3 years. In a distressing FY2014 a 2.5% decrease in revenue combined with 7.0% growth in costs resulted in a $0.6mln pre-tax loss for Automotive segment. The increase in costs was partially attributable to increased investments in new product development. In FY2015 the recovery followed illustrated by revenue growth (3.5%) and restoration of pre-tax profit to $10.2bn - 8x times the FY2014 result. In 9m2016 profit before tax dropped again by 5.3% YoY while revenue increased by 3.5% - the reduction in profitability was mostly due to outrunning growth in the cost of sales. Problem with fixed costs is exacerbated by the fact that Ford has to maintain a high level of spending for new product launch. E.g. the effect of all-new Super Duty pickup introduction in 3Q2016 was among the reasons for a negative pre-tax profitability impact of $1.6bn. Although volatile as shown above, the company's sales tend to fluctuate within a small range so the economic downturn has to be really severe to seriously affect net income. For a medium term the projections are that auto sales will increase in a low single-digits in 2016 and flatten out in 2017-2018 period - so we believe that external operating conditions are favorable for Ford. The company splits its sales geographically since the products are essentially the same in nature. Ford's total share in auto sales has been stable (7.5% at end-9m2016) but it has been declining in the most important region. The company's market share has decreased from 15.2% in 2013 to 13.6% at end-3Q16 in North America. This location is key driver of revenue for Ford since in FY2015 46.3% of sales in terms of volumes were derived from here. Different trends affect sales: on one side Ford's sales are mostly driven by trucks and pickups - including F-series - and high-cube engine models such as Mustang. Currently low level of oil prices supports the sales for these products. On the other side, consumers' preferences generally lean towards more fuel efficient cars and that causes the decline of the company's market share. As an offset to North American decline, Ford's presence is growing in emerging markets with high potential such as China - to 5.1% from 4.5% at end-2015. South American penetration had also been growing steadily (up to 10.0% at end-2015) but the region's macro profile is weak and in 9m2016 Ford's sales rolled back and share dropped to 8.9%. The company invests actively in its new Mobility division but it's still at early development stage. Although it's partially a supplementary product line for the existing ones (like smart systems for cars) it is also aimed to focus on autonomous vehicles where the competition is fierce with major hi-tech companies taking part. Ford acknowledges this business line as a start-up and doesn't disclose financial performance (most likely there are no direct benefits at the moment). Total unadjusted debt is large - Net Debt / EBITDA ratio exceeds 5.3x. But it's more correct to assess only the unsecured debt since almost half of the \"Financial services\" segment debt is fully covered by receivables from car leasing and credit sales. Roughly 2/3 of these receivables are to end-consumers and the rest - to car dealers. These assets have high credit quality - only about 1% is impaired. Although in 9m2016 the amount of provision expense for credit losses grew significantly (from $188mln to $324mln YoY) the cost of risk is still modest at less than 0.5% annualized. Given its almost 200,000 employees worldwide, Ford has large pension plan-related obligations. The plans are \"defined benefit\" so the company bears the risk of not gaining the projected income and having to cover the deficit. At end-2015 the pension plans were underfunded by $8.2bn and that amount exceeded $7.4bn net income for the whole year. In 9m2016 the deficit amount decreased to $7.0bn but the company anticipates it will grow YoY at end-FY2016. It should be noted that anticipated interest rate rise in the USA would have had a positive effect on the plans but as indicated in the financial statements, year-end projections are already made \" based on ( … ) planning assumptions for asset returns, discount rates ( … ) \" - so it was already taken into account. To address the mismatch Ford may need to raise additional debt and it already has total $11.9bn credit facilities available. As a result, we believe that although the impact of pension plan obligations remeasurement on equity can be significant for 4Q2016 it doesn't threaten the company's solvency in a medium term. The dividend yield is attractive (4.9%) and dividends per share have been growing constantly for the last several years (by $0.1 or more than 10% per year). The growth in 2016 was mostly caused by $1.0bn \"supplemental dividend\" payment in 1Q16 but we see this as company's commitment to maintaining cash flow to shareholder either by dividends or by share buybacks. Ford is often compared to another US-based giant, GM and the company's stock prices are much less volatile than GM's (beta 1.23 vs. 1.69). We believe that Ford's stock can be a good addition to a low-risk portfolio by increasing risk in exchange for decent dividend compensation.

      "text": "Mark Hamill was too focused on light saber fights on set of ‘Star Wars’ to notice affair between Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford Mark Hamill was unaware of Fisher, Ford affair on 'Star Wars' NEW YORK DAILY NEWS   10:14 AM \nEven the force couldn’t help Luke Skywalker sense an affair going on inside the Millennium Falcon. \nMark Hamill, 65, who played Carrie Fisher’s brother in the “Star Wars” franchise, revealed to Entertainment Tonight that he was “blissfully unaware” of the lightning romance happening between co-stars Fisher and Harrison Ford. Mark Hamill (l.), Carrie Fisher (c.) and Harrison Ford starred in the 1977 film \"Star Wars.\" (AP) \n“I was so self-involved at that point, they could've been doing it in front of me and I wouldn't have noticed,” Hamill said. “I was single and had my own agenda.” \nWhile the actor said on-set flings are a “commonplace,” he told ET he believes they can create a “tricky” situation for everyone involved. Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford share an intimate moment on the set of \"Star Wars Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back\" in 1980. (Courtesy Everett Collection/Everett Collection / Everett Col) \n\"If the relationship doesn't last and you're on a TV series and you got four more seasons to go, it can be really awkward,\" Hamill shared from his own personal experience. \n\"It happened to me... I was with a girl who was playing my sister on a soap opera, General Hospital,\" he said, referring to his affair with co-star Anne Wyndham back in the 70s.",

      "text": "\n-It should come as no surprise that the Ford GT has an adjustable multimode suspension. Every current supercar, along with a growing number of more mundane machines, offers this capability in some form. But by offering a first ride-along in a preproduction prototype of the upcoming Ford supercar , the automaker showed more about what’s going on under the Blue Oval’s halo car. And it’s unlike anything in its segment today. \n-The GT’s suspension system uses pushrod-actuated torsion bars in place of coil springs. This moves the major suspension components inboard, minimizing unsprung mass and making room for the giant aero passages that are key to the car’s flow-through aerodynamics.\n-Through a complex system that Ford only described in vague terms (as patents are still pending), each corner is acted on by two springs in series. Think back to your physics courses: Stack two identical coil springs on top of each other, and you’ve created one giant spring that takes half the force to deflect the same amount as the individual springs. In other words, your series spring has half the spring rate of the parts it’s made of.\n-A system of torsion bars, rocker arms, and actuators controlled by the drive-mode selector in the cabin creates such a system in the GT, with each wheel suspended by two springs acting in series. When the suspension is in Normal mode (corresponding to Normal or Wet drive mode), both springs are engaged, essentially “stacked.” Dialing up Sport drive mode leaves the spring arrangement unchanged, but it activates a firmer setting on the three-mode Multimatic DSSV dampers.\n- \n-When the driver selects Track or Vmax mode, the series-spring setup is deactivated, leaving each corner sprung by a single spring with effectively double the spring rate of the series setup. The ride height drops by 2.0 inches, reducing ground clearance to a mere 2.8 inches, and the dampers go into the firmest of their three calibrations. In Track mode, the aero components go into full downforce mode; in Vmax, the wing and chassis splitters stay in their low-drag setting.\n-In effect, this Track/Vmax suspension setting is like having a unique chassis tune, with different damping and spring rates. The ride height, spring rate, and damping are all optimized for maximum performance, without compromising the comfort of Normal or Sport mode. You get a slammed-down racing suspension in a car that you can still drive on public roads to and from the track. There’s even a Comfort button that further softens the dampers in Normal mode for particularly rough roads.\n- - - New App Will Let Ford GT Fans Save and Share Their Track Exploits - Second Chance: Ford Promises Two More Years of GT Supercar Production - Ford GT: Full Coverage - - -There’s another nifty aspect to this setup: Since Ford runs the suspension and aero systems off the car’s old-fashioned hydraulic power-steering setup, the car switches from normal ride height to Track/Vmax mode rather quickly. There’s also a nose-lift mode for attacking steep driveways without scraping. It picks up the front of the car so quickly, you’ll think you’re at a lowrider-hopping competition.\n-We can’t wait to try out this nifty suspension setup for ourselves.\n- A version of this story originally appeared on Road & Track . \n- ",

      "text": "Now you can spend your holiday vacation beating the crud out of some sand dunes. Photo by Ford \nWe reported earlier that Ford delayed shipments of the 2017 F-150 pickup truck. Ford was quick to note that this is incorrect, and that its 2017 models are now on sale at various dealerships. \nReuters reported that Ford delayed shipments of its 2017 F-150 and Raptor pickup trucks in order to undergo additional testing related to the all-new 10-speed automatic transmission. According to Ford spokesman Mike Levine, this information is incorrect. Links to dealerships , website listings and our friends at Future Motoring show that 2017 F-150s and Raptors are, in fact, being sold at dealers across the country. \nThe 10-speed automatic is the product of a joint venture between General Motors and Ford, so GM products will eventually sport this transmission too. In Ford's case, it comes mated to the automaker's 3.5-liter turbocharged V6 engine, where it boosts fuel economy by single digits compared to GM's old six-speed automatic. \nAutomakers have been extra careful when releasing new products over the last couple years, and for good reason. High-profile screw-ups such as Dieselgate and GM's ignition-switch recall have put the spotlight on automakers to get it right the first time. In that sense, it would have made sense to delay introducing a new transmission. If it were true, that is, which it was not. \nFor the last 34 years, Ford's F-Series trucks have been the bestselling lineup in the United States, and Ford hopes to make it 35 once 2016 wraps up. For the 2015 model year, the automaker was the first pickup manufacturer to move its light-duty pickup to a high-strength aluminum body. \nCorrection, 11:45 a.m. EST: We originally reported that 2017 Ford F-150 shipments were being delayed. The source information was incorrect. We regret the error. 7 Take a look inside Ford's new 3.5-liter EcoBoost V-6 and 10-speed automatic (pictures) Share your voice",

A working gun might be useful, but experience may just be the key to ruling Westworld . So who’s closest to taking over in Season 2? With another mass murder down and both of the park’s founders dead, one thing’s for sure: the hosts are now primed to inherit the earth (or wherever this story takes place).\nBut in this artificial town, there are no safe bets, except that knowledge isn’t necessarily power. As developments seesaw and hopscotch, a girl can really get to know herself and close in on the center of the maze only to have some professional life-ruiner drop her right back where she started. In view of the facts on the ground, the ten characters below are the players who will compete to rule Westworld next season , ranked from faintly possible to most likely to succeed.\n",

Reportedly, the miniature Ford GTs are a part of its 'Speed Champions' series, which honors some of the world's greatest race models. Craig Callum, the designer leading the series for the LEGO race cars, described the project by saying, \"The Ford GT40 is one of the most iconic race cars of all time, and the new Ford GT is just incredible. Designed for children, but with grown-ups fans in mind too, we know these models will be closely scrutinized for authenticity.\" The brand's incorporation of minute details makes this focus clear, with everything from the interior to the sponsor's logos that decorate the side of the LEGO race cars just right.",

      "title": "2017 Dodge Challenger GT: Fun in the Snow With a Little Less Go",
      "text": "enger. \nIn the pony car race Mopar has historically trailed behind General Motors and Ford. However, that underdog status also gives it some wiggle room to experiment. Factory all-wheel drive on a Mustang or Camaro is nearly unfathomable, but you almost expect something like this from Dodge. \nThe addition of a transfer case could help bolster sales of the Challenger in less temperate climes and close the gap between it and the Camaro. However, many would have preferred that FCA somehow made use of the AWD package on the Charger Pursuit V8 reserved for law enforcement. Perhaps it’s saving that as a future ace in the hole, as the \nInstead of the V8 Hemi everyone was hoping for, the all-wheel-drive Challenger has the same Pentastar V6 found in the base SXT. The 3.6-liter thats slotted into the GT is good for 305 horses, matching the 2017 Subaru WRX STI. Still, no one is seriously comparing the Challenger to the rally-inspired STI — despite their closeness in price. \nThe V6 is is teamed up with the expected ZF eight-speed automatic transmission and transfer case from the preexisting AWD Dodge Charger. With front axle disengagement, its essentially the same recipe as the all-wheel variant of the sedan. The only real difference is that the Challenger comes with a little extra horsepower, eight more foot pounds of torque, and two fewer doors. \nIn normal driving conditions, the front axle disconnects and the GT functions as a real-wheel-drive car. Anytime more traction is needed the front wheels rejoin the party and the Challenger is, once again, an all-wheel-drive vehicle. If that isnt to your liking, you can adjust the electronic stability control to continuously send all of the power to the rear and make the extra money you spent for AWD utterly pointless. \nOther features include the familiar UConnect 8.4-inch touchscreen display, paddle shifters, and Dodge’s Super Trak Pack button. Obviously, the vehicles 19-inch aluminum wheels come with all-season tires for handling snowy mountain roads. The interior has nappa leather, heated and ventilated front seats, a heated steering wheel, metal trimmed pedals, and a 276-watt Alpine stereo. For $995, you can get the GT Interior package that adds performance seats with microsuede and an even nicer stereo system. \nThe 2017 Challenger GT starts at $34,490. Dodge says production should begin in January, with deliveries starting shortly thereafter. That means customers won’t need to wait another year to get their all-wheel-drive pony car into “the powder.",

      "text": "Innovation Top 10 innovation trends to watch, according to Ford On Wednesday, the American auto giant released its annual trend report, highlighting three past trends and seven to look for in 2017. Here's what you should know. By Hope Reese | December 7, 2016, 8:44 AM PST Google Plus Image: Ford \nOn Wednesday, Ford unveiled its annual trend report —a look at global \"values, attitudes, and priorities.\" The auto giant calls this work a \"blueprint for understanding how societal shifts are expected to influence brands and their customers.\" The report, which draws on research and input from top thought leaders, includes three previous trends that are still relevant today, as well as seven for 2017 and beyond. \nTechRepublic spoke to Ford's in-house futurist, Sheryl Connelly, for an insider's look into what the trends mean. Here's what you need to know. 1. Trust is the New Black \nAt the top of Ford's list is a recycled principal from its very first trend book from 2013: \"Trust Is the New Black.\" In 2016, Ford said this value holds truer than it did three years ago. According to Connelly, \"mistrust of business, government or media has never been higher.\" As such, she said \"consumers are really drawn to brands that can distinguish themselves as being a trusted brand.\" They also value transparency, and the ability to be an engaged corporate citizen, she said. 2. The Female Frontier \nBack in 2014, Ford saw \"The Female Frontier,\" as \"an upsurge in recognition across women and men alike that rigid gender constructs hinder cultural, social and economic development,\" according to the trend report that year. Connelly told TechRepublic that Ford has \"always recognized that women have grown in influence in both the marketplace and society at large.\" She added that \"one of the more frequently cited statistics by marketers is this notion that women control 85% of all households' decision-making. When it comes to automobiles, [Ford] doesn't build a car that's different for men versus women.\" More about Innovation Read more 3. Sustainability Blues \nSustainability remains an important trend for Ford in 2016. \"From devastating floods, debilitating droughts, water contamination and disputes, concern for the world's most precious resource continues to grow, with consumers increasingly mindful of their water footprint,\" the 2016 trend report says. Ford's 2014 report notes that it was the \"first automotive company to have a water strategy\" and it is \"proud to lead the industry with an 'A' rating from the CDP, the world's only global environmental disclosure agency.\" \nSEE: Ford: Self-driving cars are five years away from changing the world (ZDNet) 4. The Good Life 2.0 \nThe automaker acknowledges that \"bigger isn't always better, and ownership does not equate with happiness.\" Its research shows that \"consumers are finding joy in less, where 'good' encompasses not just possessions, but also experiences and values.\" One way Ford would like to tackle these issues is to continue to create more autonomy for consumers. Connelly noted that \"160 million hours are lost each year to the daily commute or traffic jams.\" To address this, Ford began \"piloting a program with San Francisco to try to understand bike rentals and shuttle services and mass transit and parking services, so that we can help that city figure out how to improve the quality of life for those people that are working in a densely populated area.\" 5. Time Well Spent \n\"In an on-demand world, punctuality is a dying art and procrastination can be a strength,\" Ford said in its press release. \"And there are more and more ways to rationalize how we spend our time—rather than declaring it 'wasted.'\" In response, the company launched its Ford Smart Mobility in January 2016, which will \"use innovation to take it to the next level in connectivity, mobility, autonomous vehicles, the customer experience and big data.\" 6. Decider's Dilemma \nWith the internet, consumers face almost endless choices when it comes to transportation. The result, according to Ford, is there has been a shift in attitudes toward commitment. One response, according to the company, has been its FordPass app, which is \"specifically designed to help each traveler plan his or her journey.\" \nSEE: Why Ford is shifting its focus from cars to 'mobility' (TechRepublic) 7. Tech Spiral \n\"Is technology improving our way of life, or eroding it?\" Ford's report asks. While tech has made certain aspects our lives easier, the company acknowledges that \"consumers are beginning to grapple with its downside—from lower attention spans and retention capacities to allowing their gadgets to do their thinking for them.\" The company recognizes \"that more isn't always better\" and all the innovation it is pushing for should have a purpose. 8. Championing Change \nAccording to Connelly, ever since Henry Ford was in charge of the company, it has followed the \"notion that businesses exist exclusively for the purpose of making people's lives better.\" Following that ethos, Ford said in the report that this mission continues, and that it is \"constantly mindful\" of what's best for its customers, whether it be economically, socially or environmentally. 9. The Parent Trap \nParenting styles have proliferated—and as a result, parents are more open and forthcoming about their struggles, looking to their peers for empathy and advice. Ford measured how parents perceive the role of technology when it comes to their children. Nine countries were asked whether \"the influence of technology on children's development is more positive than negative.\" Technology was viewed as most positive in China, with 81% of parents agreeing, and the least positive in the US, with 46% of parents agreeing. 10. Community Ties \nFinally, Ford asserts that a community \"takes on various forms, shapes and sizes—both on and offline.\" The auto company acknowledges that it not only works with customers, but also with communities. As a result, according to the report, the company has \"teamed up with major global cities to help solve congestion issues and help people move more easily, today and in the future.\" For instance, it recently acquired Chariot , \"a San Francisco-based crowd-sourced shuttle service that plans to grow Ford's dynamic shuttle services globally, providing affordable and convenient transportation to at least five additional markets.\" Stay up on the latest in AI and machine learning - subscribe to TechRepublic's Next Big Thing newsletter!

      "text": "OXON HILL, Md. (AP) - Former Oakland Athletics announcer Bill King has won the Ford C. Frick Award presented by the Hall of Fame for excellence in broadcasting.\nThe award was announced Wednesday at the winter meetings. King died in 2005 after 25 years of calling A's games.\nKing liked to punctuate big plays with his signature exclamation of \"Holy Toledo!\" He also was known for his handlebar mustache and beard, making his face as well as his voice familiar with fans.\nFor nearly a half-century, King called games in the Bay Area. He started out as a fill-in on Giants broadcasts and later did play-by-play for the Raiders and Warriors. He joined the Athletics' crew in 1981.\nKing was among eight finalists on the ballot for the Frick honor. Gary Cohen, Jacques Doucet, Ken Harrelson, Pat Hughes, Mike Krukow, Ned Martin and Dewayne Staats also were considered by a 17-member panel.\nKing will be recognized on July 29 during the Hall of Fame induction weekend in Cooperstown, New York.\n ",

      "text": "OXON HILL, Md. (AP) - Former Oakland Athletics announcer Bill King has won the Ford C. Frick Award presented by the Hall of Fame for excellence in broadcasting.\nThe award was announced Wednesday at the winter meetings. King died in 2005 after 25 years of calling A's games.\nKing liked to punctuate big plays with his signature exclamation of \"Holy Toledo!\" He also was known for his handlebar mustache and beard, making his face as well as his voice familiar with fans.\nFor nearly a half-century, King called games in the Bay Area. He started out as a fill-in on Giants broadcasts and later did play-by-play for the Raiders and Warriors. He joined the Athletics' crew in 1981.\nKing was among eight finalists on the ballot for the Frick honor. Gary Cohen, Jacques Doucet, Ken Harrelson, Pat Hughes, Mike Krukow, Ned Martin and Dewayne Staats also were considered by a 17-member panel.\nKing will be recognized on July 29 during the Hall of Fame induction weekend in Cooperstown, New York.\nCopyright 2016 The Associated Press.

It also sells a small number of vehicles imported from North America and elsewhere. \nChangan Ford, Ford’s passenger car joint venture in China, sold more than 96,000 vehicles, up 14% from November 2015. So far in 2016, Changan Ford has sold nearly 842,000 vehicles, up 14%. \nJiangling Motors, which produces commercial vehicles, reported November sales increased 29% to 26,285 from 20,310 a year earlier. \nSales of Ford's imported vehicles in China edged up 2.5% to 1,637. \nCombining all three categories Ford's China sales for the year through November jumped 10.7% to 1,090,294. \n“Ford is gaining more momentum in China each month and we are on pace for a record year in China,” said Peter Fleet, vice president of marketing, sales and service for Ford Asia Pacific. “We are seeing increasing demand across our lineup, particularly our family of SUVs.” \nThere is some concern in China's auto industry that sales growth could slow next year if the government ends or cuts back on a sales tax cut implemented in 2015 for cars with engines of 1.6 liters or less. The tax reduction is scheduled to expired at the end of 2016. \nReuters reported Tuesday that the government is considering extending the tax cut. \nFord is planning for three different scenarios: expiration of the tax cut, an extension but at a slightly higher rate or continuation of the incentive begun in 2015.

Frick Award presented by the Hall of Fame for excellence in broadcasting.\nThe award was announced Wednesday at the winter meetings. King died in 2005 after 25 years of calling A's games.\nKing liked to punctuate big plays with his signature exclamation of \"Holy Toledo!\" He also was known for his handlebar mustache and beard, making his face as well as his voice familiar with fans.\nFor nearly a half-century, King called games in the Bay Area. He started out as a fill-in on Giants broadcasts and later did play-by-play for the Raiders and Warriors. He joined the Athletics' crew in 1981.\nKing was among eight finalists on the ballot for the Frick honor. Gary Cohen, Jacques Doucet, Ken Harrelson, Pat Hughes, Mike Krukow, Ned Martin and Dewayne Staats also were considered by a 17-member panel.\nKing will be recognized on July 29 during the Hall of Fame induction weekend in Cooperstown, New York.\n  MLB Baseball Pro Men Associated Press",

      "title": "Nocturnal Animals",
      "text": "By Rick Kisonak click to enlarge MILD ANIMALS Among the pleasures of Ford’s sophomore offering is a cheeky, knowing portrait of LA’s privileged class. \"Enjoy the absurdity of our world,\" advises Michael Sheen as a gay socialite in a glittering lavender blazer. \"Our world is a lot less painful than the real world.\" He's a guest at a party thrown by gallery curator Susan Morrow (Amy Adams), and he's just given us Nocturnal Animals in a nutshell. \nFashion mogul Tom Ford's second foray into filmmaking doesn't merely fulfill the promise of 2009's A Single Man . It shatters expectations, establishing the writer-director as an artist on par with Alfred Hitchcock, Paulo Sorrentino or David Lynch — and, at various points, he pays stylistic homage to each. It's the most aesthetically audacious, thematically visceral movie you'll see this year. \nThe world of which Sheen speaks is that of contemporary Los Angeles privilege. Susan is married to a handsome power broker (Armie Hammer) who she knows is unfaithful and sinking in financial quicksand. She lives in a modernist steel mansion and has just overseen the opening of an outrageous installation in which obese middle-aged women recline on pedestals, naked but for drum-majorette accessories. \nSusan feels guilty for contributing to our \"junk culture.\" For abandoning her artistic ambitions. For having everything yet not being happy. And for a dark secret that's the reason for everything to come. \nA package arrives in the morning mail. Inside she finds the manuscript of a novel written by her ex, Edward (Jake Gyllenhaal). It's titled Nocturnal Animals , an allusion to a nickname Edward gave Susan because of her insomnia. With her husband away on business and the help dismissed for the weekend, the scarlet-haired woman slips on a pair of chic black glasses and settles in for what proves a most unsettling read. \nEdward's novel tells the terrifying story of a West Texas teacher named Tony who loads his scarlet-haired wife (Isla Fisher) and teenage daughter (Ellie Bamber) into his vintage Benz for a road trip. That night, within moments of the girl losing her cell signal, the family is run off the road by a gang of rednecks led by a seriously creepy sociopath named Ray (Aaron Taylor-Johnson). What happens next ranks with the most pulse-pounding sequences in cinematic history. Susan is simultaneously hypnotized and horrified. She has a scarlet-haired daughter, too. \nMasterfully edited, the movie's LA and Texas scenes are eerily intercut so as to echo one another. Ford's designer eye serves him well, contrasting the colors and textures of the two worlds — one antiseptic, the other wild, almost primeval. And what a simple but brilliant idea it is to have Susan visualize Tony as Edward. \nGyllenhaal is highly convincing in both roles, as a wronged lover glimpsed in flashback and as a family man who crosses moral lines he never imagined he could in search of revenge. Revenge, in fact, takes a variety of forms in the film. A painting consisting solely of the word in bold black letters hangs in Susan's gallery. And, as becomes clearer with each page, Edward's novel is itself a long-planned form of payback. \nJust when you think Nocturnal Animals couldn't get any better, Michael Shannon materializes in Edward's tale as Texas lawman Bobby Andes (\"I look into things around here.\"). Dying of lung cancer, he doesn't have time for niceties such as due process. Like a chain-smoking Virgil showing Dante around the circles of hell, Andes takes the devastated stranger under his wing, explains how the world works in his godforsaken neck of the woods and, when the time comes, puts a gun in Tony's hand. If you want suspense, desert-dry dialogue, exquisite visuals and a time bomb of a plot, you're in luck. They're just Ford's style. Got something to say?

      "text": "Ford makes contingency plans in case of China year-end tax surprise Tue Dec 6, 2016 11:37pm EST [ - ] Text [ + ] \nBy Jake Spring \nBEIJING (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co F.N expects China to wait until the last possible moment to announce whether it will extend a tax cut on small engine cars set to expire at year's end and is making contingency plans for various outcomes, an executive said on Wednesday. \nChina's auto industry association, executives and analysts have warned of a potentially steep drop off in sales growth next year if the policy, which halves the purchase tax on cars with engines of 1.6 litres or below, expires as planned at the end of 2016. \nA government official said in October that the country is considering extending the tax, originally instituted in late 2015 to stimulate the market as vehicle sales flat lined amid a weakening economy. \n\"If there is an announcement about a continuation, I would not be surprised if that announcement is made on literally the last day of year,\" Peter Fleet, Ford's head of sales and marketing for Asia Pacific, told Reuters in an interview. \nIn the face of such uncertainty, the U.S. automaker is planning for three different scenarios, he said: the tax cut expires, it is extended at a reduced rate, or continues in full. \n\"We're proceeding on the basis that the purchase tax incentive ends at the end of the year,\" Fleet said. \n\"We'll adjust our plans as quickly as we need to in the new year if there is a different set of assumptions.\" \nFundamental demand for cars will continue to be strong and the tax cut will only result in a marginal change in demand, he said, declining to give exact predictions for 2017 auto sales.

      "text": "Ford stockpiles best-selling F-150 trucks to test new transmission Tue Dec 6, 2016 5:25pm EST [ - ] Text [ + ] \nBy Joseph White \nDETROIT (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co F.N is stockpiling 2017 model F-150 trucks, delaying delivery to dealers while it runs final tests on a new 10-speed transmission, a top executive told Reuters. \nThe trucks should be delivered by the end of the year, Joe Hinrichs, head of Ford's automotive operations in the Americas said in an interview on Monday. \n\"We are launching the new Raptor and F-150 with the new 10-speed transmission,\" Hinrichs said. “We continued building but we’re holding (trucks) longer so we could do more testing and make sure everything is right before we release them,” Hinrichs said. \nExtra testing is surely prudent in an industry plagued by frequent and costly automotive safety recalls. But Ford's shipping delays come as rival General Motors Co GM.N is aggressively trying to cut into Ford's lead in U.S. pickup sales. \nTaking aim at the \"Built Ford Tough\" ad campaign, as part of a bid dominate the lucrative light truck and sport utility vehicle market, GM rolled out a series of hard-hitting TV commercials over the summer. Punching holes, literally, in the lightweight aluminum beds featured in Ford's new line of pickups, the ads tout the alleged advantages of the roll-formed, high-strength steel beds in GM's trucks. \nThe Ford F-series line of pickups has been the best-selling model line in the United States for 34 years, and Hinrichs predicted 2016 will make it 35 years in a row. \nFord did not disclose how many F-150 pickups it is holding. But several hundred vehicles were stored earlier this week behind a chain link fence on an empty factory parking lot in Detroit. More were parked on Tuesday near the Detroit-Wayne County airport. Many were well-equipped Limited or Platinum models with sticker prices above $50,000. \nFord designed the 10-speed transmission jointly with GM. The 2017 model F-150s equipped with a 3.5 liter six-cylinder engine and the 10-speed automatic gearbox get a one mile per gallon improvement in fuel economy over comparable 2016 models with six-speed transmissions, according to federal fuel economy data.

      "text": "OXON HILL, Md. (AP) - Former Oakland Athletics announcer Bill King has won the Ford C. Frick Award presented by the Hall of Fame for excellence in broadcasting.\nThe award was announced Wednesday at the winter meetings. King died in 2005 after 25 years of calling A's games.\nKing liked to punctuate big plays with his signature exclamation of \"Holy Toledo!\" He also was known for his handlebar mustache and beard, making his face as well as his voice familiar with fans.\nFor nearly a half-century, King called games in the Bay Area. He started out as a fill-in on Giants broadcasts and later did play-by-play for the Raiders and Warriors. He joined the Athletics' crew in 1981.\nKing was among eight finalists on the ballot for the Frick honor. Gary Cohen, Jacques Doucet, Ken Harrelson, Pat Hughes, Mike Krukow, Ned Martin and Dewayne Staats also were considered by a 17-member panel.\nKing will be recognized on July 29 during the Hall of Fame induction weekend in Cooperstown, New York.\nCopyright 2016 The Associated Press.

El anuncio fue publicado a finales de noviembre en Facebook y cuenta con una SUV Edge de Ford avanzando por un camino, justo entre las barras negras que permite ver el formato del video nos hace ignorar un elemento que se oculta entre el punto ciego del vehículo. Dos dedos se extienden y tiran de las barras negras de distancia, revelando a un motociclista oculto en el punto ciego del camino. El anuncio hace un buen trabajo al usar video vertical para explicar Blind spot Info System (BLIS), una característica de los vehículos Ford que te permite ver dentro de tus puntos ciegos y evitar accidentes viales por distracciones. La creación BBR Saatchi & Saatchi consiguió más de 600 mil visitas en sólo cuatro días. Actualmente el material registra más de un millón de reproducciones, de acuerdo con el perfil de Facebook de Ford Israel.",

      "text": "OXON HILL, Md. - (AP) -- Former Oakland Athletics announcer Bill King has won the Ford C. Frick Award presented by the Hall of Fame for excellence in broadcasting.\nThe award was announced Wednesday at the winter meetings. King died in 2005 after 25 years of calling A's games.\nKing liked to punctuate big plays with his signature exclamation of \"Holy Toledo!\" He also was known for his handlebar mustache and beard, making his face as well as his voice familiar with fans.\nFor nearly a half-century, King called games in the Bay Area. He started out as a fill-in on Giants broadcasts and later did play-by-play for the Raiders and Warriors. He joined the Athletics' crew in 1981.\nadvertisement | advertise on newsday\nKing was among eight finalists on the ballot for the Frick honor. Gary Cohen, Jacques Doucet, Ken Harrelson, Pat Hughes, Mike Krukow, Ned Martin and Dewayne Staats also were considered by a 17-member panel.\nKing will be recognized on July 29 during the Hall of Fame induction weekend in Cooperstown, New York.\n ",

      "text": "Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford's Star Wars Affair Was News to Mark Hamill \n\"They could've been doing it in front of me and I wouldn't have noticed.\" Getty By Emma Dibdin Dec 7, 2016 Carrie Fisher's revelation last month that she had an affair with Harrison Ford on the set of Star Wars was mind-blowing for a whole lot of people–including their co-star Mark Hamill, who had no idea anything was going on back in 1976. During an interview with Entertainment Tonight , Hamill admitted he was \"blissfully unaware\" Fisher and Ford were having off-screen sleepovers. \"Which was good for me because I think it might have been a distraction if I'd known what was going on.\" Advertisement - Continue Reading Below \"I was so self-involved at that point, they could've been doing it in front of me and I wouldn't have noticed,\" he added. \"I was single and had my own agenda.\" Between the fact Ford was married at the time, the fact Fisher was still a teenager, and the fact that their make out sessions apparently felt like \"fishing face-to-face\" , Hamill's probably right to call his ignorance of the whole thing \"blissful.\" More from Esquire: ",

      "text": "  7th,   1 December 7th,   \nYesterday, we reported on how Ford CEO Mark Fields is telling anybody who will listen that people have little to no interest in buying electric cars , a message we are getting from BMW as well. Today, Inside EVs released their most recent EV sales figures, which show that one out of every ten Ford Fusions sold is a the plug-in hybrid Energi model. In fact, Fusion Energi sales are up 70% for the year through the end of November. \nSince January, sales of the Fusion Energi have surged, despite the fact that gasoline prices remain at historically low levels. Fields may believe that consumer have little interest in electric cars, but he clearly overlooks their strong interest in cars that are fuel efficient. Last month, Ford sold 1,817 Fusion Energi plug-in hybrids. That is up 92% over November, 2015. In all, the Fusion is one of Ford’s best selling cars, accounting for 44% of all its car sales last month. Since the Fusion Energi was introduced, Ford has sold over 42,000 of them. \nWhat’s the takeaway from all this? Mark Fields should definitely get out of his office more and talk to his senior managers. While he is yapping about how there is no market for electric cars, the market is making him look like a fool. Part of the surge in Fusion Energi sales may be traceable to Ford’s claim that it has the longest range of any PHEV in America. While that is technically true, the vast majority of that range comes from burning gasoline in the car’s internal combustion engine. The Fusion Energi only has a fairly modest range on battery power of just 21 miles. \nThe success of the Fusion Energi is good news for one of Ford’s competitors. The new Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid minivan is also a plug-in hybrid and actually has even more total range than the Fusion Energi. It has a battery only range of 30 miles, which is close to how far the average American driver travels during a normal day. That means the owner of a Pacifica Hybrid could potentially drive most of the time on electric power alone. \nInterests in plug-in hybrids seems to be climbing as more and more people learn how efficient they are. Although they are not true battery electric vehicles, they offer many of the same benefits at significantly lower cost. Plug-in hybrids may prove to be the critical link between conventional cars and electric cars. In battery only mode, the look, feel, and sound like an electric car. That’s a good thing. The more people who learn the pleasures of driving on electrons rather than hydrocarbons, the sooner the electric car revolution will be complete.",

      "text": "  UHV Arts & Sciences students take part in special projects for new honors track Cherish Ford, a   senior from Wharton, presents a project Friday about the senses during the UHV School of Arts & Sciences Honors Track Colloquium. Seven honors track students presented projects in front of UHV faculty, staff and students. \nOn the surface, “Race, Class and Gender” appeared to be just another class Ashley Yaws was taking to obtain   bachelor’s degrees in psychology and history. \nBut thanks to the UHV School of Arts & Sciences’ new honors track, Yaws, a senior from Edna, taught the class one day and finished the semester by presenting a special project about media discrimination. Justin Bell \n“We’re not just learning how to read books and take notes,” Yaws said. “The honors track gives us a chance to dive deeper into what we are interested in doing in the future, and it gives us a chance to network to make that future possible.” \nA total of 18 students participated in the honors track in the fall, the first semester it was offered. Justin Bell, honors track director and an assistant professor of philosophy, said the initiative offers students a chance for increased engagement and to delve further into course subjects. \n“The students supplement their normal coursework with projects that require them to expand on the themes of the course,” Bell said. “It’s not just a matter of doing more work. It’s a chance to interact with their professors on projects that suit their individual interests.” \nStudents involved in the honors track can choose one course each semester to perform the honors work. All disciplines within the school are available. Students in the fall took honors track courses in biology, history, humanities, psychology, English and digital gaming. Jeffrey Di Leo \n“It’s important to challenge and reward our high-performing students,” said Jeffrey Di Leo, dean of the UHV School of Arts & Sciences. “I’m encouraged by what I saw in the first semester of the honors track. Our students embraced the chance to work closely with professors and go deeper into course concepts. The end result was a series of thoughtful presentations.” \nSeven honors track students presented projects Friday at a School of Arts & Sciences colloquium. Project topics included “Aristotle’s Influence on Science,”“Psychiatric Hospitals for Native Americans” and “Robby the Loot-Collecting Robot.” Yaws’ project, “Sound of Silence: Media Ignorance and Discrimination,” related today’s media environment with historical aspects from the Civil Rights movement in the 1960s as well as issues occuring in the 1930s and 1940s. \n“A lot of it had to with the media's coverage of the Dakota Access pipeline as well as how and why certain people are cut out of the media,” Yaws said. \nFolake Olayinka, a senior biology and psychology major from Houston, presented “Autism and Genetic, Environment and Brain Abnormalities.” \n“It was nerve wracking at first, but after a lot of research and memorization, I was confident and excited to talk about it,” Olayinka said. “The colloquium was a great event. It was nice showing faculty members and fellow students what we’ve been working on. I learned a lot listening to the other presentations.” \nTo participate in the honors track, students must declare an Arts & Science major and have 45 or more semester credit hours and a 3.5 grade-point average. Besides working one-on-one with professors, honors track students are invited to special events. In October, students took a field trip to the Houston Museum of African American Culture and the Houston Museum of Natural Science. \nStudents also are asked to put together a capstone project their senior year. The academic or creative work binds their studies together, Bell said. \nHonors track graduates will receive recognition at School of Arts & Sciences events and can wear special regalia at commencement. Having the honors track on a resume also could help students when applying for jobs or graduate school. \n“The idea behind the honors track was to create a venue where our students and faculty find ways to develop an intellectual relationship, in addition to regular classroom work,” Bell said. “This way, professors get to know our students better and are able to write letters of recommendation. We want to help them get into graduate schools and find jobs.” \nYaws said students are networking and reaching out to people who could potentially help them in the long run. Some are looking into internships. She eventually would like to work in academia. \n“One of the pros of the honors course is you can use some of the materials to your advantage,” Yaws said. “To have a chance to go more in-depth and work one-on-one with a professor gives me a little more footing. I work better when I can talk with someone and throw ideas out and about. Feedback is big for me.” \nFor more information about joining the honors track, contact Bell at or 361-570-4312.  ",

King died in 2005 after 25 years of calling A's games.\nKing liked to punctuate big plays with his signature exclamation of \"Holy Toledo!\" He also was known for his handlebar moustache and beard, making his face as well as his voice familiar with fans.\nFor nearly a half-century, King called games in the Bay Area. He started out as a fill-in on Giants broadcasts and later did play-by-play for the Raiders and Warriors. He joined the Athletics' crew in 1981.\nNew York Mets general Sandy Alderson was the longtime GM of the A's in the 1980s and '90s, when the Bash Brothers rose to prominence. Alderson said he enjoyed King's interest in sports and other fields.\n\"Outstanding! He was so fantastic. What I loved about him was he was so unlike most baseball announcers. He was very erudite, loved language, had great command of it, but infused that language with tremendous energy and enthusiasm and passion,\" Alderson said.\n\"He felt strongly about certain topics, both in the game and out of the game. He loved German food. He loved the opera. He always drove a car that was at least 20 years old and was just an incredible personality, an eccentric in a positive way that stood out even in the Bay Area, which is full of eccentrics,\" he said. \"I think one of the reasons he didn't get in earlier is because he was so well known for his other sports, as well, and people forgot how good he was in baseball.\"\nKing was among eight finalists on the ballot for the Frick honour . Gary Cohen, Jacques Doucet, Ken Harrelson, Pat Hughes, Mike Krukow, Ned Martin and Dewayne Staats also were considered by a 17-member panel.\nKing will be recognized on July 29 during the Hall of Fame induction weekend in Cooperstown, New York.\nThe Associated Press",

      "text": "View all Source: Ford \nIt’s one of the great hypocrisy of fandom: When you guys win, it’s “We,” when they lose, its “Them.” Honestly, it isn’t that much different in the automotive world. Everyone has their pet brands, and everyone knows that their brands have all made awful, awful mistakes. In almost every business, products come out that look like a mistake as soon as they leave the factory, but due to the auto industry’s inherent exposure to the public, automotive flops tend to be more spectacular than most — and potentially more damaging to the brand responsible. \nHere we’ve compiled a collection of 10 of the most high-profile offenders. Although these cars may have seemed right at the time to somebody, they probably should have been put through a little more development — and at least a focus group or two. 1. 1975-’80 AMC Pacer Source: YouTube \nIn the 1970s, tiny Wisconsin-based American Motors was strapped for cash, and increasingly relying on its aging Gremlin/Hornet platform (which would eventually underpin its Concord, Spirit, and Eagle models). That’s what makes the Pacer so baffling. On paper, it was a pioneer: The second American car to have rack-and-pinion steering, an integrated rollbar, a longer passenger door for rear seat access, and an interior designed for safety and class-leading space. But in reality, it was “ The Flying Fishbowl ,” a gawky, unbelievably hot (all that glass), and expensive failure. The struggling company sank $60 million (nearly $360 million today) into developing the car “from the inside out.” Customers took one look at the slow (100 horsepower), heavy (nearly two tons) Pacer, and said “no, thanks.” In 2007, Hagerty Insurance issued a poll asking for the enthusiasts to name the worst car design of all time, and the Pacer was bestowed with the unfortunate honor.

      "text": "December 7, 2016 — American | 9 Comments Prairie Bronze 289/4-Speed: 1965 Ford Mustang \nThis 1965 Ford mustang isn’t claimed to be matching-numbers or all original, but it looks sharp in factory-style Prairie Bronze over Magnum 500’s and raised white letters. Mechanical spec is nice too, with a four-barrel 289 up front and 4-speed in the middle. Many details suggest it may have started as a lower trim car, but what can be seen looks good, and the seller is open to trades for pretty much anything on four wheels, including tractors, 4×4’s, cars, ATV’s and trucks. Find it here on Craigslist near Detroit, Michigan for $21,300. \nThe ad is pretty brief, but this color always looks great on coupes, and finish looks to be of a nice quality. Sheet metal is straight, and shutlines appear to be lining up well too. Note the GT stripes, incorrectly mixed with quarter panel bright trim and pony badges on the front fenders–the former would have been deleted and the latter replaced with GT badging if this were a true GT. Deleted rocker trim is correct however, and nit picks aside, it remains a very sharp looking car. \nThe interior shows what looks like nice upholstery, door panels and a decent dash pad, but black carpets don’t gel terribly well and seem a bit tired, too. True GT’s had a five-dial dash, and the lack of a center console is another giveaway. These things can be added though, and we’d start with the carpets and work up towards dialing in the rest over time. \nWiring could stand to be cleaned up a bit, but it’s good to see a four-barrel 289 in the engine bay. The seller doesn’t note any spec, but manual brakes and steering appear to be on the menu. \nThough a bit of a mixed bag when it comes to details, the main ingredients all look right, and everything else can be fixed while enjoying the drive.

That according to the Insurance Bureau of Canada (IBC), which has published its annual list of the top 10 most frequently stolen vehicles in Canada \n“For the second consecutive year, auto theft across Canada has ticked higher,” Bill Adams, vice president of IBC Western and Pacific said. “After large declines in auto theft activity over the last decade, the number of stolen vehicles has gone up six per cent nationally compared to last year.” \nFord F-Series trucks dominate the list of most frequently stolen vehicles in Western provinces. \nThis year’s 10 most frequently stolen vehicles in IBC’s Western and Pacific region are: \n1. 2006 Ford F-350 Super Duty 4WD Pickup2. 2007 Ford F-350 Super Duty 4WD Pickup3. 2005 Ford F-350 Super Duty 4WD Pickup4. 2005 Ford F-250 Super Duty 4WD Pickup5. 2003 Ford F-250 Super Duty 4WD Pickup6. 2007 Ford F-250 Super Duty 4WD Pickup7. 2006 Ford F-250 Super Duty 4WD Pickup8. 2004 Ford F-350 Super Duty 4WD Pickup9. 2003 Ford F-350 Super Duty 4WD Pickup10. 2002 Ford F-250 Super Duty 4WD Pickup \n“We also see from this list that criminals continue to favour large, older, high-end Ford F-series vehicles,” Adams said. \nIBC says there are measures you can take to protect your vehicle including: \n• Never leave your vehicle running when unattended.• Park in well-lit areas.• When parking your car, always close the windows and lock the doors.• Put valuables and packages in the trunk, where they’re out of sight.• Keep your car in the garage at night.• Don’t leave personal information in the glove box. Take your insurance and ownership documents with you when you park your vehicle. \n",

      "text": "OXON HILL, Md. (AP) -- Former Oakland Athletics announcer Bill King has won the Ford C. Frick Award presented by the Hall of Fame for excellence in broadcasting.\nThe award was announced Wednesday at the winter meetings. King died in 2005 after 25 years of calling A's games.\nKing liked to punctuate big plays with his signature exclamation of ''Holy Toledo!'' He also was known for his handlebar mustache and beard, making his face as well as his voice familiar with fans.\nFor nearly a half-century, King called games in the Bay Area. He started out as a fill-in on Giants broadcasts and later did play-by-play for the Raiders and Warriors. He joined the Athletics' crew in 1981.\nNew York Mets general Sandy Alderson was the longtime GM of the A's in the 1980s and '90s, when the Bash Brothers rose to prominence. Alderson said he enjoyed King's interest in sports and other fields.\n''Outstanding! He was so fantastic. What I loved about him was he was so unlike most baseball announcers. He was very erudite, loved language, had great command of it, but infused that language with tremendous energy and enthusiasm and passion,'' Alderson said.\n''He felt strongly about certain topics, both in the game and out of the game. He loved German food. He loved the opera. He always drove a car that was at least 20 years old and was just an incredible personality, an eccentric in a positive way that stood out even in the Bay Area, which is full of eccentrics,'' he said. ''I think one of the reasons he didn't get in earlier is because he was so well known for his other sports, as well, and people forgot how good he was in baseball.''\nKing was among eight finalists on the ballot for the Frick honor. Gary Cohen, Jacques Doucet, Ken Harrelson, Pat Hughes, Mike Krukow, Ned Martin and Dewayne Staats also were considered by a 17-member panel.\nKing will be recognized on July 29 during the Hall of Fame induction weekend in Cooperstown, New York.\n''Listening to Bill King was like watching the game on the radio,'' Raiders owner Mark Davis said in a statement. ''I once complimented him on his basketball commentary and how he was able to do it so well despite how fast the action is. He said, 'Mark, basketball is actually the easiest sport to call. Baseball is the toughest because of all the dead time you have to fill.' We are very happy for Bill and his family for being honored with the Ford Frick Award.''",
