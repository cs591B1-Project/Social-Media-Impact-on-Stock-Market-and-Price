      "text": "\n(Adds details from Wells Fargo, Bank of America) \nBy Olivia Oran \nNov 7 (Reuters) - U.S. banks, including Morgan Stanley , JPMorgan Chase & Co and Goldman Sachs Group Inc , are bracing for potential tumult on financial markets in the wake of Tuesday's U.S. election. \nBank preparations ahead of the U.S. election reflect their experience following Britain's shock vote to leave the European Union in June, when the S&P 500 fell 3.6 percent the day after the poll. \nMorgan Stanley told staff to consider using stop-loss orders, an automated trading mechanism that is meant to sell an investor's position as soon as a stock hits a preset level, if the election result causes trading volumes and volatility to spike. \nThe bank also told advisers in its wealth management unit to prepare for election-related conversations with clients and pointed them to relevant pieces of research, according to a Nov. 7 memo reviewed by Reuters. \nTraders expect U.S. stock prices to swing by about 2 percent in either direction on Wednesday, the day after the election, based on the price of S&P 500 index options. Options on the PowerShares QQQ Trust Russell 2000 ETF, are pricing similarly large swings before the week is out. \nSome banks are projecting a more extreme drop in the event of a victory for Republican Donald Trump, with Citigroup Inc estimating that a Trump victory could trigger a 3 percent to 5 percent selloff for the S&P 500. \nU.S. stocks rose on Monday as Democrat Hillary Clinton's prospects brightened after the Federal Bureau of Investigation said it would not press criminal charges related to her use of a private email server. \nInvestors have tended to see Clinton as a more status quo candidate, while Trump's stances on foreign policy, trade and immigration have unnerved the market. \nAfter the election, Morgan Stanley will hold a call for financial advisers and clients with Chief Investment Officer Mike Wilson on Wednesday morning. \nGoldman Sachs is also hosting a call for its private wealth clients led by Chief Investment Officer Sharmin Mossavar-Rahmani and members of Washington lobbying groups Elmendorf Ryan and CGCN Group, according to an invitation sent to clients. \nMore than half of the stock and bond fund managers polled by Northern Trust in the third quarter said they expected the election to cause a large increase in market volatility. \nOn Tuesday night, when results begin to come in, JPMorgan will have additional traders on duty in New York to back up its Asian trading teams in case of surges in volume, said bank spokesman Brian Marchiony. \nThe extra staffing is similar to what the bank did during Britain's vote to leave the European Union, he said. \nOn Wednesday morning, JPMorgan will hold conference calls to discuss the election results and investment implications with customers, including private banking clients, investment managers and institutional clients. \nA Citigroup spokeswoman described similar plans, including overnight staff in New York on the trading floor. \nBank of America Corp and Wells Fargo & Co are also hosting calls for members of their wealth management divisions. \n(Additional reporting by David Henry, Elizabeth Dilts and Saqib Ahmed in New York; Editing by Carmel Crimmins, Dan Grebler and Lisa Shumaker) Read the original article on Reuters .

      "title": "Bank of America's stock falls after analyst abandons bullish rating - MarketWatch",
      "text": "Shares of Bank of America Corp. BAC, -0.62% shed 0.8% in morning trade, to pull back from the highest close of the year in the previous session, after Deutsche Bank analyst Matt O'Connor indicated he was no longer bullish given the lack of upside potential. O'Connor cut his rating to hold from buy. He kepts his stock price target at $18, which was less than 7% above current levels. For Deutsche Bank, a bullish buy rating means the expected total return for the stock is 10% or more over a 12-month period. \"Upside to the stock seems increasingly dependent on a pickup in economic activity, higher interest rates, and stronger capital market revenues as more company specific positives...seemed priced in,\" O'Connor wrote in a note to clients. He also downgraded Citizens Financial Group Inc. CFG, -2.39% to hold from buy. Bank of America's stock had closed Monday up 2.8% at the highest level since Dec. 30. Year to date, it has ticked up 0.3%, while the SPDR Financial ETF XLF, -0.53% has gained 2.7% and the S&P 500 SPX, -0.20% has tacked on 4.1%.",

      "text": "by Gary Leff on November 8, 2016 \nMerrill Lynch was acquired by Bank of America during the financial crises. It was effectively a bail out. Of course that put Bank of America on the hook for a good deal of liability. It also means that they issue the Merrill Lynch credit card , and they apparently want new cardmembers because they’ve got an aggressive sign up bonus for the product: 50,000 points after $3,000 in spend within the first 90 days. \nThis is a no annual fee card that will give you a Delta SkyClub membership after $50,000 spend in a year (or choose a $200 travel credit instead). I wonder how they’re able to do this given Delta’s co-brand exclusivity with American Express or rather I’m surprised that they’re able to do this and that the American Express agreement doesn’t preclude it. \nSeattle SkyClub \nPoints are worth a penny apiece as statement credits or two cents apiece towards travel under some specific circumstances, so the signup bonus can buy $1000 in travel. \nYou have to redeem 25,000 at a time. So a $500 ticket can be redeemed for 25,000 points. But your points are only worth a penny apiece towards amounts over $500 in airfare (redeemed in 2500 point increments). \nThe 2 cent value for your first $500 only applies to American, British Airways, Delta, and United. Other carriers get you just 1.67 cents in value for that first $500 (30,000 points for up to $500 in airfare). \nBasically you want to play ‘Price is Right’ with this card’s redemptions: as close to a $500 airline ticket as possible without going over, and restricted to airlines where you get the best value. \nIt’s a good signup bonus from an issuer many don’t have a ton of cards from, but there are some hoops to go through to maximize value.",

      "text": "Justices weigh fair lending lawsuit against Bank of America, Wells Fargo Greg Nash By Lydia Wheeler - 11/08/16 12:35 PM EST \nThe Supreme Court appeared divided Tuesday over whether the city of Miami could sue Bank of America and Wells Fargo for discriminating against African-American and Latino residents when issuing mortgage loans. \nJustice Elena Kagan struggled with the bank’s argument that Miami had not shown that discrimination was the primary cause of the city's injuries. ADVERTISEMENT Under the Fair Housing Act (FHA), she said, the city is considered an “aggrieved person.”\n“This is their own interest in maintaining their communities free of the kind of racial discrimination that the Act says causes neighborhood blight,” she said. \nMiami claims Wells Fargo and Bank of America violated the FHA by steering minority residents toward predatory mortgages that caused properties throughout the city to fall into foreclosure. \nAs a result, the city is seeking monetary damages for the property tax revenue it lost due to neighborhood blight and the money it had to spend on city services responding to it, such as police, fire and building inspectors. \nWells Fargo and Bank of America, however, claim Miami is only trying to recoup the money it lost in the 2008 financial crisis and that it doesn’t have standing to sue under the FHA. \nMiami’s attorney Robert Peck denied that claim. \n“If the 2008 financial crisis was, indeed, the purpose of this lawsuit, then the statute of limitations, which is two years, would have ended this lawsuit a long time ago,” he said. \nBut Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Anthony Kennedy wanted to know if neighborhood businesses that have a vested interest in a vibrant community would also be able to claim they were injured by the bank’s discriminatory practices. \nPeck argued they would not because they are commercial property owners. \n“The city has a special interest in fair housing and an integrated community that the FHA is designed to vindicate,” he said. “The employer does not. The local dry cleaner does not.\" \nBecause the damages being sought by the city don't appear to be going to the residents who received the bad loans, Kennedy asked if the city considered itself a direct victim of discrimination. \nWhen Peck said it does, Roberts pushed back, arguing the city's injuries are a result of the direct injury its residents suffered. \n\"You don't start with you,\" he said. \"I understand your argument that you're down the line, but I don't see how you can say that your loss of property taxes is a direct injury.\" \nThe banks' attorney, Neal Katyal, warned the justices that a ruling in favor of Miami would allow any city to claim it has been discriminated against under the Fair Housing Act. \n“There are 19,300 cities in America,\" he said. \"If you adopt their theory, you would be allowing all of them to bring complaints just like this.\" \nUpdated: 1:07 p.m.",

      "text": "Order Reprint of this Story \nU.S. Supreme Court justices signaled they may divide over the ability of cities to use the Fair Housing Act to sue banks for discriminatory lending practices that contribute to urban blight. \nHearing arguments in Washington as the country went to the polls to choose the next president, the high court grappled with a case that grew out of the subprime mortgage crisis. \nA federal appeals court read the Fair Housing Act as giving Miami the right to sue Bank of America Corp., Wells Fargo & Co. and Citigroup Inc. Miami says the banks targeted minorities for riskier and costly loans, leading to foreclosures that cost the city property-tax revenues and forced it to spend more on police and fire services. \nSome of the court’s liberal justices indicated through their questions that they would vote to let the cases go forward. Justice Elena Kagan suggested the dispute was at the heart of what the landmark 1968 law was designed to address. \n“Everything about this complaint is about racial segregation, it seems to me,” Kagan said. \nBut two potential swing votes, Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Anthony Kennedy, suggested they saw a need to limit the types of suits that could be filed under the law. Roberts called Miami’s injury “derivative.” \n“I don’t see how you can say that your loss of property taxes is a direct injury,” he told the city’s lawyer, Robert Peck. \nThe Election Day argument was a relatively low-key affair, with Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas asking no questions and Justice Stephen Breyer saying far less than usual. One possibility is that the shorthanded court could divide 4-4, an outcome that would let Miami press ahead without setting a nationwide precedent. \nCharlotte-based Bank of America and San Francisco-based Wells Fargo say Congress didn’t intend to allow private lawsuits by a plaintiff who wasn’t a victim of discrimination and whose interests are so far removed from the alleged wrongdoing. \nThe banks’ lawyer, Neal Katyal, said the city was “borrowing someone else’s anti-discrimination interests.” Citigroup isn’t directly involved in the Supreme Court appeal. \nThe Fair Housing Act says an “aggrieved person” may sue. In 2011 the Supreme Court interpreted similar language in the federal job-discrimination law to mean that only people within the law’s “zone of interests” could sue. \nMiami and the Obama administration say the 2011 decision left intact earlier rulings suggesting that the Fair Housing Act was drafted broadly. They say the only restrictions on who can sue come from the Constitution and its requirement that a plaintiff suffered an injury that a court would be able to redress. \nSimilar suits have been filed around the country, including claims by Los Angeles and three Georgia counties. \nPeck told the court that the cities of Baltimore and Memphis, Tennessee, had settled similar claims for less than $10 million. \n“We not talking about huge sums of money,” he said. \nThe cases are Bank of America v. Miami, 15-1111, and Wells Fargo v. Miami, 15-1112. Related content",

Each day our partners at Kindred work hard to improve the lives of more than 1 million patients we care for annually. The excellent care delivery and clinical outcomes we generate are the direct results of their efforts. Last night we reported third quarter results within our guidance range. Like many of our peers who have already reported, results across our various lines of business were mixed. We had outstanding performance in certain businesses, such as Kindred at Home and Kindred rehab services, and challenging results in other businesses, specifically those with skilled nursing center exposure. Before I dive into a detailed discussion of our results in each business, I'd like to outline the proactive strategic steps we are taking to position Kindred for long-term success against the backdrop of dynamic changes in the healthcare service industry. Last night we announced the strategic decision to exit the skilled nursing facility business, which is the final step in a process that began for us 15 years ago when Kindred operated over 300 skilled nursing facilities. A full exit of this business, together with the significant cost realignment initiative we are undertaking in connection with the exit, are substantial steps forward in our effort to continue to transform Kindred's strategy and growth profile to enhance shareholder value. We're pleased to be working with Ventas to finalize an agreement that will create value for Ventas and Kindred shareholders, and facilitate Kindred's exit from the skilled nursing business. Over the past few years, we have dramatically changed the composition of Kindred; and, along with that, the drivers of growth and profitability. Following completion of the exit of the skilled nursing business and associated cost realignment initiative, Kindred's earnings stream, cash flow generation, and leverage profile will be substantially improved. Over time, when complete, we expect approximately half of Kindred's future EBIT to come from Kindred at Home, the nation's largest home health hospice and community care platform. We expect roughly one quarter of Kindred's future EBIT to come from our rebalanced hospital division, and the remaining one quarter to come from rehabilitation services division, which includes one of the largest and fastest growing inpatient rehab facility businesses in the country. The proactive decision to exit the skilled nursing center business in its entirety is a gating event in Kindred's history. So let me provide a little bit more detail on our decision. Reducing our exposure to the skilled nursing business has been a strategic objective for some time, given the utilization and operating headwinds facing the sector, coupled with our focus on higher growth, higher margin, and less capital intensive businesses, like home health and hospice. While our nursing center division represents less than 15% of our consolidated revenues, its negative impact on cash flow and earnings is noteworthy, especially this year. Our exposure to the challenges facing the nursing center industry are expected to amount to $40 million to $50 million worse than our 2016 operating plan, upon which our initial 2016 guidance was based. Fortunately, given our diversified portfolio of post acute businesses, the impact of the skilled nursing business on the Kindred enterprise has been somewhat muted. That said, the drag from headwinds in this business is clearly offsetting solid performance in our other divisions. Our decision to reduce guidance or the balance of 2016, exit the skilled nursing center business in its entirety, and substantially reduce our overhead is a direct result of these challenges. Of significant importance around the changes is the removal of large rent and CapEx obligations that have been escalating over time. We expect to reduce our annual rent obligations by approximately $90 million, and annual capital expenditures by approximately $30 million. As part of this decision, we also expect to optimize our overhead by eliminating approximately $70 million to $100 million of divisional and corporate overhead, above the facility level, much of which is associated with supporting our skilled nursing facilities. As investors who have followed Kindred for some time know, Kindred has a long history of delivering on synergies and cost-saving initiatives, and we have confidence we will achieve this goal. For example, on the Gentiva deal, we achieved $91 million of synergies, a savings at the high end of our already aggressive expectations. There have been some, upon hearing our announcement, who have questioned whether this is a change in strategy. To be clear: our strategy has not changed at all. Although we are exiting the skilled nursing facility business as an owner operator, we continue to consider skilled nursing a critical element of the care continuum. We will work closely with many high quality providers of skilled nursing facilities across the country to care for patients in need as part of our ongoing Continue the Care initiatives. Our primary issue has been that with our current portfolio, we haven't had enough of a skilled nursing facility presence to accommodate our local market needs. Going forward, we plan to organize, affiliate, and partner with local and regional networks of skilled nursing facilities owned by other organizations. And we expect that our sale of Kindred's skilled nursing facilities will bring additional opportunities for employment and career growth for our teammates by being a part of a broader and deeper local skilled nursing network. We look forward to finding the right home for our patients, our employees, and our facilities. As we look forward on what the future holds for Kindred Healthcare, I want to remind investors about the meaningful progress we're making in our move to build new, value based capabilities and further differentiate Kindred from the post acute industry. Our post acute benefits and management capabilities will be driven by our unique bundle of technology enabled care management capabilities and assets in local markets we both own and partner with. Earlier this year, we announced an initiative with Inovalon to create a set of data driven tools to drive a post acute site placement, lower readmissions, and lower cost of care. We've made tremendous progress in developing these care management capabilities and expect to be able to deploy these tools in the market in the very near future. This will help support bundling, ACO, and other value-based payment initiatives. Kindred's Continue the Care initiatives, creating a clinical continuum between Kindred's service lines has taken hold, creating seamless transitions between post-acute sites of care that serve as an important foundation for managing patients in an ACO and bundling context. And as we will discuss more in coming months, our growing contact center is emerging as a centralized hub for patient care management, both for Kindred and our partners. And we continue to participate in our own pilot on alternative payment models, including participation in a Model 3 post-acute-only Medicare bundling demonstration, and being a majority owner in a primary care physician Medicare ACO, Silver State. And that really represents our approach to positioning Kindred to succeed in a value based world. We have the continuum; we are rapidly developing the care management capabilities to manage patients across the continuum; and you should expect to see us partnering with hospital systems in a variety of ways so that together we are positioned to succeed in the future. Rather than going alone, for example, with only Model 3 post acute bundles, our strategy is to partner with acute hospital systems to provide seamless care at a lower price point from hospital to home. Now let me spend a few minutes on each of our divisions, starting with Kindred at Home. Kindred at Home delivered another solid quarter. As the largest home health hospice and community care platform in the nation, it remains one of the most exciting growth stories at Kindred. During the quarter we were busy integrating the business we acquired in Arkansas to become the largest in home provider in that state. We also completed the largest system conversion in Kindred's history, moving all of our branches onto a single, unified clinical platform called KindredLink. And we did it without the business interruption that many companies who are going through similar transitions have experienced. For the third quarter, the Kindred at Home division delivered core EBITDAR growth of 4.1% over the same quarter last year on revenue growth of 5.5%. Our home health service line saw 3.7% episodic admission growth in the quarter, and core EBITDAR growth of 10.2%. But importantly, same-store episodic growth was 6.9% in this business. Our hospice operations also achieved solid growth in the quarter, with revenue growing 4.1% on same-store admissions, a robust 8.3%. The third quarter marked the third straight quarter of admission and census growth in this business. Our community care business, a community-based delivery model that plays an important role in managing complex patient population health issues, helped to drive Kindred at Home's solid performance in the quarter. Including the Arkansas community care business acquired in the quarter, our community care business now boasts annual revenues of nearly $300 million. The seamless integration of the Gentiva acquisition and the continued growth and success of our Kindred at Home division underscores our confidence that this business will be a major driver of value creation for our enterprise and its shareholders in the years ahead. Turning now to our hospital division. After two years of preparing for the implementation of LTAC criteria, as of September 1, all of our ongoing 82 hospitals were in criteria. We're pleased to be executing on our multifaceted mitigation strategy. During recent months, we completed a strategic sale, swap, or closure of 20 LTACs, substantially completing this portfolio optimization component of our strategy to maximize the positioning and efficiency of our go-forward portfolio. Early market feedback is confirming our multifaceted LTAC criteria mitigation strategy is working. Referral sources are embracing the clarity of LTAC criteria, as well as being appreciative of our desire to accept both post-intensive care compliant patients as well as medically complex patients or site-neutral. Kindred's approach to saying yes to referral sources for all LTAC appropriate patients helped deliver admissions growth, not contraction, in the third quarter. While the quarterly only had a month and a half of criteria impact, the results provide an encouraging early read on criteria mitigation. For the same hospital portfolio, the growth in admissions were a positive 1%. The criteria-driven decrease in Medicare revenue for admission was mitigated by favorable mix and length of stay reduction to yield an overall 1% growth in same-hospital revenue. And the average length of stay in our medically complex patients continues to come down. While we expect to have more insight on criteria-related trends after our first full quarter, next quarter, the composition of our ongoing hospital division revenue we think is noteworthy. For the month of September, 86% of our ongoing hospital revenue came from compliant patients. The remaining 14% of revenue was from Medicare site-neutral patients. The unmitigated revenue impact of LTAC criteria for the ongoing portfolio in September was approximately $8 million. Given the vector on criteria we are seeing, we're confident in our ability to successfully navigate through this transition. And we continue to expect that by the end of 2017, on a run rate basis, we will mitigate roughly half of the impact of this reimbursement change. We are further encouraged by the fact that the degree of criteria challenges facing our portfolio of LTACs varies widely. To be clear, some LTACs are impacted by criteria more than others. We believe our ability to implement targeted strategies at each of our hospitals will yield favorable results. For example, in California we're the leading LTAC provider in the state. Commercial patients are reimbursed on a per diem basis. Our ability to focus on driving these patients without the previous LTAC qualifying 25-day length of stay requirement creates an enormous opportunity to fill our hospitals with a very profitable mix. We are pursuing this strategy aggressively. Kindred's hospital division reported third-quarter revenue decline of 0.7% from the prior year to $575.3 million due to its full entrance into LTAC patient criteria and the closure of three hospitals within the period. These declines were offset partially by a 1% increase in same hospital admissions, and a 3.3% increase in same-hospital commercial rates. Core EBITDAR for the third quarter decreased 14.8% to $82.8 million from $97.1 million a year ago. Of important note, our performance against guidance was impacted significantly by LTAC sales, swaps, and closures we managed through in the quarter. This non-budgeted, one time transition impact accounted for approximately $7 million in the quarter. The hospital division also faced noteworthy labor headwinds in the form of premium pay labor from overtime and contract labor. But overall, we're very confident we have taken the right steps to mitigate near-term challenges and position our LTAC division for long-term growth and value creation. Turning now to our rehab services division, KRS. As a reminder, KRS comprises our Kindred hospital rehab service segment, or KHRS, and our RehabCare contract therapy service segment. Once again, KRS had another strong quarter and continues to be a growth driver at Kindred. KRS reported revenue of $361 million and core EBITDAR of $59.5 million for the quarter, up 4.9% from $56.7 million the previous year. KHRS, which houses our free standing inpatient rehab facilities, as well as the 104 acute rehab units we manage on a contract basis inside community hospitals, had an impressive quarter, with revenues up 13.1% and core EBITDAR up 19.2%. This growth comes from a combination of maturing IRF facilities, acute rehab unit site growth of 3%, and same-hospital discharge [Technical Difficulty] for our freestanding IRFs of 5.9% compared to same quarter last year. RehabCare, our skilled nursing rehabilitation segment, continues to work through contract losses experienced in 2015, as well as the same challenges adversely impacting the nursing center industry. Our RehabCare volumes and margins are being pressured as our customer host skilled nursing facilities faced utilization and census headwinds. In the face of these challenges, our RehabCare team is doing an admirable job, with cost containment and overhead reduction, and is aggressively managing its portfolio by adding new contracts and terminating unprofitable ones. Moving now to our nursing center division. Performance in the quarter continues to reflect, as we have discussed, the skilled nursing facility industry headwind, including labor challenges, shortened length of stay, and reduced census. Third quarter revenues declined 0.1% to $270.3 million compared to the same period last year. Core EBITDAR declined 16.7% to $29.9 million compared to $35.9 million a year ago, as the result of a 0.7% decline in average daily census, patient mix deterioration, and higher labor costs. As I mentioned earlier, our exposure to the challenges facing the skilled nursing center industry are expected to amount to $40 million to $50 million worse than our initial 2016 guidance suggested. Our decision to reduce guidance for the balance of 2016, exit the nursing center facility business in its entirety, and substantially reduce our overhead are directly related to those challenges. And with that, I will turn it over to Stephen. Stephen? Stephen Farber Thanks, Ben, and good morning. There's a lot to cover this quarter, and we want to leave plenty of time for Q&A, so let's get started with some key lines from the income statement. Starting with revenues, the third quarter revenue was $1.79 billion, up 1.6% year-over-year. For full 2016, we are narrowing our revenue guidance to approximately $7.2 billion. This implies revenue of roughly $1.725 billion for the fourth quarter and reflects the impact of the various recent LTAC sales, closures, swaps, and other transactions. Moving now to core EBITDAR. For the third quarter, core EBITDAR came in at $220.1 million, at the low end of our guidance. Please note, as we indicated in our earnings release, this result included unbudgeted operational degradation of $3.9 million, compared to budget, at the three LTAC hospitals we closed during the period. Our core performance also included a shortfall of $3.2 million compared to the budget from the Select hospitals we acquired in a swap in June. These two items totaled $7.1 million. And, again, to be clear the $220.1 million of core EBITDAR we reported was burdened by this amount. For the full year, we have revised our core EBITDAR guidance to a range of $950 million to $970 million. This reflects a shift in midpoint guidance of $30 million. $10 million of this reduction relates to two out of guidance items. First, as previously disclosed, our original guidance did not adjust for the recent sale of the 12 LTACs to Curahealth, which were budgeted to contribute roughly $5 million to EBITDAR in the fourth quarter. Second, the LTAC final rule, which was published in August, is expected to have a negative impact of approximately $5 million in the fourth quarter, relative to our budget. The remainder of the revision to guidance relates to items Ben has already discussed at length: skilled nursing, and labor headwinds. This update implies fourth quarter EBITDAR of $215 million to $235 million. Moving now to rent. For the third quarter, rent was $98 million, down from $100 million sequentially. For the full year, rent should be roughly $390 million or about $94 million for the fourth quarter, which is a bit better than prior expectations and reflects the impact of all the recent changes to the LTAC hospital portfolio. Moving now to D&A. For the third quarter, D&A was $40 million, essentially flat sequentially. For the full year, D&A should be roughly $161 million, which implies about $40 million for the fourth quarter; which, as with rent, is a bit better than prior expectation, and reflects the impact of all the recent changes to the LTAC hospital portfolio. Moving now to net interest expense. We reported $58 million of net interest expense for the quarter, which is in line with our estimated range for the year of approximately $230 million to $235 million. Please remember this estimate includes approximately $15 million of non cash amortization of deferred financing fees. Moving now to taxes. Our third quarter effective core book tax rate was 19.7%, down from our second quarter effective core book rate of 30.6%, and first quarter of 32.2%, each calculated as a percentage of pre-tax income before non controlling interest. The third quarter effective core book tax rate was favorably impacted by a true up from two items: first, in September, we filed Kindred's 2015 federal tax return; and, second the change in earnings outlook for 2016. We now expect our full year 2016 effective annual core book tax provision to be roughly 30%, improved from our previous expectation of roughly 32%. We also continue to expect our cash tax payment to be less than 10% of our book tax provision, adding significantly to future cash flows, which I will discuss more in a few minutes. Moving now to non controlling interests. Core NCI was $14.3 million for the quarter, up from $13.5 million sequentially, and $9.9 million in the third quarter last year. Growth in NCI was driven primarily by the performance of our joint ventured IRFs. We expect NCI to total approximately $55 million for 2016. Moving now to share count. We ended the quarter with approximately 87.5 million diluted shares, and we expect approximately the same amount for the full year on a weighted average basis. Moving now to earnings per share. We announced last night core earnings per diluted share for the third quarter of $0.05, which was in line with our guidance range of $0.02 to $0.12. Please note that our reported earnings are burdened by the same $7.1 million aggregate pretax impact of unbudgeted operational degradation within our closed LTACs and hospitals we all acquired from Select, as we discussed a few moments ago. As noted in the release, for the full year we expect core earnings per diluted share of $0.70 to $0.80, which implies an expected range for core earnings per diluted share in the fourth quarter of $0.02 to $0.12. This represents a $0.15 change from the previous midpoint of guidance, reflecting many of the same items we have already discussed. Let's move now to cash flow. GAAP cash flow from operations for the third quarter was 36 million, down from 132 million in the prior year. Core operating cash flow was 30 million this quarter, down from 128 million in the prior year. As always, we encourage those on this call and those that follow the Company to understand the differences between GAAP and core for Kindred, and reach their own conclusion how to address individual items. For cash flow, these differences are detailed on page 23 of our earnings release. Routine capital expenditures this quarter were 22 million, down from 35 million in the same quarter last year. The change period-over-period is mostly just timing. For full year 2016, we now expect capital expenditure outflows to approximate 90 million to 100 million, an improvement of 15 million at the midpoint from our estimate earlier this year of 100 million 120 million. NCI distributions were 5 million this quarter, down from 11 million in the same quarter last year. This difference is primarily due to the timing of payments, and we expect a bit of a true-up in the fourth quarter. Subtracting CapEx and NCI from core operating cash flow results in core free cash flows this quarter of 4 million compared to 82 million in the prior-year period. As we discussed in our earnings release last night, we expect much of this decline year-over-year to be transitory, and primarily relates to several items. First, as we discussed on our second quarter earnings call in August, the third quarter calendar included one extra payroll cycle compared to the third quarter last year, which accounted for approximately 30 million of the difference. This timing difference will flip the other direction and become a pickup in Q4 when the calendar has one less payroll Friday compared to the prior year. Second, third quarter calendar included one less Medicare LTAC payment cycle than the comparable period in the prior-year quarter, which accounted for approximately 35 million of the difference. Third, the Select LTAC hospitals we acquired in June, and the Arkansas Department of Health transaction we completed in August, required license transfers to be processed prior to being able to bill Medicare and certain other payers. This is normal, ordinary course healthcare revenue cycle. Most of these transfers were not completed until recently, and the billing backlog that resulted accounted for approximately 16 million of the cash flow difference in the third quarter. We expect much of this amount to be collected over the balance of the year and in early 2017. Fourth, systems issues at one large commercial payer and one state Medicaid payer disrupted payment processing and impacted third quarter cash flows by approximately 13 million. We expect much of this amount to be collected over the balance of the year and in early 2017. Fifth, Kindred at Home, as Ben mentioned, completed systems conversions in over 100 branches during the second and third quarters, such conversions in the ordinary course lead to temporary billing delays. These conversions are estimated to have impacted cash flow in the third quarter by roughly 25 million. We expect much of this amount to be collected over the balance of the year and in early 2017. For those keeping track, these five examples account for 119 million of the $78 million change in year-over-year free cash flow in the quarter. There were some favorable items as well in the quarter, such as the CapEx and NCI cash pick-ups year-over-year that I mentioned a moment ago. The key takeaway from this discussion, as we have discussed in previous calls, is that in the context of an over $7 billion top-line enterprise, every quarter Kindred has a number of cash flow timing differences in both directions, particularly related to revenue cycle, transactions, and initiatives that can have meaningful short-term impacts but modest or zero long-term impact. Now let's turn to cash flow expectations for the balance of the year and for the full-year 2016. First, while we don't provide formal cash flow guidance, we have routinely said we expect Kindred's current composition of businesses to generate approximately $300 million of annual operating cash flow, and roughly half that amount in free cash flow. We are very focused on cash, and worked hard to strategically reposition the Company over the past several years to focus on businesses with higher growth, lower capital intensity, and meaningful cash flow. And our planned exit from the skilled nursing facility business and the associated cost realignment initiative are significant steps in the same direction. Now, for 2016 -- and we noted in our release last night -- that given the $30 million change in midpoint EBITDAR outlook, it would make sense to expect a proportionate change in cash flow performance this year. We also noted, both in the release and in my comments today, that while we expect the majority of the cash flow items we just discussed to resolve over the balance of the year, some portion will likely carry over into early 2017, and thus impact cash flows in Q4. In addition, our exit from the skilled nursing facility business and the overhead restructuring we announced today will each carry a range of cash costs, a modest portion of which may be incurred over the balance of the year. That said, we expect the end result of these efforts and cost, after the exit and overhead restructuring is completed, to be a meaningful net improvement in Kindred's cash flow. It is important to note that these amounts do not include the cash flow impact of harvesting the roughly $350 million to $400 million of NOL carryforwards that we expect to have at the end of 2016, and which we expect may grow further as part of our exit from the skilled nursing facility business. As we have discussed, we expect our cash taxes to be less than 10% of our book taxes, well into 2018 and perhaps beyond, providing significant incremental cash flow each year until the NOLs are fully utilized. To be clear, as we indicated in our release last night, the deferred tax asset valuation allowance we took this quarter under GAAP has no impact, actually zero impact, on our ability to harvest our NOLs and retain incremental cash. On a total value basis, these NOLs, once harvested, should be worth roughly $125 million to $140 million in incremental cash for Kindred over the coming years. And with that, I will turn it back to Ben. Ben Breier Thank you, Stephen. I know that for many investors, the Kindred journey towards transformation has been a long and winding one. We haven't always had the smoothest of paths. For myself and for my many devoted colleagues, our life's work has revolved around making this transformation work. Our actions today, and the actions we've taken over the last few years, have firmly positioned Kindred for long-term success. Our future will be driven by a best-in-class home health hospice and community care business, by an LTAC hospital business sized now to take advantage of a stabilizing reimbursement model, by a rehab business growing faster than any competitor in the industry, and by a technology enabled post-acute benefits management capability unlike anyone else in our space can deliver. This, while eliminating our exposure to nursing facility operations industry, reducing long-term rents and capital expenditures, and creating a better cash flow and leverage profile for the Company. All of which we believe will lead to growth in shareholder return in the future. And with that, operator, we will open up the call for questions. Question-and-Answer Session Thank you, Mr. Brier. [Operator Instructions] And we go first to Sheryl Skolnick, Mizuho Securities. Sheryl Skolnick So, I understand why you've chosen to exit the skilled nursing and [Technical Difficulty] strategy. But I need a little help in understanding the thinking that you have about the mitigation going forward on the LTAC side of the business. And in particular, given that it's been one month, albeit a somewhat successful month, and we see some success, it has only been one month. So, can you give us a sense of what your thought process is around what part might be at risk for not being able to be mitigated? In other words, just because you have done well in a month, can you identify the risks and then the opportunities that offset those risks as you move forward in developing a criteria compliant model here? My concern here is that $8 million doesn't sound like a whole lot. But I'm trying to understand why it's so low and what might make it bigger, and how you will make it smaller. Ben Breier Sure. Thank you, Sheryl. Good morning to you. Well, let me make a couple of comments on criteria, if I may, and hopefully I will answer your question specifically. First, as I talked about in my prepared remarks, we are, and I think it is worth noting, very pleased to have executed on the 20 sales, swaps, or closures that we did in the third quarter. It was, as you might imagine, heading into the teeth of criteria, a major undertaking by our operators. I think we took something like 800 beds out of our own Kindred capacity. And I think that, in and of itself, is the first step, as we have stated publicly, around how we think about mitigation of criteria, simply taking out beds and reducing capacity in the LTAC industry. We think you'll see more of that down the road as other LTAC competitors, I think, have a tough time working through and integrating through criteria. Second, I think that, as we have looked at the data now through the first month and a half of being in criteria, as I said, Sheryl, I think we're growing actually more confident, not less; that our strategy, at least for Kindred, is the right one. We put out, we thought, some very important data this quarter for investors to think about. And that was showing that 86% of the revenue coming in our hospital division today comes from compliant related patients. Only 14% comes from site-neutral patients today. And we would expect, Sheryl, over time to see that 86% number climb, I would argue above the 90% range, as we move through this two-year blended rate on these site-neutral patients. Remember, there was a reason why, in the context of the legislation that was passed, we asked for and got a two-year blended rate, to give us two years with buildings that have the kind of capacity we have to move through and cycle through the process, and take some of those site-neutral patients, in which we are growing in our confidence in our ability to manage lengths of stay down in that environment. So, the examples that I gave in my prepared remarks around California, Sheryl, I think is one that should breed some confidence for investors as to why we think this number gets better, not worse; and why we feel pretty good about the guidance we've given around mitigation for criteria. There are a lot of patients in many markets we serve, California is a perfect example, that are paying us at an LTAC rate that are not necessarily Medicare full DRG patients, but that are commercial, managed care, or other payers in which we're getting $1,600, $1,700, $1,800 a day on a per diem basis. We can do that, Sheryl, without the old, archaic, 25 day length of stay requirements that used to be around us. And we're seeing great success, we think, in continuing to fill our hospitals with patients who need the kind of LTAC care that we can provide. Remember, the broad demographics of this business continue to get better and better. You have more chronically sick, medically complex patients living in short term acute hospitals around the country. And as we have brought bed capacity down to 82 LTACs, and we look towards the next couple of years, we're actually feeling pretty good about the fact that we're going to both mitigate these rate differentials in criteria and grow volumes and census into the future. Sheryl Skolnick I appreciate that. And then can we just turn to the IRFs for a second, because we tend not to focus on them at all? And if you can just remind me, as that business is performing very nicely with strong discharge growth and I'm trying to focus on what's going well here, because what's not going well is pretty obvious but the what's going well maybe a little less obvious. Can you just give us a sense of your mix of patients there? Are you mostly doing stroke? Or is there any kind of issue with cardiac rehab going on there? And how you see the use of rehab hospitals evolving, especially now perhaps as you are exiting the skilled nursing facility, maybe a view towards increasing use of the outcomes you can achieve in rehab hospital land. Ben Breier Sure. Thank you. Well, and I appreciate talking about our inpatient rehab facility business. As you said, it often goes unnoticed. And it represents now more than $600 million of revenue for our Company, and a significant portion I think of north of $180 million of EBITDAR for the business as well. And probably along with Kindred at Home, the fastest growing component of our Company. I think on the mix of patients, probably not unlike what you see at some of our other competitors out there around stroke in neuro rehab and cardiac rehab. Ortho is also obviously a big piece. But I think that there are a couple of characteristics in the IRF business that we really like. First, for a lot of different reasons, the organic discharge characteristics in this business continue to be very strong. We were very pleased to print a 5.9% organic discharge growth rate in our same store free standing IRF operations this quarter. And we had, I think it was north of 3% organic admissions in the 104 acute rehab units we manage. And a reminder for investors: those ARUs that are based in community hospitals are essentially like managing an inpatient rehab facility inside the walls of a community hospital. What we really like about our IRF business, Sheryl, aside from the characteristics of growth and mix, and what we're seeing in that regard, is that it has been an incredible relationship builder with lots and lots of big hospital systems and partners across the country. We've shown maps before that show that our 19 inpatient rehab facilities, most of which are joint ventured with large, big branded healthcare systems. That not only leads to business on the IRF side, but as we think about becoming a post acute benefits management company, in which we are managing not just the patient but the population, we continue to see success in building relationships off of what these IRF JVs have given us. So we continue to be excited. There's a lot of growth in this business into the near term. And I think, look, it's a reminder again that, to your point, while there are certainly businesses that we have our struggles in the skilled nursing business, and RehabCare, to a degree LTACs are stabilizing. And we have tremendous growth platforms at Kindred around Kindred at Home, Kindred hospice, community care, and the IRF business. And we think that that is something certainly to build on for our Company into the future. Thank you. Operator Will go next to Chris Rigg with Susquehanna Financial Group. Chris Rigg Just first question, a little bit of a follow up to Sheryl. When I think about $8 million in September, obviously that's 24 million for a three month period. When you guys report fourth quarter, do you think that at that point, within three or four months of the rollout, that we'll be able to see some of the mitigation efforts taking root so that it's not a $24ish million problem by then, but it's something less? And then more generally, when we step back, obviously one of your primary competitors has done a pretty good job at finding new compliant admissions. Can you give us a sense, when you look at your portfolio across the board, have you seen any success in getting those compliant patients through the door? Thanks. Ben Breier So to your first question, Chris, yes, we expect that we will be able to show investors with pretty good granularity, after we get the first full quarter of criteria under our belt, that not only is there an unmitigated number, which we think is important to show for the point of showing what the unmitigated number is, but that you will see a significant amount of progress made on the mitigation of that, specifically as it relates to total revenues. We think, more and more, the way investors are going to want to look at our hospital division is around this total revenue picture, what was revenue before? What is revenue after? Where are the patients coming from? And not get overly complicated about compliant and not compliant. We're just going to look at revenues. And on that front we feel very confident that we're going to be able to show significant mitigation on the revenue side as it relates to what we'll show you after the fourth quarter. Look, as it relates to volume growth, I understand your question, and I would just call your attention to our third-quarter results. Now, mind you, we only had a month and a half of criteria in it, and some of our competitors have had, and been in for quite some time. But I'm pretty sure we're the only LTAC company out there that printed actual admission growth on a core basis, on a year-over-year basis. And we're very bullish about our message to the marketplace: our willingness to say yes to all LTAC appropriate patients; our willingness to be a referral source to everyone, not just to some of them. And we think we're having great success in the marketplace with that message. And we think that that will continue into Q4 in the context of us showing what we hope will be outpaced admission growth in our LTAC business. Chris Rigg Great. And then just flipping over to the nursing home exit, SNF exit. A couple of things that I've been hearing from clients is, one, why now? And then, two, if these facilities are not performing to your expectations, and in some ways things are getting worse, what's the environment out there to offload these assets to third parties? And really, and the secondary question here, just trying to get a better sense for timing, the way you guys see the market, and just any general commentary as to how this exit might unfold over the next 12 to 15 months. Is it going to be more of a piecemeal type thing, or one large transaction, or several chunky transactions? Just any color there would be helpful. Thanks. Ben Breier Well, I don't want to leave you wanting for more. But I'll make some general comments on it, and then we will obviously make a significant amount of detailed comments on the transactions themselves once we are more ready to do that. I think that what was a very clear for us was that, notwithstanding a lot of work we're doing behind the scenes, the most important thing for us was that when we made this announcement yesterday, we wanted our employees, our teammates, our partners to be the first ones to hear it, not anybody else. So in terms of process and things that have become public, it was very important to me, and to our Board, and to the rest of our management team that we treat our employees the right way by making sure that they knew what was happening before anybody else did. And we're going through that process here internally at Kindred, and our folks are working their way through that. Let me make a couple of broad comments, Chris, to your question, and go back to a little bit of what I said in my prepared remarks. Which is, first of all, if you look at the actions that we at Kindred have taken over the last number of years, our desire to exit the skilled nursing facility business I don't think should really come as any surprise to investors. We, as I said in my prepared remarks, at one point, had 300 nursing center facilities. And over the last couple of years, we have pared that down to get into the low 90s. So, it was never really about whether we wanted to try and be in it, or not be in it. For us, it was always about trying to find a path to do so, and to making this full exit of the entire business, if you will. And that is, as you know, a very complicated scenario. But I want to make a couple of comments. One, we're working now very closely with Ventas to finalize an agreement that I think we both feel will create value for both of our shareholder groups. To be clear -- and investors have asked and asked questions -- Ventas has clear consent rights as it relates to any exit we make. We can't do anything without them, and our intention is not to do anything without them. But I would say that because of the strong relationship that our two organizations share, and a now growing track record, in my opinion, of working together, we feel very confident, Chris, that we are going to find a mutually beneficial agreement that benefits both companies. And we hope that you'll hear more about that I think in the very near term. As it relates to the market and the marketplace itself, first of all, while I understand that there may be those that might comment that it's a bit of a buyers' market, I can tell you, if the last 24 hours are representative of the interest out there and the number of inbounds we've had, there are a lot of people who are very, very interested in the marketplace around high-quality owned skilled assets in good markets that have had good brands and have been run well for many years, like our Kindred assets. To be clear, and we've said this publicly, we think that there are lots of nursing center operators out there that probably, under their structure, can do a better job running these assets than we do today. Based on various overhead encumberments, various regulatory and risk-related encumberments that we have, and just having more of a focus I think in the local market skilled nursing penetration, we think that there are a lot of companies out there that are going to have a lot of interest in taking these buildings and really working on getting them to the next level. So, more to follow on the deal flow, and on when it's all going to happen. I know investors have a lot of questions on that. I assure you, we are giving a lot of thought and a lot of time and effort to how we will balance the selling of nursing centers, the reduction of overhead, the management of cash; all of the various things that we're working on doing. But a reminder for investors, Chris, that at the end of the day, notwithstanding some of the bumps to get from here to there, when investors wake up to a Kindred Healthcare that no longer has exposure to the skilled nursing center facility business, that has $70 million to $100 million of overhead taken out of its SG&A infrastructure, has better free cash flow and better earnings characteristics, this is going to be a Company that shareholders are going to be more happy to own a share of in the future than they even are today. So, we will get through the process, and we will work with our partners on this, and we've got a lot of work to do. And we will work on announcing more of those details as soon as we're ready. Operator We'll go next to Josh Raskin with Barclays. Josh Raskin Just to follow up, a quick one on that one. When you talk about a mutually beneficial outcome, is the outcome that's beneficial to Kindred just simply getting it done? Or are you suggesting that actually this could be financially, in some way, shape, or form, maybe leverage neutral, or EBIT to EBITDA neutral, or something like that? Ben Breier Josh, I'm just not going to get into the details of that at the moment. I think there will be certainly a time and a place to reflect on all of those things. I think the most important thing for investors to recognize is that Ventas and Kindred are working together to try and make this being mutually beneficial to their shareholders and ours. And at the end of the day, I can only speak for Kindred's shareholders, Kindred's shareholders will have to respond to what that definition of mutually beneficial for us is. But we're still doing the work. And I think Ventas is really working hard to try and be a good partner to us, to try and help us figure out our path through that. I think that their path, in terms of reducing their exposure to the skilled nursing facility, is equally important to them. And we think that, at the end of the day, I will just make one comment that a total exit for us, we fundamentally believe will be deleveraging when you look at it in its entirety. So I think that for Kindred's shareholders, forgetting the puts and takes of it all, a company that has brought leverage down post- this transaction is, in my opinion, a better company, and something that I've been very focused on, as investors know. And that is I think the one item that I feel certain that we will get to, by the time we get from here to there. Josh Raskin Okay. And then just on the charges, the total, I don't know, something, roughly, $650 million to $700 million. How much of that is actual cash payment, cash charges? Stephen Farber Good morning, Josh. This is Stephen. None of it. Josh Raskin Okay, none of the $700 million, this is all restructuring. There is no severance; there is nothing like that that's cash payment? Stephen Farber No. Josh Raskin Okay. And then you guys had previously talked about 2017 being roughly flat with the old guidance for 2016, with the understanding that 2016 is coming down with the pressures around SNFs. I know there's a lot of moving parts here now, obviously with the SNF sale. But if we were to maybe isolate, take out the SNFs, I don't know if you can actually put those in discontinued ops; my guess is not, at this point. But how do you think about 2017, excluding maybe just the skilled nursing segment? Stephen Farber Josh, that is a complicated discussion; and, frankly, there are a lot of pieces of it that we're working through right now. It ties into what Ben was just saying, in terms of the way that the series of transactions that will be involved in exiting the skilled nursing unfolds. So, our plan right now is to provide incremental thoughts and guidance on that when we report, the end of the year, and we will have more information over time. Josh Raskin Okay. But we should probably not rely on the previous comments of relatively flat overall? Ben Breier Well, look, I think, Josh, you've seen some puts and takes in our business. We know we've got good growth in our home health, hospice, community care, and IRF business. We know that we are going to go through LTAC mitigation, which we have commented again we think is about what we've been saying it is. And there is some incremental pressure in our nursing centers. And as we called out in the fourth quarter, some additional labor headwinds that I certainly think probably don't dissipate in Q4, and probably move into next year. So, I don't know that I want to get any further into commentary in 2017. And as Stephen just said, I think there are a lot of puts and takes that we've always felt were going to get us back to that even-ish number that you talked about, with a few new pieces of information around labor headwinds and nursing center degradation. And look, we just have a lot of work to do, to give investors real clarity on that in 2017. And we're only hedging here because when we give out the information, we want it to be right, and we've got a lot of work to do in that regard. Operator Next A.J. Rice with UBS. A.J. Rice I have a few questions, if possible. First, Ben, just to clarify, so if we're looking at the EBITDAR and the skilled nursing this quarter, it looks like it's about $30 million; so assuming that's sort of a run rate, $120 million. When you are referencing the $70 million to $100 million of overhead, I know you've got a separate item in your segment data that has $50 million of corporate expense. Is the $70 million to $100 million in the allocation for the segment? Or is that somehow in some other bucket? Ben Breier I would say let me see how to phrase that. I would say much of the $70 million to $100 million is in the segment, but not all. A.J. Rice Okay. All right. And then you've obviously downsized your skilled nursing portfolio significantly already, so you probably have some history on this. I'm just wondering, how does getting out of the rest of it does it have any spillover effect in RehabCare? What's been the experience when RehabCare is servicing one of these some of these units that get sold or disposed of? Ben Breier Yes, good question; and we've given a lot of thought to that. And in the way we have thought about this transaction, let me tell you what we have sort of assumed. Typically our experience is is that when we have divested Kindred nursing center assets, we've kept about half of the RehabCare contracts. In this case, we've taken a conservative approach to thinking that we may lose as much as two thirds of that business. But we've also seen, for instance, in the sale of our LTACs to Curahealth, that they engaged us and wanted to keep all of that business with RehabCare. So it really is going to depend on a facility by facility basis what we keep or not. But, A.J. to your question, historically we've kept about half. A.J. Rice Okay. If whether it's a half or two thirds, whatever is there any way to size how much RehabCare business goes to those 90 facilities at this point? Ben Breier There is somewhere between about $8 million to $10 million of EBITDAR that we generate, A.J., from RehabCare coming from those facilities. You are talking about $4 million or $5 million. And we haven't really talked about it; you addressed it a little bit in the prepared remarks. But the commentary around labor, it sounds like most of that is in the skilled nursing. But it sounds like maybe a little is in LTAC, maybe even a little in home health. Can you just give us a little more flavor for what you are seeing on that? Ben Breier I don't think that our labor pressures are more remarkable or less remarkable than most healthcare providers out there. It is absolutely coming from the skilled nursing side, both in the skilled nursing industry, but I would argue more specifically from the skilled nursing, meaning the RN environment. And it's not even so much in the wage rates that we're having to pay, or signing bonuses that we're having to do, of which we have to do a lot of that it's really in what I would talk about the premium pay side of the world. It's paying overtime; it's finding registry nurses; it's finding nurses to fill shifts. It's a very tight labor market out there, A.J., and I think we're experiencing it. Some geographic pockets are worse than others. The skilled nursing industry seems to be worse than the hospital industry, which seems to be worse than the home health industry. And I would argue the hospice industry, for whatever reason, we are seeing a lot of premium pay nurses there. So, it's sort of widespread, but it's not everywhere. It's mostly on the skilled RN side. And we're working very hard to try and abate it. The best thing we can do obviously is to limit turnover and reduce that cycle of having to go out and recruit and have empty and open positions. And our human resource and people service team is working very hard around here to do that. Our unemployment I'm sorry, our turnover rates are kind of around the historical levels they've been. They've held pretty steady, even in a very tight labor market. But finding and being able to fill open positions has been a challenge, for sure. A.J. Rice Okay. And maybe just one last thing on the criteria. So, you are at 86% compliant today. I know your model isn't to get to 100% compliant. Your model is to continue to take some site-neutral patients. Two aspects of it. Do you have any sense, at this early stage, where you think that 86% ultimately shakes out? And you said that on the site-neutral, you are having some success in reducing length of stay, getting them into other sites on the continuum, I guess. Is there any early read on how much of a drop in length of stay, if you are historically fluctuating, I don't know how the site-neutrals historically have been, but around 25 day average length of stay, how much does that typically drop in the new reimbursement environment? Ben Breier Sure. Well, to your first question, A.J., this is just directional, but I think that over the course of the next two years of being in criteria, it will not surprise me, and I would think it would be likely that we would get over the 90% level on what we would call a compliant patient, or a non-site-neutral patient. I think that as I talked about the example of the growth in per diem commercial and other paying patients, as we continue to go after more Medicare full DRG patients and the market continues to understand the clarity of what an LTAC can be and can't be A.J., as we continue to take bed capacity out and see other customers probably moving out of the LTAC business, I would argue over the next year and a half or so, those things I think will lead us to probably moving north of 90% on the compliant side. On the length of stay side, look, I am a little hesitant to give too much data on that, only because it really is only a month, month and a half of it. But I would say to you that if you look at our statistics, you can see that our Medicare lengths of stay came down by almost a full day, and that's with only really a month and a half of criteria in it. And I would say that that is predominantly being driven by lengths of stay dropping in those site-neutral patients. And it wouldn't surprise me if, over time, those site-neutral patients came down three, four, maybe even as many as five days, over the next two years. Before all is said and done. A.J. Rice All right, great. Thanks a lot. Operator We will next to Gary Taylor with JPMorgan. Gary Taylor Most of my questions were answered; just wanted to hit a couple details. Just going back to the last topic on the site-neutral patients, you talk about 14% of revenue. Can you share percent of admissions or percent of patient days on that? Ben Breier I don't know that we've segmented that out, Gary. I'm looking at my guys. It's probably a little bit less than the 86%, but not markedly different, but a little bit less. Obviously the rates on the fully compliant patients are going to be higher than on the nons, so revenue is going to be a little bit higher than what patient days would be. But we haven't disclosed that yet. But probably after the first quarter when we have a little more detail, we will do that. Gary Taylor And the length of stay on the noncompliant patients, I think in your last answer you said, down three days. I want to make sure I understood that correctly. So, on the noncompliant patients, they are running in the low 20s? Is that what you are trying to convey? Ben Breier Yes, I didn't say they were down yet three days. I think the question was, where did I think they would get? But what I quoted, just to be clear, because I think it's important, our Medicare lengths of stay in total came down by about a day. A large portion of that, I would argue most of that, driven by the noncompliant, if you will; the site-neutral, medically complex. And then the question was asked, well, where did I think it would go? And I said, based on the data I'm seeing, I think that can come down by three to as many as five days on that total book of business over the next couple of quarters. Gary Taylor That's on total Medicare length of stay on that part. Ben Breier On the medically complex, on the site-neutral. Gary Taylor And then just going back to the question about; again the overhead question, just because it's important as we try to think about ongoing earnings power of the Company. Of the $70 million to $100 million of overhead, you said much of that is loaded into the SNF segment, but not all. Can you be more precise on that? As we're modeling and thinking about valuation, we're taking the SNF EBITDAR out of the model. What should we be thinking about in terms of shared services overhead reduction? Ben Breier Look, the best way I can answer this, Gary -- and I know I got a lot -- we'll do a lot more details after the fact -- is to say, you got about $120 million plus of EBITDAR in the nursing center business. You know $90 million of rents are going to come out. So, included in the $120 million, to your point is, as I said, a lot but not all of that overhead number. We believe, having looked at the overhead rationalization that we will do in a very detailed way, that by the time we are done, we will have -- this will be an accretive action for this Company, an EBITDAR improving action for this Company. So, I know that doesn't leave you with all the details you want to model. But it does help fill that gap that, while some of the overhead -- a lot of the overhead is included in the $120 million in the division, there is more that will come out. And ultimately we believe it will be an EBITDAR accretive action that we will have taken when we're done. Gary Taylor Last question. On the rent, the $90 million rent associated with these facilities, obviously as Ventas has pointed out today, they have to consent to the sale. They have master leases that are also supported by LTACs in the market. And so, your confidence level that, on the portion that's related to Ventas, that you really do see that rent go away? We're not caught in another situation like we were a number of years ago, where because of those master leases, the total level of rent that you had to pay didn't come down as much. Does that make sense? Ben Breier I understand your question; I'm just not going to get into the details of a deal that's not yet done. But I will focus on the comments that Ventas made this morning in their release, and that we continue to believe that we will find a mutually beneficial negotiation here happen. And I understand your comments. And we take those quite seriously and importantly as it relates to our shareholders. And we will continue those conversations with our partners at Ventas here into the future. Gary Taylor One more question. Steve, when we look at the revenue eliminations at the corporate level, I think $52 million in this quarter, was the vast majority of that RehabCare revenues sold into the SNF segment? I realize not all of it would be related to these 90, but is that the bulk of the $52 million revenue eliminations? Stephen Farber Gary, we're looking. Just making sure we give you an answer. The short answer is yes, Gary. It's mostly from the rehab side. Operator We'll take our next question from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Kevin Fischbeck I appreciate the color on the impact to RehabCare from exiting the SNFs. Is there an impact on Kindred at Home? How much of the volume do you get there? And how does those referral patterns usually hold up after a divestiture? Ben Breier We don't imagine there's going to be much of an impact there, Kevin. It's a natural question you asked. We are driving a significant amount of referrals from those skilled nursing facilities into our home health operations. But on the scale of our 2-point-whatever billion-dollar home health operation, it's not a huge piece. And under any circumstances, those are relationships that we think will continue. So I wouldn't read too much into any degradation there. Kevin Fischbeck Okay. And then it's still a little bit confusing to me, exactly how to think about the puts and takes around the adjustment to Q4 guidance. If we could maybe separate them into things that are related to the nursing home business that you are going to get rid of, and the things that are going to be persisting. Obviously the LTAC, it sounds like a $5 million headwind, something that maybe we should annualize into next year if that's going to be an ongoing thing. But the $40 million to $50 million labor dynamic, it sounds like most of it is SNFs, but maybe not all of it. Is there a portion, can you give us some granularity about how much of that is purely nursing home, and how much of that is related to businesses you are going to be keeping, going forward? Ben Breier Sure. So let me try and qualify the numbers and clarify them a little bit, Kevin. And I'm sorry there's still some confusion out there. We've tried to be as clear as we could with it. Remember, the $40 million to $50 million that we were talking about reflected back to the initial 2016 guidance we gave, and where we thought that business was going to be. And that included what we said was exposure to the skilled nursing industry, which meant there was a portion of that in our nursing center business and there was a portion of that coming from our RehabCare business, which had a fairly tough third quarter. And we see some of that happening into Q4 with census coming down, and skill mix in some of our third-party nursing centers across the country. If you look at guidance in terms of what we did in Q4, and you say we took guidance from the midpoint of $990 million down to the midpoint of $960 million, there's a $30 million guidance move. You have to, at least in our math, take $10 million out; $5 million of which is related to criteria, and $5 million of it was related to the Curahealth hospitals coming out that were not in our guidance. And so you are talking about this $20 million delta, if you will, from midpoint to midpoint in our guidance for Q4. What I would argue is is that probably over half of that is related to the continued decline on our nursing center and RehabCare businesses that we see happening into Q4. And another good portion of that is related to these labor headwinds that we talked about. It's hard to quantify whether that's $12 million, $8 million, $10 million, $10 million, but something in that kind of mix is the way that I would be thinking about it in the way that we guided for Q4. Does that make sense? Kevin Fischbeck Yes. I think that that, I guess the question is, but if you think about Curahealth, obviously, the whole thing comes out next year. The $5 million from the LTAC, obviously we should annualize that into next year because of ongoing things. The half that's related to non-SNF, I guess we'll see how that develops over time. But it feels to me like you're saying that maybe something else actually got better, because we're talking 40 to 50, then we're talking about 20. And so, is there an offset somewhere? You had said that the IRF business is doing $5 million or $10 million better than you thought, or the home health business is doing $10 million better than you thought. How do we think about that? Ben Breier Yes. Yes, exactly. Our home health, hospice, and IRF businesses are doing better. We've managed, I think, SG&A in our corporate, our support center costs better. We're not just living in a static environment. We're trying to do better at the businesses that are growing. And we have, in fact, seen improvement in these growing businesses. So, yes, that's the offset to why the guidance was taken to where it was taken, and not anything incremental from that. Kevin, we've got to jump. We have time for one more, I think here. We're already running over. Thank you. Operator Will take our next question from Gary Lieberman with Wells Fargo. Gary Lieberman Within the LTAC, if we just looked at the Medicare book of business, what was your compliance rate there? Was it higher than the 86% overall? Ben Breier No. Gary, if you take the Medicare book of business alone, we ran a compliant rate somewhere in the mid 60s, I would say, just on the Medicare business alone. So remember, though, the math on that is that's so let's call it 65% of 60%, whatever that math turns into, is the part of our total. So it's about mid-60s on the Medicare mix. Gary Lieberman Okay. And then if I look at my math, I don't know if I'm doing it right, but it looks like average daily census on the Medicare book of business was down, like, 85 days. Should I think about that as one month impact? Or is that I heard you mention or reference a month and a half of impact. What is the right way to think about it? Ben Breier Probably a month and a half. We had all of our for two weeks in August, anything that was in house that stayed in house through September 1, wound up being coded under LTAC criteria. So I think it's a month and a half, probably is the right way to look at that. Gary Lieberman Okay. And then the impact from the overhead of exiting the SNF business, is the right way to think about it if we look at the line item that you report as the support center, which was $250 million of expense last year is that where it largely is? Or how should we think about it? Ben Breier No, Gary. And again, we promise we'll give more details as you guys are trying to model, as we move through this. Remember, the so there's a portion of it in that; but I would argue it's a smaller portion in that number, Gary. Most of it resides in the nursing center division's EBITDAR number that you already see. Remember, the overhead in that division flows right through its own EBITDAR number. So when the question was asked to me, what percentage of the $70 million to $120 million of savings is already in the division versus in that corporate number of you quoted, I said most but not all. So, we will obviously be reducing significant amounts of overhead inside the division. And there will be other overhead around shared services and other that will come out that is, in fact, in that line item that you just quoted. Make sense? Gary Lieberman Okay. That's very helpful. All right, thanks very much. Ben Breier Thank you all very much. All right, operator. I think we're going to have to close it there. Operator All right, Mr. Breier, I'll turn it back to you for closing. Ben Breier Thank you very much. Thank you. I know it was a busy quarter, a lot to announce. We appreciate everybody's interest in the Company, and I hope continued support. We think we have a good plan, and we're going to go out and execute it. And we'll look forward to talking to you about our progress next quarter. Thank you all very much. Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

      "text": "Bank Castles Of Sand: Blockchain Edition (Seeking Alpha) \nInternational Business Machines Corp. (NYSE: IBM ) has been making significant investments in M&A and restructuring. With the pace of these investments expected to decline and IBM poised to benefit from these efforts, the company faces “multiple levers to drive earnings growth in 2017,” Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s Wamsi Mohan said in a report. \nMohan upgraded the rating on the company from Neutral to Buy, while raising the price target from $170 to $185. Reasons For Upgrade \nMohan mentioned ten reasons for upgrading IBM to Buy: Earnings seem to have stabilized, and large negative revisions are unlikely. Cash flow per share would likely be flat or up in 2017. IBM’s dividend yield of 3.6 percent appears attractive “when accounting for the optionality of success in growth markets like Artificial Intelligence.” The company would face tailwinds in 2017 from lower restricting charges and savings from restructuring efforts. IBM is unlikely to increase its pace of investments, resulting in benefits from increased utilization SaaS revenues would begin contributing to a higher percentage of growth. The slowdown in IBM’s constant currency organic growth is likely to moderate and could turn to positive in 2018. Mainframe cycle in 2017 could drive a recovery in transactional revenues. “CIO survey suggests IBM gaining mindshare in business intelligence, analytics and Watson .” The company’s shares are currently trading at a discount on earnings to peers. \nMinutes after Thursday's opening bell, IBM was up 2.51 percent at $158.70.

Mark Kauzlarich Bloomberg i Order Reprint of this Story \nSurging for a second day after Donald Trump’s election win, Bank of America shares are trading Thursday at prices last seen in 2010. \nAround 10:15 a.m., the shares were up more than 4 percent to $18.74. The Charlotte-based bank’s stock last saw these heights in the spring of 2010 and last closed above $18 in July 2015. \nBank shares generally are rising for a second day on prospects of lighter regulation in a Trump administration, including changes to the Dodd-Frank financial reform law signed by President Barack Obama. \nIn a report Thursday, analysts with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods said Trump’s victory creates many opportunities but also risks for bank stocks. The possibility of less regulation is among opportunities, the report notes, but it adds there is also much uncertainty about what a Trump presidency will mean for banks. Restrictions on trade will be a negative for U.S. economic growth, which could mean less lending that would especially impact Bank of America and other mega banks, the report says. \n“We know very little about president-elect Trump's policies that will impact financials since ... priorities outside of trade, terrorism, and immigration were mentioned less,” the report says. \nEven Wells Fargo, which is reeling from a sales scandal , is riding the wave. Shares of the San Francisco-based bank, which maintains its biggest employment hub in Charlotte, were up more than 4 percent in mid-morning trading to $50.24. Wells shares closed Wednesday at $47.99, above their $49.77 closing price Sept. 7, the day before authorities fined it $185 million over its sales practices. \nAcross Wall Street, other stocks are also opening higher Thursday as the rebound in share prices around the world continued two days after Trump’s election. \nThe Dow Jones industrial average gained 142 points, or 0.7 percent, to 18,731 shortly after the opening bell. \nThe S&P 500 index was up 13 points, or 0.6 percent, to 2,176. The Nasdaq composite rose 31 points, or 0.6 percent, to 5,282. \nBanks and other financial stocks rose the most, while utilities and real estate stocks lost ground. \nThe Associated Press contributed",

      "text": "By Ben Levisohn After watching JPMorgan Chase ( JPM ), Bank of America ( BAC ), and Bank of New York Mellon ( BK ) and other universal banks surge yesterday , KBW’s Brian Kleinhanzl and Michael Brown worry that banking stocks could be ready for a pause. They explain why:\nGetty Images Universal Bank stocks rose 5.0%, on average, today as bank and most financial stocks were up strong on the prospects of better economic growth, higher interest rates , and less regulation under a Donald Trump administration. The move was surprising to us given how much uncertainty remains surrounding potential policies from the new administration.\nAbsolute P/Es Stretching: The current P/E multiples for Universal Banks are all above the average since 2010 for each individual bank, and JPM has reached the peak P/E multiple since 2010. We believe that P/E multiples could go above the peak P/E multiple since 2010 but there would need to be clearer signs about regulatory relief than what we have currently…\nPositioning Post the Rally: Given the optimism built into the share prices after the rally today, we would not be surprised to see stocks pause, or pull back, until clearer signs emerge regarding regulatory benefits or future economic growth catalysts. At this time, we are still looking to own high quality Universal Bank stocks and Bank of New York Mellon is our top pick followed by JPMorgan. Bank of New York Mellon is less exposed to a potential reinstatement of Glass-Steagall given the lack of a true consumer banking franchise. We also believe that Bank of New York Mellon will benefit more than Universal Bank peers from higher rates given the company’s shorter duration securities portfolio (about 2 years), and we already expected the net interest margin to trough prior to the move up in long-term rates today. For JPMorgan, we continue to believe that the company will be able to improve returns even without regulatory relief, so if the company did see less regulation then that would be additive. We also believe that both stocks would fare better than peers should a pullback occur.\nShares of JPMorgan Chase have gained 3.1% to $75.50 at 11:39 a.m. today, while Bank of New York Mellon has ticked up 0.1% to $45.58, and Bank of America has risen 2.3% to $18.38.",

      "text": "By Ben Levisohn After watching JPMorgan Chase ( JPM ), Bank of America ( BAC ), and Bank of New York Mellon ( BK ) and other universal banks surge yesterday , KBW’s Brian Kleinhanzl and Michael Brown worry that banking stocks could be ready for a pause. They explain why:\nGetty Images Universal Bank stocks rose 5.0%, on average, today as bank and most financial stocks were up strong on the prospects of better economic growth, higher interest rates , and less regulation under a Donald Trump administration. The move was surprising to us given how much uncertainty remains surrounding potential policies from the new administration.\nAbsolute P/Es Stretching: The current P/E multiples for Universal Banks are all above the average since 2010 for each individual bank, and JPM has reached the peak P/E multiple since 2010. We believe that P/E multiples could go above the peak P/E multiple since 2010 but there would need to be clearer signs about regulatory relief than what we have currently…\nPositioning Post the Rally: Given the optimism built into the share prices after the rally today, we would not be surprised to see stocks pause, or pull back, until clearer signs emerge regarding regulatory benefits or future economic growth catalysts. At this time, we are still looking to own high quality Universal Bank stocks and Bank of New York Mellon is our top pick followed by JPMorgan. Bank of New York Mellon is less exposed to a potential reinstatement of Glass-Steagall given the lack of a true consumer banking franchise. We also believe that Bank of New York Mellon will benefit more than Universal Bank peers from higher rates given the company’s shorter duration securities portfolio (about 2 years), and we already expected the net interest margin to trough prior to the move up in long-term rates today. For JPMorgan, we continue to believe that the company will be able to improve returns even without regulatory relief, so if the company did see less regulation then that would be additive. We also believe that both stocks would fare better than peers should a pullback occur.\nShares of JPMorgan Chase have gained 3.1% to $75.50 at 11:39 a.m. today, while Bank of New York Mellon has ticked up 0.1% to $45.58, and Bank of America has risen 2.3% to $18.38.",

      "text": "BAC is up two dollars this week. \nRates are pricing in the December hike already and I worry about catalysts. \nAnd at years' high valuations, I'm worried about how far BAC and other banks have come. Photo credit The man pictured above has stunned the world and won the US presidency. While this is not a political article of any kind, the simple fact is that investors thought Clinton would win on Tuesday and that meant that bank stocks (along with some others like Biotech) were toxic. With the President-Elect's fresh victory, however, bank stocks are flying and for many of the largest, hitting levels that are multi-year or all-time highs. One such stock is my long time favorite in the group, Bank of America (NYSE: BAC ). BAC has stayed the course with its strategy of de-risking and operating under the umbrella of safety and soundness and it seems that is finally paying off. But has it paid off a little too well? Has BAC come too far, too fast? Click to enlarge My first exhibit for this exercise is a five-year weekly chart of BAC that shows the extraordinary amount of time this stock has languished. We see lots of bouncing around - plenty of trading opportunities - but for long term holders, the past few years have been frustrating to say the least. But this week, on the back of Trump's win, BAC has broken out to levels it hasn't seen since the financial crisis. The gravity of that cannot be overstated and for me - a long term bull on this stock - it feels like vindication. After all, I've been pounding the table for years on BAC and finally, the stock is showing some life. The thing is that nothing material has changed in BAC's outlook since the election. The only thing that happened was that Clinton - who was seen as \"anti-big bank\" - was defeated and rates have come up a bunch. Again, I'm not here to argue about candidates but the simple fact of the matter is that Trump is better for the financials than Clinton would have been; just look at they way they've traded for the past two days. But is that enough for a mid-teens rally in two days? If we zoom in and look at the daily chart for the past year, we can see the rapidity with which BAC has moved up in the past couple of days. In fact, since the beginning of November, BAC has gone from $16.50 to nearly $19. That's an extraordinary move and while I love it, I have to wonder if the animal spirits are a little too wild these days. Is sentiment too good on the banks right now? This chart makes me think so. Click to enlarge The charts of the other big banks look pretty similar to this and if you just think about the enormity of the idea of these stocks making multi-year highs, you can appreciate the extraordinary time we are witnessing. It seems the days of banks being in the doghouse with investors have come and gone in a flash of boisterous talk and perfectly manicured hair. And that does something very important; it frees up investors to pay more than 9 times forward earnings for bank stocks, something investors as a whole haven't been particularly willing to do in the past few years. Rates have moved up a bunch in the past two days as the 10Y is now around 2.12% after starting the week at just over 1.8%. That's a huge move (or maybe even yuge ) for something as hard to move as the 10Y Treasury and while I welcome this move as a bank stock holder, I have to wonder how much staying power it has. After all, I believe the Fed will raise rates in December but I also believe it will be another 6 months or so before we get another one. The move up in rates we've just seen has fully priced in the December hike; what will be the catalyst for the next several months until the Fed talks about hiking again? Chair Yellen is very cautious and I suspect it will take a gargantuan effort from the FOMC to hike again anytime soon. Click to enlarge Bonds are extremely oversold right now and while I get the idea of the selloff, the magnitude and speed of it has been something to behold. US Treasury charts don't normally look like this and I'm worried the move up is a knee-jerk reaction that will have to be consolidated at best or somewhat retraced at worst. Again, if we're already pricing in a December hike, where's the catalyst for a further move up? BAC is as overbought as it has been for years and that means that consolidation must happen; there is no possible way for buyers to keep the pressure up like it has been for the past two days. That consolidation will likely include at least one retest of the $18 area that was such strong resistance for the past couple of years and what happens then will be paramount; does BAC break down and enter back into its channel or bounce and make a sustainable move higher? I think the answer is the latter but that doesn't stop me from thinking that BAC has come too far, too fast. I've been a steadfast bull on Bank of America for a long time but right now, I think it is time to ring the register and wait for a better price. Is BAC 15% better off today than it was on Monday? Maybe, but you'd have a hard time convincing me of that. The fact that Clinton didn't win is a victory for the banks but as I said, the December hike (and possibly more) has already been priced into rates and bank stocks. That leaves no catalysts other than organic growth and cost savings - two things BAC is doing a nice job of - until the next rate hike sometime next year. It's not that I'm not bullish on BAC any longer, it is just that we've seen months and months of gains accrue in two days so I'm a little cautious. When stocks like BAC and JPM move like they have this week, strange things are happening. After all, when was the last time BAC went for 12 times forward earnings ? That multiple has been reserved for bank royalty in the past few years but those companies are going for even higher multiples. Given that the outlook for ROE and earnings hasn't really changed but valuations have, I'm a lot more cautious today than I was on Monday. I think investors have gotten really excited and that means I'm ringing the register here. I'll buy back into BAC in relatively short order if it pulls back as I think it will. If BAC continues to go up without me, so be it; the risk of a pullback outweighs the risk to the upside for a stock at a years' high valuation and extreme overbought condition. No matter how much I like a stock, there's always a point where it is too rich for my blood and right now, Bank of America is there.

      "text": "Big banks like JPMorgan Chase ( JPM ) , Bank of America ( BAC ) and Citigroup ( C ) continued their postelection stock-market surge on Thursday, amid rising odds for less regulation, higher inflation and Fed rate hikes next year.\nCNBC also reported that JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon is being considered for Treasury secretary.\nShares of JPMorgan rallied 4.6% to close at 76.65 in the stock market today , setting a record high. Bank of America surged 4.4% to 18.76, blowing past buy range after breaking out Wednesday. Citigroup rose 3.9% to 53.61, reaching the highest in 11 months.\nWells Fargo ( WFC ) leapt 7.6%, adding to Wednesday's 5.4% pop. Goldman Sachs ( GS ) climbed 4.3% and Morgan Stanley ( MS ) gained 4.1%.\nThe U.S. 10-year Treasury yield added 7 basis points to 2.14% after skyrocketing Wednesday.\nIBD'S TAKE: Bank stocks have jumped, and the Dow has touched an all-time high following Trump's victory. So have other infrastructure-spending-friendly stocks , like construction companies. \nThursday's stock gains follow a strong performance for banking on Wednesday, amid greater anticipation that President-elect Donald Trump and a GOP-controlled Congress would work to curb industry regulations, including potentially gutting Dodd-Frank.\nAfter a wild, toxic, stressful presidential campaign in which the big banks were often a punching bag, analysts have also said Trump's more cordial, evenhanded victory speech — and its focus on a massive infrastructure overhaul — helped lift markets Wednesday after being pressured in the run-up to Election Day.\nAnalysts have said Trump's focus on tax cuts and public infrastructure spending could bring higher inflation on a flood of new debt coming to the market and higher bond yields.\nThe rising inflation, along with the current market rally, have also helped shore up the odds that the Federal Reserve might raise the benchmark interest rate , potentially boosting banks' net-interest margins.\nTrump's election, however, doesn't come without risks to the banking sector, analysts note.\n\"The opportunities come primarily from a steepening yield curve, increased volatility and reduced regulation,\" Keefe, Bruyette & Woods said in a research note. \"The risks come from a retrenchment of the U.S. from the global economy and trade agreements.\"\nIn a separate note, KBW said it was \"more cautious\" on Citigroup, given the company's exposure to Mexico, a country that could be among the most vulnerable if Trump shreds existing U.S. trade pacts.\nCitigroup in September said it saw \"tremendous untapped potential\" in Mexico.",

The company followed up that offering with a $600 million green bond in May 2015. The company’s latest green bond is the largest offering to date. \nA leader in corporate green bond underwriting \nGreen bonds have gained appeal among corporate issuers looking to diversify their sources of funding while keeping in mind the requirements of socially conscious investors and shareholders.

      "text": "In their Q3 2016 earnings report, Bank of America reported growth in their online and digital banking adoption to  21 million mobile banking active users .\n\"That’s better for customers, it’s also better for our shareholders,\" said Paul Donofrio, Bank of America CFO. \"It’s one-tenth the cost of walking into a branch.”\nThe key to mobile banking continuous quality success is automation.\nThe Bank of America example is not unique and is in line with the trend toward digital banking interactions over in-person banking. In fact, over 87% of those ages 15-35 use mobile banking according to a quarterly consumer trends survey of 3,000 U.S. banking customers, conducted by Harris Poll for Fiserv .\nConsumer banking at the branch is declining and banks are reducing their staff and branches to compensate. What’s even more telling in support of this trend is that 41% of the survey participants said that they would leave their wallet at home if they could store all the information they need in their mobile wallets. What’s interesting is that 30% of participants in a USC Annenberg Center survey said they would always drive home if they forgot their phone , regardless of distance.\nHistorically, most users limited their mobile banking interactions to checking account balances and statements. Today, more complex tasks are accomplished, such as check deposit via scanning, making payments and money transfers. In fact, 37% of consumers have cited that they leverage their bank mobile app to deposit checks .\n\nSource: Vendor surveys 2006-2013, Celent analysis \nWhile the digital trend is fascinating, we must ask what the inherent implications are from an application quality perspective? In our experience, 20 to 30% of test cases now include mobile deposit user flows. If you multiply that by all smartphones and tablets that support mobile banking technology, that’s a lot of executions (whether it’s smoke or regression testing).\nFingerprint technology is helping accelerate mobile banking adoption and establishes a strong sense of trust in the security of the app. Given its prominence, ideally, 30%-40% of test cases should leverage fingerprint authentication as the login mechanism or approval for in-app transactions.\nIn our experience, however, most of the mobile testing for these use cases is done manually due to time and resource constraints. Manual testing can’t possibly cover a complete set of testing scenarios such as smudges, different rotations, inverted check images, rescanning of checks that were already deposited, verifying fraud protection, validation of prints that were made by multiple users and more.\nIt goes without saying that incomplete test coverage impacts release frequency which can breed disgruntled users who are both noisy and critical .\nThe bottom line is that there must be a way to automate these test cases. Test scenarios should be driven by different images and prints, with proper validation, and testing should occur across all devices the bank supports. It must be part of the regression test, at a minimum, so that bugs are quickly identified. To achieve true continuous quality , an always-on cloud of devices is necessary.",

      "text": "Charlotte Hornets, Bank of America to Honor Lieutenant Colonel Richard Cantwell, USA, Ret., As First Yellow Ribbon Honoree of 2016-17 Season Posted: Nov 11, 2016 November 10, 2016 – The Charlotte Hornets and Bank of America on Friday will honor Lieutenant Colonel Richard Cantwell, USA, Ret., as this season’s first recipient of the season-long Yellow Ribbon Program. In partnership with Bank of America, the Hornets honor military members and veterans for their unwavering service to our country, and the Yellow Ribbon Program recognizes one of these heroes during one Hornets home game per month. Recipients are featured in the game program, honored prior to the national anthem and during an on-court presentation at halftime and given four tickets to the game. In addition, the Hornets make a $1,000 donation to the recipients' charity of choice. “The Charlotte Hornets and Bank of America are honored to continue the Yellow Ribbon Program this season,” said Hornets President & COO Fred Whitfield. “As we celebrate Veteran’s Day, we are proud to present this award to an outstanding veteran as we thank all members of the military, active and retired, for their service to our country.” Lieutenant Colonel Cantwell spent 20 years in the United States Army. During his tenure, he was a member of special operations teams that conducted threat and vulnerability assessments in countries around the world. As the MACOM Engineer for the U.S. Army Special Operations Command, he was responsible for the planning, programming, budgeting and execution of all related training and combat facilities. He also supervised the long range planning, environmental assessment and master planning for the command, as well as the preparation and submission of capital investment programs. Since retiring from the U.S. Army in 1995, Lieutenant Colonel Cantwell has been the Principal Liaison and Program Manager for Daily Progress between government staff of the United Arab Emirates and U.S.-based medical centers, specialists, consultants and administrators as part of his work at Huntersville, North Carolina-based Odell International. Lieutenant Colonel Cantwell’s greatest passion is helping other veterans and their families. In 2005, he founded the Patriot Charities, and in 2006, he launched the Military Family Lifestyle Foundation, before merging them earlier this year into the Patriot Military Family Foundation, of which he serves as chairman. Last season’s Yellow Ribbon Program honorees were Sergeant First Class Jeremy Hetrick, USA, Ret.; Senior Master Sergeant Horace E. Booker, USAF, Ret.; Specialist Daniel Schugel, USA, Ret.; Captain Sara Yon, USA, Ret.; First Sergeant Ezekiel Ancrum Jr., USA, Ret.; and First Sergeant Randy L. Moore, USA, Ret. Tags",

      "text": "A Few Non-QB Relates Take-a-ways from Bank of America Stadium By KelceKrazies on Nov 14, 2016, 8:21am CST +   + Comments Eric Berry won that game for us. The Pick 6 was great.. but before that there was 2-3 great PBUs against Olsen, many other great coverage plays that erased Olsen, and plenty of big run stops.. None more important than POPPING Cam on the sideline. No one on the Chiefs was hitting Newton, then Berry laid him out alone the sideline.. clean hit and Cam knew it but he was slow back to th huddle and I think it made him think more. Dee Ford was unblockable for Remmers. The only success was when Dickson stayed in to help. Even vs the run, Ford was dominant. The option rarely worked his way versus at Zombo/up the middle. He also had another sack taken qway because of defensive holding. DJ was coming off for passing downs a lot. Mostly replaced by just Sorenson which Cam took advantage of running early on. Occasionally Ramik but DJ seemed to play few 3rd down past g plays. Acker was overmatched by the bigger Car WRs. Peters just missed about 3 INTs, 2 of which cost us later. Conley was beating 1 on 1 press coverage incredibly easy. He was left alone on a CB a lot and won a lot. West had a good cutback run! The \"Keep Pounding\" slogan is lame and never fits. Their stadium is incredibly quiet, even when they wanna get into it on a 3rd down... you can have a normal conversation with the person next to you. Their fans were nice to rival fans but very sore about losing. Mostly to each other just down talking KC and claiming they got \"jobbed\" by refs and what not.  ",

      "text": "Credit Suisse catches post-election upgrade (Seeking Alpha) \nBank of America Merrill Lynch upgraded shares of Credit Suisse Group AG (ADR) (NYSE: CS ) from Neutral to a Buy rating, citing its recovery path. The firm boosted the price objective from CHF 13 to CHF 16 on the stock to reflect 14 percent earnings increase. Rating Justification \n“With a business still being turned around, continued exposure to FICC revenue streams (especially in the US), then we think CS fits this profile well. The CS story is still afflicted by a struggling Markets division but a turnaround from better revenues (easy comps to 1H17 in FICC) and costs (investor day on 7th December) could help push the stock up from its current 8.8x ‘18e EPS valuation,” analysts Andrew Stimpson and Michael Helsby said in a research note to clients. \nThe brokerage pointed out four key strategies from the elections results like increased interest rates, infrastructure spending, the strong U.S. dollar and cuts in tax rates. As far as the European Union is concerned, the firm thinks current conditions point to a recovery. \nThe lead analyst thinks the worst is over for Credit Suisse, and the company is well-positioned to deliver strong revenue growth for 2017. The turnaround in growth expectations from the American region would be a positive for the investment banking sector. For the overall performance, investor confidence on investment banking is a key factor. An Opposing Voice \nThe latest Bank of America rating is the opposite of another brokerage’s action from about 10 days back. Macquarie downgraded the stock from Outperform to a Neutral rating on November 4. \nAt last check, the stock gained 3.38 percent to $14.70. \nImage Credit: By User:Mattes (Own work) [CC BY 2.0 de], via Wikimedia Commons Latest Ratings for CS",

      "text": " The Frick Pittsburgh\nThree historic European tapestries to be conserved as part of Bank of America initiative to preserve culturally important works of art at museums worldwide\nPITTSBURGH , Nov. 14, 2016 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- The Frick Art & Historical Center (The Frick Pittsburgh) in Pittsburgh's Point Breeze neighborhood announces that it will receive a Bank of America 2016 Art Conservation Project grant for the conservation of three early-16 th -century European tapestries in its collection. The Frick Pittsburgh's collection includes four tapestries purchased by founder Helen Clay Frick from 1965–1970 specifically for The Frick Art Museum's rotunda, where they are on permanent display. One of the tapestries, Rest on the Flight Into Egypt, which is of Flemish origin, was recently conserved through a National Endowment for the Arts grant award. Of the three tapestries to be conserved as part of the Bank of America Art Conservation Project- The Court of Love- is also of Flemish origin, while the other two- Lady and Attendants and Two Musicians- were woven by the French School of Loire.\nFrick Director Robin Nicholson says, \"We are honored and delighted to receive this generous grant and are most grateful for the generous support of Bank of America. The Frick's historic tapestries are enjoyed by tens of thousands of visitors to The Frick Art Museum annually, and much-needed conservation work will ensure that they remain intact for the enjoyment of future generations.\"\nBank of America Vice-Chairman Terry Laughlin remarked: \"The Bank of America Art Conservation Project is an extension of our global commitment to supporting the arts and delivering both social and economic value to the community. Our support for the arts is diverse, and includes loaning our art collection to museums at no cost, sponsorships, grants to arts organizations for arts education, and the preservation of cultural treasures. I'm delighted that we are making this grant to The Frick Pittsburgh in support of a great institution and its good works in the Pittsburgh community.\"\nFrick Director of Curatorial Affairs Sarah Hall comments, \"The Frick is fortunate to be one of more than 20 museums awarded funding by the Bank of America Art Conservation Project this year. Textile conservation of 500-year-old tapestries is a highly specialized and labor intensive endeavor, and this grant allows us to continue to advance both the physical care of the tapestries and our research into their history. We plan to document the conservation through expanding the website, fricktapestry.org.\"\nThe conservation work is planned to be completed by expert textile conservator Julia Woodward Dippold of Baltimore, Maryland , who has worked with the Frick's tapestry collection for nearly twenty years and has completed projects for major museums and collections internationally, including the Ringling Museum, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the National Gallery of Art. The work will commence in January 2017 and is expected to be completed by July 2018 .\nABOUT THE BANK OF AMERICA ART CONSERVATION PROJECT\nThe Bank of America Art Conservation Project is a unique program that provides grants to nonprofit museums throughout the world to conserve historically or culturally significant works of art that are in danger of deterioration.

      "text": "Send Message Summary \n‘Bond king’ Jeffrey Gundlach believes the yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury bond could hit 6% in the next four or five years. \nBank of America is one of the most interest rate-sensitive stocks, due to its exposure to residential mortgage-backed securities, a relatively large variable-rate commercial loan book and lower non-deposit funding. \nAccording to our estimates, Bank of America could hit $49 per share by 2020, if Gundlach is right about Treasury yields’ trajectory. \n'Bond king' Jeffrey Gundlach believes the yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury could hit 6% in the next four or five years. According to Mr. Gundlach, under a Trump presidency the U.S. economy 'could produce an inflation rate of 3% and nominal growth of 4% to 6% in gross domestic product; if nominal GDP pushes toward 4%, 5%, or even 6%, there is no way you are going to get bond yields to stay below 2%.\" \nAt first glance, the 6% yield in this low-to-zero rate environment looks like a whopping number. However, Mr. Gundlach's outlook looks quite reasonable, given President-elect's agenda. Mr. Trump wants to provide the U.S. economy with a big fiscal stimulus as he proposes large-scale tax cuts and a huge amount of new infrastructure spending. In fact, Trump's economic stimulus is at least twice as large as Clinton's measures. This aggressive fiscal policy would require greater Treasury issuance, prompting increased inflation and higher long-term interest rates. \nDeutsche Bank Research calculated that Trump's series of packages would increase government debt by $5.3trn over 10 years. \nSource: Deutsche Bank \nA highly interest rate-sensitive balance sheet \nIn 3Q16, Bank of America (NYSE: BAC ) switched from using the retrospective method to the contractual method for premium amortization on debt securities, resulting in decreased earnings volatility. As a reminder, by contrast to its large-cap peers, Bank of America had been using the retrospective method. Under this accounting methodology, premiums on mortgage-backed securities are amortized over the estimated lives of these bonds. As such, the retrospective method significantly increases interest rate sensitivity of any bank using this set of accounting principles and BAC's case was a perfect example. The following chart shows a correlation between BAC's 'market-related NII adjustments' (i.e. gains/losses from RMBS premium amortization) and changes in U.S. Treasury bond yields. \nClick to enlarge \nSource: Bloomberg, Renaissance Research \nUnder the contractual method, BAC will amortize premiums on mortgage-backed securities over the contractual lives of the RMBS. \"The contractual life\" principle means that the amortization period is fixed at the time the bond is purchased and is not reassessed every quarter. The new method is consistent with BAC's peers and will meaningfully reduce 'market-related NII adjustments,' i.e. non-cash charges/benefits. \nHowever, even under the contractual method, BAC's interest income is still highly rate-sensitive, with the significant part of that sensitivity coming from the long end of the yield curve. According to the latest 10-Q filing , a 100bps instantaneous parallel increase in rates from the forward curve would increase the bank's net interest income by $5.3bn (vs. $7.5bn at 2Q16), while a 100bps instantaneous curve steepening (increase in long-term rates) would result in a $2.1bn pick-up in NII (vs +$4.5bn at 2Q16). \nClick to enlarge \nSource: Company data \nAs such, BAC's balance sheet remains highly interest rate-sensitive despite recent methodology changes. \nIt is also worth mentioning that Bank of America benefits from a lower share of wholesale funding, thanks to its strong deposit franchise. There is a great academic paper by the Fed, illustrating that retail deposits rates are downwards-flexible and upwards-sticky. Basically, the paper suggests that, by contrast to wholesale funding, deposit rates are likely to lag increases in policy and market rates. In other words, retail deposit rates tend to be sticky in a rising interest rate environment. As such, should market yields increase, Bank of America would still enjoy lower-than-average cost of funding. In addition, as the table below shows, around 20% of BAC's deposits are non-interest bearing, implying that BAC's revenues have more leverage to rising rates. \nClick to enlarge \nSource: Bloomberg \nValuation: $49 per share by 2020? \nThe below chart shows that there is a strong historical correlation between BAC's share price and yields on the 10-year Treasury note. So if history tells us anything, then BAC could easily hit $50s in a 5-6% yield environment. \nClick to enlarge \nSource: Bloomberg \nMore importantly, the bank's return on equity is closely correlated with the 10-yr yield. Notably, the bank's RoE was around 20%, when the yield was close to 5-6%. \nClick to enlarge \nSource: Bloomberg \nOne can argue that it is almost impossible for a large-cap universal U.S. bank to reach a 20%+ return on equity in this \"post-Great-Recession\" regulatory environment. That being said, the Republicans Party and President-elect Trump insist that the Dodd-Frank Act be amended and loosened. As such, we would not rule out that stricter banking regulations coming to an end. \nOur valuation analysis does suggest that BAC's share price could hit $49 by 2020 under the assumptions suggested by Mr.Gundlach (, an 6% yield on the 10-yr Treasury note by YE2020, an inflation rate of 3% and nominal GDP growth 6%). We also assume that BAC's interest rate sensitivity will remain stable, as per its 3Q 10-Q. \nOne should keep in mind that it is still a rough calculation and a simplified analysis, as it does not take into account any positives from better FICC revenue environment or potential negatives from rising loan loss provisions and other variables. For simplicity's sake, we also assume no capital gains distribution. However, this analysis perfectly illustrates that BAC could earn above-cost-of-capital returns in this new \"Donald Trump\" interest rate environment. \nSource: Renaissance Research \nIt is also important to note that, should market yields increase by c400bps, as suggested by Mr.Gundlach, BAC's cost of equity would increase as well. As a reminder, the bank's implied cost of equity is currently at 11.3%. \nClick to enlarge \nSource: Bloomberg \nBottom line \nU.S. Financials rallied after the elections on the back of rising bond yields and prospects of more favourable regulations. However, there is a big \"if\", and we would not rule out that these gains will be reversed by the end of the year. That being said, our analysis illustrates that Bank of America could earn above-cost-of-capital returns in this new interest rate environment. If Jeffrey Gundlach is right about bond yields, BAC could easily hit the $50s territory by 2020. \nAs a buy-side analyst and a deputy portfolio manager, I oversee a financials-focused fund, and will be continuously providing research coverage on developments with Bank of America and other global banks, insurers, asset managers and other financial companies.

      "text": "Bank of America survives challenging market but loses on net interest margins. \nLow return on assets offset by surplus potential for lending as economy improves. \nThe bank needs to focus more on local market considering volatile global political and economic conditions. The third quarter of the year saw a difficult economic environment for all the banking corporations. Economic growth stuttered and federal government insisted on keeping the interest rates low. This meant lesser lending opportunities as well as lower returns on loans. Retail sales and industrial production also declined which reduced demand for bank loans even further. Brexit in June also threatened the future profitability of banks by endangering the biggest market for banking products in the world. U.S. Presidential elections further added uncertainty to the economy. Despite such challenging conditions Bank of America (NYSE: BAC ) seems to have its interest expenses and non-interest expenses in control while increasing its incomes on both ends. The company's stock also showed upward movement. However this is not the entire story. There are certain elements that go to the bank's credit for performing well but there are serious challenges expected in the future, and the firm does not seem ready to tackle them. Let's consider the interest earning assets and non-performing loans (NPLs). The firm has been heavily involved in public sector banking. Even though last year, Bank of America dropped some smaller towns and cities from the list of its clients, it still has a major proportion of its assets invested in the energy-sector. Considering the volatility of this high risk sector, the company increased its provision for credit losses by $44 million in the third quarter of the year. This signals a high-risk but normal return venture for the bank. The deteriorating conditions of the overall economy can hit the energy sector as well. If the industrial demand goes down, the energy sector will suffer which in turn, could be problematic for the bank. Another risky venture in which the bank has been lending heavily is the exploration and production of oil field services. The fall in the crude oil prices hit the oil market and also affected all the related businesses, banks included. However, now that the oil prices have started to show recovery, it is likely that the bank's investments in this sector will not lead to any noteworthy losses or NPLs. In the meantime, the bank had also taken precautionary measures. Its exposure in this sector declined by $2.7 billion, or 40 per cent, since the start of 2016. The relative improvement in the NPLs can be partly attributed to this shift in investments. However, the oil sector still remains among the major investments of the bank and the fluctuations in oil prices are still a matter of concern for the lending institutions as well. The bank increased its provision for credit losses for this sector by $1 billion. The metals and mining sector, however, remains problematic for the bank. Majority of the NPLs for the past quarter for the bank came from this sector. There had been no major changes in investments in this sector however, despite the increase in provisions to protect against those potential losses. Some insulation against this risk is seen from the assets issued to the real estate sector. The string demand coupled with tight loan-to-value rations in this sub-sector is low-risk, high-return venture for the bank. Since the real estate market itself has become wary of economic fluctuations, and since there are no signs of a market crash in this sector, it is safe to assume that these investments by the bank will not pose a nonperforming risk. The bank's investment in this sector increases over the past nine months by $11.7 billion, which signals a shift towards stable markets. This is good news for investors and more assets in safe markets means less chances of potential losses. Even if an overall analysis is made of the bank's performance lately, its ratio of NPLs to performing loans improved over the past three months. Net NPL amount also showed reduction on a year-on-year basis. This ratio has been consistently improving since 2010. In 2010, the ratio was 3.5 per cent which fell to 1.4 per cent in 2014, 1.2 per cent in 2015 and currently it is merely 0.7 per cent. This signals improvement in the quality of lending by the bank. By raising its quality of loans, the bank has insulated itself against potential bad loans but there is still room to improve this risk factor by investing in safer sectors and avoiding high risk areas. Considering the high-risk portfolio of the bank, it is hardly a surprise that it is performing poorly as compared to its competitors. The net interest margin (NIM) for the firm was lower than the industry as well as its own past average. The net interest margin for the bank in the third quarter of 2016 was 1.13 per cent, (calculated by dividing total net interest income of $10,201 million by net loans of $903,902 million). The average NIM for American banks hover around 2 to 3 per cent while Bank of America itself has been able to stay at a steady 2 per cent or higher. The current value means that the bank failed to capitalize on the opportunities which were fully exploited by its competitors. JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM ) had NIM of 2.65 per cent, Wells Fargo's (NYSE: WFC ) was 2.82 per cent, Citibank's (NYSE: C ) 2.86 per cent and Cascade Bancorp (NASDAQ: CACB ) reported 3.43 per cent for the third quarter of the year. Click to enlarge Source: Quarterly report The reduction in NIM could partly be explained by the bank's inability to expand in the local business market as well. As the excerpt given above shows, global banking showed improvement but the earnings from local business banking could not increase over last year's value. This can be bad news because the recent global events are likely to constrain the bank's international operations. With Brexit, the fears are rising of losing out on one of the biggest international markets. And with Donald Trump elected as the new president, the global economy has already shown jolts and is likely to worsen. Trade wars with China , potential expulsion of a large number of immigrants and likely crisis on Iran's nuclear deal are all potential threats for global economic environment. Bank of America needs to strengthen its local foothold and increase its operations and efficiency in the local market. In a nutshell, it can be said that while the company's overall financial decisions have improved its quality of loans and reduced the actual NPLs, the risk of NPLs is not reduced as much. For that reason, the bank has to increase its provisions for credit losses. That not only affects its ability to invest or lend more, but also creates a pressure on the net interest income earned. From an investor's point of view, BAC stock is a good purchase at the moment. It would qualify for a hold rating for the investors who already have a stake in this stock. However, the stock is not likely to start reaping big benefits in the near future. When the global economy stabilizes and the local market improves, if Bank of America is able to adjust its interest earning assets, it will certainly be among the early winners.

      "text": "Privacy policy | More Newsletters NBC 7 Accion San Diego was named Bank of America’s Neighborhood Builder for 2016 Monday and received a $200,000 grant. The organization is part of a national network that uses funds to help small business owners expand. Often, the loans offered by Accion San Diego are more helpful to small businesses because they consider more than a company’s credit score. Loans ranging from $300 to $75,000 help businesses owned by veterans, women or minorities as well as green businesses or startups. Accion San Diego CEO Elizabeth Schott was shocked to learn they had received the grant. Schott said many non-profits know there is a demand for their services but it’s hard to expand without capacity-building funds. “That funding is so important and crucial to bringing your organization to the next level,” Schott said. 1 Firefighter Injured Battling 28-Acre Gopher Fire She said she will use the money for staffing, professional development and technical platforms. San Diego Market Manager for Bank of America Krista Torquato was on hand for the check presentation Monday. She said Accion San Diego, which was selected from two dozen non-profit organizations, was a great match for the bank and its program. Published 2 hours ago",

      "text": "Zacks.com featured highlights: Seagate Technology, POSCO, Sabre, TurkcellIletisimHizmetleri AS and Bank of America November 14, 2016, 09:30:00 AM EDT By Zacks Equity Research, Zacks.com Shutterstock photo \nFor Immediate Release \nChicago, IL - November 14, 2016 - Stocks in this week's article include Seagate Technology plc (NASDAQ: STX - Free Report ), POSCO (NYSE: PKX - Free Report ), Sabre Corporation (NASDAQ: SABR - Free Report ), TurkcellIletisimHizmetleri AS (NYSE: TKC - Free Report ) and Bank of America Corporation (NYSE: BAC - Free Report ). \nScreen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research: \n5 Best Value Stocks with Low PEG Ratios \nThe popularity of value investing is growing by leaps and bounds, not just because of its appropriateness in the current market scenario, but mostly for the reason that it is one of the favorite investing mantras of billionaire investors. However, apparently simple to understand, this investing discipline has historically shown dangerous outcomes a number of times just because of people's oversight of its basics. \nWarren Buffet believes that proper understanding of the \"intrinsic value\" of a stock may ease out many problems in this respect. According to him, going by the fundamentals of value investing, as we pick stocks which the market is currently undervaluing, we also need to focus on the earnings growth potential of a stock. \nWhile yardsticks such as dividend yield, the ratio of price to earnings, to sales or to book value are the most common value investing matrices which can easily single out stocks trading at a discount, these ratios fail to consider the future potential of a stock. PEG is the ratio with earnings growth component in it, however it is supposed to be one of the solutions here. \nThe PEG ratio is defined as: (Price/ Earnings)/ Earnings Growth Rate \nA lower PEG ratio is always better for value investors. \nWhile P/E alone fails to identify a true value stock, PEG helps finding the intrinsic value of a stock. \nUnfortunately, this ratio is often neglected due to investors' limitation to calculate the future earnings growth rate of a stock. \nThere are some drawbacks to using the PEG ratio though. It doesn't consider the very common situation of changing growth rates such as the forecast of the first three years at a very high growth followed by a sustainable but lower growth rate in the long term. \nHence, PEG-based investing can turn out to be even more rewarding if some other relevant parameters are also taken into consideration. \nHere are the screening criteria for a winning strategy: \nPEG Ratio less than X Industry Median \nP/E Ratio (using F1) less than X Industry Median (For more accurate valuation purpose.) \nZacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) (Whether good market conditions or bad, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 have a proven history of success.) \nMarket Capitalization greater than $1 Billion (This helps us to focus on companies that have strong liquidity.) \nAverage 20 Day Volume greater than 50,000 : A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable. \nPercentage Change F1 Earnings Estimate Revisions (4 Weeks) greater than 5%: Upward estimate revisions add to the optimism, suggesting further bullishness. \nValue Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of 'A' or 'B' when combined with a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 offer the best upside potential. \nHere are five of the 18 stocks that qualified the screening: \nSeagate Technology plc (NASDAQ: STX - Free Report ) : This is an electronic data storage technology and solutions company with business spread across Singapore, the U.S., the Netherlands, among its other markets. Seagate can be an impressive value investment pick with its Zacks Rank #1 and Value Style Score 'A'. Apart from a discounted PEG and P/E, the stock also has an impressive expected growth rate of 64% for the current fiscal. \nPOSCO (NYSE: PKX - Free Report ) : POSCO is a steel rolled products and plates provider in South Korea and internationally. This Zacks Rank #1 and Value Style Score 'A' company also has an impressive growth rate of 27.5% for the next fiscal. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here . \nSabre Corporation (NASDAQ: SABR - Free Report ) : This is the leading technology provider to the global travel industry. Sabre's software, data, mobile and distribution solutions are used by hundreds of airlines and thousands of hotel properties to manage critical operations, including passenger and guest reservations, revenue management, flight, network and crew management. The company can be an impressive value investment pick with its Zacks Rank #1 and Value Style Score 'B'. The company's long-term expected earnings growth rate is at 17.3%. \nTurkcellIletisimHizmetleri AS (NYSE: TKC - Free Report ) : This company is a provider of mobile telecommunication services. The company operates in two segments, Turkcell Turkey and Turkcell International. It offers mobile communication and fixed voice services; and broadband services that consist of mobile broadband, fiber to the home/building, and ADSL. The company holds a Zacks Rank #1 and a Value Style Score 'B'. It also has an impressive growth rate of 7.1% for the next fiscal. \nBank of America Corporation (NYSE: BAC - Free Report ) : Headquartered in Charlotte, NC, Bank of America Corporation is a financial holding company.

      "text": "Order Reprint of this Story \nBank of America’s customer satisfaction score improved in an annual survey of U.S. banks, but the Charlotte-based company remains at the bottom among its biggest competitors, according to the latest report by the American Customer Satisfaction Index. \nThe report released Tuesday also shows San Francisco-based Wells Fargo fell from first place to second place behind Citigroup among the largest banks. Although Wells Fargo is reeling from a fake-accounts scandal, the report attributed Wells’ drop in the rankings more to its failure to keep up with gains from peers. \nBanks as a group, from community banks to national banks, received their highest customer satisfaction score in the study’s more than 20-year history. That improvement reflects in large part technological advances, such as in mobile banking, that provide customers benefits such as greater convenience, David VanAmburg, ACSI managing director, said in an interview. \n“Consumers are in fact somewhat happier with their banking experience overall ... from the largest national banks to the smallest community banks,” VanAmburg said. \n[ J.D. Power: Bank of America still lags rivals in customer service despite gains] \nAs usual, though, larger banks scored lower than their smaller competitors, which excel particularly in staff courtesy, transaction speed and website quality, the report says. \nCustomers see the only advantage from larger banks as being their number and location of branches and automated teller machines, according to the report. National banks also scored poorest in the category of competitiveness of interest rates. \nBut higher scores for national banks, a group that includes Bank of America and Wells Fargo, helped narrow this year’s score gap between smaller competitors. \nBank of America, the second-largest U.S. bank by assets, posted its largest score ever, 75, on the 100-point scale, up seven points from last year’s score of 68. \nThat’s also the highest score for Bank of America since a post-financial crisis low of 66 in 2012. Bank of America’s 10.3 percent growth over last year was also the second-best improvement among the largest banks, behind Citibank’s 12.3 percent gain. \nIt still wasn’t enough to lift Bank of America from last place, a position it now shares with JPMorgan Chase, the biggest U.S. bank, which scored four points better than last year. \n“Bank of America has been in a laggard position in the industry for a very long time. For whatever reason it’s taken Bank of America longer to rebound,” VanAmburg said. “So this is a big move for them, a big improvement. It’s something that they should be able to build on going forward.” \nWells Fargo’s score rose one point to 76. That was smaller than the nine-point gain by Citibank, whose score rose to 82, now the highest among the largest banks. \nVanAmburg said it’s hard to attribute Wells’ growth lag to the fake-accounts scandal, because that matter affected a small percentage of its customers. Instead, Wells’ showing reflects customers’ experience of service quality, he said. \nIn a statement, Wells Fargo spokesman Josh Dunn said the bank is pleased with the results of the survey and that it’s committed to continuously improving customers’ experience. \nBank of America spokeswoman Kathleen Von Bergen said the bank continues to make strides with customer experience and the survey’s results represent that progress. \nThe American Customer Satisfaction Index report covers banks, credit unions, health insurance, property/casualty insurance, life insurance and internet investment services. It is based on interviews with 9,608 customers, chosen at random and contacted via email between July 11 and September 23.",

      "text": "Bank of America Captures Millennials on Vice toggle menu Financial Services \nMillennials have been a difficult group for banks to engage with. They do not embrace the suit-and-tie in-branch service of their parents’ generation, but still want personalized attention. Results of an industry study suggest that consumers 18 to 25-years old want their financial institution to be their “overall financial caretaker” and advise them on best financial practices. \nBank of America – ranked Genius in L2’s 2016 Financial Services study – has connected with millennials by providing the digital advice they seek. In 2013, it produced a short video series titled “Better Money Habits” answering commonly asked financial services questions like “I want to get started with retirement”. These bite-sized videos and infographics were promoted on Facebook, Twitter, and eventually Pinterest. \nIn addition to addressing millennial concerns, Bank of America followed them to their media channels of choice. In 2015, it created a personal finance show called “The Business of Vice” and aired it on Vice. Now, it has branded filters on Snapchat and a partnership with Facebook messenger. \nWhile it’s difficult to calculate the longevity or ROI of these tactics, Bank of America has made it clear that it is committed to experimenting and forging relationships with the younger generation. Given that 76% of affluent millennials are open to switching to a non-banking institution for their financial needs (like Google or Amazon) other financial services firms must work to establish rapport and recognition within the younger generation. L2 emails keep you up to date on how brands are leveraging digital to grow their businesses. ",

      "text": "Pipeline activists who blocked TD Bank in court; new protest at Bank of America planned Tuesday Nov 15, 2016 at 11:40 AM Nov 15, 2016 at 11:46 AM \nMark Sullivan Telegram & Gazette Staff @mcnsullivan \nWORCESTER — As two protesters who blockaded the doorway of TD Bank on Monday were arraigned Tuesday morning, environmental activists were planning a new protest at Bank of America Tuesday afternoon.\nActivists are targeting banks that are investors in the proposed Dakota Access oil pipeline, which Native Americans and environmentalist allies seek to stop from crossing tribal lands in North Dakota.    \nJennifer Burt, 31, of 144 Pleasant St., Worcester, and Kyle Schulz, 27, of 22 Castle St., Worcester, appeared before Judge Robert L. Pellegrini in Central District Court Tuesday on charges of trespassing and disorderly conduct. \nThe charges stemmed from their Monday protest at TD Bank, 370 Main St., when Ms. Burt and Mr. Schulz locked wrists inside a concrete device bolted to the bank's front doors. It took firefighters 45 minutes to dislodge them using an air chisel.\nA not guilty plea was entered on the defendants' behalf, and they were released on their own recognizance under order to stay away from TD Bank properties. They are due back in court Dec. 23.\nA press release announced a peaceful demonstration would be held at 1 p.m. Tuesday at the Bank of America, 365 Main St.\nOrganizers said the protest was planned as part of a \"national day of action\" against the Dakota Access Pipeline at Army Corps of Engineers offices and banks directly funding the pipeline. The Bank of America, like TD Bank, is an investor in the project.\nAccording to The Associated Press, the $3.8 billion pipeline would carry North Dakota oil through South Dakota and Iowa to a shipping point in Illinois. The Standing Rock Sioux believe the pipeline, which will skirt the tribe's reservation, threatens their drinking water and cultural sites.",

      "text": " 06pm EST MOVES-Societe Generale hires Bank of America's Gumier as Italy country head - sources By Pamela Barbaglia | LONDON \nLONDON Nov 15 Societe Generale has poached Bank of America's head of global corporate banking for Italy, Alessandro Gumier, to lead its Italian business, four sources familiar with the matter said. \nGumier, who joined the Wall Street lender over a decade ago, will take over from Societe Generale's group country head Patrizia Micucci, who stepped down in July. \nOfficials at Societe Generale and Bank of America declined to comment. \nGumier's appointment comes after Bank of America's Chief Executive for Italy, Marco Morelli, left the bank in September to lead the restructuring of Monte dei Paschi di Siena as its new CEO. \nA series of senior dealmakers have left international banks active in Italy recently, including at Japan's Nomura and Britain's Barclays. \nThat's despite Italy being home to some of the biggest fee payers in Europe. Ailing lender Monte dei Paschi paid banks more than 400 million euros ($429 million) for two capital increases in as many years and is now working on an expensive rescue plan. \nMilan-based Gumier has over 15 years of experience in banking, having previously worked at Citigroup and Standard Chartered. \nHe will leave Bank of America this week, handing over to Mario Ambrosio, a managing director at Bank of America's Italian corporate banking business, who has been promoted to head the division. \nAmbrosio will report to Fernando Vicario, head of corporate banking across Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA). ($1 = 0.9322 euros) (Reporting by Pamela Barbaglia; Editing by Rachel Armstrong and Adrian Croft)  ",

      "text": "Order Reprint of this Story \nA shareholder activist is taking another stab at a proposal calling for Charlotte’s Bank of America to study whether the bank should be broken up. \nIt marks the fourth time Bartlett Naylor has pushed such a motion. In 2015, a similar measure from Naylor received minimal shareholder support and failed to pass. In other years, Bank of America has successfully fought to prevent similar Naylor proposals from going to a shareholder vote. \nIn his latest proposal, which he submitted to the bank Tuesday, Naylor calls on the bank’s board of directors to examine whether divesting all non-core banking business segments would enhance shareholder value, and whether the bank should divide into a number of independent firms. \nThe proposal cites, among other things, the “disastrous Countrywide acquisition, misrepresentations during the Merrill Lynch acquisition, massive mortgage fraud (and) a $4 billion account(ing) error that festered for years before discovery.” The board should consider retaining independent advisers to carry out such an evaluation, says the measure, which Naylor wants investors to vote on at the bank’s annual shareholders meeting next spring. \nA Bank of America spokesman declined to comment. \nIn arguing against a similar Naylor proposal in 2015, the bank noted that since 2010 it has trimmed hundreds of billions of dollars in assets from its balance sheet while also increasing its capital. Among other things, the bank said it continually assesses which businesses and assets would better support the company and return value to stockholders through divestitures. \nOnly 4.1 percent of voting investors supported a similar proposal from Naylor at Bank of America’s 2015 annual shareholder meeting. \nIn September, Naylor filed a shareholder proposal urging Wells Fargo to study the idea of breaking itself up, in the wake of the San Francisco-based bank’s fake-accounts scandal . \nNaylor breakup proposals at Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase failed to pass earlier this year. Naylor is financial policy advocate for Washington, D.C.,-based consumer advocacy group Public Citizen.",

      "text": "Dakota pipeline protesters target Bank of America in Worcester; activists who blocked TD Bank are arraigned   11:40 AM Nov 15, 2016 at 6:56 PM \nMark Sullivan Telegram & Gazette Staff @mcnsullivan \nWORCESTER — \"Water is life,\" read a sign held by protesters chanting and singing in a driving rain outside Bank of America in downtown Worcester on Tuesday afternoon.\nThe more than four dozen environmental activists huddled under umbrellas in the downpour were protesting Bank of America's investment in the Dakota Access Pipeline project in North Dakota. \nIt was the second protest by anti-pipeline activists at a downtown Worcester bank in two days. On Monday, two activists who locked arms in a block of concrete barricaded the doors of TD Bank across the street.\nActivists are targeting banks that are investors in the proposed Dakota Access oil pipeline, which Native Americans and environmentalist allies seek to stop from crossing tribal lands in North Dakota.  \nOrganizers said the protest was planned as part of a \"national day of action\" against the pipeline, with protests at Army Corps of Engineers offices and banks directly funding the pipeline. The Bank of America, like TD Bank, is an investor in the project, protesters say.\nAccording to The Associated Press, the $3.8 billion pipeline would carry North Dakota oil through South Dakota and Iowa to a shipping point in Illinois. The Standing Rock Sioux believe the pipeline, which will skirt the tribe's reservation, threatens their drinking water and cultural sites.\nPickets outside the Bank of America at 365 Main St. sang \"We Shall Not Be Moved\" while holding placards reading \"You Can't Drink Oil,\" \"People Over Pipelines\" and \"No DAPL.\"\nAs the rain came down at 1:30 p.m. the ink could be seen running from the letters of a \"No Oil\" placard held by one protester.\nWhen an occasional passing motorist beeped a horn in support, the protesters whooped and cheered.\nWorcester police officers and a bank security guard eyed the proceedings on the sidewalk from the bank doorway. Protesters made no attempt to disrupt traffic or block entry to the bank.\nProtester Matthew Shorten of Barre said, \"I came to support the protest because the pipeline should be stopped, or at least rerouted away from Native American land and the Missouri River.\n\"Across the country, across the world, overwhelmingly everyone I talk to is opposed to the pipeline,\" said Mr. Shorten, a retired teacher in the Quabbin Regional schools, who said he will cancel his Bank of America credit card.\n\"We hope the people in the bank will hear this and reconsider their investment,\" he said.\nMusician Jim Scott of Shrewsbury was clapping along, leading the protesters in song, until he had to take a break because his hands grew so cold in the chilly rain.\n\"For years in my songs I've been singing about the environment and celebrating the Earth,\" said Mr. Scott, a classical and jazz guitarist and editor of the \"Earth and Spirit Songbook.\"\nThrough his music, he said, he tries to \"save the Earth by moving people's hearts.\" It was in that spirit that he came out Tuesday to \"stand in nature\" and protest the pipeline in North Dakota, which he said he visited in the summer. \nHe called the pipeline \"one more injustice\" against Native Americans after hundreds of years of broken treaties.\nThe Nipmuc tribe of Grafton signed on to Tuesday's protest. \"They're supporting Standing Rock,\" said Ken Elliott of Worcester, at the protest with his wife, Naomi Richardson Elliott, whose tribal name is Dancing Feather, and who is treasurer of the Nipmuc Tribal Council. \"What they're doing out there just isn't right.\"\nA Bank of America spokeswoman, Kelly Sapp, stated: \"Bank of America is not a lender in the project-level financing for the Dakota Access Pipeline. As a company we have a long-standing history of supporting both the heritage of Native American communities and the environment.\n\"We are not involved in the project,\" Ms. Sapp said via email.\nOpponents of the pipeline project say Bank of America has committed financial resources to the parent company of pipeline developer Dakota LLC. \nEarlier Tuesday, the two protesters who blockaded the doorway of TD Bank on Monday were arraigned in Central District Court.\nJennifer Burt, 31, of 144 Pleasant St., Worcester, and Kyle Schulz, 27, of 22 Castle St., Worcester, appeared before Judge Robert L. Pellegrini on charges of trespassing and disorderly conduct. \nThe charges stemmed from their Monday protest at TD Bank, 370 Main St., when Ms. Burt and Mr. Schulz locked wrists inside a concrete device bolted to the bank's front doors. It took firefighters 45 minutes to dislodge them using an air chisel.\nA plea of not guilty was entered on the defendants' behalf, and they were released on their own recognizance, under order to stay away from TD Bank properties. They are due back in court Dec. 23.",

      "text": "By Ben Levisohn Big bank stocks like JPMorgan Chase ( JPM ), Citigroup ( C ) and Wells Fargo ( WFC ) have had wonderful Novembers thanks to Donald Trump’s election victory –and no bank stock has had a better month than Bank of America ( BAC ). It’s time to take profits, says Guggenheim’s Eric Wasserstrom and Jeff Cantwell , who downgrade it to Neutral from Buy. They explain why:\nGetty Images We are downgrading Bank of America to NEUTRAL, notwithstanding our above-consensus 2017-18E EPS. Our downgrade is motivated by three factors: 1) Although we are increasing our fair value estimate to $22 from $19, the shares are now within 10% of this valuation, which embeds our above-consensus EPS estimates for 2017-18 and reflects our expectations for incremental cost reductions and improving asset growth. 2) Further, we believe that additional upside to our EPS estimates will be increasingly driven by macro-factors rather than company-specific drivers, an outlook that may now be more fully discounted in the stock’s valuation (see here). 3) The shares’ current valuation is also in line with its historical level relative to the peer group.\nShares of Bank of America have fallen 0.6% to $19.97 at 11:16, while JPMorgan Chase has fallen 1.6% to $78.25, Wells Fargo, which was also downgraded at Guggenheim, has tumbled 2.1% to $54.42, and Citigroup is off 0.4% at $54.42. The SPDR S&P Bank ETF ( KBE ) has declined 0.6% to $39.77.",

      "text": "By Ben Levisohn Big bank stocks like JPMorgan Chase ( JPM ), Citigroup ( C ) and Wells Fargo ( WFC ) have had wonderful Novembers thanks to Donald Trump’s election victory –and no bank stock has had a better month than Bank of America ( BAC ). It’s time to take profits, says Guggenheim’s Eric Wasserstrom and Jeff Cantwell , who downgrade it to Neutral from Buy. They explain why:\nGetty Images We are downgrading Bank of America to NEUTRAL, notwithstanding our above-consensus 2017-18E EPS. Our downgrade is motivated by three factors: 1) Although we are increasing our fair value estimate to $22 from $19, the shares are now within 10% of this valuation, which embeds our above-consensus EPS estimates for 2017-18 and reflects our expectations for incremental cost reductions and improving asset growth. 2) Further, we believe that additional upside to our EPS estimates will be increasingly driven by macro-factors rather than company-specific drivers, an outlook that may now be more fully discounted in the stock’s valuation (see here). 3) The shares’ current valuation is also in line with its historical level relative to the peer group.\nShares of Bank of America have fallen 0.6% to $19.97 at 11:16, while JPMorgan Chase has fallen 1.6% to $78.25, Wells Fargo, which was also downgraded at Guggenheim, has tumbled 2.1% to $54.42, and Citigroup is off 0.4% at $54.42. The SPDR S&P Bank ETF ( KBE ) has declined 0.6% to $39.77.",

      "text": "Share \nDespite what Bank of America describes as a “challenging business environment,” SMBs are thriving, thanks in large part to friends and family. \nThe bank released its latest semi-annual report on small businesses Tuesday (Nov. 15) and found just how much these companies rely on friends, family and their communities to thrive. Researchers found that 83 percent of SMBs surveyed report having received some kind of financial, operational or emotional support from a family member. More than half of business owners (53 percent) said at least one family member serves a key role in their business, as an employee, advisor or investor. \nClose friends are also helping U.S. small businesses stay ahead. According to Bank of America , more than a third said “friends and family” provide the most help in running their companies, and 38 percent said they have received some type of assistance, financial or emotional, from friends. \nResearchers described these connections as key players in helping small businesses succeed. While optimism levels are increasing, they remain muted, with 31 percent of small businesses saying they’re optimistic about the national economy. Bank of America also found that expectations for revenue growth have remained the same between spring and fall of this year, though most businesses (52 percent) said they expect to see their revenues increase next year. \n“We know small business owners are inherent self-starters making significant personal sacrifices on behalf of their businesses, but what’s fascinating is this dimension of family, friends and community that they see as core to their success,” reflected Sharon Miller, who serves as Bank of America’s head of small business. “As apprehension about the economy stalls plans for many to grow and hire, small business owners are forging ahead with a foundation of support from loved ones and local networks.” \n“It shows why it’s so important for us at Bank of America to serve and support business owners, their families and local communities,” the executive added.",

      "text": "Source: Thinkstock Wednesday is looking like it could bring a down open for the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Before thinking it is a huge worry, keep in mind that the market is up massively and has risen daily since the election. Just do not forget that some of the gains in big stocks have been 10% to 20% in the last week, and that is not normal and might mean some overbought selling could be expected at any time, for no reason other than profit taking.\n24/7 Wall St. reviews dozens of analyst research reports each morning of the week to find new investing and trading ideas for our readers. Some of these analyst research reports cover stocks to buy, and other calls cover stocks to sell or to avoid.\nInvestors have proven over and over that they are willing and able to buy the sell-offs and dips. Rising bond yields, a Fed wanting to hike rates, high valuations and a huge political upset just do not seem to be in the way. Another point to consider is that this bull market is now closer to eight years old than seven.\nThese are the top analyst upgrades, downgrades and initiations seen on Wednesday morning:\nBank of America Corp. (NYSE: BAC) was downgraded to Neutral from Outperform with a $18 price target (versus a $20.16 prior close) at Robert W. Baird. This is after close to a 20% rally in the past week. The stock has a 52-week trading range of $10.99 to $20.20 and a consensus analyst price target of $18.53.\nI'm interested in the Newsletter Get Newsletter \nterms and conditions   Fitbit Inc. (NYSE: FIT) was raised to Sector Weight from Underperform with an $8 price target (versus a $9.56 close) at Pacific Crest. It has a 52-week range of $8.32 to $34.68 and a consensus price target of $11.44.\nTeva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (NYSE: TEVA) was downgraded to Hold from Buy and the price target was cut to $40 from $69 (versus a $37.60 close) at Jefferies. Morgan Stanley lowered it to Equal Weight from Overweight, and BTIG downgraded it to Neutral from Buy. The 52-week range is $37.25 to $66.55. The consensus analyst target is $63.00.\nWalt Disney Co. (NYSE: DIS) was raised to Buy from Hold with a $112 price target (versus a $97.70 close) at Deutsche Bank. The 52-week range is $86.25 to $120.65, and the consensus price target was last seen at $106.71.\nRegions Financial Corp. (NYSE: RF) was downgraded to Neutral from Overweight at Piper Jaffray, but this is after close to a 20% rally in just the past week. The 52-week range is $7.00 to $13.54, and the shares have a consensus price target of $11.47.\nFollow @Jonogg on Twitter to receive the daily analyst calls and research updates directly on your Twitter feed. \nOther key analyst upgrades and downgrades were seen in the following:",

Top-ranked analyst David George of Baird downgraded a group of bank stocks on Wednesday, advising clients to take profits and wait for a pullback following the sector rally on Donald Trump's presidential victory. \n\n\"We think the bank rally post-election has largely discounted potential benefits from rising interest rates, lower tax rates, and more aggressive capital return,\" George wrote in a note. \"We believe investors should book gains and wait for more evidence that the structural improvement in macro trends and regulations will materialize. \nIn his report, the analyst downgraded Bank of America and Capital One Financial to neutral from overweight, while Fifth Third Bank Bancorp was downgraded to underperform from neutral.",

      "text": "print \nBy Dan Freed \nNEW YORK, Nov 15 (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp is on track to report better fourth-quarter trading revenue because of higher volumes around the U.S. presidential election, Chief Operating Officer Tom Montag said on Tuesday. \n\"Quarter-to-date has continued to be pretty good relative to last year,\" Montag said at an industry conference in New York. \"Not as robust as the third quarter was but still double-digit improvement ... year-over-year.\" \nBank of America's client trading volumes on both the New York Stock Exchange and in Japan were higher than ever due to the election, he added. \nMontag also said he hopes the election of Donald Trump will allow the bank to save money complying with post-crisis regulations such as the Volcker Rule, which is intended to prevent banks from making big directional bets on the market. \nTrump and certain influential members of Congress have indicated they will dismantle or change Dodd-Frank, the sweeping reform law passed in 2010. Montag is being \"a little more cautious\" about spending money on regulatory compliance until there is clarity on what will be done, he said. \n\"There is a chance they change something in Volcker, maybe they change it appreciably,\" Montag said.

      "text": "print \nBy Pamela Barbaglia \nLONDON, Nov 15 (Reuters) - Societe Generale has poached Bank of America's head of global corporate banking for Italy, Alessandro Gumier, to lead its Italian business, four sources familiar with the matter said. \nGumier, who joined the Wall Street lender over a decade ago, will take over from Societe Generale's group country head Patrizia Micucci, who stepped down in July. \nOfficials at Societe Generale and Bank of America declined to comment. \nGumier's appointment comes after Bank of America's Chief Executive for Italy, Marco Morelli, left the bank in September to lead the restructuring of Monte dei Paschi di Siena as its new CEO. \nA series of senior dealmakers have left international banks active in Italy recently, including at Japan's Nomura and Britain's Barclays. \nThat's despite Italy being home to some of the biggest fee payers in Europe. Ailing lender Monte dei Paschi paid banks more than 400 million euros ($429 million) for two capital increases in as many years and is now working on an expensive rescue plan. \nMilan-based Gumier has over 15 years of experience in banking, having previously worked at Citigroup and Standard Chartered. \nHe will leave Bank of America this week, handing over to Mario Ambrosio, a managing director at Bank of America's Italian corporate banking business, who has been promoted to head the division. \nAmbrosio will report to Fernando Vicario, head of corporate banking across Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA).

It’s time to take profits, says Guggenheim’s Eric Wasserstrom and Jeff Cantwell , who downgrade it to Neutral from Buy. They explain why:\nGetty Images We are downgrading Bank of America to NEUTRAL, notwithstanding our above-consensus 2017-18E EPS. Our downgrade is motivated by three factors: 1) Although we are increasing our fair value estimate to $22 from $19, the shares are now within 10% of this valuation, which embeds our above-consensus EPS estimates for 2017-18 and reflects our expectations for incremental cost reductions and improving asset growth. 2) Further, we believe that additional upside to our EPS estimates will be increasingly driven by macro-factors rather than company-specific drivers, an outlook that may now be more fully discounted in the stock’s valuation (see here). 3) The shares’ current valuation is also in line with its historical level relative to the peer group.\nShares of Bank of America have fallen 0.6% to $19.97 at 11:16, while JPMorgan Chase has fallen 1.6% to $78.25, Wells Fargo, which was also downgraded at Guggenheim, has tumbled 2.1% to $54.42, and Citigroup is off 0.4% at $54.42. The SPDR S&P Bank ETF ( KBE ) has declined 0.6% to $39.77.",

      "text": "One month ago, we cautioned readers that according to recent fund flow data, Bank of America was convinced that the \"*next shoe to drop\" *would be so-called \"low-vol\" stocks, ETFs and related strategies, which due to their debt-like characteristics and steady dividend payouts, had emerged as one of the preferred hangouts during the period of turbulent in the early part of the year.\n\nAs BofA Savita Subramanian explained, low volatility strategies had seen a parabolic increase in inflows since late 2014 as investors chased the perceived safety of these strategies. These inflows helped push valuations in Staples and Utilities to elevated levels. \n\nHowever, the stratgist warned , investor sentiment appears to be shifting from a deflation / low growth theme, which benefited defensives and yield plays in 1H16, to an inflation theme, with interest rates rising, inflation expectations picking up and fiscal stimulus beneficiaries attracting investor interest. As such, Utilities and Staples, which have been two preferred sectors for low vol strategies, were two of the worst performing sectors (along with Telecom) in Q3.\n\nIn August, Low Vol funds experienced their first outflow since September of 2014 and appear vulnerable to more outflows if their perceived safety deteriorates as investors shift their focus away from ZIRP (zero interest rate policy) beneficiaries.\n\nAs a result of these shifts, BofA concluded, “low vol” has become more risky: the realized volatility of low beta stocks has seen a steady increase over the past several years as shown in the chart below, suggesting low vol is becoming high vol.\n\nIronically, \"low vol\" was becoming \"very high vol.\"\n\nAnd then, after last week's victory by Donald Trump which unleashed the great Trumpflation rally, the not so low vol went off the charts, and the shoe officially dropped, and as Bloomberg pointed out earlier today, the \"Low Vol\" iShares Edge MSCI Min Vol EAFE ETF saw a record one-day outflow of more than $300 million on Wednesday.\n\nThe first warning was June's Brexit vote: \"Brexit killed low-volatility — that was the catalyst. People just breathed a sigh of relief after that point,\" said Eric Balchunas, ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. However, thanks to the market's brisk rebound after Brexit courtesy of central bank backstops, the scare was not enough, and investors continued to flock inside into the \"safety\" of low vol ETFs, boosted by the funds' better performance than the overall market in the first half of 2016.\n\nHowever, as Bank of America noted last month, the low vol outperformance ended some time around mid-July, at which point the group started to underperform the S&P.\n\nAs Brean Capital's Head of Macro Strategy Peter Tchir put it after the fact, \"something got lost in translation. People, I think, started viewing it as 'all the upside of equities with limited downside' — they got the opposite — time to sell. This product attracted extremely risk averse investors — when risk popped up here 'unexpectedly' (I think completely predictably) the holders now sell as they didn't want risk in the first place.\"\n\nSo is it safe to write out \"low vol\" as a strategy? As long as the Trumpflation-inspired selloff in bonds continues and yields - together with the dollar - keep soaring, the answer for both dividend and \"low vol\" strategies is a resounding yes. However, once financial conditions as a result of the unprecedented chase of coming inflation (which as we explained earlier may not come at all, and will likely only arrive some time in 2018) become so tight that not even the quant community can keep chasing momentum with incremental leverage, all the money that is currently flooding out of the abovementioned products will rush right back in, and the cycle can begin from scratch.",

      "text": "Bank Of America's 2017 Largely Depends On Trump And The Fed Nov.17.16 Summary \nWhile this year started a bit rocky, Bank of America has had a solid 5 year performance. \nThe largely republican shift in our government could represent a staunch shift from the more heavily regulated policies of the past 8 years. \nCombined with the Fed's recent acknowledgment of coming rate hikes, Bank of America's 2017 profits are an appealing play. \nThings are looking up \nThe beginning of the year wasn't exactly what the doctor ordered for Bank of America (NYSE: BAC ). An opening quarter of declining earnings (yoy) is still an eye sore for shareholders. Thankfully, things are looking up. Q2 beat estimates, and Q3 created a trend. Not only did the bank beat expectations of a decline, they also outperformed the year prior. More encouraging is the return to revenue growth. The third quarter finally brought us increasing revenues; a welcome sight to shareholders. \nWith interest rates that have been less than kind to financials over the past few years, Bank of America has kept a \"big picture\" appeal to investors. Interest income was shattered from 2011 onward , yet the bank managed to take earnings per share from a measly $0.01 in 2011 to $1.31 in 2015! Now with a republican congress and the man with a plan (well, we hope he has a plan) in as president elect, Bank of America could be primed for another step in the right direction. The big question is will congress work to create a less regulated banking environment? \nThe future has some promise \nThe banks future largely depends on which Donald Trump shows up. If it's the Donald that has criticized Janet Yellen , we \"might\" get higher rates. It's tough to tell considering the plethora of rhetoric he's given us in past months. My take away from all of Trump's statements on rates is that we should raise them the moment we see a lot of inflation developing. We've seen some higher inflation as of late. Perhaps we'll finally see a 1% rise. \nWhether you love it or hate it, lower financial regulations and higher rates could indeed open up avenues for higher gains for the banks. Assuming they don't free things up to the point that we end up in another 2008 scenario, shareholders are in a good spot right now. \nToday, Janet Yellen prompted my interest with a clearer rhetoric that interest rates will receive a bump sooner rather than later. I suspect this stance corresponds with Trump's election as it will become almost essential to raise rates should Trump's big spending ideas take shape. Regardless of the why, this is good news for banks like Bank of America. A rise in net interest incomes creates a big incentive to own this stock as revenues would surely receive a bump. The dividend is not attractive, but the Price to earnings is very competitive within the banking industry. Considering the stock growth through the last few years, it'll be interesting to see if higher rates can provide the fuel to keep this stock in the $20's.

      "text": "Clive Mason/Getty \nA \"violent rotation\" is taking place in the market, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch. \nSince the election of Donald Trump, investors have pulled money out of bond funds and moved into equity funds at an unprecedented rate. \nIf Trump's fiscal spending plans actualize, investors expect that they would lift domestic growth and inflation. The former could be good for stocks, while the latter would erode the expected returns on bonds. \n\"If Brexit marked 5,000 year low in global interest rates, Trump marked [the] moment investors started to position for [a] bond bear market,\" said Michael Hartnett in the note. The UK voted to leave the European Union in June sent investors scrambling for the safety of bonds, sending yields lower. \nFundstrat's Tom Lee said in a note on Friday that equity Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) witnessed the some of the largest inflows in more than two years during the past two weeks. Also, outflows from bond ETFs last week ranked near the biggest ever.  \n\"Inflows into equity ETFs over the past two weeks are the largest since 2009 (~$50b) — investors have liquidated more than $2T of equities in the past decade and if such inflows are sustained, it would represent a significant tailwind for stocks,\" Lee said.  Clive Mason/Getty Hartnett said there was a record weekly inflow into financial-sector funds. Bank stocks have soared since Trump won  on bets that interest rates could rise, tax rates could fall, and some or all of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law could be weakened or repealed.  Clive Mason/Getty \nThe idea of a \"great rotation\" of funds from bonds to stocks has been touted in markets many times over the years, only for the bull market in bonds to rage on.\nBut in a note on Friday, Sean Darby, the chief global equity strategist at Jefferies, said — without using the phrase — that the great rotation is here. \n\"Last week’s fund flow data may go down in history as the first real indication of the switch from bonds to equities,\" Darby said. \nMeanwhile, emerging-market assets have suffered big outflows. Investors pulled more money out of emerging-market equities on net that they have in 14 months. Emerging-market debt funds had the biggest weekly outflow ever.  Clive Mason/Getty \nBond markets and currencies in Mexico, Brazil, Russia, and other countries sold off along with US Treasurys in the wake of the election.\nFixed-income flows tell the same story. Emerging-market debt ranked first last week in outflows as a percentage of assets under management.

      "text": "Flickr/Alan Levine \nA \"violent rotation\" is taking place in the market, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch. \nSince the election of Donald Trump, investors have pulled money out of bond funds and moved into equity funds at an unprecedented rate. \nIf Trump's fiscal spending plans actualize, investors expect that they would lift domestic growth and inflation. The former could be good for stocks, while the latter would erode the expected returns on bonds. \n\"If Brexit marked 5,000 year low in global interest rates, Trump marked [the] moment investors started to position for [a] bond bear market,\" said Michael Hartnett in the note. The UK voted to leave the European Union in June sent investors scrambling for the safety of bonds, sending yields lower. \nFundstrat's Tom Lee said in a note on Friday that equity Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) witnessed the some of the largest inflows in more than two years during the past two weeks. Also, outflows from bond ETFs last week ranked near the biggest ever.  \n\"Inflows into equity ETFs over the past two weeks are the largest since 2009 (~$50b) — investors have liquidated more than $2T of equities in the past decade and if such inflows are sustained, it would represent a significant tailwind for stocks,\" Lee said.  Flickr/Alan Levine Hartnett said there was a record weekly inflow into financial-sector funds. Bank stocks have soared since Trump won  on bets that interest rates could rise, tax rates could fall, and some or all of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law could be weakened or repealed.  Flickr/Alan Levine \nThe idea of a \"great rotation\" of funds from bonds to stocks has been touted in markets many times over the years, only for the bull market in bonds to rage on.\nBut in a note on Friday, Sean Darby, the chief global equity strategist at Jefferies, said — without using the phrase — that the great rotation is here. \n\"Last week’s fund flow data may go down in history as the first real indication of the switch from bonds to equities,\" Darby said. \nMeanwhile, emerging-market assets have suffered big outflows. Investors pulled more money out of emerging-market equities on net that they have in 14 months. Emerging-market debt funds had the biggest weekly outflow ever.  Flickr/Alan Levine \nBond markets and currencies in Mexico, Brazil, Russia, and other countries sold off along with US Treasurys in the wake of the election.\nFixed-income flows tell the same story. Emerging-market debt ranked first last week in outflows as a percentage of assets under management.

(Photo: Courtesy of Bank of America) 1 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nBank of America has selected Communities in Schools of Delaware, a nonprofit targeting schools in challenged neighborhoods, as its 2016 Neighborhood Builder. \nThe bank will provide Communities in Schools of Delaware with a combination of leadership development, $2000,000 in flexible funding, a network of peer organizations across the United States and the opportunity to enhance their funding opportunities to expand their impact. \nFor more than 20 years, Communities in Schools of Delaware has delivered its model of integrated support to children who face challenges both inside and outside the classroom. Communities in Schools of Delaware delivers critical community resources so that students can focus on learning, stay in school and graduate on time. The nonprofit targets schools in communities facing poverty, where more than 80 percent of the children are on free and reduced lunch. \n\"The Neighborhood Builders grant will help them serve thousands more students who are at-risk of dropping out of school with increased funding for holistic programs that connect these students and their families to critical services like housing assistance, food and nutrition access, education, financial education, healthcare, mentors and much more,\" said Chip Rossi, Delaware market president for Bank of America. \nCarlton Lampkins, chairman of the board for Communities in Schools of Delaware, said the partnership with Bank of America will help those in need. \n\"We work closely with schools, social services, businesses and thousands of volunteers to get young people the things they need to learn and grow: mentors and tutors, after-school help, and family service to stabilize the home. Without these basic supports, kids in need or high-risk are far less likely to succeed and grow into productive adults.\" \nSince 2004, through Neighborhood Builders, Bank of America has helped nonprofits impact the communities they serve. Through the program, Bank of America has invested more than $180 million in 900 nonprofit organizations throughout the country. \nContact Jeff Mordock at (302) 324-2786, on Twitter @JeffMordockTNJ or . 1 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://delonline.us/2g54IKU TOP VIDEOS",

      "text": "Summary \nAnalysts can find another 20% EPS in BAC with conservative adjustments to assumptions. \nBAC has been about cost reduction, but a bigger top line is worth more for EPS. \nToday the business has an improved outlook and investors enjoy a margin of safety. I've had a few questions along the lines of \"ok, we'll see some more growth and inflation with Trump, but isn't this big move from the banks over the top?\" The question is very reasonable. For a sector that has at times been treated with near revulsion by investors this year to suddenly pop raises eyebrows. As it happens though the answer is \"no, the reaction is probably not over the top\". This is mainly because, given the starting point, it won't take much to lift banks' EPS by 20%. With Bank of America (NYSE: BAC ) in focus I thought this is a good time to look at a few sensitivities for its bottom line. Everyone knows about Bank of America. The company is geared to higher rates but probably not as much as other banks we could find. I've thought the mid-term alpha from this stock would come from its improving operating leverage. That is, should the targets be delivered by 2018, it seemed unlikely BAC's cheapness over that forecast horizon would last, so it should outperform as its PE catches up with peers. After such an impressive run, it's a good idea to check out the numbers. One of the key elements of good long term investing is getting entry and exit levels broadly right and not to do much else with a position the rest of the time other than checking the investment case remains valid. How much is left for BAC and what should we assume as a new base case? Here is what I was looking for back on results day. On this outlook, BAC executes it cost reduction program pretty well, falling a little short of the $53bn target but well on the way there. Interest earning assets grow 4% annually, while net interest margin drops 10 bps to 2.1% for 2017 and is constant through 2018. Non interest income grows 3% in each of 2017 and 2018 and Loan loss provisions remain pretty flat. This is very much a low rates scenario with gentle pressure on NIM and constant benign credit costs, leaving the main drivers as modest asset and revenue growth and falling operating costs. This quiet outlook was worth a 19% lift in pre-provision profit and 21% on pre-tax by 2018. So is the market assuming a steroid injection from the Trump victory? Not really. What you can see in the short hand model above is that BAC doesn't need heroic assumptions to markedly improve its profit delivery. This is because every 1% improvement in income over flat cost is worth a 3% improvement at the pre-tax line. The same upside gearing works if we allow some more growth post Trump. In the above model, we used 4% growth in earning assets. Let's lift that to 6% in 2017-18 and raise NIM by 5bps in 2017 and by 10bps in 2018. For reference, the resulting NIM would be below what BAC achieved in 2011. Non interest income should grow a little faster too, given more economic activity in a growthier Trump world, so 3% growth goes out to 4 then 5%. More business activity will lift costs so that $53bn won't be achievable in the medium term, so we're looking at $55bn in 2018, while loan loss provision should also go up due to higher lending, though there is no reason to think in a buoyant growth environment that credit quality will deteriorate quickly (that will be a key sensitivity later in the cycle). While you might quibble with any of these changes, we are not starting from an expensive valuation so the stock isn't that vulnerable if you moderate the assumptions somewhat. Either way, here is what you get after these adjustments: If we put a 12x multiple on BAC for 2018, there's 35% upside before consideration of capital distribution, or a price target of $27 per share. Click to enlarge Conclusion BAC remains very attractive . On the numbers we've played with here, the stock has got a little less cheap in the past weeks moving from 8.2x EPS back on results day to 8.9x in 2018, but: so what? There's a lot left in BAC.
