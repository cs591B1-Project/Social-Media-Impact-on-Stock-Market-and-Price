      "text": "Twitter is a real-time stream of news and opinion that is often the fastest way to see what people are talking about. But, it's also a platform that has become deeply ingrained with abuse and hate speech , which has in turn forced people off the platform altogether . \nThe company has long recognized this, but has been slow to figure out a way to address the problem. Twitter says as much in a newly published blog post on the abuse problem: \"The amount of abuse, bullying, and harassment we've seen across the Internet has risen sharply over the past few years. These behaviors inhibit people from participating on Twitter, or anywhere.\"\nAs part of a longer-term solution, Twitter is expanding its mute function, which until now, has been used for muting single Twitter users from your stream (which isn't that helpful if you're being harassed by multiple users, or by people who create new accounts every time they're muted or suspended). The company says the new feature works like this: \n\"Twitter has long had a feature called \"mute\" which enables you to mute accounts you don't want to see Tweets from. Now we're expanding mute to where people need it the most: in notifications. We're enabling you to mute keywords, phrases, and even entire conversations you don't want to see notifications about, rolling out to everyone in the coming days.\"\nThe company also says it's retrained internal support teams, which are responsible for enforcing Twitter's code of conduct and investigating reports of violations, but admits, \"We don't expect these announcements to suddenly remove abusive conduct from Twitter.\" \nYou can read the full announcement here .",

      "text": "Published November 15, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print NEW YORK -- Dave Roberts of the Los Angeles Dodgers has won the National League Manager of the Year award and Terry Francona of the Cleveland Indians has earned the AL honor.\nRoberts won in his first year as a manager. A former backup outfielder, his highlight as a player was a key stolen base in the 2004 playoffs for a Boston team guided by Francona.\nMembers of the Baseball Writers' Association of America voted at the end of the regular season. The awards were announced Tuesday on MLB Network.\nMore from FoxSports Fall League profile: Jared Miller D-backs uniform watch: The bloody pant leg is no more D-backs gather to aid military veterans Craig Counsell contract extension press conference Roberts beat out Joe Maddon, who led the Chicago Cubs to the World Series championship, and Washington's Dusty Baker.\nRoberts led Los Angeles to the NL West title despite the Dodgers putting 28 different players on the disabled list, more than any team in the last 30 years.\nFrancona guided a club beset by injuries and drug suspensions to a surprising first-place finish. The Indians had a 3-1 lead in the World Series before the Cubs rallied.\nTexas' Jeff Banister was second and Baltimore's Buck Showalter was third.",

Save Chris Pizzello/Invision/AP \nWe're just a few weeks out from Rogue One , the first in what will probably be a never-ending string of \"stand-alone\" Star Wars films. After last year's successful revival of the franchise, fans are chomping at the bit for more on Rogue One, and they'll get it this Friday. Twitter will be hosting a live Q&A and broadcast some unseen footage from the upcoming film. \nIt's just the latest example of Twitter's interest in live video -- the company has already started hosting live NBA shows and it also broadcast all three presidential debates as they happened, just to name a few of its recent initiatives. Friday's livestream will feature a Q&A session with director Gareth Edwards, producer Kathleen Kennedy and cast members Felicity Jones, Diego Luna, Ben Mendelsohn, Donnie Yen, Mads Mikkelsen, Alan Tudykand and Riz Ahmed. Naturally, you'll need to tweet your questions using the hashtag #AskRogueOne. It's coming.A Q&A with the cast of @starwars #RogueOne streaming LIVE on Twitter this Friday at 1pm ET. pic.twitter.com/Cp1O7zyemu — Twitter (@twitter) November 29, 2016 \nThe stream will kick off at 10AM PT with new, unspecified \"content\" from Rogue One before the Q&A gets underway; Twitter says the livestream will take place at a \"surprise location\" -- perhaps the set of Episode VIII? If you've fled Twitter for greener pastures but still want to follow along, fear not: Twitter specifically says that the stream will be available for anyone checking it out at rogueone.twitter.com. But if you want to ask a question, you'll need to have account.",

      "text": "Twitter is teaming up with Disney to livestream an exclusive Star Wars: Rogue One event showcasing unreleased footage and a Q&A panel with the film's director and cast.\nThe event, hosted by People magazine from a \"surprise location,\" takes place on Friday Dec. 2 at 1 p.m. Eastern, according to Variety . Video will be streamed from a newly created Twitter URL and will also be available in Twitter Moments, People and Star Wars ' Twitter accounts, and the Twitter app on Apple TV, Amazon Fire TV and Xbox Live. A curated selection of live tweets from various publications and other relevant accounts will be visible alongside the video stream.\nWe'll see everyone Friday! #RogueOne The Force is with us @people and @starwars. https://t.co/yJ4uolJJJD\nDirector Gareth Edwards will offer a behind-the-scenes look at the making of Rogue One along with key cast members — Felicity Jones, Diego Luna, Ben Mendelsohn, Donnie Yen, Mads Mikkelsen, Alan Tudyk and Riz Ahmed, to name a few — and Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy.\nSource: Disney/YouTube Variety says fans can submit questions during the event using the hashtag #AskRogueOne, which in turn will be relayed to the cast by moderator JD Heyman, People 's deputy entertainment editor. Interested parties without a Twitter account will still be able to access the stream without a log in.\nThis isn't Twitter's first foray into broadcasting: The social network owns Periscope — a livestreaming app streamlined onto Twitter's platform — and struck a deal with the NFL to broadcast ten Thursday Night Football games throughout the 2016 season.\nStar Wars: Rogue One , also known as Rogue One: A Star Wars Story , arrives in theaters Dec. 16.",

[NK US] According to a report in REDCODE on Thursday, Keith Coleman, CEO of Yes, and its other six employees are all joining Twitter in product and design roles as part of the deal. \"Coleman will take over the day-to-day leadership of 'Bluebird', the core Twitter app and service,\" the report said. Coleman will run Twitter's core product and it is believed to be a challenging job, as the company has been struggling in this area for last two years to grow its user base. Twitter's new Vice-President of product role has been vacant for past six months and with Coleman's entry, Twitter will look forward to strenghthen its weak spot. qd/ahm/",

      "text": "The most-tweeted GIF on Twitter will make Ryan Reynolds smile We love Twitter and we love lists and we love Ryan Reynolds. These things tickle our various fancies (specifically: social media, organization, every other fancy) and so we were really excited when we read the list of the top most-tweeted GIFs on Twitter , because it combines ALL OF THESE THINGS.\nIf you follow Ryan on Twitter at all , you know that he’s hilarious. Dude could seriously have a second career as a comedian . We’d go see his standup (and it has nothing to do with his face or his abs SHUT UP don’t question our motives, they’re pure), that’s for sure. But this might be his crowning achievement…\nRyan Reynolds NAILED the #1 most tweeted GIF of 2016 spot with this hilarious GIF of his wife, Blake Lively. Actual footage from the first date with my wife. Tried to surprise her and totally forgot I was a fucking shark. pic.twitter.com/7AxuauYH2e \n— Ryan Reynolds (@VancityReynolds) June 24, 2016 We hope that Ryan gives an acceptance speech, or something, and that somebody’s preparing him a trophy, because he deserves the trophy almost as much as we deserve the acceptance speech.\nThe second most tweeted GIF makes perfect sense — it hits the recent Pokémon Go release, alongside our generations nostalgia for times past, and turns it into an am zing animation we can’t stop watching. 20年の旅。20周年おめでとうございます！ #Pokemon20 #ポケモン20周年 pic.twitter.com/fhCpBEvZGQ \n— memi (@_gamemix_) March 2, 2016 And last but CERTAINLY not least, the third most-tweeted GIF on Twitter is poop ice cream. Yeah, that’s what we said. Did we stutter? Why is a 99 ice cream £1.25 whys it still called a 99 the world doesn't make any sense anymore pic.twitter.com/dMbVz9IYow \n— Liam (@LiamPayne) March 9, 2016 We hope that you enjoyed this list as much as we enjoyed making it, and retweeted at least the first one, just to make Ryan Reynolds smile, because OBVIOUSLY.\nThe post The most-tweeted GIF on Twitter will make Ryan Reynolds smile appeared first on HelloGiggles .",
