Michael “Jim” Delligatti was 98. \nMcDonald’s spokeswoman Kerry Ford confirmed that Delligatti died at home surrounded by his family on Monday night. \nDelligatti’s franchise was based in Uniontown, about 40 miles south of Pittsburgh, when he invented the chain’s signature burger with two all-beef patties, “special sauce,” lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions on a sesame seed bun. \nDelligatti told The Associated Press in 2006 that Oak Brook, Illinois-based McDonald’s resisted the idea at first because its simple lineup of hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries and shakes were selling well. \nBut Delligatti wanted to offer a bigger burger and it went over so well it spread to the rest of Delligatti’s 47 stores, then went national in 1968. \n(© Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

      "text": "Pittsburgh-area McDonald's franchisee who created Big Mac dies  06 AM Post-Gazette In this 1993 photo, Jim Delligatti, a McDonald's franchisee from Piittsburgh, is pictured with his invention -- the Big Mac, a double-decker sandwich with a \"secret\" special sauce. David Marsden/Getty Images The Big Mac -- two all-beef patties, “special sauce,” lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions on a sesame seed bun. Bob Donaldson/Post-Gazette Michael Delligatti, son of Big Mac inventor Jim Delligatti, in the Big Mac Museum Restaurant in North Huntingdon in 2007. Associated Press \nThe Pittsburgh-area McDonald’s franchisee who created the Big Mac nearly 50 years ago has died. Michael ‘Jim’ Delligatti was 98. \nMcDonald’s spokeswoman Kerry Ford confirmed that Mr. Delligatti died at his Fox Chapel home surrounded by his family on Monday night. \nMr. Delligatti’s franchise was based in Uniontown, Fayette County, when he invented the chain’s signature burger with two all-beef patties, “special sauce,” lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions on a sesame seed bun. \nHe was 49 when he concocted the Big Mac, spending a few weeks developing the special sauce. He said McDonald's headquarters was \"very cautious\" initially before giving him the go-ahead. Corporate officials told him he could only use ingredients in the store -- a single-sliced bun, instead of the double-sliced one he wanted. \n\"I tried to make the sandwich without the middle slice. But it was too messy,'' with the special sauce soaking through, he told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. \nSo Mr. Delligatti went out and bought a double-sliced bun for his double-decker hamburger and sold it for 45 cents in 1967 in his McDonald's in Uniontown. \nIt sold so well in Western Pennsylvania — Mr. Delligatti sold it in the rest of his 47 stores — that McDonald's unveiled the Big Mac nationally in 1968 in silver and blue wrapping, and dubbed it the Big Attraction. Mr. Delligatti had no idea it would sell 550 million a year in the United States today or be sold in 100 countries. \nContrary to popular belief, he didn't get a percentage of Big Mac sales or a big raise from his invention. \"Everybody thinks I did. But no way. All I got was a plaque.\" \nMr. Delligatti, with the financial help of the McDonald’s Corp., opened the McDonald's Big Mac Museum Restaurant in North Huntingdon, Westmoreland County, in August 2007. Visitors can be photographed in front of the world's largest Big Mac (14 feet by 12 feet). \nThe Post-Gazette contributed.",

      "text": "Who We Are Former McDonald’s CEO to $15 Wage Strikers Replaced by Automation : ‘Told You So’ “The push for a $15 starter wage has negatively impacted the career prospects of employees who were just getting started in the workforce while extinguishing the businesses that employed them.” 11.29.2016 Trey Sanchez \nFormer president and CEO of McDonald’s USA Ed Rensi has “a simple message” for the union-backed Fight for $15 wage “protest organizers and the reporters covering them: I told you so.” \n“It brings me no joy to write these words,” Rensi continues in an op-ed for Forbes . “The push for a $15 starter wage has negatively impacted the career prospects of employees who were just getting started in the workforce while extinguishing the businesses that employed them. I wish it were not so. But it’s important to document these consequences, lest policymakers elsewhere decide that the $15 movement is worth embracing.” \nThose consequences include a recent nationwide rollout of self-service kiosks which replaces cashiers with automated touchscreens that take customers’ orders. \n“It’s not just McDonald’s that has embraced job-replacing technology,” Rensi states. “Numerous restaurant chains (both quick service and full service) have looked to computer tablets as a solution for rising labor costs that won’t adversely impact the customer’s experience.” \nWhen the Fight for $15 was just getting its feet wet in 2013, Rensi said he issued a series of dire warnings to aggressive unions that workers will be replaced with machines if they continued to fight for a high minimum wage. \n“At the time, labor groups accused business owners of crying wolf,” he said. “It turns out the wolf was real.” \nThere is another consequence that affects smaller businesses that can’t afford high-priced gadgets in their stores. Again, Rensi warned, as did others, that this would lead to layoffs and business closures. That scenario hasn’t played out much worse than it has in California: \nThey include a bookstore in Roseville, a pub in Fresno, restaurants and bakeries in San Francisco, a coffee shop in Berkeley, grocery stores in Oakland, a grill in Santa Clara, and apparel manufacturers through the state. In September of this year, nearly one-quarter of restaurant closures in the Bay Area cited labor costs as one of the reasons for shutting down operations. And just this past week, a California-based communications firm announced it was moving 75 call center jobs from San Diego to El Paso, citing the state’s rising minimum as the “deciding factor.” \nBut businesses in Washington, Colorado, Maine and Arizona are feeling the pinch after each stated voted for a $15 wage increase on Election Day: \nIn the immediate aftermath, family-owned restaurants, coffee shops and even childcare providers have struggled to absorb the coming cost increase—with parents paying the cost through steeper childcare bills, and employees paying the cost through reduced shift hours or none at all. \nWho deserves the most blame, according to Rensi, is the labor unions who sat back and basked in the extra media coverage and fundraising dollars while ignoring the voices of everyone telling them a wage hike like this is unsustainable: \nThe out-of-state labor groups who funded these initiatives aren’t shedding tears over the consequences. Like their Soviet-era predecessors who foolishly thought they could centrally manage prices and business operations to fit an idealistic worldview, economic reality keeps ruining the model of all gain and no pain. This brings me to my last correct prediction, which is that the Fight for $15 was always more a creation of the left-wing Service Employees International Union (SEIU) rather than a legitimate grassroots effort. Reuters reported last year that, based on federal filings, the SEIU had spent anywhere from $24 million to $50 million on the its Fight for $15 campaign, and the number has surely increased since then. \nThis money has bought the union a lot of protesters and media coverage. You can expect more of it on November 29. But the real faces of the Fight for $15 are the young people and small business owners who have had their futures compromised. Those faces are not happy ones. Issues",

      "text": "New McDonald's Ad Has An Interesting Message 3 hours ago share Led by Fight For $15, a labor-funded movement that celebrated its fourth anniversary Tuesday, disgruntled workers targeted fast-food restaurants, hospitals and airports for refusing to pay what the protestors believe is a realistic living wage. As in the past, McDonald's was a prime target, with protests taking place in front of several of its locations, and many of its workers walking off the job to participate. Though McDonald’s didn’t address the protests directly, it did present a counterargument on Twitter. Starting last week, the brand began tweeting videos advertising the perks of getting a job at the Golden Arches, especially for people just entering the work force. At the end of each video is the tagline, \"Committed to being America’s best first job.\" September 2016 marks Vinnie Penn's 20th year on Connecticut radio. Penn first hit the WELI airwaves in Fall 1996, only to soon be tapped to co-host Glenn Beck's KC101 morning show in the studio next door the following Spring. By 2001 Penn was a regular on Howard Stern (even making broadcasting history by being on with Stern on 9/11). Vinnie moved to Sirius Satellite Radio in 2005. He created segments for several channels at Sirius, and one of his stand-up comedy shows was a top request on the Raw Dog channel. Originally a music journalist, his own column ran for seven years in the Connecticut Post. In 2000 he had a joke book published, \"The Mother Load\", which went on to become one of the publisher's best sellers, and in 2005 he contributed the short story \"Diary of a Superhero\" to the Contemporary Press anthology \"Danger City\". It has since been optioned to be made into a TV series for Sony. Vinnie's work has appeared in national magazines as diverse as Maxim, MSN, Hit Parader, Parent Cracked and the late, great Circus. He did a season of VH1's popular Best Week Ever, Showbiz Tonight and presently appears on Fox & Friends and Nancy Grace. Vinnie's first non-fiction hardcover, \"Guidos Credos\", landed on shelves in December 2008, with his second book, \"DJ Zom-B & The Ungrateful Dead\" released in2012. Meantime, he returned to CT radio, on 960/WELI with the weekday morning talk show \"The Vinnie Penn Project\" in January 2011. It is now simulcast on NewsRadio 1410 WPOP (Hartford). Contact ",

      "text": "Pennsylvania McDonald's franchisee who created Big Mac dies Associated Press   Big Mac via McDonald's PITTSBURGH (AP) — The Pittsburgh-area McDonald's franchisee who created the Big Mac nearly 50 years ago has died. James Delligatti was 98. McDonald's spokeswoman Kerry Ford confirmed that Delligatti died at home surrounded by his family on Monday night. Delligatti's franchise was based in Uniontown, about 40 miles south of Pittsburgh, when he invented the chain's signature burger with two all-beef patties, \"special sauce,\" lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions on a sesame seed bun. Delligatti told The Associated Press in 2006 that Oak Brook, Illinois-based McDonald's resisted the idea at first, because its simple lineup of hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries and shakes were selling well. But Delligatti wanted to offer a bigger burger and it went over so well it spread to the rest of Delligatti's 47 stores, then went national in 1968.

      "text": "PITTSBURGH — The Pittsburgh-area McDonald’s franchisee who created the Big Mac nearly 50 years ago has died. Michael “Jim” Delligatti was 98.\nMcDonald’s spokeswoman Kerry Ford confirmed that Delligatti died at home surrounded by his family on Monday night.\nDelligatti’s franchise was based in Uniontown when he invented the chain’s signature burger with two all-beef patties, “special sauce,” lettuce, cheese, pickles and onions on a sesame seed bun.\nDelligatti told The Associated Press in 2006 that Oak Brook, Illinois-based McDonald’s resisted the idea at first because its simple lineup of hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries and shakes was selling well.\nBut Delligatti wanted to offer a bigger burger and it went over so well it spread to the rest of Delligatti’s 47 stores, then went national in 1968.\n ",

      "text": "McDonald’s Fires Back at Minimum Wage Protesters by Detailing Its Newest Plans to Replace Them posted by Kayla Brandon - share \nThe “fight for 15” among minimum wage workers has been relentless recently, with protesters hitting the streets Tuesday in 340 U.S. cities. \nOne of the largest groups of minimum wage employees involved in the movement is fast food workers, many of whom work at McDonald's. \nFormer president and CEO of McDonald’s USA, Ed Rensi, responded to demonstrators demanding more money Tuesday by announcing in Forbes how the company will replace workers with “self-serving machines”:   \n\"As the labor union-backed Fight for $15 begins yet another nationwide strike on November 29, I have a simple message for the protest organizers and the reporters covering them: I told you so. \nIt brings me no joy to write these words. The push for a $15 starter wage has negatively impacted the career prospects of employees who were just getting started in the workforce while extinguishing the businesses that employed them. I wish it were not so. But it’s important to document these consequences, lest policymakers elsewhere decide that the $15 movement is worth embracing.\" \nIn recent months, the fast-food giant unveiled its plans to install “self-service kiosks” where customers could place their order essentially on digital cash registers. Some kiosks have already been implemented in more than 500 restaurants in Southern California, Florida, New York City and overseas locations, according to the Los Angeles Times .",

As he told the AP in 2006, McDonald's was at first hesitant to take on the burger — consisting of two beef patties on a sesame-seed bun, with \"special sauce,\" lettuce, cheese, pickles and onions — because their traditional menu items were already selling well.\nDelligatti managed to convince the company, however, and it's become one of the brand's most recognizable items.\nAccording to ABC News , in 2007 Delligatti and his family even opened a museum dedicated to the Big Mac in North Huntington, Pennsylvania. The museum is home to the \"world's biggest Big Mac replica.\"\nBONUS: This gadget converts a stick of butter into a spray can of fatty goodness...just in time for the holidays",

      "text": "Creator of McDonald's flagship sandwich, the Big Mac, dies 11:18 a.m. 11:18 a.m. 0 \nPITTSBURGH (AP) - You probably haven't heard his name, but you likely have devoured his creation: two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, on a sesame seed bun. \nMichael James \"Jim\" Delligatti, the McDonald's franchisee who created the Big Mac nearly 50 years ago, died Monday at home in Pittsburgh surrounded by his family, family spokeswoman Kerry Ford said Wednesday. Delligatti was 98. \nUntil his health trailed off the last couple of years, Delligatti ate at least one 540-calorie Big Mac a week, his son Michael said. \nDelligatti's franchise was based in Uniontown, not far from Pittsburgh, when he invented the chain's signature burger in 1967 after deciding customers wanted a bigger sandwich. \nMichael Delligatti said McDonald's executives told his father he could experiment with a bigger burger but only using products the restaurant already stocked. \n\"He was often asked why he named it the Big Mac, and he said because Big Mc sounded too funny,\" Delligatti said. \nJim Delligatti told The Associated Press in 2006 that McDonald's resisted the idea at first because its simple lineup of hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries and shakes was selling well. \n\"They figured, why go to something else if (the original menu) was working so well?\" Delligatti said then. \"But it went over so well in Uniontown that we were allowed to bring it to two stores in Pittsburgh for a couple of weeks.\" \nDemand exploded as Delligatti's sandwich spread to the rest of his 47 stores in Pennsylvania and was added to the chain's national menu in 1968. \nMcDonald's has sold billions of Big Macs since then, in more than 100 countries. When the burger turned 40, McDonald's estimated it was selling 550 million Big Macs a year, or roughly 17 every second. \n\"Delligatti was a legendary franchisee within McDonald's system who made a lasting impression on our brand,\" the Oak Brook, Illinois-based company said Wednesday in a statement. The Big Mac \"has become an iconic sandwich enjoyed by many around the world.\" \nAnn Dugan, a former assistant dean of the University of Pittsburgh's Katz School of Business and an expert on business franchises, said Jim Delligatti's genius was simple: He listened to customers who wanted a bigger burger. \n\"In franchising, there's always this set playbook and you have to follow it. Jim saw an opportunity to go outside the playbook because he knew the customer,\" Dugan said. \"He persevered and (McDonald's) listened, and the rest is history.\" \nDelligatti headed M&J Management, a four-generation family business and McDonald's franchise organization for more than 60 years. He opened his first McDonald's in Pittsburgh's North Hills suburbs in 1957. In 1979, he co-founded Pittsburgh's Ronald McDonald House, then the seventh such facility in the country, where families can stay when children travel to Pittsburgh for life-saving medical care, and he was involved in several other charities. \nDelligatti also helped introduce breakfast service at McDonald's, developing the hotcakes and sausage meal to feed hungry steelworkers on their way home from overnight shifts in the mills, his family said. \nIn addition to his two sons, Jim Delligatti is survived by his wife, Ellie, five grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren. \nThe Devlin Funeral Home near Pittsburgh is handling visitation Thursday and Friday. Delligatti's funeral will be held Saturday at St. Joseph's Parish in O'Hara Township.",

Delligatti, the Pittsburgh-area McDonald’s franchisee who created the Big Mac in 1967, has died. He was 98. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar, File) Creator of McDonald’s sandwich, the Big Mac, dies at 98 Wed Nov 30th, 2016 9:31am   \nBy JOE MANDAK \nAssociated Press \nPITTSBURGH — You probably haven’t heard his name, but you likely have devoured his creation: two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, on a sesame seed bun. \nMichael James “Jim” Delligatti, the McDonald’s franchisee who created the Big Mac nearly 50 years ago, died Monday at home in Pittsburgh surrounded by his family, family spokeswoman Kerry Ford said Wednesday. Delligatti was 98. \nUntil his health trailed off the last couple of years, Delligatti ate at least one 540-calorie Big Mac a week, his son Michael said. \nDelligatti’s franchise was based in Uniontown, not far from Pittsburgh, when he invented the chain’s signature burger in 1967 after deciding customers wanted a bigger sandwich. \nMichael Delligatti said McDonald’s executives told his father he could experiment with a bigger burger but only using products the restaurant already stocked. \n“He was often asked why he named it the Big Mac, and he said because Big Mc sounded too funny,” Delligatti said. \nJim Delligatti told The Associated Press in 2006 that McDonald’s resisted the idea at first because its simple lineup of hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries and shakes was selling well. \n“They figured, why go to something else if (the original menu) was working so well?” Delligatti said then. “But it went over so well in Uniontown that we were allowed to bring it to two stores in Pittsburgh for a couple of weeks.” \nDemand exploded as Delligatti’s sandwich spread to the rest of his 47 stores in Pennsylvania and was added to the chain’s national menu in 1968. \nMcDonald’s has sold billions of Big Macs since then, in more than 100 countries. When the burger turned 40, McDonald’s estimated it was selling 550 million Big Macs a year, or roughly 17 every second. \n“Delligatti was a legendary franchisee within McDonald’s system who made a lasting impression on our brand,” the Oak Brook, Illinois-based company said Wednesday in a statement. The Big Mac “has become an iconic sandwich enjoyed by many around the world.” \nAnn Dugan, a former assistant dean of the University of Pittsburgh’s Katz School of Business and an expert on business franchises, said Jim Delligatti’s genius was simple: He listened to customers who wanted a bigger burger. \n“In franchising, there’s always this set playbook and you have to follow it. Jim saw an opportunity to go outside the playbook because he knew the customer,” Dugan said. “He persevered and (McDonald’s) listened, and the rest is history.” \nDelligatti headed M&J Management, a four-generation family business and McDonald’s franchise organization for more than 60 years. He opened his first McDonald’s in Pittsburgh’s North Hills suburbs in 1957. In 1979, he co-founded Pittsburgh’s Ronald McDonald House, then the seventh such facility in the country, where families can stay when children travel to Pittsburgh for life-saving medical care, and he was involved in several other charities. \nDelligatti also helped introduce breakfast service at McDonald’s, developing the hotcakes and sausage meal to feed hungry steelworkers on their way home from overnight shifts in the mills, his family said. \nIn addition to his two sons, Jim Delligatti is survived by his wife, Ellie, five grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren. \nThe Devlin Funeral Home near Pittsburgh is handling visitation Thursday and Friday. Delligatti’s funeral will be held Saturday at St. Joseph’s Parish in O’Hara Township. Most Read",

      "text": "\nShutterstock\nA day like any other day in 1967, Michael “Jim” Delligatti was working at one of his many McDonald’s franchises in western Pennsylvania in little berg called Uniontown . Delligatti knew his customers wanted a bigger burger to sate their ever-growing appetites and he started tinkering. Eventually he devised a recipe of two meat patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, onions, and pickles on a sesame bun… and an extra bottom bun in between the patties. Thus spoke Delligatti, and the Big Mac was born . \nDelligatti received a little resistance from Ray Kroc (McDonald’s franchiser and co-founder) at first. But after a year of excellent sales Kroc took the burger national and the rest is history. Delligatti wasn’t done, either. In 1970, he was back to tinkering with new items for his restaurants. This time he wanted something that could satisfy the early birds who weren’t quite ready for their first burger of the day. Delligatti put a fried egg, a piece of ham, and a slice of American cheese on a toasted English muffin. World, meet the Egg McMuffin . By 1972, Delligatti’s delicious breakfast sandwich convinced Kroc to create a full breakfast menu at McDonald’s nationwide — a menu that’s so popular that the massive success of all-day breakfast has basically saved the company. \nToday, Delligatti passed away today — headed to those golden arches in the sky. He was 98 years old. We salute you, inventor of some of the world’s favorite sandwiches. \n( Via USAToday )\n",

      "text": "Nov 30, 2016 11:33 AM Photo: Paul J. Richards/AFP via Getty Images) Photo: Paul J. Richards/AFP via Getty Images) Share Tweet \nMichael “Jim” Delligatti, inventor of the world’s most iconic sandwich, has died at the age of 98, The Washington Post reports . Delligatti was the McDonald’s franchisee who came up with the Big Mac in 1967, a burger that inarguably created massive reverberations in areas beyond culinary— streamlining how fast food was served , advertising jingles , increased serving sizes , economic indexes . \nThe Big Mac began in the kitchen of Delligatti’s McDonald’s restaurant in Uniontown, Pennsylvnia, outside Pittsburgh. Seeking a larger sandwich than its standard hamburger and cheeseburger, Delligatti came up with a recipe that used two beef patties separated by an additional middle bun (called the “club”; the bottom bun is the “heel” and the sesame seed-flecked top is the “crown”). The cheeseburger was dressed with shredded lettuce, pickles, onions, and Thousand Island sauce, and sold for 45 cents. \n“Big Mac” was not the burger’s original name. Delligatti called it “Aristocrat” and “Blue Ribbon Burger,” but an advertising secretary thought “Big Mac” was pithy and catchy enough, and the third name stuck. From the success at one location, the Big Mac began selling at the rest of Delligatti’s McDonald’s franchises in Pennsylvania. A year later in 1968, the Big Mac expanded nationwide, where it’s been part of McDonald’s permanent menu since. \nWhile the Big Mac has achieved iconic status, it has struggled to translate to a new generation of quick-service consumers with considerably more and more varied dining options. Still, it’s estimated 900 million Big Macs are now sold worldwide each year, with regional variations from India’s Maharaja Mac to Japan’s Giga Big Mac . \n ",

      "text": "Creator of McDonald's flagship sandwich, the Big Mac, dies Posted: By JOE MANDAKAssociated Press \nPITTSBURGH (AP) - You probably haven't heard his name, but you likely have devoured his creation: two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, on a sesame seed bun. \nMichael James \"Jim\" Delligatti, the McDonald's franchisee who created the Big Mac nearly 50 years ago, died Monday at home in Pittsburgh surrounded by his family, family spokeswoman Kerry Ford said Wednesday. Delligatti was 98. \nUntil his health trailed off the last couple of years, Delligatti ate at least one 540-calorie Big Mac a week, his son Michael said. \nDelligatti's franchise was based in Uniontown, not far from Pittsburgh, when he invented the chain's signature burger in 1967 after deciding customers wanted a bigger sandwich. \nMichael Delligatti said McDonald's executives told his father he could experiment with a bigger burger but only using products the restaurant already stocked. \n\"He was often asked why he named it the Big Mac, and he said because Big Mc sounded too funny,\" Delligatti said. \nJim Delligatti told The Associated Press in 2006 that McDonald's resisted the idea at first because its simple lineup of hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries and shakes was selling well. \n\"They figured, why go to something else if (the original menu) was working so well?\" Delligatti said then. \"But it went over so well in Uniontown that we were allowed to bring it to two stores in Pittsburgh for a couple of weeks.\" \nDemand exploded as Delligatti's sandwich spread to the rest of his 47 stores in Pennsylvania and was added to the chain's national menu in 1968. \nMcDonald's has sold billions of Big Macs since then, in more than 100 countries. When the burger turned 40, McDonald's estimated it was selling 550 million Big Macs a year, or roughly 17 every second. \n\"Delligatti was a legendary franchisee within McDonald's system who made a lasting impression on our brand,\" the Oak Brook, Illinois-based company said Wednesday in a statement. The Big Mac \"has become an iconic sandwich enjoyed by many around the world.\" \nAnn Dugan, a former assistant dean of the University of Pittsburgh's Katz School of Business and an expert on business franchises, said Jim Delligatti's genius was simple: He listened to customers who wanted a bigger burger. \n\"In franchising, there's always this set playbook and you have to follow it. Jim saw an opportunity to go outside the playbook because he knew the customer,\" Dugan said. \"He persevered and (McDonald's) listened, and the rest is history.\" \nDelligatti headed M&J Management, a four-generation family business and McDonald's franchise organization for more than 60 years. He opened his first McDonald's in Pittsburgh's North Hills suburbs in 1957. In 1979, he co-founded Pittsburgh's Ronald McDonald House, then the seventh such facility in the country, where families can stay when children travel to Pittsburgh for life-saving medical care, and he was involved in several other charities. \nDelligatti also helped introduce breakfast service at McDonald's, developing the hotcakes and sausage meal to feed hungry steelworkers on their way home from overnight shifts in the mills, his family said. \nIn addition to his two sons, Jim Delligatti is survived by his wife, Ellie, five grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren. \nThe Devlin Funeral Home near Pittsburgh is handling visitation Thursday and Friday. Delligatti's funeral will be held Saturday at St. Joseph's Parish in O'Hara Township.  ",

Delligatti was 98. \nUntil his health trailed off the last couple of years, Delligatti ate at least one 540-calorie Big Mac a week, his son Michael said. \nDelligatti's franchise was based in Uniontown, not far from Pittsburgh, when he invented the chain's signature burger in 1967 after deciding customers wanted a bigger sandwich. \nMichael Delligatti said McDonald's executives told his father he could experiment with a bigger burger but only using products the restaurant already stocked. \n\"He was often asked why he named it the Big Mac, and he said because Big Mc sounded too funny,\" Delligatti said. \nJim Delligatti told The Associated Press in 2006 that McDonald's resisted the idea at first because its simple lineup of hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries and shakes was selling well. \n\"They figured, why go to something else if (the original menu) was working so well?\" Delligatti said then. \"But it went over so well in Uniontown that we were allowed to bring it to two stores in Pittsburgh for a couple of weeks.\" \nDemand exploded as Delligatti's sandwich spread to the rest of his 47 stores in Pennsylvania and was added to the chain's national menu in 1968. \nMcDonald's has sold billions of Big Macs since then, in more than 100 countries. When the burger turned 40, McDonald's estimated it was selling 550 million Big Macs a year, or roughly 17 every second. \n\"Delligatti was a legendary franchisee within McDonald's system who made a lasting impression on our brand,\" the Oak Brook, Illinois-based company said Wednesday in a statement. The Big Mac \"has become an iconic sandwich enjoyed by many around the world.\" \nAnn Dugan, a former assistant dean of the University of Pittsburgh's Katz School of Business and an expert on business franchises, said Jim Delligatti's genius was simple: He listened to customers who wanted a bigger burger. \n\"In franchising, there's always this set playbook and you have to follow it. Jim saw an opportunity to go outside the playbook because he knew the customer,\" Dugan said. \"He persevered and (McDonald's) listened, and the rest is history.\" \nDelligatti headed M&J Management, a four-generation family business and McDonald's franchise organization for more than 60 years. He opened his first McDonald's in Pittsburgh's North Hills suburbs in 1957. In 1979, he co-founded Pittsburgh's Ronald McDonald House, then the seventh such facility in the country, where families can stay when children travel to Pittsburgh for life-saving medical care, and he was involved in several other charities. \nDelligatti also helped introduce breakfast service at McDonald's, developing the hotcakes and sausage meal to feed hungry steelworkers on their way home from overnight shifts in the mills, his family said. \nIn addition to his two sons, Jim Delligatti is survived by his wife, Ellie, five grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren. \nThe Devlin Funeral Home near Pittsburgh is handling visitation Thursday and Friday. Delligatti's funeral will be held Saturday at St. Joseph's Parish in O'Hara Township.  ",

Delligatti was 98. \nUntil his health trailed off the last couple of years, Delligatti ate at least one 540-calorie Big Mac a week, his son Michael said. \nDelligatti's franchise was based in Uniontown, not far from Pittsburgh, when he invented the chain's signature burger in 1967 after deciding customers wanted a bigger sandwich. \nMichael Delligatti said McDonald's executives told his father he could experiment with a bigger burger but only using products the restaurant already stocked. \n\"He was often asked why he named it the Big Mac, and he said because Big Mc sounded too funny,\" Delligatti said. \nJim Delligatti told The Associated Press in 2006 that McDonald's resisted the idea at first because its simple lineup of hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries and shakes was selling well. \n\"They figured, why go to something else if (the original menu) was working so well?\" Delligatti said then. \"But it went over so well in Uniontown that we were allowed to bring it to two stores in Pittsburgh for a couple of weeks.\" \nDemand exploded as Delligatti's sandwich spread to the rest of his 47 stores in Pennsylvania and was added to the chain's national menu in 1968. \nMcDonald's has sold billions of Big Macs since then, in more than 100 countries. When the burger turned 40, McDonald's estimated it was selling 550 million Big Macs a year, or roughly 17 every second. \n\"Delligatti was a legendary franchisee within McDonald's system who made a lasting impression on our brand,\" the Oak Brook, Illinois-based company said Wednesday in a statement. The Big Mac \"has become an iconic sandwich enjoyed by many around the world.\" \nAnn Dugan, a former assistant dean of the University of Pittsburgh's Katz School of Business and an expert on business franchises, said Jim Delligatti's genius was simple: He listened to customers who wanted a bigger burger. \n\"In franchising, there's always this set playbook and you have to follow it. Jim saw an opportunity to go outside the playbook because he knew the customer,\" Dugan said. \"He persevered and (McDonald's) listened, and the rest is history.\" \nDelligatti headed M&J Management, a four-generation family business and McDonald's franchise organization for more than 60 years. He opened his first McDonald's in Pittsburgh's North Hills suburbs in 1957.

      "text": "Creator of iconic burger and one of McDonald's first franchisees Michael Delligatti has died By Laurie Fullerton - 30 November 2016 16:47pm Michael Delligatti \nThe Golden Arches took a hit today with the passing of the creator of McDonald's most iconic burger - the Big Mac. \nMichael Delligatti, who was known as \"Jim,\" died Monday night in Pittsburgh at the age of 98, according to a report. \nAs one of McDonald's first franchisees, Delligatti made an indelible impact on American cuisine with the creation of the Big Mac burger in 1967 at his Uniontown, Pennsylvania restaurant. \nBy combining two all-beef patties, lettuce, cheese, pickles, and onions, as well as a \"secret sauce,\" he created a recipe that is still used today for the Big Mac sandwich, which is served in more than 100 countries worldwide. \nDelligatti also played an integral role in the development of McDonald's breakfast menu, by creating the hotcakes and sausage meal to feel steel workers at the end of their overnight shifts, according to an obituary written by his family that was provided by McDonald's. \nHe opened his first McDonald’s restaurant in 1957 and went on to operate 47 additional locations in Pennsylvania. \n\"Jim was a legendary franchisee within McDonald’s system who made a lasting impression on our brand,\" McDonald's said in a statement on Delligatti's death. \"We will remember Jim as an insightful franchisee, a knowledgeable businessman, and an honorable gentleman who left a legacy of four generations of family members running great restaurants in Pennsylvania and North Carolina.\" \nThis article is about: World , McDonald’s , Big Mac , Media , Marketing , Food & Drink , Media , Brand Laurie Fullerton \nLaurie Fullerton is a writer based in Boston, MA with a background in business, sports, community, medical and travel writing.

      "text": "Creator of McDonald's flagship sandwich, the Big Mac, dies By JOE MANDAKAssociated Press \nPITTSBURGH (AP) - You probably haven't heard his name, but you likely have devoured his creation: two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, on a sesame seed bun. \nMichael James \"Jim\" Delligatti, the McDonald's franchisee who created the Big Mac nearly 50 years ago, died Monday at home in Pittsburgh surrounded by his family, family spokeswoman Kerry Ford said Wednesday. Delligatti was 98. \nUntil his health trailed off the last couple of years, Delligatti ate at least one 540-calorie Big Mac a week, his son Michael said. \nDelligatti's franchise was based in Uniontown, not far from Pittsburgh, when he invented the chain's signature burger in 1967 after deciding customers wanted a bigger sandwich. \nMichael Delligatti said McDonald's executives told his father he could experiment with a bigger burger but only using products the restaurant already stocked. \n\"He was often asked why he named it the Big Mac, and he said because Big Mc sounded too funny,\" Delligatti said. \nJim Delligatti told The Associated Press in 2006 that McDonald's resisted the idea at first because its simple lineup of hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries and shakes was selling well. \n\"They figured, why go to something else if (the original menu) was working so well?\" Delligatti said then. \"But it went over so well in Uniontown that we were allowed to bring it to two stores in Pittsburgh for a couple of weeks.\" \nDemand exploded as Delligatti's sandwich spread to the rest of his 47 stores in Pennsylvania and was added to the chain's national menu in 1968. \nMcDonald's has sold billions of Big Macs since then, in more than 100 countries. When the burger turned 40, McDonald's estimated it was selling 550 million Big Macs a year, or roughly 17 every second. \n\"Delligatti was a legendary franchisee within McDonald's system who made a lasting impression on our brand,\" the Oak Brook, Illinois-based company said Wednesday in a statement. The Big Mac \"has become an iconic sandwich enjoyed by many around the world.\" \nAnn Dugan, a former assistant dean of the University of Pittsburgh's Katz School of Business and an expert on business franchises, said Jim Delligatti's genius was simple: He listened to customers who wanted a bigger burger. \n\"In franchising, there's always this set playbook and you have to follow it. Jim saw an opportunity to go outside the playbook because he knew the customer,\" Dugan said. \"He persevered and (McDonald's) listened, and the rest is history.\" \nDelligatti headed M&J Management, a four-generation family business and McDonald's franchise organization for more than 60 years. He opened his first McDonald's in Pittsburgh's North Hills suburbs in 1957. In 1979, he co-founded Pittsburgh's Ronald McDonald House, then the seventh such facility in the country, where families can stay when children travel to Pittsburgh for life-saving medical care, and he was involved in several other charities. \nDelligatti also helped introduce breakfast service at McDonald's, developing the hotcakes and sausage meal to feed hungry steelworkers on their way home from overnight shifts in the mills, his family said. \nIn addition to his two sons, Jim Delligatti is survived by his wife, Ellie, five grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren. \nThe Devlin Funeral Home near Pittsburgh is handling visitation Thursday and Friday. Delligatti's funeral will be held Saturday at St. Joseph's Parish in O'Hara Township.  ",

      "text": "Creator of McDonald's flagship sandwich, the Big Mac, dies Posted: By JOE MANDAKAssociated Press \nPITTSBURGH (AP) - You probably haven't heard his name, but you likely have devoured his creation: two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, on a sesame seed bun. \nMichael James \"Jim\" Delligatti, the McDonald's franchisee who created the Big Mac nearly 50 years ago, died Monday at home in Pittsburgh surrounded by his family, family spokeswoman Kerry Ford said Wednesday. Delligatti was 98. \nUntil his health trailed off the last couple of years, Delligatti ate at least one 540-calorie Big Mac a week, his son Michael said. \nDelligatti's franchise was based in Uniontown, not far from Pittsburgh, when he invented the chain's signature burger in 1967 after deciding customers wanted a bigger sandwich. \nMichael Delligatti said McDonald's executives told his father he could experiment with a bigger burger but only using products the restaurant already stocked. \n\"He was often asked why he named it the Big Mac, and he said because Big Mc sounded too funny,\" Delligatti said. \nJim Delligatti told The Associated Press in 2006 that McDonald's resisted the idea at first because its simple lineup of hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries and shakes was selling well. \n\"They figured, why go to something else if (the original menu) was working so well?\" Delligatti said then. \"But it went over so well in Uniontown that we were allowed to bring it to two stores in Pittsburgh for a couple of weeks.\" \nDemand exploded as Delligatti's sandwich spread to the rest of his 47 stores in Pennsylvania and was added to the chain's national menu in 1968. \nMcDonald's has sold billions of Big Macs since then, in more than 100 countries. When the burger turned 40, McDonald's estimated it was selling 550 million Big Macs a year, or roughly 17 every second. \n\"Delligatti was a legendary franchisee within McDonald's system who made a lasting impression on our brand,\" the Oak Brook, Illinois-based company said Wednesday in a statement. The Big Mac \"has become an iconic sandwich enjoyed by many around the world.\" \nAnn Dugan, a former assistant dean of the University of Pittsburgh's Katz School of Business and an expert on business franchises, said Jim Delligatti's genius was simple: He listened to customers who wanted a bigger burger. \n\"In franchising, there's always this set playbook and you have to follow it. Jim saw an opportunity to go outside the playbook because he knew the customer,\" Dugan said. \"He persevered and (McDonald's) listened, and the rest is history.\" \nDelligatti headed M&J Management, a four-generation family business and McDonald's franchise organization for more than 60 years. He opened his first McDonald's in Pittsburgh's North Hills suburbs in 1957. In 1979, he co-founded Pittsburgh's Ronald McDonald House, then the seventh such facility in the country, where families can stay when children travel to Pittsburgh for life-saving medical care, and he was involved in several other charities. \nDelligatti also helped introduce breakfast service at McDonald's, developing the hotcakes and sausage meal to feed hungry steelworkers on their way home from overnight shifts in the mills, his family said. \nIn addition to his two sons, Jim Delligatti is survived by his wife, Ellie, five grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren. \nThe Devlin Funeral Home near Pittsburgh is handling visitation Thursday and Friday. Delligatti's funeral will be held Saturday at St. Joseph's Parish in O'Hara Township.  ",

      "text": "Creator of McDonald's flagship sandwich, the Big Mac, dies By JOE MANDAKAssociated Press \nPITTSBURGH (AP) - You probably haven't heard his name, but you likely have devoured his creation: two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, on a sesame seed bun. \nMichael James \"Jim\" Delligatti, the McDonald's franchisee who created the Big Mac nearly 50 years ago, died Monday at home in Pittsburgh surrounded by his family, family spokeswoman Kerry Ford said Wednesday. Delligatti was 98. \nUntil his health trailed off the last couple of years, Delligatti ate at least one 540-calorie Big Mac a week, his son Michael said. \nDelligatti's franchise was based in Uniontown, not far from Pittsburgh, when he invented the chain's signature burger in 1967 after deciding customers wanted a bigger sandwich. \nMichael Delligatti said McDonald's executives told his father he could experiment with a bigger burger but only using products the restaurant already stocked. \n\"He was often asked why he named it the Big Mac, and he said because Big Mc sounded too funny,\" Delligatti said. \nJim Delligatti told The Associated Press in 2006 that McDonald's resisted the idea at first because its simple lineup of hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries and shakes was selling well. \n\"They figured, why go to something else if (the original menu) was working so well?\" Delligatti said then. \"But it went over so well in Uniontown that we were allowed to bring it to two stores in Pittsburgh for a couple of weeks.\" \nDemand exploded as Delligatti's sandwich spread to the rest of his 47 stores in Pennsylvania and was added to the chain's national menu in 1968. \nMcDonald's has sold billions of Big Macs since then, in more than 100 countries. When the burger turned 40, McDonald's estimated it was selling 550 million Big Macs a year, or roughly 17 every second. \n\"Delligatti was a legendary franchisee within McDonald's system who made a lasting impression on our brand,\" the Oak Brook, Illinois-based company said Wednesday in a statement. The Big Mac \"has become an iconic sandwich enjoyed by many around the world.\" \nAnn Dugan, a former assistant dean of the University of Pittsburgh's Katz School of Business and an expert on business franchises, said Jim Delligatti's genius was simple: He listened to customers who wanted a bigger burger. \n\"In franchising, there's always this set playbook and you have to follow it. Jim saw an opportunity to go outside the playbook because he knew the customer,\" Dugan said. \"He persevered and (McDonald's) listened, and the rest is history.\" \nDelligatti headed M&J Management, a four-generation family business and McDonald's franchise organization for more than 60 years. He opened his first McDonald's in Pittsburgh's North Hills suburbs in 1957. In 1979, he co-founded Pittsburgh's Ronald McDonald House, then the seventh such facility in the country, where families can stay when children travel to Pittsburgh for life-saving medical care, and he was involved in several other charities. \nDelligatti also helped introduce breakfast service at McDonald's, developing the hotcakes and sausage meal to feed hungry steelworkers on their way home from overnight shifts in the mills, his family said. \nIn addition to his two sons, Jim Delligatti is survived by his wife, Ellie, five grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren. \nThe Devlin Funeral Home near Pittsburgh is handling visitation Thursday and Friday. Delligatti's funeral will be held Saturday at St. Joseph's Parish in O'Hara Township. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Delligatti, the Pittsburgh-area McDonald's franchisee who created the Big Mac in 1967, has died. He was 98. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar, File) \nPITTSBURGH (AP) — You probably haven't heard his name, but you likely have devoured his creation: two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, on a sesame seed bun. \nMichael James \"Jim\" Delligatti, the McDonald's franchisee who created the Big Mac nearly 50 years ago, died Monday at home in Pittsburgh surrounded by his family, family spokeswoman Kerry Ford said Wednesday. Delligatti was 98. \nUntil his health trailed off the last couple of years, Delligatti ate at least one 540-calorie Big Mac a week, his son Michael said. \nDelligatti's franchise was based in Uniontown, not far from Pittsburgh, when he invented the chain's signature burger in 1967 after deciding customers wanted a bigger sandwich. \nMichael Delligatti said McDonald's executives told his father he could experiment with a bigger burger but only using products the restaurant already stocked. \n\"He was often asked why he named it the Big Mac, and he said because Big Mc sounded too funny,\" Delligatti said. \nJim Delligatti told The Associated Press in 2006 that McDonald's resisted the idea at first because its simple lineup of hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries and shakes was selling well. \n\"They figured, why go to something else if (the original menu) was working so well?\" Delligatti said then. \"But it went over so well in Uniontown that we were allowed to bring it to two stores in Pittsburgh for a couple of weeks.\" \nDemand exploded as Delligatti's sandwich spread to the rest of his 47 stores in Pennsylvania and was added to the chain's national menu in 1968. \nMcDonald's has sold billions of Big Macs since then, in more than 100 countries. When the burger turned 40, McDonald's estimated it was selling 550 million Big Macs a year, or roughly 17 every second. \n\"Delligatti was a legendary franchisee within McDonald's system who made a lasting impression on our brand,\" the Oak Brook, Illinois-based company said Wednesday in a statement. The Big Mac \"has become an iconic sandwich enjoyed by many around the world.\" \nAnn Dugan, a former assistant dean of the University of Pittsburgh's Katz School of Business and an expert on business franchises, said Jim Delligatti's genius was simple: He listened to customers who wanted a bigger burger. \n\"In franchising, there's always this set playbook and you have to follow it. Jim saw an opportunity to go outside the playbook because he knew the customer,\" Dugan said. \"He persevered and (McDonald's) listened, and the rest is history.\" \nDelligatti headed M&J Management, a four-generation family business and McDonald's franchise organization for more than 60 years. He opened his first McDonald's in Pittsburgh's North Hills suburbs in 1957. In 1979, he co-founded Pittsburgh's Ronald McDonald House, then the seventh such facility in the country, where families can stay when children travel to Pittsburgh for life-saving medical care, and he was involved in several other charities. \nDelligatti also helped introduce breakfast service at McDonald's, developing the hotcakes and sausage meal to feed hungry steelworkers on their way home from overnight shifts in the mills, his family said. \nIn addition to his two sons, Jim Delligatti is survived by his wife, Ellie, five grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren. \nThe Devlin Funeral Home near Pittsburgh is handling visitation Thursday and Friday. Delligatti's funeral will be held Saturday at St. Joseph's Parish in O'Hara Township. Tags",

      "text": "Creator of McDonald's flagship sandwich, the Big Mac, dies - KFVS12 News & Weather Cape Girardeau, Carbondale, Poplar Bluff Member Center: Creator of McDonald's flagship sandwich, the Big Mac, dies By JOE MANDAKAssociated Press \nPITTSBURGH (AP) - You probably don't know his name, but you've almost certainly devoured his creation: two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, on a sesame seed bun. \nMichael James \"Jim\" Delligatti, the McDonald's franchisee who created the Big Mac nearly 50 years ago and saw it become perhaps the best-known fast-food sandwich in the world, died Monday at home in Pittsburgh. Delligatti, who according to his son ate at least one 540-calorie Big Mac a week for decades, was 98. \nDelligatti's franchise was based in Uniontown, not far from Pittsburgh, when he invented the chain's signature burger in 1967 after deciding customers wanted a bigger sandwich. Demand exploded as Delligatti's sandwich spread to the rest of his 47 stores in Pennsylvania and was added to the chain's national menu in 1968. \n\"He was often asked why he named it the Big Mac, and he said because Big Mc sounded too funny,\" his son Michael Delligatti said. \nJim Delligatti told The Associated Press in 2006 that McDonald's resisted the idea at first because its simple lineup of hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries and shakes was selling well. \n\"They figured, why go to something else if (the original menu) was working so well?\" Delligatti said then. \nMcDonald's has sold billions of Big Macs since then, in more than 100 countries. When the burger turned 40, McDonald's estimated it was selling 550 million Big Macs a year, or roughly 17 every second. \n\"Delligatti was a legendary franchisee within McDonald's system who made a lasting impression on our brand,\" the Oak Brook, Illinois-based company said Wednesday in a statement. The Big Mac \"has become an iconic sandwich enjoyed by many around the world.\" \nAnn Dugan, a former assistant dean of the University of Pittsburgh's Katz School of Business and an expert on business franchises, said Jim Delligatti's genius was simple: He listened to customers who wanted a bigger burger. \n\"In franchising, there's always this set playbook and you have to follow it. Jim saw an opportunity to go outside the playbook because he knew the customer,\" Dugan said. \"He persevered and (McDonald's) listened, and the rest is history.\" \nDelligatti headed M&J Management, a four-generation family business and McDonald's franchise organization, for more than 60 years. He opened his first McDonald's in Pittsburgh's North Hills suburbs in 1957. In 1979, he co-founded Pittsburgh's Ronald McDonald House, then the seventh such facility in the country, where families can stay when children travel to Pittsburgh for life-saving medical care, and he was involved in several other charities. \nDelligatti also helped introduce breakfast service at McDonald's, developing the hotcakes and sausage meal to feed hungry steelworkers on their way home from overnight shifts in the mills, his family said. \nIn addition to his two sons, Jim Delligatti is survived by his wife, Ellie, five grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren. \nThe Devlin Funeral Home near Pittsburgh is handling visitation Thursday and Friday. Delligatti's funeral will be held Saturday at St. Joseph's Parish in O'Hara Township. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Jeff Sessions for attorney general, Kansas Rep. Mike Pompeo to head the CIA and former military intelligence chief Michael Flynn as his national security adviser By JOE MANDAKAssociated Press \nPITTSBURGH (AP) - You probably haven't heard his name, but you likely have devoured his creation: two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, on a sesame seed bun. \nMichael James \"Jim\" Delligatti, the McDonald's franchisee who created the Big Mac nearly 50 years ago, died Monday at home in Pittsburgh surrounded by his family, family spokeswoman Kerry Ford said Wednesday. Delligatti was 98. \nUntil his health trailed off the last couple of years, Delligatti ate at least one 540-calorie Big Mac a week, his son Michael said. \nDelligatti's franchise was based in Uniontown, not far from Pittsburgh, when he invented the chain's signature burger in 1967 after deciding customers wanted a bigger sandwich. \nMichael Delligatti said McDonald's executives told his father he could experiment with a bigger burger but only using products the restaurant already stocked. \n\"He was often asked why he named it the Big Mac, and he said because Big Mc sounded too funny,\" Delligatti said. \nJim Delligatti told The Associated Press in 2006 that McDonald's resisted the idea at first because its simple lineup of hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries and shakes was selling well. \n\"They figured, why go to something else if (the original menu) was working so well?\" Delligatti said then. \"But it went over so well in Uniontown that we were allowed to bring it to two stores in Pittsburgh for a couple of weeks.\" \nDemand exploded as Delligatti's sandwich spread to the rest of his 47 stores in Pennsylvania and was added to the chain's national menu in 1968. \nMcDonald's has sold billions of Big Macs since then, in more than 100 countries. When the burger turned 40, McDonald's estimated it was selling 550 million Big Macs a year, or roughly 17 every second. \n\"Delligatti was a legendary franchisee within McDonald's system who made a lasting impression on our brand,\" the Oak Brook, Illinois-based company said Wednesday in a statement. The Big Mac \"has become an iconic sandwich enjoyed by many around the world.\" \nAnn Dugan, a former assistant dean of the University of Pittsburgh's Katz School of Business and an expert on business franchises, said Jim Delligatti's genius was simple: He listened to customers who wanted a bigger burger. \n\"In franchising, there's always this set playbook and you have to follow it. Jim saw an opportunity to go outside the playbook because he knew the customer,\" Dugan said. \"He persevered and (McDonald's) listened, and the rest is history.\" \nDelligatti headed M&J Management, a four-generation family business and McDonald's franchise organization for more than 60 years. He opened his first McDonald's in Pittsburgh's North Hills suburbs in 1957. In 1979, he co-founded Pittsburgh's Ronald McDonald House, then the seventh such facility in the country, where families can stay when children travel to Pittsburgh for life-saving medical care, and he was involved in several other charities. \nDelligatti also helped introduce breakfast service at McDonald's, developing the hotcakes and sausage meal to feed hungry steelworkers on their way home from overnight shifts in the mills, his family said. \nIn addition to his two sons, Jim Delligatti is survived by his wife, Ellie, five grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren. \nThe Devlin Funeral Home near Pittsburgh is handling visitation Thursday and Friday. Delligatti's funeral will be held Saturday at St. Joseph's Parish in O'Hara Township. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Delligatti, the Pittsburgh-area McDonald's franchisee who created the Big Mac in 1967, has died. He was 98. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar, File) \nPITTSBURGH (AP) — You probably haven't heard his name, but you likely have devoured his creation: two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, on a sesame seed bun. \nMichael James \"Jim\" Delligatti, the McDonald's franchisee who created the Big Mac nearly 50 years ago, died Monday at home in Pittsburgh surrounded by his family, family spokeswoman Kerry Ford said Wednesday. Delligatti was 98. \nUntil his health trailed off the last couple of years, Delligatti ate at least one 540-calorie Big Mac a week, his son Michael said. \nDelligatti's franchise was based in Uniontown, not far from Pittsburgh, when he invented the chain's signature burger in 1967 after deciding customers wanted a bigger sandwich. \nMichael Delligatti said McDonald's executives told his father he could experiment with a bigger burger but only using products the restaurant already stocked. \n\"He was often asked why he named it the Big Mac, and he said because Big Mc sounded too funny,\" Delligatti said. \nJim Delligatti told The Associated Press in 2006 that McDonald's resisted the idea at first because its simple lineup of hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries and shakes was selling well. \n\"They figured, why go to something else if (the original menu) was working so well?\" Delligatti said then. \"But it went over so well in Uniontown that we were allowed to bring it to two stores in Pittsburgh for a couple of weeks.\" \nDemand exploded as Delligatti's sandwich spread to the rest of his 47 stores in Pennsylvania and was added to the chain's national menu in 1968. \nMcDonald's has sold billions of Big Macs since then, in more than 100 countries. When the burger turned 40, McDonald's estimated it was selling 550 million Big Macs a year, or roughly 17 every second. \n\"Delligatti was a legendary franchisee within McDonald's system who made a lasting impression on our brand,\" the Oak Brook, Illinois-based company said Wednesday in a statement. The Big Mac \"has become an iconic sandwich enjoyed by many around the world.\" \nAnn Dugan, a former assistant dean of the University of Pittsburgh's Katz School of Business and an expert on business franchises, said Jim Delligatti's genius was simple: He listened to customers who wanted a bigger burger.

Jim saw an opportunity to go outside the playbook because he knew the customer,\" Dugan said. \"He persevered and (McDonald's) listened, and the rest is history.\" \nDelligatti headed M&J Management, a four-generation family business and McDonald's franchise organization for more than 60 years. He opened his first McDonald's in Pittsburgh's North Hills suburbs in 1957. In 1979, he co-founded Pittsburgh's Ronald McDonald House, then the seventh such facility in the country, where families can stay when children travel to Pittsburgh for life-saving medical care, and he was involved in several other charities. \nDelligatti also helped introduce breakfast service at McDonald's, developing the hotcakes and sausage meal to feed hungry steelworkers on their way home from overnight shifts in the mills, his family said. \nIn addition to his two sons, Jim Delligatti is survived by his wife, Ellie, five grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren. \nThe Devlin Funeral Home near Pittsburgh is handling visitation Thursday and Friday. Delligatti's funeral will be held Saturday at St. Joseph's Parish in O'Hara Township. Tags",

Delligatti, the Pittsburgh-area McDonald's franchisee who created the Big Mac in 1967, has died. He was 98. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar, File) \nPITTSBURGH (AP) — You probably haven't heard his name, but you likely have devoured his creation: two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, on a sesame seed bun. \nMichael James \"Jim\" Delligatti, the McDonald's franchisee who created the Big Mac nearly 50 years ago, died Monday at home in Pittsburgh surrounded by his family, family spokeswoman Kerry Ford said Wednesday. Delligatti was 98. \nUntil his health trailed off the last couple of years, Delligatti ate at least one 540-calorie Big Mac a week, his son Michael said. \nDelligatti's franchise was based in Uniontown, not far from Pittsburgh, when he invented the chain's signature burger in 1967 after deciding customers wanted a bigger sandwich. \nMichael Delligatti said McDonald's executives told his father he could experiment with a bigger burger but only using products the restaurant already stocked. \n\"He was often asked why he named it the Big Mac, and he said because Big Mc sounded too funny,\" Delligatti said. \nJim Delligatti told The Associated Press in 2006 that McDonald's resisted the idea at first because its simple lineup of hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries and shakes was selling well. \n\"They figured, why go to something else if (the original menu) was working so well?\" Delligatti said then. \"But it went over so well in Uniontown that we were allowed to bring it to two stores in Pittsburgh for a couple of weeks.\" \nDemand exploded as Delligatti's sandwich spread to the rest of his 47 stores in Pennsylvania and was added to the chain's national menu in 1968. \nMcDonald's has sold billions of Big Macs since then, in more than 100 countries. When the burger turned 40, McDonald's estimated it was selling 550 million Big Macs a year, or roughly 17 every second. \n\"Delligatti was a legendary franchisee within McDonald's system who made a lasting impression on our brand,\" the Oak Brook, Illinois-based company said Wednesday in a statement. The Big Mac \"has become an iconic sandwich enjoyed by many around the world.\" \nAnn Dugan, a former assistant dean of the University of Pittsburgh's Katz School of Business and an expert on business franchises, said Jim Delligatti's genius was simple: He listened to customers who wanted a bigger burger.

Jim saw an opportunity to go outside the playbook because he knew the customer,\" Dugan said. \"He persevered and (McDonald's) listened, and the rest is history.\" \nDelligatti headed M&J Management, a four-generation family business and McDonald's franchise organization for more than 60 years. He opened his first McDonald's in Pittsburgh's North Hills suburbs in 1957. In 1979, he co-founded Pittsburgh's Ronald McDonald House, then the seventh such facility in the country, where families can stay when children travel to Pittsburgh for life-saving medical care, and he was involved in several other charities. \nDelligatti also helped introduce breakfast service at McDonald's, developing the hotcakes and sausage meal to feed hungry steelworkers on their way home from overnight shifts in the mills, his family said. \nIn addition to his two sons, Jim Delligatti is survived by his wife, Ellie, five grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren. \nThe Devlin Funeral Home near Pittsburgh is handling visitation Thursday and Friday. Delligatti's funeral will be held Saturday at St. Joseph's Parish in O'Hara Township. ***",

      "text": "Creator of McDonald's flagship sandwich, the Big Mac, dies By JOE MANDAKAssociated Press \nPITTSBURGH (AP) - You probably haven't heard his name, but you likely have devoured his creation: two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, on a sesame seed bun. \nMichael James \"Jim\" Delligatti, the McDonald's franchisee who created the Big Mac nearly 50 years ago, died Monday at home in Pittsburgh surrounded by his family, family spokeswoman Kerry Ford said Wednesday. Delligatti was 98. \nUntil his health trailed off the last couple of years, Delligatti ate at least one 540-calorie Big Mac a week, his son Michael said. \nDelligatti's franchise was based in Uniontown, not far from Pittsburgh, when he invented the chain's signature burger in 1967 after deciding customers wanted a bigger sandwich. \nMichael Delligatti said McDonald's executives told his father he could experiment with a bigger burger but only using products the restaurant already stocked. \n\"He was often asked why he named it the Big Mac, and he said because Big Mc sounded too funny,\" Delligatti said. \nJim Delligatti told The Associated Press in 2006 that McDonald's resisted the idea at first because its simple lineup of hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries and shakes was selling well. \n\"They figured, why go to something else if (the original menu) was working so well?\" Delligatti said then. \"But it went over so well in Uniontown that we were allowed to bring it to two stores in Pittsburgh for a couple of weeks.\" \nDemand exploded as Delligatti's sandwich spread to the rest of his 47 stores in Pennsylvania and was added to the chain's national menu in 1968. \nMcDonald's has sold billions of Big Macs since then, in more than 100 countries. When the burger turned 40, McDonald's estimated it was selling 550 million Big Macs a year, or roughly 17 every second. \n\"Delligatti was a legendary franchisee within McDonald's system who made a lasting impression on our brand,\" the Oak Brook, Illinois-based company said Wednesday in a statement. The Big Mac \"has become an iconic sandwich enjoyed by many around the world.\" \nAnn Dugan, a former assistant dean of the University of Pittsburgh's Katz School of Business and an expert on business franchises, said Jim Delligatti's genius was simple: He listened to customers who wanted a bigger burger. \n\"In franchising, there's always this set playbook and you have to follow it. Jim saw an opportunity to go outside the playbook because he knew the customer,\" Dugan said. \"He persevered and (McDonald's) listened, and the rest is history.\" \nDelligatti headed M&J Management, a four-generation family business and McDonald's franchise organization for more than 60 years. He opened his first McDonald's in Pittsburgh's North Hills suburbs in 1957. In 1979, he co-founded Pittsburgh's Ronald McDonald House, then the seventh such facility in the country, where families can stay when children travel to Pittsburgh for life-saving medical care, and he was involved in several other charities. \nDelligatti also helped introduce breakfast service at McDonald's, developing the hotcakes and sausage meal to feed hungry steelworkers on their way home from overnight shifts in the mills, his family said. \nIn addition to his two sons, Jim Delligatti is survived by his wife, Ellie, five grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren. \nThe Devlin Funeral Home near Pittsburgh is handling visitation Thursday and Friday. Delligatti's funeral will be held Saturday at St. Joseph's Parish in O'Hara Township. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

      "text": "McDonald's Big Mac Creator Dies at 98 McDonald's Big Mac Creator Dies at 98 11/30/2016 9:37 AM PST BY TMZ STAFF Breaking News \nThe man who created McDonald's most iconic burger has gone to the big burger stand in the sky. \nMichael \"Jim\" Delligatti , who made the first Big Mac, died in his home in Pittsburgh Monday night surrounded by family ... according to a McDonald's spokesperson. \nDelligatti, who owned multiple McDonald's franchises in Pennsylvania, first thought of the Big Mac in the mid-1960s ... when he wanted to offer customers a bigger burger than what Mickey D's was offering at the time. McDonald's was reportedly opposed at first, but the burger gods ended up going with his idea in 1968. It was already a hit at all of his stores in PA. \nDelligatti was 98. In case you forgot his invention inspired that awesome jingle. \nSorry, you're gonna be singing this all day.",

      "text": "PITTSBURGH (AP) — You probably don’t know his name, but you’ve almost certainly devoured his creation: two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, on a sesame seed bun.\nMichael James “Jim” Delligatti, the McDonald’s franchisee who created the Big Mac nearly 50 years ago and saw it become perhaps the best-known fast-food sandwich in the world, died Monday at home in Pittsburgh. Delligatti, who according to his son ate at least one 540-calorie Big Mac a week for decades, was 98.\nDelligatti’s franchise was based in Uniontown, not far from Pittsburgh, when he invented the chain’s signature burger in 1967 after deciding customers wanted a bigger sandwich. Demand exploded as Delligatti’s sandwich spread to the rest of his 47 stores in Pennsylvania and was added to the chain’s national menu in 1968.\n“He was often asked why he named it the Big Mac, and he said because Big Mc sounded too funny,” his son Michael Delligatti said.\nJim Delligatti told The Associated Press in 2006 that McDonald’s resisted the idea at first because its simple lineup of hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries and shakes was selling well.\n“They figured, why go to something else if (the original menu) was working so well?” Delligatti said then.\nMcDonald’s has sold billions of Big Macs since then, in more than 100 countries.

The Big Mac “has become an iconic sandwich enjoyed by many around the world.”\nAnn Dugan, a former assistant dean of the University of Pittsburgh’s Katz School of Business and an expert on business franchises, said Jim Delligatti’s genius was simple: He listened to customers who wanted a bigger burger.\n“In franchising, there’s always this set playbook and you have to follow it. Jim saw an opportunity to go outside the playbook because he knew the customer,” Dugan said. “He persevered and (McDonald’s) listened, and the rest is history.”\nDelligatti headed M&J Management, a four-generation family business and McDonald’s franchise organization, for more than 60 years. He opened his first McDonald’s in Pittsburgh’s North Hills suburbs in 1957. In 1979, he co-founded Pittsburgh’s Ronald McDonald House, then the seventh such facility in the country, where families can stay when children travel to Pittsburgh for life-saving medical care, and he was involved in several other charities.\nDelligatti also helped introduce breakfast service at McDonald’s, developing the hotcakes and sausage meal to feed hungry steelworkers on their way home from overnight shifts in the mills, his family said.\nIn addition to his two sons, Jim Delligatti is survived by his wife, Ellie, five grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren.\nThe Devlin Funeral Home near Pittsburgh is handling visitation Thursday and Friday.

      "text": "Creator of McDonald's flagship sandwich, the Big Mac, dies By JOE MANDAKAssociated Press \nPITTSBURGH (AP) - You probably don't know his name, but you've almost certainly devoured his creation: two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, on a sesame seed bun. \nMichael James \"Jim\" Delligatti, the McDonald's franchisee who created the Big Mac nearly 50 years ago and saw it become perhaps the best-known fast-food sandwich in the world, died Monday at home in Pittsburgh. Delligatti, who according to his son ate at least one 540-calorie Big Mac a week for decades, was 98. \nDelligatti's franchise was based in Uniontown, not far from Pittsburgh, when he invented the chain's signature burger in 1967 after deciding customers wanted a bigger sandwich. Demand exploded as Delligatti's sandwich spread to the rest of his 47 stores in Pennsylvania and was added to the chain's national menu in 1968. \n\"He was often asked why he named it the Big Mac, and he said because Big Mc sounded too funny,\" his son Michael Delligatti said. \nJim Delligatti told The Associated Press in 2006 that McDonald's resisted the idea at first because its simple lineup of hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries and shakes was selling well. \n\"They figured, why go to something else if (the original menu) was working so well?\" Delligatti said then. \nMcDonald's has sold billions of Big Macs since then, in more than 100 countries. When the burger turned 40, McDonald's estimated it was selling 550 million Big Macs a year, or roughly 17 every second. \n\"Delligatti was a legendary franchisee within McDonald's system who made a lasting impression on our brand,\" the Oak Brook, Illinois-based company said Wednesday in a statement. The Big Mac \"has become an iconic sandwich enjoyed by many around the world.\" \nAnn Dugan, a former assistant dean of the University of Pittsburgh's Katz School of Business and an expert on business franchises, said Jim Delligatti's genius was simple: He listened to customers who wanted a bigger burger. \n\"In franchising, there's always this set playbook and you have to follow it. Jim saw an opportunity to go outside the playbook because he knew the customer,\" Dugan said. \"He persevered and (McDonald's) listened, and the rest is history.\" \nDelligatti headed M&J Management, a four-generation family business and McDonald's franchise organization, for more than 60 years. He opened his first McDonald's in Pittsburgh's North Hills suburbs in 1957. In 1979, he co-founded Pittsburgh's Ronald McDonald House, then the seventh such facility in the country, where families can stay when children travel to Pittsburgh for life-saving medical care, and he was involved in several other charities. \nDelligatti also helped introduce breakfast service at McDonald's, developing the hotcakes and sausage meal to feed hungry steelworkers on their way home from overnight shifts in the mills, his family said. \nIn addition to his two sons, Jim Delligatti is survived by his wife, Ellie, five grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren. \nThe Devlin Funeral Home near Pittsburgh is handling visitation Thursday and Friday. Delligatti's funeral will be held Saturday at St. Joseph's Parish in O'Hara Township. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Delligatti, the Pittsburgh-area McDonald’s franchisee who created the Big Mac in 1967, has died. He was 98. By Joe Mandak, Associated Press Wednesday, Nov. 30, 2016 | 9:33 a.m. \nPITTSBURGH — You probably haven't heard his name, but you likely have devoured his creation: two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, on a sesame seed bun. \nMichael James \"Jim\" Delligatti, the McDonald's franchisee who created the Big Mac nearly 50 years ago, died Monday at home in Pittsburgh surrounded by his family, family spokeswoman Kerry Ford said Wednesday. Delligatti was 98. \nUntil his health trailed off the last couple of years, Delligatti ate at least one 540-calorie Big Mac a week, his son Michael said. \nDelligatti's franchise was based in Uniontown, not far from Pittsburgh, when he invented the chain's signature burger in 1967 after deciding customers wanted a bigger sandwich. \nMichael Delligatti said McDonald's executives told his father he could experiment with a bigger burger but only using products the restaurant already stocked. \n\"He was often asked why he named it the Big Mac, and he said because Big Mc sounded too funny,\" Delligatti said. \nJim Delligatti told The Associated Press in 2006 that McDonald's resisted the idea at first because its simple lineup of hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries and shakes was selling well. \n\"They figured, why go to something else if (the original menu) was working so well?\" Delligatti said then. \"But it went over so well in Uniontown that we were allowed to bring it to two stores in Pittsburgh for a couple of weeks.\" \nDemand exploded as Delligatti's sandwich spread to the rest of his 47 stores in Pennsylvania and was added to the chain's national menu in 1968. \nMcDonald's has sold billions of Big Macs since then, in more than 100 countries. When the burger turned 40, McDonald's estimated it was selling 550 million Big Macs a year, or roughly 17 every second. \n\"Delligatti was a legendary franchisee within McDonald's system who made a lasting impression on our brand,\" the Oak Brook, Illinois-based company said Wednesday in a statement. The Big Mac \"has become an iconic sandwich enjoyed by many around the world.\" \nAnn Dugan, a former assistant dean of the University of Pittsburgh's Katz School of Business and an expert on business franchises, said Jim Delligatti's genius was simple: He listened to customers who wanted a bigger burger. \n\"In franchising, there's always this set playbook and you have to follow it. Jim saw an opportunity to go outside the playbook because he knew the customer,\" Dugan said. \"He persevered and (McDonald's) listened, and the rest is history.\" \nDelligatti headed M&J Management, a four-generation family business and McDonald's franchise organization for more than 60 years. He opened his first McDonald's in Pittsburgh's North Hills suburbs in 1957. In 1979, he co-founded Pittsburgh's Ronald McDonald House, then the seventh such facility in the country, where families can stay when children travel to Pittsburgh for life-saving medical care, and he was involved in several other charities. \nDelligatti also helped introduce breakfast service at McDonald's, developing the hotcakes and sausage meal to feed hungry steelworkers on their way home from overnight shifts in the mills, his family said. \nIn addition to his two sons, Jim Delligatti is survived by his wife, Ellie, five grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren. \nThe Devlin Funeral Home near Pittsburgh is handling visitation Thursday and Friday. Delligatti's funeral will be held Saturday at St. Joseph's Parish in O'Hara Township.",

      "text": "Creator of McDonald's flagship sandwich, the Big Mac, dies By JOE MANDAKAssociated Press \nPITTSBURGH (AP) - You probably don't know his name, but you've almost certainly devoured his creation: two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, on a sesame seed bun. \nMichael James \"Jim\" Delligatti, the McDonald's franchisee who created the Big Mac nearly 50 years ago and saw it become perhaps the best-known fast-food sandwich in the world, died Monday at home in Pittsburgh. Delligatti, who according to his son ate at least one 540-calorie Big Mac a week for decades, was 98. \nDelligatti's franchise was based in Uniontown, not far from Pittsburgh, when he invented the chain's signature burger in 1967 after deciding customers wanted a bigger sandwich. Demand exploded as Delligatti's sandwich spread to the rest of his 47 stores in Pennsylvania and was added to the chain's national menu in 1968. \n\"He was often asked why he named it the Big Mac, and he said because Big Mc sounded too funny,\" his son Michael Delligatti said. \nJim Delligatti told The Associated Press in 2006 that McDonald's resisted the idea at first because its simple lineup of hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries and shakes was selling well. \n\"They figured, why go to something else if (the original menu) was working so well?\" Delligatti said then. \nMcDonald's has sold billions of Big Macs since then, in more than 100 countries. When the burger turned 40, McDonald's estimated it was selling 550 million Big Macs a year, or roughly 17 every second. \n\"Delligatti was a legendary franchisee within McDonald's system who made a lasting impression on our brand,\" the Oak Brook, Illinois-based company said Wednesday in a statement. The Big Mac \"has become an iconic sandwich enjoyed by many around the world.\" \nAnn Dugan, a former assistant dean of the University of Pittsburgh's Katz School of Business and an expert on business franchises, said Jim Delligatti's genius was simple: He listened to customers who wanted a bigger burger. \n\"In franchising, there's always this set playbook and you have to follow it. Jim saw an opportunity to go outside the playbook because he knew the customer,\" Dugan said. \"He persevered and (McDonald's) listened, and the rest is history.\" \nDelligatti headed M&J Management, a four-generation family business and McDonald's franchise organization, for more than 60 years. He opened his first McDonald's in Pittsburgh's North Hills suburbs in 1957. In 1979, he co-founded Pittsburgh's Ronald McDonald House, then the seventh such facility in the country, where families can stay when children travel to Pittsburgh for life-saving medical care, and he was involved in several other charities. \nDelligatti also helped introduce breakfast service at McDonald's, developing the hotcakes and sausage meal to feed hungry steelworkers on their way home from overnight shifts in the mills, his family said. \nIn addition to his two sons, Jim Delligatti is survived by his wife, Ellie, five grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren. \nThe Devlin Funeral Home near Pittsburgh is handling visitation Thursday and Friday. Delligatti's funeral will be held Saturday at St. Joseph's Parish in O'Hara Township. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

      "text": "Creator of McDonald's flagship sandwich, the Big Mac, dies By JOE MANDAKAssociated Press \nPITTSBURGH (AP) - You probably don't know his name, but you've almost certainly devoured his creation: two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, on a sesame seed bun. \nMichael James \"Jim\" Delligatti, the McDonald's franchisee who created the Big Mac nearly 50 years ago and saw it become perhaps the best-known fast-food sandwich in the world, died Monday at home in Pittsburgh. Delligatti, who according to his son ate at least one 540-calorie Big Mac a week for decades, was 98. \nDelligatti's franchise was based in Uniontown, not far from Pittsburgh, when he invented the chain's signature burger in 1967 after deciding customers wanted a bigger sandwich. Demand exploded as Delligatti's sandwich spread to the rest of his 47 stores in Pennsylvania and was added to the chain's national menu in 1968. \n\"He was often asked why he named it the Big Mac, and he said because Big Mc sounded too funny,\" his son Michael Delligatti said. \nJim Delligatti told The Associated Press in 2006 that McDonald's resisted the idea at first because its simple lineup of hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries and shakes was selling well. \n\"They figured, why go to something else if (the original menu) was working so well?\" Delligatti said then. \nMcDonald's has sold billions of Big Macs since then, in more than 100 countries. When the burger turned 40, McDonald's estimated it was selling 550 million Big Macs a year, or roughly 17 every second. \n\"Delligatti was a legendary franchisee within McDonald's system who made a lasting impression on our brand,\" the Oak Brook, Illinois-based company said Wednesday in a statement. The Big Mac \"has become an iconic sandwich enjoyed by many around the world.\" \nAnn Dugan, a former assistant dean of the University of Pittsburgh's Katz School of Business and an expert on business franchises, said Jim Delligatti's genius was simple: He listened to customers who wanted a bigger burger. \n\"In franchising, there's always this set playbook and you have to follow it. Jim saw an opportunity to go outside the playbook because he knew the customer,\" Dugan said. \"He persevered and (McDonald's) listened, and the rest is history.\" \nDelligatti headed M&J Management, a four-generation family business and McDonald's franchise organization, for more than 60 years. He opened his first McDonald's in Pittsburgh's North Hills suburbs in 1957. In 1979, he co-founded Pittsburgh's Ronald McDonald House, then the seventh such facility in the country, where families can stay when children travel to Pittsburgh for life-saving medical care, and he was involved in several other charities. \nDelligatti also helped introduce breakfast service at McDonald's, developing the hotcakes and sausage meal to feed hungry steelworkers on their way home from overnight shifts in the mills, his family said. \nIn addition to his two sons, Jim Delligatti is survived by his wife, Ellie, five grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren. \nThe Devlin Funeral Home near Pittsburgh is handling visitation Thursday and Friday. Delligatti's funeral will be held Saturday at St. Joseph's Parish in O'Hara Township. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

      "text": "Creator of McDonald's flagship sandwich, the Big Mac, dies By JOE MANDAKAssociated Press \nPITTSBURGH (AP) - You probably don't know his name, but you've almost certainly devoured his creation: two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, on a sesame seed bun. \nMichael James \"Jim\" Delligatti, the McDonald's franchisee who created the Big Mac nearly 50 years ago and saw it become perhaps the best-known fast-food sandwich in the world, died Monday at home in Pittsburgh. Delligatti, who according to his son ate at least one 540-calorie Big Mac a week for decades, was 98. \nDelligatti's franchise was based in Uniontown, not far from Pittsburgh, when he invented the chain's signature burger in 1967 after deciding customers wanted a bigger sandwich. Demand exploded as Delligatti's sandwich spread to the rest of his 47 stores in Pennsylvania and was added to the chain's national menu in 1968. \n\"He was often asked why he named it the Big Mac, and he said because Big Mc sounded too funny,\" his son Michael Delligatti said. \nJim Delligatti told The Associated Press in 2006 that McDonald's resisted the idea at first because its simple lineup of hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries and shakes was selling well. \n\"They figured, why go to something else if (the original menu) was working so well?\" Delligatti said then. \nMcDonald's has sold billions of Big Macs since then, in more than 100 countries. When the burger turned 40, McDonald's estimated it was selling 550 million Big Macs a year, or roughly 17 every second. \n\"Delligatti was a legendary franchisee within McDonald's system who made a lasting impression on our brand,\" the Oak Brook, Illinois-based company said Wednesday in a statement.

      "text": "Creator of McDonald's flagship sandwich, the Big Mac, dies By JOE MANDAKAssociated Press \nPITTSBURGH (AP) - You probably don't know his name, but you've almost certainly devoured his creation: two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, on a sesame seed bun. \nMichael James \"Jim\" Delligatti, the McDonald's franchisee who created the Big Mac nearly 50 years ago and saw it become perhaps the best-known fast-food sandwich in the world, died Monday at home in Pittsburgh. Delligatti, who according to his son ate at least one 540-calorie Big Mac a week for decades, was 98. \nDelligatti's franchise was based in Uniontown, not far from Pittsburgh, when he invented the chain's signature burger in 1967 after deciding customers wanted a bigger sandwich. Demand exploded as Delligatti's sandwich spread to the rest of his 47 stores in Pennsylvania and was added to the chain's national menu in 1968. \n\"He was often asked why he named it the Big Mac, and he said because Big Mc sounded too funny,\" his son Michael Delligatti said. \nJim Delligatti told The Associated Press in 2006 that McDonald's resisted the idea at first because its simple lineup of hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries and shakes was selling well. \n\"They figured, why go to something else if (the original menu) was working so well?\" Delligatti said then. \nMcDonald's has sold billions of Big Macs since then, in more than 100 countries. When the burger turned 40, McDonald's estimated it was selling 550 million Big Macs a year, or roughly 17 every second. \n\"Delligatti was a legendary franchisee within McDonald's system who made a lasting impression on our brand,\" the Oak Brook, Illinois-based company said Wednesday in a statement. The Big Mac \"has become an iconic sandwich enjoyed by many around the world.\" \nAnn Dugan, a former assistant dean of the University of Pittsburgh's Katz School of Business and an expert on business franchises, said Jim Delligatti's genius was simple: He listened to customers who wanted a bigger burger. \n\"In franchising, there's always this set playbook and you have to follow it. Jim saw an opportunity to go outside the playbook because he knew the customer,\" Dugan said. \"He persevered and (McDonald's) listened, and the rest is history.\" \nDelligatti headed M&J Management, a four-generation family business and McDonald's franchise organization, for more than 60 years. He opened his first McDonald's in Pittsburgh's North Hills suburbs in 1957. In 1979, he co-founded Pittsburgh's Ronald McDonald House, then the seventh such facility in the country, where families can stay when children travel to Pittsburgh for life-saving medical care, and he was involved in several other charities. \nDelligatti also helped introduce breakfast service at McDonald's, developing the hotcakes and sausage meal to feed hungry steelworkers on their way home from overnight shifts in the mills, his family said. \nIn addition to his two sons, Jim Delligatti is survived by his wife, Ellie, five grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren. \nThe Devlin Funeral Home near Pittsburgh is handling visitation Thursday and Friday. Delligatti's funeral will be held Saturday at St. Joseph's Parish in O'Hara Township. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

      "text": "Creator of McDonald's flagship sandwich, the Big Mac, dies Posted: By JOE MANDAKAssociated Press \nPITTSBURGH (AP) - You probably don't know his name, but you've almost certainly devoured his creation: two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, on a sesame seed bun. \nMichael James \"Jim\" Delligatti, the McDonald's franchisee who created the Big Mac nearly 50 years ago and saw it become perhaps the best-known fast-food sandwich in the world, died Monday at home in Pittsburgh. Delligatti, who according to his son ate at least one 540-calorie Big Mac a week for decades, was 98. \nDelligatti's franchise was based in Uniontown, not far from Pittsburgh, when he invented the chain's signature burger in 1967 after deciding customers wanted a bigger sandwich. Demand exploded as Delligatti's sandwich spread to the rest of his 47 stores in Pennsylvania and was added to the chain's national menu in 1968. \n\"He was often asked why he named it the Big Mac, and he said because Big Mc sounded too funny,\" his son Michael Delligatti said. \nJim Delligatti told The Associated Press in 2006 that McDonald's resisted the idea at first because its simple lineup of hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries and shakes was selling well. \n\"They figured, why go to something else if (the original menu) was working so well?\" Delligatti said then. \nMcDonald's has sold billions of Big Macs since then, in more than 100 countries. When the burger turned 40, McDonald's estimated it was selling 550 million Big Macs a year, or roughly 17 every second. \n\"Delligatti was a legendary franchisee within McDonald's system who made a lasting impression on our brand,\" the Oak Brook, Illinois-based company said Wednesday in a statement. The Big Mac \"has become an iconic sandwich enjoyed by many around the world.\" \nAnn Dugan, a former assistant dean of the University of Pittsburgh's Katz School of Business and an expert on business franchises, said Jim Delligatti's genius was simple: He listened to customers who wanted a bigger burger. \n\"In franchising, there's always this set playbook and you have to follow it. Jim saw an opportunity to go outside the playbook because he knew the customer,\" Dugan said. \"He persevered and (McDonald's) listened, and the rest is history.\" \nDelligatti headed M&J Management, a four-generation family business and McDonald's franchise organization, for more than 60 years. He opened his first McDonald's in Pittsburgh's North Hills suburbs in 1957. In 1979, he co-founded Pittsburgh's Ronald McDonald House, then the seventh such facility in the country, where families can stay when children travel to Pittsburgh for life-saving medical care, and he was involved in several other charities. \nDelligatti also helped introduce breakfast service at McDonald's, developing the hotcakes and sausage meal to feed hungry steelworkers on their way home from overnight shifts in the mills, his family said. \nIn addition to his two sons, Jim Delligatti is survived by his wife, Ellie, five grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren. \nThe Devlin Funeral Home near Pittsburgh is handling visitation Thursday and Friday. Delligatti's funeral will be held Saturday at St. Joseph's Parish in O'Hara Township.  ",

Puskar) \nPITTSBURGH—You probably don’t know his name, but you’ve almost certainly devoured his creation: two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, on a sesame seed bun. \nMichael James “Jim” Delligatti, the McDonald’s franchisee who created the Big Mac nearly 50 years ago and saw it become perhaps the best-known fast-food sandwich in the world, died Monday at home in Pittsburgh. Delligatti, who according to his son ate at least one 540-calorie Big Mac a week for decades, was 98. \nDelligatti’s franchise was based in Uniontown, not far from Pittsburgh, when he invented the chain’s signature burger in 1967 after deciding customers wanted a bigger sandwich. Demand exploded as Delligatti’s sandwich spread to the rest of his 47 stores in Pennsylvania and was added to the chain’s national menu in 1968. \n“He was often asked why he named it the Big Mac, and he said because Big Mc sounded too funny,” his son Michael Delligatti said. \nJim Delligatti told The Associated Press in 2006 that McDonald’s resisted the idea at first because its simple lineup of hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries and shakes was selling well. \n“They figured, why go to something else if (the original menu) was working so well?” Delligatti said then.

Puskar, File) \nMcDonald’s has sold billions of Big Macs since then, in more than 100 countries. When the burger turned 40, McDonald’s estimated it was selling 550 million Big Macs a year, or roughly 17 every second. \n“Delligatti was a legendary franchisee within McDonald’s system who made a lasting impression on our brand,” the Oak Brook, Illinois-based company said Wednesday in a statement. The Big Mac “has become an iconic sandwich enjoyed by many around the world.” \nAnn Dugan, a former assistant dean of the University of Pittsburgh’s Katz School of Business and an expert on business franchises, said Jim Delligatti’s genius was simple: He listened to customers who wanted a bigger burger. \n“In franchising, there’s always this set playbook and you have to follow it. Jim saw an opportunity to go outside the playbook because he knew the customer,” Dugan said. “He persevered and (McDonald’s) listened, and the rest is history.” \nDelligatti headed M&J Management, a four-generation family business and McDonald’s franchise organization, for more than 60 years. He opened his first McDonald’s in Pittsburgh’s North Hills suburbs in 1957. In 1979, he co-founded Pittsburgh’s Ronald McDonald House, then the seventh such facility in the country, where families can stay when children travel to Pittsburgh for life-saving medical care, and he was involved in several other charities. \nDelligatti also helped introduce breakfast service at McDonald’s, developing the hotcakes and sausage meal to feed hungry steelworkers on their way home from overnight shifts in the mills, his family said. \nIn addition to his two sons, Jim Delligatti is survived by his wife, Ellie, five grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren. \nThe Devlin Funeral Home near Pittsburgh is handling visitation Thursday and Friday. Delligatti’s funeral will be held Saturday at St. Joseph’s Parish in O’Hara Township. Editor’s Picks",

Delligatti, who according to his son ate at least one 540-calorie Big Mac a week for decades, was 98. \nDelligatti's franchise was based in Uniontown, not far from Pittsburgh, when he invented the chain's signature burger in 1967 after deciding customers wanted a bigger sandwich. Demand exploded as Delligatti's sandwich spread to the rest of his 47 stores in Pennsylvania and was added to the chain's national menu in 1968. \n\"He was often asked why he named it the Big Mac, and he said because Big Mc sounded too funny,\" his son Michael Delligatti said. \nJim Delligatti told The Associated Press in 2006 that McDonald's resisted the idea at first because its simple lineup of hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries and shakes was selling well. \n\"They figured, why go to something else if (the original menu) was working so well?\" Delligatti said then. \nMcDonald's has sold billions of Big Macs since then, in more than 100 countries. When the burger turned 40, McDonald's estimated it was selling 550 million Big Macs a year, or roughly 17 every second. \n\"Delligatti was a legendary franchisee within McDonald's system who made a lasting impression on our brand,\" the Oak Brook, Illinois-based company said Wednesday in a statement. The Big Mac \"has become an iconic sandwich enjoyed by many around the world.\" \nAnn Dugan, a former assistant dean of the University of Pittsburgh's Katz School of Business and an expert on business franchises, said Jim Delligatti's genius was simple: He listened to customers who wanted a bigger burger. \n\"In franchising, there's always this set playbook and you have to follow it. Jim saw an opportunity to go outside the playbook because he knew the customer,\" Dugan said. \"He persevered and (McDonald's) listened, and the rest is history.\" \nDelligatti headed M&J Management, a four-generation family business and McDonald's franchise organization, for more than 60 years. He opened his first McDonald's in Pittsburgh's North Hills suburbs in 1957. In 1979, he co-founded Pittsburgh's Ronald McDonald House, then the seventh such facility in the country, where families can stay when children travel to Pittsburgh for life-saving medical care, and he was involved in several other charities. \nDelligatti also helped introduce breakfast service at McDonald's, developing the hotcakes and sausage meal to feed hungry steelworkers on their way home from overnight shifts in the mills, his family said. \nIn addition to his two sons, Jim Delligatti is survived by his wife, Ellie, five grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren. \nThe Devlin Funeral Home near Pittsburgh is handling visitation Thursday and Friday. Delligatti's funeral will be held Saturday at St. Joseph's Parish in O'Hara Township. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

      "text": "\nFirst things first, dying sucks so thoughts & prayers to his family. He was 98 and lived longer than most people.\nNow I can get to how I really feel: f*ck McDonalds. I haven’t eaten McDonalds since I was a drunk high school student, which is arguably when the dumbest version of myself ever existed. Forget about all the shady shit they find in the chicken nuggets, the f*cking BURGERS man, that’s like some alien shit. If you can look me in the face and tell me you believe that it’s 100% beef and I will give you trophy because you’ll officially be the World’s Biggest Asshole. If it weren’t for the heaping pile of dog shit that is Burger King (other than chicken fries, shout out chicken fries), more people would be woke to the fact that McDonalds is like a cancer on the American culture.\nAnyway, RIP to Michael Delligatti, the guy who invented the Big Mac and the Egg McMuffin. Can’t say I respect your business, because again, #DownWithMcDonalds, but I respect the hustle. Inventing two of the franchise’s most iconic sandwiches is definite hustle.\nvia USA Today :\nThe Pittsburgh-area McDonald’s franchisee who created the Big Mac nearly 50 years ago has died.

Delligatti, the Pittsburgh-area McDonald's franchisee who created the Big Mac in 1967, has died. He was 98. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar, File) \nPITTSBURGH (AP) — You probably haven't heard his name, but you likely have devoured his creation: two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, on a sesame seed bun. \nMichael James \"Jim\" Delligatti, the McDonald's franchisee who created the Big Mac nearly 50 years ago, died Monday at home in Pittsburgh surrounded by his family, family spokeswoman Kerry Ford said Wednesday. Delligatti was 98. \nUntil his health trailed off the last couple of years, Delligatti ate at least one 540-calorie Big Mac a week, his son Michael said. \nDelligatti's franchise was based in Uniontown, not far from Pittsburgh, when he invented the chain's signature burger in 1967 after deciding customers wanted a bigger sandwich. \nMichael Delligatti said McDonald's executives told his father he could experiment with a bigger burger but only using products the restaurant already stocked. \n\"He was often asked why he named it the Big Mac, and he said because Big Mc sounded too funny,\" Delligatti said. \nJim Delligatti told The Associated Press in 2006 that McDonald's resisted the idea at first because its simple lineup of hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries and shakes was selling well. \n\"They figured, why go to something else if (the original menu) was working so well?\" Delligatti said then. \"But it went over so well in Uniontown that we were allowed to bring it to two stores in Pittsburgh for a couple of weeks.\" \nDemand exploded as Delligatti's sandwich spread to the rest of his 47 stores in Pennsylvania and was added to the chain's national menu in 1968. \nMcDonald's has sold billions of Big Macs since then, in more than 100 countries. When the burger turned 40, McDonald's estimated it was selling 550 million Big Macs a year, or roughly 17 every second. \n\"Delligatti was a legendary franchisee within McDonald's system who made a lasting impression on our brand,\" the Oak Brook, Illinois-based company said Wednesday in a statement. The Big Mac \"has become an iconic sandwich enjoyed by many around the world.\" \nAnn Dugan, a former assistant dean of the University of Pittsburgh's Katz School of Business and an expert on business franchises, said Jim Delligatti's genius was simple: He listened to customers who wanted a bigger burger. \n\"In franchising, there's always this set playbook and you have to follow it. Jim saw an opportunity to go outside the playbook because he knew the customer,\" Dugan said. \"He persevered and (McDonald's) listened, and the rest is history.\" \nDelligatti headed M&J Management, a four-generation family business and McDonald's franchise organization for more than 60 years. He opened his first McDonald's in Pittsburgh's North Hills suburbs in 1957. In 1979, he co-founded Pittsburgh's Ronald McDonald House, then the seventh such facility in the country, where families can stay when children travel to Pittsburgh for life-saving medical care, and he was involved in several other charities. \nDelligatti also helped introduce breakfast service at McDonald's, developing the hotcakes and sausage meal to feed hungry steelworkers on their way home from overnight shifts in the mills, his family said. \nIn addition to his two sons, Jim Delligatti is survived by his wife, Ellie, five grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren. \nThe Devlin Funeral Home near Pittsburgh is handling visitation Thursday and Friday. Delligatti's funeral will be held Saturday at St. Joseph's Parish in O'Hara Township. Tags",

Michael “Jim” Delligatti was 98. \nMcDonald’s spokeswoman Kerry Ford confirmed that Delligatti died at home surrounded by his family on Monday night. \nDelligatti’s franchise was based in Uniontown when he invented the chain’s signature burger with two all-beef patties, “special sauce,” lettuce, cheese, pickles and onions on a sesame seed bun. \nDelligatti told The Associated Press in 2006 that Oak Brook, Illinois-based McDonald’s resisted the idea at first because its simple lineup of hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries and shakes was selling well. \nBut Delligatti wanted to offer a bigger burger and it went over so well it spread to the rest of Delligatti’s 47 stores, then went national in 1968.

      "text": "Creator of McDonald's flagship sandwich, the Big Mac, dies Posted: By JOE MANDAKAssociated Press \nPITTSBURGH (AP) - You probably don't know his name, but you've almost certainly devoured his creation: two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, on a sesame seed bun. \nMichael James \"Jim\" Delligatti, the McDonald's franchisee who created the Big Mac nearly 50 years ago and saw it become perhaps the best-known fast-food sandwich in the world, died Monday at home in Pittsburgh. Delligatti, who according to his son ate at least one 540-calorie Big Mac a week for decades, was 98. \nDelligatti's franchise was based in Uniontown, not far from Pittsburgh, when he invented the chain's signature burger in 1967 after deciding customers wanted a bigger sandwich. Demand exploded as Delligatti's sandwich spread to the rest of his 47 stores in Pennsylvania and was added to the chain's national menu in 1968. \n\"He was often asked why he named it the Big Mac, and he said because Big Mc sounded too funny,\" his son Michael Delligatti said. \nJim Delligatti told The Associated Press in 2006 that McDonald's resisted the idea at first because its simple lineup of hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries and shakes was selling well. \n\"They figured, why go to something else if (the original menu) was working so well?\" Delligatti said then. \nMcDonald's has sold billions of Big Macs since then, in more than 100 countries. When the burger turned 40, McDonald's estimated it was selling 550 million Big Macs a year, or roughly 17 every second. \n\"Delligatti was a legendary franchisee within McDonald's system who made a lasting impression on our brand,\" the Oak Brook, Illinois-based company said Wednesday in a statement. The Big Mac \"has become an iconic sandwich enjoyed by many around the world.\" \nAnn Dugan, a former assistant dean of the University of Pittsburgh's Katz School of Business and an expert on business franchises, said Jim Delligatti's genius was simple: He listened to customers who wanted a bigger burger. \n\"In franchising, there's always this set playbook and you have to follow it. Jim saw an opportunity to go outside the playbook because he knew the customer,\" Dugan said. \"He persevered and (McDonald's) listened, and the rest is history.\" \nDelligatti headed M&J Management, a four-generation family business and McDonald's franchise organization, for more than 60 years. He opened his first McDonald's in Pittsburgh's North Hills suburbs in 1957. In 1979, he co-founded Pittsburgh's Ronald McDonald House, then the seventh such facility in the country, where families can stay when children travel to Pittsburgh for life-saving medical care, and he was involved in several other charities. \nDelligatti also helped introduce breakfast service at McDonald's, developing the hotcakes and sausage meal to feed hungry steelworkers on their way home from overnight shifts in the mills, his family said. \nIn addition to his two sons, Jim Delligatti is survived by his wife, Ellie, five grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren. \nThe Devlin Funeral Home near Pittsburgh is handling visitation Thursday and Friday. Delligatti's funeral will be held Saturday at St. Joseph's Parish in O'Hara Township. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.   This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.

      "title": "Creator of McDonald’s flagship sandwich, the Big Mac, dies",
      "text": "PITTSBURGH (AP) — You probably don’t know his name, but you’ve almost certainly devoured his creation: two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, on a sesame-seed bun.\nMichael James “Jim” Delligatti, the McDonald’s franchisee who created the Big Mac nearly 50 years ago and saw it become perhaps the best-known fast-food sandwich in the world, died Monday at home in Pittsburgh. Delligatti, who according to his son ate at least one 540-calorie Big Mac a week for decades, was 98.\nDelligatti’s franchise was based in Uniontown, not far from Pittsburgh, when he invented the chain’s signature burger in 1967 after deciding customers wanted a bigger sandwich. Demand exploded as Delligatti’s sandwich spread to the rest of his 47 stores in Pennsylvania and was added to the chain’s national menu in 1968.\n“He was often asked why he named it the Big Mac, and he said because Big Mc sounded too funny,” his son Michael Delligatti said.\nJim Delligatti told The Associated Press in 2006 that McDonald’s resisted the idea at first because its simple lineup of hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries and shakes was selling well.\n“They figured, why go to something else if (the original menu) was working so well?” Delligatti said then.\nMcDonald’s has sold billions of Big Macs since then, in more than 100 countries. When the burger turned 40, McDonald’s estimated it was selling 550 million Big Macs a year, or roughly 17 every second. Delligatti received no payment or royalties for coming up with the burger, the company said.\n“Delligatti was a legendary franchisee within McDonald’s system who made a lasting impression on our brand,” the Oak Brook, Illinois-based company said Wednesday in a statement. The Big Mac “has become an iconic sandwich enjoyed by many around the world.”\nAnn Dugan, a former assistant dean of the University of Pittsburgh’s Katz School of Business and an expert on business franchises, said Jim Delligatti’s genius was simple: He listened to customers who wanted a bigger burger.\n“In franchising, there’s always this set playbook and you have to follow it. Jim saw an opportunity to go outside the playbook because he knew the customer,” Dugan said. “He persevered and (McDonald’s) listened, and the rest is history.”\nDelligatti headed M&J Management, a four-generation family business and McDonald’s franchise organization, for more than 60 years. He opened his first McDonald’s in Pittsburgh’s North Hills suburbs in 1957. In 1979, he co-founded Pittsburgh’s Ronald McDonald House, then the seventh such facility in the country, where families can stay when children travel to Pittsburgh for life-saving medical care, and he was involved in several other charities.\nDelligatti also helped introduce breakfast service at McDonald’s, developing the hotcakes and sausage meal to feed hungry steelworkers on their way home from overnight shifts in the mills, his family said.\nIn addition to his two sons, Jim Delligatti is survived by his wife, Ellie, five grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren.\nThe Devlin Funeral Home near Pittsburgh is handling visitation Thursday and Friday. Delligatti’s funeral will be held Saturday at St. Joseph’s Parish in O’Hara Township.",

      "title": "Creator of McDonald’s flagship sandwich, the Big Mac, dies",
      "text": "PITTSBURGH (AP) — You probably don’t know his name, but you’ve almost certainly devoured his creation: two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, on a sesame seed bun.\nMichael James “Jim” Delligatti, the McDonald’s franchisee who created the Big Mac nearly 50 years ago and saw it become perhaps the best-known fast-food sandwich in the world, died Monday at home in Pittsburgh. Delligatti, who according to his son ate at least one 540-calorie Big Mac a week for decades, was 98.\nDelligatti’s franchise was based in Uniontown, not far from Pittsburgh, when he invented the chain’s signature burger in 1967 after deciding customers wanted a bigger sandwich. Demand exploded as Delligatti’s sandwich spread to the rest of his 47 stores in Pennsylvania and was added to the chain’s national menu in 1968.\n“He was often asked why he named it the Big Mac, and he said because Big Mc sounded too funny,” his son Michael Delligatti said.\nJim Delligatti told The Associated Press in 2006 that McDonald’s resisted the idea at first because its simple lineup of hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries and shakes was selling well.\n“They figured, why go to something else if (the original menu) was working so well?” Delligatti said then.\nMcDonald’s has sold billions of Big Macs since then, in more than 100 countries. When the burger turned 40, McDonald’s estimated it was selling 550 million Big Macs a year, or roughly 17 every second. Delligatti received no payment or royalties for coming up with the burger, the company said.\n“Delligatti was a legendary franchisee within McDonald’s system who made a lasting impression on our brand,” the Oak Brook, Illinois-based company said Wednesday in a statement. The Big Mac “has become an iconic sandwich enjoyed by many around the world.”\nAnn Dugan, a former assistant dean of the University of Pittsburgh’s Katz School of Business and an expert on business franchises, said Jim Delligatti’s genius was simple: He listened to customers who wanted a bigger burger.\n“In franchising, there’s always this set playbook and you have to follow it. Jim saw an opportunity to go outside the playbook because he knew the customer,” Dugan said. “He persevered and (McDonald’s) listened, and the rest is history.”\nDelligatti headed M&J Management, a four-generation family business and McDonald’s franchise organization, for more than 60 years. He opened his first McDonald’s in Pittsburgh’s North Hills suburbs in 1957. In 1979, he co-founded Pittsburgh’s Ronald McDonald House, then the seventh such facility in the country, where families can stay when children travel to Pittsburgh for life-saving medical care, and he was involved in several other charities.\nDelligatti also helped introduce breakfast service at McDonald’s, developing the hotcakes and sausage meal to feed hungry steelworkers on their way home from overnight shifts in the mills, his family said.\nIn addition to his two sons, Jim Delligatti is survived by his wife, Ellie, five grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren.\nThe Devlin Funeral Home near Pittsburgh is handling visitation Thursday and Friday. Delligatti’s funeral will be held Saturday at St. Joseph’s Parish in O’Hara Township.",

      "text": "Big Mac Inventor Dies at 98 Franchisee Jim Delligatti created McDonald’s most iconic burger in 1968 Frédéric Bisson/Flickr The creator of the most iconic menu item from America’s most iconic fast-food chain has died: The AP reports Michael “Jim” Delligatti, who invented McDonald’s Big Mac in 1968, died at his Pittsburgh home on Monday night. Delligatti created the Big Mac in 1968 in response to customers who wanted a bigger burger; after it became a hit at his 47 stores, McDonald’s eventually decided to roll it out company-wide. Thanks to an earworm jingle that debuted in 1974 , the Big Mac recipe is known far and wide: two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions on a sesame seed bun. The burger, which clocks in at 540 calories, is served in more than 100 countries. Though it’s called “secret sauce,” the recipe for Big Mac sauce is widely available : It consists of mayo, relish, and mustard anointed with seasonings including garlic powder and paprika. Nonetheless, that hasn’t stopped die-hard fans from paying insane prices for it on eBay . In 2007 McDonald’s estimated 550 million Big Macs were sold worldwide each day , and that number has almost certainly grown since then. The company is doing its best to capitalize on the Big Mac’s long-running success as of late, testing both mini and maxi versions (called the Mac Jr. and the Grand Mac, respectively).",

      "text": "Nov 30, 1:19 PM EST Creator of McDonald's flagship sandwich, the Big Mac, dies By JOE MANDAK Associated Press AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar PITTSBURGH (AP) -- You probably don't know his name, but you've almost certainly devoured his creation: two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, on a sesame seed bun. Michael James \"Jim\" Delligatti, the McDonald's franchisee who created the Big Mac nearly 50 years ago and saw it become perhaps the best-known fast-food sandwich in the world, died Monday at home in Pittsburgh. Delligatti, who according to his son ate at least one 540-calorie Big Mac a week for decades, was 98. Delligatti's franchise was based in Uniontown, not far from Pittsburgh, when he invented the chain's signature burger in 1967 after deciding customers wanted a bigger sandwich. Demand exploded as Delligatti's sandwich spread to the rest of his 47 stores in Pennsylvania and was added to the chain's national menu in 1968. \"He was often asked why he named it the Big Mac, and he said because Big Mc sounded too funny,\" his son Michael Delligatti said. Jim Delligatti told The Associated Press in 2006 that McDonald's resisted the idea at first because its simple lineup of hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries and shakes was selling well. \"They figured, why go to something else if (the original menu) was working so well?\" Delligatti said then. McDonald's has sold billions of Big Macs since then, in more than 100 countries. When the burger turned 40, McDonald's estimated it was selling 550 million Big Macs a year, or roughly 17 every second. Delligatti received no payment or royalties for coming up with the burger, the company said. \"Delligatti was a legendary franchisee within McDonald's system who made a lasting impression on our brand,\" the Oak Brook, Illinois-based company said Wednesday in a statement. The Big Mac \"has become an iconic sandwich enjoyed by many around the world.\" Ann Dugan, a former assistant dean of the University of Pittsburgh's Katz School of Business and an expert on business franchises, said Jim Delligatti's genius was simple: He listened to customers who wanted a bigger burger. \"In franchising, there's always this set playbook and you have to follow it. Jim saw an opportunity to go outside the playbook because he knew the customer,\" Dugan said. \"He persevered and (McDonald's) listened, and the rest is history.\" Delligatti headed M&J Management, a four-generation family business and McDonald's franchise organization, for more than 60 years. He opened his first McDonald's in Pittsburgh's North Hills suburbs in 1957. In 1979, he co-founded Pittsburgh's Ronald McDonald House, then the seventh such facility in the country, where families can stay when children travel to Pittsburgh for life-saving medical care, and he was involved in several other charities. Delligatti also helped introduce breakfast service at McDonald's, developing the hotcakes and sausage meal to feed hungry steelworkers on their way home from overnight shifts in the mills, his family said. In addition to his two sons, Jim Delligatti is survived by his wife, Ellie, five grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren. The Devlin Funeral Home near Pittsburgh is handling visitation Thursday and Friday. Delligatti's funeral will be held Saturday at St. Joseph's Parish in O'Hara Township.",

Delligatti received no payment or royalties for coming up with the burger, the company said. \n\"Delligatti was a legendary franchisee within McDonald's system who made a lasting impression on our brand,\" the Oak Brook, Illinois-based company said Wednesday in a statement. The Big Mac \"has become an iconic sandwich enjoyed by many around the world.\" \nAnn Dugan, a former assistant dean of the University of Pittsburgh's Katz School of Business and an expert on business franchises, said Jim Delligatti's genius was simple: He listened to customers who wanted a bigger burger. \n\"In franchising, there's always this set playbook and you have to follow it. Jim saw an opportunity to go outside the playbook because he knew the customer,\" Dugan said. \"He persevered and (McDonald's) listened, and the rest is history.\" \nDelligatti headed M&J Management, a four-generation family business and McDonald's franchise organization, for more than 60 years. He opened his first McDonald's in Pittsburgh's North Hills suburbs in 1957. In 1979, he co-founded Pittsburgh's Ronald McDonald House, then the seventh such facility in the country, where families can stay when children travel to Pittsburgh for life-saving medical care, and he was involved in several other charities. \nDelligatti also helped introduce breakfast service at McDonald's, developing the hotcakes and sausage meal to feed hungry steelworkers on their way home from overnight shifts in the mills, his family said. \nIn addition to his two sons, Jim Delligatti is survived by his wife, Ellie, five grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren. \nThe Devlin Funeral Home near Pittsburgh is handling visitation Thursday and Friday. Delligatti's funeral will be held Saturday at St. Joseph's Parish in O'Hara Township. \n ",

      "text": "PITTSBURGH, Nov. 30 (UPI) -- Michael 'Jim' Delligatti, the Pittsburgh-area McDonald's franchisee who created the signature Big Mac hamburger, has died, company spokeswoman Kerry Ford said. He was 98.\nDelligatti, who said he came up with the idea for the Big Mac in 1965, died in his home in the Pittsburgh suburb of Fox Chapel on Monday while surrounded by family and friends, Ford said.\nDelligatti's family owns and operates 21 McDonald's restaurants in western Pennsylvania, including the outlet where in 1967 he first served the Big Mac in Uniontown, about 40 miles south of Pittsburgh.\nIn 1968, McDonald's put the Big Mac on its national menu. The hamburger is made up of two beef patties, the mildly tangy Big Mac sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles and onions sandwiched between a three-layer sesame seed bun.\n\"Today, we celebrate the 98 inspirational years of Big Mac inventor, Michael 'Jim' Delligatti. Jim, we thank and will forever remember you,\" McDonald's said in a statement on Wednesday.\nThe Delligatti family in 2007 opened a McDonald's Big Mac Museum Restaurant in North Huntingdon. Delligatti is survived by his wife, Ellie, two sons, five grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren.\n  You can now download, watch Netflix shows offline Cyber Monday was biggest online sales day in history Non-union workers strike at Chicago's O'Hare airport",
