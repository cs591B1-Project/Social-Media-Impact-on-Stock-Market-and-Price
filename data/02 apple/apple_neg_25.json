      "title": "News Article or Interview Apple: To Design and Build iPhone in the US",
      "text": "Apple: To Design and Build iPhone in the US Report: Apple considering making iPhones in U.S. Eli Blumenthal , USA TODAY A worker inspects an iPhone at a final a.ssembly facility in Zhengzhou, China. Apple NEW YORK  An iPhone \"Designed in California\" and made in the USA? It could happen soon. Apple asked Asian-based manufacturers Foxconn and Pegatron in June to explore the possibility of manufacturing the popular smartphone in the U.S., according to a report in financial magazine Nikkei Asian Review, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter. Foxconn agreed to look into the possibility though Pegatron declined over concerns that the cost of doing so would be too high, the report said. The report comes one week after Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election. While on the campaign trail in January, then-candidate Trump warned he would try to force Apple into manufacturing its products in the U.S. Were going to get Apple to build their damn computers and things in this country instead of in other countries, he told a crowd a Liberty University in Lynchburg, Va. That isn't all. As a candidate, Trump also called for a boycott of Apple when it didn't cave to the FBI's request to hack the iPhone of one of the San Bernardino, Calif., shooters. Apple declined to comment on the report, though it provided a statement about its efforts in the U.S. Apple is responsible for creating more than 2 million jobs across the United States, from engineers, retail and call center employees to operations and delivery drivers,\" the company said, citing a jobs creation link on its website. \"We work with over 8,000 suppliers from coast to coast and are investing heavily in American jobs and innovation. Bringing iPhone manufacturing to the U.S. could be seen as a big win for the President-elect, though at exactly what cost remains to be seen. Market researcher IHS Markit said it costs roughly $225 to build the 32GB iPhone 7, the cheapest new model Apple makes. It retails for $649. Although it may not sound like a lot, the phone is $36.89 pricier than last year's iPhone 6S, and that is with IHS factoring in $5 for manufacturing costs. Foxconn has similarly expressed concerns over cost, including from chairman Terry Gou. One unnamed source told Nikkei magazine that \"making iPhones in the U.S. means the cost will more than double.\" There is also the risk of Chinese push-back. Amid concerns over Trump vow to impose a 45% tax on all Chinese imports, Chinese state-backed paper Global Times published an op-ed saying China would respond \"tit-for-tat,\" and that \"US auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback.\" If Apple does bring the iPhone to the U.S., it would not be the first product the company has manufactured domestically. While the company already builds a variety of parts for its iPhones, iPads, and Macs in the U.S., in 2013 the company notably announced that its updated Mac Pro computer would be a.ssembled in the U.S.",

      "text": "November 18 at 1:57 PM Follow @kansasalps\nAn iPhone 6, left, and an iPhone 6 Plus. (Paul Morris/Bloomberg News) Apple is offering a fix for some iPhones stricken with “touch disease,” a problem in which a flickering bar appears at the top of a device’s display and its touch screen stops responding.\nThe tech company will repair iPhone 6 Plus devices with the issue for $149, it announced Thursday.\nApple says it will contact people who have already paid the company or an authorized service provider to fix the problem and reimburse them for the price difference.\nThe problem is caused when devices are “dropped multiple times on a hard surface” and then face “further stress,” the company said.\nRepair tech site iFixit says the issue seems to be a design flaw: The placement of key touch-screen-related chips causes them to become dislodged “as the phone flexes or twists slightly during normal use,” the site said.\n“Touch disease” is also reported to affect regular iPhone 6 devices, but Apple did not immediately respond to an inquiry about whether it would be offering similar discounts on repairs for that model.\nIn August, three California customers launched a federal class-action suit against Apple over the issue. That lawsuit has since expanded , and another suit was filed in Utah . The lawsuits allege that the company knew about the problem but failed to offer repairs.\nNow, at least some customers can have the problem fixed — for a price.",

      "text": "Apple will fix ‘touch disease’ on the iPhone 6 Plus, but not for free Apple will fix ‘touch disease’ on the iPhone 6 Plus, but not for free By Joel Hruska   3:02 pm Comment \nFor the past few months, reports have covered the ‘ touch disease ‘ that renders Apple’s iPhone 6 and 6 Plus nonfunctional. Investigation into the problem revealed that Apple removed the underfill from the controller chips that govern touchscreen functionality. The underfill typically fills the gaps between solder balls that attach a chip to its motherboard and prevents the solder from cracking under normal wear and tear. Removing the underfill means that the solder itself is responsible for holding up under flexion — and when the chips start failing as a result, touch screens stop working. \nUp until this point, Apple has steadfastly refused to acknowledge the problem, even as independent analysis showed it was easily the largest issue causing device failures. Now, Apple has announced that it will offer a $149 repair option, but only for the iPhone 6 Plus. The touchscreen ICs. Photo by iFixit \nThe company has published a webpage to alert customers to the issue, but continues to pretend the flaw is entirely its own users’ fault. \nApple has determined that some iPhone 6 Plus devices may exhibit display flickering or Multi-Touch issues after being dropped multiple times on a hard surface and then incurring further stress on the device. \nIf your iPhone 6 Plus is exhibiting the symptoms noted above, is in working order, and the screen is not cracked or broken, Apple will repair your device for a service price of $149. \nApple will contact customers who may have paid for a service repair related to this issue either through Apple or an Apple Authorized Service Provider to arrange reimbursement. If you have not been contacted but paid for a repair that you believe was related to this issue, please contact Apple. \nThe reimbursement amount will equal the difference between the price you paid for the original service to your iPhone 6 Plus and the $149 service price. \nWhile we’re glad to see Apple formally offering repair and refunding the difference consumers may have already spent on the issue, it affects both the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus and not just the 6 Plus. It’s been known to occur even to devices that are kept in hard cases, and it isn’t the result of consumers mistreating their hardware. If Apple had used underfill or a metal plate to strengthen the phone, this issue wouldn’t happen — and given that Apple added such a plate in the iPhone 6s Plus, moved the touch ICs off the logic board, and went back to using underfill, it’s clear the company was fully aware that the original device had issues and simply chose not to address them. Ultimately, we’d prefer this program be free — similar repair programs in previous years have been. Apple really screwed this up. Tagged In",

The news about Soghoian, who worked at Apple for nearly 20 years, raised concern in the Mac community that Apple no longer was interested in automation features in macOS.\n\nMaybe the latest news from Apple will help ease the concerned. According to 9to5Mac, one of its readers sent an email to Apple Senior VP Craig Federighi about the future of macOS automation.

PlayStation Vue is also compatible with the Apple TV’s Siri Remote, but unfortunately the service won’t be integrated into the forthcoming TV app for discovery content across tvOS apps.\n\nPlayStation Vue lets viewers subscribe to smaller-sized TV packages, or mini-bundles, as well as add-on premium channels like HBO and live sports. You can stream from up to five devices at a time, and enjoy the perks of cloud DVR. The service starts at $30 or $40 a month depending on whether broadcast channels are available in your area. If you’re a current PS Vue subscriber, you can link your Apple TV device and start streaming immediately. New subscribers can’t join in-app, however, and will have to sign up online. \n\nTo read this article in full or to leave a comment, please click here",

Photo by CNET \nApple has a cure for iPhone 6 Plus devices with so-called touch disease, but it'll cost you. \nOn Thursday the tech giant launched a new repair program for the iPhone 6 Plus. Some iPhone 6 Plus devices may \"exhibit display flickering or Multi-Touch issues after being dropped multiple times on a hard surface,\" reads a support page . Apple will repair iPhones with those symptoms -- assuming they're still in working order and don't have a cracked screen -- for $149. \nCustomers who paid more than $149 to get their iPhone 6 Plus repaired before this new program can get the difference reimbursed by Apple. \nThe issues were first widely reported back in August by tech site iFixit, which dubbed the problem touch disease. It's said to affect last-generation iPhones and manifest itself as \"a gray, flickering bar at the top of the display and an unresponsive touchscreen.\" Since then, customers have filed multiple lawsuits over Apple's handling of the malfunction. \nApple declined to comment beyond the support page. \nThe new repair program applies only to the iPhone 6 Plus.

Got iPhone touch disease? Apple will fix it - for a price Andrea Peterson Twitter \nApple is offering a fix for some iPhones stricken with “touch disease,” a problem in which a flickering bar appears at the top of a device’s display and its touch screen stops responding. \nThe tech company will repair iPhone 6 Plus devices with the issue for $149, it announced this week. \nApple says it will contact people who have already paid the company or an authorized service provider to fix the problem and reimburse them for the price difference. \nThe problem is caused when devices are “dropped multiple times on a hard surface” and then face “further stress,” the company said. \nRepair tech site iFixit says the issue seems to be a design flaw: The placement of key touch-screen-related chips causes them to become dislodged “as the phone flexes or twists slightly during normal use,” the site said. \n“Touch disease” is also reported to affect regular iPhone 6 devices, but Apple did not immediately respond to an inquiry about whether it would be offering similar discounts on repairs for that model. \nIn August, three California customers launched a federal class-action suit against Apple over the issue. That lawsuit has since expanded, and another suit was filed in Utah. The lawsuits allege that the company knew about the problem but failed to offer repairs. \nNow, at least some customers can have the problem fixed – for a price.   1:06 p.m.",

      "text": "SAN FRANCISCO — Apple is recognizing that “Touch Disease” is a thing.\nThe tech company is rolling out a repair program to fix iPhone 6 Plus devices with unresponsive touchscreen features.\nThe term “Touch Disease” refers to the touchscreen issues that surface after the phone undergoes stress, like being dropped on the floor several times. In many cases, iPhone users have complained the touchscreen will entirely stop working for several months.\nIn August, repair site iFixit discovered that the issue stemmed from faulty chips inside the devices. When the phone is dropped or bent, the chips become loose. At the time, iFixit called the issue “Touch Disease” — and it was quickly adopted by the internet.\nNow, the company is willing to repair affected devices for $149 — as long as your screen isn’t cracked and the phone is in working order.\nApple said on its website it “determined that some iPhone 6 Plus devices may exhibit display flickering or multi-touch issues after being dropped multiple times on a hard surface and then incurring further stress on the device.”\nAlthough some iPhone 6 users have also reported the issue, Apple’s fix only applies to the larger-sized iPhone 6 Plus.\nThe company added it will reimburse people if they already fixed devices through Apple service providers for more than $149.\nFollowing widespread reports of the problem, “Touch Disease” — on both sizes of the iPhone 6 — has accounted for up to 22% of repairs at Apple Stores, according to tech site Apple Insider.\nApple is facing class action lawsuits in California, Utah, and Canada over “Touch Disease.” The complaints allege Apple knew about the faulty touchscreens and didn’t do anything about it.\nThese cases are not yet resolved.",

      "text": "PlayStation Vue is now available on Apple TV Sony brings its TV streaming service to \"one of the most highly requested devices by our fans.\" Staff Writer, Macworld | Nov 18, 2016 11:25 AM PT Email a friend Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry Apple flirts with, but doesn't commit to touchscreen \nIt looks like Apple’s new TV strategy is moving along nicely. \nThis week, Sony announced that it was bringing its TV streaming service, PlayStation Vue, to Apple TV (4th generation). PlayStation Vue is also compatible with the Apple TV’s Siri Remote, but unfortunately the service won’t be integrated into the forthcoming TV app for discovery content across tvOS apps. \nPlayStation Vue lets viewers subscribe to smaller-sized TV packages, or mini-bundles, as well as add-on premium channels like HBO and live sports. You can stream from up to five devices at a time, and enjoy the perks of cloud DVR. The service starts at $30 or $40 a month depending on whether broadcast channels are available in your area. If you’re a current PS Vue subscriber, you can link your Apple TV device and start streaming immediately. New subscribers can’t join in-app, however, and will have to sign up online . PlayStation Vue \nThis was probably done by Sony so that it didn’t have to cough up the 30 percent commission Apple charges from all in-app subscriptions. But maybe that will change in the near future as Apple prepares to lower its cut to 15 percent. That might convince Sony to let Apple TV owners subscribe to PS Vue directly, as well as integrate its streaming service into Apple’s new TV app (which is the reason why Apple is lowering its cut in the first place). \nIf you own a fourth-generation Apple TV, you can now sign up to PlayStation Vue online even if you don’t own a PS3 or PS4 console. Currently, PS Vue is also available for iOS, Android, Android TV, Amazon Fire TV, Roku, and Chromecast. \nWhy this matters: It wasn’t long ago that we were expecting Apple to unveil a Vue-like TV service of its own. But now, it looks like we won’t be tuning in to a Cupertino-wrangled service anytime soon. Instead, bringing PlayStation Vue to the Apple TV falls in line with Apple’s new strategy when it comes to television—offering a best-in-class streaming box that works with all the other streaming services. Earlier this year, Apple welcomed Sling TV’s mini-bundles to Apple TV. Sling TV’s offerings are very similar to PS Vue, except it offers fewer channels at a lower price.

      "text": "Apple Blames iPhone 'Touch Disease' on Clumsy Users But it'll fix the problem...for a price By Michael Harthorne , Newser Staff Posted Nov 18, 2016 12:52 PM CST Apple is willing to fix your broken iPhone 6 Pluses...for a price. (AP Photo/Rogelio V. Solis, File) (Newser) – While they aren't exploding like a certain other smartphone , Apple's iPhone 6s and 6 Pluses have come down with what iFixit calls Touch Disease . As PC World reports, Touch Disease manifests as a flickering gray bar and nonfunctional touchscreen. Phones get Touch Disease \"after being dropped multiple times on a hard surface and then incurring further stress on the device,\" according to Apple , which is offering to fix the problem—in iPhone 6 Pluses anyway—for $149. But a source at Apple Genius tells iFixit they aren't actually repairing the broken phones, just replacing them with refurbished ones. And iFixit notes that's \"a lot of money for [a] device swap.\" Furthermore, iFixit claims the problem isn't just from clumsy phone owners—though that's certainly part of it—but an inherent flaw with the way the phones are designed and manufactured. iPhone 6s and 6 Pluses are so wide and thin that stress placed on them can cause certain microchips to lose their connections with the motherboard. iFixit says Touch Disease has been found in phones that haven't been dropped or that are ensconced in protective cases. Lawyers proposed a class-action lawsuit against Apple in relation to Touch Disease back in August, and litigation is still working its way through the system.

      "text": "How about that! First Ford, now Apple, gets the message from the strong horse:\nCould Apple start making iPhones in the United States? According to a report from the Nikkei Asian Review , the Cupertino, California-based company requested that Foxconn and the other iPhone manufacturer explore moving their smartphone production stateside.\n“Apple asked both Foxconn and Pegatron, the two iPhone assemblers, in June to look into making iPhones in the US,” a source told Nikkei. “Foxconn complied, while Pegatron declined to formulate such a plan due to cost concerns.”\nBut the change wouldn’t come cheaply, according to the report. “Making iPhones in the US means the cost will more than double,” Nikkei’s source said.\nNo kidding. But giving your customers job might be a handy work-around, even though the punters on Wall Street would no doubt hate it.\nPresident-elect Donald Trump has said he wants Apple to move manufacturing to the United States, and he has also called China a “currency manipulator” and said he would impose tough trade tariffs on their exports. A Chinese publication, the Global Times, recently warned that a trade war between the two countries would, among other things, harm iPhone sales in China.\n“US auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and US soybean and maize imports will be halted” should there be a 45 percent tariff on Chinese exports to America, the Global Times said. “China can also limit the number of Chinese students studying in the US.”\nGee, that's too damn bad. But, as Yogi Berra once said, \"predictions are hard, especially about the future.\"\nTechnology: What's It Doing to Our Stress Levels?\nhttps://pjmedia.com/trending/2016/11/18/apple-follows-the-election-returns-mulls-moving-some-iphone-production-to-u-s/",

      "text": "Comment The iPhone is just one of the products featured in Apple's new book. Maurizio Pesce/ Wikipedia \nApple just released a book that pays tribute to the last twenty years of the company's history and products. Designed By Apple In California has a lot in common with Apple's gadgets; it took more than eight years to finish it, it is bound in stark white linen, printed on special paper, and it has an exorbitant price tag. \nA Typical Apple Product \nThe book is about the last 20 years of the company's industrial design. Most of those years is under the helm of Steve Jobs, and people can just imagine the late CEO approving of the book. The book has 450 pages and it is made up of photographs shot by Andrew Zuckerman in the signature minimalist style of Apple. The book is filled with photos of iPhones, and Apple Watches, and Macbooks. But it also shows how some of these products are made. \nThere are photos of the tools used in creating the products and prototypes. It shows the journey of a product from being a concept, to a prototype, and finally to a working product that is ready for the consumers. \nJony Ive says that the book is more than just a documentation of Apple's design process. He says that it is an objective presentation of their work and of who they are. \nBut what makes the book a typical Apple product more than anything else is the price. The large version sells for $300, while the smaller one can be bought for $200. That's a bit pricey for a coffee-table book of pictures of gadget parts. \nBut aside from the price, the book has the typical Apple attention to detail. The bound pages are actually edged with silver, giving it an elegant look. The printing too is something else and the images are very clear and seem to jump out of the pages. \nThe photos by Zuckerman were very clear and has that minimalist style that has always been the mark of Apple since its resurgence. Some of the most eye-catching shots were the ones of the gadgets that were broken down to their components. There were pictures of the older Apple products like the colorful iMacs of the 90s. Towards the latter part of the book, the gadgets become more modern. \nThe book is going to be a bestseller for sure. With millions of Apple fans all over the world waiting to get their hands on their own copy even as they complain about the price.",

The German chipmaker is scheduled to report fourth quarter results on Wednesday. Forecasts are for sales of 6.5 billion euros, a 12% increase from a year prior. EBITDA is also expected to rise 27% to 1.7 billion euros. Analysts say the estimated growth is because of the demand from smartphone makers, especially after Apple saw strong iPhone 7 sales.

      "title": "These Celebrity Prayer Candles Are A True Blessing",
      "text": "Tweet \nSweet Gwyneth mother of Apple, you got to see these hilarious Celebrity Prayer Candles. They feature the faces of your favorite (and least favorite!) famous folks on traditional votive candles. Choose from all kinds of musicians, movie stars and characters, politicians, and other well-known icons. Each will set you back $15. True story: I have a set of Bob’s Burgers prayer candles. They are cool as hell, but they are not burger-scented as I had expected. 4/5 stars, because that was a missed opportunity. \nThanks to Deb for sending in the tip! You are a saint! We want to know all of your thoughts and feelings. Please share them in great detail below. More incredible things",

      "text": "Subscribe on YouTube\nHow many light bulbs were harmed in the making of Apple’s latest TV ad? A lot, by the looks of it.\nIt’s for the latest MacBook Pro, the one with the Touch Bar , a feature the company hopes will be enough to convince consumers that the hefty price tag for the revamped machine is worth every cent.\nAs for the ad, it’s an unusual one for Apple in that for the first 90 seconds of the 97-second sequence, the audience has no idea what it’s for. Or who it’s by.\nUnlike many of its other TV ads , there’s no minimalist setting, no narration, and, importantly, no Apple product. Instead we see an endless line of light bulbs exploding to Rossini’s rollicking William Tell Overture.\nMore: Apple’s new MacBook Pro has an OLED Touch Bar that changes with your apps\nOf course, there’s nothing wrong with unveiling the product at the very last moment when everyone has almost given up wondering what it is, after all, Apple did the very same thing when it kept everyone waiting years before finally revealing the latest Pro to the world in October\nThe new MacBook Pro ad is essentially a roller coaster ride through mankind’s greatest discoveries and inventions – steam power, flight, robotics, you get the idea. They even managed to squeeze a toilet roll in there. Oh, and there are loads of exploding light bulbs throughout, presumably symbolic of all the ideas that have helped shape our world through the ages.\nMore: Apple’s new MacBook Pro doesn’t outrun its competitors, but the Touch Bar is special\nIn the ad’s climactic moments we indeed learn that “ideas push the world forward.” We also discover that the new MacBook Pro – the one with the Touch Bar, not the cheaper one without – is the tool “for all the ideas to come.”\nThe ad ends with a light bulb. Exploding.\nMissing out on ‘Westworld?’ Watch online with these streaming services and devices Watch this hilarious ‘Apple engineer’ explain the MacBook Pro’s lack of ports Should you buy the affordable MacBook Air, or is the new MacBook Pro worth the price?",

      "text": "Reddit \nThe fact that iPhones are largely assembled in China has long been a topic of debate and, for some, a point of contention. If new reports are to be believed, there may come a day when iPhones are manufactured in the US. That’s according to Nikkei Asian Review, which spoke to unnamed sources who said that Apple has been in discussions with suppliers about the possibility of American manufacturing. \nAccording to these sources, Apple has asked both Foxconn and Pegatron, companies which assemble the iPhone, to look into the potentially making iPhones on US soil. Unfortunately, Pegatron declined to even look into US manufacturing, due to worries that the cost would be too high. No would said it would be easy to bring iPhone manufacturing to the US, we suppose. \nMore encouraging is the fact that Foxconn wasn’t as dismissive of the notion. Foxconn agreed to look into whether or not producing iPhones in the US is a viable move, so it’s nice to hear that company didn’t deny Apple’s request up front. Still, it sounds like Foxconn executives are doing this as a favor to Apple, one of i’s larger customers, and not necessarily because they’re excited about the idea of moving production to the States. \nThat’s because costs will undoubtedly rise if iPhones are manufactured in the United States. It’s unclear how much, exactly, those costs will rise, but one of Nikkei’s sources said that the expectation is that costs would “more than double.” \nAssuming that’s true, then American-made iPhones would likely come with a fairly significant mark up for consumers. While it may not seem likely that we’ll see US-made iPhones soon, this isn’t the first time Apple has brought up the possibility. The company has discussed manufacturing in the US over the years , and brought some Mac production the US back in 2013 . \nFoxconn has also reportedly considered US plants in the past , so it’s not as if this is an idea the two companies are just now beginning to consider. We’ll have to wait and see how everything shakes out, but even if Foxconn can be persuaded to put together iPhones in US-based plants, we probably won’t see such a transition for quite some time. Stay tuned.",

      "text": "Rumors surrounding Apple’s next-generation iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus have really started to heat up this week thanks to a string of reports from very reliable sources. First up was KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who is regularly a source of accurate intel surrounding Apple’s future plans. According to Kuo, Apple plans to release not two but three new iPhones in 2017 , but only one of them will be the hot new model with an OLED display. The other two phones will feature LCD displays just like the current iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, though additional details aren’t yet available. The analyst went on to explain  how the curved screen on the OLED iPhone 8 will be designed . Next up was Bloomberg , which rehashed parts of Kuo’s report but added that only one model will feature an OLED screen because suppliers still can’t produce them quickly enough to keep up with demand. Apple can’t even keep up with iPhone 7 Plus demand two months after releasing the phone, so adding another layer of complication would probably be a bad idea. Despite all of the leaks and rumors we’ve seen so far, we still really don’t have any idea of what the redesigned iPhone 8 will look like. Of course, that won’t stop people from creating gorgeous concept designs based on what we know so far.\nDON’T MISS:  Best Buy’s pre-Black Friday 2016 sale is live right now – here are the 20 best deals \nNext year’s new iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus (or iPhone 7s, iPhone 7s Plus and iPhone 8? iPhone Pro?) are expected to feature a stunning new design. Or, at least one of the new models is expected to feature a new design. The phone will reportedly sport a large OLED display that covers much more of the iPhone’s face than the current design, and the sides of the screen will apparently curve toward the back like the Galaxy S7 edge.\nWith that in mind, Apple fan blog called  iDropNews created a beautiful mockup of an all-screen iPhone 8 with curved edges and no home button. As you’ll recall, Apple is believed to be ditching the home button on the iPhone 8 and embedding a next-generation Touch ID fingerprint scanner beneath the display.\nNow, before we show you the mockup it’s important to note that the actual iPhone 8 won’t look anything like the design pictured here. It’s sleek, but it’s not rooted in reality. This mockup shows a phone with a screen that occupies the entirety of the iPhone 8’s face, from side to side and top to bottom. Unfortunately, there are too many technological issues standing in the way of a design like this right now, so it’s simply not going to happen in 2017.\nBut hey, we can still enjoy it and maybe even drool a little, right? A few images of the mockup follow below and the rest can be found on iDropNews .\nidn1 More idn2 More Read More idn3 More idn4 More Trending right now: \nApple acknowledges significant iPhone 6 Plus issue, but repairs won’t be free The exciting iPhone 8 is expected to do what the boring iPhone 7 can’t This is how Apple gets Netflix on its new TV app See the original version of this article on BGR.com",

      "title": "Apple might move iPhone production to the United States — but then costs could double",
      "text": "Apple — the eighth largest company in the world — is considering moving production of its flagship device back to the United States, according to a report from Nikkei Asian Review .\nAccording to Nikkei's unnamed sources, Apple has asked its two biggest assemblers, Foxconn and Pegatron, to look into moving the production of the 200 million iPhones they churn out each year to the U.S.\nPegatron immediately declined, one source told Nikkei , citing costs. Foxconn, who generates half of its sales through Apple contracts, obliged but was still pessimistic about what that would mean for production costs.\n\"Making iPhones in the U.S. means the cost will more than double,\" a source told Nikkei .\nYet supporters of President-elect Donald Trump were quick to cite the rumors as an early victory, given his tough talk about bringing jobs back to America. Trump said at a January address before Liberty University students that Apple should \"build their damn computers and things in this country.\"\nThey say that even Apple is talking about bringing iPhone manufacturing back to the US! The Force of Trump is strong! &lt;&lt;lightsaber sound&gt;&gt;\nTrump has done more for America in the space of ten days than Obama did in 8 years! President Trump will #MAGA! https://t.co/b7R0JX4ygN\nOne big problem is that higher costs could cause a big price hike on an already-expensive product. The latest iPhone model retails for $649 , and even CEO Tim Cook has suggested the phones might be too pricey right now for the company to break into certain consumer markets, like India.\nHigher production costs would not just be because labor is cheaper in China than in the U.S.\n\"In no other country can you scale up so quickly,\" said John Dulchinos, vice president of electronics supplier Jabil, to the Wall Street Journal . \"You have the ability to move quickly and there's a really strong electronics supply chain in Asia centered around China.\"\nIn other words, moving production back to the U.S. creates costly complications: The memory chips in Apple devices are made in South Korea, the displays are made in Japan, and the devices are assembled in China by companies based in Taiwa n.\nThat's why simply slapping a 45% tariff on Chinese imports isn't a magic wand that will suddenly make American manufacturing more competitive again.\nA scary consequence, in fact, could be a trade war — which China has already intimated is a possibility: An editorial from the state-backed Chinese newspaper, the Global Times , lays out the ways in which China might retaliate against tariffs.\n\"A batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus. U.S. auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback,\" the newspaper wrote. \"US soybean and maize imports will be halted. China can also limit the number of Chinese students studying in the U.S.\"\nDespite these issues, Trump supporters have taken recent headlines as a sign that Trump is already saving American jobs.\nTRUMP EFFECT: Ford says plant will not move to Mexico, will remain in Kentucky. Apple plans to manufacture more in USA too. #TrumpAlwaysWins\nNot only is celebration about Apple premature, but the belief that Trump is keeping car manufacturing jobs in the U.S. is also based on misinformation: On Thursday night, Trump bragged about convincing Ford to keep an auto manufacturing plant in Kentucky — but that factory reportedly had no intention of leaving in the first place.\nRepresentatives from Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

      "text": "Apple, Google organize, present your photos together ASSOCIATED PRESS Published on Nov. 19, 2016 \nCraig Federighi, Apple senior vice president of software engineering, speaks about photos in iOS 10 at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference in San Francisco. \nAssociated Press \nThis image shows a Google collage generated by machine using images of Binu Paulose playing with a dog. Apple and Google are both applying machine learning to organize pictures. \nASSOCIATED PRESS Print \nNEW YORK — If you’re like many people, you have thousands of photos on your phone, long forgotten after you’ve posted a few on Instagram or Facebook. \nThey don’t have to stay forgotten. Apple and Google are both applying “machine learning” to organize your pictures and video — and along the way, help you rediscover last year’s vacation or a dinner with close friends. \nApple’s tools are part of the recent iOS 10 system update. The Google Photos app for Apple and Android devices has a digital assistant to automatically organize these memories. \nHere’s a look at how they take you down memory lane: \nApple’s Memories \nApple’s new Memories feature automatically generates highlights around a theme, such as a trip or birthday party. \nIndividual photos and snippets from video are chosen for you, as is the music, though you can change it to reflect a different mood. \nThis isn’t just a slideshow. There’s slow zooming and panning, reminiscent of Ken Burns historical documentaries. Some of the photos also come to life, at least on newer iPhones that automatically take three seconds of video with every photo. \nWhen you’re ready to share, the app creates a standard movie file — so it works on Windows and Android devices, too. \nApple offers up to three new Memories a day. The machine-generated picks aren’t ones you might choose, but with a small amount of tweaking, they’re presentable. \nGoogle’s Assistant \nGoogle Photos has been at this longer and offers more types of packages. With collages, Google combines smaller versions of several shots into one layout. Animations combine a bunch of photos taken in succession so that they resemble a moving image. Unlike typical “GIF” animation files, Google applies its magic to align shots, so buildings and bridges look steady — without the shake common with handheld video. Google also offers albums and video highlights, though without the Ken Burns effect. \nGoogle’s Assistant generates much of this for you automatically. You can edit auto-generated albums and video highlights, but not collages or animation — although you can create your own from scratch. \nThe results vary in quality. I tend to take several shots of the same subject, just in case some are blurry. Most of my computer-generated creations are animations and collages. As with Apple, Google’s choices aren’t necessarily ones I’d make. But some are good enough that I look forward to alerts for new ones. \nSearching \nApple and Google are both getting better at image recognition. Apple’s version tends to be more conservative. While Apple found four photos in a search for fireworks, Google found dozens. Google also found more photos with hats, though one was actually a strange hairdo and a few were of a headband. Then again, Apple thought an illustration of a hut was a hat. \nGoogle is also bolder with face recognition. Its technology is smart enough to recognize the same child at 2 months and 6 years, while Apple often separates the same child into multiple identities. \nStorage \nTo free up space, both services will automatically clear photos from your phone after uploading them to the Internet, once you activate the option. You still have a lower-resolution version on the device and can get the sharper image anytime, as long as you’re online. Related Items:",

      "title": "iPhone vs. Android: 6 things the Android operating system can do that Apple’s iOS can’t",
      "text": "If design, price and die-hard brand loyalty aren't variables in picking a smartphone, then chances are function is the determining factor. In the battle of iPhone vs. Android operating systems, arguments can be made in favor of both. Consumers who want simplicity and a steady experience will likely value Apple 's iOS , while those who want more customization will likely lean toward Android.\nThe latest operating system for the iPhone is iOS 10, which is compatible on Apple phones and tablets, and the most recent OS version for Android is the Android Nougat. For those considering a device with an Android OS, here are six things an Android operating system can do that iPhone's OS cannot.\nMulti-window view\nThe new OS for Android features multi-window support, which allows the user to simultaneously run two apps side-by-side. This feature has previously been available on Samsung and LG handsets, but it's now available on all Android devices with the recent update.\n\"Now you can switch between apps with a double tap, and run two apps side- by-side,\" the Android Nougat website reads. \"So go ahead and watch a movie while texting, or read a recipe with your timer open.\"\nApple does offer multi-window support for its tablet users, but the feature is not currently available for iPhone users.\nVR support\nAndroid Nougat offers a virtual reality mode that can be used on devices compatible with Daydream , Google's virtual reality headset. Daydream?ready phones include Google's Pixel and Pixel XL, but are slated to expand to other devices.\nAndroid Nougat offers VR support. Source: Eric Risberg/AP Launchers Android's user interface is called Launcher — also called a skin — and it allows the user to customize their experience. The skins vary in themes and gives the phone a unique, custom feel with different icons, tools and enhanced functions. For those who like the sleek and simple feel of the iOS interface, Google's new Pixel Launcher offers the same vibe, though it's only compatible with a Google phone.\nPersonal Assistant\nApple has Siri and Android has Google Now . Android users who allow their device to gather data can reap some conveniences from their digital personal assistant like receiving directions to a recently searched destination. The Android 7.0 Nougat update for Pixel Phones features Google Assistant , which is more conversational, can entertain the user and make reservations. Those operating on Android 6.0 Marshmallow also have some perks like the Now on Tap feature, which provides information on what's on your screen, whether it be to get a movie review or details about a song.\nApp storage\nOn iPhones, apps are placed on the home screen of the device and can be organized into folders, while Android users have an \" app drawer \" to store apps and widgets. App shortcuts can be placed on the home screens. Users have the option to have a clean home screen with convenient functionality if that's what they want.\nWi-Fi information\nAndroid devices show the user what Wi-Fi network they're connected to up front — it is written out in small type just below the Wi-Fi icon. Apple owners have to go into settings to see what network they are using.",

      "title": "Apple Might Introduce OLED iPhones Earlier Than Expected",
      "text": "I've long anticipated that Apple ( NASDAQ:AAPL ) would completely transition its products from LCD to OLED displays. The process has already started with the Apple Watch and should continue with Apple's wildly popular iPhone line. And according to astute supply chain watchers, it's increasingly likely that the process will happen on iPhones sooner than expected.\nApple's latest iPhone 7 lineup, IMAGE SOURCE: APPLE, INC.\nPerspective is in order Around this time last year, multiple industry sources had already suggested that Apple was set to migrate its entire iPhone lineup from LCD to OLED. But given its massive unit shipment requirements, it was clear that sufficient manufacturing volume for the high-tech OLED displays wouldn't be available for all models until at least 2018.\nIn a recent note to clients, however, Barclays analysts Blayne Curtis and Chris Hemmelgarn cited supply-chain sources as stating that -- with the caveat that its designs aren't finalized -- Apple is set to reveal three new iPhones in 2017 for the iconic smartphone's 10-year anniversary. While the two smaller iPhones will probably stick to LCDs because of the aforementioned supply constraints, the largest Plus model will boast a 5.8-inch OLED display, allowing Apple to bend the display at its edges to create a curved, bezel-free design.\nOf course, a curved-edge iPhone isn't entirely surprising, considering Samsung has already revealed a similar feature with the OLED displays on its Galaxy Edge-series smartphones. Incidentally, Barclays also stated that the majority of these early iPhone OLED display panels will be provided by Samsung Display and LG Display , which together represent the two largest clients of another one of my personal favorite investments, OLED technologist Universal Display Corporation ( NASDAQ:OLED ) . This also corroborates reports detailing that such a supply agreement was struck between Samsung Display and Apple earlier this year.\nFor what it's worth, however, this isn't the first report suggesting that Apple will start with a single OLED iPhone next year. A few months ago, Universal Display shares hit an all-time high , after electronics equipment maker Applied Materials revealed a surprisingly strong quarter in which it received an incredible $700 million in display orders. Applied Materials later confirmed that the \"vast majority\" of those orders consisted of mobile OLED display equipment, while Bloomberg subsequently reported that the new OLED displays were set to make their way into Apple's lineup in 2017.\nIn any case, to have that assertion echoed by Barclays' comments this month serves as badly needed affirmation for skeptical investors.\nHere's how to invest All things considered, I'll reiterate my assertion that buying shares of Universal Display is the single best way to take advantage of Apple's transition to OLED.\nFor one thing, the reported Apple/Samsung supply agreement was rumored to last at least three years, indicating that Apple is invested in Universal Display's flagship OLED technology for the long haul.\nWhat's more, during Universal Display's most recent quarterly conference call earlier this month, CFO Sidney Rosenblatt made it clear that the company is preparing for accelerated growth next year by \"building our infrastructure to meet the growing needs of our expanding customer base.\" Sure enough, Universal Display shares shot higher just last week on reports that iPhone display supplier Japan Display is in talks to receive financing to shift its own manufacturing lines from LCD to OLED.\nThat's not to mention the prospect for Universal Display's OLED technology to continue to proliferate not only in smartphones, but also in tablets, televisions, and (over the longer term) differentiated lighting applications . For investors who buy now before the immense scale of Universal Display's growth story becomes evident, I think the stock's recent gains will prove a drop in the bucket compared with its long-term potential.",

      "text": "When President-elect Donald Trump commented on the campaign trail that he would get Apple ( AAPL ) to build its \"damn computers and things\" in the U.S. instead of overseas, it was widely regarded as a joke.\nHowever, prospects of an American-made iPhone are now being taken a bit more seriously.\nApple has reportedly asked iPhone assemblers Foxconn Technology ( FXCOF ) and Pegatron Corp. to explore manufacturing the smartphones in the U.S., according to sources who spoke to the Nikkei Asian Review .\nFoxconn and Pegatron produce more than 200 million iPhones annually out of their Chinese facilities. Apple is Foxconn's largest customer, accounting for more than 50% of its sales.\nWhile Foxconn is believed to be investigating the possibility of establishing U.S. production facilities, its Chairman Terry Gou remained wary about the rise in production costs, the Nikkei reports.\nThere are numerous arguments for why the iPhone shouldn't be made on U.S. shores. Critics argue that a transition would be more difficult than expected and that production costs would skyrocket, causing iPhones to become unaffordable.\nThe total cost of manufacturing the iPhone 7 with 32GB of memory is about $225, which then is sold at retail for about $649, according to research firm IHS Markit. If iPhone production were moved to the U.S., the retail price could potentially more than double, resulting in a major case of sticker shock for U.S. consumers, said Frost & Sullivan analyst Brent Iadarola.\nApple is a holding in Jim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS Charitable Trust Portfolio. Want to be alerted before Cramer buys or sells AAPL ? Learn more now .\n\"Labor costs alone would contribute to a price point that would shock consumers and put Apple in an adverse competitive position,\" Iadarola said in an email. \"...So despite the rhetoric, the 'end-to-end' iPhone will never be manufactured exclusively in the U.S.\"",

      "text": "Amazon.com ( AMZN ) and Apple ( AAPL ) managed to pull ahead Friday, despite the broader markets retracting. The online retailing behemoth advanced on talk that its Amazon Prime Video is planning an international expansion, while Apple edged ahead after disclosing plans to offer a fix its iPhone 6 Plus screens. Tesla Motors ( TSLA ) , however, lost ground after its closely watched shareholder vote to merge with SolarCity ( SCTY ) .\nAmazon.com, in a heated battle with rival Netflix ( NFLX ) , is reportedly interested in expanding its Amazon Prime Video service by enlarging the international markets that it serves. The online retailing behemoth currently operates its Prime video service in the U.S., U.K., Germany, Austria and Japan, however, it is looking at launching the service in 200 other countries and territories in the near future.\nAmazon Prime Video, which operates as a stand-alone business in the U.S., costs $8.99 per month, a tad less than Netflix's $9.99 tab.\nMeanwhile, Amazon is also beefing up for the crazy Cyber Monday, looking to also capture more online shoppers. The company launched a 20% discount to its Prime service annual membership, which offers such perks as free two-day shipping. The company's one-day discount lowers the annual membership to $79 from $99, with the discount expiring at midnight tonight.\nBoth moves helped spur its shares higher, with Amazon closing up 0.50 to $760.16.",

      "text": "November 18, 2016 , 11:20 PM Earlier this week, Apple dropped a new product in a very un-Apple way. The release wasn't preceded by months of speculation online and there was no big press conference to announce its arrival. There was just a lone press release touting what is (likely) the company's last product announcement of 2016 (unless we do see AirPods before the year is out). The lack of fanfare is due to the fact that unlike Apple's other major releases this year, this one is (drumroll please)...a book. No, not another new MacBook Pro . Just, a book. Photo: Courtesy Apple. Advertisement Designed by Apple in California is the coffee-table book that every major Apple-obsessed buyer will be getting for Christmas this year. It is big, white, and contains 450 photographs of Apple products through the ages. It is a beautiful, nostalgic look at the technology of yore, but the $199 and $299 price tags (depending on if you buy the small or large size) are hard to swallow. Especially when you consider that for a few hundred dollars more, you could get the new iPhone 7. Many have joked about the release , but none have done it quite so elegantly and in such spot-on Apple fashion as Stephen Colbert . The spoof, which mimics Apple ads that have appeared at the company's launch events, talks about the book's \"touch-page technology\" and \"no headphone jack design,\" which combine to make it \"the most advanced book\" Apple has ever made. Watch the full clip below for some weekend cheer. Advertisement",

(NASDAQ: AAPL )’s latest ad features all of these elements, and then some. “Ideas have always pushed the world forward. Introducing a tool for all the ideas to come. The new MacBook Pro,” it ends, suggesting this version of Steve Jobs’ laptop will be remembered as a revolutionary leap to the fore.\nAlthough the whole computer is shown, the ad emphasizes the new Touch Bar, a revolutionary input method, if you will.\nOf course, experts are questioning how revolutionary the new MacBook Pro really is. In a recent article, Express dubbed it “one of the most iconic laptops ever made.”\nAmong its pros, they listed: “Stunning Display, Touch Bar Brings A New Experience And Will Only Get Better, Awesome Force Touch Trackpad is Market-Leading.”\nCons, however, included: “Battery Life Could Be Better, Expensive, Missing Ports Will Frustrate Pro Users.”\nNow, check out What Goldman Sachs Liked About Apple's MacBook Event .\n ",

      "text": "Apple ( AAPL ) has instituted a repair program for iPhone 6 Plus phones whose touchscreens have gone haywire in a condition that third-party repair specialists have dubbed \"Touch Disease.\"\nThe malfunction occurs because the phone's touchscreen controller chips, which work by converting finger taps into data that the phone can interpret, aren't properly connected to the device's logic board. The design flaw causes the chips to wiggle loose and ultimately fail, according to Mashable . Users then lose the ability to navigate their devices.\nApple is a holding in Jim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS Charitable Trust Portfolio. Want to be alerted before Cramer buys or sells AAPL ? Learn more now .\nCupertino, Calif.-based Apple said in a statement on Thursday that phones with the problem \"may exhibit display flickering or Multi-Touch issues after being dropped multiple times on a hard surface and then incurring further stress on the device.\"\nApple will fix phones with the issue if the screen hasn't been cracked or broken. Customers can get help from participating centers like authorized service providers, retail stores and technical support for $149, but the program \"only applies to the iPhone 6 Plus,\" Apple said in a statement.\nThe company said it would reimburse customers who previously paid to have the \"touch disease\" fixed independently, paying the difference between the original service cost and the $149 fee Apple is currently charging.\nThis comes after Apple was sued by three iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus customers this summer over the problem. The class-action lawsuit, which was filed in federal court in San Jose, Calif., in August, alleged that \"the iPhones are not fit for the purpose of use as smartphones because of the touchscreen defect,\" Reuters reported.",

      "text": "Apple is planning to cut in half the amount it charges to sell video services over the App Store, a move seen as assuaging concerns of its partners, Bloomberg reported Wednesday.\nThe tech titan plans to reduce the amount of revenue it collects from subscription video streaming apps from the current 30 percent to 15 percent, Bloomberg reported, citing unidentified people familiar with the company's plans. Apple takes a 30 percent cut of sales for app subscriptions, but if an app maker holds onto a subscriber for a year or longer, Apple's cut will shrink to 15 percent.\nThe concession could go a long way toward soothing the feelings of partners, who have long accused Apple of using the App Store as a means for stifling rival services. The move also underscores the growing importance video is playing to Apple, which next month will launch a new TV app that showcases TV shows and movies from apps that a customer subscribes to.\nApple representatives did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n ",

      "text": "  iPhone 6 Plus Controversy: Apple fixes smartphone’s ‘Touch Disease’ with $149 repair fee Apple found a remedy to the iPhone 6 Plus defect known as ‘touch disease.’ But the giant brand wants the consumers to pay a ridiculous amount to avail the repair. By Fi Rozen , EnStars on Nov 19, 2016 12:16 AM EST Tag : Iphone 6 Plus , iPhone 6 Plus controversy , iPhone 6 Plus touch disease , apple , iPhone 6 Plus touch disease repair   A customer looks at the new Iphone 6 Plus at the launch of the new Apple iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 plus at the Apple Omotesando store on September 19, 2014 in Tokyo, Japan. (Photo : Getty Images/Chris McGrath) Advertisement \niPhone 6 Plus users are bugged by a defect when using the Apple smartphone model. Consumers made a call for a remedy on the flaw and Apple answered but alas! The repair comes with a hefty price tag. \nApple finally answered the 'touch disease' issue iPhone 6 Plus owners have complained about for months now. The gadgets giant brushed the problem off for quite some time even after a lawsuit was filed against them. \nApple's acknowledgement comes with a repair to fix the problem. On the other hand, the company refuses to admit that the issue is caused by design flaw or construction defect, Beta News reported. This is why if the iPhone 6 Plus manifests the 'touch disease,' the owner needs to pay $149 to have the gadget fixed. \nA statement by Apple mentioned that it has identified why certain units from the said model exhibit flickering display or multi-touch issues. It said that this happens \"after being dropped multiple times on a hard surface and then incurring further stress on the device.\" \nIt was also in the said statement that Apple informed its consumers to pay a service price of $149 if they want their devices repaired. This fee is actually far cheaper than what others whose phones are fixed out of warranty paid, which is $329. Apple, however, stated that they will reimburse the difference between the two prices if the owner had the iPhone 6 Plus repaired in an authorized service center or technician. \nApple's announcement was met with opposition, International Business Times noted. After all, the service price is too costly, leaving many displeased with the company. Also, the existing issue, said Kyle Wiens of iFixit, is due to design flaw. Wiens confirmed that many who have experienced the problem in their iPhone 6 Plus, did not drop their gadgets. He added that Apple could have handled the problem better so that consumers will have renewed confidence in the company. \nThe iFixit owner said, \"We appreciate the effort they're making but this program doesn't go nearly far enough.\" © 2016 Enstarz, All rights reserved.

They have decided that blaming their customers is the best way to deal with this issue and they will fix it for you, if you give them $150. Their justification is that this issue could only be caused by multiple drops onto hard surfaces, even if the screen has not cracked Apple has decreed that there is still damage being done internally and you need to pay to have it repaired. The Inquirer has a different solution , buy a different phone. That might be hard for some people to do, even if Apple devices are not as stable as the competition . \n\"Apple has determined that some iPhone 6 Plus devices may exhibit display flickering or Multi-Touch issues after being dropped multiple times on a hard surface and then incurring further stress on the device,\" said the Apple Multi-Touch programme information.\" \nHere is some more Tech News from around the web:",

      "title": "Apple iPad Pro, iPhone 7 available at a discount of up to Rs 28,900",
      "text": "  Here’s an irresistible offer for Apple fans. The smartphone giant is offering a range of discount on its iPad and latest iPhone models with Citibank cards. The discount is available to customers planning to buy both an iPhone 7 (or iPhone 7 Plus) and iPad. As per the offer, the company is offering a cashback of Rs 23,000 on combo of iPad Pro and any iPhone 7/7 Plus model. There’s a Rs 18,000 cashback for users purchasing iPad Air 2 with iPhone 7/7 Plus smartphone. On purchase of iPad Mini 2 and 4 models with iPhone 7/7 Plus smartphone, buyers can avail a discount of Rs 17,000. \nThe company is also offering in-store discounts of Rs 5900, Rs 2,900 and Rs 2,800 respectively on the above purchases. Customers need to buy both the devices from the same store on the same day. The offer is valid till December 31, 2016. \nAlso, a maximum of four transactions are allowed on every card. Of these, only two can be made in each month. Incidentally, the offer is not available for Citibank corporate credit cards. The cashback amount will be credited to customers’ accounts in or before 90 business days from the date of the transaction. The Cupertino giant is betting big on the Indian market. At the recent investor’s conference, post announcement of its quaterly results, Apple CEO Tim Cook said that the company is excited about its India investments. Cook said that the past year has seen iPhone sales growing at a fast clip in India. “Our iPhone sales in India were up over 50% in fiscal 2016 compared to the prior year, and we believe we’re just beginning to scratch the surface of this large and growing market opportunity,” he said. The Apple CEO further added that he is confident that he can turn India into as big an opportunity as China is for Apple. He emphasized that India’s “very, very young population” holds tremendous advantages for the company. “The truth is there’s going to be a lot of people there and a lot of people in the middle class that will really want a smartphone, and I think we can compete well for some percentage of those. And Given our starting point, even though we’ve been growing a lot, there’s a lot of headroom there in our mind. So, we’re working very hard to realize that opportunity,” Cook told mediamen and investors. Posted In:",

      "title": "Bitefruit Launches New Website That Makes Apple Products More Accessible",
      "text": "Bitefruit allows customers to purchase Apple products directly from the Apple store while applying discounts from the Bitefruit website.\n(PRWEB) November 17, 2016\nBitefruit , an online service where consumers can purchase Apple products at discounted prices, has recently launched their first website. On the new site, consumers can browse various items from the Apple store including iPhones and iPads, and buy them at discounted rates by using bitcoins. Unlike conventional online stores, the website does not sell products directly, and instead allows customers to save money by applying discounts unavailable in the Apple store.\nMaksym Zaremba, creator of the project, originally planned on creating a blog before moving in the direction of his current finished product.\n“I worked at [a] small Portuguese company as a programmer, and additionally was working remotely in setting up various advertising campaigns for different customers. In my spare time I was developing my fruit project,” says Zaremba. “I decided to start working with Apple products simply because their products do not require any additional advertising promotion, however, in the future I hope that my project will grow into a catalog of the most interesting devices that could be purchased at amazing prices and into a great community, where participants will exchange various information about the ways to save money when buying products.”\nProducts on Bitefruit are initially listed at full retail value and they eventually decrease until a customer decides to accept the new price and make a purchase. Discounts on Bitefruit are determined based on the website’s traffic; the more customers who choose to view product prices, the faster those prices are reduced. After a sale, product prices revert to their original prices, matching what is listed on the Apple store website, and the process starts again.\nBitefruit offers a simple and accessible method for finding products and conducting sales, allowing customers the convenience of making their full purchase solely on the Bitefruit website. After a customer selects an Apple product, Bitefruit makes the purchase for them through the Apple website while applying the Bitefruit discount that the customer agreed on.\nBitefruit decided to accept bitcoin payments due to their low transaction fees, which positively impact both the website and the website’s customers. When commission fees are low, Bitefruit is able to maximize discounted prices and offer these favorable prices to consumers.\nAbout Bitefruit\nBitefruit is an online store created by Maksym Zaremba that offers consumers a unique way of conducting Apple product purchases. Instead of selling products, Bitefruit creates product discounts based on the website’s activity and allows customers to apply these discounts to items from the Apple store website. Bitefruit accepts bitcoin payments and strives to create an accessible and enjoyable shopping experience. Zaremba’s goal is to expand Bitefruit into a larger catalog where customers can maximize their savings while still purchasing new items.\n //www.prweb.com/releases/bitefruit/promo/prweb13828210.htm\n ",

      "text": "Apple keeps iPhone call data in iCloud, but says it is for users' convenience Apple keeps iPhone call data in iCloud, but says it is for users' convenience Posted: Tags : iOS - iOS + Apple - Apple + This past week it was revealed from Russian software company Elcomsoft that Apple collects data from calls made on the iPhone. This includes calls made over cellular or those made using VoIP like Face Time, and third party messaging apps like Whats App and Skype. So where is the information stored? It is kept in iCloud, but only if the iPhone user has the feature enabled on his/her handset. But considering that most do, this is something that affects most users of Apple's iconic smartphone.The data that is stored includes the phone number, date and time of call, and the duration of the call. If the data isn't deleted from a particular iPhone, it will stay in iCloud for as long as four months. Invitation to a Face Time call can last as long as 30-days. Conversations are not part of the content that is stored in the cloud.Apple says that it keeps the data in the cloud to make it easier for users to return calls from any of their devices. The company recommends that those enabling iCloud on their iOS devices use a strong password to protect access to the service. \"We offer call history syncing as a convenience to our customers so that they can return calls from any of their devices. Device data is encrypted with a user’s passcode, and access to iCloud data including backups requires the user’s Apple ID and password. Apple recommends all customers select strong passwords and use two-factor authentication.\"-Apple spokesman Obviously, Apple doesn't want iPhone users to be concerned about this. Still, some device owners are worried about the tech titan decrypting iCloud data and throwing them under the bus when the cops come calling. If you can't shake this fear, disable iCloud on your iPhone.",

      "text": "Apple was the first company to integrate a voice-controlled virtual assistant into a smartphone’s operating system, although its main competitors such as Google, Amazon and Microsoft have since come up with similar solutions. Apple hasn’t stopped evolving Siri, however. In fact, a new discovery reveals that Apple is interested in bringing Siri to one of its best mobile products, iMessage, and further increasing the assistant’s capabilities. DON’T MISS:  Best Buy’s pre-Black Friday 2016 sale is live right now – here are the 20 best deals \nA patent application titled Virtual assistant in a communication session describes a Siri assistant of the future that would be able to respond to queries performed directly inside an iMessage chat, and then act accordingly.\napple-siri-imessage-patent-1 More If that sounds familiar, it’s because Google is already doing it in its Google Assistant, which is now available on its Pixel phones and the Google Home accessory.\nSome may say that Google surpassed Apple in this regard, but others will argue that Apple is falling behind simply because it wants to protect user privacy above all else. Products like Google Assistant need to tap into user data to be able to respond to commands and perform appropriate actions. To do so, Google decided against encrypting its newly released Allo messaging app by default, since the Assistant needs to communicate with Google’s servers.\napple-siri-imessage-patent-2 More On the other hand, iMessage is end-to-end encrypted by default, and it would be surprising to see Apple change the security setting all for the sake of bringing Siri to iMessage.\nThe patent does offer several clues that suggest user privacy and safety are still a top priority for Apple. For example, members of an iMessage chat would be notified that at least one party is using the Siri assistant, and it would offer to activate AI on their device. Users would also be able to approve or deny what personal data Siri can access during chats.\nHere’s a cool example of the direction Apple may be headed: Siri would ask permission to access location data in order to offer nearby restaurant suggestions to a group of people, and then it could make a reservation for them.\napple-siri-imessage-patent-3 More Read More One other interesting feature that Apple is working on is support for payments inside iMessage. And yes, Siri would be able to handle these peer-to-peer payments. This isn’t the rumored Apple Pay peer-to-peer payment feature, although it wouldn’t be surprising to see Apple Pay evolve. IN the case of this patent, Siri would detect what payment apps users have installed on their devices and then complete a financial transaction using a selected method. Touch ID would still be used to authenticate and secure payments.\nYou can already send PayPal payments to friends using Siri right now, but the feature isn’t integrated into Apple’s popular messaging platform.\napple-siri-imessage-patent-4 More As with all patents, it’s possible that these technologies may never see the light of day. But given Apple’s interest in both expanding Siri’s functionality and enriching the iMessage experience, we may see this type of integration hit iPhones, iPads and Macs very soon.\nTrending right now: \nThe best TV deals to watch for on Black Friday 2016 Massive Pokemon Go December update will reportedly bring Pokemon trading and PvP battles The exciting iPhone 8 is expected to do what the boring iPhone 7 can’t See the original version of this article on BGR.com",

      "text": "Apple Unveils $149 Fix For So-Called “Touch Disease,” Blames Users For Issue \nNovember 18, 2016 10:49 am EST By Ashlee Kieler @akieler It's really your fault iphone apple iphone 6 iphone 6 plus Touch Disease flaw repair program \nMonths after owners of iPhone 6 and 6 Plus devices began complaining that their devices were affected by the so-called “touch disease” flaw that effectively renders the devices useless when the touchscreen becomes unresponsive, Apple has unveiled a fix for the issue on the larger Plus phones — but it’ll cost you $149. \nApple rolled out the repair program Thursday placing the blame for the flaw solely on customers, noting that their devices have been “dropped multiple times on a hard surface” and then incurred “further stress on the device.” \nUnder the program, consumers whose phones are affected by the flaw but don’t have a cracked screen are eligible for the fix, which is available for five years after the phone is originally sold. \nCustomers who have already had their phones repaired by third-party technicians may be eligible for a reimbursement of the difference between that repair and Apple’s program. \nIt’s unclear whether Apple will eventually expand the program to cover the smaller iPhone 6. \nThose looking to take part in the repair program will have three options: they can take their phones to an Apple authorized service provider, an Apple retail store, or Apple Technical Support. Wireless carrier partners are not participating in the repair program. \nThe touch disease issue first came to light back in August, when iFixit reported that more and more owners of iPhone 6 and 6 Plus had seen their devices rendered useless. \nThe issue, which surfaces after a flickering gray bar appears atop the touchscreen, is apparently the result of Apple’s decision not to use a metal “shield” to protect chips that control the touchscreen. \nThese two chips translate your finger pressure into information the phone can use, iFixit reported about the flaw in August. When the chips go bad, they don’t register even the most forceful touch. \nWas this helpful? We’re a non-profit! You can get more stories like this in our twice weekly ad-free newsletter!

      "title": "Microsoft Surface Studio review: a beautiful invader of Apple's base",
      "text": "The heart of the Surface Studio is its 28-inch PixelSense display. It’s stunning to look at and it’s truly one of the best desktop monitors I’ve ever used. It makes things feel oddly lifelike because you can’t see the pixels — text, videos, and pictures just look great on this thing. You can even hold a piece of paper up to the screen and the Word documents shown on-screen will be the same size. The only way you could improve this monitor is if it was OLED like Lenovo’s ThinkPad X1 Yoga .\nThe Studio uses a 4500 x 3000 (192 dpi) resolution, primarily because it actually has a 3:2 aspect ratio. That’s really unusual for desktop monitors, but it matches the same ratio used on the Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book devices. I love extra vertical space for reading and writing, even if it takes a little getting used to on a display of this size. The display is glossy and reflective, but I didn't find that too troublesome in my own office space.\nThe Studio also doubles as a giant tablet This beautiful display also doubles as a giant tablet — sort of. The entire display is incredibly thin at just under 13mm, and supports touch and the same pressure-sensitive Surface Pens found on the Surface tablets. Microsoft is using what it calls a zero-gravity hinge to prop the display up, and you can push on the top of it with a single finger to move the display into various angles.\nEven though it’s easy to adjust, you can still touch or draw at any angle as it has some resistance to being pushed back. I found myself bizarrely pulling the entire display toward me and angling it underneath me to read articles online or even when I was writing because the display is just great to have up close.\nThe real party trick of the Surface Studio is its drawing board mode, and it’s also its biggest selling point. You can push the display all the way down to get really up close to it and start drawing. It won’t sit flat on a desk, though, as the minimum angle is the drawing board mode’s 20 degrees. Microsoft explained to me that it didn’t want people placing their coffee cups on the display and spilling them on a $3,000 PC while they’re drawing.\nThe Dial feels really natural to use To help with the drawing process, Microsoft is also releasing a new accessory: the Surface Dial ( $99 ). It’s a little puck-like device that’s powered by two (AAA) batteries, and it’s designed to be another form of input. You don’t even need a Surface Studio to use the Dial, as it works on any Windows 10 machine with Bluetooth, but it’s paired best with Microsoft’s new PC. Oddly, it's only bundled in the box with Surface Studio preorders, but Microsoft plans to sell it separately otherwise.\nI’ve been using the Dial in my left hand while I draw with my right, and it feels totally natural to use. You can tap on the top, crank the dial around, or tap and hold to access menus and controls. Most of the controls are radial menus that appear when you interact with the Dial. If you place it on top of the Surface Studio then it creates those menus directly under the Dial on the display, and they’ll follow the device wherever you place it.\nI have spent hours drawing with the Surface Studio display and the Dial. As a kid I used to love drawing, but as I got obsessed with building PCs as a teenager, I dropped my pencils in favor of gadgets. The Surface Studio has unexpectedly reignited my interest in drawing, and I’ve sat at my desk doodling away instead of watching TV for entertainment over the past week. As much fun as it’s been, I’m not going to spend $3,000 on a Surface Studio just to doodle in my free time. This device is really designed to go head-to-head with Wacom’s Cintiq displays , so I invited a real artist over to get a better idea of the Surface Studio’s capabilities.\n\"The Surface Studio is certainly the strongest contender so far.\" Lawrence Mann Lawrence Mann Lawrence Mann is a freelance illustrator who typically uses a four-year-old MacBook Pro and Wacom’s 27-inch Cintiq display to create his art at home, and a Surface Book on the go. Mann drew parts of two pieces for The Verge over a few hours with the Surface Studio, and came away generally impressed with the Studio.\n\"What astounds me is how close Microsoft have got their experience to what I have already carefully crafted with pieces from three different companies,\" says Mann, referring to his Cintiq, MacBook Pro, and Surface Book combination. Mann thought the accuracy and pen lag seemed comparable to Wacom’s Cintiq, but to be fully satisfied with the Studio he'd like to see some improvements elsewhere. He would like to have the ability to rotate the display, along with a more ergonomic stylus, and some extra buttons on the Dial for more than the basic controls.\n\"Because of the different technologies in use between Wacom and Surface, the Surface Studio does not suffer from the same cursor-to-stylus offset parallax that affects the Wacom Cintiq range,\" explains Mann. \"It’s something that has never been of major importance to me, but I know many others might find it important when they next open their wallet. The Studio’s offset parallax was virtually nothing.\"\nMann says the Studio has left him with a \"lot to think about\" in terms of opening his own wallet. \"I can safely say as a professional digital artist looking to upgrade my main device, the Surface Studio is certainly the strongest contender so far.\"\nApps like Sketchable are where the Surface Dial and Surface Pen really come to life. You can use the Dial to alter brush sizes, paint colors, or spin the canvas around without having to dig through menus and find the option you need. It’s a really quick way to adjust without having to use keyboard shortcuts or navigating away from your work with the pen. I prefer to use the Dial on top of the Surface Studio itself, but I did notice it doesn’t stick to the display very well. Even at the near-flat 20-degree drawing angle, the Dial gradually slipped down the display (perhaps because of oil marks left from using the touchscreen). I noticed it out of the corner of my eye when the radial menus kept bouncing down to keep up with the slipping dial, and it’s distracting and annoying.\nThe other disappointing aspect of the Dial is the lack of app support. There are nearly 20 apps on Microsoft’s official list, but even many of those just have basic zoom or scroll controls, or just the ability to adjust the system volume. Impressive Dial support can be found in Sketchable , Drawboard , or Mental Canvas, but I’m disappointed that apps like Photoshop don’t have full Dial support. Mann is equally surprised: \"I find it remarkable that Adobe haven’t already had all of their applications updated ready for this.\" Microsoft is going up against accessories like Wacom's Express Key Remote ( $99 ), so it needs to prove it's building an app ecosystem around the Dial here. It’s a slow start, but given Microsoft’s push with the Dial I’m quietly confident that most of the apps you’d want to use with it will include support soon.\nAside from the Studio’s creative assets, it’s a PC at heart. At the base of the display is where all the components are housed, in a box that looks like a miniature computer. On the model I was testing there’s a sixth-generation quad-core Intel Core i7 processor, 32GB of RAM, 2TB Rapid Hybrid Drive, and an Nvidia GeForce GTX 980M graphics card inside. That’s actually some old tech for such a futuristic-looking PC. Microsoft has opted for last year's Intel and Nvidia chips, and its storage isn't all solid state. This is especially tough to swallow on the GPU front, because Nvidia's 2016 Pascal architecture is miles ahead of its predecessors. Intel and Nvidia's latest chips simply weren’t ready in time for the Surface Studio, and the storage uses a mix of 128GB SSD with a 2TB hard disk drive. That's disappointing, because even a GTX 1060 would have pushed the Studio into VR gaming, something Microsoft is starting to support directly in Windows 10 .\nThis isn't a gaming PC, but it copes fairly well with games Despite these qualms, the Studio is still very capable. This isn’t designed as a gaming PC, but I found it coped well with games like Gears of War 4 or Forza Horizon 3 . You’re not going to be able to play either on the top settings, but they’re perfectly playable on the Studio if you don’t care about maxing out all the detail. Microsoft has even built in Xbox Wireless support — so you can use any Xbox One controller for games — and a Windows Hello-compatible 1080p camera so you can log into Windows 10 with just your face.\nApps like Photoshop are still super responsive, even if you’re working on files stored on the HDD. The 32GB of RAM will help with multitasking or when working on huge files that demand a lot of memory. And although my workload is relatively light, I wasn't able to overwhelm the Surface Studio at all even with games and multiple apps running side-by-side. Almost similar to most conventional PCs, you also get 4 USB 3.0 ports in total. Microsoft is still steering clear of USB-Type C, for now. Alongside the USB ports there's an SD card reader, headphone jack, and Mini DisplayPort for connecting up a second monitor. You can’t use this DisplayPort to use the Surface Studio as a monitor itself, though.\nAs this is an all-in-one PC, there are still some compromises with the Surface Studio. All of the ports are at the rear, which makes it hard to access them if you have the Studio placed against a wall. This isn’t a silent machine either, and the fan constantly hums away, with the volume depending on how much you’re doing with it. If you’re trying to run some games or process video then you’re going to start hearing it. It’s distracting if you’re used to silence, but it blends into the background otherwise.\nMost of the PC aspects of the Surface Studio are exactly what you’d expect from an all-in-one, and there’s very little to fault here. My main questions are around its price and uses cases. At a starting price of $2,999, it’s up there with Wacom’s 27-inch Cintiq ( $2,799 ), but for that extra $200 you’re getting a full PC and not just a monitor. For creatives, that’s a seriously tempting offer, but you’re really buying the Surface Studio because of its display. It’s stunning, and there’s nothing quite like it on the market right now that has this 3:2 aspect ratio, touch capabilities, and the Surface Pen support, all while being almost pixel perfect and super thin.\nIt’s an engineering marvel of a monitor, but I really wish Microsoft sold it separately. I want to dock my Surface Book to it, or transform any laptop into a full Surface Studio. If I’m investing in a desktop PC at this kind of price then I also really want to be able to upgrade it and use it for gaming and more powerful work. I can’t do either of those things with the Surface Studio. If this was a monitor with a powerful GPU in it designed to complement Microsoft’s existing Surface devices and \"upgrade\" them, I’d probably be throwing my wallet at my screen right now. It’s hard to do so knowing that I’m not getting the latest and greatest specs for that $2,999, and that’s before you even consider the top model I’ve been testing is $4,199.\nMicrosoft is doing what Apple refuses to do That doesn’t discount what Microsoft has attempted to do here. It’s truly something unique and a hint of real innovation we haven’t seen for some years with PCs. Others have tried to experiment, like HP's Sprout , but it's rare to see something more than just an all-in-one. Microsoft’s exciting Surface Studio unveil has been compared to Apple’s disappointing MacBook Pro launch , and with good reason. Many creatives I’ve spoken to about the Surface Studio have said the same thing: why isn’t Apple doing this? Apple seems to be forcing creatives to choose an iPad Pro for touch and pen, but the powerful and professional apps just aren’t there yet on iOS, and it’s not clear if companies like Adobe are willing to rewrite their software to be just as useful on an iPad Pro. Microsoft has realized the potential in the market to reach out to creatives who feel abandoned by Apple, and it’s an influential crowd that could be swayed over by devices like the Surface Studio.\nIt’s still a small part of the overall PC market, though. Creatives will have to weigh up whether this beautiful set of floating pixels is worth the price. If you're already in that price range and considering Wacom's Cintiq — and you don't need a really powerful machine — then the Surface Studio is a no-brainer. For many, the switch from macOS to Windows 10 could be the daunting part, and for others it will be the question of how many apps truly support this new way of working with the Dial.\nThe fact that Microsoft is even being considered an alternative to Apple’s line of machines for creatives is not something anyone, not even Microsoft, was expecting for the Surface devices. The Surface Studio won't take over Mac-focused design houses just yet, but that it’s even a possibility is remarkable. The Studio is special because it knows exactly what it is and who it’s for — and it’s largely spot on. If Microsoft keeps developing its strengths here, some of Apple's most loyal customers might well be tempted to switch camps.\nPhotography by James Bareham.\nVideo by Max Jeffrey and Phil Esposito.\nEdited by Dieter Bohn and Vlad Savov.\nMicrosoft Surface Studio 8.7 Verge Score Good Stuff: Stunning display with 3:2 aspect ratio Thin and handsome industrial design Pen, touchscreen, and Dial support Bad Stuff: Old CPU and GPU Can't use as a monitor Dial needs more apps and a better base Circuit Breaker These are some fancy iPhone corner protectors Circuit Breaker Get the Google Home speaker for $99 at Best Buy on Black Friday Circuit Breaker Daydream Nation View all stories in Circuit Breaker",

      "text": "playstation vue arrives on apple tv ( ) More Bill Roberson/Digital Trends\nSling TV has been available on the fourth-generation Apple TV since the latest update was announced at the company’s Worldwide Developers Conference event this past summer. Sony’s competing live TV streaming service, PlayStation Vue, has been conspicuously absent, however. That has finally changed, as Sony’s streaming service is finally coming to Apple’s streamer.\nDan Myers, PlayStation Vue head of product, announced the expansion to Apple TV in a blog post on Thursday. “As one of the most highly requested devices by our fans, the PlayStation Vue experience on Apple TV will provide viewers with a better option to watch your favorite live TV programming, with unique streaming features such as cloud DVR, simultaneous streaming, and no long-term contract commitments,” Myers wrote.\nMore: PlayStation Vue has finally come to Android TV devices; PC, Mac are next\nLike Sling TV, PlayStation Vue is only available on the fourth-generation Apple TV, but owners of older models are likely used to no longer getting new channels by now. Unlike PlayStation Vue’s app for Roku devices, it seems that the streaming service’s standard look and feel will remain intact on the Apple TV, though device-specific features like the Siri remote and touch navigation will mean some differences.\nplaystation-vue-apple-tv More If you’re already a PlayStation Vue subscriber, all you’ll need to do is download the app and link your account. If you’re a first-time subscriber, you won’t be able to subscribe right from the Apple TV. Instead, you’ll need access to a web browser so you can sign up and link your account on the PlayStation Vue website.\nMore: PlayStation Vue drops Viacom channels, adds BBC America, Vice, and NBA TV\nPlayStation Vue allows viewers to link their accounts on up to five devices, and simultaneously stream on all of them at once, including access to the service’s cloud-based DVR. Plans start at $30, though the base price is $40 if you’re in a location where channels from local network affiliates can be included in your package. Currently these cities include New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia, Dallas, San Francisco, and Miami.\nIf you’re not sure about the service but would like to try it out, a seven-day free trial is available. For more information or to subscribe, head to the PlayStation Vue website .\nPlayStation Vue has finally come to Android TV devices; PC, Mac are next It looks like it’s the end of the line for the third-generation Apple TV Are you a Sling TV customer with no local NBC affiliate? On-demand viewing is here",

      "text": "note chinese market share apple logo More It wouldn’t be unreasonable to assume that Samsung’s Galaxy Note 7 ordeal drove sales of its nearest competitor, Apple, to record heights. After all, that is what some analysts expected — research firm KGI Securities was especially bullish, projecting the Cupertino, California-based company would pick up an additional 5 million to 7 million orders in the third fiscal quarter of 2016. But that turned out to be far from the case. According to Gartner , Chinses brands like Huawei and Oppo gained the most from Samsung’s woes.\nImmediately following Samsung’s recall of the Note 7, Samsung’s third-quarter market share predictably fell from 23.6 percent to 19.2 percent, the biggest slide in the company’s history. Apple, surprisingly, followed suit: the iPhone maker saw a year-on-year dip in market share from 13 percent to 11.5 percent in Q3, its lowest since 2009. The fall was especially acute in U.S. and China, where sales of Apple devices declined by 8.5 and 31 percent, respectively. “The iPhone 7 struggled to simulate … sales” despite Samsung’s decision to recall the Note 7,” Gartner wrote in its report.\nMore: Apple sees first year-over-year revenue decline in 13 years on falling iPhone, Mac sales\nChinese smartphone brands, on the other hand, profited handsomely. Gartner reported that Oppo Electronics and BKK Electronics, Chinese companies based in the mainland, nearly doubled their market share in the third quarter. Sales from China made up 81 percent of Oppo’s profits and accounted for 89 percent of BKK’s, and furthermore, Chinese smartphone makers dominated China’s list of vendors in Q3. Huawei ended the quarter with 9.3 percent market share, Oppo with seven percent, and Vivo with 5.8 percent.\nThe news was not all bad for Apple, though. The company managed to ship 45.5 million iPhones, down only slightly from the 48 million it sold in Q3 2015. That happened despite sluggish overall sales in the country — shipments of Chinese smartphones rose one percent in the third quarter, to 362.9 million from 359.3 million in 2015’s third quarter. As 9to5Mac notes, Apple still captures more than 100 percent of all of the smartphone industry’s profits.\nMore: The iPhone 7 is about to hit a serious decline in demand, according to analyst\nStill, news of Apple’s continued struggles in China come as the company’s under pressure for declining growth. Sales of iPhones have slowed since the beginning of 2016 when Apple reported its first quarterly earnings decline in 13 years. The smartphone maker is betting on the holiday season to help jump-start sales of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus.\nApple's iPhone 7, 7 Plus sold spectacularly well in the U.K. and U.S. in September Apple’s iPhone nabbed 104 percent of smartphone industry profits this past quarter Apple and Samsung positively dominate smartphone profits worldwide",

      "text": "AirPods Release Date, Price Leaked: Apple might ship $159 wireless earphones on Nov. 30 By Staff Writer Nov 18, 2016 11:28 AM EST SAN FRANCISCO, CA - SEPTEMBER 07: Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing Phil Schiller announces AirPods during a launch event on September 7, 2016 in San Francisco, California. Apple Inc. is expected to unveil latest iterations of its smart phone, forecasted to be the iPhone 7. The tech giant is also rumored to be planning to announce an update to its Apple Watch wearable device. Advertisement \nApple's AirPods may be available sooner than techie fans have expected. According to new leak, the comopany's wireless earphones will be shipped by end of this month. \nA European reseller recently claims that Apple's $159 AirPods wireless headphones will start shipping right after the German authorized reseller, Conrad revealed to a customer that it would be kicking off AirPods on November 18. Advertisement \nAccording to Mac4Ever , a French retailer Fnac have also started the pre-order process of the wireless earphones and would start shipping on or around Wednesday of November 30, just in time for holiday shopping. \nDuring the Apple's September event, the AirPods were supposed to be launch in the late October. However, the company released a statement that they still need time before the gadget will be ready for the customers. \n\"The early response to AirPods has been incredible. We don't believe in shipping a product before it's ready, and we need a little more time before AirPods are available for our customers,\" Apple told TechCrunch. \nOne of the AppleInsider said that some of the Apple retail stores are already having their demo units and are now waiting for a word from Cupertino to start demonstrating the product. Earlier this week, there was information reported that the Czech retailer Alza had listed the device to launch in December 2016. Barclays also predicted that the production of the AirPods would begin in December which means that the earphones would not be available until 2017. Advertisement \nApple Company has also listed AirPods on its website for $159, but it was clearly marked that the earphones are still unavailable. The said wireless headset is equipped with a six-hour battery, but it was extended up to 24 hours before the battery inside needs recharging. \nIts accessory uses Apple's in-house designed W1 wireless chip which enables features like invoking Siri by double tapping one of the AirPods and zero-configuration pairing with multiple Apple devices through iCloud. © 2016 HNGN , All rights reserved.

      "text": "16 mins ago \nYou may someday have another participant in your group messaging chats: Siri. \nAn Apple patent application published Nov. 17 describes how Siri could be pulled into iMessage chats to help with scheduling and making payments. Any of the participants in a conversation can choose to bring in Siri to assist people with tasks, the filing with the US Patent and Trademark Office says . \nWhen summoned to a message thread, the AI assistant uses semantic analysis to decipher which messages are meant for it. Once users direct a message toward Siri, it will be able to carry out tasks like checking people’s availability on their respective calendars or estimate how far people are from each other by using their locations. In one instance, a user asks, “Siri, when are we all free to grab lunch?” and Siri responds by scouring their calendars for matching availabilities and presenting a poll of possible times. Siri iMessage integration patent. (USPTO) \nWith iOS 10, Apple announced Siri would support a myriad of third-party apps, including payment apps like Venmo, Paypal and Square Cash . In renderings included with the application, the outlined technology appears to allow for peer-to-peer payments from within the conversation. In an example, a participant says, “Siri, can you send Brett 10 bucks?” The assistant then pulls up a range of payment apps to choose from, and asks for fingerprint authorization before making the transfer. \nAt any given time, participants can choose to deny Siri access to their personal information. \nApple’s latest patent filing echoes functions already available in Google Assistant, which makes similar in-conversation contributions within Google’s text chat-only app Allo. Google Assistant’s functionality is more extensive than what’s described in the Apple patent, which only gives examples of scheduling and payments. Google Assistant can scour for addresses, movie showtimes, restaurants, flights, and hotels from within the app, as well as report on news, weather, traffic, sports, and more. \nThat said, it’s worth noting that Apple filed for this patent in April 2015, well before Google’s Assistant made its debut last month . And the trend toward using machine learning to help virtual assistants better serve users is on the upswing across the board: consider Amazon’s Alexa, Facebook Messenger bots, and Samsung’s acquisition of a Siri-like assistant called Viv . \nApple’s concept is still just a patent application, which is not an indication that the technology will be deployed—now or ever.

      "text": "Apple's iPhone & iPad Security Flaw Can Bypass Passcode & Fingerprint ID To Access Your Personal Information? By Ella Rozic , Parent Herald November 19, 03:14 am TAG iphone , ipad , apple , technology , gadgets , mobile , tablet , hacking NEW YORK, NY - SEPTEMBER 16: One of the first customers to buy a new iPhone walks out of an Apple store in Manhattan on September 16, 2016 in New York City. People around the globe waited in long lines to be among the first to purchase both the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus. The phones offer longer battery life, faster browsing, a better camera and do not have a traditional headphone jack. (Photo : Spencer Platt/Getty Images) \nYou create a unique passcode for your gadgets because the last thing you want is someone to get their hands on your gadgets and have the access to your personal info, photos, text messages, contacts, and email. Reports have it that If you are an Apple iPhone or an iPad user and owner, someone can do tricks your mobile or tablet and access your personal files. Advertisement \nWhat makes it possible? Ask Siri. \nThe process has several steps but it is fairly easy to do. First, the attacker or hacker needs to determine your mobile phone number and we all know that Siri would be happy to assist if you just ask for it. Another phone will call your iPhone and the hacker will not answer the call but instead send a custom text reply. \nInstead of entering a real message, Siri needs to be back in action as the hacker needs to enable your iPhone's VoiceOver feature. This will allow any user of your iPhone to interact with iOS. After that, it will just be a matter of tapping and clicking the right parts of the screen. iPhone Hack: Attackers Can See Private Information, Photos On Your Locked Screen Through New Flaw https://t.co/EyZW6zNiBu \n— John Obeto II (@johnobeto) November 19, 2016 \nSome might take few more tries to get on you iPhone or iPad but eventually, the iOS will respond with a pop-up icon next to the input area. This will allow your hacker to view your photos and contacts. \nThis can be done even on your iPad as long as it is synced with your apple ID and mobile number. Those units with iOS versions from 8.0 to 10.2, even with the passcode on your iPhone and iPads, are vulnerable to get hacked. \nAccording to reports , Apple has not answered to this flaw but until the company delivers a fix, you just have to disable Siri on the lock screen. All you have to do is go to Settings - General - Passcode Lock, and disable Siri. \nFor more tips on how to secure your iPhone or iPads from attackers and hackers, visit here .

This includes the usual British accent voice over that is meant to imitate Apple design chief Jony Ive, whose voice has become synonymous with the official videos.The video was supposed to be taking an in-depth look at the features on the new \"Designed by Apple in California\" photo book recently announced by the tech titan . While a book is about as low tech as could be, the Ive-esque voice opens the video by reciting previous Apple products that included \"book\" in its name. \"There was the iBook, the Mac Book, and now the most advanced book we've ever made. The Apple Book. Using the most innovative technology from 1440, we were able to take an experience that was instantly familiar and charge $300 for it.\"The best line though, came from a female engineer who we are led to believe worked on the project. \"Its touchpage technology allows you to simply swipe your finger on a page to turn it.\" And we are told that in order to make the Apple Book intuitive, its pages are sequential. What innovation!It's a nice job by The Late Show to capture the essence of an Apple release video. And you can watch it by clicking the clip found at the top of the story.",

      "text": "Apple is finally offering a cure for its iPhone 6 Plus models plagued by so-called \"touch disease.\" The affliction causes the phone's screen to freeze up and no longer respond to touch commands. The fix will cost American customers $149 US. Canadians will have to shell out $189.\nThe move follows months of customer complaints about touch disease and multiple proposed class action lawsuits filed against Apple over the issue.\nThe suits allege the California-based tech giant knew about the defect and failed to take action.\nBut while Apple is offering a fix, some customers are dismayed to discover the company is charging a fee and placing the blame on them.\n\"Apple has determined that some iPhone 6 Plus devices may exhibit display flickering or multi-touch issues,\" states the company on its website.\nThis problem, explains the company, arises after the phone has been dropped \"multiple times on a hard surface\" and then is subjected to \"further stress.\"\n'Pitiful' offer\n\"I think it's pitiful,\" says iPhone owner Trina Rae Wiegers from Prince Albert, Sask.\nShe claims that many smartphones get dropped, so if that's the culprit, lots of different iPhone models should be suffering from the same problem.\n\"You can't just pick one and say apparently people are just dropping the 6 Pluses.\"\nWiegers owns an iPhone 6, which she believes also suffers from touch disease. She says it periodically freezes up and becomes useless. \"You miss calls, you can't text, it's a horrible piece of crap.\"\nOther iPhone 6 customers have also complained of the same problem, but Apple is only offering to fix the bigger 6 Plus. CBC News asked the tech company why, but it did not address the question. \nEven if she could get the fix, Wiegers claims she would never pay $189. \"It's ridiculous,\" she says. \"It's their problem and they need to own up to it.\"\n$189 fee for show?\nWiegers is the lead plaintiff in a proposed Canadian class action lawsuit launched against Apple over touch disease. \nA total of four proposed class-actions have been filed, two in Canada and two in the U.S. involving both iPhone 6 and 6 Plus owners.\n\"It's a design defect, so to charge $189 to fix their problem is simply atrocious,\" claims Regina lawyer Tony Merchant, who's heading up the Canadian lawsuits.\nHe alleges both the 6 and 6 Plus were designed in a way that even the slightest bend results in a disconnect in the phone, causing the screen to no longer respond to touch. \nMerchant claims Apple came up with a fee for the fix not because it needed the cash but to create the impression touch disease is not its fault.\n\"Their motive is to maintain the pretense that they didn't design a defective phone,\" he alleges.\n\"What they ought to be doing is fixing all of [them] without charge and pay compensation to people who've lost the use of their phone.\"\nIn order to proceed, all four class actions must first be certified in court. Apple would not comment on the proposed suits. \nNot interested in the fix\nThe term \"touch disease\" was first coined by an online repair guide, iFixit. It posted a blog in August claiming that iPhone repair shops in the U.S. were being inundated with customers looking for fixes for the problem.\nAfter CBC News first reported on the issue, we heard from several customers who claim their phones are afflicted. They include Paul So from Toronto who took his iPhone 6 Plus to an Apple store last month. \nHe says the customer service rep acknowledged touch disease and explained it happened when the phone was bent.\nSo says he was told he'd have to pay $425 to replace the device because it's no longer under warranty. \nHe wasn't willing to pay that price and he's not keen to cough up $189 for a problem he too believes is Apple's fault. \"It's not right. They should acknowledge the fact they did make the mistake.\"\nYusuf Motiwala in Mississauga also doesn't plan to take Apple up on its offer. \"That's a lot of money,\" he says about the fee, estimating it would total about $200 with taxes. \"I don't think that's fair.\"\nRead More Motiwala's 19-year-old daughter, Hawwa bought a second-hand 6 Plus for $750 in February. By September, it started flickering and eventually stopped responding to touch altogether. \nMotiwala believes the $200 fee would be better used to help pay for a new phone for his daughter — one that's not an Apple product. \nAs for Wiegers, she's sticking with the proposed class action lawsuit and says she's still waiting for the day Apple fesses up and addresses her problem — at no charge. \n\"I just want them to fix my phone, that's all I want.\"\nCBC News asked Apple for a response to the customer criticisms. It would only confirm that it is indeed running a repair program for the iPhone 6 Plus. \nAs part of the program, customers who already paid to get their device fixed will be reimbursed — minus the mandatory $189 fee. \nPhones that have cracked or broken screens won't be eligible for the repair.",

      "text": "Apple Purposely Throttles Down Some iPhone 7 Data Speeds in the United States GO Verizon's iPhone 7 version should be faster than AT&T's Nov 19, 2016 03:28 GMT · By Andrei Vlad · Share: It's a common fact that Apples uses components from different suppliers with each iPhone the company launches, and this year's model is no exception. For example, in the United States, there are two different version of the iPhone 7 , but they're only different because they embed different components, not because one performs better than the other. Bloomberg reports that Verizon's iPhone 7 is equipped with a Qualcomm X12 modem, while the AT&T/T-Mobile version comes with an Intel XMM 3360. On paper, the Qualcomm X12 modem should perform much faster than the Intel XMM 3360. According the their specification, Qualcomm's latest X12 modem is capable of downloading data at up to 600 megabits per second, while the Intel modem can only reach up to 450 megabits per second. However, in reality, both modems are about the same when it comes to performance. Apparently Apple has decided to throttle down the Qualcomm X12 modem, as to not upset carriers and customers alike. A field test that put against each other the Galaxy S7 equipped with the Qualcomm X12 and the iPhone 7 with the same modem chip, showed that Samsung's smartphone was twice as fast on the same network. iPhone 7 Basically, we now have two iPhone 7 versions that perform the same, but one of them could be faster than the other if Apple would have enabled the full power of the Qualcomm X12 modem. Obviously, that's not going to happen since the Cupertino-based company has no intention of angering either AT&T or T-Mobile, as well as their customers in the United States, by making one of the iPhone 7 variants weaker than Verizon's model. Currently, there's a small performance different between the Verizon iPhone 7 and those from AT&T and T-Mobile (in favor of the former), but it's almost negligible. Apple refused to comment on the matter, though a spokeswoman did stated that “ every iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus meets or exceeds all of Apple's wireless performance standards, quality metrics, and reliability testing .” CHECK OUT THE GALLERY (2 Images)",

Since the launch of version 1.8 on October 17, 2016, the app has boasted an average user rating of 4.3 out of 5.0 stars and has consistently ranked among the Top 50 Paid Health and Fitness Apps in the US iTunes App Store.\nIrvine, California (PRWEB) November 17, 2016\nAutomated detection of sleep, a feature previously only available to purchasers of dedicated health and fitness trackers such as Fitbit or Jawbone, is now available to Apple Watch owners.\nSleep Watch by Bodymatter is the first and only sleep monitoring app for Apple Watch that lets users collect their sleep statistics without the need to open apps at bedtime or upon rising. The app automatically detects and monitors estimated sleep time, awake time, sleeping heart rate and sleep quality, but allows users to manually adjust their results to more accurately track their patterns.\nSince the launch of Sleep Watch version 1.8 on October 17, 2016, the app has boasted an average user rating of 4.3 out of 5.0 stars and has consistently ranked among the Top 50 Paid Health and Fitness Apps in the US iTunes App Store. Reception from Apple Watch owners continues to be extremely positive:\n“...I purchased the app and have been using nightly for about 10 days. This is one app that really takes advantage of the Watch and the first indispensable app I've found.”\njsamuels, MacRumors.com Forum, Nov 5, 2016\n“I was looking for sleep tracking as close to the automatic tracking of the Fitbit as I could find and with SleepWatch my search is over. It works well and allows you to adjust the times if they are not detected correctly, can't really expect much more on that front (certainly beats having to manually start and end)”\nhsafavi, App Store Review, Nov 2, 2016\n“Auto-tracking works great with continuous app updates. Best I've used so far, well worth the $.\"\nTiltasauras, App Store Review, Oct 25, 2016\nIn numerous amounts of research prepared by many renowned institutions, the importance of sleep regularly shows to be part of a healthy lifestyle, associated with the following potential benefits:\nImproved mood Better immune strength Better cardiovascular health Lower stress levels Improved memory Maintenance of a healthy weight or improved weight loss efforts Elevated energy levels during the day Increased creativity\nSleep Watch leverages the state-of-the-art motion and pulse sensors built into the Apple Watch to estimate when users are asleep by continually monitoring the heart rate and motion data provided by the Watch. Once set up, the app requires virtually no user intervention to detect sleep, aside from simply wearing the Watch to bed. Sleep Watch can also send daily sleep briefing notifications to users upon waking up in the morning. Sleep Watch also lets users automatically sync detected sleep times into the Apple Health app.\n“We believe that digital health applications and wearables have a bright future in helping users achieve positive health outcomes. We chose to focus on sleep for a first application as it plays a critical role in our overall health including our cardiovascular health. We are thrilled that the feedback from our users has been so positive and we look forward to continuing to improve the functionality of the application and to enhancing the performance of our sleep algorithms.” said Aaron Giroux, Executive Chairman of Bodymatter, Inc., creator of Sleep Watch.\nSleep Watch for Apple Watch and iPhone is $4.99 and available now to download in the App Store at https://itunes.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1138066420 .\nIf you are a journalist and would like to review the app, please contact press(at)bodymatter(dot)io.

      "text": "Apple to fix iPhone 6 Plus ‘touch disease’ for a fee   9:51 am Apple has started offering a service to fix a fault on iPhone 6 Plus phones known as “touch disease”. \nTouchscreens on smartphones that have this problem gradually become unresponsive. \nThe fault was highlighted by gadget sites which said it was caused by a manufacturing issue that meant some screen controller chips became loose. \nApple was criticised by one expert who said it was the phonemaker’s responsibility to fix it. \nApple is charging $149 in the USA for the service that will only be available on phones that are “in working order”. Loose chips \nIn a statement on its website, Apple said it had “determined” that displays on some iPhone 6 Plus handsets flickered or became unresponsive if the device was dropped several times on a hard surface and was then subjected to “further stress”. \nAn iPhone 6 Plus suffering this problem, which worked and did not have a cracked or broken screen, was eligible for the repair programme, it said. \nThe service is available worldwide and costs £146.44 in the UK. \nApple said that customers who had already paid to get their phone cured of “touch disease” should get in touch to be repaid for the amount they spent beyond the programme fee. \nThe repair programme will run for five years beyond the initial date on which the iPhone 6 Plus went on sale, said Apple. \nStuart Miles, founder of gadget news site Pocket-lint, said: “I think if it’s a known defect that isn’t caused by the user then it should be the responsibility of Apple to fix the phone free of charge regardless of the age.” \nThe manufacturing problem with the iPhone 6 Plus was first highlighted by gadget site iFixit which said it had seen an “influx of faulty iPhones”. \nIn a blogpost about the problem posted in August, iFixit said there were “pages and pages” of messages from aggrieved iPhone 6 Plus owners on the Apple support site complaining about the fault. \nAn investigation by iFixit and specialist repair shops found the cause of the fault was the placement of the touchscreen controller chip. Several rough knocks could dislodge this chip making phones unresponsive, it said. \n–",

      "text": "How Trump’s Presidency Could Affect IBM and Its Peers PART 2 OF 9 Apple and Peers Expected to Drive a Rise in US Corporate Cash By Anne Shields | Nov 18, 2016 2:07 pm EST US corporate cash reserves will rise to $1.8 trillion in 2016 \nEarlier, we discussed how a rise in the US dollar could impact the growths of IBM ( IBM ) and its peers. Let’s have a look at the cash reserves of the leading technology players and how a change in the tax rate could affect them. \nAccording to a recent Moody’s report released in November 2016, tech players now hold almost 50% of the overall cash held by US non-financial companies. The report further highlights that the top five cash holders are tech companies that include Apple ( AAPL ), Microsoft ( MSFT ), Google ( GOOG ), Cisco Systems ( CSCO ), and Oracle ( ORCL ), in that order. Moody’s expects US corporate cash reserves, driven by the tech sector, to rise to $1.8 trillion in 2016, compared to $1.7 trillion in 2015. \nThe table above, released in March 2016, shows a list of the 20 non-disclosing companies, which includes the technology companies with the biggest cash reserves. These 20 companies include leading technology players such as IBM and Google. Collectively, these 20 companies possess $1 trillion in unrepatriated foreign income—more than 50% of the total income held by the 248 “non-disclosing” companies. Tech sector drives the surge in US corporate cash \nA majority of the cash that corporations possess is generated and held overseas. According to Moody’s, overseas cash is expected to reach ~$1.3 trillion in 2016, compared to an estimated $1.2 trillion in 2015. \nThe rises in the cash reserves of US companies can be majorly attributed to selected big tech players. Moody’s expects that Apple ( AAPL ) will continue to lead its peers, as its cash reserves are reaching toward $253 billion. It will be followed by Microsoft, which has $115 billion in cash reserves. \nGoogle and Oracle are expected to possess $85 billion and $68 billion, respectively, while Cisco Systems ( CSCO ) is expected to stand in fifth place, with $67 billion in cash reserves. {\"metrics\":[\"Open\"],\"tickers\":[\"AAPL\",\"CSCO\",\"GOOG\",\"IBM\",\"MSFT\"],\"ticker_names\":[\"Apple Inc.\",\"Cisco Systems, Inc.\",\"Google Inc\",\"International Business Machines Corp.\",\"Microsoft Corporation\"]} X",

      "text": "Apple could move iPhone production to U.S. - sources  47   iPhones might one day soon carry \"Made in America\" labels. Key Apple assembler Hon Hai Precision Industry, also known as Foxconn Technology Group, has been studying the possibility of moving iPhone production to the U.S. , the Nikkei Asian Review cited sources as saying on Friday, November 18. \n\"Apple asked both Foxconn and Pegatron, the two iPhone assemblers, in June to look into making iPhones in the U.S.,\" a source said. \"Foxconn complied, while Pegatron declined to formulate such a plan due to cost concerns.\" \nFoxconn, based in the gritty, industrial Tucheng district in suburban Taipei, and its smaller Taiwanese rival churn out more than 200 million iPhones annually from their massive Chinese campuses. \nAnother source said that while Foxconn had been working on the request from Apple Inc., its biggest customer that accounts for more than 50% of its sales, Chairman Terry Gou had been less enthusiastic due to an inevitable rise in production costs. \n\"Making iPhones in the U.S. means the cost will more than double,\" the source said. \nThe person added that one view among the Apple supply chain in Taiwan is that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump may push the Cupertino, California-based tech titan to make a certain number of iPhone components at home, Nikkei said. \nAccording to research company IHS Markit, it costs about $225 for Apple to make an iPhone 7 with a 32GB memory, while the unsubsidized price for such a handset is $649. \nApple, Foxconn and Pegatron all declined to comment.

      "text": "A Russian company that makes iPhone-hacking software said earlier this week that Apple quietly collects iPhone call data in iCloud, including both cellular voice calls and FaceTime calls. But it turns out that’s a feature built into iOS and macOS for the user’s “convenience.” So there’s no point freaking out about it. That said, Apple could certainly have done a better job informing the user what happens with call data.\nDON’T MISS: All the best pre-Black Friday deals you can buy right now at Walmart, Best Buy and Amazon\nIf you’ve got iCloud enabled on your Apple devices, and most people do, then Apple will record data from all your calls, whether it’s a regular phone call or VoIP-based calls including FaceTime, Skype, WhatsApp, Viber and others.\nEverything gets synced to the cloud, complete with phone numbers, call dates and times, and call duration. The reasoning here is pretty simple. Apple wants you to be able to access those calls and return missed calls from any of your devices. This is possible through Apple’s Continuity feature.\nThe actual contents of a call aren’t saved in iCloud. After all, Apple doesn’t listen in on your conversations.\nHowever, the worry with some people is that the data stored in iCloud can be decrypted by Apple, and can be shared with law enforcement if a warrant requires Apple to do so. Hackers might also access call history, and Elcomsoft updated its Phone Breaker software to extract call records from iCloud using only an authentication token for an account from a computer belonging to the account holder.\nTo make those call records disappear, you have to delete them from a device. Otherwise, they’ll remain in iCloud for up to four months. FaceTime call invitations can be stored for up to 30 days.\n“We offer call history syncing as a convenience to our customers so that they can return calls from any of their devices,” an Apple spokesperson said about the matter. “Device data is encrypted with a user’s passcode, and access to iCloud data including backups requires the user’s Apple ID and password. Apple recommends all customers select strong passwords and use two-factor authentication.”\nMacRumors notes that while Apple may not explain exactly what happens in the background, it does state that it collects call history for iCloud backups in a 63-page white paper about iOS security.\nTrending right now:\nToday’s your last chance to get a NES Classic 9 paid iPhone apps on sale for free for a limited time Best Buy is offering a solid Black Friday deal on the new Google Home See the original version of this article on BGR.com",

      "text": "Apple Offering Discounts of up to Rs 28000 on Purchase of iPhone 7 and iPad in India Posted by Rajesh Pandey on Nov 19, 2016 | No Comments tweet \nIn a bid to stir iPhone and iPad sales in India, Apple has teamed up with Citibank to offer some irresistible deals to consumers in the country. \nIf you purchase an iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus and an iPad Pro to go along with it, you will get a cashback of up to Rs 23,000. And if you go for the older iPad Air 2, you will be eligible for a cashback of Rs 18,000. For the iPad mini 2 and iPad mini 4, Apple is offering a cashback of Rs 17,000. The catch here is that you will have to pay for your purchase through Citibank’s credit card. \nAdditionally, Apple is also offering customers with an in-store discount of up to Rs 5900 if they purchase an iPhone 7 and an iPad Pro on the same day from the same store. For the iPad Air and iPad mini, Apple is offering cash discounts of Rs 2900 and Rs 2800, respectively. The offer is valid until December 31, 2016. \nWith the Indian government banning the Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes in the country overnight, sales of smartphones have more than halved. Considering that most people purchasing an iPhone usually buy it via cash, sales of iPhones are also likely going to be affected a lot. Thus, it looks like Apple has partnered with Citibank to launch some attractive offers in a bid to revive sales of its devices in the country. \nIndia has become an increasingly important market for Apple, especially since its sales in China have started declining. Tim Cook had previously that the penetration of 4G network is India is going t o help boost iPhone sales in the country and that there is still a lot of headroom for the Cupertino company to grow.",

It would be broke if it bought every company people have said it had to buy. \nWriting for ZDNet , Larry Dignan tries to tell us “Why Samsung's Harman purchase will be seen as Apple blunder decades from now.” (Tip o’ the antlers to Tibo Csapo.) \nDecades from now?! Well, that’s a good way to hedge your bet. When we’re all dead, we’ll look back on this and laugh. \nThe deal makes so much sense you have to wonder why Apple didn't buy Harman. \nYou don’t have to. There’s no law. We could just let Samsung do its thing and Apple do something else. \nHa, just kidding. Of course we can’t do that . That would be silly. \nThe crux of the case, outlined by Jim Cramer repeatedly… \nWell, if the guy who yells on cable TV said it was a good idea… \n…is that Apple could diversify and become the hub of the connected car. \nNext, Apple should buy a weapons manufacturer. You won’t believe the chamfered edges on these tanks. \nAs John Gruber notes : \nArguing that Apple should have bought Harman is arguing that Apple should evolve into a conglomerate. It might make perfect sense for Samsung, because Samsung is a conglomerate — a company that makes everything from washing machines to refrigerators. They used to make construction vehicles . \nThey also used to have a weapons division ! The tanks all looked like the iPhone 4. \nAssuming Samsung doesn't completely botch the Harman purchase, Apple may regret not beating its rival to the punch. \nAssuming this all works out perfectly, Apple will wish it had done the thing that worked out perfectly. \nDespite the desire by pundits for Apple to make a huge acquisition, it doesn’t need, want or have to. There are more ways to kill a cat than by acquiring it to death. To comment on this article and other Macworld content, visit our Facebook page or our Twitter feed. Related:",

      "text": "SAN FRANCISCO — Apple is recognizing that “Touch Disease” is a thing. The tech company is rolling out a repair program to fix iPhone 6 Plus devices with unresponsive touchscreen features.\nThe term “Touch Disease” refers to the touchscreen issues that surface after the phone undergoes stress, like being dropped on the floor several times. In many cases, iPhone users have complained the touchscreen will entirely stop working for several months.\nIn August, repair site iFixit discovered that the issue stemmed from faulty chips inside the devices. When the phone is dropped or bent, the chips become loose. At the time, iFixit called the issue “Touch Disease” — and it was quickly adopted by the internet.\nNow, the company is willing to repair affected devices for $149 — as long as your screen isn’t cracked and the phone is in working order.\nApple said on its website it “determined that some iPhone 6 Plus devices may exhibit display flickering or multi-touch issues after being dropped multiple times on a hard surface and then incurring further stress on the device.”\nAlthough some iPhone 6 users have also reported the issue, Apple’s fix only applies to the larger-sized iPhone 6 Plus.\nThe company added it will reimburse people if they already fixed devices through Apple service providers for more than $149.\nFollowing widespread reports of the problem, “Touch Disease” — on both sizes of the iPhone 6 — has accounted for up to 22% of repairs at Apple Stores, according to tech site Apple Insider.\nApple is facing class action lawsuits in California, Utah, and Canada over “Touch Disease.” The complaints allege Apple knew about the faulty touchscreens and didn’t do anything about it.\nThese cases are not yet resolved.\n",

      "text": "Apple delivered what it said was a major new product this week. But more than a few Apple fans were disappointed.\nApple unveiled a book, Designed by Apple in California , focused on the company’s product design prowess from 1998 and 2015. Following a rather disappointing event in October during which Apple only announced a new MacBook Pro, some Apple fans had hoped for a November surprise like new Apple iMac computers. Instead, Apple came out with its book.\nBut the Apple world had a few other surprises this week. China’s government threatened Apple’s iPhone in response to Donald Trump’s comments about expensive tariffs on the country. Apple was also said to be working on sci-fi glasses. And at long last, Apple has a fix ready for the iPhone 6 Plus Touch Disease that stopped its touchscreen from working--but oddly, not for the iPhone 6’s same problem.\nThis is Fortune’s weekly roundup of the biggest Apple news this week. To see last week's roundup, click here . \nRead on for more:\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune's technology newsletter \nApple this week released a book called Designed by Apple in California , essentially a picture book that showcases Apple’s design concepts starting with the 1998 iMac and ending with Apple Pencil in 2015. The book, which is dedicated to late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, comes in two sizes. The small version costs $199, while the large version is $299. Apple design chief Jony Ive says his company had a “responsibility” to people worldwide to create the book. If your iPhone 6 Plus has a touchscreen that no longer works or is barely functional, Apple is now offering a fix for $149 . The service, which Apple calls a “multitouch repair program for iPhone 6 Plus,” is meant to address the so-called “Touch Disease” that has been causing iPhone 6 touchscreens to stop working. Although it affects both the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, Apple is only offering a repair for the iPhone 6 Plus . Apple earlier this year requested that its two iPhone manufacturers, Foxconn and Pegatron, explore assembling iPhones in the U.S. , according to a report this week. Foxconn is said to be analyzing such a move , but has so far found it to be too costly. Apple’s manufacturing partners assemble iPhones in China, and there are no concrete plans to change that. An editorial this week in China’s state-run Global Times threatened the U.S. with a trade war if President-elect Donald Trump carries through with a plan to impose tariffs on Chinese-made products. China said it would “take a tit-for-tat approach” that would cause iPhone sales in the country to “ suffer a setback .” Apple did not comment about China’s threat. Apple’s cloud-based storage and syncing service iCloud continually stores iPhone and iPad users’ private information , according to Russian computer-forensics firm Elcomsoft. The firm says Apple’s devices automatically upload private information, including dialed phone numbers to iCloud, where it could be accessed by hackers or by law enforcement agencies with a warrant. Although privacy advocates were concerned about the findings, Apple said in a statement that it’s “ deeply committed to safeguarding our customers’ data .” U.S. law enforcement agencies say that a growing number of iPhones that could be useful in a criminal investigation are increasingly being held in limbo in police evidence rooms without ever being accessed. In an interview with Fortune this week, Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. said privacy features built into Apple’s iOS mobile operating system make it impossible for law enforcement, as well as Apple, to access data on the phones. He added that many cases are going unsolved because of encryption. Apple, however, continues to argue that security and encryption are critical. Although Apple has said in the past that wrists are the best place for wearable devices, a report this week says the company is testing a wearable headset that may use augmented reality. It’s unclear what the headset would be used for , but could take on devices like Microsoft’s HoloLens headset. For more about Apple’s iPhone 7, watch: \nOne more thing… Apple saved the peach emoji. You’ll find it in a future iOS release .",

      "text": "Search Jim Cramer's \"Mad Money\" trading recommendations using our exclusive \"Mad Money\" Stock Screener . \nDid you miss last night's \"Mad Money\" on CNBC ? If so, here are Jim Cramer's top takeaways for next week's trading.\n\nApple ( AAPL )  : What does a Trump administration mean for Apple , the Action Alerts PLUS holding that Cramer has repeatedly urged investors to just own for the long haul? Turns out, there are both positives and negatives.\nOn the negative side, Trump wants to get tough on China, where not only are Apple's product made, but also where it sells 20% of them. Clearly, a 45% tariff on Chinese goods or an all-out trade war would be bad news for Apple.\nTrump has also been critical of skilled-worker visas, something that Silicon Valley depends heavily on. Finally, there's that matter of Trump suggesting a boycott of Apple products until they gave the FBI a backdoor security access into their phones.\nBut there are also positives to a Trump win: mainly a lower corporate tax rate and a possible overseas tax holiday that would let Apple repatriate most of its $237 billion cash hoard.\nAdding them all up, Cramer said he sees the positives being a lot more likely than the negatives, which is why he continues to be bullish on Apple.\nA Special Invitation ... \nIt's not how you voted, it's how you invest. So how can investors win in the wake of this historical election?

      "text": "Your browser does not support the video tag. Samantha Lee/Business Insider Apple CEO Tim Cook has said several times in the last year that his company is willing to look at and consider billion-dollar acquisitions with its $237 billion war chest. \nMost of the possibilities floated by analysts and the press don't make a lot of sense: Time Warner, Disney, Tesla Motors. \nSome are saying Apple needs to think differently, and make one big, crazy acquisition, before it's too late. An acquisition that would change the company forever. \nI think Apple should buy Snap, Snapchat's parent company. The timing is now \nWhy not? REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson \nWhy would Snap founder Evan Spiegel want to sell his company to Apple? Money. \nSnap filed for a confidential IPO earlier this week, Business Insider learned , that could value the company between $20 billion and $25 billion. The actual paperwork, including Snap's revenue, profit (or lack thereof), and assets has yet to surface. \nBut the fact that Snap filed confidentially reveals one fact: Snap's revenue is less than $1 billion. Even assuming big league revenue growth for the disappearing photo messenger, that's a surprisingly large valuation. \nThat doesn't matter to Apple, and the company could afford a nice premium over the $25 billion the public market could value Snap at. Apple could afford Snap even if it were valued at $50 billion. \nSpiegel has expressed doubt that advertising is the growth engine that will propel Snap to become a massive technology company. \"Feed based advertising units will plummet in value ... similar to earlier devaluing of Internet display advertising,\" he wrote in an email stolen during the Sony hack. \nIf Snapchat's advertising strategy doesn't work out, it could destroy much of the worth currently locked into Snap shares held by Spiegel and other founders. \nThat's why Spiegel seems to be pivoting his company towards becoming a hardware provider, even going so far as to call Snap a \"camera company\" on its own website. It's also why Snap has started to sell Spectacles , a surprising new product that combines stylish sunglasses with a camera. \nThere's no company that understands making and selling premium hardware better than Apple. First glass \nSpectacles. Hollis Johnson \nThe hype around Spectacles, Snapchat's first real hardware product, reminds me of the hype that used to surround Apple product launches. \nEvery time Snap's custom-built, Minion-looking vending machine touches down somewhere — three times in California so far, and once in Oklahoma — a line immediately forms, full of people waiting to buy the $129 glasses. \nApple used to have a following like that, and to some extent still does, but there is an excitement to the Spectacles launch that Apple has not had in a long time. \nJust look at the lines. \nThat's because Spiegel carefully planned this launch. He understands the importance of marketing, and limited rollouts, and how important it is to make something cool that people want. \nAnd that's the key — Spectacles are the first piece of tech worn on the face that is actually cool. \n\"From the first moment of opening the lid to pairing the Spectacles with my phone, they were everything I hoped they'd be: well-designed, stylish, fun, and easy to use. Walking around New York City with them, I felt like part of an exclusive club,\" my colleague Avery Hartmans wrote earlier this week. \n\"Regardless of how you feel about Snapchat's new camera-equipped glasses, one thing is certain: Snapchat's marketing team is genius,\" she wrote. \nNews broke this week that Apple is working on a pair of stylish smart glasses that could launch as soon as 2018. It's still early, but it seems like Snap has already solved the biggest problem with wearable computers on the face: getting people to want to wear them. \nSnapchat's glasses are only a camera for now, but it's not hard to see where the company is going with them — a fully functional AR device that could be competing with Apple Glasses in a few years. \nApple could eliminate a major competitor and gain a great head start to its glasses project at the same time. Why Apple would want Snap \nSnapchat CEO Evan Spiegel speaks onstage during 'Disrupting Information and Communication' at the Vanity Fair New Establishment Summit at Yerba Buena Center for the Arts on October 8, 2014 in San Francisco, California. Getty/Michael Kovac \nThe fact that Snap doesn't have much revenue yet actually makes the company attractive to Apple. \nCook says all the time that Apple doesn't buy companies for their cash flow — Apple has plenty of that itself. \nInstead, Cook says, Apple is looking for \"great talent and great intellectual property.\" Snap has both. \nSnap is growing quickly and now has a varied and eclectic pool of talented engineers, especially in the fields of computer vision and AI, two fields which Apple is investing heavily in. \nSome of Snap's top employees even used to work at Apple. \nSnap also has some great intellectual property. People in the augmented reality industry say its in-house developed emoji tracking feature is genuinely impressive, and could be a building block for future applications. Snap's face-transforming Snapchat \"Lens\" filters are probably the most widely used example of computer vision-powered augmented reality at the moment. \nvia GIPHY \nThat's pretty attractive intellectual property for a company that is is getting into augmented reality in a big way. Plus, it's undeniable that Snap is tapped into young people in a way that Apple, led by its team of mostly older men , is not. \nPlus, Apple is reportedly developing a Snapchat-like video app . Why clone, when you can have the original? Spiegel might not sell — but he does emulate Apple founder Steve Jobs \nEvan Spiegel/Twitter \nThere are a few issues with this proposal. First, Snap is an LA-based company, so Apple couldn't buy it with overseas cash at a discount — one of the main factors driving the company's M&A strategy at the moment. \nBut the bigger problem is that Spiegel probably doesn't want to sell. \nHe famously turned down an offer from Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to buy his company for billions of dollars in 2013. (He also previously blew off Zuck with a surprisingly cold email.) \nIf Speigel, who is 26, sold Snap to Apple, Apple should make him the CEO. After all, Apple has had a 26-year old CEO before: Steve Jobs. \nThe key to Spiegel is that he is a product \"Picasso,\" as people who know him have said. He studied product design at Stanford, and Business Insider has been told that Snap's office vibe is like \"a movie director starting a company, with artists flowing in and out\" — similar to how Apple's famously secretive industrial design studio operates. \nApple would do well with a product-focused guru at its helm. Cook is fantastic at running the company, but Apple was built around the whims and taste of one man — Jobs — who was intensely focused on building products. \nA file photo of Steve Jobs with the Snapchat Spectacles filter applied. Reuters/Business Insider \nToday, with chief design officer Jony Ive increasingly looking backwards and working on side projects , there's a sense that there isn't anyone at Apple who's in charge of the product anymore. \nSpeigel — who resembles Steve Jobs in his showmanship, his obsession with secrecy, and his focus on products and experience — would be able to give Apple some clarity when it comes to its AR and glasses strategy, and probably has an idea or two about how to make the next iPhone better beyond giving it faster chips and taking away the headphone jack. \nBut Apple should hurry. Snap could list as soon as March — and in a few years, it could be one of Apple's fiercest competitors.",

      "text": "Samantha Lee/Business Insider \nApple CEO Tim Cook has said several times in the last year that his company is willing to look at and consider billion-dollar acquisitions with its $237 billion war chest.\nMost of the possibilities floated by analysts and the press don't make a lot of sense: Time Warner, Disney, Tesla Motors.\nSome are saying Apple needs to think differently, and make one big, crazy acquisition, before it's too late. An acquisition that would change the company forever.\nI think Apple should buy Snap, Snapchat's parent company. \nThe timing is now Samantha Lee/Business Insider Why would Snap founder Evan Spiegel want to sell his company to Apple? Money. \nSnap filed for a confidential IPO earlier this week, Business Insider learned , that could value the company between $20 billion and $25 billion. The actual paperwork, including Snap's revenue, profit (or lack thereof), and assets has yet to surface. \nBut the fact that Snap filed confidentially reveals one fact: Snap's revenue is less than $1 billion. Even assuming big league revenue growth for the disappearing photo messenger, that's a surprisingly large valuation. \nThat doesn't matter to Apple, and the company could afford a nice premium over the $25 billion the public market could value Snap at. Apple could afford Snap even if it were valued at $50 billion. \nSpiegel has expressed doubt that advertising is the growth engine that will propel Snap to become a massive technology company. \"Feed based advertising units will plummet in value ... similar to earlier devaluing of Internet display advertising,\" he wrote in an email stolen during the Sony hack. \nIf Snapchat's advertising strategy doesn't work out, it could destroy much of the worth currently locked into Snap shares held by Spiegel and other founders.\nThat's why Spiegel seems to be pivoting his company towards becoming a hardware provider, even going so far as to call Snap a \"camera company\" on its own website. It's also why Snap has started to sell Spectacles , a surprising new product that combines stylish sunglasses with a camera. \nThere's no company that understands making and selling premium hardware better than Apple. \nFirst glass Samantha Lee/Business Insider The hype around Spectacles, Snapchat's first real hardware product, reminds me of the hype that used to surround Apple product launches. \nEvery time Snap's custom-built, Minion-looking vending machine touches down somewhere — three times in California so far, and once in Oklahoma — a line immediately forms, full of people waiting to buy the $129 glasses. \nApple used to have a following like that, and to some extent still does, but there is an excitement to the Spectacles launch that Apple has not had in a long time.\nJust look at the lines. \nThat's because Spiegel carefully planned this launch. He understands the importance of marketing, and limited rollouts, and how important it is to make something cool that people want. \nAnd that's the key — Spectacles are the first piece of tech worn on the face that is actually cool.  \n\"From the first moment of opening the lid to pairing the Spectacles with my phone, they were everything I hoped they'd be: well-designed, stylish, fun, and easy to use. Walking around New York City with them, I felt like part of an exclusive club,\" my colleague Avery Hartmans wrote earlier this week.\n\"Regardless of how you feel about Snapchat's new camera-equipped glasses, one thing is certain: Snapchat's marketing team is genius,\" she wrote. \nNews broke this week that Apple is working on a pair of stylish smart glasses that could launch as soon as 2018. It's still early, but it seems like Snap has already solved the biggest problem with wearable computers on the face: getting people to want to wear them.\nSnapchat's glasses are only a camera for now, but it's not hard to see where the company is going with them — a fully functional AR device that could be competing with Apple Glasses in a few years. \nApple could eliminate a major competitor and gain a great head start to its glasses project at the same time.\nWhy Apple would want Snap  Samantha Lee/Business Insider The fact that Snap doesn't have much revenue yet actually makes the company attractive to Apple. \nCook says all the time that Apple doesn't buy companies for their cash flow — Apple has plenty of that itself.\nInstead, Cook says, Apple is looking for \"great talent and great intellectual property.\" Snap has both. \nSnap is growing quickly and now has a varied and eclectic pool of talented engineers, especially in the fields of computer vision and AI, two fields which Apple is investing heavily in. \nSome of Snap's top employees even used to work at Apple.\nSnap also has some great intellectual property. People in the augmented reality industry say its in-house developed emoji tracking feature is genuinely impressive, and could be a building block for future applications. Snap's face-transforming Snapchat \"Lens\" filters are probably the most widely used example of computer vision-powered augmented reality at the moment.\nRAW Embed \nThat's pretty attractive intellectual property for a company that is  is getting into augmented reality in a big way. Plus, it's undeniable that Snap is tapped into young people in a way that Apple, led by its team of mostly older men , is not.  \nPlus, Apple is reportedly developing a Snapchat-like video app . Why clone, when you can have the original? \nSpiegel might not sell — but he does emulate Apple founder Steve Jobs Samantha Lee/Business Insider There are a few issues with this proposal. First, Snap is an LA-based company, so Apple couldn't buy it with overseas cash at a discount — one of the main factors driving the company's M&A strategy at the moment. \nBut the bigger problem is that Spiegel probably doesn't want to sell.\nHe famously turned down an offer from Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to buy his company for billions of dollars in 2013. (He also previously blew off Zuck with a surprisingly cold email.) \nIf Speigel, who is 26, sold Snap to Apple, Apple should make him the CEO. After all, Apple has had a 26-year old CEO before: Steve Jobs. \nThe key to Spiegel is that he is a product \"Picasso,\" as people who know him have said. He studied product design at Stanford, and Business Insider has been told that Snap's office vibe is like \"a movie director starting a company, with artists flowing in and out\" — similar to how Apple's famously secretive industrial design studio operates. \nApple would do well with a product-focused guru at its helm. Cook is fantastic at running the company, but Apple was built around the whims and taste of one man — Jobs — who was intensely focused on building products.\nSamantha Lee/Business Insider Today, with chief design officer Jony Ive increasingly looking backwards and working on side projects , there's a sense that there isn't anyone at Apple who's in charge of the product anymore. \nSpeigel — who resembles Steve Jobs in his showmanship, his obsession with secrecy, and his focus on products and experience — would be able to give Apple some clarity when it comes to its AR and glasses strategy, and probably has an idea or two about how to make the next iPhone better beyond giving it faster chips and taking away the headphone jack. \nBut Apple should hurry. Snap could list as soon as March — and in a few years, it could be one of Apple's fiercest competitors. \nNOW WATCH: The ‘Apple of China’ just unveiled a phone that’s more powerful and better looking than the iPhone \n",

      "text": "Apple Celebrates Itself in $300 Coffee Table Tome Print Email By John P. Mello Jr. • E-Commerce Times • ECT News Network\nNov 18, 2016 10:09 AM PT Apple this week introduced a new offering that is neither hardware nor software, but a pricey book bulging with artsy photos of the company's products.\nDesigned by Apple in California contains 450 photos of products created by Apple over a 20-year span. It's available in two sizes: 10.20 by 12.75 inches for US$199 and 13 by 16.25 inchesfor $299.\nThe linen-covered hardbound volume -- filled with photographs by Andrew Zuckerman, who is known for popping his images out of stark white backgrounds -- is dedicated to Apple's late cofounder Steve Jobs. It is printed on specially milled, custom-dyed paper with gilded matte silver edges, using eight color separations and low-ghost ink.\n\"This archive is intended to be a gentle gathering of many of the products the team has designed over the years,\" said Apple Chief Design Officer Jony Ive.\n\"We hope it brings some understanding to how and why they exist, while serving as a resource for students of all design disciplines,\" he added.\nThe books are availabile at Apple.com in eight countries, as well as at a select number of Apple retail stores.\nMixed Messages Although it's not unusual to see expensive books at this time of year, Apple's aims appear to be higher than just grabbing some real estate on coffee tables.\n\"The idea is to reinforce Apple's design philosophy and reassert their message that their designs start in Silicon Valley and throughout California, which in many ways still sits at the heart of technology and its future,\" Creative Strategies President Tim Bajarin told the E-Commerce Times.\nAlthough many of the designs pictured in the book were groundbreaking, the marketing strategy behind the book is an old one.\n\"The new volume finds Apple following a fairly conventional messaging strategy -- delivering a high-profile document that reminds people just how great your products are, thus justifying their happiness and your own success,\" said Charles King, principal analyst at Pund-IT .\n\"A secondary benefit is that focusing intense attention on past successes also helps divert people's attention from your current problems and shortcomings,\" he told the E-Commerce Times.\nSticker Shock Companies tooting their own horn in vanity books isn't new, although businesses that do it typically have a longer history than Apple's.\n\"Companies will occasionally publish books about their history,\" explained Larry Chiagouris, a marketing professor at Pace University .\n\"Those kinds of books are meant for employees and, to some degree, investors. They're meant to put an exclamation mark by the substantial nature and viability of a company,\" he noted.\n\"Apple's book is about its products, which from a design perspective have had an advantage in aesthetics in the competitive fray,\" Chiagouris told the E-Commerce Times.\nNevertheless, at $300, the audience will be limited.\n\"When companies do expensive books like this, they will either lower the price in the future and keep the $300 price point on the book so people will think they're getting a great deal,\" Chiagouris said, \"or they'll offer the book as a premium when someone makes a major Apple purchase.\"\nThe book targets a narrow audience, Pund-IT's King suggested.\n\"The pricing will put it out of reach for most consumers and curious buyers, even as a holiday gift,\" he said.\n\"Then again, the book is really aimed at pleasing Apple's truest fans -- the folks who believe that the company's products are fully worth their premium prices,\" King pointed out. \"As a status item, I expect the $299 version to be a big seller among those Apple customers.\"\nAudacious Move Others may see value in the book beyond its status symbol appeal.\n\"It will be of great interest to design professionals across all disciplines,\" said Creative Strategies' Bajarin, and \"there will be serious interest from those in the tech world who want a better understanding of how Apple thinks about design and products.\"\nPublishing Designed by Apple in California is an audacious move, said Chiagouris.\n\"If nothing else, it's getting us talking about Apple and the history of design. That's a good thing for Apple,\" he said.\nThat said, \"if they wanted more of us to talk about it, they might have come up with something that was less than $100, so people would take it seriously and spend more time discussing and reviewing it,\" Chiagouris added.\n\"Their strategy was a smart strategy,\" he said, \"but their execution leaves a lot to be desired, because they picked such a high price point.\"",

      "text": "McLaren Confirms Talks With Apple 'Never Matured to Definitive Proposition' Saturday November 19, 2016 7:49 am PST by Joe Rossignol In late September, the Financial Times reported Apple was considering a full takeover of McLaren Automotive or a strategic investment in the British supercar maker. The New York Times and Bloomberg separately reported talks were underway as well, noting Apple was more likely to make a large investment in McLaren rather than buy it. Two months later, it now turns out those reports were accurate. In an interview with Reuters , McLaren Automotive CEO Mike Flewitt confirmed McLaren was in discussions with Apple, but he said the talks never progressed towards a definitive proposition. He also ruled out a takeover bid from Apple. \"There wasn't a bid from Apple,\" said Flewitt. \"They visited. We talked. We talked about what they did. We talked about what we did. They toured. It never matured to a definitive proposition,\" he said. McLaren previously said it was \"not in discussion with Apple in respect of any potential investment,\" a seemingly purposefully vague statement that did not rule out discussions between the companies entirely. Financial Times reporter Tim Bradshaw rightly stood by his story despite McLaren's statement. Apple's interest in McLaren may have diminished as the iPhone maker's ambitions reportedly no longer include building its own car \"for now.\" Under the leadership of Bob Mansfield , Apple's automotive team has reportedly shifted its focus towards developing an underlying system and technologies for autonomous vehicles. McLaren, headquartered in Woking, Surrey, manufactures high-performance sports cars , including the P1 and F1 models commonly used for Formula One racing. The carmaker produced just 1,654 vehicles last year, some costing as much as $1 million apiece. Apple marketing chief Phil Schiller is said to own a McLaren. McLaren has a Formula One team itself that competes under the name McLaren Honda, winning more F1 Grand Prix races than any other team since 1966. Formula One itself was sold to U.S.-based Liberty Media for $4.4 billion in August. McLaren Automotive and McLaren Racing are subsidiaries of McLaren Technology Group. (Thanks, OllyW!)",

      "text": "macbook pro inch hard to repair ifixit teardown More Scott Havard/iFixit\nApple’s 2016 13-inch MacBook Pro models, both with and without Touch Bar , are both incredibly thin and light and thus basically designed to be very difficult to break down to perform repairs. Machines like these contribute to the notion of “throwaway” machines that are recycled rather than repaired when issues arise.\nIt turns out that the larger sibling, the 2016 15-inch MacBook Pro, is also an incredibly tightly designed and built machine that not only has no user-serviceable parts inside, but likely has few Apple-serviceable parts as well. When it’s all torn down, the 15-inch MacBook Pro earns the same 1-out-of-10 repairability score as its smaller Touch Bar sibling, according to iFixit .\nMore: 2016 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar scores a 1/10 on iFixit’s teardown test\nThe larger machine’s teardown could mostly be summarized by simply pointing to the smaller version and saying, “It’s just like that.” They’re essentially twins inside, with very minimal differences to note beyond a different battery layout. One major difference is an extra touchpad controller to manage the larger touchpad offered on the 15-inch MacBook Pro.\n2016-15-inch-macbook-pro-fans More Scott Havard/iFixit\nJust like the 13-inch model, this one also sports two cooling fans, and they’re larger at 46.6 mm versus 42.3 mm. The six-cell battery is 76 watt-hours, meaning it should help offset the larger screen compared to the much smaller 49.2 watt-hour battery in the 13-inch MacBook Pro.\nThe chassis uses the same pentalobe screws requiring special equipment to open up, and everything is glued in and soldered down, and highly integrated. From the perspective of cramming as much technology into as minimal a space as possible, the 15-inch MacBook Pro is a remarkable machine. From the perspective of opening it up and performing repairs, it’s not quite so impressive.\n2016-15-inch-macbook-pro-batteries More Scott Havard/iFixit\nOnce again, the 15-inch machine’s SSD is soldered to the motherboard, meaning there’s no upgradeable storage option available. That leaves the 13-inch model without Touch Bar as the only storage-upgradeable option in the 2016 MacBook Pro lineup.\nUltimately, the 2016 15-inch MacBook Pro is a machine that you’ll want to purchase as fully stocked as you can afford, because you’ll be stuck with it until you decide to move on. If it needs to be fixed, there’s a good chance you’ll simply be handed a new unit unless Apple has some teardown chops that the iFixit staff does not.\nLatest MacBook Pro gives up repairability to be so thin, teardown reveals Tinkerers at iFixit subjected Apple's new MacBook Pro (no Touch Bar) to a teardown Sibling rivalry: The new MacBook Pro 13-inch vs. the old Macbook Pro 13-inch",

      "text": "Apple Will Offer Discounted 'Touch Disease' Repairs for iPhone 6 Plus You've got the touch. By Seth G. Macy \nOwners of the iPhone 6 Plus suffering from so-called \"touch disease\" can now have their phones repaired by Apple for a reduced price. \nBasically, if your touch-screen is unresponsive, you can get it fixed, officially, for $149 USD. \nThe problem, which affects phones \"dropped multiple times on a hard surface,\" is a malfunctioning of the iPhone 6 Plus' multi-touch screen, marked by a grey bar at the top of the screen. \nAccording t o Apple, \"some iPhone 6 Plus devices may exhibit display flickering or Multi-Touch\" problems after incurring the stresses associated with the phone hitting the ground. \nThe site iFixit first uncovered the problem and blames it on a design defect inherent in the devices. The problem isn't in the screen itself, iFixit reported, but rather the problem is caused by the touchscreen controller chips on the logicboard of the phone itself. \nApple says it will reimburse affected users who may have paid to have the issue resolved, equal to the difference in the price paid \"for the original service\" and \"the $149 service price.\" \nFor the Apple faithful, $149 is a small price to pay for continued use of the latest iPhone. Apple's banking on the faithfulness of its fanbase for more than just repairs: it recently revealed a $300 book of Apple product photos . \nSeth Macy is a freelance writer who just wants to be your friend.

Simply put, this is as close as you'll get to a giant wall-mounted iPhone. \"Design includes the time and date in the upper right hand corner and weather in the top left. All apps can be moved around and placed anywhere on the mirror. After 45 seconds of inactivity the mirror goes to sleep (appears as any ordinary mirror), simply tap anywhere to wake back up and resume use. Some useful things you can do with this mirror: Request an Uber, watch Netflix, read the news, control smart thermostat / light bulbs, control Sonos speaker system, and more,\" said Dymek.

      "text": "Search Jim Cramer's \"Mad Money\" trading recommendations using our exclusive \"Mad Money\" Stock Screener .\nDid you miss last night's \"Mad Money\" on CNBC ? If so, here are Jim Cramer's top takeaways for next week's trading.\nApple ( AAPL ) : What does a Trump administration mean for Apple , the Action Alerts PLUS holding that Cramer has repeatedly urged investors to just own for the long haul? Turns out, there are both positives and negatives.\nOn the negative side, Trump wants to get tough on China, where not only are Apple's product made, but also where it sells 20% of them. Clearly, a 45% tariff on Chinese goods or an all-out trade war would be bad news for Apple.\nTrump has also been critical of skilled-worker visas, something that Silicon Valley depends heavily on. Finally, there's that matter of Trump suggesting a boycott of Apple products until they gave the FBI a backdoor security access into their phones.\nBut there are also positives to a Trump win: mainly a lower corporate tax rate and a possible overseas tax holiday that would let Apple repatriate most of its $237 billion cash hoard.\nAdding them all up, Cramer said he sees the positives being a lot more likely than the negatives, which is why he continues to be bullish on Apple.\nA Special Invitation ...\nIt's not how you voted, it's how you invest. So how can investors win in the wake of this historical election? If you're planning to be in New York on Tuesday, Dec. 6, you are invited to join senior editors from TheStreet and our special guest experts for a cocktail party and lively conversation about the outlook for the U.S. financial markets. Which companies and sectors are poised to profit? What shocks and opportunities await investors in the new year? Listen to and meet our panelists: Lew Altfest , CEO of Altfest Personal Wealth Management; Barry Ritholtz , founder of Ritholtz Wealth Management; and Larry Siegel , director of research at the CFA Institute Research Foundation, with moderator Robert Powell . This evening event is free and will be held in midtown Manhattan. Reservations are required. For more information or to RSVP, please email events@thestreet.com\nIn this week's roundup for Action Alerts PLUS , Cramer and Jack Mohr say that the tech breakout notwithstanding, financials were strong again. Read what they're telling their members about next week with a free trial membership to their investment club .",

      "text": "By Andy Weir Senior News Editor Neowin LLC @gcaweir · 5 seconds ago with 0 comments \n7 Days is a weekly roundup of the Editors' picks of what's been happening in the world of technology - written with a dash of humor, a hint of exasperation, and an endless supply of (Irish) coffee. \nIt’s tough to keep up with everything that’s going on around the tech world, with so many announcements, rumors and updates to keep track of. But don’t worry if you missed anything – 7 Days is here to walk you through what’s been happening lately. \nOur journey this week begins by going back to the future, home of the self-lacing shoe. But that future will arrive on December 1, when Nike finally releases its long awaited HyperAdapt 1.0 sneakers for $720 . \nOver in the UK, there was troubling news for internet users, as the government passed its controversial Investigatory Powers Bill . The so-called 'Snooper's Charter' has been severely opposed by privacy advocates and others who claim it amounts to blanket surveillance of all citizens' online activities. \nIn somewhat happier news, Brits can now sign up to Amazon's Music Unlimited service , priced from as little as £3.99 a month. \nAmazon also launched its new Music Unlimited family plans for up to six people, but they're currently available only in the United States. \nApple recently launched its new MacBook Pro featuring a distinctive thin 'Touch Bar' between the keyboard and display, prompting many to wonder if a full touchscreen would have been more sensible. Apple's Phil Schiller shot that idea down, saying that \"to reach over the air to try to touch and do things\" would be \"absurd\" . \nOf course, plenty of people think the Touch Bar is a strange idea too - and given that sales of touchscreen notebooks have been doing well while MacBook sales have been falling, Schiller may just be a little out of touch himself. \nSpeaking of Apple's not-so-magic touch, some of its iPhone 6 and 6 Plus handsets have been afflicted by non-responsive touchscreens and flickering displays over the last few months. Apple acknowledged the 'Touch Disease' issue this week, but placed the blame entirely on its customers and how they'd treated their handsets, offering to repair them only if they pay $149 . \nMozilla released Firefox 50 on Tuesday bringing significant improvements in start-up performance, and a range of other new features. \nMeanwhile, Facebook bowed to pressure from privacy watchdogs, as it halted its controversial collection of data from WhatsApp users in Europe . \nWhatsApp also launched its new video calling feature , bringing it to over a billion users on iOS, Android and Windows devices. \nQualcomm announced its new flagship-class system-on-a-chip, the Snapdragon 835 , which will come to high-end devices next year. Built in partnership with Samsung, it brings a 27% boost in performance, with 40% less power consumption. \nQualcomm also revealed details of its new Quick Charge 4.0 technology , which promises \"five minutes of charging for five hours of battery life\". \nRecent reports have claimed that Samsung plans to refurbish and sell its troubled Galaxy Note7 flagship - but as we explained here, that seems extremely unlikely . \nSamsung began rolling out its second Android 7.0 Nougat beta to the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge. The company is also working on its Nougat update for the Galaxy Note 5, S6, S6 edge and Tab S2 - but it still hasn't given any indication of when the update will actually be released for any of its devices. \nGiven Samsung's record when it comes to updating its devices, it could be a long wait. \nSecurity seems to be an endless problem for Android devices, with major issues popping up with alarming frequency. This week, researchers discovered that some budget smartphones sold by US brand BLU were transmitting personally identifiable user data - including text messages, call logs and location info - to Chinese servers every 72 hours. \nHTC launched its latest high-end handset, the Bolt , on US carrier Sprint. Bizarrely, the device comes with the outdated Snapdragon 810 processor - two months after HTC released the Desire 10 Lifestyle with the years-old Snapdragon 400 . \nIt looks an awful lot like HTC is relying on the ignorance of its customers to sell them new devices with ageing specs. \nAs you may know, HTC is the manufacturer of Google's Pixel flagships - but this week, Huawei confirmed that it turned down the opportunity to build the Pixels . Huawei has plenty of other devices to keep it busy, though, as you can see in these articles from the last few days:",

      "text": "Pinterest \nPresident-elect Donald Trump hasn’t even assumed office yet and he’s already begun to save jobs. Ford Motor Company has announced that they will keep an assembly plant in Kentucky instead of off to Mexico, and now Apple may be bringing jobs back to the U.S. as well — just as Trump discussed on the campaign trail. \nInternational Business Times reported : \niPhones might soon be made in the U.S., a result of Donald Trump’s win on Election Day, according to Nikkei Asian Review report . \nHon Hai Precision Industry, also known as Foxconn Technology Group, a main Apple assembler, has allegedly been looking into the possibility of making iPhones in the United States, sources revealed to Nikkei. \n“Apple asked both Foxconn and Pegatron, the two iPhone assemblers, in June to look into making iPhones in the U.S.,” a source told Nikkei . \nFoxconn, which makes more than 200 million iPhones every year overseas, complied with Apple’s instructions, but Pegatron “declined to formulate such a plan due to cost concerns,” the source said. \n“Making iPhones in the U.S. means the cost will more than double,” a source told Nikkei. \nWhile there are many factors to consider, as Trump explained during his campaign, it is critical for the U.S. to bring jobs back. It won’t be easy, but this country needs jobs and we can’t keep allowing everything to be made elsewhere. \nBack in January, Trump said , “We’re going to get Apple to build their damn computers and things in this country instead of in other countries.” \nThen in March, Trump added , “How does it help us when they make it in China?” \nApple CEO Tim Cook discussed some of the issues facing the company in regard to making their products in the U.S. in a 60 Minutes interview : “To make iPhones, there will need to be a cluster of suppliers in the same place, which the U.S. does not have at the moment.” \nCook added, “Even if Trump imposes a 45% tariff, it is still possible that manufacturers will decide to continue production overseas as long as the costs together with the tariffs are lower than the amount they need to spend on building and running production lines in the U.S.” \nThe problem is that the U.S. has allowed the outsourcing of American jobs to go on for too long, so it won’t be easy to bring them back. It won’t be easy, but it’s critical and it has to start somewhere. As these recent reports show, Trump’s promise to bring back jobs is already in motion.",

      "text": "Reddit \nEarlier this week, Apple somewhat surprisingly announced a new book focused on the design history of the company. The book, which features 450 photographs of new and old Apple products, is available now from Apple for $199/$299 depending on the size you choose. \nPopular YouTuber-er DetroitBorg got his hands on a copy of the book and has shared a video of the experience, showing an in-depth look at what the book has to offer… \nDetroitBorg purchased both the small and large sizes of the ‘Designed by Apple in California’ book, noting that the price is high but not unreasonable in the grand scheme of design books from architecture firms and the like. He also points out that there’s a considerable amount of attention to detail with the book, such as how the pages going all the way to the edge, the detail of the images, and the quality of the cover. \nThe book covers the last 20 years of Apple design, starting at about the time Jony Ive and Steve Jobs started working together. \nThe book itself is incredibly simplistic. There are several blank pages before you get to the first actual words, which are simply ‘Designed by Apple in California’ in small and out-of-the-way text. The next page is the book’s dedication to Steve Jobs, while the page after that is an intro written by Jony Ive. In terms of product images, the first product featured is the first-gem iMac and its bright vivid color options. From there, we continue with the iBook, the Cinema Display, the G4 Cube, the Power Mac G4, and then the PowerBook G4. \nThe book then delves into the original iPod and the production that went into it. From there, the book continues to focus on the various different Macs introduced during the early 2000s. \nOne product that gets a notable amount of attention in the book is the iPod Hi-Fi. The speaker system gets multiple pages in the book, which seems interesting considering it never really took off in terms of popularity. \nThe book continues by delving into the MacBook, the continued evolution of the iPod line, the iPhone, and eventually the Apple Watch and Apple Pencil. The Apple Watch is shown in great detail, with the book offering a glimpse at some internal parts as well as all of that effort that went into the design in the first place. \nAt the very back of the book is a removable glossary that you can use as a guide as you move through the book, in case you’re not able to recognize all of the products on your own. \nYou can watch DetroitBorg’s full video below. If you’ve picked up a copy of the ‘Designed by Apple in California’ book, let us know what you think of it in the comments… Guides",

      "text": "Comment The iPhone is just one of the products featured in Apple's new book. Maurizio Pesce/ Wikipedia \nApple’s iPhone camera has been generally lauded with each successive new smartphone release, and there is good reason to. With the iPhone 7 Plus arriving with not one, but two cameras, you can be sure that there will be even more stunning photos taken that will be touched up before being blown up and presented on billboards in the near future. Word has also gone around that Apple has a team working quietly in the background that will further leverage the power of the iPhone’s camera by transforming it into a portal for Augmented Reality, or AR for short. \nIt seems as though Apple has great plans for the future that will include integrating AR technology right into the iPhone’s camera app itself. This particular bit of news was shared with Business Insider , but as there is nothing official announced from the folks over at Apple just yet, it looks like there is still some wiggle room left to discount it as a rumor. However, if such news has actually leaked out from a source familiar with the matter, then it would be best to just take it with a very, very small pinch of salt. \nThis particular effort which will involve the incorporation of AR technology into the camera app can be traced to the strategic acquisitions of several startups. It is also a sign of where Apple is heading by placing the power of AR technology into the masses. Simultaneously, Apple is also working on a special pair of glasses that might eventually alter the way where ordinary folk like you and I check out the world around us. Pokemon GO is a prime example as to how AR can change the landscape of mobile gaming, so imagine what kind of features that an integrated AR capability in a camera app can deliver, what more with the iPhone’s camera being a high end performer most of the time. \nNot only that, we have also dug up news that Apple did manage to get an expert when it comes to head mounted displays on their payroll, which is another positive sign of the long term approach that Apple is taking where a pair of glasses as an accessory is concerned. \nThis would place Apple on par with the likes of Google, Facebook, Snapchat and Microsoft, where the other four companies too, are looking into exploring the possibilities of having a pair of smart glasses to work with their hardware or ecosystem. Perhaps Apple’s foray into the AR world with their camera app would be to help the Siri experience be even more “real”, as users interact with the world around them. \nHow about the ability to recognize people’s faces, followed by manipulating them? Chances are Apple will introduce the AR technology in the form of an SDK for app developers, which would be the same route that it took where its Touch ID fingerprint sensor is concerned. \nAll in all, we will simply have to sit tight and wait to see what is Apple's next step concerning AR technology.

Adoption has been somewhat slower than for the iPhone 6s, but not dramatically so. iPhone 7 shipments have probably peaked already, according to respected Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.\nBy contrast, iPhone 7 Plus demand has been off the charts, catching Apple off guard. The iPhone maker has been working hard to ramp up iPhone 7 Plus production. These efforts are starting to yield results, but Apple still has a long way to go to meet demand during the key holiday season.\n\nContinue reading ",
