One of the employees told a 911 operator it appeared the pair were having sex, and that “a small child was seated in the back, watching,” according to police. Kimberly Onorato, 28, and Rory Clark, 27, allegedly told police that they were “cuddling” after two McDonald’s employees called 911 to report two people engaged in sexual activity in the parking lot. (Town of Orange Police Department) \nWhen police arrived, they found a woman partially-naked in the front seat with a man, and a 6-year-old in the back seat who was “alert and awake,” WTIC reported. \nThe couple said they were “cuddling” after eating at McDonald’s, according to police. \nOfficers arrested Rory Clark, 27, of West Haven, and Kimberly Onorato, 28, of Bristol. Both were charged with second-degree breach of peace and impairing the morals of a minor. \nThey were both released on $5,000 bond. ",

I refuse to give that establishment my business because of this, and I’m fed up. Recently, I went in there and asked to speak with a manager about this ongoing problem that seems to be ignored and continuously allowed. \nWhen I asked a manager why this keeps occurring without any positive changes to stop and combat this, he said that corporate won’t allow them to hire a police officer or security for this troublesome restaurant. I think that is a complete joke, so I guess my next step is to contact corporate McDonald’s about this location and the one on 41st and Colby Avenue. That location is just as bad, and I am assuming that corporate is refusing to spend money for security or a police officer there as well. They are losing customers and I hope other people complain about this too and speak up about this. \nJeff Swanson",

      "text": "A man and a woman were arrested in Connecticut after they allegedly had sex in their car in a McDonald's parking lot while a small child watched from the back seat.\nAuthorities say two McDonald's employees were leaving work around 9:30 p.m. on Nov. 15 when they noticed Rory Clark, 27, and Kimberly Onorato, 28, engaging in sexual activity in the parking lot. The employees then called the police.\n\"Officers learned that both arrestees were in the vehicle with a six-year old sitting in the back seat,\" Orange Police said in a statement, according to ctpost. \"The child was awake and alert. The female arrestee was partially undressed when officers arrived.\"\nClark and Onorato reportedly told police that they were \"cuddling\" rather than having sex, although this was contradicted by several witnesses.\nThey were both arrested and charged with impairing the morals of a minor. Onorato was also charged with second-degree breach of peace.\nBoth were released from custody after posting $5,000 bonds.\nA relative was given temporary custody of the 6-year-old, while police reported the incident to the Department of Children and Family Services.\nOnorato and Clark are scheduled to appear in court on Dec. 8 and Dec. 15 respectively, according to WVIT. It is unknown whether either defendant has secured an attorney.\n",

Employees at a McDonald’s in Orange (not pictured here) spotted the couple. (Seth Perlman/AP) \nThe West Haven couple told police they were only “cuddling” after enjoying a meal at McDonald’s. \nBoth Onorato and Clark were arrested and face charges of second-degree breaches of peace and impairing the morals of a minor. Both have court appearances scheduled for December. \nThe child was placed in the care of a relative, and the incident was reported to Connecticut’s Department of Children and Family Services.

In \"Juliette the Doll,\" a charming little ad by Leo Burnett London, a toyshop owner pulls a vintage doll, Juliette, out of a fading box. \"Maybe this year,\" he whispers, setting her in the window. Days pass. People make purchases. Unsurprisingly, our heroine is never one of them. (Who plays with dolls anymore when there are VR Gears to give?) Juliette peers forlonly out the window, offering passersby her best demure poses. Her eyes drift, ever more often, to the cheerful McDonald's across the snowy street, where people seem to be having a grand old time. Dec. 25 finally arrives. When the shopkeeper glances at the window, he finds Juliette has gone. We'll give you one guess where she went. Adweek responsive video player used on /video. There's a lot of love going on at McDonald's, but Juliette finally sets her sights on a shopping bag containing Meteor Mike, a kind of yellow Buzz Lightyear without the goofy helmet (and more hair). As Juliette slips into the bag with her new betrothed, she offers a last wave at her old caretaker. Boy, are those kids in for a surprise when they check their shopping at home! The piece ends with two simple words: \"Good times.\" The work is an expression of McDonald's role as a fueling post for families amid the season's hustle and bustle, and kicks off an eight-week holiday campaign that features a lot more technology than meets the eye here: In addition to all the usual suspects (out-of-home, digital, radio and in-store ads), special tray mats will feature augmented reality technology from Blippar. \"Juliette the Doll\" is also an innovation lovechild, despite its seemingly modest origins. Its creation included 3-D printing, puppeteering and CGI, with Juliette's face painted on by hand. \"McDonald's may not be a brand people immediately associate with Christmas, but it plays a big, perhaps unsung role,\" explain Leo Burnett creatives Phillip Meyler and Darren Keff. \"Millions of people from all walks of life pass through the doors during the festive period, rich or poor, old or young—everyone from an old-fashioned girl from a bygone era, to a futuristic fella from another planet.\" It's good to know some things will last the ravages of time. And while it isn't exactly heartening to know that our need for fast food is what will last (as opposed to sweet hand-carved toys), the execution is just charming enough to compell us to concede the point.

But they say they did. \nOn November 15 around 9:30 p.m. two people were leaving work after their shifts at the fast food restaurant located at 57 Boston Post Road in Orange when they noticed a parked car with two people inside. The employees called police to say it appeared the pair were having sex, and that a small child was in the back watching. \nWhen police arrived they found a woman partially naked in the front seat with a man, and a 6-year-old in the back seat who was alert and awake. \nThe couple said they were “cuddling” after eating at McDonald’s. \nPolice arrested Rory Clark, 27, of West Haven, and Kimberly Onorato, 28, of Bristol. Both were charged with second-degree breach of peace and impairing the morals of a minor , and both were released on $5,000 bond. 41.278640 -72.987845",

(AP) – A Connecticut couple is facing charges after police say they engaged in sexual activity in a parked car with a 6-year-old boy in the back seat.\nPolice in Orange say two McDonald’s employees were leaving the restaurant on Nov. 15 when they spotted two people engaged in sexual activity in the front seats of a car. They say the child was in the back seat, awake and alert.\nPolice say they arrived to find 28-year-old Kimberly Onorato partially undressed. Police say Onorato and 27-year-old Rory Clark stated they had only been cuddling.\nClark and Onorato are both charged with impairing morals of a minor and breach of peace. Online court records don’t list lawyers for the pair.\nThe child was turned over to a relative. Police also contacted child welfare authorities.",

      "text": "Taste Test: Coffee purists not keen on McDonald's Peppermint Mocha Tuesday Nov 22, 2016 at 2:00 PM COMMENTARY: Repository testers thought this holiday concoction was just OK. Be careful of the high calorie count. By Laura Kessel Repository engagement editor \nI saw my first Christmas commercial during the World Series, so it's not inconceivable that the early fall abundance of pumpkin flavor is getting a challenge from its winter successor — peppermint. \nIn fact, about two weeks ago, while driving south down Market Avenue to work, I passed McDonald's and noted its sign listed Peppermint Mocha was now available. \n*PERK* \nI'm a mint nut, whether it's the spearmint gum I'm chewing as I write this or the mint chocolate chip ice cream I order at Handel's, or the peppermint tea bags I drop all winter during the work day. \nI'm less a mocha fan, though. The coffee drink amped by chocolate flavor has a tendency to get a bit thick for my idea of an ideal cup of coffee. I treat mochas as a dessert, or even (probably bogusly) an option when I don't want quite THAT much caffeine. \nSo, I met the McDonald's menu sign with a chuckle Thursday morning when I noticed it listed its mocha with Peppermint Hot Chocolate. Aren't they basically the same thing? To my mouth, they usually are. \nBut, we had decided on the mocha, so mocha it was. \nI erred when I ordered, not realizing I could have chosen skim milk over the whole milk that was served up. Thus, it became a little more thick and creamy than I'd probably normally drink. \nSigns make it clear that this drink is a calorie hog. You're looking at as many calories as some of the snack bars we've tried recently, in a beverage. There's some protein to help, though. Mocha offers 8 grams, hot chocolate has 9. \nAs I drove to the office with four mochas sitting next to me in the front seat, I was happily breathing in plenty of mint aroma. When it came time to drink it, though, the chocolate overwhelmed the mint. The farther I went into the drink, the more I found, though. So, when I swished it around, it improved the mix some, but still not enough to bring that mint to the forefront. \nI'll say that a small is plenty. (They offer small, medium and large.) There's enough flavor, whether you find the mint or just enjoy the chocolate, in the small. You'll also be packing on more calories and fat as you increase that serving size, don't forget. Not sure it's really worth that expense, particularly in a season that's already bursting with flavor. \nDon't get me wrong, I enjoyed this drink. I'll likely order a few more as we move through November and more toward Christmastime. Most coffee places have launched or will soon debut their versions of this drink. I'll opt for the skim milk next time, though. \nHere's what our other tasters thought: \nDenise Sautters: \nAs coffee goes, not bad. \nTo be perfectly honest, I am more of a hot tea drinker as long as it is flavored, but this Peppermint Mocha, albeit not that peppermint tasting, is palatable. \nBut, then it isn't bitter like black coffee either. It could easily use a peppermint stick to add to the flavor. Is it worth the calories it carries? Not when I can have a cup of unsweetened flavored tea for zero calories. However, I would buy this again because somedays, you just need that sweet pick-me-up and the caffeine it offers to get going. \nDan Kane: \nMy coffee preference is boringly simple. I like my coffee with cream, no sugar. Not into pumpkin spice lattes, banana cream pie lattes, hot fudge sundae lattes, any of that. So my enthusiasm for this chocolate mint coffee from McDonald's is very low. Frankly, it tastes a bit like green Lavoris mouthwash. \nGary Brown: \nIt's very minty. It helps to like candy canes if you drink McDonald's seasonal Peppermint Mocha flavor coffee. Fortunately, I do. In small sizes. \nIt's that time of year. We're phasing out the Halloween and Thanksgiving java flavors (think pumpkin spice) and moving on into the Christmas coffee concoctions. \nI'm a fan of this, and McDonald's Peppermint Mocha fits into my lifestyle now and then. I could sip a cup of this at night, after dinner, perhaps. Not in the morning. My mornings are for hot, black, unsweetened and eye-opening coffee. \nPeppermint Mocha is creamed and sweet and mint-filled. So, maybe if allowed to cool to warm, it's kind of tasty for drawing a day to a close ... if you can forget you just consumed a cupful of caffeine so you can get to sleep. \nI like such flavored coffees, in moderation and for short duration, so McDonald's Peppermint Mocha seems to me to be not bad for what it does — gets us in the mood for the holiday season. Still, holidays end, and we move on to the next flavor. There's a reason we don't eat ribbon candy all year long. About Us",

      "text": "ORANGE, Conn. (AP) -- A Connecticut couple is facing charges after police say they engaged in sexual activity in a parked car with a 6-year-old boy in the back seat.\nPolice in Orange say two McDonald&apos;s employees were leaving the restaurant on Nov. 15 when they spotted two people engaged in sexual activity in the front seats of a car. They say the child was in the back seat, awake and alert.\nPolice say they arrived to find 28-year-old Kimberly Onorato partially undressed. Police say Onorato and 27-year-old Rory Clark stated they had only been cuddling.\nClark and Onorato are both charged with impairing morals of a minor and breach of peace. Online court records don&apos;t list lawyers for the pair.\nThe child was turned over to a relative. Police also contacted child welfare authorities.\n ",

However, McDonald told \" Power Lunch \" he believes the recent run is more than just a postelection bounce. \n\"Breaking up legislative logjam will be helpful but the global economy has actually been gaining momentum since August. We think this momentum will continue into next year,\" said McDonald, who oversees $946 billion as chief investment strategist for Northern Trust. \n\"As long as rates don't jump too high, which we don't think they will, we think the rally can continue through 2017,\" he added. \nOne of his favorite sectors is financials , which he said will benefit from higher interest rates and the deregulation expected from the Trump administration.",

      "text": "“Would you like fries with that?” \nFor Washington State University potato researchers the answer is always yes. \nNobody in the world buys more potatoes than McDonald’s. \nSo it’s a big deal when the fast-food giant deems a new spud worthy of a ketchup dunking in its 36,615 restaurants worldwide. \nNaturally, the company is picky about its potatoes. \nIn September, Ronald and friends added two new russet potato varieties developed in part by WSU professors in Pullman. \nPotato researchers Rick Knowles and Mark Pavek are the french-fried masterminds behind the spuds. \n“McDonald’s has expert tasters, kind of like with fine wine,” said horticulture professor Knowles. “Their gold standard potato for french fries is a Russet Burbank, which makes a great fry but is really inefficient from a production standpoint.” \n“Burbank has disease issues and requires high soil fertility and water,” said Pavek, an associate professor. “And it has a lower yield of the highest-grade tubers because it’s susceptible to so many stress-related disorders.” \nIf this is about potatoes, then naturally Idaho is involved. \nThe WSU researchers worked with colleagues from the University of Idaho, U.S. Department of Agriculture and Oregon State University on the new potatoes. \nThe Clearwater Russet and Blazer Russet aren’t the first WSU-developed potatoes to be accepted by McDonald’s. Four out of the seven varieties the company uses were developed by the consortium also known as the Northwest Potato Variety Development Program. \nThe Clearwater Russet comes with a bonus: 33 percent more protein than Burbank. \n“Potatoes are already very nutritious, with high levels of vitamin C and a good balance of amino acids,” Pavek said. “But Clearwater Russets are even better. It’s a nice little add-on to an already great potato.” \nSeed production for the two new russets has been ramped up. That’s good for the program as it earns royalties on varieties it develops.",

      "text": "× Couple accused of having sex in McDonald’s parking lot as 6-year-old watched \nORANGE, Conn. – Two McDonald’s employees called police after walking out of the restaurant to find a couple in a parked car “engaged in sexual activity,” police said Monday. \nThe workers had just finished their shifts at the Orange, Connecticut, McDonald’s around 9:30 p.m. on November 15, when they noticed the vehicle. One of the employees told a 911 operator it appeared the pair were having sex, and that “a small child was seated in the back, watching,” according to police. Kimberly Onorato, 28, and Rory Clark, 27, allegedly told police that they were “cuddling” after two McDonald’s employees called 911 to report two people engaged in sexual activity in the parking lot. (Town of Orange Police Department) \nWhen police arrived, they found a woman partially-naked in the front seat with a man, and a 6-year-old in the back seat who was “alert and awake,” WTIC reported. \nThe couple said they were “cuddling” after eating at McDonald’s, according to police. \nOfficers arrested Rory Clark, 27, of West Haven, and Kimberly Onorato, 28, of Bristol. Both were charged with second-degree breach of peace and impairing the morals of a minor. \nThey were both released on $5,000 bond. ",

      "title": "Starbucks Vs. McDonald's",
      "text": "The two companies have grown into giants. \nMcDonald's is an older and more mature company. \nDoes McDonald's have any wisdom to pass down to Starbucks, and Starbucks investors? There are obvious similarities between McDonald's ( MCD ) and Starbucks ( SBUX ). The global fast serve giants are ubiquitous from U.S. to China and nearly everywhere in between. I've seen some articles comparing the two companies in terms of valuation metrics, dividends and potential growth. Which is the better buy? You can find out here and here if interested. However, I want to take a different perspective. How about comparing the companies in terms of how they have grown globally and how the share price has grown? The reason for this angle is simple. McDonald's is a much older company. It passed the 30,000 locations milestone over ten years ago. At that point in time Starbucks still had under 10,000 locations, but it is catching up quickly, and currently has 23,768 stores. Will the company, and the stock, experience similar growing pains? Starbucks' current store count equates to McDonald's in 1997 when it passed 23,000 total stores and was opening 2000 locations a year ( source ). Starbucks is currently growing at almost the same rate and is expected to open 1,800 locations this year. Eventually the growth will slow as global locations become saturated, as shown here by McDonald's: Click to enlarge Starbucks will at some point catch up and its growth will slow in a similar way. We don't know if it will be at 30,000 locations or 28,000, but it is inevitable. What might this mean for the stock price? The Crashing Giants When McDonald's growth began to slow, it's share price wavered too. From the peak of 1999 to the lows of 2003 the stock fell over 75%. You may say it was due to the stock market crash in the same period, but why then did the stock not crash again during the 2007-2009 decline? The S&P500 fell more during this period, yet McDonald's traded sideways and even made a new all time high in August 2008. We cannot make simple cause and effect formulas for stocks. McDonald's fell 75% between 1999-2003 due to a complex mixture of catalysts which all interacted with positioning in the stock. Slowing growth was just one factor. This is also the case for Starbucks. During the same stock market crashes it had the exact opposite reactions to McDonald's. During 1999-2001 it traded sideways and in 2006-2008 it fell over 80%. Lack of growth was not the reason for the 2006 peak: source: knoema.com The number of stores plateau'd in 2009-2011, but this was after the stock dropped 82%. It would be nice to draw a concise conclusion and comparison from all this data, but I simply can't. If Starbucks hadn't corrected so much in 2006-2008 I'd say a crash was almost certainly due in the next few years based on the McDonald's lead. As it is, both stocks have crashed and this gives them very similar stock cycles even when the growth in the companies are slightly different. Stock Cycles The below chart shows each stock side by side on the time axis. McDonald's IPO'd much before Starbucks. It's largest rally (in percentage points) was into the 1999 peak, after which its main correction began. Starbucks' main growth was from its IPO in 1992 to a 2006 peak when its major decline began. If you move the stocks so that their cycles match, this is what you get: Click to enlarge The stocks have gone through the same growth phase, the same corrective cycle, and the same recovery. It also suggests Starbucks has a lag of a few years and still has some catching up to do. This is supported by the idea that Starbucks is still growing its locations and its share price has the potential to grow further and faster. If we take the analogy further and we equate the Starbucks current total stores and growth to McDonald's in 1997, is the price action similar? The year long consolidation does have similarities, and it's worth keeping an eye on the above chart as a guide as it suggests something very similar to the first comparison. i.e. price is likely to make another high, but the general direction is sideways for another year before a final larger rally. This is helpful to me (I am long). I have always known Starbucks' growth will slow, but I haven't really been able to imagine how this will be reflected in the share price. I'm not sure if we get a very close repeat to the two charts above, but I know where price should be heading. As we have seen, McDonald's is more advanced in its cycle, but it is also repeating the same period as Starbucks is in the above chart. This is because markets and stock cycles are fractal. McDonald's is repeating itself and is rallying into a medium term top just like it did in 1999. Click to enlarge The size and type of the decline is unlikely to be similar to 1999-2003, but I do expect a long pause and sideways consolidation when the current cycle is complete. Conclusions There are as many differences as similarities between McDonald's and Starbucks. Please don't point out in the comments section that one sells hamburgers and one sells coffee. I am looking for similarities in growth and in stock cycles. McDonald's has the lead in both and it can act as a guide for investors. Disclosure: I am/we are long SBUX.

      "text": "After an ongoing coffee war, McDonald’s Canada has finally won: WestJet, a Calgary, Canada-based airline, will start serving the chain’s coffee on its flights.\n“The collaboration between our two caring brands is a perfect pairing, as McCaf?’s values are reflected in WestJet’s commitment to offer an unmatched guest experience,” said Gregg Saretsky, WestJet’s CEO, in a statement released Monday. WestJet is the first airline in the world to offer McCaf? on board, McDonald’s Canada’s communications manager Adam Grachnik confirmed to Fortune. \nBoth Starbucks sbux and Tim Hortons thi also bid to supply WestJet flyers with their caffeine buzz. But McDonald’s Canada was mainly chosen based on price and other factors, Toronto Star notes, including a previous partnership with WestJet in children's charities.\nAccording to the press release, those on WestJet flights from Toronto to Calgary will be offered the McCaf? Premium Roast coffee today. The airline will expand the service across its entire fleet, including its regional airline, WestJet Encore, by Dec. 1.\n \nSince a person’s taste buds are less sensitive at flying altitude, the airline's McCafe coffee will be “slightly different” than the coffee served in McDonald's restaurants, according to the Star-- a darker roast of beans and a hotter water temperature will be used in-flight to achieve a similar taste.\nTwo other Canadian airlines serve big-name coffee on their aircraft, the Star reports: Air Canada serves Second Cup coffee on its flights, and Porter Airlines serves Starbucks.\nWe’ve always believed that the sky is the limit for McCaf?,” McDonald’s Canada President John Betts said in the press release, “and today this officially rings true.”",

      "text": "  NNECAPA on Flickr (CC 2.0) \nOwners of an Arkansas McDonald’s franchise paid $103,000 to settle a complaint brought by an employee fired for being HIV -positive. \nThe Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) report that after initially attempting to reach a voluntary pre-litigation settlement through its conciliation process, they filed the lawsuit in July on behalf of the unnamed employee. \nAccording to the complaint, the unnamed employee of a Bentonville, Arkansas was fired in February 2015 when he revealed to a coworker he was interested in dating that he was HIV-positive. The alleged conduct is in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). \n“People with HIV face enough obstacles in their lives,” said Katharine Kores, an EEOC district director, said in a statement at the time of the lawsuit’s announcement. “The ability to work in an environment free of discrimination should not be one of them.” \nThe order of payment came down on Nov. 10, and the company will also be conducting disability training for its managers and revise their policy requiring mandatory disclosure of prescription medications. \n“EEOC remains committed to protecting employees from disability discrimination on the job,” said Faye A. Williams, regional attorney of the agency’s Memphis District Office, which has jurisdiction over Arkansas, Tennessee and portions of Mississippi . “EEOC commends the companies for working with us to quickly resolve this matter prior to trial.”",

One of the employees told a 911 operator it appeared the pair were having sex, and that “a small child was seated in the back, watching,” according to police. Kimberly Onorato, 28, and Rory Clark, 27, allegedly told police that they were “cuddling” after two McDonald’s employees called 911 to report two people engaged in sexual activity in the parking lot. (Town of Orange Police Department) \nWhen police arrived, they found a woman partially naked in the front seat with a man, and a 6-year-old in the back seat who was “alert and awake,” WTIC reported. \nThe couple said they were “cuddling” after eating at McDonald’s, according to police. \nOfficers arrested Rory Clark, 27, of West Haven, and Kimberly Onorato, 28, of Bristol. Both were charged with second-degree breach of peace and impairing the morals of a minor. \nThey were both released on $5,000 bond. 41.278637 -73.026528 ",

      "text": "Home > Finance > McDonald’s franchisee files for bankruptcy McDonald’s franchisee files for bankruptcy Sales losses and competition push Brown Customer Delight Group Inc. to seek debt protection Comments 0 Advertisement \nA six-unit McDonald’s Corp. franchisee based in Iowa filed for bankruptcy this week, citing increasing competition from other chains — and from McDonald’s itself. \nThe company, Brown Customer Delight Group Inc., or BCDG, at one time had 10 locations in the Des Moines area, but has since sold four units amid heavy debt and financial losses. \nIn a filing this week, the operator said that “increased competition from other fast-food restaurants” led to decreased sales in recent years. BCDG also said that McDonald’s construction of new restaurants stole sales from its locations. \nBCDG’s restaurants generated sales of $7.6 million through August, but according to bankruptcy documents, sales fell by $4.5 million in 2015, when the company recorded a loss of just under $900,000. The company reported $6.7 million in assets and $15.6 million in liabilities, according to filings. BCDG’s largest secured creditor is Citizens Bank of Boston, to which it owes $6.1 million. \nBankruptcies among McDonald’s franchisees are relatively uncommon, in part because the company’s franchise agreement strongly discourages such actions, said Richard Adams, a former McDonald’s operator turned consultant. Struggling operators typically sell their restaurants first, he said. \n“If a franchisee is failing, it’s usually better to sell to another franchisee and pray that after debts are paid the franchisee walks away with at least some proceeds,” Adams said. “Filing for bankruptcy hands over all control to the courts and the company.” \nIn this instance, the operator owned a trio of units in suburban Minneapolis for a decade before selling those locations to buy 10 units in Central Iowa in 2011. As part of the deal, BCDG was required to remodel all of the locations, according to BCDG president Larry Brown in a bankruptcy document. \nIn the filing, Brown said that the restaurants did not meet profit expectations, requiring the company to borrow more money to cover the cost of the remodels, which were completed in 2012. \nAccording to the filing, in 2013 McDonald’s said it planned to open a location between two of BCDG’s units in Ankeny, Iowa. Brown said he opted to pay $2 million to buy the location, which was expected to generate $2.7 million in revenue. The location fell $1 million short of that projection, and, he wrote, the two existing locations’ sales declined after the restaurant opened. \nBCDG ultimately decided to sell five restaurants in a bid to reduce debt, but the sale of the restaurants didn’t cover the debt. \nThe company did cut some costs this year, but investments required as part of McDonald’s all-day breakfast promotion offset those savings, the company said in a court document. \nBCDG borrowed money to cover its shortfalls this year and asked a consultant for help in analyzing the operations to find solutions to its problems. The consultant was not able to recommend any solutions. \nIn August, McDonald’s moved to terminate BCDG’s franchise agreement, and the company filed for bankruptcy protection. \nContact Jonathan Maze at",

      "text": "\nCarson Daly announced that Sundance Head and We McDonald who are saved for another round on The Voice. The live playoffs are upon us as the top 11 hopeful artists compete to come out on top on The Voice. Sundance Head, Austin Allsup and Courtney Harrell performed with Blake Shelton.\nSundance’s father, Roy Head, was in the band The Traits, best known for their 1965 hit, “Treat Her Right.” When Sundance was 9, his older brother passed away in a tragic car accident, and his dad began to slow down his music career. At age 20, Sundance had the opportunity to record with ZZ Top through a connection from his dad, but started to play music professionally 13 years later. He put a band together called Sundance Head that plays all over Texas. His wife of nine years is his manager.\nThe name Wé is Kenyan for “diligence,” which is something that Wé has had her entire life. Her father helped her get into vocal lessons at the Harlem School of the Arts, which she still attends after school and on weekends. Wé has performed at Lincoln Center, Carnegie Hall and, most recently, at the Apollo Theater. Although Wé has always found her place with music, she struggled to fit in at school. Kids teased her for her high-pitched voice and thick glasses, but she stuck it out and slowly things got better. Now she embraces her differences and is hoping her uniqueness will help her stand out on The Voice.\nIn the final live-performance phase of the competition, the Top 12 artists compete each week against each other during a live broadcast. The television audience votes to save their favorite artists. The three artists with the lowest number of votes are eligible for the “Instant Save.” These artists each perform a new song that represents why they should earn the save. Then, America has the opportunity to save their favorite performer by tweeting #VoiceSave along with the artist’s name. The singers with the lowest number of votes are sent home each week. In the end, one is named “The Voice” and receives the grand prize of a recording contract.\nShare with us who you liked during the live playoffs in the comments section. Whose performance do you think was better? Who do you think will ultimately win the competition?\nThe Voice Social Media Reactions @NBCTheVoice @SundanceHead congrats Sundance #VoiceResults \n— Caleb Crotser (@calebbaloo) November 23, 2016 \n\n@SundanceHead @blakeshelton Hell yeah!!! #VoiceResults Love me some Sundance! ❤️❤️❤️\n— JS❤️Margaret (@JS_Margaret) November 23, 2016 \n\n. @blakeshelton #VoiceResults great Sundance has an amazing voice,\n— divagirlEdge+ (@divagirlpr) November 23, 2016 \n\nSuperstars Miley Cyrus and Alicia Keys join coaches Adam Levine and Blake Shelton and host Carson Daly this season.

It also comes with a larger sesame seed bun along with the expected special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, and onions.\n\nThe new Mac Jr. features the same special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, and onions but only sports a single beef patty, albeit a slightly larger one, and forgoes the middle bun.\n\nIf you're a Big Mac fan that lives in Florida or the Pittsburgh area, you'll be happy to know that the two new burgers are available there now ahead of the nationwide launch.\n\nPhoto via McDonald's.

      "text": "Is This a Warning Sign for McDonald’s? (MCD) By Dan Moskowitz | November 22, 2016 — 11:26 AM EST \nIt’s not often that McDonald's Corp. ( MCD ) and bankruptcy are found in the same sentence, but that’s the case here. As of December 31, 2015, McDonald's operated 36,525 restaurants, including 30,081 franchised restaurants. By having so many franchisee locations, McDonald’s saves significantly on costs, but this also runs the risk of poor franchisee management, which can then lead to a tarnished brand image. This isn’t to say that was the case with Brown Customer Delight Group Inc., but it’s a possibility. \nBrown Customer Delight Group is owned by Larry and Brenda Brown, who have filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The Browns own five stores in Des Moines and one in Indianapolis. They cited mounting debt and increased competition from company-owned McDonald’s. They specifically mentioned that McDonald’s opened 2-3 company-owned stores in the metro area, which led to reduced sales. Currently, the Brown Customer Delight Group has $6.7 million in assets versus $15.6 million in liabilities . According to court documents, the six stores as a whole lost $4.5 million in 2015. \nIn addition to increased competition from McDonald’s company-owned stores, the Browns stated that they needed technological upgrades in order to support all-day breakfast, which was not received. One way or another, something went wrong at the higher levels at McDonald’s management. Either they didn’t assist the franchisee to help the franchisee succeed or they disregarded the franchisee’s business by opening nearby locations, which thereby led to cannibalization . Another possibility is that McDonald’s didn’t keep a close eye on its franchisee, which is important because of the brand’s image. Either way, there was a failure somewhere along the line. \nThis news isn’t immediately bearish for MCD, but with increased competition and the brand’s reputation for dirty restaurants and poor customer service, it’s a small step backward, and it could indicate that quality control is lacking. \nMCD has depreciated 4.83% over the past 12 months and currently offers a dividend yield of 3.18%.",

      "text": "Email \nORANGE, Conn. – Two McDonald’s employees called police after walking out of the restaurant to find a couple in a parked car “engaged in sexual activity,” police said Monday. \nThe workers had just finished their shifts at the Orange, Connecticut, McDonald’s around 9:30 p.m. on November 15, when they noticed the vehicle. One of the employees told a 911 operator it appeared the pair were having sex, and that “a small child was seated in the back, watching,” according to police. Kimberly Onorato, 28, and Rory Clark, 27, allegedly told police that they were “cuddling” after two McDonald’s employees called 911 to report two people engaged in sexual activity in the parking lot. (Town of Orange Police Department) \nWhen police arrived, they found a woman partially-naked in the front seat with a man, and a 6-year-old in the back seat who was “alert and awake,” WTIC reported. \nThe couple said they were “cuddling”after eating at McDonald’s, according to police. \nOfficers arrested Rory Clark, 27, of West Haven, and Kimberly Onorato, 28, of Bristol. Both were charged with second-degree breach of peace and impairing the morals of a minor. \nThey were both released on $5,000 bond. ",

      "text": "After an ongoing coffee war, McDonald’s Canada has finally won: WestJet, a Calgary, Canada-based airline, will start serving the chain’s coffee on its flights.\n“The collaboration between our two caring brands is a perfect pairing, as McCafé’s values are reflected in WestJet’s commitment to offer an unmatched guest experience,” said Gregg Saretsky, WestJet’s CEO, in a statement released Monday. WestJet is the first airline in the world to offer McCafé on board, McDonald’s Canada’s communications manager Adam Grachnik confirmed to Fortune.\nBoth Starbucks sbux and Tim Hortons thi also bid to supply WestJet flyers with their caffeine buzz. But McDonald’s Canada was mainly chosen based on price and other factors, Toronto Star notes, including a previous partnership with WestJet in children’s charities.\nAccording to the press release, those on WestJet flights from Toronto to Calgary will be offered the McCafé Premium Roast coffee today. The airline will expand the service across its entire fleet, including its regional airline, WestJet Encore, by Dec. 1.\nSince a person’s taste buds are less sensitive at flying altitude, the airline’s McCafe coffee will be “slightly different” than the coffee served in McDonald’s restaurants, according to the Star— a darker roast of beans and a hotter water temperature will be used in-flight to achieve a similar taste.\nTwo other Canadian airlines serve big-name coffee on their aircraft, the Star reports: Air Canada serves Second Cup coffee on its flights, and Porter Airlines serves Starbucks.\n“We’ve always believed that the sky is the limit for McCafé,” McDonald’s Canada President John Betts said in the press release, “and today this officially rings true.”",

One of the employees told a 911 operator it appeared the pair were having sex, and that “a small child was seated in the back, watching,” according to police. Kimberly Onorato, 28, and Rory Clark, 27, allegedly told police that they were “cuddling” after two McDonald’s employees called 911 to report two people engaged in sexual activity in the parking lot. (Town of Orange Police Department) \nWhen police arrived, they found a woman partially-naked in the front seat with a man, and a 6-year-old in the back seat who was “alert and awake,” WTIC reported. \nThe couple said they were “cuddling” after eating at McDonald’s, according to police. \nOfficers arrested Rory Clark, 27, of West Haven, and Kimberly Onorato, 28, of Bristol.

      "text": "A Vintage Doll Finds Love In McDonald’s ‘Toy Story’-esque Christmas Ad By Chloe Pek   The festive season can trigger feelings of loneliness, especially when you are a vintage wooden doll stuck in the window of a toy shop. Putting the spotlight on Juliette the doll this season, Leo Burnett London imagines a lone doll who has spent a year left on the shelf. The wait becomes harder to bear as Christmas approaches, and Juliette is left staring out at a McDonald’s across the road, where everyone seems to be enjoying a meal with family and friends. Finally, Juliette decides to make a break for it and finds love in ‘Meteor Mike’, with the blessing of the toy shop owner as she returns to a new home. The red-haired doll , which will be at the center of McDonald’s Christmas campaign, was created with 3D printing, and her facial features painted by hand. Watch the magical and heartwarming ad below.",

One of the employees told a 911 operator it appeared the pair were having sex, and that “a small child was seated in the back, watching,” according to police. Kimberly Onorato, 28, and Rory Clark, 27, allegedly told police that they were “cuddling” after two McDonald’s employees called 911 to report two people engaged in sexual activity in the parking lot. (Town of Orange Police Department) \nWhen police arrived, they found a woman partially-naked in the front seat with a man, and a 6-year-old in the back seat who was “alert and awake,” WTIC reported. \nThe couple said they were “cuddling” after eating at McDonald’s, according to police. \nOfficers arrested Rory Clark, 27, of West Haven, and Kimberly Onorato, 28, of Bristol. Both were charged with second-degree breach of peace and impairing the morals of a minor. \nThey were both released on $5,000 bond. ",

      "text": "This gives new meaning to the term \"McDonald's Playland.\"\nA Connecticut couple was arrested last week after they were caught having sex in a McDonald's parking lot—in front of a 6-year old boy.\nPolice in Orange, Conn., said that two McDonald's employees were on their way out of the restaurant on November 15 when they discovered a couple \"engaged in sexual activity in a parked car,\" according to an Associated Press report . The employees said that a 6-year-old boy, who was \"alert and awake,\" was right behind the couple in the back seat. The report did not note whether the child was the couple's son.\n'Demon Rat' Day Care Van Terrifies Parents and Children\nWhen police arrived, they found Kimberly Oranato, 28, partially undressed in the vehicle, along with 27-year-old Rory Clark. According to police, the couple claims they had only been cuddling.\nBoth Clark and Oronato were charged with impairing the morals of a minor (for, you know, cuddling) and breach of peace (that must have been some enthusiastic cuddling).\nPolice notified child welfare authorities of the \"cuddling\" incident and turned the child over to a relative.\nThe report does not mention whether anyone else at McDonald's got a side of morals-corrupting cuddling with their Big Macs that night.\nApparently, it's not completely unheard of for couples to get their cuddle on at McDonald's. In 2013 a couple was kicked out of a UK McDonald's for having sex on the floor ... in the bathroom of the restaurant. In 2014 two women were attacked after they were discovered having sex in an Upper Darby, Penn., McDonald's ... again, in the bathroom.\nBut it's not just recreational sex that parents need to be concerned about. Last year a homeless man was charged with capital sexual battery in Jacksonville, Fla. after his horrific attack on a 6-year-old boy.\nKeep your kiddos close, parents.\nhttps://pjmedia.com/parenting/2016/11/23/couple-arrested-for-sex-in-mcdonalds-parking-lot-in-front-of-a-6-year-old-boy/",

(AP) — A Connecticut couple is facing charges after police say they engaged in sexual activity in a parked car with a 6-year-old boy in the back seat. \nPolice in Orange say two McDonald's employees were leaving the restaurant on Nov. 15 when they spotted two people engaged in sexual activity in the front seats of a car. They say the child was in the back seat, awake and alert. \nPolice say they arrived to find 28-year-old Kimberly Onorato partially undressed. Police say Onorato and 27-year-old Rory Clark stated they had only been cuddling. \nClark and Onorato are both charged with impairing morals of a minor and breach of peace. Online court records don't list lawyers for the pair. \nThe child was turned over to a relative. Police also contacted child welfare authorities.

In the spirit of Giving Tuesday, local McDonald’s in Central N.C. along with Duke Energy and Ticketmaster have partnered with Tim Stevens, founder of Garner’s own Broadway Voices, to host “Three Phantoms in Concert.” \nThis two-hour concert will feature music from popular Broadways shows, including Phantom of the Opera, Les Miserables, Guys and Dolls and more. \nOne hundred percent of the proceeds from ticket sales will be donated to relief and recovery efforts in North Carolina through the N.C.

The organization has served more than 300,000 meals and has completed tear outs and mud outs of hundreds of homes in the last two weeks since the hurricane. \nShow Details: \nTime: 7:30 PM \nLocation: Duke Energy Center for the Performing Arts, 2 E. South St., Raleigh, NC 27601 \n“We are humbled to be a part of this effort and look forward to supporting all of the families in our state recovering from the hurricane,” said local McDonald’s Owner/Operator Doris Huebner. \nTicket prices start at $20 and can be purchased at Ticketmaster , DukeEnergyCenterRaleigh.com or at the Duke Energy Center Box Office.

It could concern Hurricane Matthew or just have happened in everyday life. McDonald’s wants to continue to spread the lovin’! \nYou can make a comment by clicking the Comment Bubble at the top right of this post.

      "text": "Feng Qian   By: Kimberly Onorato and Rory Clark \n\nPolice were called after people spotted a couple in Connecticut, having sex outside of a McDonald’s.\n\nKimberly Onorato, 28, and Rory Clark, 27, were arrested after being accused of having sex in a vehicle that was in a McDonald's parking lot with a child in the back seat.\n\nPolice in Orange, said the incident occurred around 9:30 p.m., at the fast food restaurant on Boston Post Road.\n\n“McDonald's employees who were leaving work after their shift ended at 9:30 p.m., noticed a car parked outside the store with two people inside,” Orange police said on Facebook. \n\n“The two adults appeared to be involved in sexual activities in the front seats of the car while a 6-year-old child was sitting in the back, watching. The child was sitting in the backseat, and was awake and alert,” police said.\n\nThe woman was partially undressed when officers arrived. The couple told police that they had only been “cuddling” after enjoying a meal at McDonald’s. However, police said that witnesses declared otherwise.\n\nOnorato and Clark were arrested. The child was placed in the custody of a family member. The incident was also reported to the Department of Children and Family Services.\n\nClark was charged with impairing the morals of a minor. He was released after posting a $5,000 bond.\n\nOnorato was charged with impairing the morals of a minor and second-degree breach of peace. She also posted a $5,000 bond. ",

      "text": "11/23/16 08:05 am EST . FRISCO, Tx. (KXAS-TV) A McDonald's employee in Frisco has been a familiar face at the drive-thru for 14 years. John Marsh is the kind of worker who remembers everyone. \"If I see you one or two times, I'm going to remember you,\" said Marsh. \"When you hit that corner, I'll be smiling. I'm going to know you. I may not know your name, but I'm going to know you.\" Marsh, 62, is college-educated with degrees in business management and criminal justice, and he has a master's degree in gerontology. Marsh has also beaten bladder and prostate cancer. He said he was injured on the job in 2002 and was diagnosed with cancer a year later. Over the years, his medical bills have piled up. Marsh, who works 14 hours a week and makes $10 an hour, said life has become overwhelming. \"One night, I fell to my knees and said, 'Lord, would you please help me?' I was laying in my bed, tears rolling down my eyes, and my pillow was soaking wet,\" said Marsh. With the help of a friend, Marsh created a GoFundMe page . In less than 24 hours, he raised $20,000. John Keating is one customer who developed a relationship with Marsh over the years. \"When you're John Marsh and you have that warm smile and firm handshake, and you have that gift of remembering everybody's name, that's powerful,\" said Keating. \"If you're having a bad day, go through the McDonald's drive-thru and you'll get cheered up right away. He'll reach out to give you that handshake and remember something about you.\" Watch the story from KXAS here. Filed under:",

      "text": "Email \nIt’s official: McDonald’s says that every one of its 14,000 stores nationwide will be replacing cashiers with automated touch-screen kiosks. They’re starting with stores where minimum-wage laws mandate the highest rates, such as Florida, New York, San Francisco, Boston, Chicago, Washington, D.C., and Seattle. \nAccording to CNNMoney : So the fast food giant is rolling out self-order kiosks, mobile pay options, an updated interior design, even table service. The changes are already starting to show up at locations in Florida, New York and Southern California, where 500 restaurants have been updated. Restaurants in San Francisco, Boston, Chicago, D.C. and Seattle will get upgrades in early 2017. Now, McDonald's loyalists will be able to place their customized order on a touch screen, take a seat and have their meal brought right over. Next year, they'll even have the option of mobile ordering. \nThat means that, eventually, more than 20 million customers every day will place their own orders at a kiosk or on a mobile device and then have them delivered by a human to their table. And it’s just a matter of time before those humans will be replaced by machines as well. \nEd Rensi started as a grill man for McDonald’s in Columbus, Ohio, in 1966. He was promoted to manager within a year and continued to be promoted, all the way up to president and chief operating officer in 1984. In 1991, he was named chief executive officer and retired to a life of speaking professionally about his experiences in 2007. \nIn May, Rensi was asked about the discussion over raising the minimum wage. He responded: “I guarantee you if a $15 minimum wage goes across the country you’re going to see a job loss like you can’t believe. It’s cheaper to buy a $35,000 robot than it is to hire an employee who’s inefficient making $15 an hour bagging French fries.” \nIt’s all about the math. Rensi oversaw every aspect of McDonald’s: sales, profits, operations, customer satisfaction, product development, personnel, and training. If a store can replace a $15 an hour employee with a robot that costs $35,000, it will not only improve that store’s operating margins but will actually enhance customer experience: robots don’t get sick, they don’t have attitudes or get pregnant, they don’t go on strike, they always show up for work on time, and, as software improves, will provide a friendly, interactive interface with the store. \nMcDonald’s decision will also answer, finally and forever, the question that economics textbooks and economics professors have been raising and then trying to answer for decades: What impact will raising the minimum wage have? Supporters of minimum-wage laws say that they increase the standard of living of workers, reduce poverty, reduce inequality, and boost the economy as well as the morale of workers. \nOpponents say minimum-wage laws increase unemployment and poverty and are especially damaging to small businesses that are forced to raise their prices to cover the increased labor costs. \nHere’s the math: a worker being paid $15 an hour costs his employer $38,500 a year, including unemployment insurance and the employer’s part of Social Security. If Rensi is right, and the average robot in a McDonald’s costs $35,000, in less than a year that store has paid for it in reduced wages, and eliminates that $15 an hour cost forever after. If there are 30 employees in a McDonald’s, and if just 10 of them are replaced by a robot, customers will enjoy another benefit: lower prices on their Happy Meals. \n\nAn Ivy League graduate and former investment advisor, Bob is a regular contributor to The New American magazine and blogs frequently at LightFromTheRight.com, primarily on economics and politics.

It would have made more than 4 million private-sector workers eligible for overtime or time off, beginning on Dec. 1. \nThe liberal Center for American Progress, which is closely aligned with the White House, said the ruling increases the likelihood that President-elect Donald Trump will dump the overtime rule completely next year. \n“By enjoining the rule, the Eastern District has made it easy for Republicans to wipe the rule away completely once President-elect Donald Trump takes office,” said CAP senior vice president Angela Kelley. “One judge has prevented millions of Americans, who are not currently guaranteed overtime protections, from getting a much needed raise.” \nIndustry hailed the decision as a needed check against the administration’s executive overreaching on costly regulations. \nThe Labor Department’s change to the overtime rule required employers to pay time-and-a-half to employees who worked more than 40 hours per week and earned less than $47,476 a year. \nThe salary threshold is about twice the current exemption from overtime pay. \nThe judge said the Labor Department regulation exceeded the authority granted it by Congress. He said the department has the right to define which workers are considered salaried, but only based on the duties performed, not by how much they are paid. \nDebra Ness, president of the National Partnership for Women & Families, called the judge’s ruling “an appalling overreach that must not stand.” \n“By updating wage and hour protections that had been allowed to erode for decades, the new rule would help stop an egregious form of worker abuse and put fair wages in the hands of millions of workers who labor at their jobs for more than 40 hours per week,” she said.",

      "text": "Share This \nA couple of McDonald’s co-workers in Connecticut were at the end of their shift when they noticed two nasty people engaging in intercourse right outside the restaurant in plain sight. However, their sex acts weren’t all that the shocked employees saw. They were sickened by what was between the two and called the police to report it. 28-year-old Kimberly Onorato (left), McDonald’s (center), 27-year-old Rory Clark (right) \nWhile diners inside a West Haven McDonald’s restaurant were trying to eat, 27-year-old Rory Clark and 28-year-old Kimberly Onorato were caught up in their sex acts right outside the window, which nobody needed to see. If the intercourse wasn’t disgusting enough, what else was there made it much worse, which some employees saw as they were leaving their shift around 9:30 p.m. that night. \nThere’s nothing romantic about McDonald’s or their parking lot, but that didn’t matter to the amorous pair who found a connection with each otherÂ there and decided to consummate it in public. However, it wasn’t just the unfortunate onlookers that were watching, the couple had a 6-year-old child in common between them that was forced to be a spectator of their sex acts from the backseat of the car they were all in, according to the New York Daily News . \nThe employees leaving work immediately called 911 mostly with regard to the fact that there was a child forced into this sickening situation. When officers arrived, the partially undressed couple said that they were just “cuddling” after enjoying their McDonald’s meal, although it was clear to everyone in and out of the car that they were having sex in front of this kid. \nClark and Onorato were arrested and charged with second-degree breaches of peace and impairing the morals of a minor. It’s unclear if the child belongs to the man, woman, or both, but this predatory pair should also be hit with child abuse for what they forced upon this 6-year-old, who was reportedly “alert and awake” for the entire ordeal. Clearly, this couple has no control over their urges if they’re willing to drop their pants in public at a McDonald’s with a kid in tow, which leaves one to wonder what other dirty deeds this child has seen.",

(Paul Sakuma/AP)  25 PM \nShe won’t McLeave. \nFor the last three weeks, an unnamed woman has taken up residence in a Swedish McDonald’s with the hope of finding a more permanent place to live in her spare time, according to local news reports. \nShe reportedly travelled to the city of Velanda, where she hopes to live, and then camped out inside the fast-food chain. \n“We have opened around the clock and it’s warm in the building,” an employee explained to a local newspaper . “We tried to speak to her about how she can’t stay here, but it hasn’t worked. She keeps coming back.” McDonald's around the world \nEarlier this week, employees reported her for trespassing after she tried to re-enter the restaurant — still though she remained at the eatery, even after police officers offered to buy her a train ticket back to her hometown. Instead, she hopes to live in Velanda in spite of having no friends or family there because she knows the area well. \n“We have tried everything, the social services, security, police, the church, the women’s shelter,” the McDonald’s employee continued. “We want to get rid of her but she’s still living here. It’s clearly frustrating.” Join the Conversation:",

      "text": "Shortly after Laquan McDonald was killed in a hail of bullets by Chicago Police Officer Jason Van Dyke in October 2014, U.S. Attorney Zachary Fardon huddled with Cook County State’s Attorney Anita Alvarez and the FBI to discuss their parallel investigations of the shooting.\nVan Dyke is now facing a murder charge in Cook County criminal court, and a Cook County grand jury is investigating whether officers lied in their reports.\nWhat’s less clear is where Fardon’s investigation stands today. One year after his office insisted its investigation “remains active and ongoing,” the federal probe now appears to be on hold.\nBut former federal prosecutor and Chicago Police Board President Lori Lightfoot shared a different theory Monday during a Better Government Association panel about the legacy of the McDonald shooting on police reform.\n“By early December 2014, that case was with the U.S. attorney’s office and the FBI. And then nothing happened,” Lightfoot said. “So frankly, one of the questions that we got to ask ourselves is, what happened with the U.S. attorney’s office? Why is it that now, two years later, nothing’s happened? Now, I think the truth is, that we can all conclude — and there are many former prosecutors here in the room — we know what happened, which is that case got closed.”\nShe said the U.S. attorney’s office “didn’t do its job.” And when asked why, Lightfoot responded, “I think that’s a question that you’re going to have to ask my friend and former colleague, Zach Fardon, because I think he’s the only one who knows how to answer it.”\nA spokesman for the U.S. attorney’s office wouldn’t comment. But Fardon addressed the McDonald case — without mentioning it by name — during a Sept. 26 speech to the City Club. Fardon discussed the interplay between state and federal prosecutors, and he suggested his office is waiting to see how Cook County’s prosecution plays out.\n“When the state decides to charge an officer, my office often will wait rather than risk jamming up the state’s prosecution,” Fardon said. “When we make that decision to wait, we monitor the state case to see how it is resolved, and once the state case is done, we make a decision whether or not to charge federally. In making that decision, the key factor is whether we the think the state result, including any prison sentence, has rendered justice.”\nFardon also said there are times when, even if his office has enough evidence to prosecute, he’ll defer to state authorities. He said double jeopardy laws could kick in — and interfere with a state prosecution — if he charges someone first. And the state’s murder and manslaughter charges carry a heavier penalty.\n“The state often carries a bigger criminal stick than the feds” when it comes to the use of excessive force by police officers, Fardon said. “Whether we like it or not, that’s the reality.”\nAn attorney for Van Dyke didn’t respond to a request for comment.\nCook County Judge Leroy Martin Jr. recently appointed Patricia Brown Holmes as a special prosecutor to investigate whether officers lied to cover up for Van Dyke. Holmes, a former Cook County associate judge and former assistant U.S. attorney, may also look into the conduct of the officers’ supervisors.\nA dashboard camera on a police vehicle provided video showing Van Dyke firing at McDonald on Oct 20, 2014 while the troubled 17-year-old walked away with a knife in his hand — contradicting officers’ reports that McDonald lunged at police with the knife.\nChicago Police Supt. Eddie Johnson has moved to fire Van Dyke, along with three officers and a sergeant who he has found lied about the shooting.\nThe Cook County state’s attorney had opened a criminal investigation on Nov. 4, 2014 after obtaining a copy of the video of the shooting. Fardon then met with Alvarez and the head of the FBI on Dec. 8, 2014 and a federal investigation was opened, authorities said.\nOn April 15, 2015, the City Council voted to pay McDonald’s family a $5 million legal settlement, before the family even filed a lawsuit. It wasn’t until a year ago — on Nov. 24, 2015 — that the city released the controversial shooting video to the public and Alvarez charged Van Dyke with murder.",

      "text": "Orange Police/Cosmopolitan Fewer things seem less like an aphrodisiac than a quarter-pounder with cheese, but apparently such is not the case for everyone: A Connecticut couple is facing charges after police say they engaged in sexual activity in a parked car with a 6-year-old boy in the back seat.\nPolice in the town of Orange, Connecticut say two McDonald's employees were leaving the restaurant on Nov. 15 when they spotted two people engaged in sexual activity in the front seats of a car. They say the child was in the back seat, awake and alert.\nPolice say they arrived to find 28-year-old Kimberly Onorato partially undressed. Police say Onorato and 27-year-old Rory Clark stated they had only been cuddling after eating a meal at McDonald's.\nClark and Onorato are both charged with impairing morals of a minor and breach of peace. Online court records don't list lawyers for the pair. Clark was released after posting a $5,000 bond and is due back in court on Dec. 15; Onorato was also released after posting $5,000 bond and is due in court on Dec. 8.\nThe child was turned over to a relative. Police also contacted child welfare authorities. A public service announcement for anyone else out there whose Happy Meal has put them in the mood for a happy ending: There are better places to get it on than a McDonald's parking lot and better ways to do it than in front of a little kid, for example anywhere else and any other way.\nAdditional reporting by the Associated Press.\nFollow Hayley on Twitter .\n ",

      "text": "close more In this Thursday, Dec. 5, 2013, file photo, protestors demonstrate outside a McDonald's restaurant in Oakland, Calif. A federal court on Tuesday, Nov. 22, 2016, blocked implementation of a rule imposed by President Barack Obama's administration that would have made an estimated 4 million more higher-earning workers across the country eligible for overtime pay starting Dec. 1, 2016. The U.S. District Court in the Eastern District of Texas granted the nationwide preliminary injunction that prevents the Department of Labor from implementing the changes while the regulation's legality is examined in more detail by the court. (Ben Margot, File/AP Photo) A federal judge in Texas has issued an injunction against President Obama's rule that would expand overtime pay to millions of workers who do not currently get paid extra for working longer hours. The rule was set to take effect Dec. 1, and it would require employers to pay overtime to anyone earning less than $47,476 a year. Here & Now 's Peter O'Dowd speaks with MSNBC's Ali Velshi ( @AliVelshi ) about what is expected to happen to the rule. Related:",

      "text": "This McDonald's Christmas Ad Follows a Vintage Toy Looking for Love By: Riley von Niessen   youtube & designtaxi With the fast food giant getting into the holiday spirit, this heartwarming McDonald's Christmas ad was released. Dubbed 'Juliette the Doll,' it opens with an elderly shop owner removing the toy from a box, which he then places on display in a window. Juliette looks out the window longingly, watching the patrons at the fast food chain enjoying themselves. Although Christmas is quickly drawing nearer, the doll still hasn't been purchased. However, Juliette takes a chance and runs across the street to the restaurant, where she finds love with another toy. With the McDonald's Christmas ad, the company illustrates togetherness and that its locations are a great place for consumers to enjoy one another's company. It also showcases the selection of toys it offers for children as well.",

      "text": "A Rare Bankruptcy for a McDonald's Franchisee By Investopedia | November 23, 2016 — 1:47 PM EST \nMcDonald's (NYSE: MCD ) apparently only wants big operators serving up fries with that shake as one small franchisee just declared bankruptcy -- a rarity among its operators -- and others have been pushed to sell their handful of locations to bigger franchisees. \nBrown Customer Delight Group, which ran six McDonald's in Iowa, said the restaurants generated gross sales of $7.6 million year to date through August but recorded $4.5 million in losses last year, due in large part to two factors. First, Brown was required by the chain to upgrade its restaurants with such things as double-lane drive-through windows, digital menu boards, and the new equipment required to serve all-day breakfast -- and those stores didn't generate enough revenue to cover the costs of the improvements. Second, the parent chain opened several new, competing McDonald's in its markets. \nBCDG reported having about $15.6 million in liabilities but just $6.7 million in assets. \nAccording to Nation's Restaurant News, bankruptcies among McDonald's franchisees are a relatively rare occurrence because the agreement franchisees sign tends to discourage them. Instead, it pushes for selling stores to another franchisee. BCDG is hoping McDonald's will buy its restaurants from it, though the fast-food chain's refranchising push might make that unlikely, even though it is only a half dozen restaurants. \nApproximately 85% of McDonald's are owned by franchisees, but the burger king expects to sell about 4,000 company-owned restaurants to franchisees through 2018, en route to its long-term goal of becoming 95% franchised. \nBloombergBusinessweek , however, reports McDonald's is also seeking to squeeze out the little guys like BCDG that own just a handful of restaurants. It says since 2014, the number of U.S. franchisees has fallen by 2.6%, even though the number of franchised locations has grown 1.2%, suggesting more restaurants are being consolidated into fewer hands. \nAlthough McDonald's has long had a reputation for championing the expansion of small owners who have just one or two stores, as the burger chain has sought to reverse its loss of customers, it has made expensive changes such as those that dogged BCDG, and apparently feels bigger operators will be better able to finance the costs. \nWhile bankruptcies among McDonald's franchisees may still be rare, we may start to see more of them if the chain's restaurant don't start generating more foot traffic -- or at the least, we'll see the big guys continue to swallow smaller ones. \n10 stocks we like better than McDonald's When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, Motley Fool Stock Advisor , has tripled the market.* \nDavid and Tom just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy right now... and McDonald's wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. \nClick here to learn about these picks! \n*Stock Advisor returns as of Nov. 7, 2016 \nRich Duprey has no position in any stocks mentioned.

      "text": "Summary \nMcDonald's posted a net income of $1.27 billion for its third quarter and diluted EPS of $1.50. \nThe company has negative shareholders’ equity of about $1.6 billion. \nTotal liabilities exceed total assets ($34.11 billion vs $32.48 billion). \nIn the last six years, revenue growth has become somewhat stagnant, actually declining by 2% ~ 7% from previous years. \nThe fast food industry is highly competitive as fast food chains vie for the cheapest meal deals. \nClick to enlarge \nSource: McDonalds \nWhat is negative shareholders' equity? \nIn simple terms, assets minus debts are equity. On our house mortgage, the amount borrowing - total payment paid = equity. If we sell the house and pay the remaining mortgage amount, the money left over will be the equity; it can be positive or negative. If we buy a house for $200k, make mortgage payments totaling $10k, then sell the house for $170k, we now have a negative equity of 20k (loss). \nSimilarly, as per McDonald's third quarter SEC filing , they have $32.48 billion in total assets and $34.11 billion in total liabilities. That translates to $1.6 billion negative shareholders' equity (minus $1.6 billion = $32.48 - $34.11 billion). This means that if McDonald's (NYSE: MCD ) goes out of business today, and sold everything to pay their outstanding debt, there would be nothing left for the common shareholders. However because the company is generating positive net income so far, it still has value. \nFinancial and Operational Performance: \nSince 2011, McDonald's has been generating total revenue of $25 ~ 27 billion, net income of $4.5 ~ $5.5 billion and a diluted earnings per share of about $5 yearly in a sustainable manner. \nClick to enlarge \nSource: Created by Author (data obtained from SEC filing) \nClick to enlarge \nSource: Created by Author (data obtained from SEC filing) \nShare Performance: Overall, stock has been trading in one direction only (upward) except for a pull back around 2004. The stock traded at an all-time high of around $130 (close to the current level). There is no doubt that the return on investment for long-term investors should have been good. \nClick to enlarge \nSource: Tradingview (notation added by author) \nDividends: The Company has been paying steady quarterly dividends. In 2014, they paid $3.28 dividend per share. In 2015, they paid $3.44 dividend per share. For 2016 (three quarters), they paid $2.67 dividend per share at an average of $0.89 per share. The company announced that the fourth quarter dividend will be $0.94 cents a share . \nClick to enlarge",

Swedish Woman Refuses to Leave McDonald’s for THREE WEEKS While Searching for a New Home November 23, 2016 \nAn unnamed woman has taken up residence inside of a Swedish McDonald’s while she looks for a permanent place to live. \nvia NY Daily News : She reportedly travelled to the city of Velanda, where she hopes to live, and then camped out inside the fast-food chain. “We have opened around the clock and it’s warm in the building,” an employee explained to a local newspaper . “We tried to speak to her about how she can’t stay here, but it hasn’t worked. She keeps coming back.” Earlier this week, employees reported her for trespassing after she tried to re-enter the restaurant — still though she remained at the eatery, even after police officers offered to buy her a train ticket back to her hometown. Instead, she hopes to live in Velanda in spite of having no friends or family there because she knows the area well. “We have tried everything, the social services, security, police, the church, the women’s shelter,” the McDonald’s employee continued. “We want to get rid of her but she’s still living here. It’s clearly frustrating.” \nSounds like quite the McProblem. Share this:",

      "text": "11/24/16 AT 5:10 AM Close \nThe annual Macy’s Thanksgiving Parade in New York City isn’t the only big turkey day event in the nation. Every year, the McDonald’s Thanksgiving Parade, known as “Chicago’s grand holiday tradition,” marches down State Street in Downtown Chicago. \nWith “Veep” actor Matt Walsh serving as Grand Marshall, the 2016 parade will include tons of floats as well as performances from Ringling Bros. & Barnum and Bailey, “Stomp,” “Finding Neverland” and music from “America’s Got Talent.” Whether you’re watching the parade on TV or in person, we have you covered with all the information you need to know. \nDate and time: The McDonald’s Thanksgiving Parade will be held on Thursday, Nov. 24, and begins at 8:00 a.m CST (9 a.m. EST) and run until 11:00 a.m. CST. Related Stories Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade Draws Notable Names \nRoute map: The parade will take place on State Street and begins at Congress. The parade will then move northbound to Randolph where the one-mile route will end. \nViewing spots: If you want to catch the parade in person, it’s recommended that you arrive early for a good spot. If you’re looking for a less crowded area, head to State and Adams Street, but according to the Chicago Festivals website, “anywhere along State Street from Congress to Randolph has excellent viewing.” Getting a spot between Congress and Harrison will give you a look at the parade units as they begin their march. \nWhere to watch: If you can’t make to the parade, you can still watch on TV. All of the parade festivities will air locally live on WGN 9 Chicago or nationally on WGN America starting at 8:00 a.m. CST. Even if you’re not in the Chicago area, WGN America may be carried by your cable provider. The parade can also be streamed at WGNTV.com . \nCheck out everything you need to know about the 2016 McDonald's Thanksgiving Parade.

      "title": "This Homemade Breakfast Sandwich Is Better (and Cheesier) Than McDonald’s",
      "text": "This Homemade Breakfast Sandwich Is Better (and Cheesier) Than McDonald’s November 24, 2016 / 9:30 am By Daisy Meager \nOffice workers rush in and out of Quilombero , a new Argentinian Italian restaurant in East London’s redeveloped East India Dock, to grab their morning brew. But I’m fixated on head chef Gabriel Pryce, who is carefully placing ingredients for one of the restaurant’s breakfast sandwiches on the kitchen counter. \nThick loaves of rosemary focaccia. Beautifully fatty slices of mortadella sausage. Eggs. American cheese (yep, the plastic, individually wrapped stuff you usually find melted on supermarket burger patties). Focaccia on the grill for Quilombero’s breakfast sandwich. All photos by the author. \nAs Pryce cuts a generous square of focaccia, he tells me: “A nice lady from the council came by the other day and asked if I wanted to take part in their healthy eating competition. All I would have to do is submit a sandwich recipe …” \nI don’t think this particular combination of ingredients would score green on the nutritional traffic light front. But with Quilombero’s breakfast beast, that’s not really the point. Gabriel Pryce, head chef of Quilombero in London’s East India Dock. \nPryce used to head up the kitchen at Rita’s , a bar and restaurant he founded with bartender Missy Flynn and business partner Deano Jo. Long known as the best place to get fried chicken and cocktails in Hackney, the much-missed eatery closed earlier this year. \n“Quilombero is about doing something slightly experimental but also just having fun,” explains Pryce, who opened Quilombero with Flynn shortly after Rita’s ended. “After having a high-pressure, full-on restaurant for three years, this is a temporary project. It’s not about being super serious but cooking delicious and approachable food that marries Italy and Argentina.” \nFocaccia placed on the grill and smothered in salsa verde, I find out that the cuisines of northern Europe and South America aren’t as worlds apart as they sound. And the decision to dabble in both was inspired by the space we’re standing in now. \n“We weren’t sure that the extraction fan worked, so we thought about building a kitchen outside with a wood-fired oven. That got us thinking about people like Francis Mallmann, who’s this Argentinian Patagonian fire master,” says Pryce. “Then we were travelling around Italy and ended up in Genoa when we realised the place had a link with Argentina.” Mortadella for the sandwich. \nHe continues: “Many Italians migrated to the South American country in the late 19th century. There’s a language that developed in Argentina called Lunfardo, which is a combination of Italian and South American slang. And Quilombero means ‘trouble maker’ in Lunfardo.” \nSo, where do the breakfast baps come in? \nPryce laughs. “I just have this affection for the breakfast sandwich,” he says. “Since I started working professionally as a chef, I don’t eat breakfast any more. The last time I ate breakfast was when I lived and went to college in the States. You get a sausage, egg, and cheese on the way to school. It’s that easy grab and go breakfast.” \nHe adds: “I also love that thing as a kid when you go past a train station with a McDonald’s and you’re like, ‘Oh my God, I’m actually awake when they’re still serving the breakfast sandwich.’ It has a kind of mythical thing about it. Then you realise as an adult that they serve them until 10:30 AM and you should probably be awake then anyway.” \nAt this point, Pryce removes an American cheese slice from its pack. And another. And another. And another. \n“I’m obsessed with American cheese!” he says, seeing my jaw drop. “I love all kinds of cheese and I know a lot about cheese but the melt and texture of American cheese … it’s not even the taste. It’s what it does to a sandwich.” Pryce blowtorches the American cheese. \nSeparating a couple more slices, he adds: “‘It’s just like putting cream and butter and cheese into something without feeling bad about putting three things in. You just have to put in one.” As if my arteries weren’t clogging up enough in anticipation, Pryce heaps mortadella on the grill \n“Mortadella is a baloney-style sausage. What they do when they make it is whip the meat so that all the fat is stretched out,” says Pryce. “So, it has chunks of back fat in it like a salami, but it just also has fat perfectly dispersed through every single bit of it. When you grill it, it just kind of oozes this amazing melty fat.” \nCall the ambulance now. \nPryce starts layering up the sandwich and blowtorches the cheese to melt it (“We’d usually finish it off in the oven but it’s full”) while assuring me that not all of the food at Quilombero is like this blow-out brekkie sandwich. And besides, there are roast peppers in there too. Well, if I’m getting one of my five a day … \n“Oh, and there’s a fried egg to go in the sandwich as well. Because it’s breakfast.” \nSandwich sliced and served, Pryce hands me a plate and says with a grin: “It’s kinda dirty and kinda gross but it’s delicious. It’s everything you want in a sandwich.” The Quilombero breakfast sandwich with mortadella, American cheese, and fried egg. \nYou might have guessed that this is not food to be eaten daintily. But who the hell cares when you’ve crispy on the outside, soft on the inside focaccia crammed with all kinds of oozy, melty stuff between your fingers and thumbs? \nPryce is right when he says breakfast sandwiches are mythical things. You’re not supposed to eat them every day, but when you’re hungover AF or need to smash the day ahead, they’re exactly what you need.",

He wanted a divorce. He was in love with another woman and couldn't stand the thought of being cooped up on a ship with his wife for weeks on end. Ray and Joan: The Man Who Made the McDonald's Fortune and the Woman Who Gave It All Away, by Lisa Napoli Ray & Joan: The Man Who Made the McDonald's Fortune and the Woman Who Gave It All Away. by Lisa Napoli \nRay told his lawyer, who was also at the party, to break the news to Jane and offer her their home and $3 million in their bank account as a settlement. Then he vanished, leaving revelers to console his weeping wife. The trip was off. The marriage was over. \nThe woman Ray wanted to marry was Joan Beverly Mansfield Smith, writes Lisa Napoli in Ray and Joan: The Man Who Made the McDonald's Fortune and the Woman Who gave It All Away . The two had met in a St. Paul, Minn. lounge where Ray was having a drink and discovered Joan, a beautiful young blond woman playing the piano and singing. The attraction was mutual, but both were married, and Joan was 25 years younger. She accepted his first proposal, then turned it down, wary of his charming but demanding personality, before finally deciding to marry him in 1969. \nHer life would change dramatically after the wedding -- and not always for the better. Ray Kroc, then owner of the San Diego Padres, acknowledges applause before the season opener in this file photo taken April 10, 1974 \n(DMN file/AP /San Diego Union Tribune) \nRay was the founding chairman of McDonald's, a salesman who turned a San Bernadino, Calif., burger stand into one of the largest international brands of the 20th century. He became a rich man in the process, and not always pleasant to be around. Joan, too, was a strong-willed woman, and the two \"squabbled and fought with great passion and intensity,\" Napoli writes. \nTheir fights often occurred when Ray was drinking, and Joan began to think the problem was his affinity for Early Times whiskey. She tried to talk to him about his drinking, but he refused to listen. \nA friend convinced Joan to attend Al-Anon, the support group for people affected by a loved one's drinking, and those meetings changed her life. She began to understand that alcoholism was a disease that affected the whole family, and she resolved to launch a \"social revolution\" to make the word alcoholism acceptable. Joan Kroc speaks of her late husband, Ray Kroc, and his dedication to The Salvation Army at a ceremony on Sept. 23, 1998, in San Diego. \n(DMN file/AP Photo/Lenny Ignelzi, File) \nAs author and journalist Napoli tells the story in Ray and Joan , Joan had at her disposal a \"magnificently appointed\" ranch in the San Diego area where they lived with a conference facility. She invited key figures in alcohol education and rehabilitation to meetings and urged representatives of the media to attend. After Dear Abby gave the program a plug in her column, Joan's social revolution was in full throttle. It even had the complete support of her husband, though Ray would never give up his Early Times or acknowledge his own alcoholism. \nTwo days before Christmas 1979, Ray suffered the first of several strokes he would have in the next four years. They left him feeble and mostly dependent on a motorized cart to get around, and on Jan. 14, 1984, his \"heart gave in to his afflictions.\" He was dead at age 81. \nRay's death left Joan at age 55 with a staggering fortune, and she loved giving it away. She enjoyed getting involved personally with her benefactors, including Elizabeth Taylor, to whom she hand-delivered a check for $1 million after Taylor threw her support behind the foundation for AIDS research. She also invited Rosalynn and Jimmy Carter to lunch when they came to San Diego to build houses for the poor with their Habitat for Humanity project. Joan presented them with 100,000 shares of McDonald's stock, then worth about $3.5 million. \nParticularly interested in helping the poor and underprivileged, Joan pledged $80 million to build and maintain a Salvation Army community center in San Diego. It was the largest gift the organization had ever received. Lisa Napoli, author of Ray and Joan: The Man Who Made the McDonald's Fortune and the Woman Who Gave It All Away \nPreston Wiles \nJoan would continue giving to causes of all kind, becoming one of the most generous philanthropists in American history before she died of brain cancer at age 75. Later, the Salvation Army would get an estimated $1.5 billion from Joan's estate, and today 26 of the organization's community centers have been opened from Hawaii to Puerto Rico. \nMy only complaint about Napoli's book is the lack of an index, making it difficult to pin down specific events. It would also have been nice to have seen photos of Ray and Joan when they were young. That said, Napoli has done an impressive job of researching and writing the story of two extraordinary people and their considerable accomplishments. Elizabeth Bennett is a freelance writer in Houston. \nRay and Joan The Man Who Made the McDonald's Fortune and the Woman Who Gave It All Away Lisa Napoli",

Super-eater (yep… there’s a such thing ) and YouTube sensation Yuka Kinoshita laid all of our overeating guilt trips to rest with her latest video. So, good ahead and grab those seconds, thirds and fourths without shame, guys! The tiny woman elegantly scarfed down her weight’s worth of Japanese Micky D’s treats, including: five Big Macs, ten dark chocolate pies, ten white chocolate pies, three tiramisu McFlurries, three large fries and three large cokes! And, spoiler alert, she totally lived to tell the tale. Watch Yuka devour he McDonald’s treats in the viral video, below! Mind. Blown. We have to admit, our stomachs totally hurt after watching Yuka in action. The real question is…how in the hell did she make room for everything?! On the other hand, Japanese McDonald’s food looks a lot…well, lighter than that of the American menu. We can almost bet that we wouldn’t have to eat half of what she sate to meet the 10,000 calorie quota. But hey, we’ll take any guilt-free reassurance we can get when it comes to stuffing our faces this season. Dig those stretchy jeans up out the back of your closets, because you’ll definitely need them!",

      "text": "Business In this Thursday, Dec. 5, 2013, file photo, protestors demonstrate outside a McDonald's restaurant in Oakland, Calif. A federal court on Tuesday, Nov. 22, 2016, blocked implementation of a rule imposed by President Barack Obama's administration that would have made an estimated 4 million more higher-earning workers across the country eligible for overtime pay starting Dec. 1, 2016. (Ben Margot / Associated Press)  12 P.M. U.S. businesses cheer overtime ruling; many already upped pay By Michelle Rindels Associated Press Twitter \nLAS VEGAS – Businesses around the country on Wednesday cheered a court decision blocking the Obama administration’s sweeping new overtime rules, but many had already raised salaries or ordered managers to stick to a strict 40-hour workweek to avoid costs they expected to incur starting next week. \nAn injunction issued Tuesday by the federal court in the Eastern District of Texas prevents the Department of Labor from mandating overtime pay for salaried employees who make less than about $47,500 a year – a dramatic jump from the old threshold of $23,660. \nMore than 4 million workers would have been newly eligible for time-and-a-half pay under the rule, which now faces far more uncertainty from Donald Trump’s incoming administration. \nThe ruling giving businesses a reprieve “is a little late for a lot of people’s taste,” said Tom Gimbel of Chicago-based LaSalle Network, a staffing firm that advised companies on how to prepare for the new rule. “A lot of companies had already rolled it out.” \nWal-Mart, for example, raised entry-level managers’ starting salaries by $3,500 in September to stay above the threshold. But there were also raises among clerical workers for Opportunity Village in Las Vegas, a nonprofit that teaches vocational skills to people with disabilities and raises its money through private donations and running a thrift store. \nOpportunity president Bob Brown said he couldn’t bear to backtrack on the decision. \n“It’s put us in a difficult situation – you’re spending money you wouldn’t have been spending,” he said. \nIn Colorado, some restaurant owners operating on thin margins shifted salaried managers to hourly pay so they could better track their hours and cap them at 40. \n“That was demoralizing for managers who felt they were being demoted,” said Sonia Riggs, CEO of the Colorado Restaurant Association. \nThe Department of Labor last May ordered the changes to give overtime to many more American workers, saying they would “go a long way toward realizing President Obama’s commitment to ensuring every worker is compensated fairly for their hard work.” \nInflation had weakened the U.S. overtime law passed decades ago. Overtime provisions applied to 62 percent of U.S. full-time salaried workers in 1975 but just 7 percent today. \nThat means some low-level retail and restaurant managers are making $25,000 a year but aren’t eligible for overtime, even when they’re working 60 hours a week. \nThe court agreed with the rule’s opponents that the labor department overstepped the authority it has from Congress and that the rule could cause irreparable harm if it took effect Dec. 1 as scheduled. The department is now considering its legal options, but Trump will be in charge of the department after taking office on Jan. 20. \nTrump told the news website Circa in August that he hoped small businesses would get an exception from the overtime rule, although the issue was not a prominent presidential campaign theme. \nThe rule’s supporters are now grappling with implications for workers who were expecting more overtime pay just as the holiday shopping rush gets underway. \n“This is about the worst news they could get heading into Thanksgiving and the holiday season,” said Vicki Shabo, vice president of the National Partnership for Women & Families, a Washington, D.C.-based group that promotes workplace fairness. \nWorkers who want to make a good impression on their employers, feel compelled to cover for absent co-workers or are passionate about their jobs often put in far more than 40 hours a week and end up making a sub-minimum wage. Advocacy groups say employees who work for free are giving up time they could be spending with their families or advancing their education to get better paying jobs. \nBut businesses said the rules would have created an overly restrictive environment that would have penalized younger and slower workers. \n“We were going to have to send them home at times,” said Jose Villa, president of the Los Angeles-based ad agency Sensis. “Say, `You’re done for the day, you have to go,’ even though we’re working on some important stuff that’s going to be very educational for them.” \nWith the overtime pay order suspended, Trump’s administration could choose to make its own rule changes through a lengthy administrative process. \nThe Republican-controlled Congress could change the country’s labor laws, although House Speaker Paul Ryan had decried the overtime plan “an absolute disaster” that Obama rushed through to boost his political legacy. \nIf the labor department lawyers appeal Tuesday’s ruling, they could end up facing a Supreme Court that includes some Trump appointees. \nThe injunction takes political pressure off the Trump at a good time, said labor law professor Ruben Garcia of the University Nevada Las Vegas’ Boyd School of Law. \nWith no new overtime changes kicking in next week, Trump can accept the status quo and does not risk angering workers by revoking the new overtime benefits shortly after employees start receiving them, Garcia said.  12 p.m.",

      "text": "Huh, so *this* is what eating 10,000 calories worth of McDonald’s looks like We just got a peak at what eating 10,000 calories of McDonald’s looks like, and we’re amazed. Super-eater (yep… there’s a such thing ) and YouTube sensation Yuka Kinoshita laid all of our overeating guilt trips to rest with her latest video. So, good ahead and grab those seconds, thirds and fourths without shame, guys!\nThe tiny woman elegantly scarfed down her weight’s worth of Japanese Micky D’s treats, including: five Big Macs, ten dark chocolate pies, ten white chocolate pies, three tiramisu McFlurries, three large fries and three large cokes! And, spoiler alert, she totally lived to tell the tale.\nWatch Yuka devour he McDonald’s treats in the viral video, below! Mind. Blown. We have to admit, our stomachs totally hurt after watching Yuka in action. The real question is…how in the hell did she make room for everything?!\n\nOn the other hand, Japanese McDonald’s food looks a lot…well, lighter than that of the American menu. We can almost bet that we wouldn’t have to eat half of what she sate to meet the 10,000 calorie quota. But hey, we’ll take any guilt-free reassurance we can get when it comes to stuffing our faces this season.\nDig those stretchy jeans up out the back of your closets, because you’ll definitely need them!\nThe post Huh, so *this* is what eating 10,000 calories worth of McDonald’s looks like appeared first on HelloGiggles .",

(KRQE) – A McDonald’s in Rio Rancho opened its doors to anyone who wanted a Thanksgiving meal. \nFor the 22nd year McDonalds and St. Felix Pantry teamed up to serve meals to anyone who came in for one. Some who showed up to eat said it was a time to be around some friendly people to spread the love of the Thanksgiving holiday. \nAlong the serving line were the Rio Rancho Police Chief and the Rio Rancho Mayor who say it’s an honor to be there. \n“There’s so many people that volunteer their time here and you know as mayor to join this is absolutely wonderful,” said Rio Rancho Mayor Greg Hull. \nThey expected to serve more than 700 people Thursday. ❯❯ Click the Icon below to share this post...",
